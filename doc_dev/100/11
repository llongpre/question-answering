<F P=106> [Article by Ann Marsh: "Slovak Dam Project Remains a Source </F>
of International Tension"] 
  [Text] Water traffic along the Danube river, blocked for 
more than a month because of a malfunction at Slovakia's 
Gabcikovo dam, lurched back into motion April 27, clearing the 
way for hundreds of irate ship owners to complete their 
deliveries. 
  Caused by a mixture of bad luck, bad blood and bad planning, 
the breakdown of the dam's lock system has featured the 
suspected murder of a ship captain, insinuations of espionage 
and millions of dollars in damages claimed by shipping companies. 
  It also has fulfilled some of the worst predictions about 
the 
communist-era dam and hydroelectric project, which began 
operating in 1992. 
  "The impact is tremendous," said Karl Brewi, general 
director 
of the Vienna-based Austrian Danube Shipping Company (DDSG), 
which had 30 vessels delayed. Although Slovak dam officials say 
80 vessels were stuck in queues--51 upstream and 29 
downstream--shipping companies put the number in the hundreds as 
crews waited in Hungarian or Austrian ports for the go-ahead. 
  The most recent trouble at the controversial Gabcikovo 
hydroelectric plant--which has been the focus of a 
Hungarian-Slovak transborder dispute for years--began Feb. 11 
when a Ukrainian tugboat capsized in the dam's right lock. The 
captain was found hanged inside the half-submerged vessel. 
  Slovak police are suspicious of the apparent suicide. 
  "A ship has an accident and the captain thinks he must hang 
himself in the next couple of minutes?" said Miroslav Liska, 
spokesman for the Bratislava-based Water Development Authority 
(Vodohospodarska vystavba), which operates the dam. The captain, 
Liska pointed out, was nearing retirement and had just bought a 
car that he was bringing home to Ukraine. 
  "A Ukrainian who just bought a car would not hang himself," 
he said. "It shows that maybe he did not hang himself, but was 
hanged." 
  Slovak police may never learn the full story, because the 
Ukrainian crew left the scene shortly after the accident, when 
Ukraine insisted on removing the crippled vessel without Slovak 
participation. This operation took close to a month, while 
Ukrainian ships arrived and then removed the tug. "We wanted to 
remove it immediately," Liska said, "but we were too benevolent." 
  During this time, Gabcikovo's left lock slowly ferried the 
dam's regular 20 to 30 ships a day back and forth, although it 
had been scheduled to shut down Feb. 12 for a routine 
inspection, Liska said. On March 20, just over a month after the 
first accident, the left lock broke down, bringing all traffic 
to a halt. 
  Shipping companies were outraged to learn that Gabcikovo has 
no emergency gate--a standard feature of any lock system. Aside 
from criticism about the dam's effect on local farmland and 
water tables, this omission supported long-standing claims that 
the dam was poorly constructed. 
  Under the terms of the original Slovak-Hungarian agreement 
for constructing the cross-border waterworks, signed in 1979, 
Hungary was to build an emergency gate on its side. After 
Hungary unilaterally backed out of the agreement in 1992, a move 
Slovaks continue to call illegal, no emergency gate was built. 
One is under construction now on the Slovak side and should be 
completed by late 1995, according to Liska. 
  Though Slovak dam officials have no explanation for the 
breakdown of the left lock, diving teams claim to have found a 
cable that may have interfered with the lock's seal. Espionage 
is suspected. The final word is pending, however, while the left 
lock is fully drained and an investigation is completed. 
  River traffic started moving again April 27 after the right 
lock went back into operation and a Romanian ship passed through 
a test run at 11 a.m. The last of the ships stuck in the 
month-long queue was expected to pass through by the next day. 
  With delayed deliveries of steel, iron ore, agricultural 
products and liquid fuel, DDSG puts its damages at more than $3 
million. 
  "It is not correct to operate a lock system like Gabcikovo 
without these doors," DDSG's Brewi said. Brewi plans to seek 
damages from Gabcikovo and expects his Hungarian and Ukrainian 
counterparts to do the same. "They have suffered even higher 
losses than we have," he said. 
  One possibility may be to appeal through the technical 
section of the Danube Commission, which oversees operation along 
the river but has little authority to extract fines. Another 
possibility is taking the matter to the International Court of 
Justice in The Hague. 
  In either case, the shipping companies are ready for a 
fight. 
  Gabcikovo has already rejected a $6 million claim from 
Ukrainian shipping companies, Liska said. "I don't think anyone 
can claim damages [from road authorities] when a big crash 
happens on the highway and the traffic is delayed."
