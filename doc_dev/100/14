<F P=106> [Report by Jan Skoda: "Waiting Not for Water but for the </F>
Government"] 
  [Excerpts] On Monday [17 January], Hungary presented to 
the European Union [EU] headquarters in Brussels its official 
response to the EU experts' recommendation concerning the 
division of Danube water at Gabcikovo. This was announced by 
Gyorgy Tatar, Hungarian ministerial commissioner [title as 
published] for the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power 
project. Tatar stated in the Hungarian daily NEPSZABADSAG that, 
while Hungary submitted its response by the EU's deadline, the 
same allegedly cannot be said of Slovakia. 
  We have, therefore, contacted the Slovak mission at the EU 
headquarters in Brussels and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 
Bratislava. They confirmed to us that, in a letter at the 
beginning of the year, Jan Lisuch, state secretary at the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asked EU mediator Pablo Benavidez 
to extend the original 15 January deadline, set for the 
Hungarian and Slovak sides to submit their responses, until the 
end of the month. He explained this request by the fact that 
the Slovak Government has been unable to discuss its standpoint 
so far. The standpoint had been prepared several times, but it 
was necessary to incorporate into it comments from individual 
government departments, which has delayed the whole process. 
According to Vladimir Cemez, PhD, from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, the response was to be on the agenda of yesterday's 
meeting of the Slovak Government. According to our information, 
however, this did not happen. [passage omitted] 
  Hungary is now accusing us that a month and a half was not 
enough for us to assume a position on the EU's recommendation 
concerning the temporary division of Danube waters. Gyorgy 
Tatar claims, moreover, that the Slovak attitude actually 
confirms our negative stand on the EU recommendation, which, 
according to Hungarian newspapers, proposes that 40 percent of 
the Danube water remain in the river's original bed and that 
Budapest build two small dams on its territory. 
  In this affair, which may seem immaterial, we are, thus, 
once 
again in the position of the "evil" side that does not honor its 
commitments. Without trying to act as a judge, let us only 
observe that, this time, this is absolutely unnecessary.
