  [Text] Bratislava, April 8 (CTK) -- A note sent today by 
the Slovak Foreign Ministry to the Hungarian Embassy in 
Bratislava expresses Slovakia's readiness to resume as early as 
possible the talks on the establishment of a temporary water 
regime on the Danube. 
  The Slovak Ministry thus responded to a note from the 
Hungarian Foreign Ministry of March 28, in which Budapest urged 
the Slovak government to resume the negotiations immediately. 
The Hungarian note reacted to Slovakia's rejection of a 
compromise proposal by European Union experts for the method of 
division of the Danube's water between the original bed of the 
border river and a derivation canal built by Bratislava on 
Slovak territory. Budapest itself accepted the compromise 
proposal, though with reservations. 
  In opposition to this, the Slovak note recalls that the EU 
experts had also recommended to build weirs in the Danube's 
original bed to prevent drying up of some river's branches, but 
the Hungarian parliament recently rejected the weirs' 
construction. Nevertheless, in its document Bratislava says it 
favors further search for a rational and effective solution to 
the problem.
