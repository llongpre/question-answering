  [Text] Bratislava, March 23 (CTK) -- The Slovak Foreign 
Ministry strongly protests against Hungarian pressure on the 
international public designed to discredit the contribution of 
the Gabcikovo dam to traffic on the Danube, a ministry's 
statement published today says. 
  The statement responds to Tuesday's [22 March] statement by 
the Hungarian Government, saying the Slovak Government bears 
responsibility for the blockage of the Danube at the 
Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydro-electric power station for 
unilaterally redirecting part of the Danube along a derivation 
canal on Slovak territory in November 1992. 
  The Hungarian Government called upon countries supporting 
free passage on the Danube to urge Slovakia to "stop its illegal 
activities and revive without delay the conditions for traffic." 
  Ship transport was interrupted due to accidents at the 
Gabcikovo dam in southern Slovakia on March 21. 
  The Slovak statement says there are no international 
dimensions of the danger to the power station. By contrast, the 
one-year operation of at Gabcikovo confirmed that conditions for 
accelerated ship transport along a 42-kilometers route had 
improved. 
  The Foreign Ministry says that Slovak authorities would take 
all necessary steps in order to revive international traffic.
