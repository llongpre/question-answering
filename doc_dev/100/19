  [Text] Budapest, 29 March (MTI) -- On March 29, the 
Hungarian Foreign Ministry passed a verbal request to the Slovak 
embassy in Budapest. 
  The Hungarian Government -- in accord with European Union 
recommendations for water division, which were rejected by 
Slovakia -- calls upon the Slovak Government to open bilateral 
talks on a temporary water management regime immediately, the 
ministry's press department informed MTI on Wednesday [30 March]. 
  The Slovak side unilaterally diverted the Danube in 1992, to 
operate the Gabcikovo power station. Since then, the main 
riverbed has been supplied with much less water than before, 
endangering the ecological balance of the Szigetkoz region. 
  The negotiations are urgent because the vegetation growth 
period has already begun. The talks are also justified by 
obligations which the two sides assumed in a Separate Treaty 
concluded in connection with The Hague trial. 
  Hungary's government stressed in the communique that it is 
indispensable to guarantee a considerable increase in the water 
discharge to the main riverbed.
