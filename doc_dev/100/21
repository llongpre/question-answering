<HEAD>2,000 Protest Danube Power Project</HEAD>

   About 2,000 Hungarian environmentalists
marched to the Austrian Embassy on Friday to protest a Danube River
power project near Nagymaros, Hungary, which is being financed by
Austria, a participant said.
   The man said police refrained from interfering and even cleared
the way for marchers through car-congested streets from downtown
Budapest to the embassy in the foreign diplomats' central district.
   The marcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called it an
unusual sign of police cooperation with the young members of the
unofficial Danube Circle ecological group.
   In another departure, state-run television ran, without comment,
a one-minute film segment on its main evening newscast showing
protesters arriving at the embassy. Among them was biologist Janos
Varga, a leader of the ecologists.
   The marchers carried placards and banners demanding a halt to
the project, a joint venture involving hydropower installations on
the Danube at Gabcikovo in Czechoslovakia and at Nagymaros.
   Banners read ``We Want Clear Water,'' ``No Dams'' and ``We Want
Our Danube.''
   Hungarian and Austrian ecologists have said that damming up the
Danube water and slowing its flow will threaten drinking water
reserves of millions of Hungarians and destroy large areas of
riverside forestland in both Hungary and Czechsolovakia.
   The protester said demonstrators were met with applause and
cheers from passers-by on the march to the embassy.
   Under an Austrian-Hungarian contract signed on May 29, 1986, 70
percent of the construction work $483 million will be carried out
by Austrian companies.
   A delegation of four was allowed to enter the embassy to hand
over a resolution protesting Austria's financial participation,
Austria Press Agency reported.
   It said the Austrian ambassador was not there but promised the
protesters by telephone a written reply to their plea.
   The first turbine of the Nagymaros station is to go into
operation in 1990.
   Hungary will repay construction costs by supplying Austria with
electricity for 20 years, starting in 1996.
