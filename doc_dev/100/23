<HEAD>Police Help 2,000 Protest Danube Power Project</HEAD>

   Police stood by peacefully as about
2,000 people protested a Danube River power project, a sign of
Communist authorities' increasing tolerance of dissent that does
not challenge them directly.
   A participant in Friday's demonstration said police refrained
from interfering and even cleared the way for marchers as they
wound their way through downtown Budapest to the Austrian Embassy.
   The project in Nagymaros, Hungary, is being financed largely by
Austria.
   The marcher, who spoke on condition of anonymity, called it an
unusual sign of police cooperation with the young members of the
unofficial Danube Circle ecological group.
   State-run television also took the unusual step of running,
without comment, a one-minute film segment on its main evening
newscast showing protesters arriving at the embassy.
   Among them was biologist Janos Varga, a leader of the ecologists.
   The marchers carried placards and banners demanding a halt to
the project, a joint venture involving hydropower installations on
the Danube at Gabcikovo in Czechoslovakia and at Nagymaros.
   Banners read ``We Want Clear Water,'' ``No Dams'' and ``We Want
Our Danube.''
   Hungarian and Austrian ecologists have said that damming the
Danube and slowing its flow will threaten drinking water reserves
of millions of Hungarians and destroy large areas of riverside
forestland in both Hungary and Czechsolovakia.
   Under an Austrian-Hungarian contract signed on May 29, 1986,
Austrian companies will carry out 70 percent of the $483 million
worth of construction work.
   A delegation of four was allowed to enter the embassy to hand
over a resolution protesting Austria's financial participation,
Austria Press Agency reported.
   It said the Austrian ambassador was not there but promised the
protesters by telephone a written reply to their plea.
