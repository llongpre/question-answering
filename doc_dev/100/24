  [Summary] Ukraine became a member of the Commonwealth of 
Danube Lands [Spivdruzhnist Dunayskykh Zemel] on 23 June. A 
session of the Commonwealth took place near Budapest on 23 June, 
where Ukraine was represented by Odessa Oblast. The issues of 
losses caused by UN sanctions against former Yugoslavia, the 
economy, the environment, and joint action by Danube lands in 
the areas of sport and tourism were examined at the session. 
Delegations from Germany, Austria, the Czech and Slovak 
Republics, Romania, and Bulgaria took part. 
  Ruslan Bodelan, people's deputy of Ukraine and chairman of 
Odessa Oblast Council, who headed the Ukrainian delegation, said 
at Budapest airport: "This is another step toward our state's 
claim to the possibility of resolving issues jointly with our 
counterparts, with other countries. This especially concerns 
use of the Danube artery as a river, along which cargoes can and 
should be transported with the help of our Danube Shipping 
Company. It is about resolving problems of the ecological state 
of the Danube, preserving our reservations and national parks, 
and developing national culture and national traditions."
