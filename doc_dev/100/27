  [Text] Budapest, 24 May (MTI) -- A sophisticated 
environment-protection programme for the Danube region has been 
initiated recently by the Hungarian Ministry of Environment and 
Regional Policy. Hungary also claims that an international 
project should be approved in order to provide for all drainage 
areas of the river. Hungary is the only European country 
threatened by critial conditions in water supply around the year 
2000. 
  The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations 
(FAO) registers Hungary among the first 30 (mainly desert) 
states whose drinking water supply is not secured for the 
future. Ninety-five percent of the surface waterways of the 
country originate abroad, which causes purity and quantity 
problems. In 1992 Hungary initiated an environment-protection 
programme for the Danube Basin. In order to solve present 
problems, which foreshadow further ones in the future, water 
management should be regulated under an agreement, with strong 
commitment by all concerned to carry through their respective 
obligations, Hungarian authorities say. Hungarian specialists 
say that although the country's water reserves are expected to 
decline in the following years, they will probably still meet 
all demand after the turn of the century. 
  Waiting to see the issue of surface waterways settled, 
Hungary is striving to preserve its underground water reserves. 
There is no agreement with Ukraine, Romania, or Slovakia that 
would oblige these countries to inform Hungary on water 
pollution occurring in their own territories. Slovakia, for 
example, takes out such a large amount of water from the river 
Sajo each summer that the Sajo enters Hungary no longer as a 
river but rather as a small stream. Besides, Slovakia operates 
two barrage irrigation systems on the river Ipoly. Another major 
problem is the decline in water reserves near the Gabcikovo 
barrage system. 
  Water filtered through gravel beds is excellent for 
consumption. Wells operating on this principle supply the 
population of the Danube Bend and Budapest through a pipe water 
system and might serve as the drinking water source of around 4 
million people in the future. (The population of Hungary is 10.3 
million.) Nitrate pollutants have to be filtered in these wells 
too, although 15 years ago this was not necessary. (Most of the 
pollution is due to the lack of sewage networks in nearby 
settlements.) The river Tisza in the eastern part of Hungary, 
which springs from Ukraine and has been known for its clean 
water over the past 25 years, has recently become polluted at 
places. The river Koros, originating in Romania, has also 
declined in quality. 
  "Karst" and artesian waters are the real preserves of 
Hungary. According to recent figures, their quantity exceeds the 
consumption of the public, industry, and agriculture. Though 
mining has caused long-lasting and difficult-to-remedy changes, 
experts expect earlier, better conditions to return within a 
decade's time. 
  The Danube-Tisza region in eastern Hungary has been 
seriously 
endangered by the lack of irrigation water. In the past 15-20 
years, successive droughts have reduced the ground water 
surface. Traditional plants being unable to absorb water from 
3-6 metres down, new species had to be introduced. However, 
declines in the region's agricultural production have been 
considerable. 
  Ninety-eight per cent of Hungary's population drinks piped 
water. Per capita water consumption has fallen to 150 litres per 
day from 250 litres in earlier years. Experts say that drinking 
water should be separated from water used for other purposes 
(washing, watering, etc.) with an extra pipe system added, as it 
has been already in some western European countries.
