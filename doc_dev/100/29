  [Text] Bratislava, March 22 (CTK) -- Julius Binder, 
director of the construction company which built the 
controversial Gabcikovo dam on the Danube, told Slovak Radio 
today he did not rule out that the accidents at the gates of 
Gabcikovo's two locks were the result of sabotage. 
  A part of the left lock's bottom gate was torn on Sunday [20 
March] night due to a so far unknown reason. The resultant wave 
under the dam damaged mechanisms on the bottom gate of the right 
lock, which has been blocked by the wrecked Ukrainian boat 
Zernograd. International ship transport in this section of the 
Danube has been interrupted. It is expected to be resumed by 
the end of the week. 
  "The commission in charge of finding the cause of the damage 
has not yet disclosed its conclusions. Accident is 
inconceivable, and intentional damage cannot be ruled out," 
Binder said. "Everyday efforts to block the success of the dam 
are evident," he added. 
  He pointed out that the locks' gates have been operating for 
a year, and before the wreckage of Zernograd on February 11 they 
were to undergo modification to eliminate problems. Binder 
stressed that any defect in the gates was unlikely. 
  Binder said that neither the accidents nor the spring thaw 
posed a threat to the residents of the surrounding area. There 
is a reserve to divert surplus water, he explained. 
  "It is strange that since the beginning the left lock and 
the 
Gabcikovo dam as a whole have been accompanied by many hazards," 
Binder said. He referred to the theft of electronic regulating 
devices at the left lock, the tearing off of control cameras by 
a lorry, irresponsibility of the crew of Zernograd and the slow 
pace of its removal, and the unnatural substances found in wells 
destined for the examination of underground water. "Enemies of 
the dam exist here and are working intensively," Binder 
emphasizes. 
  He said that the repair of the locks will not cost much, 
only 
millions, not tens of millions of crowns. "However, the problem 
lies in the moral damage, in negativistic tendencies which will 
emerge throughout the world," he pointed out.
