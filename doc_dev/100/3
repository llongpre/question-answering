  [Text] Vienna, May 9 (CTK) -- Representatives of the 
Austrian section of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) warned 
today of the pollution of the Danube flood plain forests by the 
Slovak Gabcikovo water project. 
  The area, which is located on a large gravel subsoil, is the 
second biggest European source of drinking water. 
  The WWF, which is now launching a campaign to establish a 
national park in the Danube flood plain forests between Vienna 
and Slovak border, demonstrated the adverse effects of the 
regulated water flow on nature to journalists from Germany, 
Austria, and the Czech Republic during a several-day educational 
excursion. 
  The self-purification of the flood plain forests as well as 
the heterogeneity of its fauna and flora depend on the changing 
level of the river. Regular floods in this unique landscape are 
a precondition of its existence, Alexander Zinke from the WWF 
said. 
  By diverting 80-90 percent of the Danube water into an 
insulated channel, the old riverbed receives only a minimum 
amount of water, which will soon entirely change the natural 
character of the landscape. 
  The Austrian environmentalists have proposed a ``tender 
variant'' which entails letting 65-75 percent of the Danube 
waters flow in the old riverbed. 
  At least three years will elapse before the Hungarian-Slovak 
dispute at the International Court of Justice at The Hague is 
settled. In the meantime, many species will be exterminated, 
the WWF stressed.
