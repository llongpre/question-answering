Government officials accused Hungary on Monday of violating international law 
by halting work on a joint dam project and said that Prague will seek 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
The regional Presidium in Slovakia, the eastern portion of federated 
Czechoslovakia, said Hungary must finish its section of the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
twin dam project on the Danube River. 
</P>
<P>
Budapest said Saturday that it will make a final decision on whether to 
continue work on the Nagymaros dam, about 20 miles northwest of Budapest, after 
a two-month review. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary's official MTI news agency quoted a senior Czechoslovak Water Ministry 
official as saying that canceling Nagymaros would cost Czechoslovakia $2.7 
billion and that Prague would ask Budapest for damages. 
</P>
<P>
"The unilateral step of the government of Hungary contradicts valid 
Czechoslovak agreements and international law," the Slovak presidium said in a 
statement carried by CTK news agency. 
</P>
<P>
"The presidium asks the federal government to adopt immediate steps necessary 
for the fulfillment of the valid international agreement between Czechoslovakia 
and Hungary, and requests Hungary to consistently keep the agreement." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Czechoslovak Communist Party newspaper Rude Pravo accused 
Hungarian opposition forces of using the dam project as a means to attack the 
Budapest government. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition in Hungary to the Nagymaros project has been mounted on ecological 
and economic grounds, and 150,000 people have signed a petition condemning it. 
</P>
<P>
In Hungary, the dam project has come to symbolize the rift between Premier 
Miklos Nemeth, a reformer who wants to scrap the scheme, and party leader 
Karoly Grosz, who has said he would vote to complete it.
