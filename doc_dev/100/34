<HEAD>Energy Official Says Controversial Dam Project Can Be Stopped</HEAD>

   A Hungarian energy official Tuesday was
quoted as saying a controversial dam project opposed by tens of
thousands of environmentalists could be stopped ``in the nation's
interest.''
   The statement was the latest sign Hungary may pull out of the
project, a multimillion-dollar plan with Czechoslovakia and Austria
to make the Danube River more navigable and build power stations in
Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
   About 140,000 Hungarians have signed a petition calling for a
referendum on the project, which has been under fire since it was
first agreed to in the late 1970s.
   Opposition in Hungary has become more vocal as democratic groups
have gained more say in politics in recent months. The more
orthodox Czechoslovak Communists, who insist the project should be
completed, expressed irritation with the opposition in their party
daily last weekend.
   The plan to build the Hungarian dam at Nagymaros, about 30 miles
upstream from Budapest on the Danube, is seen by many Hungarians as
a symbol of the centralized economic planning of the past in which
citizens were given no say.
   Czechoslovak officials already have invested $1.1 billion in a
much larger dam and power station being built as part of the
project at Gabcikovo, about 40 miles east of Bratislava.
   Environmentalists have long argued the project affecting more
than 60 miles of the Danube will destroy wetlands with unique
wildlife. They also claim a huge underground reservoir of drinking
water will be spoiled by the power stations and canals to be built
along the river.
   ``Our position is that the Nagymaros construction can be halted
but Gabcikovo must be completed,'' Istvan Papp, director of
Hungary's state Energy Economy Institute, told the daily Mai Nap
newspaper on Tuesday.
   ``This compromise would be a solution best serving the nation's
interests,'' he added.
   Experts on both sides acknowledge the projects are too
interrelated for Gabcikovo to be effective without the Hungarian
dam.
   Hungary's government and parliament are to debate the call for a
referendum on Nagymaros this month. However, even opponents of the
project question the wisdom of putting such a complex issue to a
popular vote.
   Papp said the government would save half a billion dollars by
stopping investment in the project, which on the Hungarian side has
been financed in part by Austria in return for future deliveries of
electricity.
   Papp said his calculations did not include the cost of
compensating Austria and Czechoslovakia if Hungary pulled out of
the project.
