   Tens of thousands of people
exercised their new freedom Saturday by forming a 100-mile human
chain to protest a hydroelectric dam project on the Danube River,
the government news agency said.
   The CTK news agency said 100,000 people from Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and Austria formed the chain across territory in all three
nations.
   Meanwhile, thousands of West Germans and Czechoslovak citizens
formed a 2.5-mile human chain across their common border in a
gesture of triumph over the waning divisions between East and West,
CTK said.
   Tens of thousands of them passed through the border crossing
where the chain was formed, drawing attention to the ``absurdity of
the Iron Curtain,'' CTK said.
   Hard-line Communist regimes have been replaced by reformist
governments in Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the past two years
that have opened their borders with the West. While much of Eastern
Europe's ``Iron Curtain'' has been torn down, the continent remains
divided by the NATO and Warsaw Pact military alliances.
   Among those taking part was Czechoslovakia's foreign minister,
former dissident Jiri Dienstbier. He was quoted as saying that a
joint commmission to discuss the opening of new border crossings
between the two countries would meet next week.
   In the hydroelectric dam protest, CTK said that up to 100,000
people helped form a human chain along the Danube over a span of
about 100 miles from the town of Hainburg in Austria, across to
Bratislava in Czechoslovakia and to Komarom in Hungary.
   Hungary's Parliament already voted to scrap its part of the
joint dam project with Czechoslovakia, and the new Prague
leadership has said it will review the environmental consequences
of its part of the power plant at Gabcikovo.
   Activists read aloud a letter addressed to Czechoslovak
President Vaclav Havel, requesting his support for the demands that
the project be stopped, MTI reported. Participants also called for
Austria, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to create a nature reserve
along the Danube, MTI said.
   In the Hungarian town of Visegrad, Andras Szekfue of the
Hungarian Green Party told about 100 people that since the
Hungarian part of the project at Nagymaros had been scrapped, they
must help the Czechoslovaks stop the dam at Gabcikovo, a
participant told The Associated Press.
   
   Referring to the democratic revolutions that have swept the East
bloc, Szekfue added: ``The good thing is that we no longer need to
work in secret but can pursue our aims with democratic means.''
   In the Hungarian city of Esztergom, activist Csaba Paska noted,
``the Danube links the people (of the three countries), and this
dam which divides us was the work of politicians.''
   Among placards and banners carried by protesters was one
reading, ``Build bridges, not dams.''
   Austrian and Hungarian environmentalists had long opposed the
mammoth project, maintaining it would destroy unique wildlife and
have other irreparable consequences for the Danube.
   The project was agreed on by the Communist governments in Prague
and Budapest in the 1970s. Austria had agreed to finance part of
the Hungarian project in exchange for electricity.
   The chain across the West German-Czechoslovak border was formed
between the Czechoslovak town of Zlezna Ruda and the West German
border town of Bayrisch Eisenstein, about 100 miles northeast of
Munich.
