<F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by </F>
correspondent Zuzana Stukovska; date and place not 
given--recorded] 
  [Text] [Stukovska] To attain a political compromise, 
European Union [EU] experts have recommended to Slovakia an 
increase in the average inflow into the old Danube River bed at 
the Gabcikovo Dam to 800 cubic meters a second. Is this 
proposal acceptable to the Slovak Government? 
  [Kukan] The EU commission's recommendation to increase the 
inflow in the old Danube River bed to 800 cubic meters a second 
is a proposal for a political solution that is not acceptable to 
the Slovak Government. We think there are a sufficient number 
of other technical measures to attain the aim put forward by 
Hungary; we are also interested in achieving an agreement on 
this. We are presenting these technical proposals and would 
like to discuss them. 
  We would like to explain to the EU that our approach to this 
issue is serious. However, its expert group's recommendation--it 
gave us a number of proposals and all were acceptable to us 
except this one, which seems to us to be a political 
solution--we reject, and we reject any political pressure to 
have it accepted. 
  [Stukovska] Obviously there will be talks with Hungary. At 
which level should they be conducted? 
  [Kukan] We are interested in continuing the talks on 
temporary water management with Hungary. You, however, know the 
current situation in Hungary: A new government is being 
constituted, a new parliament has been elected. We have certain 
positive signs that the Hungarian position might be changing. I 
am a realist and will wait and see what happens. We are having 
continuous diplomatic correspondence with the Hungarian Foreign 
Ministry. To answer your question, These talks will be 
technical talks between experts dealing with the issues linked 
to temporary water management. 
  [Stukovska] Can you tell us, at least approximately, when 
they might be held? 
  [Kukan] It depends on when a new government is formed in 
Hungary.
