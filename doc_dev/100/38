Hungary has called for a special meeting of the eight-nation Danube
Commission to discuss Slovakia's plans to divert the river across its
territory this month, a commission official said yesterday. The Danube forms
part of the two states' common border, Reuter reports from Budapest.
The move is part of Hungary's efforts to prevent the creation of a
billion-dollar hydroelectric scheme, which Budapest says would cause an
environmental catastrophe and violate Hungary's territorial integrity.
Slovakia, which will quit the Czechoslovakian federation early next year, is
due to divert the Danube on October 20 to drive its Gabcikovo hydroelectric
power station.
