  [Text] Bratislava May 30 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Jozef 
Moravcik said today he expected the Hungarian socialists of 
Gyula Horn, who have won the parliamentary elections, to pursue 
a pragmatic policy, which could produce a relatively quick 
settlement of pending problems between Bratislava and Budapest. 
Moravcik met Horn during his visit to Bratislava before the 
elections. 
  Nevertheless Moravcik, who was optimistic about chances of a 
Slovak-Hungarian dialogue when he came to power in mid-March, 
said he did not expect a basic inter-state treaty to be 
concluded before the parliamentary elections which will end his 
cabinet's term. Early elections are to be held on September 30 
and October 1. 
  "It cannot be expected that the whole process of 
preparation, 
conclusion, signing and ratification of the basic treaty of good 
neighbourly relations could be managed within such a short time 
span. This is technically entirely ruled out, but we can take 
important steps to this effect," Moravcik said. 
  Bratislava hopes the treaty will confirm the existing border 
between Slovakia and Hungary, which were set by international 
conferences following World War One and which have been 
challenged by certain forces in Hungary. 
  Budapest on the other hand hopes for an extension of the 
rights of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia. Some 
560,000 ethnic Hungarians live Slovakia, constituting about 11 
percent of its total population. 
  The two countries are also facing other pending problems, 
such as the a dispute over the Gabcikovo hydroproject on the 
Danube, discords over the temporary division of the Danube 
waters, non-existence of a readmission agreement and the opening 
of new border crossings which Slovakia conditions by the 
conclusion of the readmission agreement.
