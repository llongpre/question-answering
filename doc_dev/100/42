  [Abstract] The keynote address to the 19th International 
Congress of the International Danube Limnology Association (MAD) 
held in Kiev on 15-21 Sep. 91 is reviewed. Ten reports submitted 
to the ``Radiology'' section, seven of which are directly 
related to studying the consequences of the Chernobyl nuclear 
power plant accident and the other three are dealing with the 
radionuclide migration between the aqueous medium and bottom 
sediments, geological and hydrogeological structures of the 
earth surface and its vegetation, the effect of radiation on 
humans, etc., are summarized. In particular, the process of 
radioactive cloud formation due to the release of short- and 
long-lived radionuclides from the depressurized reactor is 
tentatively divided into four phases. All reports by scientists 
from four Danube nations presented to the section address the 
water ecosystem conditions of the Danube basin; emphasis is 
placed on the radioecological conditions which have formed in 
the basin of the largest European river contaminated by the 
Chernobyl catastrophe. The daily radioactive substance discharge 
into the atmosphere in the first days after the accident, the 
radionuclide composition of these discharges, the cesium and 
strontium accumulation coefficients in some ecosystem 
components, and the [.sup]90[/]Sr and [.sup]137[/]Cs 
concentration in the Danube water are summarized, and the 
radioactive fallout pattern during the early days after the 
accident is plotted. It is noted that despite its scope, the 
review is not intended to address all aspects of the problem of 
radionuclide spread through the Danube and Dnepr ecosystem and 
is merely aimed at presenting the principal findings and 
conclusions. Figures 1; tables 4; references 13: 2 Russian, 11
