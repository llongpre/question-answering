<HEAD>Hungarians Vote to Pull Out of Controversial Danube Dam Project</HEAD>

   A government body voted Friday to pull
out of a controversial Danube River dam project it said is ``a
symbol of Hungary's mismanaged economic development,'' the official
news agency reported.
   The decision came in the form of a proposal by an advisory body
of the Council of Ministers, but it serves as a strong indication
the government and Communist Party leadership will scrap the
project.
   This will delight environmentalists, who have said the Nagymaros
dam scheme will destroy wetlands and their unique wildlife, and
probably will anger Czecholovakia, which already has spent $1.1
billion on a companion project.
   The council of economists, lawyers and other experts rejected
the idea of putting the project to a public vote, as suggested in a
petition signed by 140,000 Hungarians, the MTI news agency said.
   ``The body has stated categorically that no referendum should be
held on the matter,'' it reported. ``In these complex questions of
engineering, economy and international law, responsibility must not
be passed on to Hungary's citizens.''
   The multimillion-dollar project to build dams and power stations
at Nagymaros, 30 miles upstream from Budapest, and at Gabcikovo in
Czechoslovakia was drawn up a decade ago with the intent of
boosting electrical power for both communist nations and making the
Danube more navigable.
   Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth told reporters earlier this week
that the project stood a 50-50 chance of being scrapped because it
has ``become a symbol of a long-outdated economic model.''
   Czechoslovakia's investment in Gabcikovo, 40 miles east of
Bratislava, may never be properly realized as experts say the
projects are too interrelated for the Gabcikovo dam to be fully
effective without construction of the Nagymaros segment.
   MTI said the advisory council ``believes that certain
controversial issues are bound to occur even between friendly or
allied states.''
   But the state agency said it expected no damage to relations
between Budapest and Prague unless ``someone were to abuse the
termination of the project for this purpose.''
   It quoted the government council as saying the project ``was
misguided and badly handled all around.''
   ``Terminating the project would not bring about an adequate
situation either, but this was the only alternative for the
country,'' MTI concluded.
   The agency said there was only one dissenting vote in the
council, but it did not say how many people serve on it.
