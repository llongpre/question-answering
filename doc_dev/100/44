  [Text] Budapest, 22 March (MTI) -- "The event of the day 
is in the parliament," Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman 
told the press on Tuesday [22 March], referring to the Tuesday 
morning plenary session on Hungary's application for membership 
of the European Union. 
  In view of the defective Gabcikovo sluice chambers, the 
Hungarian Government has called on countries which insist on the 
principle of free navigation on the Danube, which conduct 
shipping traffic on the river, and which signed the 1948 
Belgrade Convention on the Order of Navigation, to warn the 
Slovak Government to immediately stop the law-breaking action 
and ensure free passage, Herman said. He drew attention to the 
Slovak Government's responsibility for the cessation of shipping 
on the Danube due to a technical and professional error. 
  After the first sluice chamber accident, the Hungarian 
Government warned the Slovak Government of the possibility of 
the second chamber going wrong, and asked it to do its best to 
make the given river section navigable. There was no Slovak 
response to this request, Herman said. 
  Answering a question, the spokesman said that the building 
of 
version "C," and thus the recent accident, was to be blamed on 
former Slovak Governments, while Hungary would welcome possible 
negotiations with the new Slovak cabinet on boosting bilateral 
links. 
  Herman reported fair progress in preparations for a 
"supervisory" conference of the 1992 Helsinki Conference on 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, to be held in Budapest's 
Convention Center from October 10 to December 2, and subsequent 
summit meetings from December 5-6. 
  He finally announced the March 24 visit to Hungary of Peter 
Tarnoff, deputy undersecretary of state in charge of East 
European affairs at the U.S. State Department, who will study 
the region's situation and discuss NATO's Partnership for Peace.
