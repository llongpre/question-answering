   Parliament decided Tuesday to let the
people decide how and when to elect a president, and approved plans
to scale down a joint Danube River dam project despite
Czechoslovakia's objections.
   A motion to hold the election plebiscite Nov. 26 was approved by
a vote of 294-7 in the 380-seat legislature. A proposal fixing Jan.
7 for a direct presidential election, assuming that is the choice,
was approved 303-6.
   Hungary's ruling Communist Party, before its transformation Oct.
7 into a new Socialist Party, agreed with several new opposition
groups to choose the president by popular vote before parliamentary
elections planned for next year.
   Two groups that want the president appointed by the new
Parliament collected more than 200,000 signatures on petitions
supporting that view, however, and the issue went to the
legislators.
   While they profess democratic ideals, the Socialists will remain
in power at least until the parliamentary elections. The
petitioning organizations contended a popular election for
president would favor the Socialists because of their hold on power.
   The decision on the Danube power project came five months after
Hungary declared a moratorium on construction because of mounting
costs and fears of environmental damage, including pollution of
Budapest's drinking water.
   Czechoslovakia, a conservative Warsaw Pact ally already unhappy
about Hungary's rapid move toward a multiparty democracy, was
angered by the suspension and the vote Tuesday was expected to make
matters worse.
   Premier Miklos Nemeth urged Parliament to authorize new
negotiations with Czechoslovakia, and acknowledged indirectly that
the project had become a difficult political issue.
   He added, however: ``Can there be a greater political question
than protection of the human environment, the responsiblity to the
living conditions of future generations?''
   Only 189 members approved renegotiating terms of the
hydroelectric project, but they were a majority because of absences
and abstentions.
   A 1977 agreement with Czechoslovakia, Hungary's northern
neighbor, foresees diverting stretches of the Danube and creating a
huge reservoir east of Bratislava, capital of Slovakia, as part of
a complex straddling the border.
   Several joint negotiating sessions since the Hungarian
suspension have failed. In its latest rejection of Hungarian
efforts to reduce the scope of the $3 billion undertaking,
Czechoslovakia sent a diplomatic note Monday demanding compensation
and threatening to divert the river on its own.
   Hungary contends such a diversion would violate international
and bilateral agreements governing border rivers and has
threatened, in its turn, to seek international arbitration.
