SLOVAKIA'S plan to block and divert the Danube river into the Gabcikovo
power plant is causing strains within the joint campaign by Hungary, Poland
and the Czech and Slovak republics to join the European Community.
Although all sides are trying to play down the impact of the
Hungarian-Slovak row, Mr Gyorgy Granastzoi, Hungary's ambassador to the EC,
warned yesterday that any move to divert the Danube would be a 'violation'
of Hungary's borders.
Mr Granastzoi was speaking at a joint news conference by the three east
European countries which made public an 11-page memorandum to the EC aimed
at strengthening the integration of the former communist countries into the
Community.
The EC has described as 'catastrophic' the dispute between Slovakia and
Hungary. Tripartite talks under the auspices of the EC took place in
Brussels yesterday in an effort to defuse the row and allow technical
experts to consider the effects of the planned dam project on the
environment.
The EC has agreed to mediate on condition that the talks are technical
rather than political; and that Slovakia does not carry out any work on the
project which is irreversible.
The prime ministers of the three east European countries are due to meet Mr
John Major, UK prime minister, and Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission
president, in London next week to press their case for starting negotiations
on EC accession no later than in 1996.
So far the EC has reacted coolly because the huge economic disparities. A
full response to the joint memorandum is not expected until the EC summit in
Edinburgh in December.
