  [Text] Bratislava, Feb 8 (CTK) -- Slovak Prime Minister 
Vladimir Meciar will sign a general document on NATO's 
Partnership for Peace plan in Brussels on Wednesday [9 
February], Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik confirmed today. 
  Moravcik also reported that the government approved a bill 
on 
the principles of the provisional water management regime at the 
Danube hydroelectric power station at Gabcikovo-Nagymaros, on 
the Slovak- Hungarian border. The bill is based on reports 
compiled by an expert group from the European Union (EU) 
commission and the two states involved in construction, Slovakia 
and Hungary. He said the government favors the provisional 
water management regime, as the Slovak section of the commission 
recommended. 
  Slovakia proposes that, at the beginning of the vegetation 
phase, the Danube branch be flooded while the current flow in 
the old riverbed is preserved, he said. 
  Moravcik stressed Slovakia fully respected Hungarian fears 
that too little water would be left in the Danube on Hungarian 
territory and would implement concrete measures to prevent this 
from happening. He added that in approving the bill the Slovak 
Government was making no comment on the original 1977 agreement 
on the construction of the dam and that any agreement on the 
water management regime would be valid only until the 
International Court of Justice at The Hague, which is to settle 
the dispute between Slovakia and Hungary, delivers its judgment.
