<F P=106> [Report by Heorhiy Vorotnyuk from Odessa: "A New Competitor </F>
on the Danube?"] 
  [Text] According to the Moldovan mass media, the 
government of that country does everything possible to promote 
the creation of its own merchant fleet on the Danube. For that 
purpose, not only are negotiations conducted with the CIS 
countries on the fair division of the former Union's fleet, but 
possibilities are also sought to purchase, build, and charter 
vessels. A shipping company -- "Moldova Shipping Company" -- 
was recently created there. It already has seven vessels at its 
disposal: three passenger ships, three freight vessels, and a 
barge. All of them have been chartered from Romanian ship 
owners and are, for the time being, kept in the Romanian port of 
Constanta. However, in the near future, our neighbors will 
start building a port on the Danube, where the Moldovan 
territory is adjacent to the river. 
  It looks like the Ukrainian Danube Shipping Company will 
have 
yet another competitor. At any rate, it will take care of the 
cargo from Moldova itself.
