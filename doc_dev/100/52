HUNGARY yesterday attacked a Slovak plan to divert the Danube river,
accusing it of breaking international law, after talks about the
controversial hydro-electric project broke up in disagreement, writes
Nicholas Denton in Budapest.
Slovakia appeared determined to continue with the Bos-Nagymaros project,
despite Hungary's opposition. Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovakian prime
minister, even made a veiled threat to complete construction within
Slovakia's own territory, according to Hungarian officials.
'It would infringe the integrity of Hungarian territory,' an official said
of a Slovak scheme to divert the Danube.
Mr Meciar refused to rule it out as one way of circumventing Hungarian
opposition. 'Slovakia will not give up its intention to continue
construction,' he said.
