   Hungarian radio on Saturday reported
for the first time a protest by environmentalists, who gathered in
downtown Budapest to demonstrate against construction of a Danube
River power project.
   Such protests, which are not officially sanctioned, have taken
place before but have not been reported by the state-run media in
this Soviet bloc country.
   About 2,000 people assembled Friday and marched to the Austrian
Embassy to protest construction of the power plant near Nagymaros
on the Danube.
   The Nagymaros project is being developed in conjunction with a
similar plant at Gabcikovo across the border in Czechoslovakia.
   Austrian and Hungarian environmentalists and biologists have
warned that the two systems threaten drinking water reserves for
millions of Hungarians and destroy a large area of riverside
forestland, which serves as a wildlife habitat.
   Under an Austrian-Hungarian contract signed May 29, 1986, 70
percent of the $483 million construction work will be carried out
by an Austrian state-run electricity concern.
   A Danube power project near Hainburg east of Vienna was
discontinued by the Austrian government after police clubbed
protesters who marched to prevent the chopping down of trees on the
construction site.
