   About 600 people Monday rallied at the
Environmental Ministry to protest a power plant on the Danube River
that critics say will destroy unique wildlife and threaten water
supplies.
   The protest was held two days before parliament was likely to
reopen debate on the issue.
   At least 120,000 Hungarians opposed to building the Nagymaros
power plant on the Danube River have signed a petition calling for a
referendum on the project, the government MTI news agency said.
   Laszlo Vit, a spokesman for Danube Circle, the main opposition
group to the dam, told demonstrators the petition was sent to
parliament and demanded the government publish costs of the dam
project.
   Representatives of Danube Circle launched their campaign in
November, a month after parliament decided to go ahead with the
project.
   The government, citing prior contractual obligations to
Czechoslovakia and Austria, has said construction will continue. A
halt would trigger huge penalty payments and a loss of prestige, the
government has said.
