  [Text] Bratislava, June 1 (CTK) -- Slovak Premier Josef 
Moravcik expressed his interest in meeting the new Hungarian 
government as soon as possible at a press conference today and 
said a "radical solution" to open questions between the two 
countries could be expected before Slovakia's autumn elections. 
General elections are to be held on September 30 and October 1. 
  He said he was satisfied that the Slovak-Hungarian 
readmission agreement -- Bratislava's condition for the opening 
of new border crossings -- was ready for signing. Slovakia was 
also ready to sign an agreement dividing the waters of the 
Danube between the canal to supply the Gabcikovo hydroelectric 
power station and the old course of the river. "The basic aim is 
to find a solution that will improve the environmental 
situation," he said, adding that "all the possibilities (exist) 
for achieving a solution." 
  The basic bilateral agreement on good neighborly relations 
"must contain a guarantee of the inviolability of the borders", 
which in Bratislava's view is a "condition without which 
confidence cannot be established," he said. 
  He said some Slovaks were concerned about the possibility 
the 
borders with Hungary would be changed, but personally he did not 
believe this was Hungary's intent. 
  Furthermore the agreement ought to safeguard minority rights 
to the extent required by international norms, he said. 
Slovakia insisted, however, on the rights of the individual and 
opposed the conferment of collective rights for the 
half-million-strong Hungarian minority. 
  Moravcik rejected the criticism recently leveled by Miklos 
Duray, chairman of the Hungarian minority movement Egyutteles 
that Moravcik's government was not honoring the pledges it made 
on acceding to the European charter on minority languages and 
community autonomy. He said cooperation with Hungarian minority 
parties was reflected in the government policy declaration. 
  "We are not bound to any other document," he said. Slovakia 
had refused to sign this pledge in the charter, and "Mr. Duray 
knows this".
