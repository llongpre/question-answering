UNITED Nations officials warned yesterday that the damaged dam in the
Yugoslav republic of Montenegro holding back millions of tons of toxic
sludge from pouring into the Danube river system remains highly dangerous.
Work began last Thursday to prevent further erosion of the gravel and shale
Mojkovac dam, which was on the verge of collapse after flash floods in
mid-October tore away concrete supports along its base. Mr Hans Zimmermann,
who is co-ordinating the emergency repair work at the UN disaster relief
agency in Geneva, said yesterday there had been no further deterioration in
the dam's condition. But, he added, 'the slightest additional rainfall would
aggravate the situation again'.
The preliminary toxicology report on the site, which contains an estimated
7m tons of poisonous sludge from a now-closed lead and zinc mine, says the
dump contains lead, zinc, copper, iron and sulphur compounds, as well as
traces of nickel, cadmium, arsenic and antimony. Analysts also found high
levels of zinc in the river Tara just below the dam. The fast-flowing Tara
runs via the Drina and Sava rivers into the Danube just above Belgrade.
The report, from the Cantonal Ecotoxicological Service of Geneva, says that
if the dam was breached the river would wash out the toxic elements from the
sludge, which has the consistency of sand, carrying them downstream.
In that event, it says, all plant and animal life along the rivers could be
poisoned, and people would have to be protected from contaminated food and
drinking water. Full tests on the 30kg of sludge analysts brought back to
Geneva from their inspection visit on November 15 are expected to take
another month.
Mr Zimmermann said yesterday that preliminary work on protecting the base of
the 12m-high dam from further erosion had been completed. Engineers are now
building three jetties upstream to lessen water pressure on the dam and
dredging a new channel in the river, to stop water eddying around its base.
