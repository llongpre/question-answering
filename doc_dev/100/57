   Czechoslovakia on Monday attacked
a decision by Hungary to halt a controversial joint dam project on
the Danube, branding it a ``one-sided'' attack on bilateral
agreements and international law.
   Hungary's decision Saturday to halt construction of its dam at
Nagymaros is the latest action to sour relations between the two
Warsaw Pact allies.
   The Slovak government, in a statement carried on the state news
agency CTK, said it was puzzled and surprised by the move,
especially because of what it said was a Hungarian drive to
accelerate work on the project under an agreement signed in
February.
   ``This is a one-sided step by the Hungarian government,'' the
statement said. ``Although it has full authority to decide things
on its territory, it contradicts the valid Czechoslovak-Hungarian
contract and international law.''
   The dam is part of a project agreed to in 1977 to build canals
and power stations off the Danube in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   Prague has invested $1.1 billion to date in its Gabcikovo dam
and power station, which is due to come on line this summer.
   Official criticism of the Hungarian decision to halt
construction and launch a two-month review of it followed an attack
in the Communist Party daily newspaper Rude Pravo.
   In recent months, the project had become ``an instrument for the
opposition forces to cast doubts on past decisions of the country's
leadership,'' Rude Pravo said.
   In this atmosphere, it added, it will be difficult for the
experts reviewing the Nagymaros project to be ``objective.''
   The Hungarian move highlights the contrasting politics in the
two nations.
   While opposition groups and political reform have gained
increasing hold in Hungary, Czechoslovakia's authorities have
rejected any role for unofficial organizations in its more cautious
restructuring.
   Relations soured visibly over Hungarian TV's unprecedented
broadcast last month of an interview with former Czechoslovak party
leader Alexander Dubcek, architect of the ``Prague Spring'' reforms
in 1968.
   The interview was Dubcek's first with official East bloc media
since he was expelled from the Czechoslovak Communist party in 1970
in the purge of almost half a million members by the current party
leader, Milos Jakes.
   Hungary ignored Czechoslovak protests about the first broadcast
with Dubcek in mid-April and transmitted a longer part of the
three-hour interview April 26.
   Journalist Andras Sugar, who conducted the interview, said in
Budapest last week he has received dozens of letters from Slovaks
who tuned in and approved of the broadcast.
   Hungarian Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz and Jakes played
down their political differences, emphasizing pragmatic
cooperation, when Grosz last visited Prague in mid-February.
   But the Nagymaros decision seems certain to cloud even economic
cooperation, while Czechoslovakia's decision to welcome Romanian
President Nicolae Ceausescu this week contrasts markedly with
recent Hungarian diplomacy.
   Hungary and Romania are locked in a fierce dispute over the fate
of the estimated 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania. Budapest
has made increasingly outspoken attacks on Ceausescu's tough
policies not just on ethnic issues, but on human rights in general.
