   Parliament adopted a government report
Friday recommending continuation of a controversial dam project on
the Danube River, following a heated eight-hour debate broadcast
live on Hungarian television.
   The vote to adopt was 317 for, 19 against, with 31 abstaining.
   Hungary is building the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power
plant and dam jointly with Czechoslovakia, with Austria financing
part of the Hungarian side of the project in return for electric
power.
   The project has run into heavy opposition in Hungary. Dozens of
independent environmental interest groups and others are demanding
construction be halted, claiming it will cause irreparable
ecological damage to wetland and wildlife along the Danube and
pollute large drinking water reserves.
   Environment Minister Laszlo Marothy argued Thursday that halting
the project would put a burden of $140 million to $200 milliion a
year on the economy until the mid-1990s. He said that would include
investing in substitute energy sources, restoring the landscape,
and compensation payments to Austria and Czechoslovakia.
   Officials estimated this year that the cost of completing the
dam would be about $1.08 billion while stopping construction would
cost about $1.1 billion. Environmentalists contend inflation will
push costs to $2.6 billion.
   Janos Szentagothai, former president of the Academy of Sciences,
on Friday told Parliament the academy adopted a unanimous decision
in 1983 proposing the government halt work on the project but this
was never made public.
   The deputies argued at length over conflicting motions _ one for
a roll-call vote and the other for a vote behind closed doors.
   Istvan Avar, a prominent actor and member of Parliament, broke
the deadlock finally by proposing that both groups withdraw their
motions and that the vote be taken by standing up.
   A roll-call vote is rare in Communist Hungary's legislature,
traditionally accustomed to giving rubber-stamp approval to
government decisions by a show of hands. The public wrangle was
another indication of the increasing openness in Hungary.
