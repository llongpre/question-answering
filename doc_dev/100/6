  [Text] Bratislava, March 22 (CTK) -- The investigation 
underway into the shipping accidents that have blocked two locks 
at the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros hydroelectric power project on the 
Danube has so far not revealed any evidence of external 
interference, according to a Slovak Government statement which 
CTK has obtained. 
  "Only the findings of the government commission working at 
the Gabcikovo water project will be authoritative," the 
government statement reads. 
  Economics Minister Peter Magvasi refused to speculate about 
the possibility that the accidents were caused by sabotage, 
saying the commission had to continue and complete their 
investigation. 
  The Slovak Government expressed regret today at its session 
that international passage on the Danube remained impossible 
because the right-hand lock at Gabcikovo was still blocked by 
the Ukrainian tugboat Zernograd which sank on February 11. The 
government announced it hoped river traffic could be resumed 
within a few days. 
  A section of the bottom gate of the left lock was damaged -- 
it is not known how -- on Sunday [20 March] night and the 
resultant wave under the dam damaged mechanisms on the bottom 
gate of the right lock. Subsequently international ship 
transport along this section of the Danube has been interrupted. 
  The Hungarian Foreign Ministry earlier issued a statement 
asserting that the Slovak Government bore full responsibility 
for the blockage and asked countries supporting free passage on 
the Danube to call on Slovakia to re-open the river.
