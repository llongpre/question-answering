<HEAD>U.S. Experts Enter Battle Over Disputed Dam</HEAD>

   Hungary has asked U.S. experts for help
in a controversial, multi-billion dollar hydroelectric dam project
on the Danube river, the official news agency MTI reported Friday.
   The news agency said the government is consulting San
Francisco-based Bechtel Group Inc. about the dam's operation and
the likely environmental consequences of its construction.
   The Gabcikovo-Nagymaros dam on the Hungarian-Czechoslovak border
has pitted the communist government against environmentalists who
say the project and its 140-mile rerouting of the Danube will flood
fertile farmland and destroy natural forests and wildlife.
   Hungarian and Austrian environmentalists oppose the project.
Czechoslovak scientists also questioned the environmental
consequences of the project.
   Construction began in early 1980s and a completion date has been
pushed back several times. Government officials hope to complete
the project by 1990.
   Seventy percent of the construction work in Hungary will be
carried out by Austrian companies in exchange for 15 years of
electricity for Austria from the finished project.
   The new openness evident in Hungary's state-run media and
politics in the past six weeks prompted unprecedented public
coverage of environmentalists' complaints about the planned dam and
raised questions about halting construction.
   Similar vast projects in the Soviet Union were halted in the
past two years as Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
increased openness brought more attention to environmental
questions and catastrophes.
   In June, parliamentarian Zoltan Kiraly proposed that work on the
project be suspended while a team of foreign experts evaluated its
economic efficiency.
   His proposal for suspension was rejected, but word that the
government plans to consult Bechtel Corp. indicated it is now
willing to bring in foreign experts.
   The government is to report to the Parliament on the project in
the fall.
   Officials maintain that stopping construction would cost about
$1.1 billion in payments to Austria, Czechoslovakia and Hungarian
companies for breach of contract.
   Officials estimate the cost of completing the dam at $1.08
billion. Environmentalists contend inflation will push costs to
$2.6 billion.
   MTI quoted Ervin Zsuffa, deputy minister of environment and
water management, as saying the Bechtel study should examine
environmental aspects of the project so that water and energy
management could be adjusted accordingly.
