   About 86,000 Hungarians opposed to the
construction of a Danube River power project have signed a petition
calling for a referendum on the plant, the state news agency MTI
reported Wednesday.
   President Bruno F. Straub said Tuesday night a referendum on the
plan was ``inconceivable,'' because parliament has decided to go
ahead with the project.
   Environmentalists, who say the plant will destroy wildlife,
wetlands and drinking water supplies, began the campaign in November
because they believed parliament's decision in October did not
reflect the will of the people.
   The session approved construction of the Nagymaros power plant,
which together with a hydropower station in Gabcikovo,
Czechoslovakia, is to be one of the biggest power generation plants
on the Danube.
   Environmentalists plan to present the proposal for a referendum
to Straub's Presidential Council or to parliament once they reach
100,000 signatures, the agency said.
   Straub ruled out a last-minute change in an interview on Budapest
TV, saying: ``Collecting signatures is a movement by young people
who want to use the chance to protest against something.''
