  [Text] Dunajska Streda, West Slovakia April 18 (CTK) -- 
"Relations between the Slovak Republic and Hungary must be 
deideologised and relieved of the unnecessary historic burden," 
Peter Weiss, chairman of the coalition Democratic Left Party 
(SDL), said today after his talks with Gyula Horn, chairman of 
the Hungarian Socialist Party. 
  Weiss said both countries accepted the idea of concluding a 
general agreement which would also enshrine the unchangeability 
of the border. 
  Horn said that before the agreement is signed, Slovakia must 
comply with the recommendations from the Council of Europe (CE) 
and solve the problems of bilingual names of communities and the 
way of writing Hungarian names. But he added that "the status 
of ethnic minorities in Slovakia is still better than in 
neighbour countries." 
  Turning to the controversial Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
hydroproject 
on the Danube, Weiss said he supported the completion of 
Nagymaros. He voiced the hope that a technical solution 
beneficial to both countries would be found. 
  Weiss said he was convinced that the problem would be solved 
so that neither side "lose face." 
  Horn said that the problem of Gabcikovo, the Slovak part of 
the hydroproject completed in 1993, must be depoliticised and 
that a commission composed of independent experts from both 
countries should be set up to propose a solution. 
  Hungary has been strongly criticising Gabcikovo, complaining 
that it has diverted water from its territory.
