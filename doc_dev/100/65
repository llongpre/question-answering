FT  25 SEP 92 / Canal unites great rivers of Europe: The North Sea and Black
Sea are linked amid trade hopes and environmental fears
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY an age-old European dream is to become a reality: a canal is to open
which will link the Rhine and Main rivers in the north of Europe to the
Danube in the south - thus connecting the North Sea and the Black Sea.
This was a dream of Charlemagne 1,200 years ago, and of subsequent Holy
Roman Emperors. With an appropriate sense of occasion, the opening will be
celebrated in grand style - but not without a note of discord.
For as some 2,000 guests assemble this morning in the Nuremberg
Meistersingers Hall for a musical celebration, the Bavarian Green Party is
hoping to field a demonstration of several hundred opponents on the square
outside.
And as the guests float down the canal later in the day in a flotilla of
boats to celebrate the formal opening in the presence of German President
Richard von Weizsacker and Mr Gunter Krause, the federal transport minister,
the aggrieved Greens will be following a similar route in their mini-buses,
with the view of staging a second demonstration later in the day.
Fans of the project, among the most prominent of whom is Bavarian President
Max Streibl, who will be hosting today's proceedings, say that the 171km
stretch of canal from Bamberg to Kelheim will do more than provide an
impetus to Bavaria's economy.
They talk in grand terms about a waterway, twice as long as the Panama canal
and longer than Suez, which will bring east and west closer together in
troubled times for Europe.
It has taken more than 30 years to build, at a cost of over DM6bn (Pounds
2.3bn). Building work was halted during Mr Helmut Schmidt's time as
chancellor, on the basis that the project was woefully uneconomic, and
revived again only after Mr Helmut Kohl came to power in 1982.
'A monument to godlessness,' is how one Bavarian pastor described the
project this week. Another critic, Mr Christian Magerl, Green party
spokesman on the environment in the Bavarian parliament, says that the canal
is a 'pure prestige object'.
He objects to the canal first on environmental grounds: it runs through what
used to be unspoilt countryside and it will alter the water-table, to the
detriment of Bavaria's flora and fauna.
Second, he believes that the canal is economic nonsense. 'It will compete
with the train system and not the Autobahns, which is stupid,' he says. 'And
the canal operators' expectations of 10m tonnes of cargo every year are
hopelessly ambitious.'
Mr Magerl believes that cargo will amount to no more than 3m tonnes a year -
a level at which the project will not even cover its running costs, he says.
While a wondrous thing, the new waterway is by no means as smooth and simple
as, say, the Rhine. For one thing, there are 59 locks on the Main and in the
canal, slowing traffic considerably. Also, the Danube flows faster than the
Rhine. A voyage from Linz to Rotterdam will probably take 10 or 11 days
compared with a guaranteed 42 hours by rail.
There are stretches of the Danube - in Germany below Regensburg, in Austria
above Vienna in the Wachau and along the Slovakian-Hungarian border - where
the water is occasionally too shallow for navigation. This rules out the
establishment of regular liner services and the use of the waterway for
just-in-time deliveries.
Clearances beneath some bridges on the Danube are so low that containers can
only be piled two-high. Rhine operators feel they need to pile containers
four-high to be profitable, and they are plying a much shorter, more densely
populated stretch of water than the Danube. Similarly, long strings of
barges can be put together on the Rhine, but not on the twisting Main or
through the new canal locks.
If these obstacles ensure that the amount of traffic going all the way from
Rotterdam to Romania will be limited, the canal seems certain to provide a
boost to Austro-German trade. The Austrians estimate that nearly half of the
traffic on the canal will be related to their country - either raw materials
coming from Rotterdam to the big steel and chemical plants at Linz or
industrial components and semi-finished products moving up to German
factories from Austria for final assembly.
Austrian officials expect the build-up of traffic on the waterway to be
gradual and to depend on a number of factors, such as reliability and how
the railways react to this new competition.
Hungary also hopes that the canal will boost trade with Germany, already the
country's largest trading partner. The Transport Ministry estimates that
traffic in Hungarian goods on the Danube, currently about 1.5-2m tonnes,
will rise by up to threefold.
As a condition, Hungary is pressing ahead with port renovation and an
entirely new facility at Gyor in the west of the country.
Hungary also sees the canal as insurance that the country will still be able
to import oil from Rotterdam even if the pipeline through the former Soviet
Union as well as that through Yugoslavia is cut off.
Meanwhile at Constanta, the ancient Black Sea port where the poet Ovid spent
his last days in miserable exile, the cranes stand idle.
Hopes are high in Romania that the opening of the canal will revive the
port, which handled only 28m tonnes of cargo last year, less than half 1989
levels, and strengthen the country's ties with the west.
Although Nicolae Ceausescu, the country's former dictator, spent more than
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) in the hope of making Constanta the world's third
largest port, and personally oversaw the building of a 65km canal to link it
to the Danube, the port still needs investment of some Dollars 200m to be
completed.
Worse, trade has fallen victim to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,
with the United Nations embargo on trade with Serbia likely to cost Romania
Dollars 3bn this year alone.
The only shipping now passing through Constanta on to the Danube each week
is two or three convoys of barges carrying raw materials to Romanian ports
such as Galati, the steel town.
