   A leak from a cement plant spread
an oil slick along a 12-mile stretch of the Danube River, police
said Tuesday.
   They said up to 2,100 gallons of heating oil leaked out of a
storage tank into a creek that joins the Danube near Allmendingen,
about 15 miles southwest of Ulm.
   Firefighters and cleanup teams erected eight oil traps along the
river to prevent the oil from entering water purification plants on
the Danube north of Ulm.
