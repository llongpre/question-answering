  [Text] Budapest, 17 March (MTI) -- "Hungary sees recent 
statements from Slovak Government circles positively both in 
content and tone, and is always keen to boost joint 
cooperation," said Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman on 
remarks by Slovakia's new Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik about 
closer links with Budapest. 
  Hungary would like to see rapid progress, following changes 
caused by the Gabcikovo hydroelectric dam in Slovakia, over 
sharing Danube water, which looks particularly urgent in light 
of the imminent growing period in Szigetkoz, when water is vital 
to plant growth. (While Hungary has already accepted the 
European Union's recommendation on water sharing, Slovakia has 
not yet done so.) 
  Also important to Budapest is the implementation of Council 
of Europe recommendations. (When Slovakia was admitted to the 
Council of Europe, it was asked to permit use of Hungarian town 
and village name-plates and registration of Hungarian family 
names.)
