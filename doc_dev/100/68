<HEAD>Seven Countries Tackle European Ecology Problems</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government experts met Monday to
pave the way for premiers from seven countries to tackle pressing
ecological problems.
   Deputy environmental ministers led delegations from
Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Austria, Poland, the Soviet Union, East
Germany and West Germany in discussion on the Czechoslovak
ecological initiative presented by Premier Ladislav Adamec in
December.
   He proposed a summit meeting in March, but standing ecological
disputes among these central European neighbors so far have
prevented action.
   Hungarian delegate Gyoergy Perczel proposed creating a joint
Czechoslovak-Austrian-Hungarian national park on Danube islands, in
an apparent move to oppose the controversial Gabcikovo-Nagymaros
hydroelectric project, a spokesman said.
   Hungarian ecologists oppose the Czechoslovak-Hungarian power
project on the Danube, and Budapest has said it may be the topic of
communist Hungary's first referendum.
