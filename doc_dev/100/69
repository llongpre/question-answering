  [Text] Bratislava, Jan 13 (CTK) -- Both Hungarian and 
Slovak premiers consider the so far attitudes to controversial 
problems of Slovak-Hungarian relations, including ethnic 
minorities and the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros water works on the 
Danube, to be irrational and damaging, Slovak Premier Vladimir 
Meciar said today. He said that he had agreed on this with his 
Hungarian counterpart, Peter Boross, at their meeting on 
Wednesday [12 January] in Prague. 
  Slovakia and Hungary should not impair each other in the 
present situation, Meciar said. Slovakia is willing to conclude 
a "major (interstate) treaty," to negotiate the creation of a 
customs union and the opening of several new border crossings, 
Meciar stated, stressing that essential decisions could be 
expected only after the forthcoming Hungarian parliamentary 
elections. 
  In accepting the Partnership for Peace project, the 
countries 
involved have also committed themselves to maintain democracy, 
observe human and minority rights, and honor current state 
borders, Meciar said. 
  Under documents it has adopted, Slovakia will guarantee its 
Hungarian minority the international standard of human rights, 
but will not tolerate any more pressure, Meciar emphasized. It 
is necessary to stop efforts to create autonomous bodies, change 
the political situation in some regions' administration, push 
for autonomy aimed at the spheres of finances and security, and 
"to prevent developments from escalating further," Meciar stated.
