  [Text] Bratislava, April 13 (CTK) -- A meeting between the 
Slovak and Hungarian environment ministers which included 
discussion of the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project ended without 
concrete results today. 
  On the controversial subject of the division of the Danube 
waters, Slovak Environment Minister Juraj Hrasko said he and his 
Hungarian counterpart Janos Gyurko had agreed to recommend that 
their governments prepare themselves to discuss the approval of 
a political decision. 
  "We did not bind ourselves to any conclusions. However, we 
both said the tone of the meeting was much friendlier than in 
the past," Hrasko said, adding that he was ready to continue 
negotiations with the aim of improving the state of the drying 
out branches of the Danube. 
  Hrasko confirmed that in the dispute over the dividing of 
the 
Danube waters between the old river course and the Gabcikovo 
canal he had proposed negotiations without the participation of 
experts from the European Union (EU), but declined to give 
further details. 
  Gyurko, however, rejected the offer of bilateral 
negotiations, thus sticking to Hungary's demand that talks take 
place with the participation of EU experts. However, he 
appreciated the change for the better in the atmosphere of the 
negotiations. If the Slovaks were to send more water into the 
old course than before -- and this would mean a fall in the 
output of electricity from Gabcikovo -- the Hungarians would 
support any request made of Slovakia by a third party for 
compensation for these losses. 
  "We were assured that no standpoint from the Hungarian 
Parliament or Government had to be definitive in the search for 
an agreement," said Hrasko, who used to be chairman of the 
parliamentary committee for Gabcikovo. 
  "A mare is never sold at a market for the asking price, but 
nor is the first offer paid," he added. 
  The compromise proposal by Western experts on the division 
of 
the Danube waters was approved conditionally by Hungary, but 
Slovakia rejected it. However, the Hungarian Parliament then 
went against the recommendations of both the experts and its own 
government, and decided that the drying out branch of the Danube 
would be supplied with water by pumps, not by the building of a 
dam. 
  Nonetheless, Hungary recently invited Slovakia to resume 
talks forthwith, to which Slovakia replied that it was still 
prepared to negotiate. 
  Hrasko said today's talks also concerned broader issues of 
cooperation in environmental protection and improving the 
quality of contacts between the two countries. Concretely, they 
discussed the creation of a joint national park on the border 
area and an agreement on a common approach to the pollution of 
waters.
