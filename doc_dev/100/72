  [Text] New York, June 22 (CTK) -- "It cannot be ruled out 
that ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar's Movement for a Democratic 
Slovakia will be the strongest party after the September 
parliamentary elections but it will not be able to form a 
government," Slovak President Michal Kovac said today. 
  He said forming a new government would evidently be a task 
for a coalition which would probably be made of the political 
parties constituting the current government. 
  At a joint news conference with Hungarian President Arpad 
Goncz here Kovac reiterated his support for the improved 
relations between Slovakia and Hungary which he said were not 
yet really good and neighborly. Kovac said that now, after the 
Hungarian parliamentary elections, new conditions are being 
created for general progress, including the progress in solving 
a dispute concerning the Gabcikovo hydroelectric project on the 
Danube. 
  Goncz confirmed that in this case technical questions are at 
issue but also political and national minority problems. He 
pointed out that Slovakia had not complied with recent 
recommendations by the European Union concerning the Gabcikovo 
dam.
