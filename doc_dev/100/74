Czechoslovakia and Hungary will make a last-ditch effort to resolve their
controversy over the Gabcikovo dam on the river Danube at next week's
European Community-Central Europe summit meeting in London, Anthony Robinson
writes.
The Slovak side has started to divert water prior to an agreement, but
claims this is necessary to prevent high river levels flooding the dam and
ancillary works on which over Dollars 1bn has been spent. The International
Court of Justice yesterday said that Hungary had asked it to help resolve
the row.
