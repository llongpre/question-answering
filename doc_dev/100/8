  [Text] Budapest, 8 March (MTI) -- The Hungarian 
representative in the Danube Commission recently forwarded a 
letter to representatives of the other member states, Hungarian 
Foreign Affairs Spokesman Janos Herman announced on Tuesday [8 
March]. 
  In the letter, the Hungarian Government, citing the February 
tragedy of the Ukrainian tugboat, reminded the member states of 
the Danube Commission that the Slovak Government, in serious 
violation of its international contractual obligations, 
rechanneled the Danube river flow in a 40-kilometer section from 
the river's natural bed, previously used for international 
shipping, and has thus prevented navigation on this section. 
  In order to fully enforce the safety and freedom of Danube 
shipping, the Hungarian Government considers it necessary for 
the Danube Commission to call on the Government of the Slovak 
Republic to continuously provide the necessary water amount in 
the natural bed of the Danube in order to restore the original 
conditions of navigation, as was previously demanded by the 
Hungarian side. 
  The Hungarian Government also deems it necessary for the 
Danube Commission to call on Bratislava to restore the official 
announcement system which has not been in force since the 
Gabcikovo facility was unilaterally placed into operation. 
Under the terms of the system, the Danube Commission, and 
through it the governments of the countries concerned, must 
immediately be informed of all circumstantial events -- for 
instance, the serious accident in February. 
  However, the Danube Commission has still not received any 
such notification concerning the Ukrainian boat accident. 
  The Hungarian Government has requested that the Commission 
place these issues on the discussion agenda for the session next 
month.
