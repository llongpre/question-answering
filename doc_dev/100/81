   Floodwaters swept away two people as
they cried for help from their submerged van Tuesday and thousands
along the swollen Danube River prepared to flee amid warnings more
dikes could break.
   The latest apparent drownings brought to six the number of dead
in Bavaria's worst flooding in 70 years.
   The Rhine River on Tuesday crested inches short of the top of a
flood wall protecting Cologne's historic Old Town. The Danube,
Mosel, and other major rivers already were receding, but
forecasters predicted more flood-threatening rain through Easter
weekend.
   Rescue workers were searching Tuesday for the Volkswagen van
with two people that witnesses said was swept away by the Main
river in the Bavarian city of Wuerzburg, where riverside streets
were flooded.
   Witnesses reported seeing the vehicle's headlights in the
floodwaters and hearing cries for help. But the van was gone by the
time rescuers arrived in boats.
   The Danube River has burst through dikes in several places since
Sunday, forcing 3,500 people to evacuate.
   Officials, meanwhile, worried about forecasts for more rain.
``We're not giving the all-clear signal yet,'' said Ruediger
Beiser, an official with the Office for Water and River Transport
in Mainz.
   Rhine floodwater covered nearby sidewalks and some streets in
Bonn, the federal capital. Residents of large villas lining the
river in the Bonn district, which house many embassies, were
preparing sandbags and using pumps to dry out their flooded cellars.
   In a section of Cologne's Old Town area, residents spent the
night building mortar-and-brick walls around their homes, clearing
out their basements, and placing elevated planks on their sidewalks.
   The Rhine rose to 32.3 feet at about 3 a.m. and stayed there,
dramtically stopping just short of the top of a 32{-foot flood wall.
   All the same, some water had seaped through the barrier and was
being pumped out of cellars.
   ``Unfortunately, the wall is not totally watertight,'' said
Eckehard Link, head of anti-flooding efforts for Cologne, a city of
1 million people.
