  [Text] Bratislava May 2 (CTK) -- Central Europe has long 
been burdened by the state of Slovak-Hungarian relations which 
are even perceived as an obstacle on its road towards the 
European Union and NATO, Democratic Left Party (SDL) Chairman 
Peter Weiss told CTK on Sunday. 
  Relations between Bratislava and Budapest have been 
characterised thus far by Slovakia's apprehensions concerning 
the unwillingness of Budapest to endorse the current 
Slovak-Hungarian borders officially in the as yet non-existent 
treaty between the two countries. Hungary's complaints about the 
position of the Hungarian ethnic minority in Slovakia, a dispute 
over the Gabcikovo hydroproject on the Danube and minor 
controversies over the unwillingness of Hungary to conclude a 
readmission agreement or open new border crossings are among 
other disputed issues, Weiss said. 
  "However, the problems between Hungary and Slovakia are not 
as dramatic as they are sometimes made out to be. We do not see 
the situation as a conflict," Weiss said. He accused the former 
Slovak Government of ex-Premier Vladimir Meciar and the current 
Hungarian cabinet of attempting to win points in the internal 
political scene "by excessively dramatising Hungarian-Slovak 
problems and putting the blame on each other." 
  "If the French and the Germans have managed to reconcile, 
then Hungarians and Slovaks can also come to terms," he said. 
Weiss pointed to the fact that the SDL and the Hungarian 
Socialist Party of Gyula Horn, a favourite of the forthcoming 
Hungarian elections, are ready to conclude a basic inter-state 
treaty guaranteeing the inviolability of the common border and 
rights to ethnic minorities in both countries. 
  Weiss stressed, however, that his will to historic 
reconciliation with Budapest has its limits -- all speculations 
about territorial autonomy for the Hungarian ethnic minority in 
Slovakia are unacceptable to us since they simply will not pass 
in Slovakia. 
  Regarding Slovakia's relations with the Czech Republic, 
Weiss 
said they required primarily a matter-of-fact approach. Weiss, 
who is considered a possible candidate for Slovak future 
premier, further said: 
  "We consider relations with the Czech Republic to be of a 
key 
importance. We want to proceed from all the positive steps 
achieved during the 74 years of our co-existence. Naturally the 
two countries are currently independent and have their own 
interests which they want to protect. But these interests 
should be pursued and protected on the basis of an expert and a 
matter-of-fact dialogue."
