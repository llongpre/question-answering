A Serbian ship, carrying oil, has again defied Romanian and Bulgarian
controls on the Danube and passed into Serbian waters breaking the UN
embargo, the Romanian Foreign Ministry said yesterday, writes Virginia Marsh
in Bucharest.
The Velebit was the third Serbian tugboat pushing barges of oil loaded in a
Ukrainian port of Reni, along the Danube, to break the embargo in the past
three days.
Romanian coastguards said Romanian and Bulgarian motor boats had circled the
Velebit for two hours yesterday but had backed off when the tug nearly
collided with one of their boats.
Two more tug boats, following not far behind, were last night also expected
to try to reach the Serbian port of Prahovo.
Despite continuing US pressure to stop the ships, Romania yesterday repeated
it was unwilling to take further action alone.
Romania was particularly concerned at the ecological consequences of any
conflict with the ships. The captain of one tugboat threatened to blow up or
discharge his cargo into the river, polluting the sole water supply of many
ports, rather than surrender.
