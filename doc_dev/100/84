BULGARIA detained a Romanian ship on suspicion of carrying up the Danube
River goods banned under a United Nations embargo against former Yugoslavia,
Reuter reports from Sofia.
The state news agency BTA reported that the Romanian ship Jariste 5, with
860 tonnes of iron, was detained by Bulgaria's river inspection authorities
at Vidin, 50km downstream from the Serbian border.
The ship was sailing upstream from the Romanian Danube port of Calarasi to
Turnu Severin, a Romanian port opposite Serbia, without UN sanctions
committee approval to take embargoed goods through the Serbian section of
the river.
Several embargo-busting Yugoslav tugboats towing barges laden with tens of
thousands of tonnes of petrol products eluded control by Bulgarian and
Romanian customs on the Danube and sailed into Serbian waters three months
ago.
The US Coast Guard gave Bulgaria three fast boats in response to requests
for help to enforce the embargo.
