   Floodwaters burst through dikes on the
Danube River and the Rhine River was rising fast today as hundred
of people were evacuated from their homes.
   Emergency workers were working to strengthen the earthen dikes
along the Danube. The Rhine was rising about an inch an hour in
some locations today, threatening homes and businesses in Cologne,
Bonn and other communities.
   Major rivers across West Germany have been flooding for about
two weeks but heavy rains over the weekend worsened the situation.
   The rising Rhine forced authorites to close parts of a highway
between Mainz and Koblenz and disrupted trains in the area.
   Officials said about 1,400 people were evacuated Sunday night
and early today after the Danube burst through several dikes near
Regensburg, about 45 miles north of Munich.
   Hundreds of cows, pigs and other farm animals were also taken to
higher ground to escape rising waters, authorities added.
   Hans Voggenreiter, spokesman for the rescue operation, said it
was the worst flooding in the area since 1920.
   ``People were evacuated with rowboats and powerboats,'' said
Voggenreiter. ``Most of them were taken in by relatives and
friends. The rest are being cared for in schools and public
auditoriums.''
   Floodwaters had also entered parts of Regensburg itself, as well
as sections of Passau, 80 miles to the east.
   Officials said flooding along the Neckar and Mosel rivers was
receding, but the Rhine continued to climb.
   Riverside sidewalks and some streets in Bonn, the federal
capital, had disappeared beneath the water.
   Residents of large villas that line the Rhine in the Bonn
district of Bad Godesberg, home to many embassies and ambassadors'
residents, were using pumps to dry out their flooded cellars.
   ``Groundwater is coming through (cellar) seams all over the
city,'' said an emergency official who asked not to be identified.
``But we're keeping our cool.''
