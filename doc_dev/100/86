   The environment minister said Thursday
that government failure to consult the public about a planned dam
project generated opposition to the project, but he still backed
construction of the dam.
   ``We can now see clearly that the absence of openness ... has
done a lot of damage,'' Laszlo Marothy said in Parliament of a
government report on the dam and hydroelectric power plant
communist Hungary and Czechoslovakia are building on the Danube.
   ``Leaving out of consideration indications of public opinion has
produced mistrust and in fact raised antipathy.''
   Dozens of parliamentarians have asked to speak on the report and
several are likely to vote against it. However, government
officials and parliamentarians say it will probably be adopted
Friday.
   The joint Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project has met considerable
opposition in Hungary and dozens of independent environmental and
other interest groups have publicly called for a halt in
construction.
   The groups claim it will cause irreparable ecological damage to
wetland and wildlife along the Danube and pollute large drinking
water reserves.
   Marothy, however, told Parliament the barrage system ``must be
built in keeping with the original concept.''
   ``The government must take responsibility for society as a
whole, even if the price of this is that it must act against the
opinions of some groups,'' Marothy said.
   Marothy argued the issue has become largely symbolic in Hungary
for other social problems.
   ``What has become superimposed on these disputes is the sum of
tensions, social problems and contradictions emerging, ...
including claims for remedying grievances that have nothing to do
with the dam,'' he said.
   On Sept. 12, about 20,000 people gathered in front of Parliament
to protest the project, calling for democracy, a multiparty system
and a referendum.
   Marothy rejected the conclusions of an ad hoc committee of the
Academy of Sciences which presented its findings to the government
Oct. 1, charging they were ``inaccurate.''
   The Academy report, as quoted by Marothy, said stopping or
delaying construction posed a ``realistic alternative'' and
postponing work could reduce economic burdens and entail fewer
environmental risks.
   He said a total cost to Hungary of finishing the project would
amount to about $700 million. Net revenue from the project by the
year 2015 would amount to the same, Marothy said.
   Austria is financing part of the Hungarian side of the project
in return for electric power.
   In another development, Hungary's foreign minister said at the
United Nations on Thursday that Romania, its Warsaw Pact ally, is
guilty of human rights violations, but said Moscow was not taking
sides in the Hungarian-Romanian dispute.
   The conflict revolves around Romania's ethnic Hungarian
minority, which Hungary says is being systematically mistreated in
a resettlement program.
   Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi avoided naming Romania in a
speech Tuesday to the General Assembly, limiting himself to
decrying ``cultural oppression'' of minorities in ``neighboring
countries.''
   But in an interview Thursday, he said: ``It is clear that our
problem in this regard is with Romania.''
