   The rain-swollen Danube River
burst through dikes along its banks in Bavaria Sunday, forcing the
evacuation of hundreds of people. Flooding throughout West Germany
has taken at least two lives.
   Water was up to a foot deep in Niederachdorf, a Bavarian hamlet
25 miles east of Regensburg.
   Radio reports said about 2,000 people were being evacuated from
Niederachdorf and other communities in that area.
   Officials said the Danube swept away sections of earthen dikes
15 feet high.
   Many rivers in West Germany, including the Rhine, Mosel, Donlau
and Neckar, are flooding from heavy rains and rapidly melting snow
in the Alps.
   A 61-year-old Coblenz man perished Sunday after going to his
flooded cellar to check the fuse box, police reported. They said he
received an electrical shock, fell into the water and drowned.
   On Saturday, a 3-year-old-boy in Bamberg drowned in flood
waters, according to police.
   Delegates at a Greens party convention in Ludwigshafen near
Heidelberg had to find another place to stay Saturday night when
water from the Rhine flowed through the youth hostel where they had
gathered.
   In Lower Saxony state, sections of 29 roads were under water
Sunday.
