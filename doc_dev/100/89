<F P=106> [Commentary by Karol Wolf: "Slovak Hungarians Are Looking </F>
Across the Danube"] 
  [Text] It is no secret that shifts on the Hungarian 
political scene tend to be carried over to the countries 
inhabited by Hungarian minorities. This holds even more true 
for Slovakia, with its politically differentiated Hungarian 
minority. 
  The electoral defeat suffered by the ruling Hungarian 
Democratic Forum [MDF] will find its expression in Slovakia in 
the loss of influence of Miklos Duray, chairman of the 
Coexistence movement, who directly participated in the MDF's 
election campaign. Both the chief of the victorious Socialists, 
Gyula Horn, and the leader of the Alliance of Free Democrats, 
Gabor Kuncze, do not conceal their distaste for Duray's 
positions. Horn even used the word "dummy" [hlupak] when 
referring to Duray during his last visit to Slovakia before the 
elections. 
  The second Hungarian political party in Slovakia, the 
Hungarian Christian Democratic Movement [MKDH], will probably 
retain its former standing after the change of power in Hungary 
and will continue to strive for the integration of all Hungarian 
ethnic parties. 
  The chances of the Hungarian Civic Party [MOS], which is not 
represented in the present parliament, have improved. It is a 
member of the Liberal International and a direct partner of the 
Alliance of Free Democrats [SZDSZ], which will probably 
participate in the new government in Budapest. Similar to the 
MKDH, the MOS pursues as its basic political goals the formation 
of a three-member [ethnic Hungarian] coalition and the weakening 
of the influence of Coexistence. 
  However, the Socialists' victory in Hungary offers yet 
another alternative concerning the political evolution of the 
Hungarian minority in Slovakia. It is no secret that the Party 
of the Democratic Left [SDL], which does not conceal its joy 
over the success of its colleagues on the other side of the 
Danube, has long been trying to gain broader support in the 
south of the country. Compared with other political parties, the 
SDL is purposefully building its structures there, and, today, 
when SDL Chairman Peter Weiss can boast of his friendship with 
Horn, its chances are growing bigger. The Hungarians in 
southern Slovakia wish calm and peace, which is exactly what the 
Weiss-Horn duo offers. 
  The political evolution of the Hungarian minority in 
Slovakia 
thus offers two alternatives. The propaganda of Horn's 
Socialists can help the SDL, which will most probably open its 
ticket for ethnic Hungarian candidates. The second alternative 
is that, with the MOS's entry into the Hungarian coalition, more 
liberal ideas will appear in the policy of this minority, and 
right-wing currents will come to prevail in it. In view of the 
permanently proreform attitudes demonstrated by Slovak 
Hungarians in sociological surveys, the second alternative is 
more likely. It needs to be said, however, that both 
alternatives bear in themselves the potential to introduce 
greater calm into the Slovak-Hungarian dialogue.
