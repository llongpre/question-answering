  [Text] Bratislava, March 18 (CTK) -- The Slovak Government 
today said it regretted Hungary's abuse of the accident of the 
Ukrainian tugboat Zernograd at Gabcikovo earlier this year for 
"dubious propaganda" against the Gabcikovo-Nagymaros 
hydroproject on the Danube. 
  A statement by the Slovak Foreign Ministry addressed to the 
members of the Danube Commission, received by CTK today, said 
that Hungary's representative to the Commission had accused 
Slovakia of failure to honor the official system of announcing 
emergency occurrences on the Danube. 
  According to preliminary information by Slovak authorities, 
the accident in the lock at Gabcikovo was due to man's failure 
as the captain grossly violated regulations guiding passage 
through the lock. 
  "The unequivocal conclusions stated by Hungary are evidently 
aimed at discrediting the reliability of the Gabcikovo 
hydroproject and its positive contribution to international 
navigation and to its safety," the statement says. 
  It points out without specification that Hungary's 
"unilateral" moves, that are at variance with its international 
commitments, raise serious obstacles to international navigation. 
  The statement also points out Hungary's effort "to get the 
Danube Commission entangled in the dispute between Slovakia and 
Hungary [over Gabcikovo] even though both parties have agreed to 
settle the dispute before the International Court of Justice in 
The Hague." 
  The statement also protests against the effort to include 
Gabcikovo in the agenda of the Danube Commission's 
deliberations. It stresses that at the next session of the 
Commission's relevant body, Slovakia will raise the question of 
"seeking solution to the unfavorable navigation conditions 
caused by the moves taken by Hungary." 
  Under agreement reached by Slovak and Ukrainian bodies the 
Zernograd will be removed from the lock on Saturday [19 March].
