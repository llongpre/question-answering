   A Bulgarian tanker hit a stone
quay, causing an oil leak that left a slick 1,000 yards long and 50
yards wide on the Danube River at Bratislava, the Czechoslovak news
agency reported Wednesday.
   The Bulgarian vessel, carrying heavy heating oil, hit the quay
after the tow rope broke Tuesday evening, the news agency CTK said.
   In another accident Wednesday, a second ship, the Austrian
Carrera II, ran aground and also began leaking oil, CTK said. The
ship had been on its way to Vienna from the port of Komarno, CTK
said.
