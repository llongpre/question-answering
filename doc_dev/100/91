SERBS yesterday lifted a week-long blockade of the River Danube which
stranded at least 22 ships in ports along the river and halted international
traffic.
The Romanian ministry of transport said 22 convoys, including ships from
Austria, Bulgaria, Holland, Hungary, Romania and Ukraine had been stranded
on either side of the barricades formed of barges near the Serb frontier
port of Prahovo. A further 24 vessels were waiting in Romanian Danube ports.
Serb harbour workers had strung 12 barges across a Serbian and Romanian
stretch of the river last Tuesday in retaliation for Romania's enforcement
of UN sanctions. The harbour workers had said they would not lift the
barricade until Romania allowed a Serbian ship loaded with 4,000 tonnes of
fuel oil to sail upstream to Belgrade.
Trade between the Black Sea countries and Europe has been severely disrupted
by the blockade. About 35 ships and 120 barges passed through the Iron Gates
lock, upstream from Prahovo, each week.
