Romania yesterday said it would not use force against four Serbian ships
travelling on the Danube towards Belgrade despite US calls on Romania and
Bulgaria to prevent the vessels from breaking United Nations sanctions,
writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
The Romanian Foreign Ministry said it feared that the use of force against
the ships, believed to be carrying more than 40,000 tonnes of oil, could
lead to an 'ecological disaster'.
Earlier this week a Serbian ship, also carrying oil, was allowed to pass
into Serbian waters after its captain threatened to blow up the vessel or
discharge its cargo into the Danube rather than surrender. The Danube delta
in north east Romania is home to thousands of rare birds and other
endangered species.
