BULGARIA is looking for foreign investors and partners to build its share of
two new bridges across the River Danube, officials said yesterday, Reuter
reports from Sofia.
Bulgaria and Romania plan to build the bridges across their Danube frontier
to ease a heavily congested route that links central Europe, several former
Soviet republics and the Middle East.
'We are inviting foreign bids for the construction of the bridges,' said Mr
Matey Donchev, technical director of Bulgaria's Danube bridges directorate.
Neither country had the money to construct the bridges and would have to
rely on investment from abroad.
Officials have estimated the cost of each bridge at Dollars 120m (Pounds
81m). They would be built over the next four years and customs posts will be
combined to save time.
Mr Donchev said Mitsubishi from Japan had shown interest in the project, as
had other companies from South Africa, Turkey and Austria.
Only one bridge links Bulgaria and Romania at present and it is severely
congested because of diverted traffic from the former Yugoslavia, wracked by
civil war.
It is planned that one road and rail bridge will link the Bulgarian river
port of Vidin with the Romanian town of Calafat, and the other will connect
Oryahovo on the Bulgarian side with and the Romanian town of Beket.
