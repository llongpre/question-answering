   Czechoslovakia said Tuesday it has
protested Hungary's decision to halt a joint hydroelectric project
on the Danube River, and it may demand compensation from Budapest.
   Rude Pravo, the Communist Party newspaper, said Foreign Minister
Jaromir Johanes summoned Hungarian Ambassador Miklos Barity on
Monday to receive the protest. The dispute is the latest indication
of declining relations between the Warsaw Pact allies.
   Gyula Horn, the Hungarian foreign minister, said Monday his
government would examine all environmental implications of the
joint project. Hungary ordered a halt Saturday on its part of the
Nagymaros dam.
   If previously ``unforeseeable ecological consequences'' are
found, Horn said, Hungary reserves the right to renegotiate the
agreement with Czechoslovakia.
   Opposition to the project has grown for months in Hungary, where
unofficial groups are gaining a bigger say in politics.
   Czechoslovakia has given no publicity to possible environmental
problems, which it says those were addressed before the project was
agreed upon in 1977.
   Its part of the project, a dam and power station at Gabcikovo,
40 miles east of Bratislava, is expected to be finished in July.
   Those installations have cost Czechoslovakia about $1.1 billion,
but will not be able to operate as planned without Nagymaros, which
is only about half finished.
   ``This one-sided step by the Hungarian government means a threat
to the whole objective,'' the government protest said.
   ``The decision by the Hungarian government was made without
negotiation. ... This violated the agreed procedure for solving
controversial issues. Therefore the Czechoslovak government insists
that construction should continue.''
   If the Nagymaros dam is not built, it said, Czechoslovakia may
demand compensation under provisions of the 1977 agreements.
   Horn's statement indicated, however, that Hungary would insist
on renegotiating the agreement rather than paying compensation
under the old one.
   Relations became touchy last month after Hungarian television
interviewed Alexander Dubcek, the Czechoslovak Communist Party
chief who led the ``Prague Spring'' liberalization of 1968, which
was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion.
   Hungary ignored Czechoslovak complaints about the first
installment and broadcast the second half of the three-hour
interview April 26.
   Official Soviet bloc media had not interviewed Dubcek since he
was expelled from the party in June 1970 in a purge of nearly half
a million members overseen by Milos Jakes, now the party leader.
   Another irritant is a scheduled visit to Czechoslovakia of
Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian president and party chief. Hungary
is critical of Ceausescu for his treatment of the ethnic Hungarian
minority in Romania and his alleged repression of human rights.
