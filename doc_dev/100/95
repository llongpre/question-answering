'THEY HAVE no lamps, they have nothing. There is just one screwdriver which
must be 50 years old. I told them they could send it to a museum,' says Mr
Jens Bakkensen, EC observer at the Hungarian river port of Mohacs.
The customs post itself has the air of a museum piece.
Baked in the unseasonally hot sun, it looks like nothing has happened in the
four centuries since an invading Turkish army destroyed the Hungarian king
and nobility at a battle near the spot in the 16th century.
In April, 200 shipments passed through, but the flow has almost dried up. In
the first few day of May, it has been reduced to one shipment a day.
With only one uniform each, customs officers on the Danube upstream of
Serbia prefer not to root around in holds to enforce western sanctions. The
EC's sanctions assistance mission is waiting for a truck from Britain to
deliver overalls and basic equipment.
In the meantime, the Hungarians are without work-clothes, torches, long rods
with which to prod piles of grain, and even screwdrivers.
Nor do the Hungarian authorities possess armed patrol boats.
What if a ship was determined to cross into Serbia and ignored the little
'stop' sign at the river bank? It has never yet happened, the Hungarians
answer.
Even so, the Hungarian government is reluctant to accept the West European
Union's offer of patrol boats.
Budapest is also dragging its heels on implementing the latest UN resolution
tightening up transit through Serbia.
Next door, on a riverside restaurant terrace, boatmen, customs officers and
EC monitors take a break to eat the local spicy fish soup and drink a glass
of wine or something stronger.
The same laid-back spirit infects customs inspections. Hungarian officers -
after a break for lunch - began to search the Zvezdnyy, the Ukrainian boat's
six attendant barges and the cargo of steel for the Mideast and Austrian
wheat for Uzbekistan.
On one of the Zvezdnyy's barges the Hungarians test whether rolls of steel
coil are genuine by picking up iron pellets left over from a previous trip,
dropping them against the giant cylinders below in the hold and listening to
the tone of the clang.
What sanctions violations have been discovered are exports from Serbia
rather than imports into the country. The Mohacs post found two barges full
of maize whose official provenance was Bosnia-Hercegovina but in fact was
Serbia. Serbia might need food, accepts Mr Bakkensen. 'But they also need
money.'
Although there is little evidence of smuggling, there can be no guarantees
that the border is sealed. Each barge can carry as many as 50 lorries and
each ship can push or pull as many as a dozen barges. The Zvezdnyy drove a
relatively modest number. Even so, the Hungarian customs entered only one of
the barges and broke into only one out of hundreds of cases of steel sheet
within it.
The sanctions enforcers could only have the reassurance of Mr Valentin
Trishin, the big-bellied Ukrainian captain of the Zvezdnyy. He gave a
gold-toothed beam, pointed down the Danube towards the border and the ruined
town of Vukovar beyond, and gestured: 'Serbia, straight through.'
