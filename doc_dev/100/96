<F P=106> [Julius Lorincz report on "recent" news conference in Vienna </F>
with Austrian President Thomas Klestil: "Our Region Has a 
Tremendous Future" -- first paragraph is editorial introduction] 
  [Text] Thomas Klestil, President of the Republic of 
Austria, recently received a group of Slovak reporters -- from 
NARODNA OBRODA, PRACA, SLOVENSKY DENNIK, UJ SZO, SLOBODNY PIATOK 
weekly, and PRAVDA. The reason for this meeting in his study at 
the Vienna Hofburg was the upcoming visit by the Slovak 
president to Austria. Although in the meantime domestic events 
in Slovakia resulted in a postponement of the visit, the 
frankness and stimulating nature of the discussion with Klestil 
undoubtedly warrant our passing on some of the ideas and views 
of the Austrian president. 
  By way of introduction, he pointed out that Austria has for 
decades endeavored to remove the Iron Curtain, to create the 
conditions for good neighborly relations despite the diversity 
of ideological views. "Austria was like a window, but the Iron 
Curtain is gone, and we are very close neighbors capable of 
extensive cooperation. There are no two capitals as close to 
one another as Vienna and Bratislava. Moreover, as I study our 
relations on a daily basis and in the long-term perspective, I 
believe that this region has a tremendous future. You know that 
at this time we are having problems concerning the transit of 
automobile transport through Austria, and we are also discussing 
it with the European Union. We have, however, the great option 
of transferring the transport not only to the railroad but also 
to the Danube River. After all, there is the Rhine-Main-Danube 
Channel, there soon may be also a Danube-Oder channel, and if 
some facilities are added, Vienna and Bratislava can become 
important reloading centers. There are great possibilities for 
an important power center to emerge in our region -- oil and gas 
pipelines from Russia pass through here, and the Adria oil 
pipeline. I am also thinking of cooperation between Vienna and 
Bratislava airports, of the entire infrastructure of the two 
great cities." 
  In the subsequent part of the discussion, Klestil pointed 
out 
that the "rosy picture" of the proximity of Vienna and 
Bratislava is not enough for Austrian-Slovak relations -- 
cooperation incorporates the situation of the two states in its 
entirety and, in this context, he acknowledged that Austria is 
the "number one" foreigner in founding joint firms and various 
forms of joint ventures in Slovakia. 
  A lot of the discussion was dedicated to Central Europe and 
relations in this part of the continent. According to Klestil, 
Slovakia, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia are 
interesting neighbors who are undergoing the transition to 
democratic states with a market economy: "Do you know that in 
the last few days, we have progressed on the road towards the 
European Union, and the firmer embedded we are there, the better 
we will be able to optimize your being our neighbors. We are in 
a certain sense merging again. No, I do not mean to be nostalgic 
about history -- I am a republican and a democrat -- but when I 
sit here in the room that once belonged to Josef II, and next to 
it is Maria Theresia's room -- it is only natural to perceive 
the bonds of Central Europe. The unnatural borders have 
disappeared, old possibilities have been revived and new 
possibilities of cooperation have been created." 
  The Austrian president continued in these reflections when 
the conversation turned to the meeting in Litomysl [eastern 
Bohemia] of the presidents of the Central European countries 
planned for April at the instigation of President Havel: "We 
should discuss there what Central Europe is, what our 
cooperation should be like, and political developments in this 
region. Yes, we should talk about the use of nuclear power, 
which is a very sensitive and aggravating issue for Austria. We 
have problems with the Czech Republic because of Temelin 
[nuclear power plant under construction], we are afraid of 
Jaslovske Bohunice and Mochovce [Slovak nuclear power plants]. 
You know, years ago, we decided in Austria -- I did not support 
this view then -- not to manufacture nuclear power. It must be 
understood that we expect Slovakia and other states to respect 
the population on the other side of the border -- a radioactive 
cloud such as Chernobyl's cannot be stopped by borders. Hence, 
the dangerous consequences of a conceivable nuclear accident has 
nothing to do with state sovereignty and borders." 
  The discussion also touched upon Austrian neutrality and 
its present meaning. Thomas Klestil said: "When I entered the 
presidential election campaign, I brought up the question of 
neutrality for a public discussion. Some of my advisers asked 
me then with consternation whether I was giving up hope of being 
elected. I declared, however, that neutrality is not a goal in 
itself, that it is a matter of security and guarantees. The 
security issue no longer has just a military dimension, it does 
not mean only protection against a military threat. In today's 
world, the threats have changed -- there are floods of refugees, 
migration flows, organized crime, drugs, nuclear accidents, and 
polluted environment. It was demonstrated that the public is 
ready for a down-to-earth discussion about these issues and is 
willing to accept a reasonable explanation. We succeeded in 
getting Austrians to accept Austria's joining the European Union 
in accordance with the law on neutrality. It states that we 
would not join any military grouping or agree to having foreign 
units enter our territory. So, Austria moves towards the 
European Union as a neutral state and it is not causing any 
problems here or in Brussels. I am glad it is so." 
  Klestil favorably commented on Slovakia joining the Council 
of Europe, and in this context he spoke also about the problems 
surrounding the Hungarian ethnic minority, about the anxiety in 
Slovakia resulting from a statement made once by the deceased 
Hungarian Prime Minister Jozsef Antall that he regards himself 
as the "spiritual prime minister of all 15 million Hungarians," 
i.e., including the more than 5 million Hungarians living 
abroad. He recommended that a reasonable basis be found for 
talks on these questions, that mistrust and concerns be 
gradually overcome, and said that it would be good to view these 
issues in a long-term perspective: "If we consider Europe 
democratic and liberal, borders in their present antiquated form 
have no meaning." We have observed that such a vision is nice 
and attractive but, unfortunately, at present we still keep 
encountering the tendency toward barriers, which is tied to the 
fears of an advanced and well-to-do Europe that millions of 
people will "sit on their travel bags" and contemplate whether 
it would not be best to leave their country in search of a more 
stable and better life. The Austrian president responded to 
this, among other things, with the following: 
  "The question of mass migration is a significant part of the 
threat presented by today's world. The prosperous countries of 
Europe must offer other countries the hope and prospects of a 
good future so that the local population decides to stay at 
home. Austria is helping refugees. Those coming from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina are a real problem for us -- there are 74,000 
of them in Austria officially. We have no idea how many are 
there illegally. Just in Vienna, 8,000 children from Bosnia are 
attending school. What to do about these people? Will they 
integrate into our society? 
  ``The West undoubtedly must offer more rapid and efficient 
help-- the best help seems to be efficient cooperation and 
investments -- to the countries that are passing through a 
complex transformation process, so that their citizens find 
meaning for their existence and future.''
