UNITED Nations sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro are now being
successfully enforced on the Danube, Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, said yesterday after visiting Romanian and Bulgarian river ports,
writes Virginia Marsh in Ruse, Bulgaria.
'The checks on documentation at different points do in effect prevent
illegal traffic. The riverside is greatly improved,' he said. However,
British officials travelling with Mr Hurd said the embargo was still not
tight enough at land crossings, especially in Macedonia.
Mr Hurd, who is on a four-day visit to the Balkans, said Britain would
provide three of the eight patrol boats which the Western European Union
agreed last month to deploy on the Danube in Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania.
The WEU aims to have the boats, as well as 300-400 police and customs
officials, monitoring the Danube by the end of the month.
