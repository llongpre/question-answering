<TEXT>  Fostoria, Ohio; A The dew point is the temperature at which moisture would
start to condense out of air if the air were cooled. The reason the moisture
condenses out is because warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air
can.;    Suppose you were in Florida in the summer, and the temperature was 80
degrees, with 91 percent humidity. That would mean the air had 91 percent of
the maximum amount of water vapor it could hold at 80 degrees. But if you took
that air and cooled it to 77 degrees, it would no longer be able to hold all
that moisture, and water would begin to condense out, according to San Jose
State University meteorologist Peter Lester. At 77 degrees, you would have
reached the dew point.;    On the other hand, if you were in the Arizona
desert on an 80-degree day, with 15 percent humidity, the dew point would be a
mere 28 degrees. You would have to chill that dry desert air to below freezing
before any water would condense out.;    Although the humidity varies with the
temperature, the dew point depends solely on the moisture content of the air.
For example, if you cooled that 80-degree desert air, its humidity would rise
steadily until it finally reached 100 percent at the dew point temperature of
28 degrees. But all those temperatures and humidities along the way would have
the same dew point -- 28 degrees -- as long as the amount of water in the air
didn't change.;    Meteorologists use the dew point as one of many indicators
of what kind of weather to expect. High dew points, for example, are good
predictors of thunderstorms. And if the dew point is not far below the air
temperature, that means fog is likely when the temperature drops at night.  </TEXT>
