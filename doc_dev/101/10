Pernod Ricard, the French drinks group, yesterday announced it would swap
one of its Irish whiskey brands for a Canadian whisky owned by Allied-Lyons
of the UK.
The French group said the exchange of Tullamore Dew for Royal Canadian would
allow it to expand its range of whiskies. It currently owns several Irish
whiskeys, including Jamesons and Bushmills; Scotch whiskies such as Abelour;
and a bourbon, Wild Turkey. However it does not have a Canadian whisky
brand.
The deal will also give Allied-Lyons its first Irish whiskey. 'It is a niche
premium brand which does well in international duty free,' said the UK
group. 'It is a good addition to our portfolio.'
The deal involves only the distribution of the whiskies. Pernod's
subsidiary, Irish Distillers, will continue to produce Tullamore Dew, while
Allied-Lyons will produce Royal Canadian. The Canadian whisky brand is
currently distributed by Hiram Walker, a subsidiary of the UK group.
Pernod said it would also receive payment for Tullamore Dew since it was
more profitable than Royal Canadian. However it declined to disclose the
amount.
Pernod's whisky business is its second-largest division, in terms of sales,
after its aperitif drink. The company said whisky was one of the fastest
growing segments of the French drinks market, although demand remained
depressed in international markets.
L'Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the French insurance group, announced
yesterday that the advisory banks for its privatisation were to be Banque
Lazard, Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Worms, Reuter reports from
Paris.
The UAP flotation is likely to go ahead after the sale of Elf Aquitaine,
scheduled for early 1994.
