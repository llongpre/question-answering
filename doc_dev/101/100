Usually it's the paint itself that gets the blame for paint problems on your 
home's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
But in most cases the cause lies elsewhere. Here are some common problems and 
ways to prevent them. 
</P>
<P>
Blistering is the earliest stage of peeling and is usually caused by moisture 
trapped under the new paint coat or by poor surface preparation. 
</P>
<P>
If it occurs within the first few weeks, it's probably caused by trapped 
moisture. While latex paint can usually be applied to damp surfaces without any 
problem, alkyd and other oil-based paints form a moisture barrier skin that 
traps the water inside. The water then turns to vapor and forms blisters. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid this, never paint with alkyds after a rainstorm, when the relative 
humidity is more than 85%; while dew is on the siding, or too soon after you've 
washed the old surface. Also, never paint when the temperature is more than 90 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
If the blisters appear after a month or so, the problem is probably poor 
surface preparation. If you washed the surface down with detergents, did you 
take the time to rinse completely? Unless such films are removed before 
painting, they can cause blistering. Also, glossy surfaces must be given a 
light sanding, so the new paint will grip well. 
</P>
<P>
Peeling is the curling of large pieces of dried paint and is merely a later 
manifestation of blistering. Severe peeling may also indicate use of a poor 
primer, or a heavy film of dirt, grease or dust. 
</P>
<P>
Prevention involves sanding or wiping the old finish with a deglossing liquid. 
Then follow the manufacturer's directions as to what primer may be required 
before applying the top coat of paint. 
</P>
<P>
Alligatoring is a cracking and flaking of the paint in a square pattern. It can 
result from applying paint over a previous coat that had a high gloss finish 
that was not sanded, use of the wrong primer or use of old paint, particularly 
paint that's been stored in an unheated space and allowed to freeze. 
</P>
<P>
To repair the condition, sand the surface smooth and apply the proper primer 
before applying a new top coat. 
</P>
<P>
Checking is a series of long lines, with shorter check marks crossing between, 
usually caused by the wood underneath expanding and contracting. This can be a 
problem with exposed plywood siding regardless of the kind of paint used. 
</P>
<P>
Sanding and then applying a new coat of wood primer will usually solve the 
problem. But if the new paint shows signs of coming loose, complete removal of 
the old paint is required. 
</P>
<P>
Wrinkling results in a crinkled surface that is caused by interfering with 
required drying time. Contributing factors are too-thick finish coat, building 
up of too many layers, undercoat that was not completely dry, wrong solvent or 
improperly stirred paint. Repair by sanding smooth and applying proper primer 
before painting top coat. 
</P>
<P>
Chalking or powdering characteristics are designed into some paints in order to 
keep the surface looking new. Chalking of old paint can interfere with proper 
bonding of a new coat, so scrub off as much as possible beforehand. In severe 
cases you may have to apply a bonding primer or sealer. 
</P>
<P>
Mildew manifests itself as patches of black spots. Though most exterior paints 
contain mildew-inhibiting ingredients, none work under all circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
Remove mildew by washing down the affected area with a bleach solution. Use 
one-third cup powdered laundry detergent, two-thirds cup of household cleaner 
containing trisodium phosphate, and one quart of household bleach. Wear long 
pants, a long-sleeved shirt, gloves, goggles and a respirator to avoid 
breathing the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
Stains that bleed through the paint are often the result of sap from knots in 
the wood seeping through the surface. But they also can be caused by rust from 
nails and hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Many discolorations bleed through coat after coat of paint, so repainting alone 
is not the answer. Instead, apply a primary coat of stain killer, such as 
pigmented shellac-base sealer, and then apply your paint.
