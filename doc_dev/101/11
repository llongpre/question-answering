<LEADPARA>  State Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy, a horse-racing buff, was excused for
official legislative business Thursday for an out-of-state trip that coincides
with this weekend's running of the Kentucky Derby.;    A Maddy spokesman, Carl
DeWing, denied knowing exactly where the Fresno lawmaker was and said only
that Maddy had been on "official business back East." DeWing referred other
questions to a Maddy aide who did not return telephone calls.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But two other legislators and a Senate staff member confirmed Maddy had
gone out of state to investigate horse racing issues and planned to be in
Kentucky for at least part of the trip. The Kentucky Derby, the nation's most
prestigious horse race, is Saturday at Churchill Downs in Louisville.;    Sen.
Bill Leonard, R-Upland, said he believed Maddy had gone to Pennsylvania to
study an innovative satellite racing system and planned to be in Kentucky over
the weekend.;    Maddy has attended the annual Kentucky Derby in past years.; 
  The excusal of Maddy for official business, which was approved by the Senate
Rules Committee, means he can continue to collect his legislative per diem
payments.;    Senate President Pro Tem David Roberti, D-Los Angeles, said he
didn't know if Maddy would actually claim the per diem money for all or part
of his trip. But Roberti said Maddy was not using other Senate funds to
finance his travels.;    DeWing said he was confident that Maddy would not
claim the expense money for any time he spent at the derby.;    Maddy missed a
long Senate floor session Thursday in which several senators had trouble
finding enough members to vote for their bills and motions.  </TEXT>
