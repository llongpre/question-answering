What are we to make of the government's decision to find a new public
relations and marketing adviser for the sale of its next tranche of BT
shares? With the reappointment of S G Warburg and Linklaters &amp; Paines, it
looked as if the government intended to use the same old team of advisers.
However, it has replaced Dewe Rogerson, the undoubted pr king of the
privatisation world, with Brunswick, a relative upstart in the business. It
seems that the Treasury simply wanted a change. But in the candyfloss world
of the pr merchants, it will be seen as a big blow for Dewe Rogerson.
