   ITT Corp. said it received a one-year, $100 million
contract to continue operation and maintenance of the Distant
Early Warning Line, a string of 10 radar system outposts in
the Arctic Circle.
   The DEW Line, in operation since 1957, provides tactical
warning against manned bomber and cruise missile threats. New
York-based ITT has managed the system since it was
established, except for a three-year period in the mid-1970s.

   The contract was awarded by the Air Force Tactical Air
Command at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to ITT Federal
Services Corp., part of the ITT Defense Inc. unit.
   An ITT spokesman noted that the existing DEW Line is
expected to be replaced with new technology in 1994, a
contract on which ITT expects to bid.
