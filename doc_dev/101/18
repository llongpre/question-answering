At least 168 gallons of oil fouled more than a mile of Bolsa Chica State Beach 
early Tuesday evening and investigators said leaking offshore oil rigs may be 
the source of the spill, U.S. Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Lt. Vincent Campos said an emergency cleanup crew hired by Unocal, 
which operates three offshore oil platforms in the area, was dispatched to the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very minor spill," Campos said. "We don't have anything from Fish and 
Game yet, but it may have involved a couple of birds." 
</P>
<P>
Bolsa Chica is located just north of the main stretch of Huntington Beach that 
was soiled when almost 400,000 gallons of crude oil spewed from the crippled 
tanker American Trader 1.3 miles offshore in February. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tuesday's spill was minor by comparison, it was enough to leave a mile 
and a quarter of the state beach covered with small patches of oil. Petty 
Officer Lindsay Dew said the heaviest patch was an eighth of a mile long, in 
some sections 12 to 15 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
Several Coast Guard officials estimated the total amount of oil spilled at four 
barrels, or 168 gallons, which they said can easily spread over large areas of 
ocean in a thin film. By late Tuesday, officials stressed the spill appeared to 
be minor. 
</P>
<P>
"We know of no animal life being affected," said Dew. "The oil has all washed 
up on shore. We don't believe there's any left in the water." 
</P>
<P>
State and federal wildlife officials were not immediately available for 
comment, but officials at the scene said only one duck had been found covered 
in oil. However, the grunion were supposed to run overnight and they too could 
be affected, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The California Department of Fish and Game also dispatched a team to take 
samples of the sand and to observe wildlife in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the source of the spill was not yet determined, Unocal decided to take 
responsibility for the cleanup. Company spokesman Barry Lane said the firm's 
emergency crews would work with shovels to remove the contaminated sand by the 
sackful. He said the company took on the job because "We operate in that area 
and we have people there." 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard spokesman said a 20-person cleanup crew from Long Beach-based 
Chempro, the same company that worked on the American Trader oil spill, would 
work through the night and could have the entire spill cleaned by early this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
Lane said the firm operates platforms Eva, Edith and Esther, all of which are 
between one and three miles off the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Shell Oil Co. also has platforms in the same area, the Coast Guard said. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's spill was discovered on the beach shortly after 6 p.m., officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach Mayor Thomas J. Mays said a Shell Oil helicopter spotted the 
slick before it hit the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really a shame we have to continue going through these problems," he 
said. "We've had minor problems with the platforms off the coast before, but I 
believe this is the first time the oil got to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
Unocal's Lane said his company reported a 10-gallon spill at Platform Eva to 
the Coast Guard on Monday night but he said that incident is believed to be 
unrelated to the oil that washed up on Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
"We sent a crew out at dawn looking for any oil on the water and couldn't find 
any," Lane said of the Monday night incident. He said a shield designed to trap 
oil had failed because of high winds, which sprayed the crude around the 
platform.
