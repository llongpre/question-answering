   THE FORM MUST CONFORM to inform, the GAO says of exempt groups' reports. 

   Over 300,000 exempt organizations file annual Form 990 reports so the IRS and the public can check uses and sources of funds. 
A House Government Operations panel asked the General Accounting Office to evaluate the completeness of the reports and IRS procedures for making them public. 
Now a GAO draft report based on a sample of 450 forms for 1986 estimates that 48% of 990s omit at least one schedule supplying details of such items as fund-raising, loans to and from officers, and mortgage debt. 

   Yet 95% of the reports with omissions are treated as complete under IRS criteria, and the IRS doesn't go after missing schedules, the GAO said. 
Its findings went to Rep. Barnard (D., Ga.), who expressed his concern. 
But he said the IRS plans to change its criteria and demand the missing schedules. 
As for providing 990s on request to the public, the GAO said the IRS can do it if given a group's exact name. 

   Although a 1987 law requires groups to open their 990s to public inspection, the GAO expects the IRS to continue to receive most requests for copies. 

   REMEMBER 1912, before the income tax arrived? 
These homeowners should. 

   Since 1865, a mutual company -- call it Ex-Tax -- owned by its 5,000 policyholders has sold homeowner's insurance for one refundable deposit. 
Example: A $2,400 deposit buys an $80,000 policy and may cost, in effect, only $144 a year in forgone after-tax interest income. 
But wait, asked the IRS, should that hypothetical interest income be imputed to policyholders and actually taxed? 
Now, in private ruling 8831004, it answers no -- for the time being. 

   When begun, long before the income tax was enacted in 1913, the plan wasn't a tax-avoidance scheme, and that isn't its aim now. 
The deposit doesn't constitute a taxable interest-free loan. 
But the IRS isn't ready to say whether there's a taxable "significant effect" on policyholders. 
Alan Hollander, a Boston tax lawyer, says the IRS is likely to begin imputing income to them when it finally issues related regulations. 

   COL. BLIMP SMILES, as Goodyear wins U.S. credits for British taxes. 

   Goodyear's U.K. subsidiary had a 1973 loss for U.K. tax purposes, because of deductions not allowed in the U.S. Carried back, the loss erased 1970-71 unit profits, so the unit got U.K. refunds. 
But Goodyear had taken 1970-71 foreign-tax credits in the U.S. for the unit. 
The IRS treated the unit's 1973 results as profit and denied Goodyear's 1970-71 credits, citing the refunds. 
Goodyear paid a $791,241 IRS claim, sued for a refund in the U.S. Claims Court -- and lost. 

   The credit formula includes a foreign unit's "accumulated profits." 
Goodyear's complex suit actually turned on whether U.S. law requires that sum to be computed under U.S. law, as the IRS and the Claims Court agreed, or applicable foreign law, as Goodyear argued. 
Now the federal-circuit appeals court has sided with Goodyear and held that foreign law must be applied. 
"It's a surprising conclusion," says Steven Hannes of Touche Ross &amp; Co., CPAs. 

   And while the ruling favors Goodyear now, Hannes says, it could work against companies in many other cases. 

   THAT LOST CHANCE to appeal a $102.3 million claim against the Bell companies looks more tragic to the IRS, which missed by a day its appeal deadline last month. 
It also hoped to defeat Indianapolis Power &amp; Light on the same issue in a prior appeal. 
But now the seventh-circuit appeals court has rejected that IRS plea. 

   A MATH FOOTNOTE and headache: For the first time, Emil Sunley of Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells, CPAs, says, IRS rules include a quadratic equation (with two solutions). 
It concerns allocations of corporate interest costs between the U.S. and abroad. 
The lower positive solution becomes "excess related-party indebtedness." 

   THE IRS WRONGLY SENT notices to an unknown number of people, asking why they haven't paid estimated taxes. 
The answer: They had credited refunds from their 1987 returns to cover estimated 1988 taxes. 
Taxpayers can clear up the notices with that explanation, the IRS says. 

   DAISY-CHAIN MAIL was no armor for this outpost of mail-order ministers. 

   Universal Life Church schemes have been rejected often in court, yet still they pop up. 
Now comes "a perfidious twist" on the usual individual scam, says Tax Court Judge Parker. 
James Edward Dew, a San Diego computer analyst, got a church charter by mail and took in 48 co-workers and friends, 25 of them "ordained," as members. 
Result: A "daisy chain" of "donors" who took charitable deductions for "gifts" and got back "parsonage allowances." 

   The group "simply exchanged checks in a transparent ploy to transmute their nondeductible personal . . . expenses into purported deductible charitable contributions," the judge found. 
The "well-educated" Dew, who appealed the IRS's disallowances, is the sole subject of the judge's opinion, which rejects 1980-81 deductions of $25,883 and imposes civil negligence penalties. 

   The judge also orders Dew to pay $5,000 in damages for pressing a frivolous case despite IRS warnings. 

   BRIEFS: Alimony arrearages of $10,550 for 1981-83 all are taxable when received in 1984, not spread over the prior years, the Tax Court tells Caroline M. Coleman of Lutherville, Md. . . . 
Corporate tax departments' frequent failure to have backup computer storage of data is "a potential time bomb," says Peat Marwick Main, CPAs.
