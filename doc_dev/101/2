   So what if two tiny, faraway rocks crumble or sink
into the Pacific? Japan might lose fishing and mining rights to
155,000 square miles of ocean, that's what, so it is spending about
$236 million to shore them up.
   The rocks called North Dew and East Dew, each barely large
enough for a person to sleep on, are Japan's southernmost points
and hold the key to treasure in this age of national
economic-control zones extending 200 miles from shore.
   Since April, about 200 workers using helicopters and
ship-mounted cranes have surrounded them with thousands of
four-pointed steel blocks, like anchors. The blocks form protective
circles 165 feet in diameter on a coral reef about 10 feet below
the surface 1,100 miles south of Tokyo.
   Haruo Aoki of the Construction Ministry's coastal department
said the work has cost 17 billion yen ($134 million) so far and
total is expected to be 30 billion yen. He said the circles will be
filled with concrete, beginning next year.
   At high tide, the rocks extend 3 to 10 feet above sea level. If
the tide should cover them, the reef no longer could be defined as
an island and Japan no longer could claim a 200-mile economic zone
around it.
   That means the nation's southermost point would move about 300
miles north, between the Volcano Islands on the east and the
Yaeyama Islands.
   North Dew and East Dew are about a mile apart on the reef, which
was an island called Parece Vela when it appeared on 17th century
Spanish navigation charts.
   The Japanese call it Okinotorishima (Remote Bird Island) and
official records say it was put under Tokyo's jurisdiction in 1931.
It is recognized as Japanese in the World War II peace treaty.
   Japan declared a 200-mile exclusive economic zone around the
reef in 1977, following the international trend to such areas of
control.
   Both rocks are shaped like mushrooms with thin stems attached to
the submerged reef, which is about three miles square. North Dew is
about 15{ feet in diameter and East Dew just over half that size.
   Agriculture Ministry figures say 2,577 tons of bonito, tuna and
other fish were caught in the 200-mile zone around them in 1985,
the last year for which figures are available. The catch was worth
$7 million at the current rate of exchange.
   No signs of oil have been reported but surveys are continuing to
determine whether mining of cobalt, nickel and other metals would
be feasible on the undersea mountain capped by the reef, said
Motohiko Kato of the International Trade and Industry Ministry's
National Resources and Energy Agency.
   The mountain rises 16,400 to 19,700 feet from the ocean floor.
   No estimate has been made of how much Japan would lose if the
rocks slipped below the surface and the area around Okinotorishima
became international, an Agriculture Ministry official said.
