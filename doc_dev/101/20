   Tony Conigliaro, whose brilliant baseball career
was cut short when he was hit in the face by a pitched ball at age
22, died Saturday of kidney failure. The former Boston Red Sox
outfielder was 45.
   Vinnie Martelli, Conigliaro's uncle, said Conigliaro died at
Salem Hospital in Salem, Mass. He entered the hospital Thursday,
and had been in poor health since suffering a heart attack in 1982.
   ``He's been in a bad way since the attack several years back,''
Martelli said. ``He never quite recovered.''
   His mother, Theresa Conigliaro, said Conigliaro required
constant care after his heart attack.
   ``We lost him after eight years. He's never really been back,''
Mrs. Conigliaro said Saturday. ``The only consolation is he didn't
know what he was going through.''
   Red Sox spokesman Dick Bresciani said, ``It was a very tragic
finish for Tony. The Red Sox are deeply saddened.''
   The man the fans called ``Tony C'' was, at age 22, the youngest
major league player to hit 100 career home runs.
   He was probably most widely known, however, for the beaning that
tragically cost him his career. On Aug. 18, 1967, during a game
with the California Angels, a pitch by Jack Hamilton hit Conigliaro
on the left side of the face, leaving him with a fractured
cheekbone, a dislocated jaw and blurred vision.
   The crowd fell silent at the sound of the pitch hitting
Conigliaro's face, recalled Dick Dew, who was a sportswriter
covering the game.
   ``It stopped everybody in the place because of the sound of it.
It was unmistakable,'' said Dew. ``You knew the injury was serious
the moment you heard it.''
   Conigliaro sat out the rest of the 1967 season, and all of 1968
with vision problems.
   But in the fall of 1968 he attempted a comeback as a pitcher in
the Florida Instructional League at age 23. His vision sharpened,
and the 1969 season found him back with the Red Sox in his familiar
right field position.
   At the end of the 1970 season, Conigliaro was traded to the
Angels after having belted 36 homers and driving in 116 runs, both
career highs.
   Citing recurring vision problems, he retired after half a season
with California the following year.
   In 1975, Conigliaro again attempted a comeback with Boston, but
it ended after 21 games.
   Johnny Pesky, a former Red Sox coach who managed the team when
Conigliaro joined the club in 1964, said, ``He was so good and you
could see it. You knew he was going to be a great player.
   ``It was a shame he got hurt when he did,'' Pesky said of the
pitching accident. ``With a few more years, he could have made the
Hall of Fame.''
   After the heart attack, Pesky said he visited Conigliaro several
times.
   ``When I went over to see Tony I'd end up crying,'' Pesky said.
``He was such a big, strong kid you would have never thought that
something like that could have happened.''
   Born in Revere, Mass. on Jan. 7, 1945, Conigliaro made a splash
as a rookie in 1964, when he hit 24 homers and batted .290, despite
missing six weeks with two broken bones and other injuries.
   A year later he led the American League with 32 homers. A wrist
fracture that sidelined him for 24 games kept him from hitting
more. Still, at age 20, he was the youngest major leaguer ever to
win a home run crown.
   His lifetime major league batting average was .264, with 516
runs and 166 home runs.
   After his baseball career ended at age 30, Conigliaro worked as
a sportscaster for television stations in Providence, R.I., and San
Francisco. He also worked for a sports agent's firm in Los Angeles,
and ran a health food store north of San Francisco.
   On Jan. 7, 1982, Conigliaro auditioned for a spot on the Red Sox
telecasting team. Joseph Dimino, station manager of WSBK-TV, said
Conigliaro had been ``a leading candidate'' for the job.
   Two days later, Conigliaro suffered a heart attack, which put
him in a coma for four months. It also left him brain damaged and
affected his speech.
   He never recovered fully, but was able to walk with the aid of a
walker in his final years.
   Martelli said funeral arrangements were being planned.
