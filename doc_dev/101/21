Bye should not mean a hasty farewell from the Southern Section basketball 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Teams that performed best during the regular season earned the privilege of 
skipping the first playoff round, giving them more time to practice and allow 
injuries to heal. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, this is regarded as an advantage. However, coaches -- most of whom 
are prone to bouts of anxiety, anyway -- aren't sure if their byes are so good. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather there were no byes," said Camarillo Coach John Harbour, whose team 
earned a first-round bye in the 4-AA Division by winning a share of the 
Marmonte League title. "Teams that play in the first round get their playoff 
jitters out of the way." 
</P>
<P>
Yet jitters aside, a bye advances a team one step closer to saying hello to a 
Southern Section championship. In addition to Camarillo, county teams that 
begin play in the second round Friday are Buena (5-A), Rio Mesa (4-A) and Santa 
Clara (2-A). 
</P>
<P>
Because only 13 teams qualified for the 2-A playoffs, Santa Clara, the 
top-seeded team, needs to win only three games to give Coach Lou Cvijanovich 
his 10th Southern Section title. When the Southern Section offered teams the 
chance to move up to a higher playoff division in January, several 2-A teams 
fled to the 2-AA. Avoiding the prospect of facing the Saints might have been a 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Clara (20-3) has lost only once on the court, a 39-38 loss to Edison in 
the Estancia tournament last December. The Saints, upset over what they felt 
was poor officiating, declined to return to the tournament and were assessed 
two forfeit losses. 
</P>
<P>
Shon Tarver, a junior transfer from Rim of the World High, has provided Santa 
Clara with consistent scoring, averaging 23 points a game. The Saints also have 
a rugged inside game behind Bubba Burrage (17 points, eight rebounds) and John 
McGill (nine points, eight rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most improved part of Santa Clara's game is the play of its guards. 
The Saints' ability to break a press, in fact, is a work of art -- point guard 
Art Santana, who also averages nine points, five rebounds and three assists. 
</P>
<P>
Channel League champion Rio Mesa (20-4), the third-seeded 4-A team, also boasts 
a top-flight flyer at point guard. Speedy Lester Smith has improved steadily as 
a ball handler and has become an excellent defensive player, according to Coach 
Steve Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
"He handles all the pressure bringing the ball upcourt," Wolf said, "and he 
always guards the opponents' No. 1 player. He's our most consistent player and 
has legitimate Division I quickness." 
</P>
<P>
Forwards Jeff Garner and Eric Thomas give Smith two excellent scorers to feed. 
Garner is the Spartans' leading scorer, averaging 23 points a game, and Thomas 
is a two-time All-County player who finished the league season with strong 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
Harbortown may be a financially troubled Ventura resort, but Harbour-town in 
Camarillo is thriving as a school gymnasium. At Camarillo, Coach John Harbour 
gives sophomore son David the green light to shoot from anywhere on the floor. 
Well, anywhere inside 25 feet. The younger Harbour is accurate, averaging 21 
points, and he also has found time to average six rebounds and lead Camarillo 
(17-6) with four assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
Senior forward Frank Dews, who Coach Harbour calls "as consistent a player as 
I've coached," adds a 15-point scoring average. Dews, a returning starter, has 
responded well in several clutch situations. 
</P>
<P>
Buena (19-4) lost three times to Rio Mesa during the regular season, twice in 
league play and once in a tournament. But the Bulldogs are in a different 
playoff division than the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Bulldogs play at a fast tempo and are led by versatile forward 
Adan Valencia and sharp-shooting point guard Jeff Oliver, both starters on last 
year's league championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Valencia, a senior, averages 16 points and 11 rebounds. Oliver, a junior who 
made a transition from off-guard this season, averages 17 points and seven 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Buena, one of 10 5-A teams with a first-round bye, hopes to stay close to home 
when it begins play. The Bulldogs have had more success running the break than 
negotiating through traffic. Santa Ana defeated Buena last season in the 
semifinals after the Bulldogs traveled 3 1/2 hours to the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It took a while to limber up and we had only 21 points at the half," Buena 
Coach Glen Hannah said. "This year, the travel could be even worse because 
divisions aren't laid out geographically." 
</P>
<P>
This season, enrollment was the sole factor in deciding a team's playoff 
division. And the byes the structure created will be cursed or lauded, 
depending upon the outcomes of Friday's games.
