FT  18 SEP 92 / Sterling and the UK Economy: Business faces up to life with
a stronger dollar

FOR UK industrialists bemused by the continued upheaval in European
currencies yesterday, one fact stood out. The sterling-dollar rate is now at
Dollars 1.77. At the start of the month it was at Dollars 2. Sterling is
thus 12 per cent lower than it was a fortnight ago.
For reasons that are partly historic, the dollar remains the most important
single currency for UK manufacturers dealing with the outside world. In
terms of actual trading, as opposed to the translation of overseas earnings,
a stronger dollar cuts three ways.
It is good for exporters and those competing against dollar-based goods at
home or abroad. It is bad for importers. And it is decidedly mixed for small
companies that cannot afford sophisticated currency hedging, since a
switchback dollar adds to their trading risks.
An excellent example of an industry that benefits is aerospace. This is a
business denominated in dollars. For UK manufacturers, the weak dollar has
compounded the difficulties caused by the recession in civil aviation and
government cuts in military spending.
Rolls-Royce, the UK aero-engine and industrial power group, said yesterday
that a stronger dollar was better for the company. 'We build in pounds and
sell in dollars,' a Rolls-Royce official said.
Rolls-Royce said earlier this month that the weak dollar had reduced its
first-half profits by Pounds 10m compared with last year. The weaker dollar
also benefited Rolls-Royce's principal US competitors, General Electric and
Pratt &amp; Whitney.
A stronger dollar will also help UK aerospace companies such as British
Aerospace and components manufacturers such as Smiths Industries, TI-Dowty
and Lucas.
Sterling's fluctuations will have less impact on UK airlines. British
Airways explained yesterday that it sold tickets on both sides of the
Atlantic. A firmer dollar resulted in improved US traffic while a stronger
pound boosted UK travel across the Atlantic. The US currently accounts for
about 30 per cent of BA's passengers.
Another beneficiary is the UK's oil sector, where sterling's devaluation was
warmly welcomed. 'It's tremendously good news from a sterling oil company's
point of view,' said Mr John Walmesley, the finance director of Enterprise
Oil, the independent oil company. 'It will provide relief for a hard-pressed
sector.'
The devaluation will raise the sterling price of oil close to Pounds 12,
widely regarded among North Sea operators as a 'comfort' threshold.
In the UK motor industry, the effects are limited to specialist
manufacturers, since volume exports of cars from the US to the UK and
continental Europe still play only a minor role in the European market.
Against that, Jaguar and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the two UK luxury
carmakers, will both reap benefits from lower sterling as Britain's main car
exporters to the US.
North America accounted for 44 per cent of Jaguar's worldwide turnover last
year of Pounds 693m, and the previous steep fall in the value of the dollar
has played a role in its mounting losses, totalling Pounds 226m last year.
For Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the loss-making subsidiary of the UK engineering
group Vickers, North America accounts for about 28 per cent of worldwide
turnover.
Jaguar and Rolls-Royce have both suffered badly in the recessions in the UK
and US. In North America, however, fierce competition has meant that there
has been little scope to raise prices to compensate for loss of revenue
caused by the prolonged fall in the value of the dollar.
Devaluation of the pound against the dollar and D-Mark will also give an
important edge to the competitiveness of the UK luxury carmakers in North
America against their main rivals, Mercedes-Benz and BMW of Germany.
Among losers from devaluation are companies that depend on
dollar-denominated raw materials.
The ambivalent effect of weaker sterling on smaller companies is illustrated
by The Rocking Horse Shop, a Yorkshire-based company that makes and
despatches rocking horse kits to the US.'
The company's owner, Mr Tony Dew, said: 'It's knowing what prices to quote
at the time orders are taken which gives us the biggest headache.' Mr Dew
said miscalculating exchange rates between orders and despatch could have a
marked impact on a company with an annual turnover of around Pounds 250,000.
The latest dip in the value of the pound, he says, might give US export
business a boost. 'But then, we buy in some of our raw materials from
Germany, so that won't help.'
