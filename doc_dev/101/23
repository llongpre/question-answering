   Two editors complained Tuesday that
their First Amendment rights of free speech and religion were
violated when they were fired from a small Iowa newspaper for
organizing an anti-abortion group.
   The newspaper defended its actions and a lawyer for the Iowa
Civil Liberties Union said the editors didn't have a First
Amendment case.
   ``I guess my religious convictions are what brought it about,''
Terri Lambertsen, former People Page editor of the Fairfield
Ledger, said in a telephone interview. ``I have to believe that
serving the Lord is more important than my job.''
   The Ledger is a 5,000-circulation, six-day-a-week afternoon
newspaper published about 90 miles southeast of Des Moines.
   Ms. Lambertsen and News Editor John Kennedy were discharged
Monday when they refused to quit as leaders of the Southeast Iowa
Pro-Lifers, a newly-formed anti-abortion group. Ms. Lambertsen is
president and Kennedy is secretary of the group.
   Ledger Editor Jan Nierling said the newspaper was forced to fire
the two to protect its credibility, even though that left the paper
with only a managing editor, a reporter and sports editor.
   ``We take our business seriously. We just think it endangers
incredibly our perception of credibility and objectivity. A
newspaper's credibility is its most valuable asset,'' Ms. Nierling
said.
   The firings prompted a protest sponsored by Refocus Ministries,
a non-denominational ministerial group. About 40 protestors walked
in a circle in front of the Ledger office Tuesday afternoon.
   ``I have to agree with what John Kennedy said,'' said Larry
Rail, co-director of the group. ``He joined a group that is
pro-life. It doesn't mean his views as a newspaper reporter and
editor are going to change. So it's a blatant violation of his
rights.''
   The Ledger's policy is similar to many other news organizations,
according to William Hirschman, president of the Kansas chapter of
the Society of Professional Journalists and the group's Freedom of
Information representative for the region that includes Iowa.
   A common compromise, he said, is to permit reporters to
participate in some groups, but not as spokesmen or leaders, and to
prevent writers from covering events in which they are personally
involved.
   ``I would have hoped that the two sides would have sat down and
discussed it,'' he said.
   Last October, the Milwaukee Journal fired a receptionist, Diane
Dew, for her anti-abortion activities. In December, the paper said
it made a mistake and agreed to pay her a settlement. The Journal
said it had decided that its code of ethics for newsroom employees
did not apply to Ms. Dew.
   Last spring, reporters for The New York Times and The Washington
Post were criticized by their newspapers for participating in an
abortion rights march in Washington. No punitive action was taken
at either paper.
   Kennedy, an eight-year employee of the Ledger, said his
involvement with the anti-abortion group did not interfere with his
newspaper duties. He said the newspaper could send another reporter
to cover an abortion-related story if it felt his objectivity was
compromised.
   Neither Kennedy nor Ms. Lambertsen would say if they planned to
pursue legal remedies.
   ``I've got three kids, aged 4, 6 and 7. My wife works part-time
as a church secretary for $37 a week. I'm not sure yet what we'll
do, but the Lord will take care of us,'' Kennedy said.
   Ms. Nierling said the newspaper has a longstanding policy of
prohibiting reporters from being officers of politically active
groups that receive news coverage.
   ``I'm disappointed that they didn't have a better attitude
toward their professional responsibilities,'' she said.
   Mark Bennett, general counsel for the Iowa Civil Liberties
Union, said the First Amendment was not at issue in the case. The
First Amendment, he said, applies only to governments that try to
infringe religious and speech rights, not to private enterprises,
such as a newspaper.
   An untested theory, he said, would be whether the paper violated
Iowa's civil rights laws, which prohibit discrimination on the
basis of creed.
