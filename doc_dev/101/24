Few modern operas can claim a more tortuous genesis than Nikolai
Karetnikov's Till Eulenspiegel, which has just received its stage premiere
at Bielefeld in north Germany. Karetnikov, born in Moscow in 1930, comes
from the post-Shostakovich generation of Soviet composers who experimented
with new techniques and fell foul of the Communist authorities.
Till Eulenspiegel was hardly calculated to win official approval. A two-act
Singspiel completed in 1985, it is a parable of Soviet repression and the
indomitable human spirit. The work first reached the West two years ago, in
a recording made piecemeal with help from off-duty members of the Soviet
Cinema Orchestra and scraps of tape from the cutting-room. Today, the only
obstacles to its performance in Moscow are financial. And so - with an irony
that suits Karetnikov's style - Till Eulenspiegel has been premiered far
from the people to whom it would mean most.
Initial reactions to the recording were ecstatic. Gramophone went so far as
to hail it as 'one of the most powerful operas of recent times'. John Dew's
Bielefeld production hardly supports that verdict. Till Eulenspiegel comes
across as a good allegorical yarn - easy-to-follow, singable and
entertaining, but not strikingly original.
Karetnikov and his co-librettist, the film director Pavel Lungin (Taxi
Blues), used a novel by the 19th century Belgian writer Charles de Coster as
their source. Till is more than the endearing prankster depicted in the
Strauss tone poem - he becomes an uncompromising fighter for justice and
freedom.
The setting is Flanders under the Hapsburg empire and the Spanish
inquisition. Till is exiled for making fun of a monk, his father is burned
as a heretic, his mother is murdered and he himself is nearly executed. From
first to last, death and freedom form two sides of the same coin - no more
so than in the final scene, when Till dies of poison and is mysteriously
resurrected.
Woven into the fabric of the story are bizarre clips of the Spanish court
and a role-call of stereotypes - a fishmonger who informs on his fellow
citizens, a fortune-teller, a quartet of prostitutes and Till's alter ego, a
vagabond named Lamme. All are wrapped into a polystilistic theatrical idiom
embracing mystery-play, pantomime, ballet, burlesque and satirical drama -
while running the musical gamut from renaissance song and baroque recitative
to Orthodox chant, Sprechgesang and 12-note variations. Karetnikov emerges
as a musical chameleon, a virtuoso impersonator, but lacking Schnittke's
ability to mould his influences into something more personal.
Dew's production, designed by Thomas Gruber and Jose Manuel Vazquez, matches
the parodistic quality of the score, without losing sight of the pain and
violence beneath the surface. The stage is a 20th century prison of wire
mesh, divided into three playing areas to keep pace with the quick changes
of setting. No scene outstays its welcome, though some would have benefited
from a more identifiable sense of place.
The biggest drawback is the positioning of the orchestra behind the stage,
from where - despite amplification - Karetnikov's subtle accompagnato makes
a sketchy impression. Give or take some predictable lapses of coordination
with his cast, Geoffrey Moull conjures an idiomatic range of sound. In the
baritone title role, William Oberholtzer is more worthy than charismatic.
The Bielefeld ensemble provides versatile support, with excellent
contributions from Susan Maclean as Till's fiancee Nele and Ulrich Neuweiler
as Lamme.
