   Something unexpected is lurking on Madison Avenue -- good
news.
   Ad spending is still sluggish, and the economy is still
sour, but Wall Street apparently believes the worst is over
for the ad agency business.
                                                                                                       

   Stocks of most of the publicly held major agencies have
begun a quiet ascent this year, prompted by a belief that the
long-awaited advertising recovery may finally begin in the
second half. Analysts point hopefully to anecdotal evidence,
such as ad gains at a few scattered newspapers and spending
increases by several big advertisers.
   "At the beginning of the year, I would have said I'm
concerned that we're going into a recession and these aren't
the stocks to hold," says Greg Ostroff, an analyst with
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. "I'm more bullish now."
   Most of the ad stocks are handily outpacing the S&amp;P 500 so
far this year, a surprising and welcome sign for the
beleaguered industry. While the S&amp;P index was off 1.1% for
1992 as of Friday, Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications
shares had climbed by 8.3% and Omnicom Group by 12.5%, says
James Dougherty, a County NatWest Securities analyst.
   Shares of Interpublic Group of Cos., generally the most
highly regarded agency of all, were off less than 1%, but had
been priced at a 52-week high at the beginning of the year.
Interpublic shares fell 12.5 cents to $56.625 in late New
York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, after the company
reported 1991 net income had climbed 18% to $94.6 million, or
$2.60 a share. Net for the fourth quarter jumped 25% to $40.5
million, or $1.10 a share. The figures were in line with
expectations.
   Analysts caution that there is no wholesale recovery in
sight yet, merely the glint of light at the end of an
exceedingly long tunnel. Alan Gottesman, a PaineWebber
analyst, likens it to having "the ingredients in the shopping
basket, but we haven't started cooking yet." He hasn't
upgraded his "neutral" appraisal of the agency stocks, though
some other analysts have "buy" recommendations for
Interpublic and Omnicom.
   Analysts and ad executives nevertheless are seizing on the
few good omens they can find. The Washington Post in January
saw an increase in help-wanted advertising for the first time
in 40 months. At this newspaper, published by Dow Jones &amp;
Co., ad linage was up for three of the past four months. And
several major advertisers, including Goodyear Tire, have
recently announced they are beefing up 1992 national ad
budgets.
   At the same time, ad agencies have been furiously slashing
costs in the past few lean years. When ad spending does
bounce back, even if only in a small way, it should go
straight to the bottom line, because agencies are so lean,
analysts say. While boom times may still be several years
off, "at some point over the next two to three years, all the
pieces are falling in place" for a "significant" recovery,
Goldman's Mr. Ostroff says.
   Showing the biggest gains among ad stocks this year --
admittedly from severely depressed levels -- are the two
troubled British giants, WPP Group and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. Yet
analysts remain skeptical about their outlook for the near
future.
   WPP, which owns Ogilvy &amp; Mather and J. Walter Thompson,
has declined to comment on the recent runup of its American
depositary receipts, which jumped to $3 on Friday from
$1.6875 on the preceding Monday. Yesterday, the ADRs fell
back to $2.6875 in national over-the-counter trading.
Analysts discount rumors that a refinancing is imminent, and
they have no explanation for the jump. County NatWest's Mr.
Dougherty says WPP has #235 million ($416.3 million) in
revolving debt due next year, and "it will be hard for that
stock to do well until people see a resolution of the
uncertainty."
   Madison Avenue and Wall Street both have been dead wrong
in predicting an ad recovery too many times to count -- and
so this time around, analysts are being especially cautious.
None are confident enough to count on a recovery in the
second half, though all are hoping for one. But as Goldman's
Mr. Ostroff says, if that recovery does materialize, "then
these stocks have further {up} to go."

   Lintas Dismisses Report
                                                                                                       

   Interpublic Group's Lintas:New York dismissed as
"speculation" a published report that its estimated $60
million MasterCard International account was going into
review.
   In an internal staff memo, the agency's chairman and chief
executive officer, Tony Miller, dismissed the report in the
trade magazine Adweek and defended his agency's work for the
New York credit card association. A new ad campaign "hasn't
yet cleared the bankers," Mr. Miller explained, "and it's
because of this that the speculation has resumed."
   A MasterCard spokesman said the company wouldn't comment
on the report, but Adweek said it stands by its story that a
formal review would begin this week.
   MasterCard's estimated 1992 ad budget of $60 million
represents a 30% increase over last year, a move aimed at
stemming its loss of market share to Visa, according to the
Nilson Report newsletter.
   The Lintas memo said Peter Dimsey, president of
MasterCard's U.S. credit card group, "confirmed that no
review is planned at this time." "If and when it changes,
you'll be the first to know," the memo said.

   LOTTERY: Bozell's Southfield, Mich., office was awarded
the Michigan State Lottery's estimated $12 million account
under a one-year, interim contract. The lottery abruptly
terminated the five-year contract it had signed in 1988 with
W.B. Doner &amp; Co., Southfield, Mich., citing its need for
greater promotion expertise. Doner's chairman, Herbert Fried,
said the change resulted from a new political administration.
                                                                                                       

   ACCOUNTS: D'Arcy, Masius Benton &amp; Bowles held on to its
estimated $20 million Louis Rich meat account with Kraft
General Foods, a unit of Philip Morris Cos. . . . W.B. Doner
won the accounts of the Pittsburgh Metro and Pittsburgh
Outstate Ford dealer associations, with combined billings of
an estimated $4 million. The incumbent was the Pittsburgh
office of Young &amp; Rubicam unit Burson-Marsteller.
                                                                                                       

   BSB IN CHINA: Saatchi &amp; Saatchi unit Backer Spielvogel
Bates Worldwide said it was expanding in China, opening
offices in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing, in addition to
its current Hong Kong operations. Saatchi and Backer service
their clients in China as BSB/Saatchi.
                                                                                                       

   MOUNTAIN DEW: PepsiCo is kicking off a major push for its
Mountain Dew citrus soft-drink brand during CBS's broadcast
of the Grammy Awards next week. Legendary bluesman Bo Diddley
plays guitar to introduce Mountain Dew's new "Get Vertical"
theme.
