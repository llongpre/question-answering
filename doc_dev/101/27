   Rock 'n' roll. Kids love it, parents hate it.
   And as the music industry celebrates itself at the 32nd annual
Grammy Awards on Wednesday, parents groups, religious organizations
and state legislatures have declared war on rock.
   Some rock lyrics, they say, advocate sex, drugs, subversion and
violence, and they aim to put a stop to that.
   For more than 30 years, rock 'n' roll has been a
multibillion-dollar winner for record companies.
   But for every tune welcomed by parents such as Billy Joel's ``We
Didn't Start the Fire,'' which has been praised for offering
youngsters an instant history lesson, others are condemned as unfit
for children.
   Legislators have stepped in with a direct message. It's a small,
yellow flourescent sticker on records, compact discs and cassettes:
   ``Warning: May contain explicit lyrics descriptive of or
advocating one or more of the following: suicide, incest,
bestiality, sadomasochism, sexual activity in a violent context,
murder, morbid violence, illegal use of drugs or alcohol.''
   That's what a bill recently passed by the Pennsylvania House of
Representatives would require for records containing any of the
above in song lyrics. A proposed Missouri law would add ``nudity''
to the list. Florida would include ``sexual activity.''
   Iowa, Arizona, Maryland and Oklahoma have also drawn up
legislation, and Virginia, Alaska, New Mexico, Illinois, Delaware
and Kansas are considering similar measures.
   While rock 'n' roll and all its lyrics go prime time on the
Grammys, record stores around the country are being pressured to
keep things clean:
   _The 450-store national Trans World chain now sells stickered
products in its Florida stores only to those 18 or older as the
result of a ``sting'' operation by Florida attorney Jack Thompson
in which minors purchased unedited versions of rap group 2 Live
Crew's records.
   The 52-store Spec's Music chain, based in Florida, and the
70-store Nashville, Tenn.-based Sound Shop chain have adopted
similar policies.
   _Last year, Tommy Hammond, a record shopkeeper in Alexander
City, Ala., was convicted of obscenity for selling 2 Live Crew's
``Move Something'' LP, which contains a tune titled ``S&amp;M.''
Although the customer was a local police officer, Hammond was told
by the arresting officer, ``Nobody's old enough to buy it in this
state.'' Hammond was fined $500 by the city court and has appealed
to a circuit court.
   _In May 1989, Ouachita County Sheriff Jack Dews seized a number
of rap and heavy metal tapes from the WalMart chain and Hear the
Blues record stores in Camden, Ark. ``They had them displayed in
open cases, some on open counters,'' Dews said. ``A 10-year-old
could buy them and they were clearly labeled as obscene.''
   Rap and heavy metal are the prime targets, but mainstream stars
have also come under attack. Madonna's ``Like a Prayer'' commercial
for Pepsi was pulled after a threatened boycott by Mississippi
preacher Donald Wildmon, who heads the American Family Association.
Mick Jagger said Columbia Records asked the Rolling Stones to
delete words from the inner sleeve of their ``Dirty Work'' album.
   ``One of the things that Hitler was real good at and very shrewd
in doing was developing the youth,'' said Mike Shelton, a police
officer in Union City, Calif., and author of the training manual
``Punk Rock &amp; Heavy Metal: The Problem-One Solution.''
   ``Much of that was about distinct uniforms, distinct lifestyles
and distinct music. Music can influence particular young people,''
he said.
   Tipper Gore, president of the Parents Music Resource Center
(PMRC), agrees. She says youngsters are influenced by ``the
glorification of violence.''
   A year ago, multiplatinum-artist Bobby Brown was dragged from
the stage of the Municipal Auditorium in Columbus, Ga., and
arrested for ``dancing suggestively.'' In Cincinnati, rappers NWA
and Too $hort were fined for giving ``obscene'' performances.
   In April 1989, platinum-selling Metallica, a heavy metal group,
was forced to cancel a show at Notre Dame University because of
``bad publicity.''
   Ever since Elvis Presley appeared on ``The Ed Sullivan Show,''
censors have sought to confine rock 'n' roll to the waist up.
Rock's defenders insist the latest wave of criticism is simply the
same old song.
   ``To me the rock 'n' roll attitude is live and let live,'' said
Bill Adler, of Rush Artists Management, whose clients include
rappers Public Enemy, Run-DMC and LL Cool J.
   ``I don't believe the issue is a couple of dirty rap records.
What's going on here is there's kind of a cultural war in progress.
This music has always been under attack by elements of the
Christian fundamentalist right ever since it first surfaced in the
mid-1950s.''
   But organizations such as PMRC, which pressures record companies
to label products, claim customers have a right to know what's in
the stores. PMRC insists it's not looking to pull the plug on rock,
but merely to jiggle the wires.
   PMRC prefers a voluntary system much like the rating system for
movies between filmmakers and the Motion Picture Association of
America Inc.
   ``Specifically, we're interested in material that is impacting
children,'' executive director Jennifer Norwood said. ``We don't
monitor every record. It has more to do with than just a
four-letter word. We are dealing with material that is so graphic.''
