Jeannette DeWyze and Steve Wolfe have been married 16 years. They have two 
children, a house in San Diego and two thriving careers. But every month, they 
sit down, add up their expenses and split them in half. They have never had a 
joint bank account. 
</P>
<P>
Sarah Williams and Ron Thompson were married last year. They live in the 
condominium in Los Angeles that she bought before they married. She pays for 
their food and clothes. She put his name on her savings account. But his money 
goes into his business. 
</P>
<P>
"Household expenses? Not my problem, baby," mused Ron, an artist and general 
contractor who, like his wife, asked not to be identified by his real name. 
"This is a little early 1990s male chauvinism." 
</P>
<P>
There are few rules left governing how couples handle their assets. The women's 
movement and the divorce rate have put an end to that. Some merge everything, a 
few merge nothing. And more and more, couples alight on some murky middle 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
Usually, it happens haphazardly. They marry in their thirties with a modern-day 
dowry of bank accounts, investments and careers. Out of habit, they may start 
off keeping things separate. But they soon mingle them, all too often with 
little or no thought. 
</P>
<P>
The consequences of their non-decisions can be dire. If the marriage ends, a 
spouse can lose more than his shirt. Yet financial planners and marriage 
counselors say they are struck by a common theme: how much money matters and 
how little it is discussed or understood. 
</P>
<P>
"Money is critical in our marriages," said Jean Flannigan, a psychotherapist in 
West Los Angeles. "I think it is the single most important symbol of the 
underlying issues. We project our psyche, or our soul, onto money." 
</P>
<P>
"People will share intimate information about their sex life with their best 
friend, but they won't share their finances," said Rose Greene, a financial 
planner in Santa Monica. "It is the most private subject, and it has the most 
amount of shame associated with it." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time when our hang-ups perhaps mattered less. Men made money and 
most women didn't. Couples married young, without houses, investments, children 
from previous marriages. They pooled everything. After all, hadn't they married 
for life? 
</P>
<P>
But these days, most women work. Some earn more than their husbands or derive 
self-esteem from being self-supporting. Many couples marry later, in their 
thirties and forties, bringing wealth from an earlier life. And half of all 
marriages end in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
Contemplating breakup, therefore, has become a necessary evil. Otherwise, 
ex-partners can find themselves fleeced -- their hard-earned assets split 50-50 
under community property laws or passed on, inadvertently, to a surviving 
spouse's children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
Under California's community property system, money earned through either 
spouse's work during the marriage becomes community property. If the marriage 
ends, those earnings must be served up for division under the terms of a 
divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
But assets acquired by either spouse before the marriage can be held as 
separate property -- not subject to division in a divorce -- as long as an 
absolute separation is maintained and there is no intentional or inadvertent 
"commingling" of assets. 
</P>
<P>
According to financial planners, more and more couples are keeping at least 
some property separate, especially in second marriages. Some do it because they 
have stopped believing that marriage is permanent; others do it to protect 
their children's inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
Many hold their house jointly, splitting the mortgage payments. Investments 
from before the marriage remain separate. They set up separate and joint bank 
accounts and credit cards. Only over time do they begin making joint 
investments and "merging." 
</P>
<P>
What is the best way? 
</P>
<P>
Most financial planners insist it is impossible to generalize; any financial 
arrangement must be tailored to the couple in question. If there is one rule, 
they say, it's that couples should talk about money in advance. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of it has to do not necessarily with just protecting the assets but 
protecting the egos," said Alan Ungar, a certified financial planner in 
Calabasas. "It's much less a financial planning decision than it is an 
emotional one." 
</P>
<P>
Rose Greene and Carol Rabaut have been lovers for 12 years. Rose has kept her 
inherited assets in her own name. But the two women share a lot -- a house in 
West Los Angeles, a car, two dogs, a cat and an explicit agreement on how they 
would divide things if they split up. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some people mistake the way they hold assets with the degree of 
commitment," said Greene, a financial analyst, who sees in her job the damage 
wrought by what she calls indiscriminate merging. "I don't think I love Carol 
one iota less because I choose to hold assets in my own name." 
</P>
<P>
Others, however, are wary of such separateness. They fear it symbolizes bad 
faith. Some say they would never marry a man who asked that they sign a 
prenuptial agreement; indeed, weddings have been called off at the last minute 
over that issue. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm certainly suspicious of people who really keep things separate," said 
Sarah Williams, the 41-year-old television executive who pays all of her 
husband's living expenses. "I mean, joining funds is like the least of the 
commitment to joining your lives together." 
</P>
<P>
And a few, like Jeannette DeWyze, prefer to keep everything totally separate. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in the early years of my marriage I was very concerned about 
preserving my own autonomy within the union," said DeWyze, a 37-year-old 
writer. "I guess it was always important for me to feel I could make it on my 
own outside of marriage." 
</P>
<P>
"It just fit us, and our psychological makeup," she said. "It's only from other 
people's reactions that I get some idea of how weird people think it is." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
TIPS 
</P>
<P>
* Couples should talk about money in advance because the consequences of 
non-decisions can be dire. Ex-partners can find their hard-earned assets split 
50-50 under community property laws or passed on, inadvertently, to a surviving 
spouse's children from a previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
* Under California's community property system, money earned through either 
spouse's work during the marriage becomes community property. If the marriage 
ends, those earnings must be served up for division under the terms of a 
divorce settlement. 
</P>
<P>
* Assets acquired by either spouse before the marriage can be held as seperate 
property-not subject to division in a divorce-as long as an absolute separation 
is maintained and there is no intentional or inadvertent "commingling" of 
assets.
