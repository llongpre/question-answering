<LEADPARA>  The wind was brisk on a recent Friday at the Corn Palace. Business wasn't.;   
"It's not bad, if it wasn't for this wind," said Joe Francia. "They're comin'
in; it's not bad. Better than I thought it would be."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  AFTER SUBDIVISION FAILS TO SPROUT, CORN IS
GREEN AGAIN AT CORN PALACE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Joe and Ben Francia reopened their Sunnyvale produce market after a year in
which it didn't operate, the surrounding 20 acres lying unplanted.;    Homes
were to be built, replacing the truck farm that had operated for 50 years. But
the development deal, the Francia brothers said last week, is off.;    Corn is
growing, the Francias have reopened and some lucky homeowners will be spared
from living on Corn Palace Lane.;    The Corn Palace will be open until the
first of next year, for its 51st year.;    "The developers are out of it now,"
Joe said, making it clear he doesn't want to elaborate.;    Joe, 69, and Ben,
71, seem happy to be back planting the corn that has made them locally famous
and tending the fruit and vegetable stand at White Oak Lane and Lily Avenue, a
landmark for drivers on busy Lawrence Expressway.;    The city a little more
than a year ago approved a 112-lot subdivision and annexed the property. A
Santa Clara firm, Dividend Development Corp., planned to build two-story homes
in the $400,000 price range. Maybe homes will be built someday, but that
development is out.;    Started farming in 1926;  Joe and Ben, together with
their late father, Mike Francia, worked together to raise corn, bell peppers,
green peas, cucumbers, tomatoes and squash. At their home on Whisman Road in
Mountain View, they grew apricots and other fruit, starting in 1926, and the
brothers still do.;    Mike Francia was an Italian immigrant who married a
daughter of immigrants and settled on Whisman with his Serafina in a time when
El Camino Real was a dirt road with orchards and hay fields on both sides.;   
They had two sons and two daughters, Ben and Joe and Rose and Julia. Rose is
Rose Luiz, a Sunnyvale resident. Julia Rivas lives in Mountain View.;    "This
was our livelihood," Joe said. "We were there before anything. We watched
Moffett Field come in. We watched the highway come in. . . . To me it was the
good old days.";    Mountain View was dairy country, with Portuguese, German
and Spanish immigrants running the farms. Mike Francia bought their manure to
spread on his fields.;    Mike continued to cultivate with horses even after
tractors were common. "He would cultivate all day long, and smoke his Italian
cigars," Joe said.;    "The horses had to be brushed and fed first, and then
we had breakfast.;    "You gotta enjoy what you do. Working out in the open
was what we liked.";    The brothers rode their bicycles to school. Mountain
View was a post office, a blacksmith shop and a Red and White food store, they
said. Each boy took one side of the street going and coming to school, taking
orders for produce. The next morning, they delivered it.;    "Mother used to
put the money in a little jar, to buy flour, or a sack of beans," Ben said.;  
 Ben's son Gabe, a mechanic, helps out on weekends at the Corn Palace, and
often in the evenings. Joe's son, Michael, a Mountain View garbage collector,
helps when he gets off work.;    Picked 'dew fresh';  "I think myself, not to
brag, the corn we grow -- no one else grows better corn. It's picked every
morning, dew fresh," Ben said.;    It's clear the brothers are glad to be back
doing what they love. But how long will they do it? "God knows," Ben said.;   
"As long as our health keeps up and we have the strength to do it," Joe said.;
   The corn is planted every 10 days, with the last planting, in early August,
carrying the Corn Palace through the rest of the year. "We never run out of
corn," Ben said. "We've always got fresh corn coming on. Our specialty is
corn.";    "It wouldn't be called a Corn Palace if it weren't" Joe said.;  IF
YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Corn Palace fruit and vegetable stand is at White Oak
Lane and Lily Avenue in Sunnyvale, and is open from 5:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m.  </TEXT>
