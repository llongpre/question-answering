<LEADPARA>  The Reading Program has enlisted the help of a Gilroy cow called Dew Drop to
help in an annual fund-raiser.;   The idea is that people buy squares of a big
field for $10 each, Dew Drop is let loose on the field, and if she drops a cow
patty on your square you win $5,000. Proceeds benefit the Reading Program, a
South County literacy project.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Dew Drop is owned by Adams 4-H Club member Melissa Linden.;   Last year,
the effort grossed $10,600 and netted $5,600 for the literacy project after a
winner walked away with $5,000, said Pat Barrett of The Reading Program.;  
This year, the pot's been sweetened. In addition to a chance at $5,000, every
ticket buyer also automatically gets a chance to win a door prize, a new
Specialized off-road bicycle and helmet.;   It costs $50,000 per year to run
the South County office of The Reading Program, but only a portion of that
comes from the Santa Clara County library system. The rest must be raised
though grants and fund-raisers, Barrett said.;   All proceeds from the cow
patty bingo game will be used to support programs of the South County office,
Barrett said.;   The South County office runs a tutoring program for adults
that, on average, has about 50 volunteer tutors working one-on-one with
students, he said.;   In addition, the office operates pilot reading programs
for children at Jordan School in Gilroy and P.A. Walsh School in Morgan Hill.;
  In those programs, volunteers read to children who may not be read to at
home in order to increase their interest and skills in reading, according to
Barrett.;   The cow patty bingo game will begin at 1 p.m. Saturday at the San
Martin Pumpkin Patch, 13865 Monterey Road, San Martin.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED;
Tickets may be purchased at the Pumpkin Patch on Saturday until 11 a.m., and
before that at 42 Martin St., Gilroy, or by calling The Reading Program at
848-5366.  </TEXT>
