Pressures on regional power suppliers

THE RUHR region boasts the headquarters of two leading electricity
utilities, RWE Energie in Essen and VEW in Dortmund. Both companies belong
to an exclusive club for utilities owning the high voltage grid, the
Deutsche Verbundgesellschaft.
RWE Energie is the most powerful of the nine club members, with a high
voltage grid four times the length of VEW's. RWE was founded in Essen in the
heart of the Ruhr region in 1898 by Hugo Stinnes, the famous industrialist
known to competitors as 'the black-bearded Assyrian,' who emerged after
World War I as Germany's 'Business Kaiser,' controlling coal mines, steel
mills, banks, newspapers, hotels, shipping lines - and electrical plants.
RWE, partially communally-owned, steadily expanded and evolved over the
decades to become Germany's largest electricity utility. In 1990, the
company was restructured to form the RWE Holding in which utility RWE
Energie constitutes just one of six sectors.
The other big electricity utility in the Ruhr was set up in the 1920s: the
Vereinigte Elektrizitaetswerke Westfalen (VEW), based in Dortmund. VEW was
formed by the fusion of several communally owned regional supply companies.
Shortly afterwards, VEW and RWE signed an 'electro-peace treaty' - a
demarcation contract - agreeing not to trespass upon each others' territory.
Such contracts, allowed as exceptions under German competition law, now
exist between all nine 'Verbund' utilities.
Today, VEW is west Germany's fourth largest utility in terms of electricity
sales. It has rapidly expanding gas distribution and waste disposal sectors.
Both RWE and VEW are partly publicly owned, with anachronistic multiple
voting rights giving the communal shareholders an influence
disproportionately large in view of their minority capital shares.
With electricity sales falling - VEW sales were down 1.6 oer cent in 1992,
RWE-Energie sales down by 3 per cent in 1992-93 - the utilities have a
growth problem. Potential in east Germany and eastern Europe exists, but it
is developing very slowly.
Strong talk by the European Commission and the German Federal Cartel Office
(FCO) over the introduction of more competition in the electricity sector
have added impetus to a trend in which smaller utilities seek to hitch
themselves up with larger ones.
The 'minnows' hope that if and when the free-for-all for electricity
customers begins, this overlapping of interests will prevent the large
utilities from snapping up all their lucrative customers. The pattern does
not stop here - even the larger utilities are consolidating their positions.
And the FCO in Berlin appears to have only limited power to stop this trend.
A warning came from the chairman of RWE, Dr. Friedhelm Gieske this April:
'Competition within the energy sectors, bound by cable or pipeline
transmission, will inevitably lead to concentration so that the large
companies will become ever bigger. This would ultimately help us, but would
be a political mistake and therefore is not something we want.'
Recent developments in the Ruhr illustrate the creeping concentration in the
electricity sector. The city of Dortmund has a concession contract, expiring
in 1994, under which VEW is its exclusive electricity supplier. Initially,
the Dortmund municipal Stadtwerke dreamed of taking over the city
electricity supply. However, sobered by VEW's demands for a payment of
around DM1bn for the Dortmund transmission grid, the Stadtwerke agreed to a
compromise. VEW and the Stadtwerke will found a joint supply company,
Dortmunder Energie und Wasserverorgung (DEW) for the electricity, gas,
district heating and water supply to the city.
The FCO has approved the deal but imposed two conditions. First, the
contract is valid for only 20 years. Second, VEW is not allowed to use its
minority voting rights to influence Stadtwerke Dortmund decisions over the
source of DEW electricity supplies. In fact, the choice of supplier is very
limited anyway. The only alternative to VEW is the regional utility
Elektromark, in Hagen. And the Stadtwerke has already decided to continue
taking electricity from VEW.
The FCO's attempt to preserve an element of competition is weak. Observers
wonder if Dortmund is likely to change suppliers after 20 years of
co-operating with VEW - and if Elektromark still be around in 20 years, in
any case. Elektromark's supervisory and executive boards have strongly
recommended linking up with RWE Energie and VEW by selling each of them a 10
per cent block of shares. The link with RWE-Energie is designed to intensify
co-operation in the electricity sector, the connection with VEW serving
links in the waste disposal sector. Elektromark is also selling its 300MW
share in the Emsland nuclear power station in equal shares to RWE-Energie
and second largest German utility, Preussenelektra, to the discomfort of VEW
which owns the other 75 per cent.
Such manoeuvres are by no means limited to the Ruhr. Elsewhere in Germany
the larger utilities are also consolidating their positions. The Bavarian
Bayernwerk is moving rapidly closer to a merger with the Viag Group.
IN Baden-Wuerttemberg, utilities Badenwerk and Energie-Versorgung Schwaben
have been permitted by the FCO to merge on the grounds that there was no
competition between the two anyway. Other smaller electricity companies want
to join, too. They fear that if the electricity sector were liberalised
there would otherwise be little to stop Badenwerk/EVS taking their best
customers.
Hannover has decided to sell 40 per cent of its municipal utility. Twenty
per cent goes to German gas giant, Ruhrgas, also based in Essen. Thuega, a
subsidiary of the giant Veba which also owns utility Preussenelektra, is
taking the other 20 per cent. The link with Thuega could help stave off
potential future threats from Preussenelektra to win the Hannover utility's
big customers, such as Volkswagen and Continental.
In the Ruhr, the FCO would undoubtedly fight hard to prevent a VEW merger
with another utility. But as VEW slips down the pecking order of 'Verbund'
companies and is sandwiched between the supply areas of RWE and
Preussenelektra, observers wonder how long will it be before it, too,
decides the electricity business is best carried out 'in co-operation' with
a stronger partner.
