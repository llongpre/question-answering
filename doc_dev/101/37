FOR somewhat more down-to-earth and less nostalgic picnicking there is the
Huzar table (right). No more lolling on rugs damp with dew - this picnic
table seats four in comfort and folds into a flattish carrying case so that
it can be stowed in boot or boat.
Made from plastic with a strong aluminium frame, it is easy to clean and
robust as well as light. It could go happily to pool or polo, to riverside
or point-to-point, to Badminton or Glyndebourne. It weighs 21 lb, pulls out
to measure 33 1/2 in by 26 in and it comes in blue, green, red or yellow. It
can only be bought by post and costs Pounds 69 from Huzar Co, PO Box 12,
Knebworth, Herts SG3 6QQ. Tel: 0438-811018.
