<P>
The philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein may be the most famous obscure intellectual 
of the century. It's hard to imagine a more unwilling celebrity than this 
profoundly serious man who shunned publicity and devoted his life to the 
pursuit of clarity. Since his death in 1951, however, he has emerged as one of 
the best known and least comprehended contemporary thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
He's the "Mad Genius" as sent by Central (European) Casting, the savior of 
British philosophy or its trivializer. He is passionate, tormented, 
misunderstood, a man so singular that virtually everyone who ever knew him, 
from Bertrand Russell to the man who delivered peat to his cottage in Ireland, 
remembered and wrote about him. He reminded one student of "the Norse God 
Baldur, blue-eyed and fair-haired, with a beauty that had nothing sensual about 
it." Others were less enthusiastic. One young boy told his diary: "Witkinstein 
(sic) is an impossible person everytime you say anything he says 'No No that's 
not the point.' " 
</P>
<P>
He was equally hard on himself, a master of self-laceration who often 
contemplated suicide. Though baptized a Catholic, he was of Jewish descent, a 
heritage he sometimes blamed for his moral and mental inadequacies in language 
reminiscent of "Mein Kampf." (Curiously, Hitler and Wittgenstein attended the 
same school for a year; there's no evidence that they met.) 
</P>
<P>
Though he wrote constantly, he revised constantly too; most of his work has 
been posthumously published, and generates hundreds of scholarly books and 
articles each year. A recent bibliography lists nearly 6,000 items. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the academy, Wittgenstein is a cultural presence to many who know him 
only as a name, or the inspiration for a sizable body of music, art and 
writing. His words have been rendered in dance and neon; there's even a poem 
about his lecturing style. He's a character in several novels and is mentioned 
in plays, on public television and by Woody Allen. 
</P>
<P>
For those who want to learn more about his fascinating figure, Ray Monk's 
thoughtful and accessible biography, intended for the general reader, 
encompasses the life and work in a single narrative, illuminating the values 
implicit in both. 
</P>
<P>
The book's subtitle, "The Duty of Genius," is taken from Otto Weininger's "Sex 
and Character," which Monk believes is the source of many of Wittgenstein's 
attitudes toward life and love. Weininger, a misogynist and anti-Semite, 
believed it was man's duty to conquer the flesh and to discover and realize his 
genius -- or to kill himself. A Jew and a homosexual, Weininger shot himself at 
23, in the house where Beethoven, his hero, died. Suicide greatly increased 
both Weininger's moral prestige and the sales of his book, which Wittgenstein 
read as an adolescent. 
</P>
<P>
Though Monk's is not the authorized biography, he enjoyed the complete 
cooperation of Wittgenstein's literary executors, who permitted him to quote 
from previously unpublished material, including diary entries written by 
Wittgenstein in code about his homosexuality, which has been the subject of an 
unseemly, irresistible debate. Much of Monk's research will be new to even avid 
readers of Wittgensteiniana; those unacquainted with Wittgenstein's philosophy 
will find Monk's explanations helpful and unforbidding, if not exactly a piece 
of Sacher torte. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittgenstein was born in Vienna in 1889, the eighth child of an extremely 
rich, cultivated and ill-fated family. His father was a steel magnate on the 
order of Andrew Carnegie, his mother a musically gifted patron of the arts. 
Three of the brothers committed suicide; the fourth, Paul, continued his career 
as a concert pianist despite the loss of an arm in World War I. 
</P>
<P>
The world is fin de siecle Vienna, the city Karl Kraus called "the research 
laboratory for world destruction"; the birthplace of Nazism and Zionism; the 
Vienna of Sigmund Freud, Arnold Shoenberg and Adolph Loos. Like these 
contemporaries, Wittgenstein broke away from the historical outlook in his 
field: His linguistic analysis is a radical departure in philosophy, analogous 
to psychoanalysis in psychiatry, atonality in music and functionalism in 
design. 
</P>
<P>
Wittgenstein's originality seemed especially pronounced in the alien culture of 
England, where he spent much of his working life. He went to Manchester as a 
young man to study engineering, then took up aeronautics and, finally, 
mathematical logic at Cambridge with Bertrand Russell, who introduced him to G. 
E. Moore, John Maynard Keynes and other Apostles of Bloomsbury. 
</P>
<P>
At the outbreak of World War I, Wittgenstein enlisted in the Austrian 
artillery, hoping to die or to change his life. He fought on the Russian front, 
was decorated for bravery and taken prisoner in Italy. When he was captured, he 
had with him the manuscript of the "Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus," the only 
one of his books published in his lifetime, a work as magisterial as its title 
suggests, and best understood (if at all) in the context of Wittgenstein's war 
experience. Here Monk's approach is particularly apt, revealing, as 
Wittgenstein insisted, that "the point of the book is ethical." 
</P>
<P>
So was the point of Wittgenstein's life, which shows the strong ethical views 
that the "Tractatus" says cannot be spoken of, only made manifest. He sought a 
life of Christian virtue as conceived by Tolstoy, and seems to have taken the 
ideals of poverty, chastity and duty more seriously than his mentor. He 
relinquished his fortune to his sisters and brother and lived very simply, in 
barely furnished rooms, once telling a friend: "I don't care what I eat as long 
as it's the same thing every day." Since sex and love were incompatible, he was 
tortured by sexual guilt over even fantasized transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
He grew to see philosophy as his duty, and devoted his life to it after he 
returned to England in 1929 and began the work which culminated in the 
"Philosophical Investigations," the most polished and influential of the later 
books. 
</P>
<P>
Here Wittgenstein rejects the classical view of philosophy as the attempt to 
answer ultimate questions. Philosophical problems, he writes, are not about 
matters of ultimate (or any kind of) fact; they arise from linguistic 
misunderstandings, from mistakes in logical grammar. The job of the 
philosopher, as he sees it, is to "command a clear view of the use of our 
words." Philosophy is not a theory, but an activity, "a battle against the 
bewitchment of our intelligence by language." 
</P>
<P>
Consider a question like "What is time?" Because it is similar in form to "What 
is dew?," it misleads us into looking for something we can point to or 
describe, as we would the dew. Thus the endless philosophical theories about 
the nature of time. The Wittgensteinian philosopher resists the "craving of 
generality." Instead of theorizing about time, he minutely examines how the 
word is used (how we teach it to children, for example), and is no longer 
puzzled. He can teach it, he can measure it, he can be on it. The meaning of 
time is not some mysterious metaphysical something, it is, roughly, its use in 
the language. 
</P>
<P>
Philosophy is a therapeutic enterprise, Wittgenstein believed, a set of related 
techniques for dispelling linguistic confusions. This approach seemed 
exhilarating and effective to many philosophers; others, including Bertrand 
Russell, condemned it as a cop-out, a refusal to think seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy persists. In "The Legacy of Wittgenstein," Anthony Kenny 
suggests that "Wittgensteinian philosophy as opposed to Wittgensteinian 
scholarship has not made progress, and some of the philosophical gains we owe 
to (him) seem in danger of being lost." 
</P>
<P>
During his lifetime, Wittgenstein was a cult figure in philosophy. In his 
lectures, he struggled visibly with his thoughts, which often were expressed in 
imaginative questions and aphorisms. His gestures and intonations were 
distinctive and much imitated; he feared, perhaps rightly, that his influence 
was destructive to his students. To him, the profession of philosophy was "a 
living death," but all he was fit for; he urged his students to take up 
something useful, like medicine or manual labor, especially if they were 
serious philosophers. (He himself worked as a gardener in a monastery, and as a 
hospital orderly in London during World War II.) Philosophy was worthless 
unless it helped you to live a morally better life. 
</P>
<P>
Wittgenstein did not permit "tourists" at his lectures, and the chances are, 
that's you. Monk is considerably more hospitable, yet travelers should expect a 
fairly rigorous journey. Nevertheless, the book is engrossing, especially if 
read in conjunction with Wittgenstein himself. In Monk's comprehensive account, 
certain features of Wittgenstein's thought seem remarkably current. He is 
deeply suspicious of science and scientism, more interested in differences than 
in similarities, against abstraction and for contextual interpretation. And 
always, spirit prevails. 
</P>
<P>
So what if he's tough. There are worse ways to spend the fin de siecle.
