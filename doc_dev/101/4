It must have seemed a splendid idea at the time - and Houston Grand Opera
during David Gockley's 20-year directorship, has consistently traded in
lively ideas about expanding the repertory, as the company track record
shows.
A specially commissioned new 'Beauty and the Beast' opera, Desert of Roses
by Robert Moran, was to be played in alternation with an updating of
Gretry's 1771 Zemire et Azor, which has the same theme. Both the new and the
old version of the fairytale would have English texts, the Zemire (by
Marmontel) translated by John Michael LaChiusa, the Desert of Roses
librettist. Both would be staged by John Dew, the Englishman resident in
Bielefeld. The Zemire production had originally been devised for that city;
the Desert is due to make the journey there later in the year.
A plausible package - but this time, alas, Houston's luck in arranging such
things ran out, for the wrapping proved both flashy and ill-finished, and
the contents, though in themselves by no means valueless, had been
injudiciously selected.
Last November Dew gave Covent Garden audiences that wretchedly empty,
poorly-warmed-over Les Huguenots in modern dress. In similar vein he had
conceived of Gretry's lovely, tender, sturdily fashioned opera-comique fable
(which Londoners remember from the 1981 Camden Festival revival) as an
exercise in pop updating, with the Beast as a rock-singer, Beauty's father a
vacuum-cleaner salesman, and other bits and bobs of added Americana.
The taste level was pitched low - so low, in fact, that Gockley (who
apparently acquired the staging sight unseen) asked for 11th-hour
improvements and amendments. At this point Dew left town, and both shows,
still credited to him, were patched together by assistants.
This Zemire may have amused those spectators who find the whole notion of
opera got up to look like bad television killingly funny - Dew's borrowings
from game shows, celebrity interviews and rock spectaculars were of
unwavering predictability. But it was still a distressing example of
Producer's Patronage - of an audience presumed stupid enough, and a work
presumed trashy enough, to need 'help' of this kind. Apart from praising the
bright-toned Zemire of Diana Amos, and relishing the promise of another
young soprano, Kimla Beasley, as her sister Fatime, one is probably well
advised to pass over the whole sorry thing without further comment.
Desert of Roses had a lot more going for it. Moran, a 54-year-old American
avant-gardist previously best known for his humorous music-theatre
extravagances (such his 1971 Hallelujah for 20 marching bands, 40 church
choirs, organs, carillons, rock and gospel groups, and the entire city of
Bethlehem, Pennsylvania), has come to 'straight' opera via The Juniper Tree
(1985), which he composed in collaboration with Philip Glass, and which HGO
performed in 1986.
He has stripped his 'Beauty' of conceptual posturing, experimentalist
pranks, and indeed of all avant-garderie; the score, written for
chamber-forces plus delicately used synthesisers, is catchy in what one
might call a minimalist-plus vein, with tootling um-cha-um-cha
accompaniments (well handled by the HGO music director John DeMain) layered
upon harmonies high in sugar content.
Moran writes well for voices, and knows how and where to place his numbers;
where he and LaChiusa showed their inexperience was in being seldom able to
get to the point, economically and quickly. Both on the comic family scenes
 -Beauty here has an ugly brother as well as two ugly sisters - and on those
of sentiment I found myself itching to wield an editor's pruning shears.
Because of this, and the sweet-toothed idiom, the whole work seemed blander
than it should or could have. But maybe the production was also to blame: it
was sad that the apt prettiness of the decor (designed by Heinz Balthes) had
not been matched by a similar aptness in the direction of the comedy
characters - gross clowning is clearly a John Dew trademark.
There were two fine young sopranos to note: Jayne West (Beauty) dewy-fresh
and appealing, Stella Zambalis (Woman, a narrator-chorus figure) strikingly
rich-toned. About this 'Beauty' at least, and for all its imperfections,
Houston need feel no embarrassment.
