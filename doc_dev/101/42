   President Bush broke his own speed
record on the Cape Arundel Golf Course Friday.
   Bush, teeing it up at 6:54 a.m., hustled around the par-69 links
course in 1:42, clipping nine minutes off his previous best.
   ``I understand he set a new aerobic golf record,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   There were only three in the presidential party: club pro Ken
Raynor Jr. and Bush's eldest son, George W. Bush, part-owner of the
Texas Rangers.
   ``We could set a record today,'' Bush predicted as he set out on
the dew-soaked, deserted course. He even provided a sports
monologue for the reporters out to watch him.
   ``Silence on the first tee,'' decreed the president as he
stepped up to address the ball. ``Mr. Smooth is back. They're all
wondering how this one will go.''
   Whack!
   ``... And he's not happy. Or is it up, Kenny?'' said Bush,
turning to his pro for a second opinion on the drive.
   By the time he got out of his golf cart on the 18th green, Bush
was not a happy man, speed record or no.
   ``I'm out of it. I did lousy,'' he confessed.
   It was his fourth golf outing since arriving in Maine Aug. 10 on
a vacation interrupted repeatedly by the gulf crisis.
