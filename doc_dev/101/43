It seems that no matter what happens, who wins, who loses, there is always a 
streak hanging in the balance with the Simi Valley High basketball team. When 
last heard from, the Pioneers had dropped their first Marmonte League game in 
their past 32, to Westlake on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But, as Simi Valley turned the corner Wednesday night and looked ahead to its 
second loop around the league, first-year Coach Dean Bradshaw and his Pioneers 
still have a rally cry. Trite, but to the point, it's "one more for four." 
</P>
<P>
"We're still trying to focus in on every game," Bradshaw said after the 
Pioneers beat Camarillo, 70-63, at Simi Valley to win their fifth league game 
in 6 tries and regain possession of first place. "We still talk about one more 
for four every day." 
</P>
<P>
And you thought it was getting tedious reading once in a while about the fact 
that the Pioneers are chasing their fourth consecutive league title. 
</P>
<P>
Every day? 
</P>
<P>
"We're in first place by ourselves right now," he added. "I hope we can say 
that at the end of the second round." 
</P>
<P>
A few more games for senior guard Jeff Marciano like the one he had against 
Camarillo, and Bradshaw's wishes will be Marciano's command. 
</P>
<P>
After making all 5 of his first-half field-goal attempts, Marciano was good on 
his first 4 in the second and finished with a game-high 28 points. They 
included 2 free throws with 16 seconds left that finished off a tenacious but 
depleted Camarillo team that entered the game 4-0 in league play. Simi Valley 
is 5-1 in league play and in front by a half-game. 
</P>
<P>
Marciano appeared to be the only player who remained focused in a wildly 
emotional game that saw 50 fouls called, 1 technical and 3 Scorpion starters 
foul out. 
</P>
<P>
"God, we were playing for first, it kind of means a lot," Marciano said of the 
intensity level. "You kind of get ticked off pretty easily." 
</P>
<P>
While everyone else got mad, Marciano kept Camarillo from getting even. 
</P>
<P>
The Scorpions, however, were in something of a hole from the start. David 
Harbour, who leads the team in scoring and assists and is second in rebounding, 
missed the game because of an injured left ankle. He probably will not play 
against Newbury Park on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Add to Harbour's absence point guard Rick Schnell's bruised knee in the third 
quarter that forced him to sit out most of the fourth and the foul troubles of 
forwards Frank Dews and Scott Foster. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously David adds a lot for their team from the perimeter," Bradshaw said. 
"That gives them one less bullet to fire with." 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo responded with balanced scoring that brought it back from a 58-50 
fourth-quarter deficit to within 62-60 with 2:10 remaining. However, Simi 
Valley's Steve Carnes hit 4 consecutive free throws followed by 2 from 
Marciano. The Pioneers made 25 of 30 free throws, compared to 17 of 33 for 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
"We never really executed well," Camarillo Coach John Harbour said. "We did 
some good things individually, but we never did execute well." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley, streaky as ever, ended up making 21 of 37 field-goal attempts. 
Camarillo made just 21 of 54.
