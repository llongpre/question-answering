FT  07 JUL 93 / Observer: Eyeing up 3i
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There may be no such thing as bad publicity but 3i, Europe's largest venture
capital company, has decided that enough is enough. Battered by reports of
its on-off flotation and bruised by comment about its inability to keep a
chairman, it has decided that its image needs management.
Charles Richardson, 39, who has worked for 3i for 12 years and is currently
regional director for the north and Scotland, has been appointed 3i's first
director of corporate affairs.
Hard to know whether this is a promotion or a sideways move for Richardson.
But there is rather less ambiguity about the role of Shandwick, whose
long-term relationship with 3i has been one of the few fixtures in the
fickle pr world. Dewe Rogerson, brought in to handle 3i's much delayed
flotation, seems to be emerging as the senior media adviser, which must be
all rather humiliating for what used to be the world's biggest pr company.
After all it was 3i which gave Shandwick its first big break in business.
