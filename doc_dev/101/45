<TEXT>
It has taken Britain's wider share ownership gang such an awfully long time
to relaunch itself that it should have been able to think up a more catchy
title than Proshare.
The search for a new name and logo has been 'a bit like establishing Brand X
or Daz,' says one insider. 'We have got to establish an image and get people
identifying the services they want with that image.' Dewe Rogerson, no less,
has been helping with the image building and on Thursday all will be
revealed at a glitzy press conference. Is Proshare any relation to Proned,
the non-executive directors pressure group?
