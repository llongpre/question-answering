FT  08 SEP 93 / Observer: Poetic justice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual Trades Union Congress has long been a dispiriting affair; this
year's in Brighton is no exception. The proceedings are passionless and
rigidly stage-managed. The conference has had its moments though, including
one memorably poetic exchange yesterday.
Summing up a debate about labour legislation, Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU's
national officer in Scotland, ended by quoting from the Mask of Anarchy by
Percy Bysshe Shelley:
'Rise like lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number -
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you.'
But Arthur Scargill, the miners' leader, arguing for more militant
opposition to the government's employment legislation, politely pointed out
that Airlie had missed the final line of the verse: 'Ye are many - they are
few.'
It is no coincidence that the two men know that verse from the revolutionary
old Etonian poet so well. It once adorned the membership card of the Young
Communist League - of which both were members.
