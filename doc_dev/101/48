   An FBI agent shot and killed an off-duty
firefighter after the firefighter refused to drop an AK-47 assault
rifle while struggling with another agent, authorities said.
   The firefighter and three FBI agents were among a group
preparing to go scuba diving, police said.
   Steven Lopez, 38, of Staten Island, was pronounced dead at the
scene of Sunday's shooting, said Officer Hugh Barry, a police
spokesman.
   Agent Richard Tait, who fired the fatal shot, remained on duty,
and the bureau began an investigation, as is routine in such cases,
said FBI spokesman Joseph Valiquette.
   Tait was to receive scuba training on the dive, Valiquette said.
   As the men prepared to dive, Lopez got into a struggle with
Agent John R. Dew, Valiquette said. Lopez was holding the rifle
during the struggle and it discharged once without hurting anyone,
the spokesman said.
   Tait drew his service revolver and ordered Lopez to drop his
gun, then shot him in the chest, Valiquette said. The spokesman
didn't offer a motive for the confrontation.
   Asked if the shooting was deemed justified, Valiquette said,
``There is nothing that would indicate anything to the contrary at
this point.''
