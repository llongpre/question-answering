   Nintendo of America Inc. will get a hand from
Pepsi-Cola Co. in promoting its portable video ``Game Boy'' that
analysts say could be one of the most popular presents under
Christmas trees this year.
   But Nintendo says the transistor radio-sized, handheld device
has such blockbuster potential that the company won't have enough
of them this Christmas to meet even half of the projected demand.
   ``We expect to sell out,'' said Bill White, director of
advertising and public relations for the U.S. subsidiary of Japan's
Nintendo Co. Ltd.
   White said Nintendo forecasts the holiday demand for Game Boy at
2 million to 2.5 million units. Nintendo will ship just over 1
million units, and another 4 million to 5 million next year, he
said.
   Pepsi and Nintendo announced Tuesday they would team up in a
two-month promotion starting Nov. 1 during which Pepsi will award
more than 4,000 Game Boys to consumers.
   For Pepsi, the campaign could be a bonanza if it encourages many
more consumers to buy Pepsi beverages for a chance to obtain what
could become a hard-to-find holiday gift.
   ``We hope to be in the forefront of consumers' minds during the
holidays,'' Pepsi-Cola spokesman Tod MacKenzie said Tuesday. ``We
hope to make the Pepsi brand name synonymous with the hottest toy
of the holiday season.''
   Toy industry analysts agree that Nintendo appears to have
another big hit on its hands with Game Boy, which retails for
$89.95. Nintendo's entertainment system that turns a television
into a game screen dominates the home-computer-game business.
   Angela Bourdon, spokeswoman for retailer Toys R Us, said Game
Boy has been a strong seller since its release in August.
   ``It's the No. 1 best seller for Christmas,'' she said. ``Hands
down.''
   Kathy Ellis, a retail analyst with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in New
York, had a similar view. ``The Game Boy is going to have a
tremendous Christmas,'' she said.
   Added Frank Reysen, editor of Playthings Magazine, ``People are
asking if this is the next Cabbage Patch,'' referring to the dolls
that were a toy industry sensation in the mid-1980s.
   Reysen said he doubts Game Boy will achieve megahit status in
the same league as the Cabbage Patch dolls. With such a hefty
pricetag, Game Boy won't be for everyone.
   But Reysen said Game Boy could trigger a turnaround in the
handheld video game category, which has been in the doldrums for
several years. Game Boy uses interchangeable cartridges _ but not
the same ones as used on Nintendo's regular TV-based system.
   Pepsi's $10 million promotion with Nintendo will be supported by
radio and television advertisements plus in-store,
point-of-purchase displays. Pepsi said it would create special TV
and radio ads for network and local broadcasts.
   Customers will have a chance at winning a Game Boy or certain
other items through an instant-win, under-the-cap giveaway on
specially marked packages of Pepsi products. The other prizes
include Nintendo Action Sets, U-Force Remotes for use with the
Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo Game Paks, $5 Nintendo
vouchers and free coupons for two-liter Pepsi products.
   The contest will be featured on 16-oz. non-returnable,
one-liter, two-liter and three-liter packages of Pepsi, Diet Pepsi,
both diet and regular Caffeine Free Pepsi, Moutain Dew and
Lemon-Lime Slice.
   Pepsi is hoping this year's holiday promotion will have results
similar to last year's, when Pepsi sponsored the home video release
of MCA-Universal's ``E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial'' and offered
special $5 rebates.
   According to Pepsi, the 1988 promotion generated a record 1.6
million rebates and helped ``E.T.'' become the highest-selling home
video in history.
