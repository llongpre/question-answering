<HEAD>Ingersoll Extends Bond Offer Deadline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Ingersoll Newspapers Inc. said Monday it
is extending until May 11 the deadline for its offer to buy back
$159 million in high-yield junk bonds.
   No shares were tendered by the previous May 4 deadline, said
Stanley J. Kay, vice president of Dewe Rogerson Inc., a financial
public relations firm representing Ingersoll.
   Terms of the deal were unchanged.
   Ingersoll has offered to buy back up to 80 percent of $125
million worth of bonds for 55 cents on the dollar. It also would
pay 25 cents on the dollar for 51 percent of $115 million in bonds
that won't start paying interest until June 1991.
   The bonds, issued at 13 percent interest, have been selling at
40 cents on the dollar. The reset provision would require Ingersoll
to raise the interest rate on June 30 that the bonds would sell at
$1.01.
   Ingersoll owns 19 daily newspapers. Analysts say the company is
under pressure of a June 30 deadline to reset its interest rate to
restore the value of the notes to face amount.
