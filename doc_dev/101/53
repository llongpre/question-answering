<HEAD>Pepsi's Profit Soared 46 Percent In First Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Soft drinks giant PepsiCo Tuesday reported a 45.7 percent surge
in first-quarter income, reflecting strong results in each of the
company's three divisions.
   It marked the eighth straight quarter in which PepsiCo's
earnings, excluding one-time gains and charges, have grown by 25
percent or more.
   PepsiCo said its profit rose to 165.1 million, or 62 cents a
share, in the 12 weeks ended March 25 from $113.3 million, or 43
cents a share, in the comparable 1988 period.
   Excluding a $14.5 million pre-tax charge for the reorganization
of PepsiCo's domestic soft drink business in 1988's first quarter,
the latest quarterly earnings gain came to 33 percent.
   Sales totaled $2.96 billion in the first quarter, up 19.3
percent from $2.48 billion a year earlier.
   Worldwide restaurant sales expanded by 27 percent to $1.07
billion from $844.5 million. PepsiCo owns Pizza Huts, Kentucky
Fried Chicken outlets and Taco Bell restaurants.
   Soft drink sales went up by 18 percent to $1.05 billion from
$893 million. Domestic results were buoyant and international
profits in the soft drink division doubled. Sales of Diet Pepsi and
Moutain Dew brands were particularly strong while sales of regular
Pepsi were flat.
   Sales of snack foods rose 12 percent to $830.8 million from
$741.4 million. Robust growth in sales of corn-based items, such as
Doritos, Fritos and Cheetos, was partially offset by declines in
the volume of potato-based products due to drought-related
allocations of potato supplies early in the quarter.
