<TEXT>
Gerry Grimstone, who joined Schroders from the Treasury seven years ago, has
moved out of the investment banking division to head the newly created
international financing and advisory department. Whereas investment banking
handles UK mergers and acquisitions and flotations as well as overseas M &amp; A
work in those countries where the bank has a local presence, Grimstone's new
domain has taken charge of equity capital market activities worldwide.
Current assignments include advising the Greek government on the
privatisation of the telecommunications company OTE and the Italians on the
INA life assurance company sell-off.
Grimstone's department falls within the new international finance division
under group managing director William Slee. Bernard Dewe Mathews, who looks
after international projects and contractor advisory and financing
activities, heads the other department, to be known as the international
projects department.
