<HEAD>Hedgehogs and Barristers Suffer in the Heat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Barristers were allowed to doff their heavy wigs
and animal lovers fretted over thirsty hedgehogs as Britain
sweltered in a heat wave Friday.
   Temperatures reached 90 degrees in Oxfordshire _ not all that
hot by standards in some parts of the world, but enough to pose a
problem for hedgehogs.
   The Vale Wildlife Rescue Centre said it had treated a dozen
dehydrated hedgehogs this week, and appealed for people to put out
bowls of water for them.
   ``Unlike other animals they can't travel large distances in
search of water and the nights are so dry there is never any dew,''
said Caroline Gould at the hedgehog hospice in Corpthorne, in
western England.
   To slake human thirsts, Young's Brewery in London announced it
would operate through the weekend _ for only the second time since
World War II. A company spokeswoman said beer sales had ``gone
through the roof'' during the hot weather.
   In Wales, Cardiff Crown Court Judge John Rutter gave barristers
permission to take off their bristly ceremonial wigs and gowns
Friday. The judge, however, sweltered in the traditional way, with
his wig in place.
