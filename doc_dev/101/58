<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; SHOW; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  MOJO NIXON, the joker-troubadour whose rabid folk-blues music could best be
described as neo-aboriginal crypto-populist white soul, has a trio of acoustic
solo gigs this week -- Sunday at the Paradise Lounge, Monday at the Cactus
Club and Wednesday at the Catalyst. The first show, with the Diablos, is a
freebie. Among other things, Nixon claims to be "The Most High Potentate of
the Nevada Synod of the Screaming Church of Otis" and believes that Tanqueray
Gin, Cheez Whiz and Mountain Dew are three of the four basic food groups.;   
(box) Memories are made of this: The Buzzcocks, the great British band that
fused the fury of raw punk with the sensibilities of mod music, had such a
successful reunion tour last year they're doing it again -- Sunday at One Step
Beyond and Monday at the I Beam.  </LEADPARA>
