   The U.S. Southern Command Monday
identified eight of nine people killed when a military helicopter
crashed last week in a thunderstorm in a jungle.
   The helicopter and a second one crashed Wednesday while on a
training flight near Punta Diego, about 50 miles southwest of
Colon, on the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal.
   The Southern Command disclosed the names of the two men on the
second helicopter on Friday.
   It issued a news release Monday that identified three of the
four crew members on the first helicopter, a UH-1H, as 1st Warrant
Officers Vincent Gibson and Richard Block, and Spec. Joel L.
Meints. It said the name of the fourth was being withheld until
relatives were notified.
   All four belonged to Company B, 1st Battalion, of U.S. Army
South's 228 Airborne Regiment in Panama.
   The five passengers aboard were identified as Sgts. Sidney T.
Dew and Antonio B. Solis, Specs. Rodney L. Blodgett and Kirk M.
Magill and Pvt. 2 Charles D. Allison.
   They were members of Company B, 3rd Battalion, 17th Infantry,
7th Light Infantry Division, with headquarters at Fort Ord, Calif,
according to the news release.
   The Southern Command did not disclose the ages or hometowns of
any of the men.
   Those killed on the second helicopter, an OH-58 observation
aircraft, were Capt. Richard D. Tyndall and Warrant Officer James
W. Carl, the pilot.
   Carl was assigned to the Panamanian company and Tyndall to the
Fort Ord company.
   The helicopters, based in Fort Kobbe, belonged to the Panamanian
company.
   The Southern Command said last week that the crashes are under
investigation but that sabotage was not suspected.
