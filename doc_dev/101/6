FT  01 SEP 93 / People: Dew quits Thornton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The weekend departure of Peter Dew from his post of managing director at
Thornton group, the fund manager owned by Dresdner Bank, was 'entirely
amicable and friendly and to do with a change in the management system,'
according to Lord Peter Walker, the former cabinet minister who chairs the
group.
'There is no longer any real role for a conventional chief executive,' says
Lord Walker, who wants to see Thornton engage itself more actively in
Europe, with funds jointly managed in, for example, Paris, Frankfurt and
London. 'We will be producing more European products and I see expansion
both there and in the Far East.'
Dew has long been regarded as a leading figure in Far East investment, and
joined Thornton in 1988 after a period running his own property business.
Among his positions before that had been a 16-year stint as director of
Mercury Asset Management.
Thornton has plans to acquire Aetna UK's unit trust business and Lord Walker
says 'we will be making a number of other expansions and acquisitions, and I
want to bring in a younger generation to manage the business over the next
15 years or so. I have made sure that Peter Dew has been treated very
generously; the parting has been very amicable.'
