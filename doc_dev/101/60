When it was new in 1987 David Pountney's staging of Hansel and Gretel seemed
a rare stroke of operatic inspiration, an unforgettable piece of
re-invention which opened up Humperdinck's opera to a new set of resonances.
Now, on its second revival at ENO (overseen by David Sulkin) the spell is
less potent. There are still many incidental delights, and continued
evidence of the thoughtful preparation that informed the production from the
start, but the spark of enchantment is missing and the weak points in the
concept have become less easy to accept.
There was, always, the feeling that Pountney's painstaking post-war
reworking was pandering to the fortysomethings' nostalgia for the
coin-in-the-slot gas meters and wardrobe-sized refrigerators of their
childhood. Instead of universalising this little tale of redemption he had
given it a frisson of recognition for his own generation, overladen with the
heavy hint of family violence and child abuse.
All that, and the stage pictures it created, saw the production through its
stickier patches. No one could pretend that the final scene with the
Witch/Mother was a polished and convincing piece of theatre: Gretel's fussy
wanderings around the house, Hansel's casual escape from his cage and their
contrived tumbling of the Witch into the cooker seemed decidedly
half-hearted. But such moments were banished by the memory of the pantomime
sequence, its parade of familiar figures - postman, policeman, courting
couple - dusted in radiant, make-believe white to conjure up a wonderful
tableaux, which transformed the everyday image into the escapist dream.
That first-act ending remains a bewitching piece of theatre, but on
Wednesday the rest of the evening only sporadically caught the same spirit.
It was sensitively but all rather placidly conducted by Lionel Friend; one
sensed the Wagnerian echoes being pinpointed and gently emphasised rather
than left to contribute to the whole unselfconscious effect. The stage
action too seemed respectful rather than wholeheartedly engaged; only Ethna
Robinson's Hansel, the single survivor from the 1987 cast, went about her
business with real zeal and spirit.
The remainder of the cast, though, was much more than adequate, merely short
of an ounce of vividness. Rose Mannion's Gretel was beautifully sung, just a
little too prim for a production that sets out to demonstrate the grinding
consequences of deprivation. As the Mother Phyllis Cannan caught that
downtrodden feeling well; as the Witch she wisely never went over the top.
Donald Maxwell is now the Father, smartly besuited in pointed contrast to
his wife's grimy pinafore. Julie Gossage and Yvonne Barclay provide sharp
cameos of the Sandman and the Dew Fairy; certainly some of their magic
remains in this intriguing production.
