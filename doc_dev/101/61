'Ten years ago I was a tank commander based in West Germany. If anyone had
told me that a decade later I would be swapping vodka toasts with Russian
tax officials in St Petersburg, I would have said they were mad.'
Now 36, Stuart Leasor hops round east Europe, helping governments spend
European Union grants on public relations campaigns to persuade recalcitrant
citizens to pay their taxes.
He persuaded the Polish finance ministry that publishing a 100-page guide to
the new tax laws for every household was not a great idea - Poland ended up
gathering 7 per cent more VAT than it had hoped for; saved 450,000 Ecus by
running a successful Bulgarian VAT pr campaign rather more cheaply than
anyone imagined possible; and has made sure that all 89 oblasts in Russia
now have a tax information office.
His small pr firm - Woodstock Leasor, formed with Sarah Tubbs, formerly of
Dewe Rogerson - now has people working throughout eastern Europe; clearly he
thinks prospects are good. He must - he's planning to marry a Kazakh working
in Kiev.
