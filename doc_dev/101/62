<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   PepsiCo Inc. said Tuesday its earnings for the
second quarter rose 10 percent from a year ago on a 17 percent
sales gain, led by double-digit advances in the snack food and
restaurant divisions.
   The company, whose largest business is soft drinks, said it
earned $292.5 million, or $1.10 a share, in the three months ended
June 16 compared with $264.9 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose to $4.20 billion from $3.59 billion
a year earlier.
   The latest results were reduced by a $5.5 million after-tax
charge resulting from a customer bankruptcy, while the 1989 results
were boosted by $22.2 million mainly resulting from the company's
decision to keep rather than sell a bottling operation in Japan.
   Soft-drink sales rose 8 percent to $1.6 billion but operating
profit fell 3 percent to $233.2 million.
   If one-time items are excluded from both years, operating profit
from soft drinks would have been up 15 percent.
   Domestic soft drink sales rose 5 percent, including a 4 percent
gain in bottler case sales that were driven by double-digit growth
in the Diet Pepesi products, strong gains in Mountain Dew and a
solid Pepsi brand performance.
   International soft drink sales rose 23 percent.
   Snack foods sales climbed 24 percent to $1.2 billion, including
sales from Smiths and Walkers acquired last year, while operating
profit rose 18 percent to $226.2 million.
   Excluding Smiths and Walkers and onetime items in both years,
sales and operating profit would have each risen 12 percent.
   Domestic sales rose 6 percent, while international sales more
than doubled, helped by a strong volume increases and lower
commodity costs. Its brands include Chee-tos, Santitas and Crunch
Tators.
   Restaurant sales rose 22 percent to $1.4 billion while operating
profit rose 36 percent to $228.6 million. Excluding the impact od
onetime items, operating profit would risen 25 percent.
   Sales rose 25 percent to $676 million at the Pizza Hut chain, 21
percent to $399 million at Taco Bell and 18 percent to $358 million
at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
   For the first half, PepsiCo said it earned $474.4 million, or
$1.78 a share, up 10.2 percent from $430.0 million, or $1.62 a
share, a year ago.
   Revenue for the first half rose 20 percent to $7.88 billion from
$6.55 billion a year earlier.
