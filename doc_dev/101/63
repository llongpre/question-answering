   As expected, Neil J. Weisman, president of Chilmark
Capital Corp., and Robert I. Cohen have demanded a list of
UJB Financial Corp. shareholders from the company.
   Last month, Messrs. Weisman and Cohen said they intended
to solicit proxies for the election of nominees to UJB
Financial's board. They also said that they had retained the
proxy-soliciting firm of Dewe Rogerson Inc. and that they
would seek to obtain a copy of the list of UJB shareholders.

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the investors said that last Wednesday, Chilmark Capital
Partners L.P., Chilmark Capital Corp. Profit Sharing Plan and
Chilmark Offshore Capital Fund Ltd., owners of 4,119,200 UJB
shares, or a 9% stake in the company, demanded a list of
shareholders and other information pertaining to shareholders
from UJB.
   The filing said that the purpose of the demand is to
permit Messrs. Weisman and Cohen to communicate with other
UJB shareholders on matters of mutual interest, including
communicating with shareholders regarding solicitation of
proxies for use at the meeting of UJB shareholders scheduled
for April 20.
