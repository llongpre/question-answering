<LEADPARA>  Things go better with Coke. But how about rooms?;   The Village company thinks
they might. So they've come out with vinyl wallpaper patterned with old
Coca-Cola ads, logos and commercial illustrations. "Refresh -- add zest to
your hour!" the apple-cheeked models exult. "It's the pause that refreshes!"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It costs about $16 a roll, and you can call (800) 552-9255 for ordering
information. Then sit down in an easy chair and marvel at all those
apple-cheeked folks adding zest to their life with a shot of high-fructose
corn syrup and some caffeine. And see just how quickly the pause that
refreshes can make any room in your house look like a pizza parlor.;   It's a
start. But is it the end? Or is it just a matter of time before soft drinks
start looking for hard cash in merchandising, and we see Wink eye-wear,
Mountain Dew deodorant and Nehi stockings?  </TEXT>
