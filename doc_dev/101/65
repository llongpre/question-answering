A second round of British Rail franchises is expected to be announced later
this week as the government steps up its campaign to privatise the BR
network.
Eighteen of the 25 passenger franchises have still to be announced although
it is understood that only between five and 10 will be included in this
week's statement.
Labour yesterday revealed that the Office of the Franchising Director was
looking to appoint marketing consultants to help with the sale of
franchises. Dewe Rogerson, the public relations consultancy, is already
advising the transport department on rail sell-offs.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour's transport spokesman, said: 'This is a desperate
measure which reveals they are not getting much interest in buying.'
The franchising director's office confirmed that it was seeking professional
marketing advice on how to approach potential franchisees. 'This is a normal
appointment,' said Mr Peter McDermott, head of public affairs.
The first seven franchises, including East Coast Main Line, Gatwick Express,
London-Tilbury-Southend and ScotRail, were announced in February 1993.
Responses to the invitation to bid must be in by the end of this week.
