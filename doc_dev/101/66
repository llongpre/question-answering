<P>
Three weeks ago Greg Welch was in Phoenix with fellow Australian Simon 
Skillicorn. The two were preparing for a triathlon, eyeing the course a day 
before the race when the car they were parked in was broadsided by another car 
being driven at 50 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
Skillicorn suffered a broken neck. Welch came away with two cracked ribs and 
two more separated from the spine. 
</P>
<P>
No, they didn't run the next day. Skillicorn won't be running for quite some 
time and on Friday when doctors looked at Welch's X-rays, they advised him not 
to even train. 
</P>
<P>
But there was Welch, all smiles, no indication of fatigue and giving the 
thumbs-up sign in the middle of the 10-kilometer run along Harbor Drive, the 
last event in Sunday's Mountain Dew Sport San Diego International Triathlon. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, doctors said don't train, but they didn't bar him from competing. So 
Welch competed. 
</P>
<P>
At that midway point in the 10K, Welch had a 30-second lead over Miles Stewart, 
also from Australia, and Scott Molina of Boulder, Colo. It was more than 
apparent he was going to win the race, which also consisted of a one-kilometer 
swim and 30 kilometers on bike. Welch, 25, did so in a course record of 
1:27:27. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Tinley's old record was 1:27:42. 
</P>
<P>
"That was for Simon," Welch said after the victory. "I did it all for him." 
</P>
<P>
Welch was not the only one to set a course record and then proceed to tell a 
story about how quickly the human body can mend itself. Paula Newby-Fraser's 
story is not so dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
By finishing in 1:34:56, Newby-Fraser, a Zimbabwe transplant who now lives in 
Encinitas, eclipsed her own course record of 1:37:16. 
</P>
<P>
As it was for Welch, this was a surprise considering Newby-Fraser spent the 
previous six days recovering from the Nice Triathlon, which she won just a week 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
And recover is the applicable word. It took Newby-Fraser 6 1/2 hours to finish 
the Nice event, which consisted of four kilometers in water, 75 miles on bike 
and 20 miles on foot. 
</P>
<P>
By winning in France, Newby-Fraser cashed a $12,000 check. For winning in San 
Diego, she earned $1,500, as did Welch. The second-place finishers, Stewart 
(1:27:55) and Erin Baker (1:37:53), got $1,000 and the third-place finishers, 
Scott Molina (1:28:04) and Joan Alley (1:41:15), picked up $750.
