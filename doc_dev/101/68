   Pepsico on Thursday reported its profits for the
third quarter jumped 27 percent on increased sales of its soft
drinks and snack foods and on a lower tax rate.
   The Purchase, N.Y.-based company said it earned $241.6 million,
or 91 cents a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up from $189.9
million, or 72 cents a share a year ago.
   Sales during the period totaled $3.24 billion, up 12 percent
from $2.90 billion in the third quarter of 1987.
   In addition to volume and margin improvements, Pepsico
attributed its strong performance to a decline in the U.S.
corporate tax rate.
   In the soft drinks division, sales rose 15 percent amid
increased shipments worldwide, improved operating margins overseas
and the acquisition of domestic bottling operations. The company
highlighted increased sales of Diet Pepsi, Mountain Dew and Pepsi.
   Sales of snack foods advanced 8 percent, partly due to an
improved performance at Frito Lay. Pepsico said restaurant sales
were up 11 percent, led by growth at Kentucky Fried Chicken and
Pizza Hut. but earnings at Taco Bell declined.
   Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive officer, noted that
the company's international businesses emerged as ``solid
contributors to our growth.''
   For the year to date, Pepsico reported net income of $574.5
million, or $2.18 a share, up 28 percent from $447.8 million, or
$1.70 a share a year ago. Excluding operations discontinued last
year, income was up 25 percent.
   Sales for the first nine months totaled $8.82 billion, up 11
percent from $7.93 billion in the year-ago period.
