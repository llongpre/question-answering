   Pepsico Inc. said Wednesday its first quarter
profit jumped 64 percent, citing robust growth in soft drink and
restaurant volume, continued strength in snack foods and a lower
tax rate.
   The company, which is based in Purchase, N.Y., said its profit
rose to $113.3 million, or 43 cents a share, in the three months
ended March 19 compared with a profit of $68.9 million, or 26 cents
a share, a year earlier.
   First quarter sales rose 13.2 percent to $2.57 billion from
$2.27 billion a year earlier.
   The latest results included a one-time charge of $14.5 million
before taxes for the reorganization of the domestic soft drink
business.
   The company said its earnings from soft drinks rose 9 percent on
an 11 percent rise in sales.
   It said case sales by domestic bottlers rose 7 percent,
including double-digit growth in Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew, while
case sales internationally rose 5 percent, including strong gains
in Asia, Canada and the Middle East.
   In the snack food business, Pepsico said its earnings rose 17
percent on a 7 percent sales increase. The division markets the
Frito-Lay brands.
   Pepsico's restaurant operations posted 31 percent earnings
growth on a 21 percent sales increase as average sales per domestic
restaurant rose 6 percent.
   The company said Pizza Hut had improved delivery results, while
domestic Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants posted higher average
sales per store, partly due to the introduction of Chicken Littles
last summer.
   Earnings from Taco Bell restaurants fell, howewer, in comparison
with a strong first quarter in 1987, the company said.
