INSTITUTIONS consider a company's environmental record before deciding
whether to buy its shares, according to a survey released yesterday by Dewe
Rogerson, the public-relations and marketing group.
Dewe-Rogerson said that, of 80 senior fund managers interviewed, 40 per cent
said the question was an important factor in their decisions.
A further 58 per cent said a coherent and effective environmental strategy
enhanced their view of a company, Dewe-Rogerson continued.
It said 67 per cent believed environmental factors had a significant effect
on a company's business.
Only 11 per cent believed they were unimportant, said Dewe-Rogerson.
