   PepsiCo Inc.'s fiscal-second-quarter net income rose 16% on a 9.3% sales increase, reflecting continued volume gains and profit-margin improvements in its three main businesses. 

   Net for the fiscal quarter ended June 11 grew to $219.6 million, or 84 cents a share, from $189 million, or 72 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Profit was up 29% excluding year-earlier one-time gains totaling $18.5 million from sales of certain operations. 
A lower tax rate also aided net. 
Sales rose to $3.01 billion from $2.76 billion. 

   "We're very pleased . . . since results from last year's comparable period were exceptionally strong," said D. Wayne Calloway, chairman and chief executive officer of PepsiCo, whose businesses are soft drinks, snack foods and restaurants. 

   Soft-drink sales grew 9%, and earnings from continuing operations advanced 15%. 
U.S. bottler case sales increased 4% because of growth in Mountain Dew, Diet Pepsi and Pepsi brands. 

   Earnings from continuing snack-food operations grew 10% on a 5% sales rise, reflecting improvement at Frito-Lay and strong international growth. 

   Restaurant earnings from continuing operations surged 18% on sales growth of 13%. 
Domestic restaurants again led the way, with higher average sales for each store at both Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken. 

   A spokesman said the company is comfortable with analysts' estimates that 1988 profit will be about $2.80 a share. 
That would indicate an increase of about 24% from profit of $594.8 million, or $2.26 a share, on sales of $11.49 billion for the year ended Dec. 26. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, PepsiCo closed at $35.625 a share, down 12.5 cents.
