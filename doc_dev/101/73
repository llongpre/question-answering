   Pepsico Inc. said its third-quarter earnings
rose 25 percent as all of its businesses posted sales and profit
gains.
   The soft drink, food and restaurant company said it earned
$336.6 million, or 42 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept.
8, up from $269.3 million, or 34 cents per share, in the same
period of 1989.
   Revenue increased to $4.48 billion from $3.9 billion.
   Pepsico said its soft drink business had an 11 percent revenue
gain, to $1.7 billion, while operating profits in that division
rose 16 percent to $239.3 million.
   The company said its U.S. soft drink operations chalked up gains
despite the loss of business from Burger King fast-food
restaurants, which switched to Coca-Cola soft drinks from Pepsico's
brands. Pepsico's soft drinks include Pepsi-Cola, Diet Pepsi and
Mountain Dew.
   Pepsico said revenue from its snack food business rose 16
percent to $1.2 billion, while operating profits were up 14 percent
to $240.6 million.
   The company's snack food brands include Doritos, Tostitos,
Crunch Tators and Santitas.
   The firm's restaurant business recorded an 18 percent gain in
revenue, to $1.5 billion. Operating profits increased 6 percent to
$147.3 million, after $17.6 million was deducted for the closing of
unprofitable restaurants.
   Pepsico's restaurants include Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell
and Pizza Hut.
   For the first nine months of the year, Pepsico reported earnings
of $811 million, or $1.01 per share, up from $699.3 million, or 88
cents per share, in the same period of 1989.
   Revenue for the three quarters rose to $12.36 billion from
$10.45 billion.
