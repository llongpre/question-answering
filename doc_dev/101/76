  [Excerpt] This is a report on the National Army of 
Democratic Kampuchea [NADK] and the people routing the second 
military operation launched by troops of the Vietnamese 
communist puppets and two-headed government at Anlung Veng. 
  1. At the end of January, the Vietnamese communist puppets 
and two-headed government which oppose national reconciliation 
and the five-point advice of His Majesty King Norodom Sihanouk 
mobilized a large number of troops, tanks, armored personnel 
carriers, and war materiel to launch an offensive in the 
direction of Anlung Veng. But the NADK and Cambodian people 
routed this large-scale military operation on 31 January. 
  As a result, the NADK and people killed or wounded over 100 
troops of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed 
government, captured seven tanks, and destroyed 36 military 
trucks and armored personnel carriers. 
  2. The party of Democratic Kampuchea [PDK] as well as the 
Cambodian nation and people have drawn many experiences in 
dealing with enemies, old or new. That is, whether they are 
old or new enemies, they will always make another attempt after 
suffering a defeat. 
  As a matter of fact, on 3 and 4 February, the Vietnamese 
communist puppets and two-headed government mobilized another 
batch of 3,000 troops consisting mostly of routed troops from 
the 286th Division, 4th Military Zone, Kompong Thom Provincial 
unit; 5th Division; 41st and 43d Independent Regiments of the 
Vietnamese communist puppets; and Para forces, including those 
from ANKI [National Army of Independent Cambodia] and other Para 
groups from the 11th, 9th, and 3d Divisions and from the new 7th 
and 8th Divisions. All these infantrymen were escorted by many 
military trucks, tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, 
and multiple rocket launchers. 
  This second large-scale military operation launched under 
the 
direct command of Ke Kimyan, Pol Saroeun, Long Sopheap, Prum 
Samen, and Keo Pisit, who are star-spangled Army chiefs, and a 
number of other generals with second-hand stars was aimed at 
pushing into Anlung Veng once again. These high-ranking 
officers directly commanded the offensive because the two-headed 
government's troops from both the Vietnamese communist puppets' 
group and American-supported forces were ordered by the 
Vietnamese communists and their allies and the two-headed 
government that they must overtake Anlung Veng. 
  Their slogan is to mobilize tanks, artillery, and troops to 
launch a blitz and then take pictures of Anlung Veng for use in 
their propaganda in the international arena. They told their 
troops to attack and withdraw at once and open the way (?to move 
backward). 
  3. On 3 and 4 February, the attacking forces of the 
Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed government began 
their second offensive on Anlung Veng. 
  The NADK and Cambodian people prepared to welcome the 
criminal aggressors in advance. As soon as they arrived, the 
NADK and people immediately attacked and smashed them for the 
second time. 
  As a result of the attack and routing of this second 
military 
offensive, the NADK and Cambodian people destroyed four tanks 
and a multiple rocket launcher, killing or wounding over 300 
troops of the Vietnamese communist puppets and two-headed 
government, and totally smashing the command headquarters of 
Prum Samen, Long Sopheap, and Keo Pisit. Moreover, the hundreds 
of Vietnamese communist puppet, ANKI, and other Para soldiers 
who have continued deserting the battlefield in groups for fear 
of the combat, malaria, and especially being unable to endure 
the shortage of food, water, and medicine and their daily 
exposure to the sun and the dew have fled in the direction of 
Route 68 and Siem Reap Province. Most of those deserters were 
very weary and could hardly walk. Some others dropped dead as 
soon as they reached Route 68 and Siem Reap. [passage omitted]
