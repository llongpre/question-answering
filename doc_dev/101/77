<HEAD>TW Services Drops Pepsi-Cola From Hardee's, Canteen Operations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   TW Services Inc., one of the nation's largest
food service companies, said Friday that it was dropping Pepsi-Cola
Co. products from its 465 Hardee's restaurants.
   Coca-Cola Co. had been the primary supplier for those
restaurants and will continue in that role, the Spartanburg,
S.C.-based company said.
   TW Services is the largest franchisee of Hardee's Food Systems
Inc., which owns or franchises 3,300 restaurants nationwide and
already counts Coca-Cola as its primary soft drink syrup supplier.
   As a Hardee's franchisee, TW Services was free to make its own
arrangements on soft drinks for its restaurants.
   Earlier this week, Burger King Corp. said it planned to switch
to Coca-Cola as the soft drink supplier for its 5,400 restaurants,
dumping Pepsi-Cola after an association of more than six years.
   Karen Randall, a spokeswoman for TW Services, said her company's
465 Hardee's restaurants have been offering several Coca-Cola
drinks along with the Pepsi brand and, in some cases, Pepsi's
Mountain Dew.
   But she said the company decided that consolidating its business
with Coca-Cola would improve operating efficiency.
   She declined to say how much business Pepsi-Cola stands to lose
as a result of the decision. The changeover will take several
months.
   TW Services said it also had designated Coca-Cola as the primary
supplier for its Canteen contract food service operations.
   The Canteen division has more than 1,600 accounts at sites
ranging from school cafeterias to industrial vending machines, some
of which had been serving Coca-Cola products along with other soft
drinks. The decision means Canteen will be offering Coca-Cola
products more often, the company said.
