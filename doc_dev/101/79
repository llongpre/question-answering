A "massive chain-reaction collision" involving 30 cars and as many as 14 
separate accidents shut down traffic on the Vincent Thomas Bridge in San Pedro 
for 2 1/2 hours early Tuesday, according to the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the amount of property damage -- one CHP officer described it as "just 
a mass of damaged vehicles pointed in all directions" -- no one was seriously 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
The bumper-car-style pileup began at 5:45 a.m. when one car rear-ended another. 
From the first crunch to the last bump, the incident lasted just 13 minutes. 
During the pileup, a jackknifed truck blocked both eastbound lanes of the 
bridge and a car caught fire when a motorcycle slid underneath it. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically," said CHP Officer Ken Ratcliff, "it was just a bunch of collisions 
one after another that just blocked the whole bridge. . . . It stretched out 
for approximately 300 yards on the bridge -- 30 damaged vehicles, some turned 
backwards, some turned crossways." 
</P>
<P>
Two people suffered minor injuries. Motorcyclist James Lord, 34, fell off his 
bike before it slid under the car and fractured his foot. 
</P>
<P>
And the driver of one of the cars involved in the first collision, Flordileno 
Lahep, 47, of Gardena, suffered neck strain. 
</P>
<P>
Both were treated at St. Mary's Hospital in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
There was no damage to the bridge itself and no damage estimate was immediately 
available for the cars. 
</P>
<P>
Bridge workers and Caltrans officials said Tuesday's pileup was the biggest 
accident on the 26-year-old Vincent Thomas in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
The bridge, which connects San Pedro to Terminal Island, is a commuting route 
for hundreds who work on the industrial island in Los Angeles Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
According to Ratcliff, the first collision, in which Lahep's car rear-ended 
another, occurred on a curve just over the crest of the bridge. The road was 
somewhat slick, because of morning dew, but officials have not said what caused 
the initial crash. 
</P>
<P>
By the time other drivers spotted the crash, he said, it was too late for them 
to slow down to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides of the bridge were reopened at about 8:15 a.m., Ratcliff said.
