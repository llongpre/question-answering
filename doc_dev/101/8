   A newsroom receptionist fired for her
anti-abortion activities, including picketing, says her rights have
been infringed, but the newspaper says her actions violated its
long-standing ethics policy.
   The Milwaukee Journal's dismissal of Diane Dew has prompted the
filing of a grievance by the newspaper employees union, an
investigation by a state agency and complaints by a religious
freedom organization.
   But Deputy Managing Editor Howard Fibich said the Journal stands
by its decision to fire Ms. Dew even though The New York Times and
Washington Post did not discipline employees in similar
circumstances.
   ``She was part of the news process,'' Fibich said. ``She did not
report the news but she handled the news. She took dictation from
reporters and that type of thing.''
   The newspaper's ethics code, established in 1973, prohibits
newsroom employees from participating in many outside political
activities and also from accepting gifts from outside sources, the
newspaper said.
   ``The reason that it (code) is there is to make sure that we are
able to maintain an image of objectivity,'' Fibich said. ``In my
judgment, our credibility is a precious asset and nothing must
compromise that.''
   Attorney Craig Parshall, who represents Ms. Dew, said his client
was fired as a part-time receptionist-secretary in July after she
refused to sign a statement promising to end her anti-abortion
activities.
   Parshall said Ms. Dew's activities were brought to the
newspaper's attention after a reporter saw her participating in an
anti-abortion protest.
   Ms. Dew said she feels compelled to protest abortion and that
the newspaper's restrictions violate her right to free speech and
religion.
   ``I can't just choose not to believe what I believe,'' she said.
``I'm responsible to speak out because I feel that abortion is
murder and murder is wrong.''
   Bob Dye, communications manager for Journal-Sentinel Inc., the
newspaper's parent company, said Ms. Dew was warned that her
actions violated the ethics code and was offered another job
outside the newsroom with no loss in pay, but turned it down.
   The Rutherford Institute, a Milwaukee-area group that
specializes in cases of religious liberty, filed a religious
discrimination complaint on Ms. Dew's behalf.
   The State Equal Rights Division is investigating to determine if
Ms. Dew was a victim of discrimination, said John Kimble, program
supervisor of investigation in the agency Milwaukee office. If the
division finds there is probable cause to rule discrimination
occurred, the case will go to a hearing, he said.
   The Milwaukee chapter of the Newspaper Guild, a labor union,
filed a grievance with the Journal challenging the dismissal.
   ``We argued that her activities were protected by our contract
and that the company violated the contract by trying to force upon
her a different set of working conditions,'' local president Mike
Kuchta said.
   Fibich said Ms. Dew's position on abortion played no role in her
dismissal. If she was a pro-choice activist the newspaper would
have taken the same action, he said.
   He cited an abortion rights march in Washington last spring in
which reporters from the New York Times and Washington Post
participated.
   ``I thought that was unacceptable,'' he said. ``If it had
happened here, the people involved would have been somehow
reprimanded.''
   Times editors disagreed with Supreme Court correspondent Linda
Greenhouse's decision to participate in the march, but they took no
punitive action, Assistant Managing Editor Warren Hoge said.
   Richard Harwood, ombudsman at the Post, said no disciplinary
action was taken against the few reporters who were involved in the
abortion rights march.
   ``People were reminded that this was inappropriate and that you
are not to take part in political activities if you work for The
Washington Post,'' he said.
   Harwood said the Post's ethics code does not mention newsroom
secretaries and he could not say for certain if they are bound by
the code.
