FT  09 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Welcome for rail franchise interest
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 70 private-sector groups have expressed an interest in operating
rail passenger services under the franchise arrangements planned by the
government, Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, told the Commons
yesterday.
He said it was 'extremely encouraging' that they included more than 20
management-employee buy-out teams.
Mr MacGregor confirmed that British Rail would decide by Easter how to spend
the Pounds 150m allocated to it to lease new rolling stock. British Rail
would decide the lines on which the new stock would operate, he said.
Denying Labour charges that passenger services were being run down prior to
privatisation, Mr MacGregor stressed that investment was at levels not
equalled since the 1960s.
Investment would continue at a high level next year, he stressed.
The transport secretary also ruled out any plans to use British Rail pension
cash to subsidise privatisation, denouncing in the Commons what he called
'mischievous and quite unwarranted scares'.
Shadow transport secretary Mr John Prescott said there was a Pounds 4bn
surplus in the BR pension fund and sought an assurance that no subsidies
would come from the surplus.
Mr MacGregor pledged: 'I give a complete assurance that in no way would this
government countenance the BR pension scheme fund being used for purposes
other than paying BR pensions.'
Dewe Rogerson, the public relations consultancy, has been appointed by the
government to advise it on a marketing strategy for the privatisation of
British Rail.
