Show up for "One Last Look," a play at Crossroads Theatre, and a 
flower-bedecked casket is stage center. Services open with soaring gospels and 
spirituals from a robed women's chorale. 
</P>
<P>
When mourners in the funeral parlor get up to peer into the box at the late 
Eustace Baylor, you begin to feel queasy. Did you take the wrong turnoff? 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly there's a vocal fuss at the back of the house. At the same time, a 
blind man with a cane stumbles up to the coffin and sticks his hand into the 
open casket to feel if it's really old Eustace. A brawl erupts when rival 
members of the deceased's extended families -- his West Indian wife and his 
African-American mistress (and their warring offspring) -- fight over who is 
going to sit where. 
</P>
<P>
Even the ghost of Eustace (a droll Lincoln Kilpatrick) shows up. This is an 
uproarious show, death warmed over, with some unexpected scorching drama 
(particularly from the wives, Masequa Myers and Amentha Dymally). There is a 
hilarious turn by busybody griever Susie Garrett, who carps about those "West 
Indian monkeys." Raymond Allen's formal Harlem funeral director has his hands 
full. 
</P>
<P>
Directed by Edmund J. Cambridge and set in 1962, the production is the final 
play of a trilogy by Steve Carter ("Eden" and "Nevis Mountain Dew") exploring 
relationships between African and Caribbean Americans. 
</P>
<P>
The production is a promising send-off for the comfortable smaller theater in 
Crossroads' new home in the Leimert-Crenshaw district.

At 4310 Degnan Blvd., Fridays and Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 p.m., through 
Oct. 7. $12. (213) 291-7321. RAY LOYND
