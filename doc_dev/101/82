   No green-tinted swine will lead Paddy's
parade, because of objections that pig lovers made.
   Plans were all set for St. Patrick's big deal until animal
activists started to squeal.
   A full-blooded Irishman _ a sight to be seen! _ planned to
carry, dear Colleen, a pig dyed bright green.
   But Grand Marshal James Monahan, who will lead the parade, got
grief for the ham-handed plans he had laid.
   The humane society had 30 complaints: Dyed pigs are no tribute
to dead Irish saints.
   The porker might suffer emotional shock if paraded by Monahan
block after block.
   So Monahan said he'd instead buy a stuffed one _ perhaps a toy
pig will be almost as much fun.

   Next time, how about a little coffee with
the Cremora.
   State health officials were called in last weekend when a white
powder coated cars and homes in this northern South Carolina
community. But officials from the Department of Health and
Environmental Control said there was nothing to worry about.
   ``It's just Cremora,'' said Joe Faris Jr.
   Borden Inc. manufactures powdered coffee creamer, and
occasionally, air vent driers inside the plant become clogged,
sending clouds of Cremora drifting through the vents on the
company's roof.
   Faris said Borden's occasional accidents cause ``aesthetic''
problems.
   But to the people who live and work near the plant, the white
powder is a source of aggravation.
   The coffee creamer mixes with dirt and pollen and settles in a
grimy layer over siding and windows, residents complain. When
moistened by morning dew, it hardens like concrete on car windows.
   Grace Dover, whose home is just a few yards from Borden's back
door, said she has stood on her back porch and watched the creamer
``fall just like snowflakes.''
   On Saturday, she said, the ``stacks out yonder were belching
like a volcano.''
   Borden's plant manager, Don Seltz, did not return telephone
calls seeking comment.
