   The National Liar's Hall of Fame cited The
Des Moines Register as teller of 1989's tallest tale in a story of
a drought-stricken corn farmer who gave new meaning to the phrase
``knee-high by the Fourth of July.''
   The newspaper deserved the top award for its report on an Iowa
farmer who ``was doubly proud last summer when his corn was
knee-high twice before the Fourth _ once on the way up, once on the
way down,'' Hall officials said Thursday.
   The hall of fame ceremony in Dannebrog was billed as the 65th
annual awards banquet, although sponsors admitted they might be
lying.
   Bill Orr, husband of Nebraska Gov. Kay Orr, won the Mendacity
Diplomacy Award when he notified hall officials he would be unable
to attend next year's dinner because, ``I have an important funeral
to attend that day.''
   Last year, politicians were banned from the competition because
the winners must be amateurs, said Roger Welsch, the hall of fame's
founder and director.
   This central Nebraska town, population 356, welcomed celebrities
in black shirts and white ties to the Dannebrog Convention Center,
Welsch claimed.
   ``The gala day began with the first ever Formula One Grand Prix
Race in the streets of Dannebrog, with the favorites _ Andretti,
Unser and Sullivan _ finishing first, second and third,'' he said.
   ``Fred Andretti expressed his appreciation and said it was worth
driving over from Grand Island for the event, but he had expected
something more than $5 off a bearing pack over at Mel's Sinclair
and a warm six-pack of Mountain Dew,'' Welsch said.
   He said Gaylord Unser and Lumir Sullivan filed protests with
race officials because Andretti repeatedly rolled through stop
signs in downtown Dannebrog.
   Jim Knapp, a Kearney attorney, won the Karma Award for his
naming of three things necessary to become a successful trial
lawyer _ ``sincerity, sincerity, sincerity.'' He said once you
learn how to fake it, you can get away with almost anything.
