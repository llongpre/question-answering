   Powered by strong performances in its core soft drink, snack food and fast food restaurant operations, PepsiCo Inc.'s first-quarter earnings rose 64% on a sales increase of 13%. 

   Earnings totaled $113.3 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $68.9 million, or 26 cents a share, in the year-earlier quarter. 
Sales rose to $2.57 billion from $2.27 billion. 

   Some analysts said the company's earnings were slightly ahead of expectations, which had been in the neighborhood of 40 cents a share. 
Emanuel Goldman of Montgomery Securities said that, on the basis of PepsiCo's first-quarter results, he was increasing his forecast for full-year earnings to $2.85 a share from a previous estimate of $2.80 a share. 
Last year, PepsiCo earned $2.26 a share. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, PepsiCo shares closed at $36, down 12.5 cents. 

   Mr. Goldman said the buoyant first-quarter results reflect the focus of PepsiCo Chairman D. Wayne Calloway on not just unit growth but on improved margins. 
"Calloway is a financial man," the analyst said. 
"He has got his people to do what was necessary to put ongoing margin improvements in place." 

   Mr. Calloway called the quarter "one of PepsiCo's best growth quarters in history." 
He said it would give the Purchase, N.Y.-based company "a running start" on an excellent year. 

   In the soft drink division, earnings increased 9%, powered by double-digit unit growth for Diet Pepsi and Mountain Dew. 
Earnings for the company's restaurant operations rose 31%, helped by improved delivery results at Pizza Hut and increased per-store sales at Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
Frito Lay sustained its momentum, registering a 17% earnings gain. 

   First-quarter results include a pretax charge of $14.5 million, equal to four cents a share after tax, related to the reorganization of the company's domestic soft drink business. 
Earnings in the first quarter of 1987 include a loss from discontinued operations of $12.8 million, reflecting the sale of La Petite Boulangerie, a restaurant chain.
