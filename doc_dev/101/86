<LEADPARA>  Pepsi is getting a face lift.;   The soft-drink giant, which has been
gathering some momentum lately with its successful "You got the right one
baby, uh-huh!" campaign, announced Monday that it is trading in its 18-year
logo for a hipper, more contemporary look.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The new design, which will be the new corporate logo in addition to
adorning Pepsi and Diet Pepsi products, features a more streamlined version of
the red and blue swirl introduced in 1943. It is the first permanent design
change since 1973.;   Package designs will not be altered on other Pepsi-Cola
products, including Mountain Dew, Slice and Mug Root Beer.;   "Packaging
changes have always worked," said Jesse Myers, publisher of Beverage Digest in
Old Greenwich, Conn. "It worked for Coke. I don't see any reason why it
shouldn't work for Pepsi.";   A recent survey for Adweek Magazine by Opinion
Research Corp. of Princeton, N.J., showed Pepsi outpacing Coke in consumer
awareness by 3 to 1. And in the summer of 1990, its summer "Cool Can" campaign
-- featuring neon cans with shades and party streamers -- drove up sales 21
percent.;   But overall sales haven't leaped. Sales of Pepsi brands increased
by only 0.7 percent to a 31.2 percent share of supermarket soft drinks in
April and May, compared with that period a year ago, Beverage Digest said.  </TEXT>
