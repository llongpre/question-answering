<LEADPARA>  Higher soft drink and restaurant profits helped PepsiCo Inc. to a 9 percent
increase in second-quarter net income, the company said today.;    But net
income from snack foods declined, the company said, as the higher cost of
potatoes cut in to profits in the company's domestic business.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     PepsiCo reported net income of $318.3 million, or 39 cents per share, in
the quarter ended June 15. That compared with earnings of $292.5 million, or
36 cents per share, in the second quarter of 1990.;    Revenue increased 11
percent to $4.19 billion vs. $3.77 billion.;    PepsiCo said worldwide soft
drink profits grew 10 percent to $256.3 million as sales increased 8 percent
to $1.7 billion. Domestic profits were up 12 percent and international profits
were up 5 percent. The company's brands include Pepsi, Diet Pepsi and Mountain
Dew.;    Earnings at the restaurant division rose 14 percent to $154.8 million
as sales increased 14 percent to $1.6 billion. PepsiCo said earnings were
strong at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, but slipped 5 percent at KFC compared with
a strong 1990 second quarter, when the fast-food chain introduced its Hot
Wings chicken product. The company also attributed the slip at KFC to
competition in the fast-food industry.;    Earnings declined 7 percent in the

other products rose 12 percent to $1.3 billion. Profits in its domestic
