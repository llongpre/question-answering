   PepsiCo Inc. said Monday its first-quarter
profit rose 10.2 percent, led by markedly better returns in its
domestic soft drink and worldwide restaurant operations.
   The Purchase, N.Y.-based company said it earned $181.9 million,
or 68 cents per share in the three months ended March 24, compared
with $165.1 million, or 62 cents per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 24.3 percent to $3.68 billion, from
$2.96 billion a year ago.
   Operating earnings increased 26 percent for the quarter, fueled
by strong volume growth in its soft drink, restaurant and snack
foods operations.
   Operating profit in soft drinks rose 27 percent to $151.5
million as sales rose 25 percent to $1.3 billion. Excluding
acquisitions, sales were up 8 percent, and operating profit jumped
24 percent.
   Domestic soft drink profits rose 32 percent on an 8 percent
sales gain, including double-digil growth in the Diet Pepsi and
Mountain Dew brands, while international profits fell in comparison
with strong results a year ago.
   Operating profit from snack foods rose 20 percent to $186.4
million as sales rose 27 percent to $1.1 billion. Profit growth was
fueled by a 50 percent increases in international results excluding
the effect of acquisitions.
   Higher advertising and marketing expenses, costs of new product
introductions and a shift in the sales mix to lower margin products
led to slower growth in domestic snack food operations, although
volume sales rose 6 percent. Increased sales of Ruffles and
Santitas were partly offset by a decline in Doritos.
   Worldwide restaurant earnings rose 39 percent to $91.0 million
on a 22 percent sales increase to $1.3 billion.
   Operating profit rose 39 percent at Pizza Hut to $51.1 million
on a 23 percent sales increase to $633.5 million, and 37 percent at
Kentucky Fried Chicken to $23.5 million on a 15 percent sales
increase to $322.7 million.
   The Taco Bell chain's operating profit rose 48 percent to $16.4
million on sales growth of 27 percent to $356.3 million.
