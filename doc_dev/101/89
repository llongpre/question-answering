   Coca-Cola Classic was tops in 1989, but the
drink known as New Coke that was introduced to replace it in 1985
fell out of the annual Top 10 soft drink rankings for the first
time, an industry newsletter says.
   The rankings released Wednesday by Beverage Digest indicated New
Coke, which had tied with RC Cola and Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi for
10th place in 1988, failed to make the 10 top rankings this year.
   Publisher Jesse Meyers said Caffeine-Free Diet Pepsi broke the
tie this year, capturing 10th place with a 1.5 percent market share
and leaving RC Cola and New Coke in a close fight for 11th at 1.4
percent each.
   The Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. introduced New Coke in 1985,
saying that it improved on the flavor of it regular cola. But the
company said fans of the original Coca-Cola taste deluged the
company with protests, and the company put the original drink back
on the market three months later as Coca-Cola Classic.
   New Coke was kept alive, but its share of market rapidly fell to
the low single digits after capturing an estimated 15 percent of
1985 soft drink sales.
   In 1989, Coca-Cola Classic retained the top ranking for the
fourth consecutive year, although its market share fell to 20.0
percent from 20.1 percent in 1988.
   Pepsi was second at 18.3 percent, down 0.4 percentage point from
1988.
   Diet Coke placed third with 8.9 percent share of market, Diet
Pepsi was fourth at 5.7 percent and Dr Pepper was fifth at 4.6
percent, according to Beverage Digest, published from Old
Greenwich, Conn.
   Filling out the rest of the Top 10 list were Sprite in sixth
place at 3.6 percent, followed by Mountain Dew at 3.5 percent, 7Up
at 2.9 percent and Caffeine-Free Diet Coke at 2.4 percent.
   The retail value of the soft drink market is $43 billion,
according to Meyers. That is up 2 percent from 1988, when sales
rose 4.5 percent.
   Meyers said the slower growth was due to cooler weather in many
parts of the nation this past summer, a prime sales season for soft
drinks.
   He noted that the four diet soft drinks in the Top 10 this year
had combined market share growth of 1.7 percentage points, while
the six sugared products saw their combined market share fall 0.3
percent.
   ``We are watching our calories,'' he said. He said diet soft
drinks are gaining ground in part because people like the taste and
because the soft drink makers are offering diet drinks in more
forms than ever.
   Counting all soft drinks sold by individual companies, Coca-Cola
commanded the biggest corporate share of the industry in 1989 with
41.1 percent, up from 40.5 percent a year earlier, the rankings
indicated.
   Pepsi-Cola was second in corporate share of the soft drink
business with 31.1 percent, up 0.4 percentage point from 1988.
   Dr Pepper-Seven Up ranks a distant third with a 10 percent
corporate share of the market, according to the Beverage Digest
rankings. Cadbury Beverages was fourth at 3.1 percent and Royal
Crown was fifth at 2.8 percent.
