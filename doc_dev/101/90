Graeme Hart will learn tomorrow if his audacious bid to become one of the
most powerful retailers in Australia and New Zealand is still on track,
writes Terry Hall.
Three weeks ago he launched a Dollars NZ620m bid to buy Foodland, a troubled
West Australian retailer. If the Australian Trade Practices Commission
agrees, Hart will sell its Australian food stores to Coles Myers, and keep
its substantial New Zealand operations - making him the dominant figure in
New Zealand retailing.
He is already a leading player in Australian bookselling, and has
substantial printing and stationery business in both countries.
Hart has achieved all this - plus a personal fortune of around Dollars
NZ600m - in just six years. During one of New Zealand's worse recessions he
has won control of every known target he has gone after, marking him out as
a worthy successor to Sir Ron Brierley, New Zealand's best-known corporate
predator.
Hart left school at 15 and started driving a tow-truck. A year later he
bought his own trucking business, and tried his hand at a variety of
businesses before deciding - at the age of 31 - to study for his MBA at
Otago University.
His big break came in 1988, when he beat Brierley Investments to buy the
Government Printing Office for Dollars NZ23m. Some estimates of the GPO's
more likely value were as high as Dollars 125m.
Since then Hart has not looked back. He manages his growing portfolio of
companies with a tiny head office staff of seven, including a secretary and
a receptionist. His former partner Colin Dewe says Hart customarily works 21
hours a day and his main recreation seems to be the 'three hours left for
sleep'.
For years Hart has said he would retire at 40. But with little over a year
to go, Hart's friends believe that this is one bid in which he is bound to
fail.
