   In 1854, Commodore Matthew C. Perry docked his
ships at Okinawa and, in telling of the wonders of America,
mentioned the monument being built in Washington in memory of ``the
great mandarin,'' George Washington.
   And, lo, the people of the Kingdom of Ryukyu _ Okinawa _
contributed a large stone from a quarry along with a 15th century
temple bell. The stone was to be placed into the wall of the
monument along with other commemorative stones and Perry planned to
hang the bell at the top of the monument.
   The bell made it to Washington; the stone didn't.
   But nobody noticed because by then the money to build the
monument had run out and it resembled a tree stump for another 25
years. Besides, a civil war and other matters occupied Washington.
   Fast forward 130 years to 1984. The Ryukyu America Historical
Research Society, an Okinawa civic organization, comes to
Washington to see the famous Ryukyu stone and discovers it isn't
there.
   Now it is the first Friday in August 1989. The temperature is 94
degrees, almost too hot even for tourists. At a ceremony on the
south side of the monument a replacement stone is unveiled by two
of 10 students who came from Okinawa for the occasion.
   ``This is a very important day for Okinawa,'' says Yukiko Koja,
one of the student delegates. ``This stone is important because it
symbolizes our long friendship with the United States of America.''
   The Japanese ambassador, the honorable Nobuo Matsunaga, calls
the occasion ``joyful'' and speaks of it as a cornerstone of future
development of cooperation.
   Eight dancers in kimonos do the traditional opening dance of
Okinawa as a record plays music. The lyrics are translated to
``today's happiness can be compared with the blossoming of a flower
when touched by dew.''
   Retired U.S. Navy Capt. Roger Pineau, who organized Perry's
papers in the 1960s, tells the gathering that the last mention of
the original stone was when it was transferred in Hong Kong. When
Perry received the stone from the Okinawan people, he said, there
also was a bill for $80. Embarrassed Okinawan officials, Pineau
said, apparently said they would take care of it.
   The new stone measures two feet by four feet by three inches and
weighs 396 pounds. Part of it was hollowed out for 53 pebbles from
nine Okinawa cities and 44 villages. It will be the 193rd
commemorative stone in the monument, only 15 of them from foreign
countries.
   It will be placed at the 310-foot level where the only people
who will see it are those who make arrangements to go down the
stairs of the 555-foot monument.
   As for the Gokokuji Bell _ it was never put in the monument.
Instead it was on display at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis,
Md., until 1986 when it was returned to the people of Okinawa as a
gesture of good will.
