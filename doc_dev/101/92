LLOYDS BANK'S political advisers have been taking advice from Mr Keith
Hampson, the Conservative MP with close links to the President of the Board
of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, in its battle with Hongkong Bank to take
control of Midland, it was disclosed yesterday.
Mr Hampson's role will be seen in the City of London as important since the
struggle for control of Midland is increasingly being played in the
political arena.
Mr Heseltine has the central role in deciding whether Lloyds' or Hongkong
Bank's plans to acquire Midland should be scrutinised by the UK competition
authority, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Mr Hampson has for several years been on a retainership with GJW, the firm
of political lobbyists hired by Lloyds. He said yesterday that Mr Andrew
Gifford, GJW's founder, had spoken to him about the bid.
But Mr Hampson said he would not describe himself as an adviser to Lloyds.
'I haven't had a cheque from GJW since last summer', he said.
Mr Hampson, a co-manager of Mr Heseltine's unsuccessful campaign to become
leader of the Conservative Party in 1990, will be used as a 'sounding board'
by Lloyds, a Lloyds adviser said, though it is unlikely he will do any high
profile lobbying for Lloyds.
Lloyds is also employing Mr Tony Carlisle, of public relations firm Dewe
Rogerson, who has close links with the Treasury, having worked on most of
the UK government's big privatisations.
Meanwhile, Hongkong Bank has taken on Sir Tim Bell, the public relations
adviser who worked for Mrs Margaret Thatcher, and his firm Lowe Bell, as a
political lobbyist. It is also employing Mr Francis Maude, the former
treasury minister, as an adviser to its chairman, Mr William Purves.
Even Midland has taken on a politician lobbying firm, Ian Greer Associates.
The first important political decision to be made in the battle for Midland
is whether DG4, the European Community competition authority in Brussels,
has jurisdiction over Hongkong Bank's offer.
