management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Geoghegan, 41, who joined the predecessor of HSBC Holdings over 20
years ago and is senior vice-president of its US operations, is taking over
from Michael Smith, 38, as head of Midland Bank's international operations.
Smith, managing director of Midland's international business for the past
couple of years, becomes deputy chief executive of Hongkong Bank Malaysia
Berhard, with effect from November 28.
Midland Bank was taken over by HSBC Holdings just over two years ago. The
Hongkong Bank has since moved its own people into top positions at Midland.
Keith Whitson, with the Hongkong Bank since he left school, took over as
Midland's chief executive at the end of March. His deputy, chief financial
officer, head of human resources and Midland's head of credit and risk have
all been drafted in from the Hongkong Bank.
A couple of months ago Christopher Sheridan, 51, quit as chief executive of
Midland's Samuel Montagu after ten years in the post. Sheridan, who joined
Montagu in 1962, has been replaced by Keith Harris, a former Morgan Grenfell
and Drexel Burnham Lambert merchant banker who was managing director of the
corporate finance arm of Apax Partners, the venture capital group.
Roger Downham, 50, director of Midland Bank Property Services, recently left
to join Leslie Clark &amp; Partners as managing director of Leslie Clark Project
Services. His place has been taken by John Breen, head of group property at
HSBC.
The Hongkong Bank has also extended control over management of Midland's
overseas subsidiaries. David Dew, 38, a senior manager with the British Bank
of the Middle East, has become chief executive of Midland Bank, Italy. John
Wheeler, 47, senior manager international corporate accounts at Hongkong
Bank, takes over as chief executive of Midland Bank, Spain; his post goes to
Alan Keir, 35, Midland's head of consumer industries.
