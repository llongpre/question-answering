   Cupid has a new message for lovers this
Valentine's Day and volunteers are lining up to spread the word
from Loveland.
   People around the world send their Valentines through the
Loveland post office each year to get the special postmark and
cachet verse.
   Ted Thompson, 85, has been coming up with verses since he and
his wife, Mabel, started the remailing program in 1947.
   An estimated 300,000 people will get Thompson's latest
Valentine's verse:
   ``It might just be a song bird,
   ``Or perhaps some sparkling dew,
   ``That brings fond recollections,
   ``And a timeless cupid too.''
   Thompson said recently he's not sure where he got the
inspiration. ``It takes the whole year for me to get something I'm
satisfied with. It's a hard thing for me. Some people are born to
write a verse for you, but that's far away from me.''
   Since it stamped 300 pieces of mail its first year, more than 7
million Valentines have passed through the program. The mail is
hand-stamped by about 50 senior-citizen volunteers. There's no
charge for the extra touch, which begins Monday and continues
through Feb. 14.

   Some people paid $500 to go to
Gov. Jim Florio's inaugural ball and ended up watching television.
   Organizers of Tuesday's $500-a-plate celebration planned for
3,000 guests, but more than 4,300 people showed up.
   ``Isn't this great? We are over subscribed at $500 apiece. Who
would have thought that would ever happen at a Democratic event?''
wondered Princeton Mayor Barbara Sigmund, who also had sought the
Democratic nomination for governor.
   Florio and his wife, Lucinda, arrived shortly before 9 p.m. and
danced their first dance to ``Satin Doll.'' Florio said the ball
was ``organized mayhem.''
   Crews worked through the night Monday to build wood floors and
two tents to handle the overflow crowd at the Garden State
Convention Exhibition Center. Part of a dance floor and the
cocktail area were sacrificed.
   But it still wasn't enough. About 500 people had to go across
the street to a hotel to watch the festivities on a big screen
television.
