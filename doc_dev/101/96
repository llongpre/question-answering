* 'Governor Goofy' Replies: Newsweek called him "Minnesota's 'Governor Goofy,' 
" but Gov. Rudy Perpich says Minnesotans won't be swayed by the newsweekly 
article. On Tuesday, Perpich, a Democrat seeking reelection, dismissed the 
article in the Jan. 22 issue as a political attack orchestrated by Republican 
campaign consultant Roger Ailes, who was hired by Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Doug Kelley. Kelley and Newsweek denied that Ailes had anything to do 
with the article. As an example of Perpich's "iconoclasm," the magazine said 
Perpich once ordered all the coffee urns in the Statehouse unplugged to save 
energy.

* Special Delivery: Cupid has a new message for lovers this Valentine's Day 
from Loveland, Colo. People around the world send their Valentines through the 
Loveland post office to get a verse on the special postmark. Ted Thompson, 85, 
has been coming up with verses since 1947. This year the verse is: "It might 
just be a song bird,/Or perhaps some sparkling dew,/That brings fond 
recollections,/And a timeless cupid too."

* Second Thoughts: CBS anchorman Dan Rather says he has "no alibis, no excuses" 
for his one-time experiment with heroin. In the 1950s, Rather had a police 
employee in Houston inject him with heroin so he would better understand the 
drug for a story he was writing. Rather was in Baltimore Tuesday to address an 
anti-drug assembly for seventh-graders.

* Video Search: When 4-year-old John Ross Cannon got a hug from Mickey Mouse at 
Disney World last April, it was a special moment, one of the last his family 
got to share with him before the child died of a brain tumor a month later. His 
parents, Larry and Tammy Cannon, have pictures to remember the moment, but they 
want something more. The Cannons are searching for several people with video 
cameras who may have captured the hug on tape. "I know there were a number of 
people there, shooting videos," Tammy Cannon said Tuesday in Charleston, S.C.
