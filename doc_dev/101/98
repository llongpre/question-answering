   Coca-Cola Co. and Pepsi-Cola Co. increased their
shares of the U.S. soft drink business this year, outpacing the
industry's 4.5 percent growth, an industry analyst said Tuesday.
   Coca-Cola Classic, meanwhile, remained atop the list of the
best-selling soft drinks in the United States, according to Jesse
Meyers, publisher of the newsletter Beverage Digest.
   Meyers estimated industry sales reached $43.2 billion at retail
this year.
   According to Beverage Digest, Coca-Cola's entire line of products
captured 40.5 percent of the U.S. soft drink market this year, up
from 40.3 percent last year. The Pepsi-Cola line was second as its
market share increased to 30.7 percent from 30.2 percent.
   Volume increases at both companies exceeded the 4.5 percent
growth in overall U.S. soft drink sales, Meyers said.
   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola's volume rose between 5 percent and 5.1
percent, while volume at Pepsi-Cola, based in Somers, N.Y., rose
between 6.3 percent and 6.4 percent, according to preliminary
figures from Beverage Digest.
   Dr Pepper's entire line gained market share as it retained its
No. 3 position with 5.6 percent of the market, up from 5.4 percent a
year earlier.
   Fouth-ranked Seven-Up's corporate share of the market fell to 4.9
percent from 5.3 percent a year earlier, while fifth-ranked Royal
Crown Cola Co.'s share fell to 2.7 percent from 2.9 percent.
   Meyers said A&amp;W Brands demonstrated it is ``the hot, second-tier
soft drink company'' as it moved up to sixth place from seventh
among the soft drink makers.
   A&amp;W, which has expanded its line beyond its A&amp;W Root Beer base,
increased its corporate share to 2 percent from 1.6 percent share a
year ago.
   Among the individual brands, Coca-Cola Classic remains the
nation's most popular soft drink and continues to gain market share,
Meyers said.
   Coca-Cola Classic boosted its market share from 19.8 percent last
year to 20.1 percent this year, while No. 2 Pepsi's share slipped
from an 18.8 percent share in 1987 to 18.7 percent this year, Meyers
said.
   In 1985, Coca-Cola discontinued the drink in favor of a new
formulation, but quickly brought it back under the name Coca-Cola
Classic in response to what it said was consumer demand.
   ``Everybody should make such mistakes,'' Meyers said in a
telephone interview from Greenwich, Conn., where he publishes
Beverage Digest.
   Other leading brands, as tabulated by Beverage Digest, are: Diet
Coke, 8.2 percent; Diet Pepsi, 5.2 percent; Dr Pepper, 4.5 percent;
Sprite, 3.6 percent; Mountain Dew, 3.2 percent; Seven-Up, 3.1
percent; and Caffeine-free Diet Coke, 2 percent.
   There was a three-way tie for 10th place as RC Cola, reformulated
Coke and Caffeine-free Diet Pepsi each had 1.4 percent of the market.
