<LEADPARA>  It was the Montreal Olympics of 1976, in which the East German women's team
won 10 of 13 possible gold medals, that knocked the United States off its
throne as the world's supreme swimming power.;    But the '92 Olympics in
Barcelona, Spain, may see the United States restored to its former place atop
the swim hierarchy.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The U.S. women won their first world championship since 1978 last January,
and the U.S. men made the meet in Australia their sixth straight title.;    "I
think you can read quite a bit into that," said Stanford swimming coach
Richard Quick, who coached the U.S. Olympic team three years ago in Seoul,
South Korea.;    Quick said the world championships were "the major focus of
the year for our premier athletes, and they were against the best athletes in
the world. I think that we're in pretty good position" for Barcelona.;    On
the brink of greatness?;  Part of the story in Australia were world records
set by Mike Barrowman (200-meter breaststroke) and Melvin Stewart (200
butterfly). Part was the U.S. women's performance in recovering from a
disqualification in the 800 freestyle relay, in which they finished first, to
still top the medal and points standings.;    And part was the decline of a
reunited Germany, which suffered rather than gained from the change.;   
Although there are doubters -- notably '84 Olympic gold medalist Rowdy Gaines,
now a television commentator -- that the world championships and this week's
strong performances at the U.S. Swimming Spring Nationals are indicative of
Olympic success, many coaches such as Quick see the United States at the brink
of greatness.;    'You just don't know'; "A 16-, 17-year-old girl who set the
world on fire in January of '91 could be over the hill by the time March (date
of the Olympic trials) rolls around in '92," Gaines said. "You just don't
know. Look at Anita Nall. Who the heck is she? She came out of nowhere.";   
Actually Nall, 14, came out of Towson, Md., and Thursday at the Spring
Nationals, she twice lowered the U.S. record in 200 breaststroke to the
second-fastest time in the world. The last U.S. woman to hold the 200
breaststroke world record was Catherine Ball in 1968.;    Nall wasn't even on
the U.S. team at the world championships. That team was led by Janet Evans,
who won two gold medals and one silver.;    The U.S. man-from-nowhere this
week is Joe Hudepohl, 17, of Cincinnati, whose 100 freestyle was the
eighth-fastest in U.S. history, though only good enough for third place. He
wasn't at the world championships, either.;    U.S. men hold world records in
six of 11 individual Olympic events: Tom Jager (50 freestyle), Matt Biondi
(100 freestyle), Dave Berkoff (100 backstroke), Barrowman (200 breaststroke),
Pablo Morales (100 butterfly) and Stewart (200 butterfly). Only Morales is not
longer competing.;    After Evans, who holds three world records (400, 800 and
1,500 freestyle), the only ones by an active U.S. woman, the top U.S. women at
the world championships were Nicole Haislett, who won the 100 freestyle in
national-record time, and Summer Sanders, winner of the 200 butterfly.;    The
U.S. women topped the medals table 12-9 over Germany, the gold medal count 6-4
over China, and team scoring 395-374 over Germany.;    "I think a lot of
(Germany's decline) is the fact they were such rivals before (reunification),"
Gaines said. "It's going to take them a long time to jell as a team.;    "Then
you've got to remember East Germany doesn't have the drugs behind them that
they used to, which was quite obvious at the worlds.";    A German magazine
recently documented East Germany's extensive illegal drug program.;    U.S.
Swimming, the sport's national governing body, has reoriented its entire
training program toward producing gold medals at Barcelona, including changing
the Spring Nationals from the usual 25-yard short course to an international
50-meter course.;    That has upset some coaches and meet directors who
believe it will hurt national age-group development programs and take
big-name, ticket-selling swimmers away from summer meets.;    "I disagree,"
Quick said. "I think the focus of United States Swimming needs to be the
Olympic Games for elite-level athletes. Success at the Olympic Games will do
more for age-group swimming than anything I can think of."  </TEXT>
