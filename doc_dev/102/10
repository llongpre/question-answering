THERE IS NO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT FOR STANFORD'S SANDERS

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the anthropology professor explained that the expectation level is the 
primary difference between humans and monkeys, a few students skimmed The 
Stanford Daily. 
</P>
<P>
Others thumbed through the syllabus, making notations for a research paper that 
had just been assigned. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, though, the professor made a declaration that caught the attention of 
Summer Sanders, the lanky blonde in the 15th row of the lecture hall. 
</P>
<P>
"Human beings live in a world that doesn't exist," he said. "A world of worries 
and dreams that have not occurred yet. Monkeys live only in the present, not in 
the past or the future." 
</P>
<P>
For Sanders, there is no better time than the present. If her freshman year at 
Stanford is anything like her freshman year -- which she calls the best year of 
her life -- at Oakmont High in Roseville, Calif., she has it made. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, if she thinks ahead to this weekend's U.S. Open or the World Swimming 
Championships in January or the 1992 Olympic Games, she'll go crazy. 
</P>
<P>
"You only have so much worrying in you," Sanders said. "I hate worrying and 
being nervous for races. I like to talk and laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Sanders can excuse the swimming world for wanting to press fast 
forward. Expectations are high since her triple gold-medal performance in the 
Goodwill Games last July. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' clocking of 2 minutes 9.46 seconds in the 200-meter butterfly was the 
second-fastest ever by an American and the fastest in the world in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Despite qualifying last in the 200 individual medley, she struck gold again in 
2:14.06, the fastest time by an American since Tracy Caulkins' effort in the 
1984 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
And in the meet's biggest upset, Sanders handed Janet Evans her first defeat 
since 1986, knocking an astonishing 8.68 seconds off her 400 individual medley 
best. Sanders' clocking of 4:39.22 is the fastest in the world this year. 
</P>
<P>
Though Sanders is 3.12 seconds shy of Petra Schneider's 1982 world record, 
Stanford Coach Richard Quick believes Sanders eventually will break it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's absolutely no question in my mind," said Quick, who also serves as 
U.S. national team women's coach. "Summer Sanders has the potential in the 400 
individual medley to go under the world record." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Sanders despises that event, a sequence of 100 meters of butterfly, 
backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle that some coaches call the toughest race 
because of the stroke versatility and stamina it demands. "If I never swam 
another 400 IM in my life, I'd probably be the happiest person in the world," 
Sanders said. "It is the hardest thing ever." 
</P>
<P>
Like many medley swimmers, Sanders was an age-group breast-stroker. A pulled 
muscle prevented her from training in the breast-stroke for a few months and 
sparked her interest in and mastery of the butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
"Her butterfly rivals the efficiency of Mary T. Meagher," Quick said of the 
world record-holder in the 100 and 200 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, Sanders' second leg was a weak link. But her club coach, Mike 
Hastings of California Capital Aquatics, developed her into a national-caliber 
backstroker. 
</P>
<P>
The third leg, breaststroke, has always been a strength. 
</P>
<P>
All that remains for Sanders to improve is her freestyle, a segment that most 
medley swimmers don't struggle with because much of their training is in 
freestyle. Although Sanders' freestyle is above average, it doesn't compare to 
her other strokes. 
</P>
<P>
Her ability to stave off Evans, the world record-holder in three distance 
freestyle events, was a breakthrough. "(Rivals) always pass me," Sanders said. 
"I've been passed many times." 
</P>
<P>
The most painful of those occurred at the 1988 U.S. Olympic trials in Austin, 
Tex. Sanders led by a body length with 50 meters left when Mary Wayte and 
Whitney Hedgepeth passed her and became the two representatives the United 
States sent to Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
At Oakmont High, Sanders' classmates staged a rally that cheered her up, 
despite her reluctance to be in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know about the rally," Sanders said, "because if I'd known about it, 
I wouldn't have shown up. I was kind of embarrassed. I started crying up there 
in front of the whole school. I felt (foolish). But it was nice. . . . I was 
real honored." 
</P>
<P>
Although Sanders yearns to be accepted, she wants the option of being 
unconventional. That is what binds her family in their own definition of 
togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' parents divorced when she was 7. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what it was," Sanders said. "All I remember is that my friend's 
parents had just gotten divorced. Her parents were buying her all these toys so 
when my parents told me they were getting divorced I said, 'Yes. Toys! Woo!' I 
had no idea what a divorce was." 
</P>
<P>
Sanders found out soon enough that it meant moving from one parent's home to 
the other every six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Every time I would move from one house to another, I seriously probably 
couldn't talk for a day," she said. "I was so sad. I'd sit there and cry for 
about most of the day. You get so used to coming home and there's your dad and 
you do certain things with him, and then you all of a sudden move and your dad 
is not there. And me with my swimming, I didn't see him that much, you know. I 
maybe talked to him a couple times a week. We'd go out to dinner every once in 
a while and go to a movie, but it wasn't the same." 
</P>
<P>
It became more difficult at 15 when her older brother, Trevor, stopped making 
the switch. 
</P>
<P>
"That was kind of a bummer when I had to leave him," Sanders said. "But I like 
going to my mom's so I kept at it." 
</P>
<P>
That has been the key to Sanders' sunny disposition, maintaining warm 
relationships with her father, her mother, her brother and her stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really close to all the parts of my family," Sanders said. "I think I want 
my kids to have the same family I do. God, they're so laid back. You know, it's 
not like you have to do this, otherwise you'll be a bad person. Like, if you 
want to, you can. It is totally up to us. When I think about church, it was up 
to us. My swimming was up to me. " 
</P>
<P>
Summer Sanders, nickname Scum, reveals nothing about swimming on the canvas of 
collegiate personality, her dorm room walls. 
</P>
<P>
They are plastered with Michael Jordan posters and she wears Air Jordans that 
Trevor gave her on graduation day, the ones she slept in that night. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders' roommate didn't even know she was living with a world-class swimmer 
until one of Sanders' swimming friends told her. 
</P>
<P>
Sanders is equally eager to conceal her academic prowess. She makes no mention 
of her U.S. Swimming Academic All-American status. Sanders is intimidated by 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first got here, I was real worried because people were using these huge 
words, and I'm into the simple kind of stuff," she said. "One day my friend Lea 
Loveless and I were walking down the hall when someone said something about 
mendicants. 
</P>
<P>
"I said 'Lea, my vocabulary is not very good, what is mendicants?' and she 
said, 'Oh God, Summer, it is a singing group.' " 
</P>
<P>
It is not something she's going to worry about, however. Sanders tries not to 
look back or forward. 
</P>
<P>
Her faithful watch ever on her wrist, she simply follows her demanding academic 
and athletic schedule, including predawn swims while the rest of the campus 
sleeps. 
</P>
<P>
Her idea of a good time? Whatever is going on right now. 
</P>
<P>
"I could just sit here in my dorm room looking at my pictures," Sanders said. 
"I could listen to music. I could read this Homer book ('The Iliad') . . . oh, 
just kidding."
