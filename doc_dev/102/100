<DESCRIPT>  SPORT; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Summer Sanders and Janet Evans were expected to battle for a gold medal in the
400-meter individual medley at the World Swimming Championships in Perth,
Australia. But the high expectations led only to disappointment Monday.;   
Sanders, leading each of the first three legs, fell behind in the final 200
meters. She and Evans, her Stanford teammate, looked beat as they finished
third and fourth, respectively. Lin Li of China was first in 4 minutes, 41.45
seconds, followed by Australian Hayley Lewis.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It felt like the worst 400 I ever swam in my life," Sanders said. "I did
something majorly wrong.";    The U.S. team also had a bad break in the
women's 800 medley relay when Nicole Haislett left almost one-tenth of a
second too soon on her leg of the race. That mistake negated a sensational
effort by Evans, who, swimming the anchor leg, overcame almost a one-second
deficit to finish first before the team was disqualified.;    Haislett did
manage a gold medal in the 100 freestyle, the first gold for a U.S. swimmer in
Perth.;  BASEBALL: Detroit Tigers Vice President and General Manager Bill
Lajoie, 56, has resigned to pursue "a more relaxed lifestyle," the team
announced. Joe McDonald, the Tigers' vice president of player procurement and
development, will take over Lajoie's responsibilities until the position is
filled, the team said. . . . Former San Diego Padres and Baltimore Orioles
outfielder and second baseman Alan Wiggins, 32, died Sunday in San Diego. A
Cedars-Sinai Hospital spokesman said Wiggins died of "pneumonia, tuberculosis
and other medical complications." Wiggins' major league career ended in 1987
when he was suspended by then-Commissioner Peter Ueberroth after reportedly
failing a drug test. . . . The New York Mets have invited D.J. Dozier, a Class
A all-star last season, to spring training as a non-roster invitee. Dozier, an
outfielder, is also a running back for the Minnesota Vikings. . . . The
Baltimore Orioles signed infielder Tim Hulett to a one-year contract for
$327,500.  </TEXT>
