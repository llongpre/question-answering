<LEADPARA>  It took three years to do it, but Angel Martino, who was disqualified from the
1988 Olympic team, is once again a national champion.;    Martino, of
Tuscaloosa, Ala., won the 50-meter freestyle in the U.S. Swimming Spring
Nationals on the final evening of the meet Sunday in 25.88 seconds.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     She was making her comeback in this meet after serving a suspension for a
positive steroid test following the '88 Olympic trials, when she was unmarried
Angel Myers. Martino had led the first half of the 100 freestyle earlier this
week but faded to fifth. She was sixth in the 100 butterfly.;    After both
races, she said that lack of training and competition during and after her
16-month suspension had cost her endurance. But the 50, a no-turn dash from
one end of the King County Aquatics Center pool to the other, proved to be her
distance.;    "I'm getting there," said Martino, 23, one of the oldest
swimmers at the meet. "I feel old.";    She'll drop the 200 individual medley,
previously one of her best events, from her program because of her age, she
said. But she'll try to qualify for the '92 Olympics in the three races she
swam in this meet.;    Janet Evans won her fourth event of the meet with a
time of 16 minutes, 11.22 seconds in the 1,500 freestyle, the 10th-fastest
time ever. Evans holds four of the top 10 1,500 times, including the world
record at 15:52.10 set at the 1988 Olympic trials. She also earned sixth place
in the 200 backstroke and was the highest point-scorer of the meet, with 80.; 
  "I'm excited to get back to training hard," said Evans, who is leaving
Stanford to concentrate on the '92 Games. "I know what I want, I'm going to
work hard for it, and I'm willing to do that.";    No world records fell in
the meet despite it being the qualifier for three U.S. teams being sent to
international meets this summer: the Pan Pacific Championships in Edmonton,
Alberta; the Pan American Games in Havana; and the World University Games in
Sheffield, England.;    "I think if we hadn't just come from the NCAAs you
would have seen some more American records and world records," said men's 200
I.M. winner David Wharton.;    Nevertheless, several U.S. marks fell:;   
(check) Women's 200 breaststroke, Anita Nall, 14, of Towson, Md., 2:27.08,
U.S. record. (She slashed the previous record by 2.5 seconds, earning her the
performance-of-the-meet award.);    (check) Women's 100 backstroke, Janie
Wagstaff, 16, of Mission Hills, Kan., 1:01.10, U.S. record.;    (check) Men's
200 butterfly, Melvin Stewart, 22, of Fort Mill, S.C., 1:56.83, U.S. Open
record (fastest time in the U.S. regardless of nationality).;    (check) Men's
200 backstroke, Martin Zubero of Spain, 1:58.60, U.S. Open record.  </TEXT>
