<TEXT>     The pair scored two 10s for technical merit and six 10s for artistic
impression with their routine. They earned a record  average for the figures
section (99.520) swum last weekend, before totaling a world's best duet score
of 100.242.;    The previous record was set by Canadian duo Carolyn Waldo and
Michelle Cameron in winning the Olympic gold at the 1988 Seoul Games.;    This
world title is a welcome breakthrough for the Josephsons, who have had to be
content with silver at the 1986 world championships in Madrid, at the FINA
World Cup in 1987 and the Seoul Olympics.;    They took a year off in 1989 and
made a comeback for this meet.;    "It's great to be back," they said, in
perfect unison, after their win.;    As for the races, the top effort in the
second day of competition came courtesy of Stanford's Janet Evans, who
captured a silver medal in the 200-meter freestyle, and the men's 800
freestyle relay, which also earned silver medals. Former San Jose resident and
1988 Olympian Troy Dalbey swam the opening leg for the U.S. team.;    "Our
best days are yet to come," Evans said. "We had a few disappointments but . .
. we're doing OK.";    The U.S. team could pick up some gold today, with Evans
a heavy favorite in the 400 freestyle and Matt Biondi the  prohibitive pick in
the men's 100 freestyle.;    Biondi, the star of the U.S. Olympic swim team in
Seoul, had a rematch with Olympic conqueror Anthony Nesty of Surinam in the
100 butterfly. But Nesty instead battled Germany's Michael Gross to the wire
for the gold while Biondi placed sixth.;    Stanford's Jill Johnson was
eliminated from the 200 breaststroke competition in a preliminary heat.;
TENNIS: Andre Agassi was slapped with the maximum fine -- $25,000 -- by the
Grand Slam Committee for pulling out of and then belittling the inaugural
Grand Slam Cup in December, a controversial $6 million tournament boycotted by
some other top players. The committee also had the power to ban Agassi from
one or more of this year's Grand Slam events -- the Australian, French and
U.S. Opens and Wimbledon -- but decided not to impose such a penalty. . . .
Second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated Alexia Dechaume 6-3, 6-1 early
today in a second-round match of the New South Wales Open in Sydney,
Australia. In the men's competition, Magnus Gustaffson upset No. 2 seed Jonas
Svensson 3-6, 6-4, 6-4.; BOXING: Former welterweight champion Mark Breland,
27, will fight a yet-to-be-named opponent on Feb. 4 in Albany, N.Y. Breland
(27-2-1) said he wants to prove he's not through even though he hasn't fought
since losing his World Boxing Association title to Aaron Davis in July.  </TEXT>
