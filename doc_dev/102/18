<LEADPARA>  WITH THE world and NCAA championships now past, the next swim meet with
Olympic implications -- and the most important meet of the year in this
country -- is the U.S. Spring Nationals beginning Wednesday in Federal Way,
Wash., near Seattle.;    Stanford's Janet Evans, a double-gold medalist at the
January worlds in Perth, Australia, is one of three world-record holders
entered, along with Mike Barrowman of Michigan and Melvin Stewart of
Tennessee. The meet will draw more than 1,000 swimmers.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Evans, the world's fastest woman in the 400-, 800- and 1,500-meter
freestyle, will be accompanied by Cardinal teammate Summer Sanders, who won
the 200 butterfly in Perth.;    Even though the Spring Nationals is the last
competition of a tough three-month stretch, it's important because it
qualifies swimmers for the U.S. teams sent to the remaining three
international meets of this year.;    The top two swimmers in each event go to
Edmonton, Alberta, in August for the Pan Pacific Championships. The Pan
Pacific competition, organized by Australia, Canada, Japan and the United
States and held every two years, requires that those four nations commit their
best swimmers. Also eligible to compete are the nations of South America.;   
After the Pan Pacific team is selected, the next two swimmers in each event
qualify for the Pan-American Games, also in August, in Havana, Cuba. The
Pan-Ams are the Western Hemisphere's mini-Olympics and are held only in a
pre-Olympic year. The next two swimmers who are eligible are assigned to the
national team for the World University Games in July in Sheffield, England.;  
 Because of the international implications of the meet, it has been switched
from the short-course (25-yard pool) format previously used in non-Olympic
years to the long-course (50-meters, about twice the short course) pool used
last year for all aquatic competition at the Goodwill Games. International
meets are held in the long-course format.;    Swimmers for the 1991 U.S.
Olympic Festival are also drawn from the Spring Nationals. U.S. Swimming, the
sport's national governing body, uses the Olympic Festival, to be held July
12-21 in Los Angeles, as a development event. The 104 swimmers chosen must be
18 or under and never named to a U.S. national team.;    Ex-Cal swimmer Matt
Biondi, who holds the world mark in the 100-meter freestyle, decided not to
enter the Spring Nationals and will instead use his exemption as a member of
the U.S. team at the worlds to qualify for future national teams based on his
times at Perth.;  JENNER GETS JOYNER-KERSEE: Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
world-record holder in the heptathlon, says she will compete at the Bruce
Jenner Classic on May 25 at San Jose City College.;    Joyner-Kersee, who will
be concentrating this year on The Athletics Congress national meet in New York
in June and the world track and field championships in Tokyo in August,
withdrew from last year's Jenner meet with an injury.;    The Pan-Am Games
don't figure in her plans, partly because they're scheduled too soon before
the world championships, but also because of continuing concern among U.S.
athletes over problems with setting up a drug-testing system in Havana.;   
"You can't take chances with that, especially when the procedures are not set
up right," she said. "People are not going to investigate it and read through
it and say they did not have it set up right. Your name is smeared now. You
urinate in a plastic bottle that -- who knows what's going to happen to it
now?";  BREAKING THE ICE: Julie Parisien's giant slalom victory in Waterville
Valley, N.H., last week was the United States' first World Cup victory since
retired ace Tamara McKinney won a 1987 slalom.;    The four-year drought was
the longest period in World Cup history without a U.S. victory.;    Eva
Twardokens of Santa Cruz was sixth and San Leandro-native Edith Thys was
23rd.;    Toni Standteiner of Olympic Valley, a member of the University of
Colorado ski team, won a silver medal in the giant slalom earlier this month
at the Winter World University Games in Sapporo, Japan.;  SOLICITING GOODWILL:
The site selection committee for the 1998 Goodwill Games, which founder Ted
Turner promises will be held despite huge losses on the first two runs in
Moscow and Seattle, has invited San Francisco to submit a bid.;    Thirty-one
other cities in the United States and Canada are being solicited. There's no
word on any city other than New York expressing interest in having the event.
The '94 Goodwill Games will be in Leningrad, Soviet Union.  </TEXT>
