<LEADPARA>  If Jeff Rouse's clumsiness extended from staircases to the swimming pool, his
career might be in jeopardy.;    Rouse, whose junior season at Stanford was
shortened after he broke his left wrist falling down the stairs at home, is
doing just fine in the pool. On Friday, he solidified his status as one of the
world's top backstrokers by beating a loaded field in the 100 meters at the
Santa Clara International Invitational Swim Meet.  </LEADPARA>

DESPITE WRIST, ROUSE HAS ROUSING WIN  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Rouse's winning effort, 56.59 seconds, was witnessed by an estimated 2,800
fans at the Santa Clara International Swim Center and came against five of the
world's top 17-ranked 100-meter backstrokers.;    And aside from Rouse, ranked
No. 2 in the world, others turning top performances included:;    (check)
Stanford's Summer Sanders, capturing the women's 400 individual medley in 4
minutes, 51.14 seconds.;    (check) High school phenom Joe Hudepohl, winning
the men's 200 freestyle in 1:51.23.;    (check) Soviet Sergei Marinuk, setting
a meet record of 4 minutes, 21.42 seconds in the men's 400 I.M. In all, the
Soviets won three of the eight individual events, and its men's 800 relay team
set a meet record of 7:37.34.;    Rouse's victory, however, was perhaps the
most impressive individual accomplishment because of who he beat.;    Among
his competitors were Alexander Popov of the Soviet Union (57.01), an
up-and-comer who was the fastest qualifier in the event; Mark Tewksbury
(57.99), a member of the 1988 Canadian Olympic team who entered ranked No. 3
in the world; Vladimir Shemetov of the Soviet Union (58.17), the bronze
medalist at last year's Goodwill Games; Stanford teammate Derek Weatherford
(58.27), ranked 17th in the world; and Vladimir Selkov of the Soviet Union,
the world's 15th-ranked backstroker who was disqualified after a false start.;
   And Rouse did it with a wrist that's still not 100 percent. He broke it in
early February, shortly after winning the world championship in the 100
backstroke in Australia.;    He returned in March to win the NCAA title but
skipped the U.S. Spring Nationals in April to rest the wrist.;    "If
anything," he said, "the injury gave me another type of goal -- the extra
motivation to overcome this.";    The victory didn't come easily because Popov
stayed with Rouse the entire race.;    "I didn't know what to expect from
him," Rouse said of the world's 14th-ranked backstroker. "I didn't know how
fast he could go."; ETC.: Matt Biondi finished sixth in the men's 100
butterfly at 57.08. . . . Kyoko Iwasaki, 12, of Japan, was second in the
women's 200 breaststroke at 2:35.99. . . . Japan's Yoko Tsukashima defended
her title in the women's 200 butterfly, winning in 2:15.01. . . . Trials begin
at 9:30 a.m. today, with finals scheduled for 4 p.m. The meet continues
through Sunday.  </TEXT>
