<LEADPARA>  Mark Spitz didn't even come close to beating Olympian Tom Jager in a 50-meter
butterfly match race Saturday, the first test of the 41-year-old swimmer's
comeback try.;    Spitz, the winner of seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer
Olympics, finished 1 1/2 lengths behind Jager, 26.  </LEADPARA>

'72 OLYMPIC STAR IS NO MATCH FOR JAGER  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Jager, the world champion and world-record holder in the 50 freestyle,
earned $20,000 for the victory. Spitz got $10,000.;    Jager got a strong
start and swam across the pool in 24.92 seconds. Spitz finished in 26.70.;   
"I don't think the loss was disappointing," Spitz said. "I hate to admit that
I was probably swimming for second, but I thought I could swim in the low
25s.";    Spitz called it nerves.;    "I think I could have walked across the
pool faster than I swam across it, the nerves were so great," Spitz said.;   
Spitz lagged at the start, then briefly caught Jager just before the 25-meter
mark. After that, Spitz almost appeared to be swimming in slow motion.;    "I
got it handed to me nicely and decisively by the fastest guy in the world,"
Spitz said. "I'm sure I'll feel a lot more relaxed now that I've got one under
my belt.";    It was the first time in 18 1/2 years that Spitz had raced
competitively. The last time was at the '72 Munich Olympics.;    A year and a
half ago, he made the improbable announcement that he was starting to train
again with the hope of making the '92 U.S. Olympic team in the 100 butterfly.;
   He enlisted the help of UCLA swimming coach Ron Ballatore. Ballatore agreed
with Spitz that nerves were a factor in the race.;    "I feel that if he were
to have relaxed more and kept his stroke he would have done a lot better,"
Ballatore said. "He hasn't looked like that at all in practice.";    Neither
Spitz nor Ballatore disclosed practice times, but Spitz said he has swum at
least a second faster in practice and believes he can do so in his next match
race.;    On April 27, he will meet Matt Biondi, a 1988 Olympic silver
medalist in the 100 butterfly. The winner will take home $35,000 of a $50,000
purse.  </TEXT>
