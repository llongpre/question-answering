freestyle for the first gold medal.

seconds. Jager was second in 22.31, far off his world record of 21.81.

played the United States in a later Friday night.

China won in four games over Olympic silver-medalist Peru, 15-5, 7-15, 15-13 
and 15-7, before a crowd of 1,000 at the 6,216-seat Spokane Coliseum.

"Seoul was a big game. This was for friendship, so we were not so nervous," 
Chinese player Li Guojun said. "This game was not as tough, but we both could 
have played better." 
</P>
<P>
Peru, with four players from the Olympic squad, suffered from a lack of 
preparation, according to Cenaida Uribe Medina, a player. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the players were playing in Italy and Brazil and unable to practice 
together," she said.
