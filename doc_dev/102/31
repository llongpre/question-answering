<LEADPARA>  She has an Olympic gold medal and the U.S. record in the 400-meter individual
medley, but no event has plagued Janet Evans lately like that race.;    Her
400 I.M. victory Friday in the U.S. Swimming Spring Nationals didn't end her
frustration, but Evans used it to say she intends to get back on top.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Wherever I end up (training) next year, I'm going to be working more on
I.M., and I feel like I'll get better," said Evans, who is leaving Stanford to
concentrate on the 1992 Olympic Games.;    Evans' 4-minute, 44.07-second
victory was far off her 4:37.76 record swim at the 1988 Olympics, but it was
comfortably ahead of the disappointing 4:46.05 she swam to finish fourth in
the January world championships.;    "My breaststroke is becoming my worst,
rather than my fly," said Evans, who trailed high school star Kristine Quance
by more than two seconds after the breaststroke leg. "In the I.M., they say
you either have it all, or if one stroke is just a little off, you'll lose."; 
  Part of Evans' reason for leaving Stanford, in addition to restricted
training rules being instituted by the NCAA, is dissatisfaction with her
training under Coach Richard Quick.;    She gave further insight into that
issue after the I.M. when she said her college training has focused too much
on freestyle.;    "I feel like I haven't trained much I.M.," she said. "I have
not worked enough on fly and breast, but I was pleased with tonight because I
held the end of a long taper," Evans said.;    Evans' I.M. performances had
fallen so much that Cardinal teammate Summer Sanders beat Evans in the I.M. at
the worlds (Sanders was third) and the NCAA championships, where they finished
1-2.;    Sanders, whose time at the world meet qualified her for the national
team at the next big international meet, the Pan Pacific Championships in
August, skipped Friday's race.;    "I hate it," said Sanders, a sprinter. "It
hurts more than any race I do.";    It hurt Quance, too, but her finish in
4:47.67 was still the sixth fastest by a U.S. woman.;    "It's probably the
most pain I've ever felt in a 400 I.M.," said Quance, who beat Evans by nearly
four seconds in Thursday morning's preliminaries. "It's the first time on a
400 I.M. I really pushed on every stroke, and it was my fastest time by five
seconds.";    Quance, of Northridge, finished second in Thursday's 200
breaststroke to 14-year-old Anita Nall, who won in U.S. record time, and both
qualified in that event for the Pan Pacific meet.;    Santa Clara Swim Club
was second to Texas Aquatics in the women's 400 free relay and fourth in the
men's 400 free relay.  </TEXT>
