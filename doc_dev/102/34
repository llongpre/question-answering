</DATELINE>

<P>
The rise of Eric Diehl has begun. He has gone from promising young swimmer to 
one with a national reputation, all in the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the next step is close at hand. In a month, Diehl will compete at the 
Goodwill Games in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
A strong showing there would give him a foothold on the international level. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything has happened so fast, it's kind of caught me by surprise," said 
Diehl, who will be a senior at Mission Viejo High School this fall. "But I want 
to compete in the Olympics. That's my long, long term goal. I need to get more 
experience against elite swimmers." 
</P>
<P>
Diehl figures to get plenty of that in the next several weeks. Besides the 
Goodwill Games, he will swim in the Swim Meet of Champions, which begins 
Thursday at the Marguerite Recreation Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
The meet, which continues through Sunday, will feature several top American 
swimmers, including Janet Evans, plus members of the East German national team. 
</P>
<P>
It will give Diehl a chance to test how far he's come since winning the 
1,000-meter freestyle at the U.S. Swimming Short Course National Championships 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope to swim fast, but all my focus is on next month," Diehl said. "But this 
meet will give me another chance to see where I stand. It will give me an idea 
of how well I will swim at the Goodwill Games." 
</P>
<P>
Diehl, who swims for the Mission Viejo Nadadores, will compete in the 800-meter 
freestyle in Seattle. He qualified for the games by winning the 1,000 freestyle 
at the nationals. 
</P>
<P>
His time of 8 minutes 58.26 seconds was a personal best and made him the only 
swimmer to finish under nine minutes in the event at that meet. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little surprised by my performance," Diehl said. "I expected to do 
well, especially in that event. But I expected the college swimmers to be much 
faster. I really thought I was a long shot to win." 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that Diehl will win Thursday in the 800 freestyle. First, he 
hasn't tapered his training for the meet. Second, he'll be facing stiff 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
Artur Wojdat, who also swims for the Nadadores, and Sebastian Wiese of East 
Germany also are entered in the event. Wojdat, who competes for the University 
of Iowa, was a member of Poland's Olympic team in 1988 and Wiese is ranked 
fifth in the world in the 800 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
"The meet will be faster this year," Diehl said. "Especially the 800. With 
Artur alone, it will be faster. But there are a lot more quality swimmers in 
that event this year." 
</P>
<P>
Besides the 800, Diehl also will compete in the 100, 200, 400 and 1,500 
freestyles. It will be his last meet before tapering for the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
But Diehl's summer of competition will not end in Seattle. After the Goodwill 
Games, he will go to Austin, Texas, for the U.S. Swimming Long Course Senior 
Nationals, which also will be the qualifying meet for the United States' World 
Championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Diehl will compete in the 200, 400 and 800 freestyles at that meet. 
</P>
<P>
Another strong showing at the nationals could only enhance Diehl's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's see how I do at the Goodwill Games," Diehl said. "Then I'll know how 
successful my year has been." 
</P>
<P>
Swim Meet Notes 
</P>
<P>
The only events Thursday will be the men's and women's 800 freestyle. The 
finals are scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. . . . A group of 18 East German 
swimmers will compete, nine men and nine women. Besides Wiese, who also is 
ranked seventh in the world in the 1,500, the team includes Sabina Schulze, who 
is ranked seventh in the 200 freestyle and 10th in the 100 freestyle, and 
Christiane Sievert, who is ranked eighth in the 100 butterfly . . . The United 
States' top two women distance swimmers, Evans and Jane Skillman, will be 
matched against each other Thursday in the 800 freestyle.
