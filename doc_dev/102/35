<TEXT>     Well, for the second day in a row Saturday, Biondi showed he is mortal,
finishing fourth in the 50-meter freestyle at the Santa Clara International
Invitational Swim Meet before an estimated 4,000 fans at the Santa Clara
International Swim Center.;    Biondi, the former world-record holder and 1988
Olympic champion in the event, finished in 23.47 seconds, behind the Soviet
trio of Alexander Popov (22.78), Gennadi Prigoda (22.82) and Vladimir
Tkachenko (23.18).;    Popov's time set a meet record, one of three individual
meet records set. The others were by Stanford's Janel Jorgenson in the women's
100 butterfly (1 minute, 2.38 seconds) and Soviet Elena Rudkovskya in the
women's 100 breaststroke (1:10.30).;    The Soviets, who won four of 10 events
Friday, won six of 10 events Saturday. Their men's 400 relay team set a meet
record of 3:24.09.;    The main reason for the Soviet domination is that their
swimmers are in top racing form after peaking for their national championships
three weeks ago.;    The top U.S. swimmers, such as Biondi, are unshaven and
won't begin tapering their practice workouts until next month when they train
for the Pan Pacific Championships Aug. 22-26 in Canada.;    Tapering is the
process in training in which swimmers cut their workout load so they can peak
at major competitions.;    "It's a big advantage for them," Biondi said.
"They've got stronger, fresher legs, and they can hold tempo. It means
everything.";    Still, Biondi added, he feels as if he has to win every race
to live up to fans' expectations. On Friday, he finished sixth in the 100
butterfly.;    "It's hard," he said. "I get a nice introduction, and people
expect me to win big. I don't want to let them down. But if I win today, I'm
not doing my job for tomorrow.";    Biondi, who swims the 100 freestyle today,
wants to remind people that in 1988, he finished second in the 50 and 100
freestyles at this meet before winning those events at the Olympics.;    And
considering his training stage, Biondi said, he wasn't unhappy with his times
Friday and Saturday. Today, he'll be looking for another good time, regardless
of where he finishes.;    "I wouldn't be surprised if I lost," he said. "The
key is to have a good time and a good swim.";      ETC.: Preliminaries for
today's events begin at 9:30 a.m., with finals set for 4 p.m.  </TEXT>
