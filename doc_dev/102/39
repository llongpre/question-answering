<LEADPARA>  She has seen the 3-year-old videotape so many times she's almost sick of it.
For a while, every time company came over to her house in Roseville, her
father would pop it in the VCR and she would have to relive the race again.;  
 "The more I saw it, the more I thought it was so close," said Summer Sanders,
who's finishing her freshman year at Stanford with three Goodwill Games, one
world championship and three NCAA swimming titles since this time last year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Then here these people are in the Olympics, and I think I should have been
there.";    She could have been there, swimming for the United States in
Seoul, South Korea, in 1988, but at the Olympic trials that spring she
finished third in the 200-meter individual medley -- one place from the
Olympic team but captured for posterity on Dad's videotape.;    Fifty meters
from the finish, turning from breaststroke to freestyle for the final time
down the pool, 15-year-old Summer Sanders had been first.;    "I turned my
breast-free turn and took a breath my first stroke and looked and there was
just nobody there," Sanders said. "They all hadn't made their turns yet. I
knew I was up with the leaders, but I didn't know I was ahead. I thought, oh,
my gosh. I had an Olympic gold medalist in the 200 freestyle (Mary Wayte)
right beside me, and when people are 15-year-olds, you know . . .";    Yes, we
know. Fifteen-year-olds either have no idea of the significance of what
they're about to accomplish, and they shock the world and themselves, or they
understand and psych themselves out.;    Sanders knew. Sanders faded.;    Yet,
in those three years, other things have faded as well. Mostly her anonymity.; 
  "She is an odds-on favorite to make the 1992 U.S. Olympic team," Coach
Richard Quick said when he signed her for Stanford.;    As superstitious as
she is, Sanders wishes he had never said those words, but she beat the world
in the 200 butterfly -- her favorite event -- in January, was second in the
200 I.M. and third in the 400 I.M.;    She has rested this week at the U.S.
Swimming Spring Nationals, dodging those events to win the 100 butterfly and
swim for her old club, California Capital, in the 400 medley relay.;    She'll
take the next week or two off and then begin training for the Olympic trials a
year from now in Indianapolis.;    "The Olympics are my ultimate goal," she
said. "That's the highest step you can make in amateur athletics.;    "When I
look back (at the '88 trials), I'm not really disappointed. If I had been to
the Olympics, what would my goals have been after that? Would my confidence
still be up?";    Perhaps not, because Sanders, while willing to put in the
work, is not someone such as former Stanford teammate Janet Evans, who lives
to marinate in chlorine.;    She hates the pain of the 400 I.M., her longest
event, and even 200s bother her.;    "My goal is by my senior year to be down
to 50s and 100s," she said. "When you have a bad 400, it's really bad. There's
four minutes of hell in there that just doesn't go by quick. A hundred is only
a minute. That's not so bad.";    Plus, if she screws up, the videotape is
short, too.  </TEXT>
