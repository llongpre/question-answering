<LEADPARA>  David Berkoff was last seen in the 1988 Seoul Olympics swimming the first
one-third of the 100-meter backstroke under water.;    He won the silver
medal, but three times that year, using his under-water start, he lowered the
world record until it reached 54.51 seconds, where it still stands.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The next year Berkoff retired, and the world governing body of swimming,
FINA, limited underwater starts to the race's first 10 meters.;    Not only
has FINA tinkered with the backstroke rules twice since '89, Berkoff has
un-retired to win Saturday's race at the U.S. Swimming Spring Nationals using
a new turn he has developed.;    "I've got some tough decisions to make this
summer to see if I want to try and make the (Olympic) team in '92," said
Berkoff, whose winning time was 55.57. "The new rules for the backstroke I can
live with. I think I can break the world record. I think there are some other
guys who can break the world record.";    One is Martin Zubero of Spain, a
University of Florida swimmer who was barred from the championship finals
because of his nationality. He won the consolation finals in a time faster
than Berkoff's, 55.35. Zubero stands to win a reported $1 million from the
Spanish government if he wins the 100 backstroke next summer in Barcelona.;   
Berkoff, a Harvard graduate, said his turn is just part of his ongoing battle
to stay ahead of the rules makers.;    "I feel like an outlaw sometimes," he
said. "After the Olympics, I hid in my corner and pouted for a while. (With
the underwater start), the important part of the race was the first half. Now
we're looking at the back half of the race.";    In the women's 100
backstroke, Janie Wagstaff, 17, of Kansas City, Mo., chopped the U.S. record
down to 1 minute, 1.10 seconds in the morning preliminaries and then returned
to win the final in 1:01.22.;    Janet Evans easily won the 400 freestyle in
4:09.11, well off her 1988 world record of 4:03.85.;    Summer Sanders of
Stanford nipped teammate Janel Jorgensen in the 100 butterfly in 1:00.47.
Jorgensen was 0.01 seconds behind.  </TEXT>
