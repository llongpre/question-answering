<P>
What do you give a girl who has nearly everything? How about a teddy bear? 
</P>
<P>
Janet Evans, world-class distance swimmer, treasures a stuffed animal as much 
as the three gold medals she won in the Seoul Olympics last summer. 
</P>
<P>
The teddy bear was a present from one of her teammates at El Dorado High 
School. But the entire team presented it to her at the Southern Section 3-A 
finals in May. 
</P>
<P>
"It was from my secret pal on the team," Evans said. "Everyone on the team has 
one, and we give each other little gifts before every meet. But this one was 
from everyone. They all signed a card and gave it to me. It was neat." 
</P>
<P>
For Evans, The Times' Orange County girls' swimmer of the year, the gift marked 
the end of an illustrious high school career. 
</P>
<P>
While at El Dorado, Evans competed in four Southern Section championship meets. 
Including relays, she won 10 Southern Section titles. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always liked the Southern Section meet," said Evans, who will attend 
Stanford on a swimming scholarship in the fall. "It was fun to compete with a 
team. I like being with my peers." 
</P>
<P>
Evans has had few of those in the pool, especially on the high school level. 
She holds national high school records in the 200-yard individual medley and 
500 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1989 3-A meet, Evans broke her national high school record in the 200 
individual medley with a time of 1 minute 59.96 seconds. She also won the 500 
freestyle in 4:38.34, missing her national mark by a second. 
</P>
<P>
Evans also helped El Dorado's 200 medley relay team finish first. The Golden 
Hawks finished second at the meet. 
</P>
<P>
The second-place finish is Evans' fondest memory of her high school 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really exciting," Evans said. "It was the highest El Dorado has ever 
finished. That was special. I'm glad I was a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
For Evans, the high school season was a welcome break from the rigors of 
international competition. It was a chance to be with her friends and have a 
little fun. She regularly swam in events other than her specialties in dual 
meets, as well as swimming on relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I got to swim the 100 backstroke and 100 breaststroke during dual meets," 
Evans said. "I could never do that on the international level. I'm a distance 
swimmer; there's no way I could beat the best in the world in the 100-meter 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"In high school swimming, I get to be with my friends. That's the best part." 
</P>
<P>
It may sound odd, but Evans has actually lost a high school race in the 
Southern Section championship meet. Of course, that was back in those 
pre-legend days when she was a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing in the 200 individual medley in 1985, she has won every individual 
championship race. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't believe it's over already," Evans said. "High school went by so fast. 
It's hard to imagine not swimming in high school anymore. It's a little sad." 
</P>
