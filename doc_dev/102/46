The Stanford women's swimming team won four more events Sunday night to seal 
their fourth consecutive Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championship at 
the East Los Angeles College Pool. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford totaled 1,717 points. California finished second with 1,238, followed 
by UCLA (1,143), Arizona State (1,075) and USC (936). 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's first victory came in the first event when freshman Janet Evans 
lapped the field in the 1,650-yard freestyle, setting a conference record of 
15:53.77. 
</P>
<P>
Although victories are almost becoming routine for Evans, who had won two 
events in earlier sessions, she was excited by her effort. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to go under 16 minutes and I was very happy to do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Susannah Miller, a Stanford senior, led a Cardinal sweep in the 200-yard 
backstroke. Miller, who touched with an NCAA qualifying time of 2:01.29, was 
followed by Jody Smith and Dede Trimble. 
</P>
<P>
Kristin Stoudt, a sophomore at UCLA, won the 100-yard freestyle with a 
conference record of 49.93. Michelle Thompson of Arizona State was second. 
</P>
<P>
Stoudt, who won the 50-yard freestyle Friday night, swam her best time ever. 
</P>
<P>
"My goal was to break 50 seconds," Stoudt said. "I'm confident going to NCAA's 
because I know I can go faster." 
</P>
<P>
In the next event, the 200-yard breaststroke, Stanford freshman Lori Heisick 
led from the beginning on the way to her second championship with a time of 
2:15.82. Her teammates, Jill Johnson and Bethanne Lambert, were second and 
third, respectively. Heisick won the 100-yard breaststroke Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's final victory came when freshman Janel Jorgensen joined Evans as a 
three-event winner with a victory in the 200-yard butterfly. Jorgensen's time 
of 1:58.75 was just off Mary T. Meagher's conference record of 1:57.4, but well 
under the qualifying standard. 
</P>
<P>
Jorgensen was happy with the victory, but had hoped for Meagher's record. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew about the record, but I wasn't sure if I could get it tonight," 
Jorgensen said. "We'll see, with a couple of weeks of rest, whether I can get 
her other marks." 
</P>
<P>
Meagher also holds the American records in the 100- and 200-yard butterfly 
events. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA added another championship by winning the 400-yard freestyle relay with a 
time of 3:23.29. Stanford was second and USC third. All three teams qualified 
for the NCAA championships to be held March 15-17 at the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
For Stanford, the relay was merely icing on the cake. Stanford, the defending 
national champion, is top-ranked this year, and after this weekend's 
performances is in good position to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
For UCLA and USC, the result of the relay was a great way to end the meet. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a great Pac-10's," UCLA Coach Cyndi Gallagher said. "The last relay 
just topped it off." 
</P>
<P>
At the Pac-10 diving championships, Jill Campbell of California won the 
10-meter platform event, defeating Kristin Jensen of Stanford, 360.30-350.50, 
at the McDonald's Swim Stadium at USC. Katie Connor of Stanford, who won the 
one- and three-meter springboard championships, was third. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Earley of USC won the men's 10-meter platform with 543.80 points. The 
victory was Earley's second of the meet; he won the three-meter springboard 
Saturday. Chris Dudka of UCLA finished second.
