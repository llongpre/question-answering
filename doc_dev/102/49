<TEXT>     Karli and Ryann not only have continued the family aquatics tradition at
Homestead, but they also are regarded as two of the finest swimmers in the
Central Coast Section.;   Karli, a senior, and Ryann, a freshman, will be
among the favorites in their events at the CCS Swimming and Diving
Championships this weekend at Stanford's deGuerre Pool.;   The swimming trials
begin Friday at 10:30 a.m. Diving competition starts Saturday at 9 a.m.,
followed by the swimming finals at 1 p.m.;   Karli won the 200-yard individual
medley and 100 backstroke titles at last year's section meet, and she is the
choice to repeat in those events.;   She also probably would have been the
favorite in the 100 freestyle, but swimmers are limited to two individual and
two relay events in the section finals.;   Ryann, who has been among this
year's top CCS swimmers in the 100 breaststroke, 500 freestyle and individual
medley, said she will swim the breaststroke at the CCS meet but hasn't decided
whether her other event will be the 500 free or 200 I.M.;   If she chooses the
200 I.M., she will compete against her sister.;   "I wouldn't mind beating
Karli," Ryann said. "But it would be difficult. She is much stronger in that
event than I am.";   Karli's fastest swim in the 200 I.M. is 2 minutes, 7
seconds, her winning time in last year's CCS meet. Ryann said her best is
2:10.29, in April at a U.S. Swimming meet.;   The sisters, both of whom
compete for the Santa Clara Swim Club, also will be part of Homestead's 200
medley and 400 free relay teams.;   Paul Taylor, the father of Robin, Karli,
Ryann and Kyle, a sophomore water polo player and swimmer at Homestead, said
the Taylor family is in its third generation of producing swimmers.;   "The
first two generations of Taylors swam for Redford High in Detroit," Paul
Taylor said. "One of my brothers is still competing in masters.;   "There has
yet to be a Taylor swim in college -- but it looks like Karli will be the
first.";   Karli said UCLA, Southern Cal and UC-Santa Barbara have expressed
interest in her. She said she will be making a recruiting visit to USC this
month.;   "That has been one of my goals, to swim in college," she said.;  
How long her swimming career lasts, however, may depend on how her shoulders
hold up.;   "My shoulders have been giving me problems," she said. "I have
loose (shoulder) joints and that causes pulling on the tendons.;   "Doctors
have told me that surgery would be the only way to correct the problem, but
that would mean I would be out for three to four months. So I swim with pain
and take medication to reduce the swelling.";   Karli also coaches the
Homestead team on Tuesdays, when head coach Theresa Hessler is unable to get
away from her job as a nurse at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.;   "I
kind of look at Karli as my assistant coach," Hessler said. "She is the
captain of the team and a leader with a strong personality. The girls respect
her, and I feel very comfortable about leaving her in charge when I'm not able
to be there.";   Karli said her goals at the CCS meet are to improve on her
200 I.M. time and eclipse the meet 100 backstroke record of 57.73 seconds, set
in 1977 by Linda Jezek of Homestead. Karli just missed Jezek's mark last year
while winning the event in a personal-best 57.80.;   "Linda owns the oldest
record in the CCS meet," Karli said, "and I want to break it.";   When the
high school season ends, Karli said, she will be concentrating on reaching the
Olympic trials in March in Indianapolis, Ind. Last August, she finished second
in the 200-meter backstroke and third in the 200-meter I.M. and 100-meter fly
in the Junior Olympics at Mission Viejo.;   "I feel I have a shot at making
the trials in the 200 back and possibly the 200 I.M. and 100 back," she said.;
  Karli credits her improvement over the last two years to Jay Fitzgerald, the
Santa Clara Swim Club coach.;   "He has really motivated me," she said. "He is
very demanding. He has made me tougher mentally and physically. He sets my
standards very high and makes me believe I can achieve them.";   Ryann, who
also credits Fitzgerald for making her a better swimmer, said she believes she
has a chance to win a title this weekend in the 100-yard breaststroke.;   "But
that pretty much is the same for everyone," she said. "There are a lot of fast
breaststrokers in the CCS.";   As for Ryann's future in the sport, Karli said,
"I can see her going far. I think she will score (finish among the top eight
swimmers) at senior nationals before she gets out of high school. And I think
the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta are within her reach."  </TEXT>
