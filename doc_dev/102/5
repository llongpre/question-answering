Tom Jager, a silver medalist in the Seoul Olympics, said he wants to prove that 
older swimmers can compete in a sport dominated by youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, 24, who works as an aquatics director in Albuquerque, N.M., showed 
Saturday that he is fast enough to win major competitions with a victory in the 
50-meter freestyle during the third day of the International Swim Meet of 
Champions at Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
Jager, who was edged by Matt Biondi for the gold medal in the 1988 Olympic 50, 
was clocked in 23.74 seconds. Brian Kurza of UCLA finished second in 24.15 and 
Brian Jacobson, 15, of the Bellflower Aquatic Club was third in 24.35. 
</P>
<P>
"I may have scrambled a bit much in my race, and that might have slowed me down 
a bit," said Jager, whose 23.60 was the top qualifying time in Saturday 
morning's preliminaries. Jager, who wants to break Biondi's world record of 
22.14 set during the Seoul Games, said he decided to continue competing to 
serve as a role model for younger competitors as well as help find ways for 
athletes to stay in the sport after they complete their college careers. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot still needs to be done in the sport," Jager said. "United States 
Swimming (the sport's governing body in the United States) needs to take better 
care of our athletes than they are doing now so we can continue to train and 
stay in the sport after they complete college."

Still a teen-ager, Janet Evans of Placentia need only worry about winning, 
which she did twice Saturday. Evans, the world-record holder in the 400-meter 
freestyle, won that event in 4:13.55. 
</P>
<P>
France's Laurence Bensimon finished second in 4:19.65 and Francie O'Leary of 
the Click Tucson Swim Club was third in 4:19.65. 
</P>
<P>
Evans held off Mission Viejo High School senior Suzi Burt to win the 200 
backstroke in 2:18.53. Burt, who stayed with Evans during the first half of the 
race, ns was second in 2:22.27, and Natalie Norberg of Industry Hills was third 
in 2:23.51. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt pretty good," said Evans, who won the 400-meter individual medley but 
finished fourth in the 200 butterfly Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In the men's 400-meter freestyle, Poland's Artur Wojdat scored his third 
victory of the meet by edging 1988 U.S. Olympian Dan Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat, who battled with Jorgensen for the lead for most of the race, had a 
strong last 100 meters to win. Wojdat was timed in 3:55.09, Jorgensen 3:56.63. 
</P>
<P>
Wojdat's fellow Pole and Mission Viejo Nadadore swim club teammate Mariusz 
Podkoscielny was third in 3:57.77, and Jorgensen's younger brother, Lars, was 
fourth in 4:00.80.
