<TEXT>     Evans, a triple gold-medalist in the 1988 Olympics, finally added a world
championship gold to her victory list, beating Australian Hayley Lewis with a
time of 4 minutes, 9.40 seconds in the 400 freestyle. She didn't threaten her
world-record time of 4:03.85.;    With the victory, Evans, a Stanford
sophomore, avenged a loss to Lewis in the 200 freestyle Tuesday. Earlier this
week, Evans finished a disappointing fourth in the 400 individual medley and
anchored the 800 freestyle relay team which was disqualified.;    The women's
400 freestyle relay team added another gold medal Wednesday with a victory
over Germany in 3:43.26.;    The U.S. also got a surprise gold medal in diving
when Kent Ferguson, a six-time national champion who hadn't won an important
international meet, won the 3-meter springboard.;    In water polo, the U.S.
men's team lost to Germany 9-7 and must beat Hungary today to stay in
contention for a medal.; FOOTBALL: Syracuse named assistant Paul Pasqualoni as
head coach, replacing Dick MacPherson, who Monday was named coach of the New
England Patriots. Pasqualoni, 41, served four seasons as linebackers coach.;
TENNIS: John McEnroe, thrown out of the Australian Open last year after
throwing a tantrum, is staying away this year  because of a shoulder injury. .
. . Boris Becker lost to Goran Ivanisevic 5-7, 7-5, 6-4 in his opening match
of an exhibition tournament in Adelaide, Australia.; GOLF: Arnold Palmer,
after an absence of 11 years, has committed to play in the 1991 Pebble Beach
National Pro-Am, tournament officials announced. The tournament will be played
on the Pebble Beach, Spyglass Hill and Poppy Hills courses Jan. 31-Feb. 3. . .
. Tom Watson said his resignation from the Kansas City Country Club to protest
its discriminatory membership has resulted in positive reaction nationwide.
Watson's resignation late last year from the private club where he learned to
play golf prompted the club to change its mind about the membership
application of Henry Bloch, co-founder of a large tax preparation firm. Bloch
is Jewish, as are Watson's wife and children.; MISCELLANY: Former Stanford
basketball star Jennifer Azzi has signed a one-year contract with an Italian
pro team, USA Today reported. Azzi, a 5-foot-9 guard who was last season's
women's collegiate player of the year, will play her first game for Viterbo on
Sunday. "I'm happy for her, but more importantly she's happy," said Tara
VanDerveer, Azzi's coach at Stanford. "She has a lot of basketball left in
her." . . . Pat Summerall, CBS-TV's top NFL play-by-play announcer, says a
combination of alcohol and pain killers almost caused him to bleed to death
last month. Summerall, 60, told The National he has changed his routine since
spending 10 days in a Florida hospital with upper gastro-intestinal bleeding.
