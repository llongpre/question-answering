<LEADPARA>  The $100,000 prize -- a thousand $100 bills neatly spread out Vegas-style on a
table in the lobby of the King County Aquatic Center -- will go back to Bob
Stupak's casino.;    Melvin Stewart, world-record holder in the 200-meter
butterfly, failed to break his own mark and claim the loot Thursday at the
U.S. Swimming Spring Nationals.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  STEWART WINS, BUT MISSES SHOT AT $100,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But Stewart, who swims for the Las Vegas Gold club, which Stupak sponsors,
did claim his sixth straight national title in the meet-record time of 1
minute, 56.83 seconds.;    Stewart ended the world-record reign of West
Germany's Michael Gross in January at the world championships in Australia,
taking Gross' record with a 1:55.69 time.;    That became the mark Stewart had
to beat in a national championship meet to claim Stupak's unprecedented -- in
swimming -- bounty, which was posted for any Gold swimmer to break a world
mark before the Barcelona Olympics in '92.;    "Ouch!" Stewart said afterward.
His next chance for the money will be in December.;    It was an evening that
also included the crowning of a new breaststroke queen -- a 14-year-old who
swam the second fastest women's 200 meters in history.;    Anita Nall of
Towson, Md., too young for a driver's license and too slow last summer to
qualify for the world championships (she won the consolation finals of the
U.S. Open), swam a 2:27.08 Thursday to establish herself as the Olympic
favorite in the event.;    Only East Germany's Silke Hoerner's 2:26.71 at
Seoul, South Korea, three years ago is a faster time, and Hoerner is not
expected to compete in Barcelona.  </TEXT>
