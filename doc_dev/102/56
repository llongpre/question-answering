Six years ago, Janet Evans was churning through a preliminary heat during the 
Mission Viejo Swim Meet of Champions when Mark Schubert, then coach of the 
Mission Viejo Nadadores, turned to a reporter and said, "She's the tiniest 
thing I've ever seen and she's got a funny-looking stroke, but keep your eye on 
her." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, then an 80-pound 12-year-old, looked like a wind-up bathtub toy with her 
almost-straight arms paddle-wheeling through the water. But Schubert, now the 
women's coach at the University of Texas, knew a prospect when he saw one. And, 
indeed, the whole world has had its eye on Janet Evans ever since that windmill 
stroke propelled her to three gold medals in the 1988 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night at the Westin Hotel in Indianapolis before a black-tie crowd of 
1,300, the Placentia teen-ager added yet another accolade to an already 
bursting trophy case when she was awarded the James E. Sullivan Memorial Trophy 
as the outstanding amateur athlete of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
It was third time she had been nominated for the award. Last year, Evans lost 
out to Florence Griffith-Joyner despite setting a world record and an American 
record during her triple-gold performance in Seoul, Korea. 
</P>
<P>
Evans came back strong in 1989, however, breaking her own world record in the 
800-meter freestyle, establishing American marks in the 1,000- and 1,650-yard 
freestyle events and running her unbeaten streak to 27 consecutive races. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to miss coming back here every year," she said, flashing the 
infectious grin that earned the reputation as "America's Sweetheart" during the 
1988 Summer Games. "Just being a finalist is quite an honor and this is an even 
greater honor. I'm pleasantly surprised." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, apparently just as at ease in a pink, off-the-shoulder taffeta gown as 
she is in a lycra swimsuit, said the award helped reaffirm that she had made 
the right choice by deciding to continue her swimming career at Stanford rather 
than accept a number of lucrative endorsement deals. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone told me after the Olympics how hard it was to come back the next year 
and do well," Evans said. "It was a difficult decision, whether to swim 
collegiately or take the money. Now I'm really glad I decided to keep 
swimming." 
</P>
<P>
So is Richard Quick, coach of Stanford's defending NCAA champion women's team. 
But he isn't exactly overjoyed that Evans, his star freshman, decided to come 
here for the award presentation just three days before the NCAA championships 
begin in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard wrote up some workouts and I swam three times in the (Indiana 
University) Natatorium," said Evans, who is no longer dwarfed by the 
competition at 5-7, 116 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this little break will help me. I'm swimming faster than ever in 
training, so we'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
Evans, 18, is the 10th female and the second-youngest athlete to win the 
Sullivan Award. Swimmer Tracy Caulkins won in 1978 when she was 16.
