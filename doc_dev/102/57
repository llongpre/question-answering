<LEADPARA>  Chafing under new NCAA training restrictions and disappointed with her
performances this season, three-time Olympic gold medalist Janet Evans is
giving up her last two years of college swimming at Stanford to concentrate on
the 1992 Summer Games.;    Evans, 19, who holds three world and four U.S.
records and is one of the top two swimmers on the Stanford women's team, said
Wednesday that she eventually plans to finish school, but she fears a new
20-hours-per-week limit on her swimming training beginning in the fall will
hamper her Olympic preparation. She made her announcement after winning the
800-meter freestyle at the U.S. Swimming Spring Nationals.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  EVANS QUITS STANFORD SWIMMING
RECORD-HOLDER FEARS NEW NCAA RULES WILL HURT
OLYMPIC QUEST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It's not like I'm dropping out," she said, suppressing tears. "I'm not
sure when I'll finish, but I plan to finish my degree at Stanford.;    "It was
really, really, really tough for me. It's hard to leave school and my friends.
But I had to look to the future and make an adult decision.";    Melvin
Stewart, a junior at the University of Tennessee who was fifth in the
200-meter butterfly at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, and now is the
world-record holder in the event, also renounced his college scholarship
Wednesday. He and Evans are the first of what opponents of the new NCAA rules
-- including Stanford President Donald Kennedy -- fear might be a flood of
Olympic-level athletes in individual sports to leave college competition.;   
"If these rules had been in effect when I came home from Seoul, I never would
have gone to college," Evans said.;    Stanford's Summer Sanders, a probable
Olympian who won three medals including a gold at the world championships in
January and was named this season's NCAA swimmer of the year, said she has no
plans to quit college competition.;    "Janet's a different person," Sanders
said. "I think I can get enough training (for the Olympics).";    The NCAA
adopted the rules changes in January because of poor academic performance by
athletes that many college officials felt was due to spending too many hours
on the practice field. Opponents, especially coaches and athletes in sports
such as swimming, track and wrestling, argued unsuccessfully that not only
would the 20-hour limit hurt the development of Olympic athletes, it was not
justified based on the academic performance of athletes in those sports.;   
Evans said she told Stanford Coach Richard Quick about her decision after the
NCAA women's swimming championships a week ago. Stanford finished second to
Texas after winning the championship in 1990. Evans was the team's leading
scorer in both meets.;    "It wasn't an absolute surprise," Quick said. "I'm
obviously real disappointed. I think Janet is an outstanding young lady and a
great thing for Stanford swimming and Stanford University.";    Quitting
college competition makes Evans and Stewart eligible for financial support
from U.S. Swimming, the sport's national governing body, and the U.S. Olympic
Committee. College swimmers have long been forbidden to receive such support.;
   In Evans' case, based on her past performance, that amounts to $36,000 per
year from U.S. Swimming, a one-time $3,000 grant from the USOC, and a share of
$115,000 from the USOC to be divided among gold medalists at the Pan Pacific
Swim Championships this August in Edmonton, Alberta.;    Stewart's U.S.
Swimming stipend is estimated at $20,000 annually, but he is eligible for a
$100,000 bonus from Las Vegas casino owner Bob Stupak. The bonus is posted for
the members of Stewart's Las Vegas swim club who set world records in national
championship meets.;    Evans said the money played no part in her decision,
although she says college swimmers should be eligible to receive it.;    "When
I came home from Seoul, I was told I could get $1 million if I didn't go to
college," she said. "It doesn't matter.";    The new NCAA rules were the only
reason for her departure, and many critics say the rules are punishing
individual-sports athletes unnecessarily for the deficiencies of athletes in
other sports.;    The Knight Commission, which recently issued a report on the
state of college athletics, singled out football and basketball players as
having the poorest academic performance. A just-issued survey of college
graduation rates at NCAA schools supported that assessment.;    Evans said she
had a 3.0 grade-point average for her freshman school year despite spending up
to 35 hours per week in the pool. Last fall, while training for the world
championships in which she won two golds and a silver, she said she scored a
perfect 4.0 for the quarter.;    Stewart said he carries a 3.0 average.;   
"These are the athletes who had their time and opportunity cut back because
other sports couldn't control themselves," said Jeff Dimond, spokesman for
U.S. Swimming.  </TEXT>
