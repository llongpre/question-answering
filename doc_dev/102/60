<LEADPARA>  There has been a surge in outstanding young female swimmers the last two years
in the Central Coast Section.;   Last fall, several freshman swimmers, led by
Marisa Watts of Presentation, finished among the eight finalists in the
section's eight individual events.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Watts won the 500-yard freestyle, and she was second in the 200 freestyle.;
  Freshman Katie Stuppi from Menlo School was second in the 50 freestyle and
third in the 100 freestyle, Allison Lovell of Aptos was second in the 100
backstroke and sixth in the 50 free, and Carrie Johnson of York School was
second in the 100 breaststroke and third in the 100 butterfly. The list goes
on.;   Compare that to 1988, when Karli Taylor, a senior this year at
Homestead, was the only freshman to place among the top eight swimmers in the
finals of the eight individual events, finishing fourth in the 200 individual
medley and 100 backstroke.;   That doesn't automatically mean this year's
sophomores will be as dominant as they were as freshmen.;   In this weekend's
CCS championships at Stanford's deGuerre Pool, they are going to be facing a
stiff challenge from yet another outstanding freshman class, including
Homestead's Ryann Taylor, Castilleja's Tara Hopwood, Live Oak's Amy Walthard,
Monta Vista's Laura Weiler and Willow Glen's Heather Lindman.;   Hopwood and
Taylor have been among the top five swimmers in at least four events in the
CCS this fall, and Walthard, Lindman and Weiler have been one of the top two
in their specialties.;   "I don't recall seeing this many good swimmers in
back-to-back freshman classes," said Steve Yamamoto, in his 17th season as the
coach at St. Francis. "There seems to be a resurgence in U.S. Swimming (the
national swimming federation), and that is carrying over to the high schools.;
  "Not only is there more talent, I've also noticed a growth in team (roster)
sizes and depth.";   Live Oak Coach Lynn Gautschi believes the exposure
swimming received on television during the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles
may have had something to do with the growth of competitive swimming on the
club level.;   "That's what happened to me," said Gautschi, who as Lynn Vidali
won a silver medal in the 400-meter intermediate medley at the 1968 Olympics
and a bronze in the 200 I.M. at the '72 Olympics. "I was inspired by watching
Donna De Varona win the gold medal in the 400 I.M. at the 1964 Olympics.;   "I
have five very good freshmen on my team this year, and I'm expecting another
three or four next year," Gautschi said. "It's a very exciting time for
swimming -- I'm anticipating an excellent CCS meet this year."  </TEXT>
