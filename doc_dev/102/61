Mike Barrowman was disappointed with his performance in the 1988 Olympic Games 
at Seoul. So disappointed, in fact, that he couldn't bring himself to look at 
the videotape of his swim until April. His fourth-place finish, out of medal 
contention, looked as bad as he remembered it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw that, and I saw the man that I had trained with every day being 
that disappointed, I said, 'I've got to do something about that,' " Barrowman 
said Thursday morning after breaking the world record in a preliminary heat of 
the Phillips 66/U.S. Swimming long course national championships. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman's world mark of 2 minutes 12.90 seconds in the 200-meter breaststroke 
was the first in this meet, the premier U.S. event of the season. It was also 
the first world record set this year. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman, 20, will be a junior this fall at the University of Michigan. He is 
swimming here for the Curl-Burke Swim Club near his home in Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Although Barrowman had set a U.S. record, 2:13.74, in the University of Texas 
pool last summer during the Olympic trials and had tied it in the finals, he 
had never held a world record. 
</P>
<P>
The record that he broke Thursday morning of 2:13.34 was set by Victor Davis of 
Canada when he won the Olympic gold medal in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Barrowman broke the record in the same lane of the pool on the USC 
campus that Davis had used in setting it. 
</P>
<P>
There was no one near him during his morning swim. It was Barrowman against the 
clock, doing exactly what he had set out to do when he started his long-course 
training. 
</P>
<P>
Barrowman was the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. champion in the 200-yard 
breaststroke for Michigan. And he placed second in the 100-yard breaststroke. 
But he chose not to swim the 100-meter event in this meet because his coach, 
Joseph Nagy, wanted him to concentrate on the 200. 
</P>
<P>
Nagy, who is from Hungary, but is in the United States because his wife is on 
temporary duty with World Bank in Washington, D.C., also prepared Barrowman for 
the Olympic trials and the Olympic Games.
