Texas extended its lead over USC at the NCAA swimming and diving championships 
when Doug Gjertsen passed Dan Jorgensen in the last leg of the 800-yard 
freestyle relay Friday. 
</P>
<P>
After two days, Texas leads USC, 360-291. Stanford is third with 231 points. 
UCLA is sixth with 175. 
</P>
<P>
Texas led the relay until the 600-yard mark, when Dave Wharton of USC passed 
Matt Stahlman of Texas. Wharton made up more than one second on his leg. But 
Gjertsen was waiting. 
</P>
<P>
Gjertsen, who earlier won the 200-yard freestyle with a time of 1:33.15, caught 
Jorgensen with 100 yards left and held on for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was confident that I could have swum faster in the relay, but I have a lot 
of swims tomorrow," Gjertsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Texas entered the session with a 17-point lead, but USC overtook the Longhorns 
for the team lead, 204-201, after three events. 
</P>
<P>
Princeton opened the evening by winning the 200-yard medley relay in an NCAA, 
American, and U.S. Open record time of 1:27.31. UCLA finished second, also 
under the old record. 
</P>
<P>
USC made its move in the 400-yard individual medley when Dave Wharton won for 
the third year in a row. Ray Looze, also of USC, was second. Wharton's time of 
3:43.62 was well off his record. 
</P>
<P>
Wharton led by a body length after 100 yards and steadily pulled away. Looze's 
time of 3:47.08 was a lifetime best. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100-yard butterfly, Anthony Nesty of Florida pulled away from the field 
to win with a time of 46.62 seconds. Although Shaun Jordan of Texas finished 
second, USC continued to hold an advantage because Erik Ran finished fourth and 
Brad Bailey was 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Nesty, who won the 100-meter butterfly at the Seoul Olympics, trailed Ran at 
the 50-yard mark and pulled ahead at 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Trojans' advantage was short lived. Texas won the next two events, 
Gjertsen the 200-yard freestyle and Kirk Stackle the 100-yard breaststroke. 
</P>
<P>
In the next event, the three-meter springboard, Donie Scott of Southern 
Methodist defeated Thursday night's one-meter champion Mark Lenzi of Indiana, 
974.55-663.90.
