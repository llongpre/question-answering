FT  31 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Popov wins second freestyle title
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alexander Popov of the CIS, who toppled Matt Biondi in the 100 metres
freestyle on Tuesday, grabbed a second Olympic swimming title from the big
American in the men's 50m freestyle.
Popov never hurried his long stroke but Biondi could not catch him in the
one-length thrash, shortest race in the swimming programme.
Popov touched home in 21.91 seconds, with Biondi taking the silver in 22.09
and American world champion Tom Jager the bronze in 22.30. Jager was silver
medallist behind Biondi in Seoul. Victory gave the Unified Team golds in all
the men's individual freestyle events from 50m to 400m, with Popov victor in
the 50m and 100m and Evgeny Sadovyi champion in the 200m and 400m. They also
won the 4 x 200m freestyle relay in world record time.
