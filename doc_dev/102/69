<LEADPARA>  THE INTERNATIONAL Olympic Committee's executive committee is deciding this
weekend in Barcelona, Spain, whether to do away with synchronized swimming in
its current solo and duet format.;    If the proposal is approved and later
ratified by the full IOC in June, synchronized swimming would become a
competition for eight-woman teams only, beginning with the 1996 Atlanta
Olympics.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In effect, the number of gold medals at stake in the sport would be cut in
half at a time when Bay Area swimmers rank at the top of the national and
international standings.;    Nevertheless, U.S. Synchronized Swimming, the
sport's national governing body, favors the change because it believes the
team event is more entertaining and because, with more people having a chance
at making the team, it better promotes the sport. The athletes agree.;    "I
think it's better because the team sport . . . is the real heart of
synchronized swimming," San Jose's Becky Dyroen told the Associated Press on
Friday. Dyroen and Heather Simmons, both of whom swim for the Santa Clara
Aquamaids, were on the gold-medal-winning team at January's world
championships in Australia with six members of the Walnut Creek Aquanuts.;   
Even twins Sarah and Karen Josephson, who won the world duet gold and also
competed with Dyroen and Simmons in the team event, supported the change.;   
"We're both excited about it," Sarah Josephson said. "The team is the most
exciting event in synchronized swimming. You can do a lot more interesting and
intricate things.";    The change in synchronized swimming is part of a larger
proposal to increase women's participation in the Olympics while capping the
total number of athletes in the Games at the 15,000 level expected next year
in Barcelona.;    That would be accomplished by adding women's softball and
women's modern pentathlon (a combination of horse-riding, fencing,
pistol-shooting, swimming and cross-country running now contested only by men)
to the Olympic program beginning in Atlanta. Taekwondo, a martial art that was
a demonstration sport in the last two Olympics; bowling, an exhibition sport
in 1988 and supported by the U.S. Olympic Committee for full Olympic status;
and whitewater canoe-kayak, an Olympic event only in 1972 and in Barcelona,
would be dropped.;    Two additional sports pushed by the USOC for inclusion
in the Games, racquetball and the triathlon, were not approved by the IOC's
program commission.;  EVANS TO TEXAS: Janet Evans' decision to train under
University of Texas Coach Mark Schubert in Austin was not surprising,
especially since Schubert is considered a top distance coach and heavily
recruited her before she decided to join the Stanford swim team in 1989.;   
Evans is most concerned with working on her breaststroke, which she said had
deteriorated after being changed by Stanford Coach Richard Quick. Evans blamed
weakness in the breaststroke for her losses last season in the 400 individual
medley, an event she won at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.;    Although Evans will
now be able to accept about $39,000 a year in support from U.S. Swimming --
which is prohibited by the NCAA -- she could have made more money by accepting
an offer to join the Las Vegas Gold swim team. Gold swimmers are eligible to
receive a $100,000 bonus from the team's sponsor, a casino owner, if they
break world records.;  FLYING HIGH: Olympian Mike Buncic of Campbell threw the
discus 227 feet, 7 inches at the Fresno Relays, the longest throw in the world
this year. It easily topped his personal record of 226-4, which he threw four
years ago. The world record, set in 1986 by East Germany's Jurgen Schult, is
243-0.;  AREA ATHLETES: Former Stanford women's basketball players Jennifer
Azzi, Sonja Henning and Katy Steding have received invitations to try out for
the Pan American and World University games teams this summer. The tryouts are
May 30 through June 2 in Colorado Springs, Colo. Stanford tied with Texas and
Auburn with the most invitations. All three players have previous
international experience, Azzi and Henning on last year's world championship
and Goodwill Games teams, and Steding on the U.S. team that played the Soviet
Union and Yugoslavia. . . . Brian Hendrick of Cal and Adam Keefe of Stanford
will attend next week's tryouts for the men's Pan Am team. . . . Outfielder
Jeffrey Hammonds of Stanford is among the first 14 players of an eventual 30
to be invited to try out for the Pan Am baseball team. That team will play a
27-game international schedule, which will include a five-game series in Japan
this summer in preparation for the Pan Am Games.  </TEXT>
