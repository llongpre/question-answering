Freshman Jeff Rouse of Stanford won the 200-yard backstroke as Olympic silver 
medalist David Berkoff of Harvard ended his competitive career by placing 
second Saturday in the men's National Collegiate Athletic Assn. Swimming and 
Diving Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Texas, helped by Shaun Jordan's victory in the 100 freestyle, a first in the 
400-freestyle relay and a second by defending champion Kirk Stackle in the 200 
breaststroke, won the team title for the second consecutive year. The Longhorns 
finished with 475 points. Stanford, which had its string of three consecutive 
titles snapped last year, was second at 396. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan was third with 315, UCLA fourth with 313.5 and USC fifth with 304. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Reese of Texas was selected coach of the year. 
</P>
<P>
USC's David Wharton, who swept the two medley events earlier in the meet, 
received the swimmer of the year award for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Rouse, the runner-up to Berkoff when he set an American record in the 100 
backstroke Friday, won in 1:44.87 seconds. Berkoff, who set a world record in 
the preliminaries of the 100-meter backstroke at the Seoul Olympics and won the 
silver medal, finished at 1:45.88. 
</P>
<P>
"The 200 isn't his race," Rouse said. "He's better in the 100, but it does make 
me feel good to beat a world record-holder. I believe I'm a little better at 
the 200 than David Berkoff. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a sense of where he was, but I never really looked at him." 
</P>
<P>
Rouse made an error on his final turn. "I jammed the wall," he said. "I was 
expected to take another stroke and all of a sudden, the wall was there. . . . 
I misjudged it. That's happened to me before, but it was a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, a member of the U.S. Olympic team last year, took the 100 freestyle in 
42.98. USC's Erik Ran of the Netherlands, who was disqualified in two races 
during the meet, was second in 43.08. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Barrowman of Michigan, who set an American record in the 200-meter 
breaststroke at the Olympic trials last year and took fourth at Seoul, won the 
200 breaststroke in 1:55.72 with Stackle, who won the 100 breaststroke Friday, 
second at 1:57.01. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona freshman Mariusz Podkoscielny, a Polish Olympian last year, won the 
NCAA title and was on pace to set a U.S. Open and NCAA mark in the 1,650 
freestyle until the final 50 yards. His winning time of 14:38.09 was 17 seconds 
faster than the runner-up in his heat and just missed the record of 14:37.87 
set by Stanford's Jeff Kostoff in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
John Witchel of Stanford, who swam his heat earlier, placed second in 14:49.69. 
California's Sean Killion, who also raced in an earlier heat, was third in 
14:52.31. 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee's Melvin Stewart, a freshman who was fifth in the 200-meter butterfly 
at Seoul, won the 200 butterfly in a race in which the top three swimmers 
finished within 0.7 of a second of each other. Stewart finished in 1:44.30. 
Bart Pippenger of Nevada Las Vegas was next in 1:44.60, and Wharton was third 
in 1:44.98. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Methodist's Scott Donnie won the 10-meter platform diving with 757.45 
points. Pat Evans of Cincinnati, who won the three-meter event Friday and 
placed second on the one-meter Thursday, was second at 708.80 and was voted 
diver of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Hobie Billingsley, retiring after 31 years at Indiana, tied Cincinnati's 
Charlie Kasuto for diving coach of the year honors. 
</P>
<P>
There were several surprises in the preliminaries. USC's Dan Jorgensen, the 
defending champion in the 1,650 freestyle, had a time of 15:09.89 and placed 
14th. 
</P>
<P>
Michigan's Brent Lang, who won the 50 freestyle on Thursday, was disqualified 
for a false start when he tried to defend the 100 free championship. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana diver Mark Lenzi, who won the one meter and finished second at three 
meters, withdrew after injuring his wrist on his third dive off the 10-meter 
platform in the preliminaries. Lenzi attempted one more dive before 
withdrawing. 
</P>
<P>
The injury was not expected to keep Lenzi out of the indoor national 
championships coming up later this month.
