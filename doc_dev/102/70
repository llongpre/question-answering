<LEADPARA>  Cuban boxers won 11 final bouts Sunday, on the final day of the Pan American
Games, in a show of force that confirmed their superiority and secured the
island's victory against the United States in the gold medal race.;   By the
time Fidel Castro declared the games over a few hours later, Cuba had 140
golds, 10 more than the United States, which hadn't come in second since the
inaugural games in 1951. The United States led in overall medals with 352 to
Cuba's 265, allowing each country to claim a victory of sorts.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For the Cubans, this was a time to revel in victory, to enjoy watching
Castro bounce up and down with them as waves swept around the boxing arena. As
much pride as the Cubans took in their golds, they took more perhaps in the
knowledge that they had successfully completed a costly, high-profile
international event despite the pressures of the U.S. economic embargo and the
Soviet cutback in aid.;   Only one song interrupted the repeated playing of
the Cuban national anthem. Steve Johnston, at 18 the youngest U.S. fighter,
won the gold with a decision over Mexico's Edgar Ruiz in the 139-pound class.
Castro stood for "The Star-Spangled Banner" under the 50-foot mural of Che
Guevara just as he had for his own favorite.;   Castro was said to be so
inspiring to his countryman that he was worth five runs in baseball, four
points in basketball, three seconds in swimming, two seconds in track and at
least a point in every fight.;   He didn't bother going to the pool on the
last day, avoiding the five golds won by U.S. swimmers in six races.;   In
men's races, Ronald Karnaugh won the 200-meter individual medley, Alex Kostich
the 1,500 freestyle, and the U.S. men won the 400 medley relay. In women's
races, Susan Gottlieb won the 200 butterfly, Diana Trimble the 200 backstroke,
and Canada's Kristen Topham won the 50 freestyle in Pan Am record time.;   If
the Cubans had little to cheer about at the pool, they made up for it at the
boxing arena. In seven of the final bouts, the Cubans knocked out or stopped
their opponents with ease. Four knockouts came in the first round. The 11 gold
medals surpassed the record of 10 boxing golds, set by the Cubans in
Indianapolis in 1987.;   Three of the Cubans' victims were U.S. boxers as the
U.S. team went home with its worst Pan Am showing in 40 years.;   "This is the
best team in the world without any doubt," said Cuba's Julio Gonzales, who
battered Patrice Brooks of the United States for three rounds to win the gold
at 132 pounds.;   "They're ranked No. 1 in the world right now, and I think
they probably should be," said Kenneth Friday, who lost to Cuba's Arnaldo Mesa
at 125 pounds.; TOP PERFORMANCES BY BAY AREA ATHLETES; (box) ALEX KOSTICH,
STANFORD, SWIMMING: Won the 1,500-meter freestyle in 15 minutes, 21.36 seconds
for his second gold medal. He earlier won the 400 individual medley.;   (box)
SEAN KILLION, FORMERLY OF CAL, SWIMMING: Was scratched from the 1,500
freestyle because of a paperwork error by the U.S. Olympic Committee. He
earlier set a games record in winning the 400 freestyle.;   (box) ANGIE
WESTER-KRIEG, CAMPBELL, SWIMMING: The former San Jose State swimmer finished
second in the 200 butterfly.;   (box) RAY LOOZE, BELMONT, SWIMMING: Finished
third in the 200 individual medley.  </TEXT>
