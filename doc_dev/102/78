<TEXT>     Sanders, who recorded the second-fastest 400-yard individual medley time
ever Friday, lowered the NCAA record in the 200 butterfly Saturday to 1
minute, 54.17 seconds. Mary T. Meagher had set the record of 1:54.52 in 1988.
Erika Hansen of Texas was second in 1:57.44.;    "It's hard to be excited and
upset at the same time, because we got so close," Sanders said. "I'm pleased
with my times but upset that we didn't win.";    Stanford entered the day six
points ahead of the Longhorns, but Texas placed three swimmers in the top six
of the 200 backstroke to move into first place for good. Texas finished with
746 points. Stanford was second with 653 and Cal took fourth with 275.;   
Evans was unchallenged in winning the grueling 1,650 freestyle for the second
year. The triple gold medalist in the 1988 Olympics, who won two golds in this
year's world championships, was ahead of her U.S. record pace before slowing
slightly in her final 500 yards.;    Evans, a sophomore, finished in 15:45.98,
about seven seconds slower than her record. Miami's Kimberly Small, second
throughout the race, had a career-best 15:59.72.;    "I feel like it's just 66
laps back and forth and nothing ever changes for me," Evans said of the race.
"Sometimes I feel like it would be nice if someone would push me."; BASEBALL:
Strong complete-game performances by Santa Clara's starting pitchers enabled
the Broncos (15-14, 9-7) to sweep host San Diego State (12-16-2, 6-9) in a
West Coast Conference doubleheader.;    In the first game, junior Vince Fultz
struck out a career-high 11 and scattered six hits in a 12-2 seven-inning
victory. Fultz (4-4) didn't allow a walk, cruising after SCU scored six in the
fourth inning to take a 7-0 lead.;    Staff ace Dave Tuttle threw a
five-hitter in the second game as the Broncos came back from a 2-0 deficit to
win 3-2. It was the Broncos' sixth straight victory.;    San Jose State
drubbed Western Oregon State 12-4 in a non-conference game at Spartan Field.; 
  Jorge Mora (3 for 3, 2 RBIs) and Ken Henderson (3 for 4) led the Spartans'
12-hit attack. SJS (13-12) took a 7-1 lead by scoring five runs in the bottom
of the second inning. Western Oregon fell to 2-12.; GYMNASTICS: Cal scored
187.7 points to win the Spartan Games women's meet at San Jose State. SJS
finished third in the five-team event. Cal's Kristen Smyth won the all-around
title with 38.45 points.;    UCLA's Scott Keswick won the all-around title at
the men's Pacific 10 Invitational in Los Angeles. Stanford's Jair Lynch won
the floor and parallel bars events and placed third overall.  </TEXT>
