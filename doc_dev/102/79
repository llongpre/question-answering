<LEADPARA>  THE 50-METER butterfly match race between Tom Jager and Mark Spitz on April 13
in Mission Viejo took on a special significance for local swimming fans.;   
Spitz and Jager both have represented the Santa Clara Swim Club. Spitz, who
was with Santa Clara early in his career, holds a record of seven gold medals
in the 1972 Munich Summer Olympics that may never be seriously challenged.
Jager, a world record holder in the 50 freestyle, still represents the club.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Jager, 26, dealt a severe blow to the comeback attempt of Spitz, 41, by
winning the made-for-television event with a time of 24.92 seconds. Spitz
finished in 26.70 seconds.;    The Santa Clara Swim Club has enjoyed much
success in its 25 years of existence, and marquee athletes like Jager and
Spitz enhance the club's image. Santa Clara has finished in the top ten at the
Senior Nationals for six straight years, and earlier this month took first
among teams from throughout the Western States in the Far Western Age Group
Championships. But coach Jay Fitzgerald believes that the foundation of his
team's success lies in the younger, less experienced swimmers.;    "Age group
swimming feeds the Olympic games in much the same way that high school and
college football feed the NFL," said Fitzgerald, who was recently named head
coach of the United States team that will compete in the World University
Games.;    Fitzgerald came to Santa Clara from a coaching position with a
Cincinnati-based team in 1985 and found a program that he believed was lacking
the proper focus on younger swimmers. His first priority was changing the
coaching emphasis of the club.;    A staff of six assistant coaches and a
secretary help Fitzgerald handle the 212-member team. The team's facilities at
the Santa Clara International Swim Club are still considered one of the area's
best despite the center's age. The complex includes an Olympic-sized pool, a
10-meter diving pool, and a smaller practice pool.;    Fitzgerald seems like
an intense coach able to motivate and challenge his swimmers without demanding
too much from them. "A lot of the team's success is based on the rank and
file," Fitzgerald said, "Only a small percentage of elite swimmers are able to
compete on the national level.";    Senior and High School coach Bill Zirzow,
known by most at the club as as "Coach Z," is an integral part of Santa
Clara's program. Zirzow works with an experienced group of swimmers inherited
from age group coach Danny Dike and entry level coach Norm Havercroft.;   
"Coach Z is great at communicating with the swimmers. He tells them not to let
their egos get wrapped up in their (race) times. They should be proud of
taking on the challenge of participating on the team," Fitzgerald said.;   
Instead of throwing young swimmers into intense competition, coaches try to
instill the basic fundamentals of strokes, turns and dives into the
youngsters. Once a swimmer is well-schooled in these areas, a gradual advance
to higher levels of competition may begin, according to Fitzgerald.;   
Winning isn't everything;    Fitzgerald believes that coaches shouldn't be
judged on their technical expertise alone. "Nobody cares how much you know,
until they know how much you care," Fitzgerald said when summarizing his
coaching philosophy. The staff stresses that winning isn't everything.;   
This restrained style of coaching helps individual swimmers develop at their
own pace, while increasing their self esteem. "An emphasis on the elite
swimmers may lead to short-term gains, but the team's long-term goals are
based on the lower rungs of the ladder," Fitzgerald said.;    Santa Clara's
latest promising swimmer, 11-year old Suzy Nicoletti, was featured in the
April issue of Swimmer's World magazine as an age group swimmer of the month.;
   Nicoletti is a straight A student at Sacred Heart Elementary School in
Saratoga. Last year, Nicoletti finished the season with 14 rankings in the
National Age Group Top 16 out of a possible 21 events. Nicoletti, who
specializes in the breast stroke, aspires to swim on the 1996 Olympic team.;  
 Three bound for England;    Three Santa Clara team members have qualified for
the World University Games in England in July. Kris Stoudt and Becky Shelton
qualified for the women's team in the 100 fly and 200 backstroke respectively.
Dan Kutler, who attended Cupertino High School, will represent Santa Clara in
the 100 butterfly. All three swimmers attend UCLA.;    Santa Clara won the Far
Western Age Group Championship at Independence High School in San Jose from
April 4 through 7, for the seventh consecutive year, outscoring their closest
competitor, Sacramento's California Capital Aquatics, 544.5 to 305.;   
Fitzgerald and the rest of the Santa Clara team are looking forward to the
Santa Clara Invitational at Santa Clara International Swim Center July 5-7.  </TEXT>
