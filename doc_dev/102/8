<LEADPARA>  The United States lived up to its pre-meet billing Saturday at the World
Swimming Championships in Perth, Australia, and Stanford's Janet Evans was one
of the big reasons why.;    Evans won her second gold medal with a meet record
of 8 minutes, 24.05 seconds in the 800-meter freestyle. Evans, who won the 400
freestyle Wednesday, broke the 13-year-old record of 8:24.94 by Australia's
Tracey Wickham.;    The next-to-last night of the meet was a highlight for the
U.S. team. U.S. swimmers won five of six gold medals, with Melvin Stewart in
the 200 butterfly, Tom Jager of the Santa Clara Swim Club in the 50 freestyle,
Evans in the 800 freestyle, Jeff Rouse in the 100 backstroke and the women's
400 medley relay team taking titles.  </LEADPARA>
