Stanford won five of seven events Tuesday to increase its lead at the Pacific 
10 Conference men's swim championships at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal has 626 points, well ahead of second-place UCLA, which has 440. 
</P>
<P>
USC is third with 405 points. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford opened the session by winning the 200-yard medley relay with a 
conference record time of 1:28.54. Arizona was second. 
</P>
<P>
In the next event, Dave Wharton of USC waited until the last 25 yards to pull 
away from the field in the 400-yard individual medley. Wharton's time of 
3:51.10 was under the NCAA qualifying standard, but not as fast as Wharton 
wanted to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd hoped to be under 3:50, but my backstroke and breaststroke need a little 
work," said Wharton, the NCAA champion in the 200- and 400-yard individual 
medley events the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford won the next two events when seniors Doug Lillydahl and John Witchel 
won the 100-yard butterfly and the 200-yard freestyle, respectively. Lillydahl 
pulled away from the pack with 25 yards remaining, winning in a lifetime best 
of 47.63. Keith Dennison of Arizona State was second. 
</P>
<P>
"This time rearranges my goals," said Lillydahl. "I hoped to break 48. This was 
my best time by nearly a second." 
</P>
<P>
Witchel out-touched UCLA sophomore Brian Kurza at the finish, with a time of 
1:36.61. 
</P>
<P>
In the 100-yard breaststroke, UCLA sophomore Andrea Cecchi held off Stanford's 
Sam Schwartz and Matt Rodgers to win in an NCAA qualifying time of 54.32. 
</P>
<P>
The last individual event of the night, the 100-yard backstroke, pitted three 
UCLA swimmers against three Stanford swimmers. Cardinal swimmers went 1-3-5, 
led by sophomore Jeff Rouse, who out-touched Bruin Mark Thompson, 48.89-48.97. 
</P>
<P>
The meet concludes tonight, with finals starting at 6 p.m.
