<LEADPARA>  A referee's call knocked a two-time U.S. champion out of the Olympic Festival
boxing field Saturday.;    Sergio Reyes, a Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune,
N.C., was disqualified late in the third round of his 119-pound fight against
Sean Fletcher of the Navy because of a low blow. Referee Jim Quigley had
already warned Reyes twice for ducking below the waist.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     At the time of the disqualification, Reyes was ahead on points 42-29
according to the electronic scoring system being used for the first time in
the United States.;    "It's the referee's job to decide that," said Reyes,
who hadn't lost since the Olympic Trials in 1988. "Maybe it was a low blow. I
thought it was a good body shot.;    "Maybe the loss was a good thing for me.
I've gone undefeated for three years and I need a break. But I'll be the guy
to beat in '92. I'm still going to Barcelona.";    Eric Griffin of Houston, a
two-time world champion at 106 pounds, beat Dan Davis of Philadelphia 54-10.
Two-time U.S. champ Oscar De La Hoya, a 132-pounder fighting in front of his
hometown fans, hammered Dezi Ford of Alliance, Ohio, 37-6.;    Another
national champion, heavyweight John Bray of Van Nuys advanced to the final by
beating Shannon Briggs of Brooklyn, N.Y., 25-16.;    With the new scoring
setup, the five judges seated at ringside push buttons when they see a boxer
land a scoring blow. Three of the five must record the punch, and they must do
so within one second for the punch to be credited.;    A computer records the
scores of all five judges.;  FIGURE SKATING: U.S. pairs champions Todd Sand of
Costa Mesa and Natasha Kuchiki of Canoga Park took the lead after skating
flawlessly in the original program, which counts for one-third of the total
score.;    U.S. champion Todd Eldredge of San Diego and Nicole Bobek, 13, of
Chicago led the men's and women's original programs, respectively.;  SWIMMING:
Steve West of Huntington Beach broke a festival record when he swam the
100-meter breaststroke in 1 minute, 4.10 seconds. That eclipsed the mark of
1:04.21, set in 1982 by Robert Lager in Indianapolis.;    Mikey Flaherty, 15,
who is from Baltimore but attends a boarding school in New Jersey, tied the
festival record in the women's 400 individual medley with a time of 4:53.45,
her personal best by four seconds. The record was set 10 years ago by Patty
Gavin in Syracuse, N.Y.;  CANOEING: The festival's top career medal winner,
Jim Terrell of El Toro, won two races to increase his cache to 15 golds and 25
medals overall. He won the C-1 1,000-meter race and teamed with Stewart Carr
of Indianapolis to win the C-2 1,000-meter race.;  TOP PERFORMANCES BY BAY
