Stanford got off to a fast start by winning three of five events Friday at the 
Pacific 10 Conference women's swimming championships at East Los Angeles 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinal leads California, 519 to 376. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA is third at 340, Arizona State fourth at 304 and USC is fifth at 236. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Stanford senior Katie Connors won the one-meter springboard diving 
event at the McDonald's Swim Stadium at USC. 
</P>
<P>
Connor edged UCLA freshman Kristen Walls, 410.85 to 409.65. Because the East L. 
A. pool has no diving facilities, those events are being held at USC. The 
three-meter springboard finals are today at 1:30 p.m. and the 10-meter platform 
is Sunday at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Stanford took up where Connors left off. After Cal won the 200-yard freestyle 
relay, the Cardinal depth took over. Janet Evans led four Stanford swimmers in 
the championship final of the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:43.74. In the 
next event, the 200-yard individual medley, Stanford swimmers placed first, 
third, fifth, sixth and seventh, led by freshman Janel Jorgensen in 2:02.81. 
Teri O'Laughlin of USC was second in 2:03.67. 
</P>
<P>
Kris Stoudt of UCLA won the 50-yard freestyle with an NCAA qualifying time of 
23.36 to give the Bruins their only victory. 
</P>
<P>
The Pac-10 men's diving championship started as UCLA sophomore Chris Dudka won 
the three-meter springboard. He defeated USC's Brian Earley, 551.40 to 527.05.
