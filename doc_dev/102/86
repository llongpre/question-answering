<LEADPARA>  While tighter NCAA training restrictions were cited as sophomore Janet Evans'
reason for leaving the Stanford swim team, dissatisfaction with Coach Richard
Quick played a role as well.;    Thursday, Evans refused to rule out the
possibility that she might train privately with Quick for the 1992 Barcelona
Olympics similar to the way Tennessee's Melvin Stewart, who also renounced his
college eligibility Wednesday, said he'll continue to train with his college
coach.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  DISSATISFACTION WITH COACH ALSO LED TO EVANS'
DEPARTURE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "I'll decide that next week," Evans said.;    "(Leaving Stanford) is
something I did for myself. There are a lot of things combined in the
decision, and there's not one thing in particular I can point to.";    But
Quick, the U.S. Olympic coach in 1988, said Evans "will definitely not be
training at Stanford next year.;    "I believe she wasn't happy with her
results at the world championships (in January) and the NCAA's (in March), and
coaching is part of that.";    Neither Quick nor Evans would discuss the
specifics of that dissatisfaction. But Evans, a triple gold medalist at the
1988 Olympics, had seen her performances eclipsed this season by new Stanford
teammate Summer Sanders.;    Sanders was named NCAA swimmer of the year after
winning three events at the college nationals, including beating Evans in the
400-yard individual medley, the only race in which they compete head-to-head.;
   Evans went undefeated in the 400 I.M. from 1988, when she won the Olympic
400-meter I.M. (the international version of the race), until Sanders upset
her last summer in the Goodwill Games.;    Shortly thereafter, Quick signed
Sanders to a scholarship for Stanford. Sanders subsequently won the 400 I.M.
at the NCAA's (Evans won at the Pacific 10 Conference meet) and finished third
at world's, one place ahead of Evans.;    Although they were not close
friends, living across campus from each other and training separately in the
pool, Sanders said "Anybody could tell (Evans) was real unhappy with the way
she was swimming.";    Evans said Wednesday she would miss her teammates and
friends at Stanford, but didn't mention Quick. She said her decision to leave
was discussed only with her parents and announced later to Quick.;    Evans'
mother, Barbara, had urged Janet to swim for Texas, Stanford's arch-rival in
swimming, when Janet was considering scholarship offers in 1989. She watched
Janet's 800-meter victory Wednesday night at the U.S. Swimming Spring
Nationals wearing a Texas sweat shirt.  </TEXT>
