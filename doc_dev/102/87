<TEXT>     "It turned out to be more fun than I thought," Satow said after winning
three events and swimming the fastest time in the Central Coast Section this
season in the 50-yard freestyle (25.01 seconds).;   Satow also won the 100
individual medley (1 minute, 2.39 seconds) and 50 butterfly (27.71). She was
the only swimmer to win more than one individual event.;   "I didn't think I
would do this well because I haven't been training that hard," said Satow, who
finished fourth in both the 50 and 100 at last November's CCS meet. "I do feel
a lot stronger than I did at this time last year.";   The team title went to
Leland, which came as a surprise to Chargers Coach Mike Haake.;   "K.C. Mosher
won the 200 fly and Laura Ferguson finished second in the 50 breast, which
provided us with points we didn't expect," Haake said, "and our A and B relay
teams contributed some big points.;   "We don't really have any stars on this
team, but we do have some quality depth, and that was probably the difference
for us today.";   Mosher, who was seeded fifth in the 200 butterfly, was the
only Leland swimmer to win an event.;   Leland finished with 244 points. St.
Francis (212) finished second and Menlo School (202) third.;   The previous
Saturday, Leland won the Menlo Relays, edging runners-up Palo Alto and Menlo
School by two points.;   Palo Alto placed fifth with 195 points but probably
would have fared better had it not been missing five of its top swimmers,
Coach John Williams said.;   "We were missing two girls off our 200 free relay
team, where we usually do very well," Williams noted.;   Palo Alto, which won
the 400 freestyle and 200 medley relays, finished 12th in the 200 freestyle
relay with a time of 1:57.58. The Vikings entered the meet ranked third in the
CCS in the 200 freestyle at 1:48.15.;   Williams was happy with the
performances of four of his swimmers -- juniors Susanna Greenwood and Jennifer
Davis, sophomore Evi-Lynn Byer and senior Carolyn Higgerson.;   Byer won the
200 backstroke and placed third in the 200 butterfly, Greenwood and Higgerson
won the 50 backstroke and 50 breaststroke, respectively, and Davis finished
second in the 1,000 freestyle and third in the 200 backstroke.;   The quartet
teamed to win the 400 freestyle and 200 medley relays.  </TEXT>
