<LEADPARA>  Phil Mickelson escaped the chilly embrace of a snowman in the desert Sunday
and, with birdies on two of the last three holes, gained a little piece of
golfing history by winning a PGA tournament in Tucson, Ariz.;    In golfers'
parlance, a "snowman" is a score of 8 on a hole. Mickelson, 20, struggled to
an 8 on the 14th hole but recovered to become only the second amateur since
1954 to win a PGA Tour event. Scott Verplank won the 1985 Western Open as an
amateur.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mickelson fell from a one-stroke lead to a three-stroke deficit and a tie
for fifth when he left the 14th green.;    But the left-handed Mickelson, a
junior at Arizona State, took advantage of a massive collapse by veteran pros
and triumphed with a final round of 71 to finish at 272, 16 under par.;    "I
went from having the biggest knot in my stomach to the greatest joy in a
half-hour," Mickelson said.;    Mickelson's debacle on the par-5 14th appeared
to drop him out of contention and leave the struggle to Tom Purtzer and former
PGA champion Bob Tway.;    But both Purtzer and Tway blew the lead on the
final holes, and Mickelson made an eight-foot putt on the 18th hole to win
it.;    "He's a kid you'd like to have as a son or brother," said Purtzer, who
tied Tway for second at 273.;    "I just want them to make sure he stays in
school for two more years.";    And that's Mickelson's plan.;    As an
amateur, he could not accept the $180,000 first prize.;    "Money is not a
problem," Mickelson said. "I'm on a scholarship and my folks help me.";
SWIMMING: Joerg Hoffmann shattered one of swimming's longest-standing world
records, chopping more than four seconds off Vladimir Salnikov's mark in the
1,500-meter freestyle at the World Swimming Championships in Perth, Australia.
Hoffmann won in 14 minutes, 50.36 seconds. The previous record of 14:54.72 was
set by Salnikov in 1983. Stanford's Summer Sanders got her first gold medal
after earning a silver and a bronze earlier in the meet. She won the women's
200 butterfly in 2:09.24, almost two seconds better than runner-up Rie Shito
of Japan, at 2:11.06. Tamas Darnyi broke the two-minute barrier in the 200
individual medley, his second world mark and second title of the meet. Darnyi,
defending world and Olympic champion, won in 1:59.36 to shatter David
Wharton's 1989 mark of 2:03.10. . . . The United States won the final event of
the championships, the men's 400 medley relay, in a meet-record time of
3:39.66.; BOXING: Former World Boxing Association heavyweight champion Michael
"Dynamite" Dokes was arrested for investigation of  drug charges, Las Vegas
police said. Dokes, 32, was booked Saturday night for investigation of
possession of cocaine, influence of a controlled substance, resisting arrest,
destruction of evidence, speeding and failing to register with police as an
ex-felon, said a city police desk officer. Dokes was released Sunday morning
after posting a bond for $9,800.; MISCELLANY: Maryanne Jenkins, the wife of
newly elected baseball Hall of Fame member Ferguson Jenkins, died Saturday at
an Oklahoma City hospital from injuries she suffered in an automobile accident
last month, said the Rev. Ed Fleming, a hospital chaplain. Mrs. Jenkins is
survived by her husband, 47, and their two children, ages 5 years and 16
months.  </TEXT>
