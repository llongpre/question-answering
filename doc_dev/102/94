   Maybe Matt Biondi won't be going to Disneyland after all. 

   Walt Disney Co. filmed commercials with the American swimmer at poolside right after he won the gold medal for the men's 100-meter freestyle. 
Like quarterback Phil Simms and skater Brian Boitano who appeared in such commercials before him, Mr. Biondi was asked what's next and replied: "I'm going to Disneyland." 

   For the current Games in Seoul, South Korea, Disney arranged with National Broadcasting Co. to tape similar spots. 
It also signed up the athletes. 
But when NBC began taping Mr. Biondi at poolside after his sprint to gold in the 100-meter freestyle, an Olympics official blew the whistle. 

   The International Olympic Committee, which had ruled that ads taped at Olympic venues would violate its standards against commercializing the Games, threatened to revoke Mr. Biondi's medals and cancel his eligibility if the taping continued. 

   Disney -- which hurriedly canceled commercial plans it had for diver Greg Louganis, swimmer Janet Evans and track stars Carl Lewis and Florence Griffith Joyner, among others -- calls it "ludicrous" to suggest it was trying to corrupt the Games with a crass promotion. 

   But it rejected filming the same ads outside the Olympic site, as it had done with Mr. Boitano. 
"The immediacy and actuality of the venue is the thing. 
We're not going to stage these things," says Thomas Elrod, senior vice president for marketing at Walt Disney Attractions. 

   Without Mr. Biondi and company, Disney is running other commercials in the Olympic slots it had already purchased at certain local NBC stations. 
Mr. Elrod calls it "a minor setback," although he declines to discuss how much Disney is spending on the advertising campaign and just what the problem may have cost the company. 

   Meanwhile, a spokeswoman for Mr. Biondi says that the swimmer already has received payment from Disney, which goes to a trust fund to protect his amateur ranking. 
While Disney and the Biondi spokeswoman don't give figures, Sports inc. magazine says athletes were promised $30,000 to more than $75,000 each for the spots. 

   How did Disney foul up? 
The company concedes that while it thought it had gained permission from Olympic officials for ads at the venues, it apparently hadn't. 

   Like a hurdler recovering from a false start, though, Disney isn't giving up on the "I'm going to Disneyland" theme. (It uses the same approach to promote Disney World in Florida.) 
The World Series is next. 
And the company doesn't expect any problems getting professional baseball stars to accept its money.
