Lauren Droshe of Thousand Oaks High posted the fastest qualifying time in the 
100-yard backstroke and anchored the Lancer girls' 200-yard medley relay team 
to the day's fastest time in that event Thursday at the Southern Section 4-A 
Division swimming preliminaries at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Droshe, a sophomore, was clocked in a school-record 59.0 seconds in the 
100-yard backstroke. Ann Peters set the previous record of 59.99 in 1983.

In the relay, the Lancers trailed Dos Pueblos until Droshe's freestyle leg. 
Thousand Oaks' time of 1:50.86 is nearly two seconds better than that of the 
next-fastest qualifier, El Toro (1:52.04).

Droshe also had the third-best qualifying time in the 50-yard freestyle 
(24.30).

Shauna MacEwen of Westlake also had a good day, posting the third-best time in 
the 500-yard freestyle (4:54.62) and the fourth-best time in the 200-yard 
freestyle (1:52.20). Both times were personal bests.

Lydia Barbie of Camarillo was the other Valley-area competitor to qualify in 
two events for tonight's finals. Barbie placed second in the 100-yard freestyle 
(52.68) and sixth in the 200-yard individual medley (2:09.20).
