Swimmer Jon Sieben of Australia, who broke the Olympic and world records for 
the 200-meter butterfly at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, announced his 
return to the sport less than 12 months after retiring. 
</P>
<P>
Sieben, 22, said his aim was to win the gold medal in the 200-meter butterfly 
at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Sieben upset favorite Michael Gross of West Germany in setting world and 
Olympic records and winning the gold medal in 1984. Gross has since broken 
Sieben's record. 
</P>
<P>
"While my world record was broken by Gross in 1986, I firmly believe that I 
will have both the physical fitness and mental determination to win it back in 
1992," said Sieben, who is studying for a law degree. Sieben said his first 
major goal will be to make the Australian team for the 1991 world championships 
in Perth, Australia.
