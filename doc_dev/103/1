   Archaeologists unearthed a small marble
statue buried in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 A.D., the
first such find in 13 years, newspapers reported Sunday.
   The statue, which depicts a baby boy riding a dolphin, was found
Saturday in the House of the Casti Amanti, near the center of the
abandoned city, Il Mattino of Naples and other papers reprted.
   Archaeologists said the statue was apparently to be used to
decorate a fountain in the house, but that Vesuvius erupted before
workers had a chance to set it in place. Experts said traces of
paint coloring the hair blond and eyebrows black made the find even
more valuable.
   They believe the House of Casti Amanti was owned by a baker, who
lived on one side and kept a shop on the other.
   The last statue to be found in Pompeii was a bronze dug up in
1977.
