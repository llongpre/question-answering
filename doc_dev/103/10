   Italy's minister of culture says he won't approve
construction of a four-lane highway adjacent to Pompeii's famous
ruins and across the ancient city's unexcavated necropolis.
   Carlo Vizzini, whose ministry protects and preserves
archaeological sites, said Thursday that ``in no case'' will he
approve a project ``that not only edges, but minimally touches''
excavations at Pompeii.
   Some members of Pompeii's city government proposed reducing
traffic congestion in the modern city by linking two existing
highways with a new one streching a little more than a mile along
the famous tourist attraction.
   Opponents argue the exhaust and viabrations will damage the
ancient stones, and that the highway will prevent excavation of
Roman archaeological treasures in the necropolis.
   The eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79 buried the city of
Pompeii.
   Guiseppe Galasso, a member of Parliament from the town of
Pozzuoli in the shadow of the volcano, calls the highway proposal
``the kiss of death'' for the ruins.
