FT  28 OCT 93 / Kaufman tells ITV chiefs of bleak future
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITV COMPANIES are living 'everyday life in Pompeii before Vesuvius erupts',
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP, warned yesterday.
He told Yorkshire-Tyne Tees executives that the future looked bleak when the
rules governing ownership of television companies were relaxed to allow
hostile takeovers.
Chairing a Commons national heritage committee inquiry into the BBC's
future, Mr Kaufman said ITV companies needed to face reality.
'We are talking about minnows being swept away in a tidal wave,' said the
former shadow foreign secretary.
He suggested that ITV companies should merge with the BBC and turn
themselves into software suppliers of programmes for the new age of
broadcasting which he said was just around the corner.
Currently, ITV chiefs are only dealing in millions of pounds when huge
multi-media foreign organisations are talking in terms of billions in
overseas sales, he added.
'And the overseas rivals will oust British companies on their own territory
unless they face reality,' he said.
'We are already seeing 11 per cent of the British TV audience belonging to
Mr (Rupert) Murdoch and that is before Mr Murdoch has got going and that is
before the technological revolution has arrived.'
Mr Kaufman foresaw a reasonable future for the BBC and ITV only into the
early part of the next century - after that, he predicted, their audi-ence
levels would plummet.
'It is not a question of competing in the outside world, it is competing to
keep any kind of audience in this country when the new regime arrives,' he
said.
Giving evidence, Mr Clive Leach, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees chairman and chief
executive, said he refuted Mr Kaufman's volcano analogy.
'We are aware that Vesuvius might be erupting and we want to get ourselves
organised in a planned and proper way and not be running around like scalded
cats frightened about what is going to happen,' he said.
Mr Leach asked for the moratorium, which blocks foreign takeovers of ITV
companies and which is due to end in January, to be extended.
