ON THE morning of August 24 in 79 AD, Mount Vesuvius erupted. Pliny the
Younger, living in nearby Misenum, left a harrowing account of the awful
darkness that 'came rolling over the land after us like a torrent'.
Hit by showers of volcanic debris, earthquakes and asphyxiating gases,
Pompeii, together with Oplontis and Stabiae to the east, were submerged
under pumice-stone and ash. To the west, Herculaneum was engulfed by
volcanic mud that solidified to form a stone cover 10 metres thick.
These provincial coastal towns and cities of the Roman empire were
transfixed in the first century. They remained more or less undisturbed
until 1709 when a chance discovery in Herculaneum prompted the Bourbon kings
of Naples to start excavations to recover antique sculpture to adorn their
palaces.
When Goethe visited Pompeii and Herculaneum, the passages dug by the Bourbon
miners could be explored by lamplight, and the discoveries made there were
fuelling neo-classicism. Goethe wrote in 1787: 'Many a calamity has happened
in the world, but never one that has caused so much entertainment to
posterity as this one.'
Archaeological research, restoration and maintenance at the Vesuvian sites
had been in decline since the 1950s. Walls were crumbling and wall paintings
deteriorating. The sites would have deteriorated further if an earthquake in
1980 had not jolted the Italian government into action.
In 1981, an special archaeological administration was instituted for the
Pompeii area. By 1984, it had substantial - although still insufficient -
funds and an energetic soprintendente in Professor Baldassare Conticello. He
has masterminded what he describes as a new philosophy for Pompeii; it
involves the collaboration of archaeologists, geologists, biologists,
botanists, geotechnicians, physicists and even a climatologist.
The bonus of computer expertise came when IBM Italy and Fiat Engineering
joined forces in 1987-89 to form the Neapolis consortium. It transformed the
project by setting up one of the largest ever information technology systems
for archaeology, to address the task of preserving, restoring and
interpreting Pompeii.
First, the whole 140 square-mile area was electronically mapped, to produce
a grid on to which other data could be added. That information included over
12,000 catalogue entries of individual finds, and over 8,700 digitised
colour images of wall paintings, mosaics and artefacts - thus preserving,
electronically at least, Pompeii's most fugitive and precious treasures for
posterity. Excavation notebooks dating back to 1862 were committed to disk
and, like the Herculaneum papyri, made more legible on the computer screen
in the process.
Imaging techniques were developed to simulate restoration of damaged wall
paintings, allowing restorers to experiment without touching the frescoes
themselves. Data on the function of each building has shed light on
Pompeii's ancient social, political, religious and commercial life. At the
touch of a button, the computer reveals, for example, the existence and
whereabouts of a red light district, the distribution of shops and
workshops, or even take-aways.
On site meanwhile, Conticello inaugurated a systematic restoration of
Pompeii from east to west, further excavations and a new museum. A series of
publications, exhibitions and concerts raised awareness of the area and
brought more visitors and, with them, public funding. Publishing the finds
has also protected them. The entire collection of bronze and gold stolen
from the deposit at Herculaneum in 1990 was recovered last November, because
thieves were unable to find a buyer.
The most ambitious and critical consciousness-raising exercise to date is
the spectacular travelling exhibition, 'Rediscovering Pompeii'. It comes at
a time when digging has stopped and the computer is silent, awaiting a
second phase of funding. The show features 200 treasures and artefacts -
some only recently brought to light - and demonstrates the role of the
Neapolis technology in making the classical world more accessible. After
showing at New York, Houston (where is attracted over 350,000 visitors) and
Malmo, it opened in London at the Accademia Italiana this week.
Ironically, the disaster that totally extinguished life in two days and two
nights in the first century also ensured a kind of immortality. Voices
resound in streets, houses, baths and open public spaces. Graffiti and
inscriptions record sporting triumphs and forthcoming fights, political
propaganda, and fierce expressions of love, hate and undying friendship.
Casts made from the cavities left by the fugitive Pompeiians make for
chilling death masks.
Most poignant are those of a family found sheltering in its home. Recently
excavated just outside Pompeii's city walls, they show a man raised up on
his elbow to shoulder the roof timber that has fallen, cupping his hands to
cover the nose and mouth of his pregnant wife beside him.
In the exhibition, we find the highly defined contours of a lady from
Oplontis who took flight clutching a purse full of coins, rings and gems.
That little purse, and other items such as bone dice, a bronze colander,
bowls of carbonised olives, figs and prunes, speak as eloquently as any fine
marble, bronze or mosaic.
A surprising amount survives of gardens as well as houses. Botanists working
on the recent excavation of the House of the Chaste Lovers at Pompeii have
been able to determine the precise layout and planting (through pollens,
seeds and roots) of its formal inner garden. In time this will be
reconstructed; meanwhile a larger programme of replanting is under way. The
Pompeiian love of greenery is most vividly apparent in the enchanting
frescos of a recently excavated garden room that form the centrepiece of the
show, richly adorned with luxuriant naturalistic flora and fauna.
Pompeii was a thriving commercial city. Oplontis and Herculaneum, in
contrast, were graced by the villas of the rich. The former boasts the only
surviving ancient wooden furniture (patterned by elaborate geometric
marquetry), and the fine wall painting at the supremely elegant villa
thought to have belonged to Nero's second wife Poppea. A sequence of
open-air rooms, frescoed with abundant foliage and lined with flower beds,
eases the transition between garden and house.
The garden of Herculaneum's grand Villa of the Stags has supplied much of
the finest marble statuary in the show. Its 'Drunken Hercules' is
characteristic in its robust earthiness. This Hercules is no conventional
hero. He is portrayed peeing, legs spread wide in a desperate attempt to
remain vertical.
