<LEADPARA>  VOLCANOES are one of the pivotal forces shaping the planet. About 80 percent
of Earth's surface is volcanic in origin, and gases escaping from volcanic
vents over hundreds of millions of years helped to create the atmosphere, said
Robert Tilling, a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey in Menlo Park.;   
Some prehistoric eruptions were truly monstrous, said Peter Lipman, a
volcanologist at the survey. The biggest uncovered so far was an eruption in
the Rocky Mountains, about 27 million years ago, that was about 1,000 times
bigger than the current one at Pinatubo.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      The first volcanic observatory was set up on the flanks of Mt. Vesuvius in
Italy in 1847. But only after the turn of the century were seismometers and
other modern instruments used to keep track of volcanic activity.  </TEXT>
