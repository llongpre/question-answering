   Masked gunmen bound and gagged unarmed
guards early Saturday at Herculaneum, a Roman city destroyed when
Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 A.D., and stole hundreds of treasures,
news reports said.
   Baldassare Conticello, the superintendent of the archaeological
areas of Herculaneum and nearby Pompeii, said the inventory of the
stolen goods was still incomplete, the Italian news agency AGI
reported.
   The missing items included about 200 gold bracelets and
earrings, a first century bronze vase in the form of a woman's head
and a 32-inch silver-and-copper inlaid bronze statue of Bacchus, he
said.
   At least four bandits wearing ski masks surprised four night
watchmen at their station, AGI quoted investigators as saying. The
custodians were forced at gunpoint to turn over the keys to a
building that houses hundreds of artifacts, the news agency said.
   It said the custodians were tied up and their mouths taped with
bandages. After a few hours, one of the guards was able to free
himself and sounded an alarm.
   Conticello said sale of the stolen goods would be difficult
since they were cataloged. But he said it was possible someone had
commissioned the holdup to enrich a personal collection.
   Walter Mazzitti, the head of Archeoclub of Italy, an
organization of people interested in archaeology, decried what he
called a lack of adequate security at major ruins in the Naples
area and syggested that guards there should be armed.
   Herculaneum, along the Bay of Naples and with the volcano at its
back, included the villas of wealthy ancient Romans. Its ruins,
discovered in 1709, are considered better preserved than those at
the more extensive complex at Pompeii, which was also destroyed by
Mount Vesuvius' eruption.
