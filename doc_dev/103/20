As the tall ships headed down the Tyne this weekend to race to Bergen, they
passed a send-off party thrown by a company claiming to be the only one that
plied its trade by sail from Newcastle which is still operating there.
Mind you, it very nearly wasn't, admitted Cookson Group's American chief
executive Richard Oster, recalling 1990 when the industrially-diversifed
caboodle almost sank. Nor does he ascribe its recovery primarily to the new
managers who have taken the helm.
When they decided to go for a one-for-four rights issue earlier in the year,
he confided, they were a bit anxious about the outcome of an already
arranged shareholders' visit to the plant of their Vesuvius ceramics
subsidiary at Newmilns near Glasgow.
They became more anxious still when not only did institutional investors and
others representing more than half of the stock ownership turn up, but
Vesuvius's UK chief Roger Brook blithely informed the visitors that nobody
from management would be showing them round the plant. Instead they were
divided into small groups and given a tour by shopfloor workers.
The moral was plain, Oster said. The rights issue was 96.3 per cent taken
up, and the rest of the shares readily sold. 'The workers did a better job
than the likes of me could have done,' added Brook.
