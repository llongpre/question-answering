<LEADPARA>  This date doesn't mean much today, but it was a bad one for the ancient
Romans. On Aug. 24, A.D. 79, Mount Vesuvius, which hadn't so much as hiccuped
in centuries, blew its top and buried Pompeii and Herculaneum. And later, in
the year 410, Alaric the Visigoth answered the double dealing of the emperor
by overrunning Rome. The Visigoths spent three days symbolically putting an
end to the Western Roman Empire by killing the people, looting the buildings
and generally tearing up the city. But being good Christians, they didn't lay
so much as a finger on the churches.  </LEADPARA>
