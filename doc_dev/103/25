Millionaire oilman J. Paul Getty in 1954 purchased a large ranch-style home on 
65 acres in Malibu, in which he opened a museum to display art objects he had 
been collecting. As his collection grew, Getty built a new museum, designed as 
a reconstruction of a Roman seaside villa that was buried in an eruption of Mt. 
Vesuvius in AD 79. Completed in 1974, the museum contains 38 galleries of art, 
including antiquities from Greece and Rome, as well as Renaissance and Baroque 
paintings and French decorative arts.
