THE PROMISE OF LIGHT by Paul Watkins Faber Pounds 14.99, 218 pages
IN A time when so many novelists are raiding the history books for subject
matter, you would have hoped that at least Susan Sontag, a writer
unsurpassed at tackling the major cultural questions of our time, would use
a foray into fiction to take an incisive look at the way we live now. No
such luck. Her third novel, The Volcano Lover, is a rich, intelligent,
historical romance that turns out to be little more than a prolonged
meditation on dormant themes.
The novel, set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, tells the story of
Sir William Hamilton, his wife Emma and her lover Lord Nelson. Sir William
is the effete English ambassador to Naples whose main interests lie in
collecting art and studying Mount Vesuvius, active during his tenure in
Italy. After the death of his first wife he marries Emma Hart, a beautiful
yet coarse woman who in turn falls in love with Nelson, fresh from his
victories over Napoleon on the Nile.
I read the book in the hope that at some point it would erupt into
significance, that it would shed the quaint fabric of historical romance to
assume a more timely garb. But Sontag plays it pretty straight throughout,
using her skill to examine the political turmoil, aesthetic obsessions and
emotional dilemmas facing her largely frivolous characters.
It is a lively and erudite read, though nothing distinguishes it from the
glut of other recent novels that seem to grow more out of assiduous research
than any attempt to unravel the tangled knot of our times.
Another writer who has made good use of his library card is William T.
Vollmann. At 32, Vollmann stands as a living reproach to slothful young
writers everywhere, having already published something like 5,000 pages of
fiction. Fathers and Crows is the second in his seven-volume fictional
history of North America. It deals with the French Jesuits' conquest of
Canada and its indigenous population in the 17th century, giving us tales of
a continent's worth of priests, explorers and native people, most
interestingly one Catherine Tekakwitha, an Algonquin convert beatified by
John Paul II in 1980.
There is no doubting that Vollmann has a brain the size of Saskatchewan, and
that he is not afraid to have fun with history. He also possesses a
narrative skill that surfaces on occasion amid the welter of detail. But, in
the end, the book proves too dense a forest for the casual walker to find
his way through. The central narrative is complicated by numerous
geographical and temporal digressions, as well as enough personal and place
names to fill a phone book and an atlas. Strictly for the reader with a
specialist interest in the history of Canada, or those possessing a
Jesuitical temperament.
Another chasteningly productive young writer is 28-year-old Paul Watkins.
His fourth novel, The Promise of Light, is, like his earlier work, a
coming-of-age story cloaked in the guise of an adventure yarn. Set in 1921,
it follows young Ben Sheridan as he travels from his native Rhode Island to
Ireland after learning that the couple who raised him were not his real
parents. As he searches for his true identity he soon finds himself enmeshed
in the horrors of the Civil War, eventually forced to fight with the IRA
against the Black and Tans. As in all Watkins's work, the hero is forced to
undergo a bloody rite of passage before his true nature can be revealed.
Watkins's writing is as terse and lively as ever, employing a precision that
is often cinematic, particularly in the combat scenes. Unfortunately, the
story itself is somewhat predictable and superficial, draining the taut
prose of much of its narrative drive. One gets the feeling both Ben's and
Ireland's searches for selfhood are little more than pegs upon which the
author hangs daring midnight raids and heroic slogs across the bogs. And the
ending is informed more by the ethos of the B-Movie than serious fiction.
Watkins is a talented writer who should perhaps think of changing to a less
frenetic gear.
