   The would-be novels began badly and
turned worse before their first sentences thudded to an end,
laughable tributes to a once popular Victorian master of banality
and gratuitous polysyllabic prose.
   And those were the winners!
   The 8th International Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest, sponsored
by the San Jose State University English department, unleashed its,
uh, best entries Thursday from ``the seamy underside of
literature.''
   The grand prize from the nearly 10,000 execrable entries from
around the world went to Ray C. Gainey of Indianapolis for this bit
of amusing, albeit repulsive, imagery:
   ``Professor Frobisher couldn't believe he had missed seeing it
for so long _ it was, after all, right there under his nose _ but
in all his years of research into the intricate and mysterious ways
of the universe, he had never noticed that the freckles on his
upper lip, just below and to the left of the nostril, partially
hidden until now by the hairy mole he had just removed a week
before, exactly matched the pattern of the stars in the Pleiades,
down to the angry red zit that had just popped up where he and his
colleagues had only today discovered an exploding nova.''
   For his effort, Gainey gained a word processor, confirming the
computer age adage, ``Garbage in, garbage out.''
   ``My wife was jumping up and down when she called me at work,''
said Gainey in a telephone interview. ``They dragged me out of a
meeting. I thought somebody was dead.''
   Gainey, who enters as many as 30 items a year, said he won
dishonorable mentions in 1985, 1986 and 1987.
   The contest, founded by English professor Scott Rice, honors, as
it were, Edward George Bulwer-Lytton.
   Rice describes Lytton as the ``author of some of Victorian
literature's most turgid prose'' and notes that the ponderous,
meandering opening sentence to his novel, ``Paul Clifford,'' which
began, ``It was a dark and stormy night ...'' inspired not only the
contest but the famous literary beagle, Snoopy.
   The contest, which Rice calls ``a sneaky but enjoyable way to
encourage writing,'' invites insipid inkslingers to offer opening
sentences to the worst possible hypothetical novels.
   ``As anyone who has spent time on an entry knows, it takes a
good writer to write bad deliberately,'' Rice says.
   Here, then, are some of the deliberately bad winners, the creme
da dreck, in various genres:
   Detective Fiction _ ``Sgt. Tom Katt wasn't 100 percent sure of
anything but he knew something wasn't quite right when the factory
foreman told him that the nightshift guard had fallen into a vat of
baby oil and softened to death.'' _ Wayne D. Worthey, Washington,
D.C.
   Historical _ ```Rumbling, Schmumbling!' retorted Bulonius to his
wife's alarm at the sounds coming from Mt. Vesuvius, `that stupid
volcano always makes noise _ and besides, our insurance agent at
Pompeii Mutual says that if it does erupt we'll be covered.''' _
John L. Ashman, Houston.
   Vile Puns _ ``As Wilbur, long obsessed though unfamiliar with
pointilism, escorted his wife, Katy, into the Modern wing of the
local art museum, he exclaimed jubilantly, `Kay, Seurat!, Seurat!,'
to which she replied, yawningly, `Whatever, Wilby, Wilby.' '' _
Matthew Kaslow, Brooklyn, N.Y.
   Western _ ``Sheriff Blalock groped for his shooting iron, as the
thought that he was up for re-election crossed his mind, because he
wasn't going to let this varmint get away with insulting Miss
Beulah's girls, even if they did kind of resemble a string of
horses that had been rode hard and put away wet.'' _ Lucile R.
Addington, Dallas.
   Romance _ ``Jake liked his women the way he liked his kiwi
fruit: sweet yet tart, firm-fleshed yet yielding to the touch, and
covered with short brown fuzzy hair.'' _ Gretchen Schmidt, Coral
Gables, Fla.
   Adventure _ ``It was the third day of the Iditarod sled race,
and a frigid wind blew ice crystals into Preston's grizzled,
windburned face as he urged his dogs on: `Mush! Let's go, Jason,
Jennifer, Jeremy! Move it out, Chelsea, Brian! Come on, Buffy,
Muffy! Mush!'' _ Michael J. Saxton, Davis, Calif.
