   A 19th-century painting set in ancient Rome of a
young woman about to bathe has been sold at auction for $153,450 _
nearly 20,000 times its 1956 purchase price of $8.
   ``It certainly does reflect an extraordinary change in taste, but
that isn't unique in art,'' said Sotheby's Simon Taylor after the
sale Tuesday of ``Diadumene'' by Sir Edward Poynter.
   The auction house had expected more because of the vogue for
once-neglected Victorian works. It had estimated the painting would
fetch up to $232,500.
   Poynter, in 1885, had painted the young woman nude but he added
diaphanous drapery after it was exhibited at the Royal Academy of
Arts and provoked letters from shocked viewers.
   One letter to the press, signed ``British Matron,'' said the
writer had barred her daughters from going to the the exhibition.
Another letter said the painting would produce a ``burning sense of
shame'' in any ``modest woman on the arm of father, brother or
lover.''
   Poynter was known for such paintings but his most famous work,
reproduced in the tens of thousands in its day, was ``Faithful unto
Death.'' It depicted a Roman sentry staying at his post during the
destruction of Pompeii by the Vesuvius volcano.
   The seller and buyer of ``Diadumene'' were not identified.
   The painting had been auctioned in 1956 at a sale of the contents
of Ashley Manor, owned by Lady Agnes Chichester Dixon-Hartland.
   Top price at Tuesday's auction of 19th century European art was
$2.3 million _ more than double the estimate _ paid anonymously for
``Grandfather's Birthday,'' a family fireside scene by Austrian
artist Ferdinand Georg Waldmueller. It was a record for his work.
