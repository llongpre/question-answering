   Six stolen artworks discovered a year ago hidden in the Paris home of an Italian have been returned to Italy, the Cultural Ministry announced yesterday. 

   A 15th-century triptych by Gabriele di Francesco was among the works. 
The painting, in three side-by-side panels, was stolen in 1985 from the altar of the Cathedral of Roniglione, 33 miles north of Rome. 

   A 15th-century painting by Francesco Raibolini, three 17th-century compasses with ivory cases, and Francesco Netti's 1800 "Procession of Penance During the 1794 Eruption of Vesuvius" also were recovered. 
They were stolen from Italy between June 1983 and August 1984. 

   The Italian news, ANSA, said the works were found in the home of Giambattista Ongaro. 
It quoted ministry officials as saying several other works that had been exported illegally from Italy also were found in the home. 

   No charges were filed against Mr. Ongaro. 
The ministry said there is no evidence to link him to the thefts.
