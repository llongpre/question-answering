<LEADPARA>  Scientists have unearthed eight bodies in recent days at Pompeii, the first
human remains found at the site in at least three decades.;   Baldassare
Conticello, Pompeii's superintendent of archaeology, said Thursday that the
discoveries marked the first time that remains had been found at the rooftop
level of the ancient city.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "These people managed to survive for several hours" after the disaster, he
said.;   Pompeii was buried under ash and stone after Mount Vesuvius erupted
Aug. 24, A.D. 79, killing thousands of residents of the city.;   Conticello
said one of the newly discovered victims appeared to have a basket on his or
her head. He speculated that the person had put it there for protection from
the hot ash.;   Two of the skeletons showed signs of fractures on their heads,
probably from falling objects or structures, he said.;   Some had pieces of
cloth around their mouths, apparently to keep from inhaling the suffocating
ash around them, he said.;   The victims were fleeing toward the Mediterranean
Sea, which reached almost as far as Pompeii at the time, when they apparently
succumbed to a new outburst by Vesuvius, he said.  </TEXT>
