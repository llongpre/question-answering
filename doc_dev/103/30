      HOLIDAY SPECTACLE
   Christmas Tree and Baroque Creche -- The Metropolitan Museum's always-stunning annual display features a 20-foot tree and an 18th-century manger adorned with a collection of about 180 carved Neapolitan creche figures. 
Medieval Sculpture Hall, 82nd Street and Fifth Avenue. 
Wednesdays through Sundays 9:30 a.m.-5:15 p.m. and Tuesdays 9:30 a.m.-8:45 p.m. 
Through Jan. 3. 
Suggested contribution is $5; $2.50 for children and senior citizens. (212) 535-7710. 

   Elsewhere in town: At Herald Center (34th Street at Broadway, sixth floor), more than 300 painted terra-cotta figurines populate a Nativity scene made by a Naples craftsman expressly for this New York showing. 
Nearby is a smaller 18th-century creche. 
Mondays through Saturdays 10 a.m.-7 p.m. and Sundays noon-6 p.m. 
Through Jan. 10. 
Admission $2; $1.50 for children, senior citizens and groups. (212) 695-3738. 
And in the window of the Alitalia ticket office (666 Fifth Avenue), some 200 people, animals and miniature objects are arrayed against a representation of Mount Vesuvius and classical ruins in an antique creche from a private collection in Naples. 
Through Jan. 10. 

   Citibank Station -- This Victorian-style structure, typical of a turn-of-the-century train depot, soars 32 feet into the atrium at Manhattan's Citicorp Center through Dec. 31 (closed Christmas Day). 
A peek through the 6-foot-high viewing areas on each of its three sides reveals the treat: 10 tracks of model trains whizzing through three miniature scenes of New York life. 
Conceived and designed by Broadway set designer Clarke Dunham, Citibank Station is open daily from 10 a.m.-9 p.m. (free). 
Lexington Avenue at 53rd Street. (212) 559-2330. 

   ART
   Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore: "Stories From China's Past" -- The 2,000-year-old archaeological treasures in this exhibit were created to celebrate the dead, but today provide a vibrant picture of life in Han dynasty China. 
Statues in bronze, terra cotta and stone, ceramic tiles and rubbings -- all excavated from tombs in Sichuan province -- depict couples kissing, farmers toiling, acrobats and musicians entertaining. 
The piece de resistance is an intricately worked bronze "money tree." 

   The show, organized by the Chinese Culture Center of San Francisco, will be at the museum (600 North Charles St.) through Jan. 10. 
It then travels to Cornell University's Herbert F. Johnson Museum, Ithaca, N.Y. (Jan. 26-March 13), UCLA's Frederick S. Wight Gallery (April 3-May 22) and the Phoenix Art Museum (June 18-Aug. 21). 

   Western Reserve Historical Society: Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster were Cleveland high school students when they created Superman; now they're being honored by their former hometown with an exhibit of Superman memorabilia that spans 50 years of "truth, justice and the American way." 
Included is the first drawing of the "man of steel," by Mr. Shuster. 10825 East Boulevard. 
Through Feb. 29. 

   DANCE
   Nikolais Dance Theatre/Murray Louis Dance Company: Modern dance pioneers Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis try something new -- sharing a season. 
The togetherness extends beyond splitting the bill -- dancers from both troupes join forces to perform three of the works scheduled. 
And that's not all that's new: The five-week engagement includes plenty of premieres, three by "Nik" and two by Murray. 
Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Ave. (at 19th St.), Manhattan. 
Tonight through Jan. 17. (212) 242-0800. 

   MUSIC
   Washington Opera presents two new productions: Mascagni's rarely performed comic opera "L'Amico Fritz" and Gilbert &amp; Sullivan's operetta "Ruddigore."
