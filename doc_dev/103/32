<TEXT>UNDATED: gilt-edged investment.    Since the mayor of Thebes got
written up in hieroglyphics for ripping off a royal tomb in the reign of
Ramses IX, around 1130 B.C., the past has been up for grabs.    Alexander
the Great, Hannibal and Julius Caesar loaded the spoils of conquest onto
ox carts. Viking raiders plundered the Irish monasteries. Pompeii slept
for 1,800 years under the volcanic ash of Vesuvius until rediscovery brought
renewed destruction by Bourbon kings, Napoleon, the Nazis, liberating British
and American armies, and now tour buses.    Enrico Dandolo, the 82-year-old
blind doge of Venice, diverted the Fourth Crusade from the Holy Land to
Constantinople, and while the city burned, made off with the four exquisite
bronze horses adorning the hippodrome. The pious Venetian had a stone Bible
inserted beneath the paws of the winged Byzantine lion that now stands
in the piazetta as a shrine to St. Mark, patron of the city.    Along
came Napoleon, bent on making Paris the art center of the world, and
the gilt horses were set to pulling a victory chariot atop the Arc du Caroussel
outside the Louvre until a righteous Austrian emperor returned them to
Venice _not to Constantinople or the Isle of Rhodes from whence they were
originally hijacked.    Spanish conquistadors obliterated Aztec temples
in search of El Dorado. Nazi invaders filled railway cars with European
art for avid collectors Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering, whose tastes
ran to plump renaissance nudes. Soviet technicians building the Aswan Dam
sent home scarabs and other pharaonic souvenirs in diplomatic pouches.
   French intellectual Andre Malraux was convicted of loading up a riverboat
with Cambodian temple idols and roof ornaments. The Americans followed
the French example in ransacking the Annamite and Cham monuments of Vietnam,
just as the Khmer Rouge, then the Vietnamese army, further ruined the ruins
of Angkor Wat.    Tomb robbing has been illegal since the first-century
reign of Emperor Vespasian, but every 30 minutes somewhere in Italy
a work of art vanishes into collections abroad.    But of all the displaced
art in history none has stirred such deep emotions or as many debates in
the House of Commons as Lord Elgin's marbles.    In 1801, while serving
as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, then ruling Greece, the Scottish
peer got permission from the sultan to collect the numerous sculptures
he saw being destroyed daily.    For Thomas Bruce, no good ever came of
his rescue mission. The first boatload went down at sea, and a considerable
part of his fortune went to divers hired to retrieve it. Just married,
he dreamed of marble halls for the family seat at Broomhall, Scotland.
Nearly bankrupt, he wound up selling the exquisite statues and columns
to the British Museum for about $160,000, less than half the cost of removing
them from the Parthenon.    ``Poor plunder from a bleeding land,'' lamented
Lord Byron, who denounced Bruce as a jackal, an idiot and a greedy ``stone
shop'' keeper.    But on first looking into a showcase of Elgin
treasures, John Keats poured forth his ``Ode on a Grecian Urn.''    The
seventh earl's marriage ended in an ugly divorce. A rare skin disease ate
away the tip of his nose. On his way home, he was taken hostage for three
years in the Napoleonic wars, nver resumed his diplomatic career and eventually
lost his seat in the House of Lords. Posterity provided the final calamity.
``Elginism'' became a synonym for rip-off adventures.    The art world,
however, is still divided over whether he ravished the glory that was Greece
or preserved it from Athenian neglect, Turkish cannons, traffic pollution,
airport vibrations and relentless invasion by tourists.    ``The damage
by tourists has been terrible,'' says fellow Scot Graham. ``There is absolutely
no justification for returning the Elgin marbles. Lord Elgin was not motivated
by profit like today's greedy collectors. Surely by now some statute of
limitations must apply.''    But Karl Meyer, author of ``The Plundered
Past,'' a fascinating study of the international traffic in stolen art,
said in an interview, ``The Elgin marbles are inseparably integral to Greek
culture.''    In his mind, the Parthenon, where Socrates taught young
Plato, and Pericles encouraged Phidias to sculpt those colossal statues
of the gods, and Alexander the Great piled his captured shields, ``stands
at the very summit of Greek achievement. There is no other case like it
in the world.''    Curator Peter Lacovera at Boston's Fine Arts Museum
differs: ``The British Museum has every right in the world to hang onto
the Elgin marbles, which otherwise wouldn't exist today.'' If returned,
he suggests the British government bill Greece for 173 years of storage
and maintenance.    In the intrigue-haunted world of antiquities, you
can never predict what will happen to the past.
