   Six stolen artworks discovered a year ago hidden in
the Paris home of an Italian have been returned to Italy, the
Cultural Ministry announced Tuesday.
   A 15th century triptych by Gabriele di Francesco was among the
works. The painting, in three side-by-side panels, was stolen in
1985 from the altar of the Cathedral of Roniglione, 33 miles north
of Rome.
   A 15th century painting by Francesco Raibolini, three 17th
century compasses with ivory cases, and Francesco Netti's 1800
``Procession of Penance During the 1794 Eruption of Vesuvius'' also
were recovered. The three were stolen from Italy between June 1983
and August 1984.
   The Italian news ANSA said the works were found in the home of
Giambattista Ongaro. It quoted Culture Ministry officials as saying
several other works that had been exported illegally from Italy
also were found in the home.
   No charges were filed against Ongaro. The ministry said there no
evidence to link him to the thefts.
