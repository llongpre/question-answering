   One artist grasped the importance of what was
happening in England in the 18th century when he chose scientific
demonstrations, iron forges and blacksmiths' shops for his
``peculiar'' subjects.
   Joseph Wright's first major show in London, opening today, comes
almost 200 years after his death.
   ``He deserved one before but this often happens in England,''
said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, at Tuesday's
preview.
   To avoid confusion with artists of the same name, Wright was
known in his lifetime as Wright of Derby, the Midlands town where
he was born and worked. He died in 1797 and the title has stuck
ever since.
   His most famous picture is of a group of people watching a
demonstrator pump air from a glass globe, causing a bird inside to
flutter in distress as it loses oxygen. The viewers react in
fascination or shock and one covers her eyes.
   A critic who saw it in 1768 wrote: ``Mr. Wright, of Derby, is a
very great and uncommon genius, in a peculiar way.''
   In those days, ``peculiar'' meant ``individual'' or ``unlike
others,'' says the exhibition organizer, Judy Egerton, who has
gathered about 200 works from around the world for the show.
   Two years earlier, Wright had shown another unique painting, of
a lecturer explaining the workings of an orrery, a clockwork model
of the solar system. His listeners, including two little boys, are
entranced and one man makes notes.
   There are no pictures like these anywhere else, art historians
say.
   The scene in each painting is illuminated by a candle lamp,
demonstrating Wright's mastery of light effects. His industrial
pictures show workers lit by the fires at which they work metals.
   Wright's scientific and industrial paintings won for him the
honor of being the first artist to directly express the spirit of
the industrial revolution.
   He was gripped by fire and light and returning in 1775 from a
visit to Italy he brought his paintings of the annual firework
display in Rome, the Girandola, and of a nighttime eruption of the
Vesuvius volcano.
   All these are in the Tate show along with many of the portraits,
by which Wright earned the bulk of his income.
   ``Wright fell into obscurity in the 19th century but in the
1920s he was appreciated by American collectors,'' Serota said.
   His paintings then rose in value. In 1984, London's National
Gallery paid $1.7 million at auction for his portrait, ``Mr. and
Mrs. Coltman.''
   Wright had charged Coltman 63 pounds for it in 1771, then the
equivalent of about $300.
   The ``Wright of Derby'' exhibition goes to Paris this summer and
to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in the fall, the
first time the Tate has loaned a show to the Met, Serota added.
   ``Wright captures the excitement of scientific discovery,'' said
David Fraser, curator of Derby's museums.
   Derby Art Gallery has the largest collection of Wright's work
because its residents admired him and contributed in Victorian
times to the museum's purchase of his paintings.
   In the 1960s, the Derby church he was buried in was demolished
and its site now lies under a beltway. His remains were so
carelessly reburied in a local cemetery that no one now quite knows
where they are, the curator said.
   The exhibition is at the Tate Gallery through April 22, at the
Paris Grand Palais May 17 through July 23 and at the New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art Sept. 6 through Dec. 2.
