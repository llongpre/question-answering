   ``Look at this! Think how frightened she must
have been,'' Rita Lowe exclaimed, trying to imagine her Italian
immigrant mother's awe on entering the cavernous registry room on
Ellis Island in 1907.
   ``Can you imagine, coming from a small village?'' she commented.
   Mrs. Lowe, 67, of Long Beach, Calif., was among the 371 people
who took the first ferry from Battery Park on lower Manhattan
across the harbor Monday for the first day that the ``portal to the
New World'' was reopened to the public as a museum celebrating
American immigrants.
   ``We came to be sure we were here this first day,'' said Mrs.
Lowe, who walked the halls of the restored building with relatives,
remembering her mother's tales.
   ``Coming from a small town, women were modest and the physical
embarrassed her. I can understand but she couldn't. She often spoke
of those first days here and would say to me: `I was healthy, not
sick. Why did they have to examine me that way?' ''
   ``We have to keep this place alive,'' Mrs. Lowe said. ``In
memory of her and for all those reasons why she came here, her and
all the others.''
   Laima Silaikis Hood, 50, of New York, came to the United States
from Lithuania in 1949. She didn't enter through Ellis Island, but
an uncle of hers had in 1910.
   ``The significance for me, being an immigrant _ a refugee _ is
that I can identify with those who came before,'' she said,
standing before photo murals and a display of century-old
immigrants' trunks, valises and baskets in the Baggage Room, a
great hall at the front entrance of the museum.
   The building contains a variety of exhibits on three levels,
many depicting what the incoming millions and their adopted country
were like when they got here.
   Patricia Sandler was enthralled with the display of immigrant
artifacts and said she wished she had thought to contribute an
heirloom from her grandparents, John and Maria DeSimone. They
passed through Ellis Island from Naples, Italy, in 1907.
   ``They had lived near Mount Vesuvius, and when it erupted they
had copper pots they put over their heads to protect them from
falling stones.
   ``We've had those pots all these years, things they kept in
steamer trunks as mementos,'' Mrs. Sandler said.
   Theodore Heretakis, 55, went straight from the ferry to the
island's seawall to scan the Wall of Honor. Among the 200,000 names
inscribed in copper he found the name of his father, Stavros, and
his father-in-law, Pantelis Gigourtakis, who came from Crete in the
1920s.
   ``I marvel at the achievement of all the immigrants,'' said
Heretakis, an engineer who lives in Commack. ``They all demonstrate
what our parents had, the hard work and aspiration.''
   Jerry Khlumsky, 48, of New York, said his grandfather, Joseph,
settled in Chicago in the 1890s after arriving in New York from
Prague, in what is now Czechoslovakia.
   ``I feel very close and yet there's a gap,'' Khlumsky said. ``I
feel a kinship with eastern Europe and this is sort of a meeting
place between here and there.''
   ``I can't believe people had the guts to leave and come where
they had no idea what they were coming to,'' said Jennifer
Wechsler, 18, of Los Angeles, who took in the museum with her
mother Judy on the last day of a visit in the city.
   Barbara Viborka, 54, of New York, reminiscing at the seawall,
said her parents came from Czechoslovakia, arriving in separate
ships.
   ``Growing up I heard about the trip all the time,'' she said.
``They never told me about the bad. They made a joke of it.
   ``Mother was just coming for a visit to see a cousin and go back
home. She was 16. But she was seasick 14 days and she said she
decided when she got here, `God put me on land and that's where I'm
staying.' ''
