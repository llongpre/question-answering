   Today sensitive instruments detect every tiny
movement of the earth's crust, recording in detail disastrous
earthquakes like the one in Northern California on Tuesday.
   These geological tools represent the ultimate refinement in a
line that began almost 2,000 years ago with the ancient dragon bowl
that dropped a ball when shaken.
   The first earthquake recording device was credited to the
Chinese philosopher Chang Heng in the year 132.
   He developed a bowl with dragon-shaped heads located at eight
points around the outside. Each had a small ball balanced in its
mouth; during an earthquake the ball dropped out, landing in the
mouth of a toad statue located below.
   The location of a quake was supposed to determine which dragon
dropped its ball, and the instrument was said to have recorded a
quake 400 miles away that could not be felt by people near the bowl.
   J. de la Haute Feuille developed a similar device to record
quakes in the year 1703, filling his bowl to the brim with mercury.
In a quake, some mercury would spill on the side toward the quake.
   Dave Russ, assistant chief geologist at the U.S. Geological
Survey, said that in modern measuring devices, instruments near the
center of an earthquake are knocked off their recording scale in a
violent temblor, but readings can be calculated from the waves
reaching more distant machines.
   Agency scientists at Menlo Park, Calif., near the site of
Tuesday's deadly quake, are now collecting all available
information on what happened.
   The basic tool today is a seismograph, an instrument developed
in the late 19th century.
   Basically, it is a box with a frame attached to the ground that
includes a suspended weight, which is able to swing. When an
earthquake causes the frame to move, inertia forces the mass to lag
behind and its swing is recorded by a pen and ink sweeping back and
forth over paper. That pen trace is the commonly shown seismogram.
   These machines can be set for vertical or horizontal shaking and
in modern machines the shaking produces an electrical signal which
is amplified to drive a pen, allowing them to be much more
sensitive than in the past.
   Over the years scientists have learned that earthquakes produce
more than one type of wave, and that the different kinds move
through the earth's crust at different speeds.
   By comparing the time of arrival of the different wave forms at
a seismograph, scientists can determine how far away a quake
occurred. Comparing the results at several locations allows them to
calculate the exact position of the quake.
   While these are still the primary instruments used to measure
quakes, geologists also have developed an array of other machines.
   For example, Russ pointed out that in parts of California along
the San Andreas fault, laser beams are used to measure land
movement.
   The laser is placed on a hill and shines on a target located on
the other side of a fault. Regular flashes of light allow the
scientist to compare the time it takes for the light to travel
between the two spots and thus calculate whether the light and
target are moving relative to one another.
   Other instruments buried in the earth can sense the stresses
placed on rocks. Measurements are also made of radon and other
gases released by the earth and sensitive meters can even trace
changes in the strength of gravity beneath the spots where they are
located.
   A pendulum was first used to record a quake in Naples in 1731,
with Nichomas Cirillo reporting that the amplitude of the swing
decreased with distance from the quakes.
   Using a magnifier trained at the image of a cross hair, focused
on a bowl of mercury, Robert Mallet was able to measure the speed
of waves in the earth following dynamite explosions in England in
1851.
   Luigi Palmieri installed a seismograph at Mount Vesuvius in
1856, but the instruments were brought into general use toward the
end of that century by a group of British geologists headed by John
Milne, working in Japan.
   Milne eventually managed to get seismograph stations set up
around the world, collecting data at a central observatory for
analysis.
