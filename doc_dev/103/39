treatment by the UK government, the Getty is determined to win possession of
the Three Graces

Today the never-ending saga of the Three Graces moves into the courtroom. A
judge will decide whether the complaint by the Getty Museum of Malibu,
California, that the British Government has broken its own rules on the
export of works of art, has substance.
It is amazing it has come to this. The Getty, the most generously endowed
museum in the world, with a Dollars 4bn bequest from oil billionaire J. Paul
Getty to administer, has always prided itself on playing fair, on not using
its financial muscle to rampage through the treasure troves of nations.
It expects governments to play fair too. But having waited since 1989 to
take possession of Canova's statue, which it bought for Pounds 7.6m, and
confident that the August deadline postponing its export from the UK would
be the last, the Getty is up in arms at the unexpected delay. This enabled
Timothy Clifford of the National Galleries of Scotland to ride belatedly to
the rescue and unearth two rich friends of the UK, John Paul Getty II and
Baron Thyssen, who have promised Pounds 1m and Pounds 800,000 respectively
to save the Three Graces for the UK.
No wonder the Getty's mild mannered director John Walsh is roused. 'We have
been treated shabbily,' he said. 'The government has changed its own rules
and ignored its own deadlines whenever it was convenient. What's at issue is
not just the Three Graces: it is the fair administration of the export
review system in Britain.'
Few objects of art more suit the Getty than the Three Graces. Getty loved
antiquity. His museum is fashioned after a Roman villa which disappeared on
the eruption of Vesuvius. Canova's fantasy of the daughters of Jove
embracing in marble harks directly back to classical times.
A visit to the Getty on its hillside perch confirms that the Three Graces
would fit beautifully into an airy alcove there, alongside statues, framed
by the fountains, shrubs and frescoes of the museum and with the Pacific
Ocean in the distance. The likely loss of the statue has put iron into
Walsh's soul. It is not the first time the Getty has been pipped at the
post. A Duccio painting and a Bernini bust were also retained in the UK
thanks to the Clifford-Getty II partnership.
Despite an annual expenditure budget in excess of Dollars 200m, the Getty
Trust, which administers the museum, has traditionally behaved prudently.
'We have not used our cheque book to pay over the odds, nor have we hidden
behind false identities,' says Walsh. The trust has played the game,
respecting the national heritages of the European countries which mainly
hold the objects of art it seeks. 'We only succeed in acquiring about one
object in every four or five that we would like,' says Walsh. In the future
this restraint in spending the Dollars 60m or so a year the museum sets
aside for acquisitions may be loosened.
Apart from the increasingly restrictive export policies for antiques
operated by European Union nations, the Getty imposes its own checks on
acquisitions. It respects the passions of its founder, who mainly bought
antiquities, Renaissance and Baroque paintings and European decorative arts.
Its collection does not contain anything made after 1900, its painting
display culminating in a selection of dramatic works by Ensor, Munch and,
most notably, Van Gogh - a version of 'Irises' which at more than Dollars
40m was the Getty's most expensive single acquisition.
The 1900 time limit is unlikely to change, though Walsh has cast off some of
the self-imposed limitations: there is little point having so much potential
buying power if you do not try to form the finest collections in the world
in certain fields.
So the Getty has focused on photography. Its collection of more than 60,000
images, from Fox Talbot to American 20th-century greats such as Weston -
Walsh says a photography archive stopping at 1900 is a nonsense - is
considered the ultimate. Selective collections of drawings and manuscripts
have also been assembled.
But to the visitor the eye catchers are in the traditional areas: the
antiquities, purged of the rogue fake; the paintings, from Rembrandt to
David and including the most expensive Old Master ever acquired at auction -
Pontormo's portrait of Cosimo de Medici, which cost Dollars 35m in 1989; and
the panelled rooms displaying an ornate procession of French design, from
Regence through Rococo to Neo-Classical.
By 1997 a new museum, built atop a nearby hill with views across Los
Angeles, will open.
Called the Getty Center, it will cost Dollars 700m and be four times larger
than the villa, which will remain the home of the antiquities.
The rest of the collection, including many objects currently warehoused,
will move into a museum campus designed by Richard Meier. It is the
construction of the new museum which is absorbing most of the Getty's
invested revenues, though there are still millions to spare each year for
conservation projects and scholarship.
Although running two museums plus satellite activities will increase the
operating costs of the Getty Trust, the completion of the Center will leave
more money to spend. The Getty will want some fine objects to fill its new
galleries but it is finding it ever harder to acquire them. Walsh admits
this is a growing problem. Most of the pre-1900 masterpieces are safely
ensconced in museums worldwide.
The Getty can, however, make private deals: it recently acquired a very fine
Tiepolo through Switzerland. In spite of Walsh's protestations it certainly
pays top prices. Perhaps Turner's dramatic seascape 'Von Tromp doing the
will of his Master' is just about worth the Dollars 17m the Getty paid, but
other recent payouts, such as Pounds 4.95m for a Goya bull fighting scene
and Dollars 11m for a Sebastiano portrait of Pope Clement VII, look on the
high side.
These paintings were bought openly. The worry is that, affronted by the
delays and the dubious justifications of the UK government over the Three
Graces, the Getty will be inclined to go behind backs and negotiate
privately with British aristocrats, German princes, and French counts.
At the moment the art market is still suffering from post-recession blues
and little of unquestionable brilliance is coming forward. In a year or two
the Getty, with its bulging pockets, will be ready to power the market's
revival, while at the same time showing less sensitivity to national pride.
