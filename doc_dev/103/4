   An explosion that ripped through a
fireworks factory on the side of the Vesuvius volcano killed two
people, wounded three and produced panic in nearby towns, police
said.
   Monday's explosion was heard up to a half-mile away and the
inhabitants of nearby hamlets thought the volcano was erupting,
authorities said. Several firetrucks and a helicopter arrived from
nearby Naples and doused the flames.
   Police said they did not know the cause of the blast.
   The victims were workers at the factory, which produced
skyrockets.
   Vesuvius last erupted in 1944.
