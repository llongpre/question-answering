   Much of Europe dug out Monday from a heavy
snowfall that snarled traffic and left thousands without
electricity. At least 12 people were killed and nine were missing
in the Continent's first storm of the winter season.
   Snow fell in France, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and
Austria. In southern Europe, heavy rains flooded Venice and forced
the suspension of ferry services.
   Torrential rains fell on the French Riviera. Police in Nice said
two French people were killed Sunday night along the French-Italian
border when bad weather sent rocks falling onto their car.
   Police in Britain, where snow turned to rain and sleet Monday,
said 10 people were killed.
   Five mountain climbers were missing in northern Spain, where
small towns were cut off by the heavy snow. Seven major highway
mountain passes were closed in the provinces of Burgos, Cantabria,
Leon and Soria.
   A Spanish Air Force helicopter and a merchant marine tug
searched off the northern Spanish coast for four people on a French
yacht missing in the Bay of Biscay.
   Roads were closed in the central Portugal Serra de Estrela
range.
   Southeastern and central France were hit by heavy snowfall. The
main highway between Lyon and Grenoble was inaccessible, with
traffic rerouted to a small, one-lane highway. The Mount Blanc
tunnel through the Alps was closed.
   In Switzerland, snow closed roads and delayed train and bus
traffic. The Zermatt ski resort reported 3 feet of snow in 24
hours.
   In Austria, avalanche danger closed many roads in parts of East
Tyrol and western Carinthia. In northern Tyrol, ice on the Inntal
highway caused a 21-car pileup. Police said several people were
injured.
   German police reported numerous accidents on the southern German
autobahns because of heavy snow. Drivers were advised to use chains
on alpine roads.
   Schools in Turin were closed as northern Italy dug out from its
first pre-Christmas snow since 1964. Snow fell Sunday on Mount
Vesuvius and the island of Ischia in the Bay of Naples, where heavy
winds halted ferry traffic.
   Wind-driven seas flooded Venice. By daybreak Monday, 40 percent
of the city was flooded, including low-lying St. Mark's Square.
   Train travel was disrupted as British Rail tried to clear
snow-covered lines. British Rail said it had only two snowplow
locomotives for 10,000 miles of track. It was considered a waste of
money to buy more when the country did not have heavy snow every
winter, the state-run network said.
   Six people were expected to appear before magistrates Monday in
Coventry, England, where looters stole jewelry, clothes and stereos
while police car patrols were halted by snow. Later, officers were
sent out on foot.
