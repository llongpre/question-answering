   Grimsvotn and Stromboli, Mount St. Helens and
Karkar, Etna and Nevada del Ruiz. The names conjure up drama and
disaster, a decade of human suffering and scientific inquiry into
the earth's volcanoes.
   Around the world, the erupting mountains that help emphasize the
unsettled nature of the planet become the subject of intense
curiosity when they initiate tragedy. Then they fade from center
stage, of interest only to scientists, relief workers and local
residents.
   Some of the researchers who chronicle and study these events
have now collected a decade's worth of records, major ones of great
impact and smaller eruptions notable for little beyond their
continuing threat.
   ``Global Volcanism 1975-1985'' is largely a scientific treatise,
yet within its 672 pages of text, charts and maps are detailed some
of the most dramatic events of a decade.
   ``An explosive eruption on 13 Nov melted ice and snow in the
summit area, generating lahars that flowed tens of kilometers down
flank river valleys, killing more than 22,000 people,'' begins the
report on Nevada del Ruiz, the Colombia volcano that became the
fourth deadliest volcano in history.
   Lahars, the geological term for massive mudflows generated by
volcanoes, came crashing down 11 narrow valleys into villages,
sweeping away or burying the thousands who made their homes and
lives there in November of 1985.
   ``A frightening noise and then a blast of wind hit us and we saw
fire falling from the sky,'' survivor E. Nieto told the scientists
that day.
   Compiled by the Smithsonian Institution, the new volume is
published by Prentice-Hall and the American Geophysical Union. It
collects reports from the first 10 years of the Smithsonian's
Scientific Event Alert Network. The network is a collection of
thousands of scientists around the world who study volcanoes,
earthquakes, meteors and other such events and share their findings
with one another.
   With scientific thoroughness, for example, they reported not
only that Nevada del Ruiz ranked fourth in volcano death tolls,
they listed the three events that were even worse: Tambora, 1815,
92,000 killed; Krakatau, 1883, 36,000 dead; Mt. Pelee, 1902, 28,000
fatalities.
   One of the editors of the new volume, Tom Simkin, the
Smithsonian's curator of petrology and volcanology, co-wrote an
earlier volume, ``Krakatau 1883.'' Others who joined in editing and
updating the network reports are Smithsonian researchers Lindsay
McClelland, Marjorie Summers, Elizabeth Nielsen and Thomas Stein.
   In addition to Nevada del Ruiz, the volume reports in detail on
Mount St. Helens in Washington, which is better known to Americans.
   Its May 1980 explosion claimed more than 50 lives, cost billions
of dollars in damage and cleanup and coated large parts of several
states with thick, gritty dust for days afterward. The mountain
remains active.
   The volume notes earthquake activity at thee other Cascade or
Sierra Nevada volcanoes during the period: Mount Hood, Ore.; Mount
Shasta, Calif., and Long Valley Caldera, Calif.
   Alaska gets a full chapter on its own, and Hawaii provides the
bulk of activity in the Central Pacific Ocean section.
   Among the more than 200 volcanoes reported in the volume are:
   _Stromboli, near Sicily, which began a new effusive phase in
November 1975, continuing a history of more than 2,000 years of
almost constant activity.
   _Etna, the volcano with the longest documented record in the
world, extending back to 1500 B.C. This Sicilian volcano continued
its tradition with several eruptions during the decade.
   _Grimsvotn, in Iceland, which erupted in both 1982 and 1983.
Located beneath an ice sheet, Grimsvotn melts the ice when it
erupts, flooding local streams and in 1983 produced large steam
clouds.
   _Karkar, off the coast of New Guinea, erupted with an explosive
blast of hot gas and debris March 8, 1979, killing two scientists
who had set up camp to study the volcano.
   Robin J.S. Cooke and Elias Ravian died in the blast, just over a
year before Mount St. Helens would kill another volcanologist,
David Johnston of the U.S. Geological Survey.
