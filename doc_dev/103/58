<TEXT>     Historical excavations can reveal when a known settlement was covered by
lava. For prehistoric eruptions, she said, some large ones near polar regions
left a layer of ash trapped in the polar ice, and oxygen isotopes can be used
to tell when the ice solidified around it.;   However, dating charred wood or
any kind of vegetation from close to the eruption site is the most common
method, Russell-Robinson said.;   Carbon dating relies on the rate of
radioactive decay of one carbon isotope, carbon 14. It is used for eruptions
that took place in the last 40,000 years, but more than 200 years ago.;  
Living things take on carbon from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, she
said, and when they die, they cannot take on any more.;   It's assumed that
the percentage of carbon in the atmosphere has remained constant and that the
radioactivity of carbon 14 has decayed at a constant rate, approximately by
half in 5,700 years.;   Charcoal from trees burned in an eruption is nearly
pure carbon and so is ideal for tracing the minuscule amounts of carbon 14
present, she said.;   Tree rings are not useful because it's hard to find a
tree close to the site that did not burn, while ash and trees from farther out
tend to wash away.;   The dates are given in a range of plus or minus 100
years, Russell-Robinson said, but sometimes a more exact date can be
determined. For example, the eruption at Sunset Crater, Ariz., has been placed
at A.D. 1066.;   Carbon dating put the year around 1065, she said, and
Indians' oral historical records helped pinpoint it at 1066. Pottery that
showed an eclipse of the sun in conjunction with an eruption helped confirm
that date.;   Six weeks before the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the
Philippines, Russell-Robinson said, the Geological Survey obtained charcoal
samples from the site and used carbon 14 dating to confirm the size and scale
of past eruptions and to determine that major eruptions took place about 600
to 800 years apart.  </TEXT>
