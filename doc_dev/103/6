Cookson, the specialist industrial materials group, is forming a joint
venture with Thyssen of Germany to manufacture and supply the central and
east European markets with special refractories and systems used in the
steel continuous casting process.
The joint venture agreement involves Vesuvius International, Cookson's
Belgium-based subsidiary and Dolomitwerke Wulfrath, a Thyssen subsidiary.
Vesuvius will hold a 75 per cent stake in the new joint venture while
Wulfrath will hold the balance.
Both partners will inject their shares in their own existing east European
joint venture companies - Vesuvius Czechoslovakia Trinec and Ceramika
Wulfrath Skawina - into the new company. The local Czech and Polish partners
in the existing joint ventures will remain shareholders.
Mr Stephen Howard, chief executive in charge of Cookson's group corporate
development and chief executive of the Vesuvius division, said the joint
venture would enable both Cookson and Thyssen to lessen the risk involved in
eastern Europe and to establish a closer working relationship.
The central and eastern European markets represent annual steel production
of about 170m tons with German production representing about 30 per cent of
this.
The joint venture will initially have sales of between Pounds 25m and Pounds
30m a year, but turnover and profits are expected to grow quickly as the
switch to continuously cast steel production takes place.
