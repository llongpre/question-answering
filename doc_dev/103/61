   Across the Mediterranean basin, a major summer
drought has killed dozens of people, destroyed crops, dried up
rivers, forced rationing and sparked water wars.
   French farmers are sabotaging water pumps that supply city
dwellers. A two-month heat wave left 38 people dead in Algeria.
Half of Italy's olive crop has been destroyed. Residents of
Istanbul, Turkey, are limited to four hours of water a day.
   In Greece, the drought is the worst in 100 years, forcing the
government to raise water prices 300 percent in an effort to drive
down consumption.
   Supertankers are shipping water to hard-hit Greek coastal areas
and geologists drilling for fresh supplies. Agricultural
cooperatives say farmers have sustained losses of $2 billion.
   The Greek government plans to divert the central Evinos river to
replenish reservoirs around Athens, where the current supply would
last only 98 days.
   Much of France is suffering a second year of drought. A heat
wave last weekend claimed five lives, including a farmer who
dropped dead while installing irrigation equipment.
   A persistent Atlantic high-pressure system has held rainfall in
Normandy and the entire southern third of the country to 50 percent
below average. Dozens of towns have banned lawn-watering and
car-washing.
   ``In the regions of France where it's dry, it's the driest for
10 years,'' meteorologist Guy La Riviere of the National Weather
Service said Friday.
   Officials in the southwestern Aude region, where rationing has
been in effect since 1989, reported anxious farmers were illegally
diverting water to save corn and sunflower crops.
   Farmers occasionally sabotage public water pumps they consider
to be stealing water from their sun-baked fields, officials say.
   ``The acts become more dramatic as the situation gets more
urgent,'' said Jean-Pierre Monod, president of a farming
cooperative.
   Lack of rain has left major rivers like the Loire, Rhone and
Garonne at half their normal levels. When temperatures in the
Garonne climbed to 82 degrees Fahrenheit on Monday, the Goflech
nuclear power plant shut down because the river water was too hot
to cool the reactor.
   Across the Mediterranean in Algeria, a two-month heat wave has
been blamed for 38 deaths in the southern city of Ain Salah.
Temperatures consistently hovered at 104 degrees.
   In Algiers, residents stockpiled water and braced for a
government-ordered suspension of supplies Sunday and Monday. Water
reserves have dropped by two-thirds in the capital the past two
years.
   In Italy, rainfall so far this year has been nearly 40 percent
below average, said Lt. Col. Paolo Ernani of the Weather Bureau.
   More than half the olive harvest has been destroyed and the
drought will seriously affect production for next year's crop,
according the main consortium of Italian olive oil producers.
   The island of Sardinia has asked the government to declare a
state of emergency. The boot-heel region of Puglia has already
received such designation, along with $400,000 in aid.
   In Turkey, two years of drought have parched most coastal and
inland regions except along the Black Sea in the north, waterworks
and meteorology officials said.
   In some quarters of Istanbul, the only water available for
washing is in public baths, and drinking supplies are limited to
four hours per day.
   In Portugal, hot, dry conditions caused the number of forest
fires between June 15 and July 23 to increase by one-fourth over
the same period last year, said National Fire Service Chief
Cristiano Santos.
   Fires also destroyed tens of thousands of acres of forest and
brush in eastern, southern and northwestern Spain, southern France,
and parts of Italy.
   One blaze on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius has raged since
Monday, and a wildfire burned out of control Friday on the Greek
island of Samos.
