   Mount St. Helens belched volcanic ash that settled over a
south-central Washington community Saturday, while seismic
equipment detected a small explosion in Alaska's Redoubt Volcano
that prompted flight restrictions.
   The National Weather Service reported a light dusting of ash
south of Yakima, Wash., in the Toppenish area about 80 miles east
of Mount St. Helens.
   ``It was gritty and it was still falling out of the sky,'' said
David Foster of Toppenish, who found his two cars coated with dust
when he awoke Saturday morning. ``It was very fine. You could see
tracks in the street.''
   Steve Malone, a seismologist with the University of Washington
in Seattle, said seismographs and other equipment within the crater
of Mount St. Helens recorded a small eruption at 5:37 a.m. PST.
   The eruption lasted about two minutes and was followed by small
earthquakes that lasted about two hours.
   In Alaska, authorities had no visual confirmation that Redoubt
Volcano emitted ash during a ``small explosive event'' at 2:26 a.m.
AST, the Alaska Volcano Observatory said.
   Seismologist John Davies of the observatory in Fairbanks called
the eruption a ``clearly a minor event'' compared to eruptions last
month and Tuesday.
   But scientists said that during the day the volcano continued to
generate ``a vigorous plume'' of steam and volcanic gas to
altitudes of 12,000 to 15,000 feet.
   The Federal Aviation Administration prohibited air traffic at
altitudes of less than 60,000 feet within 20 miles of the volcano.
   The volcano, 115 miles southwest of Anchorage, rumbled awake in
mid-December after a 25-year silence, spewing ash that disrupted
air traffic.
   An eruption Tuesday, stronger than the ones in December,
prompted precautionary flight cancellations and delays at Anchorage
International Airport.
   Malone said further details on the Mount St. Helens eruption
would not be available until crews could take a closer look at the
readings. The activity doesn't necessarily mean the volcano is
going to become more active, he said.
   Mount St. Helens erupted May 18, 1980, leveling 230 square
miles, leaving 57 people dead or missing and creating an ash cloud
that circled the globe.
   The volcano has had a number of less intense eruptions since
then but has been relatively quiet in recent years.
