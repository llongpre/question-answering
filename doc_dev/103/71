   A giant ash plume belched from Mount St. Helens,
but scientists said it didn't appear to portend a new eruption of
molten rock.
   Wind carred the ash toward Portland, Ore., 53 miles to the
southwest, prompting United Airlines to cancel 21 flights in and
out of that city Thursday night. Normal service was to resume this
morning, United customer service supervisor Fred Von Pegert said.
   Port of Portland spokesman Darrel Buttice said the airport
remained open Thursday night and the 11 other airlines were flying.
   The 8,366-foot mountain blew a column of light gray ash and
steam 23,000 feet into the air Thursday afternoon, about 30 minutes
after a small explosion occurred on the lava dome in the volcano's
crater, said Michael Doukas, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist at
its Cascade Volcano Observatory in Vancouver.
   Doukas said it was similar to the latest volcanic ``burp,'' on
Nov. 5, when a plume of steam and ash rose 30,000 feet into the
sky. Similar bursts occurred last December and January.
   Doukas said those bursts are significant only in underscoring
that Mount St. Helens remains an active volcano.
   Scientists have theorized such bursts come from either gases
bubbling out of solution in molten rock beneath the mountain, or
from rain and snowmelt percolating down to hot areas and bursting
into steam.
   The volcano's last significant eruption was on March 19, 1982,
when mud flowed from the crater six miles to the north fork of the
Toutle River. Since then, the mountain has had a series of
``dome-building'' eruptions in which the mountain quietly adds lava
to the heap in its crater. The last of those was in October 1986.
   The mountain's cataclysmic May 18, 1980, eruption killed 57
people and blew off the top 1,300 feet of the once-symmetrical
peak, a lava dome dating to about the 16th century.
