PICNICS ON VESUVIUS
by William Rees-Mogg
Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, Pounds 17.50,
396 pages
IT IS TRUE, Lord Rees-Mogg agrees, that he actually read the Financial Times
every day over breakfast at Oxford, a fact which when publicised in Isis
brought the young fogey the reward of a job on the pink paper (he rose to be
chief leader writer in the late 1950s). There is a glimpse here of a
long-lost world: students today surely do not even eat breakfast, let alone
read the FT.
The quality of the young FT set at the time, he muses, was so high,
including as it did the likes of Jock Bruce-Gardyne, Shirley Williams and
Sam Brittan, that 'we were able to take Nigel Lawson in our stride, which is
more than any Cabinet was able to do'.
Now he is an old fogey, contributing entertaining, opinionated, occasionally
profound weekly columns to The Independent. He has also formed a curious
partnership with an American called James Dale Davidson; together this odd
couple has published two lurid and lucrative non-fiction financial
spinechillers, Blood in the Streets and The Great Reckoning. This collection
of articles from The Independent is mostly quite different in character, but
even here Rees-Mogg clearly enjoys the occasional role of prophet of doom -
hence, presumably, the title.
Although once right at the heart of the British Establishment as editor of
The Times, and still retaining a foothold among the great and the good, as
chairman of the Broadcasting Standards Council, William Rees-Mogg has always
indulged in the eccentricities allowed to the upper classes. He pleaded for
the return to the gold standard in the 1970s when conventional wisdom was
still Keynesian; he is Roman Catholic rather than Anglican. He is both
snobbish, for example describing the despised 1960s as 'a decade in which
society took its values from photographers and hairdressers', and
occasionally vulgar as in his books on what is described coarsely as
'megapolitics'.
He writes in what he claims to be 'a subdued copy of an 18th century style'
which is probably one of his rather rare little jokes. The only other
discernable one is his regret at never having met Ms Pamella Bordes 'which
perhaps makes me a unique figure among those who have edited London journals
in the past twenty years'.
In fact his style is commendably modern and direct, well-suited to the
discipline of 1,000-word chunks of which the book is largely composed,
interspersed with a few rather longer and newely-written introductions to
the various sections. He is also ready to pepper the texts with personal or
family details, which is a slightly risky approach. We do not really want to
know that there are 250 Moggs in the US, and that one branch of the family
adopted the spelling Mugge; but on the other hand there is the diverting
story of ghostly Dorothy Mogg who for years after her death in the 18th
century prowled the bedroom of a house in Wincanton until she was exorcised.
The first piece in The Independent which really pleased him, he says, was a
late 1986 attack on Somerset County Cricket Club for the ejection of Botham,
Richards and Garner. He had felt about the Somerset side of the early 1980s
'rather as Carlyle felt about Frederick the Great' (and he is not talking
about Trueman, we suppose). The curse of Mogg was duly pronounced and by
1992 Somerset were bottom of the county table, and worse than that, 'were a
side of no consequence'.
The demands of a weekly deadline are considerable and some of the topical
articles can date very quickly. A November 1991 column on the just-deceased
Robert Maxwell does not look particularly well-judged today, and it is
perhaps brave of Rees-Mogg to include it here. 'I shall remember him with
affection,' he wrote at the time. He updates this now with the remark that
'now I know that when I drank his champagne it may have been fraudulently
paid for'.
What are we to make of Moggonomics? The self-confessed 'loose Keynesian'
from the FT think tank of the 1950s was converted to monetarism by Peter Jay
in his days as economic editor of The Times. Rees-Mogg additionally
encouraged Tim Congdon, who also converted to monetarism in The Times in the
1970s. Temperamentally, though, he claims to be a currency fixer rather than
a floater, a trait reflected in his hankering for a return to gold as
hyperinflation loomed in the 1970s.
Nevertheless he firmly came out a year ago against Britain's membership of
the European exchange rate mechanism, and correctly predicted a crisis some
time in 1992 in which Britain might have to abandon the attempt to maintain
a fixed exchange rate.
Latterly he has moved towards fringe economic doctrines such as the rather
dubious cyclical approach of Juglar and Kondratieff, but who is to say he is
wrong? There is much of interest here, although these are bite-sized rather
than plate-filling portions, and you might find some volcanic ash in your
sandwiches.
