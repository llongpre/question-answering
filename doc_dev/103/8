MEASURING the temperature of molten steel manually is dangerous and costly,
so Vesuvius International, part of Cookson, the international industrial
materials group, has developed a new long-life sensor which can measure the
temperature of molten steel up to 1,8000C for more than 300 hours at a time.
'Steel companies throughout the world are trying to improve the quality of
their steel,'said Wolfgang Loser, president of the German-based Accumetrix
division of Vesuvius.
'Our sensors will monitor the whole process, tell them second by second what
the temperature is and guarantee they produce the best quality steel.'
The new long life sensor, manufactured by the Accumetrix plant in Beaver
Falls,Pennsylvania, is made out of platinum and rhodium and can measure the
temperature of more than 18,000 tons of molten steel being cast at the rate
of six tons a minute.
Vesuvius is also working on a new range of sensors, the size of a walking
stick, which will measure the sulphur, hydrogen,oxygen, phosphor and
nitrogen content of steel.
