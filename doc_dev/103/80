   An archaeological team from the University
of Colorado excavating an ancient Indian village in El Salvador has
discovered what specialists think are the oldest known remains of a
Mayan manuscript.
   The fragmented remains of what appears to be a ``codex,''
pre-Columbian written records, were found on an adobe shelf in a
house buried by a volcanic eruption 1,400 years ago.
   Only three other Mayan codices are known to have survived the
destruction of the Spanish conquest. The origin of a fourth remains
in dispute among scholars. Most codices were religious records
dealing with the astronomical complexities of the Mayan calendar.
   If the fragments prove to be remains of a Mayan codex, it would
be not only the oldest such manuscript, but also the only one ever
discovered in an archaeological excavation, said Dr. Payson Sheets,
director of the dig and a professor of anthropology at CU-Boulder.
   The Joya de Ceren site, on the edge of a small farming village
about 16 miles north west of San Salvador, the capital, was buried
under 15 feet of powdery volcanic ash during the eruption of nearby
Laguna Caldera in the year 600, during the mid-Classic period of
pre-Columbian culture.
   ``The site probably contains the best preserved pre-Columbian
houses and organic remains in Central America,'' Sheets said.
   The fine-grained ash packed tightly around organic material,
giving a level of preservation rarely encountered in archaeology.
Before finding the codex, Sheet's team found wooden poles,
carbonized roof thatch, well-preserved beans in a pot, and intact
leaves.
   Rae Beaubien, a Smithsonian Institution preservation specialist,
flew to El Salvador last week to examine the codex. It is in
extremely poor condition, consisting of ordered layers of paint
flecks embedded in a block of volcanic ash. The paint probably once
covered pages of pounded bark parchments long since deteriorated,
said Beaubien.
   She said the find is ``extremely valuable,'' and even if none of
the writings are legible, scientists will analyze the types of
paint used and the components of the white background coating that
covered the parchment.
   Beaubien will transport the ash block containing the codex to
Smithsonian Institution laboratories in Washington for further
excavation and analysis.
   The oldest known codex prior to this find is dated at A.D.
900-1000.
   Most archaeological research in Central America has focused on
stone palaces and ceremonial centers that survived intact.
   ``As a result,'' said Sheets, ``we know a lot about how the
upper classes lived. But here at Ceren, the unusual level of
preservation provides us with an extraordinary opportunity to learn
about the lives of the lower and middle classes.''
   The Ceren site was discovered during a government construction
project in 1976 and partially excavated by Sheets in 1980. But that
work was suspended for nine years because of the Central American
nation's civil war.
   The current excavation began May 25 and will last through Aug.
12. The work is financed by a $90,000 grant from the National
Science Foundation.
   In the first house excavated, the team has identified women's
work areas for cooking, pottery and clothmaking. Chipped obsidian
tools were made, most likely by men, on a nearby thatch-roofed clay
platform. About 30 ceramic vessels, several intact, have been been
found.
   The scientists used ground-penetrating radar and measurements of
electrical resistance in the ground to find two more underground
structures that also are being excavated this summer.
