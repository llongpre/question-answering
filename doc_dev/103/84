   Hawaiian folklore tells of the movements of the
volcano goddess Pele from one island to another. Without knowing
it, the tellers of these tales were chronicling the scientific
process that formed the Hawaiian archipelago.
   Legend has it that Pele was being chased from island to island
by her sister and nemesis, Na Maka o Kahai, goddess of the sea. In
reality, the ``chase'' was the formation of the islands, part of a
900-mile string of volcanoes that have been active on the Pacific
plate for 70 million years.
   These volcanic islands were formed after passing over a ``hot
spot'' in the Earth's mantle that remains in a fixed location under
the plate, said Reggie Okamura, who has studied volcanoes at the
U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory for 32 years.
   This hot spot remelts the portion of the rock passing over it,
creating magma. The intense heat forces the magma to rise through
the crust. The new magma builds on the previous eruptions in a
layered fashion to form massive undersea mountains whose tips
eventually rise above sea level and become islands, he said. These
are known as shield volcanoes because of their gently sloping
contours.
   ``The process that's happening now pretty much is what happened
earlier to form the other islands,'' Okamura said.
   The Pacific plate is moving northwesterly at a rate of about
four inches a year, Okamura said. Each island _ beginning with
Kauai and Niihau and followed by Oahu, Molokai, Lanai and Maui and
Hawaii _ were active volcanoes at one time.
   A large portion of Hawaii Island, the youngest in the chain,
currently sits over the hot spot. It is the island's location that
presently accounts for the volcanic activity at Kilauea, which has
been in continuous eruption since 1983. About 160 acres of new land
have been created as a result, Okamura said.
   Three of Hawaii Island's five volcanoes have been active in the
last 200 years. The other two, which already have passed over the
hot spot, have been dormant for 3,000 and 6,000 years, respectively.
   Scientists say a new seamount is forming southeast of Hawaii
Island and is about 600 feet below the surface. When it breaks sea
level, thousands of years from now, Loihi will be the newest
Hawaiian island, Okamura said.
   The process that forms Hawaii's volcanoes is different from the
one that forms volcanoes on the continental United States, such as
Mount St. Helens, which blew its top off in a spectacular eruption
in 1980.
   The Cascade range that includes Mount St. Helens was formed by
the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate with the North American
Continental plate. As the Juan de Fuca plate is pushed deeper into
the earth, the friction melts the rock to form highly pressurized
magma that can be released with explosive force, Okamura said.
   While lava from Hawaii's volcanoes sometimes shoots hundreds of
feet into the air, it's unlikely enough pressure could be built up
to cause such a violent eruption as the one at Mount St. Helens, he
said.
   Magma _ called lava only after it reaches the surface _ moves
through the island's volcanoes via a series of tubes and vents. The
tubes are formed when the crust over a lava flow cools, thickens
and stops moving. The rest of the lava continues to pass under it.
   The tubes and vents are created by a system of dykes and sills.
Most of these are found in fractured areas of the volcano known as
rift zones. Lava also can flow over the volcano's crater, or
caldera, Okamura said.
   There are two kinds of lava _ pahoehoe and a'a _ identical in
chemical composition. Pahoehoe lava is black and smooth and
swift-moving. A'a lava is rougher, more fragmented and
slower-moving. Most lava erupts as pahoehoe, with some changing to
a'a as its temperature and gas content decrease. The lava mainly is
composed of silica, iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium and
other minerals, Okamura said.
