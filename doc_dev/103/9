FT  07 APR 94 / People: Grosso leaves Cookson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Roberto Grosso is stepping down as an executive director of Cookson Group,
the specialist industrial materials group, and chief executive of the
ceramics division.
Cookson said in a statement that Grosso 'has decided to leave the group in
order to pursue other interests', and will do so after the annual meeting
next month.
Last month Cookson and Johnson Matthey, the precious metals group, announced
that they were planning to link some of their ceramic interests in a joint
venture to be known as Cookson Matthey Ceramics. Cookson's ceramic supplies
and minerals division, part of its ceramics operations, will be folded into
the joint venture.
Meanwhile, Stephen Howard, currently chief executive in charge of Cookson's
group corporate development and chief executive of the engineered products
division, will also become president and chief executive of Cookson's
Brussels-based Vesuvius advanced refactories group. Gian-Carlo Cozzani,
currently vice president of marketing and sales at Vesuvius, will become
Vesuvius' chief operating officer.
