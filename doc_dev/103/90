  [Text] Santiago, 17 May (EFE)--Chilean officials reported 
today that the Llaima volcano in the Andes mountain range in the 
Chilean region of Araucania has erupted with great intensity; 
therefore, a state of emergency has been declared in that region. 
  The volcano, which is located 700 km south of Santiago at an 
altitude of 3,125 meters, is making underground noise, its smoke 
is reaching a height of 8,000 meters, and lava can be seen in 
its cone. 
  This information was confirmed by Ninth Region Intendant 
Oscar Eltit, who said a state of emergency has been declared in 
the area around the volcano, especially in Vilcun, San Patricio, 
Cherquenco, Melipeuco, and Caracautin in the direction of Temuco. 
  It also has been reported that Carabineros and the Air Force 
sent helicopters to overfly the area. 
  A team made up of geologists and emergency office personnel 
also have left for an on-site evaluation of nearby settlements, 
although no decision has been made yet on an evacuation. 
  According to information from the area, the smoke reaching 
8,000 meters is moving east toward Argentina. 
  Chile, which is located in the so-called Pacific fire belt, 
has 2,085 volcanoes, of which 55 are active, and has an average 
of one eruption every eight months. 
  The most recent eruptions include the Hudson and Lascar 
volcanoes, which affected settlements in southern and northern 
Chile, respectively. In the case of the Lascar volcano, its 
ashes and smoke reached several countries, especially Argentina.
