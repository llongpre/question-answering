<LEADPARA>  Low-frequency tremors were recorded today near Mount Pinatubo, the latest sign
that the volcano may be gearing up for new eruptions, scientists said.;    Ash
spewed late Thursday and early today from the 4,795-foot volcano, whose
eruptions since June 9 have killed 338 people, including the 9-year-old
daughter of a U.S. Air Force sergeant.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Philippine Institute of Vulcanology and Seismology predicted light to
moderate ash fall today in provinces near the volcano and urged residents to
be alert to the possibility of devastating avalanches from the tons of debris
on Mount Pinatubo's slopes.;    Institute officials said 168 separate quakes
were recorded near the volcano in the 24 hours ending early this morning.;   
More ominous, however, was the reappearance of low-frequency harmonic tremors,
which indicate magma is rising to the surface and pressure is building up
inside the volcano.;    Institute Director Raymundo Punongbayan said satellite
photographs showed a new lava dome forming in the crater, building up pressure
for a possible major eruption.;    Institute geologist Julio Sabit said such
low-frequency tremors preceded the June 14-15 eruptions, which dumped tons of
ash throughout central and southern Luzon and heavily damaged the U.S.-run
Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Base.  </TEXT>
