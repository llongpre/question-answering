   Scientists plan to install a $4 million
observatory on an underwater volcano, complete with cameras,
microphones and seismometers to monitor the gradual birth of the
next Hawaiian island.
   University of Hawaii researchers hope the Hawaiian Undersea
Geo-Observatory, or HUGO, will be in place on Loihi seamount within
two years, using its instruments to study earthquakes and
eruptions, geology and geophysics professor Fred K. Duennebier said
Wednesday.
   ``It's a good idea to monitor undersea volcanoes,'' said Bob
Tilling, a U.S. Geological Survey volcanologist. ``More than half
the world's volcanoes are on the sea floor. The challenge is to
capture one of these erupting because we haven't done that yet.''
   Loihi is a rugged, steep-sided submarine volcano about 22 miles
southeast of the Island of Hawaii. It rises roughly 11,200 feet
above the surrounding sea floor. Its cratered summit is now about
3,300 feet beneath the surface of the Pacific, Duennebier said.
   Volcanologists are certain it is active but haven't actually
observed an eruption. Intense earthquake activity suggests
eruptions happened in 1986, 1988 and early this year, Duennebier
said during the American Geophysical Union's fall meeting.
   ``It will be the next Hawaiian island in about 50,000 years or
so'' once eruptions build the summit above the ocean's surface, he
added. ``I wouldn't buy real estate yet.''
   The observatory will be a network of 20 or more cameras and
instruments plugged into electrical boxes located on a system of
electro-optical cables draped across Loihi's summit and slopes -
like TVs, lamps and stereo equipment linked by extension cords in
someone's living room.
   HUGO will be connected to the Big Island by another cable that
will provide power and also carry data from the observatory to a
recording station and scientists on shore.
   Duennebier said that once a ship lays the cable and boxes,
unmanned remote-controlled submarines and manned submersible
vehicles will plug cameras, microphones, seismometers and heat and
chemical sensors into the network.
   Scientists who study the sea floor now usually use instruments
that are dropped off ships, fall to the ocean floor, record
scientific data on tape and then are recovered by ships.
   Duennebier said HUGO's instruments will have the advantage of
being able to collect data on quakes and eruptions and send the
information to land immediately. If a camera or instrument breaks
down or becomes obsolete, a submersible vehicle or
remote-controlled submarine can retrieve it and install a new one.
   The observatory will be able to collect pictures and information
for at least 10 years unless it is buried by undersea lava flows or
landslides, Duennebier said. He said the instruments would be
placed in areas where they are least likely to be damaged.
   During the apparent eruption of Loihi in 1986, the university
installed seven temporary seismometers on Loihi's slopes. They
detected thousands of earthquakes at the rate of about three daily,
while seismometers on land detected only three per month.
Duennebier said that shows the value of installing a permanent
observatory like HUGO.
   The Hawaiian Islands were created by a ``hot spot,'' a plume of
molten rock that rises from deep inside the Earth. As a giant plate
of Earth's crust was dragged over the hot spot, volcanic eruptions
from the hot spot formed each of the islands in succession.
   Loihi is now over the hot spot, which also has branches feeding
Hawaii's Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes.
   The network of cables and electrical plug-in boxes for the
observatory will cost roughly $4 million, although about two-thirds
of that cost has been donated by AT&amp;T Co. in the form of 25 miles
of undersea cable and the use of a cable-laying ship to install it.
   The university also got $100,000 of $2.5 million it requested
for the project from the National Science Foundation. Duennebier
and his colleague, oceanographer Alexander Malahoff, hope to use
that money to start buying cameras and monitoring instruments for
the observatory.
   Because the observatory will be equipped with numerous plug-in
boxes, many other researchers will be able to install their own
instruments on Loihi, Duennebier said.
