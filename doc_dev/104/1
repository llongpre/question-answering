   Acts of persecution and harsh anti-Semitism among
Nazi collaborators were relived and re-examined Monday, 50 years
after the start of a notorious crackdown that led to the deaths of
more than 73,000 French Jews.
   ``We must not blame the (Nazi) occupation for what was the sole
responsibility of the legitimate French government. The laws met
only utter silence from the French people,'' said former Justice
Minister Robert Badinter, who presided over the daylong symposium
on ``The Vichy Laws.''
   ``Vichy was obsessed with taking measures against Jews,''
Badinter told about 250 people at the conference.
   ``The Vichy Laws,'' named for the Vichy Government that
controlled unoccupied France and territories from 1940 to 1943,
prevented France's 350,000 Jews from holding public office,
teaching, attending university, owning stores and working in the
media. It was implemented 11 weeks after Paris fell to the Germans.
   The laws, later reinforced by measures to send Jews to
concentration camps, defined ``who is a Jew,'' using criteria far
more sweeping than the racial laws drafted by the Nazis.
   Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld estimated 3,000 Jews died from cold
and starvation from 1940 to 1942 in French-run camps ``where there
wasn't a single German soldier.''
   In all, 76,000 Jews were deported to death camps from France.
About 2,500 survived, historians estimate.
   ``The Jewish Laws did not come out of the blue because
anti-Semitism existed in France well before the German victory in
June 1940,'' said Henri Amouroux, a historian at the symposium,
sponsored by the Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation and
the Sons and Daughters of Jews Deported from the France.
   ``Anti-Semitism developed in the 1930s in a climate of economic
and social crisis. Thousands of Jews, chased out of Poland and
Austria, fleeing the Nazis, came to France and were accused of
taking jobs,'' he said.
   Historians say the Vichy laws were a cornerstone of a right-wing
ideology that sought to undo the liberalizing, human
rights-oriented reforms of the French Revolution.
   ``The laws erased the advances made during the Age of
Enlightenment,'' said Zev Sternhell, a history professor at the
University of Jerusalem. ``They reflect a new concept of the
nation, not as a melting pot but as an extended family with
everybody having the same blood.''
   For historian Denis Peschansky, the laws were a way for Marshal
Philippe Petain, Vichy's leader, to explain the French military
defeat and punish those deemed responsible.
   ``Petain had to find reasons within French society for the
debacle - he certainly couldn't blame the army because it was in
power - so he blamed the Jews, Communists, Freemasons and other
foreigners,'' Peschansky said.
   The laws also revoked the citizenship of about 400,000 Jews in
colonial Algeria and Morocco and Tunisia, which were French
protectorates.
   ``My mother, who had six small children and worked in the
arsenal in Algiers, was fired immediately,'' said a woman in the
audience.
   Other survivors described the discrimination and persecution
that followed.
   In September 1943, Samuel and Rachel Ewenczyk closed their dry
goods store in Grenoble, fleeing to the Alps to escape deportation.
   ``One week later, thanks to the Vichy laws, the French police
requisitioned the store as a Jewish store, and sold it to a
non-Jewish person,'' Mrs. Ewenczyk, 78, recalled.
   After Grenoble was liberated by U.S. troops in August 1944, the
family returned to claim the property.
   ``The man in the shop protested, saying he had bought the shop,
but my husband asked, `Who did you buy it from? I never sold it.'
We were back in business a week later,'' she said.
   The Vichy government, named for a city in central France, was
never recognized by the Allies. The Nazis annulled the armistice
with Vichy after the Allies invaded North Africa in November 1943
and occupied France.
