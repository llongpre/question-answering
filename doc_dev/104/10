   The French are celebrating with unprecedented
fanfare the 50th anniversary of Charles De Gaulle's historic appeal
for armed resistance against Nazi tyranny.
   Yet few people actually heard the radio broadcast, and many
French people _ though they might deny it now _ were content with
the leaders who had just surrendered to Hitler.
   Known as the ``appel'' of June 18, De Gaulle's fervent,
four-minute speech was addressed to soldiers and civilians in
England and France.
   In a deep, gravelly voice edged with tension, he asked: ``Must
we abandon all hope? Is our defeat final? No! ... France is not
alone! ... The flame of French resistance must not and shall not
die!''
   But the army was in disarray, and most civilians were fleeing
their homes. The chaos and panic were such that 90,000 families
reported having lost children during the mass exodus.
   Many of those who did manage to tune in the BBC on their wartime
wireless radios sought assurances from 84-year-old Philippe Petain,
a bemedalled World War I field marshal who had urged Premier Paul
Reynaud to sign the armistice the previous day.
   Regis Debray, a former adviser to President Francois Mitterrand,
has suggested in a recent book that in June 1940, nine out of 10
French supported Petain. In fact, by the end of the summer, only
7,000 people had reached De Gaulle's London headquarters.
   The vast majority of the French saw De Gaulle as a brash rebel
who fled his native soil hours after France capitulated _ to join
forces with an old enemy, England.
   By contrast, the grandfatherly, taciturn Petain, known as ``the
hero of Verdun,'' urged an end to the conflict, which he believed
France could never win.
   Petain's popularity began to fade only after Vichy-led police
zealously rounded up Jews for deportation to concentration camps _
123,000 died _ and began sending French workers to Germany.
   Fifty years later, the French are celebrating their national
hero unreservedly _ with virtually no reminders of the
collaborationist regime or tolerance of Nazism that De Gaulle
vigorously condemned.
   Instead, politicians try to capitalize on his legacy, each vying
to appear as his heir.
   Sound and light extravaganzas will re-enact the dramatic moments
of the war, including the Nazi invasion, the June 18 appeal and the
liberation.
   Paris has been plastered with 6,000 posters recalling the
highlights of De Gaulle's career. Art exhibitions, documentaries
and television specials _ even a computer game _ recapture the
grandeur and charisma of ``le General.''
   A giant replica of the wireless _ the kind that ordinary
citizens would later risk their lives listening to _ will be
erected at the Place de la Concorde and will broadcast De Gaulle's
wartime speeches from dawn to dusk on June 18.
   Retired Gen. Andre Delpech, a resistance fighter who was
tortured and sent to Dachau in 1944, remembers the excitement of
the June 18 appeal. He was then 15.
   ``Somehow, news had reached our remote hamlet that some general,
whose name we didn't know, was going to make an important speech
from London. We could barely make out his voice... Afterwards, the
adults stayed up long into the night discussing the few sentences
they managed to decipher.''
   Meanwhile, radio announcers reread the appeal during the evening
and into the wee hours of the morning. The following day De Gaulle
again took the microphone to express his firm belief that he
``spoke in the name of France.''
   ``Ici Londres'' _ ``This is London'' _ became a codeword for the
resistance, opening nightly broadcasts that provided news from the
free world and transmitted coded messages to underground networks
in France.
   Political journalist Robert Quiriconi was a high school student
in Algeria when De Gaulle founded the Free French movement and
hoisted the French tricolor over his London home.
   ``At flag-raising ceremonies, we were supposed to sing a song
praising Petain instead of the `Marseillaise,''' he said. ``I had
heard about De Gaulle from my classmates, and from then on, we were
Gaullists, and refused to sing.''
