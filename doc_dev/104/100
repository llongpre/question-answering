A Woman of Singular Occupation by Penelope Gilliatt (Scribners: $17.95; 180 
pages) 
</P>
<P>
Known for her incisive New Yorker film reviews, the wry and worldly script for 
"Sunday Bloody Sunday," five distinguished short story collections, four prior 
novels and a variety of essays and criticism, Penelope Gilliatt appears here in 
another persona altogether. The easy and natural dialogue of her earlier 
fiction has been supplanted by sentences that yield their meaning only after 
the third re-reading, and then grudgingly. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the heroine, Catherine, explaining the magic of the Orient Express to 
her lover, Thomas. "Oh dove, that train. It's stood for so great a change in 
us. All the way through the 19th Century it was something purely thought, 
something true, an expression of a real belief in the perfectibility of man. 
But now here we are, having proved ourselves to be so imperfect that the 
species has spawned the Nazis. The tonic fact is that a great many men and 
women haven't allowed themselves to be jaded" -- and this is pillow talk; the 
heroine unrehearsed and at her most spontaneous. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Absolutely Impenetrable 
</P>
<P>
Catherine in public can be absolutely impenetrable. "The discovery of the 
essential tuning solution that the seven semitones of a perfect fifth should 
not be tuned as 7 but as 7.109550008654. The brilliant tiny difference called 
the Pythagorean comma" -- a mouthful calculated to challenge the verbal gifts 
of the Royal Shakespeare Company. Catherine, of course, is not only an 
extraordinarily gifted musician, but also a foreign agent. Still, a novel is 
meant to be read, not decoded. 
</P>
<P>
The plot begins straightforwardly enough, but soon becomes so entangled, opaque 
and confused that it actually defies description. Though usually the reviewer 
must struggle to avoid giving away the resolution of an espionage novel, in 
this case the risks are negligible. Only the author knows what really happened, 
and she has apparently decided to keep some of the crucial secrets to herself.

Catherine de Rochefauld is the dazzlingly beautiful and formidably talented 
wife of the French ambassador to Turkey. The year is 1939, and the novel opens 
as she is traveling alone to Istanbul on the Orient Express. Her husband is an 
ardent supporter of the Vichy government. For some time now, Catherine has 
shared neither his politics nor his bed. Thomas Drake, a young American banker 
posted to Istanbul, sees Catherine on that most romantic of trains and is 
instantly smitten. Although a passionate affair immediately ensues, Thomas is 
disturbed by Catherine's mysterious errands, frequent disappearances and 
elliptical allusions to dark secrets.

Sympathetic Character 
</P>
<P>
Only 28 years old, far from home and totally bewildered by events around him, 
Thomas is by far the most sympathetic character in the book. His predicament is 
at least perfectly understandable, while everyone else's remains obscure. 
Catherine has an American friend, Ann Wisner, who shares her fondness for 
elevated discourse and also seems to have come to a similar sort of 
understanding with her Turkish husband, Kemal. 
</P>
<P>
The mysterious fortune teller, Hilda, is less easily definable; a pity, because 
she plays a pivotal role in the novel. Her profession entitles her to speak 
even more circumlocutiously than anyone else, which is saying a lot. Regardless 
of nationality or proficiency in English, everyone in the novel attempts to 
speak in Catherine's lofty style, a technical feat beyond them all. 
</P>
<P>
Vital codes are hidden in shoes and transmitted by wireless to De Gaulle; 
people are exposed to terrible dangers, missions are accomplished and the war 
is finally over. Suddenly, we're in the 1980s, and Thomas Drake is a 
74-year-old nuclear physicist. He has never forgotten Catherine and those 
wonderful years in Istanbul, and miracle of miracles, the last 2 1/2 pages are 
as clear and to the point as anything Gilliatt ever wrote for the New Yorker.
