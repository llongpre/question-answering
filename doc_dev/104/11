   Hundreds of former resistance fighters joined
political and church leaders Monday at a tribute to Charles De
Gaulle on the 50th anniversary of his historic radio appeal for
armed struggle against the Nazis.
   Notre Dame Cathedral was filled with an audience that included
Premier Michel Rocard, Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac and British
Ambassador Sir Ewen Fergusson. De Gaulle's son, Philippe, also was
there.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris praised De
Gaulle's crucial role in the struggle ``for the dignity of all men
aganst inhuman and totalitarian ambition.''
   Later, many dignitaries and resistance veterans looked on as
President Francois Mitterrand unveiled a plaque at the Arc de
Triomphe inscribed with the text of De Gaulle's appeal. Church
bells throughout France chimed to mark the occasion.
   Thousands of tourists and Parisians flocked Monday to the Place
de la Concorde, where a 115-foot-high replica of a 1940s radio
re-broadcast the June 18 call from London and other well-known De
Gaulle speeches.
   Few of De Gaulle's countrymen actually heard his dramatic
appeal, in a voice edged with tension: ``Has the last word been
said? Must we abandon all hope? Is our defeat final? No! ... France
is not alone ... the flame of the resistance must not and shall not
die.''
   Many of those who did manage to tune in the BBC to hear it knew
little about the general claiming to represent France. Instead,
they preferred the grandfatherly reassurances of Philippe Petain, a
World War I field marshal, who urged surrender to the Germans.
Petain became the head of the collaborationist Vichy regime.
   De Gaulle's fervent, four-minute speech helped change the course
of French history.
   The resistance movement played a critical role in the Allied
victory. After the war, De Gaulle founded a political party and
served as president from 1959 to 1969. He died a year later.
   Daylong celebrations of De Gaulle's broadcast culminated Monday
night with a sound and light extravaganza on the Seine River.
   More than 100,000 spectators crowded onto river banks and
bridges to watch as scores of barges floated down the Seine
carrying torches, flags and hundreds of performers in period
costume reenacting the German invasion of France, De Gaulle's
flight to London, D-Day and the liberation.
   The show included simulations of the bombings raids that
terrified civilians when France fell. At that time, three-fifths of
the population took to the roads in cars, wagons, bicycles and even
wheelbarrows to escape the German onslaught.
   The show, which also celebrates the centenary of De Gaulle's
birth, cost $5.7 million, raised from private sources by De Gaulle
Centenary Association.
   Early Monday, vandals demaged and defaced De Gaulle memorials in
three communities on the northern outskirts of Paris, police said.
No arrests were reported.
