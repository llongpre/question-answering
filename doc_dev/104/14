Suppose Edward Heath, the British prime minister from 1970 to 1974, had been
mixed up with Oswald Moseley's fascist movement in the 1930s and had helped
draw up a list of undesirables to help an eventual occupying power.
Even in secretive Britain it might have emerged that he was not, perhaps, a
wholly suitable potential leader. At the very least the cabinet secretary
would have been tipped off by the head of MI5: 'Ted hasn't got 20 shillings
for the pound,' or some such argot would have scuppered him.
In France, things are different. A bit of fascist collusion for a man of
Francois Mitterrand's generation was not exceptional. Then a bit of light
work on the other side and one could emerge from the cocoon of collaboration
as a butterfly of the resistance. But Mitterrand, at a time of his own
choosing, has co-operated in revealing the truth about his past. Admittedly
the French president did wait until the last days of his presidency and
maybe his life, to come clean, but come clean he did in backing the now
well-known book by Pierre Pean, Une jeunesse francaise.
That, and the serious worries about his health, led to a long television
interview on Monday. There, Mitterrand argued that he had not done much that
was wrong. He had been a bit late in changing sides. He had befriended the
man who had been the Nazis' manager of the Holocaust in France, Rene
Bousquet. But Bousquet had been publicly cleared, even though his associates
had left nobody in any doubt as to his central role in the matter.
The newspapers reacted diversely. Liberation said that anyone looking for a
mea culpa when it came to Bousquet might well have spared themselves the
trouble. One provincial paper thought the president could end his term with
a clear conscience.
There was alarm about the role of the press in France, but even that took
different forms. Le Figaro said the press had turned on Mitterrand as it had
turned on other presidents at the end of their reign. But, as is usual with
Le Figaro, the reality is different. Most facts about Mitterrand, it seems,
were, by and large, in or near the public domain. It would not have taken
much to show he was on the fringes of the nastier xenophobic groups in the
1930s and that he dined with Bousquet in the 1980s. After all, he put a
wreath on the tomb of the Vichy leader, Marshall Petain, annually until
public opinion forced a change a few years ago.
So the question is, why was it that the truth did not come out until
Mitterrand licensed it? Only Le Monde has taken this question to heart. Its
in-house ombudsman, Andre Laurens, wrote a 5,000 word piece headed:
'Francois Mitterrand under the eye of Le Monde.' He explained how the paper
had played a vital role in exposing the many scandals of his reign and got
into trouble as a result: 'The irony is that the paper is reproached on the
one hand for not having told what it did not and could not know, and on the
other for not having believed the statements of public figures.'
Those who expose unpleasant secrets in France do get into trouble. But the
problem of Mitterrand runs deeper than that. The French cannot resolve it.
They like to think Charles de Gaulle was the presidential incarnation of
France, but of course the truth is that Mitterrand is the mirror of the
nation. He is the two Frances, the nation of the enlightenment, the
revolution and liberty. And of xenophobia, anti-republicanism and
intolerance.
Mitterrand symbolises the contradictory aspects of France's recent past  -
the ideological opportunism and the unique nature of French collaboration
with the Nazis, the myths of the resistance, the creation of a successful
modern state and the continuity of pointless minorities on the far left and
far right.
The National Front leapt to his defence. Its weekly, National-Hebdo, ran the
headline, 'Nothing to get excited about' and reported that anybody who had
read the far-right press would have been familiar with all Mitterrand's
transactions with the Vichy regime and he had done nothing wrong anyway.
The curious fact is that France's great figures, unlike Mitterrand, always
emerge from some glorious national salon des refuses. They are outsiders -
Henri IV and Napoleon, or rejects and rebels - Voltaire, Lavoisier, Victor
Hugo and de Gaulle.
In Britain, by contrast, all national heroes - Elizabeth I, Shakespeare,
Adam Smith - were heroes to their contemporaries. Sometimes that is a fluke
of history. No British leader could have faced the choices that confronted
Mitterrand: none could have supplied appropriately damaging material for a
sensational political biography called 'A Youth of an Englishman'. So no
Englishman can master the arcane intellectual skills that come so easily to
the French. He has no need of them.
