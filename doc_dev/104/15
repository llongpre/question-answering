   Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld on Friday hailed a
magazine report as the first French media account of France's role
in the roundup and deportation of 3,500 Jewish children who later
died at Auschwitz.
   ``The episode in well-known to historians,'' Klarsfeld said in
an interview, ``but this is the first time a journalist has ever
gone to the scene of the crime to interview people who lived
there.''
   The cover story in this week's L'Express magazine, published
Thursday, details the role of the French police in the roundup.
   Klarsfeld, who tracked down the Lyon Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie,
said he hoped the article would help speed court action against
Rene Bousquet, 80, charged with crimes against humanity.
   Bousquet was chief of the national police during the
deportations, which Klarsfeld said were conducted by the
collaborationist Vichy government to curry favor with the Nazi
occupiers.
   Eric Conan, a reporter for L'Express, visited the towns of
Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande, sites of two French concentration
camps where the children spent their last days before being shipped
to the Nazis' Auschwitz death camp.
   ``In Pithiviers, nothing, absolutely nothing, officially
commemorates the agony experienced by the children before their
deaths,'' he wrote.
   A collective gravestone in Beaune-la-Rolande shows three small
children died at that time. The stone reads simply, ``Victims of
Hitler's barbarism.''
   ``This is false: they were under the auspices of the French
government until the moment they died,'' Conan wrote.
   The children were arrested in Paris with their families July
16-17, 1942, in the infamous ``Vel d'Hiv Roundup,'' named for their
destination, a large cycling stadium.
   The families were kept kept at the stadium for days without
food, water or sanitary facilities. They were transferred to
Pithiviers and Beaune-la-Rolande. The adults were sent directly on
to Auschwitz, but the children, including babies and toddlers,
remained for weeks in the camps, where many died of starvation and
disease.
   They were later shipped to Auschwitz and sent to the gas
chambers on arrival.
   Klarsfeld said French authorities ordered the deportations of
the children. The Nazis, he said, had issued orders for the roundup
of only Jews over age 16 for fear of inciting the occupied
population.
   ``They never would have taken the risk of arresting and dragging
children into the streets of Paris,'' Klarsfeld said.
