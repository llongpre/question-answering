   Nazi collaborator Jean Leguay, charged with
committing crimes against humanity, has died in a Paris hospital,
his lawyer said Tuesday. He was 79.
   Leguay died Saturday after a year-long battle with liver cancer,
his lawyer, Yves Jaffre said.
   Leguay was a senior police official in the Vichy government,
which collaborated with the Nazis during their World War II
occupation of France. He faced two charges for aiding in the
deportation of French Jews but neither came to trial.
   In 1979, he was charged for his role in the July 1942 roundup of
12,884 Jews _ including 4,051 children _ who were gathered in a
Paris cycling stadium, the Velodrome d'Hiver, and deported to Nazi
death camps.
   The second set of charges, filed in 1986, involved the
deportation of 444 Jews from Paris in August 1942.
   Leguay was deputy police chief in the occupied zone at the time
of the deportations.
   When he was charged in 1979, Leguay issued a statement saying he
``never had any concern from 1940 to 1944 other than protecting the
French from their occupants.'' He was detained briefly in that year
then released pending trial.
   Serge Klarsfeld, the French lawyer who led the effort to bring
criminal charges against Leguay, described him as ``a political
police officer charged with negotiations with the Germans.''
Klarsfeld accused Leguay of persuading the Germans to include Jewish
children as well as adults in the roundups.
   Lawyer Jaffre said Leguay ``did nothing but obey the orders of
the Interior Secretary at the time.'' That the investigation
``dragged on for 10 years clearly proved there was nothing in the
dossier,'' he said.
   Under French law, there is no time limit on prosecutions for
crimes against humanity.
