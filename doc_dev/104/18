PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand and four senior government ministers today
begin a four-day tour of Israel and Jordan, in an attempt to rebuild
France's weakened influence in the Middle East.
He will visit Israel for the first time since 1982, when Mr Mitterrand was
the first serving French president to do so, thus opening a reconciliation
between the two countries. Paris has been eager to forge closer ties since
the June election victory of an Israeli Labour administration, committed to
progress in peace talks with the Arabs.
However, the tour comes at a sensitive moment in relations with Israel,
because of Mr Mitterrand's recent refusal to apologise for the wartime Vichy
regime's persecution of French Jews and his decision to send a wreath to the
tomb of Marshal Philippe Petain, the Vichy leader.
French influence in the Middle East has dwindled since the Gulf war, because
of its arms sales to Iraq, and the country has played only a minor role in
the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
France has accordingly started to play an important part in encouraging
talks on economic matters between the two sides, having hosted last month an
economic conference of Israelis and Palestinians in Paris. The French
government tabled a plan to rebuild the regional rail network and plans to
promote this idea on the coming tour.
The 150-strong delegation, which includes senior industrialists, will focus
on immediate rail projects, such as for a link to the Red Sea port of Eilat
and the electrification of a line from Haifa to Tel Aviv.
Mr Mitterrand, who last week called for an end to the 'unacceptable,
immoral' Arab boycott of Israel, will meet Palestinian leaders tomorrow. He
will then move on to Jordan, a long-standing French ally. He is due to
discuss the progress of the peace talks with King Hussein.
