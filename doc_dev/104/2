IF THE deranged killer of Rene Bousquet, the former Vichy government police
chief, acted criminally in the eyes of the French authorities, it must also
be said that he acted conveniently. Bousquet's murder on June 8 came barely
a month before France's first annual day of official remembrance for victims
of Vichy's 'racist and anti-semitic persecutions.'
As a result, when prime minister Edouard Balladur delivered his remembrance
day speech in Paris on July 16, he was no longer obliged to explain how the
man who had organised many of those 'racist and anti-semitic persecutions'
was still leading, at 84, the comfortable life of a retired banker barely a
mile away on the Avenue Raphael.
Though coincidental, the death of Bousquet and the introduction of a
remembrance day for Vichy's victims have dramatised a national dilemma for
France in which history, morality and politics each plays a part: the
dilemma of whether Vichy, the wartime government of Marshal Philippe Petain,
which sought to lead a defeated and part-occupied France along the 'way of
collaboration' with Hitler, is a chapter of French history best remembered,
or best forgotten.
The inaugurating of a remembrance day may argue that the first of those
sentiments - to remember - has gained the high ground. But Rene Bousquet,
while he lived, proved the enduring power of those who would rather forget.
He displayed to his end a grim confidence that he would never be required to
face trial for his part in the deportation of some 75,000 Jews from France
to the Nazi death-camps.
'If they want to mess with me,' he said shortly before his death, 'then fine
. . . I will defend myself, and I have the material to do so. But I will be
utterly astonished if the trial takes place.'
It was with Bousquet's authority that French police arrested 13,000 Jews in
Paris on July 16-17 1942, including 4,000 children whom even the Nazis had
been willing to spare. Most were held in the Velodrome d'Hiver, a
since-demolished bicycle-track, before being sent to French-run
concentration camps south of Paris - and thence to Auschwitz.
The date of the start of that round-up having been fixed for the new
remembrance day, the ceremony in Paris was held at the site of the
Velodrome, where unofficial ceremonies have taken place in past years. In
the course of a short and solemn speech, the prime minister declared that
France was 'in mourning,' and repeated the promise given by President
Francois Mitterrand that a monument would be erected 'to perpetuate the
memory of what took place here.'
Until that monument arises, the perpetuation of memory will rest heavily on
the work of Serge Klarsfeld, the French lawyer and Nazi-hunter who published
his investigation of Bousquet 10 years ago in a book called Vichy-Auschwitz.
Impelled by Klarsfeld, the French public prosecutor eventually charged
Bousquet in 1991 with 'crimes against humanity' (which under French law
enjoy no statute of limitation); but the case vanished into such thickets of
procedural delay that the prospective defendant was not alone in his doubts
that it would ever reach court.
Bousquet had already walked free from one post-war trial in 1949 because the
courts at that time were concerned with treason, not genocide, even though
the leaders of Vichy had furthered both causes. A half-century later, he was
the last survivor of those who planned the worst of Vichy's persecutions. To
that extent, his death has given one irreversible victory to those who think
Vichy best forgotten.
The possibility has been lost for ever of a great pedagogical trial which
might have examined and judged not only Bousquet himself, but also, through
him, the regime of which he was a part. French courts may yet try Paul
Touvier, a former officer in the collaborationist Militia, for alleged war
crimes. But Touvier was a relatively low-level figure, and is in any case
charged with acting on the orders of the Gestapo, not of Vichy.
To explain the last and decisive hesitations of French justice in respect of
the Bousquet case, Klarsfeld and others have pointed a finger at President
Mitterrand, who worked for the Vichy government from 1941-42 before entering
the resistance. Mitterrand reputedly met Bousquet in Vichy, and they moved
in the same political circles after the war.
Klarsfeld suggests that Mitterrand may nurse a 'nostalgia for his youth.' It
is, at any rate, an observable truth that the further the French president's
motives and actions extend into his past, the more impenetrable they become.
If Mitterrand did indeed choose discreetly to discourage Bousquet's trial,
then he may well have done so partly out of a political judgment that such a
trial would not be in the public interest; partly out of a personal loyalty;
and partly out of that strange private reservoir of affections which has
also led him to send a bouquet of roses to Marshal Petain's tomb each
November 11, the anniversary of the ending of the first world war.
Only after a barrage of criticism from his friends as well as political
rivals last November did the president finally concede that he would have to
find a way of managing differently the 'contradictions of history.' His
decree, three months later, instituting the remembrance day for Marshal
Petain's victims, must be read as a realisation of that promise.
In opposing a judicial reopening of the great questions of Vichy, President
Mitterrand would also have been echoing the policy of France since the
Liberation. It was General de Gaulle who recognised in 1944 that France
could scarcely take its place among the victors of the second world war if
it also acknowledged the realities of the armistice and the collaboration
over which the Vichy government had presided.
His response was to decree that the French Third Republic had assigned power
unconstitutionally to Marshal Petain in June 1940; that the Vichy government
had been illegal from its formation; and that the armistice concluded by
Petain with Germany had been void. To efface what had once been the
substance of Vichy, the Gaullists substituted their insistence that the
'true' France had never surrendered; that the flame of legitimate government
had been carried through its dark hour by de Gaulle's Free French forces;
and that the mass of ordinary people remaining in France had manifested
their loyalty by resisting the Nazi occupant.
It necessarily followed from the Gaullist version of history that atrocities
which had taken place in wartime France must have been attributable to
Germans, not Frenchmen. The plain fact that the Vichy government had devised
and implemented a policy of Jewish persecution, initially of its own
volition and later as the French contribution to the Nazi genocide, was -
with its potentially devastating implications for France's reputation - the
most taboo subject of all, and one which the specially-convened High Court
of Justice showed absolutely no disposition to pursue in its post-war trials
of Vichy officials.
Thus Bousquet, among the last defendants to go before the court, faced no
serious questioning about his role in the arrest and deportation of Jews
from France, and the documentary evidence in his prosecution file went
unexamined.
Suppressing the shame of Vichy helped restore the morale and the unity of
France. But it also impeded the drawing of lessons about how and why the
machinery of French government had in reality passed very smoothly into
Petain's hands.
Not until May 1992, for example, did the national training centre for the
French police force feel able to conduct its first internal seminars on
police work during the war, the Ministry of the Interior having judged,
according to Le Monde, 'that the wounds were sufficiently healed for
reflection to be undertaken at the institutional level.'
Those who attended the seminars were reminded that Nazi Germany had been
able, with only 3,000 members of its own security services operating in
France, to secure the arrest and deportation from France of 75,000 Jews and
40,000 resistants, as well as to supply itself with 650,000 French forced
labourers.
Had the French police refused to do the Nazis' work, Germany would have been
obliged either to commit much more of its own manpower to France, or else
reduce the scale of its oppressions there.
Today, if arguments still rage about the motives and the intentions of
Petain's government, the concrete actions of Vichy are neither denied nor
deniable.
The problem which remains is one of political acceptance. The victims of
Vichy were persecuted on French soil, by agents of a French government, in
conformity with the French law of the day.
Can a formula be found by which the Republic of France may respond
honourably to the suffering of Vichy's victims, and yet still, as it
believes it must, avoid identifying their tormentors at least to some degree
with France itself?
According to Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the former French defence minister,
the danger of blurring the distinction between the 'Vichy' and the 'France'
of 1940-44 remains that France would then 'stand with Germany, Italy and
Japan in the fascist camp which lost the second world war . . . Her
permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, with right of
veto, would lose its justification . . . By going down that road, France
would abdicate its place in the world.'
If Chevenement's warnings appear exaggerated, they reflect well enough
France's acute sensitivity to its 'rank,' particularly in relation to
Germany within Europe.
Yet as the decades pass, and as death claims both the tormentors and
survivors of Vichy, the justification for denying Vichy so absolutely must
appear increasingly open to question, if the legacy and the lessons of Vichy
are to be rooted enduringly in France's memory.
In the view of Alfred Grosser, France's leading political scientist: 'Let us
not make-believe that the Vichy regime was a little island standing apart
from French society, or that the ruling class of France went into
hibernation until the parenthesis was closed and the Republic could resume
its interrupted life.
'The victims of Vichy, French and non-French alike, were indeed the victims
of France. A France with a twisted expression, but a France which stands
clearly within the continuity of its own history.'
