In recent days Francois Mitterrand has been behaving like a man clearing his
desk, putting a gloss on his presidential record for posterity, and emptying
out dusty drawers before the historical cleaners arrive to uncover more
murky incidents in his past.
One of his doctors affirmed yesterday that the president, whose 78th
birthday falls next month and who has been suffering from prostate cancer
for at least two years, was 'fine'. And indeed on Thursday Mr Mitterrand was
in Berlin to take the farewell to his country's troops there, and he was
back in Paris yesterday to greet President Jiang Zemin of China, with whom
he will sign some big-figure trade contracts today.
But what the president has told Le Figaro newspaper in two long interviews
this week, and Mr Pierre Pean, the author of a startling book on the 1936-47
period of his youth, has left an extraordinary ambiguity around everything,
including his health. He told Le Figaro that he reckoned his cancer 'will be
obliging enough for me to finish my term' which ends next May, but also said
he was conscious that he would only be around 'for a few months or years'.
As Mr Mitterrand, a specialist in ambiguity, well realises, such comments
only fuel the uncertainty in the markets and the French political world
about an early election. In addition, the Socialist president has managed to
spray criticism and praise around in such a way as to help destabilise
French conservatives. This would be wholly welcome to his own party, if it
were not for the fact that revelations about his right-wing and Vichyist
associations before, during and after the second world war have shocked many
Socialists.
It was already known that the young Mitterrand participated in some
right-wing movements before the war, and that after his escape from a German
prisoner camp in 1941, he worked for the Vichy administration for a year or
so before sliding into the resistance.
But what has shocked many French is the disclosure of Mr Mitterrand's
friendly associations with Mr Jean-Paul Martin and Mr Rene Bousquet, senior
officials in the Vichy police. Mr Mitterrand, while president, apparently
attended Mr Martin's funeral in 1986. He also told Mr Pean that he
considered Mr Bousquet 'sympathetic'; yet as president he inaugurated a day
of national mourning for one of the Jewish deportations in 1942 of which
Bousquet was accused. The latter was assassinated last year before he could
face war crimes charges.
In the same interviews, Mr Mitterrand also delves into his more recent past.
He says, for instance, that his 1989 call for a Europe-wide confederation
was misinterpreted as a bid to keep eastern Europe out of the European
Union, and that his 1991 resistance to German calls to recognise ex-Yugoslav
republics' borders was not an attempt to freeze the Titoist order there.
But of more current interest are the various stones he casts in the path of
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur by revealing divisions in the conservative
government over whose Wednesday cabinet meetings he presides. In addition to
warning rank-and-file Gaullists of 'the certain tendency' of their
government 'to re-enter the ranks of Nato', he also notes that Mr Alain
Juppe, the foreign minister, sided with him  - and against the prime and
defence ministers - on intervention in Rwanda. On Algeria, he points out the
way that Mr Balladur sided with Mr Charles Pasqua, the interior minister,
and against Mr Juppe.
Anything resembling praise for Mr Juppe is tacit encouragement to Mr Jacques
Chirac, whose presidential bid the foreign minister backs against that of
the prime minister.
Clearly, President Mitterrand intends to go on dividing before he stops
ruling.
