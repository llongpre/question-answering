   VICHY WAR-CRIME CHARGE FILED

   The former police chief under France's collaborationist
Vichy government has been charged with crimes against
humanity. Rene Bousquet, 81 years old, was notified of the
charges March 1 and remains free, Charles Libman, a lawyer
for a group that sued Mr. Bousquet, disclosed yesterday.
   Mr. Bousquet, who headed the Vichy national police in
World War II, is accused of deporting 194 Jewish children who
died in Nazi concentration camps. Mr. Bousquet was condemned
in 1949 for his activities under the Nazi occupation of
France, but the decision was reversed. He went on to become a
successful businessman.
   Two others are charged with crimes against humanity: Paul
Touvier, 75, former chief of the Lyon militia, and Maurice
Papon, a former budget minister accused of sharing
responsibility in the arrest and deportation of 1,700 Jews
while serving as top administrator in Bordeaux.
   Should Mr. Bousquet's case go to trial, he would be the
highest-ranking official in the Vichy regime to be tried for
crimes against humanity. The state's legal review of the case
could take at least a year.
                                                                                                       

   OLYMPIC PLATFORM FOR PICASSO?
                                                                                                       

   Barcelona wants to display Pablo Picasso's anti-war
masterpiece "Guernica" when the Spanish city hosts the
Olympics next year. The black-and-white Cubist painting,
housed in a special building in Madrid's Prado art museum,
was painted as a protest against the horrors of Spain's
1936-39 civil war. It was inspired by the bombing of the
Basque town of Guernica.
                                                                                                       

   FIRST WOMAN TO LEAD PROVINCE
                                                                                                       

   British Columbia has appointed Canada's first female
premier, Rita Johnston. Her predecessor, William Vander Zalm,
resigned after a government report found a conflict of
interest in his sale last year of a theme park. Mrs.
Johnston, 55 years old, was first elected to the provincial
legislature in 1983 for the Social Credit Party and has been
minister of municipal affairs and of highways.
                                                                                                       

   SOME KUWAITIS SHRUG OFF CASH
                                                                                                       

   As promised, Kuwait's ruler is offering $1,700 to every
Kuwaiti who stayed in the emirate during its Iraqi
occupation. But in shrugging off the 500-dinar gift, some say
they don't need it, others say it isn't enough, and a few say
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah should offer democracy instead.
One man took the cash only to give it to foreigners living in
his neighborhood who helped Kuwaitis during the occupation.
An estimated 250,000 Kuwaitis are eligible for the emir's
offer.
                                                                                                       

   SAO TOME PRESIDENT INSTALLED
                                                                                                       

   Miguel Trovoada, a former dissident and political
prisoner, was sworn in as the first freely elected president
of Sao Tome and Principe. He said he wants to open the
African island state in the Gulf of Guinea to foreign
investment. The 54-year-old lawyer defeated the incumbent,
Manuel Pinto da Costa, in March 3 elections that completed
the former Portuguese colony's transition to multiparty
democracy. The cocoa-growing islands had been a one-party
state since independence in 1975.
                                                                                                       

   DANES TO GET A PEACE DIVIDEND

   The Danish government said it will cut defense spending by
400 million kroner ($62.4 million) over two years, citing
easing East-West tensions. But the defense chief said it is
too early for any far-reaching disarmament. The military
budget now is 14 billion kroner ($2.19 billion). The plan
eliminates 1,000 jobs, one of six fighter-jet squadrons, and
five armored tank squadrons; delays tank upgrades, and
postpones ship orders.
                                                                                                       

   WAGE OFFERS ARE LOWER IN JAPAN
                                                                                                       

   Major Japanese manufacturers in four large industries have
made wage offers that appear acceptable to their labor
unions, people in the sectors said. The offers to steel,
electrical appliance, auto and shipbuilding workers represent
narrower wage increases than those won last year.
   Japan's labor unions mount a so-called spring offensive
each April in a bid to improve annual contracts, and the rank
and file tend to follow patterns set by the largest
companies.
   Thirty-five steel companies have offered their unions
identical packages to raise pay 4.33%, down from last year's
4.7% increase for the industry. In the appliance industry, 17
companies have offered identical increases of 5.55%, off from
5.93% raises last year. Each of the 11 auto makers is making
its own offer to its union, but of 10 offers so far, the
average is 5.61%, down from 5.99% raises at all 11 companies
last year. Among shipbuilders, the offered boost is 5.26%,
down from 5.45% a year ago.
   Financial markets have speculated that monetary
authorities would peg any changes in monetary policy partly
on the degree of inflationary pressure inherent in this
year's wage settlements.
                                                                                                       

   POSTSCRIPTS . . .
                                                                                                       

   Paris has decided to abolish first-class carriages on the
Metro underground railway, saying the higher-priced ticket is
no longer justified because all train cars are identical. A
generation ago, seats were padded in first class and wooden
in second class. Since 1981, first class has been open to all
during rush hours. . . . The Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra on
Tuesday will be conducted for the first time by an Egyptian,
Taha Nagui, conductor of the Cairo Symphony Orchestra.
