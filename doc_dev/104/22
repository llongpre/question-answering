MR JEAN-MARC Vernes, the French financier, yesterday announced he had
withdrawn from negotiations with Nestle, the Swiss food group, to buy part
of the Vichy mineral water business.
Nestle was last summer instructed by the European Commission to sell a
number of the mineral water brands, including Vichy and Saint Yorre, that it
had acquired in its bruising bid battle for Perrier, one of France's
best-known water companies.
Mr Vernes, chairman of the Vernes bank and the SCI investment concern, had
been discussing the possible purchase of some of the brands under the Vichy
umbrella, together with Mr Raul Gardini, the Italian businessman who is
involved with SCI.
However Mr Vernes said in an interview with La Tribune Desfosses, the French
financial newspaper, that he had halted the negotiations.
He also indicated that he might be interested in investing in some of the
state-controlled companies which may be privatised after the March
legislative elections.
Nestle said yesterday it was continuing discussions with other parties over
the sale of Vichy and Saint Yorre, although it stressed the talks were still
at a preliminary stage.
