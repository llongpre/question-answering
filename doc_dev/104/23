   A dawn raid on a sleepy priory tucked into the old
quarter of Nice ended more than 40 years on the run for France's
last known World War II criminal at large.
   The gaunt, pajama-clad old man taken away last May by police was
Paul Touvier _ alias Lacroix, alias Berthet, alias Gaillard _ the
former head of a pro-Nazi militia unit based in Lyon to hunt down
resistance fighters and Jews.
   Fifty years after war devastated Europe, Touvier's capture has
rewakened terrible memories of France's collaboration with cruel
and genocidal acts of its Nazi conquerers.
   It also spotlights the role of some Roman Catholics _ at first
in the church hierarchy and later among breakaway traditionalists _
in helping Touvier evade the law since 1944.
   If the 74-year-old Touvier lives long enough to face trial _ he
is suffering from prostate cancer _ cartons of his private papers
that he filed and took along everywhere he went during his 44 years
underground will be made public.
   ``The Touvier case will open old wounds because it will put the
militia on trial for the first time'' since immediately after the
Liberation, Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld said in an interview. ``For
the majority of French people, the war is part of the Middle Ages,
so the trial will set the record straight about the militia.''
   Touvier, who worked closely with Lyon Gestapo chief Klaus
Barbie, was arrested at the Liberation, but escaped from prison. He
was twice convicted of war crimes and sentenced to death in
absentia.
   Thanks to persistent lobbying on his behalf by Charles Duquaire,
private secretary to the archibishop of Lyon, Touvier was pardoned
quietly in 1971 by President Georges Pompidou.
   The president justified his action by asking: ``Is it not the
time to throw a veil over the times when the French didn't love
each other, and even killed each other?''
   Most Frenchman answered with a resounding ``No.'' New charges,
not covered by the pardon, were filed and Touvier went back into
hiding, slipping in and out of monasteries and religious retreats
throughout France, Italy and Switzerland _ even walking village
streets dressed in monk's robes.
   Fresh charges of crimes against humanity and an international
arrest warrant were filed in 1981. Touvier is accused of
responsibility for the execution of Jewish hostages and the murder
of Victor Basch, 81-year-old president of the League of Human
Rights, and Basch's wife, Helene.
   The current archbishop of Lyon, Albert Decourtray, decided to
open the local church archives to a panel of prominent lay
historians this fall to determine ``the attitude of the church, its
men and its communities in the Touvier affair.''
   ``I prefer the truth, even if it is unpleasant, to a pleasant
lie, because it is liberating,'' Decourtray said, adding it was
``probable that sanctions would be pronounced against those
clergymen who helped Touvier evade the law.''
   Klarsfeld has warned against confusing the entire church with
the smattering of right-wing Catholic traditionalists who sheltered
Touvier.
   ``We must emphasize the enormous, and sometimes unknown debt
Jews have towards the French Catholic Church,'' Klarsfeld wrote in
a commentary in the daily Le Monde.
   ``If three-quarters of France's Jewish community survived, it
was because of the solidarity and sympathy of the French people and
the churches of France,'' he wrote.
   Touvier was arrested in a dawn raid at the St. Francis priory,
which Nice city officials had made available to the traditionalist
followers of rebel Monsignor Marcel Lefebvre, who was
excommunicated by the Vatican last year.
   Though most reaction to Touvier's capture was favorable, the
leader of the extreme-right National Front, Jean-Marie Le Pen, said
he did not consider ``tracking down an old man a victory for human
rights.''
   ``During the war he belonged to the militia. So what? After 30
years, the wounds should be healed. Touvier did not endanger the
public order,'' Le Pen said.
   If Touvier does stand trial, he would be the first French
collaborator to be tried for crimes against humanity. Barbie,
brought back to France after a long South American exile, was
convicted of crimes against humanity in 1987 and sentenced to life
in prison.
   But prosecutions of other collaborators have dawdled, perhaps
not suprisingly in a country where elected government officials
cooperated with the Nazi occupiers and wrote and enforced
anti-Jewish laws resulting in the deportation and death of some
75,000 Jews.
   Maurice Papon, who was responsible for signing orders to deport
thousands of Jews from Bordeaux while he was secretary-general of
the Gironde prefecture between June 1942 and August 1944, has been
awaiting trial since he was charged with crimes against humanity in
1983.
   After the war, Papon served in many high-profile government
posts, including chief of police and budget minister under
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   Some historians believe evidence implicating other respected
personalities from post-war French society could be lying in dusty
archives, accessible only after long administrative paperwork.
   ``The Papon affair has had a chilling effect on archivists,''
American historian Robert Paxton, author of ``Vichy France,'' said
in a telephone interview.
   ``They may have had their knuckles rapped and they are now
treading lightly, reluctant to make public documents that might
cause problems for prominent public officials,'' Paxton said.
   French scholars, Paxton said, prefer to forge reputations
studying other subjects, ``a reaction, perhaps, to the disagreeable
reality of the Occupation.''
