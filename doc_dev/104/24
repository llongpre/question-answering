question of wartime collaboration

We all have skeletons in our closet. In the case of the people of France,
there are 75,000 of them. That is the estimated number of French Jews
rounded up and sent by their Government to be murdered in Nazi concentration
camps. At least seven more French Jews met a different fate. They are the
people for whose execution Pierre Touvier is now on trial at Versailles.
'Crimes against humanity' is on the charge sheet, and the 78-year-old former
intelligence chief of the Milice, the Vichy regime's pro-Nazi paramilitary
force, is the first Frenchman to be so charged.
You might wonder, as I do, why Touvier is the only Frenchman against whom
such a charge could be levelled.
You might also wonder why Touvier has had to wait 50 years for his trial.
The answer is that he was sheltered throughout the intervening years by
various outposts of the Roman Catholic Church in France - a skeleton in the
cloister, if ever there was one. But the people of France do not, for
understandable reasons, like to dwell on such embarrassing memories. Instead
they prefer to carry on preparing their celebrations for the 50th
anniversary of D-Day in June, and in particular, snub the Germans by not
inviting them to the party.
Last week the mayor of Caen, who had broken ranks by inviting Helmut Kohl,
the German chancellor, to their local celebration of the great Day, was
ordered by Paris to withdraw the invitation.
The resulting spat in the Franco-German relationship fills us in England
with feelings of deep satisfaction.
We have no skeletons in our closet, unless you are going to be fussy and
dredge up the fire-bombing of Dresden. We, thanks principally to Hitler's
decision to open a second front against the Soviet Union, never had to face
outright German invasion. Doubtless, if we had, we would have fought them on
the beaches. I cannot imagine that a British Government would have handed
London over to the enemy, without a shot being fired, in the way the French
did Paris.
But if we had been overrun by the Nazis, would we then have been ruled by an
assiduously collaborationist regime, along Vichy lines? Would we, in other
words, have had our own Touviers? It is interesting how quickly you can
reduce a civilised London dinner party to shouting and walk-outs by
suggesting that this is what would have happened in Britain. I remember my
maternal grandmother, a member of a prominent Jewish family - it owned the J
Lyons food catering business - intimating to me that they would have made
their own cyanide pills to take when the knock on the door came.
I do not think that this was such a lamentable lack of confidence in the
moral strength of the British people: just the same sort of practical
realism that had enabled them to build a great business from street barrows.
Discussions - or rather, ferocious arguments - about what would have
happened to British Jews, usually disintegrate into competing hypotheses.
But, there is no need for that.
Last year, under the 50-year rule, documents were released which showed how
occupied Guernsey collaborated with the Nazi invader's solution to the
Jewish problem. The papers charted British officials' collusion in
identifying three Jewesses who were subsequently deported and perished in
Auschwitz. Last week it was the turn of the Jersey archives to be released.
Most of the papers relating to the period of occupation had been
mysteriously stolen. But those that remained paint a depressingly familiar
pattern, with officials assisting their German governors with the
identification of the Jewish population.
One document, from a British company, reports that: 'As far as the Channel
Islands are concerned, I can definitely state that no Jew, male or female,
is employed by the company, nor had any Jew been so employed since the
Jersey branch was opened.'
Perhaps the company was simply trying to protect its Jewish employees. What
would you have done?
