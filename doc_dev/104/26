FT  04 MAR 93 / Brussels to clear Perrier takeover
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is about to approve the takeover of Perrier, the
French mineral water company, by Nestle, the Swiss foods group, write Andrew
Hill in Brussels and Ian Rodger in Zurich.
Brussels' competition authorities signalled yesterday they were broadly
satisfied with the proposed sale of part of Perrier's assets to the French
beverage company Castel for FFr750m (Pounds 94m).
A formal go-ahead will have to wait until the French government, and the
French town of Thonon-les-Bains have approved Castel as the new operator of
the Vichy and Thonon water sources under their control.
The Commission approved the Nestle-Perrier deal last July after a five month
inquiry, but on condition the rights to certain mineral water brands and
springs were sold to a single buyer.
The Commission wants to encourage a new 'third force' on the French mineral
water market, apart from Nestle and BSN, France's biggest food company.
Commission officials said yesterday they did not think the sale of Thonon
and Vichy would pose particular problems.
Under the original deal with Nestle, Castel would have acquired the rights
to Vichy, Thonon and Saint Yorre, but not Pierval, the fourth brand
specified in the Commission's decision last summer. However, under pressure
from Brussels, Nestle persuaded Castel to buy Pierval as well, and announced
an amended deal last week.
