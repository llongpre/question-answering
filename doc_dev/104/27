A LONE gunman, described as a failed author desperate for world fame,
yesterday killed France's wartime Vichy regime police chief, Mr Rene
Bousquet, who deported thousands of French Jews to Nazi death camps in 1942,
Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Bousquet, a senior banker after the war who lived untroubled until 1979
when documents about his past began to emerge. was shot at his home in the
elegant 16th district of Paris.
Mr Bousquet, aged 84, was charged with crimes against humanity in 1991 for
the deportation of Jewish children to the camps. The court of appeal had
been due to decide within weeks whether to send him for trial.
French Jewish leaders who campaigned to bring him to justice condemned the
assassination, saying it deprived France of a chance to establish the truth
about its collaborationist past.
