One of France's leading "revisionist" historians, who claims the Holocaust 
never took place, was severely beaten Saturday by three youths said to belong 
to a group called "The Sons of the Memory of the Jews," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Faurisson, 60, was ambushed by the youths while walking his dog in a 
park in Vichy. The trio repeatedly kicked and punched Faurisson, breaking his 
jaw, then ran off, a police report said. 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson was admitted to a Vichy hospital, then transferred to a hospital in 
the nearby city of Clermont-Ferrand. 
</P>
<P>
French radio said the attack was claimed by the previously unknown group, which 
said in a statement that "Faurisson is the first but will not be the last." 
</P>
<P>
"Let those who deny the Shoah (Holocaust) beware," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The same group was named as responsible for the attack in a telephone call to a 
news agency. 
</P>
<P>
"This individual (Faurisson) is the origin of the Carmel of Auschwitz affair 
that is dividing gravely the Jewish and Catholic communities," the caller said. 
</P>
<P>
The reference was to the dispute over the presence of a Carmelite convent at 
the World War II Nazi death camp in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
Faurisson is one of the leading French members of a "revisionist" school of 
history that says there is no evidence that 6 million Jews were killed in Nazi 
gas chambers during the war.
