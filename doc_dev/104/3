   France observed the 50th anniversary of the
formation of the collaborationist Vichy government Tuesday and
honored the Parliament members who opposed Marshal Philippe
Petain's ascension to power.
   Petain, a grandfatherly World War I hero, was installed as
all-powerful leader of the Vichy regime by a 569-80 vote on July
10, 1940.
   Three of the legislators who voted ``no'' survive, and two
attended commemorations at Vichy's Grand Casino, where the vote was
taken. Maurice Montel, 90, and Emile Fouchard, 88, were joined by
Parliamentary Affairs Minister Jean Poperen.
   Poperen said the 80 lawmakers, acting ``with lucidity and
courage, against all the appearances and the evidence of the
moment, have earned the eternal recognition of the nation.''
   Vichy's mayor, Claude Malhuret, described the votes against
Petain as ``one of the first acts of resistance in our country.''
   Malhuret also said France should be vigilant in countering a
resurgence of racist and anti-Semitic rhetoric ``such as we heard
before the war.''
   Petain, who signed an armistice with the Germans on June 22, was
84 at the time, but widely respected across France. He was
convinced Germany would win the war and that France had no
alternative but to cooperate with Hitler.
   France's government, including Parliament members, had fled from
Paris as German forces approached, going first to Tours on June 10,
then to Bordeaux on June 14 and two weeks later to Vichy, a
tranquil health spa.
   On July 10, the parliamentary majority adopted a text which
said: ``The National Assembly gives all power to the government of
the Republic, under the authority and the signature of Marshal
Petain, for the purpose of promoting a new constitution of the
French state.''
   Of the 80 legislators who opposed Petain, 31 were incarcerated
or put under house arrest during the war, two were killed and five
died in captivity.
   Since the war, Vichy has struggled to live down its association
with Nazi collaboration.
   In the 1930s, the town ranked as France's No. 1 mineral springs
resort. Now it ranks 14th, and unemployment in the town of 30,500
is estimated at 15 percent.
   Malhuret described as ``irritating'' the link between Vichy and
the collaborationists.
   ``If the town of Vichy was partly responsible, it would be less
irritating,'' he told the French news agency Agence France-Presse.
``But that isn't the case. Nobody in Vichy went out in search of
the government and the assembly.''
   The Vichy government received little in return for its
collaboration, exporting goods and labor to Germany in exchange for
the privilege of running day-to-day administrative affairs. Only
two-fifths of France was under Vichy's jurisdiction, the rest was
occupied territory.
   In August 1944, as Allied forces swept through France, Petain
fled Vichy and was arrested, then was allowed to leave for
Switzerland.
   He returned voluntarily to France in April 1945, was tried for
treason and sentenced to death. Charles De Gaulle commuted the
sentence to life imprisonment and Petain died in 1951 on the Isle
of Yeu, off France's Atlantic coast.
   In Paris, officials of the French Communist Party on Tuesday
celebrated the 50th anniversary of an appeal by the outlawed
Communist underground for resistance against Petain.
   Communist legislator Andre Lajoinie said the men who isssud the
appeal represented ``the first resistance base on national
territory.'' A radio appeal for Frenchmen to resist the Nazis had
been broadcast from London on June 18 by De Gaulle.
