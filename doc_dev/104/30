   The little town of Le Chambon-Sur-Lignon now has a
scroll of honor, and 30 villagers have medals, a half-century after
they and their neighbors saved 5,000 Jews from Nazi persecution.
   Israeli Ambassador Ovadia Soafer presented the Medals of
Righteousness to townspeople who risked their lives as they
sheltered Jews on the run from 1940 through 1944.
   ``You gave a lesson of courage and dignity, but also a political
lesson which statesmen of the entire world should retain and apply
as a rule of conduct - don't give in to threats, don't let youself
be intimidated,'' Soafer said at Sunday's ceremony.
   The entire town, in addition to its scroll, will be honored Oct.
22 at the Yad Vashem holocaust memorial in Jerusalem.
   It is the first community in France to be recognized
collectively by the Yad Vashem institute, which customarily honors
individual non-Jews who took risks on behalf of Jews during World
War II.
   Marie Brottes, 84, said she and her neighbors, mostly poor
Protestant peasants, simply did what the Bible advised.
   ``You had to see those poor Jews who arrived with nothing - no
clothes, no possessions, no family. We helped them because it's
written in the Gospel. That's what gave us the courage and strength
to do what we did,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Just 11 weeks after France fell to the Germans, the
collaborationist Vichy government passed laws discriminating
against Jews. By 1945, 80,000 Jews had been deported to Nazi death
camps. Only 2,500 returned.
   Sheltering mainly children at first, the people of Le Chambon
turned no one away, betrayed no one, attempted to convert no one.
   Mrs. Brottes and other villagers recall the wartime events in
``The Weapons of the Spirit,'' a documentary film about how,
through word of mouth, the quiet, mountain community in central
France became a place of refuge for 5,000 Jews.
   The 90-minute film, shown in France for the first time last
week, was screened in Le Chambon before an audience of rescuers and
survivors, many never reunited before.
   ``Le Chambon-sur-Lignon was like paradise, a little corner of
the world that allowed us to survive,'' said Joseph Atlas, 14 when
he reached Le Chambon after a brief period at an internment camp.
   Atlas, now a 64-year-old engineer, said residents might not
understand why many Jews took so long returning to the village to
express thanks.
   ``At the end of the war, when we discovered the full extent of
the Holocaust, we had to rebuild ourselves psychologically,'' he
said.
   Atlas praised the film's accuracy, but said it brought back
troubling memories.
   The film is the work of Pierre Sauvage, born in 1944 to Jews who
took refuge in Le Chambon.
   Sauvage says Le Chambon - inspired by its impassioned pastor,
Andre Trocme - was swept up in a conspiracy of goodness.
   ``Goodness was contagious. It was a situation in which it was
almost harder to do evil than good,'' said Sauvage, who is based in
Los Angeles and has worked for PBS in the United States.
   The villagers are hardly inclined to see themselves as heroes.
   ``They simply thought what they did was normal, and they looked
at me as though my questions were stupid,'' Sauvage said.
   Madga Trocme, 89, widow of Pastor Trocme, said the villagers
acted because they knew in their hearts ``anything else would have
been a sin.''
   ``They acted in the memory of their Huguenot tradition and the
persecution they experienced over the centuries,'' she said after
seing the film. ``It was war, everybody was in danger. We did what
we did because it had to be done.''
