<LEADPARA>  VICHY SPRINGS, a resort that used to cater to the likes of Mark Twain, Robert
Louis Stevenson, Teddy Roosevelt and Jack London, now is happily catering to
nature lovers, hikers and mountain bikers.;    Founded in 1854, its draw was
the purportedly curative and restorative waters bubbling up from the earth.
The natural champagne effervescence of the water gave rise to the name Vichy
Springs, after the famous springs in France.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Vichy Springs Resort fell on hard times and into disrepair until Gilbert
and Marjorie Ashoff purchased and restored the property. Officially open just
two years, the "new" resort is an outdoor lover's paradise.;    Tucked into
the east foothills of Ukiah, only three hours north of San Jose, the resort
boasts 700 acres of wild land laced with over 10 miles of trails and dirt
roads suitable for wandering and mountain biking.;    "Mountain bikers and
hikers are encouraged to use the many game trails we have crisscrossing the
hills, as well as the fire roads on our property and the adjacent Bureau of
Land Management land," says Gilbert Ashoff.;    I took Ashoff at his word and
headed out on my bike for a ride he recommended. The first three miles or so
climbed steeply with a few sharp drops. It was a 3,000-foot, mind-bending
ascent finding me sometimes on my bike, sometimes beside it, and once under
it.;    Still, the views were spectacular, with Lake Mendocino and the Ukiah
valley spread out beneath my feet. This is not a ride for beginners.;    At
the top, fire roads fanned out in every direction inviting exploration into
the BLM-managed Cow Mountain Recreation Area. According to Ashoff, the roads
into the BLM interior are relatively smooth and rolling with minimal elevation
gain and loss. Time did not permit further wandering so I headed back.;    The
descent was fast and furious with many whoop-dee-doos, ruts and potholes. I
can't remember when I last had such fun riding a mountain bike. Unfortunately,
because I was relying on verbal directions, I zigged when I should have zagged
and ended in a swampy area with no more road.;    Faced with the choice of
climbing part way up what I had just raced down, I chose to point my wheel
downhill and plow through the underbrush until I found another road -- I
hoped.;    This is not a recommended choice and Ashoff is working on a map and
trail signs that will be available to help visitors stay on the right track.; 
  After thrashing through hundreds of yards of poison oak I popped out on the
road I should have been on in the first place. This brought me quickly to a
stream with a pretty meadow and evidence of an old cinnabar mining operation.
From here it was a short jaunt over a cow-rutted road back to the resort.;   
Ashoff says cows no longer will be allowed on the property when the roads are
wet so future riders can enjoy a smooth road.;    Slipping into a 90 degree
champagne mineral water bath under a crystal clear sky and warm sun, with
Grizzly Creek rushing by below and birds singing above, seemed almost surreal.
It was a delightful finish to the day.;    There is a nearby cabin for Swedish
massages and herbal facials, and other guests who indulged raved about the
pampering. The rate for this one to one-and-a-half hour luxury is $45 to $65.;
   If it is hiking that you crave, there is plenty to be had. By following the
creek, sometimes beside it, sometimes in it, you come to a waterfall and
swimming hole. The creek is lined with poison oak so plan to get your feet wet
and wade when necessary.;    An old cinnabar mine shaft is within an hour and
a half moderate hiking that will find you wandering over rolling hills, down
to the stream and a pretty meadow, and then up the side of a heavily-treed
hill.;    Closer to the resort there are any number of possibilities for an
easy ramble or picnic.;    Vichy Springs Resort is a historical landmark. The
two cottages for overnight guests, both with kitchens, are listed as the
oldest standing structures in Mendocino County. There also are 12 guests rooms
with private baths located in a long, ranch-style building.;  IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED; The cottages are $125 for one bedroom and $135 for two bedrooms.
The guest rooms are $65 for a single and $95 for a double. Rates include a
continental breakfast, use of the mineral baths, pool, hot tub and grounds. A
$20 day-use fee entitles you to use the grounds and the facilities if you
choose not to stay overnight.;    For reservations write or call Vichy Springs
Resort, 2605 Vichy Springs Rd., Ukiah, 95482; (707) 462-9515.  </TEXT>
