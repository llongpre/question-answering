   Nazi collaborator Jean Leguay, who allegedly helped
organize the roundup of 12,884 Jews deported from France to
concentration camps, died Saturday in a Paris hospital at age 79.
   Leguay was a senior police official in the Vichy government,
which collaborated with the Nazis during their Wold War II
occupation of France.
   In 1979, he was charged for crimes against humanity for his role
in the July 1942 roundup of the Jews. A second set of charges, filed
in 1986, involved the deportation of 444 Jews from Paris in August
1942. Neither set of charges ever came to trial.

   Former West Virginia Gov. Okey L. Patteson
died Monday after a short illness at age 90.
   Patteson was a double amputee, having lost both legs as a result
of a hunting accident in 1932. He wore artificial legs.
   Patteson grew up in Mount Hope, where he served in a number of
local elective posts. The Democrat moved into statewide politics by
managing the successful 1944 gubernatorial campaign of Clarence W.
Meadows, then served as Meadows' executive assistant until he
resigned in 1948 to run for governor himself.
   West Virginia governors could not succeed themselves at the time,
and Patteson left office in 1953. He later was general manager of
the West Virginia Turnpike Commission and a member of the Board of
Regents of the state's universities and colleges.
