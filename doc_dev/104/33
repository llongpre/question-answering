RELATIONS between Mr Francois Mitterrand and France's governing Socialist
party have sunk to an all-time low in the past few weeks as the president
prepares for life after the Socialist administration.
Both sides have increasingly distanced themselves from each other on a whole
range of issues, ever since the traumatically close referendum on European
union in September, called by Mr Mitterrand against the advice of several
senior Socialists.
What are they up to? Mr Mitterrand is seen by the French press as trying to
bolster his personal power to make life difficult for the conservatives, who
are on course for a landslide victory in the legislative elections on March
21 and 28.
The Socialists, meanwhile, are said to be resigned to growing apart from an
ailing and unpopular president, who might not last the course until the end
of his mandate in spring 1995.
While nobody in France is as clever as Mr Mitterrand in dividing the
right-wing opposition, politicians on both sides suspect he is equally keen
on tripping up his own party. Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of the RPR
conservative party, dubbed Mr Mitterrand as 'the inventor of permanent civil
war as a method of government,' in a recent newspaper interview.
Other critics believe Mr Mitterrand wants to snub both sides of French
politics at once to reflect voters' general dissatisfaction with the
political class, a tactic reminiscent of General de Gaulle's attempts to
strike an intimate relationship with the electorate over the head of
parliament.
The latest and most dramatic sign of the split between Mr Mitterrand and his
troops came with his recent call for a parliamentary high court inquiry into
former Socialist ministers' part in a scandal over the distribution of blood
infected with the HIV virus. If the case gets through its complex
administrative process, which it easily could, the chief defendant some time
early next year would be none other than Mr Laurent Fabius, the party first
secretary, until recently regarded as the president's chosen dauphin.
The noose tightened yesterday when the standing committee of the senate, the
upper house of parliament, approved manslaughter and fraud charges - the
first step to a trial - against Mr Fabius and two other former Socialist
ministers, Mrs Georgina Dufoix and Mr Edmond Herve.
All three deny the charges and say they look forward to this chance to clear
their names against what they say is a political campaign by the
conservative-dominated senate. They have the clear support of all senior
Socialists except for Mr Mitterrand, who has said non-committally that the
constitution must do its work.
Asked on television whether he felt betrayed, Mr Fabius said he would rather
keep his thoughts to himself. A leading Fabius supporter, Senator Daniel
Percheron, was more blunt. 'Mitterrand has led us to understand that we are
alone and responsible for ourselves,' he said.
The blood scandal is only the most dramatic of a series of clashes between
the president and his party.
Other examples include Socialist MPs' recent refusal to accept Mr
Mitterrand's plans to ban business donations to political parties, and the
president's encouragement of Generation Ecologie, led by a former
environment minister in the Socialist government, which two weeks ago turned
its back on the Socialists by forming an electoral pact with France's other
main ecology party, the Verts.
Mr Mitterrand, meanwhile, enraged his party on Armistice Day by sending a
wreath to the grave of Marshal Philippe Petain, reviled by many French
people for collaborating with Germany as leader of the Vichy regime during
the second world war.
The president has discreetly done this every Armistice Day for the past
seven years without attracting a row, as a gesture likely to appeal to a
minority of older right-wing voters who remember Petain as a hero of the
first world war.
But this time the Socialist party was not prepared to turn a blind eye to
what Mr Henri Emmanuelli, speaker of the parliament, condemned as an
'incomprehensible' gesture. However, Mr Mitterrand rarely acts without a
clear motive, even if he is the only one to understand it at the time.
