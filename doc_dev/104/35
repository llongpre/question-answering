<HEAD>Former De Gaulle Minister Jacques Soustelle Dies at 78</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacques Soustelle, a former Cabinet minister who
clashed with Gen. Charles de Gaulle over the Algerian conflict,
died today in the suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, the Academie
Francaise announced. He was 78.
   A distinguished anthropologist noted for his study of
pre-Colombian culture, Soustelle was named to the prestigious
Academie in 1983. The organization's terse statement announcing his
death did not give a cause of death or list survivors.
   Born in Montpellier, Soustelle studied letters at the Ecole
Normale Superieure and married Georgette Fagot in 1931. They made
several scientific missions to Central America during the 1930s.
   Strongly opposed to fascism, Soustelle was among the first to
rally to de Gaulle's appeal on June 18, 1940 from London to fight
the Vichy government that collaborated with Nazi Germany.
   After the liberation of France in 1944, Soustelle worked as
minister of information and later minister of colonies. He served
as governor of Algeria in 1955-56 during the outbreak of the war
for independence.
   De Gaulle returned to power in 1958 as the Algerian war
threatened to tear France apart. Soustelle again became minister of
information and later a deputy foreign minister.
   The two men had a falling out when de Gaulle made clear his
intention to grant independence to the North African country.
Soustelle resigned, saying he could not ``make a deal with
cutthroats.''
   Soustelle left France in 1961 and was charged Sept. 22, 1962
with ``attempts against the state.'' The same year, renegade army
officers tried to assassinate de Gaulle for giving Algeria
independence.
   Soustelle lived in exile until 1968, when he returned to France
under a general amnesty and resumed his academic and political
career. The Academie made him a member June 2, 1983 for his studies
of ancient American culture, outlined in such books as ``Life of
the Aztecs'' and ``The Maya Civilization.''
   Funeral arrangements were not announced.
