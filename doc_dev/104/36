  [Text] Paris, March 16 (AFP) -- The head of France's 
far-right National Front party, Jean-Marie Le Pen, on Wednesday 
[16 March] criticized the trial of wartime Nazi collaborator 
Paul Touvier as "unnecessary" and his alleged crime "a detail of 
the past." 
  Touvier, whose trial starts Thursday in Versailles, west of 
Paris, will be the first French national to be tried for crimes 
against humanity. He is accused of ordering the reprisal 
execution of seven Jewish hostages on June 29, 1944 when he was 
intelligence chief of the pro-Nazi French militia in the eastern 
city of Lyon. 
  "It strikes me as sad that 50 years after the war we still 
cannot pardon our former German adversary and that we are trying 
to find in an 80-year-old man the responsibility that might 
really belong to the Vichy regime, but especially also to the 
governments that prepared the build-up to the war and that lost 
the war," he said on French radio. (Touvier is 79). 
  "France has enough other problems than to dig up details of 
its past," Le Pen said. 
  Le Pen, known for his anti-Semitism, once described Hitler's 
"final solution" -- the mass extermination of Jews -- as "a 
point of detail of history." 
  The Touvier case will throw the spotlight on wartime French 
collaboration with the Germans -- still a sensitive subject in 
France -- and also raise questions about the role of Roman 
Catholic clergy who sheltered and funded Touvier for some 45 
years.
