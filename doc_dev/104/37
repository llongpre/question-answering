   An ex-Cabinet minister charged nearly eight years
ago with crimes against humanity during the Nazi occupation told a
court Tuesday that his reputation had been tarnished by the
slow-moving judicial process.
   Maurice Papon, 80, spoke at the opening of a defamation
proceeding he initiated against a news magazine, saying it was his
only way to seek justice.
   He was charged in January 1983 with crimes he allegedly
committed between 1942-44 as a senior police official in the
Bordeaux region. The alleged offenses include the deportation of
1,960 Jews to death camps.
   The 1983 charges against Papon are still pending. He has not
been brought to trial, in part because some potential evidence was
thrown out on a technicality in 1987.
   Papon has accused the leftist Le Nouvel Observateur and two
reporters of defamation and improperly divulging court documents in
an article published in June that referred to him as a ``French
accomplice of genocide.''
   ``It is intolerable that a state of law lets things drag on in
this way,'' he said in a 25-minute statement opening the trial.
``Enough is enough.''
   Papon, budget minister under former President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, wants $200,000 in damages.
   Papon's decision to take the legal initiative coincides with
assertions by lawyers and human rights activists that his case and
two others have been stalled or dragged out because of reluctance
in ``the highest levels of government'' to expose French complicity
in the Holocaust during World War II.
   Yves Jouffa, president of the French League of Human Rights,
called the three men members of an ``establishment ... that does
not want to see its dirty laundry washed in public.''
   The others are Rene Bousquet, 81, who headed the national police
of the collaborationist Vichy government and later was Paris police
chief, and Paul Touvier, 75, a militia leader who worked closely
with Gestapo chief Klaus Barbie in Lyon. He was arrested in May
1989 at a priory in Nice.
   After the war, Papon had a successful career as a high-ranking
civil servant. In 1981 the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine
disclosed his wartime activities. Legal proceedings began, and he
left public life.
   ``You can transplant onto me that I was the symbol of an
administration, a regime, a judicial system ... (that) make all of
France the co-author of a genocide,'' Papon told the court, saying
he was the object of a judicial machination.
   ``My dossier must remain open to put into the heads of all
Frenchmen that they all were collaborators, all accomplices to
genocide.''
   Claude Perdriel, director of Le Nouvel Observateur, said his
magazine was not trying to judge Papon, ``but we have a duty not to
make a practice of forgetfulness.''
   Journalists Serge Raffy and Marie-France Etchegoin described
their research as ``long and prudent.''
   The trial was to last two days.
