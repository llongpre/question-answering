   Novelist Regine Deforges plagiarized the classic
``Gone with the Wind'' for her best-seller ``The Blue Bicycle,'' a
court ruled Wednesday, ordering her and her publisher to pay
Margaret Mitchell's heirs $333,000 in damages and interest.
   The American Trust Co. Bank, which holds the world rights to
``Gone with the Wind,'' had sought $833,000 from Ms. Deforges and
her publisher, Editions Ramsay.
   Ramsay President Franck Spengler said the company and Ms.
Deforges would appeal. The novelist was in West Germany and
unavailable for comment, he said.
   ``We feel we're innocent,'' Spengler said in an interview.
   ``The books are both great novels but they are very different,
and so are their heroines. By nature, Lea is an optimist, and
Scarlett is more Anglo-Saxon, hard-driving, determined and
power-hungry.
   ``Let's put it this way: `The Blue Bicycle' is a historical
novel smattered with psychology and emotion while `Gone With the
Wind' is a pyschological novel cloaked with history,'' he said.
   In a judgment issued by Judge Nicole Antoine, the court
concluded ``The Blue Bicycle'' constituted an ``illicit
reproduction'' of ``Gone with the Wind.''
   ``Based on a comparative study of the two works, it is clear
that what Regine Deforges borrowed from Margaret Mitchell's work
and incorporated into `The Blue Bicycle' is perfectly identifiable
and relates to the most important elements of Ms. Mitchell's
novel,'' the statement said.
   The court said Ms. Deforges copied the ``general intrigue, plot
development and narrative progression, the physical and
psychological characteristics of the major figures, the
relationships between the characters, several secondary characters,
a large number of characteristic situations, the composition and
expression of numerous scenes and key dramatic moments'' of ``Gone
with the Wind.''
   There are similarities. ``The Blue Bicycle,'' which has sold
millions of copies since it was published in 1983 as the first part
of a trilogy, is set during the Nazi occupation of France.
   Its heroine, Lea Delmas, is the beautiful, headstrong daughter
of a southern vintner. Like Scarlett O'Hara, her carefree youth is
interrupted by the horrors of war.
   The opening scenes of garden parties, pretty dresses and
breathless suitors are reminiscent of the American South. And
France, like the United States in the Civil War, is divided.
Pro-Vichy Petainists condemn Charles de Gaulle's freedom fighters.
Collaborators and militia men hunt down Jews and resistance.
   Lea sides with the underground, roaming the Bordelais
countryside on her blue bicycle carrying secret messages.
   Like Scarlett, Lea wants the one man she cannot have. Laurent
d'Argilat has married the sweet, fragile and morally upright
Camille, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Melanie.
   Deforges' French-style Rhett Butler _ Francois Tavernier _ is a
swarthy, cigar-smoking rogue who miraculously turns up whenever Lea
needs him.
   The case has been long and complicated because there are few
precedents. French law forbids plagiarism, but it does allow
pastiche, a centuries-old literary form defined as a ``humorous''
take-off or remake of a recognizable original text.
   Ms. Mitchell's heirs saw nothing funny about ``The Blue
Bicycle,'' despite Ms. Deforges repeated assertions that her novel
was meant as a pastiche.
   ``I know what plagiarism is and it's a very bad thing,'' Ms.
Degorges said when the case went to court two years ago. ``From the
beginning `The Blue Bicycle' was intended to be a pastiche. I never
said it was supposed to be anything else.''
   The court rejected her argument, saying the differences between
the two works were ``undeniably secondary and inoperative given the
extent of their similarities.''
