   President Francois Mitterrand has distanced himself
from the modern French Socialist Party he founded and projected a
new centrist image in his effort to defeat conservative Premier
Jacques Chirac in the May 8 runoff.
   Mitterrand is very much an insider in French politics despite
his leftist label. The bald, avuncular incumbent is a veteran of
four presidential elections, has held many Cabinet posts and enjoys
one of the highest status symbols in French society as a former
fighter in the World War II resistance.
   Mitterrand, 71, was first elected May 10, 1981, in a Socialist
tidal wave that ousted center-right President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing. A month later, the same tide pushed out conservatives
and centrists who had held power in the National Assembly for 23
years.
   Mitterrand also has known presidential defeat. He was beaten by
Gen. Charles de Gaulle in 1965 and by Giscard in 1974.
   But from 1981 to 1986, Mitterrand and his Socialists wielded
political control in France.
   That ended in the March 1986 legislative elections, when voters
returned rightists to power in the National Assembly, creating for
two years what the French call ``cohabitation.''
   The Socialists' early free-spending policies were abruptly
reversed and stiff austerity measures instituted. High unemployment
also dragged down the president's popularity to as low as 27
percent at midterm.
   With the Socialist legislative defeat in 1986, Mitterrand began
to take on a new face.
   He slipped into the role of elder statesman, developing an image
as the wise grandfather above the day-to-day battles of governing.
He distanced himself from his party, abandoned revolutionary
rhetoric, and began to reach out to the political center.
   His popularity soared again, consistently reaching an approval
rate of 55 percent or more.
   Mitterrand was born Oct. 26, 1916, in Jarnac in western France.
He earned degrees in law and letters in Paris. He was drafted in
1938 and shot and captured during the German invasion of May 1940.
   Escaping from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany, he returned to
France. The Germans were occupying the Vichy zone of France, and
Mitterrand helped create a resistance network.
   His career-long feud with de Gaulle began during the war when
Mitterrand refused to merge his resistance group with de Gaulle's.
   It was also during his resistance days that he met Danielle
Gouze, whom he married in 1944 shortly after the liberation.
   During the chaotic post-war Fourth Republic, Mitterrand held 11
Cabinet posts, including interior and justice minister.
   In the early 1970s, Mitterrand took the moribund Socialist Party
and built it into a major force. But the Union of the Left he
forged with the Communists fell apart in 1977.
   It was not until the final days of the 1981 presidential
election that the two major leftist parties again joined to defeat
Giscard and oust the conservatives.
   Mitterrand shocked much of the West when he brought Communists
into his government. But that new union lasted only until 1984 when
the Communists pulled out in a dispute over economic policy.
