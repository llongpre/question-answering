Revelations that President Francois Mitterrand of France had murky links
with the right wing before, during and after the second world war have sent
the French political class into a buzz of shock and horror. Socialists are
dismayed that this latest blow to the reputation of their one-time leader
will further contaminate their own damaged credibility. But not even his
rightwing critics have crowed too loudly, for no political clan is quite
comfortable when the Vichy era is under discussion.
That is the point of this controversy: it is not what it reveals about the
dubious political debut of Francois Mitterrand, but what it reveals about
the feelings of the French today towards that inglorious chapter of their
history. They still have difficulty facing up to what happened between the
fall of France in 1940 and the liberation of Paris in 1944, when the Vichy
government of Marshal Petain submitted to the Nazi victors.
Every so often old wounds are reopened by a new investigation, and each time
the French react with consternation, as if they had never heard of that
traumatic era. Then the shock dies away, and the unacceptable past is again
buried.
So it is with the new book by Pierre Pean, Une Jeunesse Francaise*. It
provides the fullest account yet of Mitterrand's early career, with many
previously unpublished details. But most of the story has long been known:
that Mitterrand came from a conservative, bourgeois background, and started
his political career far to the right of centre; that before joining the
Resistance he worked for the Petain government, and was awarded the top
Vichy decoration, the 'Francisque'; and that he remained right of centre
after the war.
What is most disturbing about the book is not mainly what it reveals about
Mitterrand then, but what it reveals about Mitterrand now. Pean clears him
of any anti-semitism under Vichy; but it is dismaying that today Mitterrand
should still be pretending that he did not then know about Vichy's
anti-semitic laws, even though they led to the deportation of thousands of
Jews to German extermination camps.
Given his bourgeois, provincial background in the unstable years before the
war, it is not surprising that Mitterrand should have flirted as a young man
with the far right; but the fact that his friends continued to include
people from the far right, not just after the war but into the 1980s, will
reinforce his opponents' conviction that Mitterrand has few political
principles.
Perhaps the bottom line is that the president refuses to accept France's
historical and political responsibility for the debacle of 1940-44. As far
as he is concerned, Vichy was a different regime, and nothing to do with the
republic - in fact, nothing to do with us today. It is as if Vichy were an
accident, without organic origins in French political history, for which no
one was responsible.
It is in such terms that the French have repeatedly refused to accept shared
responsibility for their history. Throughout the political instability of
the 19th century, each succeeding regime was permanently under attack in
terms of its essential legitimacy; and the rightwing tradition which
rejected the legitimacy of republican democracy eventually erupted in the
anti-semitism of the Dreyfus case in 1894, when the Jewish army officer was
falsely accused of spying for Germany.
The Petain regime was no doubt exceptional; it was not an accident. Like the
nationalism of the late 19th century, it was a reaction to humiliating
defeat by the Germans. The French have since tried to exorcise it as
illegitimate; but unless they find some way of accepting collective
responsibility for it, the struggles between rival concepts of political
legitimacy will rage on, threatening instability.
Throughout the 1950s, de Gaulle denounced the illegitimacy of the Fourth
Republic, of which Mitterrand was a leading figure; throughout the 1960s,
Mitterrand denounced the illegitimacy of de Gaulle and the Fifth Republic;
and throughout the past 14 years the Gaullists have denounced the
illegitimacy of President Mitterrand.
This process is gathering momentum once more, in the run-up to next spring's
presidential election. The conservatives ought to win that election easily.
Yet they are split on ancestrally visceral grounds, and could throw it all
away.
If they were to unite behind the candidacy of Prime Minister Edouard
Balladur, he would surely win. But it seems more likely that there will be
up to six rival candidates.
Personal ambition is not the only factor. Jacques Chirac, leader of the
Gaullist party, has been trying and failing to be president since 1981, and
he will not give way now. But the undertow of the Chirac-Balladur struggle
is political legitimacy. Chirac has as few political principles as anyone;
but his claim to legitimacy and the loyalty of his party is that he is an
inheritor of genuine Gaullism, while Balladur is merely a modernising
conservative.
In 1988, Chirac conducted his presidential campaign as farce. He frenziedly
paced up and down, calling on President Mitterrand to come out and fight.
Naturally, Mitterrand waited until Chirac had worn himself out, and then
took him to the cleaners.
Today Chirac is again frenziedly pacing up and down, calling for the
election to begin; once again he is likely to wear himself out - and split
the Gaullist party in two.
This intra-conservative struggle should be interesting and possibly
entertaining. We should remember that its historic roots pass through the
unexorcised trauma of Vichy.
