   Socialist President Francois Mitterrand has been a
prominent face on the French left since the end of World War II,
but in recent years he has moved markedly to the political center.
   His first two years in office, 1981-83, involved implementation
of long-held Socialist ideas and were largely a failure. The
radical philosophy of ``rupture with capitalism'' foundered on the
rocks of economic reality.
   After trying to spend their way to prosperity, the Socialists
succeeded only in running up the national debt without being able
to stop runaway unemployment. In the face of a growing crisis, the
government was forced to reverse course and institute austerity.
   When the right ousted the Socialists from control of the
National Assembly in March 1986, Mitterrand needed to appeal to a
wider electorate if he was to have any hope of re-election.
   Ironically, after Mitterrand's popularity had fallen to historic
lows at mid-term, it soared after the right regained control of
Parliament, leaving him with little real power in domestic affairs.
   The French seemed to like the balance of power. Mitterrand, 71,
quickly assumed the role of the wise grandfather, referred to
affectionately by many as ``Tonton,'' a child's term for ``uncle.''
   Mitterrand was first elected May 10, 1981, in a Socialist tidal
wave that ousted center-right President Valery Giscard d'Estaing
and then, a month later, the conservatives and centrists who had
held power in the National Assembly for 23 years.
   The founder of the modern French Socialist Party, Mitterrand has
now made four presidential races. He was defeated by Charles de
Gaulle in 1965 and by Giscard in 1974.
   Mitterrand was born Oct. 26, 1916 in Jarnac in western France.
He earned degrees in law and letters in Paris. He was drafted in
1938, and during the German invasion of May 1940 was shot and
captured.
   He escaped from a POW camp in Germany and returned to France.
After the occupation of the Vichy zone by the Germans, he created a
Resistance network. His career-long feud with Gen. Charles de
Gaulle began during the war when Mitterrand refused to join his
Resistance group with de Gaulle's.
   It was during his Resistance days that he met Danielle Gouze,
whom he married in 1944 shortly after the liberation.
   During the chaotic postwar Fourth Republic, Mitterrand held 11
Cabinet posts, including interior and justice minister.
   In the early 1970s, Mitterrand took the moribund Socialist Party
and built it into a major force. But the Union of the Left he
forged with the Communists fell apart in 1977.
   It was not until the final days of the 1981 presidential
election that the two major leftist parties again joined to defeat
Giscard and oust the conservatives.
   Mitterrand shocked much of the West when he brought the
Communists into his government. But that union only lasted three
years, until 1984, when the Communists pulled out in a dispute over
economic policy.
