   Warner-Lambert Co., Morris Plains, N.J., said it agreed to buy the French candy maker Societe Nouvelle des Pastilles de Vichy, a unit of Source Perrier S.A., the mineral-water producer. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   Warner-Lambert, a consumer-products and health-care company, already has several candy and gum brands, including Pom Poms and Charleston Chew, acquired from RJR Nabisco Inc. earlier this year, and Trident and Dentyne gums. 

   Acquiring Pastilles de Vichy, which had about $10 million of sales in 1987, would give Warner-Lambert entry into the French candy market, a spokesman said. 
Warner-Lambert expects to close the transaction, subject to French government clearance, in the third quarter.
