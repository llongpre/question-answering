   Twenty-eight French masterpieces seized by the
Nazis during World War II, including paintings by Monet, Renoir and
Gauguin, have been found in a cupboard at a Berlin museum, a news
magazine reported Thursday.
   This week's cover story in L'Express described how the works -
seized from private citizens between 1942-1944 - have been locked
away since 1972, their existence known to only a handful of people.
   According to the magazine, the Department of French National
Museums learned the works existed in 1975, but ``was not interested
because the works did not come from national collections.''
   ``Never did the prestigious department think of consulting its
experts or glancing through the catalogues of the artists in
question,'' l'Express wrote.
   The paintings included Claude Monet's ``Route, Effet d'Hiver.
Soleil Couchant (Road, Effect. Sunset);'' Eugene Delacroix's
``Jeune Homme (Young Man);'' Auguste Renoir's ``Coco Ecrivant (Coco
Writing);'' and Paul Gauguin's ``La Falaise (The Cliff).'' They
were examined by l'Express reporters who said they were in
excellent condition.
   Sylvie Poujade, a French museum spokeswoman, told The Associated
Press her department learned of the paintings' existence a month
ago, when contacted by l'Express reporters.
   ``We searched our archives and did not find proof that the
department had ever received a list of works from Berlin,'' Ms.
Poujade said.
   Ms. Poujade said that French museums are considered
``depositories of state property which they are expected to
conseve and display in good condition.''
   ``Our role is not to track down or recuperate art works not
considered state property. That's the job of other government
offices,'' she said.
   The magazine quoted Lothar Brauner, curator at the
Nationalgalerie, in formerly East Berlin, as saying he received the
works on May 19, 1972 from an unidentified person claiming to have
gotten them from a third party.
   A legal document drawn up that day shows that the person wished
to hand over the paintings ``so that they would be properly
preserved until being returned to their rightful owners.''
   Brauner said he did not know who the rightful owners were.
   According to l'Express, French museum authorities were informed
the works were in Berlin by the French Foreign Affairs Ministry,
itself contacted by East German authorities.
   L'Express recounted how Brauner and his wife, a restoration
expert, locked the paintings in a yellow, wooden armoire and
equipped it with a pail of water and a hydrometer to measure the
humidity. From time to time, they would take out the paintings and
check their condition, the magazine wrote.
   During the war, the Nazis sought to amass as much art as
possible to fulfill Hitler's dream of creating a European arts
center in his native Linz, Austria. Several of his aides, including
Martin Bormann and Hermann Goring, were also art collectors and
rerouted much of the booty into their own hands.
   In July 1944, the Nazi Party's art unit drew up an inventory of
21,903 art works confiscated since 1940.
   However, the list did not include the thousands of paintings by
Matisse, Chagall, Picasso and Leger and others considered
``degenerate'' or ``too Jewish'' and which were either sold to
unscrupulous French and Swiss art dealers or destroyed.
   L'Express wrote the Jeu de Paume museum in Paris, once the
temple of Impressionist art, was used to stockpile seized art
works.
   On May 27, 1943, its interior courtyard was the scene of a giant
bonfire in which some 500 paintings by Andre Masson, Joan Miro,
Paul Klee, Max Ernst and others went up in smoke as Nazi chief
Alfred Rosenberg and armed guards looked on.
   The magazine also described how the Gestapo got its hands on
millions of dollars worth of art works following tips from French
police.
   Based on months of investigative reporting, the magazine accused
the collaborationist Vichy government of expecting to profit
financially from selling the property confiscated from French Jews,
who were later deported to concentration camps.
