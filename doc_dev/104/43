"To write a thriller," the late John Braine once proposed, "you begin with 
improbability. . . . The hero must always be in danger. He must at least once 
be helpless in the hands of the enemy, and he must escape." 
</P>
<P>
Loup Durand follows this formula slavishly. "Daddy," a major best seller in 
France and throughout Europe, not only begins with improbability but remains 
consistently improbable, even absurd, throughout. In doing so, it makes one 
consider the entire question of genre writing. For one would expect that any 
book so formulaic would lie there lifeless, inert, at best a book you keep 
reading for its plot while you berate yourself for surrendering to such obvious 
claptrap. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, this book is alive and vibrant, compelling in its suspense, rich in 
character and incident. Set in Europe during World War II, the story is put 
into motion when an elderly banker, who has funneled hundreds of millions of 
dollars out of Germany for Jews and others, is caught and tortured by the 
Nazis. He leaps from a window to his death before he discloses the immensely 
complex series of secret access codes, which alone would allow the Nazis to 
reach those funds. Only his granddaughter, Maria, knows the codes, and she has 
taught them to her only son, the genius Thomas, who holds them all in his head. 
</P>
<P>
The Nazis want that information and set up a fiendishly effective team to track 
it down. Essentially, the book is a manhunt, although the "men" being hunted 
are, first the lovely Maria who has lived a remarkably independent life and who 
is loved and protected by many people, most notably a team of preternaturally 
capable Spanish bodyguards; and later her son, Thomas, an 11-year-old boy of 
inhuman intelligence and perspicacity and yet -- in perhaps the major victory 
for Durand's writing skill -- immensely likable. If we did not care for this 
boy Thomas, if we did not ache for him when he watches his mother die in 
flames, if we did not feel his unwillingness to attach himself to others when 
he has seen so many who've been kind to him killed, if we did not feel his 
darknesses and his hatreds and his fears, there would be no book. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, we have to suspend disbelief here. This boy with his "rat's 
instinct," his "frightening abnormal lucidity," has the ability to outthink, 
outplan, outfox, an immensely resourceful adversary, the epicene Nazi genius 
Laemmle whose obsession with the boy becomes pathological. They play chess 
against each other, real chess when Thomas is Laemmle's captive, figurative 
chess across the map of Europe when he is on the run. Chess becomes a leitmotiv 
throughout the story. 
</P>
<P>
Much the weakest element in the book is the man who turns out to be Thomas' 
real father, a playboy Rockefeller-type from America, who has never known of 
Thomas' existence. David Quartermain is totally apolitical, a man of no 
commitments, completely uninterested in the family international banking 
business (which turns out to have continuing important connections with Nazi 
Germany throughout the war). Ultimately, David responds to Maria's summoning 
him to Europe and becomes Dick Daring, performing astonishing feats of bravery, 
skill and planning. It's as difficult to believe most of this as it is to 
accept that a man of obvious intelligence and wealth in 1942 would not know why 
France was bisected into occupied and Vichy-controlled sectors, or what a 
"Petainist" was. Quartermain seems almost a Frenchman's view of the noble 
savage, ignorant but instinctively in touch with the good and the true. 
</P>

The great success of "Daddy" is in Durand's teeming imagination. An abundance 
of plot, of imagination, of incident, lends a richness to the book's texture -- 
no minimalism here -- yet never buries the main narrative thrust -- the chase. 
Along the road of life, we meet dozens of characters who are individually 
delineated -- Nazis brutal and cynical, brilliant and dense, French chevaliers 
and graspers, ordinary people fearful or singularly brave, (although there 
certainly seem to be more Resistance heroes per hectare than history, as Marcel 
Ophuls has pitilessly revealed it, really produced). This is not genre fiction 
as high art, in the Le Carre mode, but it is commercial fiction of great skill 
and energy. 
</P>
<P>
A word about the translation from the French by J. Maxwell Brownjohn: It is 
seamless and idiomatic, without a single clumsy construction. It's a remarkable 
achievement to sustain a breakneck narrative pace and never once sound as if 
the book was written in anything other than English.
