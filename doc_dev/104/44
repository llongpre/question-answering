   Western Europe waited for the
Germans in spring 1940, but France felt safe behind the Maginot
Line and Holland hoped to stay neutral. The Dutch army drafted
Cornelius Stam and gave him an 1895 rifle.
   ``We didn't do a damn thing, really,'' Stam recalled last month.
``We were just sitting in the sun'' when Adolf Hitler's death
machine rolled west on May 10, 1940, casting Western Europe into
what Winston Churchill called a ``long night of barbarism.''
   The onslaught by bombers, tanks and 2 million Wehrmacht and SS
soldiers caught the victims unprepared.
   Nazi Germany needed only four days to conquer the Netherlands,
which had been neutral in World War I. Hitler's legions swept the
patchwork defenses aside and destroyed the Dutch fighting spirit
with carpet bombing of Rotterdam.
   Two decades of peace in Europe had ended nearly eight months
earlier with the German invasion of Poland. Britain and France
declared war on Germany as a result, but there had been little
combat in the west.
   When the Germans invaded, officers ``had us march around at 4 in
the morning, toting our rifles on our shoulders, out of sheer
madness,'' Stam said in an interview.
   At dawn May 10, German bombers destroyed major military
airfields in Holland and Hitler's troops poured across the border.
Tanks directed by Field Marshall Gerd von Rundstedt began a sweep
through Belgium, Luxembourg and northern France to the Atlantic,
meeting little resistance.
   Belgium surrendered May 28 after 6,552 civilians and 6,236
soldiers had been killed. Luxembourg's government fled to London on
the invasion's first day.
   Unlike Wilhelmina, the Dutch queen, King Leopold III of Belgium
decided to remain in his country under German occupation. Leopold
ultimately became so deeply compromised that he was forced to
abdicate in 1950.
   Soon after Belgium capitulated, German troops turned south
toward Paris.
   About 70,000 French soldiers were killed in the futile,
six-week-long attempt to halt the German advance, more than all the
Americans killed in Vietnam.
   France relied on the Maginot Line along the German border, a
static defense system based on the tactics of World War I. The
tanks of German panzer divisions swept around the northern end into
France by cutting through the Ardennes forest.
   The Dutch depended on the Water Line, last used successfully in
the 16th century war for independence from Spain, which involved a
ring of flooded land around Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. The
Germans sent waves of paratroopers, against whom flood was no
defense.
   ``It was a very fine morning,'' said Arie Dekker, who was a
15-year-old office boy near Rotterdam when the paratroopers came.
``The pilots were waving at us. ... They'd been told they were
protecting us from the British.''
   Queen Wilhelmina and her government fled to London on May 13.
The next day, when organized resistance was all but crushed, the
Luftwaffe returned to Rotterdam for a pre-announced bombing raid
that leveled its central district and killed about 800 people.
   ``The sun totally vanished,'' said Dekker's wife, Cornelia,
whose family lived in Krimpen aan de Lek, a nearby town. ``At
first, we thought it was a thunderstorm.''
   In four days, the German offensive had killed 2,600 Dutch
civilians and 2,000 soldiers. It began a five-year occupation
horror of starvation, slave labor and deportations to death camps.
   As Holland fell, von Rundstedt's tanks linked up with another
German army group from the north to encircle British and French
troops near the port of Dunkirk in northern France.
   Despite concentrated German air and artillery attacks, 340,000
Allied soldiers escaped to England over a 10-day period, most of
them in small boats commandeered for the rescue.
   Brig. Gen. Charles de Gaulle, who later commanded the Free
French forces from England, led one of the few French
counteroffensives, near Abbeville in the northwest. The Germans
bombed Abbeville to rubble May 20.
   ``There was nothing left after the bombing,'' said Louis
Werheim, who was 6 at the time.
   Werheim and his family fled before the raid. When they returned,
he said, ``There were bodies of French soldiers in our courtyard.
They'd been shot by the Germans.''
   On June 22, France agreed to an armistice. Two-thirds of its
territory was occupied and a collaborationist government under
Marshal Henri-Philippe Petain, the World War I hero, ran the
unoccupied southeastern sector.
   About 1.5 million French soldiers were taken prisoner and held
until the end of the war.
   Civilian hardship followed military surrender.
   Men were shipped from the occupied countries to work as slave
labor in the German war industry. The Netherlands, then primarily
an agricultural economy, was gradually stripped of food to feed the
conquerors.
   Starvation spread through the country. The ``hunger winter'' of
1944 is one of the Dutch people's strongest collective memories.
   Nazi officials used the Dutch penchant for keeping meticulous
records to track down the country's 150,000 Jews, and shipped them
to death camps. Only 6,000 survived.
   The most famous war victim in the the Netherlands was Anne
Frank, a Jewish teenager born in Germany whose diary, written in
hiding with her family, is perhaps the most poignant memorial to
the death camps.
   Most of the Jews in Belgium, Luxembourg and France also died in
the camps.
   Anti-Nazi underground movements were organized in the occupied
countries.
   After the Dutch surrender, Stam used his position with the
Nazi-run Amsterdam Labor Bureau to obtain ration cards for Jews and
resistance fighters in hiding, and to hamper deportation of workers
for slave labor.
   Dekker, the office boy, was 18 when the Germans sent him to
Hamburg to work in a shipyard. He spent three years there and
returned after the war with a busload of Dutch Jews who survived
the Neuengamme concentration camp near Hamburg.
