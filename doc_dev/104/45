   Today is Sunday, July 23, the 204th day of 1989. There are 161
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 23, 1886, New York saloonkeeper Steve Brodie supposedly
made a daredevil plunge from the Brooklyn Bridge into the East
River, a claim supported and disputed by various witnesses. Brodie,
who died in 1901, became a celebrity, although doubts about his
famous leap remain to this day.
   On this date:
   In 1829, William Austin Burt of Mount Vernon, Mich., received a
patent for his ``typographer'' _ a forerunner of the typewriter.
   In 1885, Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th President of the United
States, died in Mount McGregor, N.Y., at age 63.
   In 1904, by some accounts, the ice cream cone was discovered by a
Charles E. Menches during the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St.
Louis.
   In 1914, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia following
the killing of Archduke Francis Ferdinand by an assassin. The
dispute led to World War I.
   In 1945, French Marshal Henri Petain _ who had headed the Vichy
government during World War II _ went on trial. (He was condemned to
death and his sentence was commuted.)
   In 1951, Henri Petain died.
   In 1958, Britain's Queen Elizabeth named the first four women to
peerage in the House of Lords.
   In 1967, rioting that claimed some 43 lives erupted in Detroit
after police raided a black-owned nightspot.
   In 1977, a jury in Washington D.C. convicted 12 Hanafi Moslems of
charges stemming from the hostage siege at three buildings in March
1977.
   In 1982, actor Vic Morrow and two children were killed when a
helicopter crashed on top of them during filming for ``Twilight
Zone: The Movie.''
   In 1986, Britain's Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson at
Westminster Abbey in London.
   Ten years ago: Iranian spiritual leader Ayatollah Khomeini called
for music to be banned from his country's radio and television
stations, saying, ``Like opium, music also stupefies persons
listening to it.''
   Five years ago: Vanessa Williams resigned as Miss America 1984
because nude photographs of her were published in Penthouse
magazine, making her the first pageant-winner to relinquish the
title.
   One year ago: In his weekly radio address, President Ronald
Reagan responded to the just-completed Democratic convention in
Atlanta by accusing the Democrats of ``singing the same sad song
they sang four years ago.''
   Today's Birthdays: Actress Coral Browne is 76. Actress Gloria De
Haven is 64. Baseball hall-of-famer Don Drysdale is 53. Actress
Belinda Montgomery is 39.
   Thought for Today: ``None are so old as those who have outlived
enthusiasm.'' _ Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862).
