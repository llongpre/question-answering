   Today is Saturday, July 23, the 205th day of 1988. There are 161
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On July 23, 1886, New York City saloonkeeper Steve Brodie
supposedly survived a daredevil plunge from the Brooklyn Bridge
into the East River, a claim supported and disputed by various
witnesses. Brodie, who died in 1901, became a celebrity, even
though doubts about his famous leap remain to this day.
   On this date:
   In 1829, William Austin Burt of Mount Vernon, Mich., received a
patent for his ``typographer'' _ a forerunner of the typewriter.
   In 1885, Ulysses S. Grant, the 18th president of the United
States, died in Mount McGregor, N.Y., at age 63.
   In 1904, by some accounts, the ice cream cone was invented by a
Charles E. Menches during the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St.
Louis.
   In 1914, Austria-Hungary issued an ultimatum to Serbia following
the killing of Archduke Francis Ferdinand by an assassin. The
dispute led to World War I.
   In 1945, French Marshal Henri Petain _ who had headed the Vichy
government during World War II _ went on trial. (He was condemned
to death, but his sentence was commuted.)
   In 1951, Henri Petain died.
   In 1958, Britain's Queen Elizabeth named the first four women to
peerage in the House of Lords.
   In 1967, race-related rioting that would claim some 43 lives
erupted in Detroit after police raided a black-owned nightspot.
   In 1977, a jury in Washington convicted 12 Hanafi Moslems of
charges stemming from the hostage siege at three buildings in March
1977.
   In 1982, actor Vic Morrow and two children were killed when a
helicopter crashed on top of them during filming for ``Twilight
Zone: The Movie.'' (Director John Landis and four associates were
later acquitted of manslaughter.)
   In 1984, Vanessa Williams resigned as Miss America because of
nude photographs of her that were being published in Penthouse
magazine.
   In 1986, Britain's Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson in a
glittering ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London.
   Ten years ago: The Israeli Cabinet rejected Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's call for the return of two areas in the occupied
Sinai as a goodwill gesture, but Prime Minister Menachem Begin said
he expected peace talks to resume shortly.
   Five years ago: President Reagan appealed in his weekly radio
address for a donor liver to save the life of Ashley Bailey, an
11-month-old girl at a hospital in Minneapolis. (A donor could not
be found; Ashley died the following November.)
   One year ago: Reagan named nearly a dozen people to complete the
ranks of his commission on the deadly disease AIDS, and challenged
the panel to help ``beat this disease.''
   Today's birthdays: Actress Coral Browne is 75. Actress Gloria De
Haven is 63. Baseball hall-of-famer Don Drysdale is 52. Actress
Belinda Montgomery is 38.
   Thought for today: ``I'm a self-made man, but I think if I had
it to do over again, I'd call in someone else.'' _ Roland Young,
English actor (1887-1953).
