<HEAD>Le Pen Hometown Says No To Right-Wing Gathering</HEAD>

   TRINITE-SUR-MER, France (AP) _ The hometown of extreme
right-wing leader Jean-Marie Le Pen refused Monday to let him bring
in a gathering of like-minded politicians from around Europe.
   A majority of Trinite-Sur-Mer's 15 municipal legislators voted
to reject the request by the town's most famous son to allow a
meeting of extreme-right European leaders next month.
   His birthplace, a coastal resort of 56,000 people on the
Atlantic coast, joined Vichy, Aurillac, Angouleme, Lorient and
Poitiers in turning away the chief of the anti-immigrant National
Front party.
   Councilors cited public objections to renting a public hall to
Le Pen, who frequently makes anti-Semitic remarks, following a
series of desecrations at Jewish cemeteries around France.
   The council also objected to the likely presence of Franz
Schoenhuber, a former Waffen SS soldier who heads West Germany's
far-right Republican Party.
   ``We have had enough of seeing our town associated with the
image of Le Pen,'' three assistant mayors declared in a joint
statement last week. ``We prefer the image of the sailing capital
of Brittany.''
   About 400 citizens signed a petition asking the council to turn
down the National Front's request to use the public meeting hall
during the meeting planned June 5-8.
   In Paris, the City Council held a moment of silence Monday in
honor of the dead whose graves were found defiled May 10 in the
southern town of Carpentras.
   The desecration of the 34 graves and mutilation of a corpse
touched off a wave of vandalism in France, but also prompted public
demonstrations against a perceived rise in anti-Semitism.
