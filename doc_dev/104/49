WHEN the votes were counted in the French National Assembly on Wednesday, Mr
Philippe Seguin, the maverick champion of old-style Gaullist values, was
jubilant. In the quixotic hope of throwing out the Maastricht Treaty of
European Union lock, stock and barrel, he had just delivered a mammoth
diatribe, lasting nearly 2  1/2 hours, designed to prove the whole exercise
was incompatible with the constitution and the soul of France.
He failed by a wide margin but chalked up a bigger score than anyone
expected. Of the 569 members voting, 101 cast their ballot against the
Maastricht Treaty, including nearly half the 126 members of his own Gaullist
Party.
The government was disturbed at such a large anti-Treaty vote but the
Gaullist party leadership, which had tried to tread an ambivalent line of
half-hearted scepticism, was appalled at the scale of the split in the
party.
Nobody seriously expects Mr Seguin can prevent ratification of the
Maastricht Treaty. With the Socialists, the Centrists, and the centre-right
UDF umbrella grouping, the government can still probably count on a solid
majority, even without the Gaullists.
Yet Mr Seguin's oratorical tour de force, set off powerful patriotic
vibrations with a large minority of his fellow parliamentarians, which may
yet create uncertainty in the ratification process.
He rallied support from nationalists across the political spectrum,
including 4 votes from the centre and centre-right, and all 26 Communists;
Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement, the maverick Socialist and leader of a small
clan of 5 left-wing Gaullists in the Socialist Party, warmly congratulated
Mr Seguin for his very 'Republican' speech.
Philippe Seguin has long been a disturber of the peace in the Gaullist
Party. He served as social affairs minister in the government of Mr Jacques
Chirac in 1986-88; but after Mr Chirac's defeat in the 1988 presidential
elections, Mr Seguin challenged Mr Chirac's status as party leader.
A year later he joined a short-lived rebellion of young Gaullists in a
protest against the stranglehold of Chirac; but after it was put down
promptly recanted.
In relation to President Mitterrand's ambitions for a more integrated EC
however, Seguin's attitude has been one of consistent hostility.
Mr Seguin was born and brought up in Tunisia before its independence, and
some people link his passionate French patriotism to his pied-noir origins.
Whatever the psychological springs, Mr Seguin remains an unreconstructed
Gaullist, in an era when it is less fashionable and less feasible.
His European convictions derive in every detail from General de Gaulle's
passionate faith in France's future as an independent and sovereign country,
and his hostility to the supranational undertones of the European Community.
'Without a currency tomorrow, without a defence', said Mr Seguin on
Wednesday, 'without a diplomacy the day after, France would at best have as
little freedom of manoeuvre as Ukraine or Azerbaijan. Some people can accept
that; but it is not the future that I want for my country'.
'The logic of the economic and political process put together at Maastricht,
is that of a cut-price federalism, fundamentally anti-democratic, falsely
liberal, deliberately technocratic. The Europe they are offering us ..
buries the concept of national sovereignty and the great principles born of
the Revolution.
Like de Gaulle, Seguin's vision of Europe is of a loose congeries of freely
cooperating sovereign states, in what used to be summed up as 'L'Europe des
Patries'.
As a corollary, he believes in a wide extension of this Europe to include
all the countries of the continent.
De Gaulle remains a hero for many Frenchmen because he restored their
self-respect after the shame of Vichy, and appeared to promise France a
great future as a great power.
In 1958 many thought De Gaulle might reject the fledgeling EC. Instead he
announced: 'We shall enter the Common Market as agreed. We shall enter, but
upright'.
These were the words Philippe Seguin chose for his peroration. 'Yes, we want
Europe, but upright'. A romantic cry of protest for what he must have known
was likely to be a lost cause.
