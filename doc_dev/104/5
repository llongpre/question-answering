READING newspapers on holiday is the kind of activity for which there used
not to be a word. Today, we have re-invented 'disjunctive.' At least, I
think that is the word because it implies a lack of coherence between what
one is doing and the circumstances in which it is being done.
For the past two years, many have been alarmed on exotic beaches by reports
of distant crises, first in Kuwait then in Moscow. This time, we hoped to
avoid these guns of August by going to the Dordogne in July. But instead of
the echoes of present crises, the papers were full of the tragedy of half a
century before.
Most years at this time, there is mention of events in July 1942 when the
French police rounded up thousands of naturalised French Jews and their
children and sent them to the death camps. Generically, the episode is known
as the Vel' d'Hiv', this being the abbreviation of the Paris winter cycling
stadium where the victims were held before transportation.
The 50th anniversary occasioned more heart-searching than ever. On July 16,
Liberation headlined its front page: 'France faces up to its crimes.'
Figaro, meanwhile, interviewed the nazi-Hunter, Serge Klarsfeld, who said
France could not be blamed. More Jews had survived there than in other
occupied countries.
The debate dominated even the provincial press: Sud-Ouest ran related
stories for several days, headlining the 'lively polemic' the anniversary
had generated, along with President Mitterand's presence at a commemorative
ceremony in Paris.
One question at issue was the nature of the Vichy government, the
collaborationist regime that was presented by Marshal Petain as the true
successor of the 'Vraie France.' Vichy also was implicated in the atrocities
of the Vel' d'Hiv'. But were they the result of defeat and 'the criminal
madness of the occupying power,' as the mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac, put
it? Or was it all, in a sense, a French responsibility?
This debate impinged on our holiday in a graphic manner. We were staying a
mile north of the River Dronne; the nearest town was Riberac, on the
southern bank. The Dronne was the frontier between occupied and Vichy
France, and the old Gestapo headquarters is one of the last buidings before
crossing into Riberac. A little to the West is the glade containing the
graves of the resistants shot by the Nazis.
What the newspapers were agonising over was whether that was a national
frontier - whether France existed south of the Dronne. It was this debate
that was more intense than on the other anniversaries of the events of 1942.
This is partly because one or two of the most notable figures involved are
still at large, having sometimes been protected by the Roman Catholic Church
 -as the Church's own astounded report showed earlier this year.
Opinion in France has, if anything, hardened against the perpetrators in the
face of judicial complacency: almost three-quarters of the people want them
punished. The other quarter, one assumes, are don't-knows or supporters of
Jean-Marie Le Pen and the National Front.
The strength of the Front today has itself contributed to the debate over
the French past. The party stands for that constant strand in French
politics which, to say the least, is ambiguous about the Revolution.
It flaunts its sentimental religiosity, built around the cult of Joan of
Arc, and is a successor to the xenophobia of 'Action francaise' and the
racism of the 19th century. Its ambiguous relationship with Vichy and
Marshal Petain is, therefore, a living embodiment of the debate.
A little over a year ago, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ran a cartoon
showing history drawing a line under a page marked 'Post-war period.' That
optimistic assessment has turned out to be inaccurate.
The post-war period was frozen out by the Cold War and - as events all over
Europe now show - has, in fact, only just begun.
