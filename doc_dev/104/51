   When Premier Edouard Daladier returned to France 50
years ago after signing the Munich Pact with Adolf Hitler, Neville
Chamberlain and Benito Mussolini, he received a delirious hero's
welcome.
   In most French eyes he had saved their country and averted war.
   But today, for many French citizens the Munich Pact and the name
Daladier are synonymous with appeasement, even cowardice. It also
may be one of the reasons why the pacifist movement has never
gained much ground in France.
   ``To criticize somebody as a ``Munichois'' is an insult,'' said
Jean-Pierre Azema, a historian at Paris' prestigious Political
Science Institute. ``Somebody who lacks courage is called
Munichois.''
   Yet, at the time, the agreement that gave Czechoslovakia's
Sudetenland to Germany was approved by 60-65 percent of the French
people, despite French military accords with the Prague government
in force since World War I.
   But the French themselves became the victims of Hitler's
ambitions when the Nazis occupied France in 1940.
   Daladier, then minister of war, was interned by the
collaborationist Vichy government. In 1943 he was taken to Germany
and imprisoned until the end of the war.
   Daladier never recovered politically. He died in 1970, having
never again held office.
   ``Even though his attitude during the war was irreproachable, he
never recuperated politically because of Munich,'' said Azema.
   The Munich generation is now in its twilight years. The majority
of today's Frenchmen have no firsthand memory of the times, its
dangers, its fears, its politics.
   Nonetheless, Munich remains a strong symbol.
   ``I have the impression that it rendered the French
non-pacifist,'' said Azema, noting stronger movements in other
European countries.
   ``Politically, mentally, pacifism was killed by Munich. No
French politician can support a pacifist policy, a pacific policy
yes, but not a pacifist policy.''
