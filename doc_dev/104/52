<TEXT>
   In a July 4 obituary, The Associated Press
erroneously said that Jean Leguay, a police official in the Vichy
France wartime regime, was detained briefly in 1979 when he was
charged with aiding the Nazis in the deportation of French Jews.
   Leguay was not detained when he was charged and the case was
still pending at the time of his death on July 1.
