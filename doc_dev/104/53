   The French, known for fickleness in politics and
love, have become so enamored of President Francois Mitterrand that
they affectionately call him Uncle and his following often is
compared to a cult.
   With presidential elections less than three months away,
Mitterrand is a phantom candidate. He says he has not decided on
seeking re-election, but draws celebrities, scientists and ordinary
citizens onto his bandwagon in an effortless non-campaign.
   Politicians who have spoken with the 71-year-old Socialist say
he will declare his intentions in early March. The first-round vote
is set for April 24.
   Meanwhile, Mitterrand is called more and more by the nickname
Tonton, an affectionate term for uncle. He has become a sort of
political superstar, imperturbable and lovable in his presidential
grandeur.
   Lacking a declared rival in the Socialist opposition, Premier
Jacques Chirac and former Premier Raymond Barre have a problem. The
two leading conservatives are reduced to shadow-boxing with the
avuncular Mitterrand image at the risk of looking like family
bullies.
   ``Francois Mitterrand would be well advised to give an answer
soon,'' Chirac said recently. ``A presidential election is an
important affair.''
   Barre has criticized ``the often abusive use of an image, that
of the nice old uncle. It's both charming and fuzzy. It's sweet
tonton.''
   Mitterrand's popularity has risen since his Socialist government
lost power to the Chirac conservatives in March 1986. He has led
opinion polls for months, but the phenomenon called
``Mitterrandolatry'' or ``Tontonmania'' is recent.
   With the Socialist Party not conducting an official campaign,
independent committees began springing up around the country,
gathering signatures and putting up Mitterrand posters.
   Groups of noted scientists, intellectuals, homosexuals and
others advertised their support.
   Actor Gerard Depardieu said he never votes, but he bought a
full-page newspaper ad declaring: ``Mitterrand or nothing.'' The
rock star Renaud sponsored a similar ad, urging the president to
``hang in there.''
   Dominique Jamet, editor of the right-wing newspaper Quotidien de
Paris, was among hundreds of people who signed an appeal saying,
``Don't Leave Us.'' He was fired immediately.
   Justice Minister Albin Chalandon compared the president's
relationship with the French to that of Marshal Philippe Petain,
head of the Vichy France government that collaborated with the
German occupation in World War II. Many of the French were
scandalized by the comparison.
   Chalandon called the situation ``irrational'' and said the
campaign climate risked becoming one of ``soft, vague demagogy.''
   Indeed, pro-Mitterrand letters being published speak of ``Dr.
Mitterrand,'' his ``intellectual firmness'' and his ``cultural
finesse.''
   A quarterly magazine named Influence quoted a former dancer at
the Crazy Horse nightclub as saying Mitterrand is not a sex symbol,
``but he is so soft, with such a watchful air, that it gives him in
my eyes great charm. Without mentioning his intelligence, which
seduces me completely.''
   Historian Jacques Julliard, who studies public opinion and
contemporary political culture, says ``Tontonmania'' is explainable.
   ``Always in France there is the role of the providential man,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   As a president sharing power with a conservative premier,
Mitterrand has a high profile without the blame for unpopular
government policies.
   ``He is a president who doesn't govern,'' Julliard said. ``When
he officially becomes a candidate, he'll start losing points.''
   One of many recent polls indicated 61 percent of French people
want Mitterrand as president, 48 percent prefer Barre and 40
percent favor Chirac.
   In early 1986, when a Socialist government still was in power,
Mitterrand's support was 39 percent.
   ``If Mitterrand is not officially a candidate, it is to make
himself desired,'' wrote Serge July, editor of the leftist
newspaper Liberation, reflecting the view that the president's
refusal to declare himself is a political tactic.
   Mitterrand has made few comments about ``Tontonmania,'' saying
only that he had no hand in the private efforts on his behalf. As
he put it in late December: ``It's very nice of them. They didn't
consult me and so I have neither to say go ahead nor to stop them.''
