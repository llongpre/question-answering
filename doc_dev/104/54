FT  17 JUL 92 / Spanish ban means Nike can't just do it: A trade mark ruling
that prevents advertising and sales by the biggest sportswear group

A SPANISH Supreme court decision to uphold a ban on the advertising and sale
of sportswear in Spain by the US market leader Nike to protect a Spanish
claimant to the Nike name is embarrassing Madrid just eight days before the
Olympic Games start in Barcelona.
For a time last week it was feared the courts might even use police to
prevent the US athletic team, which is being sponsored by Nike, from
entering the Montjuic stadium in Barcelona for the inaugural ceremony on
July 25 if they were wearing the Nike flash.
With Madrid under pressure from the US and the European Commission, the
Barcelona judge who ordered the ban found a novel way around the problem -
the athletes could wear their Nike uniforms as they would not have been
bought in Spain.
The ban has, of course, infuriated Nike, the world's biggest sportswear
company with global sales last year of Dollars 3.4bn. Nike (slogan: 'Just do
it') has been engaged in a three-year battle with the Spanish authorities to
get its goods into the country and had been hoping to use the Games to
launch a multi-million-dollar line of new sportswear.
That respite aside, the ban, which is provisional and affects Nike apparel
but not its shoes, has opened a serious breach in Spain's trade relations
with the US. Madrid has been placed on Washington's watchdog list, making it
a potential victim of reprisals.
Government officials in the Spanish capital, asked in June by the European
Commission for an explanation, confess they are concerned about the
implications of the ban but that there is little they can do to overturn
decisions made by independent judges.
The government is trying to persuade the courts to allow Nike US to post a
bond which would allow it to advertise during the Games but provide some
security to the Spanish claimant to the Nike name should the courts continue
to find against the US company.
'Over the past three years, in the Spanish courts and in the market place,
our rights to operate as a brand in Spain have been trampled under,' said Mr
Richard Donahue, president of Nike, from the company's Oregon headquarters
recently.
'Our goods have been seized from bonded warehouses, our country manager
harassed, read his rights and summoned before a criminal court to defend
Nike's movement of products within the free trade zone (of European
Community countries).'
Nike's nightmare goes back to 1932 when a Catalan sock maker registered the
Nike name in Spain. Little is known of the Spanish Nike's fortunes until
1982 when Nike Inc signed a distribution agreement with the owner of the
rights to market the Nike brandname in Spain, a Catalan company called
Cidesport. The actual trademark is owned by a Catalan lawyer, Mr Juan Amigo.
When Nike International, Nike Inc's international operating arm, first began
doing business with Cidesport, the marketing rights were held by two
brothers, Carlos and Lorenzo Rosal Bertrand. Nike officials in Oregon say
they were assured by the brothers that the local trademark was not a
problem. However, by 1988 when Nike began to indicate it wanted to market
its product directly in Spain, Mr Amigo had transferred the right of use of
the name to Flora Bertrand, mother of the Bertrand brothers, and Cidesport
would not let the trademark go.
Mr Amigo and his partner are now offering to sell Nike the Spanish rights to
the Nike name for Dollars 30m, which the US company flatly refuses to pay.
But a Barcelona court has upheld the local company's rights to the mark and,
in June, the Constitutional Court turned down an appeal by Nike
International. At stake now is another appeal to overturn the ban while
lawyers fight over the basic rights issue.
Nike Inc reckons the ban could cost around Dollars 20m a year in Spain and
that sales of Nike clothes by the Spanish company amount, in effect, to
counterfeiting. That may allow the government, helpless to intervene until
now, a way into the dispute by using its prosecutors to mount a criminal
case but as yet no decision has been made.
While the string of court cases is most unlikely to be resolved before the
Games, Nike Inc can take heart, however, from the results of a 50-year
battle by Perrier, the French natural water group, to sell its Vichy water
in Spain. Then, too, Catalan courts repeatedly upheld the rights of the
makers of Vichy Catalan to use the Vichy name in Spain. They relented last
year.
Nike Inc's struggle should not take quite so long; even this month it has
been awarded new trade marks by the Spanish authorities. Mr Amigo's Dollars
30m play may be running out of time but until it does, Nike buffs may have
to gambol about wearing only their shoes.
