France's most wanted war criminal, Paul Touvier, was arrested today after 45 
years on the run, and church sources said the building where he was seized 
belonged to excommunicated traditionalist Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said Touvier, leader of the militia that collaborated with 
Nazi Germany in the southeastern French city of Lyon during World War II, was 
arrested on the grounds of a monastery near the southern city of Nice. 
</P>
<P>
French radio said Touvier, 74, had been sheltered by French religious 
authorities since the end of the war. He was flown to Paris immediately after 
his arrest for interrogation by an investigating magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
Senior sources in France's Roman Catholic Church later told Reuters that the 
priory where Touvier was arrested belonged to Lefebvre. 
</P>
<P>
The sources said the municipality of Nice had given the Priory of 
Saint-Francois in central Nice to the Saint Pius X Fraternity, Lefebvre's 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
Touvier headed the militia that helped occupying German forces track down 
resistance fighters. He is believed to have worked closely with Gestapo chief 
Klaus Barbie, jailed for life in France in 1987 for war crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Touvier was twice sentenced to death in absentia but finally pardoned by the 
late President Georges Pompidou in 1972, although resistance movements later 
brought charges against him of crimes against humanity. 
</P>
<P>
A French newspaper carried the announcement of his death in 1984, but police 
always suspected that Touvier was still alive. 
</P>
<P>
Touvier joined the Vichy regime that collaborated with Nazi Germany during the 
war, and was quickly promoted to head the police force of Lyon, a center of the 
French resistance. 
</P>
<P>
Historian Henri Amouroux told French radio: "The resistance movement accuses 
the church and its hierarchy of protecting Touvier, and I believe that is true. 
</P>
<P>
"Touvier's trial will reawaken many painful moments from the war and also drag 
the church into having to give an embarrassing explanation of why it protected 
him," Amouroux added.
