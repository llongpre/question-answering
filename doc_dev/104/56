Italy and Switzerland are drawn to the drama over Perrier's ownership

Even by French standards, where the intricate webs of corporate holdings and
cross-holdings recall the incestuous sub-plots and shifting alliances of Les
Liaisons Dangereuses, the machinations over the ownership of Source Perrier,
the world's biggest mineral water group, are unusually tortuous.
Yesterday the saga took a turn when Nestle of Switzerland, the world's
largest food manufacturer, joined forces with Banque Indosuez, a powerful
Parisian bank, to mount a FFr13.24bn (Pounds 1.36bn) bid for Perrier.
The bid comes only a few weeks after Ifint, an investment vehicle of the
Italian Agnelli family, made a FFr5.6bn offer for Exor, the wine and
property group which controls 35 per cent of Perrier.
On the face of it, the latest turn of events has pitted two of Europe's most
powerful business empires into head-to-head confrontation and split the
French financial establishment down the middle.
However, the relationships linking the different parties are so complex  -
and the ultimate motives of most of them so murky - that stock market
analysts were yesterday unsure whether the skirmishing would develop into
all-out war or be settled amicably by behind-the-scenes negotiation.
Among the French protagonists, the Suez group, owner of Banque Indosuez,
holds 10 per cent of Exor. Meanwhile, Saint Louis, a French sugar, paper and
packaging company in which the Agnellis own a stake, recently paid FFr1.5bn
for 13.8 per cent of Perrier. Saint Louis also owns 3 per cent of BSN, the
French food group.
The Agnellis indirectly own 5.8 per cent of BSN and have made no secret that
their aim is to raise the stake further.
However, BSN is also linked with Nestle. The two groups recently teamed up
to bid for Cokoladovny, a Czech confectionery company, and yesterday BSN
agreed to buy Perrier's Volvic mineral water business for an undisclosed sum
if Nestle's bid succeeds.
The agreement appears designed to smooth the path of the European Commission
approving an eventual takeover of Perrier by the Swiss group. A deal would
almost certainly fall within the scope of the EC's 15-month-old merger
regulation, which has not yet been applied to a large acquisition in the
food and drink industry.
The Perrier saga started early last year when Ifint began buying shares in
Exor. In November Ifint launched a partial bid for Exor which, after
protests from the minority shareholders, not least from the Suez group, was
turned into a full bid.
Last summer, Ifil, another Agnelli vehicle, acquired 6.4 per cent of Saint
Louis, which it has since controlled with Worms et Cie, the French
family-owned holding company. Earlier this month Saint Louis bought its
stake in Perrier.
However the whole issue of Ifint's bid for Exor and Saint Louis' purchase of
Perrier stock has gone on ice while the French regulatory authorities
scrutinise the deals and decide whether to sanction the Saint Louis
investment.
Enter Nestle and Indosuez with their offer for Perrier, amid frenzied
speculation in the French and Italian press about the Agnellis' long-term
intentions towards BSN.
Mr Antoine Riboud, BSN's 73-year-old chairman, has long been friendly with
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, head of the Italian group, and has named no heir
apparent. BSN's shares rose sharply on the Paris bourse yesterday.
Whether the significance of the recent convolutions lies chiefly in what
they say about capitalism French-style, or whether they are a portent of the
kinds of problems which may lie ahead for other, future, moves to
restructure the European food industry, is quite another matter.
Some French analysts suspect the Nestle offer is too low to be more than a
sighting shot.
'It may be that Nestle wants to flush out a counter-bidder,' said Mr John
Cousins, head of BZW-Puget Mahe, the Paris broker.
'If so who would the counter bidder be? The Agnellis? I certainly can't
imagine anyone else wanting to get involved in this mess.'
Although the Agnellis's business empire already includes foods, their
involvement is as investors rather than as hands-on managers with a deep
knowledge of the industry.
Many analysts view their recent expansion in France mainly as a form of
portfolio diversification.
In contrast, both the industrial logic of Nestle's bid, and the seriousness
of its interest in Perrier, seem clear: a spokesman for the Swiss company
said it viewed mineral water as 'a strategic axis' of its future
development, offering good long-term growth prospects.
Nestle, which seeks to cultivate a public image of wholesomeness, does not
normally indulge in hostile bids - particularly if, like that for Perrier,
they involve it in high-profile political manoeuvring.
Its successful bid for Rowntree three years ago was an exception and appears
to have been partly an attempt to pre-empt a takeover of the UK chocolate
maker by Suchard, Nestle's Swiss arch-rival in confectionery.
Similar considerations seem to have influenced yesterday's bid. Nestle said
only last week that it had been considering bidding for Perrier, before it
was thwarted by the Agnellis.
Nestle, which is a world leader in instant coffee, confectionery and dairy
products, is already the world's third largest mineral water supplier.
Its interests include Vittel in France - the still water market leader of
which it recently acquired full control - Ashbourne in Britain and several
smaller companies in Germany and the US.
However, it still trails a distant third in the business behind Perrier and
BSN, which had 1990 mineral water sales of FFr8.7bn and FFr5.2bn
respectively. Vittel, Nestle's biggest mineral water subsidiary by far, had
sales of only FFr1.9bn.
Acquisition of Perrier, even without Volvic, would leapfrog Nestle into a
commanding lead in the business, with best-selling brands including
Contrexeville and Vichy in France and Arrowhead, Great Bear and Poland
Spring in the US.
Though sales of Perrier's best-known brand were hurt by a benzene scare in
1990, the mineral water market has continued to expand strongly, because of
consumers' increasing concern with health and fitness.
It is also a highly profitable business: in the first half of this year, BSN
earned an operating margin of 21 per cent on its mineral water activities.
It is less clear, however, whether Nestle would want to keep Perrier's other
main business, Caves de Roquefort, which distributes the famous blue cheese.
Nestle, which shed most of its cheese interests some years ago, should have
no difficulty finding bidders for the business, which controls 80 per cent
of the French roquefort market.
Obviously, the saga still has a way to run and any number of further
surprises is possible.
Some analysts were suggesting yesterday that, if the Agnellis are serious
about building up their European food interests, they may wish to avoid a
showdown at this stage with a player as powerful as Nestle and may seek a
face-saving way out of their involvement with Perrier.
As things stand, a successful Nestle bid may not leave the other parties
involved too unhappy.
Saint Louis, regulators willing, would stand to make a FFr600m paper profit
on its brief investment in Perrier, notwithstanding Nestle's threat
yesterday to take legal action to freeze Saint Louis's voting rights. BSN
would walk away with Volvic, while the longer-term prospect of taking
control of BSN would remain open to the Agnellis.
However, whatever direction developments take, it seems increasingly
unlikely that Perrier will retain either its independence or its full range
of existing business.
As one London stockbroker put it bluntly yesterday: 'Perrier is a goner. It
is part of history.'
