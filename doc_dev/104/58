<DESCRIPT>  FRANCE; MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  EACH generation has its cross to bear. For the French who lived through World
War II, that cross carries the scarlet inscription "Collaborator!" Who
collaborated with Marshal Petain's Vichy government, and why? Half a dozen
French film makers -- most notably Alain Resnais (in "Hiroshima, Mon Amour")
and Marcel Ophuls ("The Sorrow and the Pity") -- have asked this question both
to exploit and shed France's lingering war guilt.;   And now it's the popular
Claude Berri's turn. The veteran director of "Jean de Florette" and "Manon of
the Springs" returns today with "Uranus," based on the novel by Marcel Ayme
and boasting a veritable who's who of French stars, including Philippe Noiret
and Gerard Depardieu.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There's so much talent on display here, it's a crime "Uranus" isn't more
compelling or tough-minded. Always the sentimentalist, Berri here gives his
actors and his signature humanism free rein. The result is a stagy and
long-winded debate among various political factions just after V-E Day. The
purpose of this talk and backstairs intrigue? To reiterate the obvious, that
we're all survivors who fool ourselves into believing our way is the way.;  
Jean-Pierre Marielle plays the pragmatist who, out of guilt for surviving in
comfort, now shields an unrepentant collaborator played by Gerard Desarthe.
Marielle's apartment is more crowded than the Amsterdam attic in "The Diary of
Anne Frank." It shelters the all-forgiving town teacher (Noiret), a
weasel-like communist organizer (Michel Blanc) and his angry wife (Myriam
Boyer), and Marielle's bored wife (Daniele Lebrun).;   Elsewhere, we find the
town drunk/tavern owner (Depardieu), the town snitch (a quite wonderful Daniel
Prevost), and the town profiteer (Michel Galabru) who stockpiles paintings by
Picasso in his shed.;   "All of France is a hypocrite -- it's one big lie,"
someone sums things up nicely at one juncture.;   Unfortunately, Berri doesn't
leave it at this. He has his sad collaborators and semi-collaborators drone on
and on. Depardieu's would-be poet and Noiret's all-loving philosopher are
particularly hard to take. Depardieu, here sporting a Hitler mustache, always
overdoes it. His Leopold is an obnoxious bear of a man whose death is every
bit as ham-fisted as his town-square revelries. His much-acclaimed Cyrano is a
timid shut-in by comparison.; Uranus; (star) 1/2; Rating: No MPAA rating
(could be PG-13); in French with English subtitles.; Cast: Michel Blanc,
Gerard Depardieu, Philippe Noiret; Writer-director: Claude Berri; Running
time: 1 hour, 40 minutes  </TEXT>
