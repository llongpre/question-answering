PARIS AFTER THE LIBERATION: 1944-1949 by Anthony Beevor and Artemis Cooper
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 20, 531 pages
Artemis Cooper has published an excellent account of Cairo In The War, not
to speak of editing the correspondence of Evelyn Waugh and Diana Cooper (her
grandmother). Anthony Beevor is responsible, among other things, for a
first-class history of the Battle of Crete. They are married. Paris After
The Liberation is a good idea which does not quite come off. That deserves
explanation.
The story - of Paris between the Liberation of August 1944 and the economic
stabilisation in 1949 - is fascinating, and calls out for an accessible,
layman's account on the 50th anniversary (this book does not pretend to be a
work of academic scholarship, a field which is being intensively tilled at
present).
The authors are privileged: they benefit from access to the diaries of the
British ambassador Duff Cooper (grandpa), Nancy Mitford's unpublished
letters, and various other archives of the English Establishment to which, I
assume, they belong.
The value of this access is less clear because it tilts the narrative
towards the beautiful people. It is amusing to have it confirmed that Diana
and Duff called de Gaulle 'Charlie Wormwood' (as in 'wormwood and gall'). We
get an insider's view of Louise de Vilmorin (Duff's lover), of Nathalie
Barney ('l'imperatrice des Lesbiennes'), of Gaston Palewski (Nancy Mitford's
boyfriend), even of Cocteau, of Poulenc, of Christian Berard.
The first hundred pages are in effect a brisk introduction, which is a
dangerous tactic in book-making because it misleadingly suggests a
superficial and over-hasty tone to what, from 1944, becomes detailed,
analytical, better. With the arrival of Duff Cooper's diaries, the book
looks up.
The first theme has to be the end of Occupation and the subsequent epuration
sauvage. Again, this is a subject which has at last been heavily
investigated, and we read of Paris only. Collaboration was a nightmare
subject which brought much head-shaving and arbitrary execution in late 1944
and even more guilt for many years to come.
Arletty and Sacha Guitry, Drieu la Rochelle, Celine, Colette, Chanel, Lifar,
Giono, de Montherlant, even Simenon, Barrault and Clouzot, were among many
artists who came under different degrees of suspicion.
It was, and remained for years, a terrifying topic. Isaiah Berlin here
offers a useful definition of acceptable conduct under the German
Occupation: you could do business with them but 'you did not have to be cosy
with them'.
One problem, of course, was that the French communists had suffered
particularly under Vichy with the execution of hostages and deportation of
slave labour. Now the communists could see a way to exploit their sufferings
in their bid for post-war power.
This is the central political subject of these years, and the second theme
of this book. 'There are only two real forces in France today,' said de
Gaulle in December 1945. 'If the communists win, France will be a Soviet
Republic; if I win, France will stay independent.' It was not to be as
simple and the Beevors (if I may call them that) track the story in fair
detail until it is clear by 1949 that the Fourth Republic has come through.
The weakness of the style of this book is immediately confirmed: 'The mood
of optimism was further reinforced on 18 July (1949), when Odile de
Lenoncourt married the Duc de Guiche, eldest son of Duc de Gramont, at the
Church of Saint-Louis des Invalides. The right people were still marrying
the right people.' And the bride wore Dior.
So that was all right. In between many pages of political and diplomatic
history we have been given the cultural and literary story.
We are assured of the 'arrogant irresponsibility' of the French
intellectuals, their trahison des clercs, the 'dictatorship of the
progressive intelligentsia', the eventual failure of radical ideas to
overcome the French bourgeoisie - big themes - but the reader is not always
convinced.
The problem, I suggest, is that the Beevors have bitten off more than they
can chew.
They have written an interesting but awkward combination of a
politico-diplomatic history of France in the immediate aftermath of war and
the cultural story of those same years. But in the event, they have fallen
between two stools.
