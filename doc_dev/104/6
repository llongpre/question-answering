   Lawyers and human rights activists say the
prosecution of three alleged Nazi collaborators has been stalled or
dragged out because of a reluctance to expose French complicity in
the Holocaust.
   War crimes charges against one of the men, Maurice Papon, have
been pending for seven years. Another, Rene Bousquet, was
implicated in 1949 for his activities as police chief in the Vichy
regime, but only now faces the possibility of a trial.
   The third alleged war criminal, Paul Touvier, is on trial for
his activities as a pro-Nazi militia chief in Lyon.
   Representatives of the International Federation of Human Rights
say authorities have failed to relieve the judge of other cases to
make the trial move more swiftly.
   ``We believe it is no accident that these three men have not
been tried,'' said Yves Jouffa, president of the French League of
Human Rights, at a recent news conference.
   ``It is because they are part of what the English call the
establishment, whether it be in politics, business, industry or
high society.... This milieu does not want to see its dirty laundry
washed in public.''
   Bousquet, 81, headed the national police during the Nazi
occupation. State prosecutors last month asked that he be
investigated in connection with the deportation of 194 Jewish
children during the war.
   A Paris criminal court court ruled Oct. 19 that Bousquet could
only be tried by the High Court of the Liberation, formed in 1944
to prosecute officials of the Vichy regime. The Liberation court
has been defunct for decades, and the ruling by the Paris judges
indicated Bousquet would escape prosecution.
   However, at the request of state prosecutors, an appeals court
plans to make a final ruling on the jurisdiction issue Nov. 19.
   Serge Klarsfeld, a lawyer and prominent Nazi hunter, said senior
government officials, including President Francois Mitterrand,
appear reluctant to pursue the case.
   ``I think Mitterrand doesn't want this trial to open,''
Klarsfeld said. ``I can only hypothesize that there is a certain
indulgence toward Vichy.''
   Should the case go to trial, Bousquet would be the highest
ranking French official in the Vichy government to be tried for
crimes against humanity.
   Bousquet was condemned in 1949 for his activities under Nazi
occupation, but the decision was reversed for ``acts accomplished
in favor of the Resistance'' - namely, his decision to free some
jailed resistance fighters.
   Jouffa, who spent part of World War II in a French internment
camp, said none of the high-ranking French political figures with
direct roles in deporting and arresting 100,000 Jews during the war
have been brought to justice.
   He said the recent trial of the Gestapo chief in Lyon, Klaus
Barbie, ``was the trial of Nazi Germany, not collaborationist
France.
   The human rights federation said it had organized an inquiry
commission to determine why the cases were taking so long. Their
report is being submitted to the United Nations and the Council of
Europe.
   ``We hope that the very fact that we have carried out this
mission will be enough to create movement in high places and allow
these proceedings to be accelerated,'' Jouffa said.
   Papon, a former budget minister, has been accused of
responsibility for the arrests and deportations of 1,700 Jews while
an administrator in Bordeaux during the war. Now 81, he served in
many high-profile positions after the war, including a stint as
Paris police chief.
   Touvier, 75, worked with Barbie in Lyon. He went into hiding in
1973, and was arrested in May 1989 at a priory in Nice run by
followers of Archbishop Marcel Lefevbre, the fundamentalist Roman
Catholic leader.
