The sensational collapse in popular support for the governing Socialist
party in the French regional elections a week ago has opened up a national
political crisis to which there is no obvious solution. There is no obvious
solution because the acuteness of the apparent crisis, as expressed in the
violent dislocation of voting patterns, seems irrational and
disproportionate, in relation to the observable facts in the real world.
It is common to explain the election result as a classic protest vote.
Circumstances conspired to turn the minor event of the elections to 22
regional councils into a national test of opinion, with the maximum scope
for free expression, in the therapeutic or play-group sense of the term. The
voters were angry about unemployment, or immigration, or Europe, or the
financial scandals in the political parties; so they let rip with infantile
ill temper and disillusionment.
Yet the intensity of this French protest seems out of all proportion with
what they have to protest about. The vote implies that France is the worst
governed country in Europe; in fact the French are as well governed as
anyone, and better off than most.
In economic management terms, the Socialists' recent record is more than
honourable. French economic growth is significantly better and more
consistent than Britain's, French inflation is regularly much lower, and
France is much more prosperous.
No one would deny the pain of high and rising unemployment; but French
unemployment is in the same ball park as Britain's. The same goes for
immigration. The school system is vastly superior, and the health system is
ruinously luxurious. In comparative terms, France's problems simply do not
justify this degree of anguish.
Some French analysts have taken a stern moral line. Some of them blame the
politicians: the French voted to reject all the traditional parties of
government, because they are nauseated by the stench of corruption. Others
blame the French people: the scandalous National Front vote marks the French
as the black sheep of Europe, in the same shameful league as the Austrians.
Neither thesis will quite do. A Figaro exit poll said that many more people
(41 per cent) were influenced by their revulsion at the political scandals
than by high unemployment (24 per cent). But a Liberation poll said
unemployment was the top factor for 38 per cent, while the scandals only
influenced 12 per cent. You pays your money . . .
The thesis of a rotten streak in the French body politic is troubling.
History testifies to a resilient extreme right-wing strand in France; there
have also been periods of violent anti-Semitism and xenophobia. These two
tendencies reached a shameful acme in the Second World War, when Vichy
France fell over itself to co-operate with the Nazis. But to infer from last
week's elections that there is a moral flaw in the heart of France is going
too fast.
The National Front vote is a symptom of political disturbance: it does not
mean France is going fascist. More than 40 per cent admit to racist
feelings; yet France is clearly ashamed of half-buried memories of episodes
in its history, and it is striking how often the media dig up skeletons,
such as the practice of torture in the Algerian war, or the brutal
deportation of Jewish children to Germany in the Second World War *,
manifestly for purposes of expiation.
The central revelation of the election is the collective rejection of all
the traditional parties of government. All polls say that French politicians
seem aloof and elitist, talking a wooden, bureaucratic jargon. Their
corruption may be distasteful; what is really alienating is their
self-satisfied Parisian remoteness.
But the politicians' failure lies more in their policies than in their
style. The Socialists have abandoned socialism; they have yet to devise a
new message. The conservatives have only one message: Get Rid of the
Socialists.
The reasons for this policy vacuum lie in the European Community.
Macroeconomic policy, the traditional centre-piece of political debate,
whether in a left-right context or in a Keynesian-classical dialectic, has
been removed from the control of national politics. Mainline French
politicians scarcely discuss economic policy, because there is nothing much
left to discuss.
As a result, the Community has shaken the perceived political legitimacy of
the nation state. This is especially destabilising in France, which is
founded on an intensely normative image of the commanding state and the
integrationist republic. Last Sunday, 27.2 per cent voted against Europe, or
41.1 per cent if you include the ecologists.
President Francois Mitterrand will go down in history as a great European.
But he will go down in flames at home, unless his party can devise a new
political message which recreates national legitimacy in a European context.
And the first priority in that message will be a plausible answer to
unemployment; socialism may be discredited, but the Community will not last
long if unemployment is once again regarded as an Act of God or of Adam
Smith.
