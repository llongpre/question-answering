Roman Vishniac, who as a young scientist in Eastern Europe produced a 
poignantly powerful series of photographs that recorded the faces of fellow 
Jews approaching their doom, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
The zoologist and biologist, who later in his life concentrated on the minute 
life seen only through a microscope, was 92 when he died Monday in his New York 
City apartment of the complications of colon cancer. 
</P>
<P>
In 1935, Vishniac, who held a doctorate in zoology, embarked on a 5,000-mile, 
three-year odyssey that took him through the terror-stricken ghettos of Eastern 
Europe, photographing the ravaged and haunted faces of a people that were 
unknowingly about to disappear in the Nazi slaughters of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"He used to say he took Hitler seriously and therefore he took the pictures," 
said a relative, Jesse Cherry. "Everything he photographed was subsequently 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
Born in Russia, Vishniac turned from medical science photography to the eyes of 
undernourished children, of bearded patriarchs, of families in tattered 
clothing buying an occasional apple to supplement their meager daily fare. 
</P>
<P>
What remained of his collection after he fled to the United States in 1940 was 
ultimately displayed in art museums and libraries around the world and praised 
not only for the tragedy it mirrored but for the starkness and lighting of his 
presentations. 
</P>
<P>
Vishniac first became interested in both science and photography as a boy when 
he photographed a cockroach's leg through a microscope. 
</P>
<P>
After he moved to Berlin in the 1920s he had to pose as a Nazi, for any Jew 
with a camera was suspect. 
</P>
<P>
After fleeing Germany he was interned briefly in a Vichy concentration camp in 
France but managed to obtain visas and escaped to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
He was unable to speak English but still eked out a living as a portrait 
photographer before launching yet another career as a microphotographer. He won 
prizes for pictures that ranged from insects to frost on a leaf. 
</P>
<P>
In 1971, the International Fund for Concerned Photography mounted an exhibition 
of Vishniac's photographs that also included his scientific work, such as 
polarized light shots of microscopic creatures. 
</P>
<P>
In an introduction to the exhibition, the photographer Edward Steichen wrote: 
"Roman Vishniac came back from his trips to Eastern Europe in the 1930s with a 
collection of photographs that has become an important historical document, for 
it gives a last-minute look at the human beings he photographed just before the 
fury of Nazi brutality exterminated them. The resulting photographs are among 
photography's finest documents of a time and place." 
</P>
<P>
Vishniac's works are included in the permanent collections of the Museum of 
Modern Art in New York, the Smithsonian Institution and the Library of Congress 
in Washington and the Jewish Museum in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Another book of photographs of Jewish life is still to be published, said his 
daughter, Mara Kohn of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
He also is survived by his wife, Edith, four grandchildren and five 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles said in a statement: 
"He was a visionary who understood that what his lens captured in pre-World War 
II Poland would be the last images of a vanished world. His photographs 
captured the life and soul of a people."
