THE JOY LUCK CLUB (15) Wayne Wang
ON DEADLY GROUND (18) Steven Seagal
MY LIFE (12) Bruce Joel Rubin
PETAIN (12) Jean Marboeuf
The Joy Luck Club confirms that the most lethal device in movies is the
flashback. Gather your audience. Sit it down before a teeming screenful of
Chinese-American women celebrating 20-odd years of togetherness in San
Francisco. And then pull the time-space levers.
Suddenly there is a rush of wind and an upward flight of popcorn. The
filmgoer is plummeting into the past, where the film's four main matriarchs
re-enact the formative agonies of life in the East: those that drove them
toward the putative ecstasy of life in America. Nor do the film's
interdimensional free falls end there. After each trip we return to the
present only to be trapdoored a shorter distance into the daughters' early
lives in the West. One marries a bedhopping playboy, another a
penny-pinching control freak. A third tries to break free of her mother's
emotional hold . . .
Chinese-American film-maker Wayne Wang, whittling down novelist Amy Tan's
doorstopping bestseller for the screen, succeeds beyond reasonable
expectation. As Wang's early films showed (Chan Is Missing, Dim Sum), he has
a photographer's eye for finding distinctive faces and using light to sculpt
them to comic or poignant effect.
After ten minutes of mild confusion, we feel we know these eight women as
well as they know each other. Better still: we want to know more about them
and about the raw emotions that lie behind the refined social masks. France
Nuyen is the playboy-marrying daughter, carrying her sadness behind a
curtain of dark hair. Tamlyn Tomita (of Come See The Paradise) is the
childhood chess prodigy who grows up to be outflanked by life and love. Best
of all, Tsai Chin is the sternly stoical mother who still wears the scars of
the arranged marriage she endured - and escaped - in childhood.
This story produces the film's funniest single flashback moment: the first
sighting of her groom. Fearing an older man, the girl looks up to glimpse
something even worse - a fat boy carrying a large grin and a pet iguana.
'Maybe I prayed too hard,' murmurs her voice-over narration.
The scene typifies Wang's haiku-like economy with word and image. However
kleenex-intensive some stories are, however hard the string section soars
and sighs, The Joy Luck Club has the hard bright light of human reality.
Produced by Oliver Stone, this is the East-meets-West film that Heaven And
Earth should have been. Produced for Disney, it shows this studio can make
films with a mature emotional glow for adults as well as sparklers and
schmaltz packages for the young.
'What does it take to change the essence of a man?' philosophises someone in
the Alaska-set thriller On Deadly Ground. Two possible answers. One: a deep
emotional or spiritual experience. Or two, as in the case of the film's
villain played by Michael Caine, a pint of black hairdye and some deep-tan
face make-up. Not to mention an accent poised somewhere between Nebraska and
Neasden. Given Caine's new portly frame, he looks like Robert Maxwell
ventriloquised by a bad Cary Grant impersonator.
This evil oil tycoon wishes to shortcut safety procedures on his new
platform, so that he can open it before the expiry date is reached on his
drilling licence. Otherwise the land will revert to the Eskimos. 'Eskimo'
here means a fur-clad actor speaking in a rare language called Eco-babble:
this runs to sentences like: 'The great bear will sigh in the grass if the
white devil poisons our watery hunting ground . . .'
'The hell with the gahd-dam Eskimos,' raves Caine. But his ace
troubleshooter and fire-fighter Mr Seagal thinks differently. Furrowing
eyebrows that already look as if they were knitted on a grim day by Mme
Defarge, he joins the Eskimo cause and even one of their tribes. (Cue
interlude of ethno-romantic rapprochement a la Dances With Wolves). From
here, clad in a native fur ensemble that would cost Dollars 1000 on Rodeo
Drive, our hero marches forth to destroy the rig and Mr Caine in a climax
that is almost as enjoyable as it is ridiculous.
Did we mention that Seagal directed this film? And that he delivers its
astonishing closing speech, in which the entire industrial world is taken to
task for using fossil fuels 100 years after they could have been made
obsolete. As we all know today, cars can be driven on methane or hot air or
wave-power or possibly even two 1.5V batteries rubbed together. So why
aren't they? Mr Seagal is furious, and he is backed up here by Warner Bros:
a studio not yet noted for its fleet of methane-fuelled limousines, but
certainly known for the supplies of hot air used to energise some other
vehicles.
Not all in movies is new green hope for the morrow. The terminal ward of
western cinema is still busy, with Michael Keaton checking into one of the
bedspaces recently vacated by Debra (Shadowlands) Winger and Tom
(Philadelphia) Hanks. In My Life, written and directed by ex-Ghost scenarist
Bruce Joel Rubin, cancer patient Keaton has only a few months to live;
though it seems longer to us as we watch the ailing Los Angeles PR executive
video-record his life and thoughts for the yet-unborn child of his pregnant
wife Nicole Kidman.
'How to play basketball', 'How to cook spaghetti' and 'How to enter a room'
(sic) are some of the chapters in this audiovisual primer. And he could have
included one on 'How to keep a press show audience fidget-less in its
seats.' Sentimentality is rampant. Not content with being the grim
lens-wielder of Beverly Hills, Keaton must be allowed several reels of
drooling over his newborn child. (Yes, he lives long enough to annoy the
maternity ward by video-recording the birth.) He also has a Mom and Pop with
whom he must patch up old grudges before the curtain-time.
How the rich and self-obsessed die is, of course, one of the great subjects
of American cinema. But even by movieland's standards of maudlin
self-massage, My Life is heavy-duty material.
Keaton does his best with the terminal make-up and stoical wisecracks. But
Miss Kidman, a bright, sensible actress, looks deepeningly unhappy as she
passes from underscripted wife to underscripted mother while wearing the
chic-est maternity smocks in California.
No escape this week even at the arthouse. Given the few foreign-language
films that enter Britain, how remarkable that Petain can be among them.
'Pedestrian' is an understatement for this walking-wounded movie recreating
the sad story of Vichy France. Jean Dufilho is Petain, a white moustache
delivering a series of beleaguered dicta; Jean Yanne is the growl and five
o'clock shadow called Laval (Petain's Hitler-supporting premier, later
executed by the Allies); and Jean Marboeuf is the director of a film that
lasts 2 1/4 -hours and never varies its history-class-for-idiots pacing.
