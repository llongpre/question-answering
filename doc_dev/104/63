   Glynis Johns is a perfectionist about acting _
precise, analytical and opinionated about a profession she has
worked at all her life.
   That quest for perfection can be seen in the current Broadway
revival of ``The Circle,'' W. Somerset Maugham's nearly 70-year-old
romantic comedy about love, marriage and fidelity, which also stars
Rex Harrison and Stewart Granger.
   Johns plays Lady Kitty, a fading beauty who years ago left her
husband (Granger) and young son and ran off with Lord Porteous
(Harrison). Now the wayward couple has returned, and Lady Kitty
watches as her daughter-in-law, Elizabeth, prepares to leave with
another man. History is about to repeat itself.
   In the play's most touching scene, the seemingly frivolous Lady
Kitty counsels the young woman about sacrificing her life for a
love that may not last. ``The tragedy of love is not separation or
death,'' she says. ``The tragedy of love is indifference.''
   Their encounter is the high spot of the play, a touching moment
in what until then has been a light 1920s drawing room comedy.
   ``Lady Kitty is one of the most difficult, challenging parts
I've had to play _ if you want to play it many-faceted,'' says
Johns.
   Which, of course, she does. Anything else would be giving less
than her all.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, I'm not interested in playing the
role on only one level,'' she says. ``The whole point of
first-class acting is to make a reality of it. To be real. And I
have to make sense of it in my own mind in order to be real.
   ``I've never seen anyone play this part in the way I'm playing
it. And I didn't realize at the beginning which way I was going to
go, but it grew and it grew and it's evolved.''
   The challenge, she says, was to come in and out of what she
calls the character's ``flaky, Billie Burke, surface kind of
comedy'' and a moment later show Kitty's real depth.
   ``In real life, we act according to the cue. We can appear
irritable and slightly unpleasant or we can appear terribly
good-natured and flaky and frothy and rather lacking in depth.
   ``Or we can, when it is demanded of us, go into a depth of
wisdom and compassion. That is an all-rounded person. I expect that
there are people who don't have all those sides but there are many
people who do, and I think that Kitty is one who does.''
   Johns always has been part of the theater. She's the fourth
generation of an English theatrical family. Her father, Mervyn
Johns, had a long career as a character actor. Her mother was a
pianist. And now the actress' son is also in the profession.
   Johns was a dancer at 12, an actress at 14 in London's West End.
There were countless stage appearances and scores of movies in
England and Hollywood ranging from ``Mary Poppins'' to ``The
Chapman Report'' to ``The Sundowners.''
   Johns is the only member of ``The Circle'' company to have
worked before with Maugham. She did a film called ``Encore,'' based
on one of his short stories. The actress met the famous writer in
the south of France at Vichy, where he always took the waters for a
liver problem.
   ``The place was like a morgue,'' she recalls. ``Some of the
people were quite gloomy and odd-looking. I was quite young and
bright at the time. I said to him, `This must be very depressing
for you coming here every year.' And he answered: `Oh that's
nothing compared to the old ladies who come down in their
wheelchairs with their Pekingese dogs. They force the jaws of the
dogs open and pour the Vichy water into them. They don't take it
themselves.'
   ``The thought of that made him laugh,'' she said.
   ``The Circle'' is Johns' first Broadway appearance since 1973.
The last time she graced a New York stage was as the world-weary
Desiree Armfeldt in Stephen Sondheim's ``A Little Night Music.''
   The musical had gone into rehearsal with some of the book and
score unfinished, including a solo song for Johns. The actress had
specific thoughts about how her character should be portrayed.
Director Hal Prince suggested she and co-star Len Cariou improvise
a scene or two to give book writer Hugh Wheeler some ideas.
   ``Hal said `Why don't you just say what you feel,''' she
recalls. ``When Len and I did that, Hal got on the phone to Steve
Sondheim and said, `I think you'd better get in a cab and get round
here and watch what they're doing because you are going to get the
idea for Glynis' solo.'''
   In one night, Sondheim wrote ``Send in the Clowns,'' possibly
the best-known Sondheim song of all time. It also was a perfect
marriage of performer and material.
   ``I've had other songs written for me, but nothing like that,''
Johns says. ``It's the greatest gift I've ever been given in the
theater.''
   Until ``The Circle,'' the actress had never worked with Harrison
although they had met years ago and had a lot of mutual friends. He
was the reason she did the play.
   ``Rex is wonderfully, innately talented, and it's a gift that
God gives you,'' she says. ``You don't learn what he's got.''
   Is she fussy now about the roles she chooses?
   ``It depends on how well-stocked my bank balance is,'' she says.
``I've retired many times. My personal life has come before my
work. The theater is just part of my life. It probably uses my
highest sense of intelligence, so therefore I have to come back to
it, to realize that I've got the talent. I'm not as good doing
anything else.''
