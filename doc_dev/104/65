President Francois Mitterrand said last night he would resign if his
prostate cancer were to make 'me more concerned about my fate than that of
the state'. But he stressed that this was not the case and hoped to finish
his term next May. The ailing 77-year-old French president quipped that he
was 'very flattered' by all the stock market rumours of his demise or
indisposition against which he said he was 'a bit armoured' or inured.
So far, he said, the only interruption to his presidential duties had come
last July when, two days after his second operation, he had had to skip one
cabinet meeting. In a long television interview aimed at clarifying recent
claims and revelations about his health and his association with the Vichy
administration in 1942 and subsequently with some of its members, Mr
Mitterrand said: 'I took the opposite path to most people in moving from
right to left.' His bourgeois background, which he said he shared with 'most
Socialist leaders', had initially inclined him towards conservative
politics, and he admitted he had been 'a bit slow in my evolution' towards
the left.
