<LEADPARA>  IF YOU number among the 73 percent of adults who don't want to hear another
thing about Madonna, our apologies.;    For this is devoted exclusively to
Madonna Louise Veronica Ciccone, who last year grossed $39 million, $4 million
of which she used to produce "Madonna: Truth or Dare." The movie follows her
through last year's Blond Ambition Tour, from Japan to Canada to New York to
Europe.  </LEADPARA>

CONVERSATION
LIKE A MADONNA FAN: ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     It's a mockumentary in which Madonna comes off as a complete control freak.
"I have a fascistic side," she admits.;    Madonna bares her breasts, but not
her soul.;    In a similar spirit of sincerity, then, we give you: Everything
You Ever Wanted to Know About "Truth or Dare" or: How to Fake Your Way Through
a Conversation About the Movie Without Actually Having to Pay $6.50 to See
It.;    (check) OVEREXPOSURE: The coming attractions trailer for "Truth or
Dare" was nearly rated NC-17, but the movie itself is pretty tame. One flash
of female nudity. Three brief flashes of male nudity. One gay French kiss. Six
crotch grabs. Three nose picks.;    (check) VICHY SUAVE: You have to sit
through practically the whole movie to get to the scene with the bottle of
Vichy water (on which Madonna demonstrates certain skills, then swallows the
water).;    (check) IMMATERIAL GIRL: Besides the infamous dig at Kevin Costner
(Madonna gags when he says her show was "neat"), she also dishes Belinda
Carlisle, Oprah Winfrey, Joey Heatherton, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson and
Zsa Zsa Gabor. (Zsa Zsa, she says, is a cochon, which means "pig" in French.);
   (check) BARNYARD HUMOR: The only thing close to an intimate revelation
comes from Sandra Bernhard (or, as one dancer calls her, Sandra Barnyard), who
refers to her souring relationship with another woman during lunch in
Madonna's hotel room.;    (check) LOVE AND LUST: Asked who the true love of
her life is, Madonna replies simply, "Sean." The lust of her life (or at least
of the European leg of her tour) is actor Antonio Banderas, star of many a
Pedro Almodovar film. At a party in Madrid, Madonna discovers Antonio is
(eek!) married and thinks about drowning herself in a toilet. Talk about women
on the edge of a nervous breakdown.;    (check) HAIR APPARENT: Madonna gets
her hair done a lot. The best scene among all the bleachings, brushings and
braidings is when she sits with it stuffed inside a plastic bag, talking to
her dad on the phone. "We'll come to any performance we can have tickets for,"
he says to her. "Daaaaad. This is my show," she responds. "I can get you
tickets to anything you want.";    (check) SORE THROAT: Madonna also sucks on
a lot of lozenges (most notably in her before-show prayer sessions with her
band of disciple singer-dancers), and she spritzes her throat almost
obsessively when she's backstage. We assume all this is to help her voice.;   
(check) JADED BEATTY: The best line in the movie belongs to then-paramour
Warren Beatty. Madonna is having her throat examined in the kitchen of her New
York apartment. The doctor asks, "Do you want to talk off-camera?" Beatty, out
of camera range, retorts, "She doesn't want to live off-camera, much less
talk.";    (check) DETAILS, DETAILS: "Truth or Dare" sums itself up nicely in
two quick scenes. In one, everyone in Madonna's entourage is wearing a Madonna
T-shirt -- except for Madonna, who sports a Jesus T. In another, Madonna leans
back in bed, the picture of the relaxed confidante. Only she's got a
microphone clipped to her robe.;    Next on the agenda for "Truth or Dare"
director Alek Keshishian is a feature-length pop opera of "Wuthering Heights."
(He did a shorter version of the project while a student at Harvard, using
songs from Madonna's "True Blue.");    Penciled in on Madonna's to-do list are
biographical films about other strong women: Mexican surrealist painter Frida
Kahlo, poet Anne Sexton, chanteuse Edith Piaf, dancer Martha Graham. And yes,
she'd like to play them herself.;    She'd also like to try her hand at
writing poetry ("There once was a girl from Detroit/With bottles she was quite
adroit . . . ") and stories. "I'd like to do a collection of erotic short
pieces," she says. "Madonna's Bedtime Stories.";    Sleep tight.  </TEXT>
