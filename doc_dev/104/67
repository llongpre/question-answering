   A former Nazi was acquitted Thursday of
complicity in the murder of 177 French Jews sent to Auschwitz, a
verdict that drew shouts of ``Nazi murderer!'' from victims'
relatives and spectators.
   Count Modest Korff was accused of ordering the deportations of
Jews from the Chalons-sur-Marne region of northeastern France, where
he served as Gestapo chief in 1942 and 1943.
   State Court Judge Martin Lickfett said the five-member panel
decided there was insufficient evidence to tie Korff to the deaths
of 177 people he was accused of deporting.
   ``The proceedings were interrupted by shouts of `Nazi murderer!'
and `this is a Nazi court!''' said a court spokeswoman, Eva Marie
Zakosek-Ruehling.
   Korff, 79, left the courtroom after the verdict was read and
could not immediately be reached for comment. Phone calls to his
home in the Bonn suburb of Koenigswinter were not answered.
   During the trial, Korff claimed he did not know about the
extermination of Jews when he served as Gestapo chief in
Nazi-occupied France. The Nazis killed an estimated 6 million Jews
during their rule from 1933 to 1945.
   Ms. Zakosek-Ruehling said the defendant showed no emotion during
announcement of the verdict or the outbursts from spectators who
packed the small courtroom in central Bonn. The panel was composed
of two jurors and three judges.
   About 20 French relatives of Nazi victims were among the
spectators, as well as French Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld.
Spectators said the French spectators included relatives of those
whom Korff was accused of deporting.
   Klarsfeld led prosecutors to Korff.
   Klarsfeld and the others who had traveled from France stormed out
of the courtroom to show their disapproval of the verdict, Ms.
Zakosek-Ruehling said in an interview with The Associated Press.
   Until his retirement in the early 1970s, Korff served as a
ministerial adviser with the West German Economics Ministry. He was
free during the trial, which began in September 1987.
   The acquittal follows a period of extreme sensitivity over
Germany's Nazi past after last week's 50th anniversary of
Kristallnacht, when Nazi thugs destroyed Jewish homes and businesses
and beat up Jews.
   Jewish community leaders were outraged by a speech in which
Parliament President Philipp Jenninger referred to the early Nazi
years as ``glorious'' in an attempt to explain Hitler's initial
appeal to the German public.
   Jenninger, a member of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian
Democrat party, was forced to resign the next day.
   There have also been a number of desecrations of Jewish monuments
and cemeteries reported after the Kristallnacht observances.
