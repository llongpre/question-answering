   France commemorated the 20th anniversary of Charles
de Gaulle's death Friday with a respect and affection that eluded
the former war hero and president in his final years.
   Throughout the country, religious services, exhibitions,
symposiums, television programs and plays paid tribute to de Gaulle
as leader of French resistance to Nazi occupation and founder of
the current constitutional system with its strong president.
   In contrast to his sometimes tempestuous presidency from 1959 to
1969, De Gaulle now is admired by Frenchmen of all political
persuasions.
   A poll published Thursday in the newspaper Le Monde said 84
percent of the respondents believe de Gaulle's record in office was
``positive.''
   The near-universal admiration contrasts with the general's last
years, when students and workers rioted in the streets.
   De Gaulle's unpopularity culminated in a humiliating defeat at
the polls in 1969 and drove him from the presidency.
   Nineteen months later, on Nov. 9, 1970, while playing solitaire
at his home in Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises, de Gaulle suffered a
ruptured aneurism and died.
   The following afternoon his son, Philippe, went on television to
announce, ``General de Gaulle is dead, France is a widow.''
   Only his family, close wartime colleagues and villagers attended
his funeral on Nov. 12, while dozens of heads of state attended
ceremonies at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris.
   Today, it is hard to find de Gaulle bashers. One exception is
``Recours-France,'' (Help-France) an organization of former French
residents of North Africa, many of whom lost everything when France
embarked on decolonization.
   ``For the French from Algeria ... he will forever be regarded as
the man who betrayed, mislead and abandoned us, without ever
pronouncing a single word of compassion for our tragic exodus,''
the organization said in a statement Friday.
   At the start of the Algerian revolution, de Gaulle pledged to
maintain French rule. He later granted independence to end the
bloodshed.
   Many ardent leftists have become de Gaulle admirers. Regis
Debray, a former adviser to Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand, described de Gaulle as ``the last great man of the 19th
century and the first great man of the 21st.''
   In a new book, ``A Demain de Gaulle,'' (Tomorrow, de Gaulle)
Debray - once a leading exponent of guerrilla warfare and a
champion of the late Che Guevara - paid homage to the general's
traditionalist values.
   Mitterrand himself paid tribute Friday, sending his army chief
to lay a wreath at de Gaulle's tomb in Colombey-les-deux-Eglises.
   Exhibitions and documentaries abound, including one on De
Gaulle's manipulation of the media for political purposes. Alain
Peyrefitte, De Gaulle's information minister, has said De Gaulle
himself edited television newscasts and used the media ``as an
instrument of power.''
   This month also marks the first time De Gaulle's life and
achievements have been presented in fiction.
   Based on a forgotten scenario by William Faulkner, one of de
Gaulle's most fervent admirers, director Denys Granier-Deferre has
made a TV movie recounting the war years.
   A lesser-known side of de Gaulle is depicted in ``Villa Luco,''
a play about de Gaulle's secret visit to elderly, ailing Marshall
Philippe Petain, condemned to life imprisonment for collaborating
with the Nazis.
   This year also marks the 100th anniversary of de Gaulle's birth
and the 50th anniversary of his famed radio appeal from London for
Frenchmen to resist the Nazis.
