   A court ruled Monday that a Frenchman accused of
sending 194 Jewish children to their deaths in Nazi camps can be
tried for war crimes.
   Rene Bousquet, 81, who is accused of crimes against humanity,
was national police chief under the collaborating Vichy government
in World War II.
   Appeals Court Judge Albert Moatty decided Monday that Bousquet
can be tried by an ordinary court.
   State prosecutors in September asked that Bousquet be
investigated in connection with the childrens' deportation.
   A lower court held in Paris last month that Bousquet could be
tried only by the High Court of the Liberation, formed in 1944 to
prosecute officials of the government under Nazi occupation. That
court has been defunct for decades.
   Moatty's ruling allowed state prosecutors to resume their
investigation of evidence uncovered by Nazi-hunters.
   The International League Against Racism and Anti-Semitism hailed
the decision. ``France is a great country, capable of looking into
the dark times of its past,'' the group said in a statement.
   The lower court's ruling had infuriated human rights activists,
who feared Bousquet would escape prosecution.
   Rights leaders say no high-ranking French officials directly
involved in deporting and arresting 100,000 Jews during the war
have been brought to trial.
   Serge Klarsfeld, a lawyer and prominent Nazi-hunter, has said
senior government officials, including President Francois
Mitterrand, appear reluctant to pursue the case.
   Bousquet was condemned in 1949 for alleged collaboration with
the Nazis, but was freed for ``acts accomplished in favor of the
Resistance.'' He freed some jailed Resistance fighters when he was
ousted from his post.
   A federation of human rights groups organized an inquiry
commission to determine why cases against Bousquet and two other
suspected war criminals, Paul Touvier and Maurice Papon, have taken
so long.
   Touvier, 75, is being prosecuted for his activities as a
pro-Nazi militia chief in Lyon. He was captured last year after
spending years hiding out with the help of right-wing Roman
Catholic monks.
   Charges against Papon, a former budget minister, have been
pending for seven years. He has been accused of being responsible
for the arrests and deportations of 1,700 Jews while a wartime
administrator in Bordeaux.
