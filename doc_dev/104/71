   For French Jews, flourishing more than at any time
in their history, the desecration of tombstones in a southern town
was a brutal reminder of France's long, sordid history of
anti-Semitism.
   From the conviction of army officer Alfred Dreyfus nearly 100
years ago to roundups of Jews by French police during World War II
to the bombing of a Paris synagogue in 1980, anti-Semitism remains
a major fear among French Jews.
   ``Anti-Semitism is a dormant volcano whose eruptions are never
predictable,'' wrote political analyst Robert Sole.
   This week's vandalism and mutilation of a recently buried corpse
in Carpentras came in an era of renewed Jewish pride in France.
   It also coincided with the steady rise of the extreme-right
National Front, a party that has rallied an estimated 15 percent of
voters around an anti-immigrant, racist platform that also targets
Jews.
   Its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, prides himself on ``saying out
loud what everybody is thinking to themselves.'' He has joked about
the Nazis' crematoriums and called the gas chambers ``a detail''
whose existence was still ``being debated by historians.''
   He regularly rails against ``Jewish lobbies,'' and frequently
accuses the media of being dominated by Jews.
   His followers deny their policies fuel racial hatred and
anti-Semitism, but French Jews aren't so sure.
   Traumatized by World War II, which saw the deportation of some
117,000 Jews from France to Nazi concentration camps, a community
of guilt-ridden survivors harbored fears of new persecution.
   After the war, many renounced their Jewish identities, changed
their names, refused to circumcise baby boys or to give their
children Jewish educations.
   Today, Jewish life is thriving. In the past 15 years, the number
of synagogues in the Paris area has jumped from 30 to 70. In 1950
there were three kosher butchers. Today there are more than 100.
Kosher restaurants, fast-food outlets, supermarkets and
professional caterers are too numerous to be counted.
   Jewish publications boast more readers than ever, and 13 radio
stations broadcast Hebrew and Yiddish songs, cultural and news
commentaries.
   The revival is due largely to the 150,000 Sephardic Jews from
Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia who poured into France during the
1950s and 1960s as the French colonies won independence.
   The Sephardim _ Jews of Spanish origin as opposed to Jews from
Eastern Europe known as Ashkenazic _ make up more than 60 percent
of France's population of about 650,000 Jews. That is possibly the
world's third-largest Jewish community after the United States and
Israel, since immigration has reduced the number of Jews in the
Soviet Union.
   Besides their own folklore and cuisine, the Sephardim brought an
unconditional commitment to Judaism and a demand for Jewish culture
in France.
   In the three decades since they arrived, they have become as
prominent in French life as their Ashkenazic counterparts, enjoying
enviable positions in industry, government, the media and the arts.
