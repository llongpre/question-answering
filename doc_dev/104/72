14 MONDAY
Middle East peace talks
Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation are due to resume talks in
Paris and Egypt. They hope to build on last week's breakthrough concerning
security accords in Cairo.
In Paris, the two sides are expected to continue hammering out an agreement
on trade, taxation, currency, finance and banking. In Egypt, they will seek
to conclude discussions on the role of a Palestinian police force and the
transfer of civilian administration from Israeli to Palestinian hands.
Sutherland to meet de Klerk
South Africa's integration into the international community continues with a
visit by Gatt chief Peter Sutherland (left).
He will discuss economic reform with President F. W. de Klerk and the
African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
Albania's foreign minister
Albania's foreign minister Alfred Serreqi holds talks in Athens on
co-operation with the European Union and bilateral issues. It is the first
visit by a senior Albanian official since Greece's socialist government took
over in October.
The two countries have been on bad terms since last summer over alleged
mistreatment of the Greek minority in Albania and expulsions from Greece of
Albanian workers.
Kazakhstan president
Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev meets US president Bill Clinton in
Washington. Considered the most effective reformer in the former soviet
republics, Nazarbayev will press for a greater share of western assistance
to the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Lloyd's compensation offer
Today is the official deadline for loss-making Lloyd's Names to accept the
insurance market's Pounds 900m out-of-court settlement offer, but Lloyd's is
expected to extend it. The insurance market has said the proposed settlement
would be withdrawn unless it was accepted by loss-making Names whose
individual deals account for at least 70 per cent of the Pounds 900m on
offer. However, if a significant number of Names accept the deal, a short
extension of the offer period may be considered.
UK National Lottery
Bids from companies interested in running the national lottery must be in by
midday.
Valentine's Day
Postal services, greeting card manufacturers, and restaurateurs are hoping
for record business from the festival of romance.
Holidays
Brazil, some states in Germany (Carnival), Luxembourg (Shrove Monday).
15 TUESDAY
Major and Hurd in Moscow
UK prime minister John Major and defence secretary Douglas Hurd begin two
days of talks in Moscow. They will try to persuade Russian president Boris
Yeltsin that the Nato ultimatum threatening air strikes against Serbian
forces does not signal a break with the West's commitment to a negotiated
settlement in Bosnia.
Mr Major will also stress that western financial support for President
Yeltsin depends on reform continuing. Mr Hurd plans to hold a meeting with
the leaders of the three Baltic states in the Latvian capital Riga.
Belarus protest
Committees at some 22 enterprises plan a one-day protest to demand the
resignation of the conservative government and early elections. Stanislav
Shushkevich, ousted as head of state last month, has said elections are the
only way to stop market reforms from being blocked by bureaucrats who do not
want to let go of economic power.
Japanese budget
The Hosokawa government adopts a final budget for the fiscal year starting
on April 1. The finance ministry has called for austerity following the
record Y15,250bn (Dollars 1.4bn) pump-priming package. The ministry's draft
calls for a 1 per cent rise in total outlays to Y73,081bn.
Middle East bilateral peace talks
Middle East bilateral peace talks between Israel and Syria, Jordan, Lebanon
and the Palestinians are due to resume in Washington. The Syrians,
Jordanians and Lebanese are trying to make progress with Israel towards a
comprehensive Middle East peace - the heart of which is an agreement on
Israeli withdrawal from the occupied Syrian Golan Heights in return for full
peace.
The Israeli-Palestinian talks will focus on agreeing a protocol for holding
Palestinian elections under the peace accord for Palestinian self-rule in
the Gaza Strip and West Bank area of Jericho.
Europe's steelmakers and the European Commission meet
Europe's steelmakers and the European Commission meet in Brussels to discuss
the continuing crisis in the industry. After December's controversial
agreement by European Union industry ministers, approving Ecu6.8bn (Pounds
5.1bn) of state aid in return for 5m tonnes of capacity cuts, non-aided
producers are holding back from offering capacity reductions. They want the
Commission to take a tougher line on subsidies.
UK manufacturing output
UK manufacturing output's rise in the past three months is expected to
continue, providing further evidence of economic recovery. The consensus
forecast for December's figures is an increase of 0.3 per cent on November.
The annual rate is expected to pick up to 3.5 per cent, from 2.5 per cent in
November.
Holidays Brazil, some states in Germany (Carnival).
16 WEDNESDAY
S Korea's message to US
South Korea's foreign minister Han Sung-joo (left) begins a visit to the US
(to Feb 19). It was originally planned as a trade trip in connection with
the creation of the North American Free Trade area. However, as Seoul
becomes increasingly concerned the war of words between the US and North
Korea may escalate into confrontation, Mr Han is likely to recommend the US
adopts a more conciliatory tone. On Saturday, he goes on to Mexico (to Feb
23).
UK retail price index
UK retail price index for January will be scrutinised, after last week's
surprise interest rate cut. As the Bank of England's quarterly inflation
report spoke of an 'asymmetric risk' that 'a rise in underlying inflation
seems more likely than a further fall', analysts will be looking for
evidence that the cut was justified.
The headline rate is expected to rise to 2.6 per cent, from 1.9 per cent in
December, as mortgage rate cuts in January 1993 drop out of the annual
figure. Underlying inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) is
expected to rise from 2.7 to 3 per cent.
Papal letter on the Family
The Pope's Letter for the Year of the Family is due to be published. The
100-page document develops the issues addressed in last October's encyclical
Veritatis Splendor, which attacked a relativistic approach to morality.
Padraig Flynn, European Union social affairs commissioner
Padraig Flynn, European Union social affairs commissioner, presents a
proposal on immigration and asylum policy to the Commission. It will
recommend that immigrants legally resident in any member state should have
the right to travel and to seek employment throughout the EU.
CDollars 14m charge
A former personal banking consultant with Royal Bank of Canada, Shamin
Alidina, is due to appear in a Toronto court on fraud charges involving
CDollars 14m (USDollars 11m). Ms Alidina is accused of removing money from
72 customer accounts over a period of five years on the pretext of buying
treasury bills. The bank has recovered CDollars 6.4m, but faces losses of
more than CDollars 7m. The customers are being repaid.
Holidays
Brazil (Ash Wednesday, banks closed in the morning).
17 THURSDAY
Cypriot leaders to meet
President Glafkos Clerides of Cyprus and Rauf Denktash, leader of the
breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north of the divided island, are due
to meet in Nicosia.
The talks are to be chaired by Joe Clark, the former Canadian prime
minister, now United Nations special envoy on Cyprus. Both leaders have
agreed to a UN plan on confidence-building measures to improve relations
between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities. These would include
re-opening Nicosia airport and giving the Greek side access to Varosha, a
suburb of Famagusta, after almost 20 years.
Bundesbank council meets
The policy-making council of the German central bank holds its regular
fortnightly get-together to review monetary policy and consider whether
interest rates should be reduced.
Markets have almost given up hope that the discount rate will be cut from
the 5.75 per cent at which it has been since October.
US Consumer price data
US Consumer price data for January have been exciting financial markets
since the Federal Reserve's recent decision to push interest rates up a
quarter-point last week.
The consensus expectation is for a 0.3 per cent rise on the month. Anything
higher could spark fears of another Fed tightening in the next month or so,
although the figure may be distorted by bad weather last month.
Vichy era revisited
Paul Touvier, the 78-year-old former intelligence chief accused of
collaborating with the Nazis during the occupation of France, goes on trial
in Paris for crimes against humanity. He is charged with passing seven Jews
to the Gestapo. Touvier is the first Frenchman who held high office in the
Vichy government to be tried.
Saleroom
Charles Rennie Mackintosh is today hailed as a master of 20th century
design, but 40 years ago the Glasgow architect, craftsman, and artist was
out of fashion, and Thomas Howarth was able to accumulate his furniture,
drawings and watercolours cheaply.
Howarth's collection comes under the hammer at Christie's in London today.
Estimated prices range from Pounds 200, through Pounds 30,000 to Pounds
40,000 for the high-back oak chair (illustrated left), up to Pounds 300,000
for a mahogany writing cabinet designed in 1904. The sale is likely to bring
in more than Pounds 1m.
18 FRIDAY
Yeltsin unfolds his plans
Russian president Boris Yeltsin's first state of the nation address to the
joint chambers of parliament is expected to reveal his position on economic
reforms after changes to the composition of his government.
Fiji national elections start on Friday, and continue for the following
week. The poll was called in November by Sitiveni Rabuka, the prime
minister, after his coalition government saw its 1994 budget defeated.
The election is likely to see Mr Rabuka's dominant Fiji Political Party come
under pressure from the breakaway Fijian Association. Led by deputy prime
minister, Josevata Kamikamita, it was formed by the dissident MPs who forced
the budget's defeat.
UK money supply
After a long spell in the doldrums, the growth of the broad M4 measure has
picked up sharply in recent months, giving further evidence of economic
recovery.
The annual rate is expected to rise in January to an annual rate of 5.7 per
cent, from December's 5.5 per cent, but still well within the government's
3-9 per cent monitoring range.
19-20 WEEKEND
Nato ultimatum on Bosnia
Nato has said that it will attack from midnight on Sunday any artillery not
under UN control within 20km of Sarajevo, the beleaguered capital of Bosnia.
It would be the first time Nato has fired a shot in anger in its history.
French miners' unions
French miners' unions plan a protest in Paris on Saturday at what they see
as a government decision to accelerate the run-down of the coal industry and
to promote nuclear power.
Ulster peace process
John Major and Albert Reynolds, the UK and Irish prime ministers, meet on
Saturday for the first time since December to discuss strategy ahead of Sinn
Fein's conference in Dublin on February 26 to 27. Mr Reynolds will be in
London for the England-Ireland rugby match.
Five Nations' Rugby
England play Ireland at Twickenham and Wales play France in Cardiff on
Saturday
Cricket
England start the first test against the West Indies at Kingston, Jamaica on
Saturday.
