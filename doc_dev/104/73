   President Francois Mitterrand inaugurated a
museum devoted to peace Monday at the site of one of the world's
great battles, and said he hoped it would help unify Europe.
   Flanked by dignitaries, Mitterrand marked the 44th anniversary of
the D-Day invasion of Normandy by calling on world leaders to be
``masters of our history,'' united frustrating a resurgence of ``the
forces of intolerance and oppression.''
   He said the museum was intended to emphasize that unity is
essential to peace.
   ``Peace will be based not only on the superpowers but also on a
strong, independent Europe,'' he said.
   Among those at the ceremony were the first German delegation to
attend a D-Day anniversary and a multinational group of 160
schoolchildren.
   Three million men fought in the 76-day Battle of Normandy that
began June 6, 1944, and 367,000 were killed or wounded. Victory for
the Allies forced the Germans into retreat and marked a turning
point in the war.
   The glass-and-white-stone structure stands on a bluff in a suburb
of Caen, atop a bunker used as a German division headquarters during
the Allied invasion. Fractured granite lines the narrow entrance to
the spacious main hall.
   Caen, in the British sector of the invasion front, was among the
many Normandy cities leveled. The museum was the idea of Mayor
Jean-Marie Girault, who called it the crowning achievement of the
city's reconstruction.
   It contains a collection of war relics including a British
bomber, German tanks, old rifles and uniforms. The six exhibits,
assembled by a team of top French historians, seek to explain the
causes of the war rather than glorify its battles.
   World War II was the first great war fought over political
ideology, museum organizers said.
   ``Although we were fighting battles over real estate, the war was
really about ideological matters,'' said U.S. Rep. Sam Gibbons, a
Florida Democrat and member of the American delegation to the
ceremony.
   Gibbons, a captain in the 501st Parachute Infantry, dropped
behind German lines during the invasion. He is the only Normandy
veteran in Congress.
   Historians of the French Institute for the History of the
Present, who developed the exhibits, said they were intended to
balance the traditional depiction of various phases of the war in
French textbooks.
   Textbooks tend to glorify the Resistance, while skirting the role
played by the Vichy regime, collaborators and the foreign troops who
freed France, historian Denis Peschanski said.
   ``The idea of this museum is to give cause for reflection rather
than to make the traditional arguments and appeals to emotional
response,'' he said.
   Along with British, Canadian and American regular armies, the
Normandy invasion force included soldiers from Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Norway, Greece, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg and
France.
   Delegations from Italy, the Soviet Union and Japan also were
present Monday, including Yoshitaka Kawamato, director of the Peace
Museum at Hiroshima, Japan, site of the first nuclear bombing.
