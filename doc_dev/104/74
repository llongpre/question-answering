units

NESTLE, the Swiss food group, says it is in the final stage of negotiations
to sell to an unnamed buyer parts of Perrier, the French mineral water
company which it acquired last year after a complex takeover battle.
Nestle said in Paris last week that only preliminary talks were under way.
However, a spokesman at the group's headquarters in Switzerland insisted the
earlier statement was incorrect.
Any deal must be approved by European Commission competition authorities,
which last year ordered Nestle to dispose of a number of Perrier assets in
return for clearing the takeover.
The assets involve springs with a capacity of 3bn litres, including the
Vichy, Saint Yorre and Pierval brands. Brussels has stipulated they be sold
to a single buyer, though Nestle would not say whether it was dealing with
more than one bidder.
The Commission has also set an undisclosed deadline for the disposal. But
Nestle said the deadline was being treated in a flexible manner and could be
extended if necessary. Until the assets are sold, Nestle may not put into
effect an agreement to sell Volvic, one of Perrier's biggest brands, to BSN,
France's largest food company.
