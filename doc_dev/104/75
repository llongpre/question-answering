   Will Perrier's fizzle become
Saratoga's bubbles?
   If experts' predictions hold out, the recall of Perrier's
popular mineral water could be a boon to smaller competitors, such
as the Saratoga Springs Mineral Water Co.
   It's too early to tell if Saratoga Mineral Water will capture
some of the market dominated by the chic French brand. But initial
signs are sparkling, say officials at Evian Waters of France Inc.,
the parent company of the Saratoga Springs firm.
   ``More distributors are calling and placing orders,'' said David
Daniel, Evian's chief executive officer. ``It's busier than what
you'd normally expect.''
   Source Perrier SA recalled its water from worldwide distribution
this week after small amounts of a naturally occurring toxic gas
passed through a dirty filter and contaminated some bottles.
   Officials at Perrier's U.S. subsidiary have said they expect the
green bottles to be kept out of the United States for several
months.
   That will be a blow to Perrier, which built the U.S. sparkling
mineral water market nearly from scratch in the 1970s. Its Perrier
brand was the third biggest seller among all bottled water brands
and the leading imported brand sold in the United States in 1988,
accounting for 5.7 percent of the industry's $2.2 billion in sales,
according to Beverage Marketing Corp. in New York.
   It could mean big bucks for competitors.
   ``If competitors move quickly they'll benefit,'' said Hellen
Berry of Beverage Marketing.
   ``Perrier did a tremendous job getting into the market. But it's
going to be gone,'' Berry said. ``Something will have to fill the
void.''
   That something could be Saratoga Mineral Water, which plans to
launch a major new advertising campaign in the next few weeks.
   Daniel says the timing of the ad campaign and the Perrier recall
is just coincidence.
   ``They were primed to go on no matter what happened,'' Berry
said.
   Saratoga is no newcomer to the bottled water business. The
waters of Saratoga Springs have drawn visitors to this quaint town
for more than 200 years. According to folklore, George Washington
drank from the springs here.
   By the 1830s, a thriving social scene had grown up around the
springs. When Franklin Roosevelt was governor of New York, he
pushed the development several mineral water bath houses.
Roosevelt, a polio victim, was a regular user of the baths and
consumed the waters.
   Saratoga Mineral Water was first bottled in 1872 when the
then-Saratoga Vichy Co. developed a well near what is now the
Saratoga State Spa Park. The water came bubbling up from the ground
full of minerals and carbon dioxide percolated out of ancient
volcanic faults in the Adirondack Mountain foothills.
   Salt, bicarbonate of soda and artificial carbonation were added
to the spring water which was then bottled. It was a modest seller.
   The mineral water was eventually dropped in favor of a product
that was more competitive with its European counterparts.
   Saratoga Mineral Water is now sold in stores, restaurants and
bars in 23 states in the eastern half of the country.
   Daniel says the company is beginning to make a real push into
supermarkets, where the bulk of mineral water is sold. Perrier's
temporary absence may give Saratoga the edge it needs.
   ``Sales in bars and restaurants are good for your image. But
volume tends to be relatively small in relation to the volume you
can sell in major retail markets,'' Daniel said.
   Experts question whether the smaller bottled water companies are
strong enough to fill the temporary void left by Perrier.
   There are about 450 water bottling plants in the United States,
producing more than 600 different labels of drinking water, natural
water and spring water, according to Bevmark Inc., a Los
Angeles-based consulting firm. In addition, there are more than 50
brands of imported waters, Bevmark said.
   Berry said 1989 sales of Saratoga Mineral Water were greatly
improved over previous years but were still small compared to
Perrier's. She estimates last year's sales for Saratoga in the $10
million range. Perrier had sales in the United States of $150
million last year.
   Perrier officials say benzene, a chemical used in cleaning
solvents, entered its water in traces when workers failed to change
a pipe filter at the company's natural spring at Vergeze in
southern France.
   Earlier, Perrier had said it believed an employee mistakenly
used a product containing benzene to clean grease from one bottling
line.
