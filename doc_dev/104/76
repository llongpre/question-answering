Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, has named a veteran of
Honeywell's European restructuring programme to head JI Case, Tenneco's
largest division.
Mr Jean-Pierre Rosso, a 53-year-old from Vichy, France, will succeed Mr
Edward Campbell as Case's president. Mr Campbell will retire on March 31.
Mr Rosso's appointment is seen as a sign that Case is about to proceed with
an extensive rationalisation of its European operations, where its
construction and agricultural equipment lines have been battered by
competition and shrinking markets.
Case has just completed the first year of a three-year, Dollars 920m
restructuring programme designed to rescue the equipment manufacturer from
losses of Dollars 1bn in 1992. To date, the bulk of Case's rationalisations
and plant closings have been in North America.
Announcing Mr Rosso's appointment, Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's president, said
'a substantial amount of restructuring steps remain across all of Case's
worldwide operations'.
Twenty-five per cent of Case's business originates in Europe, mostly in the
UK, France, and Germany. Mr Mead, who remains chairman of Case, confirmed
rationalisations were expected beyond the previously-announced closure of
the Neuss tractor plant in mid-1996.
