   A top-level German court on Friday upheld the
acquittal of a former Nazi Gestapo chief accused ff complicity in
the murder of French Jews sent to the Auschwitz death camp.
   Count Modest von Korff, now 81, had been accused of ordering the
deportations of Jews from the Chalons-sur-Marne region of
northeastern France, where he served as the Nazi Gestapo chief in
1942 and 1943. He was accused in the deaths of 177 deportees.
   The Karlsruhe-based Federal Court of Justice said it had
reviewed the evidence and could not find any legal errors.
   Korff's case had attracted international attention, and Nazi
hunter Serge Klarsfeld was among the spectators when a trial court
acquitted the Gestapo boss two years ago in Bonn.
   During his trial, Korff claimed he did not know about the
extermination of Jews when he served as the secret police boss.
   The Nazis killed millions, including an estimated 6 million
Jews, between 1933 and 1945. Auschwitz, located in modern-day
Poland, was the most infamous of the Nazi concentration camps set
up by Adolf Hitler's Third Reich.
   Klarsfeld, the French Nazi hunter, had led prosecutors to Korff,
who had held a rank equivalent to captain during the war.
   The defendant served as an adviser to the West German Economics
Ministry until his retirement in the early 1970s. He lives in the
the Bonn suburb of Koenigswinter.
   About 20 relatives of the victims joined Klarsfeld in the
courtroom when the verdict was delivered in November 1988.
   Some of them cried out ``this is a Nazi court!'' and ``Nazi
murderer!'' when Judge Martin Lickfett read out the acquittal. It
was based on a finding that Korff did not know the reason for the
deportations and therefore was not guilty of the murder-relatd
charges.
   However, the victims' families had argued that Korff's assertion
that he thought the Jewish deportees were only being sent to work
details was simply not credible.
   To back up that claim, they told the court that Korff had also
deported children who were too young to be part of any work crews.
