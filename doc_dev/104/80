   Syrian officials expelled French Nazi hunter Serge
Klarsfeld on Friday after he sought to meet with President Hafez
Assad to demand the extradition of a Nazi war criminal, Klarsfeld's
wife said.
   Beate Klarsfeld said Syrian police arrived at her husband's
hotel Friday, took him to the airport and put him on a flight to
Vienna. She said he was expected to arrive in Paris on Friday night.
   For years, the Klarsfelds have been tracking Alois Brunner,
regarded as the most wanted Nazi criminal. The Austrian-born
Brunner was once an associate of Adolf Eichmann, who headed the
Jewish section of the Gestapo.
   Brunner was sentenced to death in France in absentia in 1954 for
taking part in the deportation to death camps of more than 120,000
Jews. His extradition has also been demanded by West Germany and
Poland.
   Klarsfeld was expelled from Syria in 1982, and his wife was not
allowed to enter the country in 1986.
   He arrived in Damascus on Tuesday on a business visa granted to
him as president of the organization Sons and Daughters of Deported
Jews of France, Mrs. Klarsfeld said.
   She said her husband had tried to rent a hall in Damascus to
hold an open debate and called on the Syrian Bar Association for
help.
   The Klarsfelds' accomplishments include tracking down Klaus
Barbie, the former Gestapo chief of Lyon who was tried and
sentenced to life in prison in 1986.
   Mrs. Klarsfeld said the bar association requested official
permission to hold the debate, which she believed led to her
husband's expulsion.
   Klarsfeld was ordered to stay in his hotel room Thursday night
and was not allowed to make or receive telephone calls, but he told
his wife Friday from Vienna he was not mistreated, Mrs. Klarsfeld
said.
   Mrs. Klarsfeld said Brunner is protected by Assad's personal
bodyguards.
   She said she had no word on whether the Syrian government
responded to a letter her husband wrote to Assad.
   ``I have come to Damascus as a Jew, as a survivor of the Nazi
genocide, to seek justice in the Brunner affair,'' Klarsfeld wrote.
``The argument that (Syrian authorities) know nothing about
Brunner's presence on Syrian territory has convinced no one.''
   Mrs. Klarsfeld made a copy of the letter public Thursday in
Paris. She said it was translated into Arabic by the French Embassy
in Damascus and delivered to the presidential palace and foreign
affairs ministry by an embassy messenger. She said it was refused
at both places.
   Klarsfeld also called on Assad to improve living conditions of
Syrian Jews and to allow them to leave their homeland if they want.
