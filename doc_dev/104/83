   Former Cabinet minister Maurice Papon has been
charged with crimes against humanity stemming from his World War II
service as a local official in Bordeaux, lawyers said.
   Papon, 79, who between 1942 and 1944 was secretary-general of
the Gironde prefecture near the southern city of Bordeaux, later
held many government posts, including police chief of Paris and
budget minister under former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
   In the early 1980s, families of Jews deported from the Bordeaux
area accused him of having allowed the arrest of 1,690 Jews who
were sent to Nazi death camps.
   Papon has denied the charges, which were first filed in 1983,
then dismissed last year because of a procedural mistake in the
investigation.
   Gerard Boulanger, lawyer for some of the families, disclosed the
renewed charges, saying they had been filed in July by
Investigating Magistrate Francois Braud, who advised only Papon and
his attorneys.
   Criminal charges in France are not made public, but judicial
sources often tell reporters.
   Lawyers for families of the deportees complained that the Papon
prosecution has been pursued too slowly and in great secrecy.
   ``If the goal is to let him die of old age, that would show a
refusal to judge anti-Jewish actions when it involves respectable
personalities from post-war French society,'' lawyer Serge
Klarsfeld was quoted as saying in the daily Liberation.
   Klarsfeld and his wife, Beate, were responsible for tracking
down Klaus Barbie, known as the ``Butcher of Lyon'' for his
activities as the Gestapo chief of the southern French city. Barbie
was convicted in 1987 of war crimes for the deportation of Jews to
Nazi death camps.
