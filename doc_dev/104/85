community

King Hassan's role as a bridge-builder in the Arab-Israel conflict is one
which, for one generation, deeply angered many of his Arab peers and often
puzzled western observers.
Ten years ago the Moroccan Jewish community hosted a conference on
Maimonides, the 12th century Jewish scholar who wrote his famous Guide to
the Perplexed in Arabic. It was the first such Jewish conference in an Arab
country for decades and Jews came from around the world, including Israel.
Some Labour and Likud members of parliament who had been born in the kingdom
attended, and a banquet to welcome the delegates was hosted by Sidi
Mohammed, the Moroccan crown prince.
While re-asserting support for the Palestinian cause, the king reiterated
his country's long-standing policy of protecting its Jewish citizens and
offered to mediate on talks between Israel, Arab nations and the
Palestinians. Syria promptly withdrew its ambassador to Morocco but the
event was a gesture to the Jewish community, a demonstration that Jews and
Arabs could sit down and talk to each other.
In the context of the Arab world the conference undercut hardline Arab
states such as Syria and Algeria and bolstered the moderate camp led by
Egypt, which in 1978 had signed the Camp David agreement, recognising
Israel.
Those familiar with Jewish history in Morocco were less surprised by the
move, though still impressed. Most of Morocco's Jewish community - which has
declined from 300,000 40 years ago to 8,000 today - descend from families
which fled the Spanish inquisition after the Christian reconquest of Granada
in southern Spain in 1492.
They are regarded as 'dhimmi', ie protected persons but first and foremost
as tribute bearers. Christians laboured under the same status at the time in
all Muslim states.
The Koran clearly states that non-Muslims are to be humbled. In the imperial
cities of Morocco this injunction was respected for many centuries. The
sumptuary laws were generally enforced. In addition to distinguishing
garments and restrictions on mounts, Jews had to walk barefoot in some
towns, in others only when passing in front of mosques. They were often
forced to do odious tasks as corvee labourers.
In the 16th century Leo Africanus, the travel writer, bears ample witness to
the contempt in which Jews in the cities were generally held. It would be
wrong, however, to conclude that they suffered more than the Christians and
much more than the rest of the population - most ordinary citizens were
frequent victims of pillage and rapine.
However, as elsewhere in north Africa, there is no obsession with the Jews
comparable to that found in medieval European literature, nor has there ever
been the persecution seen in Europe in modern times. Most traditional
Moroccan stereotypes of Jews may have been negative, but they were also
peripheral.
The mellahs, or Jewish ghettos, were usually built next to royal palaces to
make them easier to protect and the sultans frequently turned to the Jewish
community to help raise funds for projects or to negotiate treaties with
foreign powers. This role as 'tujjar al sultan' was a corollary of the
knowledge of foreign languages that many Jews had and their network of
relations in the wider world. Such links were of particular importance in a
country which for centuries turned its back on the Holy See and forced the
ambassadors of foreign powers to reside in the port of Tangiers, on the
strait of Gibraltar, summoning them to the courts in Fez or Marrakesh only
when their presence was required.
King Mohammed V, father of the present monarch, refused to give the Vichy
authorities a census list of Jews during the second world war. He ensured
that in those difficult years his Jewish subjects did not go unprotected.
After independence, for a brief while the government boasted a Jewish
minister. That is true again today, since the appointment nearly two years
ago of Mr Serge Berdujo, who heads the Jewish community in Morocco, as
minister of tourism.
Other Jews play an important role, none more so that Mr Andre Azoulay, whose
career includes co-founding the newspaper Maroc Information after
independence in 1956 (it was closed by the authorities three years later),
and a long spell in a senior position at Banque Paribas in Paris.
He was the founder of 'Identity and Dialogue', a group of intellectuals
which did much in the 1970s to bring together Jews of Moroccan origin who
had emigrated to France, Canada and Israel, thus initiating better
understanding of the 2,000-year history of the Moroccan Jewish community.
Since 1991 Mr Azoulay has been King Hassan's adviser for economic and
financial affairs. Born in Essaouira, the port town from which the family of
Lord Hore-Belisha, the British politician, originated, Mr Azoulay has acted
as the king's 'sherpa' for the conference which, later this month, will
bring together Mr Itzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister; Mr Yasser
Arafat, head of the Palestinian authority and hundreds of western and Arab
businessmen.
From 'tujjar al sultan' to 'sherpa', the connection is quite obvious, as
trade links are publicly established between Israel and Morocco instead of
the discreet bonds that have existed for many years.
The extraordinary diversity of Jewish life that existed in Morocco for
centuries, with Jewish communities differing among themselves even more than
the Muslims, may never return. The spectrum ranged from the citizens of a
coastal town who benefited from the protection of a foreign power to
Berber-speaking Jewish cobblers settled in the midst of a dissident Berber
tribe, from the prestigious descendants of refugees from Spain to
inhabitants of mellahs in remote towns of the Berber heartland of Morocco in
which chieftancies were elective.
Important Israeli businessmen, such as Mr Amiran Sivan, president of Bank
Hapoalim; Mr Eytan Chichinski, president of Koor, Israeli's leading
industrial group; Mr Michael Freedman, president of the Dan hotel chain and
Mr Itzhak Lendsmann, president of Tnuva, one of Israel's largest dairy
producers, have started to pay visits to Morocco to discuss trade and
investment opportunities. Mr Raphael Edery, the vice-president of the
Knesset and Labour MP, is another recently visitor.
The Omnium Nord Africain, Morocco's largest private group which is run by Mr
Fouad Filali, the king's son-in-law and son of the prime minister, has set
up Salam 2000 with the Spanish Banesto Bank, Koor and the Palestinian
national fund. The group has a capital of USDollars 60m and aims to invest
in the Palestinian homeland.
Israeli irrigation specialists are already working in southern Morocco and
10,000 Israelis of Moroccan origin visit the kingdom every year. Direct air
links are expected to follow soon.
Whatever the future holds, the 10 years since Mr Rabin came secretly to
Morocco to visit the king and the conference now being held in Casablanca
have added an extraordinary dimension to nearly 2,000 years of relations
between Jews and the Moroccan people.
