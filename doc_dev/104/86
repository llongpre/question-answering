NESTLE, the Swiss food group, is believed to be negotiating with the
European Commission about selling some of its mineral water brands, in an
attempt to persuade Brussels to clear its FFr15.46bn (Dollars 2.9bn) bid for
Perrier, the French mineral water.
The Commission's concerns about the bid centre on the prospective shares of
the French mineral water market owned by Nestle and BSN, the French food
group which sided with its Swiss competitor during the Perrier bid in return
for an agreement that it could buy Volvic mineral water if the bid
succeeded.
It appears that the Volvic deal may not be enough to convince Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, that there will be no distortion
of the French market. The bid was technically suspended in February,
although the public offer for Perrier shares was allowed to go ahead.
The Commission has to make a decision by the end of July, and Sir Leon is
likely to pass his recommendations for action to a consultative committee of
national experts at the beginning of the month.
Three weeks ago, Nestle revealed that the Commission's merger task force
still had 'serious doubts' about the potential duopoly between BSN and
Nestle. Unlike previous competition cases involving French companies,
however, the Nestle merger has not stirred up any political storms in Paris
or Brussels.
Nestle has claimed that, if it was allowed to take control of Perrier, which
owns a number of other waters as well as Volvic and the flagship brand, its
share of the French market would rise from 15.6 to 36.8 per cent. Meanwhile,
BSN would see its share increase from 20.2 to 30.9 per cent after the
addition of Volvic.
The other Perrier-owned waters in the French market include Contrex, Vichy,
Saint Lambert and Plancoet.
