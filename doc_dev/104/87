   Jean-Marie Le Pen has been accused of
anti-Semitism and xenophobia in his crusade to keep France French.
The press calls him a ``devil,'' but Le Pen doesn't care.
   ``If I told you it gives me pleasure, would you be surprised?''
he says with a grin.
   After 30 years of battle in the public arena, Le Pen refuses to
yield now.
   ``I'm a man with a mission,'' he said. Alluding to death
threats, he added: ``If I fall, I will have accomplished it.''
   Le Pen and his National Front fear ``colonization'' by
foreigners. They want to expel immigrants and enact new
anti-immigration laws.
   To the accusations of racism, anti-Semitism and xenophobia, Le
Pen replies that he is simply a patriot who says in public what
other people think in private.
   After the discovery May 10 of the desecration of the Jewish
cemetery in Carpentras and mutilation of a corpse, Interior
Minister Pierre Joxe accused Le Pen of fostering hate. Le Pen was
present only in effigy at a huge protest march in Paris that
attracted all the main political parties.
   ``I am Carpentras'' read a sign on the effigy.
   ``It leaves me rather cold,'' Le Pen said, settling into a chair
in the study of his home in St. Cloud, a suburb of Paris.
   ``I have the calm of an old soldier. I've often seen the whites
of the enemy's eyes.''
   For him, the enemy is the political establishment supported by
the media, which he claims echo its lies. He says the desecration
at Carpentras was a plot carried out by professionals to discredit
him.
   ``There is one thing I'm sure of: It is that I'm not guilty and
the National Front is not guilty,'' Le Pen said. ``I don't know who
did it, but I know who didn't do it.''
   Like a television preacher, Le Pen knows how to pump a crowd. He
struts, cajoles and rages, tempering his street-smart edge with
quotes from Pascal or Latin citations. He is silver-haired,
physically imposing, and even detractors acknowledge he has
charisma.
   The 61-year-old Breton, whom the French press calls the
``beast'' or the ``devil,'' thrives on controversy.
   ``Democracy is a debate, a combat of ideas,'' he said recently.
``It's not a parade of arm-chair philosophers with good
intentions.''
   On a bookshelf sits a portrait of Le Pen wearing the black
bandanna he once affected to cover the eye he lost in a street
fight defending a parliamentary deputy.
   A former paratrooper and Foreign Legionnaire who fought in
Indochina and Algeria, he now fights many of his battles in court.
   Le Pen, a deputy in the European Parliament, has been convicted
three times and fined for making remarks about Jews or the
Holocaust, but he denies being racist or anti-Semitic. He says he
has won 30 slander suits against the press.
   ``Me? Racist? It's a gag, a gag,'' he boomed. ``But I'm not for
the melting pot. I'm for the defense of one's culture. I'd despair
if I found the culture of Brooklyn in France.''
   Of Jews, he said: ``If they are French, there's no problem; I'm
not anti-Semitic.''
   On Wednesday, a court fined Le Pen for saying in 1987 that the
Nazi gas chambers were a ``detail of World War II history.''
   The Justice Ministry has succeeded in getting Le Pen's
parliamentary immunity lifted to prosecute him for two other
remarks: a play on words in 1988 linking the name of a Cabinet
minister to Nazi crematory ovens and his assertion last year that
the ``Jewish international'' was partly responsible for the
``anti-national spirit.''
   ``Who is charged to say what one can and cannot say in a free
country?'' he said.
   Le Pen founded the National Front in 1972 and remained obscure
until the party broke through in 1984, getting 11 percent of the
vote in European Parliament elections. He startled France in 1988
by winning 14 percent in the first round of presidential voting.
   Politicians of all sorts have scrambled to either outmaneuver or
accommodate him, or to woo his followers with tough talk on
immigration.
   By getting the law on voter representation changed, the
government of former Premier Jacques Chirac managed to reduce the
National Front's parliamentary seats from 33 to one.
   Since Carpentras, which set off a wave of anti-Semitic acts, Le
Pen is being denounced with greater vigor than ever.
   He is ``a man dangerous for national unity, for civil peace,''
declared Chirac, now a conservative leader.
   He ``boos the name of Gen. de Gaulle and applauds that of the
Nazi Schoenhuber,'' Chirac said. Franz Schoenhuber, a former member
of the Waffen SS, is a far-right colleague of Le Pen in the
European Parliament.
   At least six cities, including La Trinite-Sur-Mer, his hometown
in Brittany, recently denied Le Pen and his followers meeting space.
   Le Pen compares himself to a fire chief racing across town,
sirens blaring, in time to contain the blaze.
   ``Everybody says, `See that racist fire. It's fire chief Le Pen
who is guilty. You can even see all the noise he makes with his big
horn,''' he said. Racism is not increasing in France, Le Pen said,
``but there is increasing fear tied to insecurity toward foreigners
and nobody dares say so. Everyone is afraid to be called a racist.''
   He read from newspaper clippings of attacks on French citizens
by people with Arab names.
   ``Of course, I'm afraid,'' he said. ``If Europe is Europe, it's
because it has resisted'' conquest by outsiders.
   Le Pen plans to run for president again in 1995.
   Citing audience ratings after his recent appearance on a
political talk show, he said: ``I had 13 percent ... and Brigitte
Bardot had just 5.4 percent'' on a competing channel.
