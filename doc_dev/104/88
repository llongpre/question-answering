   The stunning performance of extreme rightist
Jean-Marie Le Pen in the presidential election's first round
indicates a major split among French conservatives that could put
them in the minority for years.
   The National Front leader surpassed all predictions Sunday,
winning 14.4 percent of the vote. He nearly matched the 16.5
percent gained by former center-right Premier Raymond Barre and was
not far behind conservative Premier Jacques Chirac, who had 19.5
percent.
   Sunday's winner, with 34.1 percent of the vote, was President
Francois Mitterrand, a 71-year-old Socialist who built a moderate
image in the waning years of his first seven-year term. Chirac, 55,
will face him in a runoff May 8, and attracting Le Pen's supporters
appears to be the premier's only chance.
   ``The right, which is in the majority today in France, risks
being in the minority in two weeks,'' said Pascal Perinot of the
Center for French Political Studies. ``Chirac is caught between two
blocs demanding different things.''
   Chirac's conservative Rally for the Republic party is allied
with the center-right Union for French Democracy, which backed
Barre in the first round, but the alliance is not always an easy
one.
   Some of Barre's centrist backers are expected to cross over to
Mitterrand, and that seepage could become a flood if Chirac makes
overtures to Le Pen, 59, who has emerged as a major force after 20
years on the margin of French politics.
   His goals, repeated often and eloquently, are to rid France of
Third World immigrants, save jobs and welfare benefits for the
French and crack down on crime, which he also blames on immigrants.
   Chirac has pledged not to make a deal with Le Pen for support,
leaving him with the problem of how to lure National Front voters
without their leader.
   Whatever Chirac does, the traditional conservative parties risk
the same political trap in which the left was caught during much of
the past three decades.
   For years the Socialists had the Communist Party, representing
20 percent to 25 percent of the vote in the 1960s and 1970s,
looming over their shoulders and frightening moderate voters. Only
with the decline of the Communists in the 1980s did the Socialists
come to the fore.
   That same phenomenon could be facing the right.
   ``For a quarter of a century, the left was kept out of power
because of the power of the Communist Party,'' political analyist
Alain Duhamel wrote in a commentary. ``If the present parliamentary
majority doesn't watch out, the existence of an influenctial
National Front could constitute a similar handicap.''
   Simone Veil, a leading centrist politican and former president
of the European Parliament, said: ``If Jacques Chirac's language
borrows the themes of the National Front, he will lose much more
from the center than he will gain from Jean-Marie Le Pen's voters.''
   She said her vote would be one of those lost to Chirac in such a
case.
   Pierre Mehaignerie, another centrist leader, said: ``Jacques
Chirac has two weeks to answer and give these (centrist) voters the
assurances they are seeking.''
   Mitterrand, who was visiting the French Antilles, was quick to
grasp the National Front stick and thrash Chirac with it.
   ``I would not like to see the formation of an anomalous
coaltion,'' the incumbent declared.
   ``I hope that no responsible candidate will allow himself to go
so far as to discuss with, deal with or foresee a future government
with a political movement which, with regard to racism, shows so
much indulgence. It is on this kind of political act that one will
judge real intentions and that one will judge on May 8.''
   Perinot said the traditional right ``will no longer be credible
among voters'' unless it ends internal quarrels and finds a way to
weaken the National Front
   ``Chirac must pick up a part of this electorate, but he will not
get it all because in this election there was a large amount of
protest, of hostility toward the political class,'' Perinot said.
``The extreme right vote was an anti-political demonstration.''
   National Front voters tend to be young and male, largely from
the class of shopkeepers, artisans and small businessmen. A similar
movement led by Pierre Poujade succeeded in electing 53 deputies to
the National Assembly in 1956, among them Le Pen, but faded in the
next election.
   Although the National Front appeals to many of the same voters,
it also attracts the working class, which makes up about 20 percent
of its support.
   ``In the 1950s and 1960s, the French never gave a durable vote
to the extreme right because of the Vichy experience,'' said
Perinot, referring to the wartime government that collaborated with
the Nazis. ``Now, most of the young have forgotten history and the
extreme right has emerged.''
