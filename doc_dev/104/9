   An appeals court today gave ordinary criminal
courts jurisdiction to try a former French official accused of
sending 194 Jewish children to their deaths in concentration camps
during World War II.
   The Paris Court of Appeals overturned a lower court ruling last
month Rene Bousquet could only be tried by the High Court of the
Liberation, formed in 1944 to prosecute officials of the
collaborationist Vichy government. The court has been defunct for
decades.
   Court of Appeals President Albert Moatty ruled today that the
length of time required to reconstitute the court could preclude
justice in the case of Bousquet, who is 81.
   With Moatty's ruling, state prosecutors can resume their
investigation of evidence on Bousquet's case that was provided by
Nazi hunters.
   Bousquet headed the national police during the Nazi occupation
of France. State prosecutors in September asked that he be
investigated in connection with the deportation of 194 Jewish
children during the war.
   Should the case go to trial, Bousquet would be the
highest-ranking official of the Vichy government to be tried for
crimes against humanity.
   But Serge Klarsfeld, a lawyer and prominent Nazi hunter, has
said senior government officials, including President Francois
Mitterrand, appear reluctant to pursue the case.
   Bousquet was condemned in 1949 for his wartime activities, but
the decision was reversed due to ``acts accomplished in favor of
the Resistance'' - namely his decision to free some jailed
Resistance fighters at the time he was ousted from his post.
   Human rights leaders say none of the high-ranking French
political figures with direct roles in deporting and arresting
100,000 Jews during the war has been brought to justice.
   Yves Jouffa, president of the French League of Human Rights, has
said the recent trial of the Gestapo chief of Lyon, Klaus Barbie,
``was the trial of Nazi Germany, not collaborationist France.''
   A federation of human rights groups has organized a commisison
of inquiry to determine why action against Bousquet and two other
suspected war criminals, Paul Touvier and Maurice Papon, has taken
so long.
   Touvier, 75, is being prosecuted for his activities as a
pro-Nazi militia chief who worked with Barbie in Lyon. He was
captured last year after spending years in hiding under the shelter
of right-wing Roman Catholic monks.
   Charges against Papon, a former budget minister, have been
pending for seven years. He has been accused of responsibility for
the arrests and deportations of 1,700 Jews while an administrator
in Bordeaux during the war.
