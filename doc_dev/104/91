   Coca-Cola Co. said the Paris Court of Appeals has upheld its right to cancel some contracts and deny renewal of others with Pernod-Ricard S.A., its major bottler in France. 

   The soft-drink and foods giant said the court ruled that distribution rights for Coke in bottles and cans will revert to the company Aug. 15 in Orleans, France, and on Jan. 1, 1990, in Marseille. 
The company said the court also confirmed its right to terminate contracts for distribution of Coke in cans in all territories no later than Jan. 1, 1990. 

   Coca-Cola has been trying to take control of the bottling rights from Pernod-Ricard, which accounts for about 80% of its French business, because of a dispute about how the business should be run. 
Pernod sued after it was notified that Coca-Cola didn't intend to renew the contracts. 

   Coca-Cola said it will spend more than $50 million over the next several years to expand the French business, which is key to efforts to consolidate its soft-drink business in Europe. 
Among other things, it will expand its sales force in some areas and build two plants that will help serve all of Europe. 
Its French subsidiary already has taken over distribution rights in Vichy and Bordeaux, after the French court let stand cancellations of Pernod-Ricard contracts in those territories.
