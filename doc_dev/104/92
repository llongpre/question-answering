Tenneco, the diversified US industrial company, has named a veteran of
Honeywell's European restructuring programme to head J. I. Case, Tenneco's
largest division.
Mr Jean-Pierre Rosso, 53, from Vichy, France, will succeed Mr Edward
Campbell as Case's president. Mr Campbell will retire on March 31.
Mr Rosso's appointment is seen as a sign that Case is about to proceed with
an extensive rationalisation of its European operations, where its
construction and agricultural equipment lines have been battered by
competition and shrinking markets.
Case has just completed the first year of a three-year, Dollars 920m
restructuring programme designed to rescue it from losses of Dollars 1bn in
1992. To date, the bulk of Case's rationalisations and plant closings have
been in North America.
Announcing the appointment, Mr Dana Mead, Tenneco's president, said 'a
substantial amount of restructuring steps remain across all of Case's
worldwide operations'.
