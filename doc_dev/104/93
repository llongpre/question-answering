<HEAD>International Arrest Warrant Issued For Former Nazi</HEAD>

   A French investigating magistrate has issued an
international arrest warrant for Alois Brunner, one of the last
major Nazi war criminals still at large. He is believed to be
living in Syria.
   Brunner, 76, Adolf Eichmann's right-hand man, was commander of
the Drancy transit camp from which thousands of French Jews and
Resistance members were deported to concentration camps or
extermination centers.
   The arrest warrant was issued Friday by Judge Claude Grellier
and follows a complaint filed Dec. 4, 1987 accusing Brunner of
crimes against humanity, specifically the kidnapping and murder of
minors.
   French lawyer and Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld has entered the
case as a civil party representing an organization called the Sons
and Daughters of the Jewish Deportees of France.
   Klarsfeld, along with his wife, Beate led the successful battle
to have Klaus Barbie, known as the Butcher of Lyon, brought to
France from Bolivia in 1983. Barbie was convicted of crimes against
humanity last July and sentenced to life in prison. France no
longer has a death penalty.
   Brunner was tried and convicted in absentia in 1954 for war
crimes and sentenced to death. That sentence is no longer valid
because the 20-year statute of limitations has expired. However,
there is no statute of limitations for crimes against humanity.
   The charges against Brunner involve the arrest of about 200
children, which the Sons and Daughters group says was carried out
July 20, 1944, and their deportation to the gas chambers at
Auschwitz in Nazi-held Poland.
   The Klarsfelds in 1982 said they had found Brunner in Syria.
Austria, Poland and West Germany have previously asked for his
extradition, but the Syrian government has never acted.
