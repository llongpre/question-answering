NICE, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wars were fought, governments fell and new republics were formed in the rest of 
France. 
</P>
<P>
But almost continuously for 60 years, unruffled and undisturbed by these 
outside events, the Medecin family ruled Nice, the French tourist mecca and 
regional capital on the Cote d'Azur. 
</P>
<P>
Father Jean (The King) Medecin served 35 years as mayor. Handsome son Jacques 
Medecin took over where papa left off, logging 25 years at the helm of France's 
fifth-largest city (population 340,000) without ever facing a serious challenge 
at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
The only break came after World War II, when Jean Medecin was banned from 
public office for two years because of his participation in the 
collaborationist Vichy government. 
</P>
<P>
It was, in French terms, a dynasty enduring enough to rival the Kennedys of 
Massachusetts and the Daleys of Chicago. Nice was in Medecin hands for nearly 
half the time it has been a permanent part of France, having been deeded to 
Napoleon III by the King of Sardinia in 1860. 
</P>
<P>
Along the way, the Medecin clan built a political machine that controlled the 
southeast corner of France and could deliver enough votes to change the outcome 
of close French presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to being mayor of Nice, Jacques Medecin also was president of the 
regional council for the department, or state, of the Maritime Alps, and all 
nine of the region's representatives in the National Assembly were Medecin 
loyalists. The mayor had national political clout. 
</P>
<P>
That's why when Jacques Medecin suddenly packed up and fled the country 
recently, establishing himself in self-imposed exile in a resort town in 
Uruguay, the world of French politics was stunned. The ensuing attention has 
offered a rare peek inside the occult workings of French politics in general, 
not just in Medecin's stronghold in the Maritime Alps. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Nice, townspeople were so accustomed to seeing a Medecin at City Hall 
that they didn't quite know how to react. 
</P>
<P>
"He is my god. I worship him. We owe him everything," said a despairing Alex 
Ricci, owner of a popular Italian restaurant across from the Palais de Justice 
in the sun-dappled, ocher-tinted old city of Nice. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Oltra, a burly political operative considered the mayor's right-hand man 
at City Hall, started wearing two wristwatches, one set to Nice time, the other 
four hours earlier, to the local time in Punta de Este, Uruguay, where Medecin 
has set up camp. To Oltra and others here, Nice still operates on two times -- 
French time and Medecin time. 
</P>
<P>
Theories differ over what chased Jacques Medecin from his sunny bastion on the 
Bay of Angels. 
</P>
<P>
Oltra offered one: "Jacques Medecin is a fighter, but he was broken, crushed by 
the harassment he suffered. Some people kill themselves in similar 
circumstances. Jacques Medecin is not one of them. He left." 
</P>
<P>
The mayor did owe several million dollars in back taxes, the result of a tax 
department investigation that traced his holdings to Beverly Hills, Panama and 
the Caribbean. The tax bill forced Medecin, 62, and his American wife, Ilene 
Graham Medecin, 42, to give up their stunning hillside villa in Nice, complete 
with its own underground shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
French tax authorities were alerted to some of Medecin's foreign holdings by a 
former California business associate, Claudette Pezanas. She was angry that 
Medecin had not paid her $10,000 she claimed to be owed for her role in 
unsuccessful Medecin business ventures to sell a bus-stop video system and 
portable toilets to the city of Los Angeles. So, Pezanas went on a late-night 
French television program and answered questions about her dealings with the 
Nice mayor. 
</P>
<P>
After her 1985 appearance on the television program, "Droit de Reponse," 
Pezanas claimed that she and her family received numerous death threats. Three 
years later, she was found dead in the Jacuzzi of her Palm Springs home, an 
apparent drowning victim but, improbably, still wearing hair-curlers and 
jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Palm Springs Detective Mark Harvey noted in his police report: ". . . This 
agency is unable to establish whether the drowning death of the victim was a 
homicide or an accidental death." 
</P>
<P>
At the time Medecin left France, ostensibly on an official trip to Japan, a 
special magistrate in Grenoble was investigating charges that he had 
misappropriated tens of millions of francs in public funds through such dubious 
schemes as a multi-continent "talent hunt" for singers for the Nice Opera. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the magistrate, the equivalent of a federal prosecutor in the 
United States, issued a warrant for Medecin's arrest on charges of "fiscal 
mismanagement." 
</P>
<P>
Among other charges, Medecin is accused of accepting kickbacks from large, 
government-funded construction projects in the region, including the new opera 
building and a convention center here, as well as skimming money from several 
dozen quasi-public "municipal associations" that received public funding. 
</P>
<P>
In perhaps the most embarrassing episode along these lines, the magistrate is 
searching for 4.6 million francs (about $900,000) that was allocated to help 
restructure the municipal debt in Nice. 
</P>
<P>
The money was traced to an account held by a woman friend of the mayor, 
Elisabeth Arnulf, where records showed it had been withdrawn shortly before 
investigators got there. Asked about the disappearing money, Arnulf said she 
loaned it to a boyfriend in New York but forgot his name. 
</P>
<P>
A member of the moderate right political party Rally for the Republic, Medecin 
had also managed to frighten mainstream French political leaders by his recent 
flirtation with the extreme right-wing National Front party of Jean-Marie Le 
Pen. 
</P>
<P>
Because of its large community of pieds noirs, mostly conservative former 
French colonists from Algeria, and an equally conservative retiree community, 
the Nice region was already a stronghold for the National Front. Le Pen's 
opponents feared that an alliance with Medecin could give the right-wing party 
its first majority in a regional government. 
</P>
<P>
Fueling this fear, Medecin announced earlier this year that he agreed with 99% 
of the ideas espoused by the National Front, which has a strong anti-Arab, 
anti-immigrant platform and has been accused of anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
After Le Pen was turned down by mayors all over France in his attempt to find a 
site for the National Front's annual convention last spring, Medecin not only 
offered Nice but also hosted a reception for Le Pen. 
</P>
<P>
Medecin's abrupt departure from his hometown left his broad-based political 
machine exposed at a time when corruption in French politics is a hot topic, 
and not just on the Mediterranean coast. 
</P>
<P>
In his controversial new book, "Impossible Inquiry," disgruntled Police 
Inspector Antoine Gaudino claims that the same kind of corruption that Medecin 
is alleged to have practiced -- accepting illegal kickbacks from government 
contracts and diverting funds from government-funded associations -- permeates 
the whole French political system, all the way to the Elysee Palace, the office 
of President Francois Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
Gaudino claimed he was suspended from his job as inspector of finance in 
Marseilles after he uncovered a scheme of false billings on government 
contracts that steered money to many leading Socialist Party politicians in the 
south of France. One of the men named in the Gaudino investigation was a former 
Mitterrand campaign treasurer, Henri Nallet. 
</P>
<P>
Nallet was recently named minister of justice, the government position that 
oversees the courts. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the United States, which requires strict accounting for political 
financing and gives investigative agencies the power to demand party financial 
records, French political funding has traditionally occurred in the dark, 
beyond public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
In January, the French National Assembly passed a law attempting to correct the 
problem by requiring more public disclosure of political contributions and 
allocating public money to help fund campaigns. For decades, however, the 
French electoral system has operated in a state of semiofficial corruption. 
Political parties needed money. The most common way to raise it was through 
kickbacks, often in the form of exorbitant consultant fees, on government 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
According to Gaudino, the same crimes that Medecin is accused of committing are 
also practiced by most of the main French political parties, including the 
ruling Socialist Party. He theorizes that the only reason Medecin was picked 
out for special attention was because, with his potential alliance with the 
National Front, he posed a political threat to the other parties. 
</P>
<P>
"Corruption exists everywhere," Gaudino said in a telephone interview, "but the 
courts are not always authorized to look into it. Today the Socialist Party is 
in power, and one discovers that the biggest scandals are found in the 
opposition. Right now, the courts are after Medecin. But they could just as 
easily go after the others. The same (municipal) associations that surround 
Monsieur Medecin can also be found around the Socialist Party in the 
(Marseilles) affair that I investigated." 
</P>
<P>
From his retreat in Punta del Este, Jacques Medecin sings a similar tune, 
claiming he is the victim of a "Socialist plot" against him. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in Nice, people await his return. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't tell you when he will come back," said Jean Oltra. "Not tomorrow, but 
maybe after a year or two. But he will come back. Nice is his life, his soul, 
his family . . . . "
