Air Littoral, a French commuter airline, has introduced two new travel passes. 
</P>
<P>
The passes permit unlimited flights on most of the carrier's service to 23 
cities throughout France. The only exceptions are some peak-time flights called 
"Red Flights." A seven-day pass costs $199, while a 10-day pass is $249. Passes 
must be used on consecutive days. Rates are good until the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
Among the cities Air Littoral serves are Paris, Marseilles, Nice, Lyon, 
Bordeaux, Toulouse, Brest, Clermont, Perigueux, Pau, Grenoble, Agen, Bergerac, 
Le Puy, Vichy, Angouleme and Beziers. 
</P>
<P>
Passes have to be bought in the United States. Contact travel agents or Air 
Promotion Systems, the line's U.S. representative, at (800) 677-4277 or (213) 
670-7302. 
</P>

Air Inter, another domestic French carrier, has a more flexible seven-day "Le 
France" pass that permits you to choose any seven days to fly within a month. 
This pass costs $210. Air Inter serves 36 cities in France, including Paris, 
Nice, Marseilles, Lyon, Biarritz and Toulouse. 
</P>
<P>
In general, Air Littoral serves smaller cities than Air Inter.

Air France, in conjunction with Kemwel Rental Car, is offering a special rate 
of $39 for one-week car rentals in Europe. To qualify, two passengers have to 
purchase round-trip, transatlantic flights from any U.S. city served by Air 
France. 
</P>
<P>
The offer, good until March 31, includes unlimited mileage, value-added tax and 
full collision-damage insurance with no deductible. 
</P>
<P>
Cars can be picked up at such Air France gateways as Paris, Nice, Rome, Venice, 
Milan, Geneva, Zurich, Madrid, Barcelona, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Brussels and 
Athens. To avoid a drop-off charge, you have to return the car to the same 
Kemwel station where you picked it up.. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to drop the car off at a different station in the same country, 
figure on a $50 charge. And if you want to give the car back in another 
country, the rate is $175. 
</P>
<P>
Car reservations must be made at least seven days before departure from the 
United States. JACK ADLER
