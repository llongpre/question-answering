Sir, I would like to congratulate Ian Davidson on his perceptive article,
'Vichy casts a shadow' (September 28), which traces France's inability to
accept shared responsibility for its recent past, as mirrored in a recently
published biography of Francois Mitterrand.
As a Reuters correspondent in Paris from 1952-57, I witnessed similar
psychological inability to accept events which were painful to the French
psyche. For example, the fall of Dien Bien Phu in Indochina, and the
surrender of the French army, were explained away by my French friends as
the fault of the German members of the French Foreign Legion who were
fighting there at the time.
The French people are intensely individualistic, a quality which manifested
itself in the political arena in the many different parties of the Fourth
Republic in the 1950s, and which reveals itself today in the constant
dissensions between party ranks. I suggest this passionate individualism
makes it difficult for them to accept a shared responsibility for the past.
Sanche de Gramont, in his book The French, Portrait of a People says:
'France is not a synchronised country. It is like an ungaited horse, each of
whose legs is proceeding at a different cadence.'
I quote this with affection for the days I spent in the country, and the
friends I made there.
