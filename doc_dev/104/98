   A French court appointed two mediators to try to resolve a dispute between Coca-Cola Co. and its major French bottler, Pernod-Ricard S.A. 

   Atlanta-based Coca-Cola has been trying to take control of the distribution rights held by Pernod, which account for about 80% of Coca-Cola's sales in France. 
When Pernod rebuffed Coca-Cola's buy-out offers, Coca-Cola informed the company that several contracts Pernod held would not be renewed when they expired. 
Pernod sued to force their renewal. 

   Yesterday, a French court let stand Coca-Cola's cancellation of Pernod's bottling contracts for Vichy and Bordeaux. 
But the court suspended Coca-Cola's right not to renew Pernod's bottling contracts for Orleans and Marseille and its can-distribution rights for certain territories. 
It appointed the mediators to try to find a compromise. 

   Coca-Cola said it will appeal the court's decision.
