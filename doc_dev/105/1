   American inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, a
pioneer of television, was accorded what many believe was long
overdue glory Wednesday when a 7-foot bronze likeness of the
electronics genius was dedicated in the U.S. Capitol.
   With his 81-year-old widow, Elma Farnsworth, looking on, the
inventor was extolled as the father of television and his statue
was placed in the pantheon of famous Americans of the Capitol's
National Statuary Hall.
   ``I think it's an honor long overdue,'' said Bruce Barnson, who
headed a commission that raised $250,000 to place Farnsworth near
the likeness of a better-known Utahn, Brigham Young.
   ``I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart ... for
this great honor,'' Mrs. Farnsworth told an audience at the Capitol
dedication.
   The ceremony included songs from the school choir from
Ridgecrest Elementary School in Butler, Utah. Students from
Ridgecrest started the drive for the statue after they surveyed
Utah residents and recommended to the state legislature that
Farnsworth be the second Utahn honored in Statuary Hall.
   The statue by Utah sculptor James Avanti depicts Farnsworth
holding an image dissector tube that was the heart of the
electronic television system that he first conceived as a
15-year-old high school student in 1922.
   Farnsworth is called in an inscription at on the base of the
statue the ``Father of Television.''
   Farnsworth gained the first patent on his system, the precursor
of today's television, in 1934 after winning a patent battle with
the powerful RCA corporation, which later paid him $1 million to
use his many patents. Most history books list Farnsworth only as
one of many early pioneers of television.
   He died in 1971 while working on fusion research. He had
contributed more than 160 inventions, including radar and the
electron microscope. He was named to the National Inventors Hall of
Fame in 1984.
   Each state is allowed to honor two of its famous citizens with
statues in Statuary Hall. But Utah had placed only Young in the
hall.
