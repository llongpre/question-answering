<HEAD>Inventor Says He Has Developed 3-D TV</HEAD>

   An inventor said Wednesday he has developed
three-dimensional television, beating the world's electronics
giants.
   ``We think that just as black and white was converted into
color, so will color be converted into 3-D,'' said the 33-year-old
British inventor, James Ashbey.
   The technology does not require special glasses or screens. It
can convert all new and existing black and white and color films
into 3-D, along with live broadcasts, animation and computer
graphics, said his company, Delta Group.
   Ashbey displayed his invention at a London studio, showing color
films in what he calls ``full natural perspective.''
   The effect appears three dimensional, but it loses some
resolution compared with a standard TV image, and is very blurry.
Ashbey did not display the 3-D and normal television versions of
the same film side-by-side for comparison.
   Ashbey said he has applied for an international patent for his
invention, which he calls ``Deep Vision.''
   He said he developed the technology with financial support from
RCA-Columbia Pictures International, which he said provided
$245,000, and the British entertainment group Brent Walker Holdings
PLC, which he said provided $642,200.
   Deep Vision electronically stimulates the brain into creating an
illusion, he said.
   The technology takes a normal film, makes a digital version and
inserts what Ashbey calls stereo cues. A digital decoder added to
an ordinary television set then uses these cues to send slightly
different images to each eye, and that creates the experience of
depth, he said.
