FT  22 FEB 94 / The US Strikes Back: Progress out of chaos - America's
high-tech industry is in the lead again

The much-trumpeted revival of US manufacturing in the 1990s, though patchy,
seems beyond dispute in one vital area. In high-tech electronics, especially
the converging worlds of computing and telecommunications, the US has
reasserted its dominance in the past three years.
Some would say America's lead here was never really in doubt. But in the
mid-1980s, it seemed to be narrowing. At one end of the chain, the US
consumer electronics industry was in a nosedive. Further up, the Japanese
were taking over the production of semiconductor memory chips. At the top of
the chain, and perhaps most worrying from a strategic viewpoint, the US was
rapidly losing ground in the market for the highly sophisticated equipment
needed to manufacture semiconductor chips.
Now, while the US has ceded the manufacture of low-profit-margin, commodity
electronics products such as memory chips and television sets, it is racing
ahead in many aspects of information technology.
US companies dominate such critical areas as microprocessor chips, computer
software and personal computers. There has even been a comeback in machines
for making semiconductors. The leading US supplier, Applied Materials of
California, now claims to be the biggest in the world.
For once, the revival is not just a function of the shrinking Japanese
economy and the strength of the yen. The electronics industry is seeing
shifts in technology and markets which play to America's strengths, just as
the 1980s exposed its weaknesses.
In information technology, runs the argument, the US has three basic
advantages:
Communications. Competition in long-distance telephone services and the
growing freedom of the regional 'Baby Bells', created by the break-up of
AT&amp;T in the early 1980s, have encouraged innovation in US
telecommunications, producing lower-cost, more advanced telephone services.
At the same time, the American talent for entertainment - especially TV and
video - has produced explosive demand for cable television networks. As a
result, the spread and variety of electronic links between US offices,
factories and homes is a long way ahead of Japan.
Use of personal computers. The vast majority of US offices are equipped with
networked PCs. About one-third of US households also have at least one PC.
Japan by comparison has been slow to take advantage of PC technology.
The enterprise culture. California's Silicon Valley is still characterised
by a diversity of start-up companies, underpinned by a powerful and
sophisticated venture capital industry.
On the basis of these advantages, the US is racing to build broadband
networks, able to convey interactive media, which link homes, offices,
schools and hospitals. The Clinton administration has called the development
of such an 'information super-highway' a national goal.
Industry leaders claim the super-highway will not only create markets for
their inventions, but change the world, or at least the US. 'Sceptics may
disagree, but I believe the impact of this revolution will rival that of the
electric light or the telephone or, perhaps, printing itself,' says Larry
Ellison, president and chief executive of Oracle, a leading US database
software company.
The confidence that imbues the US industry is in contrast to the defeatism
of the late 1980s. There are still exceptions, such as International
Business Machines and Digital Equipment, the two largest computer companies,
which are struggling to adapt to shifts in technology and markets. As a
whole, though, the sector has turned itself round.
In personal computers, the US was bracing itself in the 1980s for a Japanese
invasion. The Japanese had captured the semiconductor market, it was said,
and their next target would be PCs. The reverse has happened: US PC
manufacturers are making inroads in the Japanese market.
One reason is the pace of technology change. 'The big players in the Far
East used to think all they had to do was fill a boat with cheap products
and send it here,' says Safi Qureshey, head of AST Research of California,
the world's fourth-biggest personal computer maker. 'Now it turns out that,
by the time the stuff lands here, it's a little bit slow, a little bit old,
and they can't sell it at a profit.'
Some Silicon Valley executives say the pace of change also favours US
entrepreneurial companies in a more fundamental way. Harvey Jones, head of
the software company Synopsys, argues the electronics industry alternates
between two phases: that of innovation, or chaos, and that of production, or
standardisation.
At present, he says, the industry is going through a chaotic upheaval. In
telecoms, he says, 'we have Ericsson, Alcatel, Siemens, NEC, Fujitsu and
AT&amp;T as customers. When we see them all in frenzied mode after God knows how
many telecom strategies, you say to yourself that we're in a huge cycle of
innovation. The same is true in multimedia. It's all pre-standardisation,
and all creative invention.'
This is the phase in which US-style creative diversity wins over the
large-scale, straight-line approach of the Japanese giants. Take the initial
innovative stage of semiconductors, says Jones. 'That was a phase when
companies like Intel and Fairchild could do no wrong. Then, as it settled
down, people said 'hey, a memory's a memory, and it's got to fit into this
one kind of socket on the board'. Then, all of a sudden, the Japanese came
in and took over.'
This does not mean that the US is doomed to lose its high-tech edge again.
US companies are more aggressive today in protecting their intellectual
property rights. Semiconductor manufacturers demand higher royalties on
their patents, and software companies vigorously enforce their copyrights.
Thus it will be more difficult for any foreign competitor to take advantage
of Intel's latest microprocessor innovations than it was for Japan's
chipmakers to become leaders in the market for the dynamic random access
memory chips, which Intel also invented.
Through international alliances, US companies are also taking advantage of
low-cost mass production abroad - in Taiwan, China, Singapore and Malaysia,
for example. Even though the majority of circuit boards for PCs are made
outside the US, American companies win most of the profits in the world PC
market.
The biggest advantage for US high-tech manufacturers, however, is that
technology trends are being set in their home market. This has long been the
case in computer hardware and software, but it is increasingly true of
telecommunications and even consumer electronics. Most important, the US
leads the world in working out how these technologies converge.
