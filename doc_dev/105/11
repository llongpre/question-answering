<LEADPARA>  The National Inventors Hall of Fame last week chose to honor Gertrude Belle
Elion for her pioneering research at Burroughs Wellcome Co. that led to the
development of drugs to combat leukemia, septic shock and tissue rejection in
patients undergoing kidney transplants.;    The recognition makes Elion, 73,
the first woman to take her place alongside innovators like Alexander Graham
Bell and Thomas A. Edison in the Hall of Fame since the organization was begun
in 1973.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Two years ago, Elion (pronounced ELL-ee-on) shared the Nobel Prize for
medicine with her longtime colleague, George H. Hitchings.;    Elion, who was
born in the Bronx, N.Y., has been a pioneer in more ways than one. Although
women have produced a number of major technological advances, women remain
rare among inventors and receive only about 5 percent of all patents.;    "I
was a maverick," Elion said last week.;    At a time when most women did not
go to college, she graduated from Hunter with top honors at 19 and went on to
obtain a master's degree in chemistry.;    In the 1940s, she and Hitchings
developed variations on components of the genetic material DNA that could be
used to fool cells and foil the reproductive machinery of viruses and
bacteria.;    But what made the work remarkable was that no one had yet
identified the double-helix structure of DNA or knew much about the way it
worked. But the two scientists did know that DNA was built from four chemical
components, known as bases. Their approach, therefore, was to develop fake
versions of these bases that would fool particular kinds of cells and lead to
useless DNA.;    Elion first used the approach to synthesize compounds that
block lymphocytes that cause leukemia, but the approach led her and other
researchers to develop a host of other drugs as well.;    Elion now holds
about 40 patents, and the approach has since been applied by other
scientists.;    The Hall of Fame is a non-profit organization based in Akron,
Ohio. Inductees are selected by a panel of scientists, patent attorneys and
other experts. Thus far, 94 inventors have been named to the hall.  </TEXT>
