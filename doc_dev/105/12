   A record 10 new members, including the first
two blacks, were named to the National Inventors Hall of Fame on
Wednesday.
   ``The 10 individuals we honor here today are the real heroes of
our age. ... They are the thinkers and the problem solvers. They
have opened new doors and pioneered new frontiers in science and
technology,'' said Jeffrey M. Samuels, acting commissioner of
patents and trademarks.
   George Washington Carver and Percy F. Julian were among the
inventors selected for inclusion this year, marking the first
blacks to be selected since the hall was begun in 1973.
   Carver was selected for his work developing more than 500 uses
for peanuts, including cooking oil and printer's ink, and for sweet
potatoes, including synthetic rubber. He died in 1943.
   Julian, a Chicago chemist, was the first to synthesize cortisone
and other human hormones. Before the synthetic cortisone came onto
the market, the only cortisone available to treat rheumatoid
arthritis was produced from oxen bile, at a cost of hundreds of
dollars a drop.
   ``He was one of the most persistent men I have known,''
reflected Samuel B. Massie of the U.S. Naval Academy, once a
colleague of Julian, who died in 1975.
   Tenacity was also cited as a necessary ingredient by another man
being honored.
   Robert S. Ledley of Georgetown University in Washington said the
prerequisite skills for success as an inventor include a pragmatic
attitude, boldness, fortitude ``and stick-to-itiveness almost to
the extent of obsession.''
   Ledley was named to the hall of fame for his development of the
computerized tomographic, or CT, scanner, a device similar to an
x-ray machine that allows doctors to see the inner workings of the
body in great detail.
   Another man honored was Herman Hollerith, described as having
left behind a motto for the generations: ``do not fold, spindle or
mutilate.''
   Hollerith invented the punch-card system that helped pave the
way to modern computers. A Census Bureau employee, he halved the
time it took to tabulate the 1890 national head count and later
went on to help found the giant IBM Co.
   In addition to Carver, Julian, Ledley and Hollerith, inventors
selected for the hall of fame for 1990 are:
   _Graham C. Durant, John C. Emmett and C. Robin Gannellin,
medical chemists who developed the drug cimetidine, which has
greatly reduced the need for surgery for ulcer victims. It is known
by the trade name Tagamet.
   _Charles P. Ginsberg, who led the engineering team that
developed the first practical videotape.
   _Kenneth S. Olsen, developer of the magnetic memory core for
computers and founder of Digital Equipment Corporation.
   _Eugene J. Houdry, a French-born engineer who developed the
procedure that allowed crude oil to be processed into high grade
gasoline and aviation fuel.
   The selection of 10 new members is the most since six were
picked in 1985, and brings total membership in the Hall of Fame to
85.
   Founded at the U.S. Patent Office in Arlington, Va., the hall of
fame will eventually move to Akron, Ohio, where construction on a
new facility is to begin later this year.
