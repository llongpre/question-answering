   A 25-year-old convict helped bring television to
China's remote northwest by developing a satellite receiver in his
prison workshop, the official Xinhua News Agency said today.
   Ren Huimin, serving a five-year sentence for fraud in a
penitentiary in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region's capital of
Yinchuan, also has patented two other inventions, the report said.
   It said the satellite receiver designed and produced by Ren has
made it possible for Yinchuan residents to receive programs
transmitted from Beijing by China Central Television.
   He also invented an ultra-high frequency analogue switch which
turns lights on and off when people enter or leave a room, and an
infra-red automatic alarm used in the prison.
   The report said Ren taught himself physics, chemistry, optics,
electronics and electromagnetics and dropped out of school to do
independent research.
