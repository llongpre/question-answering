   DALLAS -- Texas Instruments Inc. said the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office has begun an investigation to determine if a
patent awarded to Gilbert P. Hyatt for the invention of the
single-chip microcomputer was first sought by Gary W. Boone
while working at Texas Instruments.
   The investigation is the first step in finding who
actually invented the device, which over the years has become
crucial to the manufacturing of televisions, computers and
other electronic products. The winner of the patent battle is
likely to claim millions of dollars in royalties from U.S.
and Japanese semiconductor companies now producing huge
volumes of more advanced versions of the device.

   The electronics and defense company asked the patent
office on Jan. 15 to investigate Mr. Hyatt's patent, which
was awarded with great fanfare last year. A spokesman said
Texas Instruments is convinced Mr. Boone patented the device
on July 19, 1971. The company said Mr. Hyatt's patent wasn't
filed until 1977.
   Calling the challenge "frivolous," Mr. Hyatt said he filed
his patent in 1968.
   Separately, Texas Instruments said it agreed to develop a
new solar technology with Southern California Edison Co., a
unit of SCEcorp. It said the two companies plan to develop a
new solar cell using low-purity silicon to convert sunlight
to electricity.
