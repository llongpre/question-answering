   Fifty years after commercial television made
its flickering debut at the New York World's Fair, the passion of a
gangly teen-ager who made it possible is finally being requited.
   ``It's high time,'' said Elma ``Pem'' Farnsworth, who for 44
years was sounding board, sweetheart, lab assistant and wife to
Philo Taylor Farnsworth.
   But she wasn't his first love. Television was.
   Farnsworth, who died in 1971, was 15 years old in 1922 when he
diagrammed his idea for an electronic TV system on a high school
blackboard in this eastern Idaho farming town.
   Chemistry teacher Justin Tolman's memory of that drawing,
including the first description of an electronic ``image
dissector'' TV camera tube, helped Farnsworth win the first in a
series of patent battles with RCA over early TV technology in the
1930s.
   But if Farnsworth won the battles, RCA won the war. Outside
Idaho and his native Utah, most history and reference books place
him on the sidelines among ``other pioneers'' who contributed to
television's development.
   Most of the glory went to Vladimir Zworykin, the
Russian-American inventor who developed the iconoscope and
kinescope during a career primarily with RCA. Farnsworth, who
received some 160 patents, finally was inducted into the National
Inventors Hall of Fame in 1984 _ seven years after Zworykin.
   ``We're going to set the record straight across the country,''
said Kent Farnsworth, the inventor's son.
   Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter proclaimed May 2 ``Philo T. Farnsworth
Day,'' kicking off a fund-raising effort for a bronze statue of
Farnsworth in National Statuary Hall. It is scheduled for placement
May 2, 1990 in the U.S. Capitol.
   Farnsworth, who was born in the southwestern Utah town of
Beaver, was picked for the honor by the Utah Legislature at the
urging of a Salt Lake City elementary school class that researched
a number of famous Utahns.
   ``People kind of like a guy who's an underdog,'' said Bruce
Barnson, principal at Ridgecrest Elementary. ``Here's a guy who was
brilliant, came up with television and really got nothing out of
it.''
   In Rigby, the Farnsworth Television Group is raising money for a
TV museum to highlight his achievements. There already are signs on
U.S. 20 leading into the town of 2,600 proclaiming Rigby the
``Birthplace of Television.''
   The Community Center, in a former bank building, has a
collection of Farnsworth memorabilia in what used to be a vault.
Last year it featured the Emmy he won posthumously in 1978 for his
contributions to TV technology.
   Mrs. Farnsworth, now 81, recently wrote an essay about her
husband for People magazine, criticizing RCA chief David Sarnoff's
effort to ``control the television industry just like he'd
controlled radio.''
   That theme is explored further in a book Mrs. Farnsworth hopes
to publish titled, ``Distant Vision: Romance and Discovery on an
Invisible Frontier.''
   She recounts how the financial strain of legal disputes with RCA
forced the Farnsworth Television &amp; Radio Corp. to the verge of
bankruptcy, and finally to sell out to International Telephone &amp;
Telegraph in 1949.
   But Edward W. Herold, a former RCA researcher and retired
director of the electronics research laboratory at the David
Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, N.J., said jabs at Sarnoff,
Zworykin or RCA are misplaced.
   ``I think Farnsworth got plenty of credit from the historians,
more than he deserves. He was really a genius; a really bright
guy,'' Herold said.
   ``Farnsworth was a competitor, and a good competitor... But I
would say he was eventually overwhelmed by the number of brilliant
people we had at RCA.''
   Farnsworth, who continued research in physics after selling the
business, developed an early electron microscope to study the
uniformity of the phosphor coating on tubes in the image dissector.
His work also helped in development of night-vision scopes, radar
and an incubator for premature babies.
   He was at Brigham Young University at the time of his death,
working on an area of physics that science has yet to conquer _
nuclear fusion.
   Mrs. Farnsworth said new attention to his life should be an
example to a new generation of discoverers. ``Phil was told
television was impossible by everyone he talked to about it. I'm
hoping this will encourage young people to stick by their guns and
not be dissuaded by anyone.''
