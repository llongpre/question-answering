   Inventors whose innovations range from the
moldboard plow to the magnetic resonance imager will be added to the
National Inventors Hall of Fame this weekend.
   Induction ceremonies are scheduled for Sunday at the U.S. Patent
Office, home of the hall of fame.
   The four new members bring to 76 the number of inventors
memoralized at the Patent Office in suburban Arlington, Va.
   Scheduled to be inducted on Sunday are:
   _John Deere, born in 1804 in Rutland, Vt., developer of the
moldboard plow. Addition of the moldboard to the standard plow
improved the ability of the tool to turn over the soil.
   _George Westinghouse, for the invention of the steam-powered
brake for railroads. Westinghouse was born in Central Bridge, N.Y.,
in 1846.
   _Irving Langmuir of Brooklyn, N.Y., who developed the gas-filled
incandescent electric lamp. He was born in 1881.
   _Raymond Damadian of Forest Hills, N.Y., who won a patent for the
magnetic resonance imaging scanner in 1974. The scanner is used in
medical diagnosis.
   The ceremonies are to be held during the annual inventors
exposition at the Patent Office where dozens of new innovations will
be on display, ranging from toys to sporting goods to a better
mousetrap.
