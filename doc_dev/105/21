   A New York inventor filed suit against Texas Instruments Inc. alleging patent infringement on his integrated circuits for flat television displays for computers. 

   The suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, seeks unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. 
Michael I. Rackman, the inventor and a lawyer, who filed the suit through his firm, alleges Dallas-based Texas Instruments infringed upon his two patents for the electroluminescent TV system and liquid-crystal television display system. 

   A spokesman for the semiconductor concern said the company hadn't seen the suit and declined to comment. 

   The suit states the patents expired in May 1987. 
Mr. Rackman's attorney said his client is eligible to file suit since the statute of limitations covers six years.
