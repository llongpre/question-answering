   Traditional academic openness is going by the
boards in the race to understand cold nuclear fusion as scholars
withhold findings that could make them big money.
   A broad patent on cold nuclear fusion could be worth billions of
dollars if the invention turns out to provide a new way of
producing cheap, clean and abundant energy.
   But the lure of money is inhibiting exploration of cold fusion
claims by making researchers withhold information to protect their
patent positions, lawyers and scholars said Thursday.
   ``There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that once you dangle
out that pot of gold called a patent it causes people to publish
less and disclose less,'' said Donald Chisum, a patent expert at
the University of Washington.
   Scientists trying to test the cold fusion claims announced at a
press conference last month have been stymied because the two
researchers have withheld important details of their work.
   The University of Utah applied for three patents even before the
March 23 news conference featuring its own B. Stanley Pons and his
co-investigator, Martin Fleischmann of the University of
Southampton in England.
   Massachusetts Institute of Technology said this week it has
applied for patents on work done by a researcher named Peter
Hagelstein.
   Brigham Young University plans to apply for patents as well,
although mainly to establish the credibility of its researcher,
Steven Jones, rather than to make money, spokesman Paul Richards
said.
   Pons and Fleischmann announced they had achieved fusion using
ordinary laboratory equipment at room temperature _ so-called cold
fusion. They said their device produced four watts of energy for
every watt it used.
   Previously, it was believed that fusion would have to take place
at extremely high temperatures. The announcement stunned scientists
worldwide who had worked for years to achieve fusion.
   Widespread skepticism about their findings has continued despite
partial confirmation by other researchers. Still, the stakes are so
high that virtually every major chemical research laboratory is
believed to be looking into it.
   ``It's almost unknowable, unthinkable how much it would be
worth,'' said John Bockris, a chemistry professor at Texas A&amp;M.
   Bockris also said he was upset by the way the focus on patents
had disrupted the normal scientific disclosure process.
   Patent lawyers usually advise clients to file for patents before
they disclose anything publicly. Secrecy helps even after a patent
application is filed, because it gives the inventors time to modify
their application with new findings or to file for more patents.
   ``The more information you give out, the more can be used
against you,'' Chisum said. ``From a patent law perspective,
publication is bad.''
   Richards, the Brigham Young spokesman, said the school applied
for patents mainly so the Patent and Trademark Office has a chance
to sort out what he called false allegations that its Steven Jones
stole Fleischmann's and Pons' work. Richards said Brigham Young did
not believe cold fusion was likely to be very valuable commercially.
   Richards claimed that University of Utah officials held their
March 23 news conference despite an agreement with Brigham Young
officials that the schools would keep quiet about their work until
March 24, the day they had agreed to ship back-to-back papers on
cold fusion to the British journal Nature.
   Richards and several patent lawyers said the University of
Utah's unusual press conference appeared to be more of a grab for
publicity than anything.
   ``I think they just naively thought they could pull this off,
and go down in history as the first ones to have done this,''
Richards said.
   James Brophy, the University of Utah's director of research,
said the school held the news conference because there had been
leaks and ``I was concerned and others were concerned that the
story would get out in an uncontrolled fashion.''
   Any royalties from Utah's patents will be split evenly three
ways between Fleischmann and Pons, the chemistry department, and
the university as a whole. That is the usual procedure, Brophy said.
   The concern for profit on campus accelerated in the 1970s with
biotechnology, which made a fast transition from pure research to
product. Stanford University and the University of California at
Berkeley earn millions of dollars a year on the so-called
Cohen-Boyers atent on gene-splicing techniques.
   The revolution in high-temperature superconductivity dragged
universities even closer to the commercial sphere.
Superconductivity is the ability to transmit electricity through a
substance without any loss of power, or resistance.
   Last year, for example, Du Pont Co. paid $1.5 million to the
University of Houston for exclusive rights to Paul Chu's
superconductivity patent applications.
