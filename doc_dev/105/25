NOKIA Consumer Electronics, the third biggest maker of televisions in
Europe, is investing Pounds 24m in a television picture tube factory in
Germany.
The company is to adapt production lines at its Esslingen factory to make
picture tubes for wide screen TV, which European electronics manufacturers
hope will be the next mass-selling consumer product in the television
market.
Nokia, a Finnish group, will also build a 6,000 square metre extension to
the factory and install highly-automated Black Matrix tube machinery. The
Black Matrix technology produces improved screen resolution, colour and
contrast. Its introduction will make Esslingen one of the most advanced tube
plants in Europe.
Production of the picture tubes on the 16:9 screen format will start by the
end of 1993. The plant will also continue producing tubes for conventional
square-shaped 4:3 television sets.
Although Nokia, Philips, the Dutch electronics group, and Thomson, the
French group, have been selling 16:9 wide-screen TV sets since September,
Thomson is the only maker currently producing 16:9 picture tubes. Nokia's
investment comes when European electronics companies are suffering from
sluggish consumer demand which has led to makers holding unusually high
inventories of about two-months' worth of production.
But Nokia expects demand for its conventional picture tubes to increase,
partly because European manufacturers are able to meet only about 8 per cent
of indigenous demand. Far eastern manufacturers supply the rest of the
market. It also expects demand for 16:9 picture tubes to increase as the
wide screen TV market grows.
