   The latest U.S. company to drop out was mighty General Electric
Co., which decided in 1987 that the GE and RCA television lines were
not ``core'' businesses and sold them to France's Thomson SA.
   It was widely assumed that if GE got out of televisions, Zenith,
at a tenth the size, could not be far behind. Some Wall Street
analysts became exasperated when Pearlman hung onto the money-losing
business after all.
   Zenith gets half its more than $2 billion in annual sales from
personal computers and related equipment. Surprisingly, it sold more
AT-compatible personal computers last year than anyone, including
IBM.
   Thanks to computers, Zenith expects to make a small pre-tax
profit this year for the first time since 1984. But its consumer
electronics business, mainly TVs, has been running in the red.
   Zenith says foreign companies are dumping TVs here at illegally
low prices and accuses the Commerce Department of failing to enforce
penalties against the alleged dumpers.
   Whatever the reason, Zenith is short on money for investment and
most likely will never manufacture complete high-definition
televisions. Its more modest goal is to get its proposed HDTV
transmission system established as a U.S. standard, which could win
it big royalties from the companies that actually make the TVs.
   Zenith also has a highly praised and patented technology for
sharp, bright computer screens, which it hopes to supply to HDTV
makers. Zenith is asking the federal government for $60 million so
it can make the screens big enough to be used in the new televisions
as well as in military equipment and air traffic control towers.
   Unfortunately for Zenith and other U.S. companies, the Japanese
have built up a nearly insurmountable lead in many aspects of the
technology.
   ``HDTV is not just one technology. It's thousands of
technologies. And the Japanese have ended up by dominating every
single one of those markets,'' said Richard J. Elkus Jr., chairman
and chief executive of Prometrix Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif., and
co-chairman of an American Electronics Association task force on
HDTV.
   Some analysts are skeptical of groups such as Rebuild America
that urge U.S. companies to take the plunge into HDTV on patriotic
grounds. Even if an American company did get into the business, it
would probably have to buy many or most of the components from the
Japanese, they say.
   ``Open up your typical PC from IBM. Do you see products that are
made in Japan? You bet,'' said Balog, the Shearson analyst.
   As for Zenith, although it says its television business is not up
for sale, it negotiated earlier this year with potential European
and Asian buyers.
   The talks reportedly broke down mainly because the governments of
the foreign parties ruled out a purchase, fearing it would stir up
anger among American voters and hurt trade relations.
   Zenith's appeal as the last U.S.-based company in the TV business
is itself rather fuzzy. Most companies in the TV business today are
transnational. Zenith has major operations in Taiwan and Mexico,
while Sony Corp. and others have thousands of U.S. workers.
   Although it is Dutch, for example, NV Philips says it has more
than 12,000 U.S. employees in television-related businesses,
including 350 doing research and development.
   Citing the threat to the U.S. electronics industry, Rebuild
America says the federal government should support a U.S.-based
company or companies in manufacturing high-definition televisions.
   The support could take the form of loans, shared research,
guaranteed purchases or some combination of those, Rebuild's
Branfman said.
   The threat to U.S. electronics is unquestionable. Some of it,
however, stems from such fundamental problems as the inadequate U.S.
educational system, the short-term perspective of investors and
managers and the high cost of money, none of which is addressed by
government support.
   ``Where American companies have been successful, they've had
great technology and great marketing. We shouldn't use trade
barriers or subsidies as a substitute for those,'' said Doug van
Dorsten, a Shearson analyst in San Francisco.
   Elkus, who helped invent the videocassette recorder while at
Ampax Corp., concedes the difficulties but says a U.S.-based
consumer electronics industry is indispensable.
   In this scenario, Zenith is an indicator of which way things are
headed, more so than a major force in its own right.
   ``To really get our feet back in this (HDTV) market we're going
to be talking about something well in excess of a billion dollars,
well in excess,'' he said.
   ``Zenith will not save the world. This is a problem that's so
much bigger than Pearlman and Zenith that you can't imagine.''
