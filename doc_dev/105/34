<LEADPARA>  Zenith Electronics Corp., America's last maker of televisions, has bet its
future on advanced TV sets and high-definition television, a technology that
promises wide-screen pictures as clear as photographs.;    But the new sets
are at least a year away and payback from HDTV is even more distant, doing
little to boost Zenith's troubled finances in the short term.  </LEADPARA>

COMPANY BETS FUTURE ON NEW TVS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Meanwhile, an investor group that owns about 8 percent of Zenith stock has
questioned the company's management and direction. This week, the group, Nycor
Inc., will try to gain a foothold on Zenith's board at the company's annual
stockholders meeting.;    The battle is just one more worry for Zenith, which
sealed its future when it sold its computer business a year and a half ago.
The 73-year-old company has not reported a profit since 1988.;    Zenith has
pegged its rebound on two technologies: a unique, flat-screen picture tube it
invented that promises brighter, glare-free viewing, and a system for
broadcasting high-definition TV it developed in conjunction with American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.;    Zenith's "flat tension mask" tube is covered by
more than 100 patents, said Charles J. Prazak, the company's tube technology
expert. He says there will be no competitors.;    But the flat tubes won't
appear in TV sets for at least a year, and HDTV isn't expected to become a
reality until 1994 at the earliest. That leaves Zenith with little but its
money-losing TV business to hang onto in the meantime.;    "Unless something
fundamentally changes about the cost structure of their (TV) business, or they
get some kind of decent cash infusion, I don't see how they can continue until
these HDTV revenues start coming," said David Schofield Jr., an analyst at the
Chicago investment firm Duff &amp; Phelps Inc.;    The tube's origins trace to
Zenith's entry into the computer business in 1979.;    When Zenith decided to
start making color computer monitors, "the Japanese had a seven- or eight-year
lead on us," Prazak said during a tour of the suburban Chicago factory, which
has produced conventional Zenith TV tubes for 26 years.;    Rather than try to
catch up -- and hindered by limited funds -- Zenith decided to reinvent the
computer tube, eliminating the curved front. That allowed Zenith to improve
the innards of tubes as well.;    In all TV and computer tubes, tiny dots of
red, blue and green phosphors are applied to the inside surface. When they are
struck by electrons shot from a "gun" in the rear of the tube, they glow in
the proper combination to form colors of the rainbow.;    Behind the dots is a
thin sheet of metal perforated with hundreds of thousands of holes. This
screen, called a shadow mask, directs the electron beams to the dots.;    In a
conventional tube, the shadow mask must be curved to fit the tube's face.
Because of the curvature, it cannot be applied firmly to the screen, and
instead is suspended by springs. That produces a drawback.;    The electron
beams cause the mask to heat up, allowing it to move slightly out of alignment
because it is on springs. That causes a flickering of colors noticed, for
example, when someone on TV is wearing a white shirt.;    Zenith's flat mask,
by contrast, is stretched taut, preventing it from moving. That allows the
tube to use a more powerful electron beam, producing a brighter picture with
higher contrast.;    Zenith has a few options should cash become tight. It
could sell its small non-TV businesses, which include making cable TV boxes.
Or it could try to raise money by selling bonds. But with a credit rating in
the junk bond category, it would have to pay steep interest rates, Schofield
said.;    Zenith took a major step to boost its finances when it sold its
respected line of desk-top and lap-top computers to France's Groupe Bull in
late 1989. The deal provided about $511 million in cash that Zenith used to
pare its debt, reducing interest payments.;    In another move to raise cash,
Zenith agreed in February to sell about 5 percent of newly issued stock to
Goldstar Co. Ltd., a South Korean electronics maker, for $15 million.;    As
part of that deal, Zenith will license its patents for flat picture tubes and
HDTV to Goldstar. The plan is for Goldstar to make flat-tube-equipped TVs for
sale primarily outside North America and to promote the Zenith-AT&amp;T technology
for HDTV in its own country if the technology is selected by the Federal
Communications Commission as the U.S. standard.;    Schofield said an unstated
reason for the Goldstar deal, or at least the timing of its announcement,
might have been to scare Nycor.;    Goldstar potentially could become a "white
knight" in a takeover fight, blocking Nycor by buying a controlling stake in
Zenith. Zenith denies such intentions.;    Schofield said there was irony in
the fact that Zenith, which takes pride in its status as the last U.S.-based
TV maker, looked abroad for help. But he said he believed Zenith spoke to a
number of companies about such a venture, including American ones, and
Goldstar was the one that came through.;    The deal offers the potential for
appreciable royalty revenue in the future, the analyst added.;    In an
interview last week, Jerry Pearlman, Zenith's chairman and president, was
asked how the company will manage until it sees a boost from its flat-screen
TV and HDTV technology.;    "When you have great technology and customers,
access to capital is not an issue," Pearlman said. "We run the business as
best we can, and we've been running it for the long term.";    Pearlman said
much of Zenith's fortunes lie in its patented flat-tube technology, which
provides brighter pictures with higher contrast and eliminates most of the
glare produced by conventional curved-front screens.;    Zenith already sells
the flat tubes to computer makers and plans to start using them in its TV sets
next year.;    Pearlman said the tubes, which can offer extremely high
resolution, will become increasingly desirable in the computer industry and
will help Zenith differentiate itself in the consumer TV market.;    But
Nycor, whose executives control the Fedders Corp. air conditioning business,
say they have a better plan to turn around Zenith.;    In letters to Zenith
stockholders, the New Jersey company says it would sell Zenith's non-TV
operations, cut manufacturing costs, invest more money in HDTV and give
employees incentives to act more like entrepreneurs.;    Nycor, which would
not make a representative available for an interview, said in the letters it
would use its experience boosting Fedders' market share to help Zenith. It
says Pearlman "does not have a viable business plan to restore Zenith to
profitability.";    At Zenith's stockholders meeting Wednesday, Nycor wants to
replace three of Zenith's 10 directors, including Pearlman, with its own
candidates. It says that should give it a platform to promote its turnaround
plan.;    Pearlman, a 20-year Zenith veteran, says Nycor doesn't know what it
is talking about. He calls Nycor's plans "business-school platitudes" that
show a lack of understanding of the TV market, where profit margins are razor
thin or non-existent because of price cutting.;    "You think that no one ever
thought of cutting costs and increasing market share?" he said in the
interview at Zenith's modern headquarters building in this Chicago suburb.;   
The FCC plans to start testing five competing HDTV proposals in July.
Schofield, the industry analyst, believes Zenith and AT&amp;T stand a good chance
of seeing their all-digital technology adopted. Pearlman appeared even more
certain.;    "We're confident that ours works. We have seen nothing to
indicate that the other digital proponents actually have workable solutions,"
Pearlman said. Digital technology would send television signals in
distortion-free computer language, as opposed to the radio-wave analog
technology used today.;    The winner of the FCC contest will gain royalty
revenue from licensing the technology to other TV makers. But even if it
loses, Zenith will benefit from HDTV by making sets based on whatever standard
wins, Pearlman said. He said the company's flat-tube technology will give its
HDTV sets an edge.;    If Zenith wins the FCC race, it will be another in a
series of technical achievements for the company. It invented the world's
first portable radio in 1924, the first wireless TV remote control in 1956,
stereo FM broadcasting in 1961 and stereo TV in 1984.  </TEXT>
