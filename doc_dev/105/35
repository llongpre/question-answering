   NBC's ``Miami Vice'' has thrived on style, and
executive producer Michael Mann is determined the detective series
will wrap up its fifth and final season the same way.
   ``For the final season, our writers are taking the mythology of
our best episodes seriously,'' said Mann. ``What we're trying to do
is write to that mythology. Our aim is to do a series of classic
`Vices.' The stories the writers are coming up with are on track.''
   What is that mythology?
   ``A hard-nosed attitude toward life,'' Mann replies. ``Yet, it's
not all grim and serious.''
   The decision to bring ``Miami Vice'' to an end wasn't lightly
made, but Mann and stars Don Johnson (playing Sonny Crockett) and
Philip Michael Thomas (Ricardo Tubbs) thought it was time to move
on. NBC has not officially acknowledged the decision to end the
series.
   ``It was by our election to end the show, so we're planning for
it,'' said Mann. ``As a result it's kind of liberating and has
generated a lot of enthusiasm. The show's going to be around a long
time in syndication and we all want it to end well. We're going to
end it with a two-hour episode. Salazar, a Latin American strong man
who can cut deals, will figure in that story.''
   The finale is still under wraps, but don't look for Sonny
Crockett to open a bait shop in the Keys and Ricardo Tubbs a charter
service in Bimini.
   The original concept of the show, which made its debut in
September 1984, was a kind of MTV cops. It pulsated with rock music
and vibrated with pastels. Its sparkling imagery came right out of a
music video.
   But this season, Sonny and Ricardo seem to wear only blacks and
grays, and the images seem to be filtered through sepia.
   Creator Anthony Yerkovich set the tone in the two-hour pilot
script, in which Sonny and Tubbs battled evil and corruption against
the backdrop of Florida's glitzy Gold Coast.
   The show was symbolized by the reflection of the neon and lights
in the black sheen of their Ferrari as they raced around Miami.
   Sonny Crockett was a vice detective whom Johnson played as a
knight errant in dented armor. He had a raspy voice, a three-day
beard, no socks and pastel Versace suits. His partner, Tubbs, played
by Thomas, was explained as a black New York street cop who first
came south to find the drug dealer who'd killed his brother. Edward
James Olmos played their taciturn boss, Lt. Martin Castillo.
   At the start of the fifth season, Sonny has been knocked cuckoo
and thinks he really is Sonny Burnett, his drug-dealing undercover
alter ego, and Mann is preparing for the windup. Sonny's brother
will show up this season and cause him trouble. A few loose ends
from various stories will also be taken care of.
   Although ``Miami Vice'' was rapped several years ago for
emphasizing style over content, Mann said he is now satisfied with
the scripts being turned out under the direction of Robert Ward. The
show got off the track when Mann temporarily left to direct
``Manhunter,'' based on Thomas Harris' suspense novel ``Red Dragon.''
   ``In the second season I went off to do the picture, and I
thought I had everything set up to function while I was gone,'' he
said. ``Forget about that. It was total meltdown. The first day of
shooting `Manhunter' I got a phone call from `Miami Vice.' All hell
had broken loose.
   ``There was no conscious attempt to rely on style. It's not in
the script. But once you set the style it becomes automatic. The art
director, costumers, editors all know what to look for. You don't
have to re-invent it every week. But you do have to re-invent the
story every week, and what we had was an absence of stories. The
style became more obvious because the story wasn't there.''
   After ``Miami Vice,'' Mann has a number of other projects lined
up. Among them is a six-hour miniseries for NBC based on Elaine
Shannon's ``Desperados.'' The book tells of Latin drug lords and the
murder of Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena of the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Agency.
