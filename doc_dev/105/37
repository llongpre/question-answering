multimedia industry may soon turn into a legal minefield

US computer software companies are up in arms over the granting of a basic
patent on multimedia databases to Compton's New Media, a small software
company best known for its development of an electronic multimedia
encyclopedia that is sold on a CD-Rom, similar to an audio compact disc.
Compton's has shocked the industry by announcing that it has been granted a
patent that covers any computer-controlled system that searches through a
database and retrieves text with images or audio or video information.
The company is seeking royalties amounting to 1 per cent of revenues from
sales of multimedia products ranging from personal computer databases to
interactive television. It has said that it will reduce or eliminate
royalties on the patent to software developers that use Compton's as a
distributor.
Many in the software industry are convinced that Compton's claim to have
invented a novel process for searching multimedia databases is false. 'This
patent basically claims that Compton's invented multimedia,' says Philip
Dodds, executive director of the Interactive Multimedia Association (IMA), a
trade association representing more than 260 companies in the rapidly
emerging multimedia industry.
Compton's patent covers a search system process that is common and
considered non-proprietary, the industry group maintains. Compton's patent
now seems certain to be challenged in the courts. Several industry groups
including the IMA and San Francisco's Multimedia Developers Group are
banding together in an effort to get the patent overturned.
Compton's, however, is determined to assert its patent rights. 'We simply
want the public to recognise Compton's NewMedia as the pioneer in this
industry, promote a standard that can be used by every developer and be
compensated for the investments we have made to make multimedia a reality
for developers and end users,' said Stanley Frank, president and chief
executive.
The dispute has raised strong feelings in the software industry because it
comes just as multimedia products appear set to break into the mainstream of
personal computing. Dozens of software companies have launched CD-Rom titles
for home and school use and sales of PCs complete with stereo sound and
video capabilities are booming.
The fledgling multimedia industry could soon turn into a legal battleground
says G. Gervaise Davis III, a partner in Davis &amp; Schroeder, a
California-based law firm specialising in intellectual property issues.
Thousands of multimedia patent applications have been filed in the past few
years, he notes.
However, the row over Compton's multimedia patent is only the latest example
of a much broader problem with software patents. Critics charge that
software patents covering basic ideas are stifling the creativity of the
small companies that have led innovation in the software industry by
limiting access to fundamental ideas.
Until seven years ago, the US Patent Office did not grant patents on
software. Since then, more than 10,000 software patents have been granted,
but there are as many as 15,000 software patent applications waiting for
approval.
Yet the US Patent Office is ill-equipped to examine properly these claims,
industry critics charge. The agency lacks the expertise or resources to
fully research 'prior art' that can invalidate patent applications. As a
result, several sweeping patents have been granted for basic computer
processes that are not novel, the IMA complains.
A group of US firms including Apple Computer, IBM, Digital Equipment, Lotus
Development and Microsoft have formed the Software Patent Institute, which
is building a database of software inventions for the Patent Office's use in
an effort to avert software patent disputes.
But Compton's patent issue is spurring industry pressure for broader
reforms. The IMA has called for the formation of an industry commission to
review pending patents and provide the Patent Office with the expertise it
currently lacks.
Some are also calling for changes in US patent laws to give patent
challengers an opportunity to make their case before a patent is granted.
Currently, in the US, patent filings are secret until approval is granted.
This means that anyone wishing to dispute a patent must either challenge the
patent in the courts or ask the Patent Office to re-examine the patent.
Both are lengthy and expensive procedures. In the meantime, the challenger
must pay royalties to the patent holder or run the risk of being liable for
triple damages for willfully infringing the patent.
Such disputes are nothing new in other sectors of the high-technology
industry such as semiconductors and computer hardware, where patents have
long been recognised as a primary means of protecting intellectual property
rights that enable innovators to recoup their investments in technology
development.
Yet in the software industry, patent rights are a relatively new phenomenon
and one that few developers have previously encountered. Although many may
see the dispute over Compton's patent as a threat to innovation, it may well
prove to be a catalyst for broader understanding of intellectual property
rights in the software industry and improvements in the patent process that
will eventually benefit all software developers.
