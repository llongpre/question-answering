<HEADLINE>  A STAR IS BORN: LASER DISC SALES ARE FINALLY TAKING
OFF  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     In a Christmas shopping season hobbled by recession, laser discs and laser
disc players are one of the few sources of holiday cheer for consumer
electronics retailers.;   Paul Kagan Associates Inc., a market research firm
in Carmel, estimates sales of laser discs will increase 57 percent in 1991 and
a further 40 percent in 1992; sales of laser disc players will jump 23 percent
this year and 16 percent in 1992.;   Total sales are still small. About 1
million households in the United States will have a laser disc player by the
end of next year, compared with 75 million households containing a
videocassette recorder.;   But most other types of home electronics are in the
doldrums. According to statistics compiled by the Electronic Industries
Association of Washington, D.C., sales of color televisions dropped 6 percent
in the first 11 months of this year and VCR sales inched up only 3 percent.;  
"Laser disc is a product whose time has come," said Bill Matthies of The
Verity Group, a research firm in Diamond Bar, an eastern suburb of Los
Angeles.;   After more than a decade on the market, the ingredients are
finally in place for rapid expansion of laser disc sales. If everything
follows according to the plans of manufacturers, household penetration could
reach 10 percent in five years.;   For the uninitiated, laser discs -- or LDs
-- are the video equivalent of compact discs -- or CDs -- for music.;   LDs
are 12 inches in diameter, about the size of the long-playing records pushed
out of existence by CDs, and are made of the same plastic that reflects a
rainbow hue of colors. Because LDs can store more information than videotapes,
laser disc players produce an image with 60 percent more resolution than the
VHS format used in videocassette recorders. What's more, LDs offer CD-quality
sound, especially important for the emerging market of "home theaters" that
combine big-screen televisions and stereo systems.;   "The larger your screen,
the more you need laser disc," said film critic Roger Ebert in a telephone
interview from his Chicago office. Ebert, best known for the television show
"Siskel and Ebert at the Movies," has been tirelessly recommending laser discs
to his readers and viewers for the past five years.;   LDs are becoming the
format of choice for movie collectors such as Ebert. Because the laser inside
a player doesn't actually touch the spinning disc, there is almost no wear --
a distinct contrast to videocassettes, which lose their picture quality after
repeated viewing. LD players also have the ability to jump instantly to any
spot on a disc. That isn't particularly important for watching movies, but is
a key feature for viewing music videos and certain types of children's
programming.;   Movie studios are helping develop the laser market by pricing
most LDs at $25 to $35, including new releases. Although some movies on
videocassette are sold at discount prices as low as $10, most new releases are
priced at $100 -- limiting their appeal to video rental stores.;   Laser discs
aren't new. The first players reached U.S. retailers in 1978, about the same
time VCRs were starting to gain popularity. But LDs never took off in the
1980s, because consumers wanted the ability to record programs -- something a
laser disc player can't do -- and because a competing laser system from RCA
called Selectavision failed in 1984 after several years on the market.;  
Laser discs are finally clicking with the public for several interrelated
reasons:;   (check) Home theater. The improved picture quality of a laser disc
is only marginal on a typical 19-inch television set, and the CD-quality sound
isn't noticeable on that TV's small, tinny speaker. But some 11 million
households now have big-screen televisions, defined as 27 inches or above, up
from 5 million households just two years ago. The better resolution and sound
is much more compelling on a big-screen TV.;   "If people see it once, they're
hooked," said Douglas Pratt, editor of The Laser Disc Newsletter in East
Rockaway, N.Y. "You can't watch something on VHS after you've seen it on
laser. All you notice are the flaws.";   About 500,000 to 750,000 homes now
have laser disc players, only a fraction of those with big-screen TVs, so
there is considerable room for growth.;   (check) Lower prices and "combi"
players. Until the last two years, prices for laser disc players started at
$1,000 -- out of reach for most consumers. But low-end LD players are now $400
and could drop another $100 in the next year or two. What's more, most models
on the market today are so-called "combi" players that also play standard
5-inch music CDs and 8-inch video CDs.;   (check) More manufacturers. After
laser disc flopped in the early 1980s, only one manufacturer stayed in the
market -- Pioneer Electronic Corp. of Japan. Retailers and consumers were
nervous about investing in a format with only a single company behind it,
perhaps because they remembered how Selectavision buyers were orphaned when
RCA dropped the system.;   In the last two years, however, the heavy hitters
of consumer electronics have finally decided to throw their weight behind
laser discs. Matshushita, through its Panasonic line, and Sony have both
started selling laser disc players in the U.S; Sony also added an LD
production line at its CD plant in Terre Haute, Ind.;   The presence of Sony
and Panasonic will do more than resolve consumer jitters. The two companies
have much broader distribution networks than Pioneer, which mostly sells
through stereo shops, so that laser disc players are showing up more and more
in high-volume electronics stores.;   (check) More titles. Back when Pioneer
was going it alone in laser disc, there were only a few hundred movies
available on laser disc and few stores sold LDs. There are now 7,000 movies
and music videos on the market and laser discs are sold nationwide. Some video
stores are also beginning to rent laser discs.;   "We finally felt the market
had got to a critical size where it made sense for us to get into the
business," said Geoff Holmes, a senior vice president of Time Warner Inc. In
August, Time Warner started producing LDs at its disc-pressing plant in
Oliphant, Pa.;   The future for laser discs is far from guaranteed, however.; 
 Consumer electronics technology is poised for massive change in ways that are
hard to predict. Cable television systems, for example, are trying to develop
"video-on-demand" systems that would supply a wide variety of movies at the
push of a button. If video-on-demand is a success, it could undermine the
demand for laser discs.;   Laser discs also could be hurt by technological
improvements in VCRs, although a new high-resolution format called Super VHS
hasn't been selling well.;   But new technology could also help the laser
format. Pioneer has developed a recordable laser disc system, priced at $30,00
for professional use. If Pioneer or another manufacturer can invent a low-cost
version, laser discs could eventually displace VCRs.  </TEXT>
