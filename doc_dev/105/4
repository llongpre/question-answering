<HEAD>House Authorizes Five-Year Plan For Supercollider</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has voted to authorize the
superconducting supercollider but refused to guarantee Texas'
investment in the $7.4 billion project.
   The bill, approved 309-109 Wednesday, allows the Department of
Energy to build the particle accelerator near Waxahachie, Texas.
   Costs above $5 billion would be left to Texas, which has pledged
$1 billion, and other sources, including foreign investors.
   House members by a 256-163 vote approved an amendment calling
for the U.S. government to return Texas' investment if the Energy
Department cancels the project before October 1995.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said the vote did not assure
Congress would fully fund the project. Spending will have to be
approved later during Congress' annual appropriations process.
   The bill was sent to the Senate, but the supercollider will not
likely be authorized by the full chamber. An aide to Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, said senators probably will act on the collider
during appropriations.
   The supercollider is a 54-mile underground ring in which streams
of protons guided by electromagnets would be hurled at almost the
speed of light until they smash together and break into even
smaller particles.
   Scientists say the supercollider would recreate the physical
state in the moment after the Big Bang, which some believe was the
beginning of the universe.

<HEAD>Administration Wants to Link Pay to Performance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Bush administration officials say a plan to
link federal employees' pay to performance would provide extra
compensation for workers who live in New York, Los Angeles and San
Francisco.
   The proposal also would let the government ignore salary caps
for hiring 400 ``world class'' experts for such fields as nuclear
safety and medical research, Constance Newman, director of the
Office of Personnel Management, said Wednesday in releasing the
administration's pay proposal.
   ``We're having trouble recruiting and retaining people to run
this government,'' Newman said of the plan, which would affect
about 1.4 million white-collar workers.
   Congress in the past has rejected similar pay-for-performance
proposals, but Ms. Newman said lawmakers are beginning to realize
the government's inability to compete with private industry.
   The plan was introduced in both the House and the Senate this
week.
   Unions representing federal employees criticized the proposal
last month, saying government pay cannot be reformed without
additional money.
   The OPM's plan, which provides an additional $1.5 billion for
the 1991 fiscal year, would award raises based on performance
rather than tenure.
   In addition, the OPM, which handles personnel matters for the
federal bureaucracy, is asking for congressional authority to
eliminate the system that awards annual pay increases.
   The administration's plan calls for providing geographic
differentials to employees in certain cities where the federal
government has the most trouble competing with private industry.

<HEAD>`Father of Television' Honored With US Capitol Statue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American inventor Philo T. Farnsworth, a
pioneer of television, was honored when a 7-foot bronze likeness of
the electronics genius was dedicated in the U.S. Capitol.
   The deceased inventor was extolled as the father of television
as his statue was placed in the pantheon of famous Americans of the
Capitol's National Statuary Hall on Wednesday. His 81-year-old
widow, Elma Farnsworth, attended the ceremony.
   ``I think it's an honor long overdue,'' said Bruce Barnson, who
headed a commission that raised $250,000 to place Farnsworth near
the likeness of a better-known Utah native, Brigham Young.
   ``I want to thank you all from the bottom of my heart ... for
this great honor,'' Mrs. Farnsworth told the audience.
   The statue by Utah sculptor James Avanti depicts Farnsworth
holding an image dissector tube that was the heart of the
electronic television system he conceived as a 15-year-old high
school student in 1922.
   Farnsworth is called in an inscription at on the base of the
statue the ``Father of Television.''
   Farnsworth gained the first patent on his system in 1934 after
winning a patent battle with the powerful RCA corporation, which
later paid him $1 million to use his many patents.
