   The Smithsonian Institution was prepared to say
two University of Pennsylvania researchers invented the computer
until an Iowa congressman who helps hold the museum's purse strings
said Iowa State University should get the credit.
   The solution: Honor many ``early developments.''
   University of Pennsylvania researchers John W. Mauchly and J.
Presper Eckert completed building their ENIAC machine in 1945.
Utilizing thousands of vacuum tubes and taking up an entire
basement, it is often cited as the first electronic digital computer.
   But was it really?
   Rep. Neal Smith, the No. 3 Democrat on the House Appropriations
Committee, insists the credit should go to physicist John V.
Atanasoff and graduate student Clifford Berry, who developed a
smaller machine at Iowa State University from 1937 to 1941.
   In an attempt to assuage Smith's wounded pride, the National
Museum of American History _ preparing a major exhibition on
information technology _ has decided to spread the credit among
several computer pioneers.
   ``We will not be presenting the ENIAC as the `original' or
`first' computer,'' said the museum's director, Roger M. Kennedy, in
a letter to Smith.
   He wrote that ``our presentation will rather show that there were
many early developments that led to the emergence of the computer
industry ... including of course the work of John Atanasoff and the
development of the ENIAC at the University of Pennsylvania.''
   The exhibition also will recognize the pioneering work of Howard
Aiken at Harvard and George Stibitz at Bell Laboratories, Kennedy
said.
   What touched off the computer-inventor tiff was a newsletter
issued by the Smithsonian Institution, which runs the museum, saying
that the exhibition would include ``a walk through the ENIAC, the
first electronic digital computer.''
   Smith fired off a letter to Kennedy saying he was ``gravely
concerned'' that the exhibition would jeopardize the museum's
``unrivaled reputation ... for historical accuracy.''
   The congressman cited a 1973 federal court decision that
invalidated patents obtained by Mauchly and Eckert for ENIAC
(Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer). The court held that
``Eckert and Mauchly did not themselves first invent the automatic
electronic digital computer'' but instead derived their machine from
the work done earlier at Iowa State.
   ``I strongly urge you to review the documented facts of record
relating to Dr. Atanasoff's invention in the interests of avoiding
what would be both a historical inaccuracy and a monumental
injustice to a great American inventor,'' Smith wrote.
   In his reply, Kennedy said the museum was negotiating with Iowa
State for loan of the last remaining piece of the original
Atanasoff-Berry computer _ the memory drum _ and also a
``reconstructed breadboard model of the central unit.''
   ``These will be prominently displayed with appropriate
photographs and information about Atanasoff's role,'' he wrote.
   That was not enough for Smith. He still isn't satisfied.
   ``Mr. Kennedy's letter was welcome but it offered no new
information and failed to allay the concerns I had expressed,'' the
congressman said Friday in a statement.
   ``The central question is not whether Dr. Atanasoff's work will
be included in some minor way in the exhibition. The question is:
Will he be recognized as the inventor of the first electronic
digital computer, in accordance with the historical fact?''
   Smith suggested that the Atanasoff-Berry machine be exhibited as
the first electronic digital computer and the ENIAC as the first
programmable computer.
   ``The interests of both justice and history would be served and
the reputation of the Smithsonian for historical accuracy would not
be tarnished,'' Smith said.
   The corporate descendent of the ENIAC, meanwhile, is continuing
to side with Mauchly and Eckert. The University of Pennsylvania
researchers founded a company that was taken over by Sperry Rand in
1950, and Sperry subsequently merged with Burroughs to form Unisys
Corp.
   ``Complex inventions like the computer rarely have just one
parent,'' said John B. Wise, chief technology officer for Unisys.
``Encyclopedias generally start the history of the computer with the
invention of the abacus and list dozens of major contributors to
what is generally accepted as the first electronic digital computer,
the ENIAC.''
