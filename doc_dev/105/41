   Konosuke Matsushita, an inventor who founded of
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., one of the world's largest
manufacturers of consumer electronics, died of pneumonia today, a
hospital official said. He was 94.
   Matsushita had been in poor health and was admitted to
Matsushita Memorial Hospital in Osaka on April 5 for treatment of a
cold, a company official said.
   Quitting school at age 10 to go to work, Matsushita remained
faithful to the values he learned growing up as the youngest of
nine children in Wakayama in western Japan.
   He built his global electronics empire from an electric socket
business he began in 1918.
   The company grew into more than 450 companies in 37 countries,
with brands including Panasonic, National, Quasar and Technics.
Sales totaled $30.3 billion in the fiscal year ending in March.
   ``I have many memories of him,'' Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
said today. ``He was like a god.''
   ``I have simply done common things commonly well, doing what I
should do and abstaining from what I should not,'' Matsushita once
wrote. ``In short, I have lived my daily life at the dictates of
common sense.''
   Later in life, he espoused a philosophy of ``peace and happiness
through prosperity,'' a kind of benevolent capitalism he preached
through his own publishing company and a weekly magazine with a
circulation of 1.5 million. His views were criticized, however, as
being a religion of worldly interests.
   Born Nov. 27, 1894, Matsushita grew up in a well-to-do
environment but was forced to quit school and work after his
father, a farmer, lost the family fortune speculating in rice
futures.
   After apprenticeships with a dealer of charcoal-burning stoves
and a bicycle maker, Matsushita began working for the Osaka
Electric Light Co. in 1910. He stayed there seven years, until he
quit to begin his electric socket business with his wife, Mumeno,
and her brother.
   As an inventor, Matsushita registered more than 100 patents. His
first was for a successful two-way socket he invented while
confined to home because of poor health.
   Centering around consumer appliances, his Osaka-based company's
products ranged from television sets, washing machines and
refrigerators to video tape recorders and microwave ovens.
   Matsushita was known in the business world for his
unconventional ideas, such as turning assembly line workers into
door-to-door salesmen during a 1974 recession, and once advocating
that Japan bulldoze 20 percent of its mountains to provide
reclaimed land for the crowded nation.
   He received honorary degrees from several of Japan's most
prestigious universities, and, in 1979 started his own school of
government and business.
   He wrote more than 50 books, including a 1975 best-seller titled
``How to Rescue Crumbling Japan,'' and received one of the Japanese
government's highest honors, the Order of the Rising Sun First
Class, as well as medals and honors from the Netherlands, Belgium,
Spain, and Malaysia.
   Matsushita is survived by his wife, Mumeno, 93, and daughter,
Sachiko, 68. The daughter's husband, Masaharu Matsushita, 76, was
adopted into the family and now is the company chairman.
   A Matsushita official said funeral services would be held Sunday
at Honganji Tsumura Betsuin Temple in Osaka, western Japan.
