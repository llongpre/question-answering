   Frozen for nearly 100 years in the same
position _ his ear pricked up to the sound of a gramophone _ Nipper
the RCA dog is coming to life and gaining a smart-alecky sidekick.
   In television commercials airing for the first time Sunday, the
internationally known RCA mascot and his new companion will promote
a new line of ``Home Theatre'' color television models and a lineup
of 8mm camcorders, RCA's parent company announced Wednesday.
   ``The two dogs will serve as an appropriate `balancing act' as
we continue to expand our customer base,'' said Martin J. Holleran,
president and chief executive officer of Thomson Consumer
Electronics' American sales and marketing divison.
   ``The younger dog is the focus for the new designs and advanced
features of today's RCA products, while `Nipper' represents RCA's
traditional values of reliability and ease of use,'' he said.
   Thompson is a French-owned company that bought the RCA and GE
home electronics lines from General Electric Co. in 1987.
   Executives of Thompson wrestled with the idea of bringing Nipper
back for advertisements for several years, said spokesman Greg
Zehner.
   ``It's just that we couldn't figure out how to make him work
best,'' he said. ``It was too dated.''
   Ammirati &amp; Puris, a New York advertising firm, suggested earlier
this year that the company use a live dog to represent Nipper and
find a look-alike puppy to play the more modern role.
   ``We knew we had to update him, so we invented this little
whippersnapper to be his foil,'' said David Fowler, an associate
creative director at Ammirati &amp; Puris who worked on the new
campaign.
   Nipper was created in the 1890s by London painter Francis
Barraud. Barraud depicted the terrier listening to ``His Master's
Voice'' emanating from a gramophone. He sold the painting to the
Gramophone Co. after replacing the cylinder-type phonograph with a
disc version.
   In 1900, the North American rights to the painting were acquired
and Nipper was used to launch the Consolidated Talking Machine Co.,
later to become the Victor Talking Machine Co. RCA purchased Victor
and the rights to use Nipper in 1929.
   RCA, in turn, was bought by GE in 1986. GE continues to use the
RCA name for some products, but it sold the RCA and GE names for
home electronics to Thomson.
   ``He is one of the oldest advertising syumbols in the world,''
Fowler said. ``The Coca-Cola symbol is the only better known symbol
in the world than the dog and the horn.''
   Before bringing Nipper back, Ammirati conducted a survey to
judge his name recognition and popularity.
   ``We went all over the country, asking whether they like him,
whether we should keep him,'' Fowler said. ``And people told us,
`Are you kidding? Of course you have to use Nipper.'
   ``We didn't bring him back simply for nostalgic benefit because
nostalgia is anathema to electronics. We brought him back because
he's a good symbol.''
   The agency found the dogs for the ads in a New York animal
shelter run by animal trainers. The new Nipper was insured for
$500,000 before seven days of filming this summer, Fowler said.
   Two of the commercials will debut Sunday night on ABC's
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' Fowler said. Each of the spots
contains three vignettes demonstrating RCA product features. Nipper
and his sidekick will also appear in print advertising and on the
company's brochures.
   In all the advertisements, the puppy plays the part of the
adventurous, wise-cracking offspring who always gets the best of
Nipper.
   ``He's sort of a smart aleck, a hot dog, a little hot shot,''
Fowler said. ``He's like you. He has all the answers and he's not
afraid to talk about them. The big dog is more staid, like your
father.''
   ``We hope they can tell the company's story for the next 100
years,'' Fowler said.
