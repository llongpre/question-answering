   You know the voice of the grown-up Kevin
Arnold on ABC's ``The Wonder Years,'' but you probably don't know
the man behind the voice is actor-director Daniel Stern.
   Stern gets no regular screen credit for the narration, and when
he auditioned he was known only as ``No. 6.'' His name does appear
when he directs an episode of the hit comedy that focuses on Kevin
as a 13-year-old in the 1960s. He's directed seven so far.
   ``I'd never done voiceover before so I've had to learn as I went
along,'' said Stern. ``I like my part. There's a lot of emotions
and conflict to be acted out. I think it's good that the narrator
is an adult. It wouldn't be as effective if the narrator was
Kevin's age. It's a good device that helps pull the stories
together.''
   Stern provides the ironic footnotes for ``The Wonder Years,''
which won an Emmy as best comedy series in 1988 after its premiere
that January. Fred Savage stars as 13-year-old Kevin.
   The show wouldn't be nearly as funny, nor as poignant, without
the acerbic comments from Stern.
   He's never appeared in the show. ``I almost did once,'' he said,
``but I don't want to do that. I don't want to goof around with it.
The show means something to a lot of people. You don't want it to
be too in or too jokey.''
   Only once has his name been listed as narrator. That came when
he directed his first episode, called ``Pottery Will Get You
Nowhere.'' It was about a year ago, in the second season.
   ``I did it for my mother,'' he said. ``I think it works out
better not to have my name listed.''
   His brother, David Stern, was the original story consultant for
``The Wonder Years,'' but has since left.
   ``At the time I was auditioning for the show I got my brother a
job as a production assistant on `Born in East L.A.,''' he said.
``I played a great sleazy character. I showed David a copy of the
pilot script and he wrote a script on speculation. They hired him
as a staff writer.''
   Stern has played sleazy characters in other movie roles. In
``Leviathan,'' he was a diver and crew member whose morals were
also at the bottom of the ocean. Despite the numerous underwater
sequences, he said he never got his feet wet. Instead of water,
they made their way through smoke tinted by colored lights to look
like water. Special air vents on their boots blew sand on the floor
so that it appeared to be washed about.
   Stern mostly acts in feature motion pictures, such as ``Diner,''
``Hannah and Her Sisters,'' ``Blue Thunder,'' ``The Milagro
Beanfield War'' and ``One-Trick Pony.'' His only television series
was ``Hometown'' on CBS five years ago.
   He'd hoped to reprise his character of Shrevie from ``Diner''
for Barry Levinson's latest movie, ``Avalon,'' but the one-day role
had to be filmed on Thanksgiving Day on location in Baltimore.
Stern had 10 relatives coming for Thanksgiving dinner and had to
turn it down.
   ``When I was hired to narrate I said I'd like to direct,'' he
said. ``I went to the set and met everyone. I observed Steve Miner
direct the pilot. He sort of invented the style and directed a lot
of the shows the first season.
   ``I feel comfortable directing. I've been in about 30 movies and
the last 15 I've kept my eyes open to the process, as opposed to
just sitting in my trailer when I wasn't needed. I took a role in
`My Blue Heaven' just to watch Herbert Ross work. I did that with
Sidney Lumet and `Daniel' and Woody Allen and `Hannah and Her
Sisters' and `Stardust Memories.'''
   His newest movie is ``Coupe De Ville,'' due in March, about
three brothers who take an old car across country.
   ``They sort of get to know each other on the trip,'' Stern said.
``I was in that car forever. I do all the driving.''
   Stern lived for 12 years in New York before moving to Los
Angeles. He and his wife have three children.
