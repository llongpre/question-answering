overrated

Filippo Maria Pandolfi, the European Community research commissioner, is
close to concluding a new directive on satellite TV.
The directive has the support of the European electronics industry and
broadcasters. It also has the backing of Lord Chapple.
Frank Chapple was the redoubtable general secretary of the UK's electrical
and electronics union. Now, ennobled, he is president of Britain's
television manufacturers' association. Earlier this month he endorsed
Pandolfi's efforts to create a single European satellite broadcasting
standard, based on the Mac system.
His backing for Mac was not altogether surprising. Mac, touted as the
European route to high definition television, is a British invention. Far
more surprising is that Britain has a television manufacturers' association.
The last significant British-owned television maker, Ferguson, was acquired
by Thomson of France in 1987.
So who does the British Radio and Electronic Equipment Manufacturers'
Association (Brema) represent? Ferguson is still a member, as is the UK
branch of Philips of the Netherlands. But of Brema's 15 members, 10 are
Japanese. Japanese television manufacturers have been busily building
factories in the UK since 1974.
The worrying question for the champions of Mac, such as Thomson and Philips,
is why Japanese companies are backing the system. Mac was to be a home-grown
European answer to Japan's high definition Muse system, ensuring that
companies such as Thomson and Philips remained among the leaders in
international consumer electronics.
A 1986 EC directive required all satellite broadcasters to use the European
system. They would begin with either D-Mac in Britain or with D2-Mac in the
rest of Europe. D-Mac and D2-Mac are not high definition systems, but they
do provide better images than those currently seen on European screens. The
next step would be for broadcasters to move on to HD-Mac, Europe's own high
definition system, giving local companies an advantage over Japanese
competitors.
The directive expires at the end of the year and the Commission hopes to
present a new one to telecommunications ministers on June 3. The accord will
result in all satellite broadcasters using D2-Mac.
So why are Japanese companies supporting a system devised to exclude them?
Anyone who talks to Japanese electronics executives soon learns the answer.
They would have liked the Europeans to adopt Muse. But failing that, the
Japanese say they do not really mind what standard the Europeans choose for
high definition television, provided they have one. Whatever the
broadcasting system is, they say, they will manufacture the equipment to
receive it.
The UK-based Japanese set makers have proved themselves formidable exporters
to the rest of Europe. Sony, which has a factory in South Wales, has won
three Queen's Awards for Export. So successful have the British-based
Japanese companies' exports been that the UK last year had a Pounds 271m
trade surplus in television sets.
The D2-Mac patent is held by European companies and organisations. They
could make life difficult for Japanese companies which request manufacturing
licences. The Japanese say they will fight any attempt to deny them access
to the European high definition industry. It is unlikely that they can be
excluded forever.
If D2-Mac does become widely accepted in Europe, Thomson and Philips will
have won one battle. The war, however, will not have started. Its weapons
will not be directives or government subsidies, but design, price and
reliability - weapons that Lord Chapple's troops have learned to wield with
devastating effect.
