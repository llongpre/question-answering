   Harold W. Schaefer, an inventor and
former president of Eureka Co., the vacuum cleaner manufacturer,
died Monday at age 79, company spokesmen said.
   An electrical engineer and the holder of more than 100 patents,
Schaefer joined Eureka in 1962 and served as president and director
until his retirement in 1980.
   The Chicago native, born Feb. 16, 1909, worked as a young man
for Chicago-based Majestic Radio, where he invented a power supply
system considered an important component in the development of the
radio industry.
   From 1941 to 1943, he served as director of engineering and
manufacturing for the applied physics laboratory at Johns Hopkins
University in Baltimore, where he worked on projects for the U.S.
Office of Scientific Research and Development.
   In 1943, Schaefer became manager of facilities planning and
radio and television product development for RCA Corp., but he left
the following year to become division manager in charge of
engineering, manufacturing and product development for the
Westinghouse Electric Corp.
   Schaefer joined Philco in 1950 as vice president and director of
engineering of consumer and commercial products and later became
general manager of the appliance division.
   Schaefer is survived by his wife Mary and a son, Harold.
