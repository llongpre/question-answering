   Kenjiro Takayanagi, known as the father of Japanese
television, has died of pneumonia, company officials said today. He
was 91.
   Takayanagi died Monday night in a hospital in Yokosuka, near
Tokyo, the officials said.
   An electrical engineer, Takayanagi achieved the first television
transmission in Japan in 1926 and developed the main component of a
television camera in 1933 only months after it was invented by
Vladimir K. Zworykin in the United States.
   After teaching at a Japanese college, he worked for the Japan
Broadcasting Co. (NHK) and then at the Victor Co. of Japan, where
he later became vice president.
   Masaru Ibuka, honorary chairman of competitor Sony Corp., told
Kyodo News Service that ``(Takayanagi) was a true technician who
developed the television, which people had only dreamed about, from
nothing.''
   Takayanagi was awarded by the Japanese government with the Order
of Culture in 1981, the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred
Treasure in 1989 and various other prizes for his work in advancing
television technology.
   Takayanagi was born in Hamamatsu in central Japan in 1899.
   Funeral arrangements were pending, and there was no immediate
word of survivors.
