<LEADPARA>  It was the blues -- and a little bit of folk, country and soul -- that got
this year's crop of inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.;    The new
members, inducted Wednesday night, included blues great John Lee Hooker,
rhythm and blues artists LaVern Baker, Ike and Tina Turner and the late Jimmy
Reed, soulful Wilson Pickett, the Impressions and country-folk-rock pioneers
the Byrds.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Also inducted during ceremonies subdued by the outbreak of war in the
Persian Gulf was the late blues legend Howlin' Wolf, who was honored as an
early influence on rock 'n' roll. The late record producer Nesuhi Ertegun was
cited for lifetime achievement.;    Ahmet Ertegun, the hall's chairman, began
the evening with the announcement that "America and its allies have gone to
war.";    A long moment of silence followed. Before the ceremony at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel began, President Bush's speech to the nation was
broadcast on a large screen set up to show clips of the performers being
honored.;    Like some past ceremonies, the sixth annual event had its
controversy, this time over which members of the Impressions were being
inducted.;    Only the original members of the Byrds -- Roger McGuinn, David
Crosby, Gene Clark, Chris Hillman and Michael Clarke -- were inducted. That
left out the late Gram Parsons, whose pioneering country-rock sound has been
widely hailed as among rock's most inventive styles.;    It wasn't clear if
only the original members of the Impressions -- Curtis Mayfield, Jerry Butler,
Richard Brooks, Arthur Brooks and Sam Gooden -- were included. But Fred Cash,
who replaced Butler early on, felt he was being left out.;    "I'm mad about
it," he told reporters before the ceremony.;    Mayfield, who was paralyzed
from the neck down in a stage accident at a concert last year, addressed the
audience by television hookup from his home in Atlanta.;    "If it weren't for
the Impressions I would have never seen my dreams come true nor counted my
blessings," he said.  </TEXT>
