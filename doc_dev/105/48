television screen promises to shake up the global market

The consumer electronics industry has been searching desperately for ways to
revitalise the television market. There has been much excitement in the
industry over wide-screen television and, further ahead, high-definition
equipment.
But a different kind of television unveiled by Matsushita Electric of Japan
could be just what the industry needs to spark demand among consumers for
new sets.
Matsushita's television boasts a flat screen that is a third of the depth of
conventional sets. Matsushita calls the new product Flat Vision and believes
it can capture more than 10 per cent of the world's display market by the
end of the decade.
The 14-inch television, which Matsushita will sell in Japan from October 1,
has a screen that is less than 10cm in depth, compared with about 34cms for
conventional televisions of the same size which use cathode ray tubes.
Matsushita also plans to introduce computers and multimedia devices using
the flat panel. If the company succeeds in overcoming some technological
hitches, televisions on the wall may become a reality earlier than expected.
The starting point for Flat Vision lay in what appears to have been an
inspiration from the research and development staff at Matsushita. While
consumer electronics makers have tried to make thinner televisons, doing so
with conventional technology, which uses CRTs, was always a problem. CRTs
are necessarily bulky, with an electron beam at the back of the tube to scan
colour dots on the screen's face and produce a moving picture. The tubes are
thick to allow the electron beam enough room to be bent to reach the outer
edges of the screen.
Matsushita has overcome the problem by replacing the bulky electron beam
with a matrix of 9,746 tiny tubes that are lined up to form the shape of a
television screen.
Flat Vision consists of 44 vertical wire cathode tubes, with 222 minitubes
per wire cathode on the backplate which emit the electrons. There are five
control plates and a fluorescent surface with colour phosphor strips on the
surface.
The picture is created through the illumination of the fluorescent front
surface by the electrons, with a separate electron beam source for each of
the 9,746 tubes. Each minitube thus acts like a CRT, scanning six lines of
two sets of the three colour elements (red, blue and green) to form the
picture.
Flat Vision retains the CRT advantage of being self-illuminating and
therefore very bright. 'By allocating only small areas of the display to
each electron beam source, the company was able to achieve a much slimmer
body than if one electron beam was responsible for the entire display area,'
Matsushita says.
The closeness of the cathode to the faceplate, the fluorescent surface which
contains colour dots, means it is easy to aim the electron beam to the
proper colour and this enhances the picture clarity and brightness. Since
the Flat Vision screen has a grid of small CRTs there is no blurring at the
edges of the screen, allowing a wider viewing angle than conventional
televisions.
There is still much to be improved upon in Matsushita's screen. The company
admits that because the glass of the screen is flat, it is not as strong as
the curved CRT screen and is therefore more vulnerable to pressure. This
makes it difficult to produce televisions larger than 20 inches until a
further breakthrough in the technology.
The electronics team at SG Warburg, the securities company, believes that
because Flat Vision splits up the screen into a large number of minitubes it
creates faint horizontal lines on the screen in high-resolution
applications, making Flat Vision in its current state unsuitable for
high-definition television.
Its high power consumption also means it is unlikely to become a viable
alternative to liquid crystal display technology found in portable
applications, SG Warburg says.
Matsushita's Flat Vision product will go on sale in Japan at a cost of
Y288,000 (Pounds 1,811). The company initially plans 1,000 units to be
produced a month.
By 2000, Matsushita believes that Flat Vision will sell about 25m units
annually, or more than 10 per cent of the annual worldwide display market
which it forecasts will be 217m units, up from 140m units today, including
CRT and LCD devices.
To meet its forecasts the company plans to start licensing the technology,
for which it already has over 133 domestic patents, to third parties. It has
applied for another 1,300 patents in Japan.
