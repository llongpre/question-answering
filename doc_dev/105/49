<LEADPARA>  If Japanese consumer electronics companies have their way, in the future
people will do more in their cars than just drive -- they'll watch a color TV,
sing on a karaoke system and fax their friends.;   Those were just a few of
the hundreds of new consumer products on display here Saturday at the annual
Japan Electronics Show. More than 30 electronics companies, all but a handful
Japanese, offered a glimpse of what manufacturers believe will strike a
buyer's fancy in the coming years.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Thousands of visitors packed a convention hall to get "hands on" experience
with everything from a digital audio tape machine to a personal relaxation
system called "Mother." Unlike similar shows in the United States that are
primarily for business executives, the Japan Electronics Show was open to the
public for half its four-day run. In all, 360,000 people saw the displays.;  
Overall, the look of the show was sleek and futuristic. Most of the products
on display had the trademark Japanese slick design, and a wide range of items
-- from phones to television sets -- were available in pastel and primary
colors and the latest neon brights.;   Some products -- like Sony Corp.'s
ultrathin compact disc player -- simply improved upon existing technology.
Others -- like high-definition television sets with short, wide screens --
aimed to break new ground. The rectangular TVs allow a viewer to zoom in on an
object on the screen, pull back for a panoramic view or even watch several
shows at the same time.;   But don't plan to buy these products in a local
electronics store any time soon. Although Casio will begin selling an
automotive color TV in the United States later this year, most companies say
it could be two years or more before many of the products are available
outside of Japan. Most of them, however, will hit the Japanese market this
year.;   As would be expected, these products are still at the pricey stage. A
36-inch HDTV receiver will cost about $15,000 -- and at that price even
usually enthusiastic Japanese consumers aren't buying them, several exhibitors
said. An "intelligent" fax and answering machine, which automatically routes
calls to either device, will sell for about $1,500.;   If there was one "hot"
item common to almost every exhibit, it was the idea of a portable, personal
karaoke system. Invented in Japan, karaoke lets a person sing along with a
popular song but suppresses the recorded words so the singer's voice is easily
heard. Karaoke bars are very popular in Japan -- and there are quite a few on
the West Coast as well -- so Japanese companies like Sanyo think they have
come up with a sure winner.;   Sanyo showed a "CD Pot," which is a compact
disc player with a microphone for karaoke singing. It is shaped like a rice
pot -- complete with carrying handle -- and comes in black, red and yellow.
Sony's new Video Walkman can be mounted in a car. With the vocals turned off,
it can be used as a karaoke system.;   Pioneer's most popular display was its
"Mother" exhibit. Attendees were invited to lie down on a couch and strap
themselves into a biofeedback-like machine. Their heads were placed under a
dome, where blinking lights flashed repeatedly either to stimulate or to
soothe.;   "Mother" is a long way from home use, a Pioneer spokesman said, but
Pioneer hopes to sell it to companies for stressed-out employees. No price was
available.;   Sony continued to add new products to its popular "Man" family,
showing the MiniDisc for the first time. The handheld device plays tiny
two-inch compact discs and has both video and audio capability. Sony
demonstrated it with Michael Jackson's "Bad" video. Sony also showed Data
DiscMan, a so-called personal education tool that combines pictures with sound
and text and could be used, for instance, as an electronic encyclopedia or a
foreign language tutor.;   In the midst of the more offbeat items were a
profusion of televisions. And there were two trends that might seem at odds
with one another: TVs are getting bigger -- and smaller. From enormous 55-inch
screens that made a character nearly life-size to two-inch screens on which
the same person would be the size of a fingerprint, Japanese companies like
Toshiba, Panasonic and Citizen showcased dozens of new televisions with an
emphasis on HDTV.;   High-definition television creates ultra-sharp resolution
by packing more lines on the screen than a normal television.  </TEXT>
