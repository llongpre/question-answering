   Inventors whose developments have affected
nearly every American in one way or another, and led to major
changes in society, will be added to the National Inventors Hall of
Fame.
   Special ceremonies have been scheduled for March 27 to honor the
developers of oral contraceptives, computer memory, television
receivers and elevators, the U.S. Patent Office announced Friday.
   The four new members will be inducted in ceremonies at the
Patent Office in Arlington, Va. They bring to 72 the membership in
the Hall of Fame, which was opened in 1973 with a plaque honoring
Thomas A. Edison.
   New members of the Hall of Fame are:
   _Elisha Graves Otis of Halifax, Vt., who patented the elevator
in 1861.
   _Frank B. Colton, born in Poland, who received patents for oral
contraceptives in 1954 and 1955.
   _Louis W. Parker, born in Budapest, Hungary, who is credited
with developing the television receiver.
   _An Wang, a native of Shanghai, China, who developed the
magnetic pulse controlling device, the principle on which computer
memory operates.
   Graves becomes the latest inductee selected for development of
products that have become nearly universal.
   Others whose work is similarly well known include Edison for his
electric light, the Wright brothers for airplanes, Charles Goodyear
for vulcanized rubber and Rudolf Diesel for the internal combustion
engine.
   Colton joins Carl Djerassi, an Austrian-born chemist who was
inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1978 for his pioneering work on
oral contraceptives.
   Parker's television receiver glows in nearly every American home
today, and in the Hall of Fame he joins William D. Coolidge, who
invented the vacuum tube; Vladimir Zworykin, who developed the
cathode ray tube used for television pictures and Philo T.
Farnsworth, who developed the scanning, contrast and focusing
systems for television.
   In the development of computers, An Wang joins several other
pioneers already in the Hall of Fame. They include calculating
machine pioneer William Seward Burroughs; George R. Stibitz who
developed modern complex computer systems; Robert N. Noyce, a
pioneer in developing semiconductor devices; Jack S. Kilby who
developed miniaturized circuits and Jay W. Forrester, a leader in
early digital information storage.
