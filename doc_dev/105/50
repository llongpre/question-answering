   Producers Blake Edwards and Tony Adams filed
a $28 million malicious prosecution lawsuit against MGM@UA
Entertainment Corp. and United Artist Corp., alleging there was no
basis for a cross-complaint filed against the producers.
   The $250 million cross-complaint filed in April 1984 accused
Edwards and Adams of fraud and spending more than necessary to
produce the films ``Victor@Victoria,''``Trail of the Pink
Panther,''``Curse of the Pink Panther'' and ``Revenge of the Pink
Panther.''
   The cross-complaint was filed after the producers sued the
studios in 1983 for breach of contract in connection with the
release of three films. Edwards and Adams later received $1.2
million in damages.
   The producers filed their suit Monday. The studios dropped their
cross-complaint last month, the suit said.

   The character Erica Kane on ABC's ``All My
Children,'' played by actress Susan Lucci, is the ``grand dame of
all the conniving, scheming vixens who have ever graced the
soaps,'' says columnist and self-proclaimed soap-opera aficionado
Molly Ivins.
   Ivins, who writes for the Dallas Times Herald and Ms. magazine,
also declared in the Aug. 6 issue of TV Guide that Robert Scorpio,
played by Tristan Rogers, of ABC's ``General Hospital,'' and Roman
Brady, played by Drake Hogestyn, of NBC's ``Days of Our Lives,''
were the leading contenders as the sexiest men on the soaps.
   She praised CBS's ``The Young and the Restless'' as the sexiest,
funniest and one of the technically best-produced daytime soaps.

   The life of the three Soong sisters, including
Madame Chiang Kai-shek, will be the subject of a 12-part television
series filmed in the United States, Hong Kong and China, a news
report said Tuesday.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said the series, to be broadcast
in October 1989, would cost about $525,000.
   The three Soong sisters, Chingling, Meiling and Ailing, were the
famous daughters of Charlie Soong, who stowed away on a boat to the
United States, then returned to China and made a fortune printing
bibles.
   Soong Meiling, now 90, married Kuomintang leader Chiang Kai-shek
in 1927.

   Billy Bob Barnett, former owner of a
landmark nightclub and honky-tonk, has filed for bankruptcy,
blaming a faltering economy and his own Texas-sized plans to
develop the Fort Worth Stockyards.
   Barnett, former owner of Billy Bob's Texas, and his wife,
Patricia, filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition Monday. If granted,
Barnett would be allowed to keep his lakeside homes, automobiles
and up to $30,000 in personal property.
   The petition listed more than 1,200 creditors but didn't state
Barnett's total indebtedness.
   Billy Bob's Texas opened in 1981 and became one of the city's
top tourism draws. It closed last January.

   An arbitrator has refused to award damages to
a woman who charged that celebrity divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson
raped her, Mitchelson's lawyer said. The woman had sought $6.5
million.
   Bernard Selber, a retired Superior Court judge who sat as an
arbitrator in the case, refused to award damages to Patricia French
after a one-day hearing, Mitchelson's attorney, Harold Rhoden, said
Monday.
   The 1983 Superior Court lawsuit alleged that Mitchelson raped
Mrs. French three times at his office in 1981 and also failed to
return a $5,000 fee.
   Mrs. French never told police of the incident, and the district
attorney declined to prosecute when she contacted the office years
later, Rhoden said.
   Calls to Mrs. French's attorney were not returned.
   Another lawsuit filed by Kristan Barrett-Whitney, who also
accused Mitchelson of rape, is pending. The two women's allegations
were the subject of a recent ``60 Minutes'' program.
   Mitchelson has represented such clients as actress Joan Collins;
he was the lawyer in a landmark ``palimony'' case brought by the
live-in girlfriend of the late actor Lee Marvin.
