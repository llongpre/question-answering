   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge stalled in July, indicating to analysts that the nation might
have been limping toward recession even before the Middle East
crisis.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday its Index of Leading
Economic Indicators was unchanged after posting a barely
perceptible 0.1 percent gain in June. The index is designed to
forecast economic conditions six months to nine months in the
future.

   OPEC ministers have endorsed higher crude
production to make up most _ but not all _ of the shortfall caused
by the boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
   The accord, finalized Wednesday, temporarily suspends the
cartel's quota system to permit higher output by nations with spare
capacity. The Iraqi embargo creates a shortfall of about 4 million
barrels per day, and sources estimated the higher OPEC production
can be about 3 million barrels per day.

   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. issued a
ruling effectively barring state-chartered savings and loan
associations from withdrawing from the Federal Home Loan Bank
System for at least 18 months.
   The action Wednesday eases concerns the FDIC might be on the
verge of allowing a giant exodus of S&amp;Ls from the system. That
would cripple the system's ability to finance the savings and loan
bailout.

   New homes sales in July fell for the fifth
time in seven months, the government reported, and industry
observers said rising mortgage rates linked to the Mideast crisis
will compound the decline.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that new home sales
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual 548,000 units, down from
561,000 units in June and 741,000 in July 1989. The department
offered evidence of even more sluggishness earlier, revising
downward the sales totals in both May and June.

   A Los Angeles inventor said he has received
a patent for a single-chip computer he invented in 1968, a decision
that may cause trouble for computer companies that use similar
technology.
   Gilbert Hyatt, an inventor and consultant, said Wednesday he
battled with the U.S. Patent Office for 20 years before he was
granted the patent last month. The patent may apply to all
microprocessor chips and the millions of personal computers and
other products based on them, experts say.

   A judge threw out a civil racketeering lawsuit
that claimed Leona Helmsley illegally took millions of dollars from
her ailing real estate tycoon husband.
   The complaint in Manhattan's federal court was filed last
September by a former Helmsley company executive, William R.
Miller, who said Mrs. Helmsley's actions had reduced the size of
his commissions. A federal judge ruled Wednesday that the suit had
no basis under civil racketeering law.

   Murdoch Magazines has indefinitely suspended
plans to launch a commercially sponsored video service for beauty
parlors because of the weak advertising market, an executive said.
   Murdoch Magazines had said the Salon Network would feature a
half-hour program running on television sets in at least 3,000
beauty parlors this summer.
   The decision to put the project on hold, reported Wednesday,
represents the most prominent setback in a scramble to create new
media through which advertisers can reach narrowly targeted
audiences.
