   Robert Noyce, who revolutionized electronics
by co-inventing the semiconductor and later sought to revive
American chip-making as head of the government-industry consortium
Sematech, died Sunday of a heart attack. He was 62.
   Noyce suffered a heart attack at his Austin home Sunday morning
and was pronounced dead minutes after his arrival at Seton Medical
Center, hospital spokeswoman Elizabeth McDonald said.
   Working separately in the late 1950s, Noyce and Jack Kilby
invented the integrated circuit, which made rapid gains in computer
power possible by putting multiple transistors on a single chip.
   The Silicon Valley pioneer also was one of the founders of Intel
Corp., the nation's third-largest semiconductor producer, and fought
for the creation of a consortium to promote the American industry.
   ``He was really a legend within the electronics industry,''
spokesman Jim Jarrett said from Intel's Santa Clara, Calif.
headquarters.
   ``He was always referred to as the mayor of Silicon Valley
because he was such a respected and loved figure in the industry.''
   ``Bob was an instrumental figure in creating what has become a
$50 billion industry and semiconductors are the driving force behind
a $500 billion electronics industry,'' said Stan Victor, a spokesman
for Texas Instruments Inc. ``He will be missed.''
   In 1988, Noyce was appointed as the first chief executive officer
and president of Sematech, which was set up to help the United
States recover world leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.
   That leadership was essential to the nation's economic and
military security, he said, and American companies would have to
adopt the cooperative practices of their Japanese competitors to
regain it.
   After first taking himself out of the running for the job, Noyce
said he accepted the post because ``it finally dawned on me it was
far too important for someone else to do. I had to do it myself.''
   The Austin-based consortium, which includes Intel, Texas
Instruments and 12 other U.S. chip makers, has an annual budget of
$200 million provided by the government and manufacturers.
   Sematech spokesman Joe Stroop said the consortium's management
was deep enough to withstand Noyce's death.
   Noyce had asked Sematech's directors last April to begin a search
for his eventual successor, Stroop said. Noyce did not said when he
wanted to step down but ``had indicated he was willing to relinquish
daily operational control,'' he said.
   Noyce had established a three-member management team consisting
of himself, chief operating officer Turner E. Hasty and chief
administrative officer Peter H. Mills, Stroop said.
   ``The office of chief executive will continue to function while
we search for a successor,'' he said.
   ``There's a very solid infrastructure there and it should
continue on with no problem,'' Intel's Jarrett said of the
consortium.
   In addition to his Sematech duties, Noyce had retained his title
as Intel's vice chairman and was an active member of the board of
directors, Jarrett said.
   Noyce was born Dec. 12, 1927, in Burlington, Iowa. He was
graduated from Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, with bachelor's
degrees in physics and mathematics and membership in Phi Beta Kappa.
Noyce earned his Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in 1953.
   He became a researcher at Philco Corp., then later moved to the
Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. He co-founded Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp. in 1957, where he and Kilby of Texas Instruments
separately invented the integrated circuit.
   In 1968, Noyce and longtime associate Gordon E. Moore founded
Intel Corp.
   Noyce was awarded the National Medal of Technology by President
Reagan in 1987 and the National Medal of Science from President
Carter in 1980. He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of
Fame in 1983 and elected to the U.S. Business Hall of Fame last year.
   In February, Noyce and Kilby were presented the first Charles
Stark Draper Award by President Bush.
   ``Integrated circuits have enabled us to do the unimaginable,''
Bush said at the awards ceremony. ``Now, it is unimaginable to
believe we could ever live without them. The microchip ... helped
America change the world.''
   Noyce held 16 patents for semiconductor devices, methods and
structures. He was a founding member and first president of the
Semiconductor Industry Association.
   He also was a member of the National Academy of Science, National
Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Science.
   Noyce is survived by his wife, Ann Bowers; four children and 12
grandchildren. Funeral arrangements were pending, according to
Darryl Thompson of Weed-Corley Funeral Home.
