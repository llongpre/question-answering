   A study released today challenges the notion
that America will be able to replace millions of jobs lost in
fading smokestack industries with new jobs in emerging
high-technology fields.
   The Council on Competitiveness said the United States has lost
its once-commanding lead in many high-tech industries. It said that
only a concerted effort by government, industry and the nation's
schools can reverse the trend.
   ``In field after field, from combustion engineering to consumer
electronics, from machine tools to the integrated circuit, foreign
competitors have moved into markets pioneered and once dominated by
American firms,'' the report said. ``Often, their success was built
on exploiting inventions made in American laboratories by American
scientists.''
   The report said other countries such as Japan have done a much
better job of bringing new technology to the marketplace quickly.
   Unless this trend is reversed, the study warned, the United
States will suffer further deterioration in its trade deficits and
a declining standard of living.
   ``Technology is essential to America's competitiveness, the
driving force behind increased productivity, export growth and a
rising standard of living,'' said John Young, chairman of the
council and president of Hewlett-Packard Co..
   In releasing the report, Young said he wanted to challenge the
comforting illusion that ``the sunrise industries of high
technology are the wave of the future _ the economic panacea we all
need.''
   ``In 1987, our trade deficit with Japan in electronics was
almost as large as it was for automobiles. So Silicon Valley is not
so far removed from Detroit,'' he said.
   The report cited these developments:
   _American companies' share of the U.S. domestic market has
shrunk dramatically in many high-technology fields. Between 1970
and 1987, U.S. manufacturing companies' share of the American
market in phonographs fell from 90 percent to 1 percent, in color
televisions from 90 percent to 10 percent, in machine tools from
100 percent to 35 percent and in telephones from 99 percent to 25
percent.
   _America's trade surplus in high-technology products has
declined precipitously during the 1980s and was actually in deficit
for the first time in 1986.
   _Foreign inventors captured 47 percent of U.S. patents in 1987,
up from 35 percent in 1975 with Japanese inventors holding key
patents in an increasing number of fields.
   _By 1986, Japan had captured 65 percent of the world market in
computer chips. The United States had less than 30 percent.
   _America could face a shortfall of 500,000 scientists and
engineers by the year 2010, due to retirements and a declining
number of students choosing careers in science and engineering.
   Bobby Inman, a member of the council and the chairman of
Westmark Systems Inc., said that in global competition, the key to
success in developing new technology for the marketplace is speed
and teamwork.
   ``We've been too slow, too fragmented, too uncoordinated and too
adversarial,'' he said.
   The report said U.S. companies face an uphill struggle in global
markets unless the federal government improves the machinery for
making national technology policy.
   The report called on the next president to give his national
science adviser Cabinet rank with the power to coordinate all
government policies relating to research and development.
   The federal government operates more than 700 research
laboratories with an annual budget of $20 billion, close to
one-third of the government's annual spending for research and
development.
   But the report said there is no consensus on the projects these
labs should be pursuing and coordination is so lax that it is
difficult to determine just how many labs there are or what
projects they are pursuing.
   The report said investment in education, equipment and
facilities should be made a top federal priority. It estimated that
$10 billion would be needed over the next 10 years to restore U.S.
university research facilities.
   The government also should promote faculty development programs
as a way of filling an estimated 1,300 to 1,800 vacant engineering
positions at U.S. universities, the council said.
   The council also called for tax credits to companies for
research and development, regulatory reform to speed the commercial
application of new technology and reduction of the federal budget
deficit as a way of lowering the cost of capital to U.S. businesses.
   ``The primary challenge for policy makers is to create a new
policy framework appropriate for today's competitive environment,''
Young said. ``We can no longer afford to view the commercial
application of technology as a second-rate priority.''
   The council, founded in 1986, is composed of 151 chief
executives from industry, organized labor and higher education. It
has issued a series of reports aimed at improving the ability of
American companies to compete in world markets.
