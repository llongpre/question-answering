   Interlink Electronics, a young company with
a high-tech sense of touch, has its fingers in everything from
aerospace to computers, music and sports.
   Interlink's biggest problem, in fact, might be developing all
the potential uses of its patented ``force sensing resistors,''
which translate touch into electronic signals.
   ``One of the things that's a plague to us as a small company is
the sensors fit in so many markets that people don't know what to
make of us,'' said Kathryn Stewart, vice president of sales and
marketing of the 5-year-old, Santa Barbara-based company.
   Nicknamed ``the electronic gas pedal,'' a force sensing resistor
is a tactile sensor that responds with variable resistance. The
harder this thick polymer film is pressed, the more its resistance
drops.
   Interlink on Friday introduced its first high-volume consumer
product, an electronic keyboard foot-pedal that is part of the
``Miracle Piano Teaching System.'' The system combines a cartridge
for the Nintendo Entertainment System with a keyboard and home
television to create game-like video piano lessons.
   That modest step into consumer electronics is only a hint of
Interlink's future. The privately held company also is targetting
aerospace, where its sensors are used to determine whether the
various layers of airplane composite materials are being joined
evenly.
   Among the aerospace companies experimenting with the devices are
Boeing Co., Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   That business represents about one-fifth of Interlink's expected
$2.7 million in sales this year, said President E. Michael Thoben
III.
   Three other key markets for Interlink are computer input
devices, such as a stationary mouse for Apple Computer Inc.'s
MacIntosh Portable, sensing components on electronic drums and
musical keyboards, and rugged keypads for automatic teller machines.
   Thoben told the company's shareholders at an annual meeting
Thursday that Interlink will concentrate on those four markets to
build up revenue over the next few years.
   ``We're in transition from a research and development concern to
one driven by the market,'' said Thoben.
   Interlink also makes a touch interpreting sensor for a robot, a
device that fits under the grip of a golf club to analyze a
player's swing, footplates for medical analysis of podiatry
problems, and bed or wheelchair position monitors.
   But even that array of products just hints at the applications
that have been pursued by Interlink, which is backed by the funding
of Grace Ventures Corp., a unit of W.R. Grace &amp; Co.
   Imagine an electronic tennis referee so accurate it could shut
up John McEnroe. Interlink began work on a system proposed by a
customer, which got good reviews from the U.S. Tennis Association.
But the project is on hold until the customer can raise enough
money to fund further research.
   The biomedical industry is interested in Interlink sensors to
provide feedback for dispensing diagnostic and rehabilitative
functions. The sensors also can be applied to the automotive
industry in window, mirror and audio controls, as well as tire,
brake and fuel level sensors.
   The company, which has only 50 U.S. employees, grew out of an
idea developed by inventor Franklin Eventoff in the 1970s. Eventoff
was trying to make a musical toy for his daughter when he created a
way to generate an electronic response when varying degrees of
pressure were applied to a sensor.
   Eventoff patented the invention and formed a company, then sold
off most of the company. He remains a major shareholder.
   Interlink has refined and improved the sensors and now holds 33
patents in 10 countries.
