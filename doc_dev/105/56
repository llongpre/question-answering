HE CLAIMS HE'S THE BRAINS BEHIND BRAINS

Gilbert Hyatt is a slender, bearded engineer who says he would never shoot the 
guns that are mounted over the fireplace in his modest, two-story home on a 
quiet La Palma cul de sac. 
</P>
<P>
But he is not afraid to take steady aim when necessary to get what is 
rightfully his. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little guy up against the big guys," Hyatt, 52, said in an interview 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
And this David landed a Goliath of a blow when it was revealed Tuesday that he 
had been awarded a U.S. patent in July for inventing the technology to create 
the microprocessor, or computer on a chip. Hyatt had sought the patent for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The news could turn the computer industry topsy-turvy and make Hyatt wealthy if 
he is able to collect millions of dollars in royalties from the world's 
computer chip makers. It could also earn him a spot as an inventor whose 
innovation changed the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I am happy that my invention was used to advance technology in so many ways," 
he said, bearing a permanent blush from the recent media attention. "But it was 
frustrating without the recognition. This patent has settled everything in my 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
But the dispute is still far from being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
The invention of the microprocessor, which has made possible most consumer 
electronic products including pocket calculators and personal computers, is 
frequently credited to a team of Intel Corp. engineers that included Ted Hoff, 
Federico Faggin and Stan Mazor. 
</P>
<P>
They began working on the idea to help a Japanese calculator company in 1969, 
although Intel's chip was not shipped until 1971. Texas Instruments also 
entered the market in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But Hyatt, who has a stubborn streak that has been honed by two decades of 
legal battles and skepticism, says he is prepared to defend his claims against 
pretenders and deep-pocket companies that have until now been credited with the 
microprocessor's development. 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt said he makes a living as an aerospace consultant and hasn't worked for a 
big company for 25 years because he fears the environment would "stifle 
creativity." 
</P>
<P>
When he worked to develop the microprocessor, it was for a company that he 
founded and ran himself. Micro Computer Inc., the start-up company, was funded 
by Hambrecht &amp; Quist, a venture capital firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
It grew to 25 employees between 1968 and 1971, but Hyatt said it folded in the 
midst of a dispute over rights to the technology. To his chagrin, rivals Intel 
and Texas Instruments received patents in the 1970s and developed millions of 
applications for microprocessors. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, Hyatt could be faulted for being stubborn in refusing to share his 
patent rights, said Stuart Lubitz, a Los Angeles patent attorney who 
represented Micro Computer until it folded in 1971. Lubitz said Micro Computer 
fell apart because Hyatt resisted imparting the rights to his inventions. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't put Hyatt in the same boat with (chip pioneer Robert) Noyce or Jack 
Kilby," the Texas Instruments engineer who co-invented the integrated circuit 
and the hand-held calculator. "They were far more successful at advancing the 
state of the art and were not as obsessed with paper rights." 
</P>
<P>
Hyatt acknowledged some stubbornness in his style, but he said he fought hard 
to have his patent approved because he believed that it was far more important 
than other inventions. 
</P>
<P>
During the late 1970s, he continued to innovate but nearly soured on the 
inventing business after he was sued by Mattel Inc. for two electronics-related 
patents. He lost the suit to have his patents enforced, but a law firm in 
Washington saved him by picking up his legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
The soft-spoken but spunky engineer has collected a patent for every year of 
his life. Much of his work in recent years has involved liquid crystal display 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
"Some inventors just invent, but I try to be broad in my areas of interest," he 
said. "I consider myself a scientist, an engineer and in some ways an 
entrepreneur."
