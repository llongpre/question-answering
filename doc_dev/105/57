<LEADPARA>  Zenith Electronics Corp. on Wednesday reported a $23.7 million loss for the
first quarter, which it blamed on the depressed economy and systemwide
inventory reductions.;    The loss amounted to 85 cents a share, vs. a loss of
$4 million, or 56 cents a share, in the same 1990 period.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ZENITH'S LOSS WIDENS; WANG CUTS RED INK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The company, based in Glenview, Ill., had net sales of $304 million, down 1
percent from $306 million in 1990. It said sales in all product segments were
hurt by the slow economy.;    Zenith officials said inventory reductions,
lower selling prices and increased investments in high-definition television
systems also contributed significantly to the first-quarter loss for the only
U.S. television maker.;    Meanwhile, Zenith's largest shareholder, Nycor
Inc., says it hasn't given up on trying to gain control of the television
maker after apparently losing a proxy contest.;    And while it considers its
options, Nycor will use the clout of its nearly 8 percent stake to press for
further cost-cutting at Zenith, Nycor Chief Executive Sal Giordano Jr. said
Wednesday after Zenith's annual shareholders meeting.;    WANG LABORATORIES:
In a report that shows it has not reached the bottom of a painful decline,
Wang Laboratories Inc. said Wednesday it lost $48.9 million in the three
months ended March 31, on sales that fell 16 percent.;    The deficit, equal
to 30 cents a share, compares with a loss in the year-ago period of $146.6
million, or 90 cents a share. Last year's quarter included a loss from
discontinued operations of $56.9 million, or 35 cents a share.;    The sharp
decline in fiscal third-quarter sales, to $499.7 million from $593.5 million
in the year-ago period, raises the chances that the Lowell, Mass., computer
maker will resort to more layoffs to stop the flow of red ink, industry
analysts said.  </TEXT>
