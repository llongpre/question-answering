   Nathaniel Wyeth, the brother of
artist Andrew Wyeth and the inventor of the plastic soda bottle,
died at his home in this coastal community. He was 78.
   Wyeth, who lived in the village of Tenants Harbor in Saint
George, was pronounced dead at the Penobscot Bay Medical Center in
Glen Cove on Wednesday night, hospital spokesman Russell Donahue
said Friday.
   While other members of the family achieved greater fame with
their art work _ his late father, N.C. Wyeth, was also a well-known
artist-illustrator _ Wyeth achieved distinction in science during a
40-year career with the Du Pont Co.
   Wyeth was best known for developing the polyethylene
terephthalate, or PET, bottle, which he invented in the early
1970s. The bottle is used for carbonated beverages, wine, liquor
and food because of its light weight and impact resistance. It was
patented in 1973, and more than 6 million of the containers are
produced annually around the world.
   He began his career at Du Pont in 1936 in the company's
engineering department and held numerous other positions before
being named the company's first engineering fellow in 1963. In
1975, he was named the first senior engineering fellow, the
company's highest technical position.
   Wyeth invented 25 processes and products that spanned a wide
range, including plastics, textile fibers, electronics and
mechanical systems.
   Throughout his career, Wyeth worked closely with mechanical
engineering students engaged in research. After retirement, he
continued to lecture on creativity in engineering and served as a
consultant to Du Pont and universities.
   He received many awards, including the 1981 Society of Plastics
Engineers International Award for Outstanding Achievement for the
development of the PET bottle. The Rose-Hulman Institute of
Technology in Terre Haute, Ind., awarded him an honorary doctorate
of engineering in 1982. He was elected to the Plastics Hall of Fame
by the Society for Plastics Industry in 1986.
   Wyeth also was an accomplished craftsman known for creating
unusual and detailed furniture miniatures.
   He held a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and a
master's degree from the University of Pennsylvania.
   Wyeth is survived by his wife, Jean, five sons, his brother,
three sisters, three stepsons and a stepdaughter.
