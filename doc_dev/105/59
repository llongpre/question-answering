   Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd.
has named an American as second-in-command of its U.S. operations,
but observers say it may be years before big Japanese companies put
an American in their top U.S. post.
   Richard A. Kraft, 60, was named Tuesday as president and chief
operating officer of Matsushita Electric Corporation of America, the
U.S. arm of the world's biggest consumer electronics company.
   Kraft is a 15-year veteran of the company, which sells products
under the Panasonic, Technics and Quasar brand names. He has served
as president of Matsushita Industrial Co. of Franklin Park, Ill.,
Matsushita's U.S. manufacturing division, since 1979.
   Kraft will run day-to-day operations under Akiya Imura, 54, who
will continue as chief executive of the U.S. company, based in
Secaucus, N.J., and assume the new title of chairman. The changes
take effect April 1.
   American companies are much more likely than Japanese companies
to give their top jobs overseas to foreign nationals. For example,
International Business Machines Corp. spokesman Peter Thonis said
IBM does business in 130 foreign countries and has Americans in
charge at fewer than five of them.
   In contrast, the chairman of Sony Corp. of America is Masaaki
Morita, younger brother of Sony co-founder Akio Morita. The U.S.
operations of Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi Ltd. and the biggest Japanese
banks and brokerage houses all are headed by Japanese as well.
   ``When push comes to shove, Japanese and Americans are not on the
same (promotion) track,'' said Richard Ozaroff, an analyst who
follows Japanese companies. ``For all the claims that they are
multinational companies that just happen to be based in Japan, I
don't buy it.''
   Matsushita has been striving to achieve a reputation as a good
corporate citizen in the United States by promoting Americans and
building U.S. factories.
   The company's image suffered a setback in January when its
Panasonic Co. unit agreed to pay consumers $16 million to avoid New
York state charges that it fixed retail prices on electronics
products.
   While the company maintains its innocence, some analysts said the
unfavorable publicity may have added urgency to promoting an
American to a top job as an image-building move.
   Matsushita has more than 7,000 employees in the United States,
scattered from Hawaii to California, Illinois, Washington, Tennessee
and New Jersey. It sells televisions, videocassette recorders,
microwave ovens and other products. It also sells business and
industrial equipment.
   Kraft said that as an American he could be more effective than
his predecessors in dealing with American employees, government
bodies and communities where Matsushita has operations.
   ``The American public today seems to be ambivalent about foreign
companies in the United States,'' Kraft said. By building
Matsushita's reputation, he said, ``We can ultimately overcome any
possible friction and be welcome in this country.''
   Matsushita, which had $38.5 billion in sales last year, has 102
companies in 37 countries outside Japan. Thirty of the companies in
14 countries already were headed by non-Japanese, and Imura said
picking an American to be president of the U.S. operations had been
a high priority for him in his two-year stint as president.
   Kraft said he understands the Japanese attitude of caution about
promoting an American to the top job.
   ``I think it's only natural that the company would be
conservative about turning over that kind of power until they had
developed the confidence in the person enough to be comfortable,''
he said.
   Could Kraft ever get the top job in Matsushita's U.S. company?
``This is America. Anything is possible. It certainly could happen.
I would just be overjoyed if I could develop that kind of
confidence,'' he said. ``Whether it will happen in my lifetime or
not, I don't know.''
   Kraft, a Chicago native, holds 13 U.S. patents as inventor or
co-inventor of electronics related to television.
