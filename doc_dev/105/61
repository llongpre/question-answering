   SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge will decide May 10 if the
inventor of the waterbed will receive triple damages from a
firm that infringed his patent.
   A federal jury last week awarded waterbed inventor Charles
Hall $4.8 million in damages for infringement of his 1971
patent by Intex Plastic Sales Co., Long Beach, Calif.

   Under patent infringement law, the amount could be tripled
to $14.4 million by U.S. District Judge John Vukasin in a May
10 hearing. Mr. Hall also will receive about $2.9 million in
pre-judgment interest.
   Richard Cannon, attorney for Mr. Hall, said the awards
could be just the first of many payments. There are more than
200 companies involved in making and selling waterbeds, which
has grown to a $2 billion industry. He said many of those
companies will be contacted to resolve "potential liabilities
for licensing fees."
   The jury ruled March 13 that Mr. Hall had a valid patent
for the invention of the waterbed, and that the patent had
been infringed by Intex, which is affiliated with Intex
Taipei of Taiwan. The award was based on Intex's $50.6
million in sales dating from 1982, when Intex began
infringing the patents for waterbed mattresses and heaters.
   Mr. Hall created the waterbed in 1968 as part of a
master's degree project. He received a patent in 1971. It
expired in 1988, but he is still entitled to collect from
companies that used his patent without a license during that
period.
