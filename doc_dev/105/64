<LEADPARA>  After 20 years of seeing others reap big bucks off his brainchild, inventor
Charlie Hall has ridden his waterbed to a $6.45 million lawsuit award in a
patent victory that's sending shock waves through the flotation sleep
industry.;    "It's a good day for inventors," the 48-year-old Santa Rosa
inventor said Tuesday after hearing that San Francisco Federal Judge John
Bukasin had affirmed the civil award. A jury decided in March that Intex
Plastics, a Long Beach waterbed maker, had violated Hall's 1971 patent on a
device providing "liquid support for human bodies."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The judge set an 8.62 percent royalty and tacked on interest, which placed
Intex's penalty at $6.45 million.;    "After all these years, I'm finally
being recognized for the contribution I made to starting this industry. That's
a great gratification for me," said Hall, who launched the modern waterbed in
the kitchen of his Haight-Ashbury apartment as a graduate school design
project in 1968.;    "I would hope that people would now have a great deal
more respect for patents.";    Intex Plastics plans to appeal, said attorney
Francis Utecht.;    But if the award stands, Utecht acknowledged it could
force other members of the $2 billion waterbed industry to "either settle or
be sued" by Hall.;    Michael Deese, a lawyer for the Waterbed Manufacturers
Association and the National Waterbed Retailers Association, reluctantly
agreed.;    "You're talking a lot of money," he said.;    Because Hall's
patent expired three years ago and because of other time limitations on his
claim, he can only seek patent royalties on waterbeds and heaters sold from
1985 to 1988.;    Hall's attorney, Jack Slobodin, said the victory validates
the creative genius of his client, who always took exception to snickering
portrayals of his invention as a plastic pleasure pond. Waterbeds now account
for one of every five U.S. beds sold.;    "He didn't see it as some sex toy,"
the attorney said. "He wanted to create an alternative to an inner-spring
mattress."  </TEXT>
