   Shenanigans of television evangelists such
as Jimmy Swaggart and Jim Bakker have spawned another player in
America's multimillion-dollar board game industry, named ``Fleece
the Flock.''
   The game, scheduled to be in stores next month, is marketed by
Regent Continental, a Philadelphia-based company that produces board
games for some of the nation's largest toy makers, including
``Monopoly,'' ``Clue,'' and ``Sorry'' for Parker Brothers.
   ``I came up with the idea when Jimmy Swaggart was caught in the
motel,'' said Elizabeth Fuller, author of ``My Search for the Ghost
of Flight 401'' and other books. ``I thought, `These guys belong on
a board game.'''
   ``Fleece the Flock'' is based loosely on ``Monopoly,'' but
instead of real-estate tycoons, players assume the roles of greedy
evangelists.
   Armed with collection plates, players toss dice and seek
ownership of theme parks, television stations and record companies
while trying to bankrupt their unholy competitors and keep their own
sexual escapades secret.
   Fuller, who lives in Weston, Conn. collaborated on the game with
inventor Stanley Mason of Weston, whose 30 patents include Masonware
microwave cookware, and Roy Doty of Norwalk, Conn., a humor
illustrator whose work has appeared in Newsweek, Fortune and Popular
Science magazines.
   The three formed Tongue-in-Cheek Productions for this venture and
sold the rights to market the game to Regent.
   The company plans to have a pilot run of 10,000 games, selling at
$25 retail, available by April 1, said Cindy Levinson, the Regent
account executive who is marketing ``Fleece the Flock.''
   The company will focus its sales campaign on the Northeast at
first, but hopes to convince nationwide chains to carry the game,
she said.
   ``Fleece the Flock'' is only the latest board game to capitalize
on people in the news. Milton Bradley, maker of the some of the
country's most popular games, last month unveiled ``Trump The
Game,'' based on the wheeling and dealing of billionaire real estate
mogul Donald Trump.
   Analysts say any new entry into the $760 million-a-year
board-game industry faces an uphill battle.
   ``More than half the new toys introduced in any given year do not
make it past that year's Christmas,'' said David S. Leibowitz, a toy
industry analyst with American Securities Corp. in New York. ``The
success of any new toy item is pretty tough.
   ``Board games tend to have a more difficult time than many other
products because there is a set of rules to be mastered, and the
competition is far keener because many people believe they can in
fact create a board game.''
   Board games face additional difficulties of requiring more than
one person and a considerable block of time to play, he said.
   But Fuller and her collaborators say they are confident that
Americans' seemingly endless fascination with the foibles of
television evangelists will create a niche for their game.
   ``The No. 1 one thing the American public is interested in right
now are TV evangelists gone astray _ not movie stars, not rock
stars,'' Fuller said.
   The three spent five months testing the game on groups of
volunteer players, who were observed at Mason's product development
laboratory in Weston.
   They went through nine versions of the board and even more
changes in the rules, which come in the form of the Ten
Commandments, before settling on the final version.
   The inventors were dumbfounded to discover one common trait among
the test players: They all were cheating by the end of the game. The
phenomenon prompted the inclusion of one rule that is assumed in
most games: ``Thou shalt not cheat (unless thou canst get away with
it).''
   No real-life evangelist is named in the game and the inventors
insist they are not attacking religion itself. Fuller is a
Unitarian; Doty and Mason are Methodists.
   ``It's a comment on humanity,'' Mason said. ``It's aimed at the
human foibles we have, when we'll suppport people like this when we
know...they are evil.''
