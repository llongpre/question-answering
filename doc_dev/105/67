<LEADPARA>  Andrew S. Rappaport and Shmuel Halevi's underlying thesis is one that we have
heard many times in many different guises for more than two decades: U.S.
companies should abandon highly competitive manufacturing businesses for more
specialized niche markets that have higher profit margins. And since the
United States is uniquely innovative and entrepreneurial, other countries will
not be able to challenge us in these new markets as easily as they can in
manufactured goods.;   While this strategy may work for some companies, it is
a dangerous recipe for an industry, let alone an entire country. Their
argument is based on two questionable assumptions. First, they believe that
U.S. computer companies are guaranteed an adequate supply of hardware. The
computer companies caught in the DRAM shortage of the late 1980s would surely
disagree. It is risky to assume that manufacturing (read "Japanese") companies
will provide all of the hardware that U.S. computer companies need and stand
idly by while their competitors rack up high profits.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  "The Computerless Computer Company," from the July-August Harvard Business
Review, has generated heated discussion in Silicon Valley. (Story, Page 1A.)

<TEXT>     On the contrary, if anything, the market axiom of the late 20th century
appears to be that the company that masters the manufacture of a product will
eventually invent the next generation of that product -- or if not actually
invent it, make incremental improvements, obtain novel technology and profit
handsomely from new market applications. The Japanese consumer electronics
industry has successfully moved into the software business by dominating
electronics hardware. And Michael Jackson works for Sony.; Andrew S. Grove,;
Intel Corp.,; Santa Clara; I am puzzled: Why is it that so many intelligent
people spend so much time laboring to put a good face on U.S. companies' loss
of leadership in manufacturing and technology?;   Leading-edge products cannot
be created and produced with generic manufacturing technologies. Just as you
cannot build Formula One racing cars with stock parts, you cannot develop
high-performance microprocessors with generic semiconductor technologies.;  
The companies that are beating U.S. manufacturers in producing the enabling
hardware for computers -- semiconductor memories, displays, lap-top computers
-- may well be on their way to owning those organizations that can produce the
computing utilities Rappaport and Halevi urge us to strive for.;   After all,
if MCA, CBS Records and Columbia Pictures can be bought today, what's to stop
Microsoft, Lotus and Wordperfect from being purchased tomorrow? Does this
sound like the "hollow victory" the authors make it out to be?; T. J.
Rodgers,; Cypress Semiconductor,; San Jose; Would the proposed fabless
semiconductor company be as unstoppable as the authors claim? Companies that
have no manufacturing capability or technology are as vulnerable to attack as
big companies are. All it takes is a garage shop with a few good engineers and
a few million dollars from one venture capitalist.;   I wish I could hear a
rerun of the ill-fated speech made by the RCA executive who advocated the
transfer of television technology to the Japanese so that RCA could "escape
the drudgery of manufacturing" to "focus" on the "value added" part of the
television business, presumably the marketing of innovative cabinetry.;
Richard Florida,; Carnegie Mellon University,; Pittsburgh; and Martin Kenney,;
University of California, Davis; Rappaport and Halevi's "software will save
us" argument is just the latest version of technology boosterism. We've heard
it before in semiconductors, computer hardware and other industries. And in
each case, a few entrepreneurs and venture capitalists strike it very rich,
while the United States finds itself falling behind and ultimately surpassed
by foreign competitors willing to do what it takes to build a long-term
stake.;   The authors neglect to mention that the U.S. software and hardware
industries grew up together in a symbiotic and mutually reinforcing way. Loss
of the ability to make cutting-edge hardware severs this connection.;  
Consider the semiconductor equipment industry. Semiconductor design software
companies in Silicon Valley are opening up branches in Japan because that is
where their largest market lies. It is not difficult to envision a scenario
where a large share of Silicon Valley's software and semiconductor design
infrastructure relocates to Tokyo.;   New product technology, whether hardware
or software, can be acquired through imitation or reverse engineering or by
simply buying the product, a license to make it or even the company. What is
much harder to replicate and even more crucial is the underlying process
technology required to make and constantly improve new generations of
products. This is where the United States is weakest and where Japan excels.; 
 With their narrow focus on knowledge-intensive products as the source of most
value, the authors neglect the fact that value comes in many kinds of
productive activity. The advanced display screens used in lap-tops not only
are important as computer screens but also promise to open up huge markets in
all types of display technology, from cockpit, automotive and home appliance
displays to large flat-panel screens for HDTV.; John A. Rollwagen,; Cray
Research,; Eagan, Minn.; The authors dismiss Intel's investment approach in
favor of Microsoft's. But it is hard to argue with Intel's success, in part
due to its manufacturing investments. The folks at Intel aren't fooling around
when they dedicate $1 billion to hardware R&amp;D in one year. Their efforts in
R&amp;D are aimed at creating new knowledge. But they also need a physical
platform to exploit that new knowledge. Intel stands as a notable exception
that weakens the authors' premise.; Mark D. Stahlman,; Alex, Brown &amp; Sons,;
New York; The claim that both innovative new hardware platforms and
sophisticated semiconductor fabrication facilities will be plentiful is not
supported by any of my firm's analyses of these industries. On the contrary,
the accelerating pace of technology requires market leaders to control
substantial manufacturing resources as well as to break new ground in hardware
design.;   Where did the authors go astray? They attempt to project trends 10
years hence from the events associated with the rapidly maturing personal
computer industry when PCs are but one of many economically distinct computer
industries and when the current phase for this industry will itself be only a
passing event. As demonstrated by the authors' difficulties in reconciling the
success of Sun Microsystems (anything but a computerless computer company)
with their thesis, the economics of the computer systems business are far from
uniform.; Robert Miller and Stuart Gannes,; Mips Computer Systems,; Sunnyvale;
The authors, entranced by the present profitability of downstream
applications, gloss over the long-term risks of the strategy they propose.
Computer companies that believe that intellectual property rights are more
defensible than manufacturing investments are seriously deluding themselves.; 
 In comparing the prospects of Toshiba and Grid Systems, for example, the
authors praise Grid's efforts in creating a niche for itself. Toshiba, by
contrast, is criticized for investing in the manufacturing of generic
flat-panel displays.;   In fact, Japanese hardware manufacturers like Toshiba
build lap-top displays for their own system-products division and for the
competition. Not only is Toshiba protected by the high barriers of entry to
the flat-panel display manufacturing business, but it also stands to benefit
from the growth of the entire lap-top market, no matter who reaches the end
user. Grid, by contrast, could easily lose key accounts to other resellers
that piece together the same solution.;   As Rappaport and Halevi admit,
companies that live by low entry barriers also die by them. You don't see
Japanese electronics manufacturers talking about computerless computer
companies.; Bruce Scott,; Harvard Business School,; Boston; The United States
imports more than $30 billion in autos and parts, for example, and only a
little less in electronic goods. But the United States exported only $2.4
billion in all proprietary rights in 1988, which includes patents as well as
software. There is no way the United States can pay for anything approaching
its current level of imports of manufactures -- $400 billion a year -- with
software, no matter how profitable it may be.;   If, as a nation, we were to
follow the authors' strategic advice, we would shift out of mass-production
manufactures and into high-value services. Our manufactured imports would
rise, and so would our trade deficit. We will be a dual economy with some
nifty software boutiques employing a few hundred thousand people at most,
coupled with real growth activities in recycling, natural resources and
low-level processing industries. It is a sure recipe for a few rich suburbs in
a progressively poorer country.; Laurence Boucher,; Auspex Systems,; Santa
Clara; RCA Corp. and General Electric Co. initially profited by offloading the
manufacturing of their audio equipment, but soon those manufacturing companies
were adding their own design talent to the process and developing their own
distribution channels. Ultimately, all components of this commodity business
traded hands, and I suspect that the profits generated by consumer electronics
would be welcome by any of the companies that abdicated their position in this
industry.; Ronald L. Skates,; Data General Corp.,; Westboro, Mass.; The
fabless semiconductor company and hardware-less computer company may be good
for their short-term stockholders, but they make a terrible national
industrial policy. Do we really want to pass a factory-less America on to our
children? Today, Hollywood produces the bulk of the software used in VCRs and
televisions, while all of the VCRs and televisions are made overseas. This may
be good for the relatively few people who produce major motion pictures, but
the average American worker would be better off listening to a foreign artist
on an American-made CD player.  </TEXT>
