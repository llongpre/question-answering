   Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc., a unit of Thomson S.A. of Paris, said it is developing a television tube that would provide a much wider picture than is currently available. 

   The new tube would have a width-to-height ratio of 16 to 9. 
Tubes currently in use have a 4-to-3 ratio. 

   Thomson, which sells consumer electronics products in the U.S. under the RCA and GE brands, said it has committed $75 million to expanding its plant in Marion, Ind., which would make the wide-screen tubes "when the market demands it," according to D. Joseph Donahue, Thomson's senior vice president, technology and business development. 

   General Electric Co. of Fairfield, Conn., sold its consumer electronics business to Thomson 18 months ago. 

   The new tubes are part of a joint effort toward an advanced compatible television system that Thomson is working on with GE's NBC TV network and the David Sarnoff Research Center in Princeton, N.J. 

   Mr. Donahue called wide-screen TV a necessary first step toward a U.S. high-definition TV system that will provide much sharper images.
