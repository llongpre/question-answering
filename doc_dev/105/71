   When the maker of RCA televisions unleashed a real-life
version of its trademark terrier in advertisements last fall,
it hoped to sic Nipper on the big discount retailers.
   A decade ago, lured by the temptation to increase sales,
RCA began selling to national retail chains like Kmart Corp.
and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. -- only to find its profits and
brand loyalty drained and its distributors and loyal dealers
going out of business. Now, a wounded RCA is biting back. And
Thomson S.A. of France, which bought the RCA
consumer-electronics business from General Electric Co. in
1987, is attacking not just with its old dog but with new
services for small dealers and a new line of high-end
products.

   Already, margins are up after leveling off two years ago.
"It's going to take some time, but it will keep us off the
street corner," says Martin J. Holleran, head of Thomson's
North American consumer-electronics sales company.
   After concluding that retailers force down prices and use
manufacturers' brand names to lure consumers into the store
only to switch them to cheaper, no-name brands, several
makers of consumer goods are trying to regain control over
their products' distribution. They have devised new programs
to protect small, loyal dealers and are taking new
precautions when selling to the large chains.
   "There's a battle going on here," says Jack McGrath, a
consultant with Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton. "Manufacturers are
putting up a fight to regain control."
   On the front line of the battle now is Goodyear Tire &amp;
Rubber Co., which has felt intense pressure to increase its
tire sales because of weak car markets and fierce
competition. The recent naming of Stanley C. Gault to succeed
resigning Chairman Tom H. Barrett has reopened a debate that
has surfaced continuously at the tire maker in recent months:
Should it find some new way to grow its failing dealer
network? Or should it give in and boost sales by offering its
tires to the national chains?
   So far, Goodyear has tried to uphold the integrity of its
name and protect its loyal dealers by selling to the big
chains only its lesser grade Kelly-Springfield line. To
increase brand loyalty and help its 6,000 small dealers,
Goodyear for the first time is using its famous blimps to
promote its Goodyear-brand tires by offering free rides to
customers in 11 cities. The tire maker also hopes to stay
ahead of the big chains with its technology: This summer it
will release a new fuel-efficient tire, an improved tire for
sports cars and a new high-traction tire.
   Even with these efforts, though, Goodyear was forced to
come out with its cheaper All-American Decathlon and Concorde
lines to give its dealers models to compete with the large
chains. And the big discounters have been able to obtain a
few Goodyear tires from Goodyear distributors who are
overstocked, allowing them to advertise Goodyear tires to
bait and switch consumers. This led Goodyear last November to
sue Tire America and Western Auto Supply, another Sears unit.
   While virtually all of Goodyear's rivals now sell their
brands to the national chains, Goodyear still clings to its
company-owned and exclusive independent dealers. But that
arrangement will be difficult to maintain. "The mass
merchandisers are eating up the distribution of our product,"
complains Ron Brutt, the owner of two Goodyear dealerships in
Pittsburgh who has seen his margins cut by a third in recent
years. "It could drive me out of the tire business."
   Goodyear might learn from RCA Consumer Electronics'
experience. In its heyday, it had nearly 70 exclusive
distributors and 25,000 small retailers that sold some 70% of
RCA televisions and returned a healthy profit to the
manufacturer. But when such chains as Kmart, Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and Circuit City Stores Inc. demanded to do business
directly with RCA, the manufacturer gambled it could overcome
the lower margins with higher sales.
   It couldn't. Big dealers demanded ever-lower prices and
refused to push RCA's new high-end products; RCA had no money
left for advertising of its own. Worse, the chains used the
bait-and-switch technique to lure consumers to similarly
priced no-name brands to enlarge their own margins.
   "We became subservient to the retailers," says Jack
Sauter, RCA's former marketing head. "They would say, `Just
build the product and give me the right price.'"
   But now, the Thomson unit hopes to regain brand loyalty
with Nipper and a doubled national advertising budget of $30
million. It is trying to regain the high-end, high-margin
business with its "home theater" notion -- a package of
large-screen televisions and VCRs. And it installed a 24-hour
800 number to improve service. RCA now seeks to protect small
dealers with a system that keeps the company in weekly
contact with each one.
   General Electric's appliance business is also trying to
strengthen its small dealers, which now contribute 35% of
sales, down from over 50% a decade ago. GE allows dealers to
link electronically to the company's production schedules and
lets them place direct orders with 48-hour delivery
guaranteed. Because General Electric controls both GE and
Hotpoint brands, even if salesmen switch customers from the
highend GE appliance, they may wind up selling them GE-made
Hotpoint.
   Challenging the big retailers head-on can still be
perilous. When Quaker State Corp. stopped offering special
deals to national chains in a bid to give its distributors a
"level playing field," some big chains dropped Quaker State's
motor oil. (Quaker State says some of those retailers are
coming back -- on its terms.)
   Retailers agree that manufacturers have sought a broader
role in distribution, seeking more information about the
chains' sales and offering rewards for promoting their
brands. Kmart has responded by offering manufacturers access
to sales data and is forming inventory and sales
"partnerships" with companies like Corning Inc. and Eastman
Kodak Co.
   Still, such relationships can be awkward. When Aluminum
Co. of America's Stolle aluminum siding unit decided to sell
to the big lumberyards last year, it rented out the
Pittsburgh convention center and called its small dealers
into town so Alcoa's chairman and president could reassure
them. Alcoa backed up its words by refusing to sell the big
chains the Alcoa brand name, instead selling them the cheaper
American Pride brand.
   Already, though, some of the lumberyards have cheated and
advertised Alcoa-brand siding; Alcoa assembled a team of
lawyers to fight the offending lumberyards and to investigate
bait-and-switch claims. "We're probably not making a lot of
money from the mass merchandisers, but so far our margins
are holding up at our old distributors," says Stolle
marketing manager Frank Hinchcliffe. If that should change,
he vows: "We'll get out."
