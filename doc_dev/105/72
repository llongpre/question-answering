   SAN FRANCISCO -- After a 20-year battle to protect his
patent for the invention of the waterbed, Charlie Hall may
finally get a chance to sleep more soundly.
   A six-member jury upheld Mr. Hall's 1971 patent, ruling
that Intex Plastics Sales Co., a Long Beach, Calif., waterbed
importer, infringed on it. The verdict could entitle Mr. Hall
to millions of dollars in back royalties from some of the 200
companies in the industry. Currently, the 47-year-old
inventor has licensing agreements with four waterbed makers.

   Over the years, the waterbed has gained wider acceptance,
growing into a $2 billion-a-year industry. It also has shed
its image as a "sex toy for hippies," Mr. Hall said.
   Mr. Hall built the prototype in 1968, while a graduate
student living in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district. He
has designed waterbeds for Hugh Hefner, the Smothers Brothers
and the rock group Jefferson Airplane.
   "It's a good day for small inventors; if you stick to your
guns, sometimes it works out," said Mr. Hall, who estimates
he spent as much as $1 million in legal fees defending the
patent. The jury will determine a damage award next week,
said Frances Utecht, Intex's attorney, who declined comment
until an award is made.
