   When a newspaper published a purported
inventory of the governor's mansion _ including 156 chairs, six
television sets and 26 sofas _ a miffed Gov. Rudy Perpich and his
wife, Lola, responded by proposing that the state sell off the
place. Besides, his office says, there are a mere 113 chairs and 15
sofas.
   In a huff at what she called criticism of her family's
lifestyle, Mrs. Perpich said Thursday that she and the governor
will ask the 1990 Legislature to sell the mansion and its contents
and donate the proceeds to help the homeless.
   Ray Bohn, Perpich's spokesman, said Friday the attorney
general's office was asked to determine if a sale of the 1910
mansion is possible. Perpich said Saturday he was still awaiting
that ruling.
   Key lawmakers say they would oppose such a sale. Even if they
were agreeable, the deed under which the mansion was donated to the
state in 1965 stipulates the mansion be demolished if not in public
use.
   Lynn Anderson, Perpich's chief of staff, says the Perpiches are
aware that the mansion could face destruction if the property is
sold.
   The dispute grew out of a story in Tuesday's St. Paul Pioneer
Press Dispatch that included an inventory of items in the mansion
and criticism from Senate Minority Leader Duane Benson about the
Perpiches ``lavish lifestyle.''
   Then, on Thursday, Mrs. Perpich accused the newspaper and Senate
Republicans of waging a campaign to ``vilify'' her family and said
she would ask the Minnesota Historical Society and the Minneapolis
Institute of Art to immediately remove all artwork and furniture on
loan to the mansion.
   On Friday, Perpich fueled his longstanding feud with the paper
over coverage of his family by releasing an inventory of
furnishings in the mansion.
   ``These figures differ dramatically from those published in your
newspaper report,'' Perpich said in a letter to the editor. Mrs.
Perpich also said the newspaper had ``greatly inflated'' the amount
of furniture in the residence.
   The article and an illustration indicated the mansion contained
156 chairs, 28 cabinets, 23 lamps, 83 artifacts, six television
sets, 26 sofas, 81 tables, 16 rugs and seven mirrors. The article,
quoting the Governor's Residence Council, put the furnishings'
value at $300,000.
   The inventory released Friday lists 113 chairs, six cabinets, 23
lamps, six television sets, 15 sofas, 59 tables, 12 rugs and six
mirrors. In storage are 42 chairs, 11 sofas, 22 tables, four rugs
and one mirror, many of them put aside because they are too worn
out to use, Perpich said in the letter. The list did not give an
estimate of worth.
   The renovation of the 20-room English Tudor mansion became a
serious project after Perpich's 1982 election. Although Mrs.
Perpich originally said she would prefer living in a townhouse, not
the mansion, she reconsidered under public pressure and began a
campaign to raise private funds for renovation.
   Some $1.3 million has been raised for the mansion in the past 10
years, most of it since Perpich took office.
   Sam Grabarski, chairman of the Governor's Residence Council,
said Friday that request to have artwork loaned to the mansion
taken out would have to be made by the 15-member council, of which
Mrs. Perpich is a voting member, but not the only voting member.
   ``The loan agreement is an agreement that is held between the
museums and the Governor's Residence Council itself, not the
governor's residence,'' he said.
   The first time the Perpiches moved into the mansion was in late
1976 after Perpich, then lieutenant governor, took over when
then-Gov. Wendell Anderson resigned to fill Walter Mondale's
vacancy in the U.S. Senate. The Perpiches moved out after he was
defeated in his first race for governor in 1978.
