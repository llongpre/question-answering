   A U.S. division of Dutch electronics giant
Philips NV said today it will join a joint venture of NBC-TV and
the American arm of France's largest electronics company to
research advanced television systems.
   Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc., the U.S. operation of Thomson
SA of France, and Philips Consumer Electronics Co. announced the
joint venture at a news conference at NBC headquarters.
   The venture eventually is intended to lead to a high-definition
television system, which would provide picture quality vastly
improved from today's best sets.
   ``We want U.S. consumers to have access to advanced TV services
as quickly as possible,'' said J. Peter Bingham, vice president of
technology for Philips Consumer Electronics.
   Philips, which makes the Magnavox, Sylvania and Philco brands,
has said it is working on an improved television system called
High-Definition System for North America.
   NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co., has been
cooperating with Thomson at the David Sarnoff Research Center in
Princeton, N.J., to develop advanced television systems.
   NBC and Thomson, which owns the former GE and RCA television
lines, are working on a system called Advanced Compatible TV, which
would provide an improved picture on TV sets being developed by
Thomson while allowing continued use of conventional sets.
   Advanced Compatible TV would require only minor, low-cost
adjustments to equipment at local TV stations, Thomson and NBC said.
   Last April, NBC and Thomson tested the system during a news show
on NBC's New York station, WNBC. The improved picture was viewed by
reporters and others on a special TV set at the non-profit Sarnoff
center. NBC said it was the first commercial broadcast of an
improved TV signal.
   But development of the true HDTV system would require a
reallocation of broadcasting signals by the Federal Communications
Commission because it would use two channels to broadcast both the
HDTV signal and a signal compatible with convention TV sets, said
James Tietjen, president of the Sarnoff Center.
   Several Japanese companies are working on HDTV systems of their
own. In addition, Zenith Electronics Corp., the last major U.S. TV
manufacturer, has joined with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to
develop an HDTV system.
   Like the NBC-Thomson system, Zenith's system would provide full
HDTV pictures while remaining compatible with conventional TV sets,
although these existing sets would not receive an improved picture,
said Zenith spokesman John Taylor.
   Thomson in 1987 traded its medical equipment business and cash
for the GE and RCA television lines plus the rest of General
Electric's consumer electronics businesses.
