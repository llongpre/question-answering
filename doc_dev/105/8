   Pioneering scientists George Washington Carver
and Percy F. Julian are the first blacks named to the National
Inventors Hall of Fame.
   They were among 10 people, including the founders of two of the
nation's largest computer companies and the developers of a leading
ulcer medicine, chosen for the honor.
   They ``are the real heroes of our age,'' Jeffrey M. Samuel,
acting commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, said about those
chosen Wednesday.
   ``They are the thinkers and the problem-solvers. They have
opened new doors and pioneered new frontiers in science and
technology.''
   Carver, once director of agriculture at Tuskegee Institute, was
selected for his work developing countless products from peanuts
and sweet potatoes. Julian, a Chicago chemist, was the first to
synthesize cortisone and other human hormones.
   ``He was one of the most persistent men I have known,'' Samuel
B. Massie of the U.S. Naval Academy said about Julian, a former
colleague.
   Tenacity was cited as a necessary ingredient by another man
being honored.
   Robert S. Ledley of Georgetown University said the prerequisite
skills for success include a pragmatic attitude, boldness,
fortitude ``and `stick-to-itiveness' almost to the extent of
obsession.''
   Ledley was named to the Hall of Fame for his development of the
CT scanner, a special X-ray device that allows doctors to see the
inner workings of the body in great detail.
   Honoree Herman Hollerith was described as having left behind a
motto for the generations: ``Do not fold, spindle or mutilate.''
   Hollerith invented the punch-card system that helped pave the
way to modern computers. A Census Bureau employee, he halved the
time it took to tabulate the 1890 national head count and later
went on to help found the giant International Business Machines
Corp.
   The second computer pioneer honored was Kenneth S. Olsen,
developer of the magnetic memory core for computers and founder of
Digital Equipment Corp.
   Graham C. Durant, John C. Emmett and C. Robin Gannellin were
selected jointly for their work in medical chemistry. The three
developed the drug cimetidine, which has greatly reduced the need
for surgery for ulcer victims. It is known by the trade name
Tagamet.
   Charles P. Ginsberg was named for his work leading the
engineering team that developed the first practical videotape.
Eugene J. Houdry, a French-born engineer, was honored for
developing the procedure that allows crude oil to be processed into
high-grade gasoline and aviation fuel.
   The selection of 10 new members is the most since six were
chosen in 1985, and brings total membership to 85. The Hall of Fame
was Founded at the Patent Office in Arlington, Va. A new Hall of
Fame building is scheduled to be built in Akron, Ohio.
   Thomas A. Edison was the first member. The Hall also includes
many of the nation's best-known inventors, including Alexander
Graham Bell, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Charles Goodyear, Rudolf
Diesel, Henry Ford and Philo T. Farnsworth.
   The newest members will be inducted in April.
