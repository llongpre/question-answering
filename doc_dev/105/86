<LEADPARA>  After years of laboring in lonely obscurity, inventor Gilbert Hyatt said
Wednesday he has finally found a friend to help him out.;   Hyatt, the
Southern California engineer who surprised the electronics industry last year
with a patent that declared him the inventor of the microprocessor, signed his
first patent licensing deal this week with North American Philips Corp., the
U.S. subsidiary of the Dutch electronics giant N.V. Philips.  </LEADPARA>

IN PATENT DEAL  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     As part of the deal, Philips has agreed to help protect Hyatt legally from
large "predatory" companies that might try to take advantage of him, as well
as to assist him in licensing his patents to other electronics firms. In
return, Philips will be compensated for its services, Hyatt said.;   "I now
have a large mentor taking care of me," Hyatt said in an interview Wednesday.
"Large companies often misperceive that an individual inventor is alone and
vulnerable, but now I have a major friend who can help me.";   Hyatt said
Philips has already helped him in his battle with Dallas-based Texas
Instruments Inc., which earlier this year contested the validity of Hyatt's
microprocessor patent through a challenge in the patent office known as an
"interference" proceeding. Until Hyatt was granted his basic microprocessor
patent last year -- after 20 years in the patent office -- both TI and Santa
Clara-based Intel Corp. had claimed credit for developing the first
microprocessor.;   Hyatt said he is waiting for a preliminary ruling from the
patent office on TI's challenge but said he is optimistic that his patent will
be upheld.;   Philips has licensed two of Hyatt's patent portfolios covering
technologies ranging from microcomputers to liquid crystal computer displays.
The licensing arrangement also covers Hyatt's microprocessor patent.;   Hyatt
declined to say how much Philips will pay for his patent portfolio but said it
was enough to support his research "for many years to come." It will also
allow him to hire a small team to assist him in his research projects.;  
Hyatt said he is in licensing negotiations with a number of other electronics
companies and expects to announce several more licenses by the end of the
year.;   Now that Philips is taking on much of the daily licensing activity,
Hyatt said he is spending a lot of time in the laboratory working on what he
called "PC 21," which stands for personal computer in the 21st century. He
wouldn't give specifics but said the computer will incorporate a number of new
computing technologies.  </TEXT>
