   Progress has been reported in the development of
the next two gizmos in the world of consumer electronics:
high-definition television and digital audio tape.
   Record companies and consumer electronics manufacturers
announced Thursday in London, as expected, that they had agreed on
a system that clears the way for introduction of digital audio
tape, or DAT, players in the United States.
   The players will permit people to make digital copies of music
from sources such as compact disc players, but they will not be
able to make digital copies of the copies.
   That is intended to prevent piracy through wholesale, high-speed
copying of digitally recorded music.
   ``The proposal for a technical restriction on unlimited DAT
copying establishes an important precedent for the protection of
intellectual property,'' Jason Berman, the president of the
Recording Industry Association of America, said in a statement.
   On high-definition television, progress in an interim step known
as advanced television was revealed by NBC, Thomson Consumer
Electronics Inc. and the David Sarnoff Research Center.
   French-owned Thomson, which makes RCA- and GE-branded television
sets, demonstrated the first wide-screen picture tube designed for
advanced television receivers. It said it would invest $75 million
in its Marion, Ind., plant to produce the new wide screens, which
have a 33 percent bigger width-to-height ratio than conventional
sets, as well as bigger conventional screens.
   NBC said it had conducted the first UHF broadcast of an advanced
television signal and the first cable transmission test of the
signal, which it calls ACTV 1.
   NBC also said it plans to test advanced television production
equipment by shooting news and sports _ including a New York Jets
football game this fall.
