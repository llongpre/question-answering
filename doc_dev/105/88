<LEADPARA>  Zenith Electronics Corp. on Wednesday reported a $23.7 million loss for the
first quarter, which it blamed on the depressed economy and systemwide
inventory reductions.;    The loss amounted to 85 cents a share, vs. a loss of
$4 million, or 56 cents a share, in the same 1990 period.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ZENITH POSTS LOSS; WANG TROUBLES CONTINUE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The company, based in Glenview, Ill., had net sales of $304 million, down 1
percent from $306 million in 1990. It said sales in all product segments were
hurt by the slow economy.;    Zenith officials said inventory reductions,
lower selling prices and increased investments in high-definition television
systems also contributed significantly to the first-quarter loss for the only
U.S. television maker.;    WANG LABORATORIES: In a report that shows it has
not reached the bottom of a painful decline, Wang Laboratories Inc. said
Wednesday it lost $48.9 million in the three months ended March 31, on sales
that fell 16 percent.;    The deficit, equal to 30 cents a share, compares
with a loss in the year-ago period of $146.6 million, or 90 cents a share.
Last year's quarter included a loss from discontinued operations of $56.9
million, or 35 cents a share.;    The sharp decline in fiscal third-quarter
sales, to $499.7 million from $593.5 million in the year-ago period, raises
the chances that the Lowell, Mass., computer maker will resort to more layoffs
to stop the flow of red ink, industry analysts said.;    VISA INTERNATIONAL:
Visa International of San Francisco on Wednesday reported a 33 percent jump in
credit card sales to a record $345.6 billion in 1990.;    By the end of the
year, the number of Visa cards increased 16.4 percent to 256.7 million, and
the number of places where they are accepted exceeded 9 million, compared with
8 million in 1989.  </TEXT>
