<TEXT>     The Farnsworth tubes were used in Europe for broadcasts of the 1936
Olympics in Berlin and of the coronation of Great Britain's King George VI in
1937.;    Some of the early work of Mr. McKenzie and the Farnsworth group is
on display in the Electronic History Museum at Foothill College in Los Altos
Hills.;    Mr. McKenzie was one of nine children born to a farmer in
Limestone, Texas. At the age of 15 he was locally acclaimed for having
invented a mule-drawn harvesting device that enhanced productivity on cotton
farms. At 16, he went to Chicago and began his education as an electronics
engineer. He completed his education after returning to Texas.;    After his
work with the Farnsworth group, Mr. McKenzie was involved in introducing
television to the American public at the 1939 World's Fair in New York.;   
During World War II, he was employed by General Electric Co., where he was
involved in the development of radar tubes and infrared image tubes. He worked
on the first infrared "sniperscope" and on a television-guided glide bomb,
which was used to destroy heavy-water plants in Germany.;    Mr. McKenzie
lived in Schenectady and Syracuse in New York from 1940 to 1958, when he moved
to Palo Alto to work for Sylvania in Mountain View.;    After his retirement
in 1971, he worked in his garage on vacuum technology associated with laser
tube processing. But failing eyesight forced him to stop two years ago. At the
age of 75, he was employed briefly as a consultant for Coherent Inc., a Palo
Alto laser manufacturer.;    "His creative mind and intense interest in
advanced technology developments . . . was a principal aspect of his character
up to the time of his death," said a son, Robert L. McKenzie of Sunnyvale.;   
Mr. McKenzie also is survived by his wife, Genevieve M. McKenzie of Palo Alto;
another son, John P. McKenzie of Walnut Creek; sisters Jean Williams of
Houston, Texas, and Rita York of Galveston, Texas; and six grandchildren.;   
Burial was in Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Los Altos.  </TEXT>
