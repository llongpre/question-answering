   After a 20-year battle, an inventor with the
habits of a monk has received a patent that could make him a rich
man, assure him a place in the history of the Information Age _ and
spell trouble for the computer industry.
   Gilbert Hyatt, a 52-year-old engineer, received the patent July
17 for a single-chip computer he invented in 1968.
   The patent appears to cover chips in everything from pocket
calculators to cars to phones to electronic dishwashers. But
experts disagreed on whether it applies to all microprocessor chips
and millions of personal computers based on them.
   Hyatt, who lives in suburban La Palma, battled with the U.S.
Patent Office for two decades before he was granted the patent, but
didn't even crack open a bottle of wine when he learned of the
decision.
   ``I don't have time to do anything like that,'' he said
Wednesday. ``I have a lot of R-and-D work to do. And I don't
drink.''
   Hyatt, who doesn't smoke either, works 14 hours a day, seven
days a week. He doesn't take vacations.
   He said he hopes to negotiate licenses under which electronics
companies will pay him royalties for using his invention. But any
money will go toward expanding his laboratory near his home and
perhaps hiring researchers, a departure from his solitary work
habits, he said.
   The patent appears broad enough to affect many companies, said
Roger Borovoy, who was general counsel at Santa Clara-based Intel
when it received microprocessor patents in 1973.
   ``It spells trouble,'' Borovoy said.
   Daniel L. Klesken, an analyst for Prudential Bache Research,
said that a 0.5 percent royalty on computer giant Intel Corp.'s
yearly revenues would yield $15 million. A 2 percent royalty would
bring him $60 million. The comparable figures for Motorola Inc. are
$7 million and $28 million, he said.
   Experts, however, predicted Hyatt would face a stiff fight from
big companies that hold patents on chips.
   ``Twenty years after the fact, it's going to be hard for him to
collect anything right away,'' said Tim Bajarin, an industry
consultant in Santa Clara.
   Placing the power of a computer on a single chip of silicon
allowed the invention of the pocket calculator, the personal
computer and numerous other products.
   The invention of the microchip is frequently credited to a team
of Intel engineers that included Ted Hoff, Federico Faggin and Stan
Mazor. They began working on the idea in 1969, although Intel's
chip wasn't shipped until 1971. Texas Instruments Inc. also entered
the market in the early 1970s.
   Intel spokesman Gordon Casey said lawyers for the company still
were studying the 80-page patent document to determine what it
covers.
   Hyatt began working on the technology at Micro Computer Inc.,
which he founded in 1968. The company grew to about 25 employees
before going out of business in 1971, he said.
   ``The work I did at Micro Computer Inc. is the forerunner of the
PCs,'' Hyatt said. ``I don't know if all PCs are using the same
technology in the patents, but they sure stem from the work I did.''
   He said he is not bitter about seeing his invention widely used
without financial gain to him in the years since he filed his
claim, and he will not seek retroactive payments. ``That's how
business works,'' he said.
   The biggest loser, he said, has been the industry. ``Keeping me
poor and tight has kept really marvelous technology out of the
market,'' he said.
   Bajarin said the patent assures Hyatt a place in computer
history.
   ``He can lay claim to being a forefather of the processor,''
Bajarin said. ``I was made aware of this case over 10 years ago.
Our comment was at that time, `Show us a patent.' Well, now he's
got the patent.''
