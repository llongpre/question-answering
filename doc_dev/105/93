   A National Cable Television Center and
Museum has opened to preserve the roots of an industry that in 40
years has gone from using simple wires leading from a shared
antenna to satellites.
   More than 30 past and present cable television executives and
cable TV ``aficionados'' gathered at the opening of the center and
museum at Penn State University Oct. 4.
   Among the displays at the museum are an old RCA television with
gauges added to measure the strength of a cable signal, a model of
the first satellite uplink truck, papers, photographs and other
memorabilia.
   The center also includes a room with oral histories from cable
pioneers and information about cable companies around the country;
a viewing room for a videotape collection now being gathered; and a
conference room.
   Marlowe Froke, a Penn State professor and the center's director,
said students taking courses in cable television and scholars would
get a good idea of the industry's history from the exhibits.
   ``It provides a dramatic visualization of some of the history of
the industry that couldn't be captured in conventional textbooks,''
Froke said.
   Benjamin J. Conroy Jr., chairman of the board of the museum,
said he hoped the museum would expand beyond its temporary location
in a building basement.
   ``While this is a good start, it's only a beginning,'' said
Conroy, who is from Austin, Texas. He said he hoped the museum one
day would occupy a building or at least its own wing in a building.
   Since the early cable stations, the industry's technical
know-how and audience has increased dramatically.
   Cable television began in 1948 in Pennsylvania and Oregon and
quickly spread to remote communities across the country that
couldn't pick up standard TV signals.
   Microwave was used in cable television for the first time in
1953 and experimental satellite systems were tested in 1973 as the
number of viewers increased.
   More than 42 million viewers in 20,000 communities now receive
cable television, close to 60 percent of all TV viewers.
   Most of the funding for the museum and center came from Cable
Television Pioneers, National Cable Televisions Association and
Community Antenna Television Association.
