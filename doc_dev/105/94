   SAN FRANCISCO -- A U.S. unit of Philips Electronics N.V.
said it agreed to license a controversial patent for the
design of a microprocessor awarded last year to a California
inventor.
   The move by North American Philips Corp. boosts the
credibility of Gilbert Hyatt's patent claim, which has been
attacked by semiconductor concerns and patent experts. An
Intel Corp. engineer is also said to have invented the
microprocessor, and Intel was the first company to produce
the so-called computer on a chip.

   Philips, which is the first company to publicly announce
the licensing of Mr. Hyatt's microprocessor patent, didn't
disclose the terms of its deal. The U.S. unit of the Dutch
electronics company said it also agreed to license 22 other
patents held by Mr. Hyatt and promised to assist him in
licensing his patent portfolio to others.
   "We have always believed that he is the rightful inventor
{of the microprocessor}, and that he's going to prevail,"
said a Philips spokeswoman, who put the potential value of
Mr. Hyatt's patents at $100 million over 17 years.
   A spokesman for Mr. Hyatt said he expected that other
large companies would announce licensing deals before the end
of the year.
