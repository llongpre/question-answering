  [Text] The Patent Office has begun to study revision of 
the Patent Law to enable foreign individuals and corporations to 
present their patent applications in English. So far, patent 
applications have been allowed to be made only in Japanese. 
This will make the expedited review of patent applications for 
technology from overseas applicants possible. 
  The patents issue is an important item on the agenda of the 
Japan-U.S. economic consultations, and the United States insists 
that the requirement for applying in Japanese only has worked as 
a trade barrier. The Patent Office has come to believe the 
revision will lead to growth of not only applications from the 
United States, but also of such English-speaking regions as 
Europe and Oceania. The office plans to present the revision 
bill to the Diet's extraordinary session in the Fall for 
enactment from July 1995. 
  The current Patent Law does not accept applications in 
English, which means overseas inventors can submit their 
applications only after translating the contents of the invented 
technology into Japanese. Moreover, at present, correction of 
submitted translations is not allowed in principle. 
  Sometimes problems occur of misinterpretation as a result of 
hasty translation done in order to submit applications as 
quickly as possible and of inventors failing to get patents 
approved as a result of this. For instance, when a U.S. company 
applied for a patent on the technology of junctioning nickel 
alloys, boron [hoso] was mistranslated as shuso [bromine], and 
the company was unable to win the patent even though it brought 
the matter to the Tokyo Appellate Court for review. 
  Under the revised law, the foreign applicants: 1) Will be 
allowed to submit their patent applications in English on the 
condition that Japanese translations will be submitted within 
two months after submission of applications; and 2) will be 
allowed to make corrections on mistranslations, if any, within 
three months of the Patent Office announcement of "not approving 
a patent" at the end of a review period. 
  Japan receives about 34,000 patent applications from foreign 
nationals each year, and the number is close to 10 percent of 
the total 370,000 applications received nationally. As for 
types of inventions applied for, those which compete with 
Japanese-pioneered technologies such as semiconductors are 
growing. As such, the merits of making quick applications in 
English without taking the time to translate them into Japanese 
will be substantial. The Patent Office said: "This means 
setting up a system wherein patent approval review will be done 
on terms equal to those for Japanese inventions. It should 
contribute to alleviating the trade surplus which the United 
States charges is unfair. 
  In January 1994, the Japanese and U.S. Governments agreed to 
revise the Patent Laws of the two nations in part toward the 
goal of unifying their patent systems, and this revision of the 
law will be the first action taken under the agreement. The 
next step Japan wants to take is to ask the United States to 
change its current system of basing its patent rights on who 
"first invented" to one used by Japan and Europe of basing it on 
who "first applied."
