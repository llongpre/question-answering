One of the great inventions of the 20th century, the cathode ray tube (CRT),
is heading towards obsolescence. The challenger in the vast and constantly
growing market for television and computer screens is liquid crystal.
The quality of liquid crystal display (LCD) screens - which are thin, flat
and portable - has leapt forward in recent years. Sharp, the Japanese
electronics company, sold the world's first calculators with LCD screens in
1973. After nearly two decades of research and development, however, LCD
panels on personal computers are still seen as a poor substitute for the
CRT.
Yet this view is quickly becoming outdated. Sharp is now marketing 8.6-inch
colour televisions in Japan with brilliant colours and fast response. NEC
last year began marketing portable computers with full-colour LCD screens
using the most sophisticated thin film transistor (TFT) technology, in which
contrast and response time are boosted by adding a transistor to each
display cell or pixel. IBM recently announced a similar product.
While brightness and the restricted viewing angle on LCD screens need to be
improved, the quality of these screens will gradually change the popular
perception that LCD is a second-rate technology. Even more important,
manufacturing yields on high-end products for this extremely difficult
device are beginning to approach respectability, raising the prospect of a
classic virtuous circle in new product technology. As yields rise,
manufacturing costs and prices are dropping rapidly. This in turn is
stimulating growth in the market, which again encourages more investment,
improved technology and lower prices still.
Japanese companies, the only significant producers, are talking about a
quadrupling of the market in a few years, compared with 1991 production of
Y255bn. Last year production grew by 40 per cent, compared with 33 per cent
average growth in the past five years. LCD screens have become one of the
few bright spots in an otherwise dull outlook for the electronics industry.
Few people, other than television picture tube manufacturers, will mourn the
decline of the CRT. Anyone who has gone home bleary-eyed after spending the
day staring into the flickering display of a personal computer knows why it
needs to go. The flickering may be faster than the eye can perceive, but it
still causes fatigue. The latest LCD screens, by contrast, display a solid,
sharp image that holds steady.
Worries about electromagnetic radiation fields surrounding the CRT, and its
effect on pregnant women, will also hasten its demise for many uses. CRTs
are bulky, heavy, use lots of electricity and cannot be made perfectly flat,
unlike LCD panels. Yet in spite of its drawbacks, the CRT will not be easy
to replace because the technology is so well established.
In the past year electronics giants such as Sharp, Matsushita, NEC, Canon,
and Toshiba and IBM (in a joint venture) have joined a race to meet growing
demand by committing hundreds of millions of dollars to manufacture colour
LCD screens.
Liquid crystals, which display properties of both solids and liquids, were
first discovered in 1888, but it was not until 1963 that scientists at RCA,
the US electronics group, discovered the principle that lies behind all LCD
displays: that an electrical charge causes liquid crystal molecules to
realign and rechannel light waves.
In simple LCD devices, known as twisted nematic (TN), liquid crystal
molecules are held in a double sandwich of polarising filters and glass
plates. The filters sit on the outside of the sandwich and are turned at 90
degrees, which blocks light passing straight through the glass.
The liquid crystal, however, is also aligned at 90 degrees by grooves in the
glass. This causes the light to twist and the filters to be neutralised. But
when electricity is applied to the liquid crystal, the molecules straighten
and the light is again blocked by the filter. The end result is that display
cells can be made to lighten or darken as their opaqueness is switched off
or on by electricity.
Unfortunately, however, when a display is increased in size the contrast
between dark and light areas of the screen tends to decline. To compensate
for this, LCD makers have sought to increase the twisting effect and thereby
heighten contrast as light is refracted.
In 'super twisted' nematic displays (STN) light is twisted by between 180
and 260 degrees, producing the blue screens familiar to portable and laptop
computer users. In 'double super twisted' nematic (DSTN) displays, two STN
cells are used, twisting the light one direction and then back, so that
light of high contrast is possible.
In a final variation of this theme, 'triple super twisted' nematic (TSTN),
refracting polymer film is applied to the STN cell, allowing thinner
displays with a high degree of contrast, thus permitting colour display when
red-blue-green filters are attached to the cells.
These elaborations on the simple LCD mechanism, however, have a range of
shortcomings. While the TN contrast ratio of 1:6 is increased to 1:20 for
TSTN, this is still insufficient to reproduce the entire range of colours
familiar in a colour picture tube. Furthermore, response times of 150
milliseconds are insufficient to keep up with moving video images, and
cannot track a mouse moving across a screen.
In answer to these shortcomings, the industry is moving in two directions.
Most companies are improving displays by adding a tiny transistor to each
cell in order to increase the charging power. This technology, called thin
film transistor, boasts a contrast ratio of 1:100, allowing for full-colour
displays and response times fast enough for video display. The result,
however, is a device of staggering complexity, including at least 10 layers
of materials, finely etched circuitry, and transistors that are shorted out
by a microscopic speck of dust.
Canon, the camera and office equipment company, is moving in a different
direction, using a proprietary technology that is likely to grab a big
section of the market for engineering workstations and desktop publishing.
Canon's 'ferroelectric' displays use a liquid crystal material which
responds more quickly to electrical charges. The molecules are more
difficult to align and control than normal liquid crystal chemicals, yet
after solving these problems Canon has developed a screen that has higher
contrast and faster response times than other simple matrix systems. The
screen also promises to be much cheaper to mass produce than TFT screens
because no transistors are required.
The relative sensitivity to shock of ferroelectric displays makes them
unsuitable for portable computers, however, and the response time is
insufficient for video. Colour reproduction is also inferior to TFT,
although photographs can be displayed with sufficient fidelity to allow easy
computer editing.
Yet the remarkable high quality and stability of the display - looking
almost like printed paper behind glass - could make it the biggest threat
yet to the CRT in offices. Indeed, when Canon finishes a new manufacturing
facility in 1994, it will enter the market at the high end, with 15-inch
screens which it hopes eventually to sell at a price similar to that of the
CRT.
The CRT looks likely to prevail for TV picture tubes larger than 15 or so
inches. This is because large LCD screens are still too difficult to make.
But beyond 36 inches LCD once again comes into its own as the core of video
projection devices, including high-definition television.
Yet the technology for LCD has been evolving so rapidly that it is difficult
to project how the market will develop. Research into a range of radically
different approaches to flat panel displays is also continuing apace. The
inherent complexity of LCD manufacture, has raised fears that it could be
made obsolete quickly by a simpler technology.
The investment by electronics companies into LCD manufacturing facilities is
an impressive sign that the technology has come of age. This commitment by
the industry itself should help the market to become established quickly.
A further article on LCD technology, addressing the manufacturing
challenges, will appear on Thursday.
