   The cause of death was not disclosed.

positions before being named the company's first engineering fellow

fellow, the company's highest technical position.
   Wyeth invented 25 processes and products that spanned a wide
range, including plastics, textile fibers, electronics and
mechanical systems.
   He is survived by his wife, Jean, five sons, his brother, three
sisters, three stepsons and a stepdaughter.
