   The Australian airline Qantas has ordered two
Boeing 747-400s and one 767-300 with extended range capability,
Boeing Commercial Airplanes said Thursday.
   The planes will be delivered between September and December 1989
and will cost about $380 million, including spare parts and
support, Boeing said in a news release.
   Qantas Chairman J.B. Leslie said the new planes, which will give
Qantas a 43-plane fleet, will serve the growing tourist market to
Australia. The airplanes will be financed by Qantas' foreign
exchange earnings and by overseas borrowings, he said.
   The order gives Qantas six of the advanced-technology 747-400s,
the world's largest commercial jetliner, and five extended-range
767-300s.
   The four-engine 747-400, which made its first flight this
spring, can carry up to 660 passengers. With a more typical
configuration for 412 in two classes, the plane can fly more than
7,300 nautical miles, or from San Francisco to Melbourne.
   The twin-engine 767-300 is capable of hauling up to 375
passengers, but can fly more than 7,000 miles with 210 aboard.
   So far this year, Boeing has had orders for 401 jetliners worth
$18.2 billion, compared with 366 jets worth a record $19.9 billion
in 1987.
   Boeing now has 148 orders for 747-400s and 103 orders for
767-300s.
