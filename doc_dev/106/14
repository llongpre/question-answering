   The first Boeing 737-500, the latest version of
the world's top-selling commercial jetliner, was delivered
Wednesday to Southwest Airlines.
   Boeing said the 104-passenger plane was flown to Dallas, where
the regional carrier is based, 16 days after receiving flight
certification from the Federal Aviation Administration.
   Nineteen customers have ordered a totak 193 737-500s, which cost
roughly $25 million each.
   As of last Thursday, total orders for all models of the
twin-engine 737, Boeing's smallest jetliner, amounted to 2,771
planes, said T. Craig Martin of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group.
   The more quiet, efficient and technologically advanced 737-500
replaces the 737-100 and 737-200 versions, which made their first
flights in 1967, Martin said.
   Production of the first two models ended after 1,144 were
delivered, the last a 737-200 for Xiamen Airlines of China on Aug.
8, 1988, said Martin.
   Other versions still in production are the 128-passenger 737-300
and 146-passenger 737-400.
