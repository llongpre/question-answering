   Poland's national airline established two firsts
by ordering advanced U.S. aircraft and planning to offer two classes
of service in the new jets.
   Boeing Co. will sell three 767 wide-body jets to LOT Polish
Airlines, marking the first time a Soviet bloc nation has purchased
modern, American jets. The deal, announced Friday, is worth $220
million to Boeing and General Electric Co., the engine supplier.
   LOT also said it would offer business- and economy-class service
on the jets. Only one class of service currently is offered on the
Soviet-made aircraft that make up LOT's 45-plane fleet.
   The state-owned airline said the three jets would be used on
flights linking Poland with the United States and Thailand. It said
they should help double its traffic between Poland and the United
States as early as next year.
   The moves were seen as the first attempt by an Eastern bloc
airline to compete with Western concerns for Western passengers,
particularly business travelers, who pay higher fares but also
demand a high level of service.
   Boeing officials said they hoped the deal, though relatively
small, would lead to more deals with Poland and other Soviet bloc
nations.
   ``We're very proud and pleased that we were selected. It's a
major breakthrough for us,'' said Rudy Hillinga, director of sales
for Central and Eastern Europe for Boeing Commercial Airplanes Co.
   Boeing said it will be the first to deliver modern, wide-body
jets made in the West to a Soviet bloc nation because it will
deliver its first two planes to Poland before Europe's Airbus
consortium delivers two A-310s to East Germany under a previously
announced deal.
   Boeing will deliver two 767-200s in April and May 1989 and one
767-300 in June 1990. All will be extended-range models, powered by
General Electric CF6-80C2 engines. Boeing declined to specify how
the $220 million price was split between Boeing and GE.
   Although Poland has a desperate shortage of hard currency to buy
Western goods, the airline is an exception because it brings in hard
currencies every time it flies to the West. That made the financing
relatively easy.
   In a deal financed by unspecified Western banks, LOT will lease
the airplanes and engines for 12 years, at the end of which it will
own them, Hillinga said. Boeing and GE will be paid by the banks.
   LOT said it will use the jetliners on its routes between Warsaw
and New York, Chicago and Bangkok, Thailand. Later, Montreal and
Toronto will be added.
