  [Text] Stockholm--Saab Aircraft AB announced 17 January in 
Linkoeping that its new, radar-carrying Saab-340-AEW had made 
its first test flight, which lasted two hours. 
  The structure of the new Airborne Early Warning (AEW) model, 
which is based on a twinjet commercial airplane with a Saab-340 
type propellor, was reinforced to carry a 900-kg radar made by 
the Swedish company Ericsson Radar Electronics. 
  The rear of the aircraft was altered to hold an auxiliary 
electrical power system (APU - Auxiliary Power Unit) to supply 
the radar, its cooling device, and the equipment for cooling its 
computers. 
  Sweden's Defense Equipment Office (FMV) ordered six of the 
aircraft for surveillance of national land and sea territory. A 
spokesperson for Saab Aircraft AB said that construction of the 
craft, excluding radar, would cost just over 500 million Swedish 
crowns (a little over 365 million French francs [Fr], give or 
take). 
  The new Saab-340-AEW, which the British have nicknamed "the 
poor man's AWAC", has attracted the notice of international 
specialists. This, says the company spokesperson, "is a very 
good sign for future exports." The first AEW will be delivered 
to Sweden's defense forces during the first quarter of 1995.
