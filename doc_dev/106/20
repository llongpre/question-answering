   Deliveries of some of Boeing Co.'s new 747-400
jumbo jets will be delayed by a month or so, Boeing Commercial
Airplanes said.
   Dean D. Thornton, president of the Boeing operating company,
said Tuesday that of the 161 747-400s ordered by 21 customers, 20
planes will be delivered an average of one month past the
previously agreed upon date.
   ``We intend to obtain Federal Aviation Administration
certification of the 747-400 in December, to deliver the first two
aircraft that month and to be back on our original schedule by
mid-1989,'' Thornton said.
   Two deliveries will be pushed back from December to early 1989,
and there will be a substantial reduction in first-quarter 1989
deliveries, the company said in a news release. Most of the
deliveries will be made up in the second quarter of 1989, it said.
   Thornton said far more orders for the new jet were received from
customers on an earlier schedule than anticipated when the program
was launched in October 1985.
   Thornton said the delays are due to the increase of 747
production rates at Boeing's Everett plant from two planes to five
a month and to customers seeking a wider variety of plane
configurations than on earlier programs.
   The delays also stem from the 747-400s being offered with three
different engine types, with each being introduced and certified in
a record four months.
   Boeing is doing its best to minimize the impact of the delays on
customers, Thornton said, including working overtime and
reassigning additional experienced workers to the 747 plant.
   The new jet, which made its first flight earlier this year, is
the largest commercial jet in production. The plane will be able to
carry 412 passengers more than 8,000 miles, and greater passenger
loads on shorter trips.
