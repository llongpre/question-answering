   The B-2 Stealth bomber
completed its seventh test flight Saturday, including an in-flight
shutdown and startup of its four engines, the Air Force said.
   The bomber took off from Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave
desert at 7:14 a.m. and returned at 2:31 p.m. The 7-hour, 17-minute
flight included two aerial refuelings.
   Each of the aircraft's four General Electric F118 engines were
deliberately stopped, then restarted about midway through the
flight, the Air Force said.
   The bomber's crew also conducted normal and alternate landing
gear extensions.
   Air Force test pilot Lt. Col. John Small and Northrop Corp.
chief test pilot Bruce J. Hinds were in the cockpit of the advanced
technology bomber.
   The bomber was designed to reduce radar detection through the
use of composite materials and countoured surfaces, which absorb
radar signals instead of reflecting the signals.
   The strategic bomber made its first flight July 17.
   The B-2, which is capable of delivering nuclear and conventional
weapons, is intended to replace the nation's aging B-52 strategic
bomber fleet.
   With an estimated price $530 million per airplane, the B-2 is
considered the world's most expensive aircraft.
