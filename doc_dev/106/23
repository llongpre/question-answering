   Two test pilots took a successful
15-minute test flight Sunday in a prototype of a revolutionary
aircraft designed to perform like both a helicopter and an airplane,
officials said.
   The V-22 Osprey, the world's first production tilt-rotor
aircraft, remained in helicopter mode throughout the flight,
according to officials of Bell Boeing of Fort Worth, a consortium of
two companies which built the craft.
   Bell Boeing officials described tests in aircraft mode as ``a
milestone soon to be accomplished.''
   The V-22 Osprey performed both a slow taxi liftoff and a vertical
takeoff during the landmark maneuvers and made conventional
``run-on'' landings, the officials said. Its top speed during the
tests was limited to 20 knots, less than 25 mph.
   The aircraft combines the operational capabilities of a
helicopter with those of a fixed-wind turboprop. With its engines
and prop-rotors vertical, the V-22 takes off, hovers and lands like
a helicopter.
   With its prop-rotors in forward position, the Osprey would become
a fast, fuel-efficient, high-altitude turboprop airplane capable of
reaching speeds of more than 345 mph.
   Boeing Helicopters President Don Chesnut said the Osprey gives
the U.S. military ``the ability to develop new missions and tactics
that cannot be accomplished by any existing helicopter or airplane.''
   Six flight-test prototypes are being built by Bell Helicopter
Textron Inc. in Fort Worth and Boeing Helicopters of Philadelphia, a
division of Boeing Co., under a $1.8 billion full-scale development
contract issued by the U.S. Naval Air Systems Command.
   The versatile Osprey is the first modern weapons system designed
from conception to meet requirements of all four U.S. armed
services, with deliveries expected to begin in 1992.
