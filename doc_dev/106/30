   A man trying to become the first pilot to fly
a solar-powered plane from coast to coast glided the craft across
the Mississippi River, a spokesman said.
   Eric Raymond landed the Sun-Seeker Monday in a field near
Greenville, Ill., about 50 miles from St. Louis, said flight
trainer Jack Whitehouse. Raymond flew 141 miles in four hours from
Fulton, Mo., he said.
   That put Raymond 1,620 miles into his trip, which began Aug. 2
in Desert Center, Calif. His destination is Kitty Hawk, N.C., where
Orville and Wilbur Wright made the first successful
heavier-than-air airplane flight in 1903.
   Raymond landed in a field because he couldn't reach an airport.
A wiring malfunction prevented use of the solar-powered batteries
his ultralight glider uses to turn the propeller for takeoffs and
landings, Whitehouse said.
