<BYLINE>Air Force Makes Public First Drawing of `Flying Wing'

   Imagine two huge wings from an airplane bolted
together without any fuselage in the center. The Air Force says
that's the general shape of the new Stealth bomber.
   Piercing a decade of official secrecy, the Air Force on
Wednesday released an artist's drawing of its newest strategic
bomber and announced the plane would make its maiden flight later
this fall.
   The service also acknowledged the program was suffering some
cost overruns and that a new estimate would have to be released
later this year.
   ``Some cost growth is to be expected in any development program
that is on the leading edge of technology like the B-2,'' the Air
Force said, using the bomber's official military designation.
   ``But the acquisition of the B-2 ensures our capability to
effectively penetrate Soviet defenses well into the 21st century.''
   The Stealth bomber is so named because it is designed to fly
without showing up on radar. While the Air Force has flatly refused
to discuss the bomber since design work began in the 1970s, its
general shape has actually been known since 1985 when former
Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater disclosed its resemblance to a
``flying wing.''
   The drawing distributed by the Air Force Wednesday shows an
airplane that to some extent resembles a boomerang. A small cockpit
rises in the middle on top and inlets for the jet engines are
placed to each side of the cockpit, also on top of the wing.
   The design allows the aircraft to be made without any sharp or
right angles. According to Pentagon sources, the plane also relies
on the use of radar-absorbing coatings on its exterior surfaces and
composite materials for construction.
   The design has long been the object of experimentation by the
Northrop Corp., which is building the B-2 for the Air Force. The
company flew a propeller-driven version of such a plane, known as
the XB-35, in 1946.
   A jet-powered version, the YB-49, first flew in late 1947 and
was tested by the Air Force. But the service never purchased any of
the planes, and experimentation with the prototypes ended by the
early 1950s.
   The Air Force declined Wednesday to give a precise date for the
maiden flight, saying only that it would occur ``this fall'' and
involve a short hop from the manufacturing plant at Palmdale,
Calif., to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``As the first flight approaches, many actions associated with
preparations for that flight can best be accomplished in the open,
without compromising program security,'' the service said in
explaining its relaxation of secrecy.
   Details of such things as performance characteristics, crew size
and maximum payload remain classified, however, the Air Force said.
Indeed, some of the details about the plane's design _ for example,
the placement of the engine exhaust outlets _ have been
deliberately masked in the artist's rendering, service sources said.
   The Air Force did acknowledge, however, the plane is going to
cost more than originally projected.
   ``While the acquisition of 132 B-2 bombers was originally
estimated to cost $36.6 billion in 1981 dollars, the Air Force is
re-evaluating cost estimates for the program as a result of current
and projected fiscal constraints,'' the service said.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, lauded the Air Force for releasing more information
about the plane, saying the public needs to learn about ``a
revolutionary addition to our nuclear deterrent.''
   He predicted the bomber ``will render obsolete billions of
dollars of Soviet investment in their current air defense.''
