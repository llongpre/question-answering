   Officials at a federal hearing into a
jet crash that killed 112 people said Tuesday they are not ready to
conclude that a hairline crack in an engine fan disk caused the
DC-10's engine to explode.
   James Nall, the National Transportation Safety Board member in
charge of the Sioux City hearing, said no final decision on the
cause of the July 19 United Airlines crash will be issued for
months, after the full NTSB meets to review testimony.
   ``This is simply a portion of the investigation _ part of the
early stages of it,'' Nall said on the first of four days of
hearings.
   Investigators are focusing their study on a disk from the
airplane's tail-mounted engine. They believe a flaw in the disk's
metal caused it to explode, sending pieces of metal ripping through
the airplane's tail section and severing the hydraulic lines that
give pilots control of the aircraft.
   A report released Tuesday said the fan disk of the jet's rear
engine had a hairline crack less than a half-inch long before the
plane's final flight.
   A Federal Aviation Administration official said last week that
tests on the fan disk indicated the crack was caused by a flaw in
the metal that probably was present when the disk was made 18 years
ago by General Electric Co.
   But NTSB officials said they have drawn no final conclusions.
   United Airlines spokesman Robert Doughty also said Tuesday that
it is too early to pinpoint the cause of the engine explosion.
Doughty said experts have only had 12 days to study the disk.
   ``A full analysis takes two months,'' he testified. ``It's
really premature to make a judgment.''
   The NTSB report is based on detailed testing of the fan disk,
found in two pieces in corn fields near Alta, about 80 miles east
of Sioux Gateway Airport, where the airplane cartwheeled and burst
into flames as pilots tried to make an emergency landing.
   The report by NTSB Senior Metallurgist James F. Wildey II said
the disk had two cracks but that only one existed before the
explosion. The report said that crack was visible to the naked eye
after the accident, but did not say whether the crack was
detectable earlier.
   NTSB spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz said Wildey did not attempt to
determine whether the crack was detectable before the crash.
   Lopatkiewicz also said the report does not conclude that the
crack was due to a flaw in the titanium disk that might have
existed for years.
   Wildley is scheduled to testify Wednesday.
   In another written report to the NTSB, flight simulator expert
John C. Clark said United pilot Al C. Haynes had virtually no
chance to make a safe landing after the hydraulic systems lost
fluid. Clark assembled a panel of experts who used flight
simulators to fly a DC-10 with no hydraulic controls.
   ``The consensus of the group was that the pilot could fly the
airplane but an adequate landing could not be accomplished within
the pilot's control,'' Clark said in the report.
   Engineering Test Pilot Phillip Battaglia of McDonnell Douglas,
which built the DC-10, testified that the company had not
anticipated an explosion severing all three hydraulic lines.
   Battaglia said that since there was no precedent, the company
did not have instructions on how a pilot should deal with such a
problem, and said it was unlikely any instructions could help a
pilot safely land anyway.
   ``It's my opinion that this is not a trainable maneuver,'' he
said.
   The plane cartwheeled to a stop at the edge of a cornfield on
airport property, which hampered rescue efforts, said the airport's
fire chief.
   Firefighters had trouble dousing the burning aircraft and
locating survivors because of the standing corn, said James
Hathaway of the Iowa National Guard. The Guard is in charge of
firefighting at the airport.
   The corn did provide refuge for those fleeing the burning plane,
acting as a barrier to the radiant heat, he said.
   The airport leases land along its runways to farmers. At the
time of the crash the corn stood 6 feet or taller.
   FAA regulations allow crops to be grown on airport land and
officials say the practice is common in the Midwest. But a proposed
FAA advisory to airports recommends that farming be limited and
that crops not be planted within 1,200 feet of any runway center
line.
