   With his flight instructor at his side, Daniel Shanklin touched down and
bounced twice at First Flight Airstrip, next to the Wright Brothers Memorial

<TEXT>     "That was the worst landing I've ever had and I wanted it to be the best,"
said Daniel, of San Antonio.;    About 300 schoolchildren from nearby Kitty
Hawk and Manteo cheered as Daniel flew over.;    He received T-shirts and
commemorative pins from merchants and a birthday cake in the shape of an
airplane. He turns 8 today.;    Daniel took off from San Diego on May 26 in a
Cessna 172, stopping in several cities along the way.;    The boy's
grandfather, Dr. Ken Shanklin, 59, of Fresno, said he believed the flight was
a record for the youngest pilot to fly coast to coast.;    The Guinness Book
of World Records doesn't keep such records by age. The National Aeronautics
Association stopped keeping age-related flight records in the late 1980s.;   
Daniel said he wasn't sure why he made the flight, except that his grandfather
encouraged him to. Daniel's 9-year-old brother, Michael, also flew along in
his grandfather's six-seat airplane, as did flight instructor Stuart Moon.;   
During the flight, Daniel sat on a booster seat and had a cushion behind his
back. Blocks were attached to the rudder pedals so his legs could reach them.;
   The boy was in the air an average of two hours in the morning and two hours
in the afternoon, Moon said.  </TEXT>
