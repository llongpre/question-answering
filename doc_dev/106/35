   A bespectacled language professor says no
one got his side of the story before mistakenly arresting him
because of a note he found that threatened to blow up an American
Airlines jetliner.
   Now that his ordeal is over, Peter M. Canning, 40, said at a news
conference Saturday, he's headed for a job interview at Yale
University. He was on his way Tuesday to a New Orleans convention,
where he hoped to have several job interviews, when a stewardess
mistakenly thought a note Canning found in his tray-table was a bomb
threat written by him.
   ``I thought it was a nightmare at first. It occurred to me that I
might wake up,'' said Canning, a lecturer at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   He said he hasn't decided whether to sue anyone over the false
charge of making a bomb threat Tuesday aboard flight 240 from San
Francisco to Dallas. He was arrested in Albuquerque, N.M., where the
plane made an emergency landing.
   Charges were dropped Thursday, after an 11-year-old boy admitted
he wrote the note and left it on the plane. The boy took the flight
just before Canning's and had sat in the same seat as Canning.
   When the dropping of the charges was announced, Jim Nelson, the
FBI's top agent in New Mexico, said he regretted ``any inconvenience
or embarrassment suffered by Mr. Canning'' but said the arrest was
justified based on what agents knew at the time.
   Canning's attorney in Albuquerque, Ray Twohig, said he has
advised Canning to wait a week or so before deciding what action to
take.
   Canning, in his first statement since charges were dropped, told
how he handed the note to a flight attendant after it fell into his
lap from a fold-out tray after lunch.
   ``Part of the note said, `There is bombs planted all over this
airplane.' ... Two minutes into reading this, I thought it was
placed there as a prank,'' said Canning, a slightly built man who
wore tinted glasses, jeans and a wool sports coat.
   He told reporters he gave the crumpled, two-page note to a flight
attendant, who walked to the front of the plane.
   ``Thirty seconds later she returned and said `Is this your note?'
and I said `No, it is not.' But before I could say anything else,
she spun on her heels _ she was understandably nervous _ but no one
ever came back to ask me for an explanation,'' he said.
   The plane was diverted to Albuquerque, where Canning was
questioned by the FBI for two hours and arrested. Later, authorities
asked him to supply several handwriting samples.
   ``I didn't start panicking, I started getting angry,'' said
Canning.
   He was arraigned in federal court in New Mexico and released on
his own recognizance.
   He learned that the charges had been dropped while driving back
to Berkeley in a rental car Friday night because no airline would
book him a seat. He had stopped at a restaurant near the
California-Arizona border and saw a newspaper headline.
   ``I'm now relieved, as you can imagine,'' Canning said.
   Before the incident, Canning was en route to the convention of
the Modern Language Association in New Orleans, where the Harvard
doctoral candidate hoped to attend several job interviews.
   Faculty members at Yale agreed to reschedule his interview, he
said, adding that it was too soon to tell whether missing several
other interviews will hurt his career.
