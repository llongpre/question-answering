&amp; Ordnance Division of MITI] 
  [Text] The aircraft industry is in a predicament worldwide 
as a result of cutbacks in defense spending and poor business 
conditions among the airlines. Although the Japanese aircraft 
industry has been growing steadily up until now -- first, in 
connection with overcoming the handicap of being left behind by 
the rest of the world as a result of Japan's defeat in World War 
II and, second, in connection with surviving in the narrow niche 
in the market -- it has yet to face many problems that are now 
known to other high-tech industries. 
  Historically, it is a universal fate of the aircraft 
industry 
of any nation that it can not live without the support of the 
government, because of its close ties to the defense industry 
and because of the huge risks involved in development projects. 
In addition to that, the Japanese aircraft industry is unique in 
that the degree of its dependency on defense needs is much 
higher than that in the United States and Europe; there are only 
a few manufacturers that are dedicated to aircraft production; 
defense needs consist of mostly license productions; and the 
bulk of commercial aircraft and engine productions are also 
limited to subassembly-level productions. 
  Although we cannot deny that such an industrial structure 
has 
made sense up until now, it is obvious that, in light of the 
situation the world aircraft industry will be at the threshold 
of the twenty-first century, an increase in the ratio of 
commercial needs is urgently needed and supporting factors such 
as R&amp;D capabilities and human resources need to improve. 
<H5>  Pursuit of Autonomy </H5>
  If the first task consists in maintaining an optimum balance 
between risk-free defense needs and the risky commercial needs, 
the second task consists in tackling various projects that 
maintain the optimum balance. The projects that are currently 
under way can be divided into those that require developments 
under Japan's own leadership, such as YSX (commercial jet, 
seating 75-90 passengers) and the ``small engine'' project, and 
those futuristic large-scale international projects such as the 
``supersonic airplane'' and the ``ultralarge airplane.'' In 
addition to the above, there are projects that are already in 
the production or marketing phases, such as the ``B 777'' and 
``V 2500 engine'' projects. Development of new technologies such 
as helicopters and new materials should not be overlooked, 
either. While all of those projects need to be promoted in a 
concerted manner to order to keep an optimum balance, it is 
important for us to realize that the premises for it have to be 
aggressive challenges in technological innovations and the 
pursuit of Japan's autonomy under the framework of international 
cooperation. 
<H5>  Maiden Flight in 21st Century </H5>
  YS-11 was developed in Japan about 30 years ago (182 
airplanes sold since); more than 100 of them are still in 
service around the world today. Many people wonder why that 
turboprop airplane seating 60 passengers is, for whatever 
reason, the only commercial airplane ever produced in Japan, a 
country of such technological capability. But times are 
changing, and many promising buds are about to unfold. 
  The YSX project has entered the feasibility study phase 
already; if an economically and politically favorable conclusion 
comes out of it, development will start within two years, and 
the maiden flight will probably take place at the beginning of 
the twenty-first century. 
<H5>  Enhancing International Cooperation </H5>
  Despite its current stagnation, the number of airline 
passengers worldwide is predicted to increase by 6 percent 
annually on a long-term basis. Amidst the worldwide trend of 
expectations of long-term stable growth of the aircraft 
industry, which is certain to bring about innovations and have 
synergistic effects on related industries, Japan must try to 
further advance and expand its horizons while enhancing 
international cooperation at the same time.
