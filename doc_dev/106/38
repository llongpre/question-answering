   Kirk Kerkorian makes most of his
news these days trading in movie and casino companies, but the
investor who's among those rumored to be interested in Eastern
Airlines made his first fortune in airplanes.
   Kerkorian, who controls MGM-UA Communications Co. and the luxury
airline MGM Grand Inc., got his start in business by building a
charter airline after World War II. Over the years, he has showed
varying degrees of interest in Western Air Lines and Pan Am as well.
   Now, sources close to strike-bound Eastern say Kerkorian may be
interested in bidding on the airline.
   Kerkorian's staff wouldn't comment Tuesday on media reports
concerning Eastern.
   The 71-year-old investor, whose personal wealth is estimated by
Forbes magazine at $950 million, shuns publicity. But the complex
financial maneuvers of his Tracinda Corp. investment company are
frequent news, particularly in Hollywood, where almost weekly
rumors swirl over the fate of debt-burdened MGM-UA.
   Kerkorian controls about 80 percent of the movie company, which
he assembled out of parts of the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United
Artists studios. In the last year he has proposed bringing in
outside investors to run the MGM half, then suggested he would sell
the UA half, then recapitalized the whole company with $180 million
of his own money.
   All or part of the company that made Oscar nominees ``Rain
Man,'' and ``A Fish Called Wanda'' is officially up for sale now,
but most observers expect Kerkorian would try to structure a deal
that lets him keep a piece of MGM-UA.
   Another Kerkorian-controlled company, MGM Grand Inc., combines
two of Kerkorian's longtime interests: airplanes and Las Vegas
casino-hotels. The company, which reported a $6.2 million profit in
1988, owns the Desert Inn and Sands and runs a three-plane,
all-luxury airline between Los Angeles and New York, featuring
Boeing 727s adorned with a version of the MGM movie lion.
   Kerkorian, who was born to Armenian immigrants in Fresno,
ferried planes to Britain for the Army during World War II.
   In 1947, he started the nation's first non-scheduled air
service, linking Los Angeles and Las Vegas. In a pattern typical of
his later business dealings, he sold Trans International Airlines,
bought it back and then sold it again in 1968, eventually making
more than $100 million.
   The Eastern rumors would put Kerkorian in a situation similar to
his last flirtation with a big airline. That was in 1987, when Pan
American World Airways unions offered $230 million in wage
concessions if Kerkorian could buy the airline from parent Pan Am
Corp.
   Pan Am rejected Kerkorian's offer to pay $75 million cash and
assemble $400 million in junk bond financing and assume the
airline's $1 billion in debt.
   Kerkorian began assembling his present empire in 1968 with the
profit from the Trans International deal. He bought the Flamingo
Hotel in Las Vegas, built the International Hotel &amp; Casino and
bought 31 percent of Western Airlines and 48 percent of MGM.
   It is MGM that has served as base for most of his later dealings.
   He split the company into separate casino and movie operations,
combining the movie business with UA in a series of transactions.
Those included one with Ted Turner that, in effect, gave the
Atlanta media entrepreneur MGM's 3,000-title movie library for $1.5
billion.
