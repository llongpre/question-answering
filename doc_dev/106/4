   A student pilot who witnessed an
airplane crash that killed five people said the aircraft's lone
engine appeared to stall moments before it plunged nose first into
the ground.
   ``All I saw was a puff of smoke,'' said Walter Ramazzini Jr.,
17, who was sitting about 100 yards from the ditch where the plane
crashed on the outskirts of Albuquerque.
   ``He was going east, making a left turn from the airport,''
Ramazzini said. ``A gust of wind hit him from right to left.''
   Police Sgt. R.C. Porter said it was raining when the plane
crashed Tuesday afternoon several miles south of Coronado Airport.
   The pilot of the six-seat Cessna P210 aborted his first landing
attempt and was coming in for a second try when it crashed, Porter
said.
   State police identified the victims as Gary Brown, 31, his wife,
Melissa, 26, and their 2-year-old daughter, Lindsey, all of
Albuquerque; and his parents, Wayne Brown, 60, and Joyce Brown, 58,
of Salt Lake City.
   The National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal
Aviation Administration were investigating the crash.
   After the wind hit the plane, the pilot appeared to try to
straighten out the craft, Ramazzini said
   ``The wind made him bank to the left 30 degrees or so. To
correct for that, he banked right and he kept going and passed
level flight as if to turn right,'' Ramazzini said.
   ``To correct again for that, he went again to the left ... and
went nose-first into the ground,'' said Ramazzini. ``He hit the
ground and cartwheeled over. It seemed like the engine stalled.''
   The airplane ``wasn't very high _ maybe 100 feet,'' Ramazzini
said.
   Three fire trucks sent to the scene sprayed the crumpled
airplane with water and rescue crews removed bodies from the craft,
authorities said.
