   Folks around Fairgrounds Park who
thought they saw a lawn mower flying overhead weren't hallucinating.
   Not only did Clarksville inventor Freddie Roberts fly the remote
control lawn mower for several minutes in the park, he even made it
fly loops, turns and upside-down.
   ``I made it for fun and to silence a few critics who think I'm
crazy, including my wife,'' Roberts, 44, said Monday.
   ``Who says a lawn mower can't fly? This one can fly but it can't
cut grass ... unless we have a crash landing.''
   The flying mower, made of balsa wood and Styrofoam, weighs less
than 5 pounds and is equipped with a model airplane engine. It is
guided by a model-airplane radio remote control.
   Roberts, a model airplane enthusiast for 30 years, also flies
gyrocopters, ultra-lights and is getting his pilot's license.
   ``I plan to build a (remote control) flying Santa Claus and
sleigh with reindeer for Christmas,'' he said.

   A head start and a filibuster couldn't
stop City Council's meeting this week from becoming Durango's
fastest council meeting ever _ 11 minutes.
   The previous record of 12 minutes was set in 1984, when Bill
Casey was mayor.
   Casey, still a member of the council, tried a good-natured
filibuster Tuesday to protect his place in the record book, but
other council members cut him off by voting to call the question on
the one item on the agenda.
   Mayor Greg Bell banged the gavel to end the meeting at 7:40 p.m.
The meeting started at 7:29 p.m., a minute early.

   When Alfred Wilhelm traveled from Germany
to Oshkosh in search of his roots, he never expected to hit paydirt
in a cemetery by meeting one of his living relatives there.
   The 38-year-old Bavarian was diligently copying birth and death
dates from headstones in the Riverside Cemetery last year when
Wilhelm Mauritz walked by.
   Mauritz, 84, was born in a farmhouse near the German-Austrian
border in 1904. His father, Joseph, wrote to three uncles living in
Oshkosh and asked them to sponsor their voyage to America. They
complied, and the Mauritz family came to America in 1905 on the
steamship Pennsylvania.
   But Mauritz's father did not forget his German relatives,
keeping in touch with them through letters and photographs. The
letters and photographs came back to his son via Wilhelm.
   The two first met last year when Mauritz struck up a
conversation with Wilhelm at the cemetery. Wilhelm explained he was
from Munich, researching his family history and then brought out a
photograph _ a copy of the same picture Mauritz had at home.
   The woman in the photograph was Katharina Drachsler, Wilhelm's
great-great-grandmother. She was also a great-aunt to Mauritz'
first wife, Rosa.
   ``That took me by surprise when he took that picture out and
says, `Where is this lady buried?''' Mauritz recalled.
   Wilhelm, who is on a second visit here, said he started tracing
his family history 10 years ago. ``My grandpa also searched for
family and I followed him,'' he said.
