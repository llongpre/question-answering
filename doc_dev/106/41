Record Watch: The team that guided the light plane Voyager on a globe-circling 
flight is preparing to break the 528.33-m.p.h. speed record for piston-driven 
airplanes. The twin-engine Pond Racer will have its first test flight in 
mid-October in Mojave. In 1986, plane designer Burt Rutan's Voyager made the 
first nonstop, unrefueled flight around the world with Rutan's brother Dick and 
pilot Jeana Yeager aboard.

Poems in the Key of Life: Barbara Sigmund, daughter of Rep. Lindy Boggs (D-La.) 
and the late congressman Hale Boggs, is fighting personal tragedy by publishing 
a book of poetry and prose called "An Unfinished Life: Diary of a Fatal Illness 
and Other Works." Cancer cost Sigmund her left eye eight years ago, and has 
reappeared behind her right eye. Sigmund, 51, is known for her wit and her 
trademark fashion-coordinated eye patch. She upheld the Boggs political 
tradition by serving as mayor of Princeton and running for governor of New 
Jersey, which she lost.
