<TEXT>
<P>
A Riverside County man concluded history's first coast-to-coast flight in a 
solar-powered airplane here Tuesday, abandoning plans to fly nine more miles to 
his original destination because of high winds. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Raymond, 33, said winds gusting up to 35 m.p.h. persuaded him to scrub the 
last leg of his journey and instead take his plane by trailer to historic Kill 
Devil Hills, the sand dunes near Kitty Hawk where Orville and Wilbur Wright 
pioneered engine-powered aviation 87 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I landed basically at the beach yesterday," Raymond said Tuesday, one month 
and two days after his transcontinental trek began in the California desert. 
"With the forecast for winds and storms, it doesn't look like it is worth 
flying the last nine miles." 
</P>
<P>
Including Monday's 32-mile flight to Spot, where a storm forced him to land on 
a farmer's turf field, Raymond logged 2,467 miles during 119 hours and 23 
minutes in the air. 
</P>
<P>
Those unofficial figures easily make Raymond -- a national hang-gliding 
champion from Lake Elsinore -- a world record holder in solar-powered aviation. 
The longest previous flight -- in a craft designed by Paul MacCready of 
Pasadena -- was across the English Channel in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond, a lithe, bespectacled fellow, said he is not interested in records or 
recognition. He said his mission was to enlighten people about the potential of 
traveling with the help of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
"Solar is already quite practical for sporting aircraft," said Raymond, who 
built his 195-pound plane called Sun-Seeker, which resembles a giant dragonfly, 
in his garage. "Eventually, if the technology keeps improving . . . you will 
start seeing bigger and bigger and faster airplanes that are solar-powered." 
</P>
<P>
Crowds of tourists, reporters and local aviators gathered at historic Kill 
Devil Hills on Monday and Tuesday, anticipating the pilot's arrival. Some were 
disappointed when they learned Sun-Seeker would not be landing amid the 
rippling sea oats surrounding First Flight Airport, but most seemed impressed 
by Raymond's feat. 
</P>
<P>
"What Eric has done is an example of creative engineering," said Gene 
O'Bleness, executive director of the First Flight Society, a group of pilots 
and aviation history buffs. His group, along with the Kitty Hawk Kites, held a 
cake-and-champagne reception for Raymond on Tuesday night and presented him 
with a leather bomber jacket with "Sun-Seeker" embroidered on the back. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond's journey began in the desert east of Palm Springs on July 16. Two days 
later, Sun-Seeker -- which uses solar cells to power an electric motor used 
during takeoffs and landings -- was damaged in Lordsburg, N.M., forcing the 
crew to return to Lake Elsinore for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
The flight recommenced Aug. 2, and Raymond hoped to reach Kitty Hawk in 10 
days. Poor flying conditions -- ranging from thunderstorms to head winds that 
at times blew the feather-light craft backward -- slowed the pilot's progress. 
The plane was grounded by foul weather on 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the thrill of the journey, with its potpourri of sights and encounters, 
overshadowed frustrations caused by the sluggish pace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to fly across the country," Raymond said, recalling how the panorama 
changed gradually from desert to woods to farmland and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to avoid big cities with crowded skies, Raymond plotted a southerly 
course that took him through some of America's most lonely reaches. Among the 
crew's nighttime stopovers were such places as Cornudas, Tex., Chanute, Kan., 
Sedalia, Mo., and West Liberty, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
The townsfolk and airport operators, Raymond said, were wonderfully hospitable. 
In Littlefield, Tex., the ground crew following Raymond accidentally wrecked 
the trailer needed to haul Sun-Seeker back to California. The local Chamber of 
Commerce president sent a team of mechanics to help out. 
</P>
<P>
"We were thinking, 'Oh boy, what is this going to cost?' " recalled Raymond's 
wife, Aida, who followed her husband across the country in a chase plane. The 
local official, a glider pilot, refused to accept any money for the work. 
</P>
<P>
After resuming the trip, stiff winds and weak thermals -- the updrafts of warm 
air that lift Sun-Seeker to soaring altitude -- forced back-to-back landings in 
grassy fields in Missouri. The plane, made mostly of carbon fiber, suffered 
only minor damage to one wing that struck a bush. 
</P>
<P>
Raymond spent the long hours in his tiny cockpit -- which measures only 21 
inches wide -- reading maps, lunching on the fruit and cookies his wife packed 
each day and maneuvering his craft in the wind. The only discomfort was the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an air vent, but I close it when I'm trying to make the most distance," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
A sportsman at heart, Raymond took advantage of the fierce winds Tuesday and 
went sail boarding. After returning home, he plans to start on his next 
project: a solar-powered dirigible capable of flying around the world. 
</P>
<P>
Warren reported from Riverside and Stanley reported from North Carolina.
