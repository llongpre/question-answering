   A bird in the engine of a United Airlines jet forced the pilot
to make an unscheduled landing in Chicago on Thursday, and a
Northwest Airlines plane developed engine trouble and had to return
to Detroit, officials said.
   In New Jersey, a Continental Airlines 727 returned to Newark
International Airport after a faulty cockpit indicator alerted the
pilot to engine power failure, and a Navy helicopter developed
engine trouble and was forced to land in the Atlantic Ocean about
10 miles off Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.
   No injuries were reported in any of the incidents.
   The slew of mishaps came one day after the fiery crash of United
Flight 232. At least 76 people were killed, and up to 43 others
were missing and believed dead.
   In Chicago, the DC-10 en route from New York to San Francisco
made an unscheduled landing at O'Hare International Airport after
at least one bird was sucked into one of the engines.
   The 265 passengers and 10 crew members on Flight 23 were later
transferred to another airplane and continued their flight, United
spokesman Russell Mack said.
   ``The airplane was leaving JFK Airport, was climbing out after
takeoff, when either a bird or several birds were ingested into the
No. 1 engine, which is on the left side of the airplane,'' Mack
said.
   ``The engine experienced some vibration and the captain shut the
engine down, and then proceeded to ... O'Hare ... where he landed
normally and safely.''
   Earlier in the day, one of the three engines on the Northwest
Airlines Boeing 727 developed a compressor problem, and the pilot
returned the jet to Detroit Metropolitan Airport, said Bob Gibbons,
spokesman for the Eagan, Minn.-based airline.
   ``We had the emergency equipment standing by as a precaution,''
he said.
   Flight 492 was carrying 146 passengers from Detroit to New York
City, who were transferred to another aircraft.
   In Newark, the Continental Airlines 727 made a precautionary
return after a faulty cockpit indicator alerted the pilot to engine
power failure.
   Continental Flight 850, with 137 passengers and six crew
members, left Newark about 11 a.m. destined for Bermuda, said Dave
Messing, a spokesman for Houston-based Continental Airlines.
   ``There was no loss of power in the engine,'' Messing said.
``The indication turned out to be faulty.''
   The faulty indicator was replaced and the plane took off again
at 4:40 p.m., Messing said.
   In Florida, the pilot of the SH-3 Sea King helicopter, Lt. Henry
G. Bridgham, 30, of Monterey, Calif., had to use the aircraft's
other engine to taxi the amphibious helicopter ashore, said Nick
Young, a Navy spokesman.
