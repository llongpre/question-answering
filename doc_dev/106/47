<F P=106> [Article by Major Vadim Kinshin: "Advanced Maneuverability </F>
Fighter"] 
  [Text] Interest in raising the maneuvering 
characteristics of warplanes persists abroad. The military 
departments of the USA and Germany are conducting joint research 
on a number of aviation programs for the future. A program to 
design a tactical fighter with advanced maneuverability (EFM) 
occupies a special place. Series X airplanes are the first 
experimental models. 
  A joint international simulation exercise was carried out in 
1985 to evaluate the influence of maneuvering qualities on a 
fighter's combat effectiveness, especially in close combat. 
  Research was conducted within the program with regard for 
present trends in combat use of fighter aviation and air defense 
resources. This is associated with the fact that significant 
changes occurred in the last 10 years in the homing heads of all 
types of missiles. The sensitivity of homing heads and their 
scanning angles were subjected to modernization primarily. 
Requirements on the tactics of aerial combat, especially close 
combat, have risen: The modern fighter must have "tactical 
freedom"--that is, it must maintain its advantages until the 
absolute end of combat. However, for the time being we can 
observe a different picture--more than half of the "one on one" 
contests end in mutually observed missile launchings, or in 
other words, the potential destruction of one another. 
  In the opinion of foreign military specialists high-speed 
flight remains the best means of defense, because the commonly 
accepted trends in development and use of fighters have 
"wallowed at low speeds." Experts feel that it is only 
theoretically that a decrease in speed makes it possible to 
change a fighter's trajectory or maneuvering mode. In fact, an 
airplane's inertia does not change when it carries out maneuvers 
at high angles of attack, while its aerodynamic control becomes 
weak. As a result the possibilities for completing a maneuver 
quickly are limited. 
  Foreign specialists see passive inertial flight at a speed 
of 
around Mach 0.9 in particular sections of the trajectory to be 
one of the solutions to this problem. This approach makes it 
possible for a fighter to reduce flying distance while 
maneuvering, and to complete maneuvers faster. Forestalling the 
opponent in this fashion, the airplane can assume a more 
advantageous position for effective use of onboard weapons. Its 
kill capability will increase due to reduction of firing range.

  Two X-31A fighters were the first models of aircraft of this 
type. The airplane's configuration recalls that of the F-18 
fighter. The X-31A has a swept-back fuselage with flat side 
walls, low wings and a vertical tail fin welded to the fuselage. 
The engine's air intake has a movable lower edge, and it is 
located beneath the fuselage. According to design calculations 
this is the variant that permits the fighter to operate in 
optimum fashion at large angles of attack. Forward horizontal 
control surfaces--for pitch control and balancing of the craft's 
airframe--may be said to be yet another unique feature of the 
airplane's design. 
  The flight control devices of the X-31A are of the 
conventional variety. Presence of a group of three large vanes 
mounted near the jet engine nozzle is an identifying structural 
feature. They are intended for fast and precise deflection of 
the main direction of the jet stream by changing part of its 
flow in the needed direction. In this case the vanes keep the 
engine's thrust factor at its maximum. They are capable of 
increasing the total deflection of the main exhaust flow by more 
than 10 degrees, which makes it possible to obtain up to 17 
percent additional thrust energy in any selected direction. 
Consequently the pilot may quickly change flight direction, and 
maneuver without resorting to the assistance of conventional 
control devices.

  The wing structure is of certain interest. The wings are 
flexed in the vertical plane, and they narrow at the tips. Good 
aerodynamic qualities of the wings, especially at large angles 
of attack both at sub- and supersonic speeds, have been noted on 
several occasions in tests. The flat side walls of the fuselage 
made it possible to achieve reasonable characteristics during 
slip. 
  On the basis of maneuverability requirements the X-31A has a 
"load ratio" (the ratio of a loaded engine to thrust) of not 
less than 1:1. In addition the aircraft may be flown on the 
basis of flight control system data, while the layout of the 
fighter makes it possible to utilize full engine power even at 
angles of attack of 70 degrees. The high maneuvering qualities 
of the airplane are associated with presence of forward control 
surfaces. Tests showed that at large angles of attack in 
subsonic flight, a critical moment arises at which the center of 
gravity shifts toward the tail or nose of the fighter--it 
becomes unstable, and can spontaneously stall. It is to preclude 
this that the forward control surfaces are used. 
  Research conducted under the program revealed that owing to 
its advanced maneuverability, the X-31A can quickly assume a 
stable position while performing any dangerous maneuver, upon 
entering into a protracted stall, when the engine fails, or when 
the thrust control system breaks down. This is how higher flight 
safety of the X-31A in comparison with other fighters is 
accomplished. 
  There is one unique feature of the fighter's control: Flight 
control is linked to engine thrust control. Consequently the 
principal means of flight control is automatic, using the flight 
control system.

  Certain changes were made in the controls and displays in 
connection with the fighter's new possibilities. There is an 
additional switch on the joystick allowing the pilot to cause 
the aircraft to stall or return to ordinary flight. An 
additional piloting mark is projected onto the heads-up display. 
Its purpose is to indicate and warn the pilot of the real 
angular position of the airplane in space and its subsequent 
oblique displacements in the course of stall maneuvers. Tests 
showed that the peculiarities of control of the X-31A favorably 
affect the results of aerial combat, because it is hard for the 
opponent to predict the airplane's trajectory. In addition, 
stalling during combat makes it possible to more than double the 
number of missiles launched, and thus quadruple the fighter's 
firepower. In turn, the combat exchange factor rises by 160 
percent to a ratio of 1:3 in favor of the X-31A. A 15 percent 
increase in the airplane's mobility reduces losses to air 
defense fire by 75 percent. 
  New structural concepts and results of tests on the advanced 
maneuverability fighter encouraged further development of this 
concept. Thus America's Grumman developed a similar fighter, the 
X-29A, with forward-swept wings. Flight tests demonstrated the 
airplane's high maneuvering qualities: At angles of attack of 
25-40 degrees its speed of descent was minimal, and it made a 
complete turn in a radius of 350-400 meters. Control of the 
direction of engine thrust has also been reflected in a fighter 
of a totally different type--the STOVL short take-off and 
landing aircraft. According to reports in the foreign press it 
will have an improved aerodynamic shape and built-in thrust 
control. 
  The concept of advanced maneuverability of tactical fighters 
is now being used abroad as the basis of active efforts to 
design an airplane capable of changing its length while in 
flight.
