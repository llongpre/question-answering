   The total hydraulic failure that sent
United Flight 232 out of control also caused the worst single-plane
disaster in history in 1985, but pilots still don't train for it,
says a former DC-10 flight instructor.
   ``If it had only been partial hydraulic failure, I think he
could have handled it,'' Tom Eanes said of Capt. Al C. Haynes,
pilot of the United DC-10 that crashed last week at Sioux City,
Iowa. The disaster killed 110 of the 296 people aboard.
   ``We train for that. But we don't train for what he faced
because the airplane isn't controllable,'' Eanes, a resident of
Grand Prairie, Texas, said in a telephone interview Saturday.
   ``It's incredible,'' said retired DC-10 flight engineer Joe
Sullivan of Richardson, Texas, who was also interviewed by
telephone. ``I just can't believe it was successful.''
   Eanes said Flight 232's problems were similar to the
catastrophic loss of hydraulic fluid that crippled a Japan Air
Lines Boeing 747 in 1985. In that case, hydraulic lines ruptured
after the aft pressure bulkhead blew out.
   The pilot of the JAL airplane maneuvered for 30 minutes by
varying thrust from different engines before the aircraft crashed
into a mountain, causing the worst single-plane air disaster ever
as 520 people died. Four survived.
   Jack Gamble, Boeing Commercial Airplane spokesman, pointed out a
difference between the two cases.
   ``The JAL pilot was trying to keep altitude because he was over
mountainous terrain. He was trying to turn and get back to an
airport but he was over mountainous terrain. It was quite a long
distance to the airport. In the DC-10 case, he wasn't that far from
an alternate airport.''
   ``He (JAL pilot) did succeed in turning. He was headed back
toward Tokyo when he crashed into the mountain. The problem was he
couldn't keep altitude.''
   United Flight 232's crew, aided by an off-duty pilot who rushed
to the cockpit to help, used differential engine thrust from their
remaining two wing-mounted engines to control the wide-bodied jet
after its tail-mounted engine apparently blew apart and destroyed
the plane's hydraulic system.
   With differential engine thrust, a plane will slowly turn in the
direction of the slower engine.
   Without hydraulic power, the crew could not manipulate control
surfaces on the wings and tail to alter direction, raise or lower
the nose, or extend wing slats and flaps that increase lift during
takeoffs and landings.
   Flight 232's flight engineer told National Transportation Safety
Board investigators that the loss of the plane's hydraulic fluid
was ``immediate,'' giving pilots no time adjust those control
surfaces.
   But the crew managed to guide the airplane to a crash landing at
Sioux Gateway Airport in Sioux City, where emergency equipment and
medics were waiting. The crash killed 110 but 186 others survived,
including the flight crew.
   Eanes said the United crew faced an additional problem.
   The damaged tail section assymmetrical drag _ that is, given
equal power to both remaining engines, the plane still turned to
the right. To counter that, he said, pilots had to overcompensate
with the right wing engine.
   That made the landing attempt even more difficult, he said.
   ``There's a certain point where you have to come off the power
to get on the ground. He obviously had to carry more power in one
engine than the other to overcome asymmetrical drag,'' he said.
   Eanes, who continues to fly for a commercial airline company
that he asked not be identified, noted that without control over
the wing slats and flaps, Flight 232's crew was forced to approach
the landing at least 80 mph faster than normal so the wings
wouldn't lose lift.
   ``How they ever got down to a reasonable height to even attempt
a landing is beyond my comprehension,'' said Sullivan.
