   A Southwest Airlines passenger jetliner
made an unscheduled landing at Albuquerque International Airport
after one of its two engines was shut down in flight, officials
said.
   The 737 with 124 passengers aboard landed without incident at
about 8:30 p.m. Monday, said Ann Genett-Schrader, Southwest
Airlines' manager of public relations in Dallas.
   ``There was a compressor problem with the (right) engine and it
was really very minor,'' she said Tuesday.
   The company's flight 362 originated in Lubbock, Texas, and
stopped in Albuquerque about 7:20 p.m., officials said. The
airplane took off from Albuquerque at 7:40 p.m. bound for Los
Angeles.
   But when the compressor problem occurred, the pilot shut down
the engine and returned the craft to Albuquerque, Ms.
Genett-Schrader said.
   The passengers continued to their destination on another flight.
