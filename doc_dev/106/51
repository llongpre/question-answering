  [Text] The Brazilian Government has donated 15 
Brazilian-made primary training airplanes to the Bolivian Air 
Force. The Brazilian Aeronautics Ministry considers the 
refurbishing cost of these airplanes, which are poorly 
maintained, very high. "They are as worn out as a driving school 
Volkswagen Beetle," an Aeronautics officer said. These 
airplanes, also called [Aerotec T-23] Uirapuru, were used to 
train Aeronautics cadets in their first year of pilots school.
