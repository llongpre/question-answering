  [Text] Xian, February 24 (XINHUA) -- The problem of a 
stalling spiral, which had been taboo in test flights and flight 
training for the Chinese Air Forces, was recently tackled by 
37-year-old Lu Jun, a test flight pilot of the Aviation 
Industries of China. 
  Lu's success filled a blank page in the history of the 
Chinese aviation industry, according to experts of the Test 
Flight Research Institute of China. 
  When a stalling spiral happens, an airplane stalls in 
mid-air 
and drops spinning at an accelerating speed, which leads to a 
crash. 
  For decades, the test has not been tried on advanced 
Chinese-made fighters. But Lu Jun took on the task last 
December, and succeeded in 78 stalling spirals during 21 flights 
in a new type of Chinese-made airplane at an altitude of 11,000 
m. 
  Lu has test-flown airplanes of ten models in three kinds in 
the past.
