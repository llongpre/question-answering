A student pilot and his instructor walked away unhurt Monday after their 
single-engine airplane lost power at 400 feet and crashed-landed on a street 
minutes after takeoff from Fullerton Municipal Airport. No one on the ground 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, John Otey, 30, of Anaheim, was flying the Piper Warrior II for an 
instrument rating license, police said. He had 200 hours of flying time. Both 
the plane and the instructor, Mike Simmon, 21, of Norwalk, are with Aviation 
Facilities Inc. of Fullerton, Buena Park Police Officer Rich McMillen said. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton Airport Director Rod Murphy said he watched the aircraft from his 
office as it took off at 2:30 p.m., then suddenly crash-landed. 
</P>
<P>
"The airplane was operating normally on its departure and had an engine 
failure," Murphy said. "The pilot maneuvered to miss houses and buildings and 
aimed for the clear area." 
</P>
<P>
The plane glided over a vacant field about a quarter of a mile west of the 
runway as it dropped, according to witnesses at the scene. The plane's 
propeller sliced a power line as the gray Piper smashed into the ground, 
missing a home by about 50 feet and plowing through a white picket fence. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft then spun sideways across Artesia Boulevard, coming to rest before 
the Buena Park Business Center, half a block west of Dale Street. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw the wire come down first thing," said Choong Nam, whose office is 
situated just a sidewalk's width from the wrecked airplane. "Suddenly I saw the 
back of the crashed airplane. Then two men came out. I can't explain to you how 
scary it was." 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the Piper's engine failure was unknown, and the crash is under 
investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration and the National 
Transportation Safety Board, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Otey, the pilot, and his instructor were being questioned Monday afternoon by 
the FAA and declined to speak with reporters, said a woman who answered the 
telephone at Aviation Facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Otey received praise from several quarters Monday for his maneuvering of the 
stricken airplane away from houses and buildings and onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say the pilot did one hell of a job," said one crash witness, who declined 
to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
"I hear the pilot did good work bringing the plane down," said City Councilman 
Don Bankhead, a retired Fullerton police captain elected to the council last 
November, who has opposed any airport expansion or jet landings for noise and 
safety reasons. "It's very fortunate that they walked away from it." 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the Piper Warrior appeared moderate. The nose cowling was crumpled 
and the severed power line was wrapped around the propeller. The landing gear 
also had crumpled, apparently on impact. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Other Crashes 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton Airport has been the site of several crashes in its 63-year 
history, the most recent on Sept. 20, when a Piper Cherokee 6 crashed into an 
industrial park on approach to the airfield. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger in that plane was seriously injured, suffering a broken pelvis. The 
pilot, a part-time flight instructor, suffered moderate injuries. 
</P>
<P>
On Oct. 17, 1987, the pilot of a Piper Cherokee Arrow lost control of his plane 
and struck a Buena Park apartment complex. No one else was injured but the 
pilot was killed. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1986, popular radio traffic announcer Bruce Wayne died when his Cessna 
Cardinal went down shortly after takeoff from the airport. Five months later, a 
plane crashed in the yard of an elementary school on Fern Drive, just 30 
minutes after classes ended. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
These and other crashes have sparked residents' opposition to the airport's 
operations in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
City officials have pointed out over the years that the airport was built long 
before the the neighborhood became a residential area and that those who moved 
there did so knowingly and at their own risk. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the facility's past, airport director Murphy said Monday that no 
one has ever been killed on the ground by a crashing airplane. And for an 
airport with 170,000 takeoffs and landings a year, he said, its safety record 
is sound. 
</P>
<P>
Controversy over the airport has diminished following the defeat of a 1986 
referendum that would have banned jets from landing at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been lucky we haven't had more serious injuries and fatalities," said 
Carl Stevenson, one of the organizers behind the failed referendum. "Obviously 
people are worried, concerned about planes flying over houses and businesses. 
The airport is tucked away in a densely populated area." 
</P>
<P>
But Stevenson added that he does not oppose the airport's continued operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I know everybody who flies out of the airport is concerned about maintenance," 
he said. "I don't mean to imply that anyone is slipshod here. But things break, 
no matter how good everyone's efforts are." 
</P>
<P>
Ellen Fortney said she is just happy that the Piper Warrior missed her house, 
never mind the picket fence knocked down in her front yard. 
</P>
<P>
Fortney said she was on her way home from work when she saw a helicopter 
hovering over her house, leading her to worry that something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Standing in front of her home, Fortney said a few other planes have landed in 
the field behind her since she moved in 8 years ago. "But this is actually the 
closest one that's ever come down." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the airport doesn't really bother her, Fortney said. Looking across 
the street at the ungainly Piper, resting awkwardly on its broken legs, she 
said of the two men who escaped injury, "I'm just glad they're all OK."
