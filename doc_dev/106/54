<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Ron Burda -- Mercury News; REAL CLASS -- When this Junkers JU-52
carried passengers in the 1930s, there was nothing but first class. That's how
VIPs flew Friday when it took them for a ride out of San Jose International
Airport. The trimotor is on a Lufthansa tour to observe 35 years of air
service between Germany and the United States.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  Among the sleek jetliners at San Jose International Airport, the old silver
and black airplane with big, broad wings,  wrinkled skin and three of the
world's noisiest propeller engines looked a bit out of place.;    But inside
its passenger compartment, the Junkers JU-52 is definitely an airliner --
1930s style, when flight was all first class.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The seats are brown leather, the ceiling is covered in beige felt and there
are curtains instead of plastic shades on the wide windows. Nearly everyone on
board has a great view.;    As light-plane pilots and jetliner captains alike
gawked at the sight, the 55-year-old German transport plane gathered speed
down the runway with an ear-splitting exhaust roar. At a mere 75 mph, it
lifted off into the hazy skies of the Santa Clara Valley on Friday morning.;  
 The three men at the controls usually drive jumbo jets for Lufthansa German
Airlines, which sent the restored antique on a six-month tour of the United
States to mark the 35th anniversary of its air service between this country
and Germany.;    "I like old-timers," says Walter Eichorn, chief pilot on the
JU-52, which Lufthansa has named "Berlin-Tempelhof.";    "All my life, I've
played with old airplanes -- the older the better," says Eichorn, who, like
the other pilots of the JU-52 crew, gave up part of his vacation time for two
to three weeks of duty flying on the U.S. tour.;    Eichorn, 54, has been a
Lufthansa pilot for 25 years, the past four as captain on a DC-10 jetliner.
Although the JU-52 also is an airliner, there's a world of difference at the
controls.;    "It's all muscle flying. There's no automatic pilot, nothing.
You just got to fly it and fight it all the way," Eichorn says.;    "If it's a
calm day, no problem. But if it's bumpy, you are working. You're bouncing all
over the place. When it gets upset, it does not straighten itself out like
modern aircraft.";    On Friday, the air was smooth, and the JU-52 cruised at
110 mph up in the morning sun a couple thousand feet above the veil of haze
and fog that hung over the Santa Clara Valley. It can fly faster, but there
was no reason, because the plane wasn't going anywhere.;    "You're flying
low, you're flying slow, relatively close to the ground," Eichorn says. "You
can see the people wave at you, you can almost recognize them. I get a kick
out of that. It's great.";    Filling the 16 passenger seats were some invited
guests of Lufthansa -- travel agents, city officials, news media -- on a
leisurely flight.;    The JU-52 is a strange-looking aircraft. The skin on its
96-foot-span wings and 62-foot-long fuselage is corrugated metal, for
strength. An engine is mounted on each wing, and the third is on the nose in
front of the cockpit. The landing gear doesn't retract during flight.;   
Nearly 5,000 JU-52s were made by the Junkers company and its subsidiary
between 1932 and 1952, but only a handful still fly.  </TEXT>
