   The advanced-technology Boeing 747-400, featuring
a two-person crew and distinctive winglets, has been certified for
use with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, Boeing Commercial Airplanes
announced Wednesday.
   The Federal Aviation Administration issued its approval Tuesday,
Boeing said in a statement, clearing the way for deliveries to
customer airlines.
   The aircraft, which in various configurations will seat
approximately 420 passengers, is due to be certified early this
spring for use with General Electric and Rolls-Royce engines.
   The flight test program for approval of the newest Boeing
jetliner has taken 8{ months and has focused on differences between
the 747-400 and earlier models of the jumbo jet, Boeing's Elizabeth
Reese said.
   Differences include a digital flight deck and avionic system plus
aerodynamic features such as increased wingspan and the winglets at
the wing tips.
   The flight deck is simplified and equipped for two crew members,
instead of the three-crew flight deck on other 747s.
   Boeing said the flight test program so far has required 2,600
hours of intensive testing, half of that in the air. Flight rates of
70 to 80 hours per month per airplane have been achieved, said the
company, one of the highest rates attained on such a program for
Boeing.
   Four planes have been used during the program, to certify the
three engines. Boeing said it is the first time it has attempted to
certify three different engine types in a single flight test program.
   Northwest Airlines selected P&amp;W4000 engines for its 747-400s when
it ordered 10 of the the aircraft on Oct. 22, 1985.
   Lufthansa ordered 12 747-400s delivered with GE CF6-80C2 engines
while Cathay Pacific has ordered two airplanes with Rolls-Royce
RB211-524G engines.
   So far, 21 customers worldwide have ordered 166 of the long-range
jetliners.
