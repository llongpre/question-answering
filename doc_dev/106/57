   The crew of a Colombian jetliner warned
controllers repeatedly they wer running out of fuel before the
Boeing 707 crashed on its second approach to Kennedy Airport,
killing 72 people, investigators said Friday.
   Avianca Airlines Flight 52 from Bogota had been delayed by air
traffic and appeared to have barely enough fuel to land before it
slashed into a suburban hillside Thursday night, officials said.
The jet may have lost power in three of its four engines before it
went down.
   The plane's crew, however, never declared an emergency or
requested an emergency landing priority, Lee Dickinson, spokesman
for the National Transportation Safety Board, said at a Friday
evening news conference.
   Eighty-nine people survived the crash and 72 died, including the
entire nine-member crew except for the chief steward, Dickinson
said. Only nine victims had been positively identified, he said.
The Boeing 707 carried 152 passengers.
   Hospital officials said at least 25 of the injured were in
serious or critical condition, and more than two dozen children
were among the injured.
   Some of the children were being adopted by American parents and
were making their first trips to their new homes.
   Investigators picking through the wreckage of the jet in the
woods of this isolated, wealthy suburb found gauges indicating it
had 10,000 pounds of fuel left, Dickinson said. That corresponds to
about 6 percent of the plane's capacity. Investigators had not
checked the actual tanks, he said.
   After aborting their first attempt at landing, the cockpit crew
told the control tower repeatedly that ``they were running out of
fuel or that they were low on fuel,'' Dickinson said.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Jack Gamble
said the 10,000 pounds would have been roughly the amount the jet
needed to get to the airport, ``but not much more.''
   Gamble said 10,000 pounds equals about 1,500 gallons, ``enough
to land an airplane when it's three to five minutes out'' from the
field and the plane is in a normal landing configuration. A 707 can
carry up to 23,855 gallons.
   Three to five minutes flight time equals about 17 miles in a
landing configuration, Gamble said. The Avianca jetliner, nearing
the end of a 2,400-mile flight, crashed about 15 miles northeast of
the airport.
   Dickinson said investigators flew over the site early Friday and
determined the wreckage was on course for another Kennedy approach.
In addition, the landing gear was up and the flaps were ``somewhere
between fully extended and retracted ... indicating that the
airplane was in some phase of approach,'' he said.
   Before the crash, the plane was put in a holding pattern over
Norfolk, Va., and New Jersey for 75 minutes, NBC News reported.
Dickinson and an FAA spokeswoman said they could not confirm that.
   When it finally reached Kennedy International Airport, the
jetliner was forced to abort an initial landing in fog and rain
because of warnings that it was ``sinking too fast'' _ descending
too quickly and at the wrong angle, Dickinson said.
   It was making a second approach shortly after 9:30 p.m. when the
crew reported to the airport tower that it was having trouble with
its number two engine. The crew then reported two engines out, and
shortly thereafter the jet disappeared from the radar screens,
Dickinson said.
   Prior to the first landing attempt, the pilot, Laureano
Caviedes, told passengers that because of heavy air traffic at JFK,
the plane would have to circle for 20 minutes, according to
statements by one witness.
   ``But the plane spent more than an hour circling in high winds,
heavy rain and incredible air pockets,'' said Marisol Velasco, a
Colombian residing in New York City, in an telephone interview with
Caracol, a Colombian radio network.
   ``The plane rose and fell, and nobody had told us anything when
suddenly the lights went out. The plane descended and we felt the
biggest impact in the world,'' he said.
   Earlier in the day, a source close to the investigation who
spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that
authorities had compiled evidence indicating the plane may have run
out of fuel. There was no fire on impact, and the landing was a
low-impact, low-speed crash, suggesting that the plane glided to
the ground. Also, there was no fuel smell, and the nose, wings and
body came down level instead of thrusting forward, as they would
have if the engines were running.
   In addition, witnesses said there was no explosion when the
jetliner crumpled into several pieces in the woods.
   Dickinson also said there were indications that three engines
were not working when the plane crashed. The fourth engine, buried
in mud at the crash site, has not yet been inspected.
   The Colombian radio network RCN reported that the 23-year-old
plane had been plagued by mechanical problems recently, having been
sent to the maintenance shop 37 times in the past four months. The
radio didn't say what the maintenance was for.
   An Avianca spokeswoman in Colombia identified the cockpit crew:
pilot Laureano Caviedes, 52, who had flown for the airline since
1962; copilot Mauricio Klotz, 27, with the company 3{ years, and
flight engineer Matias Moyano Rojas, 44, a 24-year Avianca veteran.
   One of those injured, a 30-year-old man, was found by doctors to
have four condoms packed with a white powder they speculated was
cocaine in his intestines.
