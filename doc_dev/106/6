   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Two engineers, convinced that a Connecticut
inventor beat the Wright brothers into the air by more than two
years, have drawn up blueprints for an engine they believe is
almost identical to the ones that powered that first flight. The
next step, they hope, is to build working replicas of the engines
in an attempt to prove that Gustave Whitehead may have been cheated
out of his proper place in history.

   Speaking with the passion of a television
preacher, Wes Gordeuk got down on his knees and carefully unrolled
a sheaf of documents containing the long-lost secrets of an early
American inventor.
   When he had finished, Gordeuk leaned back and smiled.
   Spread across the carpet on his living room floor were the
blueprints for an engine that Gordeuk believes was used to power
the first airplane flight in the United States.
   ``There's a hell of a lot of detail here,'' he says.
   Gordeuk, an engineer and jet engine instructor at Pratt &amp;
Whitney, and Don Richardson, a former electrical engineering
professor from Stratford, spent more than two years investigating
the engine and drafting the blueprint. They are now putting the
finishing touches on the blueprint and some day hope to build
engines based on the plans.
   The two are part of a team attempting to prove that Gustave
Whitehead made the first powered airplane flight in history on Aug.
14, 1901, more than two years before the Wright brothers flew in
North Carolina. Whitehead allegedly soared 50 feet above the ground
for a distance of about a half-mile at Bridgeport.
   Whitehead apparently did nothing to record his flight for future
historians. There was mention of the flight in a local Bridgeport
newspaper a few days after it reportedly occurred, and the flight
also was mentioned in Scientific American magazine. But there were
no photographs, workbooks, or other ironclad documentation.
   Even the airplane and engines allegedly used didn't survive.
Whitehead enthusiasts say that is because, as a tinkerer, Whitehead
constantly disassembled his inventions and re-used parts for other
work.
   The state of Connecticut in 1964 recognized Whitehead as the
``Father of Connecticut Aviation.'' But claims that Whitehead was
the first in the nation to fly have been rejected by many,
including experts at the Smithsonian Institution.
   The Connecticut Legislature adopted a bill in 1986 asking the
Smithsonian to review the matter, but to no avail.
   Undaunted by the skeptics, the Whitehead Research Society has
been working to quiet the opposition. It is building a flying
replica of the plane Whitehead is believed to have flown 88 years
ago. The plane is known as No. 21, an odd-looking, single-wing
machine modeled after a flying fish.
   Three years ago, the group unveiled a full-scale model of No. 21
that was made of the same materials used by Whitehead _ silk,
bamboo and pine. The replica underwent successful tow tests and
tethered lift tests.
   Gordeuk prepared for the tedious work of reconstructing
blueprints for the engines by making two propellers. The
64-year-old Cromwell resident followed Whitehead's notes and
studied photographs of No. 21, then spent 13 months carving the two
6-foot spruce propellers that were finished in 1985.
   To draft the engine blueprints, Gordeuk and Robinson studied
photographs of the engines and reviewed descriptions by Whitehead's
former co-workers. In addition, they studied engineering handbooks
and hardware catalogs from the turn of the century to help with
their detective work.
   ``Knowing engines, you don't even have to see the whole picture,
because even just a part of a picture to an engineer will give the
whole thing away,'' he says.
   ``We found that the hardware available and used by Gustave
Whitehead in 1901 was exactly the same as it is today. The
standards have not changed.''
   Gordeuk had to go to such extremes because Whitehead left behind
no notes on his work. Some believe that his family discarded the
material many years ago. The scant documentation is one reason
Whitehead's accomplishments have been ignored by history.
   ``We've duplicated, we think, within 99 percent of the actual
engines,'' Gordeuk says. ``By no means was it easy.''
   The two engineers discovered that Whitehead built an external
combustion engine that was modeled after a steam engine. It was
fueled by acetylene gas, which at the turn of the century was
readily available and was considered as the fuel of the future.
Gasoline, at that time, was considered too dangerous a fuel to be
used in engines, Gordeuk says.
   Using acetylene, mixed with air, Whitehead developed a unique,
lightweight engine with tremendous power, Gordeuk says. The
double-acting, four-cylinder engines could produce about 10
horsepower a cylinder. Whitehead used one engine per propeller,
giving him more horsepower than the Wrights had on their first
airplane, Gordeuk says.
   ``He was able to take off after a run of 20 to 25 yards,''
Gordeuk says. ``Why was he able to do this? Simply because he had a
third engine driving the front wheels of the airplane.
   ``The first airplane built that could fly and did fly was able
to take off in any wind conditions or still air in the shortest run
that hasn't been duplicated until recent years. Whitehead was a
genius. He was not a liar.''
   Having developed blueprints for the engines, the Whitehead group
has now reached its next obstacle. Gordeuk said the group is in
need of a machine shop to manufacture the engine parts so that
replica engines can be built. The group has not yet found a machine
shop to help.
   ``We are at somewhat of a dead end now,'' Gordeuk says.
   But he is far from disheartened and he is certain that his
engine and No.21 will fly some day.
   ``We're good engineers,'' he says. ``We know it's going to fly.''
   The Smithsonian ignored the Connecticut Legislature's request
and has no plans to conduct hearings into the matter, says Peter
Jakab, the museum's curator of early aviation.
   ``The governor signed a piece of legislation asking us to
convene a public hearing,'' he says. ``It's just not appropriate
for us to participate in that way. We're not an arbitrative body.''
   The curator says the Wrights fully documented their flight and
research, while the case for Whitehead is based on speculation. As
a result, the development of the blueprints for the engines is
interesting, but not historically significant, he said.
   ``While they claim to have developed the engines,'' he says,
``it's impossible to tell.''
