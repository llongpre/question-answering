   President Bush was upgraded to first
class Thursday when a Boeing 747 jumbo jet made its first official
flight as the new Air Force One.
   ``It's marvelous in every way _ the latest in technology and
certainly very, very comfortable,'' Bush said as he stepped aboard
the plane for a quick hop across the country for political rallies
in Topeka, Kan., and Tallahassee, Fla.
   The president planned to be back at the White House Thursday
evening.
   ``It's so much roomier. My heavens,'' Bush said. ``It is
magnificent.''
   Some of the stewards chided reporters not to scuff up the new
airplane.
   ``Be careful those cameras don't scratch the walls,'' one said.
   Congress and the Reagan administration decided in 1986 to spend
a quarter billion dollars on a pair of jumbo jets to replace two
well-preserved but aging Boeing 707s that had flown a total of 5.5
million miles. The delivery was almost two years late.
   For a president who already has logged a record 200,000 miles in
the air in less than 20 months in office, the new jet will allow
Bush to whet his appetite for travel and comfort.
   The comforts range from a shower-equipped presidential lavatory
to an airborne office with a large wooden desk to a fully decked
conference room that could accommodate more than half the Cabinet.
   The seats throughout the jet are first-class size; Bush and his
top staff have large leather reclining chairs.
   There are televisions galore, 85 telephones, the latest in
computers, memory typewriters, a paper shredder, two galleys with
ovens and microwaves and, for the president and first lady, a
spacious private cabin with two couches that convert to twin-size
beds. There's enough freezer space on the plane to store 2,000
meals.
   The White House physician could perform emergency surgery in a
separate medical room.
   The plane has a range of 7,140 miles without refueling _ about
1,400 miles further than the old Air Force One _ and an airborne
refueling capacity that will be used only in emergencies.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it's more
fuel-efficient and quieter than the old Air Force Ones, which
exceeded Federal Aviation Administration noise standards.
   Bush invited reporters _ but not camera crews or photographers _
to glimpse his private suite in the nose of the plane. His private
quarters are decorated in brown and rust tones, with an upholstered
wall mural depicting a rustic sunset.
   Asked if he planned any one-day trips to the Persian Gulf, Bush
quipped: ``Stay tuned. Have plane, will travel.''
   Bush said he checked out the cockpit, but the onetime Navy
fighter pilot said he had no plans to take the controls.
   ``A little sitting there maybe, but I wouldn't understand how to
start this thing,'' Bush said.
   Col. Danny Barr, the Air Force One pilot since 1989, was at the
controls of the new jet.
   The president's first landing in Topeka was bumpier than the
usual smooth setdowns for which Air Force One is famous but the
plane had a smoother landing in Tallahassee.
   Bonnie Newman, the president's assistant for management and
administration, flew several trial runs on the jet, including a
trip last week to Hawaii when she became the first passenger to try
the presidential shower.
   ``It was refreshing,'' she said with a laugh.
   While the contract called for the government to pay $266 million
for the two jumbo jets, the actual cost reportedly ran closer to
$400 million. White House officials say Boeing absorbed much of the
overrun. The second plane is to be delivered next year.
   The new plane has separate cabins for guests, Bush's senior
staff and other aides as well as for his Secret Service contingent
and the press corps that travels with him.
   It seats 70 passengers and 23 crew members, half again as many
as the old plane. It provides room for two additional members of
the media _ a total of 13 reporters, photographers and television
crews.
   The passengers on the maiden flight had nine movies to choose
from, viewed on overhead televisions in each cabin with the sound
provided by individual headsets. Thursday's offerings included
``The Abyss,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' ``Young
Einstein'' and ``Steel Magnolias.''
   The walls of the plane were bare, but officials said photos
would be hung.
   The outside of the jet is decorated in the same colors President
John F. Kennedy chose for the Air Force One put into service in
1962: white and royal blue over a thin gold stripe, with the bottom
and the big cowlings for the engines in robin's egg blue.
   The old Air Force One featured a single narrow center aisle,
where VIPs had to weave their way past flight attendants, Secret
Service agents and the media on their way to the lavatories.
   Flight attendant Becky Schulz said it will be more work running
around the longer two-story plane, but will mean ``a lot less
stress.''
   ``You won't be stepping over people's feet all the time,'' she
said.
