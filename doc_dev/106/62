   Despite recent crashes and two accidents in which
big sections of fuselage have ripped away from airplanes, the Boeing
Co. still gets high marks from airline officials, industry analysts
and safety advocates.
   That Boeing planes have suffered highly publicized problems
lately is a combination of bad luck, the fact that an estimated 65
percent of all commercial airplanes were made by Boeing, and the
fact that planes are just now getting old enough to fail, they say.
   It's a ``pure set of coincidences that we're having this rash of
happenings at this point,'' said Paul Nisbet, aerospace analyst with
Prudential Bache in New York. ``I don't think that the market is
paying an awful lot of attention to these events, because they have
not been tied to any wrongdoing or fault of Boeing.
   ``They have been older airplanes, in many cases, where the
maintenance hasn't been as thorough as perhaps it should have been.''
   Friday's emergency in Hawaii, in which an 18-year-old Boeing 747
lost a large panel from the right side, and nine people were blown
out to their deaths, was the latest in a series of problems that
have dragged Boeing's name across newspaper front pages _ a sharp
contrast to the usual reports about multibillion-dollar orders for
new planes.
   Nearly a year ago, a 737 lost so much of its fuselage near Hawaii
that it resembled a convertible. A stewardess died in that accident.
In December, a 727 was forced to land at Charleston, W.Va., after a
14-inch hole opened in the fuselage at 31,000 feet.
   The first accident led to concern about the safety of aging jets.
Tiny cracks were found in nearly half the older Boeing 737s
inspected in the succeeding months.
   ``A lot of us put the aging aircraft and the structures problem
as the most significant in the whole area of aviation safety,'' said
John Galipault, president of the Aviation Safety Institute, a
non-profit, independent, aviation accident prevention research group
in Worthington, Ohio.
   ``We put it above security matters, air traffic control matters,
pilot training and human factors,'' Galipault said. ``I don't think
that Boeing has or should be accused of any malfeasance in this
regard at all.
   ``By and large, we have always found that Boeing has maintained a
high level of integrity.''
   Boeing this month said it had hired a public-relations firm, Hill
and Knowlton Inc. One sign of its influence was a Boeing statement
expressing condolences over the Feb. 8 crash of a chartered 707 in
the Azores _ the first time Boeing has issued such a statement
before the cause of a crash was officially determined.
   In addition to the fuselage blowouts and crashes, the world's
biggest maker of commercial jetliners also has had problems with
miswired emergency systems in some newer planes, a possibility that
arose after a 737 crash in England in January, and production delays
on its 747-400.
   ``What you have here is a series of events, and the only
correlation is that they're happening in the same time frame, but if
you dissect each one you will find that they're totally unrelated,''
said David Jimenez of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, a subsidiary that
has prided itself on high-quality work and a strong safety record in
its planes.
   With news reports of problems in rapid succession, however, ``it
does become one large blur to the public,'' Jimenez conceded.
   ``It's made for a very intense period of being scrutinized,
sometimes unfairly, and that's a difficult thing to counter because
the incidents are happening ... and we don't always have time to
explain ourselves,'' he said.
   ``You take each one as they come and you try to anticipate what
the press is going to focus on next,'' Jimenez said. ``We're
sustaining. I think we're doing pretty good in terms of the
attention we're getting.''
   Some analysts predicted recent accidents and problems won't
slacken airplane orders, and may even have the opposite effect as
airlines step up replacement of aging aircraft.
   Boeing, in fact, received record orders last year _ for 636
planes valued at a total of more than $30 billion.
