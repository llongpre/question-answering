   A small airplane crashed into a swamp during
a thunderstorm Sunday, killing all four people aboard, authorities
said.
   In Port Lavaca, Texas, a single-engine airplane crashed into a
house during a heavy fog, killing the pilot and injuring the
passenger. Those in the house escaped injury.
   Florida rescue crews were searching for a second aircraft after
eyewitnesses reported different locations for the crash site,
suggesting the possibility of a collision, officials said.
   ``They're just checking to make sure there wasn't more than one
plane,'' said Robert Bullard, an Escambia County emergency medical
technician who was the first to arrive at the crash site.
   The single-engine Piper Cherokee had taken off near Tampa Bay,
Fla, and was bound for Mobile, Ala., said Jack Barker, regional
spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Atlanta.
   Two men and two women were killed by the impact of the crash
about 20 miles north of Pensacola, Bullard said. The plane
apparently lost its wings during a thunderstorm and its nose hit
first, he said.
   The airplane, which was passing over Pensacola, had been in
routine contact with the control tower before the crash, Barker said.
   ``Then at 12:35 Central time they lost contact with the plane 10
miles north-northwest of Pensacola, near Molino,'' Barker said.
   The plane went down in a swampy area near this Florida panhandle
town, hindering recovery efforts, said Escambia County Sheriff's
Department spokesman John Harper.
   Rescuers had to travel by boat part of the route and took over
two hours to reach the site, he said.
   The victims' names were not immediately available, Barker said.
   Port Lavaca Police Chief Joe Pena said Basil Blevins and his wife
were watching television in the den of their home about 11:30 p.m.
Saturday when the two-seater plane plowed into the master bedroom.
   The pilot, Allen Abildstrom of Houston, 32, was killed. Passenger
Gregory Hicks, 22, of Houston, was transported in satisfactory
condition to Sharpstown Hospital, where he was being treated for eye
injuries, authorities said.
   The plane was removed from the house early Sunday.
   ``I didn't feel a thing,'' Blevins said of the crash. ``It got
the front bedroom, the hallway, the bathroom, the closet and then
the master bedroom.''
   ``They lucked out,'' Pena said of the couple. ``They were in the
den area when it crashed. It came through the roof and the engine
was lodged into a closet and bathroom of the master bedroom.''
