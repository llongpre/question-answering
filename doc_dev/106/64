   Letters from Howard Hughes to a onetime key aide
and other items linked to the late billionaire will go on the
auction block this weekend in what is billed as the first sale of
its kind.
   Most of the memorabilia to be sold belonged to the late R.C.
Kuldell, who tended to the business of Hughes Tool Co. in Houston
during the late 1930s while his young and flamboyant boss was in
Hollywood making movies and headlines.
   ``While Howard was out playing, Kuldell was in Houston making
money hand over fist for him,'' said Ray Simpson, owner of the
company handling the sale. About 65 items will be auctioned at
Simpson's auction house Sunday.
   Besides the Kuldell items, the sale will include a shotgun that
the Hughes, an industrialist, aviation pioneer and film producer, is
said to have carried with him on a record-breaking, round-the-world
airplane flight in 1938, a hat and scarf he purportedly once wore,
several rare posters of movies he made and three schoolbooks he used
as a child.
   Hughes led a much-publicized life as a young man, but he later
became obsessively reclusive. He died in 1976 at age 70 while on a
chartered flight from Acapulco to Houston for medical treatment.
   Simpson said a letter from Hughes signed simply ``Howard'' sold
for $1,000 at an auction in New York three years ago, but there has
not been a public sale that consisted exclusively of Hughes
memorabilia.
   Notarized letters will support the authenticity of Hughes' link
to all the items, most which are owned by Houston entrepreneur Bob
Kuldell, R.C.'s son, Simpson said. The elder Kuldell died in 1973.
   ``I thought other people could use these things more than I could
right now,'' Bob Kuldell said in explaining why he decided to sell.
   R.C. Kuldell was hired by Hughes' father, Howard Hughes Sr., and
went to work for Hughes Tool, now Baker Hughes Tool Co., in 1920. He
continued to work there after the elder Hughes died in 1924 and
18-year-old Howard Jr. became his boss.
   ``Dad had a very good rapport with Howard,'' the younger Kuldell
said. ``He loved him like a son.''
   R.C. Kuldell retired from Hughes Tool in 1939 at age 52, after a
corporate power struggle with a Hughes adviser, his son said. But
Kuldell kept in touch with Hughes until his death in 1973, his son
said.
   One of the items to be auctioned is a solid gold, custom-made
pocket watch Hughes gave to Kuldell with both men's initials
inscribed on the back. Kuldell's son said ``he treasured that watch
more than anything.''
   Ordinarily, such a watch would sell for at least $10,000, but it
is expected to fetch a higher price because of the history behind
it, Simpson said. In all, the items could bring as much as $100,000,
he said.
   Simpson said that after word got out about the auction, several
other people called wanting to sell their Hughes memorabilia.
   One consigner is selling three schoolbooks that belonged to
Hughes, found in an attic of a home 40 years ago.
   Folded up in one of the books is a drawing of a boy in a car that
has an airplane propeller on the end. And in one composition book,
an 8-year-old Hughes writes about his 1913 Christmas.
   ``I hung my stocking and tried to make mother hang hers up, but
she would not do it. I went to bed but could not go to sleep for a
long time. I got up the next day and went downstairs. I thought
there was too much for me. I had a nice Christmas.''
   Simpson expects about 500 people to attend the auction.
