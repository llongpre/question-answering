<LEADPARA>  White House Chief of Staff John Sununu was ordered Friday night to follow
tough new rules governing his use of corporate airplanes, after an internal
inquiry by the White House counsel's office determined that he and his aides
misinformed presidential counsel C. Boyden Gray about a trip he took to a
political fund-raiser in Chicago on June 11, sources said.;    The new order
to Sununu, delivered by Gray with President Bush's knowledge, is the latest of
three rebukes dealt the chief of staff over the past six weeks, after
questions were raised about his travel habits, first on military jets, then in
his government limousine and now on corporate jets.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  WHITE HOUSE CURBS SUNUNU FREE TRAVEL FOR
THE THIRD TIME  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Under Friday night's new rules, all future airplane travel by Sununu must
be requested and approved in advance with an official travel authorization
through the White House office of administration. Such flights can be arranged
only by the "host organization" sponsoring the trip and cannot be solicited by
Sununu or his office.;    The disclosures were made as a growing number of top
Bush administration officials, including Gray, Vice President Dan Quayle and
Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher, are becoming increasingly embittered
by the controversy surrounding Sununu, according to administration officials
and other sources.;    A White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the latest development came when Gray and other White House
officials discovered that the chief of staff had "called an old friend, Stuart
Bernstein . . . and asked if he had an airplane he could use.";    The plane,
which Bernstein agreed to provide, carried Sununu to Chicago, where he spoke
at a fund-raising event of the Republican Governors' Association, for which
Sununu's wife, Nancy, works. Bernstein is a Washington real estate developer.;
   Sununu made the request June 10, the day before the speech, after Gray
turned down requests to use planes offered by Archer Daniels Midland, an
agribusiness company whose activities are heavily regulated by the federal
government, and by two other companies, Textron and Ameritech, because their
ties to the government also raised questions of potential conflicts of
interest, the official said.;    The official said Bernstein told Sununu he no
longer owned an airplane, but that three business associates, Howard Bender,
Morton Bender and John Mason, did.;    "Mr. Bernstein chartered the plane from
them and made it available for Sununu to travel to Chicago," the official
said, adding that Bernstein, Sununu's wife and Edward M. Rogers, a Sununu
aide, traveled with the chief of staff to Chicago.;    Sununu then reported to
Gray that the plane was being provided by the Benders, who are brothers, and
Mason, rather than telling him it was Bernstein who was donating the aircraft,
the official said. Howard Bender is a key figure in Blake Construction Co.,
which has built major government facilities in the Washington area and leases
property to the government.;    "Sununu and Rogers say they did not know
Bernstein was the donor who paid for the airplane," the White House official
said.;    Although no government regulation prohibits the chief of staff from
soliciting donations of private aircraft for his personal use, procedures set
up May 9 by Gray to govern Sununu's travel advised him against doing so.  </TEXT>
