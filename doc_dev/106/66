   Boeing Commercial Airplanes has made design
changes to prevent wiring and plumbing mistakes such as those found
on 94 Boeing jets in a recent government-ordered inspection,
company officials said Friday.
   Boeing said it was using different-sized fittings, putting the
connections in different locations and using labels and
color-coding to prevent the problems found in jetliner engine and
cargo hold fire detection and extinguishing systems.
   ``No design can be 100 percent foolproof for manufacturing and
maintenance, but the new connections should be very close to it,''
Ben Cosgrove, Commercial Airplanes senior vice president, said in a
news release.
   The Federal Aviation Administration was expected to approve the
changes, Boeing said. Once approved, the new designs will be
incorporated into production lines this fall and were expected to
be available for retrofitting in previously delivered aircraft
shortly thereafter.
   In January, the FAA issued an airworthiness directive requiring
U.S. operators of Boeing jets to inspect for possible miswiring and
misplumbing. Systems were inspected on 1,600 Boeing planes,
including hundreds operated by foreign carriers, and 95
misconnections _ two on one plane _ were found and corrected.
   No accident or emergency resulted from the miswirings or
misplumbings, although Boeing said eight of the misconnections
would have resulted in false information displays to a flight crew.
   The FAA said earlier that in one instance involving a
twin-engine Boeing 757 flown by a foreign carrier, engine fire
control panel modules were reversed so that a fire in the right
engine would indicate a fire in the left, and vice versa.
   ``Probable result is that both engines are shut down from
extinguishant discharge and fuel cut-off actions,'' the FAA
concluded.
   Boeing's problems with miswiring first received attention in the
spring of 1988 when Japan Air Lines complained about misconnections
in a fire suppression system. The complaint was among a number
Boeing received from customers about aircraft quality and the
Seattle-based aerospace company has said it has been attempting in
the past year to improve workmanship.
   The FAA ordered the inspections Jan. 31 after limited directives
turned up problems in 17 aircraft.
   The Jan. 8 crash of a British Midland Airways 737 in Scotland
raised speculation that the pilot may have been deceived by faulty
wiring into shutting down his only good engine. The cause of that
crash, in which 44 people died, is under investigation.
   Crossed wiring was eliminated as a cause by investigators for
Britain's Civil Aviation Administration, Commercial Airplanes
spokeswoman Liz Reese said, ``but now we carry that stigma.''
   Cosgrove said the changes include using different-sized wire and
plumbing connections for different functions.
