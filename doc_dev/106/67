<HEAD>Boeing Falls Nine Months Behind In Navy Contract</HEAD>

   An $800 million contract to put new wings on the
Navy's aging A6-E attack jets has fallen nine months behind
schedule, Boeing Military Airplanes has confirmed.
   The new wings, made of graphite and other advanced composite
materials, are to extend the life of the airplanes, which went into
production in the late 1950s. Approximately half the Navy and
Marine Corps' 340 A6-Es have been grounded or restricted because of
metal fatigue.
   An article in this week's Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology, an
aerospace industry publication, said the Wichita, Kan.-based Boeing
subsidiary had fallen 41 wings behind schedule. So far, only three
wings have been delivered.
   The magazine reported the Navy has decided to buy more of the
original metal wings from Grumman Corp. as replacements and will
restructure the rewinging program.
   No contract has been signed with Grumman to make the additional
metal wings. Capt. Michael Kearney, Naval Air Systems Command A6-E
program manager, told Aviation Week it will take Grumman 18 months
from any agreement before the first metal wings are delivered.
   The flight of the first test jet with a composite wing has
slipped back to January. The first such aircraft had been scheduled
for delivery in October, but will now be delayed until all problems
are solved, the magazine said.
   Vice Adm. Joseph B. Wilkinson, commander of the Naval Air
Systems Command, visited Boeing's Wichita plant in June, then wrote
Boeing Military Airplanes President Robert L. Dryden to complain
about poor attention to quality control. The Navy is withholding
approximately $100 million from Boeing because of the delay,
Aviation Week said.
   Boeing officials said they think they have solved the problems
and are moving toward the planned production rate of six wings per
month.
   ``We had some early start-up problems, some engineering changes,
and a delamination problem late last year,'' said Boeing
spokeswoman Carolyn Russell. ``That's all been resolved. More
recently, we had some fasteners that were too short. We're
inspecting all those, replacing any of those that need to be
replaced.
   Boeing's Wichita unit has 1,900 people working on the A6-E wing
project and is under contract to produce 174 production wings and
five test wings, Ms. Russell said. The first wing, scheduled for
delivery last November, was delivered in mid-May.
   Boeing has said in recent quarterly earnings reports that
startup costs and delays in military programs have cut into its
profits.
