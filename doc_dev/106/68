AIRPLANE UPDATE: Marty Balin has rejoined the retooled Jefferson Airplane, 
which has signed with Epic Records. The lineup now includes all of the key 
players of the original Airplane, which shot to stardom in 1967 -- Balin, Grace 
Slick, Paul Kantner, bassist Jack Casady and guitarist Jorma Kaukonen.

The group announced its plans to regroup two months ago, but Balin wasn't on 
board at that point. But he and his former band mates have since come to terms. 
The group is recording its first Epic album in a Los Angeles studio, sharing 
production chores with producer Ron Nevison. It's the first time that all of 
the Airplane principals have been in the studio together since 1972 when they 
cut "Long John Silver."

Starship, which evolved in 1985 out of Jefferson Starship -- a spinoff of the 
original Airplane -- carries on, still signed to RCA. None of its members were 
around in the Airplane days. The longest-serving member is Craig Chaquico, who 
joined in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
There is talk of an Airplane tour to coincide with the expected release of the 
new album in August.
