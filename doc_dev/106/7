   The federal government will study sites
where the Wright brothers lived and worked in a move that could
lead to a national park in the birthplace of aviation, officials
said Friday.
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, said the National Park Service study,
expected to take 12 to 15 months, will help Congress decide whether
to confer national park status on the sites.
   A committee headed by U.S. District Court Judge Walter Rice was
formed to preserve the heritage of Orville and Wilbur Wright, who
developed the first heavier-than-air flying machine.
   ``Over the years ... we have lost many of the buildings, many of
the historic sites involved in the birth of aviation either to the
wrecking ball or to just plain indifference,'' Rice said. ``That
time is over.''
   The sites to be studied include Huffman Prairie, scene of the
Wright brothers' first flying experiments, and buildings that
housed the Wrights' airplane company, bicycle shop and printing
business.
   Also on the list are Hawthorne Hill, home of Orville Wright;
Carillon Park, home of the Wright Flyer III, known as the world's
first practical airplane; and Dunbar House, home of Paul Lawrence
Dunbar, poet and friend of the Wright brothers.
   William Gibson, a National Park Service official based in
Chillicothe, said the agency will study options for managing the
sites, including oversight by the state or local government, the
private sector, or the federal government in the form of a national
park.
   ``We are impressed,'' said Gibson. ``The historic resources
associated with the Wright brothers that remain in Dayton are truly
impressive.''
   The city of Dayton and Montgomery County plan to contribute
$35,000 apiece toward the study. Private contributions will also be
sought, officials said.
   While the Wright brothers constructed their early aircraft at
their bicycle shop in Dayton, they also are connected historically
with Kitty Hawk, N.C., where on Dec. 17, 1903, they made the first
controlled, sustained flights in a power-driven airplane.
