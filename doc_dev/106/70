   The first flight of Boeing Co.'s new 747-400
jumbo jet has been delayed by electrical problems, the company said.
   Dean Thornton, president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said
Wednesday that the first deliveries of the plane, which was
formally introduced by Boeing in January, are still expected in
December but aren't a certainty.
   Northwest Airlines and Singapore Airlines both said they are
scheduled to receive two of the planes in December.
   Analysts said that if the four planes planned for December
delivery are delayed into January, Boeing's 1988 sales could be
reduced by about $500 million and pre-tax operating profits could
be cut by as much as $100 million.
   Phil Brannon, an aerospace analyst with Merrill Lynch in New
York, said he estimates Boeing would receive close to $25 million
in operating profit on each 747-400. Paul Nisbet, analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York, estimated each plane
could generate $35 million in profit.
   Thornton said it is possible the airplane's problems could delay
certification of the jetliner by the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The first flight had been scheduled for March 21, but Thornton
said he now expects it to be ``the latter part of this month.''
   Thornton said the electrical problems involve the main power
generation system.
   He said the new 747, the world's largest commercial jetliner,
has proven to be more complex to build than originally expected.
   The sophisticated electronics of the plane include a
computerized cockpit that allows for a crew of two, rather than the
three required on the earlier 747s. Also, the four-engine plane has
improved aerodynamics with a bigger wingspan and added vertical
winglets at their tips. It is powered by new engines.
   Thornton said the job also has been complicated by ``customer
pressure to change things, to tailor-make it to suit their
requirements.''
   The 747-400 is designed to carry as many as 479 passengers and
has a range of 8,000 miles.
   Northwest, the initial customer for the plane, has ordered 10 of
the jets with spare parts, worth $1.5 billion. Singapore Airlines
has ordered 14 and taken options for six others, for a total value
of $3.3 billion.
   Boeing has received $13 billion to $14 billion in firm orders
for 118 of the jets, plus options for 66 others. Each plane sells
for about $125 million.
   Boeing had profit of $480 million, or $3.10 a share, on sales of
$15.35 billion in 1987. The company expects sales of $17 billion
this year.
