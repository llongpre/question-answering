   A team investigating why an 18-foot section of an
airplane ripped off in flight said Wednesday a number of
discrepancies in Aloha Airlines' records indicated problems with
aircraft were noted but no record was made of corrections.
   Lonnie R. Giles, leader of a Federal Aviation Administration
inspection team, said Aloha's structural inspection program and its
compliance with FAA airworthiness directives were reviewed in a
special inspection in May.
   The review followed the April 28th incident in which a portion
of the fuselage on a Boeing 737 peeled off on a flight from Hilo to
Honolulu, exposing the first-class section to the open air at
24,000 feet.
   The pilot and co-pilot managed to land the crippled jet 13
minutes later in Maui although one of the two engines quit. A
flight attendant died in the accident.
   The National Transportation Safety Board heard testimony
Wednesday about two FAA reports critical of Aloha's maintenance
operations.
   In one example, the FAA inspection team said a Jan. 5 Aloha
document described two rivets being popped on a window post of a
737.
   The document's corrective action section is stamped: ``Inspected
and determined OK for further service, transcribed for further
rework.''
   The FAA report said the missing rivet item again appeared on a
Jan. 15 Aloha document with an additional note that the ``window
must be removed.'' The same document also described missing
fasteners just behind the window post.
   The FAA report said neither of the discrepancy reports showed
any corrective actions, and when the FAA inspected the aircraft on
May 9 inspectors noted the rivets were still missing.
   Henry Arii, Aloha vice president of quality control and
assurance, said in an interview that in all such instances cited,
interim repairs were made to keep the planes airworthy until the
problems could be permanently fixed. He said that because Aloha
used a unique system for tracking repairs, the FAA did not realize
the temporary repairs had been made.
   The airplane in question was taken out of service in the spring.
The FAA report did not specify the exact date.
   Aloha spokesman Milton Goto said the plane in question was
rebuilt, inspected and returned to service.
   The FAA team said Aloha's record-keeping system for compliance
with FAA airworthiness directives lacked continuity and consistency.
   Airworthiness directives are orders by the FAA to inspect and
correct problems in aircraft.
   ``The paper trace to determine actual method of compliance was
very difficult and time-consuming,'' the FAA report said.
   However the report said that after ``much diligent and tedious
research'' the team found satisfactory evidence of compliance with
the directives.
   A separate FAA team inspected Aloha's maintenance program in
December as part of a national aviation safety program that looked
at a number of airlines.
   The FAA's Dec. 21 report found, among other things, maintenance
officials at Aloha had ``been remiss in their responsibilities by
not being able to recognize their own deficiencies ...''
   The FAA said maintenance managers were asked to furnish
information about Aloha's aircraft maintenance reliability program.
   ``The end result was the reliability documents requested could
not be furnished, because they are non-existent,'' according to the
report.
   In an April 21 update, the FAA team said Aloha had submitted a
new reliability program and acted to correct other problems found
in the inspection.
   The NTSB inquiry board also questioned FAA officials about
whether they should put more emphasis on ``hands-on'' aircraft
inspections, rather than reviewing airline maintenance documents,
in looking for possible problems.
   ``We do review a lot of paperwork,'' Giles said, ``I try to
temper mine with a lot of on-site inspection.''
   Giles acknowledged there's not necessarily a correlation between
well-kept documents and well-kept aircraft. ``To get a good,
complete picture, you have to look at both.''
   Each carrier has the primary responsibility for ensuring its
planes are safe, but Giles said that he personally has grounded
planes he thought unairworthy.
