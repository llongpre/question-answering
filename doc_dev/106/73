   Northwest Airlines said it placed a $1.25 billion order with General Electric Co. and a European consortium of engine makers for 325 aircraft engines. 

   The order marks the first time that Northwest, a unit of St. Paul, Minn.-based NWA Inc., hasn't purchased its airplane engines from Hartford, Conn.-based United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt &amp; Whitney unit, a company spokesman said. 

   Northwest will use the CFM56-5 engines, which are manufactured jointly by Fairfield, Conn.-based GE and Societe Nationale d'Etude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation, in jets that the airline recently ordered from Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft consortium. 

   As previously reported, Northwest agreed last October to buy as many as 100 midsized A-320 jetliners from Airbus for delivery beginning in 1990. 
Last month, the airline placed a tentative order for as many as 20 of Airbus's proposed A-340 long-range airliners for delivery starting in 1992. 

   Northwest's spokesman said the airline will buy the engines as it buys the planes. 
The reason for the large order is that some engines will be used as spares. 

   Northwest's decision not to place its order with a consortium that included Pratt &amp; Whitney resulted, in part, from that consortium's bowing out of the competition to provide engines for the larger jets, the spokesman said. 
"We were looking for a common engine we could use on both (sizes of) airplanes," he said. 

   A spokeswoman for Pratt &amp; Whitney pointed out that this bid was the first that the company made to Northwest as part of an international consortium of engine makers, International Aero Engines. 
Pratt &amp; Whitney didn't propose an engine on its own, she said. 
Nonetheless, she said the company was "disappointed" that International Aero wasn't selected for the Northwest job. 

   She too noted that Northwest had wanted to use the same engine for both the midsized A-320 and the long-range A-340, but said the airline had wanted the engine for the larger aircraft also to be equipped with a so-called superfan. 
"We felt the technical and program risks were too great" to develop such a design by 1992, she said. 

   Pratt &amp; Whitney said it continues to do business with Northwest on its own and hopes to do so as part of the International Aero consortium, as well. 
The engine maker said it has been doing business with the airline for at least 20 years, involving "hundreds of millions of dollars." 

   International Aero also includes Rolls-Royce Ltd. of Britain; Japan Aero Engines Corp.; Fiat Aviazione S.p.A., a unit of Fiat Group of Italy; and MTU Motoren &amp; Turbinen-Union Muenchen G.m.b.H. of West Germany.
