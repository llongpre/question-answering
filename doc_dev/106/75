   Boeing Co. is close to a revised production
schedule for the new 747-400 jumbojet but will negotiate late
delivery penalties with at least four customers, a company
executive said.
   Phil Condit, Boeing Commercial Airplanes executive vice
president, also predicted Tuesday the long-range jetliner would be
certified for a second engine type next week and for a third next
month.
   With 747-400 deliveries initially set to begin late last year,
Boeing executives said in October wiring problems would delay
delivery of the first 20 jets.
   A second delay was announced in December when initial
certification by the Federal Aviation Administration took longer
than expected.
   In January, Boeing officials spent five days ``readjusting'' the
747 production line at Everett, north of Seattle, and again
examined the production schedule. The line went through another
five-day readjustment in late March or early April to catch up work
that had fallen out of sequence, said Commercial Airplanes
spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese.
   The 747-400, which can carry 412 passengers more than 8,000
miles nonstop, is an extensively updated version of a model first
introduced in 1968. The new plane has a computerized cockpit
designed for a crew of two instead of three, is built with advanced
materials and has a larger wing.
   Condit and other Boeing officials acknowledge they may have been
overly ambitious in trying to bring out essentially four new
747-400s at once _ three different engine types, plus a ``combi''
version of the airframe that can carry freight on the upper deck.
In addition, they said each airline wants planes customized to
different needs.
   ``We took on a real task up there at Everett in terms of three
different engine certs, a combi, 18 customers in the first year,
and we didn't do was well as we would have liked,'' Condit said.
   ``We're holding very close to the plans that we laid out in
January,'' he said. ``It's not perfect, to be honest with you. We
missed by a couple of days, but overall I'm happy with how things
are going.''
   Boeing's latest schedule has been withheld, but Commercial
Airplanes spokeswoman Deane Darling said five 747-400s have been
delivered _ three to Northwest Airlines and two to Singapore
Airlines, all powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.
   Approximately a dozen more 747-400s have been built and are
undergoing final preparation before delivery, Ms. Reese said.
   Condit said he expected the plane to be certified with General
Electric engines next week, with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Lufthansa getting the first two, the sixth and seventh off the line.
   Certification with Rolls-Royce engines should occur next month,
with Cathay Pacific and British Airways getting the first of those
models, Condit said.
   The first 747-400 Combi is to be delivered in early fall to KLM.
   Four 747-400s were delivered as of March 31, Ms. Darling said. A
greater number should be delivered in the second quarter, but ``I'm
not going to go beyond that at this point,'' Condit said.
   Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz has said he hopes for production
of 57 747s this year, including other models, but added there was
``significant risk'' in that forecast because more than half those
planes are scheduled for delivery in the last three months of the
year.
   Several airlines, including Northwest and KLM, have called for
compensation for late deliveries.
   ``We have contracts with a whole number of airlines that we have
not met,'' Condit said, ``and so clearly, like any good business,
when you don't meet your contract, you sit down and reach an
agreement on how you're going to settle that.''
   Without saying what how the compensation might be made, Condit
said Boeing would negotiate a settlement with Northwest, Lufthansa,
KLM and Singapore Airlines ``on an airline-by-airline basis.''
