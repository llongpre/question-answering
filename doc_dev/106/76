<HEAD>Korean Air Orders Six 747-400s, Takes Options on Four in $1.5
Billion Deal</HEAD>

   Korean Air Lines has ordered six advanced-model
747-400 jumbo jets and placed options on four more planes in a deal
worth more than $1.5 billion, Boeing Co. announced.
   The airline also made public Wednesday a previously unannounced
$374 million order for a 747-300 Combi and two 747-200 freighters
to be delivered later this year.
   The package, which totals more than $1.9 million, includes spare
parts and support, Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Tom Cole
said.
   KAL already has three 747-400s on order for delivery beginning
in April 1989. Deliveries of the new -400 series orders will
continue into 1994.
   Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz announced the sale in Seoul with
KAL president C.K. Cho.
   The order was a boost for Boeing after recent criticism from
three major customers.
   Japan Air Lines, All Nippon Airways and British Airways have
complained recently of poor workmanship in Boeing 747 and 767
jetliners. Shrontz met earlier this week in Tokyo with the
president of JAL, who wrote him last month about defects, but
details of the discussion were not released.
   Boeing executive vice president Phil Condit responded to the
criticism on Tuesday, saying the company builds safe airplanes and
that letters about quality concerns are not unusual.
   The new 747-400 features improved range, fuel economy,
aerodynamics and avionics.
   Cho said the planes were ordered because of the airline's
expected growth and need for airplanes with ``a high standard of
reliability and comfort.''
   The Boeing contracts were in line with KAL's long-term program
to organize worldwide service networks and improve its
competitiveness in the world airline market, KAL officials in Seoul
said.
   The contracts also were part of KAL's efforts to prepare for an
expected sharp increase in air travelers following a recent Seoul
government decision to ease restrictions on foreign trips by South
Koreans, the officials said.
   Test flights of the first 747-400, which rolled out of Boeing's
Everett factory in a ceremony in late January, have been delayed
because of electrical problems. On Tuesday, company officials said
they expected the plane to begin flight testing by the end of this
month and be certified by the Federal Aviation Administration
before the year's end.
   Boeing said deliveries of the first four -400s, two each to
Northwest Airlines and Singapore Airlines, still are expected in
December.
   The jumbo jets ordered by KAL will carry up to 398 passengers in
a three-class arrangement. The airline said the new planes will be
able to carry a full passenger and cargo payload non-stop between
Seoul and New York.
   The KAL order brings 747-400 orders to 124 planes with a value
of nearly $15 billion.
