   The hole that tore open on a United Airlines 747
on Friday near Hawaii was reminiscent of a near-disaster in the same
area last year and seemed likely to become the latest in a series of
public relations nightmares for Boeing Co.
   Problems with aging aircraft, miswired emergency systems in some
newer planes, production delays on the giant 747-400 and a series of
tragic crashes have focused unusual attention on the world's biggest
maker of commercial jetliners, particularly in the past 60 days.
   ``What you have here is a series of events and the only
correlation is that they're happening in the same time frame. But if
you dissect each one you will find that they're totally unrelated,''
said David Jimenez, a spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, the
Boeing subsidiary that has prided itself on high-class workmanship
and a strong safety record in its planes.
   He added, however, that with news reports of problems coming one
after another, ``it does become one large blur to the public.''
   ``It's made for a very intense period of being scrutinized,
sometimes unfairly, and that's a difficult thing to counter because
the incidents are happening...and we don't always have time to
explain ourselves,'' Jimenez said.
   There was no immediate word on the cause of Friday's incident, in
which nine people apparently were sucked from the United Airlines
jet when a 10-by-40-foot vertical hole opened in its fuselage. The
flight had taken off a few minutes earlier for Auckland, New
Zealand, and Sydney, Australia.
   It brought to mind an accident April 28, also over Hawaii. A
flight attendant was killed and 61 people injured when a portion of
the fuselage on a Boeing 737 peeled off during an Aloha Airlines
flight from Hilo to Honolulu, exposing the first-class section to
the open air at 24,000 feet. The pilot and co-pilot managed to land
the jet although one of the two engines quit.
   In December, an Eastern Airlines Boeing 727 with 104 passengers
and six crew aboard was forced to land at Yeager Airport in
Charleston, W.Va., after a 14-inch hole opened in its fuselage at
31,000 feet.
   The first incident led to widespread concern about the safety of
aging jets like the Aloha 737. Tiny cracks were found in nearly half
the aging Boeing 737 jetliners inspected in the months following the
Aloha accident.
   More recently, a series of crashes focused attention on Boeing
jets: the Dec. 21 terrorist bombing of a Pan American 747 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in which nearly 300 people on board and on the
ground died; the January crash of a British Midland Airways 737 in
England, killing 44 people; and the Feb. 8 crash of a chartered 707
in the Azores, which killed 144 people.
   But airlines have voted with their dollars in expressing their
continuing confidence in Boeing airplanes. All Nippon Airways on
Wednesday ordered 20 new 747-400s in a deal valued at $3.1 billion.
Orders in 1988 topped $30 billion for 636 planes, both record
figures for the industry.
   But Boeing has been plagued by various safety and production
concerns of late:
   _The company confirmed Wednesday that crossed tubes in cargo-hold
fire-extinguisher systems were found in two Air Canada 767s.
   The Federal Aviation Administration on Feb. 1 ordered checks on
the plumbing and wiring of fire-suppressant and monitoring systems
in cargo holds and engines of Boeing planes built since 1981. Over
the past year, a total of 30 such problems have been found by
airlines worldwide.
   The issue arose after the British Midland crash, when
investigators suspected that crossed wires may have led the pilot to
shut down the wrong engine after a warning system indicated an
engine fire. However, crossed wires subsequently were eliminated as
a cause of that crash.
   Boeing has said it is taking steps to find the cause of the
problems and to make changes so they cannot happen in the future.
   _The FAA said earlier this month that it had asked Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas Corp. to determine whether inadequately tested
nuts, bolts and rivets made by Voi-Shan Aerospace Products were used
in making aircraft. Voi-Shan, of Chatsworth, Calif., is being
investigated over reports that test documents on the fasteners were
falsified.
   _Some major airlines have expressed anger at Boeing for delays in
its 747-400 program and have said they will seek compensation for
planes they will not receive on time.
   Boeing concedes it was too optimistic in putting together a
timetable on the 747-400 program, but says that after delaying
initial deliveries of the giant plane it is working to put the
program back on track with no loss in quality.
   Boeing also said earlier this month that it had hired a public
relations firm, Hill and Knowlton Inc. The first sign of the PR
firm's influence was when Boeing issued a statement expressing
condolences over the 707 crash in the Azores Feb. 8 _ the first time
Boeing has issued such a statement before the cause of a crash was
officially determined.
