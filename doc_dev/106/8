<LEADPARA>  Whether it's painting airplanes to resemble killer whales, or dressing like
Elvis to greet passengers, Southwest Airlines is serious about having fun.;   
The off-beat approach by the airline, once dubbed the "Cattle Call" carrier,
comes from the top. And it's made a difference on the bottom line: Southwest
was one of only two major airlines to make a profit in 1990, earning $47.1
million, or $1.10 a share, on $1.19 billion in revenue.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     United Airlines was the other profitable carrier.;    "Having fun on the
job has a lot of benefits connected with it," said Chairman Herb Kelleher, who
has been known to dress like Elvis to greet passengers and play practical
jokes on his employees. "You don't have to surrender your individuality to
work for Southwest Airlines.";    Kelleher believes the breezy corporate
culture of the nation's eighth-largest airline -- from cash-register style
tickets to golf shirt-clad flight attendants -- has helped make the airline
more efficient.;    In fact, speedy ground crews turn around half of
Southwest's flights in 15 minutes.;    Kelleher has even had closets removed
from the front of Southwest's Boeing 737s when he noticed passengers dawdled
by it.;    Southwest offers few frills. There are no meals, and until recently
only beverages and peanuts were served. Cookies have been added to the longer
flights.;    Passengers aren't assigned seats, but are handed reusable,
numbered, plastic boarding passes when they check in. They then board on a
first-come, first-served basis, hence the cattle-call moniker.;    Such
measures have made Southwest's cost per passenger mile 6.73 cents, one of the
lowest in the business.;    Marketing savvy also has helped. The airline's
frequent flier program is based on the number of flights taken instead of
mileage.;    The airline drew some snickers in 1988 when it painted a plane
like a killer whale to promote a joint venture with Sea World parks in San
Antonio and San Diego. But it drew even more customers and now has three
"Shamu" planes.;    Southwest also has painted a plane to look like a furling
Texas flag -- Lone Star One -- to commemorate its 20th anniversary year this
year.;    "No matter what Herb Kelleher's title is . . . he is a marketing
genius," said Roy Spence of GSD&amp;M Advertising in Austin, the airline's lead
agency.;    Analysts expect Southwest's success to continue despite the
economic downturn because it has carved a niche as a short-haul carrier with
low fares.;    "Southwest has shown incredible resiliency during this period
of industry losses," said Paul Karos, an airline analyst with First Boston
Corp.;    Karos predicts higher profits for Southwest in 1991.;    Airlines
have been hurt in the past several months by higher fuel prices, the
recession's effect on consumer spending and fear of terrorism stirred by the
war.;    Southwest has managed to overcome those obstacles. During January,
for example, it had 13.1 percent more flights and added 17.6 percent more
passengers over a year ago. Last month it filled slightly more seats, 62
percent vs. 61 percent in February 1990.;    Nonetheless, Kelleher remains
cautious. "We're not recession-proof. We've suffered from the sparsity of
traffic, too," he said.;    In fact, the Dallas-based carrier has had its
troubles since its inception.;    When Kelleher and business partner Rollin
King mapped out Southwest's original routes -- between Dallas, Houston and San
Antonio -- on a cocktail napkin in 1966, they had no idea how hard it would be
for business to take off.;    Braniff and Trans-Texas airlines mounted
challenges in court and before aviation regulators to keep the upstart
grounded. Kelleher, a successful San Antonio attorney before starting the
airline, eventually argued Southwest's case in the U.S. Supreme Court. Its
first flight was on June 20, 1971.;    Then came the work of convincing
customers that Southwest was for real.;    "With the definition of commuter
airline then, you would have not thought of larger planes with seasoned
captains," said Camille Keith, the airline's first public relations chief.;   
And the airline has had to fend off fierce competition. In 1973, Braniff and
Southwest fought a pricing battle on flights between Houston and Dallas that
became known as "The $13 War" and is now written about in business textbooks.;
   Southwest's biggest competitive challenge now is in Phoenix, expected to be
its largest service point by the mid-'90s. America West Airlines, based there,
cut ticket prices in half in January, bringing some one-way fares to $20.;   
Southwest matched America West's prices with fewer restrictions. "Being able
to respond quickly and responsibly is the key to security and survival,"
Kelleher said.;    From the triangle of Texas' three largest cities, Southwest
has grown to 31 cities and 33 airports throughout the West and Midwest.  </TEXT>
