<LEADPARA>  An engine fell off a commuter airplane before it crashed into a farm field
last week, killing all 14 people aboard, investigators said Tuesday in
Houston. It was not clear whether that caused the crash or was just another
sign the plane was in trouble. Investigators said an in-flight fire and the
failure by maintenance workers to replace 43 screws on part of the plane
contributed to the crash.;   The plane, bound for Houston from Laredo,
nose-dived into a field last Wednesday, about 75 miles west of Houston. It is
clear the Continental Express plane fell apart before impact, said a spokesman
for the National Transportation Safety Board. The Brazilian-made, Embraer-120
twin-engine turboprop airplane lost its left engine, left wing, horizontal
stabilizer and a de-icing attachment.  </LEADPARA>
