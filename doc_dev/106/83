<HEAD>Air France Makes First Order of New Boeing Freighter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air France ordered five 747-400 Freighter aircraft
for $600 million, Boeing Commercial Airplanes announced.
   With Wednesday's order, Air France became the first airline to
buy the cargo version of the firm's latest new-technology airplane.
The passenger version of the 747-400 is now in service with nine
airlines.
   The first of the five freighters ordered by Air France will be
delivered in August 1993. The order was the biggest all-cargo order
ever received by Boeing.
   Ten other airlines, including Cargolux of Luxembourg, Cathay
Pacific, Japan Airlines and UTA of France, have been discussing with
Boeing the possibility of buying the 747-400F.
   The 747-400F is distinguished from the 747-200F by wider
wingspan, six-foot-high winglets on the ends of the wings, and the
capacity to carry 44,000 pounds more payload.
   The flight deck is greatly changed, with digital systems
replacing analog equipment and the two-person crew monitoring flight
progress on six video display terminals.
   The order brings to 217 the total orders for 747-400 aircraft.
Boeing this year has taken orders for 702 airplanes in all models,
with a combined value of $37.5 billion.
