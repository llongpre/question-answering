   The Boeing 727 airliner made famous by
D.B. Cooper is being dismantled for money _ not the skyjacker's
ransom but for spare parts.
   The jet arrived Friday at the Greenwood-Leflore Airport where it
will be disassembled for parts by The Memphis Group, a
Tennessee-based company.
   The company purchased the airplane from American Transair, which
bought the airplane from Northwest Airlines several years ago for
charter flights.
   The jetliner was the one hijacked on Nov. 24, 1971, by a ``D.B.
Cooper.'' A man using that name hijacked the plane during a flight
from Portland, Ore., to Seattle. He demanded $200,000 in $20 bills
and four parachutes.
   After the aircraft landed in Seattle, he released the 36
passengers and some of the crew in exchange for the ransom.
   Cooper ordered the crew to fly to Reno, Nev. Somewhere over
southwest Washington, Cooper opened an exit door and jumped. He has
never been located and his body was never found.
