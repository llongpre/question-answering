  [Text] Four foreign aerospace firms will join the 
government-backed project to produce the YSX passenger jet, 
Ministry of Trade and Industry officials said last week. The 
plane would be the first commercial airliner produced by Japan's 
aircraft industry since 1972. 
  Three Western companies -- Boeing Co. of the U.S., Aviation 
de Transport Regional, a French-Italian joint venture and 
Saab-Scania AB of Sweden -- plus the state-run Aviation 
Industries of China will this year join feasibility studies for 
the mid-range YSX aircraft, say the officials. 
  Since halting production of the short-range YS11 passenger 
aircraft in 1972, the Japanese aerospace industry has long 
talked of producing another commercial plane. The YSX, aimed to 
begin service early next century, has a capacity for 70-80 
passengers and a cruising range of between 1,000-1,300 nautical 
miles (1,800-2,400 km). 
  The foreign participation is seen as vital -- particularly 
that of Chinese. The Japan Aircraft Development Corp. (JADC), a 
private consortium backed by MITI, always aimed to attract 
partners with big markets. 
  Industry estimates suggest that China will need up to 800 
airplanes in the next 15 years and will become the world's 
third-largest aviation market next to the U.S. and Japan. That 
demand would make ready-made sales for mid-range regional jets 
like the YSX. 
  Foreign partnerships should also help reduce development 
costs, estimated to total &yen;80 billion ($708 million). 
  MITI, together with JADC, launched the first feasibility 
study in 1989. Since then almost &yen;400 million has been spent 
on the project. 
  For fiscal 1994, starting next April, MITI plans to allocate 
&yen;1.6 billion for the YSX regional jetliner with another 
&yen;800 million coming from the private sector members of JADC. 
  The foreign firms are expected to become full members of the 
development team in fiscal 1995, although no concrete agreements 
have yet been made on the partners' status when the feasibility 
study finishes, said a MITI official. JADC hopes to start 
engineering the YSX in 1997. 
  The non-Japanese companies hope to take advantage of the 
growing demand for small passenger aircraft, industry observers 
explained. Boeing, the world's largest aircraft builder, for 
example, currently has no airplanes with less than 100 seats. 
  JADC estimates a total of 650 airplanes with less than 100 
seats will be needed on the world market during the first decade 
of the next century. At least 300-400 orders would be required 
for the project to break even. 
  There are considerable risks. Many European aircraft 
builders 
are also trying to enter the small-to-mid-range jet market and 
have projects for planes with less than 100 seats already 
up-and-running. Both Saab and ATR have independently-launched 
projects to develop aircraft similar in size to the YSX. That 
could, fear Japanese officials, marginalize their involvement in 
the YSX project. 
  Those with long memories will also point to the previous 
Japanese commercial airliner, the YS11, a 75-seat plane, which 
was a commercial flop. 
  European manufacturers are already touting their own 
commuter 
aircraft on the Japanese market. Nichimen Corp., Japan's 
second-tier trading house, will carry out demonstration flights 
of German Dolnier 328 in Tokyo and Okinawa in March, hoping to 
win orders. Bombardier Inc. of Canada has also proposed a 50 
seater small aircraft.
