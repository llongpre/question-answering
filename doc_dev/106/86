   Aloha Airlines has defended its use of a jet
that lost part of its roof last April, saying that while the
manufacturer had suggested a structural maintenance program for
older planes, no one suggested they were unsafe to fly.
   Boeing Co. told Aloha last November that some of its jets had
significant corrosion problems and needed major structural
inspections.
   But ``At no time was it suggested by Boeing or any agency that
Aloha's four older aircraft presented a safety problem,'' Aloha
President A. Maurice Myers said Sunday.
   ``In fact, when queried by Aloha top management, Boeing
specifically declared that the four older planes were safe to
continue flying while the structural maintenance program was under
way,'' Myers said.
   Myers was responding to a published report that Boeing told
Aloha it needed a new maintenance program five months before part
of the fuselage of one of its Boeing 737s peeled off on April 28. A
cabin attendant was swept to her death and 61 of the other 94
people aboard were injured.
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that the Seattle-based
aircraft manufacturer advised the airline: ``Aloha has a
high-frequency flight schedule and operates in a highly corrosive
environment. These factors certainly contribute to the corrosion
and fatigue damage observed on the two airplane surveys.
   ``This as well as the practice of repainting the airplane before
and during inspections, deferring repairs and-or making temporary
instead of terminating (permanent) repairs, contributes to our
mutual concerns.''
   The airline was urged to develop a new maintenance program that
would ensure thorough and frequent inspections as well as
preventive maintenance on Aloha's aging planes, the Post said.
   Boeing spokesman Bill Clark confirmed the newspaper report. He
said his company had been communicating with Aloha Airlines as part
of an evaluation of its older planes, but he declined to comment on
the results of the evaluation or on Boeing's recommendations.
   Meanwhile, a new rule is under consideration that would for the
first time limit the number of flights planes can make in their
lifetimes, according to a report today in The New York Times. The
proposal centers on the number of flights that metal-fatigue tests
show a given type of aircraft can safely endure.
   Work on the rule, which began months ago, was speeded up after
the Aloha accident. The Boeing 737, built in 1969, had made 88,000
flights, and under the proposed rule it would have been taken out
of service before the accident.
