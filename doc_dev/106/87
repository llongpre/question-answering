   The search for victims of United
Airlines Flight 232 ended Saturday with the death toll tentatively
set at 110. United, meanwhile, announced it is visually inspecting
all engines in its DC-10 fleet.
   ``We feel comfortable enough that ... the search has been
terminated for victims,'' said Gary Brown, spokesman for the
Woodbury County Emergency Services.
   While officials were confident that all of the bodies had been
recovered, there still was disagreement on how many were killed
when the DC-10 jetliner cartwheeled and burned Wednesday at the
Sioux Gateway Airport. United said it was 110 and the National
Transportation Safety Board said it was 111.
   But a NTSB spokesman, Ted Lopatkiewicz, said at a news briefing
late Saturday the agency was ``deferring to United. That doesn't
mean we agree. United is the authority on this.''
   A list compiled by The Associated Press of names supplied by
United Airlines and family, friends and employers of the victims
had put the toll of dead and missing at 111. But two people listed
with the same last name and slightly different first names were
determined to be the same person.
   A doctor at one of the hospitals treating the injured said more
patients could die and that the survivors might have permanent
injuries. Of the 296 people on board, 186 survived.
   At the news briefing Saturday evening, NTSB spokesman Jim
Burnett said the parts of rear No. 2 engine that disintegrated
during a flight from Denver to Chicago were well within the limits
of time in which they had to be replaced.
   Burnett also said investigators interviewed Flight 232's second
officer Saturday, flight engineer Dudley Dvorak. Dvorak told
inspectors he reported complete loss of fluid in all three
hydraulic lines after the rear engine blew apart, leaving Capt. Al
C. Haynes without control of wings or tail surfaces.
   In another development, a United Airlines official said at a
news conference here that the airline has initiated ``a visual
inspection of all engines in our DC-10 fleet. A prudent person
would do some additional looking and we are.''
   James Guyette, executive vice president of operations for
United, said the inspections should be completed on Monday.
   So far, they have uncovered ``very, very minor'' flaws, he said,
adding that DC-10 airplanes in the United fleet are not being
grounded during the check.
   In Chariton, Iowa, meanwhile, an Amtrak train carrying survivors
of the United flight struck and killed a 6-year-old boy as the
youngster tried to free his bicycle that was stuck on the tracks.
   Jason Lee Howie was struck by Amtrak's eastbound California
Zephyr after the train had picked up several crash survivors at
Omaha, Neb., said Amtrak spokesman Art Lloyd, who added that he did
not know how many survivors were on board.
   In Sioux City, the wreckage of the wide-body jet remained
sprawled over the airport Saturday as NTSB crews sifted wreckage
for clues to what caused the tail engine to disintegrate in flight.
   NTSB spokesman Burnett said four cranes were moved in to steady
a giant hunk of fuselage in the cornfield next to the runway.
Inspectors were able to determine that no bodies were underneath,
he said.
   So far, the airline has positively identified 19 dead and
tentatively identified 29, and hopes to have 80 percent of the
bodies positively identified by Sunday, Guyette said. ``Great care
has to be exercised to make sure a mistake is not made,'' he said.
   Forty-five people were still hospitalized Saturday. Nineteen,
including four in critical condition, were at St. Luke's Medical
Center and 26, including five listed as critical, were at the
Marian Health Center. Marian confirmed that one patient had died
there overnight but would not give a name.
   Dr. Larry Foster, medical director for the burn unit at St.
Luke's, said they have 10 patients in the unit, who have burns from
2 percent to 93 percent of their bodies. Most suffered burns on
face and extremities.
   All four members of the flight crew, including one off-duty
pilot who left his seat in the cabin and to help in the effort to
control the plane, were being treated at Marian. Their injuries
were not critical, according to spokeswoman Jennifer Denning.
   Brown said there was no need to look for other victims at the
airport. ``The numbers match, the numbers balance,'' he said.
   Dr. Mike Wolpert, director of trauma services at Marian, said
the five patients in critical condition are still in danger.
``They're not stable by any means,'' he said.
   ``There are a lot of broken necks and broken backs. Some of them
might be permanently disabled. Some of them have definite brain
swelling now but it's going to be quite a while before we know if
that damage is going to be permanent.''
   He said patients listed in serious or guarded condition have
multiple fractures but are not in life-threatening condition. A
large number of them, he said, have ankle injuries.
   The airport is open but large pieces of the doomed jet are
strewn over the area. Still in a cornfield is the large piece of
the fuselage from which survivors were able to crawl to safety, and
the charred remains of the tail section, which flipped over the
other wreckage as the plane broke up.
   ``There's a lot of documentation left to be done,'' said NTSB
spokesman Ted Lopatkiewicz, declining to predict when investigators
would leave the scene. ``It takes a long time to document an
aircraft as big as this.''
   The drama of the final moments in the cockpit was detailed
Friday as Burnett said the off-duty pilot, hearing the explosion in
engine No. 2, bolted to the cockpit to see if he could help.
   Burnett said the off-duty pilot, identified as Dennis Fitch,
found the airplane nearly unmanageable since the tail engine
apparently threw wreckage through the airplane's hydraulic systems.
   Without control of wings or tail surfaces, the pilots' only
recourse was to crudely steer the plane by varying the thrust of
the two remaining engines.
   ``The only control mechanism that the crew had was to use engine
thrust,'' Burnett said. The off-duty pilot ``was on his knees
manipulating the throttle.''
   ``What you have here is a situation of two men desperately
trying to get whatever control they can out of the aircraft,'' he
said.
   Seven minutes before he attempted an emergency landing at Sioux
Gateway Airport, pilot Al C. Haynes told the control tower,
``Whatever you do, keep us away from the city,'' Burnett quoted
Haynes as telling investigators during two one-hour interviews on
Friday. The airport is about seven miles from downtown.
   The crew also found that the airplane would only turn right,
further hindering efforts to line up with a runway.
