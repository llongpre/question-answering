   The Federal Election Commission said Wednesday
that two fund-raising committees for former House Speaker Jim
Wright accepted an illegal contribution from a Texas businessmen
later imprisoned in connection with the savings and loan scandal.
   FEC spokesman Scott Moxley said Wright's principal fund-raising
committee and his leadership political action committee have agreed
to pay penalties totaling $1,500 to settle the case.
   At issue was Wright's use of a chartered airplane that
crisscrossed Texas between June 30 and July 2, 1985, to promote a
``Cowtown Jamboree'' in Fort Worth. The fund-raiser sought $1
million for Wright's principal campaign committee, the Wright
Appreciation Committee, and his leadership PAC, the Majority
Congress Committee.
   Wright, a Fort Worth Democrat who was House majority leader at
the time, was on his way to Haiti Wednesday and could not be
reached for comment, a spokesman said.
   Under the conciliation agreement, the two committees
acknowledged they accepted an illegal contribution from the owner
of the plane, Kenneth C. Hood, and that they failed to disclose the
receipt of the contribution. The committees also acknowledged a
violation stemming from the way they repaid Hood for the use of the
plane 46 months later, Moxley said.
   Wright repaid Hood $8,050 in April 1989, in the midst of a House
ethics committee investigation that led to his resignation a month
later. At the time, Wright said the failure to pay the bill was an
``oversight.''
   Hood had purchased the plane from Sunbelt Savings Association, a
failed thrift in Dallas, through a $1.3 million loan from Sunbelt.
Hood owed Sunbelt Savings $90 million by the end of 1986, the FEC
said.
   Hood told the FEC that Edwin McBirney, then owner of Sunbelt
Savings Association, said Wright needed the airplane, and that
McBirney promised that he and Thomas M. Gaubert, owner of another
S&amp;L, would pay for the trip.
   After the flight, Hood said McBirney and Gaubert told him that
it would be a ``positive gesture'' to absorb some of the costs,
Moxley said. Hood then billed them $8,050, two-thirds of the actual
cost, Moxley said.
   Gaubert told the FEC he was merely a passenger on the flight and
was not connected to the campaign committee or to Hood, Moxley
said. McBirney denied he pressured Hood to let Wright use the jet.
   Gaubert, whose S&amp;L was closed by state regulators in 1987, had
persuaded Wright to intervene with federal regulators on behalf of
the Irving-based thrift, Independent American Savings Association.
   FEC's general counsel had recommended that the commission find
Wright violated the law because he was on the airplane, but the FEC
found no reason to believe that was the case. The commission also
said it had no reason to believe McBirney or Gaubert paid for any
costs of the flight.
   The commission, however, said it found reason to believe Hood
made excess, illegal contributions to Wright.
   Hood was sentenced Feb. 15, 1990, to two years in prison and
fined $50,000 for making false statements to a federally insured
institution - Sunbelt Savings. He also was sentenced to five years'
probation and fined another $50,000 for conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service.
   McBirney was indicted in July on 17 counts alleging bank fraud,
misappropiation of funds, false entries and making false
statements to regulators.
