<F P=106> [Article by Jean Dupont: "Rafale's Mission Equipment Begins </F>
to Take Shape"; first paragraph is AIR &amp; COSMOS/AVIATION 
MAGAZINE INTERNATIONAL introduction] 
  [Text] The No. 5 RBE2 and No. 1 SPECTRA countermeasures 
prototypes have just been delivered. The Front Sector Optronics 
will not fly until 1996. 
  As of February, 1994, all the equipment that is part of the 
Rafale SU0 user standard now exists as a prototype. All except 
for the IFF (Identification Friend and Foe) 
interrogator/responder, which has experienced delays. State 
agencies waited until the 11th hour for NATO to define the 
future NIS (NATO Identification System) friend/foe 
identification standard, so that the Rafale would be 
interoperable with the next generation of allied force equipment 
as soon as it goes into service. 
  But by late 1992, alliance member states had not reached a 
consensus on the NIS standard, and the General Weapons 
Delegation (DGA) decided to launch the equipment based on the 
IFF Mk XII standard. The latter can interrogate and identify in 
"secure" encrypted modes, but does not offer the jamming 
resistance or frequency-hopping ability the NIS promises. 
Thomson-CSF (CNI division) has been selected to develop the 
equipment, and plans to deliver the first prototype by the end 
of the year. 
  The system settled on, however, will still constitute a 
significant innovation with its totally new pair of antennas 
shaped like a section of the system's front cone. The choice of 
electron-scanning for the Rafale's radar antenna makes such a 
configuration necessary. 
  Development of the RBE2 (2-plane Electron-Scanning Radar) 
was 
awarded to Thomson-CSF (RCM division) and Dassault Electronique 
in April 1989. Official departments recently accepted the fifth 
RBE2 prototype, out of a total of 10 to be delivered as part of 
the development program. The radar's equipment design has been 
frozen since the fourth prototype. The first four prototypes are 
taking turns participating in the flight tests that began in 
July, 1992, on a Mystere 20 belonging to CEV (Flight Test 
Center). Since then, the RBE2s have logged in some 30 hours of 
flight, including 20 on the Mystere 20, 10 on Rafale (B01 since 
last July, and M02 now), and three outings on a Mirage 2000 test 
bench. This may not seem like much next to the nearly 2,000 
flight hours the RBE2 qualification program will rack up by 1998. 
  [But], say Rafale program officials at the DGA, "The small 
number of flight hours proves that the radar works well." 
Elements verified to date--essentially the proper functioning of 
ancillary equipment and the radar's raw performances (such as 
the measurement of air-to-air range on a calibrated 
target)--have not presented CEV experimenters with any 
unpleasant surprises. However, following catapult launches at 
the Patuxent River base in the United States, program engineers 
decided to reinforce the radar's carrier structure. The decision 
did not affect plans for industrialization, which should begin 
toward the middle of this year. 
  Test flights of the radar are scheduled to be stepped up 
very 
gradually, explains the DGA, as tracking algorithms, electronic 
countermeasures, and new possibilities offered by the antenna's 
design develop. Indeed, the radar's electron scanning operating 
modes can be changed instantaneously, and even intertwined, 
which will generate both huge signal flows for analysis and an 
equal number of algorithms for comparison with real flights. 
  Rather surprisingly, these tests will culminate in 1997-98, 
after the Rafale (and its radar) goes into service in the Navy. 
There is a good reason for this, namely, the fact that the 
operating modes which generate the most data, and consequently 
require the most flight hours, are air-to-surface modes. That 
is, the modes that are of greatest interest to the Air Force. 
  SPECTRA (Rafale Fire-Control Protection and Avoidance 
System) 
mission equipment follows the radar in the Rafale integration 
plan. Development of the first countermeasures system to be 
entirely (including chaff-launchers) borne inside a French 
airplane got underway in March, 1990, at three subcontractors: 
Thomson-CSF, Dassault Electronique, and Matra Defense. 
  SPECTRA is at a turning point in its development program, 
now 
that its first prototype is undergoing acceptance tests at 
Thomson-CSF's Bretigny sur Orge Flight Test Center in a Paris 
suburb. These trials are significant, for SPECTRA will have to 
be able to process all electromagnetic spectrum bands, from air 
defense radars to the millimetric or infrared homing heads of 
anti-air missiles and the laser signals of so-called "beam 
rider" missile fire control systems. In addition, SPECTRA will 
have to be able to selectively jam several transmitters 
simultaneously. 
  When ground tests are complete, SPECTRA will be ready for a 
first test flight scheduled for next summer. Mass production of 
the system will not begin until after the results of the first 
flights are analyzed. 
  Meanwhile, SPECTRA component devices have been showing up, 
one after the other, on the fuselage of various Rafale 
prototypes. Atop the tail fin, for instance, a fairing sports 
one antenna pointed forward and another toward the rear; two 
MDDs (SAT-made Missile Departure Detectors) on either side; and 
an LAD (Laser Alert Detector made by Thomson-TRT-Defense) that 
covers the aft of the airplane. Two other LADs will also be 
mounted in the front of the fuselage. Four antennas are now 
visible, two at the canard roots and two under the engine air 
intakes. Equipped with solid-state transmitters, the antennas 
constitute a phase array that can channel jamming into a narrow 
cone, making it more efficient than transmissions via the fixed 
aerial of current-generation jammers. 
  The DGA is shortly expected to launch a program dubbed 
Electronic Warfare Programming System (EWPS), concurrently with 
SPECTRA. The EWPS is a ground device that will tune SPECTRA's 
modes and operating sequences, and select them during mission 
preparation based on the specific radar threats the aircraft is 
likely to encounter. The program will aim to establish a 
database on the effectiveness of countermeasures; generate 
mission preparation libraries; and validate those libraries 
through digital or hybrid simulations. 
  As for the Front Sector Optronics (FSO), the two partners in 
charge of the program, Thomson-TRT-Defense (TTD) and SAT, are 
working on it at their facilities. Development of the FSO got 
underway in May 1992; the system is expected to go into service 
around 2000 with the Rafale's SU2 standard. 
  The two manufacturer subcontractors are studying how to 
integrate the FSO into the aircraft's other radar sensors and 
countermeasures. (SAT is handling watch and infrared detection 
functions; TTD is in charge of laser telemetry, TV imagery, and 
the electronics unit). After acceptance of the first prototypes, 
scheduled for 1996, the FSO will make its first flight tests.
