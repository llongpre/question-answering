   Radcliffe College has given the Smithsonian
Institution a set of the papers of Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix
whose legend endures more than a half-century after she disappeared
into the Pacific skies.
   Earhart's letters to her mother, telegrams of congratulations
from admirers and quack theories that she is still living somewhere
on an isolated Pacific reef are among the 11 reels of microfilm
given to Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in a ceremony
Tuesday evening.
   ``To think that I'm standing here looking right at her airplane
is very special to me,'' said Patricia King, director of
Radcliffe's Schlesinger library. She said the papers, donated
during the 1960s by Earhart's sister, are among the most prized at
the university.
   ``They attract the attention of scholars and students. We get
letters from sixth graders from the Midwest who want to know more
about Amelia Earhart,'' King said.
   In 1932 Earhart gained worldwide fame by becoming the first
woman to cross the Atlantic alone. That same year she also became
the first to fly cross-country alone. And in January 1935 Earhart
made the first solo flight by anyone from Honolulu to the U.S.
mainland.
   Earhart's bright red Lockheed Vega 5-B used in the
trans-Atlantic and cross-country flights, along with her flight
jacket and radio, are on display at the museum.
   ``The project involved a gamble but gambling is a human frailty
and I suppose there is a certain extra fascination in playing for
high stakes,'' Earhart wrote in an article contained in the
collection. ``The stakes on this throw, of course, was my life
against the joy of doing something I wanted to do very much.''
   Earhart often discussed the subject of courage and declared
women at least the equal of men. She insisted that women should
have the same freedoms as men and, in a speech to the Daughters of
the American Revolution in 1933, said women should be drafted in
war along with men.
   She worried publicly about ``becoming a heavy-handed feminist''
but accepted the label, saying, ``I become increasingly weary of
male superiority unquestioned.''
   Earhart's disappearance over the Pacific while attempting a
round-the-world flight in 1937 turned a popular heroine into a cult
figure shrouded in mystery.
   The fate of the beautiful, dashing flier remains the stuff of
tabloid headlines. A favorite theory, one detailed in
correspondence included in the Earhart collection, is that she was
captured and executed by the Japanese. Most scholars accept the
more mundane hypothesis that she ran out of gas.
   ``At this point it really doesn't matter how she died except to
satisfy the morbidly curious,'' said Fay Gillis Wells, a veteran
pilot who flew together with Earhart. ``I hope she went quickly the
way she always wanted to go.''
