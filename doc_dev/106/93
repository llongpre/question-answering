   The jumbo jet had been in the air for only 16
minutes when mayday came crackling over the radio from United
Flight 811 high over the Pacific: ``We've gotta come back ... We
had a bomb or something go off in the airplane ... trying to get
back to the airport.''
   So began 25 of the most harrowing minutes in the life of Capt.
David Cronin, his copilot, Al Salder and more than 300 other crew
and passengers aboard the United Airlines jetliner last Feb. 24.
   There was no bomb, although the pilots were all but certain one
had exploded. But a 10-foot hole had ripped open on the side of the
aircraft cabin, sweeping nine passengers to their deaths at 22,000
feet.
   A glimpse of the drama was provided Wednesday when the Federal
Aviation Administration released tapes of radio communications
between Flight 811 and air traffic controllers in Honolulu.
   For the most part Salder was believed to be at the microphone
with Cronin fighting to keep the hugh Boeing 747 jetliner aloft,
although FAA officials said it was unclear who was speaking during
certain exchanges.
   What was clear, however, is that more than once the pilots _ as
well as controllers monitoring and directing them _ feared the jet
would plunge into the Pacific. The pilots repeatedly sought to be
assured they were being tracked by radar so a rapid water rescue
mission could be launched if necessary.
   The jet, bound for Auckland, New Zealand with 354 people aboard,
was awaiting clearance to climb to a normal 30,000 feet cruising
altitude and was only 16 minutes out of Honolulu when the tragedy
struck.
   ``We're at, ah, mayday. We've gotta come back. We had a bomb or
something go off in the airplane. Ah, we're making a one-eighty
trying to get back to the airport,'' came the first emergency call
from the cockpit.
   Seconds later, the crew provided the first indication of the
seriousness of the problem.
   ``We don't know what's going on. Ah, looks like we've lost No. 3
engine and we're descending rapidly, ah, coming back,'' the pilot
reported.
   It would be another 25 minutes before the jumbo jet would be
resting in the middle of Runway 8 Left at the Honolulu airport and
the pilot reporting, ``United Eight Eleven heavy, We're evacuating
the airplane.''
   About six minutes after the incident began, Cronin apparently
had begun getting better control of the aircraft after descending
to 9,000 feet.
   ``It appears that we've, ah, we have lost No. 3 engine and we've
lost ... we're not getting full power out of No. 4. We're, ah, not
able to hold an altitude right now. We're dumping fuel, so I think
we're gonna be able to hold an altitude shortly,'' the pilots
reported as the crippled plane continue its limp to land with 60
miles still to go.
   The pilots remained convinced a bomb had gone off.
   ``It looks like we got a bomb, ah, that went off on the right
side, ah. The whole right side is gone,'' the copilot told
controllers as the jet was at 4,000 feet and descending. There now
was a fire in one engine and 45 miles still to go before any
opportunity to land.
   ``So, ah, you watch us,'' the pilot pleaded to controllers.
   ``United 811, I have you on radar,'' the controller assured the
crew.
   As the Boeing 747 flew closer to land, air traffic control began
to provide directions to line the jet up for an approach, but the
pilots still could not see the airport _ and that worried them.
   ``We should have the airport, but we don't,'' came the voice
from the cockpit.
   In the Honolulu tower, controllers were not sure the plane would
make it.
   A controller directed the Honolulu rescue center to hold a
helicopter on the ground for the time being, but prepared to fly.
   ``If you see (Flight 811) go down ... in the water or on land or
something then you can sent a helicopter right out there,'' the
unnamed controller advised the rescue center, breaking for a moment
away from directing Flight 811 in for a landing.
   ``OK. We've got the island in sight ... but we don't show the
airport,'' said the pilot as the struggling jet flew within 11
miles of the airport just under 4,000 feet in the air.
   The runway lights were turned up to full power and the
controller assured the pilots his radar showed them with enough
altitude to clear land.
   ``OK. We have the airport now,'' finally came word from the jet.
   Less than two minutes later the jumbo jet with the massive hole
on its side touched ground.
   ``United Eight Eleven heavy, we're evacuating the airplane,''
reported the pilot.
   The controller who guided the jetliner then described the scene:
   ``He's on the ground midfield ... everybody's jumping out of the
airplane Emergency vehicles all over the place. ... He's on the
ground ... big hole in the right cargo door _ I mean a big hole.
... (He) came in with two engines.''
