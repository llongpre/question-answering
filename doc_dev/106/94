   Engine inspections and design modifications are
being ordered for the DC-10 following an Iowa crash that killed 112
people, but top aviation and safety officials still say the
wide-body jetliner is safe.
   A congressional transportation subcommittee summoned the heads of
the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Transportation
Safety Board and a McDonnell Douglas vice president Tuesday to
discuss the trouble-plagued airliner.
   All said DC-10s are safe _ as safe as any other wide-body jet _
and there is no reason to ground the more than 400 in service.
   Within hours after the hearing, there was another incident
involving a DC-10. The French airline UTA said a bomb most likely
caused the crash of one of its DC-10s carrying 171 people from
N'Djamena, Chad, to Paris. The scattered wreckage was found in
south-central Niger and there was no word on survivors.
   FAA Administrator James B. Busey announced to the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation subcommittee an order to
inspect the fan disks of 220 DC-10 engines similar to the one
investigators believe failed prior to the July 19 crash of a United
DC-10 in Sioux City, Iowa, that killed 112 people.
   James Kolstad, safety board chairman, told the same hearing that
a DC-10 modification recommended by aircraft builder McDonnell
Douglas last week should be made mandatory for all of the jetliners.
The manufacturer said the change would prevent the loss of all
hydraulic flight controls which occurred before the July 19 United
Flight 232 crash in Iowa.
   Kolstad said DC-10s and other wide-body airliners are among ``the
safest airplanes in history.''
   The subcommittee chairman, Sen. Wendell H. Ford, D-Ky., said the
hearing was called to get reassurances that the government is
adequately policing safety of the DC-10.
   Busey described several government and industry groups set up to
look into possible improvements for the DC-10 and other airliners.
   ``At the outset I believe it is important that I assure you and
the public that the FAA considers the DC-10 to be a safe aircraft,''
the administrator said, adding that there was no reason to ground
the airliner.
   Busey said that although investigators had not determined what
caused the explosive engine failure in the Iowa crash, one possible
scenario is the development of a crack in the engine fan disk ``as
the result of an internal flaw in the disk material itself.''
   Inspections ordered by the FAA cover all General Electric CF6-6
engines built for the DC-10 using a ``double-vacuum'' melt process
during the formation of titanium material from which the rotor disks
are forged.
   ``The (inspection order) is needed to identify and remove from
service Stage 1 fan disks which may have metallurgical
imperfections. Such imperfections can adversely affect the service
life of the disk,'' the FAA said.
   FAA officials earlier said a microscopic flaw was found in
analysis of six engines built from the same metal used in the Iowa
DC-10.
   Busey said 55 engines would be inspected by Nov. 21, and the
remaining 165 before February 4.
   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings, D-S.C., questioned the timetable,
calling for the FAA to say what is being done ``to minimize the
risks that those aircraft in operation pose until they clear FAA
inspections.''
   Kolstad said the safety board's investigations into DC-10
accidents ``to date have uncovered no common thread that would
suggest a fundamental design flaw of the airplane.''
   He said there is nothing to indicate that the DC-10's operating
history is significantly different from that of other wide-body
transport airplanes.
   ``While, in retrospect, all of these airplanes may have benefited
from some design improvements, their operating records have placed
them among the safest airplanes in history,'' he said.
