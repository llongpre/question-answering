  [Text] Civil aviation is going through difficult times in 
Russia today. The principal indicator of this is the decline in 
the volume of air service on domestic routes. However, according 
to predictions by specialists, stabilization of the effective 
demand for air transport should take place by the end of 1995, 
after which it is expected to increase at the rate of about 6 
percent annually. The 1992 level may be reached by the year 
2000. With respect to the more distant future, the requirements 
for air transport in 2010 may reach 200 to 230 billion 
passenger-kilometers, that is, they will exceed the highest 
level of 1990 (159 billion passenger-kilometers). 
  Naturally, the question arises whether it will be possible 
to 
meet the effective demand for air service with the fleet of 
airplanes and helicopters that is available. Analysis shows that 
roughly by the beginning of 1998, airlines will not be able to 
cope with the transportation volume unless they undertake 
substantial renovation of their fleet of aircraft. 
  However, this is not a simple process, as we know. It 
requires sizable material outlays, which far from all air 
carriers can afford. For this reason, one of the conditions for 
survival of the sector in recent years has been solution of the 
problem of maintenance on the airplanes and helicopters in 
operation. The State Civil Aviation Scientific Research 
Institute has conducted a great deal of work, as the result of 
which the service life of Il-62M, Tu-154B, and Tu-134A airplanes 
and Mi-2 and Mi-8 helicopters has been extended. Some 490 
million rubles [R] were spent on this work, producing an 
efficiency valued at R118 billion. If this work had not been 
conducted, 11 percent fewer Il-62M, 7 percent fewer Tu-154B, and 
42.5 percent fewer Tu-134A aircraft would have been operating on 
air routes in 1994. 
  Nevertheless, the problem of replacing obsolete aircraft 
with 
new ones has not lost its urgency. Resolving it means 
maintaining the competitiveness of domestic airlines not only in 
the world air service market, but the domestic market as well. 
  What does our fleet of civil aircraft consist of today? 
Roughly 1,650 mainline aircraft. At the same time, 80 percent of 
mainline routes are being served by aircraft which are operating 
beyond the limits of their initially assigned service life. By 
1996 we will have to write off 12 to 15 percent of the mainline 
aircraft, and by the year 2000, more than half of them. Some 20 
percent of mainline flights are made in "modern" Il-86, Yak-42, 
and Tu-154M aircraft which have been in operation for over 10 
years and have become outdated. 
  Our fleet of aircraft includes several thousand airplanes 
for 
local air routes, the overwhelming majority of which are An-2's. 
There are 2,100 helicopters, 97 percent of which are obsolete 
Mi-8's and Mi-2's. 
  The serviceability of the aircraft is not up to standards. 
For example, the degree of serviceability of the fleet of Il-86 
aircraft is 56 percent, whereas the norm is 66 percent. The 
annual flying time of one mainline aiurcraft is no more than an 
average of 2,000 hours. The best of the aircraft on local 
routes--the L-410 and An-28--are actually idle because they lack 
spare parts. 
  So in this state of affairs, the answer to the question of 
whether or not we need to update our domestic fleet of aircraft 
is unequivocal. And the renovation has already begun. We can 
even name a speific date--14 July 1993, when the Il-96-300 made 
its first scheduled flight. But the renovation process was begun 
roughly 5 years late... 
  The principal types of airplanes and helicopters which 
should 
replace the obsolete aircraft have been more or less determined. 
They include the long-range mainline aircraft--the Il-96-300 and 
its modifications, the Tu-204-300D, and in the more distant 
future, the Il-96-200 and the Tu-304; the medium-range mainline 
aircraft--the Tu-204 and its modifications and the An-218; and 
the short-range mainline aircraft--the Tu-334-100, Il-114M, and 
Yak-242. In the cargo aircraft class, they include new 
modifications of the Il-76, the An-70T or Tu-330, the 
5-metric-ton MiG-110 or the Tu-130, and cargo versions of the 
Il-96, Tu-204, and Il-114. 
  In the near future, the Il-114 and its modifications, the 
An-38, or the Be-32 will be available for local air routes. 
Later on a new type of aircraft may make its appearance--a 
regional 40- to 50-seat aircraft with a turbojet engine which 
will take its place between the much slower Il-114 and the much 
more spacious Tu-334 on routes of up to 2,500 kilometers with 
relatively low passenger flows. We are linking development of 
the helicopter fleet with the appearance of helicopters such as 
the Mi-38, Mi-34VAZ, Mi-26K, Mi-54, and Ka-62. 
  The objective requirements to update Russian airlines' fleet 
of aircraft as a whole are so great that it is hard to say which 
classes of new airplanes and helicopters may turn out to be 
unnecessary and may not find their place in this market. At 
present, there are design proposals for dozens of new aircraft 
for business flights, general aviation, and various classes of 
load-carrying capacity. 
  But this is a potential market. The real market is 
determined 
not so much by an objective requirement as by actual effective 
demand. In order to characterize this market, we will cite 
several figures. In 1993 the various airlines and enterprises in 
Russia purchased 182 new aircraft: 71 airplanes and 111 
helicopters for a total of more than R250 billion. State 
investments account for a little more than 10 percent of this 
sum, and the funds of enterprises and local financing sources 
account for the remainder. Some 60 percent of all airplanes and 
helicopters, including 12 Tu-154M aircraft, were acquired by 
nonstate enterprises for operation, leasing, and resale. 
  At the same time, many state airlines do not have enough 
money to obtain their own aircraft after repair. At the end of 
1993, 50 airplanes and 80 helicopters were in repair plants. 
They had been repaired, but were not redeemed: the airlines owe 
a total of R12 billion to the repair plants. 
  The appearance this year of aircraft manufactured in the 
West, the Boeing 737 in particular, is a very important factor. 
It attests to the beginning of a fundamentally new stage in th 
development of Russian civil aviation--real competition between 
domestic and foreign aircraft in the domestic market. And this 
ought to be viewed very seriously. 
  The point is that the prices of aircraft being turned out by 
Russian plants are already close to those being asked for 
Western aircraft which have been in use. For example, in June 
1993, the price of a Tu-154M was about R3 billion. Today it is 
over R6 billion. At the same time, according to the Western 
press, more than eight or 10 DC-9 aircraft of various 
modifications which were formerly in use were offered for sale 
or lease in July and August 1993 from 750,000 U.S. dollars 
(DC-98-10-20)[sic; presumably figure should be "9," not "98"] to 
$6.2 million (DC-9-50), that is, an average of $2 million to $3 
million. At that time, when the average monthly lease was about 
1 percent of the price of the aircraft, airlines would have paid 
$20,000 to $30,000 per month for a lease. Raising this by a 
factor of 1.5 to take into account the expenses for spare parts, 
inasmuch as the aircraft are not new, we obtain $30,000 to 
$45,000 per month. With the existing rates for passenger and 
cargo services, operation of these aircraft with a profitability 
level of up to 30 percent is entirely realistic. And their 
advantages in fuel efficiency (25 grams per passenger-kilometer, 
compared with 30 grams per passenger-kilometer for the most 
economical domestic aircraft, the Tu-154M), reliability, the 
opportunity to fly 6 to 10 hours per day, the organized system 
of technical support, and so forth make these aircraft very 
attractive for Russian airlines. Operation of the DC-9 aircraft 
also opens the way for newer and more advanced aircraft of the 
MD-91 (82-88) type, which are now being offered at $15 million 
to $24 million. 
  The new nature of the aircraft market also determines the 
new 
emphasis on technical and economic requirements for Russian 
aircraft and the relationships between buyers and sellers. 
  High fuel efficiency continues to be the principle 
requirement for new aircraft at present, inasmuch as it makes it 
possible to substantially reduce expenses for aviation fuel, 
both in absolute and comparative measurement. 
  The next most important requirements are reliability and 
safety, the service life, and the efficiency of ways and means 
of monitoring the condition of the aircraft in operation, 
inasmuch as this combination of characteristics determines the 
ability to reach a high level in the turnover rate of financial 
resources and in prevention of potential losses in aircraft 
accidents and incidents. 
  Establishment of a system of after-sale support for an 
airline by the manufacturing plant is an important condition; 
this includes training of crews and technical personnel, 
providing the necessary equipment for technical maintenance 
bases, a steady supply of spare parts, and so forth. And a 
requirement that is even more important is an acceptable price 
and payment conditions. 
  All these requirements should be stipulated and coordinated 
in the contract for delivery of an airplane or helicopter. The 
contract should also provide for the economic responsibility of 
the supplier to the buyer for any loss to the latter as the 
result of failure to meet the requirements agreed upon, as well 
as an efficient system of arbitration or legal solution to 
conflicts. 
  The State Civil Aviation Scientific Research Institute 
considers its duty to provide for maximum possible efficiency in 
the process of updating the fleet of aircraft. To achieve this, 
the plans for its work include comprehensive studies on the 
certification of new airplanes and helicopters; the development 
of updated national aviation regulations, combined with the 
standards in effect in other countries; analysis of Russian 
airlines' requirements for new aircraft; study of the domestic 
market for the sale of aircraft manufacturers' output; and 
determination of the most efficient use of funds being allocated 
from the state budget to develop aviation equipment. In order to 
determine precisely what the requirements are for aviation 
equipment and the air carriers' requirement for one type of 
aircraft or another, the institute distributes specially 
developed questionnaires to aviation enterprises and airlines 
each year. It is very unfortunate that certain managers in local 
areas are in no hurry to respond. 
  Russian civil aviation is still a long way from a real 
market. But we have already familiarized ourselves with certain 
elements in a market economy and we realize: the market does not 
forgive blunders, it must be studied, and we need to prepare for 
it. So it turns out that the change in economic policy in the 
sector has coincided with another period of no less importance 
in its life: for replacing the obsolete equipment with new 
equipment. But there will be no directives from "the mighty 
person outside" today. By considering their own requirements and 
material capabilities, the airlines themselves will determine 
the types of aircraft, the number needed, and the conditions 
under which they may be obtained. By making the right choice, 
they not only strengthen their financial and economic activity, 
but they will be able to more fully meet the public's 
requirement for air service, and what is no less important, to 
impove the quality of these flights. But a mistake can cost them 
dearly. It is entirely possible that it may turn out to be their 
last one. Such are the laws of the market.
