   Not once in the 13 harrowing minutes it took
the crew of Aloha Airlines flight 243 to land the severly damaged
plane did co-pilot Madeline ``Mimi'' Tompkins doubt she and pilot
Robert Schornstheimer would keep control of the craft, she said
today.
   ``I didn't feel nervous,'' even though the crew saw sky through
the cockpit doorway, had one engine out and communicated with hand
signals because of the noise, Ms. Tompkins said on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America.''
   Schornstheimer said he struggled to fly the plane by ``feel,''
unaware that a 20-foot chunk of cabin ceiling had been shorn off
the Boeing 737, sweeping a stewardess to her death.
   ``Our whole emphasis was focused on feeling it, that it was
flyable, and being able to land it safely,'' he said in the
interview.
   The dramatic tape of the conversation between the crew and the
air traffic control tower at Maui, released Wednesday, shows Ms.
Tompkins' voice was strained but under control as the troubles
began on April 28.
   ``We have rapid decompression. We are unpressurized _ declaring
an emergency,'' she told the tower.
   Schornstheimer described the moment the roof was ripped away:
``All of a sudden there was this loud thump sound and debris was
flying everywhere in the cockpit. I turned around and looked out
the door and everything above shoulder level was blue sky.
   ``The cockpit door was blown off,'' he said. ``I didn't really
know how far the damage went, all I could see was blue sky.''
   Ms. Tompkins said ``training and experience'' took over as the
plane shook in the air and debris flew through the cockpit.
   ``We just immediately started into the things we're trained for,
getting on our oxygen masks and started down and making a decision
about where we wanted to land,'' said Schornstheimer.
   ``Mimi and I are both experienced even though we haven't flown
that much together. We just pointed and we both knew where we were
going and what we were doing and continued on with our normal
procedures,'' he said.
   The plane shook violently when the pilot dipped below a certain
speed, and the problems multiplied as the plane descended.
   ``Somewhere along that line we lost an engine, and we started
our auxiliary power unit and used the generator on it for part of
the electrical power on the airplane,'' said Schornstheimer.
   Adding to his concerns, Schornstheimer said in an interview
published in today's editions of USA Today, was the fact that, when
he looked through the open doorway into the main cabin, enough
pieces of flooring had been ripped up that the craft's control
cables were exposed.
   Ms. Tompkins, meanwhile, spoke coolly with the controllers as
the plane dipped below 11,000 feet and was cleared for a head-on
approach to the runway.
   ``We're going to need assistance. We cannot communicate with the
flight attendants. Ah, will (there) be assistance for the
passengers when we land?'' Ms. Tompkins asked the air traffic
control tower.
   Schornstheimer said after their initial shock on seeing the
plane after landing, he and Ms. Tompkins went on helping passengers
in the rescue operation.
   ``It did (fly). We were glad it hung together,'' he said. ``It
was just amazing to walk around the airplane after we landed and
look at it.''
   Hours before a tape of the radio transmissions was made public
Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration, the two pilots
received an award from the Air Line Pilots Association for landing
the crippled plane with all passengers and all but the one
stewardess safe.
   Earlier in the week, Ms. Tompkins and Schornstheimer had met
with Vice President George Bush and made the rounds at offices in
Congress. They declined to discuss the incident with reporters.
   ``What seemed like a short time to Mimi and me because of our
busy cockpit duties must have seemed like an eternity to our
passengers and flight attendants,'' Schornstheimer told fellow
pilots Wednesday while accepting the ALPA award.
   His co-pilot, Ms. Tompkins, praised the captain: ``Bob analyzed
the situation confronting us and he reacted. All of his decisions
were the right ones.''
   The two pilots said their ability to work as a team under
adverse conditions was key to bringing the Boeing 737 to a safe
landing.
   As bad as Flight 243's situation was, the tape showed that the
two pilots thought _ erroneously, it turned out _ that it was even
worse.
   According to the tape, the pilots were certain that for some
reason the nose landing gear was not deploying. This would have
made landing the already severely damaged aircraft especially
dangerous, according to aviation experts.
   ``Be advised we have no nose gear we are landing without a nose
gear,'' Ms. Tompkins told the Maui airport tower in a strained but
controlled voice as the plane headed toward the airport. ``We'll
need all the (emergency) equipment you got.''
   It is believed that a malfunctioning indicator light misled the
pilots into thinking the nose gear had not deployed.
   Only seconds before the plane set down on the runway did the
controller see that the nose gear actually had deployed and advised
the flight crew. Then the Boeing 737 landed, ambulances and fire
trucks waiting.
   Despite the experience, Ms. Tompkins told the ALPA gathering
Wednesday that she is ready to get back to the cockpit. ``I`m
looking forward to going back to Hawaii and flying again,'' she
said.
