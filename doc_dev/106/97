<HEAD>FAA Finds Some Fairchild Planes Prone to Mid-Flight Window Loss</HEAD>

   Owners of small passenger planes made by
Fairchild Aircraft Corp. have been ordered not to let passengers
sit by windows that may be prone to break in mid-flight.
   The Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness directive
issued Tuesday bars passengers from riding in seat ``2E'' on the
right side of the plane unless a double-paned window is installed.
   Horizon Air President John Kelly said Tuesday that double-pane
windows were being installed on the company's Fairchild Metro III
turboprop under a company decision made before the directive was
issued.
   The directive stems from an incident Saturday in which a window
broke on a Horizon flight between Portland, Ore., and Yakima,
leaving a hole an inch in diameter.
   Three weeks ago, a Portland man on a Horizon flight from
Portland to Seattle was partially sucked out of a Metro III when
the window by his seat _ 2E _ shattered about 14,000 feet over
Olympia.
   A similar incident occurred in Europe in 1988.
   ``The FAA has received three reports of the second passenger
window on the right side breaking in flight on Fairchild SA226 and
SA227 series airplanes. In each of these reports the airplane was
flying in icing conditions,'' the directive said.
   ``Ice shed from the propeller may have struck the window,
causing either holes or cracks. In two reports the weakened window
could not contain the cabin pressure, which resulted in rapid cabin
decompression.''
   Plane owners have 30 days to follow the directive. Until they
do, they must post signs at 2E saying: ``Do not occupy this seat at
any time.''
   Michele Owsley of the FAA in Texas said the problem of
mid-flight window breakage may be unique to Fairchild planes.
   She said concern was raised after a cockpit window blew out and
caused an injury in 1988. That incident resulted in an FAA order
for inspection of windows to check for cracks after every 2,500
hours of service, roughly five months.
   Bob Kennison, assistant to the president of Fairchild Aircraft
Corp., said Monday he did not know whether the company had more
window problems than other manufacturers of small passenger
airplanes.
