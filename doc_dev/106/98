   Four European nations will ban
commercial flights by Boeing Co.'s new 747-400 series jetliner
unless the U.S. company makes design changes to improve safety, a
Dutch spokesman said Tuesday.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplanes said it would discuss
certification with a Dutch regulatory official on Wednesday, one
day before the scheduled delivery of the first of 13 Boeing
747-400s to KLM, the Dutch state airliner.
   Transport Ministry spokesman Harald Hameleers said Boeing was
asked ``to implement some minor modifications in the 400 series'
design.''
   ``We think the 747-400 is a safe plane but there is always room
for improvement,'' he added.
   Hameleers said the Dutch demanded modifications ``months ago''
in concert with civil aviation agencies in Britain, West Germany
and France, which together form the Joint Airworthiness
Requirements committee.
   ``We will not issue a full certificate of airworthiness unless
Boeing adopts our requirements,'' Hameleer said in an interview.
   Alain Monnier, an official of France's Directorate General of
Civil Aviation, said the Netherlands spoke for all four member
countries. The committee meets in Paris on Monday to discuss
Boeing's response, Hameleers said.
   Boeing said in a statement that the company ``has worked hard to
satisfy'' certification requirements of the four-nation committee
on a derivative 747-400 airplane. It said the 747-400, the largest
commercial jetliner in the world, has received full certification
from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration.
   A representative of the Netherlands regulatory agency will meet
with Boeing to review certification of the 747-400 for operation by
KLM, the statement said.
   The statement said Boeing expected the plane would be delivered
on schedule after those discussions.
   KLM expects to receive its first 747-400 at Amsterdam's Schiphol
Airport on Thursday. The carrier has ordered 13 of the airplanes
costing an estimated $1.5 billion, according to KLM spokesman Peter
Wellhuener.
   At issue are changes in the design of floor beams supporting the
400 series' upper deck, and better separation of certain electrical
circuits, said Hameleers.
   ``It's nothing earth-shattering, but Boeing has been making
trouble on the issue,'' Hameleers said. He claimed the circuitry
changes could be made in a few hours, while the floor beam
modifications would ``probably require some study.''
   Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese was quoted by The Seattle
Times as saying that the upper-deck structure design was not part
of the FAA's certification process because it is built the same as
on previous 747 models.
   Wellhuener said the airline planned to use the new planes from
early June.
   The Dutch carrier was to be the first European airline to fly
the 747-400. Other European customers include British Airways, West
Germany's Lufthansa, and Air France.
