   Lockheed Corp.'s prototype
of a 21st century fighter jet made its first flight Saturday in a
winner-take-all competition for the multibillion-dollar Advanced
Tactical Fighter contract.
   The YF-22 was airborne just 18 minutes, taking off from Air
Force Plant 42 in Palmdale and ending 25 mile away at this desert
flight test center.
   The flight was a milestone in a high-stakes contest between an
aerospace team headed by Lockheed and a team led by Northrop Corp.
for 1,250 ATF jets, to be built at a projected cost of $51 million
per plane.
   The winner must produce a jet that is highly maneuverable, uses
radar-evading stealth technology and can fly twice the speed of
sound for long periods of time. The Air Force wants 750 of the new
planes and the Navy needs 500.
   Pilot Dave Ferguson said the YF-22 flew as expected although the
flight was shortened by 42 minutes because of problems at ground
telemetry stations.
   The jet burned so much fuel while sitting on the runway waiting
for takeoff that there wasn't enough left for the scheduled
one-hour flight.
   ``It was a very easy airplane to fly,'' said Ferguson, adding,
``I would be happy to put fuel in it and fly it this afternoon.''
   The jet reached an altitude of 12,500 feet and a speed of about
280 mph. The two-tone gray jet with stubby wings and a V-shaped
tail touched down smoothly in a light rain.
   The YF-22 was built by Lockheed, General Dynamics Corp. and
Boeing Co. It was unveiled in Palmdale Aug. 29, two days after the
YF-23, built by Northrop Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., made
its first flight.
   Lockheed Vice President Sherman Mullin, head of the YF-22
project, said he could not compare the two planes because he didn't
have enough information about the YF-23.
   Each team has spent about $600 million producing two prototype
jets each.
   ``It's obviously an extremely important program to us,'' said
Mullin. ``(But) it's not a program that's going to make or break
the Lockheed Corp.''
   Both planes are built of advanced composite materials. The
Lockheed aircraft has stubby wings. The Northrop fighter has a
longer, cigarlike fuselage and a wingspread that looks like a kite.
   ``This is a great day from a technological perspective,'' said
Gary L. Denman, who heads an Air Force research division. ``I can
assure you, what's out there in the airplane is the best in the
world.''
   Survival of the advanced fighter program was threatened by
Congress until Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. The crisis has
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense contracts.
   If Northrop and McDonnell Douglas win the contract, the YF-23
would be built in California. The Lockheed-General Dynamics-Boeing
team plans to build YF-22s in Marietta, Ga., if it wins. The
selection is due in 1991.
   The $51 million cost of each jet is about twice that of the Air
Force's present top fighter, the F-15 Eagle.
