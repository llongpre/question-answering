   The annual report of Southwest Airlines Co.
contains something that could raise a flap, or at least a couple
wings _ a paper airplane.
   ``This was one of those wonderful years when we made a lot of
money and it seemed to be we made a lot of money by getting back to
the basics, said Tim McClure, executive creative director of Austin
advertising agency GSD&amp;M, which designed the 1988 report.
   ``And we translated that to what we thought was the most basic
of all airplanes, the paper airplane.''
   The booklet, besides reporting on the regional airline's record
$57.95 million in profit, traces the construction of a paper
airplane from the first folding of the paper to the final painting
to resemble Shamu One, Southwest's ``flying whale'' jet rolled out
last year during the airline's promotion of Sea World theme parks
in Texas and California.
   ``You think every pre-schooler and first grader in Dallas will
want one?'' asked Southwest spokeswoman Charlotte Goddard. ``Or all
the CEOs?''
   Besides a picture of Chairman Herb Kelleher throwing a paper
airplane, the middle of the report features a four-page foldout
picture of Shamu One.
   On the back page, there's a punch-out version of the plane, with
assembly instructions and this ``helpful hint'':
   ``Herb attaches a paper clip to the nose for longer flights
(Shamu One's, not his).''

   Voters may be able to find neither rhyme
nor reason in the workings of state government, but the governor
hopes to change that. Louisiana is looking for a poet laureate.
   ``We are looking for someone like a (Carl) Sandburg, a T.S.
Eliot or a Robert Frost,'' Ray Beasley of the Department of
Culture, Recreation and Tourism said Monday.
   The state Arts Council is looking for a poet to serve as the
state's chief balladeer, extolling the virtues of Louisiana and the
state's ``literary excellence and understanding of the literary
arts,'' Beasley said.
   The position was created in 1942, but Louisiana has not had a
poet laureate since Jean M. Boese of Alexandria left office along
with Gov. Edwin Edwards in 1988.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer will name the poet after receiving
recommendations from the arts panel.
