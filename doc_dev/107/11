<LEADPARA>  Back in 1949, it remained to be seen if a little 16-page tabloid newspaper
could survive using no headlines, printing only "good" news and featuring
photographs of scenery.;   Could it survive in Sierra County, California's
second-smallest, in a tiny sawmill town that is not even the county seat? How
about if the publisher had no experience in journalism? And what if the paper
only came out every other week?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now, 42 years later, the experiment appears to be a success. Hal Wright is
still in business with his unique Sierra Booster.;   "It's hard work, but I
guess we've proved it can be done," said Wright one recent afternoon in his
office a half block off Loyalton's main drag.;   "We just figured we'd do it
our own way and see if it wouldn't work," said Wright, who left a factory job
in the Bay Area to try journalism."It looked like a good way to get out of the
city, earn a living for ourselves in the mountains.";   For the paper's first
30 years or so, all the type was set by Wright's wife, Allene, on an electric
typewriter. Each line had to be typed twice to determine the spacing between
letters and words to make all the lines the same length.;   In recent times, a
desk-top computer has eased that chore. Otherwise, the paper is largely
unchanged and it has never missed its two-week publishing cycle.;   "I
remember one time, though, in that heavy winter of 1952, when I had to ski
over Yuba Pass to get the paper to the printers. I'd never been on skis
before. Took me 2 1/2 days to make it," Wright recalled.;   It was the next
year, he said, when he decided the Booster should own an airplane. He bought a
1948 Aeronca Sedan, took flying lessons, and began delivering the paper by
airplane on occasion.;   ". . . When I have time I like to take off and fly
around the valley here, see how many papers I can get on porches, throwing
them from the plane," he said.;   Flying in the remote area is fun, he said,
especially when the snow is heavy enough to use skis. "Then you can land and
take off anywhere.";   It is adventurous, too. Once his engine failed and he
made it to the airport with only enough altitude to clear the fence at the end
of the runway by barely a foot.;   Wright, a youthful 87, continues to fly and
belongs to the UFOs -- United Flying Octogenarians, a 97-member international
organization of licensed pilots in their 80s.;   He said he has slowed down in
recent years. For the past 10 years, daughter Jan Buck has taken over more and
more of the paper's chores from her parents. And three heart operations this
year caused Wright to lose 15 pounds.  </TEXT>
