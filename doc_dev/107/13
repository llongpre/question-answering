   The first ``stealth'' test of Northrop's
flying-wing jet bomber was a remarkable success. Trouble was, four
decades ago, nobody much cared.
   Shortly before the Air Force canceled its order for the strange
YB-49, the late 1940s forerunner to the B-2, Northrop test pilot Max
Skelton flew a grand tour of air defense stations in the West.
   ``Nobody found him _ until he was directly overhead,'' says
flying-wing historian Tim Wooldridge of the National Air and Space
Museum. ``So even then, the Air Force knew that that kind of
airplane was difficult to detect. The sad part is that they didn't
continue the testing.''
   Eventually, the lesson began to take hold, though the Air Force
still wouldn't bring itself to embrace the flying-wing design for
decades. Speed and manueverability remained paramount objectives
through the 1950s and '60s, though stealthiness gradually moved
higher on the priority list.
   Despite representations of the B-2 and its fighter counterpart,
the F-117A, as the only stealth aircraft in the world, the
anti-radar technology has been honed and shared by many other planes
in the U.S. arsenal, some of which remain even more secret than the
B-2 itself. The aging U-2 spy plane and its successor, the SR-71
Blackbird, featured composite coatings. The B-1 and the F-117A
represent advances in wing and body blending as well as the
radar-absorbent materials on their skins.
   Contrary to popular belief, the marriage of stealth technology
with the flying wing, with its slender and hence naturally stealthy
profile, also goes back decades, dating almost to the birth of radar.
   Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the British radar pioneer, said as early
as 1935 that the aerial defense applications of his new technology
could be stymied by future bombers designed to reduce their radar
reflectivity. He and other engineers recognized that stealth would
have not so much to do with the size of the airplane, but with its
shape and the materials used to cover it.
   In World War II, as the United States and Great Britain
aggressively improved radar technology, German scientists led the
way in exploring methods to counter it _ including coatings designed
to absorb, rather than reflect, radar energy. These radar-absorbent
materials, or RAM for short, were first used to shield the snorkels
of German submarines from detection by radar-equipped aircraft. Too
late, really, the engineers turned their attention to their own
aircraft.
   Almost by happenstance, Britain had already delivered a painful
lesson to the Third Reich about bombers and stealth technology.
Early in the war, the tiny de Havilland Company had answered the
panic call for virtually anything that would fly by building a
cheap, two-engine machine out of plywood, spruce and balsa. It was
initially scoffed at, but the Mosquito, which carried nary a
defensive gun, had the lowest loss rate of any World War II bomber
thanks to its speed, flying altitude and the nearly invisible
flicker it produced on radar screens.
   That lesson in mind, the brothers Walter and Reimar Horten,
working with a super-secret Luftwaffe group known as Sonderkommando
9, set out to build a super-Mosquito, one even stranger in design.
They came up with a flying wing, powered by two jet enginesburied
behind the cockpit. But too late: The HoIX, the only prototype to
fly, in early 1945, was destroyed when one of the engines failed; a
never-flown copy rests at the National Air and Space Museum's
storage complex at Silver Hill, Md.
   ``It is a remarkably clean-looking airplane,'' says Wooldridge, a
museum official and the author of ``Winged Wonders: The Story of
Flying Wings.''
   The test models were covered with plywood, but production
versions were to have a skin mixing plywood, sawdust, charcoal and
glue _ a compound expressly intended to absorb radar waves. The
Hortens had built a high-load-bearing plane combining jet power, the
low-profile shape of the flying wing and integral RAM. It was the
B-2 of its day.
   More frightening to contemplate is how the war might have turned
if Germany had managed to deploy a larger model that the Hortens had
actually started to assemble in April 1945, the HoXVIII. It was an
enormous, six-jet flying-wing bomber, designed to fly at least 7,400
miles with an 8,000-pound bombload. Were it not for Hitler's
imminent defeat, that aircraft, rivaling the size of the B-2, might
have flown to bomb New York City or Washington.
   Unlike Germany's rocket scientists, the Horten brothers were
rebuffed in their bid to pursue their breakthroughs for the Allies
after the war. Most U.S. warplane manufacturers focused on the
obvious alternatives to stealth for making their craft less
vulnerable _ more speed, higher altitudes, heavier armor and
on-board defenses.
   Meanwhile, Jack Northrop, the founder and longtime design leader
of the California company that bears his name, waged a lonely
campaign for something entirely different _ though the Horten
brothers, headed for virtual exile in Argentina, would not have
thought it so.
