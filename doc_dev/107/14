   The Air Force unveiled its
sinister-looking B-2 stealth bomber Tuesday, giving the world its
first look at the gray-and-black flying wing designed to evade enemy
radar and deliver nuclear weapons.
   The bomber, which has never been flown, was towed slowly out of a
hangar at Air Force Plant 42 in the Mojave Desert to cheers from an
invitation-only crowd of 2,000 workers, military brass, media and
industry representatives.
   The B-2, built primarily by Northrop Corp., resembles a huge,
tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into
rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side.
   The rollout ceremony, conducted before a giant American flag, was
in part a celebration of U.S. industrial ingenuity and in part, a
bit of high-tech saber rattling.
   Gen. Larry D. Welch, the Air Force's chief of staff, said the
plane's declared ability to slip through radar at all altitudes to
deliver its payload of nuclear bombs represents a potent deterrent
to those who would attack the United States.
   ``Its stealth capability will permit it to penetrate the most
sophisticated air defenses and survive well into the 21st century,''
Welch said. ``The B-2 is a superb example of the inherent
technological advantage of free society.''
   The rollout followed by three weeks the Pentagon's release of a
photo of another closely guarded project, Lockheed Corp.'s stealth
fighter, the F-117A. That plane has been flying since 1981 and was
declared ready for wartime missions in 1983; its existence was
acknowledged because the Air Force was preparing to start its first
daylight flights.
   Nearly everything surrounding the stealth bomber is secret,
including the cost.
   The General Accounting Office estimates the fleet of 132 stealth
bombers the Air Force wants to assemble over the next several years
could cost taxpayers $68 billion. That would put them at more than
$500 million a copy.
   The Air Force puts the total cost of the program at $30 billion
to $40 billion.
   The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be
extremely difficult to detect by enemy radar, due to the extensive
use of exotic composite materials, some of which absorb rather than
reflect radar waves; its lack of sharp surface angles; and a
cross-section that offers a very small profile to radar.
   The plane is a ``flying wing,'' a design resurrected from the
1940s that steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than
with a tail. The B-2 displayed Tuesday was gray on top and black
beneath.
   Nobody was allowed to see the B-2 from the rear, presumably
because revealing the design of its engine exhaust system might help
enemy detection efforts.
   Air Force Secretary Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge Jr. told the
gathering the program's expense represents an investment in safety.
   ``Let all of us remember America's enduring hope and prayer that
the B-2 will strengthen the cause of peace and that this magnificent
aircraft will never be flown in anger,'' Aldridge said.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones saluted employees of his
company and of subcontractors who have worked on the project for a
decade, unable to describe their work.
   ``For years, they've been working in a kind of honorable exile,''
Jones said. ``They persevered, and now you can see what it's all
been about.''
   The first flight on most airplanes is six to 12 weeks after
rollout, but Air Force officials refuse to commit to a date for the
first flight of the B-2.
   One of the U.S. senators at the ceremony, Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,
said budget contraints could force a ``stretch out' of stealth
bomber production, although he noted that influential Democrats like
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., give the program bipartisan backing.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., said: ``Here, today, with the unveiling
of the stealth bomber, I have never felt better about the deterrence
of America. I think we've got a great airplane.''
   ``It has the potential to render obsolescent a very great
investment in Soviet air defenses,'' Wilson said.
   As the bomber was towed out of a massive hanger, an Air Force
band broke into the stirring ``Stealth Fanfare,'' composed for the
occasion by Tech. Sgt. Allen Yankee, 35, of McMinnville, Ore., a
saxophonist in the band.
   The B-2 project was launched by former President Jimmy Carter.
Critics, including the private Union of Concerned Scientists, say
the B-2 deployment, planned for the early 1990s, would hamper arms
control efforts by posing a greater threat than current planes to
enemy command posts and mobile missiles.
   The B-2 is described as an all-altitude penetration bomber, as
opposed to the B-1 bomber, which is designed to penetrate enemy air
defenses at low altitudes.
   The Air Force says the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52 it is designed to replace.
   Flight tests will begin _ probably early next year _ at Edwards
Air Force Base, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave
Desert. The Air Force said the maiden flight will be the short hop
from the plant at Palmdale to Edwards.
   The bomber, which has inspired intense curiosity among aviation
buffs, has already inspired models, and a mockup appears in a
current automobile commercial.
