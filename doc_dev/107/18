   The first non-experimental aircraft that
flies both like a helicopter and an airplane rolled into the
spotlight Monday, hailed as an aviation milestone by legislators
and top military brass.
   The V-22 Osprey, a tilt-rotor craft that takes off and hovers
like a helicopter and flies like an airplane, received a standing
ovation from a crowd of 1,600. The crowd watched as the camouflaged
craft was towed onto the tarmac at Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.'s
Flight Research Center.
   The first flight of the V-22, which has been in development for
30 years, is scheduled for Aug. 15. An advanced experimental model,
the XV-15, has been flying since 1977.
   Fort Worth-based Bell and Boeing Helicopter Co. of Philadelphia
are jointly developing the V-22 for the Navy, Marines and Air
Force. The three services plan to buy 682 of the twin-engine
aircraft at an estimated cost of $16.6 million each.
   ``It's kind of awesome,'' Marine Corps Commandant Alfred M. Gray
Jr. told the crowd.
   ``It works, it's ahead of schedule and will be a sound
investment for taxpayers' money,'' said Navy Secretary William L.
Ball III, comparing the tilt-rotor's production to the jet engine's
development as aviation milestones.
   ``You are proving every day that a great country can still
outthink, out-design and out-produce all comers,'' Ball said.
   The three military services plan to use the V-22 for combat
assault, search and rescue, medical evacuation and special-forces
missions. Other uses, including anti-submarine warfare, also are
being studied. The cabin can carry 24 combat-equipped troops in
addition to a crew of three.
   ``On our abortive rescue attempt made in Iran a few years ago,
think what could have happened if they'd had an Osprey,'' said
House Speaker Jim Wright, referring to the failed 1980 rescue of 44
American hostages from Tehran.
   The Osprey, about the size of a medium transport aircraft, has a
stocky 57.3-foot-long fuselage and twin engines mounted on thick,
stubby wings. Its engines point upward during takeoff and landing,
with 38-foot diameter rotor blades that parallel the ground.
   The engines rotate, or ``tilt,'' forward once the V-22 is
airborne. Rotors lock into place and act like oversized propellers,
pulling the Osprey through the air like a conventional aircraft.
   The tilt-rotor can fly with the speed and range of a turboprop
plane _ more than 360 mph _ but doesn't require an airport or
runway. It also can hover like a helicopter.
   ``I'm convinced that in the next 20 years there will be
thousands of these in use,'' said Bell President L.M. ``Jack''
Horner.
   Bell has talked with American Airlines and several commuter
companies about civilian uses for the craft, a spokesman said.
   ``The New York (and New Jersey) Port Authority is a strong
supporter of this concept,'' said Horner. ``We could build a lot of
V-22s for the cost of one airport.
   The British-designed Harrier jump-jet also takes off and lands
vertically, but using jet-propulsion rather than a rotor system.
