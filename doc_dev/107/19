The Air Force's SR-71 Blackbird spy plane smashed a transcontinental speed 
record today as it flew into retirement and the history books. 
</P>
<P>
The nation's fastest operational airplane took off from Edwards Air Force Base 
in California at 4:30 a.m., refueled offshore, flew back over Edwards and then 
shot off eastward at supersonic speeds that triggered a 6:01 a.m. sonic boom. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-to-Washington flight was 1 hour, 8 minutes and 17 seconds, said 
the Smithsonian Institution, which will keep the plane in the National Air and 
Space Museum. 
</P>
<P>
On the way to its retirement home at the museum, the airplane broke four flight 
time records, including the world record of 4 hours, 12 minutes and 10 seconds 
for a flight from Los Angeles to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"We figured it would make it in about an hour," said Barbara Kornylo of 
Lockheed, the builder of the airplane. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71, designed in the early 1960s, is able to cruise faster than three 
times the speed of sound. The planes were built with a titanium alloy and can 
withstand temperatures exceeding 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The first flight of 
the SR-71 was on Dec. 22, 1964, the Smithsonian said. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird flies at an average speed of 2,200 m.p.h., about 400 m.p.h. to 
500 m.p.h. faster than the Concorde, which is the fastest airplane in 
commercial operation, Lockheed spokesman Jim Ragsdale said. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71 was never designed for commercial passenger use. It has seats only 
for a pilot and a reconnaissance systems officer and was designed to fly high, 
fast and unarmed on photographic reconnaissance missions. Because of the high 
altitudes the aircraft can reach, crew members on missions had to wear pressure 
suits and be connected to life support systems. 
</P>
<P>
The SR-71s were officially retired on Feb. 26, but Lockheed requested one of 
them to break some records publicly on its last flight, something that the 
plane has been doing -- but on a classified basis -- for years, Kornylo said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to breaking the world Los Angeles-to-Washington record set several 
years ago by pilot Brooke Knapp in her Lear jet 35A, the Blackbird also set 
speed records for the following: Los Angeles to Washington, 2,153.24 m.p.h.; 
St. Louis to Cincinnati, 2,242.48 m.p.h., and Kansas City to Washington, 
2,200.94 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The Blackbird, after fueling over the Pacific Ocean from an Air Force KC-135, a 
type of flying gas station, passed through a radar screen and quickly 
accelerated past the speed of sound. 
</P>
<P>
Southland residents, hearing the sonic boom, called police to report the sound 
of an explosion or earthquake, Sgt. James McClard said. 
</P>
<P>
While the Air Force has never publicly revealed how many SR-71s it commissioned 
to be built, 12 of them were stationed at Beale Air Force Base in Northern 
California in January. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the SR-71 that flew today, one is going to a museum at Warner-Robbins 
Air Force Base in Georgia, another to March Air Force Base in Southern 
California and three to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for 
use in high-altitude research.
