   The Boeing Co. on Wednesday released a photo of a
secret unmanned airplane it said made its first flight Sunday.
   Boeing released few details about the experimental aircraft,
other than to say it successfully completed its first flight and
would undergo further flight tests ``to characterize the
capabilities of this type of vehicle.''
   The airplane has a long, skinny fuselage with narrow, flexible
wings. It is powered by two propeller-driven engines, described by
the trade publication Aviation Week and Space Technology as
Teledyne Continental liquid-cooled piston engines.
   In April 1986, a similar plane was photographed outside a hanger
at the Grant County Airport in Moses Lake, in central Washington.
Boeing declined to comment on that aircraft.
   Boeing said the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency had
expressed interest in the aircraft and has provided some money to
participate in flight evaluation. The agency has classified certain
aspects of the aircraft design and performance, Boeing said.
   The plane resembles Boeing's Compass Cope remotely piloted
vehicle, an unmanned aircraft powered by a single jet engine.
Boeing built two of the planes for the Air Force.
   The Compass Cope was 40 feet long with a 90-foot wingspan. It
made its first flight at Edwards Air Force Base in California in
July 1973.
