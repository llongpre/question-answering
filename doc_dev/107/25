   The B-2 stealth bomber is ready to fly
after successfully completing ground tests, and takeoff could come
as early as Saturday, the Air Force says.
   The bat-winged aircraft sped down a desert runway Thursday,
hitting a top speed of 132 mph and lifting its nose wheel off the
tarmac, said Brig. Gen. Richard Scofield, director of the B-2
program.
   ``We've completed all the taxi tests prior to going to first
flight,'' Scofield said. ``The airplane is in good shape.''
   The bomber, in development for more than a decade, has been
subjected to extensive computer-simulated flights but has never
actually lifted off a runway.
   It incorporates revolutionary technologies and the use of
lightweight composite material to elude radar by absorbing radar
energy, rather than reflecting it as conventional aircraft do.
   But although the bomber appears ready to fly, congressional
opposition to the costly defense program threatens to ground the B-2
just as it is rising to prove its secret capabilities.
   Congressmen warned Air Force officials earlier this week that
they face a tough uphill fight with the B-2, which recent estimates
indicate would be the most expensive aircraft in history.
   ``Put it in perspective or there's a real possibility that the
B-2 will become a museum piece,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   On Thursday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney pleaded with Congress
not to ``nickel and dime to death'' the B-2, saying the bomber is
essential for U.S. forces to ``penetrate improving Soviet air
defenses.''
   Testifying before the House Armed Services Committee, Cheney
urged lawmakers to try to overcome ``sticker shock'' at the $500
million to $750 million price for each plane and to restore $800
million the panel cut from the B-2 budget last month.
   At Air Force Plant 42 in Palmdale, Scofield refused to be drawn
into the political debate, telling reporters: ``I'm working on the
airplane end of the thing _ and the airplane is doing just fine.''
   Scofield said engineers from Northrop Corp., which designed and
built the B-2, and Air Force officials would spend at least one day
evaluating data gathered during Thursday's ground tests.
   ``We will have to see what the data tells us,'' the general said.
``We'll be working on a number of issues.''
   Nevertheless, he made clear that Northrop and Air Force officials
believe they have all the data they need to send the bomber airborne.
   After maintaining for years that the B-2 didn't exist, the Air
Force invited the media and dignitaries to a coming-out ceremony
last November.
   Last week, the Pentagon announced the first flight tests of the
bomber _ 18 months behind schedule _ would be held during the next
two weeks.
   The Pentagon is proposing a $4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990
for the B-2. Manufactured by Northrop in Palmdale, the plane will
cost about $24 billion over a three-year peak period beginning in
fiscal 1992, according to Defense Department figures.
   The department has invested about $22.4 billion in the plane so
far.
