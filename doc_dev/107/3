   The B-2 stealth bomber, unveiled last fall
after more than a decade of secret work, will not fly for the first
time before late spring or summer, the Air Force said Friday.
   Acknowledging recent reports that the schedule for the first
flight was in jeopardy, the service said that because of ``an
aggregation of minor system checkout problems, the B-2's first
flight is now expected to be in the late spring or early summer time
frame.''
   ``Routine systems checkout of the first B-2 Advanced Technology
Bomber is continuing ...,'' the Air Force added. ``After first
flight, the B-2 will undergo extensive testing at Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif.''
   When the Air Force made its first announcement last summer about
an unveiling for the unusual ``flying wing'' plane, it confidently
predicted the aircraft would be ready for its first flight in the
fall of 1988.
   The plane was ultimately shown to the public for the first time
Nov. 22 at an Air Force plant in Palmdale, Calif.
   Air Force and Pentagon officials said at the time they were not
going to rush the initial checkouts of the sophisticated flight
systems, but that they still expected the plane to fly before the
end of the year.
   Maj. Pat Mullaney, an Air Force spokesman, said Friday the
problems encountered by technicians all had been relatively minor,
but that it took time to prepare a plane for its first flight.
   ``We have said all along that we're going to fly this airplane
when it's ready, and not according to some calendar schedule,'' said
Mullaney.
   The spokesman added the Air Force decided to release Friday's
statement after encountering a problem with the bomber's
``environmental control,'' or air conditioning, system, within the
past week or so.
   A component of that system failed during a high-pressure test,
Mullaney said. Even though the system was purposely overloaded 50
percent beyond its design limit at the time, the Air Force decided
to fix the component to ensure an extra margin of safety.
   ``The fix for that is straightforward and corrective action is
underway,'' he said.
   The disclosure of checkout problems comes three months after the
Air Force announced the B-2 would carry a price tag _ including
research and development costs _ of $516 million per plane. That
will make it the most expensive airplane ever.
   According to the latest Air Force estimate, the design,
development and construction of 132 planes will cost $68.1 billion
by the time production ends in mid-1995. Even if research and
development expenses are excluded, each plane still will cost $305
million to produce on the assembly line.
   The B-2, built primarily by Northrop Corp., resembles a huge,
tailless manta ray, with wide sweeping wings blending smoothly into
rounded cockpit and engine housings on the top side.
   The stealth gets its name from the claim that it will be almost
invisible to enemy radar, due to the extensive use of exotic
composite materials, some of which absorb rather than reflect radar
waves; its lack of sharp surface angles; and a cross-section that
offers a very small profile to radar.
   The plane is a ``flying wing,'' a design resurrected from the
1940s that steers with flaps on the rear of the wings rather than
with a tail. The B-2 is described as an all-altitude penetration
bomber, as opposed to the B-1 bomber, which is designed to penetrate
enemy air defenses at low altitudes.
   The Air Force says the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52.
