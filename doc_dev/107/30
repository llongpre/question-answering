   In coming months, Congress must decide whether
the B-2 ``stealth bomber,'' the most expensive plane ever designed
and built, is a weapon the United States can't afford to do without,
or simply can't afford. Yet for all the secrecy surrounding this
high-tech marvel, the ideas behind it are, by aviation standards,
almost ancient history.

   It rests, in pieces, in a grimy corner of a
museum warehouse in suburban Silver Hill, Md., long forgotten by the
nation that conceived its menacing promise as the least detectable
bomber in the skies.
   Re-assembled, it would look like a huge vampire bat or a
stub-tailed manta ray. Underlying its design was the notion that the
enemy wouldn't see it at all, because this jet-powered flying wing's
skin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves,
rather than reflect them.
   No, the Northrop B-2 bomber, the world's most expensive airplane,
hasn't already become a dust-gathering relic _ although some
critics, convinced the albatross is the only sea-creature to which
it should be compared, wish that were so.
   The astonishing lookalike in Silver Hill is indeed a stealth
warplane, but it was secretly built and test-flown 45 years ago by
Nazi Germany.
   For all the fanfare surrounding the use of the word ``stealth''
since it was introduced to the U.S. military vocabulary in 1980, the
B-2 and such radar-evading relatives as the F-117A fighter represent
concepts which, by aviation standards, are almost ancient.
   The B-2 has been financed, until this year, out of the Pentagon's
mysterious ``black'' budget. For eight years, the taxpayers spent
$22.4 billion without knowing it, and without knowing what they were
getting for it.
   What they got, when it was finally nosed heavenward in July, was
a strange, plastic bird that carries a smaller payload and probably
won't fly much higher, much farther or any faster than the Strategic
Air Command's old reliable, the B-52.
   The B-2 is 17 feet tall, 69 feet long and has a wingspan of 172
feet. It is powered by four General Electric F-118 engines,
virtually the same engines as used on the F-14 fighter but without
afterburners. Its range is 6,900 miles without refueling, and 11,500
miles with one midair refueling. It will have a maximum takeoff
weight of 350,000 pounds and be able to carry up to 50,000 pounds of
bombs or missiles, nuclear or conventional, 10,000 pounds less than
the B-52. Private experts estimate it will fly at altitudes of up to
55,000 feet at cruising speeds of mach 0.8 to 0.85, or about 530-560
mph.
   There's nothing especially dazzling about any of those numbers.
What is dazzling, presumably, is the stuff the Air Force won't talk
about _ the stealth technology, computerized flight controls,
``quiet'' on-board radar, and other electronic systems, possibly
employing fiber optics, designed to withstand the electromagnetic
interference generated by nuclear blasts.
   The Air Force wants to spend an additional $50 billion or so to
produce 132 of the planes designed by a company, Northrop, which for
years hadn't made a warplane other than a lightweight fighter, the
F-5.
   Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello, who left as
undersecretary of defense in May, wanted to scuttle the program. In
an interview with The Washington Post, he said he told then-Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci last year that ``it's being brought to you
by the same company that brought you'' a series of troubled
programs, including guidance systems for the MX and air-launched
cruise missiles. ``What makes you think they'll do better (with the
B-2)?''
   Eight days after the B-2's maiden flight July 17, Pentagon and
congressional officials confirmed an investigation was under way by
the Justice Department's fraud unit concerning Northrop's billing
practices on the project. The company said it was unaware of the
probe.
   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones says without reservation that
the B-2 is an ``extraordinary'' success. Defense Secretary Richard
B. Cheney calls it ``absolutely vital'' to strategic deterrence.
President Bush says doing without it would be ``devastating'' to
arms-control negotiations with the Soviets.
   The security and secrecy surrounding the project have been
phenomenal, perhaps rivaled only by elements of the Star Wars
program and the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb in
World War II. Northrop removed it from the rest of its own
organization, forming a new division called Advanced Products and
housing it at a closed auto plant in Pico Rivera, Calif. It
surrounded the plant, as well as the sister assembly complex at
Palmdale, Calif., with fences topped by razor wire.
   According to Costello, security has accounted for 5 percent of
the costs to date. With more than $22.4 billion spent so far, that
amounts to more than $1 billion.
   The tight security imposed additional costs. Efficiency suffered
from compartmentalization so severe some supervisors didn't know
what their subordinates were doing. ``I couldn't even ask,'' one
former Northrop official told the Los Angeles Times last year. ``For
all I knew, they were going to the movies every day.''
   Some could have. When employees were hired, they could not go
directly to work until their security clearances were finished. Many
were assigned for weeks to make-work jobs in an area of the plant
they nicknamed the ``drunk tank.''
   Unbeknownst to the public, the biggest snag occurred halfway
through the seven-year design period when the Air Force changed its
mind about the B-2's mission. The Pentagon originally ordered a
high-altitude bomber. Now it wanted one that could penetrate at low
levels as well, probably because it was fearful the Soviet Union was
developing the same new radar technology, called OTHB for Over the
Horizon Backscatter. The still super-secret radar system, the
Pentagon has privately acknowledged, offers new possibilities for
detecting stealth airplanes, though it is said to be ineffective
within 500 miles.
   Northrop's designers redesigned the wing for flight at lower
altitudes, where turbulence is greater. That took a year and another
$1 billion. An additional six-month delay was necessary for other
design changes, related especially to the engine inlets. In 1987,
two years before Congress began public debate over funding for the
B-2, the Pentagon moved its production schedule back two more years
in the face of Gramm-Rudman budget restrictions. Cheney has
postponed production yet another year; the Pentagon now hopes to
build all 132 planes by 1999, versus the original target of 1995.
