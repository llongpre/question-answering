   The meadow where Orville and Wilbur Wright
learned to turn and maneuver the world's first airplanes has been
dedicated as a national historic landmark.
   With a replica of one of Wright brothers' planes buzzing
overhead, about 400 military and civilian dignitaries attended the
dedication ceremony Friday at the Huffman Prairie Flying Field on
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.
   The Wright brothers first flew at Kitty Hawk, N.C., on Dec. 17,
1903. They then returned to Dayton and learned to maneuver the
aircraft at Huffman Prairie.
   ``They spent almost the whole year learning how to turn it and
control it,'' said base historian Lois Walker. ``The very first
circle in powered flight history was made on Sept. 20, 1904.''
   The 84-acre field was designated an historic landmark last July.
