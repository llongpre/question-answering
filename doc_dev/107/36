ASSESSING THE RISKS TO THOSE NEAR THE AIRPORT

I am writing in response to William M. Monroe's view on noise abatement (April 
9). First of all, let me say on behalf of most pilots that we try to follow 
noise abatement procedures when we fly. However, when most of us do fly, we 
think of flying the airplane first. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine an airliner loaded to capacity taking off at airports with relatively 
short runways -- like those at John Wayne Airport. The captain doesn't like to 
reduce power just for noise because that would reduce performance, especially 
in an emergency, but he does. 
</P>
<P>
In Airline Safety, Capt. William Heller suggested that the DC-10 crash at 
Chicago could probably have been avoided. The DC-10, in his view, probably 
could still have flown, even though the engine fell off, but the airplane was 
following procedures dictated by noise abatement requirements and that 
suggested that the airplane did not have the extra airspeed required to 
maintain flight. 
</P>
<P>
I think we should have pity for the captain and his crew whenever you see them 
flying from airports like John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
Another thing people don't understand is that they complain about noisy jets 
flying over certain noise-sensitive areas. Most jets, definitely airliners, 
operate under instrument flight rules. Under the rules, a plane is under the 
control of air traffic controllers, so it's not always up to the pilots where 
they fly. During congested periods, a controller will use all available 
airspace so that planes don't collide. 
</P>
<P>
In closing, I just like to say that many old pictures of airports don't show 
homes around them. That should speak for itself. Also I didn't go to Playa del 
Rey like Mr. Monroe suggested, instead I went to a little hill just south of 
LAX. I must say I love to hear and watch jumbos take off and land.
