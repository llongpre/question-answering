   The U.S. F-14 fighter that shot down Libyan
MiG-23 warplanes over the Mediterranean Sea on Wednesday is more
maneuverable and has more sophisticated radar and weapons than the
Soviet-made plane, say retired Navy officers.
   ``We have felt that the F-14 has been and continues to be the
world's best fighter plane,'' said retired Adm. Elmo Zumwalt, who
served as Chief of Naval Operations in 1970-74.
   The American pilots were almost certainly better trained than
their Libyan adversaries, other experts said.
   ``You are kind of putting professionals up against amateurs,''
said retired Marine Lt. Col. John Buchanan, a pilot who flew the
A-6, another carrier-based aircraft.
   Zumwalt, who lives in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, said
that ``even if the Libyan pilots were as good as ours, the F-14
could outpoint them.''
   U.S. analyses of the MiG-23 show it to be ``a highly
maneuverable, a very high-speed craft. But its avionics and missile
systems cannot compete with the F-14,'' he said.
   Norman Polmar of the Naval Institute Data Base said that the
``the F-14 is a lot more airplane, a lot more expensive to build and
to fly'' than the MiG-23, which epitomizes the Soviet philosophy of
building ``lots of less expensive airplanes.''
   The F-14 has two engines to the MiG's one, giving it greater
acceleration, has twin rear fins, giving it greater maneuverability,
and although both fighters have wings that sweep back in flight,
those on the F-14 operate automatically while the MiG-23's are
directed by the pilot, said Polmar.
   ``The (F-14) pilot does not have to think, he just flies,'' said
Polmar.
   Moreover, the F-14 pilot is assisted by a radar-weapons officer,
while the MiG-23 pilot is alone.
   One of the F-14's strongest points is its sophisticated radar
system, which is capable of looking down and over great distances
while tracking 24 targets at once, according to the Navy. The AWG-9
weapons tracking system can fire up to six Phoenix missiles while
continuing to scan the airspace, according to the Navy.
   Both the F-14 and the MiG-23 entered production more than 15
years ago and fly at similar speeds and heights.
   The F-14 Tomcat, which began aircraft carrier trials in 1972,
remains ``the premier all-weather, day-night air defense fighter in
the world,'' according to the Navy. Production by Grumman of Long
Island, N.Y., is expected to continue into the 1990s.
   A prototype of the MiG-23 was seen in public for the first time
at a Moscow air show in 1967. The fighter, known to NATO pilots as
the Flogger, entered active duty in 1973, according to Jane's ``All
the World`s Aircraft.''
   The Flogger is flown by all the air forces in the Moscow-led
Warsaw Pact and by 1987 had been sold to a dozen other countries,
according to Jane's.
   At takeoff, Floggers have wings that are fully extended to 46
feet and sweep back to about 25 feet as the fighter cruises at Mach
2, twice the speed of sound or about 1,400 mph, at its maximum
altitude of 59,000 feet above sea level, according to Jane's.
   Libya's MiG-23's are armed with one 23mm Gsh-23-L twin barrel gun
and can carry AA-2 Atoll air-to-air missiles, said Polmar.
   Before the incident, Libya's Soviet-built fighters included 44
MiG-21s, 131 MiG-23Es, 67 of the more advanced MiG-25 Foxbats and 92
Sukhoi 20-22 fighters. Additionally, Libya had 22 French-made
Mirages, according to ``The Military Balance,'' published by the
London-based Institute for International Strategic Studies.
   The American F-14 also is a swept-wing aircraft, taking off with
wings spread to 64 feet and flying with the wings swept back to 38
feet as it approaches a top speed of 2.34 times the speed of sound,
or 1,544 mph at its ceiling of 50,000 feet.
   The Tomcat is armed with an M-61 Vulcan 20mm gun and can carry
four Sparrow and four Sidewinder missiles, or a different mixture of
Sparrow, Sidewinder and Phoenix missiles, and it can carry bombs,
the Navy said.
   The F-14s on Wednesday fired Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles,
Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci said.
