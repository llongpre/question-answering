   The Air Force rolled out its mysterious
B-2 stealth bomber today, taking the cloak of secrecy off a sleek
flying wing designed to evade enemy radar while carrying nuclear
weapons.
   A band played the ``Stealth Fanfare'' and a crowd of guests
cheered as a decade of secrecy ended about the high-technology
aircraft, the crown jewel of the Pentagon's ``black inventory'' of
supersecret devices.
   The boomerang-shaped plane built by Northrop Corp. has a cockpit
flanked by two engine intakes positioned atop its single, continuous
wing. It is light gray on top and black underneath.
   Spectators were kept at a secure distance of 200 feet and were
unable from their vantage point to see the rear of the aircraft. The
plane, rolled slowly out of a hangar at Air Force Plant 42, had
previously been shown only as a rough drawing.
   ``Let all of us remember America's enduring hope and prayer that
the B-2 will strengthen the cause of peace and that this magnificent
aircraft will never be flown in anger,'' said Air Force Secretary
Edward C. ``Pete'' Aldridge Jr.
   On Monday, in one of the aerospace company's first public
pronouncements about the B-2, Northrop spokesman Les Daly said that
the stealth ``is simply not comparable to anything ever done before.
It is the first real computer-age aircraft.''
   The aircraft has not yet flown, and the General Accounting Office
estimates it could cost taxpayers up to $68.5 billion if the
Pentagon builds the 132 aircraft-fleet sought by the Air Force.
   The B-1B, the Air Force's most current operational nuclear
bomber, came in around $250 million apiece, before modifications.
Stealth bombers could cost twice that.
   Critics have questioned the need for such a plane and called it a
destabilizing element in arms-control efforts. Gen. Larry D. Welch,
Air Force chief of staff, contends the B-2 will play a vital role in
America's defense.
   The stealth, so-called because it is intended to be extremely
difficult to detect on enemy radar, has been described as a dark,
tail-less flying wing with no sharp angles to reflect radar, and
built of exotic composite materials, some of which will absorb radar
rather than reflect it. Air Force officials say it will resemble a
bird on a radar screen.
   Until earlier this year, Northrop was forbidden even to
acknowledge it was developing the bomber.
   The only previous public view of the B-2 was a drawing released
in April, showing what looked like two wings bolted together with no
fuselage or tail. Sources said some details about the plane's design
were deliberately disguised.
   The public may have seen what it thought was the B-2 in recent TV
commercials by American Honda. A mockup of the bomber sitting on an
airfield with an angry red background looms over a small and sleek
black Honda CRX. The life-size mockup was built for an ad agency
based on the Air Force drawing.
   The plane's real public debut at Air Force Plant 42 didn't reveal
much more detail; reporters and photographers had been told in
advance that they wouldn't be allowed closer than 200 feet, and the
plane was never turned so that anything but the front could be seen.
   Today's ceremony for congressional representatives, news media
and aerospace industry insiders followed by three weeks the
Pentagon's release of a photo of another closely held project,
Lockheed Corp.'s stealth fighter, the F-117A.
   For years, the stealth aircraft have been carried as ``black
programs'' with the Pentagon refusing even to acknowledge their
existence.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said recently that the Air
Force was attempting to manipulate the public's fascination with
technology to build good will for new military spending.
   ``We don't know what's right with stealth; we don't know what's
wrong with stealth,'' she said.
   The Union of Concerned Scientists, a private organization, has
issued a report challenging the need for such an expensive weapons
system, saying that it could destabilize arms control because some
of its missions would include destruction of such targets as command
centers and mobile missile sites.
   However, support for the bomber in military spending committees
on Capitol Hill has been bi-partisan, said the Air Force chief of
staff.
   The Air Force said the plane is 69 feet long, about the length of
an F-16 fighter plane. Its wingspan, at 172 feet, is almost as wide
as the aging B-52.
   Even though it has never left the runway, it is one of the most
carefully tested aircraft ever built because of advanced
manufacturing techniques and computer simulations that evaluated how
the aircraft would perform, Northrop said.
   ``We know more about this airplane before it flew than any other
airplane,'' Daly said. ``It is a remarkable aircraft.''
   Flight tests will begin probably early next year at Edwards Air
Force Base, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles in the Mojave
Desert, the Air Force said.
