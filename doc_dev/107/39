<TEXT>  of the American Aerospace Industry; By Wayne Biddle; Simon and Schuster, 384
pp., $22.95;  'THERE IS," observed George Bernard Shaw in "Man and Superman,"
"nothing in Man's industrial machinery but his greed and sloth: His heart is
in his weapons.";    So too, it seems, is a lot of profit. Although the
nation's aviation industry was not born of defense contracts, those contracts
account for its survival and growth -- as well as its continued dependence
upon the government, argues Wayne Biddle in this thoroughly researched and
admirably written book. Biddle, a reporter for the New York Times, finds that
the national symbiosis of aviation and government has roots both early and
deep.;    Biddle's focus is upon that close coterie of early aviators,
"self-concocted" individuals -- known to themselves and the public as
"birdmen" -- whose "goal in life was to build airplanes and make money," more
or less in that order. The problem they faced was combining the two.;    A
lunatic thing to do;  The barons -- Glenn Martin, Jack Northrop, Donald
Douglas and Allan and Malcolm Loughead, Scots brothers who later changed their
name to its phonetic spelling, Lockheed -- were a curious and eccentric lot, a
fact that Biddle finds hardly surprising: "Given the bourgeois perception of
flying as a rather lunatic thing to do, aviation turned out to be a gathering
place first for introverted radicals, not for eminent authorities.";    One
eminent authority who aspired to be a birdman was Samuel Langley, secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution and respected astronomer whose 800-pound
"aerodrome," built with $50,000 in federal grant money, ignominiously crashed
through the ice of the Potomac River in December 1903, at the start of its
second and last test flight.;    While Langley lost the race to be the first
man in powered flight to the more entrepreneurial Wright brothers, he achieved
fame of another sort: His airplane was the first to be canceled for poor
performance and cost overruns.;    Drawn to Southern California early in the
century by "balmy weather and adventurous millionaires," the birdmen were an
idealistic band of brothers whose camaraderie stands in stark contrast to the
latter-day cutthroat competition of the aerospace giants that bear their
names.;    Northrop originally designed planes for both Douglas and the
Lockheeds; Martin and Douglas teamed together to build scout planes for the
Army Signal Corps, the first branch of the service to have an air arm. (As a
hedge against starvation, Douglas tried growing potatoes in his back yard.
They failed to come up, and he gave up farming.);    Despite their native
enthusiasm and love of flying, it was initially not clear even to the barons
themselves what the airplane was good for, beyond chasing escaped convicts in
the California desert and carnival barnstorming.;    Sadly, it did not take
them long to find out. In April 1914, Martin entertained the crowd at a Los
Angeles air show by dropping bombs on a mock "forbidden city." The bombs were
actually oranges, and the "city" was blown up by workers detonating
black-powder charges in pre-dug holes near where the fruit landed. "We weren't
taking too much poetic license in dropping oranges," Martin later explained,
"because nobody knew what a bomb ought to look like anyway." This innocence
did not long endure, thanks to the birdmen and their airplanes.;    Martin's
prediction that "the aeroplane will practically decide the war in Europe" was
premature, if not backward. Actually, the war decided the future of the
airplane; the fledgling industry took off. In a fateful sign of things to
come, the head of wartime Washington's aircraft procurement office complained
of "being pestered by every Tom, Dick and Harry who ever built a coffin, a
toilet seat or a chicken coop.";    When business was good, it was very, very
good. Profits for military aircraft during World War I in some cases exceeded
30 percent. However, in a pattern that would become familiar to a later
generation of stockholders, peace brought about a sudden crash landing.;   
That, and the growing sophistication of aircraft, including the switch from
wood to metal and the gradual replacement of seat-of-the-pants intuition by
avionics, caused an explosive increase in expenses that almost swept the
birdmen and their companies from the sky: The cost of the average military
aircraft jumped from $15,641 in 1928 to $39,063 on the eve of the World War
II.;    War bonanza;  Once again, Mars came to the rescue. "The depression
that started in 1929 didn't affect us at all," Douglas boasted. "We weren't
doing any civil work.";    "By the beginnings of the 1930s, the foundation of
their industry was solidly military," Biddle notes. It would remain so, even
in peacetime. Having survived the infamous Nye hearings of the mid-1930s, the
erstwhile "merchants of death" suddenly found themselves hailed as visionary
architects of the arsenal of democracy a few years later, when war clouds once
again formed over Europe.;    "Business is moving very nicely for us and I
believe we are on the eve of an expansion period in aeronautics around the
world that we have all been waiting for," Martin observed -- this time
presciently -- in April 1937. Five days later, German planes bombed Guernica.
In 1939, the U.S. aircraft industry was 41st nationally in terms of dollar
value of output; five years later it was in first place.;    Once again,
however, the industry's dependence upon military production left the aircraft
companies "like whales stranded on a sandbar at ebb tide" with the war's end.
It would take the Cold War to refloat them. With that conflict, too, now
evidently at an end, another shake-out looms.;    There is a kind of tragic
poignancy to the story of the barons. Ultimately, as the industry matured, it
found it could no longer afford the visionaries who had given it birth. By the
time of their deaths, no birdmen remained in control of the companies they
started.;    Short on business sense; Martin, whose company became notorious
for its inability to control costs, was forced out only after he had saddled
his corporation with the cost of his Los Angeles mansion, a 106-foot yacht and
a hunting lodge on Maryland's Eastern Shore.;    Northrop was nearly driven
into bankruptcy by its founder's 30-year-long obsession with a flying wing.
Both the judgment and the authority of Douglas were undermined by his longtime
mistress, whom he raised to top management. The last member of the family to
bear his name was laid off by the company in 1990.;    The Lougheads finally
abandoned the business altogether. Allan sold Florida real estate; Malcolm
made a dubious investment in a gold mine and ended up driving logging trucks.;
   Of all the barons, Jack Northrop met with perhaps the kindest fate. In
1980, unable to speak and confined to a wheelchair by strokes, he was shown
the top-; secret blueprints for the B-2 "Stealth" bomber -- a spitting image
of the flying wing he had tried to sell the government since the mid-1940s. He
died the following year, before the debate had begun over cancellation of the
B-2, believing his vision had been vindicated.  </TEXT>
