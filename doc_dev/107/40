<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: AP File Photograph; CRASH AFTERMATH -- The Traffic Alert and
Collision Avoidance System is designed to prevent tragedies such as the 1986
collision in Cerritos between an AeroMexico jetliner and a private plane,
shown here, in which 91 died. In 1978, a PSA 727 jet and a Cessna 172 collided
over San Diego, killing 144 people.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  IN THE crystal-clear air 12,000 feet above the Big Sur coast, the oncoming
aircraft wasn't even a speck on the windshield to the crew of the Boeing 727
jetliner.;    Head-on, 16 miles out, an airplane is invisible to the human
eye. But the two aircraft hurtling toward each other at hundreds of miles an
hour were only a couple of minutes apart.  </LEADPARA>

MONITOR WARDS OFF COLLISIONS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     On a small television-like screen near the bottom of the jet's instrument
panel, colored electronic symbols showed the other aircraft on what could be a
collision course.;    "Traffic. Traffic," a metallic, female voice announced
in the cockpit. The computer was speaking.;    A small white diamond
representing the traffic drew closer to the chevron symbol of the jetliner in
the center of the screen, then became an amber circle, and finally a red
square as it crossed a ring of symbols marking a range of two miles. The
computer calculated the distance between the aircraft, their speeds and
courses.;    "Descend. Descend. Descend," the metallic voice advised.;    THE
PILOT pulled back the throttle levers for the jet's three engines and lowered
the nose. The plane went down 1,500 feet a minute. Moments later the other
aircraft passed harmlessly 800 feet overhead.;    A collision was avoided in
this demonstration because of a new device called Traffic Alert and Collision
Avoidance System, or TCAS. It is now standard equipment on one of every five
U.S. commercial airliners with 30 seats or more.;    The Federal Aviation
Administration ordered the devices installed on all airliners, including
foreign airliners that fly in the United States, by the end of 1993.;    The
devices are not fail-safe, however.;    On June 30, two jetliners carrying a
total of 194 people at 33,000 feet over North Carolina missed a head-on
collision by less than a mile and a half. The TCAS aboard one plane, a USAir
McDonnell Douglas DC-9, failed to alert the pilots. The other plane, a
Continental Airlines Boeing 727, was not equipped with the device.;    The
TCAS is supposed to work as long as the other plane has the conventional
altitude-reporting transponder required on all commercial airliners.;    The
National Transportation Safety Board is looking into the North Carolina
incident.;    On a recent flight over California aboard the FAA's Boeing 727
jet, however, officials demonstrated TCAS in close encounters with a
twin-engine turboprop aircraft, and it worked just fine.;    The two planes
made a series of head-on passes as well as approaches from the side. Each time
they would have gotten too close, the TCAS ordered the 727 crew to climb or
descend.;    Such a device was first proposed in 1955 after two airliners
collided over the Grand Canyon of Arizona. But research by the airlines and
the federal government hit one dead end after another until 1981, when the FAA
settled on development of TCAS. The system is independent of the ground-based
air-traffic-control system.;    During the 1980s, thousands of computer
simulations were run to find out how to provide the most protection with the
least number of false alarms. Researchers also used the Boeing 727 flight
simulator at NASA/Ames Research Center in Mountain View to find out what
information the system had to provide pilots.;    Here's how TCAS works:;   
The first element is the radar beacon transponder. About 70 percent of the
airplanes in the United States are equipped with these radio devices, which
identify the planes and report their altitudes when they fly into restricted
airspace around the nation's busiest airports.;    The other element is the
TCAS equipment aboard the airliner.;    ONCE A SECOND, it transmits
"interrogation" signals and picks up return signals from transponder-equipped
aircraft out to 16 miles. It watches the skies 1,200 feet above and below the
airplane.;    The TCAS computer tracks the changing range, direction and
altitude of each aircraft in its protected airspace to determine the
intruder's course and speed. The computer also predicts when the other
aircraft will reach its closest point, and decides if it's a threat.;    If
there is a danger, the computer analyzes whether to climb or descend, then
chooses the least disruptive maneuver that also will keep the two airplanes
farthest apart in altitude.;    "You shouldn't be getting into a violent
turn," said Edward Olowacki, FAA project manager on TCAS. "Pilots are very
sensitive to the flying public. They'll just lay it over slowly, and the
passengers won't even know what's going on.";    And if the other aircraft
changes altitude and thwarts the evasive maneuver, the TCAS computer will
advise the pilot whether to increase or decrease the rate of the climb or
descent.;    The computer also considers the aircraft's limited climbing
ability at high altitude or when the wheels are hanging out for landing. It
won't tell the pilot to descend if the plane is less than 1,000 feet above the
ground.;    Only one of the planes need carry the TCAS equipment, which costs
up to $140,000 to purchase and install.;    An advanced model now under
development will tell the pilot to turn left or right as well as up or down to
avoid a collision.  </TEXT>
