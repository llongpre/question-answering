<HEAD>Tilt-Rotor V-22 Osprey Makes Emergency Landing</HEAD>

   An experimental tilt-rotor aircraft
designed to hover like a helicopter and fly like an airplane made
an emergency landing Monday after one of two engines failed, a
spokesman said.
   The V-22 Osprey lost power in its left engine, but was able to
return safely to Arlington Municipal Airport, said Terry Arnold,
spokesman for Bell Helicopter Textron Inc.
   No injuries or damage to the prototype aircraft were reported
after the 10 a.m. malfunction in the skies about 40 miles southwest
of downtown Dallas, Arnold said.
   ``Actually, we're pleased, because the aircraft did what it was
supposed to do,'' Arnold said. ``The other engine engaged the shaft
and drove both rotor systems and we landed without incident. It was
designed to do just that.''
   Arnold said it was the first emergency landing on record for the
V-22. The cause of the malfunction was not immediately known.
   The Osprey can hover and land like a helicopter but also flies
at up to 340 mph as a fixed-wing airplane _ much faster than a
helicopter. Large rotors on the ends of the wings tilt up for
vertical flight and rotate forward for the long haul.
   Arnold said the aircraft, one of four Osprey prototypes, was in
``airplane mode'' when the engine failed.
   It flew in ``airplane mode'' back to the airport, where it
swooped down and landed like a helicopter, said Bob Leder, another
Bell Helicopter Textron spokesman.
   The four prototypes are among six Ospreys for which the Pentagon
has contracted.
   The Defense Department has spent $2 billion to develop the V-22
Osprey and its predecessor, the XV-15, for military use. But
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney wants to end funding in favor of
conventional helicopter development.
