   Lockheed Corp. on Wednesday unveiled its
version of a futuristic fighter proposed for the 21st century, as
Air Force officials cited the Middle East crisis as the need for
such a craft.
   The Lockheed YF-22 prototype of the Advanced Tactical Fighter
followed Monday's launch of a prototype made by Northrop Corp. The
two designs are competing for a multibillion-dollar contract.
   The plane Lockheed unveiled at its Palmdale manufacturing plant
was much more compact than the Northrop version.
   Both planes have smooth contours to help them evade radar and
are built of advanced composite materials. The Lockheed aircraft
has stubby wings, while the Northrop plane is longer, with a
cigar-like fuselage and a wingspan that looks like a kite.
   A music system blared Wagner's ``Flight of the Valkyries'' as
the Lockheed plane was rolled out, although unlike its competition,
the YF-22 stayed on the ground after its rollout. Officials would
not say when it would be flown.
   Lockheed chairman Daniel M. Tellep said it will not matter that
Northrop got its aircraft up first.
   ``It is not he who flies first, it is he who flies best,'' he
said.
   The contract calls for 750 fighter planes for the Air Force and
approximately 500 for the Navy at a cost of $51 million apiece. The
price tag is about twice the cost of the F-15 Eagle, the current
front-line fighter deployed in the Middle East.
   The ATF program faced fading prospects for approval in Congress
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, but the crisis has
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense projects.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Ralston said he is optimistic
about congessional funding for the ATF program desspite recent
defense spending cuts.
   In building the YF-22 prototype, Lockheed teamed with the Boeing
Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. Northrop teamed with McDonnell
Douglas Corp. for its test version of the futuristic fighter.
   The winner must give the Pentagon a fighter plane that can fly
twice the speed of sound, is highly maneuverable and uses
radar-evading stealth technology.
   If Northrop gets the contract, ATF planes will be built in
Southern California. Lockheed has said if it wins the competition,
the fighters will be made in Marietta, Ga.
