   The American public will get its first look at
the new Stealth bomber just after the presidential election, and
the plane will make its maiden flight a short time later, the Air
Force said Thursday.
   Maj. Pat Mullaney, an Air Force spokesman, said the Stealth,
designated the B-2, won't fly on the day of its public unveiling in
California, but preparations for flight will be very close to
completion by then. New planes often don't fly until several months
after they are first presented to the public.
   Fred Hoffman, a Pentagon spokesman, denied Thursday the plane's
unveiling purposely had been set for after the November elections.
   Democratic members of Congress have cautioned the Defense
Department not to make an election-year issue out of the new
bomber, as was done with the B-1B. Both Democrat Michael Dukakis
and Republican George Bush have said they support the new plane.
   The bomber is an unusually short plane because of its unique
``flying wing'' design and will take only two personnel to fly,
reflecting the sophistication of the new technology that has gone
into its development, the service added. The B-52 bomber requires a
crew of six and the new B-1B bomber is flown by a crew of four.
   The Air Force said in a statement the plane would be powered by
four General Electric Co. jet engines. The engine, dubbed the
F-118, will be a derivative of an existing GE powerplant and not
any type of revolutionary new design, the service said.
   The Air Force offered those details about its newest bomber in
announcing that final ``checkout activities'' on the first plane
had begun and that assembly of a second was well along.
   ``The B-2 will roll out in mid-November at Air Force Plant 42 in
Palmdale, Calif,'' the statement said. The exact date was not given.
   The B-2 has been under development for more than a decade under
a shroud of secrecy with Northrop Corp. as the prime contractor.
Thursday's statement was only the second time the Air Force has
disclosed information about the plane. It released an artist's
sketch last April.
   The Stealth bomber takes its nickname from the fact it is
designed to fly without showing up on radar.
   It resembles a ``flying wing'' in shape, without a conventional
fuselage in the center. A small cockpit bubble rises on top of the
flying wing, and inlets for the jet engines are placed to each side
of the cockpit, also on top of the wing.
   The B-2 will stand about 17 feet high, 69 feet long and have a
wingspan of about 172 feet, the service said.
   In addition to GE, subcontractors included the Boeing Advanced
Systems Co., LTV Aircraft Products Group, Hughes Aircraft Radar
System Group and Honeywell.
   The Link Flight Simulation Corp. is responsible for aircrew
training devices and the Boeing Military Airplane Co. will build
the B-2's bomb and missile launcher system, the service added.
   While offering some new information, the Air Force said Thursday
it still was not prepared to publish the current cost estimate for
the Stealth fleet.
   Published reports have suggested overruns have pushed the
pricetag up more than 20 percent to about $450 million per plane.
