   A solar-powered airplane is slowly nearing
the end of its wind-tossed odyssey from California to Kitty Hawk,
N.C., the birthplace of powered flight.
   After more than six weeks, sometimes being blown the wrong way,
aviator Eric Raymond still has about 240 miles to go in his
198-pound plane, Sun Seeker. But strong headwinds appear to have
dashed his hopes of reaching Kitty Hawk during the Labor Day
weekend, said his wife, Aida.
   ``He's getting desperate to get there. He just wants to finish
the flight,'' Mrs. Raymond said in a telephone interview Friday.
   Meanwhile, the welcome mat is out where Orville and Wilbur
Wright piloted a motor-powered airplane for the first time in 1903.
   ``There's a lot of excitement here,'' said Nancy McWilliams,
spokeswoman for Kitty Hawk Kites, a hang glider school planning a
reception for Raymond's arrival. ``It's been the talk of the town
for the last month. Wherever I go, people say, `Where's Eric?
When's Eric arriving?'''
   Raymond, 33, a former national hang gliding champion had logged
only 18 miles for the day when he landed Friday afternoon at
Virginia Tech Airport at Blacksburg, Va., about 25 miles west of
Roanoke, Va.
   ``We've been very upset because the delays we've had on this
trip have had nothing to do with the plane, they were because of
the weather,'' Mrs. Raymond said.
   ``We thought he was going to land at Kitty Hawk on Sunday,'' she
said. ``Now the weather forecast is saying the strong headwinds
will keep up for another four days after today and he may not be
able to fly until they stop.
   ``The weather forecast has been so wrong all along, we're just
hoping it'll be wrong again,'' she said.
   When Raymond took off from the New River Valley Airport in
Virginia on Friday, he had 260 miles to go, and had logged 2,168
miles in 102 hours and 35 minutes in the air.
   On Thursday, he braved the Appalachians, gaining 132 miles
before landing about 35 miles west of Roanoke.
   It was July 16 when Raymond first took off from Desert Center,
beginning his quest to prove an ultralight aircraft partially
powered by solar energy could cross the United States.
   Rather than set a flying record, Raymond wants to show solar
power's usefulness, said trip spokesman Jack Whitehouse. The plane
has solar cells on its surfaces to run an electrical motor that
turns its propeller.
   The motor is used for takeoffs and landings. After takeoff, the
motor is turned off and the plane rides the thermals like an
ultralight glider.
   Two days after the sojourn began, the craft was seriously
damaged in an aborted takeoff from Lordsburg, N.M.
   Raymond and his ground crew brought the craft back by land to
Lake Elsinore for repairs. Raymond manufactured and sold hang
gliding equipment there until six months ago, when he devoted
himself to the Sun Seeker project.
   The Sun Seeker had better luck after taking off again from
Desert Center on Aug. 2.
   Although the craft hasn't crashed since, strong headwinds and
rain along the way have made for slow going.
   In the month since, the Sun Seeker has remained grounded on
eight days because of bad weather. One day the craft was forced to
land after strong headwinds pushed it backwards.
