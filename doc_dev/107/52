   EDITOR'S NOTE _ In vast Alaska, highways are scarce, villages
remote and cars have limited use. Get a horse? No, get an airplane.
Here's one man's crusade to honor the aviation pioneers in
America's flyingest state.

   The remains of the airplane lay
rotting in the slimy thicket of a gulch, wings clipped, tail shorn,
body stove in, a sorry looking carcass guarded by squadrons of
bloodthirsty mosquitoes.
   To Ted Spencer it shone like a jewel.
   ``It can be restored,'' Spencer was saying, stalking the
remains, nodding. ``Yes, it can.'' His boots made sucking sounds as
he bounded around in the muck snapping pictures, oblivious to the
mosquitoes, his glee obvious.
   ``I heard about this airplane last year and didn't believe it
was true. When I came and saw it for myself, saw `Ptarmigan II'
painted on its nose, my heart leapt. Look, you can still read it.''
   Ted Spencer is the director of the Alaska Aviation Heritage
Museum which occupies a corner of the Anchorage airport.
   At 42, he couples a childlike exuberance for airplanes with a
professorial knowledge of them, especially airplanes of the
Ptarmigan II vintage.
   His aim is to document, through records and artifacts, one of
the most colorful periods in American history, the 20 years before
World War II when ``The Aviation,'' as it was called, came to
Alaska.
   The old airplanes themselves, of course, are the prime
artifacts. A proud array of them, restored to look like new,
contrast handsomely with their modern counterparts flying overhead.
   ``What those aviation pioneers did in Alaska was no less
extraordinary,'' says Spencer, ``than men landing on the moon. What
they accomplished had immediate effects, and they were more
significant in Alaska than the advent of aviation in any other
state. They liberated America's last frontier.''
   Flying out to Willow Creek recently _ there being no other way
to cover the 275 miles from Anchorage _ Spencer pointed out the
window to a beach on the Kuskokwim River near the village of
McGrath. As if to document his own claim, he scribbled a note to
his fellow passenger:
   ``Carl Ben Eielson flew first airmail to that spot Feb. 1924.
Single-engine DeHavilland DH-4. Open cockpit. Came from Fairbanks.
Three-hour flight in winter.''
   Before Eielson's flight it took 20 days to make that 300-mile
mail run by dog team. You can see a photograph of Eielson and his
airplane at the Heritage Museum.
   More out of continuing necessity than nostalgia for those glory
days of epic feats, Alaska has remained by far the flyingest state
in the nation.
   According to Federal Aviation Administration figures, Alaska,
per capita, has eight times as many pilots and 15 times as many
planes as the U.S. average. It works out to one pilot for every 55
Alaskans and one plane for every 57. Alaska's 9,682 licensed pilots
average 132 flying hours a year compared with a national average,
including Alaska, of 49 hours.
   Hood Lake in Anchorage is the world's largest seaplane base.
Merrill Field, which handles only general aviation _ light planes
for personal and charter use _ is busier than the international
airports in Seattle-Tacoma, Salt Lake City, and Orlando, Fla.
   ``It's hard for people who haven't experienced Alaska to
visualize its vastness and its terrain,'' said the FAA's Paul
Steuke.
   ``We have only about 533,000 people, most of them scattered in
settlements that would be utterly isolated without the airplane.
Our few roads, very few, are like streams without tributaries, you
can't get to them. Even if you could, they're often impassable in
winter.
   ``Add to that four huge mountain ranges and unpredictable
weather systems boiling out of the Pacific. Even skilled pilots
have to stay on their toes in Alaska.''
   How much more so, says Spencer, for the aviation pioneers who
established that almost mythic breed known as bush pilots. During
the 1920s and 1930s they became the most popular and honored men in
Alaska.
