   For eight years -- since former President Carter first disclosed the existence of its development -- the super-secret Stealth bomber has been the subject of intense speculation. 
But the military has kept the radar-evading aircraft, being built by Northrop Corp., under the tightest of wraps. 

   Yesterday, the Pentagon allowed a first peek at its new bomber design. 
In a surprise move, the Air Force released an artist's drawing of a spooky flying machine that looks more like a space-age boomerang than an aircraft. 
"It looks like Batman's airplane," said an aide to the House Armed Services Committee, whose members have often criticized the cloak-and-dagger atmosphere surrounding the bomber. 

   The winglike shape of the aircraft, which is designed to deflect enemy surveillance radar, confirms what had long been suspected: The Stealth is adapted from an aircraft that Los Angeles-based Northrop developed 40 years ago, the YB-49, known as the Flying Wing. 
The Air Force never bought that plane, but its technology formed the basis for today's theories of radar-evasion techniques, which also involve advanced composite materials and electronics. 

   An Air Force spokesman said the drawing was made public because the classified plane -- officially known as the B-2 -- would soon make an appearance on the runway outside a Northrop plant in Palmdale, Calif., in preparation for its maiden flight this fall. 
That would put the Stealth about one year behind its initial schedule. 

   In a prepared statement, the Pentagon also hinted that disclosures soon would be forthcoming about what may be the most startling aspect of the B-2: its budget. 
In 1981, the Air Force said it intended to buy 132 of the bombers at a total cost of $36.6 billion, making the Stealth the most expensive military aircraft ever built. 
Now that estimate is to be "updated," the Air Force said yesterday. 

   Analysts estimate the cost of those planes has risen to between $53 billion and $59 billion. 

   Members of Congress who have access to classified information have repeatedly warned that the plane's costs are out of control and demanded greater accountability from Northrop. 
"No one should be surprised that the (Air Force's) reevaluation involves an increase, rather than a decrease, in costs," said Rep. Les Aspin (D., Wis.), chairman of the Armed Services panel. 
"This lets the cat out of the bag." 

   Stealth-watchers will have to wait until later this year, when official Pentagon figures are to be released. 
Northrop declined to comment, citing the plane's classified status. 

   But Robert Costello, the Pentagon's undersecretary for acquisition, is said by Defense Department officials to be concerned about management problems, cost overruns and delays at Northrop in developing the bomber. 
Mr. Costello "has scrutinized the program and he's not satisfied," one official said. 

   David Smith, an aerospace industry consultant, said the Pentagon may have timed the release of the Stealth drawing to pressure Northrop to meet its schedules. 
"They've thrown down a gauntlet and said, 'Now you better be darn sure it flies in the fall.' 
This is an interesting way of holding Northrop's feet to the fire."
