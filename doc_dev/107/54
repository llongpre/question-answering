   Aircraft designer Jack Northrop's dream for more
than three decades was a jet that would combine the flying wing
design with ``stealth'' technology, making it virtually impossible
for enemy radar to detect. The B-2 stealth bomber flew its maiden
voyage this summer, and the pending decision on whether to begin
full-scale production will help determine the face of American air
power into the next century.

   Jack Northrop, the aircraft designer and
founder of the California company bearing his name, was obsessed
with the flying wing. But for more than three decades, the Air Force
shunned it as a flight of fancy.
   Then, in the end, it embraced Northrop's dream to build the B-2
``Stealth'' bomber, the world's most expensive airplane at current
estimates of $530 million apiece.
   Now Congress must decide whether the United States can afford to
build a plane the military says it can't afford to do without.
   Northrop long ago regarded the stealthy characteristics of the
flying wing _ chiefly, its reduced liklihood of being detected by
radar _ as a side benefit, a nice selling point to the military, for
what he believed was the most sensible way to build any airplane. A
flying wing has more lift and far less drag than a conventional
airplane of the same weight. It therefore is more efficient, meaning
it requires less power and less fuel, and can carry a greater
payload.
   ``Any reasonable assumptions,'' Northrop said in 1947, ``will
always result in advantage to the all-wing configuration, of such
magnitude as to fully warrant whatever trials and tribulations may
be involved in its development.''
   In 1981, as the headlines focused on Ronald Reagan's resurrection
of the B-1 program canceled by Jimmy Carter, Jack Northrop, then
retired and near death, was given a special security clearance so
Pentagon officials could deliver some news he had wanted to hear 34
years earlier. The Air Force had finally contracted with the company
bearing his name to build a flying wing as the nation's flagship
strategic bomber.
   Long before the public got its first glimpse of the B-2, Air
Force Chief of Staff Larry Welch declared that ``the aerodynamic
design ... is markedly more efficient than that of its
predecessors.'' The B-2, he continued, ``requires far fewer tankers
... and carries a very healthy bomb load. It would be a superb
bomber even if it weren't stealthy.''
   Aside from military considerations, some aviation buffs are
rooting for full development and production of the B-2 because of
its potential spin-offs for commercial flight. According to Tim
Wooldridge of the National Air and Space Museum, airlines and air
transport companies have long flirted with the notion of an all-wing
design for ``span-loaders'' that could fly tremendous distances
carrying huge weights _ oil, for example. ``But nobody's willing to
bet the billions of dollars it would cost'' for feasibility
research, he notes. ``What airline would bet that kind of money?''
   To some in Congress, the billions that will be needed to build a
fleet of B-2's look like a questionable bet, as well.
   By current estimates, each one will cost about $530 million. Put
another way, a single B-2 will cost $100 million more than Toronto's
spectacular Skydome, the world's newest and fanciest sports stadium,
replete with hotel, restaurants and retractable roof. The extra $100
million would buy a major league baseball team.
   ``The Department of Defense has produced a B-2 program that won't
fly financially,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee. ``Members of Congress are balking at
spending $4.1 billion this year for the Strategic Defense
Initiative. It is not realistic to think we can spend twice as much
per year on a plane.''
   ``This was the worst kind of public policy,'' said Rep. John R.
Kasich, R-Ohio. ``To keep something secret all this time and drive
the cost up to $22 billion (to date) will never be tolerated again.''
   The Air Force rejects such criticism, suggesting that some
members of Congress are being coy with their constituents now that
the cost estimates are public after eight years of top-secret
development. ``The charge that someone was hiding anything from the
Congress is ludicrous,'' said Larry Welch, the Air Force chief of
staff. ``There were dozens and dozens of people in the Congress who
were fully aware of all the details.''
   But Rep. Myke Synar, D-Okla, said, ``I attended classified
briefings by the Air Force and by Northrop which frankly left a lot
to be desired. They were not straightforward, they were not candid
and, in many ways, they were very confusing.''
   Synar charged that Northrop had ``miserably failed to manage this
program.'' Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello
agreed, saying he had ``serious and grave concerns'' about
Northrop's management, and that the firm's quality controls were
``terrible.''
   Northrop's chairman, Thomas V. Jones, vigorously defended the
company and the airplane in a meeting with shareholders, saying the
program had produced an ``extraordinary new aircraft system'' and
``unprecedented technical successes.''
   The nation's first B-2 bomber made its public debut this summer,
18 months later than scheduled. It taxied slowly from its hanger at
Northrop's plant in Palmdale, Calif., and turned onto runway 04 the
morning of July 17. Chief Northrop test pilot Bruce J. Hinds, who
hadn't been able to tell even his wife he had been selected for the
honor, ran up the plane's four General Electric engines and released
the brakes at 9:36 a.m. EDT. Twenty-three seconds later, the B-2 was
airborne.
   ``The aircraft was very stable; rock stable,'' Hinds reported
later. ``It's going to be a very easy airplane to fly.''
   But not to sell. Before the August congressional recess, the
House limited B-2 production to two planes next year and two the
year after that _ half what the Bush administration wants. It also
ordered the Pentagon to draw up a new and cheaper production
program. The Senate was kinder; it trimmed only $300 million from
the $4.7 billion sought by the president for the B-2 next year. A
compromise bill may be crafted next month.
   Meanwhile, the Air Force has scrambled to redefine the B-2's
mission and capability. Originally conceived as a purely strategic
bomber to seek out and destroy the Soviet Union's mobile missiles in
a nuclear war, it now is being promoted as a conventional brushfire
weapon as well.
   Gen. Bernard P. Randolph, head of the Air Force Systems Command,
argues that the B-2 would have been ideal, had it been available,
for the 1986 U.S. raid on Libya. ``Just three to four B-2s could
have done the job directly from stateside bases,'' Randolph said.
   That's a remarkable switch in Air Force thinking. When the raid
was planned by a young Marine lieutenant colonel named Oliver North,
he inquired about having the already operational F-117A stealth
fighter-bomber do the job, according to Sweetman.
   The Air Force turned North down cold, saying the plane was too
valuable to risk on such a venture.
   The question arises: if that is true of the F-117, thought to
cost about $100 million per plane, why wouldn't it be true of the
B-2, at more than half a billion dollars?
