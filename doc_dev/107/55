   Eight-year-old DeAndra Anrig says
she felt like Winnie the Pooh when an airplane snagged her kite
line and lofted her on a 100-foot ride.
   ``I read about how Winnie the Pooh flies in the air on kites,
but I never wanted to try it,'' said DeAndra, who let go just as
the kite carried her toward a tree. ``I wasn't thinking anything
but how scared I was.''
   ``She said it was just a big jerk that lifted her (10 feet) into
the air,'' said DeAndra's mother, Debby. ``It carried her right
over my husband's head. All he saw was a shadow going over his
head. I'm just thankful she let go.''
   DeAndra escaped from her ride with bruises. Sympathetic
neighbors delivered cupcakes Tuesday to her home in Dublin, 30
miles southeast of San Francisco, where she rested on an air
mattress surrounded by ice packs and two of her stuffed animals.
   DeAndra and her parents were picnicking Sunday with friends at a
park 2 miles from the Palo Alto airport when the accident occurred.
   DeAndra was taking her turn flying the 12-foot, glider-type kite
when a twin-engine plane descending toward the airport caught the
kite's 200-pound nylon test line.
   Mountain View fire marshal Frank Moe said the 70-pound child was
carried about 100 feet before letting go.
   ``There was no way the people in the plane could have known what
was happening,'' said Ken Markowitz, a lawyer for the Reno Flying
Service, owner of the Care Flight medical transport plane that
tangled with the kite.
   Pilot Jack Uranga of Reno, Nev., was flying a patient to
Stanford University Hospital when the propeller snagged the line,
Markowitz said.
   Despite damage to one propeller blade, Uranga managed to land
safely, but the plane is grounded until repairs are made, Markowitz
said. Uranga said Tuesday that company regulations prevented him
from discussing the accident.
   In San Jose, Federal Aviation Administration official Edge
Ritter said the plane sustained a 2-inch gouge in one of its two
propellers. He was unable to estimate the cost of repair or the
height of the plane when it caught the line.
   Mountain View authorities said they would post signs at
Shoreline park advising that kite flying has been banned there. The
Public Utilities Commission prohibits kite flying within 5 miles of
an airport.
   Ritter said there frequently are kites in the park area, but
this was the first such accident.
   ``There had been planes flying over all that afternoon,'' said
DeAndra's father, Brad. ``And there were kites everywhere _ 15 to
20 of them, some up as high as 200 feet.''
   He and DeAndra found their kite after the incident _ about half
a mile away _ with about 60 feet of line still attached.
