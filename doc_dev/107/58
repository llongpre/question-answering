<LEADPARA>  An underwater expedition has brought back the first clear pictures of the
wreck of the USS Macon -- along with plastic dinner plates, a Tabasco sauce
bottle, a pulley and other relics of the giant dirigible that crashed 56 years
ago along the Monterey coast.;    The mission found encouraging signs that at
least one of the Macon's four scout planes may be in sound condition, said
Chris Grech, pilot of the remote submersible that explored the wreckage in
mid-February.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But the Navy's efforts to retrieve the planes have been put on hold, and
they may face legal snags, Grech said. The debris was recently found to lie
within state boundaries; it may also fall within a proposed national marine
sanctuary. And if the wreck is declared a historic site, he said, it may be
off-limits to salvage.;    The 785-foot airship was based in Hangar One at
Moffett Field Naval Air Station from October 1933 until it broke up during a
February 1935 training exercise and crashed south of Point Sur, killing two of
its 83 crewmen. A Navy crew discovered the scattered wreckage last summer
under 1,450 feet of murky water.;    Since then, three distinct areas of
debris have been mapped, and two have been explored by submersibles -- the
Seacliff, operated by the Navy, and the Ventana, a remotely operated sub from
the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.;    Grech, who pilots the
Ventana, showed dramatic footage from the latest set of dives at an institute
seminar last week.;    The Ventana took 10 hours of color videotape of the
front half of the dirigible, including the shattered control room, the remains
of the galley and all four of the F-9C Sparrowhawk biplanes that conducted
reconnaissance flights from a hangar in its belly, Grech said. The footage was
transmitted live to a group of scientists on shore, who uncorked champagne and
later celebrated by singing old songs around a player piano.;    Coated with
sea life;  Much of the debris is coated with sea life -- mostly snails, with a
smattering of starfish. But some sections have been scrubbed clean by the
movements of fish, Grech said, and on one of the planes, a bright, shiny metal
surface is visible.;    "This is very encouraging," Grech said, "because it
might mean most of the structure is preserved.";    The camera also spotted
the insignia on one of the wings -- a white star within a blue circle -- and
what may be an inflatable bag used by pilots when they have to ditch over open
water.;    The cockpits were filled with mud, which would have to be vacuumed
out before any recovery attempt, Grech said. In fact, two of the four planes
are mostly buried in sediment. But he said it might be possible to run a sling
under the point where the wings connect to the fuselage -- considered the
strongest point of the structure -- and pull one of the planes up.;   
Artifacts retrieved;  From his control station on board the submersible's
mother ship, Grech manipulated the submersible's claws to lift one of the
plane hooks, a pulley and other artifacts and bring them back to shore. But
the stacks of dishes in the galley posed a problem. On the second day of
diving, the researchers improvised a "crude but effective plate grabber" with
a garden hose and a suction cup, he said; it gently slurped up each plate and
spit it into the sub's collection box.;    Grech said he hopes to collect a
number of the white plastic plates, labeled "Beetleware" on the back, for
display in local museums.;    The control car, originally at the bottom of the
6.5 million-cubic-foot dirigible, was in pieces, Grech said. A single wooden
pencil rested on the debris; nearby, the sub found a voice tube, a couple of
chairs, a disintegrating door, cabinets, map cases and what could be a cockpit
gauge panel.;    The camera also picked out several of the dirigible's
560-horsepower engines, a number of its 110 fuel tanks and pieces of the 75
miles of girder that made up its frame. But its skin -- more than seven acres
of heavy cotton cloth, impregnated with chemicals and painted the color of
aluminum -- had disappeared.;    Only eight Curtiss F-9C Sparrowhawks were
made, and two of those were experimental. One survives at the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington, D.C.;    The single-engine, single-seat biplanes,
which could reach 177 mph at top speed, were best known for their ability to
"land" and "take off" with a giant hook atop the Sparrowhawk's fuselage,
catching a trapeze lowered from the dirigible.;    But for a young daredevil
like Harold "Min" Miller, the fun was all in flying.;    Survived plunge; 
Miller, who survived the Point Sur ocean plunge, flew the plane four years for
the Macon and its sister ship, the USS Akron.;    "They were the finest little
airplanes, the greatest stunt airplane I ever flew," said Miller, a retired
rear admiral who lives in Kansas City, in a November interview. "They were
tricky. Very few pilots flew them. Very few pilots wanted to fly them.;    "It
had lots of power. It could do everything. It was built very strongly, that's
the way she was. I wish I had another one. I'd give my eye teeth for one."  </TEXT>
