   A 70-pound girl whose kite took her
on an unscheduled flight returned Saturday to her liftoff site and
managed to stay on the ground as she launched a new set of kite
safety rules.
   DeAndra Anrig's appearance ended a ban on kite flying at
Shoreline Park after the 8-year-old's kite string snagged on a
passing airplane March 20 and carried her 10 feet off the ground
for at least 100 feet.
   The third-grader from Dublin still has deep bruises on her back
but was so excited about Saturday's event that she couldn't sleep
Friday night, according to her mother, Debbie. She flew a stunt
kite for about a minute before it fell to the grass.
   ``It feels fun,'' DeAndra said shyly to a crowd of reporters,
who outnumbered other spectators. ``It was fun just to get the kite
up in the air and flying it.''
   She warned other children not to fly kites next to nearby Palo
Alto Airport, from which planes were taking off and landing over
the park.
   But, she added: ``I want to fly again even though I was hurt.''
   Glenn Lyles, the city's Shoreline manager, had said it was
appropriate to have DeAndra be the first to officially fly a kite
after the regulations were revised.
   Greeting her today with a pat on the head, he said with a laugh,
``You've caused me a lot of work the last month.''
   The story of DeAndra's flight was relayed around the world by
the news media, which dubbed her Mary Poppins, Winnie the Pooh and
the Flying Nun.
   The plane sustained minor damage in the runin with the kite, but
landed safely.
   The city's new guidelines for kite flying at the park, which is
located near both the airport and Moffett Field Naval Air Station,
include a ban on flying kites higher than 150 feet.
   The Federal Aviation Administration made no ruling as to who was
at fault in March when DeAndra was snagged by the airplane,
according to Lyles. The city's report indicates that the kite was
between 200 and 250 feet in the air, but the pilot who struck the
kite claimed to be at 700 feet, he said.
