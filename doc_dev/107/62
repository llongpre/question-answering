   You've seen ``Top Gun'' more than once.
You crave the thrill of streaking across the sky on the enemy's
tail, targeting their fighter jet, making the kill. Savoring the
victory.
   But you've never flown a plane.
   Welcome to Air Combat USA where, for $495, anyone _ would-be Red
Barons or combat veterans nostalgic for the past _ can take
Italian-made propeller aircraft up for dogfights over peacetime
Southern California.
   ``It takes nothing but a desire to get into the airplane,'' said
Greg Sloan, one of eight pilots who fly with Air Combat customers
in the dual-control planes.
   The 2-year-old enterprise, started by commercial airline pilot
Mike Blackstone, has pitted friend against friend, son against
father, spouse against spouse.
   ``We've had everything from high school students to 50th wedding
anniversary husband-and-wife air combat,'' said Blackstone. In that
encounter, he said, ``The woman shot him down over and over again.''
   The one-day fighter fantasy includes an hour of ground school,
an hour of flying and a debriefing. There's also a keepsake: A
videotape of the adventure made by a cockpit camera.
   Customers take the adventure as far as courage, and their
instructor, will allow. They can perform a ballet of rolling
scissors, high and low yo-yos, lag rolls and loops in pursuit of
their opponent.
   The so-called ``kills,'' simulated by a trail of smoke emitted
by the victim aircraft, are verified by a tracking system developed
by Blackstone, an aeronautical engineer.
   The invention was spurred by a friendly rivalry with pilot Bill
Bancroft, who helped him get the business going. Now arguments over
whether a kill was good are settled electronically _ followed by
triumphant shouts of ``Yeeehaawww!''
   Air Combat's three planes, decked out in Navy stripings or the
markings of a gray Russian MIG, fly out of Fullerton Airport 25
miles south of downtown Los Angeles.
   The missions take place over unpopulated areas, outside of
federal airways and above 1,500 feet, as required by Federal
Aviation Administration regulations, Blackstone said. The planes
remain 500 feet apart.
   He doesn't dismiss questions about safety.
   ``There's always danger _ it's flying,'' Blackstone said. ``This
is Southern California, and there's a lot of airplanes. But we fly
only on good visibility days and maintain a vigil for other
aircraft at all times. When we spot one, we stop the flight.''
   Air Combat has had no accidents, he said.
   Sloan, a 20-year Marine veteran who flew nearly 300 missions in
Vietnam, said he isn't nervous about his novice charges: ``I've
been instructing air combat maneuvers since 1973. There's nothing
they can do that I haven't seen. I'm having as much fun now as I
did then.''
   The Marchetti SF-260 aircraft have a top cruising speed of 250
mph.
   The pilots can be surprised by human nature, however: the man
who begs them to turn back right after takeoff, or the woman who
relishes every bit of G-force as she repeatedly bests a pilot with
1,500 hours of flight time.
   Business has boomed in the six months since Blackstone installed
his kill tracking system in Air Combat's three planes. Sloan said
the company has more than 700 bookings.
   ``There are former fighter pilots from Vietnam to World War II
coming out to relive their experiences,'' Sloan said. ``We've had
people fly in from Scandinavia to Tokyo.''
   The Air Combat pilots downplay the connection to the Tom Cruise
movie ``Top Gun,'' which focused on the Miramar Naval Air Station's
Fighter Weapons School, popularly known as Top Gun, in San Diego.
   ``The draw we get is from the actual fact they can fly the
airplane,'' Sloan said. ``Safety is the prime directive _ and fun
next.''
