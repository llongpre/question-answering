   ``And we are going forward with research on a new Orient Express
that could, by the end of the next decade, take off from Dulles
Airport, accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound, attaining
low Earth orbit or flying to Tokyo within two hours.''
   _ Ronald Reagan, State of the Union address, Feb. 4, 1986.

   The idea has a nice ring to
it: Tokyo in two hours. Zooming over the Earth at 25 times the
speed of sound. Crossing the Pacific in an airplane so
revolutionary the space shuttle and the Concorde become old hat.
   Third millenium, here we come.
   That airplane, or something like it, is taking shape at this and
other NASA centers in bits and pieces: a model is assaulted in a
wind tunnel by 4,800 mph blasts in temperatures hundreds of degrees
below zero; an electron beam illuminates air flow around a
scaled-down plane; a sleek cylinder zips through a water trough
3,000-feet long, sensitive to every nuance of resistance; a
photograph captures shock wave and heat patterns in ghostly hues of
green, orange, yellow, blue and magenta; the most powerful computer
ever built ingests world-class problems and spits out answers; a
standard airplane circles over Chesapeake Bay, piloted not from the
standard cockpit in front, but from a second, all-electronic one,
in its passenger section.
   The ``Little A'' in NASA _ the aeronautics part of National
Aeronautics and Space Administration _ is not as flashy as the
``Big S'' and gets only 7 percent of the agency's budget, but its
accomplishments brush our lives in thousands of ways.
   A poultry plant in Marietta, Ga., is quieter because of NASA
aeronautics; water quality in many places is improved because of
aeronautics technology; firemen wear better protective clothing.
   ``We are called the space agency by many, probably including
yourself,'' Jeremiah F. Creedon, the director for flight systems at
the Langley Research Center, tells a visitor, a bit of resignation
in his voice. ``Many of us here think the A is a large one.''
   Langley's work is divided roughly 60 percent aeronautics, 40
percent space, with a hefty dose of military work in both. With
other NASA research centers _ Ames and Dryden in California and
Lewis in Ohio _ its business is to develop technology and pass it
on, without cost, to aircraft companies. The federal government has
played that role from the start of its involvement 70 years ago.
   The agency has never built an airplane, but few planes fly today
without engines, designs, materials and structures conceived at
NASA. ``We are doing research that benefits the country,'' says
Creedon. ``It is available to Boeing, Lockheed and McDonnell
Douglas, whoever wants to build transport or high performance
aircraft.'' No single company alone could afford NASA's $2 billion
investment in wind tunnels.
   Here at Langley, they don't talk about the ``Orient Express.''
It's either the NASP, the National Aerospace Plane, or better yet
the X-30, next in a string of experimental planes that began with
Chuck Yeager's X-1, breaker of the sound barrier.
   When President Reagan made his rosy prediction about the Orient
Express, a week after the Challenger space shuttle disaster,
engineers had already taken years to decide the X-30 was possible.
Reagan's one paragraph announcement signaled the start of Phase 2,
perfecting the technology, which will last until the summer of
1990, when engineers will take a hard look at where they stand and
decide whether to build the X-30. Phase 3, in the mid-90s, would
see the aerospace plane begin flight tests that would finish as the
21st century begins.
   That's the timetable for the largest experimental aircraft
project ever undertaken by the United States. It will cost $3.3
billion. Clearly NASA and the Air Force, which is sharing the cost,
have something more practical in mind than building one or two
prototype planes, merely to prove it can be done.
   The military and package-delivery firms such as Federal Express
and UPS are the only ones likely to have use for a plane flying 25
times the speed of sound _ fast enough to get into orbit. But the
aerospace plane will provide the technology for the somewhat slower
but far more useful aircraft of the future.
