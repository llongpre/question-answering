   The high-flying Blackbird
spy plane, which flew faster than a bullet, was officially grounded
after a quarter-century of service.
   The SR-71 ``is an aircraft that has ... truly reached out and
touched the face of God,'' Gen. John Chain Jr., chief of the
Strategic Air Command, said Friday, referring to a famous poem
about flight.
   The crews who took the plane to record heights at speeds of
2,100 mph are ``true American heroes,'' Chain said at Blackbird's
retirement ceremony attended by about 1,000 people.
   The dagger-shaped planes, which the Air Force calls the world's
fastest and highest flying airplane, were permanently grounded in
November.
   The unarmed twin-engine planes capable of photographing a
vehicle license plate from 15 miles above the earth will be
exhibited at museums across the nation.
   ``For me, it's a sad day,'' said Ben Rich, a Lockheed Corp. vice
president who helped design the Blackbird.
   ``I was there at its birth,'' Rich said. ``I'm here at its
retirement. ... We gave the world its finest. But we must go on.''
   A federal budget measure signed last year by President George
Bush deleted more than $200 million for the aging Blackbirds.
   Critics in Congress said the loss of the more versatile SR-71
will leave a gap in U.S. surveillance capabilities.
   ``It's not that there's no need for it. It's just that we're
constrained by money,'' Lt. Col. Rod Dyckman said after flying an
SR-71. ``This will all hit me a little later, that this was my last
flight.''
   The nine existing SR-71s surrounded the stage at the ceremony.
Originally the Air Force had 30 Blackbirds; officials said some
crashed and others simply wore out.
   The Blackbirds' destinations include the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Air Force Museum at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio.
   Other Air Force base museums scheduled to receive the Blackbirds
will be Offutt in Nebraska; Lackland in Texas; Robins in Georgia;
and Edwards, March and Castle in California.
   One of the jets will go to the museum here, about 110 miles
northeast of San Francisco. The aircraft also operated out of air
fields in Mildenhall, England, and Kadena Air Base in Okinawa.
   Its pilots and navigators, who wore spacesuits during flight,
say they have been attacked numerous times by missiles fired from
ground forces or jet fighters.
   The plane was the first to employ the stealth or radar-evading
technology that is the hallmark of the nation's newest military
aircraft.
   Nearly three decades after the first Blackbirds were built by
Lockheed, the jets still hold world records for speed and altitude.
   The Blackbird's top capabilities remain secret, but the Air
Force says it flies to more than 85,000 feet at more than 2,100 mph
_ or over three times the speed of sound. That's roughly 35 miles a
minute _ faster than a bullet; fast enough to streak from San
Francisco to New York in 1 hour, 45 minutes.
