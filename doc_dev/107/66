   The second flight of the
B-2 stealth bomber was scrubbed Tuesday because a preflight
checklist took too long to complete to get a full day's flight test
completed, the Air Force said.
   Col. Don Weisert, the B-2's deputy program director at Ohio's
Wright-Patterson AFB, also blamed the weather and said in a
telephone interview, ``There was nothing wrong with the airplane.''
   ``We expected winds to come up and we wanted to make sure we
could get in a full day of activity,'' he said.
   A statement released at Edwards said: ``The second flight of the
B-2 has been delayed because of the crew rest requirement. They have
been on duty on preflight status for the maximum time for safety.''
   Air Force officials did not specify how long was the allowable
duty day for the B-2 crew. Flight crews, however, must be allowed
sufficient periods of rest depending on the requirements of the
mission.
   The three- to four-hour second flight, which may include
retracting its landing gear, faster speeds and higher altitudes, was
initially planned for Saturday but was postponed.
   After a five-hour delay on Tuesday, the ominous-looking flying
wing emerged from its hangar at about 12:30 p.m. and rested for
about 90 minutes before the mission was scrubbed.
   Captain Tess Taft, an Air Force spokeswoman reached at
Wright-Patterson said, ``It looks good for tomorrow.''
   On its July 17 maiden flight, Northrop Corp. test pilot Bruce J.
Hinds and Air Force Col. Richard Couch flew the B-2 for nearly two
hours and reached an altitude of 10,000 feet without retracting the
landing gear.
   The B-2, a tailless, 172-foot-long wing with bulges in the
middle, was described by Couch as a ``very nimble aircraft'' and ``a
lot of fun'' to fly.
   The $530 million, four-engine bomber, engineered to elude radar
detection, is designed to carry nuclear bombs and, along with the
conventional B-1, replace the Air Force's aged B-52 bomber fleet
that forms part of the U.S. nuclear deterrent against the Soviet
Union.
   The so-called stealth technology combines advanced composite
materials and a special shape to create a plane believed to be
undetectable by enemy radar. Though the bomber is still being
developed, stealth fighters have operated for several years.
   The government has already invested about $22.4 billion in the
B-2 program, which is 18 months behind schedule, and Congress has
balked at the thought of paying more than $500 million apiece for
132 bombers.
   On July 14, the Senate Armed Services Committee approved
President Bush's $305.5 billion defense-spending request for fiscal
1990, but stipulated no money could be spent on the B-2 until it
flew.
   Despite the bomber's first successful flight, however,
congressional opposition remains.
   Shrouded in secrecy for 10 years, Northrop and the Pentagon last
month began an intensive campaign to surmount stealth foes. A list
of 156 B-2 contractors in 26 states and the District of Columbia was
declassified.
   The Pentagon wants $4.7 billion for the bomber in the coming
fiscal year, and it may need $8 billion in each of the three years
of peak production, 1992 to 1994.
