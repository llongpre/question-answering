   Apollo astronauts Wally Schirra and
Buzz Aldrin lent their support Thursday to a museum auction that
aviation buffs hope will do for old airplanes what Sotheby's does
for Rembrandts and Van Goghs.
   ``These planes are works of art in their own right,'' said
Donald Douglas Jr., whose father built the DC-3 and countless other
planes made famous in war and peace. ``We hope this auction does
very well by them.''
   The auction will be held May 19 and 20 at the grounds of the
Museum of Flying, located where Douglas Sr. once ran his aircraft
works.
   Aircraft offered for sale include classic ``war birds'' of World
War II vintage _ Spitfires that gained fame in the Battle of
Britain and P-51 Mustangs that escorted American bombers to targets
over Nazi Germany.
   Bidding on a P-38 twin-boom Lightning fighter built by Lockheed
begins at $1.1 million in the auction catalog.
   A reproduction of a bright red Fokker of the type flown by the
Red Baron's squadron during World War I lists for a modest $25,000.
   The museum, sitting next to the Santa Monica Airport's runways,
is on the site where Army Air Corps planes built by Douglas
departed in 1924 on a historic round-the-world flight.
   One of the biplanes from that flight hangs in the museum.
Another is at the Smithsonian Institution's Air &amp; Space Museum in
Washington.
   Aldrin, whose 1969 moon walk electrified the globe, joined
Douglas and Schirra at the museum preview and joked about space and
flight, nicknames and missions in the clouds and beyond.
   ``You gave me a bit of boost,'' Schirra quipped to Douglas.
   The auction's purpose is to raise funds for the Museum of Flying
and to support scholarships for students who pursue aviation
careers, said David Price, president of the 18-month-old facility.
   ``We believe this will be the most historic auction of antique
aircraft ever,'' said Price. ``It's like mounting a Broadway show.
You don't know if it's going to work until opening night.''
   A few years after the war, Price noted that a shrewd bargainer
could pick up a surplus P-51 Mustang at a country air field for as
little as $2,000. The same plane now commands a $500,000 pricetag.
   A rich history has flamed the passion for planes, Price said.
Hundreds of thousands of people attend air shows every year and the
Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington is the best attended of all the
Smithsonian displays.
   ``The fighter planes hark back to chivalry and knighthood,''
said Price, who operates golf courses when he isn't flying one of
his two Spitfires over the Santa Monica Mountains.
   Volunteers at the museum in Santa Monica point out with pride
that most of the aircraft on display there can be flown.
   ``The kids can smell the gasoline, and they can see that these
airplanes are not relics,'' Price said. ``They are something that
works.''
