San Diego State University journalism professor January Riddle received her 
license to fly in 1983. Riddle, 46, mainly a recreational flier, had previously 
competed in only two small-scale races. But when the opportunity to fly in the 
Air Race Classic, the Super Bowl of women's aviation races, arose this summer, 
she teamed with experienced pilot Sally Bocinski. They borrowed a Cessna 172 
for the 2,600-mile, four-day journey that took the racers to obscure airports 
in New Mexico, Kansas, Arkansas, Illinois and West Virginia before ending in 
York, Pa. Riddle, a member of the 99's, an international organization for women 
pilots founded by Amelia Earhart, is now preparing for a 500-mile, one-day race 
later this month. Riddle spoke with Times staff writer Terry Rather and was 
photographed by Bob Grieser.

It was wonderful being with all those accomplished women pilots. The race was 
never scary but was very intense, more so than I thought it would be. 
</P>
<P>
It's not like getting in a plane and leisurely going somewhere. Every minute 
you're concentrating on not getting off course, making sure the plane is flying 
at full capacity every single second, and watching the weather. It takes all of 
the skills that you ever learned and tests them every single moment. 
</P>
<P>
The start of the race was a thrill. It was a staggered start with airplanes 
taking off every 10 seconds. At the beginning of the race, no one talks to you. 
But, after you've flown, people say, "You're still here, you didn't flake out, 
you're still with us." Then you become part of the group. It's a special group, 
and it becomes an important part of your life.

<P>
The airplane we had was one of the slowest allowed in the race, so we were 
actually in the air seven to eight hours a day. It took us three days to finish 
the race. So it was three days of getting up at 4:30 in the morning. That was 
the killer. We had to be able to take off at the first possible minute because 
our airplane was so slow, and we had to land by sunset. 
</P>
<P>
I had never flown east of Arizona or north of Oregon, so I had a very small 
scope of what flying is like. There were 48 other planes, and no one had to fly 
at a certain altitude. You just watched what you're doing because it's up to 
you. It always is. The ultimate responsibility is with the pilot in all 
situations. But these races are surprisingly safe. The record for women's air 
races is very good. There were no crashes or injuries in this race, even though 
the possibility and potential was there. 
</P>
<P>
Finishing the race was an incredible experience. It was very challenging and 
very rewarding. The only thing I can compare winning that race to would be like 
getting an Oscar. It is the absolute, the ultimate, to say you won that race in 
that kind of competition. We finished 33rd, which is reputable. We were happy 
we did that well. 
</P>
<P>
Flying feels so free, so liberating. You're totally self-sufficient, really 
relying on you and your machine. I feel so fortunate to be able to do this. 
</P>
<P>
When I first started flying, I took a lot of kidding from the guys. There 
weren't a lot of women at that time taking lessons at that club. A lot of women 
who learn to fly do it because their boyfriends or husbands fly, not because 
they want to. There's a difference. That made me a little unique, because I 
wanted to fly. 
</P>
<P>
I always wanted to fly, but there was always something, like college or the job 
or husband and kids. Women tend to do that, put off their own dreams in favor 
of others. I found myself looking at my 40th birthday, so I decided now it's my 
turn, now I'm going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
Flying is really great. When I get a little crabby, my friends ask me how long 
it's been since I've flown. "You haven't flown in a while, have you?" My 
friends can tell when I haven't flown. 
</P>
<P>
It's an addiction. Anything that makes you feel so good makes you want to keep 
doing it. I'm amazed that people can learn to fly and not keep doing it. I 
can't even imagine that. It would be so painful to not be able to do that 
anymore. Flying adds an entire new dimension to your life.
