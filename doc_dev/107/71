   If you wanted to spend as much time
in the air as Frances Miller and Sylvia Roth, you'd have to lift
off right now and not set your plane down until late 1992.
   The two _ pilots, flight instructors and business partners with
a combined total of more than 40,000 hours of flying time _ retire
their wings this year.
   Ms. Miller, who was one of the first women in the state to
receive the pilot examiners rating back in the 1950s, retires
Friday, while Ms. Roth plans to retire in June. She was the first
woman in the nation to be designated an airline transport pilot
examiner by the Federal Aviation Administration in 1968.
   The women, both 62, will be honored Friday by the South Carolina
Aeronautics Commission. They ran a flight school in Columbia for 16
years.
   Over their combined 90-year careers, they've taught thousands of
pilots to fly and many of their former charges now are with major
airlines around the world.
   But flying was a man's pursuit when they started flying.
   ``I started when I was 17,'' Ms. Miller said. ``I just wanted to
fly.''
   ``Airplanes were something different. And Amelia Earhart was
doing her thing at that time,'' said Ms. Roth. ``They were doing
all sorts of different things and setting records.''
   Flying is easier today than it once was _ what with better
planes and more sophisticated cockpit equipment, they said. But
it's not quite as much fun, Ms. Miller said.
   ``When I was learning to fly there were so few restrictions,''
she said. ``You could take an airplane _ a J-3 Cub that didn't have
anything in it but an air speed indicator and altimeter _ and just
go anywhere in the country.''
   During their careers of teaching students the two have had
``close calls but no disasters,'' Ms. Miller said. Student pilots
tend to react in predictable ways, and instructors can usually
anticipate problems.
   ``You know what to expect,'' she said. ``Most people have the
same apprehensions and the same fears.''
