   The centennial-year election to settle,
once and for all, whether Helena or Anaconda should be Montana's
capital city has taken an unexpected turn, a long turn, several
hundreds miles to the east.
   The leader in early returns in the $1-a-vote election is
Bismarck, N.D.
   As of May 19, says Jim Bouck, chairman of the Anaconda
Centennial Committee, the vote totals were 159 for Anaconda, 219
for Helena and 387 for Bismarck.
   Anaconda, a small former copper-smelting town west of Butte, has
long contended that Helenans stole the 1894 election for state
capital. Helena won by 1,906 votes out of a total 55,000 votes cast
_ in a state with only 51,000 registered voters.
   The centennial committees for the two cities are sponsoring the
voting with the charge of $1 per vote considered in keeping with
the flavor of the original election.
   The two top vote-getters in the decidedly non-binding primary,
to be counted July 4, will go on a general election ballot in
November. Final results will be announced at the Nov. 8 centennial
ball _ to be held in Helena, not Anaconda.

   Small children are at the controls of
airplanes again. Now the family of a 9-year-old Virginia boy says
he is the youngest pilot to fly across the United States.
   Elliott Shoup, of Falls Church, Va., came to visit his
grandparents in Portland in a single-engine Piper he flew from the
Quantico Marine Corps Air Station, Va., to Hillsboro Airport, just
west of Portland.
   ``It was good all the way,'' Elliott said after the six-day trip
ended Friday.
   He was accompanied by his father, Frank Shoup, a pilot and
former aviation instructor who now works at the Pentagon.
   The pair flew for only three or four hours each day, with
Elliott peering over the controls from a large pile of cushions.
   ``It's pretty hard because you have to do so many things,'' the
boy said.
   In 1988, 9-year-old Tony Aliengena of San Juan Capistrano,
Calif., flew his father's Cessna 210 to Boston, but Elliott's
family said Tony was almost 10 when he made the flight.
   It was not certain if Elliott's record will be counted because
no National Aeronautics Association observer was on the plane, but
Elliott's father said that wasn't the point.
   ``We didn't do it to beat a record or anything,'' he said. ``We
came here for Grandma's apple pie.''

   After 30 years in the Air Force,
retired combat pilot Art Johnson is on a busman's holiday, building
radio-controlled model airplanes and other flying machines.
   ``Other flying machines'' covers such things as a near-lifesize
witch he frequently sends zooming at rooftop level on a broom-like
contraption, and a flying doghouse with Snoopy from the ``Peanuts''
cartoon.
   A three-time national scale-model champion, Johnson now competes
with a radio-controlled model of a B-26 bomber like those he flew
in 65 combat missions over Europe in World War II.
   It took five years to build, has a nine-foot wingspan and is
powered by two four-cycle engines. The radio controls operate the
throttle, rudder and aileron, turn on landing lights, open bomb bay
doors and release replica bombs.
   The witch flies with the help of a section of black umbrella
that serves as an airfoil, sort of like a hang glider.
   Snoopy's doghouse uses the overhanging edges of the roof as
wings.
   ``There's a personal accomplishment and satisfaction of flying
something you've built,'' said Johnson, 69.
   ``But it's not as easy as it looks. I could teach someone to fly
a full-sized aircraft easier than a model,'' he said.

   Hood College President Martha E. Church
received a present from each of the 283 graduates at commencement,
but they all got her the same thing _ again.
   As Ms. Church handed out the diplomas Saturday, each student
passed her a Lego block to be used, according to a note from the
seniors, for a new library the school is building.
   She appeared relieved, said Don Schumaker, the college's
assistant director of communications. ``She was expecting jelly
beans or cat food. Her nickname growing up was Junior Jelly Bean,
and she has two cats, Rama and Fita,'' he said.
   It was the fifth year that Hood seniors have conspired to
surprise Ms. Church on graduation day. In past years, they've given
her pennies, marbles, pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, even live goldfish
in little plastic bags.
   ``This has really been a lot of fun so far,'' Ms. Church said.
``I haven't told the students this, but it's been helpful for them
too. I haven't had to shake a clammy hand in four years. It helps
them relax.''
