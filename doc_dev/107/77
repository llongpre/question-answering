   A pilot on a sentimental journey
once upon a time could pick up a surplus World War II fighter for
about $2,000. But the asking price now can soar higher than $1
million.
   Hoping to cash in on a craze that has become a rich man's hobby,
the Museum of Flying in this city with a rich aviation history
plans an auction of historic aircraft on May 19 and 20.
   ``We believe this will be the most historic auction of antique
aircraft ever,'' museum President David Price said. ``It's like
mounting a Broadway show. You don't know if it's going to work
until opening night.''
   Apollo astronauts Wally Schirra and Buzz Aldrin were among
aerospace notables who showed up Thursday to lend their support at
a preview of the planes listed for sale.
   Planes that were once abandoned in rusty hangars and barns have
been lovingly restored. P-51 Mustang fighters that once escorted
bombers through Nazi flak sport fresh paint jobs and jaunty names
like ``Stiletto.''
   A few years after the war, Price said, a shrewd bargainer could
pick up a surplus Mustang at a country air field for as little as
$2,000. The same plane now commands a $500,000 pricetag or better.
   A rare restored P-38 Lightning twin-boom fighter of the sort
that once knocked down Japanese ``Zero'' fighters in the Pacific is
on the auction block for more than $1 million. Rarity dictates
price.
   ``Unfortunately, they are perishable,'' Price said. ``If you
don't fly them, they deteriorate. And sometimes, they crash.''
   Proceeds of the auction will support aviation scholarships and
museum restoration. Price hopes some investors or altruists will
buy airplanes, then keep them at the museum where they will be
maintained in flying condition.
   A rich history has flamed the passion for buying and flying such
planes, said Price, who operates golf courses for a living but
comes to life when he is flying a Spitfire dubbed ``Evelyn.''
   Hundreds of thousands of people attend air shows every year and
the Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington is the best attended of all
the Smithsonian Institution displays.
   ``The fighter planes hark back to chivalry and knighthood,''
Price said. ``The men who flew them were heroes, and everyone
responds to that, I think.''
   Children, particularly, are drawn to the flying exhibits, Price
said.
   ``The kids can smell the gasoline, and they can see that these
airplanes are not relics,'' Price said. ``They're not mummified.''
   ``These planes are works of art in their own right,'' said
Donald Douglas Jr., whose father built the DC-3 and countless other
planes made famous in war and peace.
   The auction will be held at the museum grounds, next to the
Santa Monica Airport's runways, on the site where Army Air Corps
planes built by Douglas departed in 1924 on a historic
round-the-world flight.
   One of the biplanes from that flight hangs in the museum.
Another is at the Air &amp; Space Museum in Washington.
