It was about 2 a.m. Saturday when eight UC Irvine engineering students 
converged on a campus athletic field to assemble the human-powered airplane 
they worked all year to perfect. 
</P>
<P>
By the light of fluorescent lamps powered through yards of orange extension 
cords, the students joined the tail boom to the fuselage, attached the 
propeller, assembled six wing sections and covered most of the aircraft with 
transparent Mylar. 
</P>
<P>
Before daybreak, there it was: Pegasus, its 100-foot-long single wing suspended 
like a giant white ruler against a backdrop of trees. And despite a soggy 
morning and a series of mechanical failures, the ungainly aircraft powered by a 
fast-pedaling cyclist actually got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"You hear the wheels on the ground and then all of a sudden there's nothing 
between you and the ground," said team member Jeanne Pandes, 22, who piloted 
the plane on its first short flights. "You're cruising." 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus is the third and most successful attempt by UC Irvine mechanical 
engineering students to construct a human-powered airplane as a senior project. 
The 1987 airplane, dubbed the UC Medfly, crashed almost immediately after 
leaving the ground. Last year's 
</P>
<P>
plane, UC-ME-FLY ("you see me fly"), succeeded in making flights of close to 
300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The Pegasus team used wing sections from UC-ME-FLY, but built a new, more 
aerodynamic fuselage that reduced the airplane's weight from 135 pounds to 120 
pounds, said project leader Greg Hill, 23. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-foot-long aircraft is made of balsa wood, sturdy carbon fiber tubing and 
transparent Mylar, a plastic coating. 
</P>
<P>
Pegasus is one of eight senior projects in the mechanical engineering 
department, whose students also designed a human-powered car and a 
human-powered hydrofoil, both of which are scheduled to make their debut Monday 
morning in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
About 7 a.m. Saturday, the weather was a major source of anxiety for the 
Pegasus team. An infrequent drizzle covered the wings with a film of water, 
which one student patiently scraped off with a yellow squeegee. Because of the 
wing's large surface area, Hill estimated that the drizzle added about 10 
pounds to the airplane's weight. 
</P>
<P>
Wearing black tights, white tennis shoes and a Pegasus T-shirt, Pandes crawled 
into the triangular cockpit and experimented with the pedals. The covered 
cockpit bore the advertising logos of the dozen companies that donated about 
$8,000 to build Pegasus. 
</P>
<P>
The team positioned itself for the takeoff, one student holding up the end of 
each wing and several more supporting the fuselage and tail. Pandes began 
pedaling and Pegasus quivered unsteadily from nose to tail. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's go, Jeanne," one student urged the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
The aircraft lifted off the ground, traveling perhaps 15 feet, then one of the 
wires holding the wings to the fuselage snapped. The students repaired the wire 
and tried again. Pandes piloted the airplane for four more flights, the longest 
of which was about 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pegasus needed more power. So the second pilot, amateur cyclist Arcadio 
Biboso, was called in. 
</P>
<P>
Clad in yellow and black Spandex, Biboso's powerful legs lifted Pegasus on a 
60-foot flight. But he reported a problem with the pedaling mechanism -- the 
chain linking the pedals to the propeller shaft kept jerking, causing the 
airplane to lose momentum. 
</P>
<P>
The team discussed ways to correct the problem and, in a last-ditch effort, 
attached a chain-tightening device with quick-drying epoxy glue and some 
string. 
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, with Biboso at the controls, Pegasus made its longest 
flight ever: nearly 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
The next attempt was even more successful, with the airplane staying aloft for 
more than 300 feet. 
</P>
<P>
But as Pegasus was landing, the right wing hit the ground and snapped in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
In a post-mortem of Pegasus' flight, Hill mourned that "these wings are so 
long, so fragile . . . but that the plane has stayed together through all these 
rough landings says something for us, I guess."
