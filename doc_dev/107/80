<LEADPARA>  The Air Force has cut short several recent test flights of the B-2 Stealth
bomber because computerized flight controls have suffered continuing problems,
according to internal Northrop Corp. documents.;    Because of its tailless
"flying wing" design, the advanced bomber relies on computers to guarantee the
stability of its flight surfaces and controls.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A report Thursday night on ABC's "Primetime Live" news magazine show said
that problems with the computers curtailed air time on flight tests during the
past three months.;    A 1988 Northrop internal company memo cited in the
report said the computer problems were severe enough that a potential
multiple-system failure "could lead to total vehicle loss.";    Another memo,
issued in February 1989, six months after the first memo, describes "serious
problems currently known and the persistence with which still more are being
found" led to circumstances termed "not acceptable.";    Northrop spokesman
Tony Cantafio said the airplane flies well.;    In recent weeks the aircraft
flew from Edwards Air Force Base in California to Andrews Air Force Base in
Maryland with no trouble, and "the day the broadcast aired, the B-2 flew over
six hours with no problems," he said.;    "I think the critics can't stand
that the B-2 flies and flies well and it works.";    A separate problem, with
the B-2's equipment designed to befuddle enemy radar systems, was severe
enough that a former Northrop analyst, Richard Sylvester, said he was ordered
to destroy a report about it.;    "He ordered me to destroy the report,"
Sylvester said. "He said, 'We don't want the Air Force to find out about the
contents of this report."' The supervisor who allegedly gave the order was not
identified on the television program.;    The estimated cost of each aircraft
is more than $500 million, with some congressional critics saying it could
cost up to $1 billion a plane. It is the most expensive aircraft ever
developed.;    The "Primetime" report said the Air Force confirmed that
problems with the flight control computers caused three test flights to be cut
short, two of those flights occurring within the past three months.;    Air
Force Gen. Stephen Croker, director of the B-2 acquisition program, played
down the significance of the Northrop documents.;    "If we thought the
airplane wasn't safe to fly, we would not be risking our test pilots' lives
today," he said. "And we're not."  </TEXT>
