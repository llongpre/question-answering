   The B-2 stealth bomber
soared 10,000 feet over the desert floor, but a low oil-pressure
reading forced its second test flight to end several hours early.
   Air Force Col. Richard S. Couch and Northrop Corp. chief test
pilot Bruce J. Hinds brought the radar-evading aircraft down
Wednesday morning because of the reading, officials said.
   ``We don't even know if it's a problem yet. We're concerned with
it and will have to check it out,'' said 1st Lt. Anu Sjaardema, an
Air Force spokeswoman.
   The flight, scheduled to last three to four hours, began at 7:29
a.m. in the Mojave Desert and ended at 8:36 a.m.
   The two men were never in danger, and the plane did achieve at
least one objective by flying with its landing gear retracted for
the first time, Sjaardema said.
   Nevertheless, Couch and Hinds ``obviously would have liked to
accomplish more,'' she said.
   The government already has invested about $22.4 billion in the
B-2 program, and Congress has balked at paying more than $500
million apiece for the 132 bombers the military wants, making it the
most expensive airplane in history.
   Sjaardema said the big, black flying wing went ``a little bit
faster and a little bit higher'' than on the first flight in July.
But Air Force Maj. Dick Cole said later at the Pentagon that the
plane ``was flown to a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet and a maximum
air speed of 180 knots.'' That is the same elevation and speed as
during the two-hour maiden flight of July 17.
   Low oil pressure was reported in one of the plane's four
accessory drives. Each drive is like a transmission, connected to
one of the B-2's four engines by a shaft. The drives power air
turbine starters and hydraulic systems, Sjaardema said.
   Air turbine starters are used to start engines, a Northrop
spokesman said. The B-2's hydraulics apparently control its landing
gear, but it isn't known if they are used to move flaps and other
control surfaces, as is the case on many planes. Tech. Sgt. Donn
Clarius said there was no failure of the hydraulic system.
   It was the second setback in two days for the flying wing.
   Delays caused by wind and a long list of preflight checks on
Tuesday forced officials to move the test back a day.
   The Air Force's first attempt to fly the plane last month was
aborted because of a low fuel-pressure reading. That problem was
fixed.
