   Flying enthusiasts from Brazil to Australia
have gathered here for what some call an aviation paradise, where
supersonic jets fly over the countryside, pilots discuss the latest
innovations and flying families camp under the wings of planes.
   They are here for the 36th annual Experimental Aircraft
Association fly-in and convention. An estimated 1 million people
and 14,000 planes are expected to visit Wittman Field before the
week-long convention ends Friday.
   ``People who are into airplanes are airplane nuts and this is
like Mecca to us and we'll do anything to get to Oshkosh,'' said
Frank Stankiewicz, 53, of Fort Meyers, Fla.
   Thousands of them crowd the flight line during the daily
airshows to watch a fly-by of the supersonic Concorde or see a
Wildcat Flyer, a biplane crop duster, lace the sky with looping
ribbons of pink, yellow and white smoke.
   They fill workshop tents where they learn tips for making wings
and tails out of metal or wood and exhibit halls where they can see
the weather mapping systems.
   They also attend seminars where they can learn such things as,
``How to prepare your aircraft and safety precautions when
painting,'' or ``The basics of friction wear and lubrication.''
   Some camp under the wings of the planes parked wingtip to
wingtip that fill much of the 1,200 acres in the convention area.
Others park in nearby grounds or drive 50 miles away to Green Bay
for a hotel room.
   ``As an aviator and pilot, I wouldn't miss it for the world,''
T. Allan McArtor, Federal Aviation Administration administrator,
said Tuesday.
   McArtor, whose agency adds about 40 extra air traffic
controllers to help direct planes during the convention, called it
``the biggest gathering of the clan'' in general aviation.
   For nine days before and during the convention, Wittman Field
becomes the world's busiest airport with between 57,000 and 60,000
takeoffs and landings, said Zonnie Fritsche, FAA Oshkosh control
tower manager. The average of more than 6,000 operations a day is
more than double the 2,500 Chicago's O'Hare International Airport
usually has, he said.
   By Monday, 1,405 people from 61 countries, including 128 from
Brazil, 64 from England, 165 from Australia and 51 from Japan, had
registered.
   ``They love planes,'' said Flavio Del Mese of Porto Alegre,
Brazil. ``We have small shows, but after you watch Oshkosh, it's
better if you say we have no shows.''
   The aircraft displayed, and in many cases flown, include the B1B
bomber, a Marine Corps Harrier vertical takeoff and landing jet,
the Goodyear blimp, vintage World War II fighters and bombers, and
homebuilt airplanes constructed by association members.
   Convention Chairman Tom Poberezny, whose father, Paul, founded
the EAA in 1953, said the planes may draw the crowds but the real
reason people come is for the company of other aviation buffs.
   The EAA attracts such people as Neil Armstrong, the first man to
walk on the moon, and the crew that flew around the world in the
lightweight Voyager aircraft.
   ``Where else could you talk to the captain of the Concorde or
pilots who flew around the world?'' asked Dr. David Bryant, an EAA
member, pilot and doctor at the medical tent.
   ``Whether you're a doctor or farmer ... you're on the same level
here,'' said Oliver Washburn, 56, a corporate pilot from Pittsburgh.
   For W. K. Kellum, 69, of Jackson, Miss., who has built one plane
and is working on two others, part of the attraction is a flea
market with nuts, bolts, screws and other plane parts.
   ``It would be hard to find around at that price,'' he said. ``It
looks junky to people if they don't know what they want but it
might be just what I need.''
   One volunteer EAA flagman died this year after being struck by a
plane and knocked to the ground, but EAA spokesman John Burton said
there have been fewer than a dozen fatal accidents at the
convention over the years.
