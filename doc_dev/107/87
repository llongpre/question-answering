   The British Midland Airways jet that crashed
Sunday in England was one of the first 737-400s produced by Boeing
Commercial Airplanes, a Boeing spokesman said.
   The 737-400 was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration
in September and ``probably a half dozen or so'' airlines are flying
a total of 17 of the new $28 million to $32 million jets, Boeing
spokesman Jack Gamble said Sunday.
   The Belfast-bound jetliner, which carried 126 people, crashed
near a highway in central England, killing at least 32 people.
   Authorities said the plane developed engine trouble. Witnesses
reported seeing an engine in flames as the jet plummeted toward the
ground.
   Gamble said the plane that crashed was purchased last fall by GPA
Leasing in Shannon, Ireland, which leased it to British Midland. He
said it is the first accident involving a 737-400 or a 737-300,
which is 10 feet shorter than the -400 series.
   He said the engine used on both 737 models is the CFM-56, which
is built in France by a consortium made up of General Electric and
SMECMA, a French concern.
   ``There have been no problems at all with the -300 or the -400,''
he said.
   He said the engines are brought to the United States and
reassembled and tested at a General Electric plant near Cincinnati.
The completed engines are shipped to the Boeing plant at Renton,
where the 737 is manufactured.
   A Boeing team likely will be asked to help investigate the crash
Monday, said David Jiminez, another Boeing spokesman. Company policy
prohibits any speculation about the cause of the crash, he said.
   Gamble said Boeing has built 1,651 copies of the 737. More than
1,500 of them are still flying.
   The 737-400 was rolled out in January 1988 and the first flight
was in March. Depending on the interior design, the jet can seat 130
to 150 passengers. First deliveries of the jet were in September to
Piedmont Airlines.
   The 737 is the smallest jetliner made by Boeing. The first
version of the 737 had its inaugural flight April 9, 1967, with
delivery to airlines later that year.
