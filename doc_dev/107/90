   The Jefferson Airplane, whose soaring vocals
and political lyrics helped define the psychedelic rock of San
Francisco's flower power era, will fly again.
   Grace Slick, Paul Kantner, Jorma Kaukonen and Jack Casady are
planning to reunite for the first time in 17 years and are
reportedly close to signing a recording contract.
   Marty Balin, who left the group after the ``Volunteers'' album in
1969, hasn't come aboard yet, but Kantner is still hoping the singer
will become part of the ``born-again Airplane.''
   ``I think we had all thought about reorganizing the Airplane in
the last few years,' Kantner said after the reunion was announced
Wednesday. He said the idea ``really came together'' after his own
group played at the new Fillmore auditorium in March 1988.
   ``Grace came out to sing at that show and we all felt very good _
Jorma and Jack seemed to like the idea of us all working together
again, and we'd all written new songs and wanted to perform them,''
Kantner said.
   Slick, whose powerful vocals made ``White Rabbit'' and ``Somebody
To Love'' rock'n'roll classics, also sang with Kantner earlier in
1988 at San Francisco's Great American Music Hall.
   The two once lived together and have a daughter, China.
   The Airplane's albums included ``Surrealistic Pillow,'' ``After
Bathing At Baxter's,'' ``Crown of Creation,'' ``Bless Its Pointed
Little Head,'' ``Volunteers,'' ``Bark'' and ``Long John Silver.''
   Casady and Kaukonen formed ``Hot Tuna,'' an acoustic blues band,
in the early 1970s and eventually left the Airplane. Slick and
Kantner worked on several projects together and formed the Jefferson
Starship in 1974.
   Kantner left the Jefferson Starship in 1984, and his departure
led to a legal battle with Slick over money and use of the band's
name. A settlement in 1987 gave the group the right to use the name
Starship; Kantner got $250,000. Slick set out on a solo career early
last year.
   ``Grace seems `reborn' after leaving the Starship group _ she's
become involved in the World Wildlife Fund organization and one of
her new songs is dedicated to pandas,'' Kantner said.
   ``The four of us _ myself, Grace, Jorma and Jack _ are planning
to record, with Ron Nevison producing ... later this spring,'' he
said. Nevison ``was on our road production crew years ago, and now
he's a big record producer.''
   ``We haven't signed a contract, yet; and yes, RCA _ our original
label _ is interested.''
   ``With the record finished and on the market by midsummer, we
hope to go on tour, and we hope, along the way, that Marty will
rejoin us,'' Kantner said. ``Marty has been involved in his own
thing for quite a while and we don't know, now, how he feels about
joining the born-again Airplane. He's very much his own man, you
know.''
   Kantner said each group member will probably have three songs on
the new album. ``Mine will be poetical-political statements like
`Falling in Love with Nicaragua.'''
   Slick said the reunion ``was loose, it wasn't planned.'' She said
the reaction to last year's Fillmore show ``was more striking than
we planned. So we thought we'd make a record.''
