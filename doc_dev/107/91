   Three times in the last 18 months, astronauts
flew jets dangerously close to other airplanes and a government
agency says fatigue and outmoded NASA equipment were at fault.
   ``The three incidents that the safety board has investigated
could have been averted by a second crew member,'' said the
National Transportation Safety Board. ``The safety board therefore
believes that NASA should require an additional flight crew member
aboard all T-38A flights.''
   Astronauts, who are rated among the best pilots in the world,
use the high-performance T-38s for training and as transportation
to and from meetings and public appearances.
   ``Because the T-38A is a high-workload airplane, the safety
board believes that a type of short-term fatigue may develop, which
results in a decreased amount of attention available for all of the
tasks associated with controlling the airplane, navigating, and
communicating with air traffic control,'' the NTSB said.
   In the first incident, on May 15, 1989, shuttle commander David
M. Walker, a Navy captain, flew his plane within 100 feet
vertically and 700 feet horizontally of a Pan Am jetliner with 176
people on board. The distances were calculated by radar.
   The Pan Am crew ``could make out the tail number on the
airplane,'' Tim Borson, an NTSB investigator told the board members
at a hearing Tuesday.
   The airliner had just taken off from Dulles International
Airport en route to Paris and Walker was arriving in the Washington
area to be congratulated the next day by President Bush for
completing a successful shuttle mission.
   Although none of the NASA pilots was identified in the NTSB
report to NASA Administrator Richard Truly, Walker's involvement
was known. He was suspended from T-38 flights for 60 days in July
and replaced as commander of a space shuttle mission scheduled for
next year. The suspension has ended and Walker once again is in
line for a space flight, but probably not until at least 1992.
   Both NTSB and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
said the system which encourages pilots to report near misses also
protects their privacy. The two unidentified flyers reported the
incidents involving them.
   The second of the near-collisions occurred on Sept. 17, 1989
over Texas, when a NASA pilot returning from Edwards Air Force Base
in California flew 2,000 feet below his assigned altitude and
``conflicted'' with a Piper Cheyenne, the NTSB said. Radar showed
one plane 1,400 feet above the other and three miles to the side.
The pilots did not see one another.
   On May 6, over Kentucky, a NASA jet was told to fly at 37,000
feet but apparently thought he was assigned to 27,000. As the T-38
descended, said NTSB, it came within 1,500 feet vertically and
three miles horizontally of an Eastern Airlines DC-9.
   Such separations are classed as near-misses because of the
speeds involved. At supersonic speed, aircraft can travel more than
1,100 feet a second.
   The safety board said the T-38's communications equipment was
``outdated and far from state-of-the-art.''
   Dan Brandenstein, chief of the astronaut corps, said in Houston
that ``we have realized the avionics have come a long way since the
T-38 was developed 30 years ago.'' He said one of the planes is
being modified with a view of upgrading the entire fleet.
   The NTSB recommended that the upgrading be accelerated and that
another flyer occupy the back seat in the two-seater aircraft to
aid the busy T-38 pilot. Brandenstein said ``we strive to make that
happen'' but that it isn't always possible.
   In all three cases investigated by the NTSB, the pilots were
flying below their assigned altitude when the near-miss incidents
occurred. NTSB said the T-38s lack the means to alert pilots when
they are out of their assigned altitude and that the pilots do not
write down their instructions as others do.
   The changes are needed, NTSB said in a letter to Truly, ``to
reduce the potential for human error.''
   Truly called the NTSB report ``thorough and constructive'' and
said NASA would consider all of the recommendations.
   There were two other incidents in 1989 and two in 1986, the NTSB
said without giving any detail.
