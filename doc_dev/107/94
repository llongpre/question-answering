   The co-pilot thought to have been at the
controls of a commuter plane that crashed Feb. 19, killing 12
people, had been ``all over the sky'' in training flights, a
veteran pilot has told federal investigators.
   Kathy Digan ``didn't have a feel for the airplane,'' Robert
Haller said in a March interview with the National Transportation
Safety Board. ``Her landings were interesting to say the least.
Twice she almost put us in the weeds.''
   According to documents released Wednesday by the NTSB, Digan was
believed to be flying the twin-engine plane because pilot Walter
Cole acknowledged an air traffic controller's clearance to take off
on the night of the crash that killed everyone aboard.
   The pilot using the radio customarily would not be at the
controls, the safety board said.
   Moments after takeoff in heavy fog from Raleigh-Durham
International Airport, the Richmond, Va.-bound American Eagle Metro
III plane crashed into the shore of a reservoir, 3,000 feet from
the airport's 10,000-foot runway.
   A. Barry Strauch, the NTSB's chief investigator, said Ms.
Digan's problems did not necessarily mean she caused the crash. In
a telephone interview from Washington, Strauch told The News and
Observer of Raleigh the agency hadn't determined the cause.
   The NTSB has said Ms. Digan had spotty training records but was
qualified to fly the plane on the night of the crash.
   Although no mechanical failure has been found in the plane's
engines or propellers, Strauch said other mechanical components are
still being tested.
   In two documents, Haller, an American Eagle pilot, described
problems he noticed in training flights with Ms. Digan in September
1987. ``She didn't know where she was in relation to the airport,''
he said. ``She was all over the sky.''
   In a Sept. 15 evaluation report, Haller noted Ms. Digan's
deficiencies in flying a Metro III: ``She is way behind the
airplane, has not developed a feel for the airplane, is having a
hard time handling the speed, has a tendency to over control and
she has real (underlined) problems landing.
   ``Made two decent landings in full-month,'' Haller wrote. ``Her
flying was not improving during the month. She continued to make
the same mistakes.''
   Haller discussed Ms. Digan's problems with other airline
officials, the documents said. One told him that Ms. Digan's mother
was seriously ill and that her ability would improve once she got
over family problems.
   Haller, who now works for Eastern Airlines, stated in March that
the last comments he heard regarding Ms. Digan indicated she was
improving.
   In September, Haller and Billie Minix, an American Eagle
employee designated by the Federal Aviation Administration to check
pilot qualifications, agreed Ms. Digan was not qualified to fly the
Metro III.
   Earlier, in July, Minix had recommended firing Ms. Digan after
she failed two landing tests while trying to qualify on a Metro II,
a predecessor of the Metro III with slightly shorter wings and less
powerful engines.
   Documents released Wednesday also include sworn statements from
a top FAA official that Ms. Digan was not qualified to make a
takeoff on the night of the crash.
   The documents also include statements from AVAir, which operated
American Eagle, and FAA officials saying the pilots met
requirements. AVAir's lawyer, William F. Womble Jr., also said the
pilots met training requirements.
