   In 1986, then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger offered no
hint of the design delays and escalating costs when he testified
before Congress that the program ``is on schedule; the technology is
well-understood and working, and we expect the system to be
operational in the early 1990s.''
   Weinberger was also far off the mark when he offered Congress the
first public figures about the plane's cost. The B-2, he said, would
cost $277 million for each plane, and the entire program would tally
about $36.6 billion. Just two years later, the Pentagon went back to
Congress, weeks before the B-2's first test flight, with figures
roughly doubling Weinberger's: $530 million per plane, total program
cost of more than $70 billion.
   With those numbers now out in the open, some in Congress are
questioning whether the United States can afford the plane that Gen.
Bernard P. Randolph, head of the Air Force Systems Command, calls
nothing less than ``a quantum leap into the 21st century.''
   For all the secrecy surrounding the B-2's high-tech features,
there is no dark secret about either the stealth concept itself or
the flying-wing design. Each is nearly as old as powered flight.
   Simply put, the stealthiness of an airplane, or any other weapons
system, is measured by its ability to thwart an enemy's capacity to
detect it, by whatever means. It is a matter of degree _ there is no
such thing as total stealth; pure invisibility remains the exclusive
domain of science fiction.
   Hauptmann Petrocz von Petroczy probably qualified as the inventor
of the stealth airplane when, at a time when the unaided human eye
was the principal aerial tracking device, he removed the fabric
covering of an Etrich Taube monoplane and replaced it with
transparent celluloid. The engine and skeleton still showed, but
residents of the Austrian countryside had to strain to make out the
wraith-like source of the noise generated by Petroczy's test flights.
   That was in 1912, two years before an Englishman, John W. Dunne,
took to the skies in an airplane with no tail, no fuselage _ the
first flying wing. Aircraft designers, from Hugo Junkers to John W.
Northrop, have been entranced by its possibilities, despite repeated
setbacks, ever since.
