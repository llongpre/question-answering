<P>
For centuries, people have fancied flight. 
</P>
<P>
But not until 1960 -- after the Wright Brothers took off, airplane travel 
mounted and orbiting the planet became a reality -- did man achieve a flight 
this fancy. 
</P>
<P>
That was when three men from Sydney, Australia, devised a way for humans to 
soar like birds, to attain what Greek mythology described in "The Flight of 
Icarus." The men, Bill Bennett, John Dickenson and Bill Moyes, invented the 
hang glider. 
</P>
<P>
"It's as close to being a bird as a human can get," said Joe Bill Henry, 
manager of the Torrey Flight Park. "You don't have an engine. You have a wing 
and no noise, just you and the birds." 
</P>
<P>
The inventors had been towing flat kites on water skis until they read an 
article in Popular Science magazine about a wing designed by Francis Rogallo. 
The wing, attached to a parachute, was designed for NASA for space re-entry and 
made of flexible material covered over three tubes spread in a fan shape. 
</P>
<P>
The men found that by using the Rogallo wing they had stability and 
maneuverability they didn't have with the kite. They continued to tow the 
glider behind a boat. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Rogallo) designed a parachute meant to come down," said Bennett, who now 
lives in Los Angeles. "We designed the glider to go up. It's like, the man who 
invented the wheel didn't invent the car, but without the wheel you couldn't 
have the car. It's the same concept. There were a lot of trials and a lot of 
errors." 
</P>
<P>
Bennett brought the sport to the United States in 1969 by giving an exhibition 
at the National Water Skiing Championships at Berkeley. From there, Bennett 
received offers to tour and give exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone was so amazed by it," Bennett said. "So many people wanted to do it." 
</P>
<P>
At the inaugural race at the Ontario Motor Speedway, Bennett, giving a pre-race 
exhibition, was being towed behind a car. When the rope suddenly broke, Bennett 
was forced to maneuver and land the glider for the first time without being 
attached. The crowd, assuming it was part of the act, gave rousing applause. 
</P>
<P>
From then, Bennett began to perfect launching and landing without the aid of a 
tow. One of his first test sites was at Torrey Pines Gliderport in La Jolla, 
now the location of one of his businesses, the Torrey Flight Park. Bennett has 
been manufacturing gliders since 1970 for Delta Wing Kites and Gliders, Inc., 
of which he is part owner. Moyes has remained his business partner and has a 
business of the same name in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
"Hang gliding is on the move with the aid of computers, and California is 
becoming the aerospace capital of the world," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
The first design cost about $325, Bennett said, but now some hang gliders cost 
just under $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
First-timers to hang gliding often take tandem lessons. After a ground lesson, 
the student goes up with the instructor for one ride. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the best tool for learning," said Dave Beardslee, tandem instructor at 
the Torrey Flight Park. "It's like riding in a car before actually learning to 
drive it. You get the feel of it first." 
</P>
<P>
Beardslee, who has been an instructor for 16 years and has taken more than 
2,500 people hang gliding, said that many tandem students are tourists who just 
want to try hang gliding once. Others, however, return for a lesson to fly 
solo. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said he has had students from ages 6 to 85. The only weight requirement 
is an upper limit of 300 pounds. When learning to fly, solo students first have 
a ground lesson and are put on a simulator to get the feel of the glider. Then 
they are taken to a training hill where they progress from flat to 30 feet to 
100 feet up the hill. 
</P>
<P>
"You use certain muscles in the body like riding a bicycle, running long 
distances or swimming," Henry said. "You use the same type of physical strength 
you'd use in those sports. But the glider isn't hard to maneuver." 
</P>
<P>
To fly in San Diego at any national park without an instructor present, an 
advanced license is required. Licenses are earned through flight and 
instruction and are numbered: 1 for beginner, 2 for novice, 3 for intermediate 
and 4 for the advanced pilot. Each year, the license must be renewed. 
</P>
<P>
Henry said students learn at their own pace; it usually takes about three or 
four lessons to earn a beginner's license and about 12 to earn a novice 
license. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the licensing and new features on the gliders, the sport has become 
much safer than when it first began. Pilots wear a parachute that could carry 
both himself and the glider safely to the ground in case of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
Henry began hang gliding because he said he needed to try something different. 
He had parachuted in the Army, raced cars and motorcyles and tried scuba 
diving. He and a friend built a glider in a garage and taught themselves to fly 
it. From there, Henry earned his license and, later, his instructor's license. 
Now, in addition to teaching, Henry is a test pilot for Delta Wing Kites and 
Gliders, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
All gliders must be certified before they are sold. As a test pilot, Henry 
takes a new glider through quality-control tests. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, a lot of people got hurt because there were no licenses or 
regulations," Henry said. "Now it's one of the safest sports."

An appropriately named devotee of hang gliding, Falcon Eagle, prepares for 
takeoff at Torrey Flight Park (above), then seems to ascend toward the sun 
(left). Starting hang gliders can earn a beginner's license after three or four 
lessons and a novice's license after about a dozen lessons. The licensing of 
participants and regulations on glider construction have improved safety in the 
sport. BRUCE K. HUFF / Los Angeles Times
