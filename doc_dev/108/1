Holtville senior Teresa Ibarra just wanted one more basketball championship 
patch to sew on her letterman jacket. 
</P>
<P>
"I needed a third patch to fill up my sleeve," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She got it Friday when Holtville defeated Coronado, 57-31, in the San Diego 
Section Division IV girls' basketball final at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Holtville went into the game as two-time Division IV defending champion, having 
defeated Coronado by 24 and 13 points in previous finals. But Friday's game was 
expected to be closer. In the second game of the season, Holtville (18-9) 
defeated Coronado (14-11) by just five after Coronado had built a 10-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be a two- or three-point ball game either way," Holtville 
Coach Mike Pacheco said. "It was great to have a game like this. It makes my 
job easier." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado trailed by 18, 41-23, at the end of the third quarter and did not 
score again until three minutes remained. The Islanders were outscored, 16-8, 
in the fourth quarter. Their leading scorer, Kris Skaalan, managed just eight 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Coronado Coach Ernie Dickerson) has seen our press," Pacheco said. "We 
pressed them the last time, and that's how we won. They didn't look as ready or 
prepared for the press as I thought they would be. Maybe he was prepared, and 
it just didn't work. We tried to throw them with a two-three zone and never 
went to a man-to-man." 
</P>
<P>
Holtville took a 12-6 first-quarter lead and then broke the game open, making 
it 31-11 by halftime. Senior Denise Gaddis scored nine of her 11 points in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
Ibarra, a 5-1 guard, worked hard for her patch. She scored 21 points, including 
two three-pointers in the second quarter and two more, on consecutive shots, in 
the fourth. Ibarra said she doesn't concentrate on shooting from that range. 
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I have an open shot I shoot," she said. "He (Pacheco) always tells me 
I never shoot enough and to shoot more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Pacheco: "Teresa delivered like a senior should. It didn't surprise me 
that she led the team today. Too bad she's not 6-1."
