CITY URGED TO USE CORONADO BRIDGE TOLLS FOR BARRIO LOGAN PROJECTS

San Diego city officials were asked Friday to examine ways to use tolls from 
the Coronado Bridge to improve Barrio Logan, the historic Chicano neighborhood 
that was devastated by bridge and highway construction two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the California Transportation Commission decided to retain the $1 
round-trip toll until at least mid-1995, but authorities earmarked the 
estimated $25 million in tolls until mid-1995 for bridge upkeep and for traffic 
projects along bridge approaches in Coronado. The tolls have already paid for 
bridge construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
By statute, the toll funds -- which are state, not city revenues -- can now 
only be used for maintenance, rehabilitation and traffic improvements on the 
bridge and its approaches, said Mariana Mejia, a spokeswoman in Sacramento with 
the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
Whether that requirement can be met and the funds directed toward 
bridge-related projects in Barrio Logan remains an open question. "They (San 
Diego officials) will have to work around it creatively," said Mejia, the 
Caltrans spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Councilman Bob Filner formally requested that City Manager John 
Lockwood investigate the use of tolls for a variety of Barrio Logan projects, 
including traffic improvements on city streets leading to the bridge and the 
upkeep and expansion of Chicano Park. The park, which is situated in the shadow 
of the bridge's eastern terminus, features widely acclaimed murals depicting 
Chicano, indigenous American and other themes emblazoned on the bridge's 
concrete support pillars. 
</P>
<P>
"Both the construction of the bridge and the ongoing operations have had a 
really negative impact on the community of Barrio Logan, and there ought to be 
some recognition of that impact," said Filner, whose district includes the 
barrio, a low-income area. 
</P>
<P>
In Barrio Logan, where the bridge remains a sore point and where bridge traffic 
contributes to traffic bottlenecks, a still-nascent movement has emerged 
seeking to redirect some of the toll funds to community needs, particularly the 
care of Chicano Park and its much-lauded murals. Some of the murals are 
deteriorating and badly in need of care, activists say. There have also been 
few additions in recent years, although the mural project is considered ongoing 
and open to expansion. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should get our fair share," said Salvador Roberto Torres, a 
neighborhood resident, artist and assistant professor at San Diego State 
University who has long been active in promoting the park murals. 
"Traditionally, we have been the stepchild in this whole drama of events that 
has unfolded and impacted our community." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge opened in August, 1969. Its erection, along with the somewhat 
earlier construction of the Interstate 5 freeway, displaced thousands of 
residents of Barrio Logan, one of California's oldest Chicano communities. 
Neighborhood outrage over the displacements and a perceived city neglect of the 
area sparked a series of events and confrontations that led directly to the 
founding of Chicano Park and the painting of the murals. 
</P>
<P>
In Coronado, Mayor Mary Herron said Friday that she expects no objection from 
her constituents if bridge toll revenues are redirected to improvements in 
Barrio Logan. However, she noted that the city could face difficulty in 
complying with the state guidelines restricting the use of toll money. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there would be a pretty stiff legal battle," Mayor Herron said.
