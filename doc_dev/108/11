Whittier Christian High School, after winning the Southern Section 2-AA 
basketball championship Saturday, enters the Southern California Regionals 
today as the third-seeded team in Division IV. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian (22-6) will play San Diego Coronado (11-14) at La Habra High 
School in a first-round game tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Whittier Christian, led by 6-foot-7 center Scott Ferguson (19 points and 11 
rebounds a game) and 6-4 forward Paul McKinley (21 points, 9 rebounds), may not 
have too great a challenge in Coronado, the only team in the division playoffs 
with a losing record. Derek Wastila, a 6-5 junior center, leads Coronado with 
14 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
Wastila is supported by 5-6 guard Tim DeWitt, 6-3 forward Jesse MacNeill and 
6-2 guard Tom Mitchell, who was the San Diego Section player of the year in 
water polo last fall. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're facing these unknown teams, you are always a little hesitant in 
what to say to the kids," Whittier Christian Coach Bob Brown said. "But I feel 
good. I feel we got a real good seeding for the first round." 
</P>
<P>
In other Division IV play: 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran (23-4) vs. El Cajon Christian (14-11) at Granite Hills High: 
Orange Lutheran, which defeated Whittier Christian twice en route to the 
Olympic League title this season, qualified for the regionals as an at-large 
entry after losing, 78-54, to 2-A champion Santa Clara Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Orange Lutheran, coming off its worse performance of the season Saturday when 
it shot just 32% from the field after averaging 55% all season, will meet a 
good shooting team. 
</P>
<P>
 El Cajon Christian, which defeated Coronado, 70-60, Saturday for the section 
Division IV title, is especially capable at the free throw line. Saturday it 
converted 21 of 22 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Its top player, 6-1 guard David Jeremiah, is a three-year starter who averages 
21.6 points. In one game this season, he made 10 three-point shots. 
</P>
<P>
Darrell White, a 6-5 senior forward, averages 20 points for Coronado. Other 
starters are 6-3 forward Tim Barkett, 6-foot junior guard Brad Fox and 6-10, 
215-pound center Dan Tate. 
</P>
<P>
Tate, though intimidating in size, rarely scores in double figures. He scored 
just two points in Saturday's victory.
