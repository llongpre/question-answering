KEITH EDGES WALKER TO WIN CORONADO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Susan Keith, chairwoman of the Coronado Planning Commission, appeared to have 
won a narrow victory Tuesday night over three other candidates in a race for a 
vacant Coronado City Council seat, according to unofficial results released by 
the San Diego County registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
With 100% of the votes counted, Keith led Greg Walker, a jewelry store owner, 
by 29 votes, or 2,217 to 2,188. However, an official at the registrar's office 
said 27 absentee and 14 provisional ballots remained to be counted. A 
provisional ballot is one that needs to be validated by making sure that a 
voter is properly registered. 
</P>
<P>
Two other candidates, Donald Zub, a former Navy SEAL and construction worker, 
and Louis de Beer, an engineer and computer consultant, trailed badly with 172 
and 153 votes, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
Keith is expected to fill the seat left vacant when Councilwoman Mary Herron 
was elected mayor in November. Herron defeated incumbent R.H. Dorman. Keith 
will serve for the remaining two years of Herron's council term. 
</P>
<P>
The registrar's spokesman said 42.8% of Coronado's 11,190 registered voters 
turned out in the special election.
