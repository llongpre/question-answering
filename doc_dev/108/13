Hey, all you water polo and tennis players, listen up. The Coronado boys' 
basketball team won the Division IV San Diego Section championship Friday with 
a 63-53 victory over Imperial at Golden Hall. 
</P>
<P>
Nyah-nyah nyah nyah-nyah nyah. 
</P>
<P>
"We're stereotyped as a tennis and water polo school," said 6-foot-3 center 
Derek Wastila, who scored 19 points. "Little do they know we have some talent 
out here." 
</P>
<P>
Enough, in fact, to win the school's first section basketball championship. 
This team also won Coronado's first league championship since 1963, finishing 
atop the newly formed City Harbor League. 
</P>
<P>
"All they hear is tennis and water polo," Coronado Coach Bob Stanton said. "But 
we've beaten some pretty good teams this year. This wasn't a fluke." 
</P>
<P>
Still, people have been telling guard Paul Carter for years that he should 
transfer to a real basketball school. He didn't listen. 
</P>
<P>
"I stuck it out for four years," he said. "And I'm pretty satisfied with my 
career here." 
</P>
<P>
Carter ended it with an exclamation point, scoring nine points and assisting 
his teammates on a rather amazing accomplishment in the third quarter, when 
Coronado (19-8) outscored Imperial 18-2. Imperial, which used a balanced 
offense to build a 33-29 halftime lead, managed only a pair of free throws in 
the third quarter. Forward Brian Williams' half-court prayer at the conclusion 
of the period, which bounced around the rim and out, was the closest thing 
Imperial had to a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I think their size and strength wore us down a little," Imperial Coach Kerry 
Legarra said. "We just quit moving and maybe that was because of fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
If Imperial (16-8) was tired, it wasn't extinct. Trailing, 47-35, at the end of 
the third quarter, the Tigers trimmed Coronado's lead to eight with less than 
three minutes remaining. Then, when Imperial forward Erik Mellas drove for a 
layup, Wastila swatted Mellas' shot halfway to Orange County, and Carter wound 
up with a layup on the other end. 
</P>
<P>
"I do tend to feast on the smaller teams," Wastila said. 
</P>
<P>
A basket and three free throws down the stretch by forward Adam Smith, who 
scored 19 points to share game-high honors with Wastila, helped preserve the 
victory, Coronado's second over Imperial this season. 
</P>
<P>
One key to this victory was Stanton's decision to change the defense in the 
third quarter from a box-and-one, designed to shut down forward/center Brian 
Williams, to a two-three zone. Williams managed just nine points, and the 
defensive switch threw Imperial's offense out of kilter. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of their shots came easy," Legarra said. "And a lot of ours came very, 
very hard." 
</P>
<P>
But Legarra wasn't completely dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"How many teams," he asked, "score two points in one quarter and are still in 
the ball game?"
