CORONADO'S BID TO BAR TOUR BUSES GETS STRANDED ON THE BEACH

If diesel smoke was all that tour buses spewed, Coronado residents might 
consider backing down. It's the annoying patter that they say they're sick to 
death of -- the running commentary, blared over the buses' public address 
systems, lecturing paying passengers about one of San Diego County's most 
exclusive communities. 
</P>
<P>
"They slow down and they say, 'Now look. This is where all the rich folks live. 
Well, now this is where the Duchess of Windsor lived. Now you see in the 
driveway the Jaguars or the Mercedeses or the BMWs,' " said Doris Pray, a 
grandmother whose 27 years in Coronado have made her an expert on tour bus 
prattle. 
</P>
<P>
Such gawking is harassment, Pray and other Coronadans say. And these days -- at 
least since September, when the Coronado City Council passed an ordinance to 
bar tour buses from most streets except state highways -- it is against the 
law. At least, technically. 
</P>
<P>
Other cities, like Beverly Hills, for example, have laws limiting tour bus 
routes. But Coronado's attempt has a peculiar wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
The state Coastal Commission is concerned that in limiting tour bus routes the 
city also has inadvertently limited coastal access in violation of the state 
Coastal Act. Until a ruling is obtained on that question, the Coastal 
Commission has stopped Coronado from enforcing its law. 
</P>
<P>
But Coastal Commissioner David Malcolm says he already has made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a basically white community saying, Stay out!" said Malcolm, who has 
earned the enmity of some Coronadans by opposing several proposals he finds 
"exclusionary." Malcolm, who is also a councilman in the largely Latino city of 
Chula Vista, says the Coronado sensibility goes something like this: "God 
forbid someone from out of town and from a minority race would come into our 
city." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado's civic leaders deny that racism has tainted their policy-making. But 
they admit that ever since the tiny 6-square-mile island city seceded from San 
Diego in 1891, it has struggled to keep its distance from its larger mainland 
neighbor. Especially since 1969, when the elegant 2.23-mile San Diego-Coronado 
Bay Bridge linked the two cities for the first time, residents have chafed at 
the resulting surge in traffic -- and, some say, crime -- on their orderly, 
tree-lined streets. 
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Malcolm says, city leaders seem to be working harder than 
ever to keep out-of-towners at bay. 
</P>
<P>
This fall, when the California Transportation Commission considered scrapping 
the $1 toll on the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge, Coronado Mayor Mary Herron 
successfully lobbied to extend the toll until 1995. While it had more than met 
its original goal -- paying back nearly $48 million in construction bonds -- 
the toll had other merits, Herron argued. By discouraging sightseers, she said, 
it kept Coronado's traffic in check. 
</P>
<P>
Then the city came up with a plan to create residents-only decal parking zones 
on a section of shoreline near the North Island Naval Air Station. The city 
said it needed the zones because Navy employees' vehicles often block residents 
from parking near their homes. But Malcolm and Coastal Commission Chairman 
Thomas W. Gwyn cried foul and are appealing the ordinance on the basis that it 
limits beach access. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the tour bus ordinance, which would keep most commercial buses from 
traveling the city's most scenic coastal routes. In addition, the ordinance 
would force buses that drop passengers at the area's biggest tourist 
attraction, the historic Hotel del Coronado, to travel five extra miles down 
the Silver Strand peninsula simply to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado is not the first California city to try to regulate tour bus traffic. 
In 1976, sick of being overrun by star-gazers, Beverly Hills banned commercial 
sightseeing vehicles weighing three tons or more from traveling on most 
residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance, which withstood challenges in the state Supreme Court, sought to 
eliminate what it called "all nature of nuisances . . . such as trespassing, 
knocking on doors, littering, trampling on shrubbery and flower beds, using the 
shrubbery for toilet purposes, making loud and raucous noises, removing items 
as souvenirs and generally disturbing the peace and privacy of the residents, 
most of whom are not celebrities." 
</P>
<P>
When Malcolm heard that Coronado was going to follow suit, he says he could 
only wonder what would come next. "A wall around the city? A drawbridge?" 
</P>
<P>
"What gives Coronado the right to say people can't go up and down the 
waterfront?" he asked, rejecting as absurd the charge, leveled by some 
Coronadans, that he is a shill for the tour bus industry. 
</P>
<P>
Pray, who has made the anti-bus fight a personal crusade, says it is a matter 
of human decency. Given the buses' long history of wrongdoing, she said, 
something has to change. 
</P>
<P>
At a public hearing last week, tour bus operators said the ordinance will 
create an economic hardship, adding 15 minutes to their routes and forcing 
passengers to endure repetitive views. But when Coronado's mayor suggested to 
her constituents that they increase their chances of winning Coastal Commission 
approval by considering alternatives to the ordinance, 11 residents rose, one 
by one, to say no. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the buses continue to roll unrestricted through town, gushing 
well-rehearsed flackery as they go. Among the highlights: a church with Tiffany 
windows, the house where Wallace Simpson lived before she married the duke, and 
the spot where Marilyn Monroe, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis filmed "Some Like It 
Hot" at the grand Hotel Del. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the inspiration for the Emerald City in the Wizard of Oz," said Old 
Town Trolley tour bus driver Midge Crockett as she turned off the highway, 
hurtled down a quiet residential street and parked at a shorefront bus stop 
that the ordinance would abolish. 
</P>
<P>
"And this," she said, "is the most beautiful beach in California."
