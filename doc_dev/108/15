John Edward Wade, 47, of Del Mar was arrested Monday in the Northern California 
town of Leggett, the San Diego County Integrated Narcotic Task Force announced. 
He is the third former "Coronado Company" member to be arrested in the task 
force investigations since Friday.

Wade was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to import marijuana. He was 
described by authorities as an "alleged partner and financier" in a plan to 
smuggle 10 tons of marijuana into the country by boat. Agents seized about 
$55,000 when Wade was taken into custody.

Among the nine other people arrested in connection with the smuggling plot was 
Edward R. Otero, 34, of Del Mar, another member of the "Coronado Company," a 
drug-trafficking ring that so named because it had its start among classmates 
at Coronado High School in the early 1970s.

Otero was taken into custody Monday in Rockport, along the Northern California 
coast. Authorities said Otero was the leader of a group that had gone to 
Rockport to rendezvous with a boat off the coast.

A third Coronado Company member, Robert Kent Lahodny, 39, of San Diego, was
