The Coronado water polo team wasn't quite sure if its coach, Randy Burgess, 
would make it in time to see the Islanders play Poway for the 3-A Section title 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, it didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado (28-4) claimed its fourth consecutive Section title by defeating 
Poway, 14-9, at the Jewish Community Center. And Burgess, who did arrive 30 
minutes before the game, praised his team's play even though the Islanders had 
to play catchup a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
"They played us tough, but I felt our kids weren't really focused on the game," 
Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
After a 3-3 first-quarter tie, Poway forced Coronado to play catchup in the 
second quarter. At halftime, the score was again tied, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, Poway (23-1) took an 8-6 lead. But with three minutes 
remaining in the quarter, Coronado went on a scoring spree and led, 10-8, 
entering the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
"After it was 8-6 I thought we were in control of the game," Poway Coach Greg 
Ormsby said. "They just went on a rampage. They're a very balanced field and 
(they have) the best qoalie in the county (Jack Bowen)." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Valhalla defeated USDHS, 17-10, to win the 2-A 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-A game, USDHS tried, but couldn't stop Mike Nalu, who scored nine 
goals for Valhalla. Eric Nielsen added four for the Norsemen. USDHS was led by 
Doug Munz, who scored six goals. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to try to have two people on Mike when he gets the ball," USDHS 
Coach Dan Crane said. "He's so quick that he turns and make things happen."
