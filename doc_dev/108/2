When Holtville and Coronado meet at noon for the girls' Division IV 
championship, they will be much different teams than those that met in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
In the second game of the season in the Coronado Tournament, Coronado (14-10) 
held as much as a 10-point lead before losing by five. 
</P>
<P>
"I start three different kids than I did then, and he starts two," Coronado 
Coach Ernie Dickerson said. "Looking back on that game, it doesn't mean a whole 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
The teams played for the Division IV championship in each of the past two 
years, with Holtville (17-9) winning both. 
</P>
<P>
Holtville Coach Mike Pacheco said the change to Golden Hall from the Sports 
Arena -- where his team has played in section finals the past four years -- 
could be a "key factor" for Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
"His kids are so young that if we were playing in the Sports Arena, it could 
make a difference," Pacheco said. "Nobody's been at Golden Hall, so there's no 
home-court advantage." 
</P>
<P>
The two only varsity returners for Coronado are Mary Strasser and Kelly Kaye. 
Strasser, a left-handed shooter who started as a freshman last year, has a 
15.5-point average but has averaged 18 the past six games. 
</P>
<P>
Holtville is led by Teresa Ibarra, a 5-1 senior point guard who is averaging 12 
points a game. LAURA PALMER
