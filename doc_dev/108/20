The San Diego High School baseball team wasn't fazed when a line drive double 
play in the first inning wasted a leadoff triple. The Cavers, who trailed by a 
run, went on to score 10 runs in the inning and routed visiting Coronado, 16-3, 
Monday in pool play of the Grossmont Metro City tournament.

<P>
San Diego (3-1) used six hits, four walks and three Coronado errors to send 14 
players to the plate in the first. San Diego scored in each of the first five 
innings. The game was called after the fifth because of darkness. Coronado is 
2-2.

Kian Sly had a two-run homer in the fourth and finished three for three with a 
triple and four RBIs. Josh Stepner went the distance for the victory, allowing
