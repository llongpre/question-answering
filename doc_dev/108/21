The police chief of Coronado Island, Jerry Boyd, has no doubt that there are 
dangerous forces at work on his orderly, tree-lined streets across the bay from 
San Diego. They are the Coronado White Boys, the island's first gang, he says, 
and their message is "Crips, get out of town." 
</P>
<P>
Coronado parents aren't so sure. Yes, some have begun hearing about a new club, 
the CWBs. And yes, it's been hard to ignore the new teen-age fashion trend: 
white baseball caps worn askew. But, don't kids always dress funny? 
</P>
<P>
Self-proclaimed CWBs, a bunch of skateboard-riding adolescents with a penchant 
for video games, say they are the victims of gang hysteria. They have no 
intention, they say, of doing harm to anyone, especially street gangs. They say 
they're being harassed by the law, and recently they have won support from the 
island newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
"Police Chief Jerry Boyd has taken what may have been a student's private joke 
and made it into something terrifying," an editorial proclaimed two weeks ago 
in the Coronado Journal. "Minors need to be protected from themselves and 
outside influences. Let us hope they do not need to be protected from the 
police." 
</P>
<P>
Local residents, many of whom settled on the six square miles of manicured 
lawns to escape big-city problems, say the furor surrounding the White Boys is 
just not Coronado's style. The exclusive community enjoys the lowest crime rate 
in San Diego County. Its phone book is littered with retired admirals and 
colonels, and more of its high school students try out for water polo than for 
football. When school lets out on a sunny day, the fresh faces of local 
teen-agers look capable of nothing more ominous than under-tipping. 
</P>
<P>
But Boyd says that, although most CWBs are law-abiding boys and girls looking 
for the social prestige of an in crowd, about eight members are out to protect 
their beach from outsiders -- and to use force if necessary. Lately, Boyd, a 
tough-talking veteran of the Los Angeles police force, has been warning parents 
that inner-city gangs may retaliate if they feel threatened by the CWBs. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll go looking for the ones who did them. If they can't find them, they'll 
go after anyone in a white baseball cap. Or worse yet, at noon, at lunchtime, 
when there's 150 kids out in the park, they'll open fire," Boyd told 45 parents 
at a meeting last week. "People say that's sensationalism, but it happens 2 1/2 
miles from here every night of the week. It's just a matter of geography." 
</P>
<P>
CWB members who agreed to talk last week said Boyd is grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just a group of friends, not a gang," said Jamie Johnson, an articulate 
17-year-old who helped found the CWBs. "The first we heard of trying to reclaim 
the beach was what we read in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Instead of a negative influence, he said, the group has helped some of its 
members get off drugs. The CWB name, he said, was a joke, coined as an 
alternative to what other students called them: Grits, or cigarette smokers. 
</P>
<P>
"White is a neutral color, and we were trying to be neutral," said Aaron 
Renshaw, a 15-year-old sophomore with a skateboard under his arm, who said the 
name was never intended to provoke minority gangs. "We have black kids and 
Mexicans in the group, too." 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began about a month ago, when Boyd says he first heard from his 
officers that the CWBs were mixing with the 16 out-of-town gangs -- "bona fide, 
righteous gangs" -- that frequent the sparkling waters of North Beach. Then, a 
few Saturdays ago, Boyd said, there was a "push-and-shove confrontation" 
between the CWBs and the Crips, a black street gang -- a confrontation CWBs 
deny. On several nights afterward, Boyd claims, police identified cars of Crips 
cruising the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd ask, 'Hey, there's no party tonight. Why are you over here?' They said, 
'We're here looking for the white boys,' " Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
So Boyd wrote a letter to the Coronado Journal cautioning residents to keep an 
eye out for gang activity. The Coronado School District responded with both 
barrels: a gang expert was brought in to address a joint faculty meeting of the 
middle and high schools; parents of "known" CWBs received phone calls from 
school administrators; the superintendent of schools sent a letter to parents 
warning that Coronado gang activity was in the "formative" stage. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the weekly newspaper's edition two weeks ago, which suggested that 
Boyd was blowing things out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the editor, Suzanne K. Larsen, Aaron Renshaw's mother, urged her 
neighbors to "dispel the myth" surrounding the CWBs. Writing on behalf of 12 
CWBs, she made what many CWBs say is their first actual challenge: They invited 
the Coronado Police Department to a friendly game of flag football. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd says that about 15 of his officers have agreed to play in early November. 
Around the same time, however, Boyd is scheduling a gang symposium for parents 
and students. In addition to photos of Crips, Bloods, B-Down Boys and other 
gangs, Boyd plans to exhibit a collection of weapons confiscated in Coronado 
and to invite a special guest -- "a real gang member." 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to open some eyes. We'll have weapons on display. And I promise 
you, we didn't go across the bridge, seize them and bring them back over here," 
Boyd said. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd says there are 50 CWBs, while the teen-agers put the number at less than 
20. 
</P>
<P>
Judging by attendance at last Tuesday parents' meeting, the public debate has 
only made some parents more curious -- and frightened. 
</P>
<P>
"If I have spray paint on my garage in a symbol, should I be worried?" one 
woman asked Boyd after hearing about the placas, or graffiti symbols, that 
gangs often leave behind. 
</P>
<P>
A concerned father wondered if it would help to publish identifying information 
about the CWBs in community watch newsletters. "Like when you go to Florida, 
(there are signs) that say, 'This is an alligator. Don't pet it.' " 
</P>
<P>
And another parent asked if the free car-pool lane on the San Diego-Coronado 
Bay Toll Bridge is to blame for increased gang activity. "I'd go back to paying 
if it means keeping people like that out of here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CWBs have responded to the outcry by taking off their white 
hats, and they are considering dropping their name. 
</P>
<P>
"If we break the mold, it's because they're trying to mold us into trendy 
little people who wear slacks and play tennis," said Brian Wentz, 16. "But we 
aren't naive. We know gangs have guns."
