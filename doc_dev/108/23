<LEADPARA>  When a member of a rival prison gang slipped up behind Gabriel Coronado two
years ago in the Santa Clara County Jail and slit his throat, the stoic gang
leader survived but refused to talk to prosecutors. No one was charged in the
attack.;    But after virtually the same thing happened on May 23, at the
hands of a different assailant, Coronado decided he'd had enough and told his
story to a grand jury.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Last week, the courts unsealed an indictment charging attempted murder and
related weapons violations against Leonel Jose Cano, 30, the reputed prison
gang member accused of attacking Coronado with a homemade weapon fashioned
from a toothbrush and the blades of jail-issued razors.;    "With this
indictment, the D.A.'s office wants to send a message to gang members that if
they commit a crime in Santa Clara County, it will be taken seriously. It will
be prosecuted," said Assistant District Attorney Jim Shore, who is handling
the case.;    Both Cano, who is reputed to be a member of the prison gang
Nuestra Familia, and Coronado -- an admitted leader of the Fresno-based prison
gang F-14 -- are in protective custody in the main county jail and could not
be reached for comment.;    But episodes such as the hit on Coronado were
predicted last October in a controversial memo from a California parole
officer to officials of the Santa Clara County Department of Correction. The
memo warned that members of state prison gangs being held in the local jail
were recruiting county inmates, who are being taught to make weapons and run
errands for gang members.;    Capt. Roy Froom, who wrote the memo after
consulting with state parole gang officer E.J. Allen, said the situation in
Santa Clara County was not an emergency but would "certainly become violent"
if gang activity was not controlled.;    Froom blamed the problem on a county
policy that allows minimum-security state prisoners to be kept at the local
jail in exchange for money. County jail officials have said repeatedly there
is no serious problem with prison gangs in the jails.;    Coronado, 30, was
first attacked in the Santa Clara County Jail in February 1989.;    He now
says a soldier of the rival gang, Nuestra Familia, carried out the assault.;  
 The two gangs have clashed since Coronado and several others broke from
Nuestra Familia in the 1970s and formed F-14, Shore said.;    He said the most
recent attack occurred about 7:30 p.m. May 23, soon after Coronado received
word that he would be moved to a different part of the jail to join a drug
abuse program he had hoped to enter.;    Shore said Coronado indicated to
Cano, who had befriended him in the jail, that he might be moved soon. Minutes
later, after talking to his wife on the telephone, Coronado walked to the
lower tier of his jail dorm.;    When Coronado reached the bottom step, Shore
said, Cano allegedly grabbed him around the mouth and chin. The F-14 leader
felt a long slash across the right side of his neck. Cano then allegedly
walked casually to the telephone and placed a call, the prosecutor said.;   
The makeshift weapon was later recovered from the scene.;    Coronado
initially told correction officers he injured himself falling against a hinge
of his cell door.;    But somewhere between Valley Medical Center, where
doctors closed his wound with 14 stitches, and his return to the jail later
that night, Gabriel Coronado decided he'd had enough. He told the authorities
he had something he wanted to say.;    Last week, Leonel Cano discovered what
it was.  </TEXT>
