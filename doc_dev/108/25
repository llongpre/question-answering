Coronado High water polo coach Randy Burgess said he'd been waiting for his 
junior goalie, Jack Bowen, to have a game of the spectacular variety for two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
Burgess' wait ended Saturday night as Bowen put on a rejection show Mark Eaton 
would have proud of in Coronado's 13-8 victory over Poway in the San Diego 
Section title game at the Jewish Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
Bowen personally turned back any hopes Poway had of dethroning the two-time 
champs by holding the Titans scoreless with four fourth-quarter saves. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just an incredible player," said Bowen's teammate Pat Mitchell, who 
scored three third-period goals. "What you saw in the second half was the Jack 
Bowen show." 
</P>
<P>
The show's highlight came with three minutes remaining in the game and Coronado 
ahead, 12-8. With Bowen one-one with Poway junior Chad Aronen at point-blank 
range, Bowen leaped up out of the water and swatted away Aronen's rifle shot. 
</P>
<P>
"That was leg strength," Bowen said. "That's what lifting in the summer is all 
about. I visualized those kind of blocks in my room last night when I was 
listening to music." 
</P>
<P>
The music stopped for Poway (22-3) after they grabbed a 7-5 lead early in the 
third period. After the Titans led, they continually self-destructed with 
turnovers and missed opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
And while Poway was self-destructing, Coronado (23-3) was taking advantage of 
nearly every scoring opportunity it had. After trailing 7-5, Poway scored four 
consecutive goals, including long-range bullets from Mitchell and Chris Cote. 
</P>
<P>
"I was not concerned when we fell behind," Burgess said. "Everybody was in good 
condition and we stayed with our game plan."
