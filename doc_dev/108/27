You see it from a distance, and it's like the most beautiful thing you've ever 
seen. It's like this gorgeous woman -- mysterious, alluring, powerful. It gives 
me such a great feeling when I see it on the way back from visiting my mom near 
Long Beach. It makes me feel at home, like I'm part of something special. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phillip Needham, tow truck driver, San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge 
</P>
<P>
In the beginning, it was a symbol of devastation. A lot of people feel it 
ruined Barrio Logan. When it first opened, it had a terrible, terrific impact. 
But now it's a piece of living art. It has a melodic effect on my life, my 
vision. It's a strange thing to say, but I love the bridge. -- Salvador Torres, 
artist in Barrio Logan 
</P>
<P>
I think it stinks. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Donald P. Murphy, Coronado resident 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, in the same summer as Woodstock and man's walk on the moon, a 
bridge was opened, linking the sleepy peninsula of Coronado with one of the 
country's fastest-growing cities. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would change the nature of two neighborhoods forever. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would alter political fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would serve as an avenue of suicide for the nearly 150 people who 
leaped to their deaths from its tallest point, and as a way to sustain life for 
an endangered species, the peregrine falcon. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would inspire envy, resentment, awe and avarice. This bridge would 
serve as an easel for a new form of urban art. This bridge would end one method 
of transportation and give rise to another. 
</P>
<P>
This bridge would, in the summer of peace and love, inspire anything but. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago today, on Aug. 2, 1969, when the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge 
was officially opened, Robert L. Wynn, then city manager of Coronado, remembers 
riding across the majestic span in a 1918 Duesenberg, thinking, "I don't 
believe it -- it's happened!" 
</P>
<P>
Since 1971, Wynn has been city manager of Newport Beach. He has no problem 
recalling the conflict that preceded and followed the building of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
"It was voted on three times in advisory elections and defeated every time," 
Wynn said. "Truth is, the people of Coronado never wanted the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
But Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown did. Wynn said it was the partnership of Brown 
and John Alessio, then owner of the Hotel del Coronado and Brown's wealthiest 
backer, that eventually linked San Diego to Coronado by a method other than 
ferry. 
</P>
<P>
No special ceremony will mark today's anniversary. As Mary Kay Forsyth, 
executive vice president of the Coronado Chamber of Commerce, put it: "A lot of 
factions here still deeply resent the bridge. Some drive to San Diego by way of 
Imperial Beach, just to avoid taking it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Admirals Were Reassured 
</P>
<P>
Forsyth, who has lived in Coronado for 40 years, said opposition to the bridge 
crumbled when the Navy gave in. 
</P>
<P>
"For years the Navy was afraid of war, afraid that a bridge would bottle up the 
entire fleet in the South Bay," she said. "When the admirals were finally 
assured that a bridge could be built high enough to prevent that from 
happening, they said OK." 
</P>
<P>
Records show that the state considered a two-lane truss bridge in the early 
part of the century, an idea the Navy scuttled. In 1929, the San Francisco 
Bridge &amp; Tunnel Co. launched a proposal to build a bridge and commissioned 
a feasibility study -- but the stock market crash killed that idea. 
</P>
<P>
In 1935, the Coronado City Council proposed building a four-lane bridge with 
6-foot walkways on either side. Again, the Navy reared its head, saying, in the 
words of one official, "Collapsed bridges sink ships." More measures came and 
went before pro-bridge forces proved unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Brown dubbed the bridge "my baby," a catch phrase he said he invoked "to 
anger the editors of the San Diego Union. They were always so mean to me. And 
they never wanted the bridge." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said the bridge got built only because he and the three other members of 
the Toll Bridge Authority decided they would build it. Once bonds were sold, it 
was, in Brown's words, "a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
Now a Los Angeles lawyer, Brown called the Coronado Bridge "one of the great 
accomplishments of my tenure as governor. I realized I could facilitate 
thousands of people reaching the peninsula of Coronado, one of the loveliest 
bodies of land in the world. 
</P>
<P>
"It was and is," he said, "a provincial place. A lot of retired Navy people 
didn't want (the bridge) then and will tell you they don't want it now. The 
growth of the area superseded their wishes. That's the reason I wanted it built 
-- I could foresee the growth of California and particularly of San Diego 
County." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said his alliance with Alessio had "nothing to do with the bridge being 
built. He was and is a friend of mine. I wanted the bridge because it had to be 
built. Can you imagine Coronado now without the bridge? It's absurd to even 
try." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge is 2.23 miles long. The design incorporating its 27 girders -- once 
likened to flamingo legs joined by a strand -- is orthotropic, meaning the 
structural support units also form the road surface, keeping weight and costs 
down. Because the configuration provides support in different directions, the 
bridge is able to support staggering loads -- and to withstand ships striking 
the girders. 
</P>
<P>
That's happened once, said Tom Nipper, a spokesman for the California 
Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
A commercial shipping boat "knocked some of the timbers off but did no damage 
to the concrete pilings," he said. "There's never been substantial damage to 
the bridge. The bridge was built at a height (246 feet) where even the tallest 
aircraft carriers can pass underneath it. There's no way anything can strike 
the top." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge was built without lights. The designers felt those would be 
aesthetically unappealing. A series of head-on traffic accidents changed their 
minds about that, and now many credit lights as the reason for its nickname, 
"the Jewel." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge cost $48 million and was financed through the sale of construction 
bonds. Work began in February, 1967, and the bridge opened 2 1/2 years later. 
The bill was paid off in 1986, 17 years ahead of schedule. The west-bound only 
toll was $1.20 until last year, when it was reduced to $1. Officials for 
Caltrans, which owns and operates the bridge, say they don't know when, or if, 
the toll will be curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
One of the lingering controversies surrounding the bridge is its lack of a 
thoroughfare for bicyclists and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
"The bridge is a state highway," California 75, Nipper noted. "It's too 
dangerous for bicyclists and pedestrians." 
</P>
<P>
Brown said his only regret about the bridge is that it ignores bicyclists and 
walkers. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a mistake," he said. "One of the sweetest sights in the world is the 
hundreds of walkers and bicyclists who use the Golden Gate Bridge. I wish 
something could be done. . . . That would make the bridge just about perfect." 
</P>
<P>
Donald P. Murphy, 63, who was born in Coronado and moved back in 1968 after 25 
years in the Army, said scores of retirees resent the bridge, and thought they 
had given up conflict when the wars were over. Now, he says, they're locked in 
another battle -- developers versus residents, cars versus people. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm like a prisoner in my own home," said Murphy, who lives three blocks from 
the bridge at 4th and C streets, which, depending on the time, can become 
gridlocked. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy said traffic in Coronado is almost intolerable. In a few years, he said, 
the town will be reduced to "total chaos, and then the Navy will have to do 
something, because none of its personnel will be able to reach North Island due 
to the volume of traffic coming off the bridge. Until that happens, we'll all 
have to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Larson, a Caltrans spokesman, said 50,000 cars a day cross the bridge and 
half that many enter through Imperial Beach the Silver Strand. The city of 
Coronado claims a population of 23,603. Officials at North Island say they 
employ between 8,000 and 9,000 civilians and 4,200 Navy personnel. Tourism is a 
no-holds-barred industry. The bridge recorded a 6.3% increase in traffic last 
year alone. 
</P>
<P>
Toll bridge Lt. R. D. Thomas said the bridge averaged 15,000 cars a day when it 
opened. The total number of vehicles crossing the bridge in all of 1970 was 7.8 
million, he said, but the annual number now is close to 25 million. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Increases Every Year 
</P>
<P>
He said the bridge is likely to record a peak of 72,000 cars a day this summer 
(it saw 69,000 on Monday alone), and about 55,000 a day on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
Toll bridge Capt. Dennis Poirier said the bridge has averaged a 6% to 10% 
increase in traffic every year since it opened. Part of the revenue collected 
at the toll booth is used to commission studies on Coronado's traffic, he said, 
and the rest is allocated for maintenance and road repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say it's a bad problem," Poirier said. 
</P>
<P>
Former Mayor R. H. Dorman favored a tunnel that would transport cars from the 
toll plaza to a gateway near the naval base. It was defeated, and Dorman's 
fortunes sank with it. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Mary Herron, who ousted Dorman in last year's election, said the tunnel 
would have cost more than $100 million; a road around the perimeter of 
Coronado, which some favor, would cost three times that amount. She has 
proposed what she calls "the $28-million solution" to the traffic imbroglio. 
</P>
<P>
Herron's plan is being evaluated by the California Transportation Commission, 
which hopes to reach a decision on it by next month. Herron predicts that a 
sophisticated system of new bus lines and signal lights will alleviate the 
crunch, but some people are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"The buses we have now operate at less than 20% capacity," said resident 
Murphy. "I'd say the best idea is to move." 
</P>
<P>
The bridge is not without grisly traffic accidents or suicides. Mary Ann 
Tamburello, clerical supervisor for the San Diego County coroner, said 145 
people have killed themselves by leaping from the bridge. Most were men in 
their early 20s. 
</P>
<P>
Three signs in each direction now offer would-be victims the phone number of a 
suicide hot line. Two signs are near the center of the bridge, where the span 
reaches its greatest height from the water. 
</P>
<P>
Phillip Needham, 51, works as a tow truck driver for Caltrans. He said he has 
tried to stop 48 people from jumping and credits himself, like a proud relief 
pitcher, with 25 "saves." 
</P>
<P>
"They're up there, they're confused, somebody doesn't love 'em or they've just 
given up," he said. "What do I say? Each one is different. Sometimes I'm nice. 
Sometimes I'm firm. I try to snap them out of their mood, whatever that is. And 
when I don't succeed . . . it's just a horrible thing to witness." 
</P>
<P>
Four peregrine falcons have, at various times, nested under the bridge, above 
Salvador Torres' murals in Chicano Park. Jim Larson of Caltrans believes the 
birds picked the bridge because it's isolated, and they can feed on the pigeons 
beneath its arches. 
</P>
<P>
Peregrine falcons are an endangered species. For a long time after the bridge 
was built, Torres said the neighborhood nearby was endangered, too. Like the 
falcons, it learned to adapt. 
</P>
<P>
The communities most affected by the bridge -- Coronado and Barrio Logan -- are 
alarmingly different, a graphic illustration of America as a land of haves and 
have-nots. The burden each shares is having been irrevocably altered by the 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
A cluster of chichi shops greets visitors off the new passenger ferry, which 
first docked in Coronado in 1987. Peohe's, the restaurant nearest the landing, 
offers lobster for $34.95. Just a few miles away in the barrio, Cuatro Milpas 
sells five rolled tacos for $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the streets in the barrio are dark and mean, and a few people have 
spent years trying to undo the damage inflicted by the bridge and Interstate 5, 
which cut a swath through the neighborhood a few years before. 
</P>
<P>
Rachael Ortiz, executive director of Barrio Station, a social-service agency, 
said the worst aspect of the bridge was the neighborhood being converted to 
"mixed use and seedy light industry," not to mention the havoc wreaked on homes 
and families. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Split the Community 
</P>
<P>
After the bridge was built, "dozens of these creepy businesses moved in," she 
said. "There were shipbuilding shops, welders, sandblasters. . . . The 
employees, and there were hundreds of 'em, parked wherever they could, even if 
it meant your front yard. Children were crossing streets in front of giant 
trucks, and right over our heads was this great big bridge, casting its shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"In the beginning, it split the community, and we were enraged. The area was 
raped by anyone wanting to make money. Overnight, we became their whores -- the 
junkyard empire of San Diego. But now, slowly, it's changing. We've targeted 23 
junkyards, and, except for one, all have adopted enclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody cared about building a bridge over us -- in the beginning, we didn't 
matter -- but we made them care. The lesson is, one person's treasure can be 
another's demise." 
</P>
<P>
Community activist Al Ducheny said the opening of the freeway severed the 
barrio from Logan Heights, and the bridge bisected the barrio, "completing the 
devastation." The neighborhood's takeover of what became Chicano Park and the 
murals that followed "turned a bad thing into a good thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Now the survivors in Barrio Logan speak of their concrete ceiling in tones far 
more loving than those muttered in Coronado. Torres, the artist, is one of 
those who views the bridge with a feeling approaching reverence. 
</P>
<P>
"When I look into the depth of the columns, as the arches flow toward the 
waterfront, I hear a sound, a mystical sound, like that of a living creature," 
he said. "To me, the bridge is life -- reassurance, reaffirmation . . . love. I 
know what the birds must feel when they fly over. They feel pride, in a 
fortress of beauty and strength."
