</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Memorial services will be held today for retired Chief Petty Officer Frank 
Joseph Foss, 66, a longtime member of the Navy's elite Underwater Demolition 
Teams, who died of cancer in his home Oct. 23. 
</P>
<P>
Foss joined the elite unit, forerunner of today's Navy SEAL teams, just before 
the Korean War and remained a member until his retirement in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
Foss was born in Pawtucket, R.I. He enlisted in the Navy when he was 17 and, 
during World War II, served in North Africa, where he assisted French 
Legionnaires. He left the Navy after the war but reenlisted a short time later, 
volunteering for the Underwater Demolition Team. 
</P>
<P>
In 1966, he joined the U.S. Agency for International Development and served as 
a logistics adviser in Vietnam for eight years. He received several citations 
for bravery during the 1968 Tet offensive. 
</P>
<P>
Foss was a 40-year resident of Coronado and Imperial Beach, and helped found 
the first Fleet Reserve branch in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
After his return from Vietnam, Foss settled in Imperial Beach, where he devoted 
much of his time to writing a book about his duty in Vietnam. The book will be 
sent to a publisher early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Foss is survived by eight children, Stephan Foss and Stewart Foss of Rhode 
Island; Frank J. Foss Jr. of Coronado; Duncan Foss and William Foss of Imperial 
Beach; Martita Foss-Ricketson of Oceanside; Margaret Foss of San Marcos; Maria 
Foss of Chula Vista and seven grandchildren. He is also survived by four 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
Memorial services will be held at 3:30 p.m. today at the chapel at the Navy 
Amphibious Base in Coronado. His ashes will be scattered at sea with full 
military honors. The family asks that any remembrances be sent to the San Diego 
Hospice.
