The St. Augustine High School boys' basketball team must forfeit 12 games, 
including two in the City Harbor League, for using an ineligible player, school 
officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
St. Augustine had been tied for first in the league with Coronado and Christian 
(3-1), but the forfeits -- including league losses to Coronado and Marian 
Catholic -- leave the Saints at 2-19 and 1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado is first alone at 4-0.

"It was an oversight that has since been cleared up," said Marty Martin, St. 
Augustine athletic director. "The public-to-private transfer waiver form was 
never signed by the player." 
</P>
<P>
Martin said the oversight was discovered after an athlete from another sport 
had a routine interview with Principal John Sanders. It was discovered that the 
athlete hadn't signed the waiver form, leading Sanders to ask Martin about the 
basketball player. When the mistake was discovered, St. Augustine immediately 
notified the San Diego Section office, and the form was signed. 
</P>
<P>
The player missed St. Augustine's 79-76 victory over Clairemont but was back 
for the Saints' 92-88 overtime victory over University City Friday. LAURA
