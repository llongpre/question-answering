In another Division II game: 
</P>
<P>
Glendora 51, University City 45 -- Only five players scored for host Glendora, 
but three of them reached double figures. Adam Jacobsen had 18 points, 
including three three-pointers, and J.J. Olaughlin had 15 for second-seeded 
Glendora (27-5). Ray Hooper had 12 points and and Jerome Price added 10 for 
University City (24-5), the seventh seed. 
</P>
<P>
Glendora led, 28-21, at halftime. University City, the San Diego Section 
Division II runner-up, rallied to outscore Glendora, 13-8 in the third quarter 
and pull within, 36-34. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION III 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 67, Lincoln 65 -- A desperation shot by Andre Toussaint that 
traveled three-quarters the length of the court, banked off the backboard and 
then bounced off the back of the rim as time expired and Corona del Mar scored 
an upset over the No. 2 seed. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Garner scored 23 for Lincoln (22-9), but Corona del Mar's one-man show 
was more potent. John Paulsen scored 30 for the Sea Kings (20-10), including 
his team's first 14 points in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The loss snapped a 13-game winning streak for the Hornets, who also got 14 from 
Darryl McMillan and 12 from Andre Toussaint. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln has lost eight of nine games this year in which it failed to score at 
least 70 points and Coach Ron Loneski lamented after this one that the Hornets 
couldn't entice Corona del Mar to run with them. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION IV 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 71, Coronado 37 -- Laguna Beach scored 21 consecutive points in 
the third quarter on the way to the rout and Mission Bay High. Coronado (19-9) 
stayed close and was tied, 23-23, at halftime behind six blocks by center Derek 
Wastila. 
</P>
<P>
But Wastila picked up his third and fourth fouls midway through the third 
quarter and Coronado lost its momentum. The teams were tied, 25-25, before 
Laguna Beach (23-6) scored the 21 points in a row. 
</P>
<P>
John Trevino had 19 points for Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
DIVISION V 
</P>

Christian 74, St. Margaret's 52 -- Tony Clark equaled St. Margaret's total 
offensive output with 52 points as Christian won easily at home. Christian, the 
second seed, led, 34-21, at halftime and outscored San Juan Capistrano St. 
Margaret's in every quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Canoga Park Faith Baptist 67, Calipatria 52 -- Faith Baptist made 23 of 31 free 
throws and Calipatria was zero for seven at the line. Darren Wyre scored 21
