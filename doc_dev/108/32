STROKE OF BAD LUCK FOR CORONADO: CLERK DOESN'T TYPE OR COMPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Coronado has a problem: Ed Wienecke can't type a lick or work a computer, and 
he has no intention of learning how. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that Wienecke is the new city clerk, and in Coronado the city 
clerk is responsible for recording the votes and preparing the minutes of the 
City Council for posterity. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't want to be a typist. I didn't run to be a typist," says Wienecke, 
an affable 69-year-old retired Air Force military judge and contracting officer 
who was elected to the clerk's job in November. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, he wants the city to hire him a permanent deputy, sort of a glorified 
secretary who would handle the typing, a task as traditionally bound to the 
clerk's job as hammering is to carpentry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Excedrin Headache No. 800' 
</P>
<P>
As might be expected, the council is months behind in its minutes, a situation 
that has some council members in a tizzy. Mayor Mary Herron said of the entire 
matter, "It's Excedrin headache No. 800." 
</P>
<P>
Some, such as the local weekly newspaper, contend that the problem is of the 
council's own making. After the previous city clerk, Tom Patricola, who was on 
the job for more than 20 years, retired in 1987, the council decided it was 
time to redefine the post. 
</P>
<P>
With many of the clerk's former duties, such as preparing agendas and other 
clerical work taken over in recent years by two city employees, the council 
sought to make the city clerk both a part-timer and a council appointee, rather 
than an elected official. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado voters, however, prevented that last June, when they turned down the 
council and decided to keep electing the clerk. So the council was left with a 
part-time clerk whom it couldn't choose or control. 
</P>
<P>
Into the political void entered Wienecke, a former lieutenant colonel and 
two-year resident of Coronado who beat two other contenders last fall and was 
elected to a four-year term. The stripped-down job, which the council continued 
tinkering with into September, was left with only a few responsibilities, 
including the state-mandated task of keeping a book of local ordinances, 
maintaining the city seal, running elections and, not least of all, keeping 
council minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Wienecke just assumed he would have a helper, someone to handle the tedious 
chore of preparing council minutes, while he devoted himself to more weighty 
matters such as "records management." 
</P>
<P>
"But I found out I didn't have one," he said ruefully. 
</P>
<P>
At his first council meeting, Wienecke found out what being Coronado city clerk 
was all about. The meeting droned on for 6 1/2 hours, he said, the politicians 
making their speeches and lodging their votes. But he was slipping, and fast. 
</P>
<P>
"It was chaos, but no one knew that but me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But the work was just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, the meeting took me 60 to 70 hours to complete," said Wienecke, who 
is paid $75 a week. "I didn't have any idea what to expect. I didn't have (a 
previous) incumbent to tell me. I went in cold." 
</P>
<P>
Luckily for Wienecke, the council meeting is routinely taped for broadcast on 
the local cable company's public access channel, and is also taped separately 
for sound. Using his VCR, Wienecke has been able to slowly piece together the 
meetings. (Wienecke, incidentally, has also contended that attending council 
meetings isn't part of his duties.) 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bureaucratic Sing-Song 
</P>
<P>
The result is a bureaucratic sing-song: If the minutes aren't late, then they 
are wrong and unacceptable to the council. 
</P>
<P>
By the middle of last month, it was clear to Wienecke and the council, which 
also works part time and whose members also receive $75 a week, that something 
had to be done to end the lack of a legal historical record, which was 
threatening to snuff out democracy in the placid bayside city of 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Wienecke asked the council for $500 a month until June to hire a helper who 
would compile the minutes. City Manager Homer Bludau didn't like the idea. He 
asked Wienecke to take typing lessons, but Wienecke declined. 
</P>
<P>
"The long-term solution is that he learn to type or find a way to do the job," 
Bludau said. "He doesn't feel he ran for city clerk to do this kind of work." 
</P>
<P>
The council in mid-February approved the allocation, and Wienecke has hired a 
woman in San Diego prepare the minutes. She relies on the broadcast tapes that 
Wienecke provides her. Wienecke says he is almost caught up now, although the 
council has yet to approve any minutes for this year. 
</P>
<P>
What happens after the money runs out in June, no one knows. Wienecke just this 
week put in a budget request for about $20,000 to hire a deputy city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should hire one. I want a full-time deputy," he said. "I want to 
get involved in ordinance indexes and resolutions . . . records-management type 
of things." 
</P>
<P>
Wienecke, a former commissioner of beaches in Los Angeles, says he has visited 
almost all of the other city clerks in the county and that none have to work 
under his conditions. There's an election in Coronado on Tuesday to fill a 
vacant seat on the council, and Wienecke says that, as the town clerk, he is in 
charge of organizing it, though the bulk of the work will be done by the county 
registrar of voters. He's had to communicate with the registrar's office by 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one here to type a memo to the registrar for me. I can't type a 
memo," he said. "This really is a Mickey Mouse operation." 
</P>
<P>
Whether that's true or not, Mayor Herron said much of the clerk's burden has 
fallen on other city workers. 
</P>
<P>
"It falls on the shoulders of our city staff. What we have is a clerk in the 
city attorney's office who gets them (minutes) in draft form," she said. "A lot 
of people are picking up the work." 
</P>
<P>
"The job is different than what he thought," she said. "He expected to be part 
of the political debate and interface with other agencies. But it's not like 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Some council members, such as Herron and Lois Ewen, are reluctant to spend 
money to hire a full-time helper for Wienecke. "When we made the changes (to 
the clerk's post), we felt a skilled technician was needed," Ewen said, adding 
that Wienecke "has other skills, but none of those happen to be typing." 
</P>
<P>
"This is something that is taking a lot of our time and taking us away from 
more pressing issues, such as traffic," she said. 
</P>
<P>
One other thing: Wienecke recently asked the council to pay his way to Nova 
Scotia to attend an international convention of municipal clerks. The council 
said no, explaining that it had approved a policy last May not to pay for trips 
outside the United States. Wienecke thinks maybe the council is trying to tell 
him something.
