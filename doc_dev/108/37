   Scholars are having trouble putting
Francisco Vasquez de Coronado on the map.
   They want to add the 16th century Spaniard's route through the
Southwest to the National Trails System, but they aren't getting
much help from the explorer and his party.
   ``Coronado and his men had no idea where they had gone. They
were marching off the end of the known world,'' said Don Blakeslee,
Wichita State University anthropology department chairman.
   Blakeslee and Betty Romero, director of the Rice County
Coronado-Quivira Museum in Lyons, are coordinating the project for
the Coronado Trail Association.
   They've been combing historical documents - including letters
Coronado wrote the king of Spain and accounts by participants - in
hopes of determining which of 30 proposed routes is the right one.
   ``There are plenty of people who have a pet idea where he
went,'' Blakeslee said. ``Every little town anywhere near where he
might have gone would like to be able to claim Coronado.''
   In 1540, Coronado and his entourage - 300 soldiers and some
1,500 Indian guides and camp followers - set out from Mexico to
search for the legendary gold-rich Seven Cities of Cibola.
   For two years, together and in separate groups, they explored
Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. Though they found
no gold, they helped open the region to colonization.
   Romero says she wants her museum to become an interpretative
center for the trail. In April, the museum will sponsor a symposium
for scholars to view exhibits of armor and weapons used by the
conquistadors and debate where Coronado and his men traveled.
   ``We're going to try to throw out as many wrong ideas as we can
in a short period of time,'' Blakeslee said. ``But we haven't yet
gotten all of the people together who need to be in one room
arguing with one another. And we haven't done all of the field
work, which is absolutely critical.''
   Blakeslee said the field work could quickly eliminate some
routes.
   One proposed path the anthropology professor checked out was
obviously wrong. He said he crossed the Cimarron River where the
route's proponent said Coronado crossed. But the canyon the
explorers described was not there.
   Coronado's letters and the other texts offer clues, but few
definite directions.
   ``These records really weren't written to tell anybody how to
get to the places mentioned,'' Blakeslee said.
   Ambiguities in the texts also have frustrated scholars,
Blakeslee said.
   In one passage, the explorers wrote about eating nuts growing in
the area they were traveling through, but did not say what kind of
nuts. One person assumed the nuts were pecans and based a proposed
route on that assumption, Blakeslee said.
   ``You can't base your arguments on assumptions,'' he said. ``You
have to base them on something in the texts. Then you can make an
assumption, if there is any way to test it.''
   Romero and Blakeslee are hoping new information on Indian trails
may play a big role in assembling the jigsaw puzzle that previously
had critical pieces missing.
   Coronado had Indian guides who apparently knew the country
because they were able to lead the hundreds of soldiers to good
water every night of their travels in August in southwestern
Kansas, Blakeslee said.
   By using historical accounts, old maps, letters and other
documents, Blakeslee has established locations for many Indian
trails in the Great Plains.
   Just about everything important in the early history of the
Plains happened along established trails, he said.
   Most of the eight trails already in the system, including the
Santa Fe Trail in Kansas, were established along precisely known
routes, Blakeslee said. Some trails are still marked by wagon ruts
or other physical features.
   But delineating Coronado's trail hasn't been so simple. The
National Park Service was unprepared for the task when ordered by
Congress to study the feasibility of establishing a Coronado trail,
Blakeslee said.
   ``It takes a lot more effort, more manpower and entirely
different techniques,'' he said.
