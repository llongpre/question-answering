Sleepy-eyed Jerry Marsh wasn't really thinking about winning his second 
Coronado half-marathon at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday. He thought staying close to the 
leaders might be difficult enough to accomplish in weather he described as "too 
hot." 
</P>
<P>
But after surveying the field, Marsh realized early that he might have to 
re-evaluate his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"It was not a stellar field," said Marsh, comparing the competition to other 
years when the half-marathon has been used as training for the Olympic Trials. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh, a former San Diegan who now lives in Los Angeles, set his own pace and 
cruised to a 10-second victory over runner-up Marshall Varano of San Diego in 
the 16th Coronado half-marathon. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody went out and took me out early and when I saw the field, it helped my 
confidence," said Marsh, 25, who has been running the July 4 half-marathon 
since he was 12. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Cash of Denver won the women's race in 1 hour 24 minutes 12 seconds and 
Dan Larson was first among wheelchair participants in 1:10:52. 
</P>
<P>
Marsh's time of 1:10:50 was more than three minutes slower than the winning 
time last year and six seconds slower than the 1:04 he ran in 1987 when he won 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't do a 1:04 today," he said. "What I did was what I was worth. I 
think the heat had a lot to do with that." 
</P>
<P>
The distance may have played a part too. Marsh and four other runners ran an 
extra 200 to 400 meters because they were misdirected while running on the 
naval base. 
</P>
<P>
Varano, whose previous best was an 11th-place finish in '87, also said he had 
no designs on winning the race, but suddenly found himself close to the 
front-runners because of a slower-than-usual pace. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old days, I couldn't have been anywhere close to up there," said 
Varano, 25. "This time I went out easy and stayed within range. You get down 
when you don't see anybody in front of you. But that didn't happen today." 
</P>
<P>
Steve Flynn finished nine seconds behind Varano in third place. 
</P>
<P>
And while the blazing sun and humidity may have bothered many of the runners, 
Cash seemed to be unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt like I was working very hard," said Cash, a veteran of hilly 
Colorado half-marathons and 10Ks. "If you come down from the altitude, it makes 
it a lot easier." Cash said her victory was special for a couple of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm here for a reunion and I didn't know what to expect from the competition 
down here," she said. "It was nice because I turn 40 in two weeks and winning a 
race on the 4th of July is kind of special." 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 competed in the half-marathon.
