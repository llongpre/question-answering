SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: NO AIRHEAD ON AVIATION FACTS, EVEN WRONG ONES

<P>
As one of the nation's premier repositories of aviation history and artifacts, 
the Aerospace Museum in Balboa Park gets calls every day from scholars, 
journalists and flight buffs. 
</P>
<P>
The queries can be general -- "Tell me something about the development of jets" 
-- or quite specific -- "What were the names of the crew members in the fourth 
plane that took off in Jimmy Doolittle's raid?" Archivist Ray Wagner handles 
them all with aplomb, using the museum's 50 file cabinets of documents, 
histories and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Even by those standards, a dozen or so letters and long-distance calls asking 
the same question recently were unique. Many were in French. And all were 
asking about something that never happened. 
</P>
<P>
It turns out that the Paris newspaper Le Figaro was running a contest with 
multiple-choice questions, including one asking which of three aviators was the 
pilot on a historic 1936 flight from San Diego to Moscow. Unbeknown to Le 
Figaro, the second-largest paper in France, there was no such flight. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, a historic 1936 flight from Santa Monica to Moscow, and the 
pilot, Sigsmund Levaneski (a.k.a. "the Soviet Lindbergh"), was among the three 
choices provided by Le Figaro. He flew a 27 Downey Vultee, from the 
Downey-based Vultee aircraft works, which later merged with San Diego's 
Consolidated, giving rise to Convair. 
</P>
<P>
Providing the information about Levaneski (including the fact that he 
disappeared over the North Pole on a return flight) was no problem for Wagner, 
64, a retired history teacher and author of several books on aviation. Asking 
about a 27 Downey Vultee is like asking him what he had for breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
"The hardest part was struggling with my college French," Wagner said. "The 
first caller spoke no English and apparently thought that, if there was anyone 
of any intelligence here, they would, of course, speak French. Somehow we 
managed." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Is That Clear? 
</P>
<P>
The Public Utilities Commission will meet today in San Diego to discuss rules 
for the upcoming hearing on the proposed merger of SDG&amp;E and Southern 
California Edison. But don't figure on the controversy being less complex once 
the hearing is held. 
</P>
<P>
The PUC this week issued a new guide to the hearing process -- not the issues, 
just the process. It's 103 pages. 
</P>

America's Pub Race 
</P>
<P>
Move over America's Cup Race. Make room for America's Pub Race, the latest 
entry in seafaring competition. It began when U. S. and New Zealand journalists 
began arguing at Bula's Pub &amp; Eatery in Coronado over which country 
produces the best sailors. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly a challenge was set. Sail in one-man, 14-foot Lasers from Coronado to 
the Embarcadero in San Diego, hoist a few at Anthony's restaurant, sail to the 
Charthouse restaurant near the San Diego-Coronado Bay Bridge, hoist a few more, 
then sail into Glorietta Bay, land in Coronado and play your respective 
national anthem on the musical instrument of your choice. 
</P>
<P>
For the latter part of the contest, the two Kiwis, brothers Bill and Hugo 
Manson, chose bagpipes and a kazoo. The Americans, Joseph Ditler and Larry 
Edwards, chose a fiddle and a Jew's harp. 
</P>
<P>
America's Cup loser Michael Fay learned of the grudge match and sent his New 
Zealand countrymen a telegram wishing them "favorable winds and a strong 
drinking arm." 
</P>
<P>
They proved to have both, placing first and third and winning on cumulative 
time. A 3-inch trophy in their honor now rests above the bar at Bula's. 
</P>
<P>
"I figure the whole thing cost $42.50, which is $59,999,957.50 less than the 
America's Cup," Bill Manson said. "We only had one rule: Nobody resorts to 
lawyers to overturn the decision."
