Frank Chambliss coached Torrey Pines High School's baseball team to the 2-A 
championship in the Lions Tournament this season. But his team also finished 
last in the eight-team Palomar League. 
</P>
<P>
At 7 tonight at San Diego State, Chambliss will be loaded with talent. He and 
assistant Jerry Schneipp of Helix will call the shots for the 3-A team when it 
plays the 2-A in the Jack Taylor Memorial All-Star Game. The game is sponsored 
by the San Diego County Baseball Coaches Association, which selected the 
players and the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
With all the talented seniors on the field, Chambliss could have a tough time 
making decisions. When he makes a pitching change, should he bring in Orange 
Glen left-hander Scott Coleman, who set a section record with 16 consecutive 
no-hit innings earlier this season, or Mt. Carmel left-hander Doug Hill, who 
compiled a two-year record of 18-2? 
</P>
<P>
And there's always Poway's Danny Miller, who was 12-1 with a 1.22 earned-run 
average and 123 strikeouts in 92 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Those are the kinds of decisions facing Chambliss and the coach in the other 
dugout, Santana's Jim Saska, who will get advice from assistants Ron Smock of 
Coronado and Ron Lopez of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the high-profile stars, the game affords the public the 
opportunity to see players they normally wouldn't, such as Julian's Travis 
Denmark, who hit 13 home runs, drove in 42 runs and pitched his team to the 1-A 
championship, and Christian's Tony Clark, who hit 11 home runs for the Harbor 
League's last-place Patriots and is expected to be among the first players 
taken in Monday's free agent draft. They will compete for the 2-A.
