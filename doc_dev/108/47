In yet another transaction involving the sale of a Southern California resort 
property to Japanese investors, the 300-room Le Meridien San Diego at Coronado 
luxury hotel is to be purchased by Chiyoda Finance, the hotel's seller said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
The sale price was not disclosed. Derek Thomas, director of real estate 
consulting at Kenneth Leventhal &amp; Co. in San Diego said, however, that the 
deal may be comparable to the $280,000 per room price that Japanese investors 
paid for the Dana Point Resort in July. At that price, Le Meridien would be 
worth about $84 million. 
</P>
<P>
The seller is Park at Coronado, a San Diego-based limited partnership whose 
general partners include George Codling, Alan Greenway, Malin Burnham and 
Thomas James. The partnership owns the hotel structure but leases its 16-acre 
bayfront site under a 50-year agreement with the San Diego Port District. 
</P>
<P>
Open since June, 1988, the hotel fronting San Diego Bay on Coronado Island is 
managed under a 20-year contract by the French-owned Le Meridien chain, Codling 
said. No changes in management are planned by the prospective owners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Le Meridien is the third major resort project in San Diego County to attract 
Japanese investors in recent years. Sport Shinko of Osaka bought the La Costa 
Resort Hotel in Carlsbad for $250 million in 1987. Earlier this year, TSA 
International, a Honolulu-based firm controlled by a Japanese businessman, 
acquired a major ownership stake in the $100-million Four Seasons Aviara resort 
soon to start construction in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
In July, the 350-room Dana Point Resort in Orange County was sold to Tokyo 
Masuiwaya California Corp., the investment arm of Japan's leading kimono 
manufacturer, for a reported $104 million. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese are starting to realize that the trophy and primary properties in 
Los Angeles have already been bought out," said Kenneth Leventhal's Thomas. 
"The word we get is (Japanese investors) are focusing on prime properties 
outside of Los Angeles up and down the coast. So, in San Diego we can expect 
several more acquisitions." 
</P>
<P>
The stock in Chiyoda Finance is held by six private Japanese corporations and 
six publicly owned corporations, including Nippon Credit Bank, Nippon Steel, 
Daiwa Bank and Ohbayashi Construction, Codling said. 
</P>
<P>
Chiyoda also recently acquired the 478-room Marriott Hotel in Torrance and a 
30,000-square-foot office building in Palo Alto. Escrow for the Le Meridien 
sale is scheduled to close by late next month and is subject to approval by the 
port district at a meeting scheduled for Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
The Le Meridien hotel property includes three pools, six tennis courts, meeting 
space and two restaurants, Marius and L'Escale. Most of the rooms go for $145 
to $205 a night, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Codling said the hotel owners did not intend to sell the property until it set 
out recently to secure permanent financing to replace a $44-million 
construction loan. In the course of pursuing the longer-term loan, the owners 
came into contact with the Japanese group that was "persistent" in its desire 
to acquire the property. 
</P>
<P>
"Theirs became a price that we felt was an economically viable proposal for us 
to consider," Codling said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenway at first secured rights to develop the choice Coronado hotel site in 
the early 1980s by winning a design competition conducted by the port district. 
He later joined forces with Burnham, Codling and James in order to finance and 
develop the site. 
</P>
<P>
Burnham is chairman of First National Bank of San Diego. Burnham, Codling and 
James are partners in ADI Properties, a San Diego real estate development firm 
that has built more than 1.75 million square feet of industrial and office 
space since its founding in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
Although ADI has no hotel projects on the drawing board, Codling said the firm 
plans a 400-acre business park in Poway south of Poway Road and 3 miles east of 
Interstate 15.
