Sweetwater High, with four returning starters from a 25-3 team, is the 
unanimous pick of Metro Conference coaches to win the boys' basketball 
conference again as the 1989-90 season gets under way Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"They look really polished," Chula Vista Coach Mike Collins said. "Down the 
road some of us may catch up a little, but we're not there yet." 
</P>
<P>
The Red Devils with returning starters Joe McDowell, Carlos Campbell, John 
Gilbert and Melvin Rushing are loaded with quickness and leapers, conducive to 
their full-court pressing style of play. 
</P>
<P>
After Sweetwater, Metro coaches place Chula Vista, Bonita Vista, Southwest and 
Hilltop in a group most likely disrupt the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
None of the existing eight Metro teams has ever won a section basketball 
championship. Since divisional playoffs began two years ago taking the place of 
the 3-A/2-A class structure playoffs, no Metro team has advanced past the 
quarterfinal round. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater, among others, hopes to change that in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
THE RACE 
</P>
<P>
Top contender: Sweetwater (25-3 in 1988-89). 
</P>
<P>
Surprise potential: Chula Vista (13-15), Southwest (21-8), Bonita Vista (5-18), 
Hilltop (11-16). 
</P>
<P>
Hoping for improvement: Castle Park (8-16), Mar Vista (6-19), Montgomery 
(0-20). 
</P>
<P>
Game of the year: Sweetwater at Chula Vista, Feb. 12. Second to last game of 
the season for both teams could determine the championship, if Sweetwater 
hasn't already clinched. The game was to have been played Wednesday but was 
rescheduled because Sweetwater, the county's only year-round high school, is on 
a three-week break. 
</P>
<P>
THE PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
The men: Sweetwater Coach David Ybarra had a brief scare last week when his 
star guards, Joe McDowell and Carlos Campbell, both suffered injuries in the 
first quarter against Mira Mesa. Both injuries -- McDowell hurt his shooting 
(right) wrist and Campbell fell on and strained his lower back -- proved to be 
minor, and they both returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
McDowell and Campbell are -- by nearly every coaches assessment -- the men to 
watch in the conference. McDowell, a 6-2 senior, is a four-year starter for the 
Red Devils. After five games this year, he is averaging 18.2 points. Campbell, 
a 6-4 senior, is a three-year starter averaging 11.8 points. 
</P>
<P>
This past summer both played in Los Angeles' prestigious Slam 'n' Jam summer 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Who will fill Will Tate's shoes? Will Tate, now a defensive back for San Diego 
State's football team, was a Times All-County first-team selection. In leading 
Southwest to a 21-8 mark, Tate averaged 17.4 points, six assists and five 
steals. 
</P>
<P>
And now that he's gone? "We can't find anybody to fill his shoes," Southwest 
Coach Steve Selland said. "I've tried several guys, but it's going to take 
awhile." 
</P>
<P>
Selland said in the long run one of three sophomores will fill Tate's point 
guard position. They are Darren Davis, Rod Lerma and Joe Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
Others to watch on offense: Guard John Gilbert, averaging 12.8 points, adds a 
third ingredient to a potent Sweetwater attack. Chula Vista's Shane Howell 
(12.8-point average) and Derek Chapman (10), Montgomery's George Scott (20), 
Mar Vista's Tim Page (13.5) and Tim O'Neal (13) are off to good starts. 
</P>
<P>
Allen McNamee (18), Mike Barnett (17) and Rope Perry (17) give Bonita Vista a 
formidable scoring trio. Aldaberto Silva, if eligible, is a four-year starter 
for Southwest and one of the county's best players. 
</P>
<P>
THE INTANGIBLES 
</P>
<P>
Less is more: For the fifth consecutive year, there is a change in the makeup 
of the Metro Conference. Last year, the conference fielded 10 teams that played 
an unbalanced 14-game season. This year, Coronado and Marian decided to join 
the new Harbor League making the Metro an eight-team league with a 14-game 
symmetrical season. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's good for (Coronado and Marian), and it's good for us," Castle 
Park Coach Dan Winters said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Hilltop Coach Chip Holmes, "I never liked playing Coronado in that gym 
anyway. That was one team I'm glad to see go." 
</P>
<P>
Less is more, Part II: Former Kentucky Coach Adolph Rupp's 1965-66 team 
finished second in the NCAA tournament losing to Texas Western despite its 
tallest starter being 6-5. The team became known as "Rupp's Runts". 
</P>
<P>
Despite its tallest player being 6-4 and the next closest being 6-2, 
Sweetwater's "Diminutive Devils" should challenge for the section's Division I 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Ever since I've been here, we haven't been big," McDowell said. "We just have 
to play good defense, get the ball out and run." 
</P>
<P>
Less is unfortunate : Led by Silva, there are a number of talented players who 
will not be playing when league-play begins. Silva, after a long dispute with 
the section over his desire to transfer to Sweetwater, returned to Southwest 
but was declared academically ineligible Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Southwest also lost Laurence Estes, who moved out of the state. Kansas 
transfers Jermayne Montgomery and James Mathews of Montgomery are awaiting word 
on their eligibility from Kendall Webb, the section's commissioner. Under CIF 
rules an out-of-state transfer living with guardians -- as the two are -- must 
be declared hardships or sit out a year. 
</P>
<P>
Mar Vista sophomore Porgie Yokley, a talented Virginia transfer, has decided 
not to play this season. Chula Vista's Louie Zumstein, a Times second-team 
football selection at offensive tackle expected to be recruited by Division I 
schools, has decided to concentrate on working out for football. 
</P>
<P>
Casey June, who would have been a three-year starter at Bonita Vista, is 
playing soccer this year for the defending 3-A champion Barons. 
</P>
<P>
Castle Park's Benji Gil, is eligible, but may or may not play this season to 
concentrate on his studies and baseball.
