<LEADPARA>  After 18 years at the same location, the owner of Harry's Liquors and Bavarian
Deli at the border of West San Jose and Cupertino is worried that progress is
about to ruin him.;    A plan to reroute street traffic for Highway 85's
Rainbow Drive interchange means that Coronado Drive, where Harry's is, will be
cut off from Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Harry Schrader, who owns the business, said losing drive-in traffic from
Saratoga-Sunnyvale could doom his store.;    "I would have to close it, sell
it or move it," he said. "I can afford none of those things. That's why I'm
fighting for my survival.";    Officials from San Jose, the California
Department of Transportation and the Santa Clara County Traffic Authority,
which worked jointly on plans for the area, said the rerouting is necessary to
avoid traffic and safety problems when the interchange is completed.;   
Schrader has been vigorously lobbying those agencies, but so far, he has had
little luck.;    Last Thursday, the San Jose City Council's transportation and
development committee recommended accepting the plan for Coronado Drive. The
matter is expected to come before the council for a vote later this month.;   
Despite Schrader's concerns for the businesses on Coronado Drive, some
residents of the street said blocking access from Saratoga-Sunnyvale will be
good for the neighborhood.;    "We're all for it," said Terry Johns, who noted
that the businesses will still be accessible from side streets. "I think it's
the best of both worlds: It's going to allow access to those businesses, and
it's going to keep (excess) traffic off the street.";    Tona Duncanson, an
aide to San Jose Councilwoman Trixie Johnson, whose district includes the
street, said both arguments have merit.;    But city traffic engineers said
that safety concerns are paramount and that Coronado Drive's access to Stevens
Creek should be blocked.;    Eileen Goodwin, a spokeswoman for the traffic
authority, which is overseeing the extension of Highway 85, said the agencies
involved in the project are eager to offset any potential harm to businesses
on Coronado Drive.;    "Whatever can be done, will be done," she said. That
could include posting street signs on Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road directing
motorists to Coronado Drive businesses via Rainbow Drive.;    But Schrader
complained that his business relies heavily on drivers who make a quick stop
as they travel down Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road.;    "I've been collecting city
taxes for 18 years. I think there should be a little consideration.";    The
18.5-mile Highway 85 extension will run to Highway 101 in South San Jose.  </TEXT>
