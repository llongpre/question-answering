<P>
The new 1989-90 San Diego County Grand Jury was chosen Monday in a drawing at 
the County Courthouse downtown and will be sworn in June 30. 
</P>
<P>
County Clerk Robert D. Zumwalt drew the 19 names from a box that contained an 
initial pool of 62 people. Eleven alternates were also selected. Those in the 
drawing were nominated by judges in the Municipal and Superior courts.

<P>
The new Grand Jury will serve from July 1 through June 30, 1990. The jury is 
empowered to examine issues within city and county government. It has the 
authority to investigate special districts, joint-powers agencies and nonprofit 
corporations.

The jury also handles citizen complaints and, under certain circumstances, may 
hold hearings in criminal investigations to determine whether enough evidence 
has been presented by the district attorney to warrant a trial.
