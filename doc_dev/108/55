<LEADPARA>  After 18 years at the same location, the owner of Harry's Liquors and Bavarian
Deli at the border of West San Jose and Cupertino is worried that progress is
about to ruin him.;    A plan to reroute street traffic for the Rainbow Drive
interchange of Highway 85 means that Coronado Drive, where Harry's is located,
will be cut off from access to Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Harry Schrader, who owns the business, says that losing drive-in traffic
from Saratoga-Sunnyvale could doom his store.;    "I would have to close it,
sell it or move it," he said. "I can afford none of those things. That's why
I'm fighting for my survival.";    Officials of the city of San Jose, the
California Department of Transportation and the Santa Clara County Traffic
Authority, which worked jointly on the plans for the area, say the rerouting
is necessary to avoid traffic and safety problems when the interchange is
completed.;    Schrader has been vigorously lobbying those agencies, but so
far, he has not had much luck.;    Last Thursday the San Jose City Council's
transportation and development committee recommended accepting the plan for
Coronado Drive. The matter is expected to come before the council for a vote
later this month.;    Despite Schrader's concerns for the businesses on
Coronado Drive, some residents of the street say that blocking access from
Saratoga-Sunnyvale will be good for the neighborhood.;    "We're all for it,"
said resident Terry Johns, who pointed out that the businesses will still be
accessible from adjacent side streets. "I think it's the best of both worlds:
it's going to allow access to those businesses, and it's going to keep
(excess) traffic off the street.";    Tona Duncanson, an aide to San Jose
Councilwoman Trixie Johnson, whose district includes the disputed street, said
both arguments have merit.;    However, city traffic engineers believe that
safety concerns are paramount and that Coronado Drive's access to Stevens
Creek should be blocked.;    According to Eileen Goodwin, a spokeswoman for
the Traffic Authority, which is overseeing the extension of Highway 85, the
agencies involved in the project are eager to offset any potential harm to
businesses on Coronado Drive.;    "Whatever can be done, will be done," she
said. That could include posting street signs on Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road
directing motorists to Coronado Drive businesses via Rainbow Drive.;    But
Schrader complained that his business relies heavily on drivers who make a
quick stop as they travel down Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road.  </TEXT>
