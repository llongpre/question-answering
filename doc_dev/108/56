Plea-bargain negotiations continue in the case of Coronado heart surgeon Dr. 
Juan Suros XII, who has been charged by New York authorities with stealing more 
than $1 million in rare coins from a prestigious Manhattan coin society. 
</P>
<P>
At a hearing Friday in New York State Supreme Court, the case against Suros, 
48, was continued until June 25, when both sides are expected to agree on a 
plea. 
</P>
<P>
Suros, who also uses the name Juan XII, Count of Besalu, was charged with grand 
larceny and possession of stolen property last September after allegedly 
stealing about 71 coins, mostly rare Spanish and Mexican ones, from the 
American Numismatic Society's Manhattan offices. If convicted, Suros faces 25 
years in a New York prison. 
</P>
<P>
Don Birnbaum, Suros' New York attorney, declined to comment on the case except 
to say that "further discussions are ongoing." 
</P>
<P>
Gloria Montealegre, spokeswoman for the New York district attorney's office, 
said Tuesday that the two sides have been negotiating a plea bargain for 
several months. A trial date could be set June 25 if an agreement is not 
reached by then, she added. 
</P>
<P>
Suros, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was born in Spain. He was graduated from the 
University of Barcelona. Widely known as an able heart surgeon, Suros has an 
office in Chula Vista and a home on Isabella Avenue in Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
According to reports in New York City newspapers, Suros told police in a 
videotaped interview that he stole the coins because he "loved them and had to 
have them." Investigators said Suros planned to add the stolen coins to his 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
All of the coins were recovered, some of them in Suros' home and office, 
including a gold Roman coin from 134-138 A.D., six gold Visigoth coins minted 
between 586 and 609 A.D., and six 18th-Century coins and medals from Spain and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
New York police said the thefts occurred between December, 1988, and April, 
1989. Society officials told investigators that coins would mysteriously 
disappear every time Suros handled coin trays. As a member and contributor to 
the society, Suros was allowed to handle the rare coins. 
</P>
<P>
Suros was arrested April 15, 1989, in his room at the Harvard Club in 
Manhattan, where police said they recovered 13 of the stolen coins. His arrest 
came hours before he was scheduled to receive an award from the society at the 
Knickerbocker Club. Suros was among several benefactors who were feted for 
their financial contributions to the society's endowment. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan S. Maiman, one of Suros' attorneys, said last year that his client had 
contributed more than $100,000 to the society. He joined the organization in 
1984.
