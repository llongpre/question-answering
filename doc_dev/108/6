CORONADO GANG

I am writing in response to an article titled "Coronado Question: Does It Have 
a Gang Problem?" (Oct. 19) I find the so-called Coronado White Boys a revolting 
and ill-humored joke. Any form of respect (or humor, for that matter) cannot be 
dug up for these kids who make a feeble attempt at imitating those serious 
gangs on the mainland. Just calling themselves a "gang" already has invited a 
lot of dispute. Inevitably, so will it invite the serious gangs of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Such easy prey as a group of Coronado White Boys would be a pleasure for those 
gangs that dispute violently over colors and territory. Besides, any gang could 
just hop in a car with two or more members, and drive over the bay for free. 
The Coronado Bay Bridge begins in the Barrio Logan area of San Diego, a prime 
hangout for local gangs. It would only be a five- to 10-minute commute over to 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that these white boys be exposed to what gangs really are all about. 
I suggest that they be taken away from their secure and untouched homes in 
Coronado and placed in the middle of a gang-infested neighborhood. I'd like to 
see their shocked faces as an innocent 10-year-old boy gets hit by gang 
cross-fire at a public park. I'd like them to attend a high school where they 
couldn't wear a certain color for fear of being terrorized by a gang. Would 
these teens still mock and imitate a gang with humorous intent after seeing the 
corruption and evil of a typical San Diego gang? Would they still have the 
nerve to form a gang in their community after seeing the fear gangs create in 
communities? 
</P>
<P>
And the answer to the Coronado question? Yes, Coronado has a gang problem. If 
these teens succeeded in forming a gang, with innocent intentions or not, then 
Coronado should be shuddering with fear of the possibility that it too can be 
infected with the widespread disease of gangs.
