Every ounce of confidence Southwest High had built up before it played 
Sweetwater in a Metro Conference baseball game Thursday was reinforced after 
the first inning when the Raiders scored five runs to get the early jump. 
</P>
<P>
But after the second inning, that confidence was stripped away as the host Red 
Devils defeated Southwest, 6-5, scoring the winning run on a walk in the bottom 
of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost this because of a lack of confidence," Southwest Coach Tom Hernandez 
said. "They still don't know they can play. They got a big lead, then went to 
sleep and couldn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who played their third consecutive eight-inning game, may have 
dozed a bit, but the hitting and pitching performance of Sweetwater pitcher 
Isaac Bruce (3-3) was enough to wake even the heaviest of sleepers. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce had a disastrous first inning in which he gave up three hits, walked 
three and gave up five runs. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw Lorenzo (Ruelas) warming up," Bruce said, "and I thought that if I 
didn't get my act together, I'm going to get pulled." 
</P>
<P>
So, sandwiched between two Southwest doubles, one in the second inning and one 
in the eighth, Bruce got his act together by retiring 18 batters. His 13 
strikeouts are a career high and a school record. 
</P>
<P>
"After he got out of the second (inning), he was OK," Sweetwater Coach Jim Mann 
said. "I was ready to pull him, but it was early and we decided to force the 
mistakes and just let them play." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce was an additional menace at the plate, where he was two for five, 
including a triple, scored twice and drove in a run. 
</P>
<P>
Three of Southwest's five runs were scored on Enrique Gurrola's triple to the 
center-field fence. Southwest is 2-1, 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
Sweetwater (2-2, 7-8) scored three runs on three hits in the third inning and 
two runs on two hits in the fourth to tie it up. In the eighth, the Red Devils 
collected four hits before Southwest freshman pitcher Victor Caracoza (3-1) 
walked in the winning run.
