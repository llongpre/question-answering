<HEAD>Judge Says Vet's Flag Makes Too Much Noise</HEAD>

   A 20-year Navy veteran whose American
flag made a lot of noise when the wind blew was convicted Tuesday of
violating the city's noise ordinance.
   Each morning as the sun rises, Lee Bach has unrolled his flag,
which is 3 feet by 5 feet, and hoisted it up a 40-foot flagpole. He
has followed the ritual for about two years since moving to his
house.
   ``I always said that when I had a house built, I'd put in a flag
pole and fly the flag properly,'' said Bach, who was stationed
aboard the USS Bennington during World War II.
   His neighbor, Gena Contreras, filed a public nuisance charge
against Bach when Bach failed to comply with her request that he not
fly his flag while she is at home.
   Municipal Judge Jose Coronado said he found Bach guilty, but
deferred sentencing for 30 days, ``during which time I'm hoping both
parties get together and work out something agreeable to both.''
   ``If it's brought bo my attention that they weren't able to reach
an agreement, then I'm in a position to enter a sentence,'' Coronado
said.
   Municipal court can impose a maximum penalty of $300 and 90 days
in jail, Coronado said.
