Most people would give anything to own a stretch of the San Diego County shore, 
especially if it includes a fishing pier and a short drive to a venerable 
tourist center like the Hotel del Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
Not the City of Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The financially ailing border town is so desperate to cut costs that it is 
actually asking the state for permission to give away its responsibility for 
3.5 miles of oceanfront from Coronado to the Mexican border. 
</P>
<P>
At the city's request, Sen. Wadie P. Deddeh (D-Bonita) on Wednesday introduced 
legislation that would allow the beleaguered city of 24,500 residents to deed 
over its tidelands to the San Diego Unified Port District, which controls most 
of the other tidelands in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Such a transfer, city officials say, would save the Imperial Beach treasury 
$1.5 million each year in expenses to patrol and maintain the beach, as well as 
pay off the bill for an extensive face lift of the municipal pier. 
</P>
<P>
With those expenses gone -- they gobble up 30% of the city budget -- the city 
has a chance to reverse its dismal record of municipal finance and keep from 
becoming financially insolvent by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"If something doesn't happen before the end of the budget year in July 1990, 
the city should begin its disincorporation," said Richard Jung, Imperial Beach 
director of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
And, just in case the tidelands transfer isn't enough, Deddeh said Wednesday, 
he also will introduce measures during the next few weeks as a sort of 
piecemeal financial aid package for San Diego County's neediest city. One of 
the bills would propose that the state loan the city $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
"Imperial Beach may just be the only city in the state that is experiencing 
this kind of financial difficulty, and I hope they are the only one," Deddeh 
said about the unusual loan. "And, if my colleagues are compassionate, I plan 
to plead my case with the governor . . . and see if we can swing it." 
</P>
<P>
The city's financial woes are the result of a decade of deficit spending, in 
which city fathers consistently dipped into the financial reserves to make up 
for a shortfall in municipal revenues, officials say. The city has also made 
some major mistakes, like the $300,000 loss it suffered in 1986 and 1987 on bad 
stock investments. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, the City Council created another financial fiasco when it voted to 
spend $2.9 million to refurbish its 1,500-foot fishing pier so it could be 
leased to a commercial sportfishing business. 
</P>
<P>
Although paying off the bonds would cost $356,000 a year, council members 
thought they could make that up with the city's share of the fishing business 
revenues -- estimated at the time to be between $150,000 to $500,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
But so far, the city hasn't received anything because the business, Imperial 
Beach Sportfishing Inc., has yet to set up shop. 
</P>
<P>
Although the city receives no revenue from its beaches, it pays out nearly a 
third of its $5-million municipal budget to keep them clean and safe, said 
Imperial Beach City Manager Ron Jack. 
</P>
<P>
And, to add insult to injury, statistics show that only about 25% of the people 
who use the beaches are Imperial Beach residents; the rest are people who pay 
no taxes for beach upkeep, Jack said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure that controlling your destiny is paying 30% of your budget and 
getting no return," Jack said. 
</P>
<P>
The solution: Give the beach away. 
</P>
<P>
Jack said Wednesday that deeding the tidelands over to the Port District was 
supposed to be done after the 1963 formation of the district by the 
Legislature. The four other member cities in the district -- San Diego, Chula 
Vista, Coronado and National City -- all gave their tidelands to the port, 
which then became responsible for coastline commercial and recreational 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach, however, held onto its land temporarily to help the district in 
its planning for a second bay entrance near the border. When plans for the 
second entrance fell through, Imperial Beach never bothered to officially give 
its land to the port -- a decision that led to a constant drain on city 
coffers, Jack said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Deddeh's bill would "clean up 27 years of history, where the city was 
not a direct beneficiary of the Port District, although city residents paid the 
initial taxes to establish the Port District." 
</P>
<P>
Port commissioners last week went on record supporting any efforts to deed the 
Imperial Beach tidelands to the port, a district spokesman said Wednesday.
