   Copley Press Inc., San Diego, Calif., said it isn't for sale despite an expression of interest from Larry Lawrence, owner of Hotel del Coronado in Coronado, Calif. 

   Copley Press, owned by Helen Copley and her family, publishes the San Diego Union, the Tribune in San Diego and 12 other daily newspapers. 

   Hubert Kaltenbach, president of Copley Press, said he met with Mr. Lawrence late last month. 
"It was a preliminary talk about whether or not Mrs. Copley would consider selling the paper," said Mr. Kaltenbach. 
He said Mr. Lawrence said the company "could be worth" $1.2 billion but noted that it wasn't a formal offer. 

   Mr. Lawrence couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mr. Kaltenbach said Mrs. Copley rejected the idea of selling the company. 
"She's a working newspaper person herself and she enjoys the business," he said. 
He declined to estimate the firm's value. 

   Copley Press, owned by the Copley family since 1905, also owns Copley News Service and papers elsewhere in California and in Illinois.
