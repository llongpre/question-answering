   A federal grand jury here indicted a former district manager of an Enserch Corp. unit for an alleged kickback scheme involving natural gas supplies that netted him $368,400. 

   U.S. attorneys said the indictment was part of a grand jury investigation into "widespread corruption and corporate bribery in the natural gas industry." 
The officials wouldn't indicate if further indictments are forthcoming. 

   The grand jury indicted Richard H. Wilkins of Corpus Christi, Texas, former district manager for Enserch's Lone Star Gas Co. unit. 
It also indicted RICO Industries Inc., a corporation owned by Mr. Wilkins, who couldn't be reached for comment. 
In Dallas, Robert Murphy, Lone Star Gas vice president, said the company has cooperated with the Department of Justice and the U.S. Postal Inspectors in their investigation. 
He said the company "had no knowledge of Mr. Wilkins's alleged illegal activities" and that Mr. Wilkins left the company five years ago. 
He added that Lone Star "fully supports vigorous prosecution of this matter." 

   The indictment said that in the early 1980s, Mr. Wilkins recommended that Lone Star purchase natural gas from Coronado Transmission Co. in return for a percentage of the revenue from the sales. 

   An attorney for Coronado Transmission, a natural gas concern based in Corpus Christi, said the company hadn't yet seen the indictment and couldn't comment on it. 

   The indictment said that Coronado concealed the payments to Mr. Wilkins by making them to RICO through another company.
