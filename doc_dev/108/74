The Mater Dei High School boys' basketball team enters Southern California 
Division I regional play at 7:30 tonight with one eye on first-round opponent 
North Hollywood and another on longtime rival Long Beach Poly. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Mater Dei (30-1) plays host to North Hollywood (23-3) at Ocean 
View High. North Hollywood upset Fremont, 76-71, in the Los Angeles City 
section's 3-A championship game with forward Dana Jones scoring 29 points and 
pulling down 29 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Guard Harry Marks played a key role in North Hollywood's title run, improving 
his scoring average from 14 points in the regular season to 26 points in the 
playoffs. Robert Hill averages 12 points for North Hollywood, which allows an 
average of only 52 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei has won 22 consecutive games since losing to Long Beach Poly, 54-47, 
in the title game of the Tournament of Champions at Ocean View in December. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't shoot very well against them in the Tournament of Champions, and 
yeah, we'd like another shot at Poly," Andy Karich said. "Our goal this year 
was to win every game and the state title. 
</P>
<P>
"Since we lost that game to Poly, our goal has continued to be to win the state 
title. We know we have to beat two good teams if we hope to get another shot at 
Poly." 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach Poly (26-2) is the top-seeded team in the division and opens against 
Loyola at Long Beach College. Mater Dei defeated Loyola, 83-57, Saturday night 
to win the Southern Section 5-A title. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei and Long Beach Poly were the most dominant programs in the Southern 
Section in the 1980s. Poly won the state title in 1984 after defeating Mater 
Dei, 45-44, in the Southern Section 5-A championship. Mater Dei won the state 
title in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Poly Coach Rod Palmer is one of two Southern California coaches with a winning 
record (3-1) against Mater Dei Coach Gary McKnight, who is 223-19 in eight 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Division I championship has been moved to 8:30 p.m. Friday at the Los 
Angeles Sports Arena to avoid a conflict with a Clippers' game Saturday. Other 
divisional title games are scheduled for Saturday.
