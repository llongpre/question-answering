Ten years ago, Brent Clingman took his grandmother for a ride in an off-track 
race car through the desert on her birthday. He promised her that, if she lived 
to be 85, he would take her on a helicopter ride. She turned 85 Thursday and 
collected. 
</P>
<P>
"For her 75th birthday, I got a male stripper for her and took her for a ride 
in the desert in a race car," he said. "She was a little scared at first, but 
then she told me to go faster. So, I drove about 90 to 95 through the sand and 
dirt." 
</P>
<P>
Nina Z. Hoke remembers the ride, but she remembers the stripper even better. 
</P>
<P>
"He was great," she said. "He was more embarrassed than I was. He was a cute 
boy." 
</P>
<P>
To lure his grandmother to Corporate Helicopters of San Diego, based at Jimsair 
Aviation Services on Pacific Highway, Clingman told her he was taking her to an 
outdoor restaurant for dinner. However, when they arrived at the airfield, Hoke 
still did not think anything was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought my daughter and her husband were flying in from Wyoming, because her 
husband owns a private plane," she said. "I didn't know I would be going up." 
</P>
<P>
But, after pilot Roland Rozzelle strapped the San Diego grandmother into the 
five-seat New Bell Jetranger, Clingman reminded her of the 10-year-old promise. 
</P>
<P>
Hoke was joined on the 20-minute flight by Clingman, his 6-year-old daughter, 
Chrissy, and a reporter. The aircraft flew 600 feet over La Jolla, including 
Mt. Soledad, and circled back over the city and Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
"We're lower than the palm trees," Hoke said as the helicopter roared past La 
Jolla Cove at 90 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
As the pilot headed to the final site of the sky tour toward the Coronado 
Bridge, Hoke warned him to be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
"If we're going to go over the bridge, then do it quick," she said. 
</P>
<P>
When the flight was over, she hugged and kissed her grandson and told him that 
it was "very good." 
</P>
<P>
Clingman also planned a surprise birthday party for her Thursday night at the 
Mandarin Dynasty on University Avenue. About 40 friends, some of whom she had 
not seen in years, were expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old free-lance photographer described his grandmother as a hard 
worker. He said she picks up his two daughters from school in her 12-year-old 
car at least three times a week and takes them where they want to go. She 
occasionally baby-sits for the girls, the second one being 7 years old. 
</P>
<P>
She also volunteers at two organizations in Balboa Park, the Old Globe Theatre 
and the Hall of Champions, a sports museum. 
</P>
<P>
"She outruns all of us," said Pat Hawkins, administrative assistant at the 
museum. "She's a ball of fire, she whizzes in, does her thing and whizzes out." 
</P>
<P>
For three days each week, Hoke takes care of her 79-year-old bed-ridden sister, 
who also lives in San Diego. And, today, Hoke will attend the Padres game. She 
has season tickets for Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
For 30 years, the great-grandmother of four worked as an escrow officer and is 
a former president of the American Women's Assn. She was born in Brownsville, 
Tex., but has lived in San Diego almost 73 years. 
</P>
<P>
"She's a nut and a crackup," Clingman said. "By the time most people turn 85, 
they're ready to give up the ghost, fold up their chairs and do nothing. But, 
my grandmother goes out to dinner and asks for a scotch on the rocks, has a 
good time and enjoys it."
