A new ordinance intended to prevent Coronado residents from storing 
recreational vehicles on city streets is so strict it requires police to 
impound big cars like Cadillacs and Lincolns, officials have found. The city 
law bars vehicles longer than 18 feet from parking on residential streets for 
more than three hours. City Council members passed the measure in response to 
numerous complaints about motor homes, considered a blight by many in this 
affluent town across the bay from San Diego. To show the city meant business, 
police have hauled off five RVs in the past month. Police Chief Jerry Boyd said 
that limousines "are longer than 18 feet, so I guess they are included in the 
ordinance."
