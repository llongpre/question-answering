On Monday, Jerome Price was an ineligible standout guard for University City 
High's boys' basketball team. He had participated in the Gus Macker 
three-on-three basketball tournament Jan. 28-29. 
</P>
<P>
To do so was a CIF no-no under Rule 600. Or was it? 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Superior Court Judge William C. Pate granted a temporary 
restraining order against the CIF until a hearing could determine if there was 
any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, La Jolla limited Price to 11 points and seven rebounds, and those 
were team highs as the Vikings downed University City, 69-44. 
</P>
<P>
The victory, coupled with Mission Bay's 57-51 loss to USDHS, gives La Jolla 
(15-8 overall, 7-2 in league play) a one-game lead with one game to play in the 
City Western League. Mission Bay (14-7, 6-3) is in second place. University 
City (15-9, 5-4) is in third. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla, assured of at least a tie for the title, can win it outright with a 
victory over last-place USDHS Friday. 
</P>
<P>
In lieu of complaining about the Price situation, La Jolla Coach Rick Eveleth 
said before the game, "We hope to play U.C. at full strength." 
</P>
<P>
They did, though it was the Vikings who were at full strength. All five 
starters had good games, led by senior guard Adam Kleid's 27 points. 
</P>
<P>
"He dictated the tempo," Eveleth said. "This is the finest game he's played all 
the way around for us." 
</P>
<P>
Erick Litch added 11 points and eight rebounds and David Berteaux 10 points. 
Kyle Kupiec had nine points and eight rebounds and sophomore forward Craig 
Woodall had eight points and a game-high 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
With Kleid scoring 15 points in the first half, La Jolla took a 30-23 lead. 
Price, who made the first basket of the game on a 17-foot jump shot, had just 
three points. 
</P>
<P>
In their first meeting Jan. 24, La Jolla had led the Centurions by 13 in the 
third quarter before losing in overtime. There would be no letdown Wednesday, 
however, as La Jolla dominated the second half, 39-21. 
</P>
<P>
After Price made two free throws with 3:04 left in the third quarter, La Jolla 
led, 40-33. The Vikings then went on a 17-2 run, including 12 in a row, to 
giving them a 57-35 lead.

Rancho Buena Vista 62, Escondido 55 -- Rancho Buena Vista Principal Alan 
Johnson, expecting problems, had said RBV would not play in this game after 
athletes from the two schools engaged in a melee following a wrestling match 
last Thursday at Escondido. But Johnson changed his mind before the game and 
Rancho Buena Vista (11-13, 7-6) won. The only problem came early in the fourth 
quarter when the lights in Escondido's gym went out for 15 minutes. Todd 
Fellars, who scored a game-high 31 points, hit a three-pointer to snap a 47-47 
tie just before the lights went out. Escondido, which never caught up after the 
lights came back on, got 27 points from Brooks Barnhard, but fell to 11-11,
