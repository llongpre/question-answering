DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR IN CORONADO BECOMES STYLISH 
ITALIAN RESTAURANT

The self-transformation of an old-fashioned neighborhood bar into a tony eatery 
isn't quite as surprising as would be, say, the sudden decision of a punk 
guitarist to devote his life to the study of Mozartian nuances, but it is 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
The Secret Harbor in Coronado for years was the kind of neighborhood place at 
which regulars traded tall tales over a couple of cold ones. But management 
switched off the neon beer signs at the beginning of the year and reopened in 
mid-summer as Primavera, an upscale, uptown kind of restaurant with a formal 
mood and an especially attractive decor. 
</P>
<P>
It is Italian, naturally -- most new restaurants seem to be Italian these days, 
and Coronado certainly was in need of a good one -- and the cooking generally 
ranges from satisfactory to rather nice. 
</P>
<P>
Primavera means springtime, but the word also connotes renewal, which neatly 
sums up the transformation of a clubby, casual hangout into an establishment 
with deep banquettes upholstered in floral print, a menu that includes bresaola 
and bagna cauda and a maitre d' who kisses women's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of dishes seems largely pan-Italian, with a certain degree of 
emphasis on preparations from the provinces of Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria 
-- which is to say, with great caution, that there is some Northern Italian 
cooking. The term is these days enormously overworked, misused and 
misunderstood, and applied scattershot by many of the restaurateurs who know 
that dishes specified as "Northern" have snob appeal. 
</P>
<P>
However, chef Luigi Tornatore (who cooked previously at Point Loma's unassuming 
but delightful Michelangelo), does come from the North, and his menu offers 
several good renditions of that region's specialties. 
</P>
<P>
One of the best of these is bagna cauda, or "hot bath," which is not mentioned 
by the menu but is available most days. Bagna cauda classically consists of 
olive oil and butter heated with anchovies and garlic, and is served as a 
fondue-like dip for bread and raw vegetables. Tornatore reverses the process by 
spooning a little of the mixture over a plate of grilled eggplant, slivered 
Parmesan and pungent sun-dried tomatoes, and the finished product ranks as a 
particularly elegant sort of antipasto. 
</P>
<P>
There is a similar elegance to the caprese al prosciutto, which dresses up the 
now-typical presentation of sliced tomatoes layered with fresh mozzarella and 
basil leaves by adding strips of delicate cured ham to the plate. The light 
drizzle of olive oil that moistens the arrangement adds a good bit of flavor. 
(A similar dish, in which red onion stands in for the prosciutto, is presented 
as a salad.) 
</P>
<P>
A third handsome appetizer, the bresaola con carciofini, pairs thin slices of 
the lovely, air-dried, cured beef called bresaola with baby artichokes, and it 
is indeed a luxurious combination. Other starters include the usual stuffed 
mushrooms and fried squid, and, less typically, a small filet of sole under a 
browned topping of Parmesan and white wine sauce. The minestrone seems done 
with a lighter hand than elsewhere, and the now almost ridiculously ubiquitous 
Caesar salad has a good, sharp bite to it. (The restaurant employs mustard in 
the dressing, which is against tradition and usually doesn't work, but the 
other ingredients are balanced around it and this is, in fact, an excellent 
salad.) 
</P>
<P>
The pasta list runs on rather enthusiastically with a roster of alternately 
creamy and pungent dishes, but pasta by and large does not seem the 
restaurant's strongest suit. The list begins, unsurprisingly, with fettuccine 
primavera, the classic tangle of ribbon noodles, assorted vegetables and light 
cream sauce. It then pauses at gnochetti (small dumplings) in a shrimp-flavored 
cream sauce before plunging into such rustic and theoretically robust offerings 
as the spicy penne alla puttanesca, the very pungent vermicelli aromatici (the 
sauce includes garlic, mixed herbs, capers and anchovies) and rigatoni al 
Gorgonzola, rich with the musty snap of that most regal, Italian blue cheese. 
</P>
<P>
The last two were sampled, and both seemed quite timid in their approach; the 
pasta used also was limp and flat-tasting, an unexpected circumstance in any 
Italian restaurant but especially in one of this pretension. More familiar 
choices include fettuccine alfredo, cannelloni, spinach lasagna and linguine in 
red and white clam sauces. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative to pasta, the menu offers a couple of risotti, the often 
elaborate rice stews that are, in fact, a trademark of some Northern Italian 
cooking, especially that of Milan. The risotto pescatore decorates the rice 
with a variety of shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
Both seafoods and meats are, by and large, sauteed in the particularly 
satisfactory Italian manner that finishes them with a syrupy sauce of reduced 
pan juices and wine thickened with a bit of butter. Choices include scampi 
Primavera, or shrimp and mushrooms in an herbed wine sauce; sea bass livornese, 
which spices the sauce with capers and black olives; and chicken breasts and 
veal scallops finished in the Marsala, con melanzane (with eggplant) and 
Valdostana treatments. The chicken Valdostana was done with particular 
delicacy; a boned, lightly pounded breast was stuffed with prosciutto, sliced 
mushrooms and creamy Fontina cheese, dipped in flour and beaten egg, gilded in 
butter and moistened with the lightest of pan sauces. 
</P>
<P>
The menu offers more steaks than usual -- perhaps because of the large number 
of conventioneers attracted by Coronado's resort hotels -- and dresses them 
variously with Cognac sauce, an herbal marinade and a topping of sauteed 
onions, mushrooms and peppers. The sole lamb listing, slices of herb-marinated 
loin, is grilled, and, although a portion sampled came off well enough, the 
advertised herbal flavor was disappointingly meek. 
</P>
<P>
A couple of daily specials usually complete the menu, but a highly touted 
lobster fra diavola was worth neither the kitchen's nor the diner's efforts, 
and it certainly was not worth the price. What should have been lobster cooked 
in a spicy tomato sauce was fresh lobster overcooked in a bland, chunky stew of 
tomatoes that had irritating bits of shell as one of its chief seasoners. This 
was served atop a great pile of overcooked, characterless fettuccine that 
should not have been allowed to pass through the kitchen door. 
</P>
<P>
The dessert tray also needs a little attention. Its chief attraction, 
tirami-su, is turning up at so many ambitious Italian restaurants these days 
that a few alternatives from the vast Italian repertoire might find a 
surprisingly warm welcome. It is, however, a nicely composed dish (the English 
would call it a pudding) of liqueur-soaked ladyfingers topped with a sweetened 
mascarpone cheese and a heavy dusting of powdered chocolate.
