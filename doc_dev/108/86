Southern California beaches attract all kinds of visitors during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
But this week, a special visitor from out of town -- way, way out of town -- 
paid a visit to the Silver Strand beach in Coronado. The appearance of a 
275-pound, 6-foot-long hooded seal -- member of a species that lives only along 
the coasts of Greenland and northern Canada -- has local marine scientists 
perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
Since Monday, Sea World officials have had their hands full with the uninvited 
guest, who snapped at its handlers and turned up its snout at first offerings 
of Sea World fare. 
</P>
<P>
The park officials could hardly turn it away, however, since it apparently swam 
8,000 to 12,000 miles before beaching itself. 
</P>
<P>
"How she got here boggles the mind," said Jim Antrim, Sea World's senior 
curator for marine mammals. "No one has ever heard of one being found on the 
West Coast of America." 
</P>
<P>
Hooded seals are distinguishable by their large size, unusual markings and, in 
males, bulbous noses that have a hooded shape and flare out when the animals 
are agitated, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the 3-year-old female seal has all the telltale characteristics, park 
officials could hardly believe their eyes when they responded to a telephone 
call after the animal was sighted by a passer-by around noon Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"I think she probably got here on her own," Antrim said. "The animal must have 
been exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the seal refused to eat and appeared to have some sort of infection. 
Since then, it has adjusted to life in California, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
"She seems to be in pretty good shape to be so far out of her range," Antrim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Hooded seals, once prized by hunters for their bluish coats, do have a history 
of wandering. Some have been sighted as far south as Florida and as far east as 
Portugal. Still, such trips are only 2,000 to 3,000 miles out of the animals' 
natural habitat, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
To reach the warm Pacific waters, this seal must have swum across the Arctic 
Ocean, through the Northwest Passage and through the Bering Strait, Antrim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that it swam through the Panama Canal," Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
The whole scenario sounded improbable to Gerald Kooyman, a research 
physiologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say that's impossible," Kooyman said when he heard about the park's 
visitor. "It's a remarkable occurrence. It's a surprise to me." 
</P>
<P>
Hooded seals are independent by nature, nursing for only four to seven days 
after birth, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
Brent Stewart, a staff scientist at the Sea World Research Institute, 
speculated that this seal may have forsaken its roots at a very early age. 
</P>
<P>
"This animal is still fairly young," Stewart said. "There's a tendency for 
young seals to wander. It may have been wandering for a couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists still don't fully understand why species of seals generally choose 
to stay in one particular area, Kooyman said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are no obvious barriers to them," Kooyman said. 
</P>
<P>
The seal could probably live just as happily in the 70-degree Pacific waters as 
its now-distant relatives do in 30-degree waters, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
At first, some officials speculated that the animal had been captured and 
released somewhere near the Coronado beach. But Antrim said the seal did not 
have any of the markings that are usually found on seals that have been 
transported in pools or cages. 
</P>
<P>
Also, the seal's initial refusal to eat dead fish and its hostility toward 
humans indicate that it probably had not dealt with people before, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
Where the seal's travels will take it next is unclear. Sea World officials plan 
to keep it for about two months to make sure it's in good health. Then the 
National Marine Fisheries Service will decide its fate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too early in the rehab process to make a decision," said Joe Cordaro, a 
wildlife biologist in the Los Angeles office of the Marine Fisheries Service. 
"We're still in shock that it happened, period." However, Cordaro said it 
seemed likely that federal officials would elect to relocate the seal somewhere 
in the waters around Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sea World handlers have given the adventurous hooded seal a name: 
Robin, after the swashbuckling vagabond from Nottingham Forest.
