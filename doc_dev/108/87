<HEADLINE>  LOS ALTOS HILLS HIRES MANAGER
'UNANIMOUS' CHOICE WILL START JUNE 17  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     He succeeds Thomas Frutchey, who became city manager of Campbell in
January. Since then, Richard DeLong, former city manager of San Mateo, has
been acting city manager.;    Jones will earn $72,000 a year, about the same
as Frutchey.;    "He was the unanimous and first choice right out of the box
for all five of us," Siegel said of Jones, who was interviewed along with
three other finalists from a field of 60 candidates.;    "The thing that
impressed me was the homework he had done about learning about Los Altos Hills
before the interview. He had spent about three days here. He had driven around
town, talked to a number of different people. He seemed to be so
well-acquainted with the issues in town.";    Sid Hubbard, mayor pro-tem,
described Jones as a "hands-on type of manager. He tends to be out in the
field. . . . He seems to be the type of guy who will roll up his sleeves and
get involved in solving the problem.";    Hubbard added that Jones appears to
be a "very good" communicator, does his homework and is "open and
approachable.";    In a telephone interview, Jones said, "I have nothing but
optimism" about the job.;    "It's a stable environment. It's a settled
community and I feel the relationship for the council will allow things to
continue on in a very stable fashion," he said.;    Some of the challenges
that Jones faces in running the government for the town's 7,500 residents
include: maintaining and improving the town's trail system, preserving the
rural-residential character of the town, reviewing long-term improvements for
the town's natural drainage system and maintaining budget reserves and the
town's financial well-being in anticipation of declining revenues because of
reduced construction fees.;    In his new position, Jones will be in charge of
running a city government of 12 employees and a $3.4 million budget.;    In
Coronado, where his department performs a variety of functions such as street
maintenance and recycling, he's in charge of 40 employees and a $3.5 million
budget.;    Jones has worked for the city of Coronado since 1983 when he was
named assistant to the city manager. He has held his present job since 1985.; 
  Jones, born and raised in Southern California, graduated from California
State University, Fullerton in 1976 with a bachelor of arts degree in public
administration.;    He and his wife, Jill, have two children, Anne, 7 1/2, and
Adam, 3 1/2.  </TEXT>
