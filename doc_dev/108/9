Coronado Mayor Mary Herron reacted coolly Tuesday to an idea by Imperial Beach 
Mayor Henry Smith that Coronado take over nearly bankrupt Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"It is time for us to seriously investigate our future options. One of the 
options is the city of Coronado," Smith said in a letter he read to the 
Coronado City Council. "All that I would like to do today is to begin the 
process of our staff looking at the city of Coronado and assessing whether it 
is a viable option to consider our consolidation with your city." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach officials have warned that the city will not be able to pay its 
bills in January, unless new revenue sources are found. To that end, a measure 
to raise $450,000 annually with a 5% tax on each utility bill was put to 
voters, but was defeated, Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
But even that wouldn't have guaranteed financial viability for the ailing beach 
town, Smith said, and officials would still seek to merge with Coronado. 
</P>
<P>
If Imperial Beach goes bankrupt, it might be forced to disincorporate, thereby 
coming under county control. Smith and the City Council have also discussed 
consolidating with San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Herron made it clear that Coronado officials are not enthusiastic 
about annexing Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
"We would feel very cautious," Herron said. "Coronado has worked long and hard 
to be where we are. It may be more of an undertaking than we can envision." 
</P>
<P>
Imperial Beach, a city of about 25,000 residents, is the only beach city in the 
county that has not developed its beachfront. Many of its residents are 
apartment dwellers, and it has a limited tax base. For almost a decade, the 
city was forced to dip into its reserves to continue providing services, and 
the reserve is now exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast, Coronado, with its upper-middle-class community, has long 
cherished its exclusiveness and is well-known for the many Navy admirals who 
have retired there. The average cost of a home is $406,000 in Coronado, which 
has a population of about 20,000; the average cost of a home is $174,000 in 
Imperial Beach. The two cities are joined by the Silver Strand. 
</P>
<P>
Herron expressed concern that Coronado's resources would be strained if it were 
required to provide services such as police and fire protection to Imperial 
Beach, which is served by the sheriff and has a tiny fire department. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what the outcome will be. But no mayor will want to be faced with 
the condition you find yourself in," Herron said to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
Although Smith requested that Herron allow Coronado's city manager to meet with 
Imperial Beach's city manager to discuss the proposed merger, Herron did not 
make a commitment to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not going to jump into this, are they? All I ask for is exactly what 
the letter said," Smith said after his brief appearance before the Coronado 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Times last month, Coronado City Manager Homer Bludau 
said there is no incentive for Coronado to consolidate with Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego City Manager John Lockwood said that San Diego city officials would 
be willing to discuss consolidation with Imperial Beach, but he added that 
there were no immediate plans by San Diego to annex Imperial Beach. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County Supervisor Brian Bilbray has argued that the best alternative 
available to Imperial Beach is to consolidate with the county. Bilbray, a 
former Imperial Beach mayor, said the county would become Imperial Beach's 
trustee for three years, then voters would have an opportunity to vote on 
incorporation again. 
</P>
<P>
However, Smith and the majority of the Imperial Beach City Council favor 
consolidating with either Coronado or San Diego.
