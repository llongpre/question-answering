   Hundreds of U.S. and Mexican firefighters
on Sunday battled fires that burned thousands of acres of brush and
timber on both sides of the border and raced across an Apache
Indian reservation, officials said.
   A forest fire that started in Mexico charred 6,000 acres, about
3,500 on the U.S. side of the border near Nicksville, and damaged
two structures in a park picnic area, said U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Jim Payne in Phoenix.
   The blaze, which Payne called ``a raging monster out of
control,'' also had threatened ranch homes in the Coronado National
Monument, about 50 miles south of Tucson, before they were saved by
crews who started backfires.
   Nearly 200 miles north, a second fire that was sparked by
lightning Friday in logging slash on a reservation near Cibecue had
covered more than 500 acres of timber and brush by early Sunday,
Payne said.
   South of the border, the largest fire _ more than 10,000 acres _
had been burning for more than a week in the Sierra Pinta Mountains
of Mexico's Sonora state, Payne said. Four U.S. forest officials
crossed the border to serve as advisers in fighting the blaze.
   The fire near Nicksville was burning mostly on state and federal
land in the national monument and the Coronado National Forest at
elevations above 7,000 feet, he said. Authorities were unsure what
started the blaze.
   The blaze damaged a restroom and a ramada, the Western version
of a gazebo, in a picnic area within the national monument area,
Payne said.
   About 300 firefighters battled the blaze on the U.S. side
Saturday, said Coronado National Forest spokesman Dennis
Brandolino, but another 500 to 700 firefighters were expected
Sunday from New Mexico, Idaho and nearby states. Mexican
firefighters were battling the flames on their side of the border.
   Three planes made a dozen runs to drop about 30,000 gallons of
fire retardant on the border blaze, said Joe Perea, the fire's
air-service coordinator from Moutainair, N.M.
   Intermittent high winds whipped the Cibecue fire, where about
280 firefighters were on the line Saturday night, said
Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest spokesman Ken Palmrose.
   The blaze at the 6,000-foot level was burning ``heavy pine, fir
and some (scrub) oak in the canyon bottoms,'' eating away at
chaparral and other types of brush on the ridges, Palmrose said.
   The fire was being managed by an ``interagency overhead team''
with representatives from the federal Forest and Park services and
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, with consultation from the White
River Apache Tribe, Palmrose said.
