SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: THERE'S NO PRIVACY IN WORLD OF ADVERTISING

The medium is the message. Or: Advertising at your convenience. 
</P>
<P>
Think of it. A captive audience. Attention focused straight ahead. Eager for 
reading material. 
</P>
<P>
A perfect way to hit your target (audience). A wonderful chance to expose your 
client. 
</P>
<P>
It's here: eye-level advertising at urinals, and on the inside of toilet-stall 
doors. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell Media Inc., a new ad agency in Mira Mesa, is trying to tap the 
heretofore untapped water closet market. 
</P>
<P>
It's called "Stall Tactics." You peddle while they piddle. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a natural place for advertising," explained co-owner Sandra Maxwell. "You 
can count on having people's attention anywhere from 10 seconds to a minute. 
You can do a lot of selling in that time." 
</P>
<P>
This being San Diego County, naturally, the desired market is the upscale, 
car-buying, real-estate-buying, gadget-buying crowd, male and female. 
</P>
<P>
The trick is to match the right product with the right lookie-loo. 
</P>
<P>
It's called selective demographics. Restaurants and nightspots are the 
locations of choice. 
</P>
<P>
Thusly, beach apparel/surf gear at Club Diego in Pacific Beach, a Lexus car 
dealership at Paparazzi in La Jolla, cellular phones at Epazote's in Del Mar, a 
foreign car repair shop at the Triton in Cardiff. 
</P>
<P>
Also, spread out in North County: Samsonite, Merrill Lynch, Dow Corning and 
Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
(All you wise guys can forget it. There are no plans to put bail bond ads in 
biker bars or rolling paper ads in reggae hangouts.) 
</P>
<P>
The ads are a Midwestern idea (Maxwell and her husband, Tom, are from 
Minneapolis) that has only recently migrated to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The ads are letter size (8 1/2-by-11), full-color and sealed behind glass. Four 
to six ads per space; market surveys say the more ads, the more likely that 
people will retain the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
Word of the restroom ads was relayed by a tipster who saw them at Cilantro's in 
Rancho Santa Fe. 
</P>
<P>
A real stand-up guy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Gone, Like the Old West 
</P>
<P>
Mobley Meadows Milam is looking for a few good guns: family six-shooters stolen 
from his Sunset Cliffs home in a recent burglary. 
</P>
<P>
The 66-year-old attorney and former federal prosecutor hopes a pawnbroker or 
swap meet devotee will notice the historic pieces: a Civil War-era Remington 
(serial No. 86543) and a turn-of-the-century Smith &amp; Wesson (serial No. 
B-178470). 
</P>
<P>
The Remington was owned by Milam's great-grandfather John Meadows (1828-1882), 
teacher, preacher, wagon-trail boss and sheriff of Tulare County. 
</P>
<P>
The Smith &amp; Wesson belonged to Milam's grandfather Mobley Meadows 
(1875-1915), the legendary sheriff of Imperial County whose statue still graces 
the county fairgrounds outside El Centro. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably get around $1,000 from the insurance company, but I'd much 
rather have the guns back," Milam said. 
</P>
<P>
Luckily, the thief missed some heirlooms. Like the (supposed) scalp of the 
Indian who killed John Meadows in the Arizona uprising known as Meadows' 
Massacre. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank God the burglar didn't get that," Milam said. 
</P>
<P>
I went out to take a look. He wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Betting Everything to Win 
</P>
<P>
Words, words, words. 
</P>
<P>
* How eager are the Japanese to win the America's Cup? 
</P>
<P>
Banner at the base camp in Tokyo of Nippon, the 12-meter yacht that 30 Japanese 
companies are preparing for the 1992 race off San Diego: "There Is No Second." 
</P>
<P>
* North County bumper sticker: "I'm a Lover, Fighter and Wild Bull Rider." 
</P>
<P>
* Headline in the San Francisco Chronicle assessing Pete Wilson's image 
problem: "Not Just a Bland White Guy." 
</P>
<P>
* The first Coronado Eagle, a new twice-monthly newspaper, hits the stands 
today. It's the work of Dean Eckenroth, former publisher of the Coronado 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
* Pacific Beach dude to tourist girl: "Texas? I've never been back East."
