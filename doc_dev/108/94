   Despite her
fear of flying, Pearl Bailey is riding helicopters and small
aircraft this week in a visit to the U.S. Navy in the gulf.
   It's not a new experience for the 70-year-old singer, who
recalls doing her first show for servicemen in 1941, and has been
among the professional entertainers on the United Service
Organizations _ better known as the USO _ circuit ever since.
   ``The reason I do it is simple,'' she said. ``I tell 'em that
nobody promised them the bright lights of Broadway out here, but
one thing we did promise them is that we wouldn't forget them _ and
that's why I'm here.''
   Miss Bailey and a five-member band headed by her husband, jazz
drummer Louie Bellson, performed Sunday and Monday for audiences
aboard the Coronado, the flagship of the Navy's 27-ship regional
task force.
   Earlier, they performed aboard the aircraft carrier Carl M.
Vinson and the submarine tender Emory S. Land in the Arabian Sea.
   Miss Bailey, who starred in a Broadway production of ``Hello,
Dolly'' in the 1960s, conceded that most of the sailors, whose
average age is about 23, have only a vague idea of who she is.
   But she won a standing ovation for her show, which featured
``Chicago'' and ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' a song that
she said ``a voice told me to sing in every show I ever do.''
   Afterward, despite the debilitating heat and an inflamed knee,
she signed autographs for more than an hour.
   ``Most of them didn't know who she was, but now they do,'' said
Marcus Hutchins, a sailor from East Orange, N.J. ``It was a great
show. It's wonderful that she'd come out to the gulf and share her
love for us.''
   Men from the missile cruiser Halsey, moored alongside the
Coronado, the missile frigate Vandegrift and several U.S. mine
sweepers also were present.
   For Monday's second performance, her last before returning home,
the Navy invited officers and crew from two British ships, the
frigate Southampton and the mine sweeper Middleton.
   In addition to performing, Miss Bailey is a member of the U.S.
delegation to the U.N. General Assembly. Her USO tour, originally
scheduled for June, was postponed after a U.S. warship hit a mine.
   Miss Bailey said the USO, funded by contributions from
foundations, corporations and other private sources, involves many
visits to military hospitals as well as performing.
   Although the pace is grueling, she said more professional
entertainers should visit what she called ``the far corners, the
woods and places.''
   She said she fears flying so much that at home, she either
drives cross-country or takes Amtrak trains.
   ``A lot of people are gonna ask, `How did the Amtrak girl get
out there?' Well, I'm good, but I don't walk on water.''
