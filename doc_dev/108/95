   A government committee suggested renaming
Luling's Old Spanish Trail ``Catfish Street,'' but the new name
didn't smell quite right to folks around here.
   ``You should have seen the faces drop when I announced it would
be Catfish Street,'' said Pastor Robert Zehr of the Mennonite
church established 53 years ago in this town nearly 15 miles west
of New Orleans.
   Zehr said his congregation was appalled at the prospect, even if
their street would be named for one of Louisiana's most famous
exports. Old Spanish Trail has a solid, dignified ring to it, and
the church is proud to have that address, the minister said.
   The committee has been working to eliminate a multitude of St.
Charles Parish streets with identical or similar names.
   There are seven First Streets around the parish, and Luling
alone has Oak Lane, Oak Place and Oak Avenue. Old Spanish Trail,
one of many roads around the state recalling the days of Spanish
rule, runs about eight miles from Boutte to Des Allemands.
   The committee has had other problems doing its job.
   In Luling, a street named for conquistador Hernando Cortez in
the Coronado Park subdivision had to be renamed because Des
Allemands has a Cortez Lane. The committee suggested Magellan to go
along with Balboa, Coronado and DeSoto.
   No good.
   ``We wanted to stay with the Spanish names,'' said Ken Riggin of
the Coronado Civic Association. ``Magellan was not actually
Spanish. He was contracted by the Spanish, but he was Portuguese.''
   The committee settled on Pizarro.

   The name Leinenkugel might cause some beer
drinkers to raise their eyebrows sooner than their mugs, but Miller
Brewing Co. hopes the brand with a cult following in the upper
Midwest can do the same elsewhere.
   Miller last year bought the Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co., a
small, family-run brewery for more than a century in Chippewa
Falls, Wis.
   The nation's No. 2 brewer, behind Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., is
using its muscle to test the brand in Seattle and western
Massachusetts.
   The test started earlier this year comes at a flat time in the
domestic beer market, with companies trying more experiments to
gain a bigger share.
   ``Miller really knows how to introduce new products,'' said
Robert Weinberg, a beer analyst and a professor of marketing
management at Washington University in St. Louis.
   According to industry estimates, Leinenkugel sold nearly 100,000
barrels last year, compared with national brands that sell in the
millions.
   ``If the Leinenkugel brand tickles people, either because of the
name or the taste, Miller could take it national overnight,''
Weinberg said.
   Jake Leinenkugel, who remained an executive at the brewery after
the buyout, said Miller is trying to take a low-key approach in
promoting the beer.
   ``We want to go in a little mysterious, a little quiet,''
Leinenkugel said. ``We don't want to go in with a heavy media
campaign. We want it to be discovered.''
