   Iranian commercial planes often fly into battle
areas in the Persian Gulf, putting their passengers at risk because
the aircraft are not easily identifiable by U.S. ships and
aircraft, a naval officer said.
   Rear Adm. R.G. Zeller, commander of training for the U.S.
Pacific Fleet, returned Sunday after a six-month tour in the
war-torn region, where he says civilian aircraft often fly the same
path as military planes.
   ``An Iranian F-4 (a U.S.-made Phantom fighter) would take off
from Bandar Abbas and right behind it is a commercial aircraft,''
Zeller said Sunday. ``They would both take roughly the same route
for awhile.
   ``Initially it's very difficult to distinguish between the two.
We had to be awfully careful for obvious reasons.''
   Zeller commanded the warship force that launched retaliatory
strikes against two military-manned Iranian sea platforms April 18,
four days after the U.S. destroyer Roberts was damaged seriously in
a Persian Gulf mine attack.
   The Airbus shot down Sunday departed from Bandar Abbas, Iran. It
is believed that all 290 people on board the commercial jet died in
the attack by the San Diego-based USS Vincennes.
   U.S. officials said the plane was outside civilian aviation
corridors, a claim military and aviation officials in Iran denied.
   Of the attack, Zeller said, ``Frankly, I don't know what to
think. Vincennes Capt.) Will Rogers is close personal friend and
has been for 20 years.''
   Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Rogers had sufficient reasons to believe the cruiser was in
jeopardy and fired justifiably in self-defense.
   Asked if the attack on a civilian airliner would make ships
hesitant to fire on approaching planes in the future, Zeller, a
28-year Navy veteran, said: ``You know as well as I do it will.''
   The ranking officers of the USS frigate Stark were reprimanded
after 37 sailors died when the ship was hit by a missile fired from
an Iraqi warplane on May 17, 1987. U.S. Rep. Bill Lowery, R-Calif.,
said it was doubtful Rogers would face a similar fate.
   ``This was a tragic, tragic mistake, but one that I believe the
skipper followed proper procedures in protecting the ship and
crew,'' Lowery said.
   Rogers called a senior Navy chaplain in Coronado on Sunday night
to assure wives and family members of the crew's safety.
   ``He said all hands are safe and to please put the word out to
the families,'' said Capt. Theodore Atwood of the Pacific Fleet
Surface Force headquarters in Coronado.
   ``The wives are relieved that their husbands are safe,'' the
chaplain said. ``Now we have to look for another side of this, the
emotional side. It can have a very sobering effect.''
   Rogers, whose wife, Sharon, and son, Will Rogers IV, live in San
Diego, is not related to the late American humorist, Will Rogers,
according to the humorist's son, Will Rogers Jr.
