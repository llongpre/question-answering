The United States, considered a favorite to qualify for its first World Cup in 
39 years, lost to Costa Rica, 1-0, Sunday in its opening match of final-round 
qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
Forward Gilberto Rhoden scored the game's only goal at 15 minutes of the first 
half. Rhoden deflected a wide shot by teammate Evaristo Coronado into the net. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, eliminated by Costa Rica in 1986 World Cup qualifying, plays 
host to the Costa Ricans April 30 at Fenton, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
The United States' best chance to tie came with nine minutes remaining in the 
first half, but Costa Rican goalkeeper Luis Gabelo Conejo lunged high to his 
right to make the save. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado, who drew a yellow card for rough play, now has two yellow cards in 
World Cup qualifying. He received an automatic suspension from the April 30 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very tough game," Rhoden said. "But we prepared ourselves mentally 
and things came out really well." 
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica leads the group with a 2-1 record and four points. Guatemala is 1-1 
with two points. El Salvador and Trinidad-Tobago have not played yet in the 
five country round-robin qualifying. The top two teams make the 24-nation 
finals in Italy in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The United States was rated the favorite after Mexico and Canada were 
eliminated. Guatemala beat Canada last fall and Mexico was expelled after using 
over-age players in qualifying for the world under-20 championship.
