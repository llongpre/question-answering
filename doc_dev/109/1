   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan was listed
in serious condition this morning, recovering from a near drowning
in her backyard pool, and a doctor says she could be out of the
hospital within a week.
   ``Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get
totally back to normal,'' said Dr. James Little, a neurologist.
``She's very close to normal right now. I think she will continue
to improve. As best as I can tell right now, she probably will
regain full mental functions.''
   Ms. Jordan's condition was upgraded Sunday afternoon from
critical to serious but stable, and she continued to improve Sunday
night.
   ``She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her
own. She is receiving supplemental oxygen, though,'' hospital
spokeswoman Kari Larsen said.
   Ms. Jordan, 52, gave the thumbs-up sign Sunday to her intensive
care unit nurse and was able to talk.
   ``She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get
well,'' said Dr. William J. Deaton, a pulmonary specialist.
   ``She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of
the time, knowing what she's been through and how close she came to
a real catastrophic event. But she still also has her jovial
personality. She was joking a little bit this morning,'' Deaton
said Sunday. ``She is vastly improved.''
   Ms. Jordan, who gained national attention during the 1974
Watergate impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter
to Brackenridge Hospital on Saturday after being found floating
face-down in her pool.
   Ms. Jordan's live-in companion, Nancy Earl, called paramedics,
who restored her pulse and breathing.
   Deaton said she came ``within four to five minutes, 10 minutes
at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death.
   ``She does not know what happened and was clearly concerned
about it and had indicated that she didn't think she would go
swimming alone again,'' Deaton said.
   Ms. Jordan was breathing Saturday night only with the help of a
ventilator, but Sunday the device was gone and she was responding
to questions and talking, doctors said.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice presidential candidate,
telephoned a message for Ms. Jordan, hospital spokeswoman Carolyn
Hinckley Boyle said. Ms. Jordan made a seconding speech for
Bentsen's nomination at the recent Democratic National Convention.
   Doctors said it isn't known what caused Ms. Jordan to lose
consciousness in the pool, but the lack of oxygen caused cardiac
arrest.
   Deaton said he expected Ms. Jordan to remain in intensive care
for 48 hours and to be hospitalized for about a week.
   The doctors said Ms. Jordan, who has been confined to a
wheelchair for several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis. She
swims as therapy.
   ``She has muscle weakness, and it would be difficult for her to
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any
event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event,
that she had any warning,'' Deaton said.
   Doctors were uncertain how long she was in the pool before being
discovered. Ms. Earl said she returned from a short errand to find
Ms. Jordan unconscious in the pool.
   Ms. Jordan in 1966 became the first black state senator in Texas
history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to
Congress since Reconstruction, serving until 1978, when she left
politics after three terms in the House to teach at the University
of Texas.
