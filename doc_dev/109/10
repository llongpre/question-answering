<HEAD>Conventioneering On $25 A Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Critics who accuse the Democrats of being big
spenders might talk to 22-year-old Marc Homer, an alternate Wyoming
delegate to the Democratic National Convention.
   Homer managed to attend the four-day convention on less than $25
dollars a day.
   ``I rode the bus out here and am staying in a dorm room at
Georgia Tech for $15 a night,'' he said Thursday. The 44-hour bus
ride cost $69 and he will spend the same amount on a circuitous
route home.
   ``I haven't had to spend anything hardly on food,'' he added.
``There are so many parties with free food.''

<HEAD>Jordan Says Bentsen Is No ``Tory Democrat''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>

   Barbara Jordan helped came to the aid of fellow
Texan Lloyd Bentsen by dismissing suggestions the senator is a
conservative and weak on civil rights.
   In a speech seconding Bentsen's vice presidential nomination,
the black former congresswoman described him as an ally of ``our
most vulnerable citizens'' and a ``common-sense good candidate.''
   Delegates on Thursday cheered and chanted ``Barbara, Barbara''
as Ms. Jordan was wheeled to the podium for her speech. She is
confined to a wheelchair because of a degenerative bone disease.

<HEAD>Rostenkowski Says Bentsen Can Win Back Reagan Democrats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski says the Democrats in his
northwest Chicago district who supported President Reagan in 1984
can return to their party now that Lloyd Bentsen is on the ticket.
   Rostenkowski said in his speech nominating the Texas senator
that his district houses people who ``run our stores, work in our
factories, teach our children, drive our buses and protect our
neighborhoods.''
   ``Lloyd Bentsen knows these people and has fought for these
people,'' he said, calling on them to return to the Democratic
fold. ``Come on home where you belong.''

<HEAD>Republicans Boast Lots Of Space For Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican officials boast they will do
better than the Democrats and have seats to spare when the GOP
holds its national convention next month in the spacious Louisiana
Superdome,
   Democrats held their convention this week in Atlanta at The
Omni, which could hold only about 11,000 people. More than 14,000
people attended the four-day convention, and the coliseum had to be
closed off several nights.
   The Superdome will have room for an estimated 40,000 people when
the Republicans assemble Aug. 15-18. Nadine Wong, a convention
management spokeswoman, said she expects about 30,000 people to
attend the four-day event, and some of the space may be made
available to the general public.

   Democratic Party Secretary Dorothy Bush has been
calling the roll of the states at party conventions since 1944 and

video tribute that showed scenes from past conventions, and
magazine accounts of the striking young woman who created a stir
when she broke into the male-dominated political world.
   She is not related to Vice President George Bush.
