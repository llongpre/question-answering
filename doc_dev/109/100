<TEXT>
<P>
During his 16 years as a Des Moines police officer, Tom Van Baale has put his 
life on the line for strangers many times. On Monday, he is taking a risk for a 
loved one: He is leaving for Iraq in hope of persuading President Saddam 
Hussein to release his father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
Dawn Bazner, of Palm Desert, Calif., also is keenly aware of the perils of 
entering a potential war zone where her husband is being held hostage. "But if 
I don't go, and some of the women come back with their husbands, I don't know 
if I can live with the consequences of that decision," she says. 
</P>
<P>
The two are part of a delegation of 14 relatives of American hostages in Iraq 
who are accepting Hussein's invitation to visit their loved ones over the 
holidays. A second contingent of 30 relatives is poised to depart Dec. 19. 
Several dozen others may go later. 
</P>
<P>
For the family members, the visit is a life-or-death mission. "If I don't go, I 
may never see my husband again," Bazner says. 
</P>
<P>
Heart-rending as they may be, such ventures pose a serious problem for the Bush 
Administration. It regards the hostage family visits as counter to the national 
interest, yet it is reluctant to be too critical for fear that the issue could 
backfire on the White House. 
</P>
<P>
The Administration repeatedly has said that travel to Baghdad can be dangerous 
and that family members who go are being manipulated by Hussein, whose 
occasional releases of hostages are seen as blatant attempts to divide the 
international alliance against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
A senior State Department official declined to comment on Monday's trip, 
saying, "We don't want to come across as being adversarial against any U.S. 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
But as more and more relatives prepare to ignore stated U.S. policy in an 
effort to save their loved ones, their increasing visibility could well make 
them a force to be reckoned with as the public debate escalates over President 
Bush's Persian Gulf policies. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not real happy with our government -- they're not doing anything to get 
our people out," says Willie Carr, 47, a Richland Hills, Tex., woman who was 
taken captive with her husband, Gary, when they were in northern Kuwait, where 
he was working on an oil rig. 
</P>
<P>
Like many foreign women and children in Iraq, Carr eventually was allowed to 
leave, but her husband is still a hostage of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
"The State Department should be glad we're getting some of them out," fumes one 
hostage's wife who asks that she not be identified. "It's just less for them to 
have to worry about." 
</P>
<P>
For many of the relatives, the decision to defy their own government was not 
made lightly. "Initially, my reaction was no, I would not go," says Bazner, 37. 
"But emissaries from most other countries have gone and have gotten people out. 
And I'd like to have my husband home and be with our children again. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I genuinely believe that going is the right thing to do," she says. "My 
husband's fully aware that his own government is not going to negotiate, and he 
accepts that as par for the course. And so if that means I have to go to 
Baghdad as my own peace emissary, then I will." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, not all the hostages have concurred with their relatives' decisions 
to go to Baghdad. "My husband is not too happy about my going," says one woman 
who asked that her name not be printed. "He's scared to death. They (the 
Iraqis) are so unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
At first, the woman went along with her husband's wishes, but eventually she 
decided to go to Baghdad despite his reservations. "This has been a very 
traumatic experience," she says. "It feels like you're grieving, but yet 
there's no death. You don't know quite how to act." 
</P>
<P>
For all the flurry about how many hostages Iraq has released during the last 
few weeks, hundreds of foreigners -- including more than 100 Americans -- are 
still being held as so-called human shields at strategic sites. Hussein says he 
is holding them to discourage attack by U.S.-led forces. As many as 2,000 more 
foreigners are believed to be trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, forbidden to leave. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Bazner, 36, is being held at a military site. Like many other hostages, 
he has been allowed to call home with increasing frequency -- in his case to 
Palm Desert, where his parents have a house where his wife and children have 
been staying. 
</P>
<P>
The Bazners' own home is in Kuala Lumpur, where he is a restaurant executive. 
They and their two children were taken hostage Aug. 2, the day that Iraq 
invaded Kuwait, when the jetliner they were on stopped to refuel in Kuwait. She 
and the children left in a refugee airlift in September. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Barbara Smiley is more optimistic than worried. "I feel really 
positive about this trip," she says. "Good things have been happening, and we 
all hope more good things will happen when we get there." 
</P>
<P>
Edward Smiley, 42, arrived in Kuwait to begin a yearlong job as a database 
administrator just three days before the invasion. Since he was taken hostage, 
he has called his wife half a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
"Edward is looking forward to my going very much," Barbara Smiley says. "He 
seems to be very positive. He said, 'I'm not gonna get my hopes up too much.' 
But he's been given these little hints that, because we are going, perhaps 
something may happen." 
</P>
<P>
At Thanksgiving Day dinner, the extended Smiley family saw Edward Smiley on 
television. "He looked thin and grayer -- and he's got a beard," his wife says. 
The worry and uncertainty of the last four months "have been like an empty hole 
in my stomach." 
</P>
<P>
As with nearly all the hostage families, the financial hardships brought on by 
the crisis are becoming increasingly pressing. 
</P>
<P>
But Smiley has been more fortunate than some others. The Kuwaiti government 
sent her husband's monthly paycheck, and their bank here in the United States 
has put a three-month hold on their mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Barbara Smiley still has had to buy health and car insurance, pay real 
estate taxes and, above all, huge monthly telephone bills. "On top of that," 
she points out, "this trip doesn't come cheap." 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has said it will furnish the hostages' relatives with room 
and board in Baghdad and will provide free, round-trip air transportation 
between Amman, Jordan, and Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the relatives -- who live in such diverse places as California, Florida, 
Idaho and Texas -- have to pay their own way to Jordan and back. 
</P>
<P>
"This thing has really had an impact on our savings," says Van Baale, who is a 
police sergeant. Earlier in the fall, Van Baale traveled to Washington to 
present a petition to the Iraqi Embassy calling for the release of his 
father-in-law -- to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a real financial burden," he says. 
</P>
<P>
As she prepared late last week to travel from Texas to New York, Willie Carr 
also was optimistic: "They said if we come in peace, not bearing arms, we will 
not leave empty-handed," she said. "And I believe them. I'm reading into that 
what I want to." 
</P>
<P>
And Barbara Smiley is unrepentant, saying, "If propaganda is what Saddam is 
getting out of it, fine -- if that's what it takes."
