   Pop diva Madonna was ordered by a judge
Thursday to trim a hedge and pine tree at her Hollywood Hills home.
   Superior Court Judge Sally Disco ruled Madonna violated an
agreement with neighbor Donald Robinson requiring her to keep her
shrubbery trimmed so it wouldn't interfere with his view.
   The judge rejected Robinson's claim of $1 million damages for
the loss of his view, but she ordered Madonna to pay Robinson's
attorney fees.
   Liz Rosenberg, publicist for the singer, was out of the office
Thursday and couldn't be reached, a receptionist said. Madonna's
lawyer, Meghan Serwin, and Robinson's attorney, Robert Rigdon, were
not in their offices Thursday for comment.
   Madonna said in a deposition she bought the house above the
Sunset Strip because of its spectacular view and privacy. But after
she moved in, she said she noticed gardeners peering through her
hedges.
   Disco ruled there was insufficient evidence to support Madonna's
cross-claim against Robinson that said he had harmed her by
infringing on her privacy.

   SEVIERVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Dolly Parton's younger sister has
filed a worker's compensation lawsuit against the theme park the
entertainer owns.
   Freida Parton, 33, said she injured her back closing a dressing
room door at Dollywood, in the foothills of the Smoky Mountains.
   In the lawsuit filed this week in Sevier County Chancery Court,
Freida Parton says she sustained the injury on June 10, 1989, and
underwent back surgery.
   She seeks unspecified benefits under the state's worker's
compensation act.
   Barbara Headla, marketing manager at Dollywood, did not return a
telephone message left at the park.
   Freida Parton and her twin brother, Floyd, are the
next-to-youngest of the 12 Parton siblings.
   Dolly Parton opened Dollywood in 1985. She co-starred in ``Steel
Magnolias'' last year and was host of 1987's short-lived variety
television series ``Dolly.''

   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Former congresswoman Barbara Jordan has
agreed to serve as special counsel on ethics for Gov.-elect Ann
Richards.
   ``Barbara Jordan is recognized throughout the country as one of
the most important voices in ethics and government that one could
possibly have,'' Richards said Wednesday.
   In 1966, Jordan became the state's first black state senator. In
1972, she was the first black elected to Congress from the South
since Reconstruction.
   Once considered a possible Democratic vice presidential
candidate, Jordan ended her political career after three terms in
the House. She became a professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs at the University of Texss.
   Richards said Jordan would counsel members of her administration
on ethical conduct and help draft legislation on ethics.
   Bill Cryer, Richards' press secretary, said Jordan was taking
the post on ``an unpaid, voluntary basis'' and would continue
teaching.

   LONDON (AP) - Dame Joan Sutherland is coming out of retirement
after just two months, but for only one performance: a New Year's
Eve farewell to Covent Garden, the Royal Opera House said Thursday.
   Sutherland, the coloratura soprano with amazing voice range,
will be joined by Italian tenor Luciano Pavarotti and U.S.
mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne.
   ``Although Dame Joan has retired, she wants to make this one -
and only one - exception, to come to London to say goodbye to
Covent Garden where she began her opera career in 1952,'' said
Kathleen Wilkinson, the Royal Opera spokeswoman.
   Sutherland, 64, will play the ``star guest'' at Prince
Orlofsky's party in Act II of ``Die Fledermaus'' by Johann Strauss.
The opera will be conducted by her husband, Richard Bonynge and
will be televised live by the British Broadcasting Corp.
   Pavarotti and Horne will appear as fellow party guests.
   Sutherland, known as ``La Stupenda'' (the magnificent one),
retired Oct. 2 with a performance in her hometown of Sydney,
Australia.
   In October, Sutherland withdrew from performances at Covent
Garden, saying she wanted people to remember her voice in its
prime.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Beach Boys' reclusive founder Brian Wilson
made a private concert appearance before a group that included
political cartoonist Garry Trudeau as the two joined in an AIDS
fund-raising effort.
   Looking uncomfortable in a dark suit and tie, a nervous Wilson
played piano and sang Wednesday at the private reception. A few
dozen patrons paid at least $125 each for the 15-minute
performance.
   ``I enjoyed it,'' Wilson said after the performance. ``I had to
close my eyes. That's the only way I can really feel my music,
closing my eyes.''
   Wilson had said before the show that he was ``scared to death.''
   Trudeau, creator of the comic strip ``Doonesbury,'' sat
cross-legged on the floor during the concert.
   Among other tunes, Wilson played selections from the Beach Boys'
1966 ``Pet Sounds'' album, which recently came out on compact disc.
Andy Lippincott, a character in ``Doonesbury'' who died from AIDS,
had looked forward to the disc's release.
   Before the reception, Wilson and Trudeau attended the opening of
an art galley with 59 original drawings of editions of the comic
strip that dealt with Lippincott's death.
   The drawings are being sold to raise money for the NAMES
Project, which is coordinating the construction of a huge memorial
quilt dedicated to AIDS victims.
