   Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis named a dozen
prominent Democrats as co-chairmen of his presidential campaign
Saturday to serve as strategy advisers and surrogates on the
campaign trail.
   Dukakis called them ``12 of the finest leaders or our party, 12
of the finest leaders of our country.''
   The group includes four senators, two House members, a former
congresswoman, three governors, a mayor and Iowa's secretary of
state.
   ``I'm proud to enter the final eight weeks of this campaign with
a distinguished running mate in Lloyd Bentsen and our 12
distinguished co-chairs,'' the Massachusetts governor told
reporters. ``These co-chairs represent a cross section of the
Democratic Party and a cross section of America.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen and I welcome their advice on policy and
strategy and we will be proud to have them representing us in our
campaign all across this country,'' he said.
   Named were Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Sam Nunn of
Georgia, John Glenn of Ohio and Barbara Mikulski of Maryland; Reps.
Norman Y. Mineta of California and Bill Richardson of New Mexico,
and former Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas.
   Also Govs. Mario Cuomo of New York, Bill Clinton of Arkansas and
Madeleine Kunin of Vermont; Mayor Richard Arrington of Birmingham,
Ala., and Iowa Secretary of State Elaine Baxter.
