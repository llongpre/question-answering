   For once, a really towering Democrat _ not the
towering kind evoked in political rhetoric _ addressed the
Democratic National Convention.
   Bill Bradley, the senator from New Jersey who once played on two
world champion New York Knicks basketball teams, got the kind of
reception from convention delegates that marks him as a political
comer.
   The hall blossomed with orange and blue signs, not for Michael
Dukakis or Jesse Jackson, but for ``Bill Bradley, New Jersey's
pride.''
   At 6-foot-5, Bradley was too tall to use the prompting devices
on either side of the podium, so his speech was scrolled up on a
television screen across the hall.
   ``This is a real first for me tonight,'' he said. ``It's the
first time I've spoken to a national convention and the first time
I've performed in The Omni wearing long pants.''
   The convention hall normally is used for Atlanta Hawks games.
   Bradley made everybody's list of vice presidential possibilities
early in the Democratic campaign, but he took himself out of
consideration last month.
   ``Does it make any difference who is president of the United
States?'' he asked.
   ``Did Lincoln make a difference? Did Woodrow Wilson ... Ask
anyone who lived through the depression if Franklin Delano
Roosevelt made a difference. Ask any European who has democracy if
Harry Truman made any difference. Ask anyone who cares about human
rights if Jimmy Carter made a difference.''
   By the time Bradley took the microphone, before Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen's name was put in nomination for the vice presidency, the
convention hall was filled to overflowing.
   The delegates let loose with some of the most enthusiastic
cheering of the night when former Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas, a
heroine of Democrats since the Watergate days of Richard Nixon,
seconded Bentsen's nomination.
   ``Why?'' she asked. ``First of all because he's my senator and I
wasn't planning to come to this convention for any purpose'' other
than that.
   ``Our minds are turning away from `Hooray for Hollywood' and we
are now confronted with the hard reality of a natioln which desires
to become solvent again,''
   ``We want to retake the moral high ground,'' she said.
   ``The rostrum was lowered to desk height to accommodate Ms.
Jordan's wheelchair. She suffers from a degenerative bone disease.
   True to his word, the fire marshal closed the doors at 7:30
p.m., shutting out hundreds for the third night. The smart people
got in early.
   Rep. Claude Pepper of Florida, the oldest House member at age
87, sat on the front row of his state's delegation for his 13th
Democratic convention _ every one since 1940 when Roosevelt was
nominated for his third term.
   ``It's a well-run convention, well-handled,'' he said. ``It
shows Dukakis' good management skills. We're going to be
victorious.''
   But you couldn't sell that to many Democrats who had to miss
dinner to make it inside the hall. Long lines formed at The Omni's
food concessions, where the menu consisted of pizza, hot dogs,
popcorn and ice cream bars.
   Inevitably, some concessions ran out of food.
   That did nothing to dampen the spirit of John Economos, a
restaurateur from Des Moines, Iowa. He carried a hand-lettered sign
that read, ``Vote for Dukakis and Bentsen.'' Nothing unusual about
that, except it was in Greek.
   All was hope and promise in the convention hall on the last
night.
   ``Do you feel the excitement in the air?'' asked the chairman,
House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas.
   ``Yes!'' shouted the delegates.
   ``Are we going carry the South this year?
   ``Yes!''
   ``Will we win in November?
   ``Yes!''
   ``Do you promise me that?''
   ``Yes!''
