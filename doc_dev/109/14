   Next week's Republican National Convention will
have a distinct Texas accent, says the man who will nominate George
Bush for president.
   ``It is clear in this convention that I'm doing the nominating
and another Texan's doing the accepting, and that's pretty much
what conventions are about. So it's a Texas show from that point of
view,'' Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said Monday.
   However, Gramm said, those watching the GOP convention will hear
something quite different from last month's Democratic convention,
where Texas state Treasurer Ann Richards set the tone with several
wisecracks about Bush during her keynote speech including that the
wealthy vice president was ``born with a silver foot in his mouth.''
   ``You're going to see a stark contrast between my speech and the
speeches you heard at the Democratic convention,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm said he plans to use his speech to highlight the
differences between Vice President Bush and Dukakis.
   ``I am not a good name-caller. People don't care what I think
about Michael Dukakis in terms of some cutesy-poo thing I might
call him,'' he said.
   Still, Texas Republicans have a tough act to follow.
   Texas Democratic Party officials have referred jokingly to last
month's Democratic National Convention in Atlanta as their state
convention due to the prominent role played by Texans.
   Among them were Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, the vice presidential
nominee; Ms. Richards, the keynoter; U.S. House Speaker Jim Wright
of Fort Worth, convention chairman; former U.S. Rep. Barbara
Jordan, who seconded Bentsen's nomination; Agriculture Commissioner
Jim Hightower, who gave a prime-time speech, and state Rep. Lena
Guerrero, D-Austin, who helped present the party platform to
delegates.
   Democrats also believe the selection of Bentsen as Dukakis'
running mate will help their ticket carry Texas, the nation's
third-largest state, and its 29 electoral votes. A total of 270
electoral votes are needed to win the presidency.
   ``The campaign in Texas is going to be a hotly contested
campaign,'' Gramm said. ``We've got to put before the people of
Texas those two records. If we don't win in Texas given Michael
Dukakis' record, we don't deserve to win.''
