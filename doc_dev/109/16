   Michael Dukakis' choice of Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen to be his running mate drew praise from fellow Democrats
today, with several of them likening it to another
Massachusetts-Texas ticket _ John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson
in 1960.
   ``The Massachusetts-Texas combination got this country moving
again in 1960 _ and it will do the same for the nation in 1988,''
said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., younger brother of the late
president.
   Dukakis and Bentsen both were quick to draw the comparison
between this campaign and the one 28 years ago.
   ``The Massachusetts and the Texas ex'es were good for the
country and good for the Democratic Party in 1960 and it's going to
be a real winner in November of 88,'' Bentsen said today.
   ``Selecting a running mate is probably the first presidential
act _ if I can use that word _ that I will do,'' Dukakis said in
introducing his running mate. ``Lloyd Bentsen brings to this ticket
and will bring to this nation years of experience.''
   Bentsen's ``selection gives the Democratic Party a strong ticket
for November _ and even more important, the strong prospect of
eight solid years of effective new leadership for America,''
Kennedy said.
   Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards, who will be the keynote
speaker at next week's Democratic convention in Atlanta, called
Bentsen ``a level guy'' who ``will make a great vice president''
and added:
   ``There's always been a sort of Austin-to-Boston, Mass.,
connection, and I think that this ticket adds that same sort of
magic.''
   Ms. Richards also said that Bentsen would boost Democrats'
chances in Texas, one of the states that Dukakis' likely Republican
opponent, George Bush, calls home.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., whose own hopes for the presidential
nomination were dashed earlier this year, agreed that Bentsen could
help the Democratic ticket in Texas and said he thought the Texas
senator might help the Democrats carry Oklahoma and Louisiana as
well.
   ``Lloyd Bentsen is a skilled and seasoned lawmaker,'' Simon
said. ``This is an excellent choice, and this is a winning ticket.
   ``Democratic prospects in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana will be
boosted immediately and, when the American people get to know Lloyd
Bentsen, it will strengthen the ticket everywhere,'' Simon added.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, who will deliver the nominating
speech for Dukakis, said he also believed that Bentsen would help
the Democrats carry Texas and would help the party across the
region.
   ``I like and respect him very much,'' Clinton said.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she believes ``Lloyd Bentsen
will be a fine addition to the Democratic ticket. He knows his
issues and he knows his politics. Best of all,'' she said, ``he
knows how to beat George Bush. He did just that in 1970 to become
U.S. senator.''
   In Florida, where Democrats had been pushing home state Sen. Bob
Graham for the No. 2 spot on the Dukakis ticket, state Rep. Mike
Abrams also offered praise for Bentsen and said a Dukakis-Bentsen
victory in his state is ``doable.''
   ``We all know it's going to be tough,'' said Abrams, who is
coordinator of the Dukakis campaign in Florida. But, he added, the
choice of Bentsen ``shows a sensitivity to the South'' and ``brings
defense and foreign policy and Washington experience,'' all
considered crucial to a Democratic victory in Florida.
   Even backers of Jesse Jackson, who came in second to Dukakis in
the race for the presidential nomination and who had been one of
those the Massachusetts governor had considered for the second
spot, seemed satisfied with Bentsen.
   Florida state Rep. James Burke, who was the state campaign
coordinator for Jackson, said, ``We would have preferred to have
had Jesse.'' He added, though, that ``Bentsen is a better choice
than some of the others he could have picked.''
   John White, a former Democratic national chairman who has been
advising Jackson, said he was ``excited'' about the choice of
Bentsen and said it would ``make Texas a hell of a battlefield.''
   Union activists also praised Bentsen, saying that the Texas
senator had recently shored up his poor record on labor issues with
his deft handling of the trade bill and mandatory plant closing and
layoff notices _ some of labor's top legislative priorities this
year.
   ``Bentsen was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two _
plant closing notices and the trade bill _ were compatible,'' said
Robert McGlotten, legislative director for the AFL-CIO. ``And he
let his colleagues know how he felt.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who four years ago was picked as Democrat
Walter Mondale's running mate, said she was ``delighted'' at the
choice of Bentsen.
   ``I think it's an indication that Governor Dukakis intends to
run a strong national campaign,'' Ms. Ferraro said.
   On the Republican side, Senate Minority leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on Bush's
ticket, said he thought Dukakis ``couldn't have picked a better
man.''
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who is national co-chairwoman of
Bush's presidential campaign, called Bentsen ``a nice man who's
able'' but said she still anticipated that Bush would be able to
carry Texas.
   On the similarity to the Kennedy-Johnson ticket of 1960, she
said: ``I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseum. There's a
slight difference of course. He (Bentsen) was not selected by his
peers to be in leadership (as Lyndon Johnson, the Senate majority
leader, had been); nor is Dukakis John Kennedy.''
