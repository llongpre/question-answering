   Ann Richards, tapped as the keynote speaker
for the Democratic National Convention, said today she will consult
with advisers to apparent nominee Michael Dukakis and rival Jesse
Jackson before preparing her speech.
   She also suggested, on a light note, that she might be a
good-luck charm for the party.
   Noting that fellow Texan Barbara Jordan was the only previous
female keynoter at a Democratic Convention, in 1976, she said,
``That year the Democrats went to the White House so maybe they saw
my selection, having another female, as a good omen.''
   Before the convention, she said in an interview on CBS-TV, ``I
wanted to be sure to look at the Democratic platform. I wanted to
consult with both the Dukakis campaign and the Jackson campaign.
And of course I welcome any help and any advice that I get.''
   Ms. Richards is known for using blunt rhetoric tempered with
wicked humor to get her point across.
   At a recent Democratic Party fundraiser in Houston, one man
after another _ none of them minorities _ came to the podium to
speak. Finally it was the turn of Ms. Richards, the Texas state
treasurer and potential 1990 gubernatorial candidate.
   ``Now are there any other white men who haven't spoken yet?''
she said sweetly. ``God knows we don't want to leave any of you
out.''
   The audience roared with laughter, as Ms. Richards' audiences
usually do. And, as usual, her audience got the message.
   On Monday, her stump style was praised by Democratic Party chief
Paul G. Kirk as he announced her selection as the speaker whose
address will open the party's convention next month in Atlanta.
   The 54-year-old Ms. Richards, Kirk said at a Washington news
conference, ``has the ability to tell it like it is.''
   Kirk said Dukakis had urged the selection of a woman keynote
speaker, the first since Rep. Jordan shared that honor with John
Glenn.
   ``He was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a
woman,'' the party chief said, ``not only because of the importance
of the family concerns, the issues of stress and struggle that
women are going through in the daily work lives and family lives,
but I think it is symbolic of the importance of women to the
American family and the realities of all of that.''
   Ms. Richards, the first woman in 50 years to hold statewide
office in Texas, is the divorced mother of four grown children.
   In 1976, her first attempt at elected office, Ms. Richards
defeated an incumbent Travis County commissioner. In 1982, the
state's incumbent treasurer, under indictment for official
misconduct, withdrew from a Democratic runoff against her. She won
the general election and was re-elected without opposition in 1986.
   After the 1982 election, Ms. Richards moved quickly to change
operations in the state treasury. She also made staff changes,
boosting the number of women and minorities on the job in the
170-employee agency. She now claims the agency payroll has an
ethnic and sex balance reflecting the state's general population.
   Ms. Richards said Monday that women's issues are ``the same
issues that affect all other human beings'' _ but with a twist.
   ``The difference is the role, sociologically, that women have
played. That is we are the caretakers, the nurturers,'' she says.
``It usually falls to us when any time hard times and bad times
hit.''
   It's a message often repeated by Ms. Richards. If you can make a
household work, she says, you can succeed in government.
   ``Most homemakers don't know what enormous skills they have.
Putting three meals on the table each day is a pretty big job in
itself, much less doing the laundry and car pooling,'' she once
told a reporter.
   Her professional success has come despite personal challenges.
In 1980, after being confronted by family members, she sought
treatment for alcoholism. She says she has not had a drink since
then, and she has been active in helping others battle alcoholism.
   Shortly after her treatment, she and husband David Richards
separated, and in 1984 the two obtained what they both said was an
amicable divorce.
   Richards, a lawyer, was on hand Monday when his ex-wife talked
to reporters about being selected to give the keynote speech. She
acknowledged him as someone who ``played a very large role in my
life, politically and personally.''
   Beyond the convention and helping to put a Democrat in the White
House, Ms. Richards' most immediate goal is the 1990 Texas
gubernatorial race. She has not formally declared her intentions,
but sent out her first exploratory fund-raising letter Monday.
   Ms. Richards said she is not certain what effect her half-hour
in the political spotlight in Atlanta will have on her
gubernatorial race.
   ``I suppose if I'm good it will help,'' she said Monday. ``And
if I'm bad it won't.''
