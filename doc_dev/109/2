   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan was
``vastly improved'' and giving the thumbs-up sign to her hospital
nurse Sunday following a near-drowning in her swimming pool.
   ``She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get
well,'' said Dr. William J. Deaton, a lung specialist treating Ms.
Jordan.
   ``She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of
the time, knowing what she's been through and how close she came to
a real catastrophic event. But she still also has her jovial
personality. She was joking a little bit this morning,'' Deaton
said. ``She is vastly improved.''
   Ms. Jordan's condition was upgraded from critical to serious but
stable, and she continued to improve Sunday night.
   ``She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her
own. She is receiving supplemental oxygen, though,'' hospital
spokeswoman Kari Larsen said.
   Ms. Jordan, 52, who gained national attention during the Nixon
impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter to
Brackenridge Hospital on Saturday after she was found floating
face-down in her pool.
   Deaton said she came within ``four to five minutes, 10 minutes
at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death.
   Ms. Jordan apparently lost consciousness while in the pool.
Deaton and Dr. James Little, a neurologist, said it isn't known
what caused her to lose consciousness, but that the lack of oxygen
then caused cardiac arrest.
   Ms. Jordan had been in critical condition in the hospital's
intensive care unit, but Deaton said Sunday afternoon that ``she's
upgraded now. She's certainly stable, in a much less serious
condition.''
   Ms. Jordan was breathing without the aid of a mechanical
ventilator, responding to questions and trying to make sure a
Monday dental appointment was canceled. ``She obviously has pretty
good mental recall if that's her biggest concern,'' Deaton said.
   ``Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get
totally back to normal,'' Little said. ``She's very close to normal
right now. I think she will continue to improve. As best as I can
tell right now, she probably will regain full mental functions.''
   The doctors said Ms. Jordan, who has used a wheelchair for
several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis but her condition
shouldn't have had an effect on the incident.
   ``She has muscle weakness and it would be difficult for her to
rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any
event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event,
that she had any warning,'' Deaton said.
   Little said possible causes for her losing consciousness were a
sudden heartbeat irregularity or a seizure. But hospital tests
showed ``her cardiac status has been very stable. She's had no
evidence of seizure activity,'' he said.
   Ms. Jordan delivered a nominating speech for vice presidential
candidate Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas at the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta. Bentsen telephoned a message to Ms. Jordan
on Sunday, said hospital spokeswoman Carolyn Hinckley Boyle.
   Visitors to the hospital have included Texas Treasurer Ann
Richards, who delivered the keynote address at the convention; Walt
Rostow, a former aide to President Lyndon Johnson; University of
Texas women's basketball Coach Jody Conradt; plus Ms. Jordan's two
sisters and live-in companion, Nancy Earl, who found Ms. Jordan in
the pool.
   Ms. Jordan is a fan of the University of Texas' Lady Longhorns,
and nurse Barbara Tucker said the basketball team's former star,
Fran Harris, visited before leaving for the Olympic trials.
   ``When I remember seeing Ms. Jordan on TV, I frequently remember
the thumbs-up sign that things are OK. She's probably given me that
about 20 times today,'' Ms. Tucker said.
   Ms. Jordan in 1966 became the first black state senator in Texas
history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to
Congress since Reconstruction, serving until 1978, when she left
politics after three terms in the House to teach at the University
of Texas.
