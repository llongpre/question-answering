   Lloyd Bentsen, cast in the role of
conservative on the new Democratic ticket, has decided not to bury
his differences with the more liberal Michael Dukakis, but to
praise them.
   Before millions of Americans who watched Thursday's convention
on prime-time television, the Texas senator served notice that he
does not believe Democrats must ``march in lockstep'' to win the
White House.
   His speech was not as dynamic as that of the presidential
nominee, and it did not rouse the crowd to the heights attained by
Dukakis' oratory. But Bentsen had his own way of telling his party
he balances the ticket nicely:
   Democrats, he said, ``are not gray grains of oatmeal in a bland
porridge of privilege ... We have differences of opinion. But on
the basic issues of justice and opportunity, we stand united.''
   If the party does not expect great things of Bentsen's rhetoric,
it does expect great things of him in November. The senator, whose
name has been described as ``magic'' in the state of Texas, was
picked for the ticket to win his home state, and its 29 electoral
votes, for the Democrats.
   The Dukakis-Bentsen camp has also made it clear Bentsen will
spend a good deal of time in the South, which has been Reagan-Bush
territory of late.
   Bentsen and his aides have stressed those issues on which he and
Dukakis agree: economic growth, jobs creation, women's rights and
better housing, health care and education for all citizens.
   But Bentsen is more conservative than Dukakis and many Democrats
on many issues, including his support of school prayer, the Contra
rebels in Nicaragua and his opposition to gun control.
   Still, the quiet-spoken senator, who has a vaguely patrician
air, had plenty of supporters Thursday night.
   Dukakis, in his own remarks, paid tribute to Bentsen, saying he
would speak up if the National Security Council came up with the
``cockamamie idea that we should trade arms to the ayatollah for
hostages.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who nominated Bentsen and works
with him closely on Capitol Hill, called him ``straightforward ...
smart ... and tough.''
   ``He is a sensible, reasonable, rational, common-sense good
choice for vice president of the United States,'' said former Rep.
Barbara Jordan of Texas. ``I believe that he is the best choice you
could come up with to give us a strong and winning ticket this
November.''
   Bentsen also won praise from Jesse Jackson for his longtime
support of civil rights. On Thursday, just as Bentsen's name was
being entered in nomination, Jackson issued a written endorsement
of the senator.
   ``While I may disagree with both Governor Dukakis and Senator
Bentsen on some important issues, our interests converge in
building a coalition to beat the Republicans this fall,'' Jackson
said.
   Still, when the voice vote was taken to acclaim Bentsen the
nominee, many Jackson supporters shouted ``no,'' voicing their
continued displeasure at the absence of their candidate on the
ticket. Fifteen members of Bentsen's Texas delegation refused to
join in the celebration. Signs reading ``No Contra aid'' were
sprinkled through the convention hall.
   Bentsen's own speech drew loud and sustained applause only when
he mentioned Dukakis, but the senator was unruffled.
   ``Just wonderful, really excited,'' he beamed as he left the
podium with Dukakis to attend a round of post-convention parties.
