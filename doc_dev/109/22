   Barbara Bush is finished with the radiation
treatments for a stubborn eye ailment that has impaired her vision
but will not know for at least two months how effective the
treatments have been.
   The first lady underwent the last of 10 radiation treatments on
Friday, said Anna Perez, Mrs. Bush's press secretary.
   After receiving the 10-minute radiation dose at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center, Mrs. Bush returned to the White House and took her
daily swim in the outdoor, heated swimming pool, said Ms. Perez.
   She also attended a briefing on the Head Start education
program, hosting volunteers from the organization.
   ``She feels great,'' said Ms. Perez.
   Doctors will not know for at least two months, and maybe as long
as four, whether the radiation was effective in treating the
symptoms of Graves' disease, an immune system disorder that earlier
affected Mrs. Bush's thyroid as well, said Ms. Perez.
   Mrs. Bush began the radiation treatments after the steroid drug
prednisone failed to improve her eyes. She suffers eye irritation,
double vision and bulging eyes as a result of the Graves' disease,
which was diagnosed early last year.
   The disease initially caused her thyroid to be overproductive,
but a one-time radioactive treatment rendered the thyroid inactive
and cured that effect of the disease.
   The low-level radiation treatments were intended to decrease
swelling behind the eyes, in the small muscles that control eye
movement.
   Although suffering from eye irritation, Mrs. Bush has maintained
a schedule of public appearances, both with her husband and by
herself.
   Should the radiation fail, surgery would be an option, experts
say.
