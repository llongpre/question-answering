   She was 16 and home for the holidays from
finishing school. He was 17 and an Andover senior decked out in a
tux for the Christmas dance at a Greenwich, Conn., country club.
   It was December 1941. Three weeks earlier, America had gone to
war. George ``Poppy'' Bush already had decided to enlist as soon as
he turned 18.
   But on this evening, his attention was drawn to the tall,
slender girl with wavy, reddish-brown hair, twirling around the
dance floor in a green-and-red holiday dress with one of his tennis
buddies.
   The friend was happy to oblige Bush with an introduction to
Barbara Pierce of nearby Rye, N.Y.
   Before they reached the floor, the band switched from a Glenn
Miller tune to a waltz that was beyond Bush's dancing ability. So
the couple sat down and talked.
   And talked.
   A few nights later, on their first date, Bush borrowed his
folks' big car _ the one with the radio _ to fill the air in case
conversation faltered.
   But, as writer Donnie Radcliffe recounts in a new biography of
Barbara Bush, ``he need not have bothered.''
   ``Years later he would tease that she started talking that night
and hadn't stopped since,'' writes Radcliffe in ``Simply Barbara
Bush: A Portrait of America's Candid First Lady.''
   The book follows the Bushes from their wartime marriage to the
oil fields of Texas to the political career that led them from
Congress to China and now, after 29 moves in 44 years of marriage,
to the White House.
   Radcliffe, who has covered first ladies and the East Wing of the
White House for The Washington Post since 1969, recalls Bush saying
on a campaign flight last fall that if he won, ``there's one
prediction I'll make ... America will fall in love with Barbara
Bush.''
   ``America did,'' adds Radcliffe. ``In no time at all, her white
hair, her wrinkles, her size-14 figure and her fake pearls became
the new standards by which American women could measure themselves
_ and hope to measure up.''
   She clearly cuts a different figure than the petite ex-actress,
Nancy Reagan, who last occupied 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
   As Mrs. Bush quipped at a 1986 charity dinner: ``As you know, we
have a lot in common. ... She fights drugs; I fight illiteracy. She
wears a size three _ so's my leg.''
   Born in New York on June 8, 1925, she was the third of Marvin
and Pauline Pierce's four children.
   He was an engineer who turned to publishing. She was, in
Barbara's memory, an ``absolutely ravishing'' woman with a green
thumb, an inveterate joiner of civic causes and a spendthrift. The
Pierces lived well, but beyond their means, in a five-bedroom brick
home in upscale Rye.
   When Barbara's older sister Martha went off to Smith College,
Vogue immortalized her on its cover as ``College Girl of the Year.''
   Back home, Barbara was a tomboy, 5-foot-8 and 148 pounds at age
12. She recalls looking ``like Porky Pig.''
   At Ashley Hall, the finishing school in Charleston, S.C., she
set school records at speed-knitting, swimming underwater (2{ times
across the pool) and, according to Radcliffe, ``eating the most
hot, buttured biscuits in one meal without being caught.''
   After that holiday dance, the teen-age couple had a whirlwind,
if long distance, romance, with the letters postmarked ``ANDOVER''
turning up almost daily in Barbara's school mailbox. He took her to
his senior prom at the prestigious prep school outside Boston.
   A few weeks later, Bush joined the Navy and began the training
that would make him its youngest pilot.
   After Barbara's graduation in 1943, she spent 17 days with Bush
and his family at their oceanfront home in Maine, where she was a
hit with Dorothy Walker Bush, the clan's tennis-playing matriarch.
   Barbara dropped out of Smith College in 1944 after her freshman
year, planning to marry Bush in December.
   On Sept. 2, 1944, Bush's torpedo bomber, with ``Barbara''
painted on its side, was shot down by Japanese gunners during a
raid on Chichi Jima.
   Bush bailed out after dropping his four 500-pound bombs; the two
crewman with him didn't make it. An American submarine rescued the
flier, who returned home on Christmas Eve, with a Distinguished
Flying Cross and 58 combat missions.
   The wedding took place a few weeks late, on Jan. 6, 1945.
   Bush was mustered out of the Navy in August and enrolled at
Yale. Barbara worked part-time at the Yale Co-op and boasts that
``by the time we moved from Yale, I knew how to wash diapers and
cook dinner.''
   George Walker Bush, the first of their six kids, was born in
July 1946.
   Bush breezed through Yale in three years, making Phi Beta Kappa
as an economics major, captain of the baseball team, president of
Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and member of Skull and Bones, the
elite, secret student society.
   They headed off to Odessa, Texas, to embark on a career in the
oil fields.
   Pauline Pierce kept sending her daughter Tide until Barbara
convinced her mother the grocery stores in West Texas were bigger
than the ones in Rye. Mrs. Pierce was killed in a car accident in
1949.
   Tragedy struck again in 1953, when doctors told the Bushes their
3-year-old daughter, Robin, was dying of leukemia. They took her to
Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital in New York, where Barbara seldom
left her side. The child died 10 weeks before her 4th birthday.
   Her hair began going gray during Robin's illness. For years, at
the suggestion of her mother-in-law, she dyed the gray away, but
abandoned that in 1970, tired of the greenish hue her hair acquired
whenever she swam in a pool.
   Mrs. Bush was always a full-time mother, ferrying the children
to Little League games and myriad other activities, packing them
into the station wagon to drive to Kennebunkport each summer, and
meting out most of the discipline.
   She said earlier this year that when the family nest finally
emptied, ``I went through sort of a ... difficult time really
because suddenly women's lib had made me feel that my life had been
wasted.''
   The blues did not last long. She stepped up her volunteer
activities and discovered a favorite cause: literacy.
   ``I once spent the summer thinking of all the things that
bothered me _ teen pregnancy, drugs, everything _ and I realized
everything would be better if more people could read and write,''
said Mrs. Bush, who also had experienced the difficulties of
helping son Neil overcome dyslexia.
   She is often credited as serving as a goad to her husband's
social conscience.
   At times she has made headlines, including her ``rhymes with
rich'' crack about Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 and support for a ban
on AK-47s after a man killed five children in a Stockton, Calif.,
schoolyard.
   She has since tried to steer clear of public policy statements.
   That ``muzzle'' is nothing new, she told reporters.
   ``I muzzled myself about 1967, when George went into the
Congress,'' she said. ``It's a decision I made many years ago that
when I disagreed with George Bush, I tell him in private.''
