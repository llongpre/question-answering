   The huge Santa Barbara brush fire that burned
hundreds of homes was brought under control Tuesday as scores of
fire victims across Southern California began the formidable job of
recovery.
   The declaration was issued at 6 a.m., 5{ days after the blaze
was set by an arsonist in San Marcos Pass and blew down the
foothills of the coastal mountains through hundreds of homes on the
outskirts of Santa Barbara.
   A small crew of firefighters backed by a helicopter and two
engines watched for smoldering hotspots, but the blaze was
considered controlled because no flames showed within 300 feet of
fire lines cut through the brush.
   But while victory over the 4,500-acre fire took less than a
week, people burned out of more than 450 dwellings were only
beginning a long process of rebuilding and emotional recovery.
   It was the same story in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale,
where 66 hillside homes were damaged or destroyed in a arson blaze
June 27, and in the aftermath of a 6,640-acre blaze that straddled
the Orange-San Bernardino county line and destroyed 14 homes last
week. Both fires were caused by arson, officials said.
   In Santa Barbara and Glendale, the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and state Office of Emergency Services opened centers to
take applications for low-interest loans and grants.
   Fires also continued to burn in Colorado and Texas.
   In California, organizations like the Red Cross and Salvation
Army continued supplying victims with immediate essentials,
including clothing, medicine, and in some cases psychological aid.
   ``The stress and emotional trauma is paramount right now. We
have many severely traumatized people,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman
Elizabeth Quirk in Santa Barbara.
   More than 340 families were registered with the Red Cross in
Santa Barbara and the number was expected to top 600. Six shelters
that housed more than 1,000 people during the fire were closed, and
efforts focused on finding regular housing.
   Red Cross, which already has committed $200,000 in direct
services to victims, will provide the first month's rent and
security deposit.
   The question will be whether there is enough housing in the
area, Ms. Quirk said.
   On the rebuilding front, Santa Barbara County was in its second
day of issuing demolition permits. On Monday, 280 people began the
permit process, said spokeswoman Jayne Brechwald.
   Residents also will need permits for temporary housing,
electrical poles and similar fixtures that must be in place before
construction can start. Permit fees were waived for the time being.
   A private relief center was established at the Goleta Youth
Sports Center to help people reach contractors, architects, and
real-estate and insurance agents.
   Despite the breadth of help coming to the region, experts
predicted a very lengthy recovery.
   ``We'll probably still be taking care of fire victims for at
least a year,'' Ms. Quirk said.
   Red Cross had on hand 650 local volunteers and was ready to
supply victims with some furnishings, occupational supplies like
uniforms and tools, and personal items like eyeglasses,
prescription medicines and dentures.
   Four roving food trucks have served 4,000 meals in the fire area
since the blaze began.
   Help has come from across North America. A Robinson's department
store gave Red Cross $50,000 for direct dispersal to victims.
