   Three emergency workers were
hospitalized and several hundred people were evacuated from their
homes when a fire at a swimming pool supply company created a cloud
of chlorine gas, authorities said.
   The workers were released Saturday from Desert Hospital and no
serious injuries were reported in this desert resort, said police
Sgt. Tom Barton.
   The fire at Ocean Pool Mart broke out Friday evening, and
residents were asked to leave a 1-square-mile area, including Palm
Springs Regional Airport.
   Arriving commercial and private flights were diverted to Ontario
Airport, some 50 miles to the west. Outgoing flights were canceled
and the airport was evacuated, said city spokeswoman Barbara Erdman.
   The exact number of evacuees was not determined, but 150 people
went to an evacuation center at Raymond Cree Junior High School.
   Barton said people were allowed to return home about 9:30 p.m.
   Several people complained of breathing difficulty and eye
irritation, but no one other than the emergency workers was
hospitalized, Barton said.
   ``I could smell the chlorine in the air. It made my nose burn
and it gave me a slight headache,'' said Hazel Reed of Bakersfield,
who was vacationing in Palm Springs.
   ``When my chest started hurting, that's when I decided to leave
my home,'' said Donna Winters, who said her daughter also had chest
pains.
   Nina Smith said she at first ignored a police call to evacuate
her home because she was afraid to venture out on foot.
   ``I stayed because I have no car. I put towels on the floor in
front of the door so that nothing could seep through,'' Ms. Smith
said. Eventually she called a friend to drive her to the evacuation
center.
