   Republican officials said today, one day after the Democrats
named Texan Ann Richards as their convention keynote speaker, that
Jeane J. Kirkpatrick would be ``one of the featured speakers'' at
the GOP convention in August.
   Meanwhile, George Bush, the likely Republican presidential
nominee, was traveling to California today to visit a NASA research
center and a neighborhood safety program. Democrat Michael Dukakis
was touting his Massachusetts record on housing issues before
focusing again on the search for a running mate.
   The Republicans announced the convention role for Ms.
Kirkpatrick, a favorite of conservatives, after the Democrats said
they had chosen Texas State Treasurer Richards, a fiery populist
orator, to deliver the keynote speech and ``set the tone'' for the
Democratic National Convention in Atlanta next month.
   Ms. Kirkpatrick, a former Democrat, gave a widely publicized
speech attacking the Democrats at the 1984 Republican convention.
Republican Party chief Frank J. Fahrenkopf Jr. said the
announcement of the keynote speaker for the New Orleans meeting
would probably come in the next ten days.
   Ms. Richards, 54, will be the second woman in party history to
deliver the convention-opening address.
   Today, in an interview on CBS-TV, she mentioned fellow Texan
Barbara Jordan's keynote speech in 1976 and added, ``That year the
Democrats went to the White House so maybe they saw my selection,
having another female, as a good omen.''
   Ms. Richards said she would consult with advisers to Jesse
Jackson as well as Dukakis before preparing her speech. ``I welcome
any help and any advice that I get,'' she said.
   Jackson, meanwhile, says he is weighing which of a dozen issues
left out of the party platform to bring up at convention. His
comments came after Democrats, meeting in Denver and Washington
over the weekend, agreed to a platform draft and an overhaul of
party rules in a rare atmosphere of unity.
   Jackson was part of the sellout crowd of 21,785 in Atlantic
City, N.J., who watched Mike Tyson knock out Michael Spinks in the
first round and retain the undisputed heavyweight crown.
   Dukakis will travel on Wednesday to Washington to meet with
several dozen senators, including some who have been mentioned as
possible running mates.
   Among them is Georgia Sen. Sam Nunn, although he said Monday he
was not providing the Dukakis campaign with background and
financial information it has requested of prospective running mates.
   Nunn said he had told Dukakis and campaign chairman Paul
Brountas that a spot on the Democratic ticket is ``not on my
agenda.'' Brountas is heading the search for a running mate.
   Another prominent senator, New Jersey's Bill Bradley, last week
said he had informed Dukakis that he did not want to be considered.
And the Seattle Post-Intelligencer reported today, citing
unidentified sources, that House Majority Leader Tom Foley, who has
said frequently that he doesn't want to be vice president, had
chosen not to have Dukakis' aides examine his personal background
and finances.
   Those under consideration, according to sources, include
Jackson, Sens. Bob Graham of Florida, Nunn, John Glenn of Ohio, and
Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, and Reps. Foley of Washington and Lee
Hamilton of Indiana.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt
also reportedly have been asked to provide information to Brountas.
   Aides said there was no timetable for making or announcing the
choice for he second spot on the ticket.
   Jackson has continued to talk about his own qualifications as a
running mate for Dukakis. And although he says he's happy with
parts of the platform, he is indicating that some points of
disagreement will be brought up at the convention.
   ``By and large, we got many of our campaign priorities in the
platform,'' Jackson said Monday. But he noted that his forces had
``protected our right to ... protest or raise other issues in
Atlanta.''
   One of those issues might be a call for the creation of a
Palestinian homeland _ rejected by the Dukakis forces for inclusion
in the platform.
   ``Reasonable discussion on this matter should not alienate
anyone,'' Jackson said in Rosemont, Ill.
   In announcing the selection of Ms. Richards as the keynote
speaker for the Democrats, party chief Paul G. Kirk said she would
``set the tone for Democrats in Atlanta and... draw the
distinctions between the party of the working American people and
the party of the establishment.''
   In Texas, Ms. Richards, the divorced mother of four grown
children, said: ``I probably will be talking very much about
American families. I think that's what I know the most about, other
than my professional job.''
   Kirk also announced the appointment of four co-chairmen for the
convention: Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Rep. Norman Mineta of
California, former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya and Little Rock,
Ark., Mayor Lottie Shackelford.
   Bush met Monday with Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin in
Washington amid more bad news in the polls.
