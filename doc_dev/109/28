   Texas Treasurer Ann Richards, in a highly
personal keynote address, told the Democratic National Convention
on Monday night that the Reagan administration had turned America's
working class into the forgotten class. ``We can do better,'' she
said.
   Ms. Richards recounted a letter from a Lorena, Texas mother of
three who said her family income of $50,000 a year makes life a
constant fiscal challenge.
   ``We're the people you see every day in the grocery store,'' Ms.
Richards said, quoting from the unidentified woman's letter. ``We
obey the laws, pay our taxes and fly our flag on holidays.
   ``We plod along, trying to make it better for ourselves and our
children and our parents. We aren't vocal anymore. I think maybe
we're too tired,'' the woman wrote. ``I believe people like us have
been forgotten in America.''
   Ms. Richards said the woman was right.
   ``Of course you believe you're forgotten. Because you have been.
This Republican administration treats us as if we were pieces of a
puzzle that can't fit together. They've tried to put us in
compartments and separate us from each other. Their political
theory is divide and conquer,'' she said.
   ``No wonder we feel isolated, confused. We want answers and
their response is that something is wrong with you,'' Ms. Richards
added. ``Well nothing's wrong with you ... that you can't fix in
November.''
   ``When it comes right down to it, this election is a contest
between those who are satisfied with what they have _ and those who
know we can do better,'' she said. ``That's what this election is
all about.''
   Using her trademark rapier wit, she singled out Vice President
George Bush, the probable GOP presidential nominee.
   ``For eight straight years George Bush hasn't displayed the
slightest interest in anything we care about. And now that he is
after a job that he can't get appointed to, he's like Columbus
discovering America. He's found child care. He's found education,''
she said.
   ``Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot
in his mouth,'' Ms. Richards said.
   She received a big laugh with her opening line, when she chided
Bush's claim that he is a Texan. He claims a Houston hotel suite as
his legal residence.
   ``I am delighted to be here with you this evening because after
listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to
know what a real Texas accent sounds like,'' said the Waco, Texas
native who speaks with a sure-enough Texas drawl.
   ``I want to announce to this nation that in a little more than
100 days, the
Reagan-Meese-Deaver-Nofziger-Poindexter-North-Weinberger-Watt-Gorsuch-Lavelle-St
ockman-Haig-Bork-Noriega-Geoge Bush-era will be over,'' she said to
sustained applause from the Democrats.
   Dukakis, who watched the speech on television, telephoned Ms.
Richards to congratulate her on ``a great speech.''
   According to press secretaqry Dayton Duncan, Dukakis told Mrs.
Richards, ``What am I going to say on Thursday? You said it all.''
Dukakis will deliver his acceptance speech on Thursday.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose keynote address four years ago
propelled him to national prominence, also had high praise for Ms.
Richards' effort.
   ``I think it was like lighting a fuse for these Democrats,''
Cuomo said from the NBC anchor booth where he watched the address.
``They're ready to go.''
   Ms. Richards had high praise for Michael Dukakis, to whom she is
committed, and for runner-up Jesse Jackson.
   She said Jackson ``can open our hearts and our minds and stir
our very souls. He's taught us that we are as good as our capacity
for caring.''
   She touted Dukakis as a man ``who knows that this country is on
the edge of a great new era.
   ``Behind his calm there's an impatience to unify this country
and get on with the future,'' Ms. Richards said.
   And she praised Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Dukakis' designated
running mate, as someone who ``understands America from the barrio
to the board room.''
   Ms. Richards also carried through on her promise to note the
importance of letting a woman make the keynote address. She noted
that former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan, another Texan, was the
keynote speaker in 1976.
   ``Two women in 160 years is about par for the course. But if you
give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did
everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards in high
heels,'' Ms. Richards said.
   Ms. Richards, a 54-year-old divorced mother of four grown
children, spoke of being a grandmother, and of wanting to tell her
grand-daughter Lily ``how very lucky she is. That for all our
differences, we're still the greatest nation on this good earth.''
   ``I just hope _ like her grandparents and her great grandparents
before _ that Lily goes on to raise her kids with the promise that
echoes in homes across America: That we can do better.''
