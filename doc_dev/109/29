<HEAD>Doctor Ordered To Continue Dialysis For Unwanted Patient</HEAD>

   A kidney specialist has been ordered
to provide dialysis for another week to a woman refused the
life-giving treatment by more than a dozen other doctors.
   But a temporary restraining order issued Friday also said Jeanie
Joshua of Ojai must go elsewhere for treatment after the order
expires Friday.
   The UCLA Medical Center has accepted her for dialysis, but Ms.
Joshua said the 80-mile trip three days a week would be impossible
for her in her weakened condition.
   ``This is going to be a slow death. There's no way I can
withstand it,'' said Ms. Joshua. A friend now drives her 40 miles to
Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara.
   Ms. Joshua, 38, claims kidney specialists from Santa Barbara to
Simi Valley have refused to treat her because of her 1986 lawsuit
against a Santa Barbara specialist that contends impure water was
used in the blood-purifying dialysis procedure. The suit is pending.
   Her current physician, Dr. David W. Doner Jr., told the Los
Angeles Times he was dropping Ms. Joshua because she was too
aggressive in directing her medical treatment and because he could
not find another specialist to see her if he needed to leave town.
   Ms. Joshua described herself as an assertive patient who
sometimes refuses to take tests or treatments she disagrees with.
   Three medical groups representing 11 doctors in southern Santa
Barbara and Ventura counties have refused to see her, she said.
   Doner has a legal right to drop the woman as a patient, his
lawyer said. ``It's well-established law that a physician may select
which patients he cares for,'' said Harold M. Haider.
   The few court cases on the issue have generally upheld a doctor's
right to drop a patient or refuse to accept someone as a new
patient, said Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical
Ethics at the University of Minnesota.
   But arrangements have usually been made to provide
life-sustaining treatment even to combative or abusive patients, he
said.
   ``There are cases where patients have been dialyzed while
shackled to a bed or with an armed guard present,'' Caplan said.
``You can't just be abandoned in a life-and-death situation.''
