   Former Rep. Barbara Jordan, recovering from a near
drowning, talked politics with reporters and her nurses Thursday,
and said she's feeling much better.
   ``I really feel great. All I know is right now, I could not die
because this is the Democrats' year and I have got to be around to
celebrate it,'' said Ms. Jordan, 52, who remained in fair condition
at Brackenridge Hospital.
   Ms. Jordan gave the seconding speech for Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of
Texas as the Democrats' vice presidential candidate at the party's
recent Democratic National Convention.
   Sitting in a chair in her hospital room, Ms. Jordan remarked on
the good wishes she has received from across the nation.
   ``I have received cards, telegrams, letters, flowers from all
over this country,'' she said. ``If I did have the desire to return
to active politics, I think I could make a good run at national
office. I am very grateful and I feel very fortunate to have so
many people feel do deeply and care so much for me.''
   The former three-term congresswoman and first black state
senator in Texas history said she has no plans to leave her current
teaching job at the University of Texas' Lyndon B. Johnson School
of Public Affairs.
   ``My plans were and are to continue to teach ... and to continue
to educate young minds to take over this country,'' she said.
   Ms. Jordan said she didn't remember much about the accident that
happened around noon Saturday. She lost consciousness while in her
backyard swimming pool and was found face-down in the pool by her
roommate.
   Ms. Jordan, who uses a wheelchair because she suffers from what
doctors say is a disease similar to multiple sclerosis, swims for
exercise. She said she hopes the accident won't make her afraid to
continue.
   ``I hope that I'm not traumatized by this event so I refrain
from doing that ... I enjoyed it,'' she said.
   She also said she was grateful for the efforts of the emergency
medical service technicians and hospital helicopter crew who
rescued her.
   ``It's a compilation of people who did superb work to see to it
that I can sit here today and talk to you. And I thank them and am
grateful for it,'' she said.
   Ms. Jordan is being treated in the hospital's critical care
unit. Doctors said she may remain hospitalized for about four more
days.
