   Wildfires ignited by arson and
accident crackled across Southern California on Thursday after
ravaging more than 560 homes and other buildings in Santa Barbara
County and more than 90 homes elsewhere.
   A U.S. Forest Service firefighting helicopter crashed in San
Marcos Pass northwest of Santa Barbara, and the pilot broke his
leg. The aviator was taken to a hospital, said Santa Barbara County
spokesman Bill Douros.
   The National Weather Service said a return of gusts that fanned
flames Wednesday was unlikely. Hot, dry winds had fanned the
flames, which scorched 14,000 acres of brush in a four-county area
north, east and south of Los Angeles.
   Fires also burned in Arizona, Colorado, Montana, Utah and Texas.
   A destructive blaze in the Los Angeles suburb of Glendale was
contained after destroying or damaging 66 hillside homes Wednesday.
   No deaths were immediately reported. One person was severely
burned in Santa Barbara and three firefighters were seriously
injured in Riverside County, authorities said.
   Santa Barbara County, where rugged brush-covered hills rise
sharply from the coastline, was hit hardest. A 4,000-acre arson
fire that broke out late Wednesday near Santa Barbara and the
nearby town of Goleta was one of the worst on record here. It
continued to burn Thursday afternoon, and firefighters would offer
no estimate of when it might be contained.
   ``The fire is incredible. It came down from the mountains. It
spread everywhere. It burned everything in its path,'' said county
sheriff's department spokesman Tim Grasey.
   The fire destroyed some neighborhoods; in other cases, it leaped
over houses and left them standing improbably amid ruins.
   Desert winds up to 60 mph pushed the fire through the hills
Wednesday night, giving some residents little time to flee.
   ``You're just lucky to have your life,'' said Kay O'Brien, who
fled her home with her husband carrying only family pictures and a
retirement watch. The home and all their possessions were lost.
   ``We woke up this morning and wanted to brush our teeth, but we
didn't even have a toothbrush,'' she said.
   The toll in the Santa Barbara area was put at 567 homes and
other buildings. Bill Wallace, a county supervisor, said the homes
alone were worth $190 million, and said the damage figure could go
as high as $500 million.
   Firefighters controlled blazes in Utah and at Yellowstone
National Park in Montana, but other fires raged unchecked in
Arizona, Texas and Colorado. In Arizona, where six firefighters
died Tuesday, a lightning fire in the Tonto National Forest
destroyed a cabin built in the 1920s by Western novelist Zane Grey.
   Two units of specially trained Wyoming Air National Guard
firefighters have been ordered to California to help fight the
wildfires raging out of control near Santa Barbara, said John
Cornelison of the Wyoming Adjutant General's office.
   The soldiers will travel to the West Coast in two C-130 aircraft
equipped with firefighting systems capable of dumping 3,000 gallons
of fire retardant in less than eight seconds, Cornelison said.
   California Gov. George Deukmejian toured Santa Barbara and
Glendale and declared states of emergency to release additional
state money and pave the way for federal assistance.
   Deukmejian also authorized a $50,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of the arsonist.
   Fire danger loomed high throughout Southern California, where
the brush is parched by four years of drought. A heat wave entered
its third day after setting record highs over 100 degrees in many
areas.
   In Los Angeles County, a blaze in the hills above Clareont
threatened a school and 10 houses. The 50-acre blaze started in the
afternoon, and burned out of control, authorities said.
   In Glendale, residents of the hilly neighborhood struck by an
arsonist sorted through the ashes, all that was left of many
expensive homes.
   ``I guess we'll just tighten our belts and get on with life,''
said Dennie Gill, a produce wholesaler whose home was destroyed.
``It was a nice house.''
   Witnesses said they saw one of two young men in a car toss a
butane lighter into the brush off Verdugo Road, where the fire
started, said Chris Gray, a battalion chief in the Glendale Fire
Department.
   In Riverside County, a controlled burn that got out of hand when
winds unexpectedly changed bore down on the city of Corona after
destroying 12 homes and charring 2,200 acres, said Corona police
Sgt. Rick Bourgault.
   ``Some of the smoldering areas came right up to the back yards
of houses,'' said Bourgault. ``There's lots of smoke and hot spots.
Some of the hot spots whipped up into pretty good fires.''
   An arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area of San Bernardino
County blackened 6,640 acres and destroyed at least 14 homes, with
hundreds more threatened, said Orange County Fire Department
spokeswoman Maria Sobal.
   The fire was 50 percent contained and firefighters worked
feverishly to beat rising winds, said California Department of
Forestry spokeswoman Sharon Sellers.
   ``To make matters worse, fireworks go on sale today,'' she said.
``We're not happy about that.''
   A man described as a transient was arrested for investigaton of
arson in the Carbon Canyon blaze. Authorities said he sparked the
blaze while trying to make coffee with two camp fires.
   Three inmates working as firefighters were in good condition
recovering at Sherman Oaks Community Hospital after suffering
first- and second-degree burns Wednesday in a 150-acre fire near
Hemet, said hospital spokeswoman Johna Rogovin.
   ``The wind shifted on them really quickly and there was nothing
they could do,'' said Riverside County Fire Department spokeswoman
Deborah Bennett.
   The fire was contained early Thursday, she said.
   In the Moreno Valley area of the county, fire destroyed three
homes and three outbuildings. Four firefighters were injured.
   In San Diego County, a fast-moving blaze erupted near Lake
Henshaw, consuming 75 acres and forcing the evacuation of a Boy
Scout camp, said California Department of Forestry spokeswoman
Audrey Hagen.
   Four earlier brush fires blackened about 1,700 acres before
firefighters contained the blazes.
