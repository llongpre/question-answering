   Ann Richards, fiery populist and Texas state
treasurer, was chosen Monday to deliver the keynote speech and
``set the tone'' for the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta
next month.
   Party chief Paul G. Kirk said Ms. Richards ``has the ability to
tell it like it is'' as he announced that the 54-year-old will be
the second woman in party history to take the podium to deliver the
opening address of the meeting. She is the first woman to hold
statewide office in Texas in half a century.
   Kirk said the Democratic nominee-to-be Michael Dukakis was
consulted on the choice and was interested in having a woman to
step to the podium on July 18.
   ``He was very hopeful that we might make a selection of a
woman,'' Kirk said, ``not only because of the importance of the
family concerns, the issues of stress and struggle that women are
going through in the daily work lives and family lives, but I think
it is symbolic of the importance of women to the American family
and the realities of all of that.
   ``And the fact that, let's face it, that is a strength of the
Democratic Party and a weakness of George Bush and the
Republicans.''
   Ms. Richards, who held a news conference in Austin, Texas,
shortly after Kirk's announcement, said American families are
``what I know the most about, other than my professional job.''
   Known for her sparkling rhetoric, Ms. Richards said she honed
her speaking ability on the soap boxes of small-town Texas.
   ``For about the past 10 years I've been making speeches at the
Madisonville Cattleman's Association and the McAllen
Mexican-American Democrats convention and the Nacogdoches Chamber
of Commerce and in any number of places that you think of,'' Ms.
Richards said. ``It's sort of like, `How do you get to Carnegie
Hall?' You just practice.'''
   Ms. Richards, who plans to seek the Texas governorship in 1990,
emerged over the weekend as the likely choice for the keynote job,
which offers a national audience to impress or disappoint. The only
other woman ever to have the role was former Rep. Barbara Jordan,
also of Texas, who shared the job with Sen. John Glenn of Ohio.
   Kirk said he was happy to announce that Ms. Richards would ``set
the tone for Democrats in Atlanta and to draw the distinctions
between the party of the working American people and the party of
the establishment. Ann Richards is a mainstream Democrat and a
fiery populist from Texas, one of George Bush's adopted states.''
   ``She has the ability to tell it like it is and speak in the
language ... working Americans can understand and relate to,'' he
added.
   Kirk was asked if the selection of another Texan for a prominent
role at the Atlanta meeting July 18-21 was indicative of the
importance of the state in the fall. House Speaker Jim Wright of
Texas is the convention chairman.
   ``In fact, when you look at the Electoral College map, you can't
do enough for Texas,'' Kirk said.
   Kirk defended Wright's role as chairman of the convention,
despite the investigations focusing on charges of unethical
behavior against the House speaker.
   ``There is no hesitancy on my part or on the part of the
Democratic Party about Speaker Wright's role at the convention,''
Kirk said.
   Kirk also announced the appointment of four co-chairmen for the
convention: Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin, Rep. Norman Mineta of
California, former New Mexico Gov. Toney Anaya and Little Rock,
Ark., Mayor Lottie Shackelford.
   Kirk said in answer to a question that he would be glad to serve
as Democratic National Committee chairman through the general
election, even though his term expires right after the convention.
But after the election, ``That will be that.''
   Ms. Richards was born on Sept. 1, 1933, outside of Waco, Texas.
A graduate of Baylor University, she was first elected to office as
a member of the Travis County Commissioner's Court in 1976. In
1982, she was elected state treasurer, the first woman to hold
statewide office there in over 50 years.
   She is a divorced mother of four grown children.
