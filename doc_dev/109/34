THE ONE cloud on President Bill Clinton's sunny inaugural week grew a little
larger yesterday as his nominee for attorney general, Ms Zoe Baird, faced
tough questioning from senators concerned that she had broken the law in
employing illegal aliens for her household.
Ms Baird repeated that she would not withdraw her nomination and said that
awareness of her own transgression would make her even more determined to
ensure that justice be dispensed equally. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the new White
House press secretary, said Mr Clinton stood by her and expected her to be
confirmed.
Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, the ranking Republican on the judiciary
committee, yesterday reiterated his support. So far only one member of the
committee, Senator Larry Pressler, the Republican from South Dakota, has
declared he will vote against confirmation.
But Mr Hatch also reported that his constituent mail was running heavily
against Ms Baird and yesterday she acquired another influential opponent in
the person of Ms Barbara Jordan, the black Texas University law professor
known for her high principles.
'The ethical high ground for Zoe Baird is to request that her name be
withdrawn,' Ms Jordan said. Earlier this week, Ms Patricia King, also black
and a Georgetown University law professor, had maintained in a powerful
Washington Post column that the nation's chief law enforcement officer could
not be someone who had recently broken the law.
Elsewhere, the new administration, if not the president himself, began to
get down to work. Mr Clinton was preoccupied with welcoming 2,500 guests to
a White House open day. But Mr Warren Christopher, confirmed on Wednesday as
secretary of state, talked to Mr Nelson Mandela of the African National
Congress.
