   Surgeons completed a rare double-lung
transplant operation on U.S. Rep. Floyd Spence of South Carolina
early today, officials at the University of Mississippi Medical
Center said.
   Spence, 60, was in critical but stable condition following the
5-hour surgery, which ended at 3 a.m., said hospital spokeswoman
Barbara Austin.
   Spence, suffering from chronic obstructive lung disease, flew to
Mississippi Friday afternoon from Columbia, S.C., after being
notified of a possible set of donor lungs in Texas.
   ``The transplant team said the surgery proceeded as
anticipated,'' Austin said. ``He'll remain in the hospital probably
four or five weeks to recuperate.''
   Members of the transplant team flew to Texas Friday afternoon
and returned late Friday night with the organs after determining
the lungs were in good enough shape to transplant, hospital
spokeswoman Janice Quinn said.
   Surgeons opened Spence's chest about an hour before the lungs
arrived at about 10:45 p.m., hospital officials said.
   Spence appeared alert and in good spirits as he was wheeled into
the hospital. The legislator's son, David Spence, said the family
was confident about the outcome of the operation.
   ``The surgeons are very optimistic about the condition of the
donor's lungs, with Floyd's physical condition and with his
tolerance to the operation,'' said Randy Mashburn, Spence's
district administrator. ``They are very upbeat.''
   At one point last October, Spence was put under intensive care
at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland in critical condition.
Afterward, the congressman went on the list of potential organ
transplant recipients.
   Double-lung transplants have been performed 30 times worldwide
and only 12 times in North America _ three times at Jackson and
nine times at Toronto General Hospital under the auspices of the
Toronto University School of Medicine.
   Eight of the Toronto patients are still living, but only one of
the three from Jackson remains alive. University Medical Center
officials attributed one of the two deaths to factors unrelated to
either the surgery or respiratory ailments that led to the
operations.
   Dr. Sesshadri Raju, professor of surgery and director of the
transplant program at Jackson, said last month that with a normal
recovery, Spence would be able to resume a normal schedule after
six months with ``surprisingly'' few physical restrictions.
   Confined at times to a wheelchair and occasionally in need of
oxygen, Spence has made few public appearances since his October
hospitalization.
   However, he has filed for re-election. The nine-term Republican
will face Democrat Jim Leventis in the November election.
