   Sen. Phil Gramm said Wednesday he will offer
the nation a glimpse of George Bush's ``vision of America'' when he
gives the nominating speech for Bush at the Republican National
Convention.
   Gramm is the latest Texan to come to the fore as both parties
battle for the Lone Star State's 29 electoral votes in the November
election.
   The state's senior senator, Lloyd Bentsen, is the Democratic
nominee for vice president; Bush is an adopted Texan who calls
Houston home, and at the Democratic National Convention, Texas
state Treasurer Ann Richards gave the keynote address, Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower spoke during prime time, and former Rep.
Barbara Jordan seconded Bentsen's nomination.
   ``It is a great opportunity for me to talk about the vice
president, about his service to America, which ranges over almost
half a century _ from his days as a naval pilot flying off the
(USS) San Jacinto to being the greatest vice president we've ever
had,'' said the junior senator from Texas.
   In his speech in two weeks in New Orleans, he said, he plans to
``really remind people what the world was like that cold day in
January when Ronald Reagan and George Bush took the oath of office
... their proud record and what they've achieved.''
   He will contrast those accomplishments to the record of
Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, he indicated.
   Gramm was a Democratic representative when Reagan and Bush took
office in 1981. He resigned his seat in 1983, then immediately won
it back as a Republican. He was elected to the Senate the next year.
   He was orginally scheduled to give a prime-time address with
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole during the convention, and the two
were to have compared Democratic and Republican positions on a wide
range of issues.
   ``My role has been upgraded since then,'' Gramm said Wednesday.
``The vice president called me yesterday and asked me to give the
nominating speech. Obviously, I was very honored to be asked. It's
a great opportunity.''
   Gramm said he was on a trip to the Soviet Union during the
Democratic National Convention.
   ``I wanted to see what the Democratic plank would be like if it
were fulfilled so I was looking at the Soviet economy,'' Gramm said.
