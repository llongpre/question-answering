   Sen. Phil Gramm said today he will give the
nominating speech for George Bush at the Republican National
Convention, underscoring the importance of Texas in the November
election.
   Gramm said he would talk about what the country and world were
like ``that cold day in January when Ronald Reagan and George Bush
took the oath of office, their proud record and what they've
achieved.''
   Gramm was a Democratic representative when Reagan and Bush took
office in 1981. He resigned his seat in 1983, then immediately won
it back as a Republican. He was elected to the Senate the next year.
   The junior senator from Texas said he would also compare the
record of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis with Bush
and would speak of the vice president's ``lifetime of service,
Bush's vision of America.''
   Texans also played key roles in the Democratic National
Convention in Atlanta last month, with state Treasurer Ann Richards
giving the keynote address and former Rep. Barbara Jordan seconding
the nomination of the state's senior senator, Lloyd Bentsen, for
vice president.
   Gramm was orginally scheduled to give a prime-time address with
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole during the convention, and the two
were to have compared Democratic and Republican positions on a wide
range of issues.
   ``My role has been upgraded since then,'' Gramm said today.
``The vice president called me yesterday and asked me to give the
nominating speech. Obviously, I was very honored to be asked. It's
a great opportunity. I believe in George Bush. I believe he's the
greatest vice president we've ever had.
   Gramm said he was on a trip to the Soviet Union during the
Democratic National Convention and missed Arkansas Gov. Bill
Clinton's lengthy nominating speech for Dukakis.
   ``I wanted to see what the Democratic plank would be like if it
were fulfilled so I was looking at the Soviet economy,'' Gramm said.
   Gramm said he has no doubt the Republicans will carry Texas with
its 29 electoral votes.
   His fellow Texas senator would not agree, he said, ``but he has
a vested interest and I don't.''
