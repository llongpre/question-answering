   The second of five children wounded in a
school shooting rampage by a babysitter was released from the
hospital Friday, as authorities continued their investigation into
the assailant's background.
   No new information has emerged in the probe of 30-year-old
Laurie Dann, who fatally shot herself after killing one youngster
and injuring six other people May 20 in this wealthy Chicago
suburb, said Police Sgt. Gene Kalvaitis.
   Toxicology reports have turned up no evidence of drugs in her
system, but complete findings will not be available until the end
of next week, said Cook County Medical Examiner Dr. Robert Stein.
   Six-year-old Robert Trossman, who was shot in the chest by Ms.
Dann in a bathroom at Hubbard Woods School, was released Friday
morning from Evanston Hospital, said spokeswoman Barbara Traeger.
   The child most critically injured when Ms. Dann opened fire in a
classroom, 8-year-old Lindsay Fisher, was upgraded from fair to
good condition a day after being to a regular pediatric ward, Ms.
Traeger said.
   The first shooting victim to be released from the hospital went
home Thursday.
   One other injured youngster at Evanston Hospital was in good
condtion, while the two other people who were injured were reported
in fair condition at Highland Park Hospital, said a spokeswoman
there, Sue Masarrachia.
   No information was released Friday about a friend of Ms. Dann's
who was arrested Thursday for allegedly making threatening
telephone calls similar to those Ms. Dann made in the weeks before
the shooting spree.
   Sheri L. Taylor, 34, of Highland Park, was committed
involuntarily Thursday to psychiatric treatment at
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, but spokeswoman Debbie
Jenkins said no update would be made until next week.
   Documents filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court showed Ms.
Taylor had signed for voluntary admission to the hospital's
psychiatric unit, agreeing to stay if necessary up to 30 days, when
she will be reevaluated.
   Police said Ms. Taylor was taken into custody late Wednesday at
the Highwood convenience store where she worked. Ms. Taylor later
surrendered a .357 Magnum handgun she kept in the hotel room where
she lived.
   The FBI in Madison, Wis., where Ms. Dann had been living, has
said she apparently acted alone in obtaining poison she used to
lace about two dozen packages of snacks and juice that she sent or
delivered to acquaintances before last week's shooting spree.
   No one was seriously sickened.
