   At least two bystanders failed to help two
toddlers found floating face down in an apartment swimming pool, and
a fire department official said he was baffled by their inaction.
   ``Anybody in their right mind _ you'd think they would, but they
didn't,'' said Capt. C.A. Beasley.
   Beasley said two men stood by while Taffidie McGough, 2, and her
15-month-old half-sister, Tiffidie Anne, were rescued from the pool.
   Tiffidie Anne was found floating face down in the shallow end of
the pool and was declared dead at the scene.
   Taffidie was on the bottom of the pool near her sister. She
didn't show a pulse but was revived en route to the hospital,
officials said. She remains in critical condition and on life
support systems at Texas Children's Hospital, spokeswoman Tina
Foster said.
   One man told Beasley there appeared to be ``dolls or dogs'' in
the pool.
   ``Regardless of what they thought they were,'' Beasley said. ``I
can't imagine anybody standing there looking at two kids in the
pool. They would be better off out of the pool no matter what.''
   District Attorney John B. Holmes said there are no criminal
sanctions for failing to rescue the children.
   ``But common sense suggests that no caring, thinking human being
would stand handily by while two kids were drowning,'' he said.
   The girls apparently left their apartment Sunday morning while
their mother slept and wandered into the pool.
   The girls' mother, Tammie Patterson, 20, said she learned her
children had fallen into the pool when an unidentified man knocked
on her door.
   ``I don't understand why they didn't'' try to save the children,
said Ms. Patterson.
   ``It's too late,'' she said. ``I've got one baby that's dead and
one baby who's fighting for her life.''
