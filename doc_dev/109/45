   Here is a transcript of the speech delivered by
former Rep. Barbara Jordan of Texas seconding the nomination of
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas for vice president at the Democratic
National Convention on Thursday night.
   Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.
   Thank you. That is quite a greeting.
   We engaged in an important task at a very important time. We are
positioning ourselves for the last decade of the twentieth century.
   Our minds are turning away from, Hooray for Hollywood. And our
minds _ and we are now confronting the hard reality of a nation
which desires to become solvent again.
   Competitive again. A nation which desires to have the trust of
its allies and its compatriots. We want _ we want to retake the
moral high ground. Now, to be what we want to be, to become the
people we want to become, we have to be moved to action by what is
reasonable, sensible, logical and rational.
   Lloyd Bentsen is a sensible, logical and rational choice for
vice president of the United States.
   You know, the people who founded America were very smart. Those
founders warned us not to become overcome by factions, but to rely
on reason as our guide. If we rely on reason as our guide, reason
will temper and tender our emotions.
   Reason will help us to do the right things. Reason will tutor us
toward doing the right things.
   I say that Lloyd Bentsen is a rational and sensible and
reasonable choice.
   Why?
   First of all, he's my senator. And I wasn't planning to come to
this convention for any purpose. But when Lloyd Bentsen was tapped
by Michael Dukakis as his choice for vice president of the United
States, I knew that if Lloyd Bentsen wanted me to come and second
his nomination, I could not resist doing that, and I'm here to do
it tonight.
   You know, Lloyd Bentsen has been in the United States Senate for
almost eighteen years. Lloyd Bentsen is a man who has an instinct
for doing what is right. Lloyd Bentsen does not have to be
pressured and lobbied to do the right thing.
   Now, Robert Bork _ Lloyd Bentsen voted no on that nomination.
And do you know what: Lloyd Bentsen didn't have to be pressured
into voting no for Bork.
   He said _ Lloyd Bentsen: ``Bork will put our civil rights and
our civil liberties at risk, and we cannot afford to do that, and
that's why I vote no.''
   You heard then Rostenkowski tell you about Bentsen's service on
the Finance Committee and now as chairman on the Finance Committee.
Do you realize that the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over
practically everything that affects our lives, the lives of each
and every one of us.
   Lloyd Bentsen is patient and he managed legislation, the trade
legislation involving 24 committees of the House and the Senate,
meeting over eight months, Lloyd Bentsen was patient and moved it
through. Now, the president vetoed it, but Lloyd Bentsen got the
momentum for trade legislation going, and that momentum will not
dissipate lightly.
