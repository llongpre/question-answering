   Barbara Bush said Tuesday she is keeping
silent on abortion because speaking out would create controversy
``whichever way I go,'' and detract from her work on illiteracy,
the homeless, hunger and AIDS.
   ``I think that should be left to the people who are courageous
enough, number one to run for office, and number two who can do
something about it,'' she told three reporters at a White House
reception for disabled award winners.
   Asked about the focus on abortion in recent elections _ notably
the governor's races Tuesday in New Jersey and Virginia _ she said
that she is not a ``single-issue'' person and indicated voters
should look at other factors instead of the abortion matter.
   ``I think people ought to be thinking about fiscal
responsibility and past records and ... looking at the man as a
whole or the woman as a whole,'' she said. ``I'm not a single issue
man or woman,'' she said.
   President Bush told a news conference Tuesday that he believes
Americans do not vote on the single issue of abortion. He recently
vetoed legislation that would have allowed federal funds to be
spent for abortions for poor victims of rape or incest.
   Asked why she will not give her own position on abortion, which
has become an increasingly polarizing issue in the wake of the
Supreme Court's July decision giving states greater leeway to
restrict it, Mrs. Bush said: ``It does nothing but cause
controversy whichever way I go. I want people to be interested in
my projects,'' such as working for literacy and the homeless.
   Mrs. Bush announced in February that she would not speak out on
controversial policy issues, after she told a reporter that she
favored a ban on semi-automatic weapons, putting her in conflict
with her husband's public position.
   The first lady has spoken out on some issues of concern to
teen-age women, and says, ``We need a lot of education, to tell
these girls that there are opportunities out there for them, that
the door will be closed if they go ahead and have babies. It's very
old fashioned, I know.''
   After the Supreme Court in July gave states expanded powers to
restrict abortion, Bush lauded the ruling and Mrs. Bush said only,
``I go with my president.''
   Mrs. Bush also said that she would like to go to the
Mediterranean superpower summit next month if Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, also goes.
   She said it had not been decided if she would go, but that ``I'm
one who loves to travel.''
   On another issue, Mrs. Bush said her eyes are still irritated
from the thyroid condition she suffers known as Graves Disease.
   She said the steroid she has been prescribed to treat the
ailment, prednisone, has made her gain back some of the weight she
lost earlier in the year.
   ``I'm fighting a small problem, weight,'' she conceded, adding
that she swims a mile a day to keep in shape.
   Then she chided herself for complaining about her medication at
an event designed to honor people who have overcome major
disabilities.
   ``Of all the places in America to complain about taking
prednisone, this is not the party to complain about it,'' she said
as she stood among several wheelchair-bound award recipients.
   The 1989 Victory Awards were bestowed by the National
Rehabilitation Hospital to people who overcame physical obstacles
while making contributions to society.
   Among the award recipients were one chosen by the governor of
each state, and several selected by the National Rehabilitation
Hospital, a private 160-bed institution in Washington.
   This year's recipients included: country singer Barbara
Mandrell, who suffered a near fatal car accident in 1984; Latin
singer Julio Iglesias who recovered from spinal-chord paralysis
after a car accident at age 20; Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, who
lost his right arm during World War II; Joni Eareckson Tada, an
internationally recognized artist who is paralyzed from the
shoulders down from a diving accident and draws with a pencil held
in her teeth; Skip Wilkins, a wheelchair-bound athlete who works as
a counselor to troubled teen-agers and and Bill Demby, a disabled
track and field athlete and professional counselor who lost both
legs in the Vietnam War.
