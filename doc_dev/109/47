   Barbara Bush says an enormous rat swam by her in
the White House pool recently but President Bush came to her rescue
and ``drowned the beast.''
   The rat she encountered in the incident several months ago ``did
not look like a Walt Disney friend, I'll tell you that,'' she said
in an interview published by newspapers in Houston and San Antonio
on Tuesday.
   Mrs. Bush, who was back in Texas for the economic summit, said
her husband came to her aid at the outdoor pool.
   ``I swim with a mask, so as it went right by in front of me _ I
mean, it was enormous,'' said Mrs. Bush, a mile-a-day swimmer.
``Fortunately, George Bush was there and drowned the beast. It was
horrible.''
   The White House grounds attract rats, she said, ``because we're
surrounded by parks and people drop food.''
   Or, she theorized it was an effort to get rid of the rodents
that may have led this one to find its way into the White House
pool.
   ``They put some stuff out that only bothered rats, and what it
did is make them very, very thirsty. And this rat went for the
biggest water it saw,'' she explained.
   She also credited her English springer spaniel Millie with
helping reduce the local rat population.
   For a long time afterward, she said, she insisted that her
guards check to make sure there wasn't a rat ``in hiding'' before
she entered the pool.
   On another subject, she said her husband was ``absolutely
exhausted'' when he got to Houston Friday night from the NATO
summit in London. But she added that they have both been delighted
by the warm reception Houstonians have given their international
guests.
   After viewing the friendly crowds along a motorcade route to
Rice University, ``I told George that this is the first time I've
gone that far in a car back and forth where everybody waved and no
unfriendly gestures,'' she said.
   She said Houston's heat was not too much for the summit spouses.
   ``All of these ladies have been in hot places before,'' she
said. ``I've been to Malaysia on state trips and you just learn to
glow in public. ... How much are they outdoors? Nothing. Twenty
minutes at the most.''
   Mrs. Bush took several of the spouses to San Antonio on Tuesday
for a tour of the Alamo and other sights.
   The White House released a full transcript of Mrs. Bush's
interview Monday by the Houston Chronicle, the Houston Post, the
San Antonio Light and the San Antonio Express News.
