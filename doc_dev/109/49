   First Lady Barbara Bush says she once encountered
a rat in the White House swimming pool.
   ``It did not look like a Walt Disney rat, I'll tell you that,''
Mrs. Bush told the Houston Post in an interview published today.
``I was out of that pool so much faster than I thought I could.''
   Mrs. Bush, who swims daily for exercise in the heated pool, said
President Bush came to her rescue during the incident a few months
ago.
   ``I swim with a mask, and it just went right by in front of
me,'' she said. ``Fortunately, George Bush was there and drowned
the beast. It was horrible.''
   Mrs. Bush said the confrontation with the rat was the worst
experience of her 18 month in the White House.
   The first lady planned to take the wives of other heads of
government attending the seven-nation economic summit on a tour of
the Alamo and other historical sites at San Antonio, Texas.
   Noting the friendly crowds that greeted the Bush motorcade
Monday at the start of the summit talks, Mrs. Bush said, ``I told
George this was the first time I've gone that far in a car ... when
everybody waved and there were no unfriendly gestures.''
   ``It's so wonderful,'' she said. ``George is tickled pink.''
   Mrs. Bush said she and her husband agree that foreign visitors
should see more than the East and West coasts of the United States.
   The president told Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney at a
presummit social event last weekend that ``America is not the
coasts. This is America,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``Well, it is. This is
what you want people to see.''
