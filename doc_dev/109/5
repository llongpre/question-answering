   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan,
hospitalized after nearly drowning, talked politics over breakfast
Wednesday, a hospital spokeswoman said.
   Carolyn Hinckley Boyle said doctors described Ms. Jordan, 52, as
doing ``better _ much stronger, more cheerful.''
   Brackenridge Hospital listed Ms. Jordan in serious but stable
condition, which was unchanged.
   Ms. Jordan underwent tests Tuesday, including brain and chest
X-rays, as well a heart examination known as an echo cardiogram,
Ms. Boyle said.
   Nurse Greg Pfahles quoted Ms. Jordan as saying about the
Democratic presidential ticket, ``This is our year.''
   Ms. Boyle said Pfahles found Ms. Jordan ``fiesty and spunky but
a very pleasant and cooperative patient.''
   Ms. Jordan was hospitalized Saturday after being found floating
face-down in her backyard pool.
   In 1966, she became the first black state senator in Texas
history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to
Congress since Reconstruction, serving until 1978, when she left
politics after three terms in the House to teach at the University
of Texas Lyndon B. School of Public Affairs.
