   Stage and screen producer Mary Lea Johnson
Richards, who with her siblings contested the will of their father,
Johnson &amp; Johnson heir J. Seward Johnson, has died at age 63.
   Ms. Johnson died Thursday at Presbyterian-University Hospital in
Pittsburgh, where she recently underwent a liver transplant,
hospital spokesman Frank Raczkiewicz said.
   Ms. Johnson, who used her maiden name, lived in New York.
   She and her husband, Martin Richards, formed The Producer Circle
Co. in 1976 with Robert Fryer and James Cresson.
   The company's stage shows won 22 Tony Awards and a Pulitzer
Prize and included ``Sweeney Todd,'' ``Crimes of the Heart,'' ``La
Cage Aux Folles'' and ``Foxfire.'' Their films included ``The Boys
From Brazil,'' ``The Shining,'' and ``Fort Apache, the Bronx.''
   Ms. Johnson was born in New Brunswick, N.J., the eldest of six
children of the heir to the pharmaceutical fortune.
   In a bitter, three-year court battle, she and her siblings
contested the will in which their father left nearly his entire
estate to his third wife, Polish-born Barbara Piasecka-Johnson.
   The children also claimed their father was not mentally
competent when he signed the will in 1983, a few weeks before his
death at age 87.
   J. Seward Johnson had said he cut his children out of his will
``not for any lack of affection'' but because he set up
multimillion dollar trust funds for them in 1944.
   A day before the case was to go to a jury in 1986, the children
agreed to a settlement that gave them a total $42.5 million, plus
$20 million to the Harbor Branch Foundation, a Florida
oceanographic institute founded by their father. Barbara
Piasecka-Johnson got $300 million in the settlement.
   Piasecka-Johnson last year offered to invest $100 million in the
Lenin shipyard in Gdansk, Poland, where the Solidarity trade union
was born. That deal has failed to move forward, however.
   Besides her husband, Mary Lea Johnson is survived by her
siblings, J. Seward Johnson Jr., Elaine Wold, Diana Firestone,
James Johnson and Jennifer Johnson Duke; six children, Eric,
Seward, Roderick, Hillary, Alice and Quentin; and nine
grandchildren.
