   Ten people protesting the removal of a
feeding tube from Nancy Cruzan were forcibly removed from a
hospital Wednesday and outside doors to the building were locked as
demonstrations continued outside.
   Ms. Cruzan's condition deteriorated in the fifth day since a
feeding tube was removed Friday, said Barbara Shoun, a spokeswoman
for the Missouri Rehabilitation Center.
   Her parents fought lengthy legal battles before winning the
right to remove the feeding tube in the first right-to-die case
decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. They contend their daughter
would not want to live in her present state.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, has been in a persistent vegetative state since
a 1983 car accident.
   A leader in the anti-abortion movement was on his way to this
southwest Missouri town in an attempt to meet with the parents to
try to persuade them ``not to kill their daughter.''
   Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, was expected to
arrive in Mount Vernon by Thursday, said Bob Jewitt, an Operation
Rescue spokesman in Atlanta.
   ``This may be the most important story in the pro-life
history,'' Jewitt said. ``This woman is not in a persistent
vegetative state. She is not a carrot. She's a human being with
blood in her veins and she must be saved.''
   Joe and Joyce Cruzan will not meet with Terry, said their
attorney, William Colby.
   ``They had an auto accident that took their daughter and they
were faced with two horrible decisions and now somebody they love
very much is dying,'' Colby said.
   ``There is enough pain from the auto accident that to compound
that by having a group of strangers who never knew Nancy
interfering with the medical decisions is inappropriate,'' he said.
   About 20 demonstrators gathered at the hospital Wednesday and
some were allowed into the hospital chapel. Some then demanded to
meet with the center's director and went to his office and began
kneeling and praying and refusing to leave, Mrs. Shoun said.
   About eight or 10 of the demonstrators were put in wheelchairs
and pushed out of the building. Others were told to leave and did
so, Mrs. Shoun said.
   ``We've told groups that want to protest that they're welcome to
come - as long as they stay outside,'' Mrs. Shoun said.
   About a half-dozen protesters camped on the front steps
Wednesday afternoon, kneeling and praying. One held a sign that
said ``Please feed Nancy.''
   Authorities arrested 19 people Tuesday who were held in the
Lawrence County Jail on $500 bond. All identified themselves as
Nancy Cruzan and the sheriff's department said they could not be
bonded out until they gave their real names.
   All but one was fasting.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that Missouri could require
``clear and convincing'' evidence that Ms. Cruzan would want to
die.
   The Cruzans went back to local court where three friends and
co-workers of Ms. Cruzan testified they had talked about such a
situation and Ms. Cruzan had indicated she would want to die.
   Probate Judge Charles Peel ruled Friday there was sufficient
evidence to allow the tube to be removed.
