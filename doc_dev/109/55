   Firefighters gained ground against
an arson fire that destroyed more than 400 homes and killed two
people.
   Most of the brush fires that have scorched more than 20,000
acres in six Southern California counties over three days headed
toward control or containment early today, authorities said.
   Property losses in Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside and San Diego counties have been estimated at
more than $280 million. But one official said damage in Santa
Barbara alone could reach $500 million.
   The deaths of a Santa Barbara County woman and an
inmate-firefighter were reported Friday, the first caused by the
fires that started Wednesday.
   ``Whoever started this fire is, in my opinion, not only a
terrorist, but a murderer,'' said Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, whose
district includes Santa Barbara.
   Authorities have recovered an incendiary device in San Marcos
Pass that they believe started the blaze, but have declined to
provide further details. The New York Times reported firefighters
found a match in the field where the blaze began.
   Rewards totaling more than $150,000 have been offered for
information leading to the arrests and convictions of the arsonists.
   Elsewhere across the West:
   _Officials said a fire started by lightning in Arizona's Tonto
National Forest should be contained by tonight. It has burned
nearly 25,000 acres and 50 homes and killed six firefighters.
   _A 4,020-acre blaze in Guadalupe Mountains National Park in
Texas gained strength with rising winds, and showed no immediate
signs of abating.
   _Colorado firefighters battled three fires covering 4,200 acres,
including a 3,500-acre fire in the Uncompahgre National Forest that
officials said was about 50 percent contained.
   Brush fires also burned this week in Montana, New Mexico and
Utah.
   Flames from the 4,900-acre Santa Barbara fire still burned along
the crest of the Santa Ynez Mountains on Friday night, but U.S.
Forest Service spokeswoman Juanita Freel said onshore breezes
should help firefighters to contain the blaze by this afternoon.
   ``The temperatures are coming down. The humidity is up,'' said
Santa Barbara County Fire Marshal William Bennett. ``That's good
news for us firefighters.''
   State and local officials sought President Bush's approval for
federal disaster aid for the Santa Barbara and Glendale areas.
   The body of Andrea Gurka, 37, was found Friday in a creek bed
behind her home in the San Marcos Pass area where the fire started.
Because the fire was arson-caused, her death is considered a
homicide.
   An inmate-firefighter died Thursday of burns from a blaze in
Riverside County near Hemet, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles.
Victor Ferrara, 22, was burned when his crew was overrun by
wind-driven flames in the now-controlled fire.
   Of the 15 other firefighters injured fighting the 150-acre
blaze, one remained in critical condition.
   More than $240 million damage to structures was caused by the
fire, said Frank Breckenridge, a county building official. He said
438 homes, 28 apartment buildings, 10 businesses and four public
buildings were destroyed in Santa Barbara County.
   The damage figures could ultimately top $500 million, said
county Supervisor Bill Wallace.
   Firefighters surrounded 60 percent of a 4,500-acre wildfire in
Corona in Riverside County on Friday, but not before it destroyed
eight homes.
   A 2,500-acre blaze near Lake Henshaw in San Diego County
continued to burn out of control. The blaze forced evacuation of a
Boy Scout camp and 20 homes.
   In Glendale, a 350-acre arson-linked fire that was contained
Friday destroyed 46 homes and damaged 26 others, causing an
estimated $30 million to $40 million in damage.
   Firefighters contained an arson blaze in the Carbon Canyon area
of San Bernardino County that blackened 6,640 acres and destroyed
14 homes.
   A man described as a transient was arrested for investigation of
arson in the Carbon Canyon blaze. A judge Friday ordered Peter Diaz
Reyes, 29, to undergo psychiatric evaluation, delaying his
arraignment.
