   The Missouri Supreme Court today turned
down a request to resume food and water for Nancy Cruzan, while
demonstrators camped on a hospital's steps to protest removal of
the comatose woman's feeding tube.
   The court rejected a plea by an anti-euthanasia group that state
officials be forced to provide nourishment to Ms. Cruzan, whose
condition was deteriorating six days after the tube was removed.
   The court's two-sentence order issued at Jefferson City was
signed by Judge Edward Robertson. He wrote the court's November
1988 decision that denied a request by Ms. Cruzan's family to halt
her food and water.
   That 1988 ruling sent the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which
ruled in June in its first right-to-die case that Missouri could
require ``clear and convincing'' evidence that Ms. Cruzan would
want to die.
   The request to resume feeding was filed by attorney Mario
Mandina of Lawyers for Life. It listed a Kansas City woman, Yvette
Williams, as the plaintiff.
   ``Nancy can receive love. From what I've been told, she responds
to her nurses. She can follow people with her eyes. I care for four
kids who can't track people with their eyes. That does not mean we
should kill them,'' said Ms. Williams, a 27-year-old graphic artist
who works part-time at a mental retardation center. She was quoted
in The Joplin Globe today.
   Joining her quest this morning was Randall Terry, founder of the
anti-abortion group Operation Rescue. He arrived at the
rehabilitation hospital and was trying to meet with Ms. Cruzan's
parents, a spokesman said.
   Joe and Joyce Cruzan will not meet with Terry, their lawyer,
attorney, William Colby, said.
   ``There is enough pain from the auto accident that to compound
that by having a group of strangers who never knew Nancy
interfering with the medical decisions is inappropriate,'' the
lawyer said.
   The Cruzans contend their 33-year-old daughter would not want to
live in the persistent vegetative state she has experienced since a
1983 car accident.
   After the U.S. Supreme Court set the standard of ``clear and
convincing'' evidence, the Cruzans went back to local court. There,
three of Ms. Cruzan's co-workers testified they had talked about
such a situation and Ms. Cruzan had indicated she would want to
die.
   Probate Judge Charles Teel ruled Friday sufficient evidence
existed to allow the tube to be removed.
   Ms. Cruzan's condition went from stable to deteriorating on
Wednesday, rehabilitation center spokeswoman Barbara Shoun said.
Doctors expected her to live a week or two after the tube was
removed Friday.
   About a dozen people, wrapped in thin blankets and sleeping
bags, camped out overnight on the state hospital steps in this
southwest Missouri town.
   ``We're calling upon people from around the country to come and
camp out and stand with Nancy Cruzan at the hour of her death,''
said the Rev. Matt Trewhella, a minister from Milwaukee.
   Police banned demonstrators from the building after 10 of them
refused to leave the director's office and a hallway Wednesday.
They ``flopped out on the ground'' and refused to move so police
pushed them out the main entrance in wheelchairs, Mrs. Shoun said.
   No one was arrested.
   About 25 to 30 police officers patrolled the rehabilitation
center and stood guard outside Ms. Cruzan's second-floor room,
authorities said.
   Nineteen people arrested Tuesday for trespassing and illegal
assembly remained jailed on $1,000 bond each. All assumed the name
Nancy Cruzan and police said they could not post bail until they
gave their real names. All but one was fasting.
