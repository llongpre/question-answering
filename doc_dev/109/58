THE ONE cloud on President Bill Clinton's sunny inaugural week grew a little
larger yesterday as his nominee for attorney general, Ms Zoe Baird, faced
tough questioning from senators concerned she had broken the law in
employing illegal aliens for her household.
Ms Baird repeated that she would not withdraw her nomination and said that
awareness of her own transgression would make her even more determined to
ensure that justice be dispensed equally. Ms Dee Dee Myers, the new White
House press secretary, said Mr Clinton stood by her and expected her to be
confirmed.
Senator Orrin Hatch, of Utah, the ranking Republican on the judiciary
committee, yesterday reiterated his support. So far only one member of the
committee, Senator Larry Pressler, the Republican from South Dakota, has
declared he will vote against confirmation. Another Republican, Senator
Nancy Kassebaum from Kansas, not on the committee, also said she would vote
against.
Mr Hatch said his constituent mail was running heavily against Ms Baird and
yesterday she acquired another influential opponent in the person of Ms
Barbara Jordan, the black Texas University law professor known for her high
principles.
