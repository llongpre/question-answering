<HEADLINE>  FIRST LADY BREAKS LEG ON SLED; TREE'S FINE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Mrs. Bush "was going down a hill that was very icy" on a plastic inner
tube-type sled, spokeswoman Anna Perez said.;    "She doesn't know why she
didn't bail out. She just held on and the next thing she knew, there was the
tree.";    A presidential doctor, Lawrence Mohr, checked her cuts and bruises
and sent her off by ambulance to a Hagerstown, Md., hospital, where X-rays
revealed "a non-displaced fracture of the left fibula bone," the White House
said.;    The break was not severe enough to require a cast, but the doctors
ordered the first lady not to put any weight on her left leg for several
days.;    Mrs. Bush had gone sledding with President Bush, several
grandchildren and guests, including actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, at the
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.;    Schwarzenegger, the former Mr.
Universe who is head of the President's Council on Physical Fitness, was a
weekend guest at Camp David with his wife, journalist Maria Shriver, and their
baby daughter.;    The fracture would take five to six weeks to heal, Perez
said, adding that Mrs. Bush was experiencing some pain but did not require
medication.;    The Bushes appeared to be making light of the situation as the
first lady was carried off the Marine One helicopter and transferred to a
second wheelchair. Mrs. Bush had a blanket draped over her lap. She took a
playful poke at her husband for something he said.;    On the way to the
mansion, Bush replied to a tongue-in-cheek question that there was "no damage
to the tree.";    Asked if the leg hurt, Mrs. Bush shook her head no, while
the president said, "Smarts a little.";    "Easy for him to say," the first
lady snapped.;    Mrs. Bush had gone down the same hill without incident
earlier Sunday and several times Saturday, her spokeswoman said. Bush, too,
had been sledding, but not at the moment the accident occurred, she said.;   
Four of the dozen Bush grandchildren were at Camp David for the weekend.
Daughter Dorothy LeBlond was there with her children, Sam, 6, and Ellie, 4,
and daughter-in-law Margaret Bush was there with daughter Marshall, 4, and son
Charles Walker, 1.  </TEXT>
