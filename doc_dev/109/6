   Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan was in fair
condition Tuesday at St. David's Hospital, where she was undergoing
treatment for a urinary infection, a spokeswoman said.
   ``She is improving,'' said Jan McCrory, assistant vice president
for public relations at the hospital. Ms. Jordan probably would
remain hospitalized for several days to a week, she said.
   Ms. Jordan, 53, was admitted Monday afternoon with a urinary
tract infection, Ms. McCrory said.
   Ms. Jordan has a form of multiple sclerosis and uses a
wheelchair. Last year, she was hospitalized after she nearly drowned
in her backyard swimming pool.
