   The congressional seat left vacant by the death
of Democrat Mickey Leland in a plane crash in Ethiopia will be
filled in a special election.
   Gov. Bill Clements can choose the next ``uniform election
date,'' Nov. 7, for the election to fill the downtown Houston seat
Leland held since 1979, or he can declare an emergency and hold one
sooner, said Clements' press secretary.
   Wreckage of a plane carrying Leland and 15 others to a refugee
camp in Ethiopia was discovered Sunday on a mountainside 100 miles
from the traveling party's destination. Pentagon officials believe
there were no survivors.
   The 18th Congressional District is a varied area that includes
one of the city's poorest slums but also middle-income
neighborhoods.
   Some 70 percent of residents are either black or Hispanic.
   They have a tradition of voting solidly Democratic, electing
Barbara Jordan to office before turning to Leland when Ms. Jordan
decided to retire in 1978.
   The special election would be the second this year to fill a
Texas congressional seat. Balloting Saturday to choose a successor
to former House Speaker Jim Wright failed to produce a clear
winner, and a runoff will be held.
