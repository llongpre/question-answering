   Barbara Bush says she feels fine after a
radioactive thyroid treatment and will continue life as usual
except that she can't hold her grandchildren or puppies in her lap
or kiss anyone for 72 hours.
   Looking fit after a reception with the Queen of Sweden, Mrs.
Bush told reporters Wednesday, ``I feel wonderful.'
   That morning the first lady underwent a common procedure for her
recently diagnosed Graves disease. She drank a radioactive iodine
solution to deactivate her thyroid gland, which was producing
excess levels of hormones.
   Talking to a handful of reporters after standing in a half-hour
receiving line and speaking at the reception, she complained that
news coverage of her health was overshadowing the issues she wanted
to focus on, such as Queen's Silvia's work on behalf of the
disabled.
   ``Will you stop it?'' she implored the reporters.
   She jokingly pretended to be infirm, staggering up to the
reporters and leaning on the arm of her press secretary. Then she
told the group, ``I could Indian wrestle any one of you to the
ground.''
   She said she swam a mile Thursday and Monday and played tennis
on Wednesday, and hoped to keep exercising to keep off the 21
pounds that the disease had caused her to lose.
   In reference to the weight loss, she said, ``I like half of my
disease. In fact I love half of it.''
   She said she had wanted to wear an eye patch or arrive in a
wheelchair just to tweak the press, but her press secretary nixed
the prank.
   During a two-hour visit to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Mrs.
Bush sipped the radioactive solution through a straw, and said it
tasted like water.
   She also had her eyes examined and they were found to have no
damage from the disease, which had caused some eye irritation, she
said.
   Her condition can cause the eyes to keep opening and water, ``so
it looks weird,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   She anticipates no aftereffects from the radiation treatment,
except an eventual slight neck pain, she said. The doctors also
told her not to hold her dog's new puppies or her 11 grandchildren
for 72 hours, because their thyroids are small and more susceptible
to any effects of radiation.
   Mrs. Bush said doctors led her to believe that was just a
precaution and may have been ``almost an old wives tale.''
   The Bushes canceled a weekend trip to Kennebunkport, Maine, but
aides said it was unrelated to Mrs. Bush's condition, resulting
instead from visits by family members to Washington this weekend,
as well as the president's desire to stick around while budget
talks are nearing conclusion with Congress.
   Mrs. Bush's press secretary Anna Perez said the first lady joked
throughout her visit to the hospital.
   After the radiation treatment takes effect and deactivates her
thyroid gland, probably in two to three months, Mrs. Bush will have
to take daily medication to maintain adequate hormone levels, said
Ms. Perez.
   For several weeks, Mrs. Bush has been taking methimazole to
block production of excess hormones and will continue to take it
until blood levels of thyroid hormones fall below normal levels.
   She then will switch to a thyroid hormone replacement
supplement, Ms. Perez said.
