<LEADPARA>  With the guns newly silenced in the Persian Gulf, President Bush is gearing up
to hit the road again, free of the war preoccupations that tethered him to the
White House.;    Even though the president said "this is not a time for
euphoria" when he declared victory in the gulf war Wednesday night, he won't
have to try hard to capitalize on his success.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     According to polls released today, Bush won approval ratings of 91 percent
and 85 percent, more than any other president since polls have been taken.;   
USA Today came up with the 91 percent rating; the NBC News-Wall Street Journal
poll arrived at the 85 percent figure.;    Since the taking of modern opinion
polls, only President Truman came close to Bush. A Gallup Poll taken in June
1945, just weeks after Germany's surrender in World War II, registered an 87
percent approval rating for Truman.;    Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., acknowledged the
president's popularity in the aftermath of the war. "In this case, he deserves
a lot of credit," Nunn said today on NBC. "And whatever the results
politically, I think it's good for our nation."; A JUBILANT BARBARA BUSH SAYS
IT'S TIME TO GO FISHIN'; Fort Meade, Md. --;    Barbara Bush celebrated the
apparent end of the Persian Gulf war with military families Thursday and said
it's time for her husband to go fishing.;    "I hope he'll get a little sun,
get a little fishing and get a little rest, because his job is 24 hours a day,
seven days a week," she told reporters after addressing a gym packed with
nearly 2,000 GIs, family members and civilian defense workers.;    Mrs. Bush
also paid a warm tribute to the field general who humbled Saddam Hussein's
army.;    "How about that Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf?" she asked to cheers.
"He's sort of like a cross between General Patton and Fozzy Bear. I think he's
got all our hearts." Fozzy Bear is one of the Muppets.; JORDAN'S KING URGES
ARABS TO STRIVE FOR A NEW UNITY; AMMAN, Jordan --;    King Hussein called
today for a settlement of the Palestinian problem and urged Arabs to strive
for a new unity in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf war.;    In an address
broadcast by Jordan's radio and television, he appealed to Arabs: "Let us turn
over a new leaf thanking God that the war has ended, that the bloodshed has
stopped and that the people of Kuwait enjoy their independence once again.";  
 Hussein supported the U.N. resolution demanding Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait. But he opposed Western military intervention, calling instead on the
Arabs to settle the issue peacefully among themselves.; 70 INJURED AMERICAN
GIs FLOWN TO BRITAIN FOR CARE; LONDON --;    Seventy injured American soldiers
have been flown to Britain for treatment, a U.S. Air Force spokesman said
today.;    The men were aboard two flights that arrived Thursday at a Royal
Air Force base in Upper Heyford, near Oxford, southern England, said Master
Sgt. Michael Devine. From there, the soldiers were sent to two RAF hospitals
in the region.; TWO AIRLINES TO RESUME REGULAR FLIGHTS TO MIDEAST; LONDON --; 
  British Airways said today it will resume flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain
this month, and Iberia, the state-owned carrier in Spain, said it will begin
flying to Tel Aviv and Cairo again March 3.;    Both airlines suspended
flights to Middle East destinations shortly before the Persian Gulf war began
in January. The decision to resume some flights followed announcement of the
cease-fire.  </TEXT>
