   First Lady Barbara Bush, who lost a daughter to
leukemia, visited young cancer patients Wednesday while other
summit spouses toured different parts of a sprawling medical
complex.
   On the final day of the three-day economic summit, the spouses
went to the Texas Medical Center, which is made up of hospitals and
medical schools.
   At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Mrs. Bush first talked to
adults receiving anti-cancer drugs in the center's ambulatory
treatment center, the world's largest facility for outpatient
chemotherapy.
   She then visited two children in their rooms before going to see
a group of youths attending summer school as they receive
outpatient treatment at the hospital.
   ``Wow, what a day, what a weird day,'' said 5-year-old Eric
Edelmann.
   Many of the children wore caps on their heads to hide the hair
loss they've suffered from chemotherapy treatment and several were
attached to intravenous tubes.
   The Bushes' daughter, Robin, died at age 3 of leukemia in 1951.
   Mrs. Bush specifically asked to see Denis Lokter, a 15-year-old
cancer patient from the Soviet Union who came to the hospital for
treatment several months ago.
   ``We had a wonderful visit from your president,'' she said,
referring to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's recent trip to the
United States. Lokter, who speaks limited English, said later he
did not know much about politics.
   Mrs. Bush wished happy birthday to Patrick Chapman, who turned 7
Tuesday, and asked him to open his mouth for a quick inspection.
Patrick is missing a front tooth.
   ``You have one enormous tooth. Where's the other one?'' she
asked. ``Certainly, it's going to have a friend, isn't it. They're
going to call you Fang.''
   Mrs. Bush told reporters she felt the spouses attending the
summit were impressed with the city.
   France's Danielle Mitterrand, Canada's Mila Mulroney, Italy's
Livia Andreotti, and Japan's Sachiyo Kaifu also went to the medical
center Wednesday.
   England's Denis Thatcher, the only male spouse, did not go to
the center. Hannelore Kohl, wife of West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, and Marie Delors, wife of European Commission President
Jacques Delors did not accompany their husbands to Texas.
   Mrs. Mitterrand toured the Texas Heart Institute, watched a
presentation on pediatric AIDS at Texas Children's Hospital and
went to the Houston Shriners Hospital for Crippled Children.
   Mrs. Mulroney also toured the Texas Heart Institute and the
Texas Children's Hospital, where she talked to doctors about
current research and treatment for cystic fibrosis. She also met
with some teen-agers with cystic fibrosis.
   Mrs. Andreotti visited a cholesterol research laboratory at The
Methodist Hospital and sampled some low-cholesterol Italian food at
the hospital's heart-healthy gourmet restaurant. She also met
doctors from the Texas Heart Institute and St. Luke's Episcopal
Hospital.
   Mrs. Kaifu met with famed heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey and
saw some of his pioneering inventions for heart surgery. She also
met heart transplant recipients.
