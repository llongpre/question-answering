   Rep. Mickey Leland, who earned a reputation in
the state Legislature as a black-power firebrand in the early
1970s, made his mark in Congress as a liberal, globe-trotting
advocate for the hungry and downtrodden.
   The 44-year-old Houston Democrat, who serves as chairman of a
select House Select Committee on Hunger, was aboard a plane
reported missing in Ethiopia today during a tour of refugee camps
near the border with Sudan.
   A Lubbock native who attended Houston public schools, Leland
graduated from Texas Southern University with a pharmacy degree and
was an instructor of pharmacy at TSU and a practicing pharmacist
before winning a Texas House seat in 1972.
   The lawmaker entered the Legislature from a poverty-stricken
section of Houston as a civil rights activist with a militant
reputation. He wore a big Afro, a leather shoulder bag, African
print shirts and high-heeled boots.
   As his career grew, his attire during the early years of his
three terms in the Legislature gave way to business suits, and he
has since shared a fashionable home in an upscale Houston
neighborhood with his wife, Alison, and son Jarrett, who was
baptized by South Africa's Bishop Desmond Tutu.
   His political style also has moderated somewhat since his
election to the U.S. House in 1978. He replaced the retiring
Democratic Rep. Barbara Jordan.
   Representing an inner-city district, he faced no Republican
opposition and defeated a Socialist Workers Party candidate with
more than 96 percent of the vote.
   Leland won re-election five times with ease, but drew a harsh
1988 primary challenge from Elizabeth Spates, who charged that
Leland had lost touch with constituents while seeking national
exposure as spokesman for the hungry and homeless.
   Leland won the primary with 82 percent of the vote but
acknowledged some truth in Ms. Spates' allegation.
   ``There's people I've not touched in a long time. This has been
a great exercise for me,'' Leland said. ``I feel very confident
that my community is very solidly behind me now. Before there was
some question _ I have been on the road quite a bit. I have been
going abroad.''
   In an article for the Houston Chronicle earlier this year, Rep.
Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the ranking Republican on the House
Select Committee on Intelligence, said Leland's ``personal
diplomacy'' with Ethiopian and Sudanese officials ``opened up
life-sustaining corridors in the border region between the two
countries _ a peaceful (relief) supply route.''
   Leland, who also serves on the House Committee on Energy and
Commerce and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service and was
twice chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, often has thrust
himself into the position of mediator in matters of international
or interracial consequence.
   For 10 years, he has overseen a program in which black youths
from his district were sent to Israel for six-week stays. He was
honored in April by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations for
his work in uniting blacks and Jews.
   He is one of several congressmen investigating colonias along
the Mexican border, where thousands live in communities witout
running water, electricity and sewage systems.
   He joined two other congressmen last October in a trip to Cuba
in an effort to negotiate the release of five political prisoners
and their families. The delegation got three prisoners freed; a
fourth decided to remain in Cuba.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who chose Leland as one of the top four
fund-raisers in his 1988 presidential campaign, praised the
``consistent streak of humanity in Mickey Leland'' during an
election year trip to Houston.
   His name has often been circulated as a possible mayoral
candidate in Houston, although he has indicated greater interest in
a U.S. Senate race.
   Despite his political roots, Leland has maintained a close
relationship with the business establishment in downtown Houston,
which is in his district. He said in a 1988 interview that success
has not changed his views.
   ``I certainly don't apologize for making myself better,'' Leland
said. But he added, ``It would be a profound contradiction if I was
getting rich and forgetting my constituents.''
