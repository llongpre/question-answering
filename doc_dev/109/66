   A 15-month-old boy held at knifepoint by his
mother was rescued when police distracted the woman with a small
explosion, smashed the windows of her car and snatched the child to
safety.
   Tracy Diane Levis, 24, was in the Harris County Jail Saturday on
$300,000 bond on two charges of aggravated assault and one charge
of injury to a child, police Sgt. A.D. Moore said.
   She was taken into custody just after 4 a.m., 13 hours after she
locked herself in the car with her son, Brandon Duke, on a street
in southwest Houston.
   The boy suffered a minor 2-inch laceration on his back and some
dehydration but was in good condition at Ben Taub Hospital, Moore
said. Police believe he was cut by broken glass during the rescue.
   Ms. Levis, whose face was smeared with makeup, has a history of
psychiatric problems and once made a public suicide attempt, police
said. She was in a psychiatric holding cell at the jail and will
undergo testing, Sgt. Michael McGinty said.
   She held a 6-to-8-inch hunting knife near Brandon's throat
during the standoff and appeared to be hallucinating, police said.
She made no demands and did not give any explanation of her actions
during the ordeal, they said.
   The police moved in because of concerns about the child's health
after being locked inside a vehicle for so long.
   Police threw a percussion grenade in front of the car to
distract the woman, and a team of officers stormed the car and
broke the windows. One officer grabbed the child and bolted to a
waiting ambulance.
   ``By the time the mother knew what was going on, we had already
secured the little boy,'' police spokesman Dan Turner said. ``His
safety was our top priority.''
   The incident began about 3 p.m. Friday when Ms. Levis' mother,
Barbara Levis, apparently was trying to take her daughter to a
psychiatric hospital. The two women got into an argument, and
Barbara Levis fled from the car, police said.
   ``I thought it was an accident,'' said Keith Lampton, who saw
the commotion and called police. ``I looked over and I saw her face
was all painted up like Halloween. She was yelling at her mother
and waving a knife toward her.''
   The woman was on some type of medication and told police
negotiators she was hearing strange voices, police said.
   At times, Ms. Levis nuzzled her curly-headed son, bouncing him
on her knees, patting and kissing him. One time she came close to
nicking the child with the blade, then immediately drew back the
knife and checked the baby for wounds, police spokesman Al Baker
said.
