Former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan was in fair condition today at St. David's 
Hospital, where she was undergoing treatment for a urinary infection, a 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
"She is improving," said Jan McCrory, assistant vice president for public 
relations at the hospital. Jordan probably will remain in the hospital for 
several days to a week, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan, 53, has a form of multiple sclerosis and uses a wheelchair. Last year, 
she was hospitalized after she nearly drowned in her swimming pool.
