   The birds came back at dawn singing
of a new day as the people of San Marcos Pass returned to stand in
mournful silence amid the rubble of their burned homes.
   On the winding hillside streets with Spanish names, blackened
skeletons of trees and grotesquely twisted shells of houses stood
Saturday as mute testament to the fiery holocaust of the days
before.
   A few houses stood with their rose gardens miraculously unharmed
by the erratic fire that struck shortly before dusk Wednesday,
started by an unknown arsonist and blown in by the dreaded winds
known as ``sundowners.''
   The acrid smell of smoke remained. At one corner, a carefully
painted signpost with the owner's name and address was perched in
front of a pile of ashes. A mailbox full of unopened letters
remained alongside a charred building.
   ``This was my house. It was a beautiful house,'' said Margaret
Morris, standing near a brick chimney, the only evidence that a
structure once occupied the debris-strewn lot.
   Mrs. Morris, her burned face and arms wrapped in bandages, was
poking through bits of glass and metal for remnants of the Oriental
art collection that was her pride and joy. She found a small jade
Buddha, burned to a pristine white.
   ``I think I'll make a collection of glass to show how it changes
color when it burns,'' she said, holding up a melted green shard,
once a priceless vase. Her grandchildren and a son-in-law helped
salvage bits and pieces of crockery. A chandelier lay charred on
the ground.
   Mrs. Morris and her husband, Harold, barely escaped as flames
raced toward their hillside home Wednesday night. In the rush, she
was unable to find her cat, Marcella.
   ``I still haven't made my peace with the cat,'' she said,
stifling a choking sob. ``You know, your animals trust you so
much.''
   Mrs. Morris and her husband, in their 70s and retired, may not
try to rebuild their house. But most residents of the picturesque
community said they planned to put up new homes as soon as possible.
   Last week's Great Santa Barbara Fire, as they are calling it,
was one of the most destructive in California history. It leveled
438 houses, 28 apartment buildings, 13 businesses, two farms, a
mobile home and 10 public buildings. Officials say the damage
estimate could reach $500 million. Amazingly, only one person died.
   The Bel Air fire of 1961 destroyed 484 homes and the Berkeley
fire of 1923 claimed 584 houses.
   Traces of the 4,900-acre fire remained along the crest of the
Santa Ynez Mountains this morning, but authorities hoped to have it
contained by the end of the day. From his retreat in Kennebunkport,
Maine, President Bush on Saturday declared Santa Barbara County a
disaster area.
   The Santa Barbara fire invaded a land of California dream
houses, many on sprawling lots with room for horses, swimming pools
and even a tennis court or two.
   ``It's a beautiful place to live,'' said Chamber of Commerce
Director Steve Cushman. ``It's quiet and at night the stars are
gorgeous. It's like being in the countryside but close to the
city.''
   Sally Kinney, who has lived in San Marcos Pass for 21 years and
raised her family here, is determined to stay.
   ``We're going to rebuild,''she said. ``It will take a while. The
builder told us today to plan on nine months.''
   She added: ``I'd never put on another wood shake roof.'' Such
combustible roofs were blamed for much of the destruction.
   The Kinneys abandoned their house only after smoke and flames
closed in. But next door, neighbor Fred Gordon staged a five-hour
battle with the elements and won. His house remains standing, wood
shake roof and all.
   Gordon, a banker who has lived here for 24 years, said he and
his 25-year-old son, Mike, decided to face off the fire with garden
hoses.
   ``We were up there on the roof for five and a half hours,'' he
said. ``We wet some beach towels in the pool and wrapped our heads
in them.''
   What was it like?
   ``Have you seen the movie, `Apocalypse Now?''' he asked. ``It
came pretty close to that. The smoke clouds were billowing in. The
house over there was virtually exploding. Trees were going up and
embers were falling on us. ... I guess I'm too stupid to be
afraid.''
   Mayor Sheila Lodge says many residents fear fire in summer.
``When the temperature goes up, I get very scared,'' she said.
``Everyone has to be super careful.''
   This year, a lingering drought made the threat worse, and it is
far from over with an arsonist on the loose.
   ``That's what's additionally scary,'' said Ms. Lodge. ``We know
there's someone out there who for some perverted reason gets their
jollies out of setting fires.''
