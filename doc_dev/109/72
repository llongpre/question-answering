   Former aides of Lyndon B. Johnson are
planning a 25th anniversary reunion they hope will bring together
U.S. and Vietnamese officials for the first time to discuss the war
that tore the administration apart.
   Organizers also hope next year's gathering to mark President
Johnson's inauguration in January 1965 will be the largest reunion
ever of a presidential administration.
   Sponsored by the Lyndon Baines Johnson Foundation, the events are
scheduled for April 6-7 in Washington, D.C., and May 3-5 in Austin,
said Robert Hardesty, a former Johnson aide.
   Harry Middleton, director of the LBJ Library at the University of
Texas, is chairman of program, which includes a daylong symposium on
the Vietnam War. Former Defense Secretary Robert McNamara will be
invited, said Harry McPherson, chairman of the symposium.
   McPherson, a special counsel to Johnson and today a lawyer in
Washington, also hopes members of the North Vietnamese, Chinese and
Soviet governments will participate.
   He said he is inviting officials of America's adversaries in the
war through journalist and author Stanley Karnow.
   ``These are people who were well-placed in the defense and
foreign ministries of those governments. We would like to know a lot
more of the options our enemy was considering during the war. Having
them join in would offer historians a tremendous opportunity,''
McPherson said.
   Other events will include a speech by former U.S. Rep. Barbara
Jordan and a barbecue at the LBJ Ranch to discuss Johnson's ``Great
Society'' programs, said Hardesty, a speech writer for Johnson and
later president of Southwest Texas State University.
   Johnson, harried by the rising tide of public opinion against the
Vietnam War, chose not to run for a second term. He died in 1973.
   Two events are planned in Washington: an April 6 reunion at the
historic Mayflower Hotel for members of the Johnson administration,
and a program the next day at the National Press Club to discuss
Johnson and his legacy.
   Similar discussions will be conducted May 5 at the LBJ Library in
Austin. From such discussions, the planners expect to produce a
documentary film.
