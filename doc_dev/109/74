   President-elect George Bush relaxed
under the Florida sun on Friday, chatting on the phone at poolside
with Richard Nixon and Sen. Robert Byrd, and getting some exercise
by running and swimming.
   Bush indicated he was still keyed up after the election. ``I
haven't really gotten down to the bottom of the unwinding yet,'' he
told The Associated Press.
   The president-elect and his wife Barbara flew to nearby Palm
Beach on Thursday for four days' rest and relaxation while aides in
Washington started up a bureaucracy to guide his transition to
office.
   Three aides and a full Secret Service contingent came along.
   Bush spent the morning sitting by the swimming pool at the
oceanside home where he is resting a few days before concentrating
on putting together his new administration.
   He said there had been congratulatory conversations with former
President Nixon, Senate Majority Leader Byrd, South Carolina Gov.
Carroll Campbell, Illinois Gov. James Thompson and New Jersey Gov.
Thomas Kean, among others.
   Bush said a few of them offered advice, but he didn't elaborate.
   The president-elect went out for a mid-day jog around a golf
course near the vacation home of William Stamps Farish III, a friend
and host to the Bushes. Bush had a gaggle of Secret Service agents
running with him.
   The president-elect then went swimming with Mrs. Bush and their
hosts. A reporter was invited along.
   Bush was cheery and upbeat, joking with his companions as he led
the group down the beach. Offshore the Coast Guard cutter Point
Barnes patrolled.
   The Bushes boarded a motorized raft for a ride out to the cutter.
It then returned to pick up the others.
   Barbara Bush was first in the water, then the vice president.
   About 100 yards out from the cutter, the president-elect called
to agents and aides in a motorized raft to toss back a rope.
   ``Rev it up,'' the soon-to-be commander-in-chief ordered as he
grabbed the rope line, struggling to keep his head above water as
they towed him to shore. Mrs. Bush, an avid swimmer, swam the full
400 yards on her own power.
   After the swim, president-elect Bush walked to the Farish house
and gestured toward a sunny courtyard with a swimming pool.
   ``That's where I was all morning, talking on the phone,'' he
said. ``So you can tell them how we're roughing it.''
   Most of the work was being done at his transition office in
Washington, and even there some of the staffers were taking the
Veterans Day holiday off, he said.
   In a playful mood, Bush emerged from the Atlantic after Mrs. Bush
had walked up on shore and stood in the shallow surf snapping photos
of her and others on the beach with a camera he grabbed from his
official photographer, David Valdez.
