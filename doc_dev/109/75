   One of 34 people who boarded Delta
Airlines Flight 1141 here walked away with only a scratch after the
plane crashed in Texas, and told her father today she stayed to
help those injured.
   Melissa Jane Lewis, 24, of Tupelo, ``told me she was sitting
beside an escape door over a wing, and when it crashed she hit the
ground running,'' said her father Jordan D. Lewis. ``She told me
she only got a scratch on one leg.''
   Thirty-four people boarded the jet here and six of them held
tickets to Salt Lake City, said Delta district marketing manager
George Tribble. The jet, with more than 100 people aboard, crashed
on takeoff from Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport en route to
Utah, officials said.
   Barbara Mosal of Jackson said she was notified that her husband,
Dr. David Mosal, was in a Dallas hospital. ``He's alive. He has an
injury to his shoulder and his back but he is alive _ he did
survive.''
   Lewis, 58, said in a telephone interview from his Tupelo
dentist's office that his daughter told him the plane broke in two
after hitting the ground, and that after escaping ``she returned to
help the injured.
   ``She didn't feel very comfortable about what happened but she
seemed to be in pretty good spirits.''
   Ms. Lewis was going to California for a job interview, he said.
``She was to return home tomorrow night, but now I don't know when
to expect her back.''
   No unusual activity was reported at the airport after the crash,
and Tribble said his office had received no calls ``from local
people saying my son or daughter was on that flight.''
