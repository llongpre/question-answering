<LEADPARA>  Who's the woman Santa Clara County teens most admire?;   No, it's not Mayor
Susan Hammer. It's Mom. And their top male hero isn't some high-scoring Sharks
player or even Dad (he placed third). It's Michael Jordan.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Those are the results, anyway, of Fujitsu America's latest poll of teens.
The company asked local teens to name male and female role models, and the
top-10 list rounds up the usual suspects: George Bush, Barbara Bush and Sandra
Day O'Connor. It delivers the usual mix of politics and entertainment, too:
tying Barbara Bush for second is Julia Roberts. And Mariah Carey beat out
Mother Theresa for third.;   Poll analysts can have real fun reading between
the lines, though. The only actor mentioned is Arnold Schwarzenegger. There
isn't a Democrat on the list. Mikhail Gorbachev is here, but not Boris
Yeltsin. And although Anita Hill placed ninth -- right ahead of Margaret
Thatcher -- Judge Clarence Thomas didn't rate at all.  </TEXT>
