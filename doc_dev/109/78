   Barbara Baer Capitman, a leader in the
art deco preservation movement whose stubbornness and media savvy
helped save hundreds of Miami Beach's historic hotels, has died of
heart failure. She was 69.
   Ms. Capitman, who suffered from diabetes and heart tremors, died
Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center, where she had been a
patient for several days, hospital spokesman Arthur Ehrlich said.
   A diminutive woman with a quavery voice, she used her public
relations know-how and her love of architecture to capitalize on
renewed interest nationwide in art deco buildings.
   Ms. Capitman's outspoken nature may have been the key to her
success, but it made her enemies as well. In 1976 she helped found
the Miami Design Preservation League, which won federal historic
designation for the South Beach district in 1979, but later she was
ousted from the group.
   ``I don't know where it says you have to compromise,'' she told
The Miami Herald in an interview Monday. ``It's been a struggle,
but the struggle isn't over.''
   In 1988, police had to carry her off the steps of the Senator
Hotel when it was demolished to make way for a parking lot. She was
hospitalized that day.
   ``She would push and agitate and cause trouble until half the
people wouldn't speak to her. She was interested in results, not
social sensitivities,'' said Michael Kinerk, a close friend and
chairman of the Art Deco Weekend festival.
   The preservation league had to overcome opposition from the city
manager and chamber of commerce to get the South Beach district
listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It's the only
district with 20th century architecture on the register.
   The historic status brought federal tax breaks to the
economically depressed area, now in the midst of an economic and
cultural renaissance that even Ms. Capitman's harshest critics
credit to the movement she began.
   ``It was a tremendous achievement by one person, one little old
lady,'' her son Andrew said Thursday.
   ``Barbara Capitman deserves her reputation as the indomitable
champion of the art deco treasures of Miami Beach,'' said
billionaire investor Robert Bass, chairman of the National Trust
for Historic Preservation.
   She also helped found chapters of the Art Deco Society in New
York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
   President of the Art Deco Society of American, she was
organizing the first World Congress on Art Deco when she died. It
was to be held next February during the city's Art Deco Weekend, a
festival that drew 420,000 people this year.
   She also was working on a book about the origin and resurgence
of art deco, titled ``Art Deco U.S.A.'' Her book on the history of
Miami Beach's district, titled ``Deco Delights,'' was published in
1989.
   Art deco, a sleek, elegant style associated with wealth and
sophistication, took hold as the nation entered the Depression.
Radio City Music Hall and the Chrysler building in New York are
some of the best examples of art deco's geometric shapes and
streamlined forms.
