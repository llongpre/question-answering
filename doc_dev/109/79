   A California Highway Patrol officer
responding to a traffic accident discovered that his 16-year-old
son had been killed in the crash, authorities said.
   Timothy Brown was pronounced dead at the scene, said Santa
Barbara County Coroner's Detective John Hupp.
   Brown was killed Tuesday when the truck he was riding in veered
off a curve, plowed into some trees and overturned in a creekbed
outside Solvang, said Highway Patrol spokesman Kevin Dougherty.
   His father, Officer T.Y. Brown, responded to the accident call.
   When he arrived, ``he found out it was his son and was
immediately relieved of duty,'' Dougherty said.
   The 17-year-old driver was listed in fair condition at Cottage
Hospital in Santa Barbara. He was arrested for investigation of
vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence, a Highway
Patrol spokeswoman said.
   Solvang is northwest of Santa Barbara.
