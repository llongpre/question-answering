   Former Rep. Barbara Jordan, hospitalized
since she nearly drowned Saturday, is ``well rested, alert and in
good spirits,'' a spokeswoman says.
   Jordan, 52, remained in serious but stable condition Tuesday at
Brackenridge Hospital.
   The first thing the former Democratic congresswoman asked for
Tuesday was a newspaper, said hospital spokeswoman Kari Larsen.
Nurses said Ms. Jordan is very independent and ``likes to do
everything herself,'' according to Ms. Larsen.
   Ms. Jordan, who gained national attention during the 1974
Watergate impeachment hearings, was hospitalized after being found
floating face-down in her backyard pool Saturday.
   Dr. Thomas Deaton, who has treated Ms. Jordan, has said she is
suffering from a condition similar to multiple sclerosis and is
unable to walk.

   Actress Delta Burke may play the self-centered
Suzanne Sugarbaker on the TV comedy ``Designing Women,'' but she's
taken on the real-life role of spokeswoman for the National Kidney
Foundation.
   ``My grandmother has been on dialysis due to kidney failure,''
the 30-year-old former Miss Florida said in a statement from the
foundation Tuesday. ``As a result, I've developed a deep concern
and hope that research will find a cure for kidney disease.''
   The actress will help promote the foundation's programs through
television and radio public service announcements, print
advertisements and personal appearances, the foundation said.

   Filming of ``Personal Choice,'' a movie
about the friendship between an astronaut played by Martin Sheen
and a teen-ager, is set to begin at the Alabama Space and Rocket
Center.
   ``This all looks terrific,'' writer-director David Saperstein
said recently. ``It's going to work very well for us.''
   The center is a state-run museum with a large collection of
space artifacts and astronaut training equipment, much of it on
loan from the Smithsonian Institute.
   Scenes for the movie will be shot primarily at the Saturn V and
space shuttle exhibits.
   The film, which also stars F. Murray Abraham, is scheduled to
begin shooting today and should be released in February.

   Isiah Thomas, who led the Detroit Pistons to the
National Basketball Association finals but says there's ``life
after basketball,'' will work as a sports reporter for a Detroit
television station.
   The Pistons captain will work mainly in the off-season for WDIV
and will begin his work with the station with a series of features
on the 1988 Olympics, said Robert Warfield, station vice president
of news and director of broadcast operations.
   Thomas also will work as a vacation reliever and backup sports
anchor-reporter, the station said.
   ``My mother's always reminding me that there's life after
basketball,'' Thomas said. ``This is an opportunity for me to learn
about television and, hopefully, one day when my basketball career
is over, this could be a second career.''

   When a congressman ``fed up with crime'' found a
suspected burglar in his own house, he armed himself with a tree
limb, threatened to break the man's legs and held him until police
came.
   ``I don't recommend that people do this, but I guess it was just
instinct,'' Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y., said after Tuesday's
confrontation.
   Towns, 54, said he was at his Brooklyn home when a man entered
through a second-floor window.
   ``I heard the noise, went into the room and saw him, then I
yelled,'' Towns said. The would-be burglar climbed back out the
window as Towns tried to grab the man's leg.
   Towns ran from the house and waited near his garage while the
burglar jumped from the roof.
   The congressman, holding the tree limb, told the man, ``Don't
get up, if you do I'm going to break your legs,'' he said. Towns'
wife called police.
   The man, who was not armed, was charged with burglary and
criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. Police said he would not
give his name.
   ``I'm just so sick and tired and fed up with crime,'' Towns
said. ``We have to do everything we possibly can to eliminate
crime.''
