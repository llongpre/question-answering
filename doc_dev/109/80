   George Bush, on vacation in Florida
under the watchful eye of the Secret Service, stood on the deck of a
Coast Guard cutter Friday, ready to jump a dozen feet into the brisk
Atlantic waters.
   This reporter accepted an unexpected invitation and followed him
in.
   President-elect and Barbara Bush flew to nearby Palm Beach
Thursday for four days' rest and relaxation while aides in
Washington started up a bureaucracy to guide his transition to
office.
   Three aides and a full Secret Service contingent came along, as
well as a few reporters.
   Bush spent the morning sitting by the swimming pool at the
oceanside home where he is resting a few days before concentrating
on putting together his new administration. He sat beside the pool
Friday morning and chatted on the phone with the likes of Richard
Nixon and Sen. Robert Byrd.
   Bush indicated he was still keyed up after the election. ``I
haven't really gotten down to the bottom of the unwinding yet,'' he
acknowledged.
   The president-elect went out for a mid-day jog around a golf
course near the vacation home of William Stamps Farish III, a friend
and host to the Bushes. Bush had a gaggle of Secret Service agents
running with him. I too had been jogging in the neighborhood and he
stopped to chat.
   The president-elect and Mrs. Bush were going swimming with their
hosts.
   ``Hey, can she go in the water with us?'' Bush asked his aides
and agents, pointing in my direction.
   No problem.
   Bush was cheery and upbeat, joking with his companions as he led
the group down the beach. Offshore the Coast Guard cutter Point
Barnes patrolled.
   The Bushes boarded a motorized raft for a ride out to the cutter.
It then returned to pick up the others.
   Barbara Bush was first in the water.
   The president-elect peeled off his T-shirt and jumped off the
side.
   About 100 yards out from the cutter, the president-elect called
to agents and aides in a motorized raft to toss back a rope.
   ``Rev it up,'' the soon-to-be commander-in-chief ordered as we
grabbed the rope line, struggling to keep our heads above water as
they towed us to shore. Mrs. Bush, an avid swimmer, swam the full
400 yards on her own power.
   On shore, Bush aides offered towels and a jacket.
   After the swim, president-elect Bush walked to the Farish house
and gestured toward a sunny courtyard with a swimming pool.
   ``That's where I was all morning, talking on the phone,'' he
said. ``So you can tell them how we're roughing it.''
   There had been congratulatory telephone calls to return: Former
President Nixon, Senate Majority Leader Byrd, South Carolina Gov.
Carroll Campbell, Illinois Gov. James Thompson, New Jersey Gov.
Thomas Kean, among others.
   Bush said a few of them offered advice, but he didn't elaborate.
   Most of the work was being done at his transition office in
Washington, and even there some of the staffers were taking the
Veterans Day holiday off, he said.
   In a playful mood, Bush emerged from the Atlantic after Mrs. Bush
had walked up on shore and stood in the shallow surf snapping photos
of her and others on the beach with a camera he grabbed from his
official photographer, David Valdez.
   The Farishs' cheery yellow house seemed less extravagant than
many along the exclusive beachfront where sunbathers and joggers
enjoyed the shore and sailboats bounced on the sea.
