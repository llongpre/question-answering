   Oprah Winfrey apparently provided the
inspiration some people needed when the 34-year-old talk show
hostess revealed how she shed 67 pounds.
   York Hospital, which offers the same Optifast weight loss program
Ms. Winfrey used, has received more than 100 calls about enrolling,
said Marta Smith, program director for the hospital's Nutrition and
Metabolic Center.
   ``She was so inspirational,'' Ms. Smith said. ``A lot of patients
said, `If she did it, I can do it.'''
   On Tuesday's show, Ms. Winfrey, wearing size 10 jeans, talked
about how she lost the weight with the liquid diet.
   Ms. Smith said more than 40 people had enrolled by mid-week in an
orientation program scheduled for later this month. It normally
draws 25 to 30 people.
   Only people at least 50 pounds overweight can participate, she
said.

   Marilyn Addams, wife of the late New Yorker
cartoonist Charles Addams, says that although her husband's drawings
were populated by ghosts and ghouls, he detested funerals and told
her he didn't want one.
   ``So a party it is,'' Mrs. Addams said Friday in explaining the
gathering of about 250 of his friends at the New York Public Library.
   Addams died Sept. 29 from a heart attack. He was 76 and had drawn
cartoons for the weekly magazine for 53 years.
   The 1960s TV show, ``The Addams Family,'' was inspired by his
macabre characters.
   At Friday's party, some of Addams' cartoons were on display,
including one of Morticia, the sexy vampire, asking to borrow a cup
of cyanide from a neighbor.
   Candles twinkled, food was served, a Dixieland band played and
people danced.
   Mrs. Addams wore white; she wore black when she married Addams
eight years ago in a Long Island pet cemetery.
   Burgess Meredith, the actor, and his son, Jonathan, who is
Addams' godson, sang a song they wrote in the cartoonist's honor.
   Dozens of Addams' colleagues from the New Yorker turned up,
including the new editor, Robert Gottlieb. He said the magazine
still had eight covers and 40 drawings by Addams which it plans to
publish.
   ``However many there are,'' he said, ``they're not enough.''

   Country singer Barbara Mandrell has moved
away from Barbara Mandrell Boulevard north of Nashville to a home in
the country.
   ``We are farmers now, this is the first time in my life to be a
real country girl,'' she said of the move to a six-bedroom log house
on 136 acres northwest of the city.
   Mandrell ties the move to her new album, ``I'll Be Your Jukebox
Tonight,'' a return to the country style of her youth.
   Most of her hits have been pop tunes. But the latest album has
two hillbilly oldies, including the 1961 Wynn Stewart classic, ``Big
Big Love.''
   ``In the 1960s when that record was popular I played steel guitar
for my father in his band,'' Mandrell said. ``It was one of the
songs that I did.''
   The tune marks the first time Mandrell, a musical prodigy as a
child, has played steel guitar on a studio album.
   She toured with Patsy Cline, Johnny Cash, George Jones and Don
Gibson at age 13.
   ``I'm 39 years old but I'm 28 years in this business. I grew up
in it; and that helped me to know and learn from Wynn Stewart and
Tex Ritter and Joe Maphis and a lot of people who aren't with us
anymore,'' she said.

   Former Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker Jr.,
who left retirement to be President Reagan's chief of staff during
the Iran-Contra scandal, was named Saturday to receive the 1989
Harry S. Truman Good Neighbor Award.
   It has been presented annually since 1973 by the Harry S. Truman
Good Neighbor Award Foundation to a person who exemplifies the
accomplishments and characteristics of the late Democratic president.
   Baker, 63, a Republican, served in the Senate from 1967 to 1985.
He was named White House chief of staff Feb. 27, 1987, following the
resignation of Donald Regan. Baker resigned from the post on June 14.
   Phil Pistilli, president of the foundation, called Baker ``a
distinguished statesman, highly regarded by all for his vital role
in helping the United States at a time when the nation was in a
crisis.
   ``His career is flawless, admired by all and, in our opinion,
being a Republican statesman, he reminds us a great deal of
President Truman, working in the Truman tradition.''
   The award will be presented at a luncheon celebrating what would
have been Truman's 105th birthday on May 8.

   Joy Hall, 11, enjoys talking in front of
television cameras and radio microphones _ when she isn't practicing
gymnastics, bowling or playing basketball.
   Those talents won the admiration of delegates to the National
Easter Seal Society convention in Dallas, who selected the Baltimore
youngster Thursday as National Easter Seal Child for 1989.
   Joy, who lacks control of her arm and leg muscles and wears leg
braces, was born with cerebral palsy, a neurological disorder that
causes muscles to become weak, lethargic or spastic, said Rebecca
Levine, spokeswoman for the Easter Seal Society of Maryland.
   But Joy does not regard the handicap as an impediment to the
activities she loves.
   The sixth grader plays basketball at school, attends gymnastics
classes geared to build strength in children with physical
disabilities and loves to go bowling.
   Joy will make a series of appearances for Easter Seals, including
a trip to the White House in February, Ms. Levine said.
