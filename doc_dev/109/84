   The United States said Thursday it will ask
for an investigation into the killing of six Roman Catholic priests
in El Salvador, and will accelerate deliveries of military aid to
government forces there.
   ``We do not know who committed this barbarous act, which we
condemn in the strongest possible terms,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.
   A Jesuit priest, who spoke only on condition he not be
identified, told reporters in San Salvador that a witness saw 30
uniformed soldiers enter the grounds of the University of Central
America shortly before the six priests and two university employees
were tortured and killed.
   Both the Salvadoran government and its armed forces denied any
involvement in the incident.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater condemned the
killings in a statement late Thursday and said the Salvadoran
government was reported to have begun an investigation.
   ``We condemn in the strongest possible terms the outrageous
murder of Father Ignacio Ellacuria, rector of the University of
Central America, and the other Jesuit priests in El Salvador,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``We understand that the Salvadoran government has begun an
investigation and we will be watching this investigation closely.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said U.S. Ambassador William Walker will ask the
Salvadoran government for a ``full inquiry'' into killings at the
university. She said Walker intended to raise the matter directly
with Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani on Thursday.
   The Conference of Major Superiors of Men, representing 260
religious orders, condemned the killings and called for renewed
efforts to negotiate a peace in El Salvador.
   Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., said she and Rep. Joe Moakley,
D-Mass., had sent telegrams to the Salvadoran government and
leftist FMLN guerrillas asking them to respect a Red Cross request
for a 72-hour cease-fire to allow evacuation of civilians and the
wounded.
   She said the Bush administration should do everything it can to
halt the fighting and arrange negotiations.
   Pete Williams, spokesman for Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, said
the Pentagon is accelerating delivery of military assistance
previously requested by Salvadoran authorities.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the request from San Salvador included riot
control equipment and light weaponry.
   ``I understand some of the equipment is new but other items have
been on request for some time, and we are merely speeding up
delivery,'' Williams said.
   The administration has requested $370 million in economic and
military aid next year for El Salvador, which the United States
regards as its closest ally in Central America. Of the total, $85
million is arms aid.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States is confident of the
Cristiani government's ability to defeat the guerrillas who began a
major offensive earlier this week.
   ``We believe the Salvadoran govenment is able to manage the
situation,'' she said.
   The Pentagon spokesman said U.S. military advisers are
monitoring the situation but are neither involved in the fighting
nor directing Salvadoran troops.
   U.S. officials have accused the rebels of using civilians in San
Salvador as protection, and say Salvadoran troops are moving
cautious to keep down the number of casualties.
   ``Both the army and the ai force are dislodging remaining
pockets of guerrillas from neighborhoods where they have dug in,''
Ms. Tutwiler said. ``In this environment where the FMLN is using
civilians to shield its combatants, strict rules of engagement have
been issued by the Salvadoran government to prevent civilian
casualties,'' she said.
