   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., should fully
recover from Saturday's rare double-lung transplant before
November, when voters have to decide whether to give him a 10th
term in office, his doctor said.
   ``I think the Congressman has tremendous spirit. He wants to do
things. I suspect his recovery period should be very short,'' said
the leader of the University of Mississippi Medical Center
transplant team, Dr. Seshadri Raju.
   Raju said the 60-year-old Spence was on a respirator in critical
but stable condition after five hours of surgery concluded about 3
a.m. Saturday.
   Spence suffered from chronic obstructive lung disease, a
hereditary and debilitating illness that doctors say would have
taken his life without the transplant.
   ``If everything goes satisfactorily, I think he will be
recovered much, much earlier than that (November),'' Raju said. The
congressman should be able to take calls from his bed ``within a
week a two I'm sure, maybe sooner.''
   Prior to the surgery, Raju had said Spence would be able to
resume a normal schedule within six months with ``surprisingly
little'' in the way of physical restrictions.
   Spence had awakened from the anesthesia by noon Saturday and was
visited by his fiancee, 37-year-old Deborah Williams of Lexington,
S.C., said the congressman's press secretary, Randy Mashburn.
Spence is a widower.
   The congressman's four sons also were with him, Mashburn said.
   However, Mashburn declined to comment on the possibility the
congressman would be campaigning before his November contest
against Democratic challenger Jim Leventis.
   ``I don't want to answer any political questions right now. We
just want to get this man healthy and back on his feet,'' Mashburn
said.
   Confined at times to a wheelchair and occasionally in need of
oxygen, Spence has made few public appearances since last October,
when he went on a list of potential organ transplant recipients.
   The hospital is a member of an organ donor network that seeks to
match organs with recipients, medical center spokeswoman Barbara
Austin said.
   Spence's new lungs were flown in from a donor in Tyler, Texas,
and Friday night Spence was flown to Jackson.
   ``Floyd had been meeting with his constitutents in his
congressional office (in Columbia, S.C.) all afternoon when his
beeper went off,' Mashburn said. ``We took off.''
   Double-lung transplants have been performed 30 times worldwide
and only 13 times in North America, Austin said.
   The Jackson hospital has now done four of the transplants, but
two of the patients died. Medical Center officials attributed one
of the deaths to factors unrelated to either the surgery or
respiratory ailments.
