   Police kept security tight around a
hospital and braced for more protests today after demonstrators who
said they wanted to reconnect Nancy Cruzan's feeding tube were
arrested before they could reach the comatose woman's room.
   Meanwhile, Barbara Shoun, a spokeswoman for the Missouri
Rehabilitation Center, said Ms. Cruzan's condition was downgraded
from stable to deteriorating. She declined to release other details
about the woman's condition.
   Police said 19 people, many clutching Bibles and rosaries, were
arrested Tuesday at the Missouri Rehabilitation Center, where the
33-year-old woman at the center of a landmark U.S. Supreme Court
right-to-die ruling lay.
   Eleven demonstrators made it to the second floor, where Ms.
Cruzan's private room is situated. Protesters knelt and prayed in
the hall before being dragged off.
   Probate Judge Charles Teel ruled Friday that Ms. Cruzan's
parents could order the feeding tube removed after he determined
there was sufficient evidence the woman would not have wanted to
live in a such a condition. Doctors said she will die in a week or
two.
   The Supreme Court had ruled in June that the state could prevent
Ms. Cruzan's parents from halting food and water in the absence of
``clear and convincing'' evidence that that was what she wanted.
Former co-workers then testified she told them she would not want
to live in such a condition.
   Ms. Cruzan has been in a coma since suffering brain damage in a
1983 car crash. Doctors say she has no chance of regaining
consciousness.
   Protest organizer Joseph Foreman said those arrested included a
nurse who knew how to connect the feeding tube.
   ``The best we can do is not cooperate with anyone trying to
starve an innocent person to death,'' said Foreman, acting director
of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.
   Those arrested were charged with trespassing and unlawful
assembly and jailed on $500 bail. Sheriff's Lt. Ken Perkins said
the protesters identifed themselves as Nancy Cruzan and would not
be allowed to post bail until they gave their real names.
   The Rev. Ted Coleman, who was on chaplain duty at the hospital,
said Ms. Cruzan's parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan, were aware of the
protests. ``They said, `We're private people. We just want to be
left alone,''' he said.
