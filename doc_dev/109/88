   Here is a transcript of the speech by Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas to the Democratic National Convention as he
accepted the party's vice presidential nomination.
   Thank you very much.
   John Glenn is one of the most talented, respected figures in
America. And I thank him for a very gracious introduction.
   And Danny Rostenkowski, Tom Daschle, Barbara Jordan, Mickey
Leland, what great friends you are.
   Thank you very much.
   And I thank you, my fellow Democrats, for this high honor.
   I am proud and pleased to accept your nomination for vice
president of the United States of America.
   In four months America will elect a new president.
   And his name will be Michael Dukakis.
   His theme will be economic opportunity for all. His values will
be honesty, integrity, and fairness. And his party will be a united
Democratic Party.
   Twenty-eight years ago, our party nominated a president from
Massachusetts and a vice president from Texas. The Texan on that
ticket was Lyndon Baines Johnson. Lyndon Johnson knew then what you
and I know so well today. The equality of opportunity is the
ultimate civil right.
   His vision and his victories paved the way for Democratic
leaders like Rev. Jesse Jackson whose eloquence, whose leadership
and achievements transcend pride of party and inspire a nation.
   Tonight the hopes of a nation _ the incredible energy and
diversity of America _ are focused on Atlanta. This convention
reflects that energy and diversity.
   We are a mirror of America.
   We Democrats don't march in lockstep behind some narrow, rigid
ideology of indifference. We are not gray grains of oatmeal in a
bland porridge of privilege.
   Our way, the Democratic way, is to tackle the tough problems.
Our way is to search out the honest answers and stand by our
principles.
   Of course, we have differences of opinion. But on the basic
issues of justice and opportunity, we stand united.
   Democrats agree that a good job at a fair wage is the passport
to opportunity in America.
   Democrats agree that America needs a trade policy based on the
simple premise of fairness. We demand that nations selling goods
freely into our country, that we have full access to their markets.
   Democrats agree that the economic, trade, and energy policies of
the Reagan-Bush administration have devastated vast areas of
America. We see an agricultural economy that has been driven to its
knees: We see the energy economy reeling in crisis. We see the loss
of more than one million high-paying jobs in manufacturing.
   Democrats agree that the American worker who has struggled for
20 years to support his or her family, has earned 60 days noe when
that management closes down a plant.
   But the Reagan-Bush administration thinks a pink slip in the
mail is notice enough. That's their notion of fairness. That's
their message to the working men and women of America.
