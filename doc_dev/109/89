<TEXT>     "She didn't always agree with the pope," Bunten said. "She always
considered herself a devout Catholic, but she was also a feminist.";    After
leaving the order, Ms. Schreiber-Gould went back to school, earning a master's
degree in counseling and psychology in 1970. Between 1972 and 1977, she
counseled sex offenders at the Buena Vista, Colo., reformatory.;    While
working that job, she continued her studies and received a doctoral degree in
psychology from the University of New Mexico in 1978, specializing in human
sexuality. In 1978, she came to Fremont, where she worked for nearly a decade
at a private Scotts Valley alcohol and drug treatment center, Star Lodge
Hospital.;    There, she met Dr. Russell L. Gould, whom she married in 1982.
Gould retired in 1986, and the couple opened a private practice in Fremont.
Gould died in 1988.;    Bunten said her stepmother was both "feisty and
accepting of other people." In counseling patients, Ms. Schreiber-Gould was
"very much a proponent of being open and straightforward about sex," Bunten
said. "As a feminist, she always encouraged women to say what they wanted.";  
 She was a member of the National Organization for Women and was involved in
efforts to pass the Equal Rights Amendment.;    Ms. Schreiber-Gould was
diagnosed with cancer two years ago.;     Mary Schreiber-Gould;  (box)Born:
