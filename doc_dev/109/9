   Sporting a ``Where was George?'' button and
flashing a broad smile, former U.S. Rep. Barbara Jordan left a
hospital Monday, more than a week after she nearly drowned in her
swimming pool.
   ``Thank you for my life,'' Ms. Jordan, 52, told emergency
medical personnel and nurses who cared for her during her stay at
Brackenridge Hospital.
   Dr. William Deaton said Ms. Jordan is ``in excellent condition,
and she should return to her normal lifestyle within a couple of
weeks.''
   There is no explanation of what caused Ms. Jordan to lose
consciousness in her pool on July 30, Deaton said. He said it was
most likely a heart rhythm disturbance.
   The ``Where was George'' button refers to a Democratic National
Convention speech by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., that criticized
Vice President George Bush's role in the Reagan administration.

   Pop star Madonna's Broadway debut is coming to
an end.
   The cast of David Mamet's ``Speed-the-Plow'' departs at the end
of the month, though the play continues. Joe Mantegna, Ron Silver
and Madonna will be replaced by David Rasche, Bob Balaban and
Felicity Huffman.
   Rasche recently starred as the title character in the ABC-TV
program ``Sledge Hammer.'' Balaban has appeared in such films as
``Absence of Malice,'' ``Altered States'' and ``Close Encounters of
the Third Kind.'' Miss Huffman was featured in ``Boy's Life'' at
Lincoln Center this year.
   The play, about a Hollywood studio's head of production, a film
producer and a temporary secretary, won a Tony nomination.

   Charles Haid, who played Officer Andy
Renko on television's ``Hill Street Blues'' and stars in the movie
``The Rescue,'' says he was never in danger after falling from his
sail boat a mile off shore.
   Haid, 40, was plucked from the ocean after falling from the
catamaran off Broad Beach Saturday afternoon. He said a couple
pulled him from the water 45 minutes later.
   Haid said he fell into the water while trying to attach himself
to a harness that allows him to lean over the water as the
wind-tipped boat rides on one pontoon.
   ``I was hooking on, my hook slipped and I went off the back,''
said Haid, who was wearing a life preserver.
   His brother, who also was on the boat, lost sight of him, and
went back to shore for help.

   King Baudouin is suffering from
rheumatic back pain, which prompted Queen Fabiola to return early
from her two-week Spanish holiday, the royal palace said Monday.
   ``He has been bothered by lumbago for a couple of days, but it
is nothing serious,'' said palace spokeswoman Peggy Versmissen. The
monarch is set to resume his duties early next week, she said.
   King Baudouin was scheduled to join Spanish-born Queen Fabiola
in Montril, near the southern city of Grenada, over the weekend but
the trouble forced him to stay home.

   Actor LeVar Burton attributes his downfall
after ``Roots'' to money, drugs and women, but says meditation is
responsible for his comeback.
   Burton, who played the African slave boy Kunta Kinte in
``Roots,'' recently landed a part on ``Star Trek: The New
Generation.''
   ``I lost my balance,'' Burton said in an interview for an
article to appear in TV Guide's Aug. 13 edition. ``It turned my
world upside down and it took me a long time to find myself again.''
   Burton, 31, said he began psychotherapy just over three years
ago. He developed an interest in spiritualism and began meditating,
practiced ``Rolfing,'' a process of strenuous body manipulation,
breathing, fire-walking and even ``leaped blindfolded off a 30-foot
pole as a way of challening his fear,'' the article said.
   As he began to piece his life back together, Burton said he
decided to use spiritualism to will himself back into a good acting
job.
