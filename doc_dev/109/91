   Julia Child, television's ``The
French Chef,'' was offered French bread and fresh salmon after
being hospitalized with a fractured hip suffered in a fall, a
medical center spokeswoman said Thursday.
   The 75-year-old Mrs. Child broke her hip Monday at her Montecito
condominium and was expected to be at Cottage Hospital for another
week, said spokeswoman Janet O'Neill. Mrs. Child was in good
condition Thursday.
   ``She's not eating much, but our executive chef did send her up
some French bread. She said it was like a breath of spring. He told
her he has some fresh salmon anytime she's ready,'' Ms. O'Neill
said.
   Mrs. Child and her husband of 41 years, Paul, live in
Massachusetts, but since 1981 have spent their winters in
Montecito, for decades a fashionable enclave in the Santa Barbara
area along the Southern California coast.
