<DESCRIPT>  US; PRESIDENT; SPOUSE; ACCIDENT  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Even Arnold Schwarzenegger could not rescue a lady in distress in time to
prevent injuries of the sort that come from slamming into a tree.;    Thus it
was that Barbara Bush had to be carried from the presidential helicopter and
whisked across the White House lawn in a wheelchair, with the president at her
side.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BARBARA BUSH BREAKS LEG IN SLEDDING ACCIDENT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The 65-year-old first lady suffered a minor break in her left leg from
ramming a tree while sledding with her grandchildren and the muscular actor
also known as "The Terminator" and "Kindergarten Cop." The incident occurred
at Camp David, the "weekend White House" in the Catoctin Mountains of western
Maryland.;    "No damage to the tree," President Bush commented dryly when
asked about the accident as he watched a medic and a uniformed Marine carry
his wife from the helicopter and transfer her to a wheelchair.;    Mrs. Bush
shook her head when asked if she felt pain.;    "It smarts a little," the
president said.;    "That's easy for him to say," she said in mock
indignation.;    Initial reports said that she suffered only scrapes and
bruises. But after she was taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital,
Washington County Regional, in Hagerstown, Md., X-rays showed a "non-displaced
fracture of the left fibula." The fibula is the thinner outer bone in the
calf.;    No cast or medication was needed, but Mrs. Bush was told to stay off
the leg for three days and to use crutches until the fracture mends in an
estimated five to six weeks.;    Mrs. Bush smiled and joked with reporters and
presidential staff members assembled for the first family's arrival. The
president placed his hand on her shoulder at one point as he walked beside the
wheelchair to the White House doorway. Once she was inside, he returned to
make a brief statement about Soviet repression of Lithuanian independence and
reply to questions about the Baltic and Persian Gulf situations.;    Anna
Perez, Mrs. Bush's press secretary, said that the first lady was sliding down
an icy hill at Camp David on an inflated inner tube with four grandchildren
and Schwarzenegger, a former Mr. Universe who heads the President's Council on
Physical Fitness. He and his wife, TV personality Maria Shriver, were weekend
guests.;    "She doesn't know why she didn't bail out," Perez said in
describing the accident. "She just held on, and the next thing she knew, there
was the tree.";    Bush had accompanied the first lady on the slope several
times Saturday and again earlier Sunday, but he was not present when the
accident occurred.;    Dr. Clarence Mohr, a White House physician, examined
Mrs. Bush's bruises and scrapes and dispatched her to the hospital with a
corpsman. But Mohr remained with the president, in accordance with established
procedure that ensures constant medical attendance.  </TEXT>
