   CBS Inc., trailing the other two major television networks in total audience, is expected to name a respected producer, Barbara Corday, as the No. 2 programming executive of its entertainment division. 

   The signing of Ms. Corday as second-in-command behind CBS Entertainment president Kim LeMasters would be the network's first major move since it shook up its top management two weeks ago. 
CBS, which dropped to third place in audience ratings this year for the first time in its history, elevated CBS News President Howard Stringer to head all broadcast operations effective Aug. 1, succeeding longtime Broadcast Group President Gene F. Jankowski. 

   Ms. Corday, a creator of the hit television series "Cagney &amp; Lacey," was until last October president and chief operating officer of the Columbia/Embassy Television unit of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. 
She was pushed out of that post as part of a management reorganization when Columbia Pictures Entertainment was formed by the merger of Coca-Cola Co.'s Entertainment Business Sector with Tri-Star Pictures Inc. Victor Kaufman, Columbia's new chairman, had been chairman of Tri-Star and put other Tri-Star executives in the key television posts. 

   CBS acknowledged it is negotiating with Ms. Corday but declined to comment further. 
Ms. Corday also declined to comment. 

   The 43-year-old executive would bring some much-needed experience to CBS, whose relationships with the Hollywood creative community haven't always been smooth. 
Ms. Corday has been a TV writer, producer, studio head and network executive, and her ties to Hollywood are more extensive than those of Mr. LeMasters. 

   Moreover, she may have a better eye for what appeals to young adult audiences -- in particular young women viewers -- whom advertisers most want to reach. 
While CBS finished last in the ratings this season by only a tiny margin in terms of total households, it lags far behind the ABC and NBC networks among younger viewers. 

   "There's been a pattern at CBS of too much creative control, and Barbara's appointment is a strong movement away from that," said producer Leonard Hill of Leonard Hill Films Inc. 

   Before becoming a writer, producer and, at Capital Cities/ABC Inc., a TV network executive, Ms. Corday worked as a publicist. 
"The networks need that kind of showmanship, somebody to be a cheerleader, and too often it's hard to find all those components in one executive," Mr. Hill said. 

   "Overnight, CBS will now be in business with top people that weren't taking their material to the network," said Barney Rosenzweig, Ms. Corday's former husband and the chairman of Weintraub Entertainment Group's television group. 
"Barbara is a very receptive creative executive, and this town respects her enormously." 

   Mr. Rosenzweig was executive producer of "Cagney &amp; Lacey," the show about women cops on which Ms. Corday was the co-creator. 
Mr. LeMasters canceled that six-year-old critically acclaimed series this year, after it finished 43rd out of 85 series on the TV networks. 
Although it finished ahead of four other series that Mr. LeMasters kept on the CBS schedule, he said it had passed its peak. 

   Ms. Corday had been considering a variety of independent production opportunities since leaving Columbia, including talks with Mr. LeMasters and other CBS executives before Mr. Stringer's promotion to broadcast group president. 
But people familiar with the situation said Mr. Stringer last week offered her the No. 2 executive spot at CBS Entertainment. 

   But Ms. Corday's hiring isn't viewed as undercutting Mr. LeMasters. 
CBS President Laurence A. Tisch repeatedly has expressed his support of the top programmer, who had spent all but one year of his career inside CBS before moving up to entertainment president in October 1987. 

   "Too many people are obsessing over that issue: 'Is Barbara there as a backup if Kim hits the dirt?'" said Mr. Hill. 
"Barb's there to help Kim. 
I think if CBS does poorly over the next year, it is quite possible that everybody will be out."
