<DESCRIPT>  MUSIC; CELEBRITY; MAN; QA; PROFILE; INTERVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  AT FIRST, he was just Herbert Khaury from Queens, a middle-aged man with long
hair and a photographic memory for the styles of ancient crooners.;   But then
he became Tiny Tim, playing smoky Greenwich Village clubs and winning a campy
cult. And finally, in the late '60s, he became a star.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  SAY ANYTHING  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     He had a hit album, "God Bless Tiny Tim." He played Las Vegas for a
reported $50,000 a week. He married Miss Vicki on the Johnny Carson show.;  
Those days are gone. But Tiny Tim, 61 -- or is it 68? The reference books
disagree -- still tours. He still plays the ukulele and does pitch-perfect
impressions of Bing Crosby and Rudy Vallee. He's been in a Diet Pepsi
commercial and played a killer clown in a barely seen horror movie called
"Blood Harvest." He's still in show business.;   In a way, Tiny Tim is show
business. And every interview is a performance.; Q: I know you're a very
formal person. Should I call you Tiny Tim? Mr. Tiny? Mr. Tim?;   A: Oh Tiny's
all right. Tim is all right. It's all OK.;   Q: Well, what sort of songs do
you do in concert these days, Tiny?;   A: What I've done for years. Little
tidbits like "Grand Old Flag," "I'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy," "He's Got the
Whole World in His Hands" -- songs everyone knows. And in San Francisco, if I
don't forget, (sings) "San Francisco, open your golden gate, you'll find no
strangers there, beside your door.";   Q: And "Tiptoe Through the Tulips"?;  
A: Every show, every time.;   Q: What made that such a big hit for you?;   A:
Originality is the key to success in any business. And that song had an
original sound. It was good enough to make them wonder "What's that?";   Q: A
while ago you were also doing some country and western songs. Are you still
pursuing that?;   A: Oh, whatever's popular I pursue. That's a good memory,
Mr. Whitty. That was back in '88. Yes, as a matter of fact. I had an album
that was supposed to come out. But the guy's check bounced. But there was a
single from that album released called "Leave Me Satisfied." And people loved
it until they found out it was Tiny Tim. (Sings with a drawl) "Someone else is
on your mind, it's plain to see / And you believe you love him more than me."
People said "That can't be Tiny Tim!";   Q: Sort of a different sound for
you.;   A: You ain't kidding.;   Q: So you think the name scared country fans
off a bit?;   A: Yes. The strange name and the appearance. You know, I've lost
more women with the way I look than the way I sound! Nothing I can do about it
though. . . . Originality brings success but what can I tell you. My second
wife is leaving me.;   Q: Really?;   A: She's going to her lawyer.;   Q: When
you married your first wife it was one of the highest-rated TV programs ever.
Do you ever see Miss Vicki? Or your daughter, Tulip?;   A: Tulip I take care
of every month. She gets about $320. She's working for the Teamsters in
Philadelphia. She has a daughter . . . Miss Vicki has married a third time. I
don't see her or talk to her. There's no reason to talk to the past. There's
an old song in the '20s by Johnny Marvin: "After I've called you sweetheart,
how can I call you friend?" The same way it'll be with this one if she leaves.
But from what I hear Miss Vicki is the manager of a luggage shop in Cherry
Hill, N.J.;   Q: So it looks like you're going to be available again.;   A:
Well, I don't know to who! Although Miss Jan hasn't gotten her divorce yet. .
. . But what can I tell you. I'm in love with a woman who doesn't love me.
She's 24 years old, she's in Texas, but she's a perfect woman, at least in my
mind. I fantasize about her every day.;   Q: Let's go back to music. What do
you think of rap? Any interest in a Tiny Tim rap song?;   A: Sure. I tell you,
whatever's popular in music, whether it's 1991 or 1891 it's the trend of
youth. Youth always brings their own music . . . Back in 1927, 1925 there was
a song (sings) "Collegiate, collegiate, yes we are collegiate" -- that was a
new trend. Led into the flapper-dapper era. And parents were saying, "What's
happened to our youth?" Youth always brings its own music. And today it's rap,
and heavy metal, which I love.;   Q: Any favorite heavy metal bands?;   A: I
love Guns N' Roses. I have one of their cassettes floating around. I just
bought Metallica last week. I really like what's happening today. I even have
a heavy metal record.;   Q: You mean you recorded a heavy metal record?;   A:
Oh yes, with His Majesty's Orchestra, a heavy metal band in Australia. I
recorded it in 1983. (Sings) "I'm on the highway to hell . . ." It's yet to be
released here. It sold 80 copies in Sydney a couple of years ago and then it
dropped to zero. But that was 80 copies more than I'd sold in the last 10
years.;   Q: Do you have a favorite singer?;   A: There were some who were
outstanding. Of course Rudy Vallee, who I thought was a great romantic singer.
My favorite singer of about 1900 was Byron G. Harlan, who in my opinion was
the first popular singer of the American phonograph . . . And just a snip of
how he sounded (sings and plays the ukulele), "School days, school days, dear
old Golden Rule days . . ." Just love that sound. And the early Bing Crosby,
from '28 just to '35. I don't think there ever was a greater popular singer
than the young Mr. Crosby . . . (sings and plays the ukulele) "Lend your
little ear to my plea, lend a little cheer to my plea . . ." I love that early
Bing sound. And Harry Richman . . . (sings, again) "Gee but it's great,
staying out late, walking my baby back ho-o-o-ome." He knocked them dead.;  
Q: Rudy Vallee and Bing Crosby were both performing into their 70s and beyond.
Can you see yourself still doing this then?;   A: If I'm alive and well and
able to get on stage. But I tell you, when I do my own shows -- all these
artists, Wayne Newton, Frank Sinatra who do hour shows -- I only like to do
about 20 minutes. In the old days of vaudeville, that's all they did.;   Q:
Always leave 'em wanting more?;   A: Oh yes. My theory is hit 'em with a
couple of great songs, make them remember you and leave while you're ahead.
Hit 'em with "Grand Old Flag" and go out with "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" and
they'll say, "Well -- he wasn't as bad as we thought."; Tiny Tim; Dr.

Old Philosopher" Lawrence and "Weird Al" Yankovic; When: Saturday, 8 p.m. and
11 p.m.; Where: Warfield Theater, 982 Market St., San Francisco; Tickets: $19
