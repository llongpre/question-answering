   A dozen American folk artists, ranging from a
Czech-American egg painter to a Hawaiian cowboy singer and ukelele
player, have been awarded grants from the National Endowment of the
Arts for their efforts to preserve the artistic legacy of their
forebears.
   The 12 were selected from among 155 traditional artists
nominated by their peers to receive the $5,000 National Heritage
Fellowships, NEA Chairman Frank Hodsoll said in announcing the
grants Tuesday.
   ``Among this nation's greatest treasures is our rich and varied
traditional heritage,'' Hodsoll said. ``Through these awards, we
seek to honor America's great traditional artists _ those who
successfully preserve and pass on the artistic legacy of their
forebears and enrich our culture.''
   ``In a way, it's a celebration of ourselves in all of our
glorious diversity,'' said Dan Sheehy, assistant director of the
endowment's folk arts program, which initiated the awards in 1982
to honor master practitioners of the traditional arts.
   The awards will be presented to the recipients formally at a
ceremony on Sept. 29 in Washington.
   The recipients included Amber Densmore, 87, of Chelsea, Vt., who
has made countless quilts, bedspreads, lace doilies and hooked rugs
in her lifetime but has never sold a single piece of work.
   In a statement issued by NEA, she said, ``I've given it all
away. You'll just have to go and see my grandchildren.''
   Arthel ``Doc'' Watson, 65, an Appalachian guitar player and
singer from Deep Gap, N.C., recently announced his plans to retire
after 26 years on the road. Watson, who was blinded at age 2 and
first picked up a guitar at 12, has won four Grammy awards from the
National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
   Yang Fang Nhu, who was born in a small Hmong mountain village in
northern Laos in 1912, came to the United States with her husband,
Yang Nouyi, in 1984. She is a master weaver and embroiderer and is
passing on her skills to her daughter-in-law, with whom she and her
husband currently live in Detroit.
   The other award recipients were:
   Pedro Ayala, 77, a Mexican-American accordion player from Donna,
Texas.
   Kepka Belton, 54, a Czech-American egg painter from Ellsworth,
Kan.
   Michael Flatley, 30, an Irish-American stepdancer from Chicago.
   Sister Rosalia Haberl, 91, a German-American bobbin lacemaker
from Hankinson, N.D.
   John Dee Holeman, 58, an Afro-American dancer, musician and
singer from Durham, N.C.
   Kenny Sidle, 57, an Anglo-American fiddler in the Midwest
tradition from Newark, Ohio.
   Albert Luandrew, 81, also known as ``Sunnyland Slim,'' an
Afro-American blues pianist and singer from Chicago.
   Willie Mae Ford Smith, 82, an Afro-American gospel singer from
St. Louis.
   Clyde Sproat, 60, a Hawaiian cowboy singer and ukulele player
from Kapaau, Hawaii.
