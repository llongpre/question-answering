<DESCRIPT>  THEATER; SHOW; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  'BELLE Reprieve" should have been a hoot. But it ain't.;   When two gay
theater troupes -- a London company called Bloolips and a New York lesbian
company called Split Britches -- set out to deconstruct "A Streetcar Named
Desire," they ought to have had only one problem: culling the material into a
manageable show.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     They culled, all right, but eccentrically. Eight irrelevant songs -- nine
if you count the overture, a lesbian revision of "Someone to Watch Over Me" --
have been inserted, as well as a fairy with a ukulele, whom I don't recall
from "Streetcar" (but perhaps I've got one of those expurgated '50s
editions).;   In order to embarrass us with all these riches, the
actor-writers have unencumbered the play of plot, structure and through-line.;
  Lord knows there's enough to parody in Tennessee Williams, for the first
half of his life one of the most miserable homosexuals on record and for the
last half one of the drunkest.;   Literature critics have had a field day with
gender analyses of his work. The great roles he wrote for women -- Blanche in
"Streetcar" and Maggie the Cat -- are thinly disguised portraits of himself,
and the men in their lives are brutal, like Stanley Kowalski, or aloof and
enigmatic, like Brick in "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," or charming heels, as both
also are.;   However, Split Britches and Bloolips explore this fertile ground
only in the last eight minutes of their play, prefacing the tragicomic
gender-bender confrontation of Blanche and Stanley with 112 other minutes of
nonsense.;   Some of it's funny; a lot is tasteless; some is just there. The
title, for instance, is a parody: The old plantation in "Streetcar" is Belle
Reve, pronounced reeve. Nothing much comes of it.;   But a few bits are right
on the mark, such as a bathtub dialogue between Blanche and Stella that
lampoons every crossed-purpose conversation Williams ever wrote. And the
script is cleverly intercut with passages from "The Glass Menagerie,"
"Suddenly Last Summer" and (I think) a lot of the later,REVIEW; forgettable
plays; and -- of course -- Bette Davis movies. (This is, after all, gay
theater.);   But all of it could have been scrapped in favor of starting at
Point A and progressing, just for laughs, to Point B and so on. That shows you
how boring and Aristotelian I am.;   Blanche is played by "Bette Bourne," a
co-founder of Bloolips, who looks like Vivien Leigh in an advanced state of
decay. He whistles quite operatically. Mitch, played by one "Precious Pearl,"
acts grayly but plays the ukulele very well for a beginner.;   Stella and
Stanley are enacted by Lois Weaver and Peggy Shaw, co-founders of Split
Britches and longtime partners who are mostly interested in "getting those
colored lights going." Their acting is indescribable, though "lousy" gets us
about halfway there, until Weaver's Marilyn Monroe parody, which leaves me
speechless.;   I am not given to comment on women's physical attributes, but
Shaw in the famous Stanley Kowalski singlet, sans bra, is not a sight for the
faint-hearted.;   The cast taps rather neatly, and its singing is bearable
when covered by the piano, whose ivories were tickled by one "Laka Daisical."
Pearl does a wonderful straight-faced recitation of "My Way," whose words are
three times as dumb when divorced from their monotonous melody. I liked the
two cream-pie jokes and the dancing votive candles.;   This thing, whose West
Coast premiere is being presented by Theater Rhino, won an Obie Award this
year -- and for "ensemble performance," no less, a quality that shows up only
in the tap-dance finale. There are several possible answers: The jury was
asleep, the other contenders were desperately bad, the jury was asleep . . . I
vote for the first and last.; Belle Reprieve; Bloolips/Split Britches;
