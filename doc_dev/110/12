Bob Geldof, musician, is back. 
</P>
<P>
Not St. Bob, the humanitarian of British tabloid headlines. Not Sir Bob, 
knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1986, nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize that 
same year. Not author Bob, who's already written a best-selling autobiography, 
"Is That It?" And not businessman Bob, who oversaw millions and millions of 
dollars in contributions for the starving Third World. 
</P>
<P>
Geldof remains chairman of the board of trustees of Band Aid, although he says 
the organization will cease to exist fairly soon. But his main focus these days 
is "The Vegetarians of Love," his critically acclaimed second solo album. 
</P>
<P>
This is no Boomtown Rats rock 'n' roll extravaganza; Geldof has instead 
assembled a mostly acoustic band featuring accordion, violins, flute, tin 
whistle, mandolin and ukulele. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, I suppose, it's simply a reaction to stuff I hear on the radio which I 
don't like -- basically, house music and New Kids on the Block or Kylie 
Minogue," Geldof said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
For the new album, Geldof enlisted an old friend -- ex-Rats bassist Pete 
Briquette -- and four traditional musicians he had never met. They recorded 28 
songs in five days; any song that didn't click after three takes was thrown 
out. Geldof improvised many of the lyrics on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
The spontaneity shows. On "A Gospel Song," Geldof tells the band "middle eight 
coming up" during an instrumental break. Geldof asks at the start of another 
cut, "Are we rolling?" And at the end of "The Great Song of Indifference," the 
entire band is heard laughing loudly. 
</P>
<P>
"Indifference" is already a Top 40 hit in Britain. "The last thing everybody 
expected was this Irish pub song. And it became a big dance hit, you know? 
Thirteenth-Century dance music," said Geldof, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
After almost a decade as front man for the New Wave-era Boomtown Rats, Geldof 
became a household name in 1984 by organizing the cream of British musicians to 
record "Do They Know It's Christmas?" to raise money for African famine 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
That was followed by USA for Africa's "We Are the World" and the 
internationally televised Live Aid benefit. For two years, Geldof met with 
heads of state and political power brokers; the scruffy Irishman was 
photographed with everyone from Nobelist Mother Teresa to British Prime 
Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Geldof looks back on those days with pride tempered by the realization that 
there was only so much that could be done. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, I never said we were going to stop world poverty or world hunger. I 
said it was a Band-Aid. 'You don't put a Band-Aid on a gaping wound,' if I 
remember, was the quote at the time," Geldof said. 
</P>
<P>
"That wasn't the function, to stop world hunger. It was to raise the issue to 
the top of the political agenda, and we did that."
