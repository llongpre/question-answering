   Neil Young had just seen the movie
``Spinal Tap'' for the first time. And his life took on new
meaning.
   ``That's my life. My life is `Spinal Tap,''' said Young,
reaching for the morning's first cup of coffee.
   The 1984 mock documentary follows hapless rockers on tour, their
future imperiled by a rift with the band's co-founder. Young, who
turned 45 on Nov. 12, doesn't struggle like those low-rent
musicians. He was, though, estranged, saying a few years ago he
never would play again with longtime companions Crazy Horse.
   But now Young has recorded an album with the legendary bar band.
   Awestruck critics say ``Ragged Glory'' resurrects Young's
spontaneous, hard-driving rock 'n' roll. That freewheeling sound
was shelved at times in favor of Young's acoustic ballads and
country rock on solo albums and collaborations with Mynah Birds,
Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills and Nash.
   Young said the time was right to reunite with Crazy Horse. Any
bad blood between him and the band is forgotten.
   ``Crazy Horse is a band that I'm a part of,'' said Young,
wearing his standard uniform: jeans, T-shirt, tennis shoes, Ray
Bans and stubble. ``I lead the band, yeah. But I'm just a member.
It's like returning to your roots. It brings me back to where I
started.''
   Two of Young's most popular and acclaimed albums - 1975's
``Tonight's the Night'' and 1979's ``Rust Never Sleeps'' - were
recorded with Crazy Horse. Their first effort together was 1969's
``Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.'' Their last was 1986's
``Life.''
   Crazy Horse's own new album is titled ``Left for Dead'' in part,
the band members say, because Young and others in the business
abandoned them. In ``Ragged Glory,'' Young is joined by Crazy
Horse's guitarist Frank Sampedro, bassist Billy Talbot and drummer
Ralph Molina.
   ``It may be the best one I've ever done with them,'' Young said.
``It's even. And that's a little peculiar. There's not one song
that really stands out.''
   Last year, Young released what some considered the best album of
1989 and perhaps of his career: ``Freedom.'' Young, who's hardly
given to flowery self-promotion, believes ``Ragged Glory'' is
superior.
   ``I was amazed at the success of `Freedom,' not because I didn't
think it was good, but I was surprised that its shortcomings were
not mentioned more often,'' Young said.
   And what were these shortcomings? ``Well, `Ragged Glory' has
what `Freedom' doesn't have,'' he said. ```Freedom' was OK to
listen to; it's got all the soft songs. But in this album, we'll
lose all the people who like the soft songs.''
   Indeed, only one track on ``Ragged Glory'' - ``Days That Used to
Be'' - could be considered contemplative both lyrically and
musically.
   Filled with longing reminiscences of the '60s - ``Psychedelic
music fills the air, Peace and love live there still'' - the
melancholy song says that personal dreams are threatened by
``possessions and concessions.''
   ``I usually shy away from this kind of song,'' Young said a few
days before setting off on another trip on his sailboat. ``I was in
the middle of the ocean on my boat, halfway between here and there,
and had been there for about 10 days. No airplanes. No other boats.
No noise. But I did see a couple of humpback whales. The song came
to me.''
   The album was recorded at Young's 2,000-acre ranch.
   The band doesn't rehearse, arranges on the spot and avoids
re-recording takes to cover glitches or raw edges. The album stands
like a piece of unfinished furniture.
   ``It doesn't matter how you get it as long as it sounds good in
the end,'' said bassist Talbot. ``People make music, not the
instruments. It's just us hanging out together.''
   On a whim, the band recorded the R&amp;B classic ``Farmer John'' for
the album, even though Young was the only one who knew how to play
it. That carefree approach carries over to Young's songwriting,
too.
   ``I don't sit down and say I'll play a G or something. It's
mindless. It's the other way around from what most people think. It
comes to you and you grab it and then find out what it is.''
   Young was born in Toronto and received a ukulele as a Christmas
gift at age 13. He joined the Squires in 1963, and met Stephen
Stills soon thereafter; he teamed with Stills in Buffalo
Springfield and Crosby, Stills Nash &amp; Young.
   Throughout his career, he has been irreverent. His 1988 song,
``This Note's for You,'' a critique of commercialism in the music
business, yielded a controversial and award-winning video.
   ``I'm the lost character in this place because I don't know
where I fit,'' Young said. ``The record company is building an
image, grooming you. I have no idea what that's all about. Where do
I fit with this?''
