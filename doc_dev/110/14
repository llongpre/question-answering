<LEADPARA>  NOBODY, but nobody, has done more for Broadway dance than Jerome Robbins.;   
He broke into show biz at a time when "musical theater" meant glorified revues
or plays-with-inserted-songs, and he changed all that. He invented theatrical
dance that established the mood, advanced the plot, described and shaped
character -- and was, still and foremost, fabulous dance. All the while, he
maintained a productive profile in classical ballet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" was his slightly belated 70th birthday gift (it
opened in 1989, when he was 71) to the street that saw his greatest successes,
including such landmark works as "West Side Story" (1957) and "Fiddler on the
Roof" (1964).;    I can't begrudge the national tour (which pulled into the
Golden Gate Theater this week for a limited engagement that ends Sept. 8) its
advance sales, because Robbins' work is so wonderful that seeing this much of
it under any circumstances is a must. But I think it could look better than it
does.;    It contains excerpts from nine shows, including major set-pieces
from "Billion-Dollar Baby" (1945), "High-Button Shoes" (1947) and "The King
and I" (1951), and a 40-minute chunk of "West Side Story" that includes all
the big dance numbers.;    But what's the connection, besides Robbins? The
libretto is bald and haphazard, and it gets no assist at all from Paul
Kreppel's unengaging performance as the narrator (as well as Tevye in
"Fiddler" and Pseudolus in "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum").
The approach is neither chronological nor thematic; if it's based on anything
at all, it's backstage traffic (How many dancers need to make a costume change
here? And how fast can they do it?) -- which is no way to plan a show of this
size and scope.;    The company is unmemorable, except for Leilani Jones, a
Hawaiian-born performer who croons the show's unknown song, the sinuous "Mr.
Monotony," in a tigress' purr. She's also the fiery Anita in "America" from
"West Side Story" (which is done in its stage version, as an all-female
number). Fortunately, her miscastings -- as the narrator for "The Small House
of Uncle Thomas" (the Siamese "Uncle Tom's Cabin" in "The King and I") and
Grandma Tzeitel in the dream sequence of "Fiddler" -- were disguised by her
costumes.;    A New York City Ballet dancer, Alexia Hess, is the putative
leaddancer, but her roles are limited to colorless non-dance parts: Maria in
the cha-cha from "West Side Story" and the shy girl, Louise, who isn't yet
grown into Gypsy Rose Lee when three strippers strut their stuff for her in
"You Gotta Have a Gimmick" from "Gypsy.";    But the choreography makes up for
all. Robbins is brilliant and versatile, and there's something of all his
gifts here. The beach-cabana sequence from "High-Button Shoes" is an
affectionate parody of all Mack Sennett production numbers, but it also zips
through the plot and perpetrators with clarity and economy, like one of those
portraits you used to be able to buy for a dime from a seaside sketcher. And
it's wonderfully funny.;    So is the Charleston from "Billion-Dollar Baby,"
which presents every cliche of the Prohibition era -- flappers, coppers,
gangsters, bootleggers and speakeasy sophisticates with raccoon coats, porkpie
hats and ukuleles -- in a wild chase and great dance number all in one.;   
"Uncle Thomas" brightly mixes Balinese dance and Chinese and Japanese
classical theatrics with a dash of humor and a dash of pathos, reconciling the
contradictions in Eastern and Western storytelling even as it exploits them.
"Gimmick" is pure shtick, but what shtick! And its innocence somehow cancels
its hard-bitten subject matter (the exploitation of women's bodies).;    And
for pure dance-drama, what has ever topped "West Side Story"? The dangerous
beauty of its disaffected teen-agers, their exuberant claim on territory and
time, the moves that combine menace and vulnerability -- after all the years
and so many imitations, these still read as powerfully as when they first
appeared. (Incidentally, I just saw "West Side Story" and "The King and I" on
video, and Robbins' dances survive virtually intact in both, though in "West
Side Story" the brilliant camera-work -- directed by Robbins for the dance
sequences -- require you to be an active partner in making sense out of the
choreographic whole.);    It's too bad the show looks so scrappy -- not
disgraceful, but not quite polished. Robbins is supposed to be a fierce
perfectionist, but this production doesn't look as though a perfectionist got
anywhere near it. The dancers have a lot of energy and exuberance and nearly
every number is attractive, but the dazzle meridian remains stubbornly
uncrossed. And a few pieces -- e.g., "Comedy Tonight" from "Forum" -- are
positively unkempt.;    As if that weren't enough damning with faint praise,
the design is dullsville. The original designers -- Raoul Pene du Bois, Irene
Sharaff, Tony Walton, Patricia Zipprodt, Boris Aronson, Jo Mielziner and
Oliver Smith, among others -- are credited in the program, but the costumes
look as though they came out of stock and the backdrops like charmless,
quickie cartoons. (Did the Sharks and Jets in the original production wear
matching letter jackets, as if they were neighborhood softball teams?) A
national touring show with this budget shouldn't look like this.;     Jerome
Robbins' Broadway; Through: Sept. 8; Where: Golden Gate Theater, 1 Taylor St.,
San Francisco; Tickets: $22-$45. BASS; Parking: $6 at adjacent garage and
nearby lots  </TEXT>
