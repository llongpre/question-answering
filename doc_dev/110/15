<LEADPARA>  What's that? You say your plans for a Hawaiian vacation died somewhere between
the mortgage payment and the car-insurance premium? You can stop crying into
that floral-print shirt and cheer up -- because two of the most-acclaimed
practitioners of real Hawaiian music are on their way to the Bay Area.;   
Raymond Kane, probably Hawaii's greatest living slack-key guitar player, spent
more than 60 years mastering the unwritten rules of the folk idiom. His
intricate guitar style -- with rhythm and lead played simultaneously -- and
his resonant, haunting vocals are one-of-a-kind. George Kuo is a master
ukulele player and, like Kane, an accomplished storyteller and folk-historian.  </LEADPARA>
