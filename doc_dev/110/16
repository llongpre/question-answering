With the Broadway theatre season still a few weeks off, Bette Midler is
about the only show in New York these days. She is playing a six-week stint
at Radio City Music Hall, where her famously loyal following is paying up to
Dollars 100 per ticket to Experience the Divine, as the concert is called.
(Though the run, which ends October 23, is ostensibly sold out, there are
returns available at Radio City most evenings).
Midler has not appeared in a major concert for 10 years - she has been busy
becoming internationally famous - and there was much speculation about which
Bette we were going to see: the raunchy, raucous 'Divine Miss M', who got
her start singing in gay bathhouses in the 1970s, or the kinder, gentler
1980s Bette, she of Disney films (Down and Out in Beverly Hills, Beaches)
and treacly top-10 pop songs (From a Distance, Wind Beneath my Wings).
Experience the Diviney mixture of both Bettes. Alternately brassy and coy,
loud and girlish, belting and crooning, Midler owns the stage; she is simply
one of the best live entertainers around (two of America's other great divas
 -Shirley MacLaine and Liza Minnelli - were in the audience, adding to the
starry frisson). Platinum blond and slender, Midler has never looked better,
and she knows it; one of her first songs is a playful rap called 'I Look
Good'. She is well into her forties, but her asides about 'being too old for
this' are clearly disingenuous; the show lasts three hours, and Midler's
energy never flags.
Midler knows that her ballads are what the audience - mostly middle-aged
suburbanites - wants, and she works through them all, backed with
appropriate lushness by a seven-piece band. But the concert's divinest
moments are when she is in high-attitude mode; she hits her stride halfway
through the first set with her torchy old hit 'Delta Dawn' ('This song's
from the 70s . . . as are most of you. Hell, so am I]')
The brassy spirit of Sophie Tucker, the legendary vaudeville performer and
Midler's idol, hangs over the concert, and Midler conjures her directly in a
series of bawdy jokes she delivers as 'Soph'. Midler's onstage identity,
like Tucker's, has much to do with her Jewishness, and she gets a lot of
comic mileage out of the recent High Holy Days and out of current political
events ('Oy] This food] If Yassir Arafat knew what our food was like, this
treaty would be off in a second]'). She finishes off the first set with a
rousing 'Rose's Turn' from the classic Jule Styne musical Gypsy, a nifty
piece of advertising for a television version of the musical that she is
starring in this autumn.
The second set veers quickly into high camp, with a routine that Midler
aficionados found hilarious but which mystified me - the performer was in
the guise of Dolores Delago, a blue-tailed mermaid in a motorised wheelchair
who spouts self-help palaver.
While the band and backup singers (who Midler calls 'The Harlettes') make
their way through a ukulele number (a tribute, perhaps, to Midler's roots;
she was born and raised in Hawaii), Midler changes into a sophisticated
beige cocktail dress and then offers a particularly committed rendition of
the classic wailer, 'Stay With Me, Baby'.
An old-fashioned entertainer, Midler ends the concert with old-fashioned
good manners, coming out after the final encore to wish the audience
good-night and tell them they are fabulous. So is she.
