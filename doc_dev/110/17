<LEADPARA>  CATCH a wave that really cranks, one that is powerful and fast, and you're
shredding. Challenge one that breaks precariously close to shore, and it's
hairball. And fall in dramatic fashion, and you've had a flaming wipeout.;  
This is the vocabulary of surfers, who embrace the sea air, brave the chilly
waters and dive into their favorite activity along the Southern California
coast and other surfing spots across the globe.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It's also the kind of talk that can be heard at the Huntington Beach
International Surfing Museum.;   At a time when surfing museums are becoming
more popular -- with museums in Santa Cruz, Mission Beach, Ventura and Sydney,
Australia -- the 2,200-square-foot facility stands apart. Opened in July 1988,
the museum is billed as the world's largest tribute to surfing. "It offers a
unique, international collection of surfboards and surfing-related artifacts,"
said Ann Beasley, the non-profit museum's executive officer.;   It also
provides an education in surfing, say museum visitors and professional
surfers.;    A little perspective; "I'm happy that young kids can go to a
place where they can take an interest in surfing and (find out) where it all
came from. It adds a little depth and perspective to the sport," said David
Nuuhiwa of Oceanside, a five-time national surfing champion during the late
1960s and early 1970s. Now 42, Nuuhiwa surfs professionally on the masters
circuit.;   Tom Andrusky of Huntington Beach, a non-surfer visiting the museum
for the fourth time, said he was impressed with the presentation of surfing
history.;   "You can learn a lot in a very short time in a very small space,"
Andrusky said.;   For example, he discovered that Capt. James Cook of the
British navy first documented surfing in 1778, after he witnessed natives
using large boards to slide along waves off the Sandwich Islands, later to be
called Hawaii. The origins of surfing are unknown, however.;   Closer to home,
Hawaiian surfer George Freeth is credited with introducing the sport to
Southern California in 1907, and the rest is gnarly history, dude.;   Surfing
has given a major boost to the economy of Southern California, said
Assemblyman Tom Mays, R-Huntington Beach, an avid surfer.;   "It's generated a
whole new business -- surfing-related sportswear companies," he said. "And
it's generated a lot of tourist dollars over the years.";   The museum
highlights surfing's contributions, Mays added. "It shows people in the area
how surfing has affected us," he said.;   As visitors walk into the museum,
they are greeted by volunteer docents. The first exhibit is the International
Surfing Hall of Fame, which describes surfing legends and their contributions
to the sport. Included is Hawaiian surfer Duke Kahanamoku, who tamed the waves
of Oahu's northern shores and formed the island's first hui nalu, or surf
club, in 1907. He helped popularize the sport in the 1920s and was dubbed the
father of surfing. A bust of Kahanamoku was moved to the museum last year from
its longtime perch at the base of the Huntington Beach pier.;    Belly boards;
A few steps away is the museum's main attraction -- the surfboard exhibit. The
boards are lined up chronologically, by decades, spanning from 1900 to 1960.; 
 The oldest is a turn-of-the-century wooden belly board, or body board, from
Hawaii. Surfers would ride the waves while lying flat on the boards, which
measure less than three feet in length. They were developed in the 1840s,
after Hawaii's King Kamehameha I decreed that only priests and royalty could
surf standing up -- to be closer to God.;   Toward the end of the century, the
edict was no longer enforced, and surfing enthusiasts started making longer
boards again.;   The surfboard exhibit includes a 1930 wooden model that
weighs 135 pounds and measures more than 12 1/2 feet. There also are several
of the original polyurethane boards, which were introduced in 1957 as a
lighter alternative to the bulky, wooden standards. Many of today's
polyurethane boards weigh less than 30 pounds and measure less than five
feet.;    Beach Boys music; Surfing posters, artwork and historic photos --
including a shot of Faye Baird, credited as the first female surfer --
decorate the walls. Baird is pictured getting ready to catch a wave off
Mission Beach on New Year's Eve 1927.;   Baird challenged the waves in a
woolen, one-piece bathing suit. Her midnight run was lighted by flares held by
other surfers, Beasley said. Now in her 80s, Baird lives in San Diego.;  
Surfing music blares from speakers near the museum's record collection, which
features the album covers of such greats as the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean and
the Safaris.;   Memorabilia from Huntington Beach's Surf Theater, which
operated from the 1960s to 1987 and featured only surfing movies, is housed in
a corner of the museum called "Any Way to the Beach." Surfing clothes and
jewelry are displayed in the same section.;   There is a 1940s Hawaiian shirt,
adorned with silk-screened prints of ukuleles, leis and breaking waves.
According to surfing legend, the person who wore the wildest Hawaiian shirt on
a surfing outing was dubbed king or queen for the day.;   Nearby are examples
of other clothing popularized by surfers, including the long shorts known as
jams and huarache sandals -- made in Mexico using leather straps and portions
of rubber tires for soles.;   Jewelry from the 1950s includes necklaces made
of small, carved dolphins, shark's teeth and tikis -- ornamental Polynesian
gods.;   Other highlights include a small library of surfing books, a gift
shop, a photographic tribute to woodies -- the old wood-paneled station wagons
favored by surfers -- and an exhibit dedicated to the heroes of lifesaving.;
