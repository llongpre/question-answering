<P>
We just got back from our first visit to Hawaii. All we had known about those 
islands before we went was what we'd read and a few things we'd heard from 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, talking about Waikiki, said, "Nobody goes there any more because 
it's too crowded." 
</P>
<P>
Worse, others said that the Old Hawaii was "fading fast and that the old ways 
would soon be gone." 
</P>
<P>
Our first three days were at Waikiki. The palms; the trade winds; the scent of 
plumeria and dozens of other flowers, a sea with hundreds of greens and blues. 
We loved it all. That Hawaii was intact. 
</P>
<P>
But the other complaint, that Hawaii "was slipping further and further from the 
old ways," was a little harder to deal with or even define. 
</P>
<P>
On our fourth day we flew to the Big Island. We were going for a continuation 
of our vacation, but because some of the experts had said that the first 
settlers had gone to the Big Island first, it seemed a likelier place to look 
for answers. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Biggest Island 
</P>
<P>
The state of Hawaii is the whole archipelago. But the southernmost island of 
Hawaii, the "Big Island," is the largest of the group. It is also, at a million 
years, so young that it's still under "construction." 
</P>
<P>
Mauna Kea, one of its two volcanoes, is in eruption. Its lava, flowing across 
the land and into the sea, makes the island a little bigger each day. Evidence 
of earlier eruptions is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Kona Airport is on part of an 1801 lava flow. For the entire 25-mile drive 
north from the airport to our first hotel, the Mauna Lani Bay, the road was 
over uninterrupted lava beds. 
</P>
<P>
At a small sign saying Mauna Lani Bay, we turned off the highway. Suddenly, we 
weren't driving through the shiny black flow-lava anymore. We were in a green 
belt of golf courses and trees, then lush vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel and its grounds were startling. Just past the reception area was an 
atrium, a half-acre open to the sky, with growing flowers, shrubs, trees 
reaching up six floors, birds and even a lagoon and waterfalls. 
</P>
<P>
For the next three days, though, we both felt some mistake had been made, that 
we were in Shangri-La rather than Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
We moved to our next hotel, the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa, a few miles farther up 
the road, simply because we'd heard so much about it. 
</P>
<P>
If the Mauna Lani had seemed a little out of place, the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa 
was another world entirely. It had 1,600 rooms, and you had the option of 
taking either a boat or a train to get to and from the main lobby. Management 
advised you to allow 15 minutes to make the trip. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem to bother Joyce, so I kept myself in check, figuring I could 
always wax indignant later. But what with the pools, lagoons, trade winds and 
flowers, after an hour or so I couldn't remember, to save my neck, what I had 
wanted to be indignant about. The New Hawaii wasn't so bad. 
</P>
<P>
Later, at dinner with other hotel guests, the subject of the Islands' past 
"slipping away" came up again. There was some debate as to just what that past 
was. 
</P>
<P>
Was it Don Ho and a rum drink? Was it ukuleles and hula girls? Or was it a 
people living on fish, poi, breadfruit and pineapple, waiting and never knowing 
what they were waiting for, unless it was for Pele to make her next move? 
</P>
<P>
One woman told me that if I was really looking for the Old Hawaii I ought to be 
talking to an old Hawaiian, and she had just the right person in mind. 
</P>
<P>
"The man is 64 years old. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Incredible," I said. "People still get that old?" 
</P>
<P>
His name was Jimmy Tohara and he was the chief plumber at another hotel, the 
Mauna Kea. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Golf Courses and Gardens 
</P>
<P>
The next morning while Joyce had breakfast in bed, I drove to another oasis of 
golf courses and gardens, in the center of which was the Mauna Kea. It was 
magnificent. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Tohara had a smile that filled his whole face. As we walked to a place 
where we could talk, I told him how impressed I was with his workplace. He 
seemed to take it personally. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, this is one of the oldest hotels on the Kohala Coast," Jimmy said. 
"I've worked here for 25 years and I still notice the beauty every day. 
Everything belongs -- art pieces, even the people. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us have been here most of our lives, and our children come to work 
here, too. We get second-generation guests. When something gets this right, you 
don't want to change it." 
</P>
<P>
He led me into a dining room that was not serving and we sat down. Jimmy's 
reaction to my "old ways" question surprised me. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to know whether we're getting away from the old ways? I hope so. This 
is a land where, at one time, the penalty for letting your shadow fall on the 
pathway of the king was instant death. Where a child born with anything wrong, 
even a birthmark, was not allowed to live. Old ways?" 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Little Problem 
</P>
<P>
He raised his brows, took off his glasses and polished them. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think people even want the 'not-quite-so-old' ways." 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy told me about something that had happened 25 years before. When the hotel 
had been new there had been a little problem with the water. Though it was 
pure, on its way down from the snows on 13,000-foot Mauna Loa it tended to 
acquire the color of tea. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the guests called me," he said. "She said, 'Look at that water. It's 
brown. You can't expect me to bathe in that water, much less drink it.' " 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing I could do. I acted like I was really offended. 'Lady,' I 
said, 'that water comes from the Goddess Pele. You have heard of King 
Kamehameha with his bodyguard so big and strong. Seven feet tall with muscles 
hard as teak. It's because all their lives they drink this water. No other 
water, this water.' 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Natural Springs 
</P>
<P>
At that point he poured himself a glass of water, drank it down, took a deep 
breath, stood up as straight as he could and left. "I was trying to grow before 
her eyes. It must have worked. I never heard from her again." 
</P>
<P>
He laughed at the memory. "Now we tap natural springs and the water is as clean 
and clear as the sky." 
</P>
<P>
"A long time ago I found a couple of steering sweeps, the big oars they put on 
canoes to steer with. I cleaned them up and put them on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
"When people asked me what they were, I told them they were blades from 
Hawaiian helicopters, that we had them here hundreds of years ago and that we 
didn't need engines because we always had the trade winds." 
</P>
<P>
Then I said, "You aren't above making up a legend yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"I would never do that," he said, trying to keep his face straight. "But that 
business about bad luck coming to people who take the lava rock from Pele's 
volcanoes for souvenirs . . . you know how that started? 
</P>
<P>
"I heard it was a bus driver who got tired of all the tourists bringing the 
dirty rocks onto his nice clean bus, so he made up the legend." 
</P>
<P>
"Jimmy," I asked, "would you take a lava souvenir from the volcano?" The 
question seemed to startle him. 
</P>
<P>
"You think I'm crazy?!" he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"But most of our legends can be explained," he said. "Hawaiian fishermen throw 
a bucket over the side, bring up water and drink it. Haoles (foreigners) try 
it, get sick and a legend is born. Hawaiians can drink sea water. Hawaiians are 
magic." 
</P>
<P>
"How do they do that?" I asked. He ignored the question. 
</P>
<P>
"Magic, I tell you, magic. A million years, maybe all our lava breaks down into 
soil, huh? The people who build these hotels don't want to wait; they crush the 
lava, bring in topsoil and fill it with plantings from all over the Pacific 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
"And birds, do you think they would be here? These hotels brought in the birds. 
Now there are birds all over the Kohala Coast, and they take the seeds of our 
flowers all over the island. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of these hotels there is employment where there was none before and 
visitors can come from all over the world to enjoy Hawaii. I think maybe the 
new ways are worth considering too, huh? 
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow night there will be a hukilau on the beach, at the Royal Waikoloan, a 
luau with fish instead of pork. You go and take your wife and you may see some 
of the best of the old ways." 
</P>
<P>
I was mad at myself for feeling any resentment about the big hotels' 
"intrusions." I had not considered how they figured in the island's economy and 
how their existence made advancement possible for so many people. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the hotel, the information was available. Since opening in 1988 the 
Waikoloa resort alone has pumped an estimated $50 million into Hawaii's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
$4,000 a Day 
</P>
<P>
It spent $4,000 a day on produce alone that it bought from farmers. It required 
so much staff that the hotel had to run daily buses to Hilo, on the other side 
of the island, to bring people to work and then take them home. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce and I went to the hukilau on the beach the next night. Young people in 
native costume danced against a background of the sea and a setting sun to the 
music of drums, ukuleles and the trade winds in the palms. 
</P>
<P>
When it got dark, torches were lighted and food was served. 
</P>
<P>
Toward the end of the evening I talked with one of the girls who had been 
dancing for us. I told her about how I'd been asking around about the Old 
Hawaii and of what I'd learned so far. 
</P>
<P>
I told her that it was probably good that the islands were changing, that the 
local people were getting a share of the prosperity. It might have been that I 
couldn't keep the disappointment out of my voice. 
</P>
<P>
She touched my arm. 
</P>
<P>
"No," she said, "don't feel that way. I know what you feel. I have children and 
I'm grateful that, thanks to the people who visit us, I'll be able to send them 
to college. But because we have gained something it doesn't mean we've lost 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
"It's all still here." 
</P>
<P>
She took my hands. 
</P>
<P>
"All my life my grandmother would take my hands, like this, and look into my 
eyes and say, 'Hold on, hold on.' I think it was the last thing she said to me 
before she died. 'Hold on.' 
</P>
<P>
"We have a word -- malama. It means 'stewardship,' a knowing and caring 
stewardship. My grandmother had taught me and my mother the old ways, as her 
mother had taught her. She was telling me to hold on to them, hold on to the 
traditions. Don't ever let them go. And I haven't, and neither will my children 
and their children. The old ways are here." 
</P>
<P>
I nodded toward the torch-lighted stage amid the palms. "Here?" 
</P>
<P>
"No." She touched the area over her heart. "Here."
