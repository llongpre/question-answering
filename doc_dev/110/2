   Taking ukuleles to Hawaii
sounds about as misplaced as shipping coals to Newcastle.
   But that's what 25 Vancouver-area students, aged 9 to 19, are
doing this week.
   ``Even though the ukulele is the key instrument in their society
_ it's as Hawaiian as the grass skirt _ the school authorities over
there want to learn the Canadian teaching methods we use which are
so successful,'' said Peter Luongo, vice principal and music
specialist at Alice Brown elementary.
   The school has become so skilled at teaching the four-stringed,
guitarlike instrument that word has reached Hawaii.
   The ukulele, introduced from Portugal into the Hawaiian Islands
about 1879, was first used in Canadian schools in the Maritime
provinces about 20 years ago to teach music, he said.
   ``It came to Langley about 15 years ago and we got some really
keen kids,'' he said. ``I picked up the program when I came here
and developed a senior honors group.''
   The students have played in concerts across Canada and will pay
for most of the 10-day trip beginning Thursday.
   ``We will be given a lot of hospitality but we'll be going to
schools that are very meager compared to ours and I think our
students will learn a lot about the other side of Hawaii _ it's not
all plush hotels,'' Luongo said.

   Marleen Suess wanted an undergraduate degree,
and knew it was just a matter of finding the time.
   Ms. Suess, an accounts supervisor for H.J. Heinz Co., expects to
graduate from Robert Morris College in 1992, just 12 years and 29
semesters after enrolling.
   ``I'm on the 12-year plan,'' said Ms. Suess, 40, of Dorseyville.
``When I started, I knew I would definitely finish no matter how
long it would take.''
   She now has 90 credits and a 3.67 grade point average.
   Ms. Suess said she returned to college to advance her career.
After her divorce, she said, ``I knew I had to take care of
myself.''
   She initially was afraid she would be unable to juggle her job,
schoolwork and housework. ``Now I realize that's silly. You can
always find the time,'' she said.

   Two dozen students discovered that being
a parent to an egg can really scramble your life.
   Third-grade teacher Charla Easley gave her students at Ima Dell
Fitzgerald Elementary School hard-boiled eggs to name, clothe and
nurture for one week as a firsthand lesson about the
responsibilities of parenthood.
   The students were given $100 in play money with which they could
pay to leave their eggs in day care _ at the back of the classroom
_ if they wanted some free time. Overnight care was available at
$10 a night.
   The ``eggs-perience'' was eye-opening, the students said.
   The high cost of day care forced Espie Randolph to take his
``daughter,'' Jessica, everywhere, he said.
   ``She really got on my nerves,'' Espie said. ``I had to take her
to the park, to the mall, and even on the bus.''
   ``I thought raising a kid would be a lot easier,'' said
9-year-old John Moffett.
   Moffett said he is glad the shell game is over and has plans for
his triplets.
   ``I'm going to throw them in the trash compactor,'' he said.
