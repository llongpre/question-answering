   Country music performer Roy Clark, the
longtime star of the ``Hee Haw'' TV show, thinks the cornpone
program would be received well in the Soviet Union.
   Clark has made two concert tours of the Soviet Union, most
recently giving 12 performances last November. He previously made
18 concert appearances in 1976.
   ``I'm sure they would be bewildered by the corny jokes, but the
overall image of `Hee Haw' would be compatible with their
entertainment,'' Clark said in an interview. ``They are interested
in the history of the American West such as the cowboys.
   ``You see audiences in Europe in fringe and cowboy hats and the
Soviets are the same way. They would identify with that image of
`Hee Haw.' ''
   The 56-year-old Clark, who has been host of the show since it
first aired 21 years ago, foresees an entire wave of new viewers.
   ``There's a generation of young people who get together on
Saturday nights and use it as an excuse to have a party in the
(college) dorm,'' he said. ``It's gone around and made a complete
cycle. We may become another fad. I have a feeling it will outlast
me.''
   The program, which is seen on more than 200 stations, is taped
every June and October. Clark says the fact that it's not a
months-long process has contributed to the show's longevity.
   ``This keeps it fresh,'' he said by telephone from his office in
Tulsa, Okla. ``We're not around each other enough to get on each
other's nerves. It's a natural high energy for us to perform
because it's like starting over twice a year.''
   When Clark first appeared on the show, he already had been
performing on prime-time network TV variety shows. But he said
``Hee Haw'' capped his career.
   ``This was the icing on the cake,'' he said. ``This put my face
and name together.''
   His recent appearances in the Soviet Union have embellished his
role as one of country music's major ambassadors. After his first
tour there 13 years ago, which was made with the Oak Ridge Boys,
the Country Music Association gave him the title ``international
friendship ambassador.''
   He also performed in Bulgaria last year where his concert was
broadcast live and seen by more than 500 million people in
socialist countries.
   ``There's a special feeling when you play in a foreign
country,'' Clark said. ``It's not just another concert. There is a
lot of responsibility on your shoulders.
   ``You are representing your country first of all. Also you must
represent your music well. The opinions of your performance
reflects back on all the other country music performers. If the
people don't like it, they will think that's what all of country
music is like.
   ``Your adrenalin definitely flows a little faster.''
   His appearances were taped for television broadcast throughout
Eastern Bloc countries. Soviet officials told him his concerts
would be seen by 700 million people by the time they are broadcast
and rebroadcast several times.
   In the United States, The Nashville Network on cable TV is
carrying two one-hour specials about Clark's Soviet shows.
   Clark said such a huge audience is a bit intimidating.
   ``The first thing you think about is how many mistakes you
made,'' he said, chuckling. ``You wonder how many flat notes you
hit and whether you looked tired and were at your best.
   ``But it was gratifying. There's nothing like recognition.''
   He said the Soviet people were especially interested in the
banjo. Crowds would gather at the foot of the stage to get a close
look at his instruments, especially the banjo.
   ``You could tune one up and they would love it,'' Clark said.
``They know the history of it as an authentic American instrument.
They know it speaks of our heritage. And they like that brilliant
sound of the banjo.''
   Clark, a native of Meherrin, Va., grew up in Staten Island,
N.Y., St. Clairsville, Ohio, and Washington. His father was a
computer programmer for the federal government.
   He learned to play a homemade ukulele as a youngster and got his
first guitar at age 14. He is accomplished on the 12-string guitar,
acoustic guitar, banjo and fiddle and also plays five other
instruments.
   Clark has dabbled in acting, co-starring in the 1986 movie
``Uphill All the Way'' with Mel Tillis. He's also appeared in the
TV shows ``The Odd Couple'' and ``The Beverly Hillbillies.''
   He is now approaching 30 years as a performer, having celebrated
his 25th anniversary in 1985, and his foreign concert tours are not
over. He plans to return to the Soviet Union within two years.
   ``I'd like to keep the friendship going,'' Clark said.
