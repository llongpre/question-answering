   EDITOR'S NOTE _ With so many experiments under way at the same
time, it's difficult to pinpoint television's birthplace. Among the
cities that lay claim to TV ``firsts'' is Schenectady, N.Y. There,
60 years ago, a handful of viewers witnessed the first broadcast to
television sets installed in the home.

   The flickering pink picture of a man
playing a ukulele was a small miracle in an age of wonder, all but
forgotten beyond the town once known as ``The City That Lights The
World.''
   The year was 1928, and Schenectady had grown from a sleepy
hamlet on the Erie Canal to a booming factory town where the
General Electric Co. had its headquarters and its finest research
talent.
   For two years, Ernst Fredrik Werner Alexanderson, a consulting
engineer for GE and the Radio Corporation of America, had been
tinkering with a machine that used perforated spinning disks to
transmit pictures. It was the mechanical ancestor of television.
   On Jan. 13, 1928, the first experimental television program was
broadcast from the GE lab to the Schenectady homes of Alexanderson
and two GE executives. There, scientists, company officials and
reporters gathered to peer into the pinkish light of a tiny screen,
3 inches square, mounted in a cabinet.
   The two-hour program with simulcast radio sound began with a GE
executive taking off his glasses and smoking a cigarette, followed
by a radio announcer strumming a ukulele and humming ``Ain't She
Sweet.''
   David Sarnoff, then vice president and later president of RCA,
appeared on the program and called it ``an epoch-making
development.''
   The event ``heralded another human conquest of space,'' said a
front-page story in the New York Times. It was hailed as ``the
first absolute proof of the possibility of connecting homes
throughout the world by sight as they have already been connected
by voice,'' the article continued.
   This year, WRGB, the Schenectady station which claims that day
as its birthday, is celebrating with a series of parties and
programs commemorating 60 years of television history.
   ``We're very proud of that heritage,'' says Terry Walden, WRGB's
program manager and producer of a historical documentary on the
station. ``We're the only station that can trace its history back
that far.''
   Actually, the birthdate and birthplace of television are quite
indistinct in history books. ``Television is one of the hardest
areas to pinpoint `firsts' in,'' says Eliot Sizowitch, a specialist
in radio and television history at the Smithsonian Institution.
``There were just so many experiments going on at the same time.''
   Independent American inventor Charles Francis Jenkins produced
the world's first working television and demonstrated it in
Washington, D.C., in 1925. A comedy skit was broadcast from New
Jersey to the Bell Telephone labs in New York City in April 1927.
Westinghouse scientist Vladimir Zworykin developed the first
electronic television system, which ultimately replaced the
mechanical scanners, in the 1920s.
   But the demonstration in January 1928 in Schenectady apparently
was the first broadcast to television sets installed in homes,
according to the reference book, ``Famous First Facts.''
   The GE station was known as W2XB when it got its first federal
license and started a regular program schedule in May 1928, with
farm and weather reports three afternoons a week. It was the
world's first regular television program schedule, according to
``Famous First Facts.''
   From there, WRGB boasts a series of ``firsts'' in television
history. It televised the first ``remote'' broadcast (outside the
studio), with an August 1928 live telecast of Gov. Alfred E. Smith
accepting the Democratic nomination for president at the state
Capitol in Albany.
   The following month, the station televised the first play, a
blood-and-guts drama called ``The Queen's Messenger,'' complete
with props and sound effects.
   At the time, there were still only four households equipped with
the 3-inch-screen TV sets.
   The first transatlantic telecast was made when the image of
Professor August Carolus of Leipzig, Germany, was transmitted from
Schenectady to Berlin in 1931.
   In 1939, WRGB and WNBC in New York City were linked by a series
of relay towers down through the Catskill Mountains and Hudson
Valley, thus forming the first television network. The visit of the
King and Queen of England to the New York World's Fair in 1939 was
beamed live to Schenectady.
   ``The World's Fair did more to publicize TV than anything
else,'' Walden said in an interview at WRGB's 40,000-square-foot
studio complex in suburban Niskayuna. ``GE had a huge exhibit.
Thousands of people went through and saw themselves on television
for the first time.''
   WRGB, which switched its network affiliation to CBS in 1981,
became the first NBC affiliate in 1939. It aired the first complete
opera on TV in 1943 with a performance of ``Hansel and Gretel.''
   Ernie Tetrault, anchorman of WRGB's evening news, became the
station's first full-time staff announcer in 1951. His 37 years
with WRGB make Tetrault the longest-tenured anchorman in the
country, says News Manager Gary Whittaker.
   ``There was little emphasis on news in the early days,'' says
Tetrault. ``It was pretty much rip-and-read _ we mainly depended on
newsreel services and the Associated Press.
   ``For example, one day back in the '50s there was a big fire at
the main GE plant, right near the studio,'' says Tetrault. ``Our
news manager looked out the window and said, `Hey, there's a fire
at GE! Get AP on the phone and see if we can get something on it.'''
   When WRGB's lone cameraman shot a story, it took hours to
process the film. ``He'd have to string it on sawhorses to dry,''
says Tetrault. ``It would take all afternoon to do what takes
minutes with modern video equipment.''
   Now, WRGB, which has a dominant audience share in an area with
four commercial stations and two public ones, has all the latest
newsgathering gadgetry, including trucks for live remotes, nine new
electronic news cameras, and sophisticated editing equipment.
   Freedom Newspapers, Inc., which bought the station for $57
million in 1986, has pumped millions of dollars into the station
and increased the staff to 125 from 100, says General Manager David
Lynch.
