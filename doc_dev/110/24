   Twenty years ago, Skip Ewing saw Glen
Campbell perform on television. Something clicked.
   At the time Ewing was about to start school. Today, he's 26 and
one of the youngest country music performers signed to a recording
contract with a major label.
   ``I was about 4 when I got my first guitar,'' Ewing recalled in
an interview. ``I can't remember a time when I didn't play.
   ``I know I sang the theme to `Rawhide' and I watched `The Glen
Campbell Goodtime Hour.' I wanted to play just like Glen.''
   In the 1990s, Ewing is one of country music's fresh faces, just
as Campbell was in the late '60s.
   The handsome, well-spoken singer-songwriter is laying the
foundation for a solid career doing something he genuinely enjoys.
   His single, ``It's You Again,'' reached the Top 10 of the
country music popularity charts in February. ``Burnin' a Hole in My
Heart'' and ``The Gospel According to Luke'' were Top 10 hits last
year.
   Ewing has released two albums, ``Coast of Colorado'' and ``The
Will to Love.'' The latter has many cuts with little more than a
finger-picked acoustic guitar.
   He was born in Redlands, Calif., but lived throughout the
country because his father spent 11 years moving from city to city
in the Navy. Ewing worked at the Opryland USA theme park in
Nashville for 2{ seasons as a singer-dancer in a live production
tracing the history of country music.
   He also made a living as a songwriter and has written album cuts
recorded by Kenny Rogers, Willie Nelson, George Strait, George
Jones, Conway Twitty, Ricky Van Shelton and others.
   Since launching his solo career, he has been the opening act at
country concerts with such headline performers as the Judds, Randy
Travis, Alabama and Reba McEntire.
   Ewing, who also plays the five-string banjo and mandolin,
understands that he's fortunate to have a recording contract at a
relatively youthful age. But he quickly adds that he worked
diligently for it.
   ``I was in town three years before it happened,'' he said. ``It
was a short time compared with some people, but I had been doing it
for a heck of a long time. I had been singing and writing songs and
traveling.
   ``I'm not a very patient person sometimes; I want things to
happen. That's one of the things I need to work on: accept things
as they are.
   ``I set awful big goals; I work hard at what I do,'' he said.
``I figured there are a lot of singers in town, a lot of
songwriters and a lot of guitar players, and if I can do all of
them well I have a chance.''
   His ballad-oriented music focuses on romance. In the album ``The
Will to Love,'' the song ``It's You Again'' is about the pain of
love. The cut ``Karen'' is about the disintegration of a
relationship. ``She's Makin' Plans'' is about devotion. ``Please
Don't Leave Me Now'' deals with family love.
   ``It seems like my voice is suited to ballads,'' Ewing said. ``I
like to sing emotional things. I feel like I'm sharing something
when I do that. I enjoy singing things that allow me to feel like
I'm saying something, that I'm expressing something. It's like
being an actor sometimes.''
   He has written all the songs he has recorded.
   ``Songwriting is very much a craft and an art. I don't just
settle for things. Sometimes it takes hours to find one line _ a
place where different emotions mix.
   ``I feel like I have a lot to offer. When I go and do a show,
it's not a job. It's something I love to do. The music I perform
and write is all a part of me. By sharing that with an audience, I
feel I'm sharing things important to me. I feel that what I share
with people is worthwhile and I'm not wasting somebody's time with
my music.''
   The song ``The Will to Love'' used an instrument rarely used in
country music: a cello. Ewing, who didn't want to use traditional
country instruments such as fiddles and steel guitars, said it
allowed him to be more intimate.
   On his next LP, he plans to use another instrument rarely heard
in country music _ a saxophone.
   ``I don't mind taking chances,'' Ewing said.
   Campbell, his old idol, surprised him recently after hearing
that Ewing was a longtime fan of his. ``He came by the studio
during my first album just to say `Hi!' That was a big deal to me
and still is.''
