<P>
A handsome, middle-aged couple are sitting in a meeting hall, pontificating 
enthusiastically about contras. 
</P>
<P>
But no mention is made of Nicaragua or the Sandinistas. These two are speaking 
of contras of a different kind -- contra dances that take place the third 
Saturday of every month at the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
"This is my first time. My husband dragged me here," said Irvine resident 
Marcella Lowe with a grin. Warren Lowe, 60, a Customs Service inspector, made 
his contra debut the previous month and sounded as if he was on his way to 
becoming a contra convert. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to dance the Virginia reel to this sort of music back in 
Massachusetts," he said, gesturing toward the stage, where a band was playing a 
furious fiddle tune. "It's easy to pick up on these dances after you do them a 
few times." 
</P>
<P>
She seemed eager to hit the dance floor: "This music has a different beat from 
square-dancing music. We used to call this 'stompy music' -- the stuff you like 
to pat your feet to." 
</P>
<P>
Contra dancing, according to Richard Nevell's book "A Time to Dance," is a 
distant cousin of Morris dancing, an ancient ceremonial activity performed by 
men in England to encourage fruitful crops. As the dance evolved, it became 
more of a social function involving both sexes. 
</P>
<P>
Early settlers of New England brought the dances with them to this continent. 
By the late 18th Century, the French, a dominant force in dance at the time, 
renamed this "country dancing" contredanse, which English-speakers later 
adapted to "contra." 
</P>
<P>
The term also refers to the position of dancing opposite a partner. Instead of 
dancers interacting in groups of eight, as is common in square dancing, contra 
dancers line people up in two long rows. 
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Russell is the main organizer of these Anaheim dances. Long before any 
happy-footed folk show up to test the floor, Russell stands in the middle of 
the small hall, checking the sound system for the Occasional String Band 
quintet, in which she plays guitar, bass and, sometimes, French accordion. The 
56-year-old Garden Grove resident cuts a casual figure in wheat-colored slacks, 
black blouse and Birkenstock sandals as she shouts directions over the music to 
adjust the level of various instruments and microphones. Once satisfied with 
the sonic levels, Russell took a break in a quiet back room and talked about 
exactly what makes these dances worth the effort it takes to set them up and 
keep them running. 
</P>
<P>
"I was born on a farm in North Dakota and was raised around old-time music. As 
a 5-year-old, I was taken to some of the last authentic country dances in the 
area," she explained, speaking softly now that she didn't have to shout over 
amplified music. 
</P>
<P>
"Those dances were held in school auditoriums, with benches all around the 
sides and lots of coats and overshoes and grandmas and little kids. A fiddler 
came down from Canada, usually." 
</P>
<P>
Russell's fascination with music began at a tender age. She got a ukulele when 
she was 6, a guitar for Christmas when she was 10 and picked up other 
instruments from there. Now, she is such a music aficionado that she also plays 
guitar in the Louisiana Cajun Trio and a zydeco band. 
</P>
<P>
She has been plucking tunes with Occasional String Band-mates Carty Wilson and 
Hugh Nestor since the late '70s. 
</P>
<P>
"We had been gathering to play music in living rooms forever, it seemed," 
Russell said. "Out of that group of people playing together, the idea of having 
dancing developed. My husband and I had a covered, sheltered patio in our yard 
in Garden Grove, and put on a dance there for five years, until 1987." 
</P>
<P>
That's when city officials put a halt to the informal gatherings because 
Russell did not have an entertainment permit. 
</P>
<P>
Once the band decided that the dancers and the musicians deserved "to build a 
good dance, as opposed to a fun thing that ultimately wouldn't go anywhere," 
Russell said, they moved the contra first to Huntington Beach, then in late 
1988 to its current location. A labor of love more than a moneymaking venture, 
this monthly contra draws 30 to 50 dancers per night -- just enough, at $4 per 
adult admission, to cover rental fees for the hall. 
</P>
<P>
(Seven monthly contra dances in the Los Angeles-Orange County area are listed 
in the California Dance Co-Operative bulletin, which promises "No partner or 
experience necessary. All dances taught and prompted.") 
</P>
<P>
The live music, Russell said, is a vital ingredient of contra dances. 
</P>
<P>
"This music has a way of reminding us of people we love," she said. "My 
grandfather and great uncles played various instruments at local dances in 
North Dakota and in a small-town band that was something straight out of 'The 
Music Man.' Maybe this music gives us those people and those times back, when 
people were more of a community, dependent upon each other in real ways. You'll 
find strangers talking to each other at this dance and that sense of 
community." 
</P>
<P>
Music that emanates from a live band instead of a record player also sets 
contra dancing apart from square-dancing, Russell added. 
</P>
<P>
"There's very little square-dancing that I know of, at least in Southern 
California, that's done to live music. I think square-dancers are more into 
developing precision moves and good-looking things out on the dance floor. 
Maybe there are people who get more pleasure out of precision. But this music 
is more loose and forgiving." 
</P>
<P>
By the time Russell rejoins the band on stage, most of the potluck supper 
dishes brought by dancers have been polished off and folks are out on the 
scuffed wooden floor, following the patient instructions of caller Wayne 
Battleson as he explains the steps of the first dance. With his long brown 
ponytail and cordless headset microphone, Battleson looks like he might be more 
at home fronting a heavy-metal band than explaining do-si-dos. 
</P>
<P>
But it's obvious that he has a way with contra clarification. Even the 
beginners out on the floor learn very quickly how to differentiate between 
"active" and "inactive," "top" and "bottom" couples. Before they know it, they 
have graduated to sashays and balances, stars and courtesy turns. 
</P>
<P>
Then the band strikes up, and it's time to put the newly acquired terminology 
into action. Joining the band on stage are a couple of musicians who are 
sitting in. That too, Russell said, is a part of the contra dance tradition. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who wants to can come up and play on stage with us, but whether or not 
they'll be on microphone is another matter," she said. "The group spirit is the 
pervasive idea." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there is quite a mix of ethnic backgrounds, ages and fashion styles 
out on the floor. One dancer who looks to be about 12 is swinging his partner 
with the best of them in high-top tennis shoes and a pink shirt stamped Off 
Limits. But the youngest participant is 15-month-old David Blair. He giggles 
with every bounce as his mother, Zona, balances him on one hip and gamely 
extends her free hand to various partners up and down the line. A few dancers 
zip through the steps with no-nonsense looks on their faces, but most looked 
relaxed and smile frequently, taking time to make funny faces at little David. 
</P>
<P>
Battleson's calls are easy to follow, but when someone loses the way, there are 
usually arms reaching out to help errant dancers back into proper position 
before they reel entirely out of control. The quick, rhythmic clasping of hands 
and synchronized negotiation of turns can be strangely thrilling -- perhaps a 
bit like trapeze work, with just a fraction of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth Shapin, 59, a lawyer from Orange, has been coming to the Anaheim dance 
since its early days. "I like the sociability of contra dancing -- the way you 
dance all up and down the lines," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Ted, a 62-year-old engineer, said the Shapins' daughter recently 
participated in a "dance friendship exchange" in the Soviet Union. "They 
brought their own band and caller and taught the Soviets how to contra," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In a sea of pastel summer clothes, Shannon Batts' black miniskirt and boots and 
Steve Jackson's skull-print pants and fedora make them stand out in the crowd 
of dancers. Yet they too are contra veterans -- and regard themselves as the 
resident jesters as well, always stirring up mischief even as they execute 
steps skillfully. Jackson frequently punctuated the beat of the banjo music 
with a tweet on a whistle, and he and Batts led all the dancers in shouts of 
"lemonade!" to rhyme with the caller's command of "promenade." 
</P>
<P>
"I got into dancing because I wanted to have a chance to play and use my body 
and have a release after sitting around and being intellectual all day," said 
Jackson, 30, a Census Bureau edit clerk. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular dance is different from all the other contras I know," said 
Batts, 26, a psychiatric aide and a graduate student in the counseling program 
at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"This dance is very community-oriented," she said. "We bring out food and 
flowers and children. The other dances aren't like that. (Those) are just three 
hours of hard-core dancing." 
</P>
<P>
During the band's break, a couple of the musicians strolled over to a reporter 
to offer a cup of lemonade and a quick tutorial about the "old-time" music they 
play at contras. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a good tune that allows you to follow the dance throughout," said Ira 
Gwin, 49, director of community development for the City of Commerce when he is 
not the main fiddle man in several bands. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be able to sense through the music what the next dance move should 
be," banjo player Jack Phillips elaborated. "We play a Southern Mountain 
Appalachian style of dance music, which is different from the New England 
style. They do a lot more jigs in six-eight time." 
</P>
<P>
Carty Wilson, a mandolin player from Long Beach, stressed that the music this 
band plays at contras is very different from bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the things we're trying to do here is to perpetuate the older style of 
music," he said. "Bluegrass is a flashy style primarily for performance. This 
style of music is pre-bluegrass." 
</P>
<P>
By 11:30 p.m., the lemonade jug was drained and all but the most die-hard 
dancers were tuckered out. Even the energetic children, who spent their contra 
time skipping rope and playing tag on the sidelines, were flagging. Some 
dancers helpfully dragged folding chairs into place for the youth theater group 
that would take over the hall the next day. Others made their way out the door 
slowly, picking up jelly jars full of dark brown honey that fiddle player Gwin 
had harvested from his bees. 
</P>
<P>
Caller Battleson, a land-surveyor in his non-dancing time, offered the 
evening's final opinion on why a quaint little activity like contra dancing is 
thriving in the shadow of the Matterhorn and other more glitzy entertainment 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
"It's vigorous, flirtatious, social and a way to have a fun time without going 
out to the bars," he said. "And the people are just tremendous. You meet the 
best people contra dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 Contra dancing takes place Saturday and every third Saturday of the month, 
from 7 to 11:30 p.m. at the Anaheim Cultural Arts Center, 931 N. Harbor Blvd., 
Anaheim. Admission: Adults $4, children free. Information: (714) 638-1466.
