   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Do people love their pets enough to pay for
their braces, a few root canals and crowns, or even just some
dental checkups? A growing number of veterinarians are deciding
that the answer is yes. Pet dentistry, though still in its infancy,
has become a hot topic in the field of animal health care.

   A woman came into Dr. John Saidla's offices
several years ago and said she just couldn't bear another look at
her toothless schnauzer's gummy grin.
   Was there anything the veterinarian could do?
   Most animal doctors would have said no, but not Saidla, a
pioneer in dental care for pets.
   ``We put in a bridge and it stayed in there for 2{ years until
he died,'' says Saidla, who has been poking around in animal mouths
for decades. ``We never had any trouble. She used to use a water
pick to clean it.''
   Dentistry has become a hot topic in the field of pet health
care, a $5 billion-a-year industry.
   And that begs a question for the '90s: Do people love their pets
enough to pay for their braces, a few root canals and crowns, or
even just some dental checkups?
   Saidla and a growing group of veterinarians at the top of the charts.
Rock has undergone a lot of
changes since then and Dion DiMucci, who was recently inducted into
the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame, became a solo singer years ago.
Today he thumbs his nose at those who scoff at ``geriatric
rockers'' and keeps on playing his music his way.

   Dion is turning 50, but he's ready to rock 'n'
roll till he's in a rocking chair.
   As a teen-ager in the Bronx, Dion DiMucci put together a group
of singers and named it for the neighborhood's Belmont Avenue. Dion
and the Belmonts became the most popular vocal group of rock 'n'
roll's doo-wop era.
   At 15, he made his first professional appearance, on a Paul
Whiteman show, and he first saw, walking down the street, the
redhead who's still his wife and the mother of his three daughters.
   Five years later, Dion and the Belmonts had their first Top 10
record, ``A Teenager in Love.''
   This year, Dion, who wears a jaunty Bronx taxi driver's cap even
at home in Boca Raton, Fla., has a new rock 'n' roll album, ``Yo
Frankie,'' which is getting good reviews. He wrote most of the
songs.
   Dion, who turns 50 on July 18, was inducted into the Rock 'n'
Roll Hall of Fame in January.
   Some of his generation became tuxedoed nightclub singers.
   ``I'm a die-hard,'' Dion says. ``I've always been a rock 'n'
roll enthusiast. In case I lose my job as a rock 'n' roll singer,
I'll drive a cab. I've got my cabbie cap. But I've been fortunate.
I always paid the rent. I've never done another job. Never.''
   Dion isn't buying any ``don't trust anybody over 30'' stuff or
pronouncements by Mick Jagger and Peter Townshend of the Who about
not wanting to be geriatric rockers.
   ``When I started there was no rock 'n' roll, no expectations, no
rules,'' Dion says. ``Some people got the idea that rock 'n' roll
was just for the young. Today we know that's not so. You could be
an old fogey at 19. You can be kicking up your heels at 63. It's an
attitude.
   ``Rock at its best lifts your spirit, keeps you aware, makes you
feel and think, keeps you young.
   ``If you start with the anger and a sound to get the girls, and
keep on, you find out it's really an artistic expression. You can
share your thoughts. This is powerful.''
   Rock 'n' roll may have moved through doo-wop, British invasions
and disco to post-punk, but for Dion it hasn't changed much.
   ``The only thing that has changed is the equipment,'' he says.
``Basically, you've got a backbeat, electric guitars and it's dance
music.
   ``This new album is an '80s album. But it has elements of my
music. It's black music filtered through an Italian neighborhood.
You come out with an attitude.
   ``I always used a bunch of guys to imitate a horn section,
because I couldn't afford a horn section. I became kind of
identified with that sound _ `Ruby Baby,' `Runaround Sue.' I use it
all through this album.
   ``When I was growing up we used to bang on cardboard boxes and I
had a guitar and a bunch of guys would sing. You put a drum to that
and you go. With all the technology today it comes out with more
power and clarity.''
   After doo-wop faded and Dion conquered a drug problem, he became
a folk singer. He had a hit with ``Abraham, Martin and John.''
   ``I wasn't striking lightning in the sky,'' he says. ``That song
gave me a chance to sit in coffeehouses which were flourishing
around the country and play acoustic guitar and express myself.
   ``Those times were wonderful for me. For the first time it
became a two-way street, the audience and me. When I started out,
we used to run out at the Brooklyn Fox and do two songs. Then Fats
Domino would do two songs. Jerry Lee Lewis would do two.
   ``In 1980 I got into gospel music. It was a way to express what
was inside me. I made five gospel albums. I don't call it religious
music. I don't look at myself as religious.''
   Dion, a solo singer since 1960, had a reunion concert with the
Belmonts in 1972 but has stayed off rock revival tours. ``I feel
like I would dry up if I did that.
   ``But I love doing the old songs. Those songs become more
valuable to me every year. I love to see the joy `The Wanderer' and
`Runaround Sue' bring to people. When Arista Records wanted me to
do an album, I said I'd do it if I can do a rock 'n' roll album in
the tradition of those two songs, meaning get into some strong
characters.''
   Dion says he got a lot of help on his new album. Paul Simon
sings on ``Written on the Subway Wall'' and he's in the video. ``We
did it on a subway platform in the middle of the night,'' Dion
says. ``We had about 15 cops, 20 Guardian Angels. It was great. We
had dinner served down there.
   ``I had Paul sing one of my favorite doo-wop songs, `Little
Star,' done by the Elegants, in the middle of `Subway Wall.'
   ``One of my friends had a bunch of 8mm film of us from the old
days. It's woven through the whole video. The end shows me in my
first car, which I bought for $75.''
   Personally, Dion says, ``I'm kind of an oddball. I've got the
same wife I started off with. We grew up together. We love each
other. The real thing that kept us going is that we accepted each
other at our worst. We walked through the valley. I was with her at
her lowest and she was with me at my lowest.
   ``We've got three great daughters. They're a joy. I'm blessed.''
   Dion is looking forward to his 50th birthday party.
   ``It's going to be a bash,'' he says. ``There'll be a lot of
friends with instruments. I probably will get into the mood to
play.''
