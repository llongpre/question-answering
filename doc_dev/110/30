The search continues in country music. 
</P>
<P>
From the late '40s through mid-'70s, the country world produced so many great 
singers and records that it was easy for outsiders to underestimate the degree 
of artistry required. 
</P>
<P>
All you needed was a singer with character and conviction, instrumental backing 
that accented rather than diluted the emotion and a memorable song. The latter, 
preferably, included at least one easily quotable line. 
</P>
<P>
And there seemed no end of a supply of great artists: from Hank Williams and 
Lefty Frizzell to Johnny Cash and Willie Nelson, and from Kitty Wells and Patsy 
Cline to Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris. 
</P>
<P>
But the great artists and great records have now become the exception in 
country music. Only two mainstream Nashville figures have emerged in the last 
dozen or so years to even approach the consistency or vision of the singers 
cited above -- John Anderson and Randy Travis -- and both seemed more echoes of 
the earlier stars than breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Two other, more recent arrivals, k.d. lang and Lyle Lovett, have shown 
exceptional promise, but both are mavericks who haven't been fully accepted in 
Nashville as part of the official country family. 
</P>
<P>
This lingering drought in country music is why so much attention in Nashville 
is focused these days on newcomers. Here's a look at some of the lastest 
country contenders. None joins the honor roll on the basis of these new albums, 
but there are some twinkles of promise. The albums are rated on a five-star 
scale, from one (poor) to five (a classic). 
</P>
<P>
*** Jann Browne's "Tell Me Why" (Curb) -- One reason the music of this veteran 
of Southern California honky-tonks seems so reminiscent of Emmylou Harris is 
that Steve Fishell, who used to play steel guitar in Harris' band, produced it 
and other musicians who have been associated with Harris play on the album. It 
also doesn't hurt that Harris sings harmony on one track. 
</P>
<P>
However, the main reason Browne makes you think of country music's most 
enchanting female singer is that Browne sings with a similar purity and sense 
of integrity as Harris. She, too, can can make a new song (her own "Mexican 
Wind," a soulful tale of romantic loss) feel like a classic or inject new life 
into an old favorite (Harlan Howard-Fuzzy Owen's "The One You Slip Around 
With"). Strong potential. 
</P>
<P>
*** Mark Collie's "Hardin County Line" (MCA) -- Collie would have been at home 
in country in the '50s, when rockabilly and honky-tonk shuffle were the rage. 
He sings both styles with a biting authenticity and is backed by a first-rate 
band that includes guitarist James Burton, who was Elvis Presley's guitarist 
for years. He also writes lots of quotable lines. 
</P>
<P>
Collie is a little too intent on touching all the thematic country bases 
(ramblin' fever, the old days), but most of his songs about relationships have 
a wry, bittersweet edge. In the opening track, Collie tells about stumbling 
home after working the all-night shift to find a note attached to the freezer: 
"The good news is she loves me / The bad news is she's gone." Elsewhere, he 
offers, "Now where there's smoke, you'll find my old flame." 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 Alan Jackson's "Here in the Real World" (Arista) -- Jackson aims high. 
He's quoted on the inside sleeve of the album package as saying, "You know that 
country song, 'Who's Gonna Fill Them Shoes?' I don't know whether I can fill 
'em, but I'd sure like to try 'em on." In this debut collection, Jackson is off 
to a fast start commercially. The album has been in the country Top 10 since 
April 21. 
</P>
<P>
If he's truly hoping to fill the shoes of such country greats as George Jones, 
however, he's got a long way to go. The artist he most resembles (in cowboy-hat 
image and musical style) is contemporary Dwight Yoakam. 
</P>
<P>
Like the latter, Jackson is good at approximating emotion, but he doesn't show 
much original vision or musical soul. Selections such as "Blue Blooded Woman" 
have quotable lines, but they're mostly Nashville hokum. Sample: "She loves a 
violin, I love a fiddle / We go separate ways but we meet in the middle / Don't 
see eye to eye, but we're hand in hand / A blue-blooded woman and a red-neck 
man." 
</P>
<P>
* 1/2 Travis Tritt's "Country Club" (Warner Bros.) -- Joining Alan Jackson in 
the country Top 10 these days, Tritt is equally suspect. He deals in a 
harder-edged, semi-rock brand of country, suggesting his model is more Hank 
Williams Jr. than George Jones. There's a sense of drama in his singing and in 
the arrangements, but the themes -- as telegraphed in such song titles as "Son 
of the New South" and "The Road Home" -- have been part of the accepted country 
songbook for years. The singing is generally undistinguished, the arrangements 
are routine and the album's most quotable line comes from a song ("Country 
Club") that Tritt didn't write. 
</P>
<P>
** 1/2 Kelly Willis' "Well Traveled Love" (MCA) -- This 21-year-old, 
Austin-based singer exudes such personality and spirit that she reminds you of 
the early promise of Lone Justice's Maria McKee, a point that wasn't lost on 
Carlyne Majer, who worked with Lone Justice and now manages Willis. 
</P>
<P>
Willis balances feelings of spunky optimism and lesson-learned caution so well 
in the opening track that you think the album is going to soar. While her voice 
continues to dazzle, the album is limited by often pedestrian instrumental 
backing and by too few top-notch songs. The next album may be the real test.
