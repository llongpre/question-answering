<TEXT>     It was the summer of 1965, and Grisman was a young, urban "bluegrass
maniac" from New Jersey, visiting friends in Palo Alto. While in the Bay Area,
he looked up a banjo-playing acquaintance whom he had met the year before at a
country music park in Westborough, Pa., and who had since formed a rock band.;
   Grisman took an instant shine to the group's jug-band style. "They were
playing parties at people's swimming pools, doing (Bob) Dylan and folk
tunes.";    Returning East, he shared his enthusiasm with a writer for "Sing
Out!" magazine, who mentioned the band, called the Warlocks, in his column.;  
 Weeks later, at the San Jose Acid Test, Jerry Garcia and his Warlocks tried
on a new name: the Grateful Dead.;    "I got them their first national press,"
Grisman brags. "I've been telling that story a lot lately.";    This bout of
boastful reminiscing has been kindled, no doubt, by Grisman's latest project:
"Garcia/Grisman," an acoustic tour de force that pairs the top Dawg's
crystal-pure mandolin sound with Captain Trip's remarkably clean, complex
guitar work.;    Grisman and Garcia's professional collaborations have been
scattered but satisfying, dating back to the early '70s, when Grisman appeared
on the Dead's landmark "American Beauty" album (1970), playing mandolin on
"Ripple" and "Friend of the Devil." A couple of years later, Garcia dusted off
his banjo to collaborate with Grisman on "Old and In the Way" (1973), a loose
but legendary bluegrass band that included Vassar Clements on fiddle,
guitarist/songwriter Peter Rowan and bassist John Kahn.;    But Grisman was
coming into his own with "Dawg" music, a distillation of jazz, bluegrass,
folk, classical and ethnic stylings for acoustic strings; Garcia had his
obligations with the Dead; and Rowan was holding a steadfast bluegrass line.
Nine months later, "Old and in the Way" collapsed under its own musical
weight.;    Grisman went on to form the Great American Music Band in 1974, and
Garcia would occasionally sit in on banjo. But their paths rarely crossed
after that.;    Garcia continued to dabble in acoustic music, even forming the
Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band in 1987. But it was his electric guitar work with
the Dead that devoured most of his time and eventually defined his style.;   
In the meantime, with his ever-keen eye for raw talent, Grisman assembled the
David Grisman Quintet, a tight group of premier young musicians that included
at one time or another such Dawg disciples as Mike Marshall, Darol Anger, Tony
Rice and Mark O'Connor.;    Reunion was inevitable;  But considering their
shared love for traditional and folk music, a Grisman- Garcia reunion proved
inevitable. Last year, they were drawn together one more time.;    "Jerry had
mentioned wanting to put out some old tapes and I said, 'Gee, why don't we do
something new?' One day he just came over with his guitar. I said, 'When do
you want to start?' He said 'Now.' Every time we got together, we recorded."; 
  They played two shows at San Francisco's Warfield Theater in February, but
other than that, rehearsal for the album was negligible. "The stuff really
came together after those gigs. I like to go out there and play it before I
record. But I think you can take that too far, as well. There's something
about a fresh idea.";    In keeping with that approach, "Garcia/Grisman" is a
studio album, but each track was recorded without benefit of overdubbing.
Vocals (by Garcia) and instrumentals (including Jim Kerwin on bass and Joe
Craven on fiddle/ percussion) were put down as they played them, in the
basement studio of Grisman's Mill Valley home.;    It's no secret the two have
hugely divergent performing styles. Any of Grisman's Deputy Dawgs will allow
as to what a tough taskmaster he is. How did that mesh with Garcia's
considerably more, uh, relaxed attitude?;    "We both had a good effect on
each other," Grisman says. "A lot of his looseness rubbed off on me, a lot of
my discipline rubbed off on him. I like to lock the doors so people can't get
out till we're done. He likes to take a break after each take. There's a value
in each attitude.";    Garcia's best acoustic work;  Grisman has squeezed from
Garcia some of his best acoustic work to date, especially on B.B. King's "The
Thrill is Gone," Grisman's "Arabia" and the song they co-wrote, "Grateful
Dawg." But what about his singing, best described as idiosyncratic?;    "I
think he has a lot of soul, a lot of character in his singing," Grisman says.
"I really dig it. Some people don't, but a lot obviously do. My experience
with playing with singers hasn't been that great. But Jerry's sort of like a
singer who's more like a musician." High praise, coming from an acoustic
purist.;    Evidently both parties are pleased with the result: Already there
are plans for another album.;    "Jerry wants to get back into it," Grisman
says. "He's been practicing his banjo.";    Return to bluegrass?;  Does that
spell a return to their bluegrass roots?;    "I love traditional bluegrass.
But there's really no one to play with out here. Nothing against the West
Coast scene, but the musicians out here don't have the authentic vibe. I'm
spoiled on bluegrass, because I've played with the best. It's like if you like
Italian food and you've been to Italy, you don't want to get an Italian
chicken sandwich at Burger King.";    Grisman found that authentic vibe in a
musician who died more than 20 years ago, a man he calls the Bill Monroe of
Brazil. His next recording, due out in October, is a compilation culled from
the recordings of mandolin player Jacob do Bandolim, whom Grisman calls the
father of choro music.;    If it sounds a bit arcane for the mass market,
Grisman hardly seems concerned. After all, with a built-in market of Deadheads
for "Garcia/ Grisman," his new label, Acoustic Disc, is off on a healthy
footing.;    "There's a market for the music I'm into, so I might as well do
it myself. I only want to do the things that are really important.";  David
