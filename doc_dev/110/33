 You know you've made The Big Time when you no longer need a last name. Who can 
forget Cleopatra, Elvis, Madonna, Bogie, Zsa Zsa, The Duke, God, Sabu, Goofy? 
Know what I mean? Electric folk singer Michael on Fire is another example of a 
guy with no surname. All he needs now is half of Milli Vanilli's money. 
</P>
<P>
Michael On Fire, which is the singer's legal name, lives in the San Fernando 
Valley by way of Detroit and loves the Lakers, except when they play the 
Pistons. He says that a Sioux Indian medicine man gave him his name. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not performing, MOF is writing. And writing. And writing. He has 
between 1,200 and a zillion songs -- this guy could play longer than the 
Grateful Dead. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people water their plants every day; I write. Not every song is a gem, 
but there's usually a line or two worth saving for another song -- I've got 
quite a catalogue. The more you do something, the better you get at it. I'm a 
lifer. This is what I do. I feel like I've got five or six good albums in me 
right now. When I play, each set is longer than an album." 
</P>
<P>
Michael On Fire has this booming, sort of raspy voice that's as big as all 
outdoors -- the sort of voice everyone on MTV wishes were his. He's got this 
wild mane of hair, without mousse, and he doesn't look like one of those 
cheerleaders from high school. He's commercial-sounding and slicker than the 
trail of a 50-foot slug, not plastic and phony but convincing and real. Better 
yet, he never asks the obvious, "How's it goin', Ven-ch-ura?" 
</P>
<P>
And the singer is so relentlessly friendly and upbeat that he could sell a 
raincoat to a cactus. When he's not on stage, MOF chats with people in the 
audience. He must be a direct descendant of Mr. Rogers and Captain Kangaroo. 
</P>
<P>
MOF writes these reflective ballads that are at once sad and funny about the 
Big Issues -- love, the homeless, the environment, offshore drilling, ERA, 
American Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Usually accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, MOF has this tight backup band 
that just got tighter -- like Roseanne Barr in a wet suit . . . in Bakersfield 
. . . in August. Stevie Ray Davis recently joined MOF. He's a guitarist who's 
in the Texas Music Hall of Fame where he has joined the likes of Jimmy Vaughan 
and Stevie Ray Vaughan. MOF's folk rock songs now have a definite rockin' blues 
edge. Robbie Drum is the sax player and Tobias is the one-named percussionist. 
</P>
<P>
When he's not writing, Michael On Fire is Michael on tour. He's played in every 
state except Alaska and Hawaii and has opened for acts such as Stephen Stills, 
Peter Tosh, Jimmy Cliff, Bob Seger, Jean Luc Ponty and the Art Ensemble of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"My strangest gig was my first-ever gig. It was in east Detroit, and I walked 
into this place with my guitar and they told me I had to sing from on top of 
the bar. So I'm up there doing 'Mr. Tambourine Man' when all of a sudden on 
each side of me was a bona fide stripper. Man, it got real hard to remember the 
lyrics." 
</P>
<P>
"I average about five gigs per week -- I'm doing 24 shows in April. But I don't 
do those industry hangout gigs. I'm not into competition and that's not how I 
care to participate. Most places I play don't have cover charges, except in 
January when I played Aspen and it cost forty bucks to get in and a beer cost 
seven bucks. Industry people tell me I'm overexposing myself, but hey, this is 
my job . . ." 
</P>
<P>
It must be working too. MOF has a mailing list of more than 2,500 plus a tape, 
"Pre-Dawn Chronicles." The tape is available at his gigs and contains some of 
his best work -- "Lucifer's Returned To Heaven," "Oh Picasso" and "Ride On Into 
Midnight." The tape is as popular as a bulletproof building in Beirut -- 3,000 
units sold. A new tape is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
MOF's influences are diverse. He cites Dion, Miles Davis, Jimi Hendrix, Lou 
Reed, Bob Dylan, Albert King, Fats Domino and Fleetwood Mac. About the only 
cover he ever does is an old Fleetwood Mac song -- Peter Green's "Woman's Got 
The Blues" -- from Fleetwood's blues guitar band days before Stevie Nicks and 
Christine McVie joined the group. 
</P>

Ventura every Monday in April and at the Hungry Hunter in Thousand Oaks every
