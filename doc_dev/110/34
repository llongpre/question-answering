   The King of the World. The Master of Disaster.
The Big Man. After more than 20 years in rock 'n' roll and almost
as many nicknames, Clarence Clemons prefers the simple tag, Mr. C.
   ``All those names, it's a heavy cross to bear,'' said Clemons,
the mightiest supporting star of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band.
``I think about all that stuff, but `Mr. C' has evolved and he's
the guy who combines all these things.''
   Size, power and all-night parties are part of Mr. C. Personality
counts, too. As Clemons says, it takes someone special to play the
saxophone.
   ``You got to have an urban attitude, be a streetwise person,''
he said. ``I don't know whether the saxophone made me this kind of
person or if I was just born to play a saxophone. It's an extension
of yourself.
   ``Nobody played instruments in my family. My father got that bug
and said he wants his son to play saxophone. I wanted an electric
train for Christmas, but he got me a saxophone. I flipped out.''
   Clemons prides himself on being a survivor, staying around even
when music involved far more than the simple joy of playing the
sax. On tour now with Ringo Starr and a band that includes Joe
Walsh, Levon Helm and Rick Danko, Clemons is getting those old
feelings back.
   ``Every night when Levon Helm breaks into `The Weight,' I catch
myself,'' Clemons said of the Band's drummer. ``When Rick Danko
goes into his bass, I have flashbacks to when I was young and wild
and didn't understand a thing.
   ``You need to go back a little bit and remember how it was and
how screwed up it got. It was a wonderful time. This whole tour is
bringing back this stuff.''
   Clemons also reaches back on his third solo album, ``A Night
With Mr. C,'' which recalls a few other nicknames _ such as King,
as in King Curtis, whose sweet saxophone was featured on hits by
the Coasters, Sam Cooke, Aretha Franklin and many others; Clemons
covers Cooke's party classic ``Twistin' the Night Away.''
   ``King Curtis is my mentor,'' Clemons said. ``I try to pattern
myself after his style. He made a live record that's one of my
favorites. `Memphis Soul Stew' and `Soul Serenade' are two songs
that made me understand the kind of music I liked.''
   Junior Walker, Motown's hottest sax player of the '60s, is
acknowledged with Clemons' version of ``Shotgun.'' Clemons also
sings ``Quarter to Three,'' a hit for Gary ``U.S.'' Bonds, and does
a duet with pop star Kim Carnes on his own ``Dance, Dance, Dance.''
   ``Singing's one of the hardest things,'' Clemons said. ``It was
terrible, the first few times.
   ``I was so depressed I went into the house and didn't come out
for six months. That still looms in the back of my mind. I sang in
the church choir and was a great singer. I felt comfortable there.''
   On stage, Springsteen loves to remember the time he and E Street
guitarist Steve Van Zandt were on the boardwalk outside a New
Jersey club at four in the morning. Through wind and pouring rain,
a large man appeared, dressed in white, carrying a saxophone.
   That, Clemons agrees, is how he and ``The Boss'' first met, back
in the early '70s _ the short, skinny guitarist and his towering
sideman. Like Springsteen, Clemons has some stories to tell. There
was the time the E Street Band appeared on the same bill as rock
'n' roll pioneers Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis.
   ``It was at the University of Maryland and we were Chuck Berry's
band,'' Clemons recalled. ``Ten minutes before the show, no Chuck
Berry. Five minutes later he walks in with his guitar, complains
about something, and sends it back. He comes back and we walk on
stage.
   ``The bass player (Garry Tallent) walks over to him and says,
`Hey, Chuck what are we going to play?' Chuck stops and says, `I
think we're going to play some Chuck Berry music.' We played the
whole set with no rehearsal, no nothing. He never told you the next
song.''
   The rest quickly became history. By 1975, critic Jon Landau had
dubbed Springsteen the ``future of rock 'n' roll,'' leading to
simultaneous covers on Time and Newsweek. ``Born to Run,''
featuring Clemons' blistering solo, was an instant rock anthem,
even gathering support as the official song of Springsteen's native
New Jersey.
   But business soon set in. Legal hassles delayed Springsteen's
``Darkness on the Edge of Town'' album. Harsh words were exchanged
all around. The simple joy of ``Rosalita'' and ``Thunder Road'' was
gone.
   ``That was the beginning of it, that was a sign,'' Clemons said.
``The handwriting was on the wall for a lot of people, not just
Springsteen. You look at the record companies and see the turnover
in personnel and wonder what is going on.''
   So Clemons chooses to look the other way, concentrating on his
music and getting by as best he can.
   ``I tell people to get out of the business, forget about it. If
you're not really, really special, forget about it. It's glamorous
and beautiful and at the same time, it ain't. You got to have faith
and you got to have a lot of luck.''
