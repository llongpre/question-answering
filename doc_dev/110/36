<LEADPARA>  THE instruments may have been subdued -- but the sound definitely wasn't.;  
For two hours the Subdudes kept the audience at the Great American Music Hall
on its feet Sunday night with their Cajun-flavored rock 'n' roll. But the
amazing thing was that they did it with the most unlikely instruments: an
accordion, an acoustic guitar, an electric bass and a tambourine.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That's right: A tambourine.;   Unlikely highlight; There were a lot of
highlights during this excellent show, but for a Subdudes first-timer, that
tambourine may be the thing most talked about. Steve Amedee played it like a
rock 'n' roll drum set. He hit it with sticks and got a full sound out of it
that -- and I'm not exaggerating here -- rivaled drummers in recent
performances by Guns N' Roses and AC/DC.;   During his solo on "Light in Your
Eyes," I had to walk up to the front of the stage to make sure he hadn't
somehow hidden a drum set under his chair. I didn't think you could get that
many sounds out of a tambourine. He did.;   The rest of the 'Dudes had their
tricks, too. With impeccable rhythms, soaring harmonies and a treasure chest
of original songs, guitarist Tommy Malone, bassist Johnny Ray Allen and John
Magnie on the accordion and keyboards played music that made you have to
dance. You couldn't sit still, even during the ballads, because of their hot
Cajun spice.;   The 18-song set drew evenly from their first two albums, both
of which feature songwriting that's so strong, you feel like you've heard
every song before. I kept thinking the show's opener, "One Time," or "Any
Cure" or "Push and Shove" must have been bayou classics passed down through
the ages.;   But they are all originals and all refined over seven years of
playing in clubs.;   They did three songs by other people: Al Green's "Tired
of Being Alone" and Earl King's "Nighttime" and "Big Chief." They kicked out
the jams on a long version of "Chief," adding some psychedelic keyboards to
the accordion and rock 'n' roll kazoo.;   On songs off their second, more
electric album, "Lucky," Malone played a lead guitar mounted on a stand, while
his acoustic hung around his neck. Those songs, including "I Can't Wait" and
"Another Heartbreak Now," came off better in concert than on record. The songs
stretched out into soulful jams; the music had more of a rhythm-and-blues
flavor than the acoustic numbers.;   I wouldn't want to see the Subdudes go
all electric, but they showed they could produce entirely different moods and
compete with more traditional rock bands. On "Straight Shot," they sounded
like the Band. At one point during "It's So Hard," they sounded like the old
Doobie Brothers.;   Still, what they did with acoustic instruments was what
made the night. With all of them huddled around Amedee's tambourine chair,
they got a kind of electricity and energy from a simple array of instruments
that I haven't heard since rock 'n' rollers began plugging into giant Marshall
amps.;   Inexplicably obscure; The really amazing thing is that the 'Dudes are
still playing clubs, drawing only about 200 people on a Sunday night. The only
comparable tour I can think of was in 1979, when an unknown trio called the
Police did a late-winter club tour and played their white reggae to a lot of
sparse houses, some sparser than usual because of blizzards.;   Even though
only about 100 people saw them in Denver, over the years thousands of people
claimed to have seen that show.;   If there is any rock 'n' roll justice,
someday people will be saying the same thing about the Subdudes in San
Francisco.  </TEXT>
