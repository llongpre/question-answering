<TEXT>     There's Ranger Doug, the square-jawed, straight-shootin' Idol of American
Youth; Too Slim, "the man of many hats and a dozen friends"; and Woody Paul,
"the man with an 8-gallon head in a 10-gallon hat.";   They're a tumbleweed
trio who mix campfire camp with some of the sweetest cowboy harmonies either
side of the Brazos River.;   Now, more than a dozen years and 2,400 shows
after hittin' the trail, they're riding high in the saddle with "Riders Radio
Theater," a half-hour show carried on nearly 200 stations; a new album on a
new (and bigger) label; and a kids' show making its debut Saturday on CBS
(Chs. 5, 46, 7 a.m.).;   So long state fairs, helloooo Hollywood.;   Lots of
learnin'; Behind the prairie parodies and muley melodies are three
over-educated cowpokes with a genuine fondness for the Old West. (Too Slim has
a bachelor's degree in wildlife management, Ranger Doug a master's in English
from Vanderbilt and Woody Paul -- hold on to your Resistol -- a doctorate in
nuclear physics from MIT.);   Besides superfluous sheepskin, they share a love
of the music immortalized by the stars of '30s and '40s "B" Westerns -- Tex
Ritter, Gene Autry, the Sons of the Pioneers and, of course, the Father of the
Sons, Roy Rogers.;   Back at the Triple X Ranch, Too Slim, "the little man
with the big instrument," plays bunkhouse bass. He sings lead tenor and does a
mean Gabby Hayes geezer. Ranger Doug, who plays guitar, has a honey-throated
baritone and a No. 6 yodel that could stop a jackrabbit at 20 paces. Tenor
Woody Paul, King of the Cowboy Fiddlers, has the fastest lasso in the West.;  
Together, they can croon the socks off a Salina schoolmarm with their
arrangements of "Cool Water," "Tumbling Tumbleweeds" and "Happy Trails." Their
original numbers evoke wide-open spaces: "Pretty Prairie Princess," "West
Texas Cowboy," "The Salting of the Slug.";   But what's that you say? Cowboy
music is nothing more than another Hollywood merchandising gimmick? A
sterilized, ethnocentric portrayal of Manifest Destiny?;   C'mon, get a life,
little dogie.;   "Cowboys have captured our romantic fantasies in the way that
lumberjacks and sheep shearers never did," says Ranger Doug, author of several
books on country music and Country Music Foundation historian. "There have
been cowboy songs and poems for well over a hundred years.";   The Riders
don't just paint pretty pictures with their songs.;   There are the lessons in
frontier history, such as how the yodel was born (hint: it involves an abrupt
encounter with a saddle horn). And helpful trail tips.;   Riders cater to the
contemporary cowpuncher, as well. Standing in the stirrups got you all
stressed out? Try "Bio Feedbag," the antidote to "bronco burnout.";   All this
and more, brought to you in part by Deadwood Darlene's Prairie Lubricants,
whose products include Udder Butter on a Rope.;   Yes, fame and big-name
sponsors may finally have found Riders in the Sky. But how did they find each
other?;   It was 1977, and "all three of us were living in Nashville," says
Ranger Doug. "There were a million bands and four-chord songs and outlaws and
the big electric bass and drums and broken hearts and broken marriages and
feeling sorry for yourself and gettin' drunk. Not that there's anything wrong
with that, you understand.";   But?;   "But cowboy music was such a delightful
alternative to all that.";   Too Slim and Ranger Doug had been playing local
club gigs together. But Riders came down the chute, Ranger Doug says, "when
Woody came along and said, 'You boys really need me,' in his typical modest
way.";   Like an armadillo needs an armpit?;   "Well, musically, he may have
been correct," allows Ranger Doug.;   Another thing they had going for them
was a wide-open niche: Singing cowboys had pretty much vamoosed by the 1950s.;
  Spurred on by a small stock of original trail tunes, quick-witted wrangler
repartee and some of the coolest cowboy outfits ever whipstitched together,
Riders in the Sky answered the call of the wild.;   Douglas Green became
Ranger Doug, defender of women, protector of children and friend to small
animals from the Great Plains to the Grand Canyon; Fred LaBour filled the
boots of Too Slim, varmint dancer and cagey cayuse who almost always needs
reining in; and Paul Woodrow Chrisman is Woody Paul, the childlike innocent
you reckon' got one mule kick in the head too many.;   It's paid off. What
could be more reward than a stall in the Grand Ol' Opry (awarded almost a
decade ago), the 1985 Independent Label Children's Album of the Year (for
"Saddle Pals"), or last year's outstanding achievement award from the Cowboy
Hall of Fame (for Ranger Doug's original tune, "The Line Rider")?;   Well,
maybe the legion of buckaroos and buckarettes who follow the Riders' every
misadventure. Or the buckle bunnies from Cheyenne to Chisholm, eternally
hopeful for just one chance to rope and tie the knot with Ranger Doug.;   But
before setting up home on the range, the Riders have some important business
to tend to.;   They're still taping their new TV show, "Riders in the Sky," a
Wild West version of "Pee-wee's Playhouse" featuring puppets, cartoons,
real-live Saddle Pals and musical performances.;   There's talk of other TV
ventures, even movies.;   Get out of Hollywood; But for the moment, "it's all
just talk," says Ranger Doug. "This is Hollywood, and there's a lot of hot
air. This town probably floats 20 feet above sea level on hot air.";   So when
they wrap up the show for the season, it's back on the road, this time with
material from their new children's album, "Harmony Ranch" (Columbia).;   Sure,
they could hang around the ranch and wait for stardom to come knocking. But
Riders in the Sky hold true to their credo.;   "That would be the easy way.
But it wouldn't be the cowboy way."  </TEXT>
