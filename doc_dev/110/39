IS THERE no such word as 'Pacificism'? Maybe we should invent it, to
describe the hold the South Seas have on our imaginations. 'Orientalism,'
after all, is the way we construct a myth of the east. But the Pacific
islands play as big a part in our dreams of paradise. Just think of Gauguin,
Robert Louis Stevenson, grass skirts, blue lagoons. We need a word for all
this Pacific dreaming.
Tahiti is probably the place most people think of as an island nirvana
(except Americans, who think of Hawaii). Moorea and Bora Bora fit every
requirement: cloud-capped peaks, steep green slopes tumbling to golden
sands, coral reefs with white waves outside and calm pale blue water within.
The natives are friendly francophones - this is French Polynesia, baguettes
and yellow headlights. They beguiled poor Captain Bligh's men into mutinying
so that The Bounty could stay a while longer. Their happy promiscuity had
long been suppressed by missionaries by the time Gauguin was drawn there,
which is probably just as well, otherwise Papeete would be the Bangkok of
the South Pacific. But while women no longer swim out naked to greet sailing
ships, new arrivals at the airport will be welcomed with leis and ukulele
music.
Sometimes it is hard to look on all this natural beauty without wondering
whether tourists do it any good, and hearing in your mind's ear Big Yellow
Taxi, Joni Mitchell's lament for Hawaii: 'You don't know what you've got
till it's gone, They paved paradise and put up a parking lot.'
A common feature of the beach hotels, for instance, is bungalows built
ostentatiously over shallow water and containing glass coffee tables through
which you can watch and even feed vivid tropical fish from the comfort of
your living room. At one such hotel we saw sand being pumped in from the
next bay to improve the beach. Ecologically sound, we were assured; but it
does not seem right.
By way of an awful ecological warning, there are the Bali Hyatt Ruins on
Bora Bora, half-built on a hill when the rains washed the land away and the
money ran out. The Tahitians know their Joni Mitchell, and promise that
their island will not go the way of Hawaii. Bora Bora will not go the way of
Tahiti. Huahine will not go the way of Bora Bora. I hope they are right. And
Hyatt (which denies any connection with the ruins) merits some sort of
sensitivity prize for its Regency Hotel, which clings so modestly to a
hillside outside Papeete you can hardly see it.
FOR an equally Pacific and much less touristy experience, fly a few hundred
miles west to the Cook Islands. In this easy-going backwater people speak
English, drive on the left and wave to strangers; and the towns look like
rural New Zealand. The best hotel in the islands, the Rarotongan Resort, is
nobody's idea of luxury, but it has beaches and island nights where the
vigorous local music and dancing are on display.
And again, you are in blue lagoon country. A day trip to Aitutaki, one of
the neighbouring atolls, must rank high among the world's best: barbecues
under the palms, snorkeling over the coral, white sand between your toes.
There is a prosaic explanation for the palm-fringed beaches: coconuts wash
ashore, and seeds sprout at the high-water mark. Knowing this does not make
them any less idyllic.
Though the islands were named after James Cook, the first Europeans to see
them were Spanish, in 1595. A Spanish Polynesia never developed, but the
notion is a pleasing one: corridas in which matadors throw leis round the
bulls' necks, perhaps, and a redoubled respect for manana. These days the
Cook Islands' main connection is with New Zealand, in a Monegasque
arrangement whereby the islands are self-governing but Wellington provides
defence and a lot of aid.
ANOTHER short flight takes you on to the islands of Western Samoa, which is
a different sort of place. You can see it at once on the airport road, in
the vivid gardens, covered in black rocks, rootling pigs and the occasional
family grave; in the 100 churches in 20 miles; and in the way most people
don't live in houses.
Instead they have a fale - a floor and a palm-frond roof, separated only by
poles. If it is too hot or cold or wet or windy, blinds are let down, but
there are no walls and only basic furniture.
Stevenson lived, died and is buried on a hill outside Apia. Somerset Maugham
(who set Rain in nearby American Samoa) would be at home in the sunny,
slightly seedy capital, too: you might find him observing the crowd in a
bar, while Paul Theroux sits next to him muttering into his beer. He would
be staying at Aggie Grey's, a burger bar which grew into one of the great
colonial hotels and has recently been brightly refurbished.
Western Samoa feels unwestern. People are friendly enough, but Theroux is
not the only foreigner to have found a sort of teasing hostility in small
villages. The country was the first Pacific island to achieve independence,
in 1962, after decades of often oppressive rule by Germany and New Zealand;
and Samoans are proud of it.
But independence comes at a price. Agriculture and fishing provide little
money. The banana trade was brought to its knees by bad weather and erratic
shipping, and mostly lost to central America. Tourism is one of the biggest
businesses, though it is not very big. The locals might look content but
many are unemployed, and remittances from those who leave home are a big
source of income.
Samoans are their own people, but they hold a special place in the western
imagination, too, thanks to Margaret Mead's Coming of Age in Samoa (drawn
from American Samoa), suggesting that, for Samoans, growing up could be free
of trauma and sex free of guilt. Her findings have been hotly disputed and
certainly aren't true now, but they are a prime example of Pacificism, the
attributing of a better life to a far-off place.
IN FIJI, you are back with the tourists. Not so long ago Fiji was the dark
side of the Pacific myth. Lots of south sea islanders ate people, but the
Fijians seem to have pursued their cuisine with unusual gusto; startled
visitors had their buttocks fondled as they arrived, to check for fat
content. Bligh passed through these waters, hastily and without landing, the
locals hot on his heels.
But the missionaries were as successful here as anywhere else. Fijians are
now devout Christians, and the singing of a church choir will weaken your
knees. Violence is not unknown - we watched a village rugby match end after
10 minutes, with a man carried off and the opposing team facing suspension
for the season - but tourists are no longer in danger.
If they do not come it may be for another reason: politics. In 1987, the
army overthrew the elected government and set out to limit the influence of
Indians, originally brought in by Europeans to work the cane fields but now
almost outnumbering the natives. Fiji isn't South Africa, and the races seem
to co-exist, but the tensions between them are an unwelcome reminder that,
even in paradise, some angels may be more equal than others.
Liberal travellers are used to seeing locals worse off than themselves (if
you want a wealthy Pacific island try Nauru, the Saudi Arabia of guano), but
the sight of inequality being imposed, and the thought of the military doing
it, may make some of them prefer to holiday elsewhere.
They would be missing something if they did. Hard up against the date line,
Fiji claims to be the first country in the world. The sun pours down. The
people are friendly, without fondling your buttocks. The palm trees are
forbidden to grow lower than the hotels. The reefs teem with lurid fish.
The blue lagoons. . . well, both Blue Lagoons, the Jean Simmons one and the
Brooke Shields re-make, were filmed around Yasawa, a string of islands at
the west end. We stayed at the Yasawa Island Lodge in big, bright bungalows
amid vegetation so lush it was hard to believe it had been devastated by a
cyclone only last January. (The cyclone-free southern winter is the time to
visit).
At the east end of Fiji, famous for its glottal stops, we stopped at Matagi
island, which specialises in diving; you can spend the days among some of
the world's richest coral walls and the evenings chatting about tables and
bommies, or swim under waterfalls on neighbouring Taveuni and look out at
night for the cane toads.
You can fly between islands - atolls look particularly beautiful from the
air - or take a cruise, or stay at a hotel and luxuriate. And whenever you
leave, the locals will sing Isa Lei, the haunting Fijian song of farewell.

Moon publish guidebooks to the region; Lonely Planet devotes one to each
island.
