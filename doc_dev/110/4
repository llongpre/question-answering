   Among the the flowers, palms and deep-blue
waters of Hawaii, a widely esteemed native minister, the Rev.
Abraham K. Akaka, bears a message of the ukulele _ for islanders
and the world.
   To the state's singularly mixed culture of races, traditions and
ancestry, he advises, ``Think of yourselves as strings on a
ukulele, each different from the other strings, each preserving its
own tone, yet all necessary to make that beautiful harmony.''
   The objective, he said in a telephone interview, is unity in
diversity, of maintaining valued differences to enrich the whole,
something Hawaii particularly manifests, and the world needs.
   ``The key to it is that all the strings, all the races, nations
and cultures of mankind need to be tuned to one tuner, God, whose
name is love,'' Akaka said. ``When they do that, they retain their
individuality, but in a way that accepts the other strings, in
unity and harmony.''
   Akaka, 71, pastor emeritus of Hawaii's oldest church, the
Kawaiahao Church in downtown Honolulu, and among few clergymen of
original Hawaiian descent, strums the ukulele himself.
   He also has a special formula for diversified mutuality.
   It's a gentle revision of Albert Einstein's famous formula,
energy equals mass times the speed of light squared, by which the
first atomic chain reaction was achieved in 1942 while Akaka was in
seminary in Chicago.
   For different purposes, he proposes his own formula: CM
(creative mutuality) squared equals P (prosperous peace).
   ``It holds great hope for the future of mankind,'' he said. ``If
foreign policies of all nations used the formula, if every family
used it, every corporation and government used it, it would change
the world.
   Akaka for 28 years led the 1,000-member Kawaiahao church, built
in the 1830s of cream-colored coral from island reefs. It's
America's only church with royal pews _ for Hawaii's one-time
monarchy. He retired in 1985.
   But he keeps busy _ speaking, leading weddings and funerals,
blessing new homes, stores and other buildings. Gifts for his
services go to a foundation for native Hawaiian scholarships and to
help the needy.
   ``You cannot retire from the Lord,'' he said.
   More than a third of Hawaii's million people are Christians,
Protestants and Roman Catholics, including most Caucasians and the
native minority, while nearly a third are Buddhist, the rest
Shintoists or other faiths.
   ``We do not have religious strife,'' Akaka said.
   A clergyman of the United Church of Christ, he said the
different religious groups have become ``more and more cooperative
in dealing with issues affecting the well-being of the people.''
   He called modern mass communications media ``an instrument of
God, binding people closer, life with life, nation with nation,
culture with culture, race with race, enabling them to learn about
each other and understand each other.''
   That multicultural quality characterizes Hawaii, where 24.5
percent of the population is Caucasian, 23 percent is of Japanese
ancestry, 20 percent is Hawaiian and part-Hawaiian, 11 percent
Filipino, and smaller numbers of Chinese, Koreans, Samoans and
blacks.
   Native Hawaiians such as Akaka are descended from Polynesians
who came in large canoes from legendary ``Hawaiki'' (believed to be
Marquesas Island) to the west as long as 2,000 years ago.
   A second wave came from Tahiti around A.D. 1000. The Hawaiians
lived in isolation from the world until a British naval officer,
Capt. James Cook, came on the lovely isles in 1778.
   The native religion was polytheistic, with idols to many gods
and goddesses. After the monarchy developed, Queen Kaahumanu in
1819 abolished the native religion.
   The gap soon was filled by Protestant missionaries, first sent
in 1820 by Congregationalist antecedants of Akaka's present
denomination.
   They set up schools and churches, learned the Hawaiian language,
putting it into writing for the first time, introduced democratic
principles. Roman Catholic missionaries came in 1827. Natives
overwhelmingly became Christians.
   Akaka said that unlike cases in which invading Western
civiliation ``overturned and sometimes destroyed native cultures,
the Hawaiian people were pretty fortunate. Large credit is due to
work of the missionaries.''
   Much of ``our culture and history was preserved and
perpetuated,'' Akaka said. `We are Americans today. We love our
country, love the United States... But like any other people, we
love our roots.''
   Noting the names of the main old gods, ``Wakea'' and ``Papa,''
mean space and place _ ``arms that embrace all humanity,'' he added:
   ``That is the meaning of Aloha, the name that the people chose
for our state, the Aloha State. It emphasizes love for all people.
Aloha means we love you, care for you, welcome you. It expresses
that we are a family belonging to each other.''
