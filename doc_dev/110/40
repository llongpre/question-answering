THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS: POUNDING POP TO A PULP

The Pursuit of Happiness is no revolutionary rock band, but it is one worth 
rallying around for listeners who think that a catchy melody and a hammering 
beat is a pop fan's inalienable right. 
</P>
<P>
The strength of the Canadian band's show Saturday night at the Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano was its ability, time and again, to send a capsule of 
captivating melody into orbit on the shoulders of a booster-rocket instrumental 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, by overplaying its strength, the band turned it into a flaw. Like space 
launches, those catchy pop blast-offs became a little routine with successful 
repetition, no matter how magnificent they might be when taken individually. It 
would have helped if the Pursuit of Happiness, which plays again Tuesday at 
Bogart's in Long Beach, slowed the pace from time to time, instead of making 
nearly everything hurtle ahead at full thrust. Even a band with the power to 
launch moon shots should occasionally take a hint from that old 
declaration-signer, Ben Franklin, and realize that sometimes you can get 
electrifying results just by flying a kite. 
</P>
<P>
The band's single-mindedness about rocking out led to stretches of sameness 
during the 80-minute set, and the emphasis on muscle led to a sound mix that 
sometimes obscured the shine on the band's harmony-glazed pop hooks. But if the 
Pursuit of Happiness can be criticized for following a formula to excess, it's 
only fair to appreciate how much fun that formula is. 
</P>
<P>
Moe Berg, who sings, writes the band's songs and plays lead guitar, has an 
Everyman rock voice -- a little nasal, a little flat, a little thin. But 
bright, Bangles-quality harmonies from Kris Abbott and Leslie Stanwyck 
cushioned Berg's voice and balanced out a slashing, driving instrumental attack 
that featured Berg's raw but concise guitar solos. If the band fell into 
sameness from song to song, it achieved a nice sense of proportion and 
development within individual tunes. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Berg's lyrics got lost in the din, but they are another strength. 
Essentially, Berg has one subject, summed up by the title of the band's debut 
album, "Love Junk." But he addresses matters of the heart and loins with wit 
and comes at them from shifting perspectives and odd angles, ranging from crude 
to jarring to winningly innocent. 
</P>
<P>
The band interspersed five new songs in a set that included all of "Love Junk," 
plus a jukebox encore of Mountain's "Mississippi Queen," Badfinger's "No Matter 
What," and Elvis Presley's "Little Sister." The new material followed the style 
of "Love Junk" rather than exploring new directions. 
</P>
<P>
The Pursuit of Happiness was happily free from pretensions. Berg, with his 
wire-frame glasses, long stringy hair and high forehead, looks as if he could 
as easily be a computer hacker as a rocker; between songs, he was a friendly 
host who addressed the audience as "folks" and talked wryly about such things 
as old high-school jealousies and his new Three Stooges T-shirt (it featured 
Larry, rather than Berg's namesake, Moe). Even backup singer Stanwyck, the 
band's only source of glamour, was unassuming in her sultry way. Instead of 
dancing like a performer, with video-choreographed steps, she danced with the 
natural movements of a fan caught up in the music pouring from a powerful band. 
</P>
<P>
Middle act Legal Rein may not cast melodic hooks quite as tastily baited as the 
Pursuit of Happiness', but the San Francisco band played a grabbing set that 
displayed an impressive range -- from noisy, spirited bashing a la the 
Replacements to topical folk balladry, anthem rock and an atmospheric, 
strikingly original remake of the Beatles' "Dear Prudence" that was alternately 
crashing and delicate. A band to watch. 
</P>
<P>
One Day's opening set was capably played and well-received, but the local band 
still seems bogged down in musical territory already staked out by R.E.M. and 
the Smithereens. A wider range of feelings might help: while One Day played 
with bite, Alan Dugan's singing had an unvaryingly tremulous quality that 
limited the band.
