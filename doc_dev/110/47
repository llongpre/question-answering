   As the bassist and songwriting partner of George
Michael, Deon Estus is used to playing to capacity crowds. But the
Detroit native has also learned to appreciate an empty arena.
   Estus, who now has a hit single of his own with ``Heaven Help
Me,'' likes to arrive early for the evening's concert so he can
pursue his favorite hobby: Frisbee.
   ``On the road I carry about 40 Frisbees with kneepads and
gloves,'' he said. ``As they set up the equipment before the show,
either in the stadium or outside the arena, there are no people
around. When we played the Orange Bowl in Florida, we had a ball.
Everybody joined in.''
   Between playing for one of the world's most successful recording
artists and making his debut solo album, ``Spell,'' Estus has
needed to stay in shape. He is already at work on another record
and will collaborate with Michael on the singer's next project, a
double LP.
   ``We understand each other,'' said Estus, who referred to the
singer as his best friend. ``We get along, we go out and have
dinner. It's very easy to sit down and come up with a song. We just
sit down and write good music. He's very professional and so am I.
He's not in competition with me.''
   Estus, whose parents both hold graduate degrees in music, had
any number of instruments to chose from as a child, remembering the
drums, bass, guitars and piano his father brought home. He quickly
mastered them all but admitted to having no such luck playing the
saxophone.
   ``I got rid of it, eventually,'' Estus said. ``It just used to
kill me. It just wasn't for me. It sounded like people when they
screech chalk on the blackboard.''
   Estus settled on the bass and was playing professionally by age
12.
   ``I used to play house parties in the summer and got 20 bucks
each time. That was a lot of dough.''
   Detroit in the 1960s was home to the Motown record label and
Estus took full advantage of the local talent. He became friends
with Marvin Gaye but turned down the opportunity to play on the
late singer's last album, ``Midnight Love,'' released in 1982.
   ``That was a time when I was busy recording. I didn't have any
idea he'd be leaving us so fast,'' said Estus, referring to Gaye's
murder in 1984. ``I thought I'd see him again. Everybody had
troubles but I didn't sense that anything like that would happen.''
   Estus referred to Motown bassist James Jamerson as ``my
teacher.'' Jamerson, who died in 1983, was instrumental to the
Motown sound, creating memorable bass lines on such hits as ``Reach
Out I'll Be There'' and ``Ain't No Mountain High Enough.''
   ``He's the man who brought syncopation to the bass,'' Estus
said. ```My Cherie Amour.' Listen to the bass parts on that. He was
a mindblower. I just never heard bass put like that _ the
expression. When you listen to records today you hear his
influence.''
   Estus' first band was ``Brainstorm,'' which toured in support of
the Whispers and the Brothers Johnson among other groups. He moved
to Europe in the early '80s, and lived in Belgium and Ireland
before eventually settling in London, his current home.
   ``I think I've been influenced by everywhere I've been,'' Estus
said.
   ``Dublin, for instance. When I first worked there I'd listen to
these local bands. The harmonies were really tricky. I was
listening to this rhythm and thought this was the thing closest to
black music I'd heard. I learned a great deal from it.''
   Estus was the silent partner of ``Wham!,'' the British band that
featured Michael and Andrew Ridgeley and had hits in the mid-'80s
with ``Careless Whisper'' and ``I'm Your Man.''
   After Wham! broke up, Estus stayed with Michael, working on the
singer's best-selling ``Faith'' LP. He found time, however, to
record ``Spell'' and served as Michael's opening act on the world
tour.
   ``Heaven Help Me,'' which features Michael on backing vocals, is
a catchy mid-tempo ballad, but Estus rated the title song of
``Spell'' as his favorite.
   ``I got a chance to produce it and I like the orchestration.
It's a fun song, a strong song. Some songs on `Spell' are more
danceable than others, some are poppy, some are soulful.''
   He appeared unconcerned that having a hit record of his own
could jeopardize the partnership with Michael.
   ``If I had a No. 1 album and he had a No. 3 album and he asked
me to open for him, I would say, `Yes.' If this album sold 2 or 3
million, I would still play with him. It's just dealing with egos.''
