   Chris Hillman considers the Desert Rose Band the
best band in which he has ever been.
   In fact, he'd just as soon not even talk about the others,
including the most famous one, the Byrds _ which he and Roger
McGuinn founded just 25 years ago _ and the Flying Burrito Brothers.
   Country music fans like the Desert Rose Band, too. They've made
five straight singles go No. 1 on the best-selling country chart.
And ``Hello Trouble'' is climbing toward the top.
   The band also is nominated as vocal group of the year in the
upcoming Country Music Association awards, for song of the year for
``I Still Believe in You'' and for the Horizon Award, the
association's highest honor.
   Hillman and McGuinn are nominated for country event of the year,
for a performance at Red Rocks in Colorado. Their duet, ``You Ain't
Going Nowhere,'' also is on the current country singles chart.
   ``This band feels the best,'' Hillman says. ``The others never
felt right. The Byrds felt OK. It was such a diverse group of
individuals it self-destructed. This feels like the chemistry is
right.
   ``The six of us are trying to think alike, trying to focus
everybody's vision into one vision.
   ``This has got the best players and singers. It has proven itself
with the chart singles. We're right on the track. A man would be a
fool to wreck this train _ give me a pen, I've got a song title.''
   Guitarist John Jorgenson says, ``In Nashville, everyone is a
songwriter. Every third or fourth line of conversation, somebody
says, `That would be a good song.'''
   In January, Hillman, McGuinn and David Crosby performed as the
Byrds in Los Angeles, trying to trademark the name, countering an
attempt by the group's original drummer, Michael Clarke, to use it.
   ``They talk about re-forming the Byrds,'' Hillman says. ``I don't
think that is going to happen. The Byrds would be wonderful to do if
it didn't interfere with the Desert Rose Band.
   ``I love the other guys but I don't want to look over my
shoulder. This is something that's challenging right now. It takes
enough of my time just to keep abreast of the business and try and
come up with something unique each time we jump into the studio.''
   After the Byrds, the Flying Burrito Brothers, Stephen Stills'
Manassas, Souther-Hillman-Furay, McGuinn Clark &amp; Hillman and time
out for spiritual stocktaking, Hillman cut two solo country albums
for Sugar Hill Records: ``Morning Sky'' and ``Desert Rose.''
   In his teens in San Diego County, he played in country bands
before he and McGuinn created folk-rock with the Byrds and he and
Gram Parsons pushed on into country-rock with the Burritos.
   ``You don't have to be from Kentucky to hear country music,''
Hillman says. ``In the '30s people came to California from
Appalachia, the Midwest and Texas because of the Dust Bowl. In World
War II, came the aircraft industry and then the housing boom which
attracted people from the Southeast, South and Midwest. They brought
their music with them _ hence the real country music style from
California.''
   In 1985, Hillman formed a quartet to open shows for Dan
Fogelberg. He named it the Desert Rose Band when he later added two
more players, making it an electric band with the ability to play
acoustic.
   ```Desert Rose' was one of my songs,'' Hillman says. ``It was a
nickname for somebody's child. I like the song. I've been toying
with the idea of recutting it with this bunch. These guys can play
and sing it better.''
   During a January 1986 booking at the Palomino in North Hollywood,
a Curb Records executive heard the band and later signed it. The
second LP on Curb, ``Running,'' came out last November. Curb is
distributed by MCA.
   Guitarist John Jorgenson, who was interviewed with Hillman in
MCA's office, says that the band early on performed songs from
Hillman's ``Desert Rose'' album.
   Hillman wrote most of the songs on ``Running,'' collaborating
with Steve Hill, a friend from Ventura, Calif. ``I write. We work it
out, see how she flies,'' he said.
   ``Hopefully it retains the personality of the band,'' Jorgenson
said. ``You've got the same six guys playing it, putting their ideas
and feelings into it. On our latest single, we've been hearing that
people listening to it say, `That must be the Desert Rose Band.'''
   Other band members are guitarist Herb Pedersen, Jay Dee Maness on
pedal steel, bassist Bill Bryson and drummer Steve Duncan.
   The hit singles include ``One Step Forward'' and ``He's Back and
I'm Blue'' from the 1987 ``The Desert Rose Band,'' and ``Summer
Wind,'' ``I Still Believe in You,'' ``She Don't Love Nobody'' and
``Hello Trouble'' from ``Running.''
   The band, touring since March 1, took off June to finish
recording a third album for January release.
