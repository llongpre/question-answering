SCHICKELE PLANS PASADENA END TO TOURS AS P.D.Q. BACH;

<P>
Along with all the usual reasons for going to see P.D.Q. Bach, there is now one 
bittersweet additional one. 
</P>
<P>
Sad to say, this may be the last time around for the hapless composer of 
"Concerto for Horn and Hardart," the "No-No Nonette," the "Schleptet in E-flat" 
and many even less distinguished pieces. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, I've decided that this season is my next-to-last touring with P.D.Q.," 
said Peter Schickele, the man who, as "Prof." Peter Schickele, not only 
discovered P.D.Q. -- the fictive, besotted last-born son of J.S. Bach -- but 
also parlayed him into a hefty, improbable 25-year career. 
</P>
<P>
"My last regular concert will be April 1, 1991, which is of course P.D.Q.'s 
birthday," said Schickele by phone from his country getaway in Woodstock, N.Y. 
"It will be with the Pasadena Symphony, which is conducted by Jorge Mester. It 
was Mester who conducted the first P.D.Q. concert when we were Juilliard 
students in 1959, and the very first public concert in 1965." 
</P>
<P>
A moment later, Schickele softened the shocking finality of this announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"It won't necessarily be a complete goodby to P.D.Q. I still plan on doing the 
New York concerts during the last week in December, as long as a crowd shows 
up. And some more recordings." 
</P>
<P>
But with the end of regular touring, an era will end. P.D.Q. Bach concerts -- 
with their distinctive blend of deliciously low slapstick and brilliant musical 
parody -- have taken their place in the very top drawer of musical satire. The 
shows appeal to all levels of musical and comedic sophistication. They are even 
loved by most classical music fans, a group not always associated with a 
razor-sharp sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
The P.D.Q. performances are physically taxing. Making one's entrance by 
shimmying down a knotted rope from a balcony places more of a demand on one 
than, say, walking on from the wings. But the endomorphic, 54-year-old 
Schickele says it is not declining stamina that's behind P.D.Q's 
semi-retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got other things I want to do. I've got an idea for a radio program and a 
couple of television possibilities. These aren't signed and sealed, so I can't 
really talk about them. I also enjoyed the few film scores I've done (four 
altogether, including "Silent Running") and would like to do more. But the 
trouble with that business is that they always want you to start tomorrow, and 
I'm booked up two years in advance." 
</P>
<P>
He also cites the mounting commissions for his "serious" music. This has always 
been a touchy point for Schickele, who was a graduate composition student of 
the eminent composer Vincent Persichetti. Schickele's non-P.D.Q. music is 
widely performed and, for the most part, warmly embraced by audiences and 
critics. But Schickele is clearly discomfited that the unwelcome shadow of 
P.D.Q. hangs inappropriately over many of the serious performances. "Some 
people go into a concert of my serious stuff determined to find things to laugh 
at. And they do. It's as if they can't accept the distinction." 
</P>
<P>
So one additional purpose of P.D.Q.'s withdrawal from the public stage will be 
to help put the two aspects of Schickele's career into what he regards as a 
healthier balance. 
</P>
<P>
"My hope is that in the long run there would be an appreciation for both. To me 
they are very complementary. In a way, the spirit that leads P.D.Q. also gives 
my serious music a sunny, dramatic quality. . . . On the other hand, to tell 
you the truth, if I were forced to list my favorite works -- something I hope 
I'm never forced to do -- I would include some P.D.Q. pieces along with the 
Peter Schickele pieces." 
</P>
<P>
Schickele conceded that without the impetus of touring, certain ideas for gags 
or bits that have been percolating may never be realized. 
</P>
<P>
"I have an 'Ideas' file that's full of napkins from Holiday Inns and that kind 
of thing. Over the years some of them have indeed turned into pieces." 
</P>
<P>
One of them that hasn't is a rather recondite idea for a sendup of Paul 
Hindemith's Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes by Carl Maria von Weber. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be fun to write a piece called 'Symphonic Metamorphosis on 
Themes From Symphonic Metamorphosis on Themes by Carl Maria von Weber by Paul 
Hindemith by Peter Schickele.' But I'm not sure the piece could have ever lived 
up to the title." 
</P>
<P>
Schickele also noted ruefully that certain P.D.Q. instruments may forever 
remain in the concept stage. "A timpanist wanted me to invent a ukulele da 
gamba, and I'm sorry I didn't do it." The uke would have been played -- like 
the now-out-of-fashion viola da gamba -- upright, between the performer's 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
But the P.D.Q. muse is not silent. Schickele recently released a new recording 
on the Telarc label and another is already in the works. 
</P>
<P>
"I have the same arrangement with Telarc that I used to have with Vanguard (his 
longtime record company during the '60s and '70s). It's a gentleman's agreement 
that I won't do any P.D.Q. Bach records without telling them first. But I'm not 
tied down to having to produce one a year, or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are some P.D.Q. commissions left to honor. Among them at the 
moment is a piece that will premiere later this season with the Cleveland 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
Its title alone should reassure any P.D.Q. fans who fear that the master is in 
danger of losing his creative spark. It's called . . . "The Safe Sextet."
