   Reggae has had its ups and downs over the past
decade, but Frederick ``Toots'' Hibbert just keeps playing.
   Hibbert, who has been making music since the early 1960s before
the word reggae ever hit American music stores, is back with his
first LP since 1981, ``Toots in Memphis,' a collection of soul
standards.
   His raspy voice, capable of sweetness and toughness, has been
likened to the late Otis Redding, one of soul's greatest singers.
The reggae star covers a pair of obscure Redding songs, ``I've Got
Dreams to Remember,'' and ``Hard to Handle.'' He also sings the
rhythm 'n' blues hit, ``Knock on Wood,'' and Al Green's ``Love and
Happiness.''
   ``I always listened to Al Green, Otis and Michael Jackson,
Stevie Wonder,'' Hibbert said. ``We are related somewhat.''
   Reggae's most famous rhythm section, Sly Dunbar and Robbie
Shakespeare, plays on the record. Also featured are guitarist
Teenie Hodges, who helped write ``Love and Happiness,'' and Andrew
Love of the Memphis Horns.
   Many of soul's greatest artists, including Redding, Wilson
Pickett and Aretha Franklin, recorded in Memphis. The idea for
making an album there often had been suggested to Hibbert, and the
singer finally contacted Island Records president Chris Blackwell
to express his interest.
   ``I'm not just a reggae singer,'' Hibbert explained. ``I can
sing anything, any song, rewrite the song and make it into my
style.''
   Thanks to young artists such as Ziggy Marley and Maxi Priest,
reggae has enjoyed a resurgence over the past year, inspiring those
who long for a return to the music's heyday of the early 1970s.
   Few of the stars who first made reggae internationally popular
are still around. Bob Marley, the music's most celebrated artist,
died of cancer in 1980. Peter Tosh, Marley's onetime bandmate and a
major performer in his own right, was murdered in 1987. Jimmy
Cliff, whose talents were featured in the popular reggae film,
``The Harder They Come,'' is no longer a commercial success.
   In the early '60s, Hibbert formed a ska trio, ``The Vikings,''
with Raleigh Gordon and Jerry Mathias. They quickly became one of
Jamaica's most popular acts, with Prince Buster producing and
Hibbert leading the way on a series of local hits, ``Pain in My
Belly,'' ``Little Flea'' and ``Dog War.''
   The group renamed itself the Maytals in 1966 and won that year's
Jamaican Festival Song competition with ``Bam, Bam.'' Hibbert
formed a permanent niche in reggae history by giving the music its
name in a 1968 song, ``Do the Reggay.''
   ``We were just playing around,'' Hibbert recalled. ``We used to
have slogans, jokes. Sometimes we'd say of a girl that's not
looking so great, `She's like a streggae.' That word was there and
one morning I said, `Let's do the `reggae.' I didn't think that the
name would last.''
   Under the production of Leslie Kong, the Maytals entered their
peak of popularity with a string of songs that became reggae
standards: ``Funky Kingston,'' ``54-46 That's My Number'' and
``Pressure Drop,'' a featured number in ``The Harder They Come.''
   But Hibbert was anxious to experiment with other forms of music,
covering the rock 'n' roll oldie ``Louie, Louie,'' and a
surprisingly danceable version of John Denver's ``Take Me Home,
Country Roads.'' Hibbert was surprised himself when he learned who
performed the original song.
   ``When I listened to it first I thought it was Ray Charles and I
always liked Ray Charles' sound,'' he said. ``I have a
country-and-western voice, very high pitched. I can find that voice
anytime.''
   Many reggae stars have been outspoken politically. Bob Marley's
active support for Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley led to an
assasination attempt in 1976.
   Priest and ``Burning Spear'' have each recorded tributes to the
late black nationalist leader, Marcus Garvey. Ziggy Marley's latest
album has several political songs.
   But Hibbert, who broke up with the Maytals in the early '80s,
prefers to concentrate on personal matters. ``I don't write about
politics,'' the singer noted. ``I write about naturality, about
real things that happen to real people.''
   One of Hibbert's most popular songs is ``Love Is Gonna to Let Me
Down,'' a heartfelt ballad.
   ``It's about a girl, and I'm giving encouragement,'' he said.
``It can mean anybody, male or female. `Everytime I see your face,
something moves in my heart.' I believe in love so even if love
lets you down, love also never dies.''
   He also differs from other reggae musicians by not being a
member of the Rastafarian religious sect. ``Reggae Got Soul'' is a
better way of expressing Hibbert's philosophy.
   ``I know it's got soul and if you got talent and soul, you can
sing it,'' he said. ``Everybody's got soul. Reggae music is the
music that carries love and good principles with it.''
