   As a Quaker, Bonnie Raitt has devoted long hours
to the cause of world peace. Once she straps a guitar around her
shoulder, however, the gloves come off.
   Equally adept at singing hard rockers and soulful ballads, she
emphasized in a recent interview that at 39, she does not intend to
mellow with age.
   Her new album, ``Nick of Time,'' contains music worthy of such
titles as ``I Will Not Be Denied,'' ``Real Man'' and ``I Ain't
Gonna Let You Break My Heart Again.''
   ``If anybody had any doubts about how I feel, they can just
listen to those three songs. `I Will Not Be Denied' is the
strongest statement on what I feel about love at the moment. The
songs are cathartic and I will be not denied. I will get what I
deserve. When you get beat up, you eventually stop taking it.''
   The past decade has been difficult for Raitt. Warner Bros., her
longtime record label, dropped her in 1983, refusing to release the
album she had just completed for three years. Contractual
difficulties forced her to tour without a band for the last two
years, and she had to overcome a drinking problem.
   But her luck has begun to change. When producer Hal Wilner put
together an album of Disney songs last year, he paired Raitt with
Don Was of Was (Not Was) on ``Baby Mine,'' from the ``Dumbo''
soundtrack. Raitt and Was became fast friends and he ended up
producing ``Nick of Time,'' released on Capitol Records.
   The album's 11 songs include covers of John Hiatt and Jerry L.
Williams as well as two Raitt compositions.
   ``I wanted to make it a roots, stripped down record,'' she said.
``It was an easily accomplished, well thought out, very smooth
album _ the best recording situation I've ever had.''
   Raitt, the daughter of Broadway singer John Raitt, was born in
Los Angeles and quickly became interested in music, learning folk
songs at summer camp.
   ``All the counselors were from colleges that were experiencing a
folk music revival. Being a little 10-year-old impressionable kid,
I idolized my counselors. I completely bought into Bob Dylan's
lyrics as seriously as the rest of America, but I was a little
kid.''
   Joan Baez was also an early favorite.
   ``She killed me when I was a kid. She was Quaker also. I wanted
so badly to have long hair and be thin. I'd look in the mirror and
wonder when I was going to get cheekbones.''
   Raitt's musical interests broadened as a teen-ager. She would
listen to early rock 'n' roll and soul music, and began a lifetime
passion for blues after entering Radcliffe College in 1967.
   ``Through the college radio station I met Dick Waterman, who
managed `Big Boy' Crudup and Mississippi John Hurt and had helped
rediscover Son House. We became really good friends and through him
I met all those blues guys. I got to travel, carry their things for
them and got to know all of them and watch them play.
   ``I was a complete blues nut but I never expected to do this for
a living. I just kind of played as a hobby. Then one day I needed
to make some money and a girl was playing at a club. I knew I was
at least as good as her.''
   Raitt's first two albums, ``Bonnie Raitt'' and ``Give It Up,''
came out in the early 1970s and showed her love of jazz, soul,
blues, folk and rock. She covered songs by the Marvelettes, Stephen
Stills, Jackson Browne and blues singer Sippie Wallace, another
major influence.
   Although just in her early 20s, Raitt showed surprising depth
and confidence, tackling the complex emotional themes of ``Love Has
No Pride'' and ``Too Long at the Fair.''
   ``People call and say the songs have really touched them, that a
song has gotten them through a difficult period or they met their
boyfriends through my show. You either touch people or you don't,
and if you're lucky you get to do it for a living.''
   She used a variety of producers in the '70s, including Paul
Rothchild and Peter Asher, who also worked with Linda Ronstadt and
James Taylor.
   ``I basically produce myself,'' Raitt said. ``I pick the songs
with the collaboration of the producer. The producer's a partner,
another set of ears. It's a voice of rationality when I get too
emotionally involved. ... You need to have a partner in there
because it's a lot of pressure.''
   Her political and musical interests merged in 1979 when she
helped organize the celebrated MUSE (Musicians United for Safe
Energy) concerts at Madison Square Garden. She continues to help
with a variety of causes, including the anti-apartheid movement in
South Africa, and the campaign against deforestation in the Amazon
jungle.
   ``I used to go to peace marches and civil rights marches when I
was a kid. I stuffed envelopes when I was 11. I first picked up the
guitar when I was a little kid because Bob Dylan and Joan Baez were
singing protest songs at peace marches.
   ``Justice is justice, whether it's between a man and a woman or
a guy and his dog.''
   Raitt concludes ``Nick of Time'' with an original song, ``The
Road's My Middle Name,'' a bluesy stomp that reaffirms her
dedication to music.
   ``I never pretended to be a great artist or a great
originator,'' she said. ``I'm just an interpreter of good music. If
my voice and guitar playing, sensibility of putting together a
band, and arrangement of songs appeals to a certain group of
people, then all I need is enough fans to allow me to pay the
musicians.''
