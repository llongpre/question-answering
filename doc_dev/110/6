JACK SMITH: IN HAWAII, HOW GREEN IS HIS VALLEY

In Honolulu the lush Nuuanu Valley rises through a pass in the dark green 
mountains to a precipice called the pali. It is a place where people often stop 
and park their cars to peer from a viewpoint above the stupendous cliff out 
over the velvet green coastal plain below. 
</P>
<P>
Our friend Harry Albright drove us up through the valley through vegetation so 
green and thick it made us forget for a moment the concrete excrescence that 
Waikiki had become. From the pali we could see the rugged windward shore of the 
island, and the town of Kaneohe. It was still relatively small and low in 
profile. 
</P>
<P>
For nearly two years one of my jobs on the night desk of the Advertiser had 
been to call the local police departments in Kaneohe and other outposts on the 
island to ask if there was any news. The routine never varied: 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Advertiser. Any news tonight?" 
</P>
<P>
"No. No news tonight." 
</P>
<P>
The only time they ever had any news was on Dec. 7, 1941, and that night I 
never bothered to call. We had enough news. 
</P>
<P>
My wife remembered standing at the pali one day when the eminent pianist Artur 
Rubinstein walked up and stood beside her. He was playing that night in 
Honolulu and she went to hear him. Culture is where you find it. 
</P>
<P>
The pali is famous in Hawaiian legend. King Kamehameha, who brought all the 
Hawaiian Islands under his crown, is said to have driven the locals to the pali 
and pushed them over, as commemorated in the popular song (as I remember it): 
</P>
<P>
King Kamehameha, conqueror of the Islands, 
</P>
<P>
Became a famous hero one day. 
</P>
<P>
He conquered the native army, 
</P>
<P>
And pushed them over the pali 
</P>
<P>
And crowned himself 
</P>
<P>
the king of Hawaii Nei. 
</P>
<P>
We drove back down through Waikiki and around Diamond Head and up into its 
crater, a shallow bowl that has become a park. The old gun emplacements could 
still be seen around its crest. It was supposed to make Oahu impregnable, but 
on Dec. 7 it was helpless against the attack by air. 
</P>
<P>
That evening we dined with three shipmates in the Orchids Room of the 
Halekulani, one of the three remaining hotels of the prewar era. It had been a 
charming retreat, a low central building surrounded by cottages. Now the 
cottages were gone, of course, replaced by concrete towers, but the hotel 
itself looked reminiscent of the original, though modernized. 
</P>
<P>
Before dining we had a drink on the terrace overlooking Waikiki Beach. Towering 
palm trees were lighted dramatically. A trio of Hawaiian musicians sang the old 
favorites, among them "Farewell My Tane." 
</P>
<P>
My chest tightened. I had learned that song as a scullion on the S.S. Monterey. 
At night after our watch the chief scullion, a pure Hawaiian, would get out his 
ukulele and sing Hawaiian songs. My favorite of all he sang was "Farewell My 
Tane." 
</P>
<P>
I used to lie on my bunk in the ship's glory hole (that part of the forecastle 
where the lower forms of marine life lived) and wonder if I would ever meet my 
Tane, and whether our relationship would be that poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 Farewell my Tane, child of a coral sea 
</P>
<P>
We dreamed of heaven, now you've forgotten me 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, I never met my Tane. I married a haole girl, and we are still 
together. 
</P>
<P>
In the morning the hostess at our hotel's restaurant asked whether we wanted 
the American or the Japanese buffet. "What's in the Japanese?" I asked naively. 
"Rice, raw fish . . . ,"she began. "American," I interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
I know the war is over. I am even willing to concede that in some respects the 
Japanese won. But my acceptance of things Japanese does not extend to raw fish. 
</P>
<P>
We flew home in a plane so crowded that my wife and I, having changed from a 
later flight, couldn't sit together. Oh well, we had survived longer 
separations. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered white wine with lunch and the flight attendant brought me a small 
can. The weather was rough, and when I opened it, I discovered from the spots 
on my necktie and my pants, alas, that it was red. 
</P>
<P>
But who could complain? At least the door didn't blow out in flight.
