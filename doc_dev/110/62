   As a youngster, aspiring musician Floyd
Cramer would agitate his piano teachers by playing ``by ear'' rather
than learning to read music.
   Despite their protests, Cramer became the best piano player in
the small sawmill town of Huttig, Ark. In fact, he went on to become
one of the most famous in the world.
   In a career spanning more than 30 years, he played on many of
Elvis Presley's records and movie soundtracks. His million-selling
hit ``Last Date'' became a piano standard. He even developed a piano
technique often referred to as the ``slip note'' style.
   Today, he's seen often in TV ads, selling such albums as ``World
Famous Love Songs'' and ``Treasury of Favorites.'' He's sold more
than a million copies through TV marketing alone in the past three
years.
   Prior to making records for sale by television, he spent 23 years
with RCA Records and joined guitarist Chet Atkins and sax player
Boots Randolph as Nashville's best-known instrumentalists. He's
recorded more than 50 albums.
   All this came from a bashful kid who disliked practicing,
exasperated his teachers and still admits that classical music is
beyond his limits.
   He still doesn't like to practice. He even avoids the term,
preferring to call it ``playing'': ``Some call it practice. I call
it play. That's because I enjoy it; practice I don't enjoy.''
   Regardless of what he calls it, Cramer has been stroking the
ivories since his parents bought a spinet piano when he was 5.
   ``I had some lessons, but I just wasn't interested,'' the
55-year-old musician recalled. ``It was the confinement, I guess.
But I enjoyed playing by ear. The teachers got upset because I
learned it by ear.''
   By age 15 he was playing and traveling with country music stars
such as Webb Pierce and Faron Young. In his early 20s, he was
playing piano on a flatbed truck and in school auditoriums on a tour
of Texas featuring a young singer named Elvis Presley.
   Cramer later played on most of Presley's records and in his
movies including ``Blue Hawaii,'' ``Girl Happy'' and ``Roustabout.''
   ``He was always nice to us,'' Cramer said about the recording
sessions. ``He enjoyed the musicians and felt very comfortable.''
   Cramer has 6- and 9-year-old granddaughters who have become
Presley fans.
   His ``Last Date'' in 1960 is still heard on radio stations
playing ``golden oldies,'' and the tune has been learned by
thousands of young piano students who weren't even born when Cramer
wrote and recorded it.
   ``It's a simple melody,'' he said. ``It's good exercise for both
hands. You are playing solid left hand patterns and a dominant
melody with the right hand. It's different and fresh to most piano
students.''
   The song has found its way into American ceremonies, also.
   ``I've had people tell me they'd like to have it played at their
funeral,'' Cramer said. ``And others say they'd like to have it
played at their wedding. About two weeks ago, someone said it was
played at the altar call at church. So it means different things to
different people.''
   In 1984, at the request of Michael Jackson, Cramer played piano
at a birthday party for Jackson's mother because he is her favorite
musical performer.
   Cramer quoted the young rock superstar as saying he'd been
listening to ``Last Date'' all his life and that Cramer's music had
influenced his style.
   ``The song has been very good to me; I'm proud of it; I play it
every chance I get,'' Cramer said.
   His style of playing is slurring, or bending, notes. It's sort of
a near-miss on the keyboard. ``They call it everything,'' he said.
``Some call it a mistake with a quick recovery.''
   He describes his own gift as ``being able to play with feeling,
to interpret a mood of a song.'' But he acknowledges some
shortcomings.
   ``I'm not good at classical. Some I wouldn't dare try because
it's beyond me. Some would say it's beyond my capabilities,
technique or training or my mind of comprehension. But I know my
limits, that's the key.''
   Nevertheless, he still learns just about every time he sits down
at one of the three pianos he owns.
   ``I learn something all the time: a different way to play certain
things. Different songs and melodies contribute to that.''
   Does he sing?
   ``Just for my own amusement,'' he said.
