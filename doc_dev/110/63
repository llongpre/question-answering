   Chris Isaak's dark and dreamlike music has
long been a hit with audiences in the San Francisco area, but
national fame and a spot on the pop charts have eluded him.
   A hit single would be swell, says the 32-year-old singer and
songwriter, but it's not the most important thing.
   ``I like to sing. If I had a hit, that'd be great,'' Isaak says.
``I'd be really overjoyed to have a hit _ tickled pink. But I'm not
worried about that. I'm more worried about just keeping my job.''
   Maybe he's not a household word, but Isaak has a solid reputation
as someone who borrows the best from country-western and rock 'n'
roll to produce an original sound.
   His newly released album, ``Heart Shaped World,'' is more upbeat
than earlier efforts and possibly his best. Guitarist James Wilsey
adds a polished, heavily tremoloed background to Isaak's
velvety-soft vocals.
   Wilsey is largely responsible for the sound that has grabbed the
attention of critics. He has a sharp ear for what works with Isaak's
lyrics, but he says a sophisticated computer system is partly
responsible for the sound he achieves on stage.
   This is the band's third album since 1985, and the third time
observers have said Isaak is teetering on the edge of national
acclaim.
   But the man often compared to Roy Orbison and Elvis Presley, two
of his many idols, has a hard time being serious when describing the
new album.
   ``This is pretty much me singing a bunch of songs I wrote _ just
like the first two albums,'' he said. ``If you liked the first two
albums, this is pretty much the same route. If you didn't like the
first two albums, this is all different.''
   If Isaak in person was like the Isaak in his music, one would
probably meet a somewhat somber person dressed in black. His songs
often speak of lost, or nearly lost, love. One imagines the
songwriter sitting in an unlighted room peering out a window at a
grimy, pre-dawn city street.
   But the in-person Isaak is a regular cut-up. The Stockton,
Calif., native talks with a slightly goofy rural California accent _
which disappears when he sings _ and gets a kick out of telling
stories, like the one about how he learned to play guitar by
sneaking into his older brother's room.
   Nick Isaak had told his younger brother to stay away from his
prized instrument.
   ``Every day, it was forbidden. But he'd go to school and I'd play
his guitar. I'd put it back exactly where it belonged,'' the singer
said. ``One day, I was sitting there watching TV _ I had put the
guitar back _ and the string just popped. They'll do that sometimes.
I heard it go BRRROOOIING. I thought, `I'd been playing it. But I
wasn't playing it right now.'
   ``He worked me over pretty good for that one.''
   Then there's the one about how he acquired his first guitar, the
Silvertone he's played on all three albums and the inspiration for
his first band's name. He'd been eyeballing it every day as he
walked by a local pawnshop. Finally, he asked his brother for help.
   ``My brother was better at arguing on prices, so I said, `Why
don't you go see if you can get a deal.' So he called the fire
department and told them the pawn shop was a fire hazard, so they
had to get rid of a bunch of stuff.''
   He bought the guitar for $80.
   ``We didn't like the people at that pawn shop, anyway. They'd
sold my mother a single guitar string for $4,'' Isaak said.
   Fans are familiar with Isaak's brand of humor. He often
introduces songs with long whimsical tales involving members of the
band. He drives a 1964 Nova. At a recent record release party at the
Fairmont Hotel, he showed up in a floral-patterned suit made from
window drapes.
   And for some undisclosed reason, Isaak thinks Tikis are neat. He
keeps dozens of the Polynesian idols, big and small, on his dining
room table and in his kitchen. He even owns a painting of a Tiki, an
awful thing that looks like it might have been drawn under the
influence of mescaline.
   But the zaniness doesn't carry over into the music.
   Isaak has always thought of his style as country-western.
However, numerous influences are apparent, including rockabilly and
rhythm and blues.
   ``I try not to make things that are too angry-sounding,'' he
said. ``It makes me nervous when I hear music that is just people
banging away. If I listen to it, it's got to be pretty, like Bing
Crosby.''
   ``I don't like people who can't sing but say, `I'll make records
despite that fact.'''
   Critics often speak of the dark side of Isaak's music. One deejay
in Washington dubbed him the ``Baron of Brood,'' and singles such as
``You Owe Me Some Kind of Love,'' off his second LP, and ``Wicked
Game'' off the new album exemplify that lonelier side.
   As a young man living in Stockton, a place he describes as
``Fresno without all the glitter,'' Isaak attended the University of
Pacific and took up boxing. But like early ideas of being a
filmmaker, the boxing career petered out. He went to Japan as a
transfer student, and spent much of his time singing and playing the
guitar.
   Isaak came to San Francisco in 1980 and later hooked up with Erik
Jacobsen, who produced his albums and eventually became his manager.
Until he met Wilsey, Isaak was the lead guitarist in his band.
   ``Jimmy and I met in 1982. I had a three-piece band and he said,
`Hey let me in, I can play guitar better than that.''
   Wilsey, who started out running the sound system for Isaak's
first band, said he was immediately taken with the budding singer.
   ``I realized he was the funniest person I'd ever met. It was nice
to hang around him and laugh when other things seemed depressing,''
Wilsey said.
   Aside from the music, Isaak has enjoyed a successful sideline
career as a film actor. He's appeared in two episodes of the TV show
``Private Eye'' and had a cameo in Jonathan Demme's ``Married to the
Mob.''
