<TEXT>  "Cereal Killers"; (Giant/Warner Bros., all formats); (star)(star)(star) 1/2;
AH, THIS lovable quartet of perpetual adolescents from Scarsdale, N.Y., isn't
breaking any new ground -- not at all. There's not a thing here that couldn't
have come from the Clash, the Buzzcocks or the Plimsouls. It's the group's
third and most polished album to date.;    "Green Eggs and Crack" and "Son of
Sam I Am" were just blueprints compared to the fully developed, masterfully
produced picture we see here: classic, chiming guitar parts, sweet harmonies
and -- thank God! -- a wry, self-effacing sense of humor.;    With such
dashboard-pounding ditties as "King of Beers" and "Thanksgiving in Reno," it's
a cinch these guys aren't exactly re-writing the Brandenburg Concerto. No
matter. The view in pop's rear-view mirror is a sweet one worth savoring for
at least an hour. "Cereal Killers" is this week's answer to the ageless
post-adolescent query, "Hey dude, where's the party?"; -- David Plotnikoff; 
THE KNACK; "Serious Fun"; (Charisma, all formats); (star); THE Knack had a
brief heyday in 1979, when its debut album, "Get the Knack," sold a stunning 7
million copies with the hit "My Sharona." Two records and many diminishing
returns later the group called it quits.;    Now, after nine years, they're
back, but "Serious Fun" suggests they shouldn't have bothered.;    "I Want
Love," "Body Talk," the title cut -- all of the songs, really -- are dismal
rock 'n' bore numbers with ham-handed rhythms and noisy guitars and nothing
else.;    "One Day At A Time" does have a melodic feel that gives a hint of
what the Knack could do if it tried. But the rest of the time, the group seems
intent on trying to conjure up the sound -- and success -- of its past. "Doin'
the Dog" is a blatant "My Sharona" copy.;    There is nothing fun about this
disc. All it really proves is that the Knack's no longer got it.; -- Harry
Sumrall;  Blues; ALBERT COLLINS; "Iceman"; (Charisma, cassette and CD);
(star)(star) 1/2; THIS album suffers from comparison with what the "Master of
the Telecaster" has recorded previously. The two best live acts in blues are
B.B. King and Albert Collins, and Collins' live albums, "Frozen Alive!" and
"Live in Japan," capture so much of the man's power that it'll always be
difficult for studio work to compare.;    That's a shame, especially because
Collins is using most of his live band on this LP, including the best blues
drummer in the business, Soko Richardson, and his backing guitarist, Debbie
Davies.;    Collins is known as the "Iceman" for his particular form of
funkiness, and this album is aptly named in that sense, but it gets old after
a while.;    Some relief from the over-serving of funk is heard on a slower
blues, "Don't Mistake Kindness for Weakness," and on "The Hawk." "Mr. Collins,
Mr. Collins" is a funky treatment of a refrain he has heard probably all too
much: "Mr. Collins . . . please, Mr. Collins! Please don't play so loud!"; --
John Orr;  Country; BOB WILLS; AND HIS TEXAS PLAYBOYS; "The McKinney Sisters";
(Kaleidoscope, cassette and CD); (star)(star)(star); The name of Bob Wills has
lived on through the years, but it's a good bet not many people remember the
McKinney sisters.;    In 1946, Dean and Evelyn McKinney, who had already
established their singing and radio career in their native Birmingham, Ala.,
joined Wills and His Texas Playboys in Fresno.;    The result? Chemistry not
even DuPont could match.;    Kaleidoscope has issued a collection of Wills
songs featuring the McKinney Sisters that were culled from the Tiffany
Transcriptions, discs that were produced for radio in 1946-47 and just
released.;    Included are swing favorites made over in Wills' inimitable
Texas swing style and sweetened by the McKinneys' lead vocals -- "It's a Good
Day," "Blue Skies," "You're Only in My Arms" and "Put Your Arms Around Me.";  
 This isn't typical Bob Wills fare -- the McKinneys were only occasionally
featured singers. But the exuberant melodies and the sisters' exquisite
harmonies easily stand on their own.;    -- Deborah Hopewell;  World Music;
MILTON NASCIMENTO; "TXAI"; (Columbia CD, cassette); (star)(star)(star)(star);
Txai means "companion" or "the other half of me" in the language of the
Kaxinawa Indians, who live in the lungs of the planet, the Amazon rain forest.
But it's not necessary to know Kaxinawa to enjoy this wonderful admixture of
Brazilian pop and snippets of local culture.;    As a synthesizer of musical
forms, Nascimento takes a bold step forward with this new collection, which --
far from a flirtation with exoticism -- is actually a plea for the
preservation of a doomed culture and a dying planet.;    In 1989, the singer
traveled up the river Jurua with a team of anthropologists, musicologists and
ecologists, and met with Indians, fishers, rubber tappers and other forest
people.;    "TXAI" is part of a campaign in support of the rain forest.;   
There are eight compositions by Nascimento here, but the real excitement comes
from the Yanomani, Kayapo, Surui and Waiapi Indians -- the wheezing,
bagpipe-like horns of "Hoeiepereiga," the Hawaiian-sounding "Nozani Na" and
the pulsating cries of "Bau Metoro" and "Baridjumoko," which recall the songs
of the Plains Indians of the United States.; -- James V. Murray;  VARIOUS
ARTISTS; "Brazil Classics 3: Forro etc."; (Luaka Bop/Warner Bros., all
formats); (star)(star)(star); FIRST the bad news: Talking Heads fans had
better get used to playing the recent "Little Creatures" and "Naked" albums ad
nauseam. If this latest David Byrne side project is any indication, the
intrepid bandleader-cum-cultural-anthropologist won't be coming back from
safari real soon.;    In addition to this third volume of Brazil classics,
Byrne's epic quest to capture indigenous Third World rhythms has spawned "Cuba
Classics 1.";    Now, the good news. This wide-ranging collection of forro --
an archaic, rural dance music from Brazil's vast northeastern frontier -- is
infinitely more accessible to mainstream listeners than its scholarly (and
often tedious) predecessors.;    This album showcases the new generation of
forro stars who came to the fore in the late '70s with a blend of traditional
rhythms and international pop. Sure, this stuff is somewhat esoteric, but you
won't need a doctorate in anthropology to understand the near-universal appeal
of this festive, unvarnished slice of Brazilian cowboy life.; -- D.P.; 
Reissues; THE BEACH BOYS; "The Beach Boys: Lost and Found 1961-1962"; (DCC
Compact Classics, cassette and CD); (star)(star); BRIAN Wilson, brothers Carl
and Dennis, Mike Love and Al Jardine were in their teens when they made their
first recordings for Hite and Dorinda Morgan in September 1961.;    Those
sessions, the beginnings of the Beach Boys sound, are resurrected along with
other unreleased early recordings in this album culled from the newly
rediscovered master tapes.;    Featured are primitive versions of "Surfin',"
the group's earliest song, "Surfin' Safari," "Judy," "Luau," "Barbie," "What
Is a Young Girl Made Of" and an instrumental alternately known as "Beach Boy
Stomp" and "Karate.";    A few of these tracks have been available in the past
on inferior sounding releases. The difference here, besides the clear sound,
is that false starts, multiple takes and studio chatter can be heard for the
first time.;    Despite this, it's hard to imagine these tapes will cause more
than a ripple with anyone other than die-hard fans.; -- Steve Marinucci  </TEXT>
