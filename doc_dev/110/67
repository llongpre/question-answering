   Confidence isn't a problem for English
singer John Wesley Harding. This is, after all, a 24-year-old who's
written updates of the Rolling Stones' ``Sympathy for the Devil''
and the Everly Brothers' ``Cathy's Clown'' on his debut album.
   Identity, however, might not be such a sure thing.
   ``Bob Dylan is my father,'' sings the man who takes his stage
name from Dylan's 1968 album. ``Joan Baez is my mother. And I am
their bastard son.''
   It's a joke, of course. Harding turns the tables on fans who
love to spot the influences in a musician's work. His debut album,
``Here Comes the Groom,'' is a feast of word games and
sound-alikes, as well as a showcase for a promising beginner.
   ``I hate people who claim that they're not influenced by people
they're obviously influenced by _ like the Jesus and Mary Chain and
the Velvet Underground. I mean, give me a break,'' said the
precocious young singer.
   ``I decided to be completely the opposite. To be playful, I
claimed that Bob Dylan is my father and Joan Baez is my mother,
which is obviously ridiculous.''
   The real-life Wesley Harding Stace is quick to slyly note that
Dylan and Baez were touring England together the year he was born
in Hastings. Growing up, Stace wanted to be a sportswriter. He
studied English Literature at Cambridge University, writing a
doctoral dissertation on the role of Jimmy Stewart in American
films.
   He also wrote plays, short stories and songs. Armed with an
acoustic guitar, he regularly performed his songs and others in
pubs around Cambridge and, in true music business fashion, was
``discovered'' there.
   There was little calculation in the name change, he said. Stace
took the name John Wesley Harding because his solo performances
were ``kind of Dylan-y.''
   ``I think changing your name is quite cool because nobody seems
to do it right now,'' he said. ``Everybody worries about integrity.
I couldn't imagine Tracy Chapman changing her name.''
   Harding was signed to the independent British label Demon
Records and put out his first record in 1988.
   Which brings up another comparison. Demon is Elvis Costello's
label. So is Warner Bros., home of Harding's U.S. debut. So is
Plangent Visions Music, Harding's song publishing company.
Two-thirds of Costello's old backup band, the Attractions, play on
Harding's album. And, in spots, Harding's voice sounds chillingly
like Costello's.
   Coincidence? Harding thinks so.
   ``Critics have got to do it. They've got to put you somewhere,''
he said. ``It's like saying to a critic, `describe John Wesley
Harding without making reference to Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello,
Graham Parker, Nick Lowe and the Byrds.' It's like saying describe
a tennis ball without saying it's round or it's a ball. I don't
particularly object to it.
   ``But it's very foolhardy in a way. Clearly the songs that I
write are nothing like Elvis Costello songs.''
   Indeed, such lines as ``if there's a nuclear winter, at least it
will snow,'' show a sense of humor Costello took a while to reveal.
   ``He writes great songs and they're cruel, they're untender,''
he said. ``They're inhumane sometimes. ... My songs are very
gentle, optimistic. They're meant to be very charming. I can't see
any similarity in the lyrical outlook whatsoever.''
   Don't look for a lyric sheet on the album, even though words
tumble out of Harding's mouth as fast as he can take a breath.
   ``I used to buy John Hiatt albums and by the time I got back to
the house I read all the lyrics and it ruined the album for me,''
he said. ``My big thing is the shape of the song. I don't want you
to know where the song is going to end, or where the bridge is.
It's a little bit of oral drama.''
   Harding's song, ``The Devil in Me,'' is a sampling of the
world's ills, from war to acid rain. ``Put it down to the devil in
me,'' he sings as the narrator for those responsible.
   Harding calls it a ``folk sample'' of ``Sympathy for the
Devil.'' He said he wanted to do a politically responsible version
of the ``amoral'' Rolling Stones song.
   The song ``Cathy's New Clown'' refers to the Everly Brothers
classic only with a brief touch of the melody during the fadeout.
Harding wanted to update the emotions expressed in the nearly
30-year-old song.
   The tunes on Harding's solo album are breezy and punchy. Only a
duet with Peter Case sounds as if it were a traditional folk song
with acoustic guitars.
   ``I don't want to make folk music,'' Harding said. ``All my
favorite songwriters do folk music, but they're all dead or dirt
poor. Phil Spector is my hero. I like Phil Spector. I like ABBA. I
actually liked the Carpenters. They were great songs.''
   Harding's now doing the dirty work of slowly trying to build an
audience in the United States, touring as an opening act for
artists such as Michelle Shocked and the Mighty Lemon Drops. He's
not working with a band now, but promises a band tour this fall.
   ``It's not the divine right of a support act to have everyone
like them,'' he said. ``If they find the idea of one man playing an
acoustic guitar horrible, then I let them get into the humor of
some things. I want to give them a chance to get into me.''
