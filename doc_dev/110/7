   Actress Sissy Spacek, after recording the
soundtrack to the 1980 movie ``Coal Miner's Daughter,'' handed
guitar player Harold Bradley a note.
   ``Pick them strings, guitar man. Loved working with you,'' it
said.
   Bradley did pick. And pick. And pick.
   In the city known worldwide for its guitar players, Bradley has
been the most productive. Chet Atkins is more famous, and Roy Clark
helped popularize the term ``picker,'' but Bradley has been more
prolific.
   In a career spanning 43 years, the 63-year-old Bradley has played
in literally thousands of recording sessions. No one in Nashville,
perhaps no one else anywhere, comes close to matching his output.
   ``My career sounds like a lie, but it's really happened,''
Bradley says calmly in a manner that belies the fervor with which he
plays.
   Twelve of the records on which he played with Elvis Presley
became million-sellers. Just a few of the other singers he's
accompanied include Willie Nelson, Marie Osmond, Roger Miller,
Loretta Lynn, John Davidson, Patsy Cline, Tom Jones, Buddy Holly,
the Everly Brothers, Hank Williams, Conway Twitty, Charley Pride and
Joan Baez.
   He's played on movie soundtracks such as ``Pink Cadillac'' and
``Smokey and the Bandit II'' in addition to ``Coal Miner's
Daughter.''
   A few of the songs on which he's played include ``Jingle Bell
Rock,'' ``Only the Lonely,'' ``Stand by Your Man,'' ``I'm Sorry,''
``King of the Road,'' ``It's Such a Pretty World Today'' and ``Make
the World Go Away.''
   For good measure, he played at the White House in 1978,
accompanying country music stars Tom T. Hall, Lynn and Twitty who
were invited by President Carter to provide some down-home
entertainment.
   This illustrious production came from a musician who taught
himself how to play at age 15 and still practices an average of a
couple hours a day. Even at age 45, he briefly took lessons in
classical music.
   ``I love it,'' he says as he approaches a half-century of
plucking the strings. ``I love to practice. You have to practice.
There is no end to being a good guitar player.
   ``It's like you've got this big jigsaw puzzle in front of you.
You put a few pieces in and you get an idea of the picture. Then you
realize there's more pieces on the outside so you keep trying to put
them in. And you realize you can never fill in the whole thing.''
   Bradley, who does not sing, has been enterprising as well as
busy. For sound effects, he once went to his car and got a pair of
tire chains, returned to the studio and dropped them to the floor
during the recording session for the song ``Chain Gang.''
   He has no preference among the various electric or acoustical
guitars, saying simply: ``I prefer what I'm playing at the time. I
like to play all of 'em.''
   An engaging man with volumes of scrapbooks and memorabilia about
his career, Bradley believes versatility has been his helpmate as
much as ability.
   ``I don't know that I am good. But I can offer experience. I've
been very lucky to play a wide variety of music: country, big band,
rock 'n' roll, gospel.
   ``If I played one kind, I wouldn't have been around this long. If
I was a rock 'n' roll specialist, they would not have needed me on
other recordings that required different abilities.''
   He also plays other instruments, joking that ``I play two in
self-defense, the banjo and mandolin.''
   He says his biggest thrills are those indescribable moments when
musicians combine for special sounds in the studio.
   ``When something magic happens, you get a tremendous high. You
can't turn creativity off and on like water. I've enjoyed that
several times with several artists where it was such a marvelous
music experience that you felt something great happened.''
   Bradley feels that he is still getting better except for his rock
'n' roll playing.
   ``To do that, you have to go out and play it,'' he said. ``And I
play a certain style, rockabilly style, pretty good. But to go out
and play like Van Halen and those guys, no, I'll never do that. But
he'll never come here and play the guitar, the bass guitar, the
banjo, the mandolin, the ukulele. So it's kind of a tradeoff.
   ``What you're buying if you buy me is experience and intonation
and ability. But even that can't guarantee a hit record. The public
decides that.''
