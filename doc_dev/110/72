   In a rare contemplative moment for
country music thunderbolt Hank Williams Jr., he paused in his west
Tennessee office and stared at the picture of his parents. He winked
at his mother, then fixed his admiring gaze on his dad.
   ``Well,'' he said to the large photo showing his famous father.
``It looks like I've got a new singing partner and you're No. 1
again.''
   Hank Williams Sr., a country music legend who died in 1953, and
Hank Williams Jr. are finally a duet. Through the magic of
technology, they sing together on the current song ``There's a Tear
in My Beer.''
   The previously unreleased song by the elder Williams was recently
discovered, improved technologically and vocals by his 39-year-old
son were added. The result is one of the most anticipated country
music releases in years.
   ``It's a wonderful feeling to be singing along with him _
something I never thought possible,'' Williams said in an interview.
``To me, you are looking at two rockabilly stars that finally got
together for one hot shot. It's just a very contented feeling.''
   That's an apt description of Williams' entire career these days.
He's country music's No. 1 act right now, having been voted
entertainer of the year two straight times by the Country Music
Association.
   He has a whopping five albums on the country music charts,
including his ``Greatest Hits, Vol. 1,'' which has sold 2 million
copies.
   His concerts _ 2{ hour marathons _ have set attendance records in
several cities. Agents have said he commands up to $100,000 per show.
   His music reveals him to be an enduring explorer singing blues,
hard-core country and rock 'n' roll. His concerts tingle with fury
as he charges around stage, singing his blue-collar anthems and
rapping with raucous fans who shout their salutes.
   His bold baritone celebrates the South with such songs as ``Dixie
on My Mind,'' ``If Heaven Ain't a Lot Like Dixie'' and ``If the
South Woulda Won.''
   But his music is not entirely provincial. His ``A Country Boy Can
Survive'' is about world tensions. ``Something to Believe In'' is
about the struggles of the common man.
   He performs his high-voltage music by playing an array of
instruments including guitar, banjo, fiddle, piano, steel guitar,
harmonica and drums.
   ``I write songs that most of my fans can relate to, about
everyday life,'' he said. ``I play six-seven instruments on stage,
and they know if you are enjoying what you are doing.''
   He's also had a turbo-charged lifestyle, having survived cocaine
use, suicide attempts and a 500-foot fall off a Montana mountain in
1975 that required a year of anguished recovery. His ever present
beard and sunglasses hide the stubborn scars. A spiffy cowboy hat
tops off his commanding 6-foot-2 frame which tapers to gleaming
cowboy boots.
   ``I don't sit around the penthouse and polish my nails,'' he said.
   Williams, who was just 3 when his father died, has recorded more
than 50 albums. At one point in 1982, he had an unprecedented nine
LPs on the country music charts.
   He made his first public performance at age 8 and was appearing
on the road not long thereafter. He is a high school dropout. This
year marks his 25th year as a recording artist.
   ``I'm proud of it,'' he said. ``The longevity has been good. It's
hard to imagine all the good things that have happened in (just) the
past eight years. And I aim high.''
   He inherited a famous name from his father, who in the early
1950s was country music's top star with hits including ``Your
Cheatin' Heart,'' ``I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry'' and ``Hey Good
Lookin'.''
   But it wasn't until this decade that the younger Williams decided
to carve his own style and not be a clone of his father.
   ``I just started doing what I wanted to do not that long ago,''
he said. ``All that before doesn't count in my book; I was just a
kid; it was do this, do that. I was not that enamored with the music
business then. It was all built in for me.''
   He has used music videos to good advantage, enlisting rock 'n'
roll stars Van Halen, comedians Cheech and Chong and pro football
stars among dozens of other celebrities who have appeared in them.
   ``I call 'em up and say this is Bocephus (his nickname). I say do
you want to do this thing. They say, `yes.' It amazes me,'' he said.
   He recently pondered what his father would say about his career.
   ``He'd say, `Boy, I knew you was going to do it all the time. I'm
so proud of you; you got out there and did it the way you wanted
to.' I think he would be pretty happy over it.''
