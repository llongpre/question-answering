   Rick Astley is attracting more attention with
his first album than he probably expected to have in a lifetime.
   It has been 20 years since England sent America anything like
Astley _ when Joe Cocker arrived sounding a lot like Ray Charles.
   Astley's RCA album, ``Whenever You Need Somebody,'' and the
first rhythm and blues sounding single from it, ``Never Gonna Give
You Up,'' have shot up the best-selling charts in Europe and then
followed the same pattern in the United States where the LP went
gold.
   Besides getting a superhit with a first record, Astley excites
interest because he's quite a surprise. His voice is super-soulful,
deeply resonating, mature-sounding _ and he's a 21-year-old English
lad with a diffident air, chestnut hair and freckles.
   ``There's so much that gets crammed in,'' Astley said during an
interview at RCA headquarters.
   ``Private life is one thing I don't get, basically, any more.
Today we're a little rushed and that seems to be the norm these
days. I don't see my family any more. I don't mean to moan about
it. I knew I was letting myself in for this. I realize little
things in life become suddenly important and you miss them.
   ``It's very nice traveling to all these countries. All the same,
at the end of the day, all the RCA offices look the same.''
   Astley was born in Newton-le-Willows, Lancashire, England _ not
far from Liverpool. Like many performers, he started as a teen-ager.
   ``I took up drums around 15,'' he said. ``I actually liked
drums. With friends, a guitarist and bass player, we got a band
together. One has gone to college now, studying computers. One is
married.
   ``It was a fun thing. The bassist was doing most of the writing.
We played anything that had three chords. We disbanded out of a
mutual agreement sort of thing.''
   Then Astley at 17 was asked by a band named FBI to be its
drummer. ``It was in the same little town,'' he said. ``Anybody who
can play an instrument; everybody seems to know about them. It was
an all-guitar band. Nobody could afford keyboards.
   ``I started to write most of the material about six months after
joining,'' he said, ``so I progressed on to be the singer as well.''
   The band's managers _ one of whom still manages Astley _ invited
Peter Waterman, who owns production and publishing companies, to a
performance. ``The band was still very young; I was one of the
oldest and I was 19,'' Astley said. ``He offered me a solo deal
which I ended up taking.'' FBI continues and Astley says they're
still friendly.
   ``I went to work for Pete for eight months or so. I was a tape
operator in a studio. It's computerized these days. I made tea a
few weeks until I saw how a studio works. Then I started recording
in December 1986, three songs. One was `Never Gonna Give You Up,'
the first single. I was writing like mad, doing demos weekends and
nights, learning whatever I could, getting to know everybody.''
   Later, Astley played guitar on one track of the album, ``No More
Looking for Love.''
   ``We did that at 2 or 3 in the morning,'' he said. ``Nobody was
around. The guy producing said, `You do it.' I always play on my
own demos. I said, `Fine. I can get by on this.'
   ``I'm not stupid enough not to know there are better musicians
than me. I'm not going to get into an ego trip when I play; time is
money in a studio. I'd like to do it when I get older.
   On ``Never Gonna Give You Up,'' Astley said a few notes are
high. ``It sounds as if it is low. I'm not saying that to be hip
and cool. I prefer to sing lower; it feels better and suits better.
   ``I think I've always had this sort of tone to my voice. A lot
of my favorite singers are black guys. In Britain, music by people
like Luther Vandross, James Ingram and Michael McDonald becomes
part of the Top 40. I like a white artist's voice with a soulful
approach.''
   PWL, which Waterman runs with Mike Stock and Matt Aitken, is
mainly known in the United States as the power behind Bananarama
and Samantha Fox.
   ``It is almost like a mini-Motown,'' Astley said. ``They
produce, write and arrange for so many people, some not big in
America but massive in England. They may have five singles they've
written and produced in the Top 20 on the British charts in one
week.
   ``They tend to have a very controlling role. Everybody says they
have a sound. I wondered what style they were going to use for me.
It was a little more musical than some of the stuff they'd done, a
return almost to the '70s, with string arrangements. I don't sound
like most of what they do.
   ``We've recorded `Ain't Too Proud to Beg' by the Temptations. I
sang it live in a few clubs in London. Everybody seems to think
it's the strongest thing I've done and that's my direction. It's
like rhythm, and me singing. It seems to show my vocal ability to
its best. I did it slower than the Temptations did it. My voice
suits slow; I think you can express yourself a little more.
   ``We were going to put it on the first album but didn't want to
put all the eggs in one basket,'' he said, ``and a lot of people
lately have released old Motown songs. I've got all these thoughts
buzzing around in my head. You've got only 10 songs to bring to
people.''
   The album includes five songs by Stock, Aitken and Waterman,
four by Astley and ``When I Fall in Love,'' the Nat ``King'' Cole
hit.
   ``I'm only 21,'' Astley said. ``As years go on, hopefully I'll
get into writing all of an album and producing some of it. It's
still early days for me.''
