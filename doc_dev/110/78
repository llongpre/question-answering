The fall season is always the most active time for pop record releases, as the 
music industry gears up for its November-December season, during which nearly a 
third of all records, tapes and CDs are sold. But that can mean confusion for 
even the most serious music fans, as old favorites compete with newcomers for 
consumers' attention.

 These are the albums expected to generate the most critical and commercial 
interest of all the post-Labor Day releases during the hectic year-end rush. 
The selections, presented in alphabetical order, cover all parts of the pop 
music spectrum, from heavy-metal fathers (Aerosmith) and sons (L.A. Guns) to 
rap innovators (the D.O.C., Young M.C.); from rock kings on the rebound (Bob 
Dylan, the Rolling Stones) and pop queens living the lush life (Linda Ronstadt, 
Barbra Streisand) to country chartbusters (Randy Travis) and folkie mavericks 
(Tracy Chapman, Michelle Shocked).

 The comments are by the Times pop writers indicated, but the star ratings (one 
is poor, five a classic) sometimes reflect additional pop staff input.

 The reviewers are Robert Hilburn, Dennis Hunt, Mike Boehm, Richard Cromelin, 
Jonathan Gold, Steve Hochman, Connie Johnson, Craig Lee, Kristine McKenna, 
Randy Lewis, Don Snowden, Chris Willman, Paul Grein, Duff Marlowe and Don 
Waller.

*** HIGHWAY 101, "Paint the Town,"Warner Bros. The band can boast Paulette 
Carlson's dusky, tremulous lead vocals, twangy, Buck-inspired electric guitars 
and singing pedal steel lines, wrapped around a solid batch of songs in which 
lovers depart, hearts break and the losers and winners both wind up at the 
local honky-tonk. (Lewis)

* OAK RIDGE BOYS, "American Dreams,"MCA. Had the original "Saturday Night Live" 
crew ever gotten around to a "Bad Country Music" skit, it couldn't have been 
any funnier -- or sadder -- than this is, albeit unintentionally. This 
compendium of cliches is as sincere as Joe Isuzu and as authentic as the 
synthesized accordion on an ersatz Cajun tune. (Lewis)

<P>
*** POCO, "Legacy,"RCA. Granted, this reunion isn't quite up there with a 
Beatles comeback, but that's a bonus in this case, since there aren't 
stratospherically high expectations of this seminal country-rock group's five 
original members. There are a few modest love songs by Richie Furay and Jim 
Messina, a stone-country waltz from ex-Eagle Randy Meisner and plenty of 
luscious harmonies from all concerned. (Lewis)
