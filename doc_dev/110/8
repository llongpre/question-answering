   Bob Geldof, musician, is back.
   Not St. Bob, the humanitarian of British tabloid headlines. Not
Sir Bob, knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1986, nominated for the
Nobel Peace Prize that same year. Not author Bob, who's already
written a best-selling autobiography, ``Is That It?'' And not
businessman Bob, who oversaw millions and millions of dollars in
contributions for the starving Third World.
   Geldof remains chairman of the board of trustees for Band Aid,
although he says the organization will cease to exist fairly soon.
But his main focus these days is ``The Vegetarians of Love,'' his
critically acclaimed second solo album.
   This is no Boomtown Rats rock 'n' roll extravaganza; Geldof has
instead assembled a mostly acoustic band featuring accordion,
violins, flute, tin whistle, mandolin and ukulele.
   ``For me, I suppose, it's simply a reaction to stuff I hear on
the radio which I don't like _ basically, house music and New Kids
on the Block or Kylie Minogue,'' Geldof said in a recent interview.
   For the new album, Geldof enlisted an old friend _ ex-Rats
bassist Pete Briquette _ and four traditional musicians he'd never
met. They recorded 28 songs in five days; any song that didn't
click after three takes was thrown out. Geldof improvised many of
the lyrics on the spot.
   ``I came in on Monday morning, said hello to four guys I didn't
know ... I'd bash out a song and say, `Right! OK, let's go,' ''
Geldof recalled of the session.
   ``They'd say, `What do you want me to play?' I'd say, `Whatever
you want to play.' They'd say, `Where do you want me to play it?'
I'd say, `Wherever you feel its right.' And `When does the song
finish?' And I'd say, `When it stops, it's over.' ''
   The spontaneity shows. On ``A Gospel Song,'' Geldof tells the
band ``middle eight coming up'' during an instrumental break.
Geldof asks at the start of another cut, ``Are we rolling?'' And at
the end of ``The Great Song of Indifference,'' the entire band is
heard laughing loudly.
   ``Indifference'' is already a Top 40 hit in Britain. ``The last
thing everybody expected was this Irish pub song. And it became a
big dance hit, you know? Thirteenth-century dance music,'' says
Geldof, laughing.
   After almost a decade as front man for the New Wave-era Boomtown
Rats, Geldof became a household name in 1984 _ by organizing the
cream of British musicians to record ``Do They Know It's
Christmas?'' and raise money for African famine victims.
   That was followed by USA for Africa's ``We Are the World'' and
the internationally televised Live Aid benefit. For two years,
Geldof met with heads of state and political power brokers; the
scruffy Irishman was photographed with everyone from Nobelist
Mother Theresa to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Geldof looks back on those days with pride tempered by the
realization there was only so much that could be done.
   ``I mean, I never said we were going to stop world poverty or
world hunger. I said it was a Band-Aid. `You don't put a Band-Aid
on a gaping wound,' if I remember, was the quote at the time,''
said Geldof.
   ``That wasn't the function, to stop world hunger. It was to
raise the issue to the top of the political agenda, and we did
that.''
   Geldof is still the nominal head of the organization: ``I'm the
chairman of the board of trustees, which requires me to go to a
meeting once every two months. In reality, the buck still stops
here.''
   But he says projects are winding down, and the end of Band Aid
could come in 1992.
   ``We have a million pounds left, which is contingency, which we
don't touch, in case there's an emergency or a shortfall on a
project,'' said Geldof. ``When all that's finished, about two
years, then we just close.''
   So Geldof is back with his first love, music. He's not sure if
``Vegetarians'' will be his long-awaited commercial breakthrough,
and he's aware that there's no immediate market for his songs on
U.S. radio.
   ``So what if it doesn't fit? It's still music,'' says Geldof.
``For every 3 million people who love Bon Jovi, there's a quarter
of a million who can't stand it. I'm not at all bitter. I'm sort of
philosophical.''
   The philosopher looks much the same as he did at Live Aid,
except for the bit of gray in his unruly mop of hair. Geldof
considers the music scene today, and he sees many of the same
things flourishing which led to the punk scene.
   ``I feel a real sort of betrayal now when I listen to the radio.
I understand that this is now a giant, monolithic industry, and I
understand so many millions of people depend on their livelihoods
for it, and they play it safe,'' said Geldof.
