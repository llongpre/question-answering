Are the Katydids going to be the next Big Thing in pop music? 
</P>
<P>
The British rock press certainly thinks so. They went into a tizzy over the 
London-based band's debut single, "Lights Out (Read My Lips)," which was 
released last month in England only. 
</P>
<P>
"Two minutes of crisp, heart-stopping brilliance," said the New Musical 
Express. "The Katydids are the kiss-and-tell cousins of the Beatles, the 
Monkees and R.E.M.," according to a review in Melody Maker. "They summon up 
memories of time-locked perfect pop with nostalgic, jangly clarity." 
</P>
<P>
The folks at Reprise Records think so, too. Confident that a U.S. conquest is 
in the stars, they're supporting next Tuesday's release of the Katydids' debut 
album, produced by pop avatar Nick Lowe, with one of the most intensive -- and 
expensive-promotional campaigns in the label's history. 
</P>
<P>
But what is expected to be the latest chapter in the ongoing saga of the 
British invasion, which began in the early 1960s with the Beatles, is also a 
homecoming of sorts for Susie Hug, the Katydids' lead singer and co-songwriter 
(with guitarist Adam Seymour). 
</P>
<P>
Though born in Tokyo, Hug, 30, spent most of her life in San Diego. She was 
raised in Linda Vista and attended Mark Twain Elementary School, Montgomery 
Junior High, Kearny High and UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But Hug was never a participant in the local original-music scene -- just an 
observer. In the early 1980s, she regularly hung out at the Spirit in Bay Park, 
watching such promising hopefuls as the Penetrators, Four Eyes, the Puppies and 
the Rick Elias Band. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to go see bands, but I wasn't doing music at all," Hug recalled in a 
telephone interview from New York City. "And while I remember thinking it would 
be great to be in a band, I never even thought, for a moment, that it would one 
day become a reality. 
</P>
<P>
"I was too busy with school, studying art and film. I used to write little 
tunes to go with the 16-millimeter films I made, but nothing to the extent I'm 
doing now, which completely took me by surprise." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed. Even after graduating from UCSD with a fine arts degree four years ago 
and moving to London to be closer to her parents, who live in Scotland, Hug 
said, she had no intentions of pursuing a career in music. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to get involved in movies some way. I started as a receptionist at a 
medical film company, hoping to get into editing, but it was pretty bad -- I 
couldn't handle films about hip operations, stuff like that. 
</P>
<P>
"After three months, I left and found a new job as film librarian with an 
advertising agency. It was better, but it still wasn't completely satisfying, 
so I started doing music as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought a guitar and taught myself some chords, just as something to do after 
I got off work and on weekends, and I liked it a lot more than being a film 
librarian." 
</P>
<P>
Before long, Hug recalled, she began singing and writing songs, and, in late 
1987, she did her first session, backing pop duo Big Bam Boo. 
</P>
<P>
"I had had no other experience, being in the studio before," she said, "and it 
was all guys -- I was the only girl." 
</P>
<P>
One of those "guys" was Adam Seymour, a fellow upstart singer, guitarist and 
songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
"We got to talking, and sort of as mutual encouragement, he said, 'Play me your 
stuff and I'll play you mine,' just to see what the other person was doing," 
Hug said. 
</P>
<P>
"It ended up, I really liked the songs he was writing, and he really liked the 
things I was doing. We discovered that we shared the same musical tastes, so we 
decided to get together after the session. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time we did, we each played some tapes and then wrote three songs 
together; they sounded great, so we thought, 'Let's write some more songs, demo 
'em up, and see what happens.' " 
</P>
<P>
What happened was a big-time management deal and a suggestion "that we put 
together a band so we could have real-life instruments play the stuff on our 
demo tape for which we'd used a drum machine, things like that," Hug said. 
</P>
<P>
Hug and Seymour promptly recruited "several musician friends we knew," she 
said, and ,in the summer of 1988, began gigging around the London club scene as 
the Katydids. The band wanted a bug name because one of their favorite groups 
had a bug name: the Beatles. 
</P>
<P>
"Initially, we played the real dives of London, hellish clubs with slime on the 
wall and maybe two people in the audience," Hug recalled. "But it was good, 
especially for me, because, even if nobody was there, we got experience playing 
live -- something I'd never done before." 
</P>
<P>
Within a year, the Katydids had recorded a band demonstration tape, which they 
submitted to "Demo Clash," a British radio show on which unsigned bands' demos 
are aired and voted on by listeners. 
</P>
<P>
After trouncing the competition for five straight weeks, Hug said, "they kicked 
us off, and from that point on, everything just sort of built up." 
</P>
<P>
The Katydids quickly became one of the top-drawing club bands in London. They 
hit the road, opening for Squeeze and Del Amitri, and, last August, signed a 
lucrative recording contract with Warner Brothers/Reprise Records. 
</P>
<P>
"They asked us who we wanted to produce our first album, and our first choice 
was Nick Lowe," Hug said. Lowe -- whose prior production credits include albums 
by Elvis Costello, Graham Parker, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Paul Carrack and 
the Damned -- "hadn't produced anything in a long time," Hug said, "and we had 
to explain to him that we weren't a typical British drum-machine or computer 
band. 
</P>
<P>
"We told him we wanted real instruments hit by real people, clear and pure, 
and, after we played him some songs on acoustic guitar, he said real modestly, 
'Um, if you're still interested, I'd like to produce you.' " 
</P>
<P>
"And we thought to ourselves, 'God, we don't think he realizes he's Nick Lowe 
-- he's got no ego at all.' "
