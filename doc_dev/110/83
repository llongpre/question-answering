Purists may quibble, but there is nothing inherently wrong with updating 
Shakespeare's "As You Like It" and setting it in New York City during the Great 
Depression. At least that is what this reviewer thought before seeing the Art 
Deco staging at Rancho Santiago College's Phillips Hall Theatre, where it is 
playing through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Why not turn the Forest of Arden into Central Park? Because, as happens in this 
production, a guy on a park bench says: "Come, shall we go and kill us 
venison?" Why not turn Oliver's orchard into Oliver's swank supper club? 
Because the bartender says: "Yonder comes my master." Why not turn Duke 
Frederick's palace lawn into Le Boutique? Because one fashionable deb shopping 
for dresses says to another: "I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry." 
</P>

With a cast of thousands (OK, dozens), this production is a great big dolled-up 
eyeful. The lengthy first act -- which is all this reviewer stayed for -- has 
mobsters in snap-brim fedoras and floozies in fringes, swells in white tie and 
tails and overgrown kids in knickers, the unemployed masses marching for jobs 
("Hire Me! I'll Do Anything!" says one sign) and society ladies in cloche hats 
and fox stoles. It even has Madison Square Garden in lights. 
</P>
<P>
But what a great big fat earache it gives you. Except for Rick Franklin as Duke 
Frederick (doubling as Duke Senior), Brent Hardwick as Jaques ("All the world's 
a stage") and Curtis Rhodes as Amiens (singing and playing the ukulele), the 
largely student cast cannot handle Shakespeare's language. And, given the 
ludicrous incongruities of the staging, the actors sound even worse than they 
might have had the play been done straightforwardly. 
</P>

Had anyone bothered to make dramatic sense of the transposition from 
Elizabethan to Depression times, Shakespeare's comedy might have worked. (OK, 
barely.) But as it is, you can't help wondering why the director didn't just 
mount a screwball satire from the '30s. Everybody could have dressed to kill 
and made sense too.
