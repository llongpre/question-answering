   Keith Richards and Mick Jagger were like wedded
jewels in the rock world, two diamonds in the rough who made the
Rolling Stones shimmer for almost three decades.
   Now that union has become a little jagged at the edge: A feud
between the guitarist and the lead singer has left the legendary
group's future in doubt.
   Over the past two years, Jagger has pursued a solo career.
Richards has just come out with his first solo LP, ``Talk Is
Cheap,'' and will give his first solo concert Nov. 29 at the Beacon
Theater in New York.
   ``I tell him he's blowing 20-odd years of integrity of the
Stones because he's got a problem,'' the 43-year-old Richards said
in an interview at his Manhattan office, where pictures of the rock
star line the walls.
   ``I ask him, `What's your problem. What's so tough about being
Mick Jagger?' Suddenly you got to complete and be fashionable. The
Stones don't need that. I love the guy and I love to work with him
but I don't understand this star trip he's on.''
   On his new album Richards has a song especially for his longtime
friend, ``You Don't Move Me.'' It begins like the Stones' ``Honky
Tonk Woman,'' with guitar and drums.
   The lyrics say: ``What makes you so greedy? What makes you so
seedy? Why do you think you got no friends? You drove them all
around the bend.''
   ``The melody and the beat came about like they usually do,''
Richards said. ``Songs come to you; you don't make them. They
decide that they're going to visit for a while.''
   Richards said he wrote the song about Jagger on the advice of
drummer Steve Jordan, who co-produced the LP.
   ``At the time I was going to write it, I just dried up. It was
frustrating me,'' he said.
   ``Steve said to me, `When in doubt, write about Mick.' He's hurt
me a lot and I just had to get it out. It's not entirely about
Mick. It's about anybody that gets disappointed about a friend and
has to let it out. It's a weird mixture of roughness and melody.''
   Richards played ``You Don't Move Me'' for Jagger, who he said
talked all the way through it. But Richards thinks the song will
eventually sink in.
   ``After these interviews, he's probably going to go to a room
and listen to it. He'll make this a mirror for him instead of just
having a mirror for him to look into.''
   Jagger and Richards have known each for nearly 40 years, living
in the same British neighborhood of Dartford for a while as
children, and forming a lasting friendship as teen-agers based on
their mutual interest in blues and rock 'n' roll.
   As Richards tells it, they met on a train around 1960 with
Jagger carrying a pile of blues albums under his arm. Richards was
already playing guitar and Jagger was doing some singing, so they
promptly began rehearsing together.
   They met up with another guitarist, Brian Jones, and shared a
flat in London, starving as Richards recalls, and playing music.
They auditioned for a bassist and decided on Bill Wyman, chosen at
the time more for the large amplifier he owned than for his playing.
   Drummer Charlie Watts, who had played with Jagger in a blues
group, joined the Stones in 1963.
   The Stones began, in Richards' words, as ``young missionaries,''
determined to bring blues music to a mass audience. Their name was
taken from a Muddy Waters song and much of their early material
were covers of blues and soul classics.
   In 1965, ``The Last Time,'' became their first self-written
single to reach the Top 10. Then came, ``Satisfaction,'' No. 1 in
England and the United States and still the Stones' most famous
song.
   They had the best of both worlds for a while. Critics loved the
Stones, naming them ``The World's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band.''
The fans loved them, not just for their music, but their
belligerent attitude.
   That attitude came at a price. In 1967, Jagger and Richards were
arrested for drugs and briefly jailed. Although the charges were
minor, Jagger for possession of four amphetamine tablets and
Richards for allowing marijuana to be used on his premises, both
were given lengthy sentences and the group's future was in doubt.
   After a public outcry, they were released and the Stones bounced
back in 1968 with the single ``Jumpin' Jack Flash,'' and the album
``Beggar's Banquet.''
   Jones, however, was suffering from the strain of repeated drug
busts and losing his girlfriend, Anita Pallenberg, to Richards. He
made only a minor contribution to ``Beggar's Banquet,'' and in June
of 1969, announced he was leaving the Stones because of ``musical''
differences. He was found dead in his swimming pool a month later.
