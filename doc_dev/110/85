<LEADPARA>  Saturday was a gorgeous day, sunshine and blue skies and high mercury
readings. The whole bit. Close to 700 Bay Area teen-agers, though, didn't mind
working. They volunteered to help out at food banks, homeless shelters, parks,
child care centers and hospitals on Bay Area Youth Service Day, organized by a
group called Strive for Five.;    The goal was to get kids hooked on
volunteerism early, organizers said. Strive for Five gets its name from trying
to get people to volunteer five hours a week and 5 percent of their income,
said program coordinator Carmelita Tursi. About 75 students from East Palo
Alto and Palo Alto showed up at the Ventura Infant/Toddler Center in Palo
Alto. The youngsters helped fill the sandboxes with 25 tons of sand, said
Ventura acting director Kim Moore. They painted four classrooms, rebuilt a
sandbox, made a picnic table and built a deck. Not bad for a day's work, and
the center's 44 toddlers and 28 preschoolers could use it.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Ventura staffers wanted to lend a hand, but "they wouldn't let us do
anything," Moore said. "They wouldn't even let me clean the paintbrushes.";   
The turnout at the Samaritan House was not quite as high as expected. About
100 signed up, but only 35 students showed. Still, the volunteers managed to
finish the things they set out to do, said Perry Schuckman of the family
shelter in San Mateo. The students cleaned and prepared the kitchen for
painting, sorted thousands of items of clothing, reorganized and stocked the
food pantry, and solicited for food at Safeway.;    Twenty students also
signed up to come back to help the shelter at a later date. Just what the
organizers had in mind.;   GOING, GONE: Talk about environmental crime. Folks
at the Peninsula Conservation Center came back to work on Monday and
discovered that their two garbage bins were gone, replaced by a couple of
cardboard boxes. The 32-gallon containers were used to store cans and bottles
for recycling. They were set outside the office, next to the magazine
recycling bin. "We had just bought these not too long ago," said center
director Debbie Mytels.;    The two plastic containers cost about $20 each, or
the price of two memberships at the environmental center, Mytels said. "Maybe
someone will read it and feel guilty. . . . ";    Or if you have a couple of
spare containers lying around, call (415) 494-9301.;  GONE FISHIN': Ellen
Klein brought a little bit of culture back with her from the Hawaiian Islands.
The coordinator of the Senior Center in Mountain View lived there for four
years. She even hula-danced for the tourists. Since she's been on the
Peninsula, Mother's Day at the Senior Center has been a luau. This Mother's
Day, the Hula Halau O Pi'ilani hula dance troupe will perform to ukulele music
while partyers sip "islandlike" refreshments.;    Moms, of course, get in
free. All others pay $1 at the door. The event starts at 1 p.m. on May 12 at
the Senior Center, 266 Escuela Ave. Call (415) 903-6330.  </TEXT>
