   Last winter, Ryuichi Sakamoto turned on the TV
in his Los Angeles hotel room and heard some familiar music.
   Fascinating, he thought _ the orchestration, the
instrumentation, how the French horns used high octave violin
phrases.
   It was the theme from ``Bonanza.''
   ``I'm always looking for something which can inspire me,'' said
Sakamoto, who composed the Academy Award-winning soundtrack to the
``The Last Emperor'' and has released a new album, ``Beauty.''
   ``When I listen to any music, I automatically see musical notes
and instruments. In films, just one tone, a sound could mean a
lot,'' he said.
   ``Bonanza'' inspired Sakamoto to purchase a compilation of
themes from westerns, which played softly in the background during
a recent interview at a Manhattan hotel. He came to New York well
prepared for any unexpected musical adventure. On the dresser by
his bed sat a compact disc player, a digital audio tape machine and
tapes of everything from reggae to jazz.
   Nicknamed ``Professor'' in college, Sakamoto is like a sonic
Henry Higgins, able to tell the difference between Hong Kong and
Moscow by the pitch of car horns. Born in Tokyo in 1952, he was
just 10 when he began studying music composition at the University
of Art of Tokyo.
   But Sakamoto is a proudly self-trained listener, recalling his
daily commutes to high school.
   ``I paid attention to every noise on the train and counted every
different noise. Spins, boxes crashing, people talking, cable
wires,'' said Sakamto, who identified each sound with an uncanny
imitation.
   ``Echoes of cities are different. The first time I went to
London, I was kind of surprised. I flew from Tokyo to London and
the echoes the cities had were very different,'' said the composer,
whose debut album, ``Thousand Knives,'' was released in 1978.
   ``In London, the buildings were made out of stones. The steps
sounded very different to me, very hypnotic.''
   Sakamoto admits, however, that keeping his ears pinned to
grindstone left him tone-deaf to people. Soft-spoken and shy, he
simply preferred listening to talking, sounds over words. The
turning point, he said, came in 1987 when he worked with director
Bernardo Bertolucci on ``The Last Emperor.''
   ``It was quite tricky, because my music's kind of depressed and
flat on the surface. Bertolucci forced me to write more and more
emotional music. He kept saying, `More emotional.' It was very
difficult,'' Sakamoto said.
   ``Before `The Last Emperor,' I was kind of afraid to let people
into my music. I could hardly communicate with people. But after
the experience of `The Last Emperor,' I easily could communicate
with people. I was surprised.
   So Sakamoto calls ``Beauty'' his most idealistic record, a
former loner's attempt to embrace the world to the beat of world
music, the composer's own mixture of dance rhythms and Japanese
folk.
   ``Each day, I would say, `I need an African percussion player. I
need an African guitarist. I need a Korean guitar player. I need a
Chinese musician.' I had so many different nusicians from all over
the world, and communication was so important for recording with
them. Maybe three years ago I couldn't do that.''
   Sakamoto has also worked with rock 'n' rollers. He appeared in
the 1983 film, ``Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence,'' which starred
David Bowie, and two years later collaborated with Thomas Dolby on
the album ``Field Work.''
   On ``Beauty,'' he applies his personal touch to the Rolling
Stones' ``We Love You.'' The original was released in 1967, right
after Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had been jailed briefly on
drug charges. With John Lennon and Paul McCartney singing backup,
the song was a cynical take on the Summer of Love, complete with
the sound of cell doors slamming.
   But ``We Love You'' was no joke to Sakamoto, who in 1967 was
politically active and listening to the experimental music of John
Cage. The composer got rid of the studio effects and turned the
song into a friendly handshake _ offered, of course, via
state-of-the-art technology.
   ``I wanted to have a song which was for people who I have never
met,'' he said. ``I wanted to introduce myself to people who were
not just music fans, but all young people. Like ordinary people in
the United States, people in Romania. I want them to listen to my
music.''
