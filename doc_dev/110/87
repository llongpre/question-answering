Curtis Stone had a double case of the jitters last Monday night in Nashville -- 
one for himself and one for his dad. 
</P>
<P>
It was awards night for the Nashville-based Country Music Assn., the annual 
televised ceremonies in which the kudos-conscious country music business 
distributes degrees of honor and prestige among its top-echelon acts. 
</P>
<P>
Stone says he was edgy, and a bit doubtful, about the prospects that his band, 
Highway 101, would be voted country music's top group for the second straight 
year. But, speaking over the phone from Nashville last week, the Highway 101 
bassist said he was even more nervous about what would happen with his father. 
</P>
<P>
Cliffie Stone, a longtime presence on the Southern California country scene as 
a musician, radio and television host and song publisher, was being considered 
for election to the Country Music Hall of Fame, vying against four other 
nominees in the Hall's non-performing category. 
</P>
<P>
The Group of the Year award came first, and Highway 101, which plays tonight 
and Tuesday at the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana , won it again over a 
field that included the Desert Rose Band, Shenandoah, Restless Heart and 
Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Stone was returning to his seat after a photo and interview session 
outside the hall when he heard the Hall-of-Fame presentation being announced 
with the usual biographical preamble. 
</P>
<P>
"(The announcer) was talking about this guy who did 14,000 television shows and 
25,000 radio shows. I said, 'I guess dad didn't get it.' I had no idea he had 
done that many." 
</P>
<P>
Speaking two days after the awards night, Stone said he still hadn't had a 
proper chance, amid all the awards-week bustle, to give his father proper 
congratulations on his Hall of Fame honor. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't really been able to sit down and express how proud I am of him, but 
he knows that." 
</P>
<P>
Cliffie Stone, who grew up in Burbank, started playing stand-up bass on the 
radio in 1932. He became emcee of his own Southland shows: "Wake Up Ranch" on 
radio, then "Hometown Jamboree," a country music television program that aired 
on KTLA from 1950 to 1961. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Cliffie wasn't the first musical Stone. 
</P>
<P>
"My grandfather played bass and was a world champion banjo player for five 
years in a row," Curtis Stone said. "He was the comic relief of my dad's show. 
He went by the name Herman Hermit. He looked like a hobo, with real long hair 
and a real long beard. In the '50s, that was pretty rad. He would make musical 
instruments out of car bumpers and vacuum cleaners." 
</P>
<P>
Cliffie Stone, now 72, taught his son his first guitar chords, but Curtis says 
that while his father always offered guidance, he didn't try to push him into 
any musical line. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a lot of rock in high school. Then my dad said, 'I've got a job for 
you. I can put you together with this girl who is going to go out and play 
rodeos.' He said that in country music, you'll always be able to work for a 
long, long time, but the rock thing might only last a year." 
</P>
<P>
Given his origins, it is natural enough that the younger Stone, 39, would wind 
up with a high-profile spot in country music. But his band's origins are not 
quite so organic. Highway 101 is not a group of old comrades who slogged their 
way up through the bars and honky-tonks. Instead, it was the creation of a 
Colorado-based music business manager, Chuck Morris, who had the concept for 
the group before there was a group. 
</P>
<P>
"He had this idea of putting together a country band with a girl singer," Stone 
said. Morris, who also manages the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the Desert Rose Band 
and Leo Kottke, found his singer, Paulette Carlson, via an unsolicited tape. 
Carlson, originally from Minnesota, had tried to establish herself as a solo 
performer in Nashville during the early 1980s, but without much success. 
</P>
<P>
Morris teamed Carlson with veteran drummer Scott (Cactus) Moser. Stone says he 
entered the picture because Jerry Cariaga, a songwriting partner of his, knew 
Carlson and put in a strong word of recommendation. After the three had 
auditioned several other musicians, Stone brought in guitarist Jack Daniels, an 
old performing buddy from California. 
</P>
<P>
Highway 101's first release, a pop-flavored single for Warner Bros., turned out 
to be a commercial flop. "They said 'We'll release another song, and if that 
doesn't work, you're dead,' " Stone said. "We decided to add a steel guitar and 
be more country. That's kind of what made the difference." Recording with a 
more traditional approach, Highway 101 came up with "The Bed You Made for Me," 
an autobiographical song that Carlson had written about being betrayed by a 
former flame. 
</P>
<P>
With Highway 101 barely rolling up the on-ramp of success (at that point, it 
existed only as a studio band), Stone said he began thinking about finishing 
his college degree and finding a more reliable means of support as an English 
teacher or music instructor. But that changed when "The Bed You Made for Me" 
became a hit in the spring of 1987, rising to No. 4 on the Billboard country 
chart. Since then, Highway 101 has cruised along nicely, notching seven more 
Top 10 country singles (including three No. 1 hits -- "Cry, Cry, Cry," 
"Somewhere Tonight," and "(Do You Love Me) Just Say Yes") and back-to-back 
group-of-the-year awards from both of country music's major industry groups, 
the Country Music Assn. and the Los Angeles-based Academy of Country Music. 
</P>
<P>
The band has just released its third and most traditional-sounding album, 
"Paint the Town." While honky-tonk predominates, the album still shows glimmers 
of the country-rock side of the band's personality. Thematically, "Paint the 
Town" offers a steady diet of heartbreak, although not of the soppy, 
tears-in-your-beer variety. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'Let's take a chance and do a lovelorn album,' " Stone said. "But 
there are no victims on the album. We're conscious of having (Carlson) come 
across as stronger than that. The (theme of) the first album was a woman not 
being a victim in love, taking a strong stance" -- a role that Carlson plays 
well by moving from classic country catch-in-the-throat hurt to a brassier, 
more insistent persona. 
</P>
<P>
Stone says that Highway 101 was too hurried on its 1988 album, "2," to consider 
the sort of thematic and stylistic unities that crop up on "Paint the Town." 
Group members had written or co-written four of the 10 songs on the band's 
first album -- a respectable creative showing in country music, where 
performers commonly rely on outside songwriters for material. On "2," all of 
the songs came from outside the band, except for one tune co-written by 
Carlson. Stone says the band's touring schedule hadn't allowed the members time 
to write. 
</P>
<P>
For "Paint the Town," he said, "we took time out to write and rehearse. Between 
the four of us, we wrote 20 songs for this record, of which two made the album. 
I can safely say it's a little disappointing for all of us when we don't get 
particular songs we believe in on the record. But the bottom line is the final 
product. Everything is a little disappointing for about 10 minutes when the 
final decision is made." (Stone says song selections are made by a vote of 
Highway 101's members, its two producers, its management and its record 
company.) "Then the disappointment is over, and it's 'Let's get on, and for the 
next album let's have all original songs.' But they're going to have to hold up 
and fit in." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the strongest originals axed from "Paint the Town" might have tilted 
the album too far toward Highway 101's rocking side, Stone said, and not 
blended well with the record's traditional emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be very easy for us to go one way or another, to go out and be real 
straight-ahead rock, or straight-ahead country," he said. "But the band was 
cognizant of not doing anything outside of what we do. The third album is 
critical -- it could make or break us." 
</P>
<P>
The immediate goal, Stone said, is for Highway 101 to move up from its status 
as a show-opener for some of country's biggest names and begin headlining the 
larger theaters on its own. But that push will have to wait until next year. 
After a few more dates, the band is going to stay off the highway for a while. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a rough time to take off with the album just coming out. But we haven't 
really been off in three years," said Stone, who lives in San Diego with his 
wife, a law student. "This will be our first real break. Paula's getting 
married (to an Alaskan developer), and she wants to take off, and the rest of 
us just want to get home. I'm going to take my dogs to the beach and probably 
write some songs."
