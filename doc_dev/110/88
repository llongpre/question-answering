   In the first phase of her career, Carlene
Carter was caught in a deadening trap _ too rock 'n' roll for
country radio stations, and too country for rock listeners.
   This daughter of one of country music's most famous families
leaves no doubt where she stands now in her first album in seven
years.
   She brought in Heartbreaker Howie Epstein, retro-rocker Dave
Edmunds and former Band member Levon Helm to help her record _ an
album as country as her Tennessee home.
   ``I just did what came naturally and felt right to me and it
came out more country,'' said the 34-year-old Carter. ``I guess
I've just evolved as a writer and a performer a lot more and have
gotten a little older and wiser.''
   For anyone familiar with Carter's rocking side, the new ``I Fell
in Love'' comes as a bit of a shock. Fiddles and steel guitars
abound, and Carter doesn't hide her Tennessee accent on lines such
as, ``You burned me up like a chicken in a barbecue.''
   Carter was more of a stranger to the country crowd during the
late 1970s and early '80s. The daughter of June Carter Cash and
stepdaughter of Johnny Cash moved to London for eight years,
married English rock star Nick Lowe and ``was pretty wild and
crazy,'' she said.
   Her wedding to Lowe was immortalized in the video to Lowe's hit,
``Cruel to Be Kind'' and can still occasionally be seen on
late-night MTV. No video chronicled the divorce, however.
   Carter recorded five albums but none made her a star. ``Musical
Shapes,'' with Carter backed by her husband's former band,
Rockpile, was a favorite to the few who heard it and presaged
country music's more extensive flirtations with rock 'n' roll.
   But with the 1983 release of ``C'est Ce Bon,'' a
synthesizer-tinged album that even Carter disparages now, her
recording career went on hiatus. She turned briefly to musical
theater, performing in the London production of ``Pump Boys and
Dinettes.''
   ``I took a little time off and said I can't just make another
album without really knowing what I wanted to do,'' she said. ``You
can only get away with that for so long.''
   It was a phone call from her mother that changed her career.
   June Carter Cash and two of Carlene's aunts were performing in
London as the Carter family. One night, Carlene recalled, her Aunt
Anita took sick and the Carters needed an emergency fill-in. At
first, Carlene protested she didn't know the songs, but then did
her family duty.
   She loved it. The songs she thought she didn't know were burned
into her memory from family singalongs. Carlene, who learned how to
play guitar and poker from her grandmother, Maybelle, soon found
herself touring as a backup singer in the Carter family band.
   ``It's something I never thought I would want to do after having
been a rebel for so long,'' she said. ``I didn't think I would want
to go back and be in a group with my mom. But it was fun singing
with them and fun remembering what it was like laughing and being a
kid.''
   She helped the Carter Family record an album, then turned to her
own career.
   She has nothing but praise for Epstein, who took a holiday from
Tom Petty's backup group to produce Carter.
   ``It was really his first album as a producer and I felt it was
my first album as a serious participant,'' she said.
   On past albums, she said, ``I had my mind on so many other
things I didn't really take a lot of time. My thought processes
were often scattered, and it came across on record sometimes. This
time I'm real focused and I think that comes across, too.''
   Carter plunders her own background for songs. Cuts on the new
album include the Carter Family's ``Dixie Darling,'' ``You Are the
One,'' a hit for her father, Carl Smith, and ``Easy From Now On,''
one of the first songs Carter ever wrote that was once featured on
an Emmylou Harris record.
   Carter has no regrets about her rock 'n' roll days and doesn't
feel they discredited her family tradition.
   ``I was doing something that I believed was right at the time,''
she said. ``There's nothing written in stone that if you do one
kind of music one day that you can't do another kind of music
another day. I was experimenting. I was doing what they had taught
me growing up to do _ to be yourself and to be comfortable with
yourself.''
   Her marriage to Lowe over, Carter has moved into the house in
which she grew up in Madison, Tenn.
   The woman who once couldn't turn down a party invitation crawls
into her pajamas at 11 p.m. and gets ``real excited when I see they
have Spectravision in my hotel room.''
   She's rehearsing with a new band for a touring show that will
draw heavily from ``Musical Shapes'' and ``I Fell in Love.''
   ``I'm country through and through but some people might think
it's more rock 'n' roll,'' she said. ``I really don't care what
they think.''
