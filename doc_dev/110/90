As the only all-female country band signed to a major label, Wild Rose has a 
handy hook to grab media interest. But that hook must also seem a thorn at 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the attention the group gets focuses on the rarity of five women 
playing country music; other reports take the "they-play-real-good-for-girls" 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
But the simple fact is, there are few bands of any chromosomal predisposition 
in country today that Wild Rose couldn't smoke with their own pipes. 
</P>
<P>
In its early show at the Crazy Horse on Monday, the quintet showed it belongs 
among that select group of younger performers that is keeping country's 
musicianship and passion alive. With most of its members strongly grounded in 
bluegrass, the band seemed somewhat akin to the recently disbanded New Grass 
Revival in its musical ability and abandon. And it didn't take a horticulturist 
to see that Wild Rose and the Desert Rose Band belong to the same genus of 
singular, honest craftsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
The group is led by Wanda Vick, who is a true wonder on guitar, fiddle, dobro 
and pedal steel. The front-line singing is provided by Pamela Gadd and Pam 
Perry, either of whom could easily get by on singing alone. But Gadd also is 
formidable on guitar and banjo, while Perry plays an inspired mandolin. Both 
previously played with the bluegrass New Coon Creek Girls. The group is ably 
completed by bassist Kathy Mac and drummer Nancy Given Prout. 
</P>
<P>
The group's instrumental chops were put to the test on the Western 
swing-inflected "Go Down Swingin,' " given a lyrical jazz violin solo by Vick, 
with its second half impeccably doubled by Gadd's guitar. The band's signature 
"Wild Rose" breakneck instrumental found the members hurtling across musical 
borders, mixing bluegrass with progressive jazz. 
</P>
<P>
For all the instrumental rampage the outfit unleashed on such showcase numbers, 
the five also nimbly reined those wild talents to serve their songs, drawn from 
their debut "Breaking New Ground" album from early this year and the 
forthcoming "Straight and Narrow" album. 
</P>
<P>
The Perry-penned "Teach Me How to Say Goodbye" and Paul Kramer's "Where Did We 
Go Wrong?" were each given an emotional ballad treatment, with Vick's 
atmospheric pedal steel setting the mood for the latter. Her fiddle bow dipped 
into some Cajun spices for "On the Bayou." The new single "Everything He 
Touches (Turns to Gold)" was as celebratory and ebullient a bit of country rock 
as has ever appeared on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
Wild Rose's only debit is that not all the material is as worthy of the band's 
talents. A pair of Skip Ewing songs from the new album, "Can't You Just Stay 
Gone" and "Rock-a-Bye Heart," were slick constructions on which the band seemed 
unable to get an emotional foothold. 
</P>
<P>
The band probably could have benefited from a more dramatically structured set 
-- when the musicians finished, there was the impression of having just seen a 
bunch of songs rather than a complete "show." But there was a beneficial 
trade-off: The easygoing stage manner seemed delightfully unaffected, a rarity 
amid country's typical show-biz gloss. And one had to love the band's cornball 
humor, such as Gadd remarking, "Your hair looks really good tonight, Wanda -- 
especially on your legs."
