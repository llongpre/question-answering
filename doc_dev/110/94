<TEXT>     Rundgren did what he has been doing for more than 20 years: He continually
found ways to surprise his audience. He's done hard rock albums, a cappella
songs, solo computer performances, loony tunes like "I Want to Bang on the
Drum All Day" and soulful pop.;    He put a bit of each into his
two-and-a-half-hour set.;    Most of the show was drawn from his most recent
albums, "2nd Wind" and "Nearly Human," both filled with songs that aren't easy
to categorize. Like the opening number, "Love Science," they combined catchy
melodies and thoughtful lyrics with gear-wrenching shifts in tempo. They were
at once singable, danceable and had more twists and turns than a road down the
back side of the Sierra.;    He pulled out radio chestnuts such as "Real Man"
and "Hello It's Me" and balanced them with newer songs, "Love of a Common
Man," "Can't Stop Running" "Unloved Children" and "Change Myself.";    He had
the 10-member band step away from the instruments and try "Johnny Jingo" and
"Mighty Love" a cappella. His voice ran a bit lower during these, sort of
sounding like Billy Joel, if Billy could ever muster this much soul.;    Then
it was back to a more symphonic sound for "The Smell of Money," written for
the musical "Up Against It" and sounding like something from "Les
Miserables.";    The changes worked, buoyed by the his band's exuberance and
talent. Besides the core of guitar and bass and two female singers, he had two
keyboard players, a horn player and a wind player, a conga player and former
Tubes drummer "Prairie Prince.";    Sometimes Rundgren would pick up a baton,
a la Zappa, and conduct the band like an orchestra. Other times, he picked up
his guitar and jammed. The songs were richly layered: maracas here; a muted
trumpet or clarinet there, and that doo-wop soul bass below.;    He was most
surprising when he grabbed a microphone and crooned. I'd never really thought
of Rundgren as a singer -- but he hit a falsetto like Darryl Hall's, only with
more fire and depth. On this night, he was the best white soul singer I'd ever
heard.;    As if to underscore that, he did a serious version of Marvin Gaye's
"What's Going On." This Philadelphia native was claiming the soul singing
title from Hall, like Rocky ascending the steps.;    This was one of those
rare shows where each time I thought he'd hit his peak, he did something
better.;    Rundgren also had a genuine rapport with his audience, many of
whom see him every time he performs. He talked to them as if they were in his
living room watching a rehearsal.;    At one point he apologized for bad
acoustics at his last Palo Alto show and later, spying a young kid standing
near a speaker, he stopped and asked one of his singers for a pair of earplugs
for the kid.;    "I smell a lawsuit," he said.;    Most of the show was more
serious, dealing with love and war, with lyrics such as "How can I change the
world, when I can't change myself.";    For an encore, he threw out a
screwball for a laugh. Alone on acoustic guitar, he started what sounded like
a romantic ballad. But as he ended the chorus, it took a twist: "I want to
blank you, Jesse Helms." Only, he didn't say blank. He sang other choruses for
Tipper Gore, for the pope and a timely addition for Daryl Gates.  </TEXT>
