<LEADPARA>  CALL it cosmic coincidence, but while listening to the Roches Sunday night at
Great American Music Hall, I was wondering if the trio had grown up singing in
a church choir.;    Then, as if in answer, the Angels of Angst put down their
instruments, reverently approached the microphones and began Handel's
"Hallelujah Chorus" in lovely three-part harmony.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Music Review;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 7/10/91, pg. 2D);  The
Roches show scheduled for Thursday at One Step Beyond in Santa Clara has been
canceled. And, because of an editor's error, an incorrect address and phone
number was provided for the Catalyst in Tuesday's review of the Roches. The
address is 1011 Pacific Ave., Santa Cruz, (408) 423-1336. The Roches play
there July 16.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     But what really caught me by surprise was that they played it straight.
Because a Roches song almost never goes where you think it will.;    My
relatively low threshold for chronic quirkiness definitely put me in the
audience's minority that night.;    The Roches -- Maggie, Terri and Suzzy (it
rhymes with "fuzzy") have made a career out of wry, idiosyncratic songs that
usually dissect unhealthy relationships or human absurdness. Sung with voices
so sweet, they make the group seem only that much more vulnerable.;    Rapt
reception;  But there was no question they were the ones in control Sunday
night, holding the standing-room-only crowd rapt for a characteristically
offbeat hour-and-45-minute set.;    Suzzy, whose lead vocals sound a bit like
Nanci Griffith without the Texas twang, plays the ditsy, neurotic sibling.
"I've changed a lot since you saw me last," she pointed out halfway through
the show. "I've gotten myself together. I fit in now." No one believed her for
a moment.;    Older sister Maggie "is the poet"; she writes many of the trio's
lyrics. Terri, whose childlike soprano sounds somewhat like Suzanne Vega, is
the blond free spirit with the big green eyes.;    Together, they are a
charming blend of innocence, cynicism and wit. And the audience Sunday was an
eager voyeur to their therapy session set to music.;    Voices carry it;  They
all play guitar, and Maggie plays keyboards as well, but their instruments are
almost incidental. With voices like theirs, they don't need much assistance.; 
  Besides recent songs such as "The Anti-Sex Backlash of the '80s" and
"Everyone Is Good" (don't let the altruistic title fool you) from their 1989
album "Speak," they performed several new songs, such as "You're the Two That
I Want" ("Between the two of you I have my hands full/ I got one to push and
the other to pull").;    And of course, "Going Away to Ireland" and "Hammond"
from their debut album, "The Roches," the album that earned them their
cult-like following more than a decade ago.;    Cult-like because there's no
arguing but that they have their loyal fans. But to me, the quirkiness begins
to sound gimmicky and, after a while, rather one-dimensional. Kind of like
listening to two hours of a Windham Hill guitarist.;    Flash of
conventionality;  So when, for the encore, they brought a man identified only
as "David" onstage to join in the Elton John song "Daniel," it was for me a
welcome change of tone. It wasn't weird -- and you could follow it!;    But so
as not to wander too far out of character, they showed "David" the steps and
then closed with "Married Men," another favorite from their first album. And
the crowd loved it. Which just goes to show, a good therapist would be the
worst thing for their career.; The Roches; When: July 11; Where: One Step
Beyond, 1400 Marin Ave., Santa Clara; Tickets: $14-$16.50; Call: (408)
