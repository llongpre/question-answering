<TEXT>  DIRE STRAITS; "On Every Street"; (Warner Brothers; CD, cassette);
(star)(star)(star); Even though it's been more than six years since Mark
Knopfler's last Dire Straits release, this new effort picks up where "Brothers
in Arms" left off. That disc started perky, with songs like "Money for
Nothing," but ended with a string of softer, mellower songs, including the
title track.;   This time Knopfler resumes in the softer vein. Knopfler's
playing is excellent as always and he continues to put a lot of value on the
quality of the digital recording -- something that made the last disc one of
the most popular CDs ever.;   "Fade to Black" is a blues number in the
tradition of B.B. King. "My Parties" has Knopfler's voice and two saxes as the
lead instruments. "Calling Elvis," the first single, is a hypnotic study of
building anticipation. "Heavy Fuel" is the hardest rocker on the album, but
sounds irritatingly close to "Money for Nothing.";   These songs lack the fire
and the irony that made the last album a classic. There are no hits like "Walk
of Life" or "Money for Nothing" -- not that Knopfler has to put out hits to be
great. But the album could have used some stronger melodies to augment his
playing.;   The thing about Knopfler is, practically everything he does
becomes a classic. And if you are a fan, you never regret buying his albums --
they usually get better with age.; -- Brad Kava; Jazz; JOHN COLTRANE; "Live in
Japan"; (GRP/Impulse; CD); (star)(star)(star)(star); This is an amazing gift
from the vaults -- four hours of Coltrane concert recordings, most of it
previously unissued in the United States. It starts out as an act of nostalgia
to listen to this music, recorded in 1966 on Trane's only Japanese tour. But
after a couple of blasts from Coltrane's and Pharoah Sanders' saxophones, the
nostalgia dissipates and you're re-immersed in this questing, primal-scream
jazz from Trane's final period.;   There's almost no context for this type of
music today -- overall, jazz has become pretty buttoned-down. But if the
sounds confuse you, take solace in the fact that people were confused 25 years
ago, too. Coltrane started out as a bebopper with Dizzy, Miles and Monk, then
rose to prominence as leader of one of the great bands of the century, a
quartet that painted the most enduring sound paintings of the '60s freedom
years. By 1966, the quartet had disbanded and Coltrane was a no-bones advocate
and leader of the jazz avant-garde. He was alienating a lot of his fans, but
there were plenty willing to come along for the ride. Amazingly, he briefly
turned free jazz into popular music.;   Just listen to the crowd's reaction to
"Leo." It's almost eerie -- you can hear the audience screaming, as if it's
caught up in a levitation of the concert hall. Drummer Rashied Ali is
chattering and exploding all over the place, locking in with pianist Alice
Coltrane and bassist Jimmy Garrison to set up a droning backdrop for the
soloists. Sanders screams, bleats and throws out wild staccato pipings on his
horn. And then enters Coltrane -- regally, with that exquisite velvet tone.
The music swells as Coltrane flies into the saxophone's upper register,
sometimes ecstatic, sometimes sounding like he's weeping for the world.;  
Wynton Marsalis is great. But Coltrane was something different, a charismatic
figure who never stopped pushing the music's technical and emotional limits. A
year after these performances, he was dead at age -- Richard Scheinin; Blues;
JOHN LEE HOOKER; "Mr. Lucky"; (Pointblank; CD and cassette);
(star)(star)(star)(star); More ornery than a sack of cats, John Lee Hooker
continues to be one of the greatest songwriter/singers in popular music, and a
man loved and admired by a lot of fascinating people.;   Many of them helped
out on "Mr. Lucky," including Ry Cooder, Booker T. Jones, John Hammond, Carlos
Santana, Johnny Winter and a slew of Bay Area musicians, including most of
Hooker's own Coast-to-Coast Blues Band. The result, produced mostly by Roy
Rogers, is delightful.;   All 10 tunes have at least one performer famous in
his own right, but truthfully, some don't bring anything remarkable. Keith
Richards' guitar licks are heard on the second version of "Crawlin' King
Snake," but Hooker's band performs it as well every time they hit a stage. But
Van Morrison playing a very simple guitar and sharing a duet with Hooker on "I
Cover the Waterfront" is beautiful. Johnnie Johnson's powerhouse boogie-woogie
kicks off the album with a burst of energy on "I Want to Hug You" ("and kiss
you and squeeze you till my arms fall off!"), matched by the excitement of
Hooker's singing itself. Albert Collins' Telecaster on "Backstabbers" is more
fun to hear than it was on his own last album.;   And Hooker's voice is the
unmatchable instrument it always has been. As Robert Cray sings on the title
tune, "John Lee, you was born for good luck, bad luck can't do you no harm.";
-- John Orr; Country; RANDY TRAVIS; "High Lonesome"; (Warner Bros.; all
formats); (star)(star) 1/2; Randy Travis is trying to hold his own.;   Once
the undisputed king of modern country singers, Travis has found his position
under attack from a host of challengers: Clint Black, Alan Jackson and Garth
Brooks.;   But "High Lonesome" suggests that Travis will not relinquish the
top spot without a fight. With one glaring exception, his latest set is a
solid collection of strong ballads and good mid-tempo numbers with just enough
surprises to keep things from getting predictable.;   The one notable clinker
on the set is, ironically, Travis' current top-selling single, "Point of
Light." The song sticks out not just because the lyrics are dumb and the
melody clunky but because it is a blatant attempt to promote George Bush's
"Thousand Points of Light.";   Happily, that is the end of the bad news, as
the rest of the set is filled with fine material. The best of the offerings:
the folky title cut; a rocking version of Jackson's "Allergic to the Blues";
"Better Class of Losers," which offers a bright, traditional country sound;
and the bouncy "Heart of Hearts," which features some marvelous fiddle work
from Mark O'Connor.;   Throughout the set, Travis' vocals are energetic and
well-tuned to the material. His is a most distinctive country voice -- filled
with hints of loves lost and too many whiskeys -- and he uses it well on "High
Lonesome.";   So don't count Randy Travis out quite yet. He may have
competition but he can still put up a fight.; -- Charlie McCollum; (Randy
Travis and Alan Jackson play Shoreline Amphitheatre on Saturday.)  </TEXT>
