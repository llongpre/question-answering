   David Holt is on the road looking for
traditional music and other celebrations of American life, from
banjo makers to washtub players to cowboy poets.
   Holt will begin reporting on his discoveries next Wednesday in
``Celebration Express,'' a new segment of ``Nashville Now'' on the
Nashville Network. The on-location reports, with upbeat and musical
themes, will run every Wednesday until Sept. 28.
   ``Nashville Now'' is a live, 90-minute variety series that
features the best of the country music stars. Next week, the show
will come live from Grand Cayman Island with such guests as Randy
Travis, Eddie Rabbitt, Conway Twitty, Loretta Lynn and Hoyt Axton.
The host is Ralph Emery, along with his puppet, Shotgun Red.
   ``I travel all the time,'' said Holt. ``That's what I do for a
living, playing concerts. I've been collecting music and songs from
the old-time mountaineers for 20 years, so this is like an
extension of that.''
   Holt's first ``Celebration Express'' segment on the show will
come from Denver, a look at cowboy poet Baxter Black.
   Another Denver segment will feature Daddy Bruce Randolph, who
owns a barbecue restaurant and gives away an estimated 4,000 meals
a year.
   ``He's a real inspiration,'' said Holt. ``He's doing this out of
the goodness of his heart. He's been doing it since he was a child
and he's 88 now.
   ``Since this is a celebration of the Nashville Network's fifth
anniversary,'' Holt said, ``we're looking for people who are having
a celebration. Or whose very lives are a celebration. We're going
to travel 100,000 miles around the country.
   ``I'd love to see this become a series. It's been a wonderful
experience for me just in the short time I've done it. It's
wonderful to search out these people and spend time with them.''
   Holt, who previously served as host of TNN's ``Fire on the
Mountain'' series, is a musician, storyteller and historian who is
helping to preserve the Appalachian musical heritage.
   In San Diego, Holt found the Deering Banjo Co., which is one of
four places in the world that still make fine banjos. ``Most of the
craftsmen also play, and we got a little session going that I
joined in,'' he said.
   ``Long Beach is celebrating its 100th anniversary as a city and
I did an interesting musical piece. I played a 64-string dulcimer,
which is made of spruce, in the cockpit of the Spruce Goose. It
makes an interesting sound to play an instrument of the same wood
as the room you're in.'' The Spruce Goose is the flying boat built
by Howard Hughes in World War II, now on display in a Long Beach
museum.
   Holt then went to Claremont, Calif., to see David Lindley, a
musician noted for unusual folk instruments.
   ``He plays the Hawaiian slide guitar and the saz, which is a
Turkish instrument with a long neck and six strings,'' said Holt.
``It gives a haunting sound. Lindley is a very tasteful musician
who has mixed folk, country and rock. He recently was on the Trio
album with Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris.''
   Holt also talked in Phoenix to Marshall Trimble, who sings
traditional cowboy songs. Another trip took Holt to Florida and
Georgia, where he talked to a professional washtub player for Harry
Belafonte and Pete Seeger, some Mayan Indians who use an instrument
that takes five players, and an alligator trapper who has the
ability to call alligators.
   Holt has also been a musical goodwill ambassador for the U.S.
Department of State. Frets magazine named him the ``best old-time
banjoist'' and Esquire magazine picked him as one of its ``men and
women under 40 who are changing America.'' His newest album is
``Reel and Rock'' which features Doc Watson on guitar.
