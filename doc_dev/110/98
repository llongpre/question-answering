   He grew up in basketball-crazed Indiana and
the irony wasn't lost on Henry Lee Summer.
   Here he was, cooling off in the basketball locker room at
Arizona State's University Activity Center, wearing his favorite,
black hightop sneakers with the cheers of the crowd still ringing
in his ears.
   But on this late September night, people didn't come to watch
Summer play hoops in a charity pickup game. The fans paid big bucks
to see him do what he really does for a living _ sing.
   ``Ever since I can remember, I wanted to be involved in music,''
said Summer in a backstage interview. ``I started out singing at
age 3 or 4 in a church choir. I knew I could sing, and when I did
people reacted differently than when other people sang.
   ``It wasn't that I had a better voice than everybody else. I
just know that when I do sing and I'm feeling what I'm singing,
people can feel it, too. I love to get people excited. I noticed
that real early on and got into it, even as a kid. There's a fine
line between church and rock 'n' roll, anyway. They're both dealing
with the human spirit.''
   Summer, now 34, is touring the country to promote his second
album for CBS Records called ``I've Got Everything.''
   The LP, released in May, has sold about 400,000 copies and is
closing in on gold status thanks to the hit single ``Hey Baby.''
   His self-titled debut album for the label last year had the Top
20 hit ``I Wish I Had a Girl,'' but peaked at ``around
300,000-something'' in sales, according to Summer.
   ``I wasn't happy with the way that album came out, but it wasn't
the producer's fault,'' said Summer, who writes and arranges his
own songs and plays both acoustic guitar and keyboards. ``I don't
like doing things more than once. In the studio, you do things over
and over and over and over. I only want to do it once and that's
it.''
   Summer's new LP, which he produced himself, was recorded at
``Henry's House of Noise'' _ his home in Indianapolis.
   ``There was equipment everywhere except the bedroom,'' he said.
``We miked the guitars in the kitchen, had the drums in the garage
and put the mixing board in my living room. I just wanted things to
sound live and most of the songs were done in one take.
   ``I was comfortable in my house and could sing whenever I felt
like it, as opposed to being on a schedule. I used my band and
three people from John Cougar Mellencamp's band (guitarist Mike
Wanchic, bassist Toby Myers and violinst Lisa Germano). We recorded
everything like a band and the vibe was right. When it wasn't
happening, we went and played basketball.''
   The lanky, 6-foot-3 Summer grew up as Henry Lee Swartz in the
small, farming community of Brazil, Ind. (population 5,000), where
he first sang at the Church of the Nazarene.
   He was a good enough high school guard to earn a full basketball
scholarship to Western Wyoming Junior College, but dropped out
after one year.
   ``I was a big fish in a small pond. But that was the first time
basketball started getting in the way of music,'' Summer said. ``I
remember missing half the games. I was in bands and it was either
go to the gigs or go to the away games.''
   Summer, self-taught on drums, guitar and piano, headed to
Jackson, Miss., where he perfected his husky vocals in nightclubs
and learned roadhouse rhythm and blues plus fatback Southern boogie.
   He returned to Indiana in the early 1980s and released four
singles and two albums on local, independent labels in 1982-86
before being signed by CBS in October 1986.
   By then, he was already known as Henry Lee Summer.
   ``I started going by that 15 years ago,'' he said. ``I was in
band called The Summer, so that's where the name came from. I got
my first band together when I was 11. I've been in a million bands
since then.''
   Summer and his current six-piece band have opened for Eddie
Money, Stevie Ray Vaughn and the Doobie Brothers this year, and
currently are on Richard Marx's tour.
   On the road, he often drives himself in a mini-van behind the
band's bus and writes his melodies by humming into a tape machine
on the seat next to him.
   Most of his latest songs are love ballads such as ``Something Is
Missing,'' and ``What's a Poor Boy to Do.'' But he promises ``more
up-tempo stuff'' for his next album.
   Summer has three tracks ready, including the song ``Low Flying
Man'' that he is testing out on the road with favorable reaction.
   His shows usually end with a standing ovation after a few
encores.
   ``I've always known that I had something to say musically. I
know when I'm playing live, a lot of people can relate to what I'm
singing,'' Summer said. ``I doubt that I'll be the next Bruce
Springsteen. But I think I'll be able to keep making records and
reach a level. Maybe not platinum. If I can turn out gold records,
that would be good enough for me.''
