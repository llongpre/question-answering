   Baseball historians were thrown a curve
Wednesday with a newspaper report that Alexander Cartwright
possibly wasn't the inventor of their game.
   The New York Times said that a newly discovered newspaper report
and box score show that other teams were already playing baseball
in New York City a year earlier than when Cartwright supposedly
invented the game in 1846.
   The story also reported that baseball probably evolved from a
number of enthusiasts in New York in the mid-1840s, rather than
springing fully formed from the imagination of anyone in
particular.
   According to the Times, which published the story in its
Thursday editions, the discovery was made by Edward L. Widmer, a
Harvard graduate student who was doing research for his doctoral
dissertation at the New York Historical Society.
   In a copy of The New York Morning News, Widmer reportedly found
an account of a game on Oct. 21, 1845, between the ``New York Ball
Club and a team from Brooklyn.'' Like the 1846 game credited by
historians as the first, the earlier game was played at the Elysian
Fields in Hoboken, N.J., then a bucolic area easily reachable from
Manhattan by ferry.
   The Morning News said that New York won 24-4, aided by a grand
slam, or in the vocabulary of the time, ``four aces'' off a single
hit.
   ``At the conclusion of the match, both parties sat down to a
dinner ...'', the newspaper reported, reflecting baseball's origins
as a social event between gentlemen.
   The account of the Oct. 21, 1845 game in The New York Morning
News indicates that the popularity of baseball was spreading
rapidly at the time. ``Two more Base clubs are already formed in
our sister city,'' Brooklyn, the story related.
   The Morning News did not say which rules were used, an important
question to specialists.
   In popular myth, baseball was invented in Cooperstown by Abner
Doubleday. Historians seeking the true progenitor have instead
credited Cartwright, a New York bank clerk, who is said to have
drawn up the rules and organized the first game in 1846 for the
Knickerbocker Base Ball Club at the Elysian Fields.
