<LEADPARA>  In analyzing Dave Ammon's success as an inventor, you could say it's all in
the wrist.;    Ammon created a wrist and forearm exerciser at his small,
family-run business in Campbell, and it has gripped a portion of the nation's
sporting and fitness market since its introduction three years ago.  </LEADPARA>

EXERCISE DEVICE WEDGES INTO SPORTS MARKET  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Whatever happened to . . .  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     The device, called the Marcy Wedge, is now used in the training rooms of
major league baseball clubs and adorns the shelves of sporting goods and
exercise equipment stores around the country. It's even being used by
musicians with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra to enhance their performing
skills.;    While the Marcy Wedge hasn't made Ammon a millionaire, quarterly
royalty checks from sales of the device and a couple of spinoff products have
helped him pay the bills and still have "a little funny money" left.;    "It
hasn't produced all the monetary success promised from the beginning, but I'm
satisfied," said Ammon, 40.;    The Marcy Wedge has generated more than $1
million in sales since summer 1988, Ammon said. The device, which retails for
about $45, is also included in the Sears and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. catalogs.;  
 Ammon said the product has "received a really good reception in the sports
community." It is a particular favorite of baseball and racquetball players,
who prize strong hands, wrists and forearms.;    Ammon's invention is the
first mechanical device designed to strengthen specific muscle groups in the
fingers, wrist and forearm -- the muscles most often neglected in ordinary
weight training.;    His idea was to use a stainless steel extension spring
placed inside a screw assembly and housing that could be adjusted to increase
tension and resistance. It is simple to use. The exerciser slips a forearm
between the cushioned struts and grabs the foam-padded grip. As the wrist
bends, the muscles extend and flex.;    Ammon completed his first sketch of
his wrist and forearm exerciser in December 1983 and dubbed it the Wrist-Flex.
The prototype was finished in early 1984 and a U.S. patent was secured in May
1986.;    The manufacturing and sales rights were sold to Marcy Fitness
Products. Ammon retained the rights to the patent and to royalties from
sales.;    Quarterly royalty earnings fluctuate depending upon the season. The
highest quarterly total received by Ammon was $30,000; the lowest $11,000.
Part of that money was used to see the family business, Artcraft Welding
Specialty on McGlincey Lane, through some slow economic times.;    "We do a
lot of work in the computer industry, and we felt a little edge of the
recession," Ammon said. "But we've rebounded from that and are doing real well
now.";    The company was founded in the mid-1960s by Art Ammon, Dave's
father, who remains as president. Dave and his brother, Dan, are vice
presidents.;    Over the years, many designers and inventors have walked
through Artcraft's doors looking to construct a prototype, get some advice in
refining an idea or help in manufacturing a device.;    Ammon said the Marcy
Wedge has become a kind of calling card for the company "demonstrating to
people the kind of work that's been done here.";    "The way I look at it,
there are so many people who have good ideas and never carry through on them,"
he said. "We had an idea that we carried through to its logical conclusion.
There are all kinds of ways of measuring success."  </TEXT>
