<LEADPARA>  There was no locker-room language, and the air didn't smell like sweaty
socks.;    But a half-dozen baseballs, three pitching machines and an old-time
ballplayer made a federal courtroom resemble a gym when a San Jose magistrate
played umpire Thursday in an unusual patent case.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  EX-BALLPLAYER CRIES FOUL ON HIS PITCHING
INVENTION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Former pitcher Arthur Brophy, who threw left-handed in the old Washington
Senators farm system in the '50s, charged that an Oregon company stole his
idea for a simple pitching machine that tosses a ball softly into the air,
right in front of a practicing batter.;    But a team of lawyers fielded by
Atec Inc. countered that their "Soft Toss" machine, which is made in Santa
Cruz, is substantially different from the device Brophy perfected in his
Florida garage after finishing gigs at local clubs as a jazz pianist.;   
After three hours of talks, both sides agreed Thursday to end the game without
extra innings. They reached a confidential settlement that was approved by
Magistrate Edward Infante.;    Doug Boehner, executive vice president of Atec,
said the company has sold at least 4,000 Soft Toss machines to major leaguers
and schoolchildren. The machines retail for $299.;    But Brophy, who says he
does some scouting for the Orioles and runs a small sports equipment business
from home, has canceled checks to prove he sold copies of his invention to
ballplayers Carl Yastrzemski, Rickey Henderson and Carney Lansford.;    During
Thursday's hearing, Infante removed his robe and suit coat while lawyers for
both sides demonstrated their machines. Watching attentively as baseballs flew
lightly through the air, the judge at one point took a kneeling stance to
scoop a stray ball off the soft blue carpet.;    Brophy and his lawyer brought
in two machines that looked a bit battered and worn. Atec brought a shiny
model that looked like it was right off the showroom floor.;    But the most
colorful part of the hearing was Brophy. Sporting a deep suntan and an
open-necked, brown-and-bronze-patterned sport shirt, the 55-year-old athlete
had trouble sitting still.;    He tinkered with the chutes on his machine and
lobbed balls into the air, even while Atec lawyer Richard Doyle was earnestly
arguing his case. More than once, Brophy's bow-tied attorney, James Hennefer,
signaled furtively for him to stop. Finally, Hennefer called his client's name
out loud, and Brophy meekly sat down.;    In the end, Brophy seemed happy with
the settlement and said he hasn't gotten discouraged from inventing things:
"I've got a couple more ideas to work on."  </TEXT>
