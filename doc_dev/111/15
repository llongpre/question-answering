There were lots of reasons why Jimmy Piersall was known as a flake back when he 
played major league baseball, but one of the best came the day he hit a home 
run as a New York Met and ran the bases backwards. 
</P>
<P>
All of which has little to do with the subject of this story except to 
illustrate the maxim that what may seem like buffoonery in one setting could 
make perfect sense in another. Had Piersall been playing in, say, Helsinki 
rather than Queens, he might have fit right in. 
</P>
<P>
Yes. Baseball has been Finlandized. 
</P>
<P>
The Finns call the game pesapallo and are so crazy about it that it's 
considered their national pastime. Of course they do it a little differently. 
They don't actually backpedal their way from base to base ala Piersall but, 
looking at it from a chauvinist American perspective, they do take a backwards 
route around the basepaths. 
</P>
<P>
First base is where third base ought to be, second is sort of around where 
first should be and third is somewhere out in left field. 
</P>
<P>
That's right, Abbott. Who isn't on first. I Don't Know is. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
Anyway, Finnish emigres have spread the game to Scandinavia, Canada and even 
Australia. And over the weekend they took their first crack at the toughest 
market of all -- the United States, the guarantor of all that is pure and noble 
about baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Here in Michigan's rugged Upper Peninsula, the heart of Finnish America, two 
Canadian pesapallo teams squared off Saturday in a demonstration game before 
thousands of slightly befuddled spectators at an ethnic festival. In a real 
slugfest, the Toronto Sisu eked out a 16-15 win over the archrival Thunder Bay 
Repais. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the annual FinnFest say that they hope to field enough domestic 
talent to stage home-grown pesapallo matches at future gatherings. Already, the 
Hancock High School baseball coach is talking about teaching the Finnish 
version to his team. 
</P>
<P>
The main selling point of pesapallo, devotees say, is action. There are no long 
pauses between pitches, the ball is almost constantly in play and both fielders 
and runners are forever scampering all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
"In American baseball, a runner on second is in scoring position but in our 
game he's just tired," winked Jari Leinonen, who plays for the Repais. "Usually 
when we get out there, we pack a lunch." 
</P>
<P>
The Abner Doubleday of Finland was Lauri Pihkala, a professor who apparently 
was mesmerized by baseball during early 20th-Century study tours in the United 
States. He combined the American game with some native ball-playing sports and 
pesapallo was born. 
</P>
<P>
Both baseball and pesapallo feature four bases, three outs an inning, nine 
innings, nine players on a side, a hard ball, mitts and a bat -- although the 
Louisville Slugger of Finland is called a Jarvinen Kanuuna. It's also safe to 
say that neither game will have Roseanne Barr sing the opening anthem in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
That's where the similarities end. The pesapallo pitcher, for instance, stands 
next to the plate and tosses the ball up in the air, varying his delivery not 
with curves or sliders but by the height the ball goes. (Orel Hershiser please 
note: if the shoulder surgery doesn't work, a career could still beckon in 
Finland.) 
</P>
<P>
Instead of waiting in a dugout, teammates of the batter stand around what's 
roughly equivalent to the batter's box and scream out advice whether to swing 
or not at a pitch. The batter can hit as many as three fair balls before he has 
to run. And the route around the basepaths sort of zigzags first to the left, 
then the right, then the left again. 
</P>
<P>
Confused? Try this. A three-base hit is a kunnari, or home run. The batter 
scores, even though he's allowed to stay on third and score again if somebody 
knocks him in. But getting a kunnari is not easy because a ball that's knocked 
out of the park -- about 300 feet from home to the farthest point of the 
pesapallo outfield -- is considered a laiton (foul). 
</P>
<P>
When an outfielder catches a fly ball, that doesn't necessarily mean the batter 
is out. He might just be haava (wounded), a sort of purgatory state for 
sluggers that requires them to forfeit the turn at bat but doesn't exactly 
count toward ending the inning. And when someone does make an out, he's not 
just out, he's pallo (killed). This is no game for wimps, that's for sure. 
</P>
<P>
There's one other important difference. At the end of the game, American 
ballplayers hit the showers. "When we're done," said Thunder Bay shortstop 
Pavli Kaki, "we go off to the sauna."
