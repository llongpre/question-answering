   A television personality's decision to
propose on the air didn't really surprise his girlfriend.
   Jed Mescon popped the question to Phyllis Bruce on Tuesday night
during ``Jed's Journal,'' his nightly feature segment WRCB-TV's
evening news broadcast.
   ``I feel like I owed Chattanooga. This is where I feel like I
became a professional and I wanted them to share in my joy,'' said
the 29-year-old Mescon.
   Mescon and Ms. Bruce, whom he describes as his best critic,
routinely watch his evening segment together, and when a camera crew
showed up at his apartment to catch her response to his taped
proposal, he told her it was to shoot a promotional spot. But she
suspected something was up.
   ``I was real nervous,'' said Ms. Bruce, 31. ``I started eating
coleslaw. I don't even like coleslaw. I couldn't swallow and there
was this camera in front of me.''
   She said yes.
   ``It was odd,'' Ms. Bruce said of the proposal, ``but I'm really
happy.''

   A plan to put ``Birthplace of Baseball'' on
New York's license plates is two-for-two with one batter to go.
   The Assembly on Wednesday gave final legislative approval to a
bill that would allow New Yorkers pay an extra $15 to have the
phrase on their license plates. The Senate earlier this month passed
the bill, which now goes to Gov. Mario Cuomo, who played minor
league baseball.
   The idea is to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the National
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown and the reputed 150th birthday
of the first baseball game, also supposedly played in Cooperstown.
   Some baseball researchers say the first game was really played in
1846 in Hoboken, N.J. New Jersey legislators have sent Cuomo a
petition asking him to veto the bill.
   Cuomo aides said the governor hasn't taken a position on the
bill. Unlike baseball, in government one strike and you're out.

   Studebaker's oldest salesman is still
hitting on all cylinders.
   A 1928 roadster that once roared 25,000 miles in 16 days at a New
Jersey racetrack will be entered in next year's coast-to-coast Great
American Race.
   The plucky Studebaker Commander joined the automaker's sales
force after its 1928 feat. With its convertible canvas top and deep
green leather seats, the car traveled another 25,000 miles to
dealerships nationwide promoting Studebaker.
   The Studebaker Corp. and its dealers have long disappeared,
victims in 1963 of the rough-and-tumble competition of the
automotive industry.
   But the company's once-famed Commander has another sales job, for
another boss. The car is owned now by the Studebaker National Museum.
   The 353 cubic-inch engine develops 86 horsepower teamed with a
three-speed standard transmission.
   ``One of the finest engines ever built,'' says John Hetman, the
89-year-old retired Studebaker mechanic who maintained the car
through the 1928 endurance test.
