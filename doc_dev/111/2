   A Harvard graduate student combing archives
uncovered new clues in the search for the origin of baseball in an
1845 newspaper sports story and box score.
   Abner Doubleday's ``invention'' of baseball in a Cooperstown,
N.Y., cow pasture has been debunked as a popular myth. The city of
Hoboken, N.J., then claimed the first game was played there in
1846.
   The story and primitive box score appeared in a copy of The New
York Morning News and recount a game played Oct. 21, 1845, between
the ``New York Ball club'' and a team from Brooklyn, The New York
Times reported today.
   The find by Edward L. Widmer, a Harvard doctoral candidate
researching his dissertation at the New York Historical Society,
indicates baseball had been in existence for some time when the
story was written.
   The newspaper account began: ``A friendly match of the
time-honored game of Base was played yesterday ...''
   New York won 24-4, aided by a grand slam, or in the vocabulary
of the time, ``four aces'' off a single hit.
   The newspaper account went on to say two new Brooklyn teams had
formed recently.
   After it was proved that Doubleday did not create baseball,
historians credited Alexander Cartwright, a New York bank clerk
said to have drawn up the rules and organized the first game in
1846 for the Knickerbocker ``Base Ball Club'' at the Elysian Fields
in Hoboken.
   The game reported in the Morning News also was played at Elysian
Fields, and Widmer found another clipping recounting a rematch Oct.
24, 1845, that was played in Brooklyn.
   The find indicates that ``New York City is the cradle of
baseball,'' said David Q. Voigt, a baseball historian and professor
at Albright College in Reading, Pa.
   ``Baseball was a city game, not a rural or farm game,'' he said,
adding that the find supports his theory that baseball developed in
stages.
