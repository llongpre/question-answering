<LEADPARA>  Tonight, the 1991 World Series will do more than change time zones. It will
practically change planets.;   When last we left it, this World Series was
taking place at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, where a trash bag passes for
the right-field wall, where routine flyballs have been known to send
outfielders looking for the nearest bomb shelter, and where Dave Kingman once
hit a pop-up that stuck in the roof and never came down.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Tonight, this Series moves to Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, where Johnnie
LeMaster once steeled himself against the rock-pile infield by taking infield
practice while wearing a motorcycle helmet, where Nolan Ryan once pitched in
front of a "crowd" of 1,762, and where baseballs travel so far that the
legendary Al Newman hit the only home run in his 1,861 career at-bats there.; 
 Yes, this may be a battle of the two best teams in baseball, the Minnesota
Twins and Atlanta Braves. But it is also a battle between the worst domed
stadium in baseball and the worst outdoor stadium in baseball.;   "At least in
our park," Braves General Manager John Schuerholz said, "if you lose a pop-up
or a flyball, it's lost in the sun or lost in the sky. It's not lost in the
Teflon.";   But if the Twins thought it was funny watching the Braves catch
pop-ups at their joint, wait until they try fielding groundballs in the
Braves' joint.;   "It's better now than it used to be," said Newman, the Twins
utility infielder who used to visit Atlanta with the Montreal Expos in 1985
and '86. "You know that face mask Alfredo Griffin used after he broke his
cheekbone? Everybody wanted to wear one when they came here. It was pretty
bad. It was kind of like pottery.";   Atlanta's stadium didn't even have a
full-time groundskeeper until 1989. It was tended by a city streets crew,
fresh from its previous gig -- repaving seven blocks of Peachtree Street.;  
The city also used to rent the stadium to practically anybody who wanted it.
One great tradition was a motocross every March, just in time to put nice,
thick grooves in the infield for opening day.;   Ah, but then the Metrodome is
no infielder's palace, either.;   Back in the early days of the Metrodome, the
AstroTurf was so spongy that balls often bounced over the infielders' heads
and the outfielders' heads. Tim Teufel hit one of those against Chicago in
1984. It turned into a game-winning, three-run, inside-the-park homer with two
out in the ninth.;   In another game that year, Kansas City's Mark Gubicza
gave up 11 hits and eight runs without even allowing a line drive. And
afterward, Schuerholz, who was then the Royals' general manager, said: "The
only thing that can solve the Metrodome's problems is a nuclear bomb.";  
Nowadays, the Metrodome is known mostly for its noise. But Schuerholz isn't
impressed with that, either.;   "Naturally, it's louder than our place,
because we don't have a roof," he said. "So the noise dissipates. In the dome,
the noise bounces up, hits the roof and bounces back down. I guess it finally
floats away through an air-conditioning duct.";   The Braves, of course, will
chop up some noise themselves this week. But that's because they finally have
invented a great new noise-production device. It's known as fans.;   In the
bad old days, this team drew so few people that three lights once fell off a
light tower and into the lower deck, and it didn't hit a soul. The Georgia
spring football game outdrew the Braves head-to-head four years in a row.;  
Twins catcher Junior Ortiz tells of coming to Atlanta with the Pittsburgh
Pirates once and seeing a foul ball hit into the seats. It landed next to a
fan, who shrugged and said, "Aw, we'll get it later.";   And when the Twins'
Chili Davis, a former Giant, was asked Monday what he remembered about the
crowds in Atlanta, he replied: "There weren't any.";   "When I played here,"
Davis said, "it was always a good park to hit in, but it was always dead. I
think we'll see a big difference this week. At least I hope so. Can you
imagine 4,000 people showing up for a World Series?"  </TEXT>
