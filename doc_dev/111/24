   A recovering Bay area shows America its
mettle tonight with the earthquake-delayed third game of baseball's
World Series, but the victims and the destruction will not be
forgotten in the revelry.
   ``We can enjoy World Series baseball and still remember those
who lost their lives or their property and those who are helping so
much in the recovery effort,'' Mayor Art Agnos said.
   By Thursday, nearly 21,400 people had registered for disaster
aid with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Damages are
estimated at $7.1 billion with nearly 14,000 people still out of
their homes, according to state officials.
   People can talk about the quake at a forum tonight held by the
Society for Traumatic Stress Studies, which coincidentally began a
meeting in San Francisco this week. The 500 experts called off
their disaster drill, but offered to help victims of the real thing.
   ``We believe in the value of talking, talking and sharing,''
said Yael Danieli, president of the society. Talking, ``you don't
have to feel lonely and scared. You can re-establish a sense of
community.''
   Relief also came in the form of a $3.45 billion aid package
President Bush signed Thursday, most of it destined for Northern
California. But people also sought lighter restoratives.
   Light as air, in the case of the 59th session of the mock San
Francisco Court of Historical Review. On its docket: Who invented
the doughnut hole? The winner?
   ``Mankind, in its own wisdom, invented the hole in the
doughnut,'' Municipal Court Judge George T. Choppelas ruled after
an hour of hilarious legal outrage.
   And San Francisco, which treats Halloween as its own special
holiday, begins the celebration this weekend.
   ``It was rather somber for a while,'' said J.S. Gilbert, general
manager of the 10th annual Exotic Erotic Halloween Ball, where
10,000 people are expected Saturday night. Some of the proceeds
will go to quake relief.
   ``But the weekend is important in the sense that people are
looking for a release, an opportunity to go out and enjoy
themselves,' he said Thursday. ``There was a lot of camaraderie, a
lot of good things that came out of the quake.''
   It was 10 days ago that millions of Americans, settling down in
front of televisions to watch baseball's World Series, instead saw
the 7.1-magnitude earthquake jerk Candlestick Park and the Bay area.
   Tonight, baseball returns after the longest break in World
Series history, to Candlestick, and many say it will give San
Francisco a chance to show off and lure jittery tourists back.
   A moment of silence will be observed at 5:04 p.m., the minute
the quake hit. Disaster officials will throw out the first ball,
and the ushers will carry flashlights just in case.
   Fans will be asked to sing ``San Francisco.'' The lyrics are on
one side of a handout, and a message from the San Francisco Giants
is on the other.
   ``Tonight we honor the resilience and indomitable spirit of our
community to rise again,'' the statement says. ``Let us all join
together, not only in prayers for the loved ones lost, but in
tribute to the survivors and selfless volunteers whose lives are
changed forever.''
   Dave Stewart, starting pitcher for the Oakland Athletics,
already ahead two games to none, said the players have had trouble
preparing for the game.
   ``We've all been through a national tragedy. I'm sure I'm not
alone, but the earthquake had a deep psychological effect on me,''
Stewart said.
   Commissioner Fay Vincent said baseball will donate $1.4 million
to the relief effort, including $100,000 from each Series team.
   Rebuilding from such a quake also means tearing down. Crews were
demolishing some of the ``red-tagged'' buildings _ those determined
unsafe _ and demolition went on at a 1\-mile stretch of Interstate
880 in Oakland.
   The crews also put up a chain-link fence around the collapsed
structure to keep people out and with fewer police officers, said
Highway Patrol Officer Ed Moriarty.
   The quake closed the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge and parts
of several highways, including a collapsed section of I-880. While
officials have reported record use of mass transit, commuter roads
have been clogged daily.
   In Sacramento, Gov. George Deukmejian's office announced the
appointment of George Housner to head the state's investigation
into the freeway collapse.
   Housner, engineering professor emeritus at the California
Institute of Technology, ``is the elder statesman of earthquake
engineering in this country,'' said Ian Buckle, who occupied
Housner's post until Monday when Deukmejian decided he had
compromised his objectivity.
   However slowly, the area is recovering, as are some of the
victims.
   Dockworker Buck Helm, rescued after four days in the rubble of
I-880, remained in serious condition in Oakland's Highland General
Hospital. But his kidney function has returned to normal, and he is
conscious most of the time, said spokeswoman Pat Pino.
   Six-year-old Julio Berumen and his sister Cathy, 8, were in good
condition and improving, said Children's Hospital spokewoman Diane
Lazzari. They lost their mother in the freeway collapse. About
$48,000 has been donated to a fund for them.
   But police said six people remained unaccounted for, and the
death toll rose Friday to 64, including an 88-year-old San Mateo
woman who was pronounced dead of a heart attack shortly after the
quake but who had not previously been listed among the dead.
Thirty-nine of those killed werein the collapse of double-decked
I-880. The search for more bodies was delayed because the road was
too shaky. On Friday,
   The Bay area's trauma has touched hearts and opened pocketbooks
the world over.
   More than $8 million has been pledged from outside the country,
$7 million from Japan. Costa Rican President Oscar Arias sent 2,500
pounds of coffee Thursday.
