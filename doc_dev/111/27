<P>
It must be remembered that in last August's binding agreement between baseball 
commissioner Bart Giamatti and Pete Rose it was never spelled out that Rose bet 
on baseball games, the sin for which he was banished from the game. 
</P>
<P>
He was not accused of it, and his hot denials figured in the daily dairy of the 
case that lingered for six months. Why, then, did Rose agree to accept 
baseball's maximum punishment -- exile forever? Because they were dancing 
around all the implicits of the agreement: that Rose had been caught betting on 
ball games and was getting baseball's life sentence. It was to gain his end 
that Giamatti agreed to make no definite charges, and additionally specified 
that Rose could apply for reinstatement in a year. 
</P>
<P>
It worked. Rose, who recognized the weight of evidence against him, knew he was 
a dead duck, and grasped at the face-saving factor of the right to reapply, 
which would give his case a better light. 
</P>
<P>
But that last condition was merely part of the charades. Fifteen men have been 
barred from baseball, and none was reinstated. After his pact with Rose, 
Giamatti the next day said of Rose, "Yes, I have concluded he bet on baseball 
games, including those of the Reds." 
</P>
<P>
The reapply-in-a-year stuff was put in best perspective by a high source in the 
commissioner's office who said "we won't quibble about the language if Rose is 
agreeing to accept the electric chair." Rose's chances of being reinstated in a 
year, or ever, it must be concluded, are about as rosy as Pete's next five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
That prison sentence he drew for filing false tax returns immediately raised 
the question of Rose's prospect of ever being voted into baseball's Hall of 
Fame, for which he would be eligible in 1992. Is he so tarnished that 
Cooperstown would be diminished by Pete Rose's induction? There are all shades 
of opinion, voiced immediatedly in the newspapers, on television, on talk 
shows, all of which started the Pete Rose thing as an intriguing topic. 
</P>
<P>
The case is made, of course, that Cooperstown is populated by heroes who were 
no models of deportment. Babe Ruth and some others were known to be egregious 
womanizers; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker were accused of betting on ball games 
(they were cleared). But no convicted felon was ever honored with enshrinement 
at Cooperstown. That line against Rose may have been drawn long ago. 
</P>
<P>
Rose has made election to Cooperstown a passion, saying his glorious baseball 
record, including the 4,256 hits that surpassed Cobb's record, should be a 
consideration (some spoilsports would note that it took Rose more than 2,000 
more times at bat than Cobb needed to set the record). But there can be no 
gainsaying what Rose did on the diamond. He was a great ballplayer. The 
opinions on Rose have been coming in from everywhere. Even former president 
Nixon chipped in with the belief that Rose should be in the Hall of Fame, which 
may or may not be a plus; many writers with the ballot would vote against Rose 
now, but say they would be willing to reconsider his case in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
A most poignant opinion was voiced by the Houston Chronicle's Harry Shattuck: 
"I'm still inclined to vote for him because he has Hall of Fame credentials as 
a player. But I hope the good people at Cooperstown put his statue and 
memorabilia in a dark corner of the museum with a sign that says 'Off Limits To 
Children' because he is no role model." 
</P>
<P>
It is to be remembered that the Hall of Fame voting must be based, in a large 
measure, on "a player's integrity, sportsmanship and character." In addition to 
the commissioner's office, Uncle Sam would also be a hostile witness in those 
important matters. 
</P>
<P>
The Hall of Fame is for heroes. Pete Rose is no hero. He was a great 
ballplayer, but hardly a person to evoke admiration and appoint to the game's 
highest honor. Who now, would want to elevate Pete Rose? He will not get my 
vote.
