<LEADPARA>  Two of the biggest names in American business reported losses today,
spotlighting the economy's weakness.;   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. said it lost $72.3
million in its fourth quarter despite efforts to trim inventories and lure
customers, and the giant retailer predicted a less-than-buoyant Christmas
season.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Meanwhile, CBS Inc. said today it lost $169.1 million in the third quarter,
reflecting an enormous decline in the value of the media company's contracts
to televise baseball and football.;   Macy's loss for the final fiscal quarter
ended Aug. 3 narrowed 10 percent from an $80 million shortfall in the year-ago
period, but was still weaker than expected.;   Sales totaled $1.63 billion,
roughly equivalent to the 1990 period.;   Macy is one of the biggest and
best-known American merchants, and its performance is considered an important
indicator not only of the company's own health but the state of the U.S.
retailing industry. The company doesn't report per-share results because it is
privately owned.;   For the fiscal year, the retailer lost $150.2 million on
sales of $6.76 billion. That compares with a loss of $215.3 million on sales
of $7.27 billion for the previous fiscal year.;   In a letter to investors,
Macy Chairman and Chief Executive Edward Finkelstein called the results
disappointing despite the difficult economic climate.;   Macy also announced
the creation of a new division that will operate clearance stores. In an
effort to keep inventories lean, the retailer said it plans to open five units
-- called Macy's Close-Out -- by spring that will sell primarily discounted
clothing. The first is scheduled to open this month in a mall in south
Florida.;   In addition to its Macy stores, the company owns the Bullock's and
I. Magnin stores on the West Coast. All told, the company runs 144 department
stores as well as several specialty store chains stocked with the company's
private label clothing.;   At CBS, problems were aggravated by a decision two
years ago to pay more than $3.5 billion for multiyear contracts to broadcast
major league baseball and National Football League games, college basketball
and the next two Winter Olympics.;   But the proliferation of sports
programming on TV and the advertising recession have made it impossible for
the CBS Television network to charge as much for commercial time as had been
expected, CBS officials said.;   CBS said it lost $169.1 million, or $11.11 a
share, in the three months ended Sept. 30 in contrast to a profit of $43.5
million, or $1.69 a share, a year earlier.;   The latest results were reduced
by $195.5 million after taxes to account for anticipated future losses on the
baseball and football contracts.;   The latest write-down, an accounting step
taken to show an asset's decline in value, comes on top of $55 million in
losses and another $115 million write-down that CBS took on the baseball
contract in the fourth quarter of 1990.;   Revenue for the third quarter fell
5 percent to $625.6 million this year from $661.9 million a year earlier.  </TEXT>
