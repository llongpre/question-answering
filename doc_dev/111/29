<P>
Cecil Fielder is walking through yet another bizarre afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The sports announcer for Japanese-based Fuji Television is trying his best not 
to crack while interviewing Fielder. Displaying patience in the face of 
technical adversity, the announcer presses on, mumbling a question in Japanese 
that is passed on by a translator to Fielder, who leans forward in a chair. 
</P>
<P>
A choral group is rehearsing the national anthem, and amplified voices in 
perfect harmony bounce off the seats at the Oakland Coliseum. It is like a 
sound check for the Rolling Stones' Steel Wheels Tour. 
</P>
<P>
The technicians are going berserk. The announcer is growing furious. But 
Fielder is smiling, gulping for air, trying to suppress laughter while 
completing the interview. 
</P>
<P>
And why shouldn't he be laughing? 
</P>
<P>
Fielder, born in the U.S.A., rejected in Canada and rejuvenated in Japan, is in 
the most charmed summer of his baseball life. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder has emerged as perhaps the most compelling and unbelievable figure of 
this baseball season, materializing like some samurai Roy Hobbs after a year's 
stay in Japan and finding his way back to a new home with the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday night's game at the the Kansas City Royals, Fielder was the 
American League leader in home runs (25), was second in RBI (63) and was 
batting .295 (79 for 268). He also was third among American League first 
basemen in fan balloting for the All-Star Game, July 10 at Chicago's Wrigley 
Field. 
</P>
<P>
Despite not hitting a home run since June 17, Fielder is threatening to become 
the sixth American Leaguer to hit more than 50 in a season, joining the 
exclusive group of Roger Maris, Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Hank Greenberg and 
Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit batting coach Vada Pinson calls Fielder "an angel in disguise." 
All-Star shortstop Alan Trammell says Fielder has carried the Tigers "like no 
player I've ever seen." And Manager Sparky Anderson says, "No one could have 
predicted what Cecil has done." 
</P>
<P>
Yet Fielder remains a mystery, a man drafted by the Baltimore Orioles, signed 
by the Royals, developed by the Toronto Blue Jays and given a second baseball 
life in Japan with the Hanshin Tigers. Fielder is a power hitter who learned 
patience and a labeled failure who discovered success. In short, he embodies 
the baseball belief that what separates the ordinary from the extraordinary is 
sometimes nothing more, or less, than opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
"I just needed a chance," Fielder said. "My career was almost over before it 
began." 
</P>
<P>
The raw numbers say Fielder is 26, stands 6-foot-3 and weighs 230 pounds. He is 
big. George Foreman big. If polyester could talk, it would shriek each time 
Fielder slips his uniform on. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder also is playful and soft-spoken. Invariably, he can be found in the 
Tigers' clubhouse wrestling a teammate to the floor and laughing with delight. 
</P>
<P>
So how on earth did someone so large, with a joyous personality to match, slip 
through baseball's cracks and fall all the way to Japan? And then come back 
again? 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy," said Oakland Athletics General Manager Sandy Alderson. "Things 
like that happen all the time. That's how the Baltimore Orioles come up with a 
Mickey Tettleton or the Oakland Athletics pick up a Dave Stewart. This game is 
full of surprises." 
</P>
<P>
But this goes beyond surprise. Twice this season, Fielder has hit three home 
runs in a game. He is as powerful pulling the ball to left field with a wicked 
wave of his 35-inch bat as he is driving the ball the opposite way. 
</P>
<P>
"With Cecil, you throw the ball, and then you pray," said Oakland's Stewart. 
"The man hits everything." 
</P>
<P>
Even Oakland's Jose Canseco, baseball's first $5 million a year player and one 
of the game's most feared home-run hitters, is a Fielder fan. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the power hitters who barely hit home runs," Canseco said. "Spare 
me the grief. But Cecil, he not only hits it, but he hits it a long way." 
</P>
<P>
The moral to the story: Never give up on a big man with pride. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder was a three-sport star at Nogales High School in La Puente, a 
melting-pot community near Los Angeles. Basketball was his first love. He was a 
starting point guard as a 14-year-old freshman and led the team to a state 
playoff semifinal during his senior season in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
In football, Fielder played linebacker and was used as a quarterback on long 
passing downs. Baseball was just something Fielder played to occupy time during 
the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
John Romano, the Nogales' baseball coach, recalls Fielder's hitting 
tape-measure home runs that sent balls bouncing onto golf courses, skipping 
down streets and soaring over houses. 
</P>
<P>
"He really wanted to play basketball in college," Romano said. "But basketball 
coaches didn't like his body. He was 6 feet 2 and 218 pounds. It was his 
father, Edson, who convinced him to play baseball." 
</P>
<P>
Hailed as a possible heir to Willie Upshaw at first base or Cliff Johnson at 
designated hitter, Fielder failed to meet the expectations of the Blue Jays. In 
parts of four fitful seasons, Fielder hit 31 home runs and drove in 84 runs in 
506 at-bats, but he became lost in the shuffle as the Blue Jays developed Fred 
McGriff. 
</P>
<P>
"The Blue Jays didn't have any room for me," Fielder said. "I was the odd man 
out. I never complained. I never said I wanted to get out of here. I'm glad 
they gave me the opportunity to go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
What the Blue Jays gave Fielder was a chance to play for Hanshin in Japan for 
$1 million, plus perks that included a furnished apartment for his family, a 
satellite-television dish to pick up American baseball games and a personal 
translator. 
</P>
<P>
Fielder terrorized Japanese Central League pitchers in 1989, hitting .302 with 
38 home runs. His first homer was a 500-foot shot that slammed into a King Kong 
poster at the Tokyo Dome. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit the monkey in the leg," he said. "I thought they were going to give me a 
watch. Some of my teammates even thought I might get a car. But I didn't get 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
Fielder received only polite encouragement from his teammates, who consider 
foreign domination foul play. Although he was prepared to remain in Japan for 
another season, Fielder feared for his security when another American, Larry 
Parrish, was released after leading the Yakult Swallows in home runs. Fielder 
exercised an option, received his release and auctioned his services to the 
highest American bidder. 
</P>
<P>
There was no war. The Tigers were the only team to show an interest in Fielder, 
signing him for $3 million for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't look at it as a gamble," Detroit general manager Bill Lajoie said. "I 
knew he could hit and hit with power. He had better statistics than any 
Triple-A minor-league player in this country." 
</P>
<P>
For a time, Fielder put up numbers that, if generated throughout the season, 
would have given him a 68-homer pace. Inevitably, he cooled off. But, with a 
power hitter, another streak may be around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
"When Cecil goes 0-for-4, people think he's slipping," Tigers outfielder Lloyd 
Moseby said. "But he'll be OK. This man is going to be the Most Valuable Player 
of the American League." 
</P>
<P>
Fielder will hear none of that. Comparisons to Maris and Ruth are useless. MVP 
talk is silly. 
</P>
<P>
"All I wanted was a chance," he said.
