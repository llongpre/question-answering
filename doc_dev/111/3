   Mayor Patrick Pasculli says New Yorkers who
claim the Empire State is the birthplace of baseball are way off
base.
   Pasculli announced Wednesday the formation of American Baseball
Heritage Inc., a non-profit organization formed to pitch this
mile-square city as baseball's home and lobby nationally for
``Baseball Day,'' to be celebrated annually June 19. Hoboken will
create a museum to chronicle the contributions of Alexander J.
Cartwright.
   Pasculli said the first game of baseball was played on Hoboken's
Elysian Fields during the afternoon of June 19, 1846. He credits
Cartwright _ a surveyor, amateur athlete and inventor _ with
refining the game.
   ``Once and for all we're going to destroy the fabrication that
Abner Doubleday invented the game, and that Cooperstown, N.Y., was
its birthplace,'' Paculli told a news conference.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, however, disagrees.
   Cuomo signed a bill in April that will allow New Yorkers to
order license plates donning the picture of a ball and the words,
``Birthplace of Baseball.''
   Stephen Speiser, president of the Hoboken group, thinks Cuomo's
out in left field.
   The game really evolved from the British games of cricket and
rounders, Speiser said. Cartwright refined it, wrote down the
rules, and umpired the first game, he said.
   League historians at the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown agree that
Cartwright played an important role early in the game. But they say
New York has a better claim than New Jersey, by at least a year, of
fielding the first match.

   California, move over. Florida,
which boasts more vehicles than people, has earned the dubious
title of the car capital of the world.
   The state has 12.8 million residents _ and 15.1 million
vehicles, according to the latest statistics from Florida's
Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles.
   California has only 8.5 vehicles for every 10 people. Florida
also leads the nation in new car sales.
   Some Floridians have one car for pleasure and another for work.
Tourists want rental cars. Families buy junkers for teens. People
who winter in Florida keep a spare in the state. Even those who
might not be able to afford a car need something to get around in
because of inadequate public transportation.
   ``The biggest thing these numbers say is what a lousy public
transportation system we have in Florida,'' said John DeGrove, of
the Joint Center for Urban universities.
   J.D. Power &amp; Associates, a California-based research firm, found
that Floridians buy 87.34 new cars for every 1,000 people each
year, nearly 50 percent above the national average.

   Is southern Florida big enough for two
Manuel Noriegas?
   Manuel E. Noriega, a U.S. Navy veteran living in Miami Beach,
isn't sure.
   Noriega says he has been bothered by harassing telephone calls
from people who apparently have him confused with his notorious
namesake.
   ``They have been very nasty calls. I try to explain, `Look,
you're talking to the wrong guy,''' said the 84-year-old native of
Mexico.
   He is the only Manuel Noriega listed the telephone book covering
Miami, where deposed Panamanian ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega was
arraigned last week on drug trafficking charges.
   The Miami Beach Noriega worked for the Latin American division
of DuPont before retiring. He now heads an export business.

   An enterprising poster maker who sold nearly
750,000 targets featuring the Ayatollah Khomeini a few years back
now has Manuel Noriega in his sights.
   Mike McCormack's latest creation: the smiling face of a
uniformed Noriega with a superimposed bull's eye.
   ``I've been getting a lot of requests for this one,'' said
McCormack, who also has brought out target posters of U.S. Sen. Ted
Kennedy, D-Mass., former President Jimmy Carter and former Chicago
Mayor Jane Byrne.
   ``A lot of military people have been requesting the Noriega
poster,'' he said. The former Panama dictator's government was
toppled by a U.S. invasion last month.
   ``Most of them couldn't go in the invasion, so they figure this
is the closest they can get to him,'' McCormack said. ``I guess a
lot of people want to see him hung.''
   The 17-by-32 inch posters will sell for $4 each when they go on
the market in the coming days, first in southern Florida, where
Noriega now faces federal drug charges.
