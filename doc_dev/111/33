<LEADPARA>  ON MY elementary school report card envelopes, there was a drawing of a boy in
a baseball uniform crossing the plate.;    "In life as in baseball," said the
caption, "the main thing is to get home safe."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It was the first of many times baseball has been presented to me as an
allegory for life. In a sports-minded society, I suppose that is inevitable.
And not without justification.;    To some extent, at least, sports and life
require many of the same ingredients for success. You have to set goals, work
hard, pull your share of the load and work well with others. You need talent,
an understanding of the game and a measure of luck.;    But the older and more
experienced I get, the more I see life in terms of games other than baseball.
Now that I am both middle-class and middle-aged, for example, there are two
childhood games that seem much more fitting: dodge ball and keep away.;    In
life, as in dodge ball and keep away, the main thing is to stay out of the
middle.;    The middle is for suckers.;    Take middle management, for
example. I did, but only for a while. Then I realized it was a sucker's game.
After the initial glow of achievement and recognition wears off, you're left
with more responsibility than authority. You take the blame, but not the
credit.;    In dodge ball, the middle is also fun at first. You're the center
of attention, surrounded and outnumbered, daring others to try to hit you with
the ball.;    But if you are stranded in the center of the circle for any
length of time, it gets tiresome, then frustrating, then maddening.;    Even
worse, as games go, is keep away (a.k.a. monkey in the middle). Now there is a
game invented by sadists, a game that brings out the worst in everyone who
plays it.;    The rules are simple: Two or more people throw a ball back and
forth, keeping it away from the "monkey" in the middle, who jumps and runs to
and fro, vainly trying to get it.;    The temptation to tease the monkey is
almost overwhelming. Sometimes a player will hold the ball just out of reach,
cruelly flipping it to a partner at the last moment.;    Often, the resulting
frustration drives the one in the middle to abandon not only the rules of the
game but the rules of civility. As I recall, more than one game of keep away
ended with a fight.;    As a frustrated American taxpayer, I'm in the middle
and I sometimes feel like fighting, too. Like last week, for example, when I
read the story about President Bush trying to get the Internal Revenue Service
to lay off the corporate tax cheaters and go after middle-class cheaters
instead.;    As we all know, many corporations pay less in taxes than some of
us who are trying to support families, pay mortgages and put kids through
college. Some of them pay nothing at all.;    When you consider that
corporations can afford the best tax specialists, it's far more likely that
mistakes are intentional. For the rest of us slobs, who either do our own tax
returns or pay a small fee to someone who spends an hour or so putting them
together, mistakes are more likely to be unintentional.;    But the president
wants his big-shot friends left alone. Better, he says, to nail the little
guy, the guy in the middle.;    Fools that we are, we will re-elect him, too.;
   Yeah, you've got to be a real chump to be in the middle. Which makes those
of us who live in Florida perhaps the biggest chumps of all.;    Currently, we
are in the middle of a gargantuan lawsuit filed by the federal government
against the South Florida Water Management District and state regulators over
pollution of the Everglades.;    To date, we have spent $5.8 million as state
taxpayers to defend the suit, and goodness knows how much as federal taxpayers
to prosecute it. Apparently both sides are determined to do whatever it takes
to win, no matter how much it costs taxpayers.;    In other words, no matter
which side wins, those of us in the middle end up losers.  </TEXT>
