When the cry of "Play ball!" officially goes through the land this week, it 
will open a season that will see the biggest changes in who's covering baseball 
since NBC's inaugural telecast in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
NBC, whose pioneering radio and television coverage for seven decades won it 
the distinction as "The Baseball Network," found itself without the sport when 
it was outbid for the exclusive network rights in December, 1988. ABC, which 
also carried regular season games and alternated with NBC on All-Star and 
post-season telecasts since 1976, also was called out. 
</P>
<P>
In their place, CBS, which has not broadcast a game since 1964 -- and with a 
bid of just over $1 billion -- became the exclusive network home of Major 
League Baseball. CBS' coverage begins Saturday with a 10 a.m. game between the 
Dodgers and Houston Astros (on Channels 2 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, baseball also has agreed to its most extensive cable network 
coverage, with ESPN winning the rights and scheduling 161 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Shaker, CBS Sports' executive producer, asks viewers to be patient with his 
network's coverage. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going in beating our chests saying we'll do baseball better than 
it's ever been done before," he said. "We go in with a deep bow to NBC and ABC 
and with a great reverence for the game. It'll take time and we'll make 
mistakes. Hopefully, we won't make them a couple of times. We'll make our own 
imprint on televising baseball, but not right out of the blocks." 
</P>
<P>
Shaker said his network plans no departures from the traditional approach to 
televising the sport. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not out to re-invent the wheel," Shaker said. "NBC for the last four 
decades and ABC since 1976 set the standards for network coverage of baseball 
on television. They set a high standard, and we'll have to work really hard to 
reach that." 
</P>
<P>
The change most noticeable to viewers will come in the announcing booth. 
Instead of the play-by-play announcer holding the central role, the analyst 
will. 
</P>
<P>
Holding those roles will be longtime major league catcher and former ABC 
analyst Tim McCarver and Jim Kaat, who pitched a record 25 seasons in the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
"Tim has a tremendous way of expressing himself, with great humor and 
spontaneity. He'll be able to express himself much more freely than he did at 
ABC, (which covered baseball with a three-man team) because there will be one 
less person in the booth." 
</P>
<P>
But McCarver won't be heard in Southern California until June. For the next two 
Saturdays, the duo of Kaat and St. Louis Cardinals broadcaster Jack Buck will 
call the games beamed into the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to take the same approach to announcing that I did to pitching -- keep 
it simple, stupid," said Kaat, who has announced for NBC, ESPN and three major 
league teams. 
</P>
<P>
"I try to prepare and give the avid fan insight he can chew on, but not lose 
the casual fan by going too deep. I want to be honest, objective and 
lighthearted." 
</P>
<P>
Another member of CBS' announcing team is Greg Gumbel, who will host the studio 
wrap-around show. His brother Bryant of the "Today" show once held the same 
position at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
One tradition CBS won't be keeping is televising a game every week. After an 
April 21 game between the California Angels and Minnesota Twins, baseball will 
disappear on CBS until June 16. Games will be televised each Saturday 
thereafter through Aug. 25, when there will be another hiatus until Sept. 22. 
</P>
<P>
But the void will be more than made up by cable. 
</P>
<P>
ESPN will carry double-headers Tuesdays and Fridays and single games Sunday and 
Wednesday evenings. ESPN's coverage begins Monday with an opening-day game at 
11:30 a.m. between the Milwaukee Brewers and Chicago White Sox, followed by a 5 
p.m. Chicago Cubs-Philadelphia Phillies contest. 
</P>
<P>
According to Loren Matthews, ESPN's senior vice president in charge of 
programming, the key to his network's broadcasts will not come from the 
ballparks but from its Bristol, Conn., studios. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that we'll be able to go to other games, predominantly on a 
quick turnaround tape basis to show what's going on," Matthews said. "For 
extraordinary occurrences, we will have even greater latitude of bringing live 
the significance of Nolan Ryan's 300th win or a long hitting streak being on 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
The all-sports cable network also will air "Baseball Tonight," a nightly 
scores, highlights, features and analysis show hosted by John Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to put the season into perspective, instead of just reporting it 
as a series of games," said "Baseball Tonight" coordinating producer Eric 
Schoenfeld. 
</P>
<P>
"If you watch the weekly baseball shows, it's tough for them to pick out the 
three or four most pivotal moments. Because we'll be there every night, we'll 
have pivotal moments every night, spotting trends, anticipating upcoming trends 
and saying why each game is meaningful."
