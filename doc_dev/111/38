   Sporting Goods Firms
   Are Off Their Game

   GONE are the good old days when people would flock to pay
dearly for the latest in high-tech sporting equipment. The
sporting goods industry, holding its annual Super Show in
Atlanta this weekend, is resigned to slower growth now and
years into the future.
   The Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association projects
sales will rise 5% this year to $33.14 billion. That isn't
much better than last year's estimated 4.4% increase, and is
well below the double-digit gains of the 1980s. Worse yet,
sporting goods manufacturers and retailers expect annual
growth to average just 2% to 3% over the next 10 to 20 years,
a recent survey by consultants Kurt Salmon Associates found.
   "The market isn't growing," says Scott Reda, a distributor
in Easton, Pa. "We're just fighting for the same customers."
   The industry depends increasingly on fashion whims.
Booming sales of apparel with team logos and trendy soccer
wear will prop up the industry's growth this year, says John
Horan, editor of the trade newsletter Sporting Goods
Intelligence.
   Other merchandise won't fare as well. The recession and
worries about unemployment have hurt leisure spending. New
hightech products, such as a $125 superlight baseball bat,
are often too costly to sell well in hard times. Sales of
sports equipment are flat, Mr. Horan says. And growth in
sales of athletic shoes has slowed to 4%, he says, from 20%
in the '80s.
   Tighter leisure budgets and increased emphasis on family
may shift some business toward less expensive sports, even
after the recession lifts. Alvin Lubetkin, president and
chief executive of Oshman's Sporting Goods, a chain based in
Houston, expects sales of camping equipment and backyard
games such as badminton and volleyball to rise at least 10%
annually. "We'll see a rethinking of how people spend their
leisure time," he says.
                                                                                                       

   For Olympics Tie-Ins,
   Industry Looks to '96
                                                                                                       

   THE BIGGEST sports event of 1992 -- the Olympics -- isn't
sparking the interest of sporting goods manufacturers.
   Sales of equipment for sports that are rarely televised
outside the Olympics, such as volleyball, may benefit
slightly from the games, analysts say. But overall, the
industry isn't paying much attention. The Sporting Goods
Manufacturers Association expects only a modest gain in sales
around the Olympics, says president John Riddle.
   Given the right conditions, the Olympics can be a boon.
Mr. Reda expects industry sales to rise 25% when Atlanta
plays host to the 1996 Summer Games.
   But this year's Winter and Summer games are both in
Europe. And they come at a particularly tough time. As the
recession hurts business, retailers are cutting back
inventory and manufacturers slowing production. Orders for
this spring are down about 20%, Mr. Reda says.
                                                                                                       

   Soccer Garb, Shoes
   Gain a Foothold
                                                                                                       

   SOCCER may still be a poor cousin to football and basket
ball, but the soccer look is holding its own off the field.
   Soccer fashion "is big business," says Oshman's Mr.
Lubetkin. "Maybe 10% of the customers go to the field. Most
wear it because it looks good."
   There's a burgeoning market for baggy soccer shorts,
soccer shoes and post-game sandals. Industry analysts say the
soccer apparel and shoe market totals $425 million to $620
million and is growing 10% a year. It should get a big boost
when the 1994 World Cup is held in the U.S.
   Soccer is the nation's fastest-growing sport, according to
a survey of retailers and manufacturers by Kurt Salmon
Associates. High school soccer participation has nearly
doubled in the past decade, as other team sports have seen a
decline, says John Briggs Jr., executive director of the
Soccer Industry Council of America.
   Moreover, the demographics of soccer appeal to marketers.
It has broader participant appeal than other big team sports:
One-third of soccer players are female. Also, "it's played
more by the daughters and sons of professionals in the
suburbs," says Ian McLaren, president of Umbro USA, the
nation's biggest maker of soccer equipment.
   Umbro's sales more than doubled in 1991. People buy soccer
shorts for "lounging in their house," swimming, weightlifting
and sleeping, Mr. McLaren says.
   Black leather soccer shoes (without cleats, made for
artificial turf) are also doing well. People wear the shoes
"seven days a week," says Peter Moore, president of Patrick
USA, a manufacturer, whose overall sales grew 22% last year.
Its sales of rubber soccer sandals -- more expensive versions
of flip-flops, with an Italian design and massaging cones
that soccer players covet to soothe their soles -- have
doubled in the past two years, he says.
                                                                                                       

   Odds and Ends
                                                                                                       

   THE SUPER Show's 200 new products include a few zingers.
The Flytrap Fielders Glove, priced at $80, comes with a
sticky palm, the better to snare screaming liners with.
Newman Tackified Glove, in Hoboken, N.J., says it soaks the
palm in a "petrochemical" mixture. . . . One product might
wipe out the post-workout shower. Misty Mate, in Chandler,
Ariz., makes a $39 portable air conditioner that straps to
the waist. The two-pound device runs only on pressurized
water -- no batteries or electricity -- and sprays mist or
cool air for up to two hours between fillings. It was
invented to help construction workers stay on the job in hot
weather.
