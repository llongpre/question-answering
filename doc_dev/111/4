   Fans across America might eagerly be
awaiting the start of the oina season if an American here had not
changed a few rules and renamed it baseball, according to a
Romanian sports official.
   Adding his voice to the decades-old debate over the origin of
baseball, Cristian Costescu said the American pastime derived from
the ancient game of oina, which was introduced to the United States
by a pair of Transylvanians.
   Costescu, president of the new Romanian Baseball Federation,
says the two immigrants from the Romanian village of Alba Iulia
joined the U.S. Army and taught the game to their comrades.
   Among their comrades was a young officer named Abner Doubleday,
who changed a few rules and created baseball in 1839, Cotescu said
in an interview.
   ``We are not saying that Romania invented baseball. We would not
like someone else to tell us oina was invented by others,'' said
Costescu. ``But we are saying this: some little inspiration for
baseball was from oina. Baseball is more sophisticated than oina,
but the structure is the same.''
   Romanians claim oina was invented by shepherds in the first
century and say documents from 1310 describe a variation of the
game called hoina being played in southern Romania.
   Oina has 11 men per side, with one team batting and the other in
the field. Each side is allowed one at-bat, in which all 11 players
take the plate.
   A pitcher is provided by the team at bat and he serves up a lazy
underhand toss. The batter tries to hit the ball as far as
possible, then has to run 120 yards through nine bases.
   But if the batter is tagged by a fielder or hit by a thrown
ball, the fielders can score points _ so teams can score even while
not at bat.
   Oina uses a ball almost the same size as a baseball but filled
with horse hair. The bat is similar to a cricket bat and fielders
do not wear gloves.
   Oina still is a Romanian national sport, with forms of the game
being played in various regions of the Balkan country. Though there
are 1,675 teams around Romania, as opposed to about 15 baseball
teams in the country, its popularity has slumped in recent years.
   ``Fifty years ago everybody was playing oina, all the high
schools and elementary schools,'' Costescu said through a
translator. ``But handball, basketball and volleyball appeared and
oina started disappearing.''
   It has been a quarter-century since the heyday of Eugen Cocut,
the Babe Ruth of oina whose height and huge hands allowed him to
hit powerful shots and fire the ball with terrifying speed.
   If Costescu is successful in his post with the 2-month-old
baseball federation, he may assure that the next Cocut plays
baseball instead of oina.
   Costescu used to head the Romanian Oina Federation, back in the
days when baseball was banned as ``a capitalist sport.''
   That stigma was removed after the December revolution that
overthrew dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, and the baseball federation
was formed.
   ``Baseball will be more popular than oina in cities, but in the
villages oina will remain,'' Costescu said. ``Even though I am the
head of the baseball federation now, oina is always in my heart.''
