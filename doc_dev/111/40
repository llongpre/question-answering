   From Ernest Thayer's famous poem, ``Casey at the
Bat,'' to James Thurber's short story, ``You Could Look It Up,''
baseball has been literature's favorite sport.
   That tradition continues with Roger Angell's ``Season Ticket''
(Houghton Mifflin Co., 18.95), the fourth book the fiction editor
at the New Yorker magazine has written about the summer game.
   Although he writes about drugs and strikes, temperamental owners
and million-dollar salaries, Angell believes the real story is
still on the playing field. And he approvingly cites the saying of
the late Chicago White Sox owner Bill Veeck that baseball is a game
to savor.
   ``This insatiable thirst by the fans for what someone is really
like is OK,'' Angell said, ``but I think they sort of miss the
point for why they're there in the first place.''
   Angell has been writing about baseball since 1962. Each year, he
visits the spring training camps in Florida and Arizona, travels to
ballparks around the country during the regular season and attends
as many post-season games as possible. He is not just interested in
the games themselves but how they are played.
   ``The past few years I've been asking how they catch, how they
pitch,'' he said in an interview. ``The players, once they know
you're interested in what they're doing, you can't shut them up.''
   ``Season Ticket'' compiles articles starting with the 1983
season through the summer of 1987, when Angell describes a visit to
baseball's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y. Whether writing about
the 1986 World Series or discussing the intricacies of how catchers
field their position, Angell is continually surprised at how much
there is to learn about baseball.
   ``I'm just beginning to understand. We all go through this. It's
very easy for fans to think that they know the game,'' he said.
``Listen to (New York Mets announcer) Tim McCarver. This is a guy
who's been playing the game all his life and everytime I listen I
learn something new.''
   In the preface of ``Season Ticket,'' Angell writes that baseball
is a game that can never be fully understood:
   ``I will always be an amateur of baseball, but I no longer feel
like an outsider; none of the old pros I talked to ... gave me the
impression that he had subdued the game, either. We are baffled but
still learning, and we keep coming back for more.''
   Angell was born in 1920. His mother, Katherine, was an editor at
the New Yorker for many years. His stepfather was E.B. White.
   ``He (White) suffered writing but made it look easy,'' Angell
said. ``He taught me how difficult it is to write.''
   Although he admires the spare, clean prose that was White's
trademark, Angell changes his style when writing about baseball.
   ``I think that I've developed a habit of rather long sentences
with parentheses which I don't use in other writing,'' he said.
``You use run-on sentences like the flavor of the run-on feeling in
the ballgame.''
   Angell believes the pace of a baseball game makes it easier to
write about. ``Baseball is linear. One thing happens, then
something else happens,'' he said. ``You can take notes. You can go
back and recreate a game and you can almost always explain why
something happened.
   ``You can't do that with basketball or hockey _ they move too
fast.''
   As someone who became a fan when Babe Ruth was in his prime,
Angell has seen many changes: night games, artificial turf, the
designated hitter. He has lost none of his enthusiasm.
   ``The game itself has hardly changed at all in our lifetime. The
leagues are bigger, the players are better paid but it has the same
feel. It's a real part of summer.''
   Like many fans, Angell has imagined himself playing in the major
leagues. He was a pitcher in high school and use to dream about
striking out the side. He remembers when his fantasy stopped.
   ``At some point in my upper 30s or early 40s, I was seeing a
psychiatrist and I came in with a dream,'' Angell recalled. ``I
dreamed that there were some bushes and shrubbery and there was a
gravestone with my name and my birthday on it and the year I was in.
   ``I took this dream to my shrink with some trepidation and he
asked how I felt and I said I felt sort of sad. He asked me what
the gravestone reminded me of and I said it reminds of those stones
out in center field in Yankee Stadium.
   ``Then I realized it meant the end of my baseball dreams.''
   In a chapter discussing the drug problems that have tarnished
baseball's image in recent years, Angell warns against expecting
too much of the players:
   ``I think a great many of us have begun to see how deeply we
want baseball players and other athletes to be better than we are.
We may wish this now more than ever before, because other heroes _
in politics, in our daily lives _ seem to be in short supply.''
   Angell never worries about expecting too much from the game
itself.
   ``The enthusiasm I have for baseball is real,'' he said. ``My
appreciation has increased with the knowledge. I've noticed a lot
of players feel this way too.''
