MORNING BRIEFING: BO'S HOMER DOESN'T QUITE MEASURE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bo Jackson hit a tape-measure home run off Nolan Ryan in Arlington, Tex., 
Tuesday night, but he has a lot of distance to cover before he catches up with 
Mickey Mantle, according to the man who virtually invented the term 
"tape-measure homer." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur E. (Red) Patterson was the New York Yankees' publicity man in 1953, when 
Mantle hit what many still believe to be baseball's longest home run. 
</P>
<P>
Patterson went outside Griffith Stadium that night, April 17, 1953, stepped off 
the distance of a majestic Mantle home run and came up with a figure of 565 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
When he worked for the Yankees, Patterson said he saw Mantle hit "about a 
dozen" home runs in the 450- to 500-foot class. But the Washington blast, he 
says, outdistanced them all. 
</P>
<P>
Add Mantle: The homer seems to get a little longer every time Patterson tells 
the story. When contacted Wednesday, Patterson, now 80, described it again. 
</P>
<P>
Mantle, batting right-handed against left-hander Chuck Stobbs, hit a drive that 
was helped by a wind. 
</P>
<P>
"The ball not only cleared the left-field bleachers, but went out of the park 
about halfway up the scoreboard, which was on top of the bleachers," recalled 
Patterson, now a special consultant for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
"It was still going up when it went out. 
</P>
<P>
"I found a kid with the ball, and he told me the ball came down 'In a lady's 
back yard.' He showed me the spot and I stepped it off -- I never really used a 
tape measure -- to the outfield fence. Then I added the home-to-fence distance 
inside the park. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave the kid $10 for the ball, got Mantle's bat, and convinced the Yankees 
to put them on display in the Yankee Stadium lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"We did, and someone stole them. 
</P>
<P>
"Our radio announcer, Mel Allen, made pleas every day for them to be returned, 
that no questions would be asked. Some kid returned them. He told us he took 
them. 
</P>
<P>
"The (New York) writers accused me of fabricating the whole thing, but it's a 
true story. The bat and ball are in the Hall of Fame today." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Jackson's homer traveled 461 feet, according to the IBM tape 
measure chip in Arlington Stadium's scoreboard. According to Kansas City 
writers, it was Jackson's second-longest homer. He hit a 475-footer in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
For Added Measure: Only one player, Willie Stargell, ever hit a fair ball out 
of Dodger Stadium, and he did it twice. The first was a 506-foot 6-inch blast 
off Alan Foster in 1969; the second a 470-footer off Andy Messersmith in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Stargell's 1969 homer cleared the outfield pavilion roof on the fly. The 1973 
shot hit the roof, then bounced out of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Only four players, according to the Dodgers, ever reached the loge level 
(second level) with home runs: Frank Howard, Dave Kingman (twice), Dave Parker 
and Nick Esasky. 
</P>
<P>
For Short Measure: There can be no discussion of tape-measure homers without 
mention of Frank Howard's rocket launched at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh in 
1960. Someone stepped that one off at 565 feet, too. 
</P>
<P>
For decades, Babe Ruth was credited for a spring training homer in Tampa, Fla., 
that traveled anywhere from 560 to 656 feet, depending on who was telling the 
story. 
</P>
<P>
Another epic Mantle home run occurred at Yankee Stadium in 1963. Batting 
left-handed against Kansas City's Bill Fischer, Mantle hit a ball that struck 
the upper-deck facade, 18 inches below the roof. It was one of two homers 
Mantle hit off the facade. 
</P>
<P>
There is no record of anyone hitting a fair ball out of Yankee Stadium, but 
there are stories of Josh Gibson accomplishing the feat in a Negro League game. 
</P>
<P>
For Final Measure: Steve Gietschier, archivist at the Sporting News, says he's 
never seen a list of baseball's longest homers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a thick file labeled 'tape-measure homers,' but it's just old 
clippings," he said. "From looking at it, I'd say every well-known home run 
hitter in the game has hit at least one." 
</P>
<P>
Dept. of Brains and Spikes: One of the entries in the women's mile at the Aug. 
6 Jack-in-the-Box Invitational track meet at UCLA is Kathy Kanes, who recently 
received her doctorate in chemistry at Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
Wait a minute. Caltech? 
</P>
<P>
"She's probably on the top-50 list of U.S. women milers," meet director Al 
Franken said. "She's never going to beat Mary Slaney. But then, Mary Slaney 
never explained room temperature fusion to me, either." 
</P>
<P>
Quotebook: "I enjoy physical contact," said Dennis Byrd, 270-pound defensive 
lineman from Tulsa and a New York Jet draft pick. "I really like to hit. This 
is the only sport except boxing where you can abuse someone and not go to jail 
for it."
