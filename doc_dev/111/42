<LEADPARA>  BOBBY THOMSON will turn 68 on Oct. 25, and you'd think by now he would be
retired not only from baseball but from the real world. You'd expect him to be
reaping everything one might expect from an individual who produced what Roger
Angell has called "the most vivid single moment, the grand exclamation point,
in the history of the pastime," or what the late Red Smith tried to describe
as "the inexpressibly fantastic.";   He's not. "I live a very normal working
man's life here," Thomson said by phone recently from his home in Watchung,
N.J. "I've been working ever since I got out of baseball."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Thomson handles East Coast sales for a Chicago-based container company,
working in the browncraft segment and dealing in grocery sacks and corrugated
boxes.;   Maybe it's the price you pay for baseball immortality, but it
doesn't seem right. He should be forever young, still dancing around the bases
and diving into a tide of teammates, or at the very least removed from
commonality.;   He doesn't complain, not even with so much justification.
Today's player can parlay the smallest achievement into a fortune. Do today
what Thomson did in 1951, and you're set for quite a few lifetimes.;  
"There's nothing to be happy or unhappy about -- what the hell, it's there for
them, so why not get it?" Thomson said. . . . It's not like when we played,
when you signed a one-year contract and got paid for what you did the year
before. These guys are getting paid money that they haven't even earned yet.
It's not good business.";   Trying not to sound like an old-school cliche, he
paused and said, "It's not for me to judge, but it probably would have been a
little different for me if I had done that today.";   What Thomson did was hit
the most dramatic home run in baseball history, the "Shot Heard 'Round The
World." It came off Ralph Branca on Oct. 3, 1951, in the bottom of the ninth
inning of the third and final playoff game, beating the loathed Brooklyn
Dodgers 5-4 and completing the New York Giants' comeback from 13 1/2 games out
on Aug. 11 to the National League pennant.;   What Thomson did was write the
gist of his own epitaph with one swing of the bat. The current Giants
management phoned him a while back, when the team was making a stirring
comeback from 15 games out to within six of the Los Angeles Dodgers. The club
wanted to know about his schedule, with the possibility that there would be a
Bobby Thomson Day on Oct. 3. Although the Giants and the promotion idea faded
away, Thomson said, "It's nice this thing is still kicking around. It's nice
to be remembered.";   Vivid memory; Ernie Harwell remembers it like yesterday.
He and Russ Hodges were Giants broadcasters then, one on radio and one on
television, which had just gone coast-to-coast. On this day, it was Harwell's
turn to be in the TV booth for the first and last three innings.;   They made
the switch after the sixth, when the Dodgers were milking a 1-0 lead and the
crowd at the Polo Grounds was growing restless. Thomson tied the score in the
seventh with a sacrifice fly, but the Dodgers scored three in the eighth and
still had starting pitcher Don Newcombe on the mound.;   The Giants cut it to
4-2 in the bottom of the ninth on two seeing-eye grounders and an RBI double
by Whitey Lockman. The Giants and many others thought Newk still had it, and
Dodgers Manager Charley Dressen wasn't sure. Acting on players' advice at a
mound meeting, he called for Branca.;   Branca's plan; Branca had given up a
homer to Thomson that decided Game 1, and he wanted to get ahead in the count
this time. He succeeded by throwing a fastball for a called strike. The plan
was to come back with a fastball up and in, where Thomson supposedly was
vulnerable, and then Branca would be able to waste a third pitch for a
breaking ball low and away. That was the plan.;   Thomson swung at the second
pitch, and crack: Every eye followed the ball's flight to left field. It
sailed over Andy Pafko's head and into the seats. Thomson pranced around the
bases and leaped into awaiting arms at the plate.;   Two different views;
"It's gone," was all that Harwell said, letting the TV picture tell the story.
He adds today: "I had a little misgiving -- 'Am I calling it too early?' But
it made it over the wall, and I just stayed quiet for a while, let the crowd
noise take over, and then, after what seemed two or three minutes -- actually
30 or 40 seconds, they swung the camera around on me and I did a little recap.
Our TV setup was not as refined as it is now.";   In the booth next door,
Hodges was going wild: "Bobby Thomson up there swinging. . . . Brooklyn leads
it 4-2. . . . Branca throws. . . . There's a long drive. . . . It's gonna be.
. . . I believe. . . . The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant!
The Giants win the pennant! The Giants win the pennant! . . . Bobby Thomson
hits into the lower deck of the left-field stands and they're going crazy!
Yaaaaho-o-o-o-o!";   The aftermath; Branca was found later on the steps
leading from the Dodgers' clubhouse to the trainer's room, lying on his
stomach, weeping and muttering pitifully, "Why me? Why me?";   Thomson was on
a cloud for the longest time, and it carried him that night onto the Perry
Como Show.;   The Giants went on to lose the World Series to the Yankees;
Thomson went on to a decent career and a longer one in sales; and Branca never
got that pitch back but did develop a lasting friendship with his rival. The
two sign baseballs together, their paths inextricably interwoven.;   "Now it
is done," Red Smith wrote. "Now the story ends. And there is no way to tell
it. The art of fiction is dead. Reality has strangled invention. Only the
utterly impossible, the inexpressibly fantastic, can ever be plausible
again."; BIG SHOTS;   (box) THE SHOT HEARD 'ROUND THE WORLD (Oct. 3, 1951):
Bobby Thomson hit a high-and-tight fastball from Brooklyn reliever Ralph
Branca over the left-field wall for a three-run homer, giving the Giants a 5-4
ninth-inning victory and a pennant in the deciding game of a three-game
playoff.;   (box) MAZ'S MIRACLE (Oct. 13, 1960): The New York Yankees scored
two runs in the top of the ninth inning to tie the score at 9-9 in Game 7 of
the World Series, but Pittsburgh's Bill Mazeroski hit the winning homer off
Yankees reliever Ralph Terry.;   (box) MARIS' 61ST (Oct. 1, 1961): Roger Maris
had one game left to break the hallowed single-season record of Babe Ruth, and
he sent a waist-high fastball from Boston's Tracy Stallard 15 rows deep to
right field at Yankee Stadium.;   (box) HOMER IN THE GLOAMIN' (Sept. 28,
1938): The Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates were tied for the N.L. lead and
they were tied 5-5 going into the bottom of the ninth on the final day of the
season. If no one scored in that half, it would be declared a draw. With two
out in semi-darkness at Wrigley Field, Gabby Hartnett, the Cubs' catcher and
manager, hit the pennant-winning homer.;   (box) CARLTON FISK'S FAIR BALL
(Oct. 21, 1975): Boston's Bernie Carbo tied Game 6 of the World Series with a
three-run pinch-homer in the eighth inning, and it remained 6-6 going into the
bottom of the 12th. Carlton Fisk swung at the second pitch from Cincinnati
reliever Pat Darcy and hit it toward the left-field foul pole. He applied body
English as the ball went just fair, and he danced around the basepaths.;  
(box) BABE RUTH'S 'CALLED' HOMER (Oct. 1, 1932): Ruth hit 15 homers in 10
World Series, and his last one was by far the most famous. Or at least, the
most controversial. In the fifth inning of Game 3 at Wrigley, Cubs
right-hander Charlie Root threw a called strike to Ruth, and the batter held
up one finger in accordance with the call. Two balls later, there was another
called strike and another such gesture by Ruth. It appeared to some people
that Ruth then pointed to the center-field bleachers, and on the next pitch he
hit one to the very spot, the longest homer anyone had hit there.; -- Mercury
