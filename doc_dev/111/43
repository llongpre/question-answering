   What is a Christmas display without a laser
light show anyway?.
   Striving to outdo himself, Al Copeland, the owner of Popeyes
Famous Fried Chicken, has added the light show and artifical snow to
his gaudy annual holiday display _ the one the Louisiana Supreme
Court forced him to move away from his home in suburban New Orleans.
   Now at his corporate headquarters near a New Orleans shopping
center, the display featuring more than a million lights was to be
lit up for the first time this season Friday.
   Copeland started his Christmas displays outside his suburban
mansion in the early 1980s, but they grew to the point that
thousands of people would jam the streets to gawk at the lights and
giant figures of reindeer, Santa Claus, a snowman and angels.
   Unhappy neighbors went to court and, in 1985, the state Supreme
Court ordered the display turned off and dismantled. Copeland moved
the show to his corporate offices two years ago.

   The ``binocap'' and shoestring holders
beat out the doggie doorbell and flavored clarinet reeds in a
5th-grade battle of inventors.
   Jeremy John Alberhasky said he hated holding binoculars during a
football game so he invented the binocap, combination headwear and
binoculars, by gluing snap-out pocket binoculars to a baseball cap.
   The 11-year-old was one of the winners at Regina Elementary
School's invention contest.
   Katie Drop, 10, also was a winner with shoelace holders made out
of Velcro fasteners.
   ``Shoelaces always come undone and you trip on them,'' she said.
``I put Velcro on so they stay up.''
   Everyday problems were on the minds of most of the young
inventors.
   Tired of awful-tasting clarinet reeds, Lucy LePeau, 11, dipped
some in peppermint and orange extract.
   Katie Lacina, 10, invented a doggie doorbell so she would not
have to constantly check to see if her dog wanted to come inside.
She tied a spring, bell and bone to a piece of string so her dog
could announce its arrival by pulling on the bone.
