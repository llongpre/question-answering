WHEN PETER H. GORDON of the New York State Museum began putting together an 
exhibition of baseball-themed art, he discovered it was a massive task. With 
its thrilling heroics and mesmerizing rhythms, the national pastime has 
captured the imaginations of American artists and writers in a way that, say, 
badminton or even soccer never could. What is it about baseball that makes us 
cherish it so? Curator Gordon has come up with 149 individual answers in 
"Diamonds Are Forever: Artists and Writers on Baseball," up from Aug. 19 
through Oct. 21 at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla.

It breaks your heart. It is designed to break your heart. The game begins in 
the spring, when everything else begins again, and it blossoms in the summer, 
filling the afternoons and evenings, and then as soon as the chill rains come, 
it stops and leaves you to face the fall alone. A. Bartlett Giamatti. "The 
Green Fields of the Mind"

"I loved the game," Shoeless Joe went on. "I'd have played for food money. I'd 
have played free and worked for food. It was the game, the parks, the smells, 
the sounds. Have you ever held a bat or a baseball to your face? The varnish, 
the leather." W. P. Kinsella. "Shoeless Joe"

This is the power of their faces It is summer, it is the solstice the crowd is 
cheering, the crowd is laughing in detail permanently, seriously without 
thought. William Carlos Williams"At the Ball Game"

Any baseball is beautiful. No other small package comes as close to the ideal 
in design and utility.It is a perfect object for a man's hand. Roger Angell.

Things as critical as this, the selection of a favored baseball team, are not, 
as some suspect, a matter of choice; one does not choose a team as one does not 
select his own genes. They are confirmed upon you, more than we know an act of 
heredity. David Halberstam ."The Fan Divided"

When I emerged from the tunnel and stood there in the first tier, looking out 
over home base, I gasped at the perfect greenness of it. So this was a diamond.
