<LEADPARA>  SUNDAY was the last day of the Pan American Games, but it was like every other
day here. Cuba won more gold medals. The Cuban national anthem was played 11
times at boxing alone. Fidel Castro watched from a box seat, did the wave,
then spoke briefly at the closing ceremonies.;   "Thanks to the extraordinary
efforts of our people," said Castro emotionally, "we have been able to
discharge with honor our pledge."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  NO RATIONING CUBANS' JOY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     That pledge -- made in January -- was to finish the Pan Am stadiums on
time, then stage the games without any palpitaciones. In other words, no
screw-ups.;   Remarkably, it happened. The stadiums were fine. The security
was fine. No U.S. athlete was disqualified for drugs or was arrested by the
local policia. That's one reason the games played so poorly in Peoria, where
"Bowling for Soybeans" probably drew higher ratings than the Pan Am swim
finals. From the U.S. angle, the games were boring.;   But the Cuban angle --
here, on the scene -- was quite different. These past two weeks were a daily
whiff of sweet air in a polluted city. We saw athletes weeping for joy and
spectators literally sprinting from city buses to get inside to see events.;  
SUNDAY at the boxing arena, when it was announced that Cuba had clinched the
most Pan Am gold medals (140-130 over the United States, which sent mostly
second-string athletes), the place went to pieces. Grown men wept.;   And all
you could think was: good for them. The citizens of every country -- not the
politicians, the average citizens -- deserve a feel-good victory lap once in a
while. The United States had one in 1984 at Los Angeles and reacted no less
giddily than Cuba did Sunday.;   Look, these people had to give up their food
rations this summer so that athletes could eat as well as possible at the Pan
Am Village. What do you want them to do? Restrain themselves? There will be
time enough for that. Those food ration books are part of the Pan Am economic
hangover that will begin here today.;   Oddly, the official line is these
tough times are good for the country, because they will only make Cuba
stronger. Huh? I've discovered so many odd twists to this country that before
I leave I should make a list of them. In fact, I should make two lists.;  
THREE very strange things I found in Cuba:;   1. Dollars. U.S. dollars.
Everywhere. This is the absolute nuttiest part about Cuba. The country has no
diplomatic relationship with the United States, but all the hotels and tourist
restaurants take only dollars. Castro needs them to prop up his murky economy.
So when tourists from Germany or France come here, they must change their
marks or francs into dollars before spending any money.;   2. Expensive
restaurants. Another effect of the grab for dollars. A full dinner at the
Floridita, where the daiquiri was invented and Ernest Hemingway once hung out,
costs around $50. At the famed Tropicana nightclub, the cover charge alone is
$45, with food extra.;   3. Fans of U.S. sports stars. Even though few games
are shown here, Cubans have a fair knowledge of U.S. baseball players. "You've
met Rickey Henderson?" they ask. "Canseco wears No. 33, right?";   Three
strange things I did not find in Cuba:;   1. Cubans in the tourist hotels and
restaurants. Because the government is aggressively pursuing tourism, it
doesn't want ordinary citizens bothering the new visitors. This means Cuban
civilians cannot enter the best eateries and nightclubs in their own towns.
Cubans supposedly accept this practice, understanding its economic benefits.
Sure. Most Cubans I met called it "tourist apartheid.";   2. Souvenir
baseballs. The custom here is for all foul balls to be returned from the
stands. Fans hoot and whistle until the fan who catches the ball throws it
back onto the field. Wait till they hear what an autographed game ball is
worth at memorabilia shows in the United States.;   3. Nutrasweet. Cuba's top
cash crop is sugar, so there are no diet soft drinks to be found anywhere. The
most popular refreshment -- for the fans who can afford it -- is called
Tropi-Cola. It has extra sugar, extra caffeine and has already rotted away
three of my teeth.;   But back to the good news. With the United States' blah
performance here, there will probably be cries for the United States to
abandon the Pan Am Games entirely to Latin American nations. Big mistake. You
can ask Jeffrey Hammonds why.;   Hammonds, the Stanford baseball player who
started in center field for the U.S. team, said his greatest pleasure here was
exploring Havana.;   "Kids will come up to me on the street here," said
Hammonds, "and they will yell, 'Jeffreehammons! Jeffreehammons!' " he said.
"They recognize me from the games on television. They want to shake my hand.";
  For children whose vision of people in the United States is fashioned by all
the anti-imperialist propaganda and rabble-rousing billboards along the
roadways ("UNCLE SAM, WE ARE NOT AFRAID OF YOU"), that is no small advance in
international relations. We'd be wise to remember that the next time we think
the Pan Am Games are a waste. In Havana, you'd get an argument about that.  </TEXT>
