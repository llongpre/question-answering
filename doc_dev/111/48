<LEADPARA>  Residents of River Ranch Circle say they can't enjoy the serenity and safety
of their own back yards because of the baseballs that come sailing in from the
nearby Saratoga High School baseball field.;    "My wife and I have a little
girl and we don't feel she's safe in her own back yard," said David Guido, who
has lived on River Ranch Circle for eight years. "We've been getting balls
from day one, but it's become increasingly worse. Three balls once landed in
our yard during one game."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Another neighbor, Richard Ohren, escaped injury when he was hit by a ball
while gardening in his back yard last baseball season. But he said that
incident, plus many more near misses, illustrate how dangerous the situation
is.;    Tired of having their back yards turned into the left-field bleachers
at Saratoga High, the residents are pushing for either the city of Saratoga or
the Los Gatos Joint Union High School District to go to bat for them.;    "The
city or school district has to do something to protect us," said Guido.;   
The district's governing board and city council members will meet jointly next
month to discuss the problem and what each agency might be able to do to help
solve it.;    Residents expressed their concerns to district trustees late
last summer. They brought with them to the meeting dozens of baseballs they'd
collected over the years.;    Guido had two large garbage sacks full of balls,
including two dozen he'd picked up in his yard last baseball season alone.;   
"There was an astonishing number of baseballs collected from back yards," said
Superintendent Tod Likins, who was principal at Saratoga High from 1979 until
his appointment as superintendent last year.;    Likins said the longstanding
problem seems to stem from young adults batting the ball around, mostly on
weekends. He added that while it seems strange, given the price of baseballs
these days, that people would "stand there and pump balls over the fence, that
seems to be what's happening.";    Guido said sanctioned high school games are
the least of the problem.;    He said more balls have landed in his back yard
when adult leagues were using the field.;    The homes on River Ranch Circle
are behind the left-field fence. It is 310 feet from home plate to the
left-field foul pole. Right behind that are a 32-foot screened fence and an
access road.;    Guido said the problem intensified around four years ago when
some construction work removed trees that provided a natural barrier between
the homes and the field.;    Trustees in September passed a resolution
requesting that the city adopt an ordinance prohibiting the playing or
practicing of baseball, golf or archery on the Saratoga High School campus
without the written consent of the school district.;    The resolution stated
that the district had received complaints about "unsafe conduct by casual
users" of the campus and was unable to enforce use restrictions and the
policing of them without support from other local agencies.;    The city
council did not direct the city attorney to draft an ordinance at its meeting
earlier this month.;    City Manager Harry Peacock said city staff is studying
"to what extent we have the legal ability to enforce a city ordinance on
school district property.";    Residents claim the effective alternatives
include prohibiting all baseball games at the field, relocating the field to a
different part of the campus, or reorienting the diamond away from the homes.;
   Councilman Vic Monia said that with a reorientation of the field there
would be no disruption of its intended use and it would remain an active
recreational facility for the city.;    "And, it addresses the safety issue
the best way," Monia said. "If you get hit in the head, it doesn't matter
whether it was from a sanctioned baseball game or not. The balls still go over
the fence."  </TEXT>
