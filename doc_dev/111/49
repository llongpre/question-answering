Tony Pena isn't used to having much free time. 
</P>
<P>
He spent four falls playing football, two winters playing basketball and three 
springs playing baseball for Mater Dei High School. He also played four summers 
of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Pena sat out his freshman baseball season to rest. He ended his basketball 
career after playing on an undefeated junior-varsity team as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
His summer schedule indicates Pena isn't slowing up much, however, despite the 
fact he has dropped football from his play list. 
</P>
<P>
Pena graduated from Mater Dei two weeks ago, then spent 10 days relaxing on the 
beaches of Maui. He said he had a good time, which is a good thing. It might be 
the only break he gets this summer, assuming his tired pitching arm holds up. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying to keep it pretty mellow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He got off the plane from Hawaii Tuesday and played in the Orange County High 
School all-star baseball game that night. Pitching for the South, the 
right-hander gave up three runs in two innings, but was not involved in the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind of embarrassed about the game," he said. "But I didn't pick up a 
ball for 10 days before that night." 
</P>
<P>
Pena was selected to play in a game that matched an Orange County high school 
all-star team against a team from Los Angeles County Thursday night. But he 
decided to pass. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Pena is supposed to be part of an Angelus League all-star team that 
plays a team of Sea View League all-stars at 3 p.m. at UC Irvine. He isn't sure 
if he will pitch, however. It depends how his arm feels. 
</P>
<P>
Pena also pitches for the Cardinals, a Connie Mack League youth team. He will 
take a break from the Cardinals, to pitch in the U.S. Olympic Sports Festival 
at Oklahoma City. He was selected, along with Chris Sheff of Laguna Hills, to 
play in the festival. 
</P>
<P>
Pena was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the June free-agent draft, but he 
hasn't talked to them. He hasn't really had the time. 
</P>
<P>
Pena signed a letter of intent to play baseball at Arizona State. The Sun Devil 
coaches asked him to do one thing this summer -- rest his arm. 
</P>
<P>
"They (Arizona State) want me to take it easy," Pena said. "They want my arm to 
be strong when I get there in August." 
</P>
<P>
Pena, 6-foot-2 and almost 200 pounds, was impressive this season for the 
league-champion Monarchs. Pena, who throws mostly a fastball and a split-finger 
fastball, was 12-2 with a 0.57 earned-run average. He had 88 strikeouts in 88 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
"We used him more than we have used any other pitcher here ever," Mater Dei 
Coach Bob Ickes said. "You could tell by the end of the season that he was 
tired. Maybe the best thing he could do is take a rest." 
</P>
<P>
Pena said he noticed that he was losing something off his fastball toward the 
end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei's season ended in a 4-2 extra-inning loss to El Dorado, the eventual 
5-A Southern Section champion. Pena entered that game in the fourth inning and 
didn't allow a run until the eighth. Then El Dorado got three consecutive 
singles and a sacrifice fly to score two runs and end Mater Dei's season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd lost a little zip by the end," Pena said. "But I didn't want the season to 
end with me any other place than on the mound, win or lose." 
</P>
<P>
Pena was named the most valuable player in the Angelus League for the second 
consecutive season. He also was The Times' all-county first-team pitcher. As a 
junior, he was 9-0. He was 3-2 as a sophomore, also on the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
His 24-4 career record was impressive, but Pena is also proud of another 
pitching accomplishment. He didn't allow a home run in a high school game. The 
feat is even more impressive when you consider that he pitched about half the 
time at Mater Dei, one of the smallest fields in the Angelus League. 
</P>
<P>
"It was something that I knew about, but didn't really worry about," Pena said. 
"It just seemed that no matter what, the ball would stay in the field." 
</P>
<P>
Pena could have been busier this summer had he not given up a promising 
football career. 
</P>
<P>
Pena, a wide receiver, was second in Orange County with 64 receptions. He 
averaged 17.1 yards a catch and was an all-Angelus League and Times' all-county 
pick as well. He was selected by the Orange County Athletic Directors Assn. as 
the male athlete of the year for his work in football and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
Pena was asked to play in the Orange County High School all-star game and the 
Shrine All-Star game, which features the best Los Angles area players. But he 
turned down both invitations. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked football a lot," Pena said. "Being a receiver is a lot like being a 
pitcher. When you line up, it's only you and the guy across from you. I like 
that challenge. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't want to lead anybody (recruiters) on. I knew when football ended last 
fall that was it for me. I just had a feeling that baseball was going to be my 
sport. It's where I see my future." 
</P>
<P>
As long as he gets some rest.
