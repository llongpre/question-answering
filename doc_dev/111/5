The first thing you learn at the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is 
that real fans don't take lunch breaks. 
</P>
<P>
About half-past noon, the main exhibit hall on the museum's first floor is 
teeming with activity. For one day, visitors are taking their nourishment from 
bats, balls and the other 6,000 items that tell a remarkable story. 
</P>
<P>
A young couple and their two children are watching a TV monitor, and being 
thoroughly entertained by Abbott and Costello's hilarious "Who's On First?" 
comedy routine. A few steps away, visitors are clustered around "The Three 
Umpires," Norman Rockwell's classic painting of the stone-faced arbiters braced 
against some industrial-strength rain drops. Hanging in a place of prominence 
are 6- to 7-foot-long banners emblazoned with the photographs of Jim Palmer and 
Joe Morgan, the 205th and 206th inductees into baseball hallowed Hall. 
</P>
<P>
It's baseball as you've probably never experienced it. Baseball in Sensurround. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the Hall of Fame and Museum is an impressive repository of baseball 
history, not to mention a mighty tourist attraction. When it opened for 
business in 1939, the museum welcomed more than 25,000 visitors, and, as 
recently as 1984, yearly attendance hovered just above 200,000. But several 
years ago, the explosion in baseball's popularity finally reached this remote 
country outpost in upstate New York. In 1989, visitors to the Hall topped 
410,000, with the majority coming during the peak months of June, July and 
August. 
</P>
<P>
They might have come to see the jersey worn by Orel Hershiser in the fifth game 
of the 1988 World Series, Bo Jackson's cap from the 1989 All-Star Game or 
Mickey Mantle's Yankee Stadium locker. They're all here. 
</P>
<P>
Or maybe they made the pilgrimage hoping to pick up a handy fact or two about 
the game. Like the young boy in a Red Sox cap who stood in front of a display 
case that held items belonging to the dynastic Yankees of the 1940s, '50s and 
'60s. Among the treasures was a fielder's glove and a pair of spikes used by 
Phil Rizzuto, the famous shortstop turned TV pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
As he stood beside the window, the boy made a startling discovery. Then, in a 
tone of utter astonishment, he asked his dad, "You mean the guy from The Money 
Store ... was a baseball player?" 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the museum is full of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
It's also an excellent place to go in search of baseball's origins and secrets, 
the trouble being that most of the deepest secrets have to do with who gave us 
baseball in the first place and, most important, where. There is no shortage of 
theories on this point. Ask the citizens of Hoboken, N.J., who recently 
proclaimed their town "The real birthplace of baseball," and hired a 
public-relations firm to convince the rest of us. But if you're interested in 
making friends during your visit to Cooperstown, only one answer will do. 
</P>
<P>
The historians pretty much agree now that there isn't a baseball birthplace and 
that there almost certainly wasn't a first baseball game. Instead, baseball 
probably evolved slowly during the 1830s and '40s from a game known as 
"Townball" that was played in any number of cow pastures where men gathered 
with their bare hands and handlebar mustaches. 
</P>
<P>
No matter. Cooperstown has been recognized as the cradle of baseball since the 
early 1900s, when A.G. Spalding, the sporting-goods manufacturer, suggested a 
commission be appointed to resolve the question of baseball's birth once and 
for all. In 1907, the seven-member panel announced its decision, which was that 
the first game was played here and that it had been created in largest part by 
one Abner Doubleday, a Civil War hero and a career military officer. 
</P>
<P>
The commission considered lengthy testimony from a number of sources, but its 
conclusion was based largely on the recollections of a man named Abner Graves, 
an elderly mining engineer, who reported that baseball had been "invented" by 
Doubleday between 1839 and 1841. Doubleday wasn't in a position to either 
confirm or deny this; he'd died in 1893 in Mendham, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
In reporting its findings, the commission outlined its reasons for finding that 
Cooperstown was the birthplace of baseball, and praised its star witness, 
referring to Graves as a "reputable gentleman." But years later, there's more 
reason than ever to challenge both conclusions. Among them: About 20 of 
Doubleday's journals survive, but none mentions baseball; Graves was 5 and 
Doubleday 20 when the former claimed the two were classmates; in his final 
years, Graves was judged criminally insane after he shot and killed his wife. 
</P>
<P>
The Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum doesn't answer the question of baseball 
origins any more convincingly than Graves did. But there are fascinating 
exhibits that speak to the game's earliest chapters. In the Cooperstown Room, 
on the museum's ground floor, is a glass case containing the museum's first 
acquisition -- a brown, bruised, crudely shaped baseball literally bursting out 
of its seams. Steven C. Clark Sr., one of Cooperstown's richest and most 
civic-minded citizens, bought the ball for $5 from another local who claimed it 
was one of those used by Doubleday and the boys. Ball in hand, Clark began 
pitching the idea of a baseball museum to a skeptical baseball Commissioner 
Kenesaw Mountain Landis, who began to see the genius of the idea only when 
Clark offered to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Under the heading of relics, there's a gem in the display that traces the 
evolution of baseball equipment. It's the original catcher's mask, invented in 
1876 by the captain of the Harvard College baseball team. While it won't win 
any beauty contests, the mask is a first, and firsts are a rare thing even in 
this building. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Clark, the Hall of Fame's registrar, considers this one of the museum's 
most precious possessions because "it's one of the few things in the collection 
that you actually can point to as the first, the start of all catcher's masks." 
He pauses to consider the enormity of it. "It's almost like seeing the first 
baseball," Clark said. "If such a thing existed, can you imagine how 
overwhelming that would be?" 
</P>
<P>
Clark is one of the museum executives who shoulder the heavy responsibility of 
deciding what new items should be added to the collection. The group, which 
also includes the museum's librarian and curator, meets each Friday to discuss 
letters and calls that have come in with offers of everything from Babe Ruth 
autographed baseballs to a 1925 Hudson automobile whose owner claimed it 
belonged to Ty Cobb. Most offers (the museum does not purchase items) are 
politely turned down on the grounds that the museum already is well-stocked in 
that area. Balls signed by Ruth are particularly plentiful -- Clark estimated 
the museums owns 50 to 60 balls with his signature -- and more are offered 
almost every week. "There's so many out there, it kind of makes you wonder how 
he had time to play baseball," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum accepted 373 items last year, including 15 autographed baseballs, 
four uniforms and five items that fall under the heading of "books and 
publications." Among those gifts was a letter to Jackie Robinson from Sen. John 
F. Kennedy dated July 1, 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Items high on the museum's wish list are old uniforms, especially if they date 
back to the 19th century. "If we could come up with something going back to the 
Cincinnati Red Stockings period, that would be a real coup," Clark said. That's 
not as much of a long shot as it may sound. Three years ago, a man from Ohio 
phoned the museum with an offer of six Chicago Cubs uniforms from 1909, 
including one that had belonged to Hall of Famer Frank Chance. The man's 
grandfather had been a florist in Chicago, and the players, many of whom were 
customers, presented them as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's executives use a rigorous system of checks and double checks to 
satisfy themselves that all the items they accept are the real thing. First, 
they examine the items closely. After you've seen Ruth's signature a couple 
hundred times, it's not too difficult to spot a phony. When it becomes 
necessary, they also quiz the donors to determine things like where they 
obtained the item and from whom. If they don't get the right answers, the gift 
isn't accepted. That's what happened with the Cobb car. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the matter of authenticity is trickier than others. On the first 
floor, in the east wing, most of one wall is given over to a display of 
baseballs from no-hit games dating back to Bob Feller's no-no (Cleveland 1, 
Chicago 0) on April 16, 1940. Most of the balls are autographed, and on some 
the winning pitcher also has scrawled the final score and date. 
</P>
<P>
The problems come in determining just what balls you are looking at. Clark says 
the museum tries to get the last ball used in the game because "there's 
something about the last pitched ball that people will ooh and aah about." But 
it isn't always successful in doing that, according to a random poll of two 
no-hit pitchers who live in the Baltimore area. The museum has the ball used to 
record the last out of Rex Barney's no-hitter. The Baltimore Orioles 
public-address announcer, who pitched for the Brooklyn Dodgers in the 1940s, 
vividly recalls being asked to autograph the ball for display at Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Palmer, on the other hand, says the only place his no-hit ball is on 
display is in his garage -- it's in a plastic bag, along with a baseball from 
his 1966 World Series victory over Sandy Koufax. The most likely explanation is 
that the museum received a ball -- but not THE ball -- from his big game. 
</P>
<P>
There are no doubts about what you are seeing in a special room on the first 
floor, the one with the cathedral ceiling and the bronze faces on the walls. 
The Hall of Fame gallery is quieter than most places in the museum. It's the 
kind of place that makes people think about removing their hats, or maybe 
taking off their shoes. Something about being in the company of Ruth's plaque 
-- or the plaques of Walter "Big Train" Johnson or, yes, Brooks Calbert 
Robinson Jr. -- has that effect on a baseball fan. 
</P>
<P>
This weekend, they'll add two more faces to the collection.
