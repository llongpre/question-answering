THE Barcelona Games are far too friendly. There are no boycotts and no
political protests. Sport's Cold War is over. Instead, the competition is
full of plucky, freshly independent little republics. Barcelona is crawling
with friendly fans from around the globe. Everyone is cheering, no one is
booing.
This niceness is growing wearying. So, this week, I went to the baseball, to
see the US take on Cuba.
Baseball is America's national game, but at the Olympics the US team of
college boys is David against the Goliath of Cuba's amateur world champions.
What I found was a very drab baseball game.
Hospitallet is a glum municipality whose share of the Olympic pork barrel is
a lovely little ball park plonked in a field a mile south of the town's
glummest fringe. There, fans do the Mexican wave even though the stands only
border half the field.
The public address system plays raucous Cajun and country and western music
between innings. And a full house sat unti 1am noisily enjoying a slowly and
badly played game draw to a predictable close long after the last busses and
trains had stopped running.
The college boys started well. They took a 5-0 lead in the first inning
thanks to a home run by Michael Tucker and two fielding errors. Antonio
Pacheco hit a bases loaded home run in the third inning: 5-4.
Suddenly the Americans began to play like the college kids they are rather
than the major league millionaires they will be. They committed one basic
fielding error after another. The score only stayed close because the Cubans
matched them almost error for error.
After Pacheco's home run, I headed for the stands where I was way-layed by
Angelo, Ilyana and Francisco, three Cubans who live in Barcelona. As Cuba
scored twice in the fourth inning to take the lead, their fans danced in the
aisles, shouting, singing and waving flags.
'Everyone here is for Cuba,' said Ilyana. 'The Spaniards are for Cuba. The
children are for Cuba. Even the Americans are for Cuba.'
Well, not quite everyone. Two rows away sat a group from Palm Beach,
Florida, some of them slowly drinking beer. Very occasionally one would aim
a cheerful taunt at the Cuban fans.
They were used to Cubans, said one of the Floridians. 'We've got them coming
in all the time, floating in on boats, guys who couldn't make this baseball
team.'
I sat in an empty seat, notebook in hand. Directly behind me was the biggest
and noisiest American. His first yell almost took my head off. His name was
Scott Benedict.
Benedict had cast a knowledgeable eye over the Cubans. He had timed them
running the previous day and had been impressed by their speed. He also
approved of their approach. 'I like the Cubans. They know how to play the
game.'
The game ended at 1am, 9-6 to Cuba. Fans from around the world, who had come
together to share four hours of tedium, applauded, then went their separate
ways.
