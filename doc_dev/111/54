<LEADPARA>  If you dream of being a big leaguer but have a minor league swing, 10-year-old
Kevin Sullivan has built a baseball pitching machine even a 7-year-old could
master.;    And if you've ever tried reading in bed but found turning the
pages a chore, 80-year-old Richard Stewart has come to the rescue with his
"book tee."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  INVENTORS STRUT THEIR BEST STUFF
CHANGEABLE PUPPET TO 'BOOK TEE,' IT'S HERE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Such products of creative minds, whether practical, whimsical or just plain
odd, can be found at the Museum of Science's annual Inventors Weekend, which
opened Friday. The inventors are diverse in age but have a common drive.;   
"My wife complains I should be out making money, but this has become such an
infatuating thing, it's hard not to do it all the time," said Paul Dupont,
48.;    Sponsored by the Inventors Association of New England, the event began
13 years ago as a Friday evening science program and has expanded since then.;
   Dupont shelved his job as a photographer to create the "unique, furry,
interchangeable toy system," known as UFITS.;    It's either a faceless puppet
head or a hat you wear that has a surface that takes an array of colorful
attachments. UFITS includes cloth eyes, ears, noses and other appendages that
stick like Velcro to make an infinite variety of muppetlike characters.;   
Stewart, of Westbury, Conn., found reading and inventing helped to occupy his
time after he retired as president of the American Brass Co. His "book tee"
solved the discomforts of reading in bed.;    The tee holds the book in a
small wooden frame with pegs. A light from below illuminates the pages.
Stewart admitted he spent five years perfecting the device.;    Fifth-grader
Kevin Sullivan's pitching machine was a labor of love.;    With a little help
from Dad, the youngster nailed an aluminum tube atop a sawhorse and attached a
spring and screwdrivers for levers to create a catapult that pitches balls 10
to 12 feet.  </TEXT>
