   Johns Hopkins University capitalized on Soviet
errors to post a 15-2 victory Wednesday in the first U.S.-Soviet
baseball game ever played on Russian soil.
   Johns Hopkins struck immediately in the first inning, when
lead-off batter Tom Finegan doubled, then scored on two successive
wild wild pitches by the Soviets' Alexei Koshivoy. The Hopkins
squad put the game out of reach in the third when first baseman Dan
Durocher walked, advanced to second on a Koshivoy wild pitch and
scored on a single by second baseman Andy Bernstein.
   After two successive errors loaded the bases, third baseman John
Horner hit a drive that eluded center fielder Alexander
Krupenchenkov and Horner came all the way home to make the score
7-0.
   The Soviets scored their runs in the fifth and seventh innings
on errant pickoff attempts.
   The Soviet team, from the D.I. Mendeleyev Institute of Chemical
Engineering, was outmatched from the start by the Americans'
pitching. As a result, the Soviets had trouble hitting the ball out
of the infield.
   But the matchup seemed to be less a sporting event and more an
exercise in good will, since the Johns Hopkins squad had offered
instruction to the Soviets earlier in the week and given the
Soviets souvenir T-shirts before the game.
   And the American team even provided excuses for their
opposition, noting that the Soviets were hampered because they
practice indoors and have to make do with old gloves made in Cuba
or gloves sewn by hand and field hockey balls and baseballs used
over and over again.
   Still, the crowd of about 300 people in the Lenin Komsomol
Automobile Factory stadium seemed to enjoy the game, cheering both
sides but also whistling in displeasure at the many errors by the
Soviets.
   Johns Hopkins alumnus Max Flaxman, a dealer in skins and hides
in Moscow, is responsible for arranging the game.
   President Reagan, busy elsewhere, was unable to throw out the
first pitch.
   The Soviets began their baseball program in 1987, with an eye on
the Olympics of 1992, when the game will be part of the
competition. A national Soviet squad played a team from Nicaragua
last summer, with disastrous results. The Soviets lost by scores of
22-0 and 30-2.
   But Johns Hopkins Coach Bob Babb said the Soviets are ``making
noticeable improvements each day ... each day they get a little
better.''
   Steven Holland, who is acting as the Johns Hopkins' trainer on
the trip, said that during the joint practice session on Monday,
``even guys who don't speak a word of Russian after a while were
saying ``Molodetz! Molodetz!'' (``Well done! Well done!'') after
the Russians made a good play.''
   Still, other members of the Hopkins squad said they were
surprised at the Russians' lack of basic baseball fundamentals,
such as catching and fielding, although they competed with the
intensity of a Pete Rose, now manager of the Cincinnati Reds, or
Kirk Gibson, an outfielder with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
   ``They have a desire to play. They come out in the snow to
practice. They're really nuts about baseball,'' said Jim Timmerman,
the Johns Hopkins shortstop.
   Horner had said he was impressed by the toughness of the Soviet
players, most of whom are good athletes who play basketball,
volleyball, or compete in track.
   ``I saw one of their pitchers get hit in the back by a line
drive _ one of the hardest I've ever seen hit _ and he didn't even
flinch,'' he said before the game. ``They're not afraid of the
ball.''
   The Soviet media publicized the game and several newspapers ran
stories that caught the spirit of good will.
   A front-page article in Tuesday's editions of the newspaper
Sovietsky Sport carried the headline: ``When the score doesn't
count.''
