<LEADPARA>  Pat Walsh and Jack Bither, avid baseball fans who are teachers and summer camp
instructors at Harker Academy in San Jose, came up with an off-the-wall idea
three years ago.;    They wanted to start a camp program that would give kids
a chance to attend major league baseball games in different cities. And, of
course, Walsh and Bither would be the leaders.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Harold Nichols, the headmaster at the small private school, liked the
concept and gave his OK, Walsh said.;    The camp, for kids from 10 to 14,
began in 1989 with visits to ballparks in California before branching out in
1990 to trips to major-league cities in the Midwest and this year, on the East
Coast.;    Walsh noted that the camp is first offered to Harker students.;   
Campers limited;    "While a large majority of the kids are from Harker, we
have had kids along who don't attend our school," Walsh said.;    Walsh, who
has been accompanied by three chaperons on each trip, said that 33 campers
went on the first trip in 1989; 22 in 1990; and 18 this year. He said the last
two camps have been limited to a maximum of 22 participants.;    "I haven't
heard of another camp for kids like this anywhere," Walsh said. "And neither
had any of the people I talked to at the parks we visited.";    From June
15-24, the campers attended games at Shea and Yankee stadiums in New York,
Memorial Stadium in Baltimore, Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, and Fenway
Park in Boston.;    The group also went to the baseball and basketball halls
of fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., and Springfield, Mass., visited Plymouth Rock in
Plymouth, Mass., and toured New York.;    This year's camp cost $1,475,
compared with $1,195 in 1990 and $450 in 1989. The costs included travel,
hotels (campgrounds in '89), meals, and admission to games and tourist
attractions.;    "It can get expensive, especially when you add what the kids
spend along the way," Walsh said. "We try to make the cost of the camp as
reasonable as possible by looking for the best air and hotel rates available,"
Walsh said.;    Six of this year's campers were from San Jose, three from
Cupertino, two each from Santa Clara, Sunnyvale and Saratoga, and one each
from Campbell, Fremont and San Carlos.;    Sam Stapleton, a former Harker
student approaching his junior year at St. Francis High School in Mountain
View, was a counselor on this year's tour.;    "One of my jobs this year was
to take a head count every time we went somewhere," Stapleton said. "We came
up short only once, when one of our campers was still walking around in the
Basketball Hall of Fame when we were getting ready to leave.";    Walsh said
they have yet to lose a camper.;    "Going on these trips has made me more of
a baseball fan than I was two years ago," camper Ryan Sommer said.;    "It was
a fun experience watching the A's play at Fenway Park; the fans were pretty
hostile there, especially toward (A's right-fielder) Jose Canseco.";    The
A's lost, 3-2.;    This year's trip was the first for Ed Luchessi.;    "I
couldn't believe there would be anything available like this for kids," said
Luchessi, who just completed the sixth grade at St. Andrew's School in
Saratoga. "Visiting all the parks, the World Trade Center in New York City,
eating cheese steaks for the first time at the game in Philadelphia -- it was
a fantastic experience.";    Walsh said he is considering putting together a
trip next year to attend games in Houston, St. Louis, Kansas City, Mo.,
Milwaukee, and Minneapolis.;    "I'm looking into the possibility of going by
train," Walsh said. "And, maybe in two or three years, we'll go to Canada to
see games in Toronto and Montreal.";    Trip of dreams; (box) June 15 -- Flew
