   The first baseball team from the Soviet Union
to visit the United States may not have defensive whizzes or
offensive sluggers. But there's no question about its eagerness.
   The team interrupted its first sight-seeing tour of the nation's
capital to watch the major-league playoffs.
   ``They didn't want to be rude, but the older players wanted to
watch the game (Game 4 between the Oakland Athletics and the Boston
Red Sox),'' said Rick Spooner, an American who serves as the coach
of the Soviet team.
   The opportunities this week to watch the playoffs has been a big
part of the trip for a team playing a game that is only 1{ years
old in the Soviet Union.
   ``Constantly we're trying to watch,'' said Andrei Borodin, the
team's coach and first baseman. ``If there's any possibility, we
stay in front of the game all the time.''
   The Soviet team, which hails from the Mendeleyev Institute of
Chemical Technology, played the first U.S.-Soviet baseball game in
the United States on Wednesday against a Johns Hopkins University
squad.
   The Soviets lost, 16-0.
   They committed 11 errors.
   They had no hits.
   They did have six baserunners, one on an error, five on walks,
but the game was never close. The Johns Hopkins team scored eight
unearned runs in the first inning _ on only four hits.
   The results weren't much different when a team from Johns
Hopkins visited the Soviet Union recently. The U.S. team soundly
beat Mendeleyev, considered the strongest Soviet team, in all three
games. The Americans also gave clinics and other instruction to
their Russian counterparts.
   The Mendeleyevs went on to win four baseball tournaments this
year, playing throughout the Soviet Union.
   ``When I was there I said they were comparable to a junior
varsity high school team,'' said Johns Hopkins Coach Bob Babb.
``Now I'd say they're equivalent to a high school team. And a
pretty good high school team when they put all their best people on
the field.''
   The defensive skills of the game have come slowest to the
Soviets.
   ``Their fielding, hitting cutoffs, fly balls, still give them
trouble,'' Babb said. ``But their hitting has improved
tremendously.''
   The Soviet Union would like to field a baseball team in the 1992
Summer Olympics.
   ``If we follow the course of our basketball players, it will
take 5-7 years and we will be playing with the best teams in
Europe,'' Bogatiryov said. ``I can't talk about the Americans.''
   Still, the game against Americans was important.
   ``I think they're feeling the pressure of this game,'' Babb
said. ``They're here trying to represent the Soviet Union in our
sport. They believe they must make a good showing to get the
support they need back home.''
   There are no baseball fields in the Soviet Union. When Johns
Hopkins played the Soviets on Russian soil, the two teams played on
a soccer field with a chalk-drawn circle for a pitcher's mound.
   So, the Johns Hopkins' facility _ a diamond with dugouts and a
batting cage _ is one not to be wasted. An extra daily practice has
already been squeezed into the Soviets' schedule.
   ``They'd like to stay out on the field all day,'' Spooner said.
   What do they think of the playoffs?
   ``They're awed,'' Babb said. ``They ask a lot of questions, `Why
(do) things happen in a game?' Having studied the game game for
only a year and a half, to see the strength of these players
boggles their minds.''
