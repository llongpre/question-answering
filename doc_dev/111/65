   President Bush joined the celebration Tuesday
for the Trumbull, Conn., Little League baseball team that brought
the world championship back to the United States.
   Bush, a former Little League coach, used the Rose Garden
ceremony to urge the 12-year-olds to emulate the example of
baseball great Lou Gehrig.
   The U.S. Postal Service recently issued a stamp commemorating
the 50th anniversary of Gehrig's final season, and Bush presented
the original painting of Gehrig to an official of the Baseball Hall
of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   Bush said the Trumbull team, which defeated a favored Taiwan
team at the Little League World Series in Williamsport, Pa., in
August, displayed ``a spirit which says that nothing is impossible,
in Little League or in the bigger fields of life.''
   Trumbull became the first U.S. squad to capture the title in six
years.
   Bush said the youngsters had learned ``the lessons of Little
League: lessons like friendship and generosity; like do-unto-others
and doing your best; lessons which go beyond balls and strikes and
which have made Little League a global institution.''
   Little League baseball, which marked its 50th anniversary this
year, is played by 2{ million youths in 33 nations, Bush said.
   Bush called Gehrig, a Hall of Fame first baseman for the New
York Yankees in the 1920s and 1930s, ``a hero of mine.''
   Gehrig set a consecutive games record that still stands. The
streak ended when Gehrig was struck by the paralyzing disease that
bears his name.
   Even in the face of that fatal ailment, Gehrig told a crowd at
his retirement in Yankee Stadium on July 4, 1939, ``I consider
myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.''
   ``That story has become an American parable. What an example for
these kids,'' said Bush, adding that Gehrig spent much of the last
two years of his life counseling youngsters as parole commissioner
for the city of New York.
   ``He showed, like Little League, that what matters is how we
conduct ourselves off, as well as on, the field,'' Bush said.
   Bush shook hands with Coach Tom Galla and his entire squad.
   ``You truly are No. 1,'' the president said.
   The Trumbull team has been invited to appear in uniform Sunday
at the second game of the World Series between San Francisco and
Oakland, if parents can afford the trip.
   Bush, who had hoped to see the Series himself, apparently has
decided the West Coast is too far to go to throw out a ball.
   ``I'm afraid I might not get to go now,'' he told reporters as
he left the Rose Garden.
