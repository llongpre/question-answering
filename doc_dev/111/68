<LEADPARA>  It was 10 days before doctors could assure William Roe that his son Billy
wasn't going to lose his left eye -- but that it might be permanently
damaged.;    The 11-year-old got hit by a pitch in May while batting during a
Little League practice game in Warwick, N.Y. His retina was torn and the eye
socket badly fractured; doctors now say he may never be able to see more than
blurred shapes with the eye.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Every year, baseball accounts for about 6,500 eye injuries to children ages
5 to 14, whether it's in Little League or a sandlot game. At least 18,000
other kids wind up in emergency rooms with facial injuries, according to the
National Society to Prevent Blindness and the Consumer Product Safety
Commission.;    Medical experts say these injuries could be avoided in Little
League if kids were required to wear a protective face guard that costs
$13.50. But many coaches and parents don't know about the face guards, and
Little League Headquarters -- though it approves the guards for sanctioned
play -- refuses to make them mandatory.;    "The number of injuries which
require medical treatment is minute when you compare it to the 2.5 million who
play," said Steve Keener, spokesman for the 168,000-team League. "There's also
a cost factor involved. Teams already have to raise the money for everything,
and it could put some leagues out of commission.";    Mounting a campaign; 
The face guards were the subject of a news conference Tuesday by Lorine
Caveness, inventor of the Home Safe face guard, and representatives of medical
and dental groups. They are mounting a publicity campaign to make the face
guards, which attach to the protective batting helmet already worn by all
organized baseball players, mandatory for Little League ball.;    Also present
was Richard Hilton, coach of the East Marietta, Ga., Little League team that
has required the masks since 1981.;    "Since our league starting using face
guards, we have eliminated a major part of the baseball player's enemy -- fear
of the ball," said Hilton, whose team won the 1983 Little League world
championship.;    Not well accepted;  In Santa Clara County, Bob Bernhart,
assistant administrator for District 44 Little League, said he has not seen
face guards used in tournament or district games in "three or four years.";   
Jim Phillips, Campbell Little League president, says he bought two dozen face
guards for his team three years ago. They are sitting in his equipment room,
unused.;    "The kids wouldn't wear them and we never enforced them," Phillips
said. "They wouldn't wear them for a bunch of reasons, but the main thing with
10- and 11-year-olds was that they thought (the face guards) didn't look
right.";    Phillips is in favor of using the face guards but says kids won't
wear them until Little League Headquarters makes them mandatory for sanctioned
games.;    Caveness blames the lack of acceptance of the guard on vanity. "If
the pros don't wear 'em, kids don't want to either," she said.;    Some major
league players have worn face guards -- but only after sustaining serious
injuries, and then not for long.;    The clear thermoplastic guard covers the
mouth, chin and nose. It costs about $13.50, or $28.95 for a helmet and face
guard package, Caveness said.;    Vest also developed;  Other safety equipment
is being developed for young players.;    Mike Carroll, a businessman and
coach in Jackson, Miss., has designed a protective vest that can help take the
sting out of a wild pitch.;    Carroll claims his vests, made of foam strips
and nylon, can reduce a ball's impact by 30 percent.  </TEXT>
