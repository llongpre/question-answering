   President Bush scoffs at the notion that his
season-opening pitch to Orioles' catcher Mickey Tettleton was a
high and wide. ``He caught it before it started breaking,'' Bush
protests.
   With guest Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and a sellout
Memorial Stadium crowd of 52,161 watching, Bush tossed the first
ball in Monday's American League opener between Baltimore and the
Boston Red Sox.
   Bush, captain of the 1948 Yale baseball team and an enthusistic
lifetime fan, threw the ball lefthanded from the mound. Standing in
his shirtsleeves with his jacket removed and a glove on his right
hand, Bush hurled the ball without benefit of a windup.
   Tettleton, who had moved several feet in front of home plate for
the presidential pitch, gloved the curve ball with a long reach
over his right shoulder.
   Over hot dogs, hamburgers and soft drinks, Bush discussed that
pitch _ his first game-opener as president _ with Mubarak and other
guests and reporters in his glass-enclosed box over third base,
voicing mock dismay over a reporter's suggestion that it was ``high
and outside.''
   Turning to baseball great Ted Williams, a longtime Bush friend,
Bush said: ``Here's an objective judge. What did you think, sir?''
After a pause, Williams said: ``High, hard, fast ball.''
   Bush then asked ``another objective visitor,'' baseball
commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti. ``Superb,'' Giamatti said,
adding he hadn't seen the pitch but had heard about it from
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who ``said it was
wonderful.''
   Bush and Muburak left after the fifth inning, when Baltimore led
1-0, missing most of the action. The final score was Baltimore 5,
Red Sox 4 in 11 innings.
   Mubarak, putting on an Orioles hat for photogrpahers, said he
was enjoying both his hot dog lunch and his first live baseball
game, calling Bush ``a very good teacher.''
   ``He was the captain of the biggest team in the United States,''
Mubarak said.
   ``That's what I told him,'' Bush interjected.
   At Yale, first baseman Bush was known more for his fielding than
his hitting.
   Bush was asked if Monday's game brought back memories from his
youth. ``This was fun, yeah,'' he said.
