For this baseball fan, the season began with all the promise of a sunny
April afternoon. On opening day at Yankee Stadium, the home team put on a
display that signalled a year filled with tantalising possibilities.
Four months later, my summer ended on an ambivalent note, far away from the
top tier of the professional ranks, where play has been brought to a halt by
a player strike. At Skylands Park, 65 miles west of New York city, the New
Jersey Cardinals were showcasing the scrappy brand of baseball which
attracted thousands of new fans to 'minor league' ballparks this year.
This year was marked by a rebirth of sorts for the minor leagues, where
small-town clubs such as New Jersey helped fill the void left by the strike
for millions of disenfranchised fans.
The walkout - which involves players on the 28 teams which comprise the
American and National leagues - is in its fifth week. It has forced the
cancellation of hundreds of games. With only 23 days left in the regular
schedule, there is no agreement in sight.
The cessation of play could not have come at a worse time. Even if a
settlement is forthcoming, the strike has already spoiled a season in which
some of baseball's hallowed individual records were threatened for the first
time in decades.
The strike proved to be a windfall for the 200 or so minor league teams
which play in the relative obscurity of small cities and towns across the US
and Canada.
The main purpose of these 'farm' teams - most of which are independently
owned - is to cultivate young talent for the major leagues. In exchange for
an operating subsidy, each club fields players who can be moved around the
parent club's organisation at any time.
This year, the minor leagues carried their role to its logical conclusion.
The strike forced television networks that feature baseball as their
programming mainstay to turn in desperation to the farm system.
ESPN, the 24-hour sports channel, twice called on the Birmingham Barons of
the double-A (triple-A is the highest minor league level) Southern League to
fill embarrassing holes in its schedule. Why the Barons? Its left-fielder
happens to be a former professional basketballer by the name of Michael
Jordan.
Jordan's decision to try his hand at baseball this spring, brought a wave of
welcome publicity to the minors, but he deserves only a small part of the
credit for the farm system's season in the sun. After a long decline which
began in the 1960s, minor-league teams have been enjoying a steady
resurgence in popularity over the last few seasons.
In 1993, total attendance at minor-league games reached 32m, up from 10m in
the 1960s, when television introduced major-league action to the
hinterlands. Today, new minor-league ball parks such as Skylands are
springing up across the country, as local and state governments trip over
one another to entice franchises to their areas.
The reasons behind this resurgence are complex. In part, the farm teams have
benefited from a disenchantment with big league baseball which has been
bubbling just below the surface for years. The strike has further sullied
the image of a sport in which the median player salary is Dollars 500,000
(Pounds 322,600) and billionaire owners are suspected of cooking their books
to show operational losses.
As a consequence, young farm hands - who earn Dollars 1,400 a month plus
Dollars 18 a day in meal money - seem more like the idealised 'boys of
summer' than their big-league counterparts. Most minor leaguers support the
strike and, to a man, hope one day to make it to 'The Show'. But in the
friendly confines of a small stadium like Skylands, it is easy to imagine
the Cards are playing baseball for the sheer enjoyment of it. At least one
very rich Baron is certainly doing just that.
Economics has played a big role, too. Salaries are lower, and so are tickets
and refreshments. Families of average means - most of whom now live in the
suburbs - can enjoy professional baseball without the expense and
inconvenience of travelling to the big city.
At Skylands Park, the family event sphere seemed more like a county
fairground than a big-league ball-yard. The good-natured crowd was equally
divided between pre-teens - girls as well as boys - and their
thirtysomething parents. Beer drinkers were thin on the ground.
The atmosphere contrasted sharply with opening day at Yankee Stadium, where
players on the field had to compete for attention with the numerous brawls
which erupted in the grandstands.
