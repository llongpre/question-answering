   Little League Baseball announced Tuesday a
program to allow disabled children nationwide to play baseball and
softball in a new division starting next year.
   Called the Challenger Division, the program is aimed at
youngsters aged 6 through 18 with physical and mental disabilities.
   ``Every child should have the cherished opportunity to wear a
Little League uniform and that is the goal of the Challenger
Division,'' said Creighton J. Hale, president of Little League
Baseball. ``We are simply extending the benefits of Little League
participation to disabled children and filling a void that has
existed in their lives.''
   The program was unveiled at a news conference in the Capitol
office of Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., who served as
chairman of a task force formed by Little League Baseball in 1988
to develop the program.
   ``One of childhood's most treasured experiences is Little League
baseball participation,'' said Dole, who was an athlete in college
before suffering disabling injuries in World War II. ``Now ...
every child can enjoy our great summer game and learn lessons that
will last a lifetime.''
   The Challenger Division was inspired by baseball programs for
the disabled that parents started in four cities, the first of
which began in Brockton, Mass., in 1985. A similar program was
formed in Bristol, Conn. in 1986, with others now in Spring, Texas
and Louisville, Ky.
   ``I can't tell you the joy and pleasure and sheer rhapsody of
these kids being able to participate in America's No. 1 sport,''
said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., who served on the Little League task
force and has thrown out the opening baseball to start the summer
league in Brockton the past three years.
   One of the organizers of the Connecticut program, Ed Beardsley,
and his 11-year-old son, David, attended the ceremony. David,
dressed in his uniform, presented a book with team pictures to
Kerry.
   Ten-year-old Joe DeLaRosa, of Spring, Texas, who has spina
bifida, gave a baseball jersey and cap to the senator. Tuesday was
Joe's birthday.
   ``It's been great,'' said Brenda DeLaRosa, his mother.
``Baseball has always been his favorite sport.''
   Participants in the Challenger Division will play with the same
equipment and on the same field as used in other Little League
games. However, Hale said the rules are more flexible to allow
local programs to tailor games to meet the needs and skills of
participating youngsters.
   The new division allows for a ``buddy system'' in which
volunteers, often players from other Little League divisions, can
assist disabled players at bat and in the field. For example, a
volunteer can push a wheelchair-bound player around the base paths
or help in retrieving balls.
   Hale did not know how many cities would establish programs for
the disabled in the 1990 season, but said a future goal is to have
a World Series championship for the Challenger Division.
