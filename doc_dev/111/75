   One of the most celebrated criminal cases of 1990 - the
securities-violation prosecution of Michael Milken - fell into the
hands of one of the youngest federal judges.
   Kimba M. Wood, at 46 the youngest U.S. jurist in Manhattan,
handled the Milken affair with a veteran's aplomb and toughness,
before finally sentencing the deposed junk-bond king to 10 years in
prison, a stiff term that surprised many observers.
   Beforehand, the judge held an unusual hearing into Milken's
alleged crimes, opening up wounds the defense had hoped to close by
arranging a plea bargain for their client.
   In the end, she humbled the ex-billionaire, telling him he
should be ``removed from society'' for abusing ``his leadership
position.''
   Born in Port Townsend, Wash., Wood went on to study at the
Sorbonne in Paris, Connecticut College, the London School of
Economics and Harvard University. Before ascending to the bench,
she practiced antitrust law in Washington and New York.

   Gilbert Hyatt rose from obscurity to the headlines in 1990 when
it was revealed he had received a patent for the microprocessor,
the computer-on-a-chip that acts as the brains of personal
computers.
   Hyatt, a bearded, soft-spoken Southern California engineer,
battled the U.S. Patent Office for two decades before he finally
received recognition for his invention.
   News of the patent caused a stir in the computer industry, which
officially recognizes several Intel Corp. engineers as the
developers of the microprocessor during the late 1960s, the same
time Hyatt made his breakthrough.
   Hyatt, 52, says he waged the patent battle more to set history
straight than to gain riches. Nevertheless, industry experts
predict he could receive many millions of dollars in royalties from
computer chip makers.

<HEAD>JED DRAKE</HEAD>

   Americans watched the American pastime in a new way in 1990, and
baseball-loving Jed Drake was the man behind it.
   Drake, 34, is coordinating producer of ESPN's major-league
baseball coverage. In the first season of a four-year deal, the
cable station emerged as the ``network of baseball,'' telecasting
161 regular-season games, providing blanket coverage in a way never
done before.
   ``What we have to remember is that our audience is going to
expect more from us,'' Drake said. ``We can't just have good
coverage. We have to have great coverage.''
   Access to live feeds from all ballparks enabled ESPN to switch
back and forth from stadium to stadium, to show the final minutes
of a no-hitter, for example. It was a technique the network
perfected in its years of covering the NCAA basketball tournament.
   Drake, a Boston University graduate, has been with ESPN for 10
years and won a cable ACE Award for his 1987 America's Cup
coverage.
   ``Everybody that's working on baseball has a love for the
game,'' Drake said. ``That's probably the glue that's going to hold
this project together.''
