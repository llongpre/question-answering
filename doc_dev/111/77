California Angels management recently decided to erect a six-foot-high 
chain-link fence to keep fans away from players who, after games, have to make 
their way from the stadium to the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
The new fence runs from the stadium near Gate 7 to another fenced-off area 
where players park their automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
Until the barrier was built three weeks ago, Anaheim was one of the last 
stadiums in the major leagues where fans -- if they wanted to wait outside 
after a game -- could walk up to a player and ask for an autograph or just ask 
a question. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to Angels officials, the unrestrained fans mobbed and stampeded 
team members. It got out of hand, and the players complained. Up went the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
One woman was so intent on getting Wally Joyner's autograph that she rammed his 
automobile, said Kevin Uhlich, the Angels stadium operations director. 
</P>
<P>
"It became too much of a problem. The players were being bombarded, crowded and 
stampeded by the fans," Uhlich said. "Something had to be done." 
</P>
<P>
Fans called The Times to complain that it was just another move by management 
to keep them away from the players. An editor sent me to Anaheim Stadium last 
Sunday to see how the fence was working. 
</P>
<P>
Watching youngsters hang on the barrier and call out to players dredged up some 
childhood memories of a baseball that sat on my dresser at home. On the 
horsehide was the signature of Yogi Berra, one of my childhood heroes. The 
baseball was not important; the signature was. Because of Yogi, I spent four 
summers crouched behind home plate ducking bats and balls. 
</P>
<P>
That ball came into my life so long ago that the line between fact and fantasy 
might have become blurred. I think it was the 1949 World Series between the 
Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Yankees at Ebbets Field. I vaguely remember 
hanging over the railing with my dad during pregame batting practice calling 
out Yogi's name. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Yogi stopped what he was doing and came over to the railing. He took 
the pen and signed the ball. Or maybe, as my sister once suggested, dad bought 
the ball from a stadium vendor with Yogi's signature already on it. 
</P>
<P>
The Yogi baseball shared the sacred altar atop my dresser with mementos from 
some of my all-time favorite players -- Harold (Pee Wee) Reese, John (The Big 
Cat) Mize, Stan Musial and Joe DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
I can remember listening to baseball games on the radio in my bedroom and 
studying the mementos on top of the dresser. They were an important part of my 
life then. 
</P>
<P>
It would be a shame if the new fence in any way impedes a youngster from 
getting the autograph of his or her baseball hero. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Winfield, Mr. Winfield," the youngsters called through the fence as the 
superstar walked by on the other side of the fence. "Please sign this. Please." 
</P>
<P>
Luis Polonia stopped by the fence. A crowd gathered. He signed autograph after 
autograph as the gloves, baseball cards and programs were passed over the 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
I can't remember when I last saw my Yogi baseball, but I fear it has been lost 
forever during one of the many moves. But its memories are still there.
