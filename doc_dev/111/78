<LEADPARA>  THERE WERE four Little Leaguers and two dads practicing on the elementary
school diamond when we got there, so my friends and I warmed up on an adjacent
field until there was a break in the action. Then John, who was appointed our
unofficial team captain when he showed up with the only bat, sauntered over to
one of the dads and suggested we join forces, choose up sides, and play a
game.;    With just six players on a side, anything to right field was
considered a foul ball until two guys who were watching the action asked if
they could play.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The ground rules changed almost every inning after that as players came and
left throughout the afternoon, and as new situations developed.;    When the
game score reached a little versus a lot, we stopped, chose up new teams, and
started a new game.;    In other words, a typical pick-up baseball game.;    I
got hooked on playing pick-up baseball a couple of summers ago when a buddy
agreed to pitch batting practice for me after I went an embarrassing 0-for-4
in a league softball game.;    He showed up at the field with his
nine-year-old daughter -- who's got the sweetest swing I've ever seen from an
amateur player -- and his girlfriend, who swore she wasn't any good at sports.
We all took turns pitching, swinging the bat, and shagging balls until dark,
and had so much fun we decided to call up a few more friends and return the
following weekend.;    Pick-up games especially appeal to me because there
generally are fewer players on the field than during organized league games,
which means each player gets to bat more often and has the opportunity to be
involved in more plays.;    I quit the softball team when I realized I liked
getting exercise much more than I enjoyed standing around listening to my
teammates argue with the umpires.;    I also like the flexibility involved
with the sport. After hustling to fit too many appointments into my schedule
and scrambling all week to meet deadlines, I want to relax on the weekends and
play ball when I want to.;    Whether you play a full game or hold a practice
session depends on how many others show up on the field. I've gone to the
school yard to play catch with a friend and ended up joining games already in
progress. I've also played in games that kept accepting new players until we
had so many people that we had to split the group into two games.;    The
rules and etiquette of pick-up softball and baseball haven't changed since you
were a kid, no matter how long ago that was. In most areas small groups can
play on just about any public school field or diamond after school hours as
long as it hasn't been already been reserved by a team or organization.;   
But if you get together a team of co-workers, for example, and want to play on
a particular field regularly, your group needs to get a permit from the school
district, according to Marilyn Orr of the Santa Clara Unified School
District.;    "If it's an ongoing thing, like Little League practice, we do
need to know about it," Orr said. "Otherwise it's no problem. The fields are
open to the public.";    In fact, the only real rule I know of for pickup
games is to be flexible and willing to change ground rules accordingly. Don't
take yourself, or the game too seriously, and you'll be sure to have some
serious fun.  </TEXT>
