<LEADPARA>  Q If you go to a baseball game and catch a ball you get to keep it, if you go
to a football game and catch a ball you get to keep it, when you go to a
basketball game and catch the ball you have to give it back. How come?;

<TEXT>  (hbox); A Simple economics. "Too costly," an NBA spokeswoman said. Basketballs
sometimes sail into the stands a dozen or so times a game and, at $64.99 a
ball, that could add up to quite an expense. Footballs don't find their way
into the stands nearly as often with NFL teams raising a net behind the goal
posts on field goals and extra points. The net is to keep fans from being
injured fighting for the ball, a league spokesman said, but chances are the
cost of a regulation NFL football -- $59.99 -- is a factor as well. A major
league-approved baseball costs $8.99.; SPORTS FACT; Fewest NHL penalties
