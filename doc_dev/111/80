<LEADPARA>  THERE'S going to be a special auction of highly collectible sports memorabilia
today at the Oakland Coliseum Exhibit Hall, and the most obvious explanation
is that its organizer -- A's Manager Tony La Russa -- had the perfect
connections for stockpiling a sensational inventory.;   But La Russa put a
different spin on how the event came together.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The generosity has been unbelievable," he said. "I'm trying to think how
I'm going to thank everybody.";   The auction is a fund-raiser for the Animal
Rescue Foundation, an organization La Russa helped found. The goal is to build
an animal shelter in Contra Costa County and reduce the number of animals that
have to be destroyed because of a vast overpopulation of domestic pets.;  
There's a $5 admission charge for the event, but parking is free. It starts at
noon with a silent auction -- that means checking written offers for displayed
items and then deciding to write down a higher bid -- and the live auction is
scheduled for 2 p.m.;   The list of items gathered by La Russa for the live
auction is as long as it is awesome. Here are some of the highlights:;  
(check) A game-used, autographed Bo Jackson Chicago White Sox jersey.;  
(check) A game-used, autographed pair of sneakers from Michael Jordan.;  
(check) A game-used, autographed Jose Canseco bat.;   (check) A Super Bowl
XXIII football signed by Bill Walsh and George Seifert.;   (check) A helmet
from the Oakland Fire Department -- with relief ace Dennis Eckersley's name,
number and signature.;   (check) An autographed Joe Montana jersey (but not
game-used).;   (check) Official American League baseballs autographed by
hockey star Wayne Gretzky and "Field of Dreams" actor Kevin Costner.;  
(check) A glove used by third baseman Carney Lansford during the 1989 World
Series and signed by the other A's infielders.;   (check) The green A's jacket
that La Russa has worn through All-Star Games and World Series --
conspicuously authentic, he pointed out, as indicated by a broken zipper and
frayed sleeves. He autographed it, too.;   (check) Two spring-training trips
that include the chance to serve as an A's coach for a day. One is before the
start of exhibition games, but the other includes a couple of innings coaching
first base.;   There also will be items from the Warriors, the Sharks and
tennis stars including Martina Navratilova, plus an array of autographed bats
(some new and some game-used) from players including Mark McGwire, Joe Carter,
Kevin Mitchell and perhaps baseball's hottest star in the collectibles market,
Frank Thomas. Some items should be affordable for the average collector, too.;
  La Russa seems certain to generate a lot of attention among collectors and
investors, but please, remember that the auction is based on raising support
for a good cause.;   If you just want to send a donation to the foundation,
write to P.O. Box 21546, Concord, CA 94521.  </TEXT>
