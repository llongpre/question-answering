HALL OF FAME IS THE NAME OF THE GAME

<P>
It is possible that television viewers watching Jim Palmer's induction into 
baseball's Hall of Fame Sunday won't recognize him with his pants on. 
</P>
<P>
Jim did well in pants, but better when he removed them, appearing in ads and 
commercials for years in his undergarment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a crazy world," he confided. "I won 20 games eight times (for Baltimore). 
I won the Cy Young Award three times. And there was more written and said over 
my being seen in my Jockeys." 
</P>
<P>
Logic would dictate he appear in that attire at Cooperstown where, with his 
colleague, Joe Morgan, the two will be decorated in a sort of all-ESPN show. 
</P>
<P>
By that is meant Palmer and Morgan work as baseball analysts for ESPN, which 
will air the Hall of Fame telecast at 2:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Of Morgan's 22 years in the majors, eight were spent in Cincinnati where he 
served from 1972 to 1978 as teammate of Pete Rose, for whom he fosters a soft 
spot today. 
</P>
<P>
"Making the Hall of Fame is the high point of my baseball life," Morgan says. 
"I am proud. I am ecstatic. I am also touched with guilt that I should get into 
the Hall so easily (on the first vote) while Pete is buried under so much 
trouble and must battle to get into the Hall at all." 
</P>
<P>
Rose isn't yet eligible for admittance, but when he is some argue that baseball 
shouldn't recognize a son who has bet on games. He also failed to pay income 
tax, an oversight that got him five months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
"Pete and I 'lockered' together for eight years," says Morgan. I don't think 
anyone in baseball knows him better than I do. I studied him on the field every 
day. He was the most dedicated player I've seen. I felt I was dedicated. But 
there were times I let up, as most players do. 
</P>
<P>
"But Pete? Never. He played every game as if it were the seventh game of the 
World Series. His lifetime ambition, his dream, his obsession, was to get into 
the Hall of Fame. Now it's anyone's guess." 
</P>
<P>
"If you voted," Morgan is asked, "what would be your verdict?" 
</P>
<P>
"You can't overlook his sins" he responds. "Tax fraud is serious business. And 
betting is against the rules. But I feel that what he did on the field, and 
what he did off the field, can be separated. There is also room for 
forgiveness. He never bet against his own team. He never threw a game. And tax 
problems needn't be related to baseball." 
</P>
<P>
"Then you would be more lenient than some of the voters indicate they will be?" 
</P>
<P>
"The same guys finger-wagging at Pete Rose will forgive drug-users, alcoholics, 
wife-beaters, cop-fighters and deadbeats. I hope they are equally charitable 
when Pete comes up for the Hall of Fame vote." 
</P>
<P>
Morgan confides he saw Palmer as an automatic selection for the Hall of Fame on 
the first ballot, but suffered serious misgivings about himself. 
</P>
<P>
"A pitcher is more visible than an infielder," says Morgan. "What an infielder 
does to win games for his team isn't always as obvious. My lifetime batting 
average ran only .271. And I got fewer than 3,000 hits." 
</P>
<P>
"Then what was your secret?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
"My secret," he answers, "is that I did the right thing at the right time. It 
took a knowledgeable voter to realize this. And I am gratified that enough 
knowledgeable voters participated." 
</P>
<P>
Engaged in baseball on television since 1985, Morgan is new to ESPN, having 
previously served NBC, ABC and the Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
Also a first-year man on ESPN, Palmer tilled an oar previously at ABC. 
</P>
<P>
If Morgan's glove is solicited for the Hall of Fame Museum, you have to assume 
a request will be made for Palmer's shorts. 
</P>
<P>
At department stores, Jim used to autograph them for women shoppers, who 
weren't especially in the market for a pair of shorts -- but hoped that Palmer 
went with them.
