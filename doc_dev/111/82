<LEADPARA>  Kendall Simmons' return to baseball may have prompted a new training
technique: take a season off then play as if you hadn't.;    Any thoughts that
Simmons couldn't shed the rust from sitting out the 1990 baseball season to
succeed in basketball at Gonzaga University were erased in a big way in March.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Fresh off the basketball team, the former Palo Alto High star's first
action came against Oklahoma at the Spartan Classic, a tournament sponsored by
San Jose State. Summoned by Coach Steve Hertz to pinch-hit in the ninth inning
of a 4-1 loss, Simmons promptly banged out a single.;    He got a start in
left field the next day against Colorado State and had the type of game that
makes spring training seem as unnecessary as another speeding ticket for Jose
Canseco.;    In his first at-bat, Simmons spanked a home run to center field.
He finished the day with two other singles to go 3 for 5. In the field, he
merely threw two runners out at second base and one out at third. Not
coincidentally, the Zags won 17-4.;    "That was a pretty humongous start,"
Simmons said. "That doesn't happen to too many people.";    Replacing his
hightops with cleats is nothing new to Simmons. He has been going from
basketball to baseball ever since he can remember. And he had always done it
without skipping a beat.;    In fact, in his sophomore season at De Anza
College, Simmons averaged 20 points, seven rebounds and five assists in
basketball, then nearly hit .400 in baseball.;    The difference this time is
that he didn't play baseball last season. Simmons cut a deal with the Gonzaga
coaches in 1989 to concentrate on basketball his junior season and redshirt
the following baseball season. That way, though he just completed his
eligibility in basketball, he will be able to play baseball through the 1992
season.;    "The basketball coach (Dan Fitzgerald) and I work real well
together," Hertz said. "In a place like ours, you have to work together
because we're gonna get guys who will play both.";    Simmons said the coaches
have been understanding.;    "The day basketball season ended," he said,
"Coach Hertz told me exactly what's going to be happening. He worked with me
to make me feel comfortable.";    However, Simmons hasn't felt too comfortable
at the plate in recent games. In other words, don't expect him to keep up the
pace of his first two outings -- this season or next. Miracles just don't
happen often in baseball. When you get off to such an explosive start, the
only way to go is down.;    And the year off is beginning to affect Simmons.
Through 25 games, he was hitting .253 with three homers and 14 RBIs. Included
in that tailspin was an 0 for 13 slump.;    "It is affecting me now," Simmons
admitted. "The past couple of weeks, I have been swinging at a lot of pitches
that I shouldn't be swinging at. I was hitting .400 until (recently). I was
probably getting too comfortable.";    Said Hertz, "That's baseball. It's an
up-and-down game. That's why they play 162 games, to see who is the best.
Kendall hasn't played the game a lot because he took the year off. But he's
working hard and making adjustments.";    Simmons' hitting should stabilize a
bit as he gets more at-bats. Though the college season is almost over, Simmons
said he will play this summer for the Humboldt Crabs, a semipro team based in
Arcata. Once he returns to school, he will work out with the Gonzaga team
throughout the fall and winter.;    The prospect of concentrating solely on
baseball makes Simmons eager to see just what he'll be able to accomplish next
season.;    "I just can't wait to see what happens," he said.  </TEXT>
