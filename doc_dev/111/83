   ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' (Walt Disney Home Video. VHS-Beta,
$22.99. Rated PG)
   
   How nice to see the silly and easy ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids''
available to the video watcher. It's a light, improbable adventure
with lots of family and human values.
   The movie stars Rick Moranis (``Ghostbusters II,'' ``Little Shop
of Horrors'') as Wayne Szalinski, a scientist whose inventions
gather laughs rather than loot. His latest is an incredible
shrinking machine. He presents it at a symposium but his colleagues
only snicker.
   Meanwhile, back at his chaotic home, his son and daughter and
the neighbors' two boys accidentally find themselves in front of
the machine, which has been activated when a baseball crashes
through the attic window. Poof! The little tykes soon become just
that _ \-inch tall.
   Dad returns in a bitter frenzy and smashes his invention. Glass
flies everywhere, and the wee ones run for their lives between the
cavernous cracks in the floorboards. Then dad decides to neaten up
a bit and sweeps the smashed machine and the kiddies into a plastic
garbage bag and takes same to the trash cans on the street.
   But this is a fearless foursome. They cut themselves free with a
sliver of glass and set out on a little adventure to return home.
Suddenly, an ordinary backyard becomes a jungle of unknown terrors.
The sprinkler system is like the Hoover Dam bursting open; a
scorpion is the same as facing down a Tyrannosaurus rex during
prehistoric times; an ant is like a wild horse that is easily tamed
and becomes a mascot; a Lego toy offers refuge; and a stale cookie
is a feast for millions.
   The predicament brings out the best in the two sets of kids, who
before being zapped pretty much hated each other: Amy (Amy O'Neill)
and Nick (Robert Oliveri) Szalinski, and Ron (Jared Rushton) and
Little Russ (Thomas Brown) Thompson.
   Nick, a young Einstein, and Russ, a rough and tumble ``real''
boy, are the more endearing of the four. Amy has little to do
except provide a love interest for the girlish-looking Ron and play
big sister to her little brother, Nick. The acting is adequate but
not exciting. Only Brown and Oliveri provide a spark.
   As the father, Moranis is his usual nerdy but lovable self, and
his tenacity is rewarded. Marcia Strassman as his wife, Diane, is
an afterthought. The neighbors are Matt Frewer and Kristine
Sutherland.
   Bad neighbors become good friends in the end; bullies learn
humility; loners become team players; and callous children learn
the value of family and friendship.
   The special effects are fun, and the miniatures crew did an
excellent job with models and sets.
   Buy this one, your kids will love it, and so will you.

   ``Field of Dreams'' (MCA Home Video. VHS-Beta. Rated PG. Priced
for rental market only).
   
   One of the strangest nominees this year in the Academy Awards
race for best picture is ``Field of Dreams.'' Strange because
other, finer movies were not nominated, such as ``Glory.''
   A melange of mysticism, nostalgia and the kind of pap, smarmy
philosophy you find on greeting cards, the Phil Alden Robinson
movie seemed to have a strong identity crisis.
   No matter. Its box-office success obviously meant a lot of
people out there loved it.
   ``Field of Dreams'' stars Kevin Costner as an ah-shucks American
type who builds a baseball field after hearing a ``voice.'' He
manages to resurrect the ghosts of Shoeless Joe Jackson (my, how
that guy got around movieland last year) and other dead baseball
types.
   If you're still watching this video at this point, then press on
and good luck.
   As for those of you who like real classy schmaltz, run back to
the video store and rent ``Bambi.''
