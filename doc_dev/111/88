   President Bush, who once captained the Yale
baseball team, pitched his first ball as president Monday at the
season opener between the Baltimore Orioles and the Boston Red Sox.
   As the president of Egypt and a sellout crowd of 54,000 looked
on, southpaw Bush hurled a game-opening pitch that was a little
high and outside. Orioles catcher Mickey Tettleton had no problem
snagging it over his right shoulder.
   ``He caught it before it started breaking,'' Bush insisted
afterwards.
   Bush brought with him Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, who told
reporters this was the first baseball game he had been to although
``I saw it on television several times.''
   Bush defended his pitch later during a picture-taking session in
a glass-enclosed box above third base.
   ``What do you think? You're an objective judge?'' he asked
baseball great Ted Williams, a longtime friend.
   ``A high, hard fastball,'' Williams answered.
   Bush then asked A. Bartlett Giamatti, the commissioner of
baseball, for his opinion. ``Superb. I didn't see it, but I
heard,'' the commissioner said.
   Bush and Mubarak munched on hamburgers and hot dogs and drank
soft drinks in Orioles cups.
   At one point, Mubarak put on an Orioles baseball cap for
photographers. Bush's tie was in the Orioles' team colors _ orange
and black.
   Mubarak said that he was enjoying the game and that Bush was ``a
good teacher, of course. He was the captain of the biggest team in
the United States.''
   ``That's what I told him,'' joked Bush.
   Also in the box were Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
Chief of Staff John Sununu and Budget Director Richard Darman,
wearing a Red Sox cap.
   The sky was overcast when Bush and Mubarak left Washington by
helicopter. By the time the game began shortly after 2 p.m.,
however, the sun had poked through the clouds and was shining
brightly.
   Bush and his party stayed through the fifth inning, missing most
of the game's action. When he left, the score was Orioles 1, Red
Sox 0. The Orioles went on to win, 5-4, in 12 innings.
   Bush was captain of the 1948 Yale baseball team. A first baseman
known for his fielding, Bush's batting average was a modest .167.
   But that didn't stop him of dreaming of ``a fat contract to play
professional baseball,'' as he put it in his 1987 biography
``Looking Forward.''
   Bush, who bats right-handed but throws with his left, has been
an avid baseball fan ever since. He freout first
balls in his eight years as vice president and during the 1988
presidential campaign.
   After ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' by rock singer Joan Jett,
Bush strode jauntily to the mound in his shirt sleeves. Catcher
Tettleton moved forward a teps to catch the president's pitch.
   Of the 26 opening day pitchers in major league baseball, 23 are
paid more than Bush's $200,000 salary as president.
   Of those, Orioles starting pitcher Dave Schmidt will make
$625,000 this season and Red Sox opening pitcher Roger Clemens,
$2.3 million.
   In addition tfelong enthusiasm for the game, Bush has
baseball in his family. His oldest son, George W. Bush, recently
became the leader of a partnership ts Rangers.
