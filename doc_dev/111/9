   If the baseball lockout never ends, what will
the sports media write and talk about this summer?
   Some media companies already are juggling their plans even as
they hope they will never have to answer that question.
   The lockout has blocked the opening of spring training camps for
nearly a month, and it already has cost the ESPN cable network five
of the 10 spring training games it planned to televise this year.
   Potential problems loom for CBS, which is to begin broadcasting
baseball in April; The National, the new daily sports newspaper,
and The Sporting News, the sports weekly.
   ``It hasn't affected us yet, but baseball is the only game in
town in the summertime,'' said Tom Osenton, president and chief
executive of The Sporting News Publishing Co. in St. Louis. ``If
you take the game away, you have nothing to write about.''
   ESPN is in the first season of its $400 million contract to
carry up to 175 games in each of the next four years.
   ``Getting that contract was such an exciting moment for us,''
said Mike Soltys, manager of programming information for ESPN. ``To
start out in this manner is certainly discouraging.''
   The network filled the gaps created by the lost games with live
tennis, auto racing and other programming it had originally planned
to tape for later replay, he said.
   Plans are to substitute a college basketball playoff game, a
college baseball game and college wrestling, among other events if
the remaining spring training games are canceled, Soltys said.
   He said the network is sticking with its plans to run a baseball
show, Baseball Tonight, seven nights a week starting as scheduled
next Monday.
   If the lockout continues, the show will deal with developments
in negotiations between the players and owners and may feature
coverage of minor league baseball, he said.
   But ESPN faces a more serious problem in April, when it planned
to begin carrying six games a week. The network has hired 19
commentators to handle the nightly baseball show and the games,
Soltys said, and has sold more than 60 percent of its season's
advertising inventory in the games.
   Soltys said the advertisers are being given the options of
appearing on the replacement programs, holding off until the games
start or getting refunds.
   But he said the lockout has hurt the climate for selling
advertising. ``There is no way of knowing where we would be without
this,'' he said.
   Soltys said ``there are provisions for lost games'' under the
network contract with baseball, but he refused to describe them. A
source familiar with the contract said ESPN and CBS will be given
additional games in the next three years for games lost this year.
   The lockout has posed a less serious problem so far for CBS,
which agreed to pay $1.06 billion for the right to broadcast 16
regular season games, the All-Star game, the playoffs and World
Series every year for four years.
   CBS' first baseball broadcasts are scheduled for April 14 and
April 21, but its third broadcast is not scheduled until June 16.
   CBS Sports spokesman Tony Fox said the network has not decided
what sports programs will replace the April game broadcasts.
   Fox said more than half of CBS' advertising inventory for
baseball had been sold, but he declined to discuss what plans were
being made for advertisers if games are canceled.
   The network plans to run its baseball season preview show on
March 31 as scheduled no matter what happens with the lockout, Fox
said.
   As at The Sporting News, the lockout has had little impact so
far on The National, according to editor-in-chief Frank Deford. The
newspaper debuted Jan. 31 in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
   Deford said readers of The National usually are interested in
several sports, and there has been plenty of activity recently in
college and professional basketball, boxing and hockey to interest
them.
   But if the baseball lockout continues into mid-summer, ``that
would be a real blow to us, there is no question.''
   At The Sporting News, Osenton said plans are being made to beef
up basketball and hockey coverage over the next few weeks and said
if the lockout persists, the tabloid may increase coverage of minor
league baseball.
   Deford said it was unlikely The National would start covering
minor league or Japanese baseball because he doen't think readers
want it. ``You can't give people something they don't want,'' he
said.
   He said if the lockout continued into June, there probably would
be more coverage of major tennis, soccer, golf and swimming events.
He said the paper also could be trimmed to 32 pages from the 40-48
pages it has been running.
   Deford professes to be unconcerned and has made no contingency
plans. ``My best judgment is I cannot conceive of a situation where
they will not be back by June,'' he said.
