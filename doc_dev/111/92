   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Fifty years ago on June 6, a group of
neighborhood kids played an organized game of baseball on a
scaled-down field in Williamsport, Pa. They called it the Little
League. Today more than 2.5 million young boys and girls play on
140,000 Little League baseball teams in the United States and 33
foreign countries. But despite its immense popularity, the
organizer of that first game is not happy about the way the Little
League turned out.

   When you drive south on Route 15 in
north-central Pennsylvania, just as you top the crest of Bald Eagle
Mountain pull over and cast your gaze on the valley below.
   If there could be an ideal spot for the birthplace of Little
League baseball, you are looking at it.
   The Susquehanna River winds down from the green Allegheny hills
through a town of 40,000 souls who live in clapboard houses with
porch swings and shade trees, a timeless scene off a postcard
labeled ``America.''
   An American flag large enough to cover a small infield draws
your eye to the north bank of the river. It flies proudly in front
of a 45-acre complex of buildings and ball fields, the
international headquarters of Little League, Inc.
   Little League baseball celebrates its 50th anniversary this
year. Boys who played in the first Little League game, on June 6,
1939, have grandchildren playing in the league. A Little League
ballpark has become as common a sight as a church spire in cities,
villages and suburbs across the land.
   A three-team league of 30 Williamsport boys in 1939 was the
seedbed for what Little League, Inc. today calls the largest sports
organization in the world. Today, 2.5 million youths play on
140,000 teams in 6,000 leagues in the United States and 33 foreign
countries.
   ``Of course I had no idea what Little League would become,''
says Carl Stotz, who founded the league while working as a clerk in
a lumber yard. ``All I envisioned at the time was a neighborhood
program. Some of what it has become I am not in favor of.''
   At 79, Stotz still lives in Williamsport. He is a man with an
incredible memory and a compulsion to keep daily logs and save
receipts.
   He can show you, for example, that the total expenses for the
first Little League season came to $174.63, that the collection
taken up at the first game netted $1.42, that the first boy-sized
catcher's mask, ordered from Chicago and which he still has, cost
$1.67, the first dozen balls $2. The first year's deficit was
$36.72, which Stotz made up out of his own pocket as he did every
year until 1943 when the league finally finished in the black.
   Now Little League, Inc. has assets of more than $10 million and
a staff of 70 paid employees at its headquarters. It charges each
of those 140,000 teams a charter fee of $14 each year and earns
millions on endorsements of athletic equipment and royalties on the
Little League name, which is copyrighted, and the logo, which Stotz
designed. The business of Little League is unquestionably big
league.
   Stotz's memory of how it all began is vivid.
   One August day in 1938 he was playing catch with his two
nephews, Jimmy and Harold Gehron, ages 6 and 8, in his back yard at
1108 Isabella St. Running backward, he tripped over the jagged
stumps of a cut-down lilac bush and bruised his ankle. His left
ankle.
   ``I sat on the back steps there,'' he recalls, pointing,
``rubbing my ankle.
   ``I said to the boys, `How would you like to play on a regular
team with uniforms, a new ball for every game and bats you can
really swing?'
   ``One of them said, `Uncle Tuck' _ that's what they called me _
`who would we play?'
   ``I decided on the spot it would have to be a league of teams.''
   Stotz gathered up a group of neighborhood boys each evening and
went to a flat field at Memorial Park where picknickers played
softball.
