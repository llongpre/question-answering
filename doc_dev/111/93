<LEADPARA>  PETER Ueberroth still cares about baseball, especially Bay Area baseball. The
former commissioner (and former San Jose State water polo player) spent
Tuesday morning in Santa Clara, then spoke to the annual Cable Car Classic
luncheon.;   The Cable Car is a basketball tournament, of course, but
Ueberroth's remarks kept steering to baseball. After lunch, Santa Clara Mayor
Eddie Souza presented Ueberroth with a ceremonial flag. Souza explained how
emotional a scene it was in 1984 when the Olympic flame passed through Santa
Clara -- the torch run was Ueberroth's idea when he ran the Los Angeles Games
-- and thanked him profusely.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Ueberroth accepted the thanks graciously, then changed the topic.;   "You
ought to get a baseball team here," Ueberroth told Souza.;   The earnest Souza
explained that, well, Santa Clara was trying hard, attempting to put together
a Giants stadium package, but there was a competing proposal from San Jose and
. . .;   "You should forget the borders," Ueberroth interrupted. "The cities
should work together.";    HE'S CORRECT. They should. But chances are they
won't, given the history and egos of the two cities. Yet as you witnessed the
conversation, the overwhelming feeling was that if Ueberroth were suddenly
appointed czar of Santa Clara County, he'd somehow get it done. That's how he
did it as baseball commissioner, with a no-nonsense style that irked some
people but ultimately succeeded.;   The question put to Ueberroth in a short
interview after his speech was basic: What does he like most and least about
going to baseball games these days?;   "I like the fact that I can enjoy the
games as a fan now," Ueberroth answered, warming to the subject. "You know,
there was misconception when you were a commissioner, you could go and enjoy
the games, but it seemed there was always something happening in the park --
problems that divided my attention -- so that I couldn't really relax and just
watch the games.;   "Now I can," he said. "And I like the atmosphere. I like
hearing the buzz in the crowd when a relief pitcher warms up, as they think
along with the manager. I like it that you don't see 55-ounce beers in
stadiums any more; we were able to work that down to 15 or 12 ounces in most
places.";   And the stuff he likes least?;    "I GUESS what I don't like is .
. . well, the lack of teamwork at the executive/ownership level," Ueberroth
said. "You know, the owners put their egos on the field of play. And if they
don't win it all, people get fired, managers and general managers, including
some very good people who work hard and know what they're doing. That's just
wrong. And it seems to be getting worse than ever.";   Earlier, Ueberroth had
related his idea of The Way Things Should Work by telling the lunch crowd a
story about the 1990 Cincinnati Reds and their World Series victory over the
A's. Ueberroth had been invited to Game 1 as the guest of American League
President Bobby Brown, who naturally was partial to the A's.;   "In the fifth
or sixth inning," Ueberroth said, "Bobby Brown turned to me and he said, 'I
think we're in trouble.' I asked him, 'How can you say that when we're only
halfway through the first game?' He said, 'Look at the Cincinnati uniforms.'
So I did. They were all dirty and a few were torn, from the way they'd been
diving after balls and running the bases. Oakland's uniforms weren't.";   The
Reds, as everyone knows, went on to win in a four-game sweep. Peter Ueberroth
didn't argue with the result.  </TEXT>
