<P>
The Cincinnati Reds' streak of bad luck continued today when transportation 
problems in Montreal kept them from playing the annual Hall of Fame game 
against the Boston Red Sox at Doubleday Field. 
</P>
<P>
The game was scheduled to start at 2 p.m. EDT, but at that time the Reds were 
in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
A Hall of Fame official said the Reds had bus problems and then difficulty 
chartering a plane for the trip to central New York. The bottom line was that 
they didn't make it. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Bart Giamatti made the announcement to a crowd of about 9,100, who 
did not seem overly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
The Red Sox did arrive on time and took batting practice and played an 
intra-squad game, also using players from Elmira of the New York State-Penn 
League. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the Reds had made it, Manager Pete Rose planned to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, facing allegations that he bet on baseball games, said last week that he 
did not want to take any of the spotlight away from former teammate Johnny 
Bench, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame on Sunday along with Carl 
Yastrzemski. 
</P>
<P>
Although neither he nor his team was here, and although the induction of Bench 
and Yastrzemski was the highlight of the Hall of Fame weekend, the undercurrent 
was all Rose. 
</P>
<P>
There were signs criticizing Giamatti's handling of the Rose matter hanging 
from local pubs and a smattering of boos when he was introduced at the 
induction ceremonies Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In the baseball shops that line the narrow streets of Cooperstown, Pete Rose 
memorabilia remained a hot item. 
</P>
<P>
The last thing the Reds needed today was an exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected day off probably will help a team that has been devastated by 
injuries and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The team came off a four-game sweep by Montreal and has lost eight straight to 
fall out of the National League West pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Real Confused Team' 
</P>
<P>
"It can't get much worse than this," reliever John Franco said. "It's been one 
thing after another." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds have been devastated by injuries and are playing without shortstop 
Barry Larkin, outfielder Paul O'Niell and reliever Rob Dibble. Along the way, 
just about every starter has missed some time, and 12 players have been on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a real confused team right now because of all these injuries," Rose 
said Sunday after the Reds lost 12-4 to Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
"What do you do about it? Maybe you guys (reporters) can tell me." 
</P>
<P>
The Reds are to play San Diego at home Tuesday night.
