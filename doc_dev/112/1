   Pictures taken by the Magellan spacecraft
suggest that volcanoes still spew Australia-sized lava floods on
Venus, and the planet didn't abruptly shut down after a
global-sized eruption 400 million years ago.
   ``Venus is not dead,'' Southern Methodist University scientist
Roger Phillips said Monday during the American Geophysical Union's
fall meeting.
   Magellan hasn't yet found direct proof that volcanoes are
erupting today on the planet, but ``it seems likely Venus is still
(volcanically) active today,'' said Steve Saunders, Magellan's
chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   The spacecraft's latest radar pictures of cloud-covered Venus
show there are absolutely no meteorite impact craters in an
Australia-sized portion of the planet's Sappho region, just north
of the Venusian equator, Phillips said.
   That means the huge area is covered by lava that was deposited
in a massive flood-like eruption sometime within the last tens of
millions of years - very young in geological terms, Phillips said.
   ``It raises the likelihood Venus is still active,'' the Dallas
researcher added.
   Venus ``has to be volcanically active, but demonstrating it is
going to be hard,'' said Brown University geologist Jim Head, a
member of the Magellan science team.
   To show conclusively that volcanoes now erupt on Venus, Magellan
must fly over the same parts of the planet twice and look for
differences caused by active lava flows. That won't happen until
next spring.
   Saunders said last month that most of the meteorite impact
craters on Venus appeared relatively young and fresh. He said that
suggested older impact craters were obliterated by gargantuan
floods of lava.
   At the time, Saunders said that either lava gushed from numerous
cracks in the surface to flood 60 percent of Venus during a single
catastrophe about 400 million years ago, or that a series of
somewhat smaller but still giant lava floods inundate various
regions of Venus during different times.
   The evidence Phillips presented Monday supports the second
theory.
   If a single global lava flood created most of Venus' lowland
plains 400 million years ago, meteorite impact craters should
appear across much of the planet's landscape. But the pictures
showing the uncratered region of Sappho suggest that huge, but not
global, lava floods occur on different parts of the planet at
different times, Phillips said.
   That, in turn, indicates massive volcanic flooding is an ongoing
process of Venus, the second planet from the sun.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in May 1989,
went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and formally started making
maps and pictures of the planet on Sept. 15.
   As of Monday, Magellan had orbited Venus 847 times, bouncing
radar off Magellan's surface to make maps and pictures during more
than 450 of the orbits, said Magellan experiment representative
Steve Wall.
   NASA engineers reported Monday that Magellan was unable to map
Venus during 3{ orbits of the planet Saturday and obtained only
poor-quality pictures during two other orbits.
   A device that locates stars to help point Magellan picked the
wrong star because of electronic static. That meant the
spacecraft's main antenna was unable to point properly and collect
radar echoes used to make pictures. Engineers fixed the problem
Saturday night by sending new computer commands to Magellan.
