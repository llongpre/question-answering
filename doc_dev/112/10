   The Magellan spacecraft found that
600-mile-wide circular features on Venus are mile-high volcanic
bulges created as molten rock bubbles up from inside the planet, a
scientist said Wednesday.
   From a bird's-eye-view, the bulges look like nested sets of
concentric rings. Called coronas, the rings are ridges and valleys
that form huge circles. Numerous volcanoes and lava flows dot the
coronas.
   The coronas are formed by the same kind of upwelling of
underground plumes of molten rock that created the Hawaiian
Islands, said Ellen Stofan, a geologist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``They're definitely formed by some sort of thermal pulse from
the interior of the planet'' that lasts hundreds of millions of
years, she said.
   In 1983 and 1984, the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft
identified about 30 coronas that measure from 75 miles to more than
600 miles across. But the Venera orbiters couldn't determine if
they were upward bulges or depressions in the ground caused by the
impacts of gargantuan meteorites.
   Magellan is examining the planet with a more sophisticated
radar, which makes much more detailed pictures and also is able to
calculate surface topography. It found five more coronas and
determined they rise as much as one mile above the surrounding
terrain. Stofan said that shows they are hot spots rather than
impact craters.
   One corona that's 150 miles wide seems to be in the early stages
of bulging upward, suggesting that some of its small volcanic domes
and lava flows may be actively erupting, she said.
   Magellan won't be able to confirm the presence of active
volcanoes until the middle of next year, when it passes over the
same part of Venus a second time and can look for landscape changes
resulting from any ongoing eruptions.
   NASA engineers, meanwhile, said the sun will almost block
Earth's view of Magellan and Venus on Nov. 1 when Venus, the sun
and Earth will be oriented in almost a straight line.
   That will cause a nine-day halt - starting sometime between
Saturday and Monday - in Magellan's use of radar to peer through
Venus' clouds and map the planet, said Phil Allin, administrative
assistant to Magellan's project manager.
   The astronomical lineup, called ``superior conjunction,'' also
may make NASA completely lose contact with Magellan for up to three
days, although engineers disagree on whether that will happen,
Allin said.
   The sun won't completely block Earth's view of Venus and
Magellan during the planetary lineup, but activity from the sun
already has impaired some communications, he said.
   Engineers twice lost touch with Magellan in August due to a
yet-unidentified problem. If that happens again when the
Venus-sun-Earth alignment also makes communication difficult or
impossible, ``we worry about how quickly we would get things back
to normal,'' Allin said.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, and arrived at the second planet from the sun on Aug. 10.
