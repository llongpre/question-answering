<LEADPARA>  Engineers tried to cool the excessively warm Magellan spacecraft Wednesday by
turning its solar power panels so they reflect less sunlight onto the Venus
orbiter, NASA said.;    "The spacecraft is continuing to successfully endure a
rather hot environment," said Steve Wall, Magellan experiment representative
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Sunshine bouncing off the panels contributed to unacceptably high
temperatures on some of Magellan's equipment, he said.;    Meanwhile,
scientists proposed naming meteorite impact craters on Venus for women of
accomplishment, including the late authors Gertrude Stein, Pearl Buck and
Rachel Carson, said Gerald Schaber, a U.S. Geological Survey geologist working
on the Magellan project.;    Names for about 100 craters have been proposed to
the International Astronomical Union, which has sole authority to approve
them, he said.;    Schaber said proposed names for other craters include the
surnames of playwright Lillian Hellman, anthropologist Margaret Mead,
playwright-ambassador Clare Booth Luce and Mary Stuart, queen of Scots.;    A
crater field, or set of three craters, tentatively named after Stein was shown
in one of three new pictures of Venusian meteorite impact craters released by
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  </TEXT>
