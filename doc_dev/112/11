   NASA restored high-speed communications
with Magellan for the first time in four weeks Wednesday, then
released more of the spacecraft's pictures of jagged lava flows and
giant craters on Venus.
   The irregularly shaped craters _ one measuring 5 miles wide _
are called calderas. Each one probably formed when lava flowed out
from underneath the planet's volcanoes, causing the entire top of a
volcano to collapse, said Steve Saunders, Magellan project
scientist.
   A lava flow shown in another picture is ``much like flows on
Earth that are called by geologists `aa' (ah-ah), a Hawaiian word
that probably mimics the sound the ancients uttered while running
barefoot over the rough, jagged surface,'' Saunders said in a news
release.
   The images were made during an Aug. 16 test of Magellan's
picture-making radar, just before the spaceship temporarily lost
contact with Earth for the first time. Engineers at the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
spent Wednesday preparing Magellan so that it can attempt to make
more pictures during a crucial test on Saturday.
   They turned the spacecraft so its main antenna pointed toward
Earth, experiment representative Steve Wall said. That allowed
Magellan to send back information at up to 268,800 ``bits'' per
second, 6,720 times faster than was possible through its secondary
antenna, which has been used since the communications problems
developed.
   The secondary antenna has a broader radio beam, allowing it to
maintain contact with Earth more easily than the main antenna.
   Restoring the high-speed link was necessary so engineers could
play back the contents of an onboard tape recorder. The recorder
contains more of the radar picture data collected Aug. 16 and
engineering information that may provide clues about Magellan's
troubles.
   The engineers still haven't identified the problem that made
Magellan lose radio contact with Earth for 14 hours starting Aug.
16 and for 17{ hours beginning Aug. 21, Wall said.
   Magellan's computers rejected a command Wednesday to turn off a
faulty gyroscope that developed problems when the spacecraft
started orbiting Venus Aug. 10. The device is no longer needed to
help point Magellan, and engineers said it won't harm the mission.
   Plans call for Magellan to formally start its $744 million
mission to use radar to makes maps and pictures of Venus'
cloud-covered surface late this month, Wall said.
   But unless the tape playback reveals an unforeseen problem,
Magellan's radar will be turned on Friday and tested Saturday. If
all goes well and Magellan produces more highly detailed pictures,
officials might simply declare afterward that the formal mapping
mission started Saturday.
   One of the pictures released Wednesday shows a basalt lava flow
11 miles wide and at least 15} miles long. It has lobed edges, is
extremely rough, and probably flowed in a ``thick, pasty'' manner
before it solidified, Saunders said.
   Another picture shows at least two volcanic calderas, similar to
those in the summit area of broad shield volcanoes such as Mauna
Loa and Kilauea on Hawaii. The largest measures 5 miles long by 2.2
miles wide.
   Calderas on Earth usually are much larger than typical volcanic
craters. Hawaiian, Icelandic and apparently the Venusian calderas
were created when lava flowed from vents on the flanks of
volcanoes, causing their summits to collapse.
   Earth's biggest calderas were formed by extraordinarily
explosive eruptions. Examples include calderas at Yellowstone
National Park in Wyoming and at California's Long Valley-Mammoth
Lakes resort area.
   A third new Venus picture shows a valley, about six-tenths of a
mile wide, that formed when a block of land dropped down between
two faults as the area was being stretched apart, Saunders said.
The valley cuts through a series of older ridges and valleys, but
was partially flooded by later lava flows.
   Similar fault-bounded valleys are found in California, East
Africa and Germany.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus after traveling a looping
948-million-mile path since its from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.
