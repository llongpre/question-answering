Venus, a planet that started out like the Earth but took a dramatic turn 
somewhere along the way, is turning out to be a geological candy store as it 
lays bare its soul for the Magellan spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
Photographs released Tuesday by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory show a planet 
that is pockmarked with giant impact craters large enough to swallow Los 
Angeles and a twisted, tormented landscape that has been molded by forces that 
are still not understood. 
</P>
<P>
"These are extremely jazzy images," said Gordon H. Pettengill of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, principal investigator for Magellan's 
radar science team. The images were captured by an electronic "camera" that 
uses radar beams to pierce through the dense atmosphere that normally hides the 
surface of the hot, barren planet. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists hope that Magellan will help them understand why Venus -- the planet 
that is most like the Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun -- turned 
out to be so different: devoid of life, with surface temperatures hot enough to 
melt lead and a heavy atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
After a troubled beginning, Magellan seems to be doing its best to help unravel 
the mysteries, but some of the images produce more questions than answers. 
</P>
<P>
The spacecraft has mapped the surface for more than 80 orbits as it flies in a 
polar trajectory around Venus. The problems that caused the craft to sever its 
communications with Earth twice are not fully understood, said chief engineer 
John P. Slonski Jr., so Magellan is not completely safe yet. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems may happen again," Slonski told a press conference at the 
Pasadena lab. He said that even if the "root cause" of the blackouts has not 
been determined, engineers have at least narrowed the range of probabilities 
and taken steps to protect Magellan as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists said Tuesday that the images captured by Magellan have demonstrated 
that Venus is an extraordinary laboratory in which to test geological theories 
because the photographs are clear and reveal a geological record spanning 
hundreds of millions of years. 
</P>
<P>
On Earth, the evidence of earthquakes and volcanoes disappears over time 
because of vegetation and erosion. On Venus, where there is no vegetation and 
very little erosion, the geological record stands out in brilliant clarity. 
</P>
<P>
One of the new images shows an extraordinary pattern of what appears to be a 
crosshatching of faults. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an extremely regular pattern," said James W. Head II of Brown University, 
co-investigator on the radar science team. "The regularity is so remarkable," 
he said, that "we have no idea how these (patterns) would form." 
</P>
<P>
It is possible that there are similar areas on Earth, he said, but they must be 
hidden by vegetation or erosion. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, "erosion does not appear to be a fundamental process" on the 
surface of Venus, Head said. That is because there is no water to wash away the 
soil and produce sediments that could be transported by the wind, and the wind 
amounts to little more than a slight breeze. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so used to water eroding the surface of Earth," Head said. "It's 
astonishing to see all this detail. When you create (a geological feature on 
Venus) it stays there a long time." 
</P>
<P>
If Magellan can capture a photo of an active volcano on Venus, it would answer 
whether the planet is alive in a volcanic sense, but nothing in the images 
transmitted to Earth shows that. 
</P>
<P>
Head pointed out that Magellan has covered only 1 1/2% of the surface of Venus 
so far. If you looked at that much of the Earth's surface, you probably would 
not see any active volcanoes either, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Head indicated that he believes he already knows the answer. "It's very much 
alive," he said of Venus. 
</P>
<P>
The images from Magellan reveal a surface that could be changing even as the 
spacecraft zips overhead. In addition to faulting and cratering, the newly 
released images show a "river" of lava hundreds of miles long. The images also 
show giant volcanoes similar to those in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
The most spectacular image is a mosaic covering an area about half the size of 
California. It was displayed at JPL as a 10-foot-by-12-foot mural, and it shows 
giant craters up to 30 miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
One image shows an impact crater that is nearly two miles deep. All of the 
impact craters are at least five miles in diameter. Scientists said that is 
because only the largest objects survive the long journey through space to 
Venus' surface. Smaller meteoroids apparently break up as they crash through 
the dense atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan is expected to spend nearly a year mapping Venus, and scientists said 
Tuesday that they expect far more images and a lot of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't touch that dial," Head said. "We think we've got a blockbuster fall 
season coming up."
