   The spacecraft Magellan bombarded Venus
with radar Saturday in the first attempt to make pictures of the
planet's cloud-shrouded surface since engineers temporarily lost
touch with it last month.
   ``Most people are sighing with relief,'' said Jim Scott,
Magellan mission director at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``We're just happy to
get into the position where we wanted to be.''
   Acting on computerized commands radioed 154.9 million miles from
Earth, Magellan started bouncing radar off the planet during the
morning and engineers received confirmation 13 minutes later, Scott
said.
   NASA's Deep Space Network tracking station at Goldstone, Calif.,
started receiving data on the radar images, and computers will
assemble it into pictures that will be released to the public early
this week, said Ed Sherry, technical assistant to Magellan's
project manager.
   ``I'm just delighted. I'm happy as a clam,'' he said.
   Magellan's $744 million mission is designed to produce the most
detailed pictures yet of Venus' surface, totally concealed by
clouds, as well as a global map of the planet. It was launched from
the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, and started orbiting
Venus on Aug. 10, after a looping 948 million-mile voyage from
Earth.
   The spacecraft's radar makes pictures 10 times more detailed
than those produced by Earth-based radar or radar on the Soviet
Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which reached Venus in the mid-1980s.
   Engineers lost radio contact with Magellan for 14 hours starting
Aug. 16, then for 17{ hours beginning Aug. 21. They still haven't
learned the cause of the temporary blackouts, which they believe
could happen again.
   But they gave Magellan new computer instructions so it can
recover quickly from future communications breakdowns.
   The Aug. 16 blackout happened only hours after Magellan used its
radar for its first pictures of Venus during two orbits around the
planet. Only 1{ orbits worth of picture information was sent to
Earth before contact was lost.
   Half the remaining picture information was radioed to Earth on
Wednesday and the rest was sent back Saturday before mapping
resumed, Scott said.
   The first pictures showed Venus has large flows of solidified
lava; pervasive ``Venusquake'' faults; big meteorite impact
craters; volcanic cinder cones; large collapsed volcanic craters,
called calderas; and parallel mountain ridges and valleys like
those in the Great Basin that covers most of Nevada and western
Utah.
   NASA's official position is that Magellan's formal mapping
mission won't begin until late this month. But if all goes well
through the weekend, officials may decide afterward that the
243-day mapping effort began Saturday, Scott and Sherry said.
   Venus, the second planet from the sun, rotates once on its axis
every 243 Earth days. Magellan circles Venus in a nearly polar
orbit, so as Venus revolves beneath it the craft should be able to
map 70 percent to 90 percent of the planet during its 243-day
mission. NASA, however, has said it expects to use Magellan for
additional 243-day cycles so the entire planet can be mapped.
   Venus is considered Earth's virtual twin in terms of size, mass,
density and distance from the sun, although the planet's surface
has been heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a runaway ``greenhouse
effect.''
   Magellan's goal to learn exactly what forces shape Venus, and
whether its crust is broken into giant drifting plates like those
that carry continents across the face of the Earth.
   Many scientists believe Venusian crustal movements are
predominated by ``hot spots'' - rising subterranean plumes of
molten rock like those that created the Hawaiian Islands.
