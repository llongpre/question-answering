   Magellan ended a two-week hiatus
Saturday and resumed its radar mapping of the surface of Venus.
   The lull in the spacecraft's $744 million mission was necessary
because Earth, the sun and Venus were lined up in a way that
hindered communication between Magellan and controllers at National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Magellan engineer Cynthia Haynie said the orbiter began bouncing
radar waves off the cloudy planet at 4:11 a.m. PST.
   The radar echoes are collected by Magellan for transmission to
Earth, where they are assembled into maps and pictures.
   ``Everything went great,'' Haynie said.
   The mapping had been suspended since Oct. 26.
   Engineers used the time to work on figuring out how to fix a
computer programming glitch that caused Magellan's twin solar
panels to wobble.
   A new program to stop the wobbling will be radioed to Magellan
and activated next week, said Ed Sherry, technical assistant to
Magellan's project manager.
   The panels are essential for charging Magellan's batteries, but
the vibration hasn't prevented them from gathering solar energy.
   Magellan uses radar because the thick Venusian clouds prevent
optical cameras from photographing the planet's surface.
   The spacecraft was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in May
1989 and went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. Mapping began in
September.
   Magellan has made pictures of volcanoes, huge solidified lava
flows, extensive quake faults, city-sized meteorite craters and
600-mile-wide, mile-high bulges created as molten rock pushes
upward from inside the planet.
   It also found evidence that ocean-sized floods of molten rock
once inundated more than half the surface.
