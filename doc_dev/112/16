   Thick, pasty lava once oozed onto the
surface of Venus to form 15-mile-wide domes that look like giant
pancakes or coconut macaroons in the Magellan spacecraft's newest
pictures.
   Heat measurements made by the spacecraft show fool's gold or
other iron-rich metallic minerals coat the slopes of the planet's
tallest peak, 7-mile-high Mount Maxwell.
   Scientists released new radar pictures Friday during a news
conference at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Engineers were relieved they were able to regain contact with
the spacecraft after a 40-minute blackout Thursday. It was the
third such communications failure in three months. Project manager
Tony Spear said it could happen again, but called Magellan's health
``very good.''
   Some pictures show 600-mile-long, 300-mile-wide horseshoe-shaped
features, each surrounding a meteorite impact crater 10 miles to 15
miles wide.
   The horseshoes may have been formed by shock waves triggered by
incoming meteorites or by windblown debris that settled to the
ground after being kicked up by the impacts, said geologist Ray
Arvidson of Washington University in St. Louis.
   They are ``unique in the solar system,'' he said.
   The space agency also displayed a computer-processed videotape
that shows Venus' surface from the perspective of someone swooping
over 130-mile-wide, half-mile-deep volcanic collapse craters and
38,000-foot-tall Mount Maxwell, the planet's tallest mountain.
   One of the new pictures shows seven lava domes, similar but much
larger than the lava dome inside the crater of Mount St. Helens in
Washington state, said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist.
   ``They look like coconut macaroons. They look like pancakes,''
he said. ``They're about 2,500 feet high and 15 miles across.''
   Magellan's heat measurements show some of the middle slopes of
Mount Maxwell contain ``mystery material'' that emits little heat,
said Gordon Pettengill of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
   That means the slopes are coated with soil containing metallic
material, either iron pyrite - called fool's gold because it looks
like gold - or iron minerals called hematite and magnetite,
Pettengill said.
   Radar pictures show numerous mountain ridges and valleys created
by squeezing of Venus' hot, thin crust, said Sean Solomon of MIT.
In places, the mountains are no longer being squeezed upward, and
are collapsing down onto lowland plains, he added.
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, arrived at Venus on Aug. 10 and formally started mapping the
planet Sept. 15.
   Magellan has used radar to peer through clouds and map 18
percent of Venus' landscape, comparable to an area on Earth
stretching from Los Angeles to Reykjavik, Iceland, and covering
most of North and South America.
   Thursday's loss of contact with Magellan halted mapping for most
of the day. Engineers still don't know the exact cause but suspect
excess static sometimes disrupts one of Magellan's computers, Spear
said.
   Those malfunctions and other problems will add about $3 million
to $5 million to the $744 million cost of Magellan's mission, Spear
said.
