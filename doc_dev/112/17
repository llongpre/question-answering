   Engineers performed a partial memory
transplant on one of Magellan's computers as they tried to make
sure they don't lose touch with the unruly space probe for a third
time as it orbits Venus.
   Engineers haven't pinpointed the problem that made them
temporarily lose contact with Magellan twice during the past week.
They replaced the faulty computer memory because ``we're fixing the
symptoms,'' Ed Sherry, technical assistant to Magellan's project
manager, said Thursday.
   Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory today planned to
release more of Magellan's early pictures of Venus, made during a
test just before the first communications breakdown Aug. 16.
   The National Aeronautic and Space Administration released
Magellan's first Venus images Tuesday, only hours before losing
radio contact with the wayward spacecraft the second time.
   The first batch of test pictures showed numerous ``Venusquake''
faults, old lava flows, craters, cinder cones, valleys and ridges
on Venus. That means at least part of Venus is shaped by some of
the same violent forces that sculpted Earth.
   A laboratory official said Thursday that one of the pictures
being released today showed an interesting crater on the planet's
surface.
   Earlier this week, Magellan's chief scientist Steve Saunders
said that unreleased Magellan pictures showed a 20-mile-wide crater
that also had been seen by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft
in the mid-1980s.
   The Soviet pictures were about 10 times less detailed than
Magellan's radar images, so it wasn't clear if the crater was
volcanic or caused by a meteorite impact.
   Magellan's pictures clearly show it is an impact crater, but the
floor of the crater is extremely smooth, indicating it was flooded
by lava that later solidified, Saunders said.
   He said the crater may have filled with lava from an eruption
triggered when a meteorite punched completely through Venus' crust.
Or the lava simply may have filled the crater much later in an
eruption unrelated to the impact.
   Magellan is on a $744 million mission to use its radar to peer
through the clouds of Venus and make the most detailed pictures and
maps yet of the second planet from the sun. It went into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10, about 15 months after it was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis. It now is nearly 150 million miles from Earth.
   Sherry said engineers don't yet know how long Magellan's
troubles will delay the official start of its mapping effort, which
was to begin the first week of September.
   The ultimate problem that caused the malfunction remains
unknown. But flight data show that Tuesday night the spacecraft's
automatic safety systems were unable to maintain radio contact as
expected because part of the memory was ``corrupted'' in a backup
computer that helps point Magellan, Sherry said. He said engineers
replaced the faulty contents of that computer's memory with a
rewritten version that was radioed to the spacecraft Thursday.
   Magellan's main computer found ``something was not kosher'' in
the backup computer's memory and, as a result, assumed Magellan was
pointing in the wrong direction _ which it wasn't, Sherry said.
That made Magellan try to turn to what it thought was the correct
position, but it actually turned its antenna away from Earth,
losing contact.
   The series of malfunctions ``have shaken the spacecraft, but the
overall spacecraft remains very healthy, and we're very optimistic
we'll be back to a fruitful mission soon,'' Sherry said.
