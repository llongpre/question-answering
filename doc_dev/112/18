   Magellan will resume making pictures of
Venus on Nov. 7 or 8 after engineers fix a computer programming
flaw that is causing a wobble in the spacecraft's twin solar power
panels, NASA said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, a Soviet scientist working on the Magellan project
praised the American mission, but said more spacecraft should be
sent to Venus to better learn how the planet works geologically.
   ``Magellan is a beautiful mission. But this is not the end,''
geologist Alexander Basilevsky said during a weekly briefing on
NASA's closed-circuit television system.
   Basilevsky works for the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences' Vernadsky
Institute of Geochemistry and Analytical Chemistry in Moscow. He is
one of three Soviet guest investigators on the Magellan project.
   Magellan temporarily suspended its $744 million mapmaking
mission Friday because of the solar panel problem and because its
communications with Earth were being impaired by a lineup of Venus,
the sun and Earth.
   Engineers determined that a flaw in the spacecraft's computer
software was causing the wobble, said Steve Wall, Magellan
experiment representative at the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   They problem should be fixed in time to resume mapping Nov. 7 or
8, when the planetary alignment will no longer hinder
communications, Wall said.
   The solar panels are essential for recharging Magellan's
batteries to keep the spacecraft running. But the wobbling hasn't
hurt their ability to gather solar energy.
   The orbiter was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.
   At 9 p.m. EST Thursday, the sun will be almost directly between
Earth and Venus. That lineup started hindering Magellan's
communications with Earth more than a week ago.
   Magellan uses radar to penetrate Venus' thick clouds to make
pictures and maps. It will map at least 70 percent to 90 percent of
the planet's surface.
   Since mapping formally started Sept. 15, the orbiter has made
pictures of numerous volcanoes, huge solidified lava flows,
extensive quake faults, Los Angeles-sized meteorite impact craters
and 600-mile-wide, mile-high bulges created as molten rock pushes
upward from inside the planet.
