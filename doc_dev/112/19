   NASA engineers today struggled to
restore radio contact with Magellan after losing touch with the
Venus-orbiting spacecraft for the second time in five days.
   Space agency engineers' failure this morning to hear from
Magellan after the link broke indicated the craft's computerized
emergency systems didn't immediately activate to help re-establish
communication with Earth, NASA said.
   So the engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory repeatedly
sent new computer commands toward Magellan's presumed position
around Venus in an attempt to tell it to radio Earth, said NASA
spokesman Bob MacMillin.
   Nothing was heard hours after the commands should have elicited
a response from Magellan. Engineers met to plan their next step.
   ``Bad news. Nothing. Not a peep out of it,'' MacMillin said.
``It's kind of a mystery.''
   Contact was lost at 7:03 p.m. Tuesday while NASA was tracking
Magellan with an antenna dish near Canberra, Australia, said
laboratory spokesman Jim Doyle.
   The latest blow to Magellan's $744 million mission to map Venus
came Tuesday night, less than eight hours after the space agency
released the craft's first snapshots of Venus.
   The pictures revealed a remarkably violent landscape shaped by
impact craters, quake faults, vast lava flows, and ridges and
valleys like those in the western United States.
   The loss of Magellan would be another major blow to NASA, which
grounded the space shuttle fleet temporarily because of fuel leaks
and found the Hubble Space Telescope was impaired by a flawed
mirror.
   The spacecraft's emergency systems allowed engineers to locate
the spacecraft on Friday, more than 14 hours after they lost
contact with it the first time. Eight hours later, they restored
steady contact by sending Magellan a command to stop spinning and
keep one of its antennas pointed at Earth.
   Magellan's mission is to map up to 90 percent of Venus' surface
using radar to peer through the planet's thick clouds, which
prevent the use of optical cameras. The spacecraft went into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10 after a roundabout, 948-million-mile trip.
It was launched from the shuttle Atlantis 15 months ago.
   When Magellan's first Venus pictures were released Tuesday,
Magellan project manager Tony Spear said that as far as engineers
could tell, ``the spacecraft is healthy,'' despite last week's
malfunction.
   He and other engineers said they still hadn't figured out the
cause of the problem. But Spear had been optimistic enough to say
he still planned to have Magellan start its Venus mapping mission
the first week of September.
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory is known for its ability to overcome
problems with wayward spacecraft. After the twin Voyager probes
were launched in 1977, one lost contact with Earth for eight days.
The radio link was restored and the probes went on to explore the
outer planets.
   Spacecraft system engineer John Slonski said one leading theory
to explain last week's loss of contact with Magellan was that a
cosmic ray or a high-energy particle from the sun caused a blip in
its computer memory.
   ``We're not ruling out a software flaw or some hardware
problem'' or perhaps some unknown electrical fields surrounding
Venus, Spear said.
   He also said cosmic ray ``hits'' on spacecraft electronics can
be expected to interfere with Magellan about once each year.
   Magellan made its first pictures of Venus during a test
conducted just before last week's malfunction.
   As promised by NASA, Magellan's first pictures are 10 times more
detailed than the best radar images of Venus made by two Soviet
probes and a giant radio telescope in Puerto Rico. They show
details as small as 400 feet across.
   The pictures show ``Venus is intensely fractured and faulted,''
with at least part of its terrain shaped by geological forces
``even more violent than I imagined before,'' Magellan project
scientist Steve Saunders said Tuesday.
   The pictures cover a small portion of the planet near
Hawaii-like volcanic highlands.
   The pictures show plains covered by six- to 10-mile-wide lava
flows that solidified and then were cracked by faults. Saunders
said the flows resemble those in Hawaii or along the Columbia and
Snake rivers in the Pacific Northwest.
   Also visible are a couple of volcanic cinder cones, a
20-mile-wide meteorite crater and long, parallel sets of two- to
three-mile-wide valleys and ridges that look like the basins and
ranges of Utah and Nevada, Saunders said.
