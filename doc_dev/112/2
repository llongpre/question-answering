   The Magellan spacecraft found evidence that
volcanoes may be erupting to this day on Venus and that they gushed
an Australia-sized flood of lava in recent geological times.
   The spacecraft's new radar pictures of the cloud-covered planet
suggest that ``at any given time, Venus is active in several
regions,'' said Roger Phillips, a scientist at Southern Methodist
University in Dallas. ``Venus is not dead.''
   Magellan's pictures show there are no meteorite impact craters
in an Australia-sized portion of the planet, Phillips said Monday
during a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.
   That means the huge area is covered by lava that was deposited
sometime within the last tens of millions of years - relatively
recent in geological terms, Phillips said.
   ``It raises the likelihood Venus is still active,'' he added.
   Magellan hasn't yet found direct proof that volcanoes are
erupting today on the planet. To accomplish that, Magellan must fly
over the same parts of Venus twice and look for differences caused
by any active lava flows.
   And that won't happen until next spring.
   Magellan was launched from a shuttle in May 1989, went into
orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and started maing maps and pictures
in September.
   As of Monday, Magellan had orbited Venus 847 times. It bounces
radar off the planet's surface to make images.
