   Geologists may get a glimpse of what
Earth's surface was like a few billion years ago when the Magellan
spacecraft's radar pierces the clouds of Venus to reveal secrets of
an alien terrain.
   ``Venus is the last of the inner planets we are exploring in
detail, and probably is the most important from the point of view
of understanding the Earth,'' said Jim Head, a member of NASA's
Magellan science team and a geology professor at Brown University
in Providence, R.I.
   Magellan fired its braking rocket and slipped into orbit around
Venus on Friday after a 15-month, 948-million-mile voyage from
Earth.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory monitored the
spacecraft's health Saturday so it will be ready by Sept. 1 to use
its radar to peer through thick Venusian clouds and make the most
detailed pictures and maps yet of the planet's landscape.
   Magellan entered orbit so smoothly that it used very little
thruster fuel to point it properly while the rocket fired. So
Magellan weighs more and moves faster than expected, making the low
point in its orbit 183 miles above Venus instead of 171 miles as
planned, said navigation chief John McNamee.
   The orbit is so good that an adjustment maneuver planned for
Aug. 28 will not be needed, Magellan project manager Tony Spear
said Saturday.
   Magellan is designed to study the geology and geography of
Venus, heated to 900 degrees Fahrenheit by a ``greenhouse effect''
gone berserk.
   Venus' high temperature and crushing atmospheric pressure might
make rock in the planet's crust much thinner and more flexible than
Earth's, Head said.
   So Venus may resemble Earth before our home planet's crust
cooled off and broke into colossal plates. Those plates now drift
across the face of the Earth, moving whole continents and colliding
to uplift mountain ranges and trigger volcanic eruptions and
earthquakes.
   Most of Earth's original surface was destroyed long ago by
erosion and plate movements, so ``we have grave difficulty
answering fundamental questions about the early history of the
Earth,'' Head said.
   While Venus is hot, dry and lifeless, ``it is very similar in
size and density and also is the closest planet to the Earth,'' he
said. ``That means it probably had the most similar conditions when
the planets formed (4.6 billion years ago). So if we want to study
another planet to learn something about the early Earth, Venus is a
good candidate.''
   Learning how Venus' crust moves and is deformed ``will tell us a
lot more about the Earth,'' said Steve Saunders, NASA's chief
scientist for Magellan.
   Magellan may settle debate over competing theories that seek to
explain the creation of Venus' continent-like highlands, which
include Africa-sized Aphrodite Terra, Australia-sized Ishtar Terra
and Hawaii-like Beta Regio.
   Saunders believes ``hot spots'' of rising molten rock created
the highlands, just as hot spots created Hawaii on Earth.
   ``If you could look at a time-lapse movie over billions of
years, it might look like a big pot of thick porridge simmering,'
Saunders said, adding Venus' crust may feature ``a bunch of big
Hawaiis all over the place.''
   Some other scientists think Venus' highlands are big pieces of
crust that solidified first as the planet's initial molten surface
cooled off.
   But Head believes plate movements formed the highlands.
Aphrodite Terra resembles Earth's midocean ridges, the undersea
mountain ranges where molten rock emerges to add new material to
the drifting plates of crust.
   Ishtar Terra ``has many of the features that you would expect
where blocks of crust are colliding,'' including volcanoes such as
those along the Pacific coasts of Alaska and South America and
folded mountain belts such as Earth's Himalayas, which were created
because India is smashing into Asia.
   Even if the Venusian crust hasn't yet broken into plates, ``we
probably will find faults like the San Andreas in California,'' a
pretty sure sign that ``Venusquakes'' shake the second planet from
the sun, Saunders said.
