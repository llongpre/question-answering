   After the Magellan spacecraft goes into
orbit around Venus on Aug. 10, it will use radar to map the surface
of the cloud-covered planet. Here is some of what scientists
already know about the second planet from the sun:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or 95 percent as wide as Earth;
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about 82 percent as much as Earth.
   ATMOSPHERE: About 97 percent carbon dioxide, with trace amounts
of nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, water vapor, argon, oxygen, carbon
monoxide, neon, and hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids. The
planet's clouds contain sulfuric acid droplets. The atmosphere
traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that scientists
believe evaporated liquid water long ago, if there ever was any on
the planet. Large fluctuations in sulfur dioxide levels may
indicate that active volcanoes pump the gas into Venus' atmosphere.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit,
hot enough to melt lead, zinc or tin. Crushing atmospheric pressure
90 times that on Earth's surface, or equivalent to the pressure
2,700 feet beneath the surface of an ocean on Earth.
   THE CALENDAR: A day on Venus lasts longer than a year. A
Venusian year _ the time it takes for the planet to orbit the sun _
lasts 225 Earth days. A Venusian day _ the time the planet takes to
spin once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days. Venus also has
retrograde rotation, so the sun rises in the west and sets in the
east.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to Earth
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, Venus is the
brightest object in Earth's skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in Venus' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on Earth. Venus' surface is about 65 percent
rolling plains, 27 percent flat lowlands and 8 percent highlands
that may be similar to Earth's continents.
   GRAVITY: About 89 percent as strong as on Earth.
   MAGNETIC FIELD: None detected so far, suggesting Venus now lacks
a liquid core, which is needed to generate a magnetic field.
