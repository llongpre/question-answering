   NASA is investigating the possibility
that Magellan keeps losing touch with Earth because its braking
rocket might not have fully separated after the spacecraft reached
Venus, engineers said Friday.
   Meanwhile, NASA released new photographs from Magellan that
showed a lava-filled, 20-mile-wide meteorite crater on the planet.
   Magellan project manager Tony Spear said another theory for the
lapses in radio contact is that the braking rocket pulled some
cables off or burned some cables as it was jettisoned when the
spacecraft went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10.
   The braking rocket, which slowed Magellan so it could enter
orbit, was supposed to separate nine hours later, and most signs
are that it did so or at least started to do so, Spear said during
a news conference at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I believe personally the solid rocket motor is far away and
not bumping'' the craft, he said.
   But the possibility it didn't must be considered, said Frank
McKinney, program manager for Martin Marietta Corp., which built
Magellan.
   ``It's a possibility we're investigating,'' said spacecraft
system engineer John Slonski.
   Two hours after the news conference ended, the laboratory's
public relations office issued a statement saying there was
``currently no doubt the separation was complete.'' Spokesmen
refused to elaborate when asked to explain the contradiction
between that statement and those made by Slonski during the news
conference.
   Even if the rocket had not completely separated, it wouldn't
prevent Magellan from conducting its $744 million mission to use
radar to make maps and pictures, Spear said. Mapping is likely to
start no earlier than mid-September, two weeks later than planned,
he said.
   Magellan first lost radio contact with controllers on Aug. 16.
Until engineers identify and fix the problem that cut the radio
link, Spear said, ``I think it's likely to happen again.''
   If so, engineers are ready with new computer commands to ``kick
start'' Magellan's automatic safety systems and make the spacecraft
re-establish contact with Earth immediately, Spear said.
   Pictures released Friday, including a computer-processed
three-dimensional view, showed a meteorite impact crater that has a
very smooth floor and a central peak.
   The smooth floor indicates the crater was flooded by volcanic
lava, either because the meteorite punched through Venus' hot, thin
crust, or because the impact created cracks that let lava ooze into
the crater at some later time, said Magellan chief scientist Steve
Saunders. He said he favors the second theory.
   The crater first was observed by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16
spacecraft in the mid-1980s. Their pictures were 10 times less
detailed and couldn't determine if it was an impact crater or
created purely by volcanic eruption, Saunders said.
   He said the crater is relatively young geologically: 100 million
to 150 million years old. It is named after Soviet sculptor Anna
Golubkina, who lived from 1864 to 1927.
   Other pictures from Magellan showed intense ``Venusquake''
faulting, lava flows and a network of intersecting ridges and
valleys.
   Scientists also displayed a three-minute videotape assembled
from still pictures. It provides a Magellan-eye view of Venus as
the spacecraft swept over the planet.
   Contact with Magellan was lost for more than 14 hours starting
Aug. 16 and for 17{ hours starting Tuesday night.
   ``My heart can't stand this 17-hour loss of signal'' again,
Spear said. ``There are moments of terror and of great happiness
after we recovered the signal.''
   Engineers also are considering the possibility the
communications failures were caused by problems with Magellan's
computer hardware or programs, or the unlikely chance Magellan is
being affected by previously unknown electrical fields around Venus.
   ``Possibly we're making a scientific discovery, but this is a
hard way of doing it,'' Spear said.
   Evidence suggests that during its second radio outage, Magellan
wobbled back and forth ``at a high rate,'' using 5.7 pounds of fuel
as its thrusters kept firing, Slonski said. That still leaves 251
pounds of fuel, far more than needed to keep Magellan in orbit for
years longer than originally planned. The spacecraft used much less
thruster fuel than expected when it slipped into orbit.
   Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989,
and traveled a looping 948 million-mile route to Venus.
