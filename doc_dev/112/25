   Venus has 600-mile-wide circular bulges
on its surface caused by molten rock pressing up from inside the
planet, the same kind of forces that created Hawaii, a Magellan
scientist says.
   The bulges are as much as a mile high, said Ellen Stofan, a
geologist who analyzes the spacecraft's pictures of Venus at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``You have hot material that rises from deep within the interior
of the planet,'' pushing up overlying rock, she said. The process
``happens over scales of hundreds of millions of years,'' she said
Wednesday.
   From a bird's-eye-view, the bulges look like sets of concentric
rings. The rings on the bulges are ridges and valleys. Numerous
volcanoes and lava flows dot the bulges, which are called coronas.
   Stofan said the bulges are formed by the same kind of upwelling
of molten rock that created the Hawaiian Islands.
   On Wednesday, Magellan orbited Venus for the 551st time since
arriving at the planet Aug. 10.
   It has used its picture-making radar to peer through Venus'
thick clouds during 288 of those orbits since mapping started Sept.
15. Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in May 1989.
   About 30 of the coronas were found on Venus by the Soviet Venera
15 and 16 orbiters in 1983 and 1984. But the Venera spacecraft
couldn't determine if they were bulges or depressions caused by
gargantuan meteorites.
   Magellan is examining the planet with a more sophisticated radar
that makes much more detailed pictures and can also calculate
surface topography.
