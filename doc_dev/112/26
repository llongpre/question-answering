<LEADPARA>  Among all the bright radar reflections coming from mountains on Venus there is
a single exception. The second-highest peak on the planet shows up dark,
leading scientists to think it may be an active volcano.;   Some special
mineral component gives mountaintops on Venus exceptionally high reflectivity
on radar, said John Wood of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's something that makes it behave like the opposite of the Stealth
bomber," he said.;   But Maat Mons, a peak about the size of Hawaii's Mauna
Loa, seems to lack the mineral.;   "Fresh lava has poured out onto the summit
relatively recently," Wood told a news conference Tuesday as the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration released pictures taken by radar cameras
on the Magellan space probe. He said "recently" could mean the past few
years.;   From earlier images, Magellan scientists had concluded that there
had been a huge recent landslide on Venus. If that were the case, the planet
would still be geologically active, complete with Venus quakes.;   But project
scientist Steve Saunders of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena said
most investigators have changed their mind. They now feel that the
before-and-after appearance of the "landslide" may just have been a radar
fluke, he said. "We still feel it's somewhat ambiguous," he said.;   Most of
the surface material on Venus is neither rock nor the same material that
erupted from volcanoes, said Wood. It is covered with material that has
weathered into soil in the planet's warm, chemically reactive atmosphere for
millions or hundreds of millions of years. That soil is quite different from
materials in the original rock.;   At low altitudes on the windswept planet,
the temperature is about 170 degrees Fahrenheit hotter than it is on
elevations. One mineral, an iron sulfide, appears in soils only at altitudes
greater than three miles and its presence increases the radar reflectivity.;  
"If weathering is what produces the mineral that makes the other peaks
radar-bright, the most obvious answer is that the summit of Maat Mons has not
been weathered," Wood said. "Why? Most likely because it hasn't had time to be
weathered.";   He said the volcanic eruption may have happened within the last
few years.;   The Magellan has mapped 92 percent of the surface of Venus,
Earth's nearest neighbor planet. It completed its first eight-month cycle on
May 15 and now is in its second tour of mapping the entire planet, with its
camera viewing the surface from a slightly different angle.;   "We now have a
better global map of Venus than we have of Earth," said Saunders.;   By
combining the images, scientists have produced three-dimensional views and by
feeding data into computers created a stunning low-level aerial tour of the
planet.;   "We see the face of a new planet," Saunders said. While Soviet and
American space probes have studied Venus since 1962, "in that time we've never
known what the planet looks like," he said.  </TEXT>
