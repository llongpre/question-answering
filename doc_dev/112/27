   A bedeviled, beleaguered NASA is hoping
the Magellan spacecraft's rendezvous with Venus next month will
provide our best look yet at Earth's hellishly hot neighbor.
   If all goes according to plan, the $413 million unmanned device,
centerpiece of a $744 million mission, will orbit the
cloud-shrouded planet on Aug. 10 after a 15-month journey from
Earth. And NASA desperately wants everything to go according to
plan.
   ``This thing must succeed because of the Hubble Space Telescope
effect and the generally bad impression we've all been getting of
how NASA has been conducting its affairs lately,'' said Steve
Saunders, the Magellan project's chief scientist.
   But those setbacks _ the crippling of the $1.5 billion Hubble
observatory due to mirror imperfections; the temporary grounding of
the space shuttles due to hydrogen fuel leaks _ have not dimmed the
agency's enthusiasm for Magellan.
   ``We've dreamed about the sights we would see. Now it's about to
happen,'' said Phil Allin, a Magellan project official at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Named for 16th century explorer Ferdinand Magellan, the craft's
radar will penetrate acid-laden Venusian clouds to make pictures
and maps 10 times more detailed than the best previous images.
   That will help geologists understand forces that sculpted Venus
to create flat lowlands, hilly plains and continent-like highlands
capped by peaks such as 35,400-foot Mount Maxwell, which is a mile
taller than Earth's Mount Everest.
   NASA says Magellan's radar will reveal unprecedented details of
the planet's terrain, a landscape shaped by meteorite craters, tens
of thousands of volcanoes, and perhaps movements of gargantuan
blocks of the planet's crust _ a process that may be similar to
continental drift on Earth.
   The 3.7-ton spacecraft also will look for ancient shorelines and
channels to learn if Venus once had oceans and rivers, before its
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped the sun's heat in a runaway
``greenhouse effect.''
   Such global warming makes modern Venus a bone-dry, 900-degree
Fahrenheit oven with an atmospheric pressure 90 times greater than
Earth's.
   Magellan's mission ``is the capstone of the exploration of the
inner planets,'' said Jim Head, a member of the Magellan science
team and a geologist at Brown University in Providence, R.I.
   ``We've seen the surfaces of the moon, Mars, the Earth and
Mercury, but Venus always has been obscured by the clouds and we've
never gotten a good global view of it.''
   The 21-foot-long Magellan was released from the cargo bay of
space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, then launched on its
roundabout, 806 million-mile voyage by an inertial upper-stage
rocket.
   At 9:31 a.m. PDT on Aug. 10, Magellan will fire its solid-fueled
Star rocket to slow down and go into a elliptical, nearly polar
orbit that ranges from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles above Venus.
   After a few weeks of tests, the spacecraft will bounce radar
waves off Venus to make pictures and topographic maps of 70 percent
to 90 percent of the surface. Meanwhile, the planet will rotate
once on its axis during a single Venusian day, which equals 243
Earth days.
   ``It's going to give us a map of Venus that in many ways is
better than anything we have for the whole Earth,'' where most of
the ocean floor hasn't been mapped in detail, Saunders said.
   If scientists are lucky, Magellan may tell them if Venusian
volcanoes are active, if movements of the planet's crust produce
``Venus quakes,'' and if those movements are more like Earth's
drifting continents or like the upward boiling of molten rock that
created Hawaii.
   Venus is the planet most like Earth in terms of size, density
and mass, and also is Earth's nearest neighbor, other than the
moon. Yet its clouds prevent the surface from being seen by
telescopes or optical cameras aboard orbiting spaceships.
   About 20 spacecraft have visited Venus since the early 1960s,
some deploying landers that photographed small parts of the
surface. Pictures also were made by transmitting radar waves from
Earth, and from NASA's Pioneer Venus orbiter in 1978 and the Soviet
Union's Venera 15 and 16 orbiters in 1983.
   But the best radar pictures until now could distinguish only
those landscape features wider than about 1\ miles. Saunders said
Magellan's pictures will be roughly 10 times better, capturing
features as small as 260 yards, about the length of 2{ football
fields.
   Magellan will take 3 hours and 11 minutes to orbit Venus once.
During each orbit, Magellan will spend 37 minutes as it moves from
north to south bouncing radar off a swath of Venus' surface about
10,000 miles long but only 16 miles wide. The information will be
stored on two tape recorders.
   During the rest of each orbit, Magellan will radio the
information back to Earth, where it will be received by
230-foot-wide, dish-shaped antennas at NASA's Deep Space Network
stations in California, Spain and Australia.
   Computers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory will assemble the data
into pictures and topographic maps of each swath. The swaths _
nicknamed ``noodles'' because they are so long and narrow _ then
will be assembled into pictures covering larger areas of the planet.
   ``Mapping a whole new planet will return an enormous amount of
data that will keep geologists busy for a long time,'' Saunders
said. ``If you printed it in books, it would fill a shelf about 10
miles long. It's very humbling.''
   Magellan's main 243-day mapping mission will miss the south
polar regions. NASA is expected to approve more 243-day mapping
cycles. A total of three are needed to map the entire planet.
   Cost of the Magellan mission through the first 243-day mapping
cycle is $744 million, including the cost of launching the
spacecraft from the shuttle, said Bill Dimmer of NASA's
comptroller's office in Washington. The spacecraft and its
instruments account for $413 million of that total, he said.
