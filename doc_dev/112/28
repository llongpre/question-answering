   A ground control computer error prompted
the Magellan spacecraft to briefly halt its mapping expedition of
Venus, but NASA officials said the probe remained in contact with
Earth.
   The computer glitch occurred late Friday night. The
multimillion-dollar craft was expected to resume its charting
mission early today, NASA said in a statement.
   Magellan stopped mapping when an onboard computer detected
errors in commands being sent from ground control computers, NASA
said.
   It was the second report of problems with the craft's mapping
mission in eight days. The Magellan signal was lost for 40 minutes
on Nov. 15. Signals were lost twice in August.
   Flight controllers said some mapping orbits would be lost, but
the craft did not lose contact with Earth.
   Engineers have lost contact with Magellan three times for
reasons not yet fully understood, but believed to be electric
static interfering with a spacecraft computer.
   Magellan was launched from Space Shuttle Atlantis on May, 4,
1989. It went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and formally
started its $744 million mapping mission Sept. 15.
   Magellan uses radar to map terrain through thick clouds covering
Venus. It has sent back pictures of the planet's fractured volcanic
surface, revealing numerous lava flows, volcanoes, quake faults and
Los Angeles-sized meteorite impact craters.
