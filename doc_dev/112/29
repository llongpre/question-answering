   Engineers lost radio contact with the
Magellan spacecraft Tuesday night for the second time in five days,
NASA said.
   Scientists weren't immediately sure if the spacecraft's computer
circuits would send out a radio beam in an attempt to re-establish
communication with Earth, as the Venus-orbiting craft is supposed
to do in an emergency, NASA said.
   Magellan's mission is to map up to 90 percent of Venus' surface
using radar to peer through the planet's thick clouds, which
prevent the use of optical cameras. The spacecraft went into orbit
around Venus Aug. 10 after a roundabout, 948-million-mile trip. It
was launched from the shuttle Atlantis 15 months ago.
   ``They lost it at 7:03 p.m. PDT'' while tracking the craft with
a NASA antenna dish near Canberra, Australia, said Jim Doyle,
spokesman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The mishap came only hours after NASA released the spacecraft's
first pictures of Earth's closest planetary neighbor. They showed
Venus has quake faults, lava flows like those in Hawaii and Idaho,
and long, parallel valleys and ridges similar to those between the
Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
   The loss of Magellan, the centerpiece of a $744 million mission
to explore Venus, would be a major blow to NASA, which grounded the
shuttle fleet temporarily because of fuel leaks and found the
Hubble Space Telescope had a flawed mirror.
   Doyle said that if the craft was beaming radio waves across the
sky while spinning _ as it is supposed to do to in an emergency _
engineers could re-establish intermittent contact between 12:03 and
12:30 a.m. PDT Wednesday.
   Less than seven hours before contact broke off, project manager
Tony Spear said that as far as engineers could tell, ``the
spacecraft is healthy,'' despite a loss of contact for more than 14
hours starting last Thursday night.
   The spacecraft's automatic self-protection system made Magellan
re-establish with NASA engineers last Friday morning. Then, they
sent Magellan a command to make it stop spinning and stay in touch
with Earth.
   Engineers said they still haven't figured out why they lost
contact with Magellan last week.
   One leading theory is that a cosmic ray or a high-energy
particle from the sun caused a blip in Magellan's computer memory,
said spacecraft system engineer John Slonski.
   ``We're not ruling out a software flaw or some hardware
problem'' or perhaps some unknown electrical fields surrounding
Venus, Spear said.
   Cosmic ray ``hits'' on spacecraft electronics can be expected to
interfere with Magellan about once each year, Spear said. Similar
events occasionally have disrupted the Pioneer Venus Orbiter,
launched in 1978, and the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites in
Earth orbit, Slonski said.
   The pictures released Tuesday were taken during an Aug. 16 test
when Magellan bounced its radar beam off Venus for the first time.
   As promised by NASA, the pictures are 10 times more detailed
than the best radar images of Venus made by the Soviet Venera 15
and 16 spacecraft and by the radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto
Rico. They show details as small as 400 feet across, or a third
bigger than the length of a football field.
   The large number of fractures and ``Venusquake'' faults seen in
images from the spacecraft suggest the crustal movements that
shaped the landscape are ``perhaps even more violent than I
imagined before,'' said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist
at Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``Overlapping lava flows of various ages'' and six to 10 miles
wide appear as bright and dark splotches, he said.
   But Saunders said the pictures don't yet show any of Venus'
major volcanoes, whether any of them are active or if the planet's
crust is broken into the kind of drifting plates that carry whole
continents across the face of the Earth. Previous spacecraft
revealed numerous mountainous volcanoes.
   The lava flows are ``similar geologically to volcanic deposits
seen on Earth at Hawaii and the Snake River Plains in Idaho,'' NASA
said in a statement.
   The parallel sets of elongated valleys and ridges resemble those
in the basin-and-range province of the intermountain region of Utah
and Nevada, or at the Great Rift Valley in eastern Africa. They
show that at least part of Venus' crust has been stretched apart,
Saunders said.
