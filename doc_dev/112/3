   The Magellan spacecraft has found
evidence that ocean-sized floods of molten rock once inundated more
than half the surface of Venus.
   NASA scientists said they don't yet know if there was one great
outpouring of lava from cracks in Venus or a series of smaller
flows, each hundreds of thousands of square miles, that engulfed
parts of Venus at different times.
   The scientists at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory
reported the findings Wednesday.
   Magellan uses radar to make pictures of cloud-covered Venus. The
spacecraft was launched from space shuttle Atlantis in May 1989,
went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 and formally began making
maps and pictures of the planet on Sept. 15.
   Geologist Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist, said he
favors the view that the lava gushed out of cracks called vents in
a global set of eruptions that happened all at once, maybe 400
million years ago.
   Brown University geologist and Magellan scientist Jim Head said,
however, the evidence is incomplete.
   ``There's no question that the vast majority of the surface of
Venus has been formed by lava flows and volcanic activity,'' he
said. ``But the question is, did it all happen catastrophically?''
   The lava covers roughly 60 percent of the planet, according to
Saunders.
   Saunders said he began to suspect Venus was subject to such
catastrophic volcanic activity because Magellan's pictures of Venus
show the planet has fewer large meteorite impact craters than
Earth's moon, and because ``the ones we find are all relatively
fresh.''
   That suggests ``there's a process of very widespread volcanism
that occurs from time to time that destroys all the craters - and
everything else,'' he said.
   Saunders said Venus' widespread lava flooding was similar to,
but much larger than, vast lava deposits such as India's Deccan
Traps and the Pacific Northwest's Columbia River basalts.
   The Deccan lava floods happened when Earth's crust split open as
India drifted away from Africa about 66 million years ago, allowing
huge volumes of molten rock to pour onto the landscape.
   The Columbia River basalts, which formed in massive eruptions
roughly 12 million to 20 million years ago, cover much of the
Pacific Northwest east of the Cascade Range.
   Magellan's $744 million map-making mission was suspended Oct. 26
because the sun is lined up almost directly between Venus and the
Earth, impairing communications between controllers and the
spacecraft. The suspension also was meant to allow engineers time
to fix Magellan's wobbling solar power panels.
   NASA hopes to resume mapping Saturday.
