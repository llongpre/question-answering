   A runaway ``greenhouse effect'' has
eliminated any trace of water. Volcanoes number not in the hundreds
or thousands, but the hundreds of thousands. Its crushing
atmospheric pressure, suffice it to say, could never support
anything resembling human life.
   Venus is not exactly Kansas.
   For eight months beginning in August 1990, the space probe
Magellan will circle the second planet from the Sun, using
computer-enhanced radar images to study a planet so inhospitable
that its 900-degree surface temperature would melt lead.
   Yet, for all its alien qualities, scientists think the Magellan
mission will yield valuable information about the formation of
Earth.
   ``The most likely scenario is that we'll find something that
will completely astound and baffle us,'' said Steve Saunders,
Magellan's chief scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena. The craft was being ferried into space aboard the shuttle
Atlantis, to be launched from Earth orbit on its 15-month
trajectory to Venus.
   Pictures from Magellan should help scientists deduce ``the
probability you're going to find Earth-like planets _ and life _
somewhere else,'' said geologist Laurence Soderblom, a scientist
working on the Magellan project.
   Peering through acid-laden clouds, Magellan should give
scientists their best look yet at a planet so outwardly different
from the garden of Earth yet apparently shaped by the same geologic
processes.
   ``Of all the planets in the solar system, Venus is most like our
own Earth in size, mass and distance from the sun,'' NASA says.
   Among the common forces, scientists say, are volcanic eruptions,
meteorite impacts and, perhaps, continental drift, the evolutionary
movement of huge land masses. Magellan will also look for evidence
of wind and water erosion and test the bounds of Venus' gravity.
   The image of Venus formed by pictures taken from earlier U.S.
and Soviet space probes is of a planet where molten rock lies so
close to the solid crust surface that impacting meteorites might
produce volcanic eruptions, where hundreds of thousands of
volcanoes stretch for thousands of miles across lowland plains,
where continent-sized highlands sprout mountains dwarfing Everest.
   Magellan, once it begins orbiting Venus on Aug. 10, 1990, will
look for ancient stream channels, shorelines and other evidence the
planet once may have had oceans. Scientists believe an unchecked
``greenhouse effect'' _ in which the carbon dioxide atmosphere
acted like greenhouse glass and trapped solar heat _ raised the
temperature until water disappeared.
   It's a $550-million project with the scientific world watching.
   ``Part of the answer is knowing whether Earth is a fluke or just
one of the natural consequences of the evolution of a generic solar
system,'' said Soderblom, who works for the U.S. Geological Survey
in Flagstaff, Ariz.
   Scientists will probe the gravity forces of Venus by plotting
the path of Magellan as it swoops to within 155 miles of the
planet's surface and then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977
miles.
   In looking for similarities between Venus and Earth, scientists
begin by noting that they are roughly the same size, weight and
distance from the Sun, and are both bigger than Earth's moon,
Mercury and Mars.
   Heavenly bodies ``are a lot like potatoes. The big ones stay hot
for a long time, and the little ones cool off quickly,'' said
Saunders, himself a geologist.
   The moon, Mercury and Mars have cold surfaces free of
continental drift. Because a planet's internal heat ``drives the
geological machinery,'' however, scientists believe Venus and Earth
both give off heat through volcanic activity and movements of
gargantuan pieces of rock along the planetary crust, Saunders said.
   Magellan should help scientists learn if any of the Venusian
volcanoes are still erupting and how crustal rock movements differs
from that on Earth.
   Rock in Earth's crust is created and recycled in a conveyor-belt
manner. Hot crustal rock is born along midocean ridges _ undersea
mountain chains thousands of miles long. New crust is pushed away
from these ridges as more rock emerges. The crust eventually
collides with lighter continental rock, such as at the ``subduction
zone'' where Pacific seafloor rock sinks beneath Alaska, Washington
and Oregon.
   Heat is released as sinking rock melts, creating volcanoes.
   Earth releases most of its heat at midocean ridges and
subduction zones. Saunders and Gerald Schaber, another USGS
geologist, believe Venus loses its internal heat mostly through
``hot spot'' volcanoes.
   On Earth, such volcanoes form where molten rock rises through
thin parts of the crust, such as in Hawaii. But there's evidence
that Venus has crustal movement similar to Earth and that the
volcanic ranges may be the Venusian equivalent of Earth's midocean
ridges.
   No one yet has found conclusive evidence of subduction zones on
Venus. In places, however, folded mountains and valleys are
squeezed up against Venus' continent-like highlands, Aphrodite and
Ishtar, the latter of which has mountains taller than Everest.
   These regions look something like Earth's Himalayas, mountains
formed when India smashed into China. So crustal movements on Venus
may be ``thin-skinned,'' forming folded mountains without large
chunks of crustal rock diving deep into the planet, Schaber said.
   If large plates of Venus' crustal rock are in motion, ``you can
bet there's Venusquakes,'' he added.
