   NASA says Magellan's $744 million
mission to map the rugged surface of Venus will begin later this
month even if engineers can't figure out why they twice lost radio
contact with the spacecraft.
   ``We're not willing to wait to understand what happened,''
Magellan experiment representative Steve Wall at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory said Wednesday.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after a
looping, 948-million-mile trip that began when the spacecraft was
launched from the shuttle Atlantis 16 months ago.
   Magellan made its first pictures of Venus during an Aug. 16 test
but lost touch with Earth that night for 14 hours and lost contact
again for 17{ hours starting Aug. 21.
   Engineers will continue trying to determine the cause of the
failures, but computer commands being sent to Magellan should
enable engineers to restore contact quickly if it is lost again,
Wall said.
   Magellan is designed to use radar to peer through Venus' thick
clouds and make the most detailed maps and pictures yet of the
planet's deformed surface. The communications trouble delayed the
start of mapping last week.
   Officials expect to start the mapping sometime late this month,
Wall said.
   Magellan and Venus are about 153 million miles from Earth.
   The spaceship's initial pictures showed long faults, other areas
crisscrossed by many faults in a pattern resembling broken
automobile safety glass, solidified lava flows, volcanic cinder
cones, meteorite impact craters and extensive valleys and ridges.
