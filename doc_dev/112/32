   Here are some unusual facts about the
Magellan spacecraft and Venus, culled from ``The Magellan Venus
Explorer's Guide'' and other NASA publications:
   _Getting Magellan to Venus required three main engines and two
rockets on the shuttle Atlantis that carried it into Earth orbit,
two rockets on the inertial upper-stage booster that hurled it
toward Venus, and one braking rocket to slow it down for entry into
orbit around Venus. But for 99 percent of Magellan's
948-million-mile trip to Venus, it cruised without power.
   _Venus is named for the Roman goddess of love. It's
continent-like highlands are named after Aphrodite, the Greek love
goddess, and Ishtar, the Baylonian love goddess.
   _Temperatures and pressures on Venus are equivalent to
conditions inside a 900-degree Fahrenheit self-cleaning oven 3,000
feet below the surface of an ocean on Earth.
   _Magellan will collect and send to Earth more computerized
information than the combined total from all previous U.S. missions
to other planets.
   _After about a dozen years, Magellan will lack enough propellant
to fire its thrusters and maintain its orbit. The orbit will decay
and the spacecraft eventually will plunge into the Venusian
atmosphere and burn up.
   _When Magellan uses its radar to map Venus' landscape, it will
consume 200 watts of electricity, about the same as a bright floor
lamp.
   _If Magellan flew over Earth's Mount St. Helens volcano, it
could recognize it as a mountain. The radars on Soviets' Venera 15
and 16 spacecraft, which were launched in 1983, wouldn't be able to
distinguish Mount St. Helens from a meteorite impact crater.
   _The Soviet Union named two craters on Venus after teacher
Sharon McAuliffe and astronaut Judith Resnick, who were among seven
crew members killed when Challenger exploded after liftoff in 1986.
   _When Magellan fired its braking rocket to start orbiting Venus
on Friday, the spacecraft experienced a maximum force seven times
the force of gravity on Earth.
   _During each orbit around Venus, Magellan will travel about
38,314 miles as an average speed of 12,163 mph.
