   NASA armed Magellan's rocket Wednesday,
preparing the spacecraft to orbit Venus for a $744 million mission
to take the best radar pictures yet of the surface of the
cloud-covered planet.
   The agency has recently been embarrassed by a mirror defect that
crippled the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope and hydrogen leaks
that temporarily grounded the space shuttle fleet.
   So engineers at Jet Propulsion Laboratory are intent on making
sure the unmanned Magellan successfully fires its rocket Friday to
go into near-polar orbit around Venus.
   If all goes well, engineers will spend most of the month testing
Magellan's radar and making adjustments. Sometime between Aug. 26
and Sept. 1, Magellan will start formal use of its radar to peer
through thick Venusian clouds and map the planet.
   ``I'm able to sleep as long as I don't drink caffeine, but I
suspect I'm going to be very nervous'' until Magellan is safely in
orbit, said Magellan project manager Tony Spear. ``It's like your
life can go either one direction or another, so I don't plan after
Friday right now.''
   The 3.7-ton Magellan was released from the cargo bay of the
shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989, then fired an inertial upper-stage
booster rocket to launch it on a looping, 948-million-mile trip to
the second planet from the sun.
   Engineers received a radio signal from Magellan on Wednesday
indicating the spacecraft successfully completed an electronic
circuit to arm a solid-fuel Star rocket, Spear said.
   At 9:32 a.m. PDT Friday, a computer program will automatically
order the rocket to fire for 83 seconds. The rocket, firing
forward, will reduce Magellan's speed from 24,600 mph to about
18,600 mph. That will allow Magellan to be captured by Venus'
gravity into an orbit ranging from 171 miles to almost 5,000 miles
above the planet.
   The spacecraft will be behind Venus when the rocket ignites, and
won't emerge from Venus' shadow until about 9:54 a.m. Radio signals
from Magellan take almost 13 minutes to reach Earth. So it will be
about 10:07 a.m. PDT when engineers receive a radio signal
indicating Magellan is in orbit.
   If they receive the signal five minutes early, that will mean
the rocket didn't fire and Magellan is speeding past Venus in
another major failure for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   But Spear is optimistic the mission will work.
   ``We trust our spacecraft,' he said. ``It's demonstrated it
knows how to take instructions.''
   At midmorning Wednesday, Magellan was 519,095 miles from Venus
and 143 million miles from Earth. It was traveling at 10,189 mph,
increasing speed as it was tugged by Venusian gravity.
   Magellan will be able to detect Venusian surface features larger
than the length of about 2{ football fields. So its pictures will
be about 10 times more detailed than the best pictures obtained by
radars on Earth or aboard some of the two dozen spacecraft that
have visited the planet before.
   Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor other than the moon, and the
two planets are similar in size and density. Magellan may reveal
whether the two planets also have similar geological processes,
including movements of gargantuan plates of shifting crustal rock.
   It also may detect evidence of ``Venusquakes,'' determine if any
of the planet's tens of thousands of volcanoes are erupting, and
learn if Venus had oceans before a runaway ``greenhouse effect''
raised its surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Magellan's prime mission is to map 70 percent to 90 percent of
the planet during the first 243-day cycle, equal to one Venus day.
NASA is expected to approve continued operation. Three 243-day
mapping cycles are needed to map the entire planet.
   NASA's comptroller's office says the total cost of the Magellan
mission is $744 million, including $413 million for the spacecraft
and its instruments.
