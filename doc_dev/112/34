   Magellan's mission to map Venus has been
delayed again, until late September, while NASA tries to figure out
why the spacecraft keeps losing touch with Earth.
   ``Have patience with us. We're going to make it work,'' Tony
Spear, Magellan project manager at the space agency's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, said Tuesday.
   Magellan's radio link to Earth failed for 14 hours starting Aug.
16 and for 17{ hours beginning Aug. 21, while the craft was in
orbit around Venus.
   Spear said he organized a team of 40 engineers from the lab and
from Martin Marietta Corp., which built Magellan in Denver, to
determine what is wrong with the spacecraft and fix it.
   Before Magellan started malfunctioning, NASA planned for it to
make pictures and maps of Venus on a regular basis starting
Saturday. Last week, Spear said engineers hoped to have Magellan
working properly by mid-September.
   Now, he said, ``We're targeting for the last week in September
to start mapping.''
   Mapping is being delayed not only to fix Magellan but also
because the craft's troubles have left engineers ``mentally and
physically exhausted,'' Spear said. ``We've decided to give the
team three days off around Labor Day.''
   Magellan's $744 million mission is to use radar to peer through
Venus' thick clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the
planet's surface. The spacecraft was launched from space shuttle
Atlantis in May 1989.
   Pictures made during an Aug. 16 test showed quake faults, vast
solidified lava flows, cinder cones, a lava-filled meteorite impact
crater and countless valleys and mountain ridges on Earth's nearest
planetary neighbor.
   Magellan functioned almost flawlessly during the 15 months it
traveled a looping, 948-million-mile route to Venus. One major
theory is that something went wrong when the craft went into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10, Spear said.
   NASA also has been troubled by the temporary grounding of the
shuttle fleet and a focusing flaw on the Hubble Space Telescope.
   Spear said engineeers will try to determine if previously
unknown electrical fields or particles around Venus are disrupting
Magellan's electronics.
   The engineers will also examine a computer that ran amok during
the communications failures and look at changes in Magellan as it
went into orbit, including the possibility of short circuits.
   Spear ruled out the possibility, raised Friday, that Magellan's
braking rocket may have failed to separate from the spacecraft
after it went into orbit.
