   NASA officials hope that a
disassembled spacecraft sitting in crates at a hangar Wednesday
will be en route to Venus by April as America's first
interplanetary explorer in 11 years.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration showed off the
scattered pieces of the Magellan spacecraft to reporters and
photographers four days after the spacecraft's arrival by truck
from the Martin Marietta plant in Denver.
   If all goes well, the parts will be assembled and checked out
over the next few months and then transported to the launch pad in
March to be loaded aboard the space shuttle Atlantis, said Jo Ann
Morgan, the Kennedy Space Center's director of payloads projects
management.
   The scheduled launch date is April 28.
   NASA will have only 25 days, until May 23, to get Atlantis off
the pad before Venus moves out of its favorable alignment with
Earth. Otherwise the Magellan voyage will have to be delayed about
two years, said Charles Brown, Magellan program manager for Martin
Marietta, which built the probe for NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Once the shuttle is in orbit, the crew will release Magellan
from the cargo bay and a rocket will start it on the 466-day trip
to Venus.
   It will be the first planetary probe launched from a shuttle as
well as the first U.S. planetary mission since two Pioneer
spacecraft were dispatched in 1978 to study Venus' atmosphere.
   Magellan is to settle into an elliptical orbit around Venus
ranging from 155 miles to 1,180 miles above the surface. Each
circuit of the planet will take 3.1 days, and during the 40 minutes
the craft is nearest the surface, an advanced radar will peer
through the constant cloud layer and obtain images of the surface,
which will be relayed to an Earth station.
   During each orbit, the radar, supplied by Hughes Aircraft Co.,
will map a swath of surface 15 miles wide and 10,000 miles long.
Brown said it would take 1,853 such swaths, recorded over 243 days,
to chart the entire planet.
   ``The spacecraft will be conducting basic research about how
Venus was formed,'' Brown told a news conference. ``To find out, we
need to know the topography of the planet.
   ``We now have the topography of Earth, the moon, Mars and
Mercury, but we don't have the topography of Venus because of the
cloud cover,'' he said. ``The imaging radar will give us that
topography.''
   Brown said Magellan will enable scientists for the first time to
study detailed images of Venus like those formed by wind or flowing
liquid, craters and large landslides.
   While Venus is Earth's closest neighbor in the solar system, the
two planets are vastly different. Venus has a surface temperature
of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, its atmopshere is almost entirely
carbon dioxide, and its atmospheric pressure is 90 times that of
Earth.
   Brown said one goal of the mission is to try to learn why the
two planets evolved so differently.
