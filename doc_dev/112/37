   Commands radioed 152 million miles
across the solar system Saturday made the errant Magellan
spacecraft easier to control as it orbits Venus, NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory said.
   Engineers have not determined why the spacecraft has suffered
two long communications blackouts but were hopeful that its $744
million mission to map the planet with radar would begin this month.
   Controllers began sending commands to Magellan early Saturday to
awaken it from a so-called deep-safe mode and put it in a state
called random access memory control.
   Nearly six hours after beginning the series of orders, the lab
received Magellan's confirmation of the new configuration.
   Radio signals take 27 minutes, 10 seconds to travel from Earth
to Venus and back. Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
   Magellan appeared to be stable, its solar panels were properly
pointed at the sun and its batteries were charged, the lab said in
a statement.
   The new condition will allow flight controllers to more easily
program Magellan's computers. In addition, data from Magellan can
tell engineers more about the spacecraft's condition, said JPL
spokesman Jim Doyle.
   Next week, engineers will do more to normalize the spacecraft's
operation. If that goes without a hitch, Magellan would be ordered
on Sept. 12 to send home radar data already stored on its tape
recorder and its radar sensor would resume operation two days later.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis in May
1989, and made a looping, 15-month, 948 million-mile journey to
Venus.
   The spacecraft entered orbit around the cloud-shrouded planet
Aug. 10, and things began to go wrong. The radio link from Magellan
to Earth failed for 14 hours starting Aug. 16 and for 17{ hours
beginning Aug. 21.
   Controllers put Magellan into deep-safe mode, which kept its
solar array pointed toward the sun so its batteries would stay
charged.
   Other spacecraft have passed near Venus, but they returned
images far less detailed than Magellan can produce.
   Images of Venus sent by Magellan after an Aug. 16 test of the
radar-mapping system showed extensive seismic faults, enormous
flows of solidified lava, cinder cones, a meteorite impact crater
filled with lava and innumerable valleys and mountain ridges.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had originally
planned for Magellan to begin its mapping survey by the end of
August.
