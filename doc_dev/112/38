   Magellan sent information to Earth today
to help engineers learn why they temporarily lost contact with the
spacecraft after its first pictures displayed quake faults,
volcanic cinder cones and plains made of lava flows on Venus.
   ``After steady contact with the spacecraft was re-established
Friday night, engineers commanded the spacecraft to transmit all of
the information in its computer memories back to Earth. This will
continue throughout the weekend,'' said Mary Beth Murrill,
spokeswoman for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   She said it might take days to figure out why Magellan lost
contact with Earth on Thursday night after it sent back its first
test pictures of Venus _ images that had scientists marveling.
   ``The radar works far better than we ever dreamed it would,''
said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist. ``The kind of
faulting we see would certainly mean there are `Venusquakes.'''
   The pictures will be released Tuesday, the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration said in a statement issued Friday night.
   Before the problem developed, Magellan was scheduled to start
its formal mapping mission Aug. 29, using its radar to peer through
Venus' thick clouds. Murrill said a delay is likely, but engineers
haven't yet announced their plans.
   Engineers today continued the process of returning Magellan to
normal operation. It lost touch with Earth for almost 15 hours
starting Thursday night, then continued to go in and out of radio
contact over the next eight hours.
   A computer command sent to Magellan on Friday night restored
steady radio contact at 7:11 p.m. PDT.
   ``We jumped up and clapped,'' said Tommy Thompson, Magellan
science operations manager. `It was just like the home team scoring
a touchdown.''
   Thompson said engineers expected to remain in touch with
Magellan except when it swings behind Venus, when it normally is
unable to send or receive signals from Earth. As of today, the two
planets were 147 million miles apart.
   Engineers will spend the coming days diagnosing the cause of the
communications breakdown and deciding how to prevent it from
happening again, Thompson added.
   Magellan was deployed May 4, 1989, from the shuttle Atlantis on
its $744 million mission to make the best maps and pictures yet of
Venus. The spaceship went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after
a looping 948-million-mile voyage.
   Less detailed radar pictures of Venus from other U.S. and Soviet
spacecraft and from a radio telescope at Arecibo, Puerto Rico,
revealed signs of faults on Venus and also found tens of thousands
of volcanoes, although scientists still don't know if any are
active.
   Magellan's first pictures showed in much better detail regions
that intensely faulted, and also ``clear indications a lot of
plains are (old) lava flows'' fractured by younger faults, Saunders
said.
   ``What we're seeing is some of the lava flows that came out of
large volcanoes, but we haven't seen any large volcanoes yet,'' he
added.
   Saunders said volcanic cinder cones in the pictures have craters
on top, and the cones range from three-fifths of a mile to 1 mile
wide. Their height hasn't yet been calculated.
   Magellan must pass over the same area twice to detect landscape
changes that would indicate volcanoes are erupting. It takes 243
Earth days for Venus to spin once beneath the nearly polar-orbiting
Magellan, so it will be at least eight months until Magellan will
be able to look for signs of active volcanoes.
   When Magellan first lost contact with Earth on Thursday night,
its sophisticated computer programs automatically put it into a
protective state of semi-hibernation called a ``safing mode,''
turning its solar panels to the sun to make sure it drew adequate
power, laboratory spokesman Jim Doyle said.
   Magellan automatically entered an even deeper hibernation Friday
morning, shutting down crucial systems to protect them but also
making the spacecraft start rotating as it beamed radio signals
into space.
   That assured some of the signals would reach Earth, but also
meant radio contact was intermittent throughout the day. The
command sent Friday night stopped the rotation and kept Magellan's
secondary antenna pointed toward Earth to maintain contact.
   Communication through the secondary antenna is slower than
through Magellan's main antenna. But the secondary antenna
broadcasts a much broader, cone-shaped radio beam, allowing contact
to be maintained more easily. NASA said controllers will switch
back to the main antenna sometime next week.
   Magellan's radio signals are tracked by 230-foot-wide, dish
antennas at Goldstone, Calif., and in Australia and Spain.
