   NASA scientists who bounced radio waves
off cloud-shrouded Venus detected huge blobs that may be lava flows
and rings that may be volcanic crater rims, both very bright and
possibly rich in fool's gold, a new study says.
   The study provides more evidence that Venus' volcanoes erupted
within the last few million years and possibly within recent
centuries, said researchers from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Their findings appear in Friday's issue of the journal Science,
coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Pioneer
Venus orbiter, a spacecraft that still circles the second planet
from the sun.
   JPL radar scientists Ray Jurgens and Martin Slade and geologist
R. Stephen Saunders transmitted radio waves from Goldstone to
Venus' equatorial region. Half the waves bounced back to three
210-foot-diameter, dish-shaped antennas at the Mojave Desert
facility.
   The fuzzy radar pictures revealed bright, or highly reflective,
rings of material on the surface, as well as bright blobs.
   The largest blob, measuring 350 miles long and 180 miles wide,
apparently is a large lava flow and has a large mound, possibly a
volcano, at its west end, Jurgens said.
   The largest ring is roughly 60 miles across and appears to be
the rim of a crater caused by a meteorite impact. But other rings
about 18 miles across may be rims of large volcanic craters called
calderas, he said.
   The researchers speculate the blobs and rings are so highly
reflective to radar because the lava flows and crater rims are rich
in iron pyrite or other metallic minerals blasted to the surface of
the planet by volcanic eruptions or meteorite impacts. Iron pyrite
is known as fool's gold because it looks like gold.
   Because fool's gold or other metallic minerals should decompose
and lose their reflectivity over time, the discovery ``certainly is
evidence of relatively recent volcanism,'' since old craters lack
bright rings, Jurgens said.
   It isn't possible to say whether ``recent'' means within the
last few million years or last few centuries because researchers
don't know how quickly rocks break down on Venus, said Jurgens and
Saunders, who is project scientist for the Magellan Venus Radar
Mapper spacecraft, set for launch next April.
   Radar readings from Pioneer suggested volcanoes existed on
Venus. Previous radar pictures made from Earth and by Soviet
spacecraft in 1983 revealed lava flows, volcanic craters and
craters from meteorite impacts.
   But researchers don't know if volcanoes still are active on the
planet, which is covered by thick, acid-laden carbon dioxide clouds
that prevent direct observation by telescopes.
   In 1984, scientists announced that Pioneer detected lightning
bolts and a 50-fold increase in sulfur dioxide concentrations in
Venus' atmosphere after 1978. Because lightning and sulfur dioxide
can be caused by eruptions, the discoveries suggested a gargantuan
volcano may have erupted shortly before 1978.
   Other studies also found highly reflective features on Venus'
mountains, but scientists debated whether the brightness was from
volcanic metallic minerals or simply artificial brightness created
by rough landscape.
   The blobs and rings found by the JPL study are the first highly
reflective features discovered on Venusian lowlands, and thus
support the theory that the brightness is caused by metallic
minerals, Jurgens said.
   ``It's a good working hypothesis to say these (blobs) are young
lava flows,'' but the radar images aren't good enough to determine
which rings are volcanic craters and which are impact craters, said
Harold Masursky, a planetary geologist with the U.S. Geological
Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz.
   ``We'll settle this argument with Magellan,'' which is scheduled
to reach Venus in August 1990 and map most of the planet using
radar, he said.
   ``Some of the big volcanoes on Venus may still be active, which
would be ... interesting,'' Masursky said. ``The only other places
we have ongoing volcanism are the Earth and (Jupiter's moon) Io.''
