   NASA engineers successfully capped a
daylong battle to stay in touch with Magellan on Friday after the
balky spacecraft's first pictures of Venus showed old lava flows,
cinder cones and faults created by ``Venusquakes.''
   After repeatedly losing and regaining contact with Magellan,
engineers sent a computer command to the spaceship Friday night
that restored regular communications at 7:11 p.m. PDT, said Tommy
Thompson, Magellan science manager at the agency's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   ``We jumped up and clapped,'' he said. `It was just like the
home team scoring a touchdown.''
   Thompson said engineers expected to remain in touch with
Magellan except when it flys behind Venus, when it normally is
unable to send or receive radio signals from Earth.
   An unknown problem made Magellan lose its radio link with Earth
on Thursday night as it orbited Venus 147 million miles from Earth.
Almost 15 hours later, as engineers held a news conference,
Magellan official Steve Wall rushed into the room to announce
contact had been re-established.
   But as the hours passed, NASA tracking stations in California,
Australia and Spain lost and regained Magellan's radio signal
because of built-in safety programs in the spacecraft's computers.
   When Magellan first dropped out of contact, sophisticated
computer programs put it in a protective ``safing mode'' so that
its solar panels pointed to the sun to draw power. Hours later, the
safety system made the spacecraft rotate until its antenna located
Earth and resumed communications, JPL spokesman Jim Doyle said.
   The spacecraft was programmed to keep rotating, which explained
why controllers kept losing and regaining contact, Doyle said.
   The command sent to Magellan on Friday night stopped the
spacecraft from rotating and kept its secondary antenna in
continuous communication with Earth except when the spacecraft is
behind Venus, Thompson said.
   Thompson said Magellan will be kept in its protective mode until
the cause of the initial loss of contact is understood and fixed.
   Magellan project manager Tony Spear was optimistic the problem
wouldn't seriously affect Magellan's $744 million mission to use
radar to make the best pictures and maps yet of Venus'
cloud-covered landscape.
   ``I have faith in the spacecraft,'' he said, admitting he was
surprised by the trouble.
   The communications problem developed shortly after Magellan
bounced radar waves off Venus for its first test pictures of
Earth's nearest planetary neighbor. The information used to make
the pictures was sent to Earth before contact was lost.
   ``We've got some raw images that look pretty damn good,'' Spear
said, adding the pictures would be released early next week despite
NASA's initial plans to wait until September.
   Project scientist Steve Saunders, who examined the pictures,
said they show old, hardened ``lava flows and faults and fractures
and (volcanic) cinder cones with craters on top.''
   ``The kind of faulting we see would certainly mean there are
Venusquakes,'' Saunders said.
   Earlier Soviet and U.S. spacecraft also revealed volcanic
features on Venus, although Magellan's images are supposed to be 10
times more detailed.
   Magellan won't be able to learn if any Venusian volcanoes are
active for at least eight months. That's because it must pass over
the same area of Venus twice before it can determine if the
landscape has been altered by an eruption.
   Saunders said Thursday's radar test returned far more pictures
than expected, covering several areas of the planet about 1,000
miles long by 15 miles wide. During normal mapping, which had been
scheduled to start Aug. 29, Magellan will make pictures of
noodle-shaped swaths of Venusian landscape about 10,000 miles long
by 15 or 16 miles wide. Those will be assembled into bigger
pictures.
   Magellan's headaches were the latest for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, which recently grounded its
shuttle fleet temporarily because of hydrogen leaks and had its
Hubble Space Telescope seriously impaired by a focusing flaw in a
mirror.
   Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989,
and went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after a roundabout 948
million-mile journey.
   Wall said engineers were out of contact with Magellan on
Thursday night as it turned away from Earth to get a fix on two
stars, a calibration the spaceship routinely performs to make sure
it can point properly.
   Magellan's radio signals are tracked by 230-foot-wide, dish
antennas at Goldstone, Calif., and in Australia and Spain.
   ``The assumption is that after it made a star calibration, it
looked at the wrong star and then couldn't point back to Earth
accurately,'' said Doyle. ``Then, the contact was lost.''
   Engineers believe Magellan detected some onboard problem, then
went into its protective mode. Spear said the spaceship probably
tried to get a fix on a ``guide star'' so it could figure out which
way it was pointing, but may have picked the wrong star or been
confused by stray sunlight reflecting off Venus.
   ``Most of us have been up most of the night'' dealing with the
problem, Spear said Friday.
   Venus is covered by thick clouds that prevent optical cameras
from viewing its landscape. Magellan radar is designed to send
radar waves through the clouds, then collect the reflected radar
echoes and send them to Earth in digital form. Computers at JPL
then can assemble them into maps and pictures.
   The spacecraft's radar was designed to distinguish surface
features as small as two football fields.
