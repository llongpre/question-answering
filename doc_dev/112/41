   Here are key facts about the Magellan
spacecraft, which is scheduled to go into orbit around Venus in
August:
   PRIMARY MISSION: To use radar to penetrate the clouds of Venus
and make pictures and maps of 70 percent to 90 percent of the
planet's surface with 10 times better detail than any previous
images. Magellan will reveal signs of forces that shaped the
planet, including volcanism, meteorite impacts and possibly wind,
water and large-scale movements of the planet's crust.
   EXTENDED MISSION: A single Venusian day _ the time it takes the
planet to rotate once on its axis _ lasts 243 Earth days.
Magellan's primary mission is to map the planet as it rotates once
below the polar-orbiting spacecraft. But NASA scientists expect to
obtain approval for additional 243-day mapping cycles so they can
make pictures and maps of most of the surface. The primary mission
will miss the planet's southernmost latitudes.
   COST: $744 million through the end of Magellan's primary 243-day
mapping effort, including $413 million for the spacecraft and its
instruments. NASA cut costs by building Magellan using some spare
parts from Voyager and Galileo spacecraft.
   LAUNCH: Deployed from cargo bay of space shuttle Atlantis on May
4, 1989, then launched by an inertial upper stage booster.
   THE VOYAGE: A 806 million-mile trip to Venus in 15 months,
requiring 1{ loops around the sun.
   PROPULSION: A solid-fueled Star 48B rocket is to put Magellan
into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. Twenty-four liquid-fueled
thrusters help point the spacecraft and adjust its trajectory.
   ORBIT: Magellan will orbit near Venus' poles once every 3 hours
and 11 minutes, at an altitude ranging from 171 miles to almost
5,000 miles.
   VITAL STATISTICS: Magellan is 21 feet long and 15 feet in
diameter, and weighs 7,410 pounds.
   INSTRUMENTS: Synthetic aperture radar is to send radar waves and
catch the reflected waves to make two-dimensional pictures of
Venus, measure elevations for topographic maps, and determine heat
emissions from Venus' surface to provide clues about surface
roughness and rock composition. Engineers on Earth will precisely
track Magellan's speed to measure changes in the strength of the
gravity field on various parts of Venus. That will yield clues
about the planet's interior.
   POWER SUPPLY: A pair of solar panels charge the spacecraft's two
nickel-cadmium batteries.
   COMMUNICATIONS: Magellan's 12-foot antenna dish radios
information back to 230-foot, dish-shaped antennas in Spain,
Australia and Goldstone, Calif. The radar information will be
relayed to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
where it will be assembled into maps and pictures.
   CONSTRUCTION: NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory managed the
project. Martin Marietta Corp. built the spacecraft in Denver.
Hughes Aircraft Co. built the radar in El Segundo, Calif.
