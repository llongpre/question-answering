   An alignment of the planets will
interfere with the Magellan spacecraft's ability to send pictures
of Venus back to Earth for the next six weeks beginning Sunday,
NASA says.
   During late October and early November, the sun was between
Venus and Earth, forcing a two-week halt to Magellan's $744 million
mission to use radar to map the surface of cloud-shrouded Venus.
   ``This time, Venus itself gets in the way,'' although mapping
can continue, said Steve Wall, Magellan experiment representative
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Because of the relative positions of Earth and Venus as they
orbit the sun, ``a straight line drawn from the spacecraft to the
Earth goes straight through Venus'' for part of each day during the
42-day period, Wall said Wednesday.
   Magellan has already shown Venus is marked by quake faults,
gargantuan flows of solidified lava and countless volcanoes, some
of which may be erupting now.
