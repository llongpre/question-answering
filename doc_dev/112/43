FICKLE MAGELLAN'S VENUS MAP MISSION ON HOLD;

Magellan's mission to map the rugged surface of Venus is being delayed again so 
a team of 40 engineers can figure out why the spacecraft keeps losing contact 
with Earth, a NASA official said today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're targeting for the last week in September to start mapping," said Tony 
Spear, Magellan project manager at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
Spear had said Friday that engineers hoped to fix the problem in time to have 
Magellan working properly by mid-September. Before Magellan started 
malfunctioning, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration planned for 
it to make pictures and maps of Venus on a regular basis starting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The spaceship remained in a protective "safing mode" today, Spear said during 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Engineers still haven't figured out why Magellan's radio link to Earth failed 
for 14 hours starting Aug. 16 and again for 17 1/2 hours beginning Aug. 21, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
So Spear said he organized a "tiger team" of 40 engineers from the laboratory 
and from Martin Marietta Corp., which built Magellan in Denver, to determine 
what is wrong with the spaceship and repair it. 
</P>
<P>
Magellan's $744-million mission is to use radar to peer through Venus' thick 
clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the planet's surface. It was 
launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Pictures made during an Aug. 16 radar test showed extensive "Venusquake" 
faults, vast flows of solidified lava, cinder cones, a lava-filled meteorite 
impact crater and countless valleys and mountain ridges on the surface of 
Earth's nearest planetary neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
Spear said one major theory is that something went wrong when Magellan entered 
orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. It functioned almost flawlessly during the 15 
months it traveled a looping path of 948 million miles from Earth. 
</P>
<P>
Spear ruled out the possibility, raised Friday, that Magellan's braking rocket 
may have failed to separate from the spacecraft after it went into Venus orbit. 
</P>
<P>
Mapping is being delayed not only because time is needed to fix Magellan, but 
also because the spacecraft's troubles have left engineers "mentally and 
physically exhausted," Spear said. "We've decided to give the team three days 
off around Labor Day." 
</P>
<P>
Engineers want to make sure Magellan doesn't break down again when mapping is 
in progress because "it's not good for people's hearts," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Spear, fully aware of NASA's problems stemming from temporary grounding of the 
shuttle fleet and a severe defect on the Hubble Space Telescope, appealed to 
the public to "have patience" with Magellan. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to make it work," he pledged. "Have confidence in us."
