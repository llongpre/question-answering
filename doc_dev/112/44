   NASA decided to suspend the Magellan
spacecraft's Venus map-making mission today, three days earlier
than planned, because a planetary lineup is affecting its
navigation and communications with Earth.
   It will be at least 12 days before Magellan can resume its $744
million mission to use radar to make pictures and maps of
cloud-covered Venus, said Jim Scott, mission director at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   The space agency had planned to halt mapping by Magellan for
nine days starting Monday.
   But laboratory spokesman Jim Doyle said increasing difficulty
with Magellan's navigation, communications with Earth, solar panels
and ability to make quality pictures prompted the decision to
suspend operations today.
   Scott said the problems may stem from an astronomical event
called ``superior conjunction.''
   That occurs next Thursday when Venus and Earth are at their
maximum distance from each other - about 161 million miles - and
the sun lies almost directly between the two planets.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989. It went into orbit around Venus 2{ months ago, and started
mapping Venus full-time Sept. 15.
   So far, its radar pictures have shown extensive quake faults, a
wide variety of volcanos and lava flows, Los Angeles-sized
meteorite impact craters and 600-mile-wide bulges that are like the
``hot spots'' on Earth's crust that created Hawaii.
