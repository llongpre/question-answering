   Magellan's mission to map the rugged
surface of Venus is being delayed again so a team of engineers can
figure out why the spacecraft keeps losing contact with Earth, a
NASA official said Tuesday.
   ``We're targeting for the last week in September to start
mapping,'' said Tony Spear, Magellan project manager at the space
agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Spear had said Friday that engineers hoped to fix the problem in
time to have Magellan working properly by mid-September. Before
Magellan started malfunctioning, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration planned for it to make pictures and maps of Venus on
a regular basis starting Sept. 1.
   The spaceship remained in a protective ``safing mode'' Tuesday,
Spear said during an interview.
   Engineers still haven't figured out why Magellan's radio link to
Earth failed for 14 hours starting Aug. 16 and for 17{ hours
beginning Aug. 21, he added.
   So Spear said he organized a ``tiger team'' of 40 engineers from
the laboratory and from Martin Marietta Corp., which built Magellan
in Denver, to determine what is wrong with the spaceship and fix it.
   Magellan's $744 million mission is to use radar to peer through
Venus' thick clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the
planet's surface. It was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on
May 4, 1989.
   Pictures made during an Aug. 16 radar test showed extensive
``Venusquake'' faults, vast flows of solidified lava, cinder cones,
a lava-filled meteorite impact crater and countless valleys and
mountain ridges on the surface of Earth's nearest planetary
neighbor.
   Spear said one major theory is that something went wrong when
Magellan entered orbit around Venus on Aug. 10. It functioned
almost flawlessly during the 15 months it traveled a looping path
of 948 million miles from Earth.
   Spear ruled out the possibility, raised Friday, that Magellan's
braking rocket may have failed to separate from the spacecraft
after it went into Venus orbit.
   Mapping is being delayed not only because time is needed to fix
Magellan, but also because the spacecraft's troubles have left
engineers ``mentally and physically exhausted,'' Spear said.
``We've decided to give the team three days off around Labor Day.''
   Engineers want to make sure Magellan doesn't break down again
when mapping is in progress because ``it's not good for people's
hearts,'' he added.
   Spear, fully aware of NASA's problems stemming from temporary
grounding of the shuttle fleet and a severe defect on the Hubble
Space Telescope, appealed to the public to have patience with
Magellan.
   ``We're going to make it work,'' he pledged. ``Have confidence
in us. We have one of the world's best teams working on this
problem.''
   Spear said the tiger team is divided into four groups. One will
try to understand and fix the overall problem. The second will look
at the environment around Venus to determine if previously unknown
electrical fields or particles are disrupting Magellan's
electronics.
   The third group will examine changes on Magellan as it went into
orbit, including the possibility of short circuits in plugs that
once connected the braking rocket to the spaceship. The fourth
group will study a backup computer that helps point Magellan. Spear
said the computer ran amok during both loss-of-contact incidents.
