   NASA restored a high-speed radio link
with Magellan that will allow a crucial test of the spacecraft on
Saturday and released more pictures of jagged lava flows and giant
volcanic craters on Venus.
   Engineers Wednesday pointed Magellan's main antenna toward
Earth, putting the high-speed communications on line for the first
time in four weeks and using the link to send home the contents of
the spacecraft's tape recorder.
   They they began analyzing the information for clues to why they
lost radio contact with the spacecraft for 14 hours starting Aug.
16 and for 17{ hours starting Aug. 21.
   Restoring the high-speed radio link was a key step toward
letting Magellan begin its $744 million mission to make highly
detailed maps and pictures of Venus using radar to penetrate the
planet's thick clouds.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory had been using a
secondary Magellan antenna to maintain contact with Earth.
Engineers figured that because the secondary antenna sends out a
broader beam than the main antenna, they would be less likely to
lose contact with the spacecraft if there were another glitch.
   Because of the communication problems, Magellan was to start its
mapping mission late this month, about a month behind schedule.
   But if all goes well during a radar test on Saturday, NASA might
simply pronounce the mapping under way then, said experiment
representative Steve Wall. The craft is 155 million miles from Earth
   The three pictures released Wednesday were taken during an Aug.
16 radar test, just hours before contact with the craft was first
lost.
   One picture shows at least two irregularly shaped craters _
called calderas _ similar to those atop Hawaii's Mauna Loa and
Kilauea volcanoes. The largest is 5 miles long and 2.2 miles wide.
   The calderas were apparently created when lava flowed from vents
and caused the volcanoes' summits to collapse, said Steve Saunders,
the Magellan project's chief scientist.
   Another picture shows a basalt lava flow 11 miles wide and at
least 15{ miles long. It has lobed edges, is extremely rough and
probably flowed in a ``thick, pasty'' manner before it solidified,
Saunders said.
   A third new picture shows a valley, about six-tenths of a mile
wide, that formed when a block of land dropped down between two
faults as the area was being stretched apart, Saunders said.
   Similar fault-bounded valleys are found in California, East
Africa and Germany.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus last month after traveling
a looping, 948-million-mile path since its launch from the shuttle
Atlantis in May 1989.
