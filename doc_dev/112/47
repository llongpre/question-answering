   Magellan, the first U.S. planetary
spacecraft launched in 12 years, reaches Venus on Friday, raising
NASA's hopes for a major success after its woes with the Hubble
space telescope and the shuttle fleet.
   ``We're just thrilled to be here and are rarin' to go. We're
just as excited as we can be,'' said John McCarthy, Magellan
program manager for Hughes Aircraft Co. Hughes built the science
instruments on the 21-foot-long spacecraft.
   At noon PDT Thursday, Magellan was only 242,009 miles from
Venus, speeding toward the cloud-shrouded planet at 10,398 mph. It
was 144 million miles from Earth, but had traveled 946.3 million
miles since it was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.
   The $413 million spacecraft, centerpiece of a $744 million
mission, was scheduled to zoom over Venus' north pole and then drop
into orbit after it fires its braking rocket at 9:32 a.m. PDT
Friday. The spacecraft will be behind Venus at the time, so
engineers won't know if all went well until about half an hour
later.
   After a few weeks of tests, Magellan will start using its radar
by Sept. 1 to penetrate the thick Venusian clouds and make pictures
and maps of the planet's surface 10 times more detailed than those
returned by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft, which were
launched in 1983.
   During a news conference Thursday at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, engineers and
scientists expressed confidence that Magellan's rocket will fire
properly and place the vessel in orbit.
   ``Magellan is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' kicking off a decade in which unmanned craft will
study Jupiter, Mars, asteroids, comets and Saturn, said Wesley T.
Huntress Jr., NASA's director of solar system exploration. ``We're
looking forward to the drama.''
   Magellan is the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since
1978, when NASA sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13
probes to Venus.
   If Magellan's rocket fails to ignite, the spacecraft would fly
past Venus uselessly and wouldn't encounter the planet again for
100 years, said Tony Spear, Magellan project manager at the
laboratory.
   NASA has been plagued by trouble lately, including temporary
grounding of the shuttle fleet because of hydrogen fuel leaks and a
defective mirror that largely crippled the $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
Huntress said. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   If Magellan works as planned, it will return more data than all
previous NASA missions combined, said Steve Saunders, NASA's chief
scientist for Magellan.
   Venus is similar to Earth is size, density and position in the
solar system. Magellan will study's the planet's geology and
geography to learn if its geological processes are similar to those
on Earth, which is shaped by volcanoes and large-scale movements of
gargantuan plates of the planet's crust.
   ``Venus really is our sister planet,'' Saunders said. ``We need
to know a lot more about that planet to understand more about our
own.''
   The raw radar echoes collected by Magellan will be returned to
NASA Deep Space Network antennas in California, Spain and
Australia, then converted into pictures at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   NASA expects to release the first pictures next month, unless a
major discovery is made during radar tests this month.
   Magellan is named for Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan,
who circumnavigated the world in the early 1500s.
