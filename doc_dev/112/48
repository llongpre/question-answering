   Magellan, a robot spacecraft armed with a
sophisticated radar, is ready to rendezvous with Venus and begin an
eight-month exploration and mapping of the Earth's nearest
neighbor, NASA officials said Thursday.
   The spacecraft is scheduled to complete its 804-million-mile
voyage to Venus on Aug. 10 when it fires a rocket engine to settle
into an orbit that dips to within 170 miles of the planet's surface.
   Officials said the craft would approach Venus at 24,600 miles
per hour and the rocket firing will slow Magellan to 18,400 miles
per hour, enough to put it into the planet's orbital grasp.
   After a checkout period lasting until about Sept. 1, Magellan
will use a powerful radar system to penetrate the dense clouds
above Venus and gather images for a detailed map of the baked
surface of the torrid planet.
   Tony Spear, the Magellan project manager, said at a news
conference that the only major problem experienced by the $413
million spacecraft during its long journey has been an electrical
failure in one gyroscope.
   Spear said the spacecraft needs two gyros to control its
position and is equipped with four. Loss of the one gyro, he said,
still leaves a full set of two, plus one spare.
   Magellan was carried into space by the space shuttle Atlantis
and released into Earth orbit May 4, 1989. An upper stage rocket
engine fired to send Magellan streaking out of Earth orbit toward
Venus. During its 15-month voyage, the spacecraft looped the sun,
passed Earth's orbit once and then sped toward its August meeting
with Venus.
   Spear said the plans called for Magellan to spend 243 days, the
length of one Venus day, creating a radar map of 70 percent to 90
percent of the planet's surface. If the craft continues to perform,
Spear said the mission would be extended for additional mapping
cycles until 1995.
   Magellan will circle Venus once every three hours, spending 37
minutes of each orbit bouncing radar signals off the planet's
surface. Each pass will image a swath 10,000 miles long and about
16 miles wide. The data is stored in on-board recorders.
   When the spacecraft swings toward the high part of its orbit, it
will spin, aim its antennae toward Earth and spend 115 minutes
transmitting the radar data back to NASA's deep space network.
   Later, computers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory will process
the signals into images that resemble aerial photos. Scientists
expect Magellan to detect surface details as small as 260 yards
across, about 10 times more resolution than any of the 20 or so
spacecraft that have previously explored Venus.
   Venus holds fascination for scientists because it's nearly the
same size and mass as the Earth and the two planets are thought to
have shared a similar planetary formation history.
   But the two planets differ significantly in temperature and
pressure.
   Venus has a surface temperature of about 900 degrees _ about the
temperature of a self-cleaning oven _ and its atmosphere is almost
pure carbon dioxide. Venus has no liquid water and the atmospheric
pressure is more than 90 times that of Earth.
   Though Venus is 23 million miles closer to the sun than Earth,
it is covered by acid clouds so dense that its surface is in
perpetual twilight.
   Because of the clouds, only a radar such as that carried by
Magellan, can gather the images needed to map the Venusian surface.
