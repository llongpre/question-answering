   ``Hiccups'' keep plaguing a computer
aboard the Magellan spacecraft, which nevertheless has completed
more than 30 consecutive orbits making radar pictures of
cloud-covered Venus, NASA says.
   The pesky malfunctions are in the backup computer that helps
point the orbiter.
   The same computer - one of four aboard Magellan - played a major
role when engineers lost contact with the spacecraft Aug. 16 and
again on Aug. 21, although the precise cause of those incidents
remains unknown.
   Despite the glitches, the spacecraft on Wednesday morning
completed its 30th consecutive orbit mapping the cracked, volcanic
landscape of Venus. Magellan, which arrived at Venus on Aug. 10, is
making almost eight orbits daily. It began its mapping mission on
Saturday.
   ``Since Venus is almost the same size as Earth, the 30-orbit
image patch ... would drape an area on Earth extending from Los
Angeles to Albuquerque and from the North Pole to nearly the South
Pole,'' NASA said in a statement.
   Pictures released in past weeks have shown long ridges and
valleys, networks of faults, large flows of solidified lava and
volcanic craters.
   The most recent glitch happened Monday, when the backup to
Magellan's main computer got a set of false alerts from the backup
pointing computer. The spacecraft wasn't operating on either backup
computer, so mapping continued.
   Other glitches happened just after Magellan reached Venus, then
again on Sept. 4.
   Engineers nicknamed the malfunctions ``hiccups,'' said Steve
Wall, Magellan experiment representative at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Magellan traveled a looping, 948-million-mile path to Venus
after being launched from the shuttle Atlantis in May 1989.
Magellan and Venus are now almost 156 million miles from Earth.
