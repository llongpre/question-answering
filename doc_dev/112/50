   Magellan is the latest of many
spacecraft to visit Venus. NASA and the National Space Society list
these earlier missions, most of their launch and arrival dates, and
tasks.
   The Mariners and Pioneers were U.S. spacecraft; the Veneras and
Vegas were Soviet.
   Mariner 2, launched Aug. 27, 1962, flew within 21,594 miles of
Venus on Dec. 14, 1962, found the planet lacked a magnetic field
and had 900-degree Fahrenheit surface temperatures.
   Venera 4, June 12, 1967, entered Venusian atmosphere Oct. 18,
1967, returning information for 93 minutes.
   Mariner 5, June 14, 1967, flew within 2,500 miles of Venus on
Oct. 19, 1967, measuring surface temperatures and atmospheric
makeup.
   Venera 5, Jan. 5, 1969, parachuted into Venusian atmosphere on
May 16, 1969, confirming it is mostly carbon dioxide and lacks
water vapor.
   Venera 6, Jan. 10, 1969, parachuted into Venusian atmosphere May
17, 1969, similar to Venera 5.
   Venera 7, Aug. 17, 1970, used parachute to make first soft
landing on Venus on Dec. 15, 1970, then transmitted data for 23
minutes.
   Venera 8, March 27, 1972, orbiter-lander, landed on sunlit side
of Venus on July 22, 1972, measuring surface temperature and
pressure.
   Mariner 10, Nov. 3, 1973, flew past Venus on Feb. 5, 1974, en
route to Mercury. Made visible and ultraviolet light images to
track circulation patterns in Venusian atmosphere.
   Venera 9, June 8, 1975, orbiter-lander, with lander providing
first glimpse of Venusian surface in a panoramic picture of
landscape near the touchdown site.
   Venera 10, June 14, 1975, orbiter-lander, sent panoramic view of
landing area and returned information about surface conditions for
65 minutes.
   Pioneer 12, also known as Pioneer Venus Orbiter, May 20, 1978,
started orbiting Venus on Dec. 4, 1978, first spacecraft to carry
radar to Venus, mapped 92 percent of the surface. Discovered Venus
has large rift valleys and 7-mile-high Mount Maxwell, a mile taller
than Earth's Mount Everest.
   Pioneer 13, Aug. 8, 1978, sent four probes into Venusian clouds
on Dec. 9, 1978, obtaining information on wind patterns,
temperatures and pressures.
   Venera 11, Sept. 9, 1978, flyby and lander, touched down on Dec.
5, 1978, detected electric discharges and noises in Venus'
atmosphere.
   Venera 12, Sept. 14, 1978, flyby and lander. Imaging system
failed to return photos after Dec. 21, 1978 landing.
   Venera 13, Oct. 31, 1981, orbiter-lander, relayed first color
images of Venus' surface after landing on March 3, 1982.
   Venera 14, Nov. 4, 1981, orbiter-lander, drilled soil samples,
returned color pictures and conducted a seismic experiment.
   Venera 15, June 2, 1983, and Venera 16, June 7, 1983, orbiters
only, used radar to map the northern 25 percent of Venus with
ability to picture features larger than about 1 mile. Pictures
revealed numerous volcanoes, meteorite impact craters and complex
deformation of Venus' crust.
   Vega 1, Dec. 15, 1984, and Vega 2, Dec. 21, 1984, missions to
Comet Halley and Venus. Probes decscended into Venusian atmosphere.
