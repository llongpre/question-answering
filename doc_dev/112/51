   The shuttle Atlantis is set to soar
into space Friday to rekindle an American planetary exploration
program that has languished for a decade because of budget cuts and
the Challenger accident.
   The cargo is the Magellan spacecraft which has a radar system
powerful enough to pierce the dense sulfuric acid clouds of Venus
and map its surface. The mission costs $550 million and the radar
images could reveal much about the history of Venus and the
evolution of our own Earth.
   Liftoff is scheduled for 2:24 p.m. Friday, and six hours later,
Atlantis' five astronauts are to release Magellan on the start of a
466-day outward journey to the mysterious planet.
   No American planetary spacecraft has been launched since the
Pioneer-Venus probe in 1978, and Magellan will be the first
planet-bound vehicle to be dispatched from the space shuttle.
   When the 7,000-pound payload reaches Venus in August 1990, it is
to fire into orbit and start its 243-day mapping assignment.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   He said the images could help scientists understand how Venus
was formed and might provide an answer to the puzzling question of
how Earth and Venus, evolved so differently even though at the
beginning of the solar system they were almost identical. At the
Venusian surface, the temperature is 900 degrees Fahrenheit and the
atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than that on Earth.
   Saunders said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about
the extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether
Venus once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal
plates similar to those on Earth.
   The radar is designed to produce images showing features as
small as 150 yards across. In comparison, the 1978 Pioneer-Venus
probe could not distinguish features smaller than 60 miles across.
   Magellan is the first of two planetary craft scheduled for
launching from Atlantis this year. The Galileo probe to Jupiter is
to set forth in October.
   The two spacecraft have been in development for more than a
decade. They initially were delayed by budget cuts resulting from a
slowdown in the space program after the completion of the Apollo
man-to-the-moon program.
   They finally were assigned to shuttle missions set for liftoff
in 1986. But those flights were derailed after Challenger exploded
in January 1986, grounding the shuttle fleet for nearly three years.
   ``It's been a long time coming,'' Saunders said.
   The first manmade spacecraft to probe another planet was
Russia's Venera 1, which scouted Venus in 1961. In the years that
followed, a parade of these vehicles, each more sophisticated than
the last, pushed deep into the solar system to take the pulse of
our planetary neighbors.
   The United States has successfully sent five probes to Venus,
six to Mars, four to Jupiter, three to Saturn, and one each to
Mercury and Uranus. And in August, the long-traveling Voyager 2 is
to take the first closeup look at Neptune.
   The Soviet Union has sent 19 successful spacecraft to Venus and
nine to Mars. Its most recent and most ambitious probes both failed
_ Phobos 1 last September while en route to Mars and Phobos 2 as it
was starting its exploration from Martian orbit last month.
   Soviet engineers have not perfected the long-term
nuclear-powered batteries needed to travel to the outer planets.
The Soviet craft employ solar panels which draw electrical power
from the sun. But at distant Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune and Uranus,
these panels would be too far from the sun to be effective.
   At their destinations, some of these robot marvels skim close,
snapping pictures and gathering a few days of data before soaring
on to another planet or into interstellar space; some orbit their
targets to examine them at length, and some descend to the surface.
   What they collect is flashed as binary bits to Earth-bound
computers, which translate the unknown into recognizable places
filled with surprises and secrets. Vague speculations of the past
have been replaced by solid scientific findings.
   Humans have caught their first views and hints of the great
storm systems and rings of Jupiter; the active volcanoes on its
salt-covered moon, Io; the parched and cratered wasteland of
Mercury; ancient river bottoms, raging winds and an inactive
volcanoe almost 80,000 feet high on Mars; sulfuric acid clouds,
lightning and the hellish temperatures on Venus; the thousand rings
and tantalizing moons of Saturn; a scalding 6,000-mile deep ocean
beneath the cloudtops of Uranus.
   From these flights, NASA is assembling a vast mosaic about the
solar system and its intricate workings. A basic goal is to learn
more about planet Earth, fitting it into the cosmic puzzle that is
the origin, the evolution and the structure of the universe.
   Some astronomers believe, for example, that Mars may today
represent an earlier evolutionary state of Earth when its
atmosphere was being formed, and that Venus may represent what
might happen to Earth if its surface temperature were to rise
significantly.
