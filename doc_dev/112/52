   The Venus-orbiting Magellan spacecraft,
back in radio contact with Earth after twice cutting off
communication, sent flight data home today to help engineers figure
out what went wrong.
   ``It's sitting there doing nothing but talking to us,'' said
Steve Wall, a Magellan scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. ``We're looking for a root cause of the failures.''
   NASA engineers restored steady radio contact with Magellan on
Wednesday afternoon after a hair-raising 21{-hour struggle to
prevent the craft from becoming lost in space some 149 million
miles from Earth.
   ``This is a nervous Nellie, I'll tell you,'' lab spokesman Alan
Wood said.
   The successful conclusion of Magellan's latest crisis averted,
at least temporarily, another big setback for NASA. The agency
temporarily grounded its shuttle fleet this summer because of fuel
leaks, and also discovered the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope
had a flawed mirror that produced blurry images.
   Wall said he suspected there might be separate causes for
Magellan's latest radio cutoff, which started Tuesday night, and
for the first communications breakdown, which lasted 22 hours
beginning Aug. 16.
   But he said, ``We do not believe anything like a massive failure
occurred.''
   Wall said that evidence suggests a cosmic ray or high-energy
particle from the sun disrupted Magellan's electronics to cause
last week's problem, while the latest failure raises suspicion of
flaws in the ship's hardware or computer programs.
   Ed Sherry, a Magellan official, said programs in the backup
computer appeared to be ``corrupted'' and engineers will rewrite
them to try to solve at least part of the problem.
   Magellan's emergency systems also appeared to have
malfunctioned, complicating NASA's efforts to make Magellan call
home, so engineers sent computer commands to the spacecraft to
disable some of the systems.
   Just as they did last weekend, engineers also ordered Magellan
to unload its computer memory banks Wednesday night. The process
continued today.
   ``The patient is resting comfortably and is strong and healthy,
but needs an operation _ and we don't know which operation right
now,'' said Tommy Thompson, Magellan science manager.
   Wall said the start of Magellan's $744 million mission to make
the most detailed pictures and maps yet of Venus' misshapen
landscape will probably be postponed until the problem is solved.
Scientists had hoped to use Magellan's radar to peer through the
planet's thick clouds during the first week in September.
   The spacecraft was launched from the shuttle Atlantis 15 months
ago, then looped around the sun 1{ times, traveling 948 million
miles before it slid into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10.
   Long considered Earth's twin gone bad, Venus is similar to Earth
in size, mass and distance from the sun, but it was turned into a
hellish inferno with 900-degree surface temperatures because of an
out-of-control ``greenhouse effect.''
   Scientists want to know if the same geological forces that
shaped Earth also sculpted Venus.
   Magellan's first test pictures of Venus were released hours
before Tuesday's trouble. They show a landscape broken by quake
faults, giant solidified lava flows, volcanic cinder cones,
collapsed craters and long ridges and valleys.
