   Magellan, the first U.S. planetary
spacecraft launched since 1978, fired its braking rocket and
dropped into orbit around Venus today on a mission to make the best
pictures yet of the planet's cloud-covered terrain.
   ``The system worked as planned. A lot of hard work was
rewarded,'' said George Alexander, chief spokesman for NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I'm tremendously gratified we were able to do something for
NASA and the public that shows this is a capable agency'' following
troubles with the shuttle fleet and the Hubble Space Telescope, he
said. ``This breaks the string of bad luck.''
   Magellan dived over Venus' north pole, then ignited the
forward-facing rocket at 9:32 a.m., slowing from about 24,600 mph
to roughly 18,500 mph.
   That allowed Magellan to be captured by Venus' gravity and start
orbiting the second planet from the sun, said mission commentator
Steve Wall.
   The rocket ignition happened when the spacecraft was behind
Venus, out of radio contact with engineers on Earth. Magellan
emerged at 9:53 a.m., but preliminary confirmation that all went
well came 13 minutes later because of the time Magellan's radio
signal takes to reach Earth.
   ``We are now in orbit!'' said David Okerson, a Magellan project
engineer.
   In the Magellan project office, ``there was cheering and
applause and whistling and hooting'' by scientists and engineers,
said secretary Sharon Kyle.
   Magellan encountered Venus 144 million miles from Earth after
circling the sun 1{ times during a roundabout, 948-million-mile
journey.
   The $413 million Magellan, the heart of a $744 million mission,
was designed to use radar to penetrate thick Venusian clouds,
allowing the spacecraft to make maps and pictures of the planet's
deformed, volcanic landscape with unprecedented detail. Mapping is
slated to start by Sept. 1.
   NASA plans to release the first pictures in September, but may
do so this month if images made during tests produce any
interesting discoveries.
   Magellan has raised NASA's hopes after its recent woes,
including the temporary grounding of the shuttle fleet because of
hydrogen leaks and a defective mirror that crippled the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
Wesley T. Huntress Jr., NASA director of solar system exploration,
said Thursday. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   The 21-foot Magellan, deployed from the shuttle Atlantis in May
1989, was the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since 1978,
when NASA sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13 probes to
Venus.
   ``Magellan is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' Huntress said. ``We're looking forward to the
drama.''
   The Voyager probes explored Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
between 1979 and last year, but they were launched in 1977.
Galileo, launched in October, is headed toward a 1995 rendezvous
with Jupiter.
   During the coming decade or so, NASA also plans to send
spacecraft to explore Mars, the moon, Saturn, comets and the sun's
polar regions.
   NASA has said Magellan would return more data than all previous
NASA missions combined.
   Venus is similar to Earth in size, density and position in the
solar system, although a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, about as hot as a
self-cleaning oven.
   NASA wants to learn if the planet's geological processes are
similar to Earth's. Venus has tens of thousands of volcanoes, but
no one knows if any are active.
   Magellan was named for the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand
Magellan, who sailed around the world in the early 1500s.
   The spacecraft was built by Martin Marietta Corp. and its radar
was built by Hughes Aircraft Co.
