   Magellan bounced radar waves off Venus
on Thursday in the first test of the spacecraft's ability to yield
the best pictures ever made of the planet's cloud-covered landscape.
   ``Magellan is beaming a signal to the surface of Venus for the
first time,'' said Ed Sherry, Magellan science operations manager
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``Everything is acting just as
expected.''
   During the test, scheduled to end Friday, Magellan was
programmed to bounce radar waves off Venus as it orbited the planet
four times.
   During each orbit, the returning radar echoes were expected to
produce data that computers on Earth will process into seven to 10
postage stamp-sized pictures of Venus' landscape. Each image is
supposed to cover a 15-by-15-mile area.
   Clouds prevent optical cameras from viewing the Venusian
surface, so Magellan was designed to use radar waves to make
pictures and maps.
   Sherry said engineers won't know until sometime Friday if the
spacecraft successfully collected the radar echoes. The data won't
be processed into pictures until sometime this weekend, he added.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration doesn't plan
to release the test pictures unless they reveal some interesting
discovery. Sherry said pictures will be released next month after
Magellan formally starts making images and maps of Venus on Aug. 29.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after a
948-million-mile trip from Earth. The spacecraft was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989. The mission costs $744
million, including $413 million for the spacecraft.
   Sherry said the test that started at 3:31 p.m. PDT Thursday was
designed to assure that Magellan's radar can make pictures of Venus
and to adjust the radar waves so the pictures are focused.
   The test began when the spaceship automatically followed
computer commands and turned its main antenna toward Venus, the
second planet from the sun.
   Six minutes later, Magellan's radar was operating, bouncing
radar waves off the planet's surface as the spacecraft swooped
southward from Venus' north pole. As planned, the radar went off
automatically at 4:13 p.m. PDT. After turning its antenna toward
Earth, Magellan then started beaming the information back to Earth,
Sherry said.
   The radar information was being received at NASA Deep Space
Network stations at Goldstone, Calif., and in Australia and Spain,
he said.
   The first batch of information was being sent from Goldstone to
Jet Propulsion Laboratory both by phone lines and, in more complete
form, by truck.
   The truck driver ``will be greeted with a case of beer,'' Sherry
said.
