<LEADPARA>  The Magellan spacecraft is past the halfway point of its mission to map
cloud-covered Venus and should meet its goal of making pictures of at least 70
percent of the planet, NASA said Wednesday.;    So far, the spacecraft has
flown over 50.9 percent of the Venusian surface and successfully made pictures
of 41.4 percent of the terrain, said Steve Wall, experiment representative at
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     If mapping continues at the same rate, Magellan should collect radar
pictures of more than 80 percent of Venus by the time its primary mission ends
May 15, he said.;    "We're filled with joy and anticipation," said Richard
Goldstein, a laboratory researcher.;    Magellan orbits Venus' poles as the
planet slowly rotates on its axis. A single Venusian day equals 243 Earth
days.;    The spacecraft's primary mission is to make pictures of 70 percent
to 90 percent of the planet, using radar to peer through thick clouds.;   
NASA plans to have Magellan continue making pictures in an "extended mission"
during subsequent 243-day cycles.;    The 50.9 percent of Venus over which
Magellan has flown equals an area that on Earth would stretch from Los Angeles
east to Bombay, India, Wall said during a NASA closed-circuit television
briefing.;    Not all of that area was mapped because of technical problems on
Magellan and planetary lineups that prevented the spacecraft from sending some
computerized picture data back to Earth.;    Wednesday, Magellan was mapping
Aphrodite Terra, a continent-like highland the size of Africa that straddles
Venus' equator.;    Goldstein and Annette deCharon, a Magellan scientist from
Brown University, displayed pictures made by Magellan when it flew above Alpha
Regio, an 800-mile-wide highland that rises one-half mile to 1.9 miles above
surrounding southern hemisphere lowlands.;    "This is some of the most
complicated terrain we've seen," deCharon said, pointing to an intricate
network of 650-foot-tall mountain ridges, earthquake faults and fault-bounded
valleys similar to California's Owens Valley. Some of the valleys are filled
with solidified lava flows.;    Alpha Regio's terrain is known as tessera,
after the Greek word for tile, because of its complex cracked appearance.;   
"This is an area that looks really tortured," Wall said.  </TEXT>
