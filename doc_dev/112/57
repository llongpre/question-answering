   The Magellan spacecraft completed its
30th consecutive orbit mapping the cracked, volcanic landscape of
Venus on Wednesday, despite some ``hiccups'' from one of its
computers, NASA said.
   ``Since Venus is almost the same size as Earth, the 30-orbit
image patch ... would drape an area on Earth extending from Los
Angeles to Albuquerque and from the North Pole to nearly the South
Pole,'' said a statement by the agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The orbiter resumed using its radar to make pictures of the
cloud-covered planet on Saturday, a month after it yielded its
first images during an Aug. 16 radar test. Engineers temporarily
lost radio contact the night of that test, then again on Aug. 21.
   They still haven't identified the cause of the problem, and the
spacecraft continues to have occasional malfunctions, nicknamed
``hiccups'' by the engineers, said Steve Wall, Magellan experiment
representative.
   ``It's a sign there's still something awry. ... But we've made
it (Magellan) so it can still map'' and recover from any future
communications blackout, he added.
   Magellan and Venus were 155.8 million miles from Earth on
Wednesday. Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May
4, 1989.
   Before mapping resumed Saturday, Magellan played back a tape
recording of some of the picture data collected Aug. 16. Steve
Saunders, the project's chief scientist, displayed a few of thoe
pictures Wednesday during a NASA briefing, but prints weren't
released publicly.
   The pictures show the same kind of features seen in other
images: ridges, valleys, extensive networks of intersecting seismic
faults, large solidified flows of lava, a volcanic dome and
calderas, the craters left by the collapse of large volcanos.
   The spacecraft's most recent computer glitch happened Monday
night, when the backup to Magellan's main computer got a set of
false alerts from the backup computer that helps point Magellan.
The spacecraft wasn't operating on either backup computer, so
mapping continued.
   Wall said there seems to be a common factor linking that and
other glitches, including both communications failures and lesser
malfunctions on Aug. 10 and Sept. 4 - they all involved the backup
pointing computer.
