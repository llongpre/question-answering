Carnivores.;   The 1-year-old greenhouse in Forestville sells only
insect-eating flora, and its inhabitants wreak death in ways that would shock
even Bret Easton Ellis.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  Cover Story  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Under a blazing Sonoma County sun, 340 varieties spend their days
paralyzing, strangling, drowning and dissolving hapless bugs.;   The founder,
Peter D'Amato, has not escaped from these hearty eaters since 1965. He was 10
when he found several specimens growing in a bog near his home in southern New
Jersey.;   "There's something hypnotic about them," he said. "They're always
involved in some kind of drama. I have to keep reminding myself that they
can't think.";   He is devoted not only to growing and selling carnivorous
plants -- many of which grow easily in South Bay climates -- but also to
improving their image, which has been sullied in recent years by movies such
as "Little Shop of Horrors.";   None of his wares, however, bring to mind the
grotesque potted man-eater in that film. Rather, they appear deceptively
innocent.;   The bladderworts look fragile on the surface, with dainty
blossoms nodding on wire-thin stalks. But underground, fast-moving suction
cups are lapping up nematodes.;   The sundews seem equally innocuous. They
resemble scrawny, long-armed cactuses misted with glistening dew -- a "dew" so
gluey that insects rarely break away from its grasp.;   Once the dew secures a
victim, the plant's arm slowly curls around the creature and consumes it with
a secretion of digestive juice.;   Only the nepenthes (nuh-PEN-theeze), loopy
tropical vines strung with potato-size pods full of liquid enzymes -- look
capable of violence.;   Purple veins streak their pods, and rows of horizontal
thorns run up the corners of the pods, serving as tiny ladders that lead bugs
and sometimes mice to doom.;   Despite these aggressive meal-acquisition
tools, no one was sure plants could eat insects until the 1860s, when Charles
Darwin began experimenting with botanical carnivores.;   Sundews, he wrote at
the time, interested him more "than the origin of all the species in the
world." He spent years figuring out what and how they consumed.;   "He'd feed
them hard-boiled egg, which they will eat," D'Amato said. "They'll even eat
chocolate and cheese, which gives them indigestion.";   Thanks to Darwin's
discoveries -- and thanks to improved glassmaking and heating technology,
which made greenhouses possible -- Victorians took a fancy to carnivores in
general and nepenthes in particular.;   The voracious vines gorged on indoor
pests until fuel shortages in the United States and Europe during World War I
killed all but a few collections.;   Interest in them flagged until the 1970s,
when back-to-nature enthusiasts flirted with almost every form of interior
greenery. But carnivores did not enjoy a long return to the limelight, mainly
because they often disappointed their inexperienced owners by dying.;   "It's
tricky to get the conditions right: the soil, the water, the humidity, the
light," said Geoff Wong, a long-time collector of carnivorous plants and a
California Carnivores customer. His most frustrating possession is a nepenthes
that adapted to life 9,000 feet up in Borneo.;   "It's 10 years old and one
inch wide, and in its natural state, it would be 10 feet high," said Wong, who
is a research chemist in Palo Alto. Although the plant is only a few inches
high, "people tell me I should be happy it isn't dead." D'Amato owns another
aged example of the same plant, also an inch wide and a few inches high.;  
"It's a matter of finding out what's important to them," said Bill Baumgartl,
a physician in San Francisco who owns 30 carnivorous plants and frequents
California Carnivores. "They're very sensitive to soil pH, and you have to
water them with distilled water and you have to fertilize very carefully.";  
But Marilee Maertz, the greenhouse's general manager, who has accidentally
killed countless other houseplants and has mistaken the word "Dieffenbachia"
for a disease, finds carnivores easy to please. "Only once in a while do we
lose somebody," she said.;   She is a former ship inspector; D'Amato is a
former design engineer for Levi Strauss, and they have been friends since
1973.;   In 1989, they displayed D'Amato's private collection at a garden show
in San Francisco, just for fun, and were swamped by purchase offers.;   To
sate the public's appetite, they set up a shop of carnivores. "We felt
terrible saying, 'Yeah, these are great, but you can't have any,' " she said.;
  According to the International Carnivorous Plant Society, California
Carnivores is the newest and one of the largest of the dozen all-carnivorous
retail nurseries in the country.;   Their 2,000-square-foot greenhouse stands
on the grounds of a winery; it once sheltered weeds used in allergy research.
It looks more like a botanical museum than a store: A half-dozen crowded
planters with long textual panels line one aisle, depicting the ways
carnivores can congregate in their natural settings.;   Several sundews spill
out of a green pottery horn of plenty. A baby sundew in the saddle of a pink
china horse will someday make its host resemble Pegasus.;   "Bizarre pots for
bizarre plants," said D'Amato, who skips off in midsentence to mist a
nepenthes.;   School groups often tour the shop, as do the curious. Despite
the long hours of describing the wonders of carnivores and despite frequent
pleas to set off a Venus flytrap (requests that are usually ignored, since
flytraps hate to be teased), the staff members never tire of their subject.;  
"To this day," D'Amato said, "the simplest sundew still puts me in a state of
amazement."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; California Carnivores is located at Mark
West Vineyards, 7000 Trenton-Healsburg Road, Forestville, 95436; (707)
838-1630. The nursery is open daily March through November, but they recommend
calling ahead for a visit during the winter months.  </TEXT>
