   The astronauts who will fly the
first space shuttle planetary mission said Monday the Magellan
probe they are to launch toward Venus next month could teach us
about more than that hot planet.
   ``Not only will we learn much about Venus but we'll learn more
about Earth'' and why these neighboring planets evolved so
differently, said astronaut Norm Thagard.
   Astronaut Ronald Grabe, who will pilot the shuttle Atlantis,
noted that Magellan will be the first American planetary launch in
12 years and the first from the shuttle.
   ``The planetary program has been dormant for some time,'' he
said. ``So Magellan will be a very fullfilling flight for us. Not
only when we launch it, but 15 months later when it orbits Venus.''
   Astronaut David Walker, who will command the flight, said the
Magellan flight is a ``logical marriage between the manned and
unmanned space programs.''
   Walker and his four Atlantis crew members held a news conference
to discuss the four-day flight, scheduled for launch from Cape
Canaveral, Fla., on April 28.
   Six hours after Atlantis lifts off, astronauts Thagard and Mark
Lee are to release the Magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay. An
hour later, a payload rocket motor is to ignite to start the
8,000-pound probe on a 466-day voyage to Venus.
   Magellan is to reach Venus on Aug. 10, 1990, swooping into orbit
to begin 243 days of mapping the entire surface of the planet with
high-resolution radar.
   ``Venus is our closest neighbor in terms of space, mass and
size,'' Thagard said. ``Planetary science is very important to
learning how the Earth evolved and what is going on here. Venus is
another data point. We worry about the greenhouse effect here on
Earth. Magellan could tell us if there are any parallels between
Earth and Venus.''
   Although Earth and Venus were almost identical at the beginning
of the solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago, they evolved very
differently. Today, Venus has a surface temperature of 900 degrees
and is shrouded in a cloudy atmosphere.
   Mary Cleave, a mission specialist on next month's mission, said
Magellan's radar images could show whether Venus has shifting
crustal plates similar to those that sometimes cause earthquakes.
   ``Being a civil engineer and interested in the design of
buildings that could withstand earthquakes, I would like to know
more about plate tectonics,'' she said. ``Because there is no water
on Venus, the radar can look at the entire planet and this might
help us understand plate tectonics on Earth.''
   Magellan also could answer questions about the extent of
volcanic activity on Venus and whether the planet ever had oceans.
