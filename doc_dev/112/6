   The Magellan spacecraft has found sand
dunes on Venus despite low wind and little loose sediment on the
planet.
   ``They look a lot like sand dunes on Earth,'' said Ray Arvidson,
a geologist from Washington University in St. Louis and a Magellan
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``This is a fairly rare occurrence on Venus,'' he said
Wednesday. ``This area just had a beautiful supply of sediment to
be reworked into dunes.''
   Magellan's pictures revealed the dune field in an area of Los
Angeles-sized meteorite craters. The field is 30 to 40 miles long,
and each dune is hundreds of yards wide, Arvidson said. Magellan
hasn't determined their height.
   Magellan's images have shown Venus has very little loose
sediment. That's because the planet lacks water to erode rock.
   Surface winds on Venus measure only a few miles per hour, but
the atmosphere is so dense that even such light winds can lift
sediment, he said. Atmospheric pressure on Venus' surface is 90
times the pressure at sea level on Earth.
   Arvidson said the sediment that was blown around to form the
dunes may have stemmed from a meteorite impact that shattered or
melted rock. Another possibility is that the meteorite was a
water-rich comet, he added.
   Magellan bounces radar off Venus to make pictures and maps of
the planet, which can't be photographed with optical cameras
because of its thick cloud cover.
   The pictures have shown numerous volcanoes, volcanic collapse
craters, long rivers of solidified lava, extensive faults, deep
valleys and towering ridges.
   Magellan began orbiting Venus on Aug. 10 after a roundabout trip
from Earth of 948 million miles. The spacecraft was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis in May 1989. Magellan and Venus were 158.6
million miles from Earth on Wednesday.
