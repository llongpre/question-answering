   One of the Magellan spacecraft's backup
computers rejected commands when a memory chip failed, but the
glitch won't hurt the $744 million exploration of Venus, engineers
say.
   ``It's like a stuck traffic light. It's not allowing the proper
flow of commands,'' said Tommy Thompson, Magellan science manager
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``The spacecraft is healthy except for this little problem, and
we can work around it,'' he added. ``Every indication is this will
have no effect on our operations.''
   Launched from the shuttle Atlantis in May 1989, Magellan is on a
mission to use radar to penetrate Venus' thick clouds and make the
best pictures and maps yet of the planet's rugged landscape.
   The spacecraft went into orbit around Venus on Friday after a
roundabout, 948-million-mile voyage to the second planet from the
sun.
   Lab spokesman Jim Doyle said the problem with the memory chip
should be corrected within a few days by bypassing the failed part.
   Computer commands are expected to turn on the spacecraft's radar
on Wednesday, then order Magellan to bounce radar off Venus in a
test on Thursday.
   That test and others the following week may produce
postage-stamp images of 15-by-15-mile squares of Venus' surface.
Those pictures will be released only if they reveal any interesting
discoveries, project manager Tony Spear said.
   Otherwise, NASA plans to issue Magellan's first official
pictures of Venus in September.
   Mapping of the planet could begin on Aug. 29, Thompson said.
   The chip failure happened in an onboard backup computer that can
accept commands from the spacecraft's main computers, then execute
those commands so the craft points properly toward Venus.
   Thompson said the faulty chip made the computer reject some
commands. But since it is a backup computer, those commands were
accepted and carried out by another computer, he added.
   Magellan orbits Venus once every 3 hours, 15{ minutes, Thompson
said. Its orbit ranges from 183 miles to 5,253 miles above Venus.
