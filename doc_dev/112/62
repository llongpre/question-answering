   Engineers will rewrite the Magellan
space probe's computer programs to reduce the risk of again losing
contact with the Venus orbiter, an official says.
   Scientists have abandoned efforts to determine why they lost
contact with the spacecraft twice in August, said Tony Spear,
Magellan project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``We're reaching the point of diminishing returns in trying to
determine the root cause, so we are phasing that out. We're
focusing on fixes now,'' Spear said.
   Magellan on Wednesday continued using its radar to map and make
pictures of Venus, marking its 396th orbit since reaching the
planet Aug. 10.
   The spacecraft has now collected more ``bits'' of computerized
data than any other single planetary exploration spacecraft, said
Steve Wall, Magellan experiment representative. NASA has said that
by the end of Magellan's mission, it will have gathered more
information than all other spacecraft combined.
   The spacecraft made some test pictures of Venus Aug. 16, but
lost radio contact with Earth that night and again Aug. 21. That
delayed the start of full-scale mapping until Sept. 15.
   Engineers suspect the malfunctions stem from possible damage
that happened when the spacecraft jettisoned its braking rocket
several hours after it started orbiting Venus, Spear said.
   The damage might be a broken wire or circuit, Wall said. If
there was such damage, it apparently caused or aggravated
``noise,'' or static, that interferes with Magellan's computers,
Spear said.
   Rewriting the compute programs will help Magellan automatically
detect future glitches, reduce the chance of a complete loss of
radio contact, and allow the most trouble-prone of the four
computers to operate while bypassing ``corrupted'' portions of its
memory, Spear said.
   That computer - a backup computer that helps aim the spacecraft
- hasn't been used since the communications blackouts. The new
software will allow it to be used in case the primary directional
computer ever fails.
   The new computer programming will be radioed to Magellan to
replace existing software only as problems develop, and ``we will
test the living daylights out of it on the ground,'' Spear said.
   He said some of the new programs will be installed by the end of
this year, the rest by the end of 1991.
   Magellan's pictures of Venus have shown extensive faulting and
fracturing of the planet's surface, giant meteorite impact craters
and a wide variety of volcanoes.
   Laboratory spokesman Jim Doyle said 98.9 percent of all radar
mapping data collected by Magellan since Sept. 15 was transmitted
to Earth successfully. That means about four hours of information
were lost or damaged in transit.
   Spear said the most recent incident happened Tuesday when
high-energy particles in space slightly degraded one orbit's worth
of picture data. Computer processing should restore the quality of
those images, he said.
