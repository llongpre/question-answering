   NASA has selected April 28 as date
for launching Atlantis on the first space shuttle planetary mission
with the Magellan-Venus probe.
   The decision was announced Friday following a comprehensive
two-day review of all aspects of the flight by more than 200
shuttle managers and engineers. Liftoff of the shuttle Atlantis was
set for 2:24 p.m. EDT.
   ``While we have much work to do, and little contingency time, we
have established an April 28 launch date,'' NASA shuttle Director
Richard Truly said.
   That had been the unofficial launch target for several weeks.
   During their four-day flight, Atlantis' five astronauts are to
release the $378 million Magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay,
starting it on a 466-day journey to Venus.
   The spacecraft is to orbit the cloud-covered planet in August
1990 and map its surface over the next 243 days with a
high-resolution radar system.
   Magellan is the first new American planetary spacecraft since
Pioneer 13 was launched in 1978, also to Venus. It also is the
first planetary payload to be carried by a space shuttle.
   ``The goal of Magellan is to obtain radar images of at least 70
percent of the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   The radar is intended to produce images showing features as
small as 150 feet across. In comparison, Pioneer 13 could not
distinguish features any smaller than 60 miles across.
   Saunders said the images would help scientists understand how
Venus was formed and might provide answers to the puzzling question
of how Earth and Venus, with a surface temperature of 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, evolved so differently even though at the beginning of
the solar system 4.8 billion years ago they were almost identical.
   He said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about the
extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether Venus
once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal plates
similiar to those on Earth.
   Commanding the astronaut crew is veteran shuttle pilot David
Walker. The others are pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialists Mary
Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard.
