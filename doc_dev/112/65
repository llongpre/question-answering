   Magellan's mapping of Venus will resume
next week after engineers repair a computer programming glitch that
makes the spacecraft's solar power panels wobble, NASA says.
   Magellan on Friday suspended its $744 million effort to make
pictures and maps because of the solar panel problem and because
its communications with Earth are being hindered by the sun, which
is lined up between Venus and Earth.
   NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory expects to fix the computer
software so Magellan can resume taking radar pictures by Nov. 7 or
8, Magellan experiment representative Steve Wall said Wednesday.
   The twin solar panels are essential for recharging Magellan's
batteries, but the wobbling hasn't hurt their ability to gather
solar energy.
   The craft was launched from a space shuttle in May 1989 and
arrived at Venus on Aug. 10. It has made pictures of volcanoes,
huge solidified lava flows, faults, craters and 600-mile-wide,
mile-high bulges on Venus.
