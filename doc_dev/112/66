   The spacecraft Magellan was ordered to
bounce radar off Venus today for the first time to test its
picture-making ability, which won't be harmed by glitches with a
computer and radio transmitter, NASA says.
   The test, scheduled for late afternoon, was expected to produce
a postage stamp-sized picture of a 15-by-15-mile area of Venus'
surface, although the picture won't be processed until the weekend,
Tony Spear, Magellan project manager at the agency's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said Wednesday.
   Spear said earlier the picture wouldn't be released unless it
revealed an interesting discovery.
   Magellan's formal program to make detailed maps and pictures of
Venus starts Aug. 29 or Sept. 1. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration plans to release the first images during September.
   Venus, the second planet from the sun, is covered by thick
clouds, so radar must be used to make images of its surface.
   The radar was turned on for an hour Wednesday, just to show it
was working, for the first time since Magellan went into orbit
around Venus last Friday after a 948-million-mile trip from Earth.
   The radar previously was turned on for tests during May and
December while Magellan cruised toward Venus.
   Spear said Magellan's minor troubles won't harm its $744 million
mission.
   ``Just like everything in life, this spacecraft has little
idiosyncrasies and little warts, and we're experiencing some of
those. They are minor and we can work around them, but they do take
some time,'' he said.
   One minor problem developed Tuesday when the backup to
Magellan's main radio transmitter shut off when it wasn't supposed
to do so.
   ``We just turned it back on again,'' Spear said.
   Similar unwanted shutdowns plagued the main transmitter during
Magellan's journey to Venus, so the backup has been acting as the
spacecraft's main transmitter.
   The other glitch, which NASA revealed Sunday, involves a failed
computer chip that caused commands to be rejected by a backup
computer that helps aim Magellan. Engineers plan to bypass the
faulty chip, as they did after another chip failed last Dec. 31.
   Spear said that problem may take two weeks to two months to fix.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.
