   NASA on Wednesday showed off a
spacecraft resembling a giant insect that will be launched toward
Venus when the space shuttle Atlantis makes its next flight.
   The probe, called Magellan, stood upright in a sterile ``white
room,'' its solar panels spread like the wings of a butterfly, as
reporters and photographers got a closeup look.
   Because of the spacecraft's susceptibility to certain
contaminants, the visitors wore white coveralls and hair covers and
were asked not to use makeup or hairspray during the hours before
the showing.
   Magellan is being groomed to be carried into space by Atlantis on
its fourth flight, scheduled to begin April 28.
   Atlantis landed at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., Tuesday at the
end of its third flight, a secret military mission. It will be
ferried back to Cape Canaveral next week atop a Boeing 747 airliner
to be readied for its next launch.
   Once the shuttle is in orbit, the five-member crew will release
Magellan and a rocket will start it on a 466-day trip to Venus.
   The probe is to settle into an orbit around Venus and obtain the
best images yet of the planet's surface with an advanced radar
system.
   ``The goal is to obtain radar images of at least 70 percent of
the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   He said the images would help scientists understand how Venus was
formed and might provide answers to the puzzling question of how
Earth and Venus evolved so differently even though at the beginning
of the solar system they were almost identical.
   Venus, Earth's closest planetary neighbor, has a surface
temperature of about 900 degrees Fahrenheit, its atmosphere is
almost entirely carbon dioxide and its atmospheric pressure is 90
times that of Earth's. It is 67.2 million miles from the sun,
compared to the Earth's 93 million miles from the sun.
   Magellan will be the first planetary probe launched from a
shuttle as well as the first U.S. planetary mission since two
Pioneer spacecraft were dispatched in 1978 to study Venus'
atmosphere.
