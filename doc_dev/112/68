   Here are some facts, figures and
theories about Venus, the planet visited early today by the
Jupiter-bound Galileo spacecraft:
   DIAMETER: About 7,520 miles, or 95 percent as wide as Earth, and
sixth largest of the solar system's nine known planets.
   MASS: Venus weighs about 82 percent as much as Earth.
   ATMOSPHERE: About 96 percent carbon dioxide and most of the rest
nitrogen, but with thick clouds of sulfuric acid and water vapor.
The atmosphere traps heat in a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' that
scientists believe evaporated liquid water long ago.
   SURFACE CONDITIONS: Temperature about 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
Crushing atmospheric pressure 90 times that on Earth.
   DAY LENGTH: Venus rotates on its axis very slowly, so one day on
Venus equals 243 Earth days. Its rotation is retrograde, so the sun
rises in the west and sets in the east.
   YEAR LENGTH: Venus orbits the sun once every 225 Earth days.
   DISTANCE FROM THE SUN: Venus is the second planet from the sun,
orbiting at a distance of 67.2 million miles. It is closer to Earth
than any other planet. Other than the sun and moon, Venus is the
brightest object in Earth's skies.
   MOONS: None.
   GEOLOGY: Earth-based and spacecraft radar revealed hundreds of
thousands of volcanoes on the Venusian lowlands, although
scientists don't yet know if any are active. Venus also has
meteorite impact craters and continent-like highlands with towering
peaks that dwarf Earth's tallest mountains. Scientists suspect
giant plates of rock may move in Venus' crust in a process vaguely
like continental drift on Earth.
   GRAVITY: About 89 percent as strong as on Earth.
