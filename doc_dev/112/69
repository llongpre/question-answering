geological activity on the planet.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  Scientists have finally found what they have been looking for in the thousands
of images sent back by the Magellan spacecraft over the past year --
convincing evidence that Venus, like Earth, is still geologically alive.;  
The images show that sometime in the last few months, Venus had a massive
landslide that was probably triggered by a "Venus quake." Until the discovery,
made Thursday at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, no one could say
for sure if Venus has dynamic, ongoing processes like those that have built
mountains and filled valleys with debris on Earth.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Magellan, managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, has been sending back sharp radar images
of the surface of Venus for more than a year. But those have been static
images, revealing the ground as it appeared at the moment the spacecraft
passed overhead.;   Earlier this year, Magellan began a second phase of
mapping, passing over the same territory it had covered before and taking new
images to see if anything had changed.;   Thursday, Jeffrey Plaut, a planetary
scientist who finished working on his doctorate just in time to join the
Magellan project, was comparing images taken eight months apart of Venus'
Aphrodite Terra, a high, equatorial plateau. As he studied the two images,
Plaut realized that the one taken last month was quite different from the one
taken in November.;   "Where there once was a plateau, there now is a pile of
rubble," he said Friday.;   Not quite certain what he was seeing, Plaut sensed
that the slope of the plateau had been altered by a landslide that sent
millions of tons of rock crashing down into the valley below.;   "I tried to
remain calm," he said. But Plaut soon found himself "running around screaming
in the office.";   Plaut's two images had been captured as the camera looked
from the left. Not until Friday, when another image of the same area spilled
out of the computer, did he begin to rest easy. The third image was taken from
the right, and it confirmed what he saw in the first two, Plaut said.;   The
landslide, he concluded, was real.;   Friday, Magellan project scientist
Stephen Saunders agreed that Plaut was right.;   The landslide was probably
triggered by a "Venus quake," Saunders said, and that could only occur if
dynamic processes inside the planet are still reshaping the surface.  </TEXT>
