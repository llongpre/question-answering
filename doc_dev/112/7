   Magellan's latest pictures of Venus show
meteorite craters the size of Los Angeles, a river of solidified
lava 200 miles long and a collapsed volcano twice as deep as the
Grand Canyon.
   ``These are extremely jazzy images,'' said Gordon Pettengill, a
Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist who leads the
spacecraft's radar science team.
   NASA displayed the pictures of the cloud-covered planet at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory on Tuesday.
   ``Believe me, it's giving us a revolutionary new view of
Venus,'' said Brown University geologist Jim Head, a Magellan
scientist.
   With Magellan only 10 days into its 243-day mission to map the
planet, Head advised: ``Don't touch your dial. We think we have a
blockbuster fall season.''
   Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief scientist, displayed a
computer-generated videotape of three-dimensional images showing
Venus from the perspective of someone swooping down to and around a
crater on its surface.
   Magellan started its $744 million picture- and map-making
mission Sept. 15, two weeks later than planned because engineers
temporarily lost radio contact with the spacecraft twice in August.
   One picture displayed Tuesday shows two volcanoes, each with a
windblown fan of debris extending about six miles from the
mountain's summit crater. NASA said the fans look like ``fallout
from volcanic explosion plumes.''
   While Magellan hasn't seen a volcano actually erupting, it has
made pictures of so many volcanic features that ``there is an
excellent possibility there is active volcanism somewhere on the
planet,'' Head said.
   Magellan also spotted a caldera, or crater caused by the
collapse of a volcano's summit, almost two miles deep - roughly
twice the depth of the Grand Canyon and deeper than any other
caldera seen in the solar system, scientists said.
   A hardened lava river eight-tenths of a mile wide and about 200
miles long was mapped by Magellan as well.
   NASA also showed a picture of a meteorite impact crater about 28
miles wide. ``Greater Los Angeles would fit approximately in the
floor of this crater,'' Head said.
   Another picture showed three big impact craters, one of them
even larger, with a width of about 30 miles.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis in May
1989 and arrived at Venus after traveling a looping path of 948
million miles.
   Chief engineer John Slonski Jr. said a backup computer that
played a role in the radio blackouts still malfunctions
occasionally, so contact might be lost again.
   The cause of the problems remains unknown. Suspicion focuses on
possible damage to electronic components that happened when
Magellan started orbiting Venus Aug. 10 and on static in the wiring
linking its computers, Slonski said.
