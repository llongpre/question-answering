<LEADPARA>  New radar images from the Magellan spacecraft reveal that the planet Venus has
apparently been completely resurfaced by volcanic eruptions and its
second-highest mountain seems to be covered with fresh lava from an active
volcano. Dr. Stephen Saunders, the project's chief scientist, said Magellan's
first detailed mapping survey of the planet over the last 14 months has
produced compelling evidence that Venus "is dominated by volcanism on a global
scale."  </LEADPARA>
