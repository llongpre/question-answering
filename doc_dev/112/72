<HEAD>Magellan Bounces Radar Off Venus as Picture-Making Resumes</HEAD>

   The Magellan spacecraft bounced radar
off Venus today, trying to make maps of the cloud-covered planet
for the first time since the probe was plagued by communications
blackouts a month ago.
   ``We're mapping!'' said Jim Scott, Magellan mission director at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory. ``Most people are sighing with relief.''
   Magellan started bouncing radar waves off the cloud-covered
planet at 9:16 a.m. PDT, he said. The spacecraft is designed to
collect the echoes, then send the information to Earth, where they
will be assembled into maps and pictures.
   Confirmation that the radar echoes were collected properly and
would result in good pictures was expected later today, Scott said,
adding the pictures should be released publicly sometime next week.
   Engineers lost radio contact with Magellan for 14 hours starting
Aug. 16, then for 17{ hours beginning Aug. 21.
   They still haven't learned the cause of the temporary blackouts,
which they have said could happen again. But they gave Magellan new
computer instructions so it can recover quickly from future
communications breakdowns.
   Magellan's $744 million mission is designed to produce the most
detailed pictures yet of Venus' surface, concealed beneath dense
clouds, as well as a global map of the planet.
   The craft was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, and started orbiting Venus on Aug. 10.
