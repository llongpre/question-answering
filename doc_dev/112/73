   Space shuttle Atlantis next month
will carry out the nation's first interplanetary launch in 12 years
when it sends the Magellan probe toward Venus to map the planet
surface with super-sharp radar.
   ``I believe that we are looking at a rejuvenation, if you will,
of the planetary space program, that is very important, that has
been in the doldrums for a while due to budgetary concerns and, of
course recently, to a lack of launches,'' Atlantis commander Dave
Walker said Monday at a news conference with his four crewmates.
   Shuttle missions were grounded for nearly three years in the
wake of the Challenger explosion, which killed its seven astronauts
Jan. 28, 1986.
   Walker said the upcoming Atlantis flight is a ``logical marriage
between the manned and unmanned space programs.''
   Magellan will be the nation's first interplanetary launch in 12
years and the first from a shuttle, noted astronaut Ronald Grabe,
who will pilot Atlantis.
   ``So Magellan will be a very fulfilling flight for us. Not only
when we launch it, but 15 months later when it orbits Venus,'' he
said.
   The shuttle is scheduled to begin its four-day mission April 28.
Deployment of Magellan, the crew's primary goal, is scheduled to
occur about six hours after blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Fla.
After Magellan is released from the cargo bay, a payload motor will
start the 8,000-pound probe on a 466-day voyage to Venus.
   Magellan is to reach its destination on Aug. 10, 1990, swooping
into orbit around Venus to begin a 243-day period during which it
is to map the entire surface of the planet with high-resolution
radar.
   ``Venus is our closest neighbor in terms of space, mass and
size,'' said astronaut Norm Thagard. ``Planetary science is very
important to learning how the Earth evolved and what is going on
here. ... We worry about the greenhouse effect here on Earth.
Magellan could tell us if there are any parallels between Earth and
Venus.''
   Mary Cleave, a mission specialist on Atlantis, said the radar
images could also show whether Venus has shifting crustal plates
similar to those that sometimes cause earthquakes.
   ``Because there is no water on Venus, the radar can look at the
entire planet and this might help us understand plate tectonics on
Earth,'' she said.
   Earth and Venus were almost identical at the beginning of the
solar system, some 4.6 billion years ago. Today, Venus is shrouded
in a cloud of gases and its surface temperature is 900 degrees.
