   Atlantis outwaited fickle weather
and streaked into orbit today, carrying five astronauts who will
dispatch the Magellan probe to cloud-shrouded Venus for the best
look yet at Earth's nearest neighbor.
   The winged space shuttle thundered smoothly into the Florida sky
at 2:47 p.m. EDT, after being delayed a nail-biting 59 minutes by
shifting rain clouds and winds that had threatened a second
postponement in six days. NASA had 64 minutes in which to launch
today and used all but five minutes of that time.
   ``It was another cliff-hanger,'' said acting NASA administrator
Dale Meyers.
   The launch starts a 15-month journey of 806 million miles for
the robot explorer craft Magellan, the first American deep space
probe in 11 years. The $550 million craft, which had to be launched
by May 28 or wait two years, is carrying to Venus a powerful radar
system that will map most of the planet. Magellan is named for the
16th-century Portuguese explorer.
   Atlantis, riding a 700-foot cascade of flame, rose majestically
from its beachside launch pad into a blue, nearly cloudless sky,
rolled slowly on its planned path and streaked up and out of view.
   Two solid-fueled rocket booster rockets burned out after 2
minutes, six seconds, precisely on schedule, and were jettisoned.
Atlantis flew on, powered by its liquid-fueled rockets.
   The successful launch came despite dark clouds and showers
earlier in the day. By late in the launch window, sea breezes had
swept the skies and crosswinds were below the permitted 14 mph at
the Kennedy Space Center emergency landing site.
   NASA's first attempt to launch Atlantis last Friday was halted
just 31 seconds before liftoff when a flaw was detected in a fuel
pump. Later, engineers also found what appeared to be a leak in a
hydrogen fuel line. Both parts were replaced.
   The crew members for the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and
the fourth since the Challenger disaster, are commander David M.
Walker, pilot Ronald Grabe, and mission specialists Norman Thagard,
Mary Cleave and Mark Lee.
   Six hours after launch, Cleave and Lee operate remote controls
to eject Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay. A powerful rocket
will then send Magellan out of Earth orbit and start it on a voyage
that will carry it 1{ times around the sun before reaching Venus.
   Atlantis is to spend four days orbiting 184 miles above Earth
while the crew operates scientific experiments. Landing is set for
Monday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   Today's launch opportunity was determined by the path Magellan
must follow to reach Earth's mysterious neighbor. If the launch had
been postponed, there would have been daily launch opportunities
until May 28. At that point, Earth and Venus would have moved out
of alignment and the Magellan mission would not be possible for two
years.
   Magellan marks the beginning of a new era in a U.S. planetary
exploration program that has not had a launch since 1978.
   Venus has fascinated since humans first began scanning the sky.
It is the brightest object in the nighttime sky, except for the
moon. It appears in season as either the morning or the evening
``star,'' but Venus is actually a planet that orbits 67 million
miles from the sun. The Earth orbits 93 million miles from the sun.
   Scientists are intrigued by Venus because it is so close in size
to Earth, yet much different in most every other way. Venus rotates
the opposite direction of the Earth, which means the sun rises in
the west. Its rotation is so slow that a Venusian day lasts 243
Earth days.
   Venus is shrouded with dense clouds and its surface cannot be
seen by telescopes on Earth, giving the planet an aura of mystery.
   Space probes in recent years have proven that Venus' surface
temperature is about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead. The
atmosphere is carbon dioxide at intense pressures, with
high-altitude clouds of sulfuric acid.
   The torrid heat long ago boiled away any water that was on the
planet, but probes have hinted of vast mountain ranges, towering
volcanoes, and barren plains.
   Magellan will rendezvous with Venus in August 1990. It will
settle into an elongated orbit, sooping to within 155 miles of the
surface, and then sweeping out to a high point of almost 5,000
miles.
   The 3{-ton spacecraft carries an imaging radar that will give
the clearest picture yet of Venus. The radar is able to penetrate
the cloud cover and detect surface features as small as a football
field.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of Venus. The radar
will operate during 2,000 passes over the planet, each time viewing
a slice of surface and sending the image back to Earth for computer
enhancement. The mapping expedition is expected to last about eight
months.
   Magellan is the first in a series of deep space probes and marks
what Lennard Fisk, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's chief scientist, called ``a resurgence of
America's planetary program.''
   Pioneer-Venus, in 1978, was the last U.S. space launch and Fisk
said America ``had a planetary program that was in danger of being
an also-ran.''
   Voyager 2, launched in 1977, will fly past Neptune in August. It
earlier visted Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus. In October, the robot
craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A space telescope
will be launched next year, followed by probes to the sun in 1990,
and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' said Fisk.
