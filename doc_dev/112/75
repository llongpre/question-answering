   Magellan's mission to map Venus will be
delayed two days while engineers try to figure out why they
temporarily lost touch with the spaceship last week, NASA said
Monday.
   The spacecraft's 243-day mapping mission had been scheduled to
begin Aug. 29, but now will start Sept. 1, said Jim Doyle,
spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   The spacecraft already has used its radar to make its first test
pictures of the cloud-covered planet. The laboratory plans to
release those pictures Tuesday. Scientists said last week the
pictures show ``Venusquake''' faults, volcanic cinder cones and old
lava flows.
   Engineers lost touch with Magellan on Thursday for nearly 15
hours just after the spaceship sent those pictures to Earth.
Intermittent contact was restored midday Friday, then steady
communication was re-established Friday night.
   In an attempt to figure out the cause of the problem, engineers
spent the weekend unloading Magellan's memory banks. After that
task was completed Sunday night, the engineers started analyzing
the information to diagnose the malfunction, said Tommy Thompson,
Magellan science manager.
   He said engineers narrowed the cause of the communication
problem to four or five possibilities.
   Magellan went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10 after a looping
948 million-mile trip from Earth. It was launched from the space
shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989.
   The $744 million Magellan mission aims to use radar to peer
through Venus' thick clouds and make the best pictures yet of the
planet's landscape.
