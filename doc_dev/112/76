   The shuttle Atlantis and its five
astronauts were ready for a midafternoon launch today on a mission
to start a robot craft streaking toward Venus, the cloud-shrouded
planet that is an abiding mystery to scientists.
   The crew finished final spacecraft checks and NASA officials
said the space probe called Magellan was ready as the 23-minute
launch window approached. The schedule called for liftoff no
earlier than 2:24 p.m.
   Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, said launch of the
explorer craft Magellan will mark ``a resurgence of America's
planetary program.'' The last American probe to deep space was
dispatched in 1978.
   Preparations moved smoothly since the countdown began Tuesday. A
launch control commentator announced ``all conditions look good''
for launch time weather in Florida. Officials kept close watch on
wind conditions at emergency landing sites here and across the
Atlantic Ocean.
   Atlantis was scheduled to lift off at 2:24 p.m. EDT, heading to
orbit on a four-day mission 184 miles above Earth.
   Launch pad workers completed fueling early this morning. After
breakfast, the astronauts donned the bright orange launch suits
they would wear into space. They smiled and waved to NASA workers
as they headed to their beachfront launch pad.
   Magellan is to be released from Atlantis' cargo bay six hours
after launch and sent streaking on a 15-month, 806 million-mile
unmanned trip of its own.
   Mission specialists Mary Cleave and Mark Lee will operate remote
controls that propel Magellan from the shuttle's cargo bay.
Atlantis is commanded by David M. Walker. The other crew members
are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission specialist Norman Thagard.
   The liftoff opportunity, dictated by Magellan's path to Venus
and lighting conditions at emergency landing sites, lasts only 23
minutes, one of the shortest launch windows in shuttle history.
   After its release from the shuttle, Magellan's own rocket will
send it out of Earth orbit. Over the next 15 months, the craft will
fly around the sun 1{ times before settling into an orbit of Venus
in August 1990.
   Venus has intrigued humans as long as they've looked heavenward
and marveled at the universe. The planet, the familiar ``star'' of
the morning or evening, appears just before dawn or just after
sunset as a brilliant, unblinking point of light. Its brightness in
the nighttime sky is rivaled only by the moon.
   Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor, with an orbit 25.7 million
miles away, and the two often are considered to be sister planets
since they are about the same size. But the worlds differ mightily:
Dense clouds of carbon dioxide choke Venus, which has a surface
temperature of about 900 degrees, hot enough to melt lead.
   Magellan will be carrying some of the most sophisticated remote
mapping sensors ever sent to another planet.
   An imaging radar system will be able to detect features on the
surface as small as 100 yards, about the size of a football field.
The radar will be operated during almost 2,000 passes over the
Venusian surface, each time viewing a slice of the planet and then
sending the image back to Earth for computer enhancements.
   Magellan is expected to map about 90 percent of the surface
while orbiting Venus for about 243 Earth days, equal to a single
Venus day.
   The last U.S. planetary probe was the Pioneer-Venus, launched in
1978.
   Fisk said that in the 11 years since, ``we had a planetary
program that was in danger of being an also-ran.''
   Magellan is the first in a series of American planetary
exploration missions.
   Voyager 2, a probe launched in 1977 and an earlier visitor to
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, will fly past Neptune in August. In
October, the robot craft Galileo will be launched toward Jupiter. A
space telescope will be launched next year, followed by probes to
the sun in October 1990, and to Mars in 1992.
   ``Nobody is going to question our leadership in planetary
(exploration) again,'' Fisk said at a Thursday news conference.
   Its cloud cover blocks telescope views of Venus and until the
Space Age little was known about the planet's surface. Twenty space
probes have been sent to Venus, including four by the United
States, but only tiny fragments of the surface have been
photographed.
   Stephen Saunders, Magellan project scientist, said the Magellan
studies may help scientists understand how the Earth developed into
a place where life flourishes while Venus became a world of torrid
heat.
