   The Magellan spacecraft completed a
four-day run-through of the tasks it will perform when it enters
Venus' orbit to map that planet later this year, scientists said.
   The spacecraft, 104 million miles from Earth and 12 million
miles from Venus, completed 100 hours of maneuvers, data gathering
and communication with ground stations on Earth on Friday
afternoon, said Magellan project manager Anthony J. Spear.
   The spacecraft performed flawlessly, Spear said.
   Magellan is scheduled to go into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10
to begin a 243-day mission mapping about 90 percent of Earth's
sister planet.
   The spacecraft will look for ancient stream channels, shorelines
and other evidence the planet once had oceans.
   Scientists believe an unchecked greenhouse effect _ in which the
carbon dioxide atmosphere trapped solar heat _ raised the planet's
temperature until water disappeared.
   Gravity forces on Venus will be studied by plotting the path of
Magellan as it swoops to within 155 miles of the planet's surface,
then sweeps out to a high orbit point of 4,977 miles.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989.
