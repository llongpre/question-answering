   Scientists offered a warning as they
celebrated the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Pioneer 12
space probe, which has helped demystify the cloud-shrouded planet
Venus.
   ``Venus is not a living, breathing example, but a very dead
example of what a polluted atmosphere is like,'' said Donald Hunten,
a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona.
   Venus has a history that suggests devastation by an extreme
greenhouse effect and extensive, naturally occurring stratospheric
pollution _ damage that researchers said may have particular meaning
for the Earth's inhabitants.
   But the words of warning Monday were mixed with messages of
congratulation. The success of the mission, originally expected to
last for 243 days, has delighted researchers who now predict that
the spacecraft will continue providing information for four more
years before its fuel supply runs out.
   The spacecraft has already generated 10 trillion pieces of data.
   Researchers are seeking clues to the mysterious planet, which is
similar in size, mass and density to the Earth. Scientists wonder if
there are clues to the Earth's future buried in the 5 billion-year
history of Venus.
   Venus, however, is much closer to the sun than is Earth, 67.2
million miles compared with 93 million miles.
   So far, the probe has helped map 93 percent of Venus' searing-hot
surface and helped to reveal continents, high mountains and deep
canyons like the Earth's ocean trenches.
   Pioneer 12 has provided a new understanding of volcanic activity
and land formation on Earth and has also revealed a severe
greenhouse effect on Venus that researchers believe may be the cause
of a surface temperature of 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
   ``We used to think when I was in school that Venus and Earth were
twin planets,'' said Hunten. ``More recently, we've discovered they
are really not very alike at all.''
   It appears to have been 4 billion years since Venus, which has no
oceans today, may have had enough water vapor to form one, he said.
   Information now suggests that high temperatures from the planet's
greenhouse effect, in which clouds or airborne pollution trap the
sun's heat near the planet's surface, may partially account for the
differences between Venus and Earth, researchers said.
   Additionally, extreme stratospheric pollution on Venus, where
chlorine is found at levels 100 to 1,000 times the concentration
found above Earth, could further explain conditions on Venus and
provide an warning for our own future.
   ``What I think it means to Earth is that we have to take these
threats to heart,'' said Hunten. ``We should not ignore these
warnings. These two examples of stratospheric pollution and the
greenhouse effect are real. It is happening on the Earth.''
   Scientists who gathered at NASA's Ames Research Center to
celebrate the mission's anniversary also urged a return to unmanned
probes in addition to the far more costly manned missions now
popular.
   Steven Dorfman of Hughes Aircraft Co., a major government space
contractor, called for ``a return to a mix of small and large
programs,'' pointing out that the Pioneer project was relatively
cheap at less than $200 million in today's dollars.
   Dorfman said the U.S. sent 36 planetary launches aloft in the
1960s, but only 11 in the 1970s and just two are scheduled for this
decade.
   Next year, the Magellan mission will team up with Pioneer to
provide high resolution radar mapping of the geography of Venus. In
February 1990, Pioneer will team up with the Galileo orbiter as it
passes Venus on its way to Jupiter.
   Pioneer's unique variable orbit, which responds to the effect of
solar gravity on Venus, has allowed the spacecraft to come as close
as 150 kilometers _ 93 miles _ to Venus and as distant as 2,300
kilometers, or 1,426 miles.
