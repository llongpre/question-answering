   Being a Venus' flytrap is no snap.
   First, the plant's popularity with American children has
waned. And it got bad publicity in the film "Little Shop of
Horrors." Now thousands of them are being filched from the
few remaining spots where they grow.

   Officials in North Carolina say the flytrap, the plant
with the bristled leaves that clamp shut on bugs, is in a
fight for survival. Developers and industry have crowded the
carnivore out of many of the wetlands where it once grew (in
the wild, it's now found in only 11 counties in the
Carolinas). The shrinking habitat and continuing demand
overseas have made the plant a poachers' favorite.
   "Whole savannas where flytraps were abundant have been
cleaned out," says Cecil Frost, coordinator of the North
Carolina Plant Conservation Program.
   The poaching problem has become so severe that, effective
June 1, the state's Plant Conservation Board stiffened the
penalties for picking flytraps. Fines can run $100 to $500
per plant for a first offense and as much as $1,000 for a
second offense.
   Undaunted, more than 25 poachers are making a living by
digging up flytraps in the 50,000-acre Holly Shelter game
lands, estimates Herman Strickland, a state wildlife officer.
"As hot as it is, they'll walk eight to 10 miles to dig these
things," says Mr. Strickland. "They're taking the chance of
ticks, parasites and snakes. We know good well they're making
money to go to that trouble." The state estimates that a
poacher can make more than $200 a day harvesting flytraps.
   Despite the run on wild flytraps, U.S. demand for them has
waned, according to the largest flytrap grower, James
Northrop of Northrop's Insectivorous Plant Farm in Hampstead,
N.C. "Twenty-five years ago every kid had a Venus' flytrap,"
he laments. "Now they don't."
   But there are still buyers abroad. Lorenzo Marshall, a
nursery owner in Harrison Creek, N.C., sells 75% of his
flytraps to Holland, Japan and Germany. Most go to a German
pharmaceutical company that extracts a flytrap enzyme for a
drug used in cancer and AIDS cases. With stiffer fines
scaring away some illegal competition, Mr. Marshall gained
five international customers in recent months.
   The plants definitely have their local fans. "I'd love to
have a whole lot more around," says Milton McLean, another
wildlife officer. "They eat ticks."
