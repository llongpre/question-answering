   A run-amok computer on Magellan got a
partial memory transplant Thursday as engineers treated symptoms of
a mysterious ailment that twice made them lose touch with the
Venus-orbiting spaceship.
   The malfunctions ``have shaken the spacecraft, but the overall
spacecraft remains very healthy, and we're very optimistic we'll be
back to a fruitful mission soon,'' said Ed Sherry, technical
assistant to Magellan's project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Magellan is on a $744-million mission to use its radar to peer
through the clouds of Venus and make the most detailed pictures and
maps yet of the second planet from the sun. It went into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10, about 15 months after it was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis. It now is about 149 million miles from Earth.
   Lab spokesman Jim Doyle said it isn't yet known how long
Magellan's troubles will delay the official start of its mapping
effort, which was to begin the first week of September.
   More pictures from Magellan's first radar test will be released
Friday, he said. The first pictures, released Tuesday, showed
numerous ``Venusquake'' faults, old lava flows, craters, cinder
cones, valleys and ridges on the planet.
   Engineers continued unloading Magellan's computer memory banks
Thursday to get flight data that will help them figure out why
Magellan broke off radio contact for more than 14 hours Aug. 16-17
and again for 17{ hours ending Wednesday afternoon.
   On both occasions, engineers sent computer commands to
Magellan's presumed position to get its safety systems to restore
radio contact.
   The ultimate problem that made Magellan lose contact on both
occasions remains unknown. But flight data show that Tuesday night,
the spacecraft's automatic safety systems were unable to maintain
radio contact as expected because part of the memory was
``corrupted'' in a backup computer that helps point Magellan,
Sherry said.
   So engineers replaced the faulty contents of that computer's
memory with a rewritten version that was radioed to the spacecraft
Thursday, he said.
   ``We don't know what triggered these events,'' he added. ``We're
fixing the symptoms. We're taking the steps to keep Magellan
running.''
   Engineers also reactivated Magellan's safety systems, some of
which were intentionally disabled Wednesday to prevent them from
again cutting off contact between the spacecraft and Earth.
   The spacecraft has four computers: a main computer and its
backup, and an ``attitude-control'' computer and backup that help
aim Magellan.
   Sherry said the backup pointing computer ``started to run amok''
Aug. 16 after an unknown problem triggered a chain of events that
made Magellan lose contact the first time. That's when four
computer ``words'' in its memory went bad, he added.
   When another yet-undiagnosed problem developed Tuesday night,
the main computer checked the condition of the backup pointing
computer, found ``something was not kosher'' in its memory and, as
a result, assumed Magellan was pointing in the wrong direction _
which it wasn't, Sherry said.
   That mistake prompted automatic safety systems to protect
Magellan by turning the spacecraft to make sure its solar panels
could draw power from the sun. When the spacecraft turned, contact
was lost because its secondary antenna no longer pointed at Earth.
   Doyle said the mixed message between the main computer and the
backup pointing computer was ``like someone wants to mail you
something, but the post office has your address messed up.''
   After contact was lost Tuesday night, some NASA officials feared
Magellan might be lost forever. But Sherry said that when contact
was restored, ``a lot of the engineers sat there smugly and said,
`We told you the spacecraft was a real honey and would do what it
was built to do.'''
