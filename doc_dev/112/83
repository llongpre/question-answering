Photo, A Venusian View: The Magellan spacecraft has left its communications 
problems behind and has begun its exploration of the planet Venus. The craft is 
using a radar camera to map the surface of the hot, cloudy planet, and early 
images confirm that Venus is much like its sister planet, Earth. As the craft 
orbits Venus, it maps a strip 15 miles wide, revealing deep, wide valleys 
(shown as white lines) that apparently were caused by a combination of volcanic 
and earthquake-like processes. The Magellan mission is managed by the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. National Aeronautics and Space
