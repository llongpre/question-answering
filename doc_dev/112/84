<P>
Space shuttle Atlantis was moved to the launch pad Wednesday for liftoff next 
month on a mission to send a radar probe to map the surface of cloud-shrouded 
Venus. 
</P>
<P>
The spaceship is scheduled for launch April 28 with a crew of five astronauts 
whose main task will be to start the 7,600-pound Magellan spacecraft on its 
15-month journey to the mysterious planet. 
</P>
<P>
No American spacecraft has been launched toward the planets since 1978, and 
Magellan will be the first planet-bound craft to be released from a space 
shuttle. Magellan's assignment is to orbit Venus and map the surface with a 
powerful radar that will send back images of features as small as 150 yards 
across.
