   The robot probe Magellan streaked
across the solar system today at 25,000 mph on its way to Venus,
and the astronauts who launched the spacecraft turned to more
routine tasks aboard Atlantis.
   Deployment of the probe from the shuttle's cargo bay Thursday
night signaled a revival of an American planetary-science program
that has been dormant since 1978.
   ``The spacecraft is performing just beautifully. All systems are
operational and nominal. It couldn't be better,'' John Gerpheide,
Magellan project manager, said a few hours after the probe was
launched.
   Atlantis' fiery blastoff Thursday afternoon followed a
cliff-hanging, 59-minute wait that ground controllers and the five
astronauts endured because of the fickle Florida weather. With just
five minutes left in the shuttle's launch window, controllers found
a hole in the clouds and Atlantis thundered into the sky at 2:47
p.m. EDT.
   About six hours after the liftoff, Magellan was gently ejected
from the shuttle's cargo bay and the $550-million interplanetary
mission began.
   ``At last check, all systems were working exceptionally well on
Magellan,'' Mission Control commentator Jeffrey Carr said early
today.
   The space shuttle also was performing well, Carr said.
   Mission Control awoke the crew today at about 9:20 a.m. EDT with
a rousing rendition of the theme music from the movie ``Superman.''
   ``Good-morning and congratulations on a super day yesterday,''
Mission Control told the crew.
   ``Good morning Houston,'' commander David Walker replied.
``We're up and around. Everybody's feeling good, trying to find our
toothbrushes.
   ``We thank you for that fine wake-up music,'' Walker said.
   During the rest of the mission, the astronauts will try to
photograph lightning systems at night and attempt to grow crystals
of indium by melting and then re-solidying the material.
   The crew members also will take other photographs of the Earth
as well as test various systems on the orbiter. Another planned
project includes taking saliva samples during the flight to
determine how an anti-motion sickness drug is absorbed by the body
in zero gravity.
   Atlantis, in orbit 184 miles above the Earth, is scheduled to
land Monday afternoon at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``It was really a wonderful day for us, the beginning of the
rebirth of the planetary program,'' Gerpheide said. ``It's the
beginning of a really grand set of missions which will last for
quite a few years.''
   ``While it's too early to tell about the major portion of
Magellan's mission, we're pleased it's gone so well so far,''
Walker said when told Magellan had been launched on its journey.
   Magellan was the first planetary craft deployed from a space
shuttle.
   The Magellan is moving at a rate of 25,000 mph, relative to
Earth, meaning it travels about 416 miles in just sixty seconds. At
its current rate, Magellan could get from Washington D.C. to New
York in a minute and could fly coast-to-coast in about seven
minutes.
   But it will take the spacecraft 15 months to travel to Venus,
the cloud-shrouded planet that is 158 million miles away. The probe
will loop 1{ times around the sun and travel 806 million miles
before reaching its destination in August 1990.
   Once in orbit above Venus, Magellan is to use its radar system
to map up to 90 percent of the planet's surface. The
high-resolution radar is expected to produce images of objects as
small as a football field _ 10 times the clarity of any previous
pictures of Venus.
   Venus, where the surface temperature is 900 degrees, has long
intrigued scientists because it is close in size to the Earth but
so different in many other ways. The sun rises in the west because
Venus rotates the opposite direction of Earth, and its rotation is
so slow that a day there lasts 243 Earth days.
   Magellan, named for the 16th-century Portuguese explorer, needed
to be launched by May 28 or it would have had to wait two years for
Earth and Venus to again be in a favorable alignment.
   NASA had tried to launch Atlantis last Friday, but a flaw
detected in a fuel pump halted the liftoff. Engineers later found
what appeared to be a leak in a hydrogen fuel line, and both parts
were replaced before Thursday's launch.
   Crew members on the mission, the 29th shuttle flight and the
fourth since the Challenger disaster, are Walker, pilot Ronald
Grabe, and mission specialists Norman Thagard, Mary Cleave and Mark
Lee.
   Magellan's mission marks the beginning of a new era in solar
system exploration that has been dormant since 1978 when the
Pioneer-Venus spacecraft was launched.
   In October, another Atlantis crew is to start the Galileo probe
on its way to Jupiter, the Hubble Space Telescope is scheduled for
launch from a shuttle early next year, Ulysses is to orbit the sun
in October 1990 and the Mars Observer spacecraft will be dispatched
in 1992 on an unmanned rocket.
