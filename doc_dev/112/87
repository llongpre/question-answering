After a shaky start, the Magellan probe is successfully mapping cloud-shrouded 
Venus, beaming back "revolutionary" views of a heavily fractured, volcanic 
planet that may be geologically active, scientists at the Jet Propulsion 
Laboratory in Pasadena said today.

A brief but dramatic movie made with Magellan data was presented at a news 
conference that simulated a zooming 12-mile-high flight above a tortured region 
of complex faults and fractures. Other photographs released today, including a 
giant 10-by-10-foot mosaic, show numerous volcanic craters, sharply defined Los 
Angeles-sized impact craters and broad regions of cracked terrain covered in 
places by lava flows indicating a possibly geologically active planet.
