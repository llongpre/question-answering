   Pioneer 12 was designed to orbit
Venus for just 243 days, but it chalked up a solid decade of work
Monday amid raves from the scientists who've kept the project
working.
   The space probe has helped map 93 percent of Venus' searing-hot
surface while providing a new understanding of volcanics and land
formation on Earth.
   It has sent scientists 10 trillion bits of data, including
information on the extreme ``greenhouse'' effect which appears to be
trapping the sun's heat and driving the planet's surface temperature
to 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
   It also has allowed them to speculate on the ways in which Venus,
once thought to be the Earth's twin because of its similar size,
composition and the presence of continents, mountains and canyons,
is different from our home planet.
   ``We used to think when I was in school that Venus and Earth were
twin planets,'' said Donald Hunten, a professor of planetary
sciences at the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary
Laboratory, said at a meeting of scientists celebrating Pioneer's
longevity. ``More recently, we've discovered they are really not
very alike at all.''
   Scientists at the meeting took the opportunity to call for a
return to unmanned space probes in addition to the far more costly
manned missions.
   Steven Dorfman, who works for Hughes Aircraft Co., a major
government space contractor, called for ``a return to a mix of small
and large programs,'' pointing out that the Pioneer project was
relatively cheap at less than $200 million in today's dollars.
   Dorfman said the United States launched 36 planetary launches in
the 1960s, but only 11 in the 1970s. Two are scheduled in this
decade.
   Although Venus has no oceans, Hunten said data suggests there may
have been enough water vapor to form an ocean 4 billion years ago.
   But high temperatures from the planet's severe ``greenhouse''
effect, in which clouds or pollution traps the sun's heat near the
planet's surface, may partially account for the differences between
Venus and Earth, he said.
   Additionally, extreme stratospheric pollution on Venus, where
chlorine is found at levels 100 to 1,000 times the concentration
found in the air above Earth, could further explain conditions on
Venus and provide a warning of our own future.
   ``Venus is not a living, breathing example, but a very dead
example of what a polluted atmosphere is like,'' said Hunten, adding
that the pollution on Venus is natural but the chemistry is the same
as on Earth.
   Lawrence Colin, Pioneer Venus project scientist, said the
anniversary is just ``a step along the way to many of us.''
   Pioneer's variable orbit, which responds to the effect of solar
gravity on Venus, has allowed the spacecraft to come as close as 93
miles to Venus and as distant as 1,426 miles.
   If plans are carried out on scheduled, next year the Magellan
mission will team up with Pioneer to provide high resolution radar
mapping of Venus' surface. In February 1990, Pioneer will be joined
by the Galileo probe when it passes Venus on its way to Jupiter.
   Pioneer will continue to sample Venus' environment, including
monitoring an entire 11-year sunspot cycle.
   In late 1991, it will sample Venus' upper atmosphere. In early
1992, it will begin to burn its remaining fuel supply to maintain an
orbit of 150 kilometers, ``or lower if we can,'' said Colin.
   When the fuel supply runs out, estimated at some time late in
1992, he added, ``Pioneer Venus will meet a fiery death, the end of
the mission.''
