   The Magellan spacecraft accelerated
toward Venus today on a mission to make the most detailed pictures
yet of the cloud-shrouded planet's rugged surface.
   If all goes as planned, a computer program will order the
3.7-ton spaceship to fire its rocket Friday, slowing Magellan so it
will go into orbit around the second planet from the sun, NASA said.
   The $413 million Magellan, centerpiece of a $744 million
mission, was released from the shuttle Atlantis in May 1989, then
launched by a booster rocket.
   Once Magellan is in orbit, engineers will test its radar and, if
necessary, fire the spacecraft's thrusters to adjust its path.
   During the week of Aug. 26, Magellan will begin using its radar
to peer through thick Venusian clouds to make pictures and maps of
the planet.
   The first pictures probably won't be released until September,
NASA said.
