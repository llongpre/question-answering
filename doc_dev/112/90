   The Magellan spacecraft responded to a
computer command and successfully corrected its trajectory Sunday,
increasing the speed of its travel toward Venus, officials said.
   The maneuver was completed at 7 p.m. Sunday with a 5.6 second
rocket burn, said officials with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The
lab controls the United State's unmanned planetary explorations.
   The correction increases the spacecraft's velocity by about 6.6
miles per hour.
   The spacecraft, launched from the space shuttle Atlantis on May
4, hurtles at 60,022 miles per hour as it continues its 15-month
journey toward Venus. There it will map most of the surface of the
planet with imaging radar.
   Another maneuver to correct Magellan's path through space is set
for Aug. 10, 1990 _ 17 days before the spacecraft enters orbit
around Venus.
