   Trouble-plagued NASA restored steady
radio contact with Magellan on Wednesday after losing touch with
the malfunctioning spacecraft for the second time since it started
orbiting Venus.
   Engineers received radio signals from Magellan at about 4:33
p.m. PDT showing that its secondary antenna obeyed computer orders
and was firmly pointed at Earth, allowing them to maintain a
continuous link with the wayward spaceship, said Tommy Thompson,
Magellan science manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``It took a ton off our shoulders,'' he said. ``We're going home
with smiles on our faces.''
   Intermittent contact had been restored at 12:32 p.m. PDT when a
brief ``blip'' of a radio signal was received by NASA's Deep Space
Network tracking station in Goldstone, Calif. That was about 17{
hours after contact was lost Tuesday night, laboratory spokesman
Bob MacMillin said.
   ``You could hear cheers and clapping when we reacquired the
signal,'' Thompson said.
   In an attempt to prevent further communications breakdowns,
engineers were sending additional computer commands to Magellan to
disable some of its safety systems, said Thompson. Those systems
cut off communications with Earth on Aug. 16 and again Tuesday
night when they detected some unknown problem aboard Magellan.
   The spacecraft's $744 million mission to make the best pictures
of Venus yet had been scheduled to start the first week of
September, but likely will be delayed until the problem is
diagnosed and fixed, Thompson said.
   ``The patient is resting comfortably and is strong and healthy,
but needs an operation _ and we don't know which operation right
now,'' he said of Magellan.
   The spaceship's first radio blip to Earth on Wednesday afternoon
indicated the spaceship finally had accepted repeated computer
commands to start spinning and send radio signals into space so
that some of those signals reached Earth, he added.
   Engineers received more intermittent signals before sending
Magellan orders to stop spinning and keep an antenna aimed at
Earth. Those orders restored steady radio communications.
   Earlier, National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials
expressed optimism they would overcome the problem.
   ``I wouldn't say people are thrilled, but nobody's panicking.
We're very optimistic we'll be able to regain contact with the
spacecraft, figure out what's wrong and continue the mission,''
Ellen Stofan, assistant to Magellan's chief scientist, had said.
   The successful conclusion of Magellan's latest crisis averted,
at least temporarily, another severe setback for NASA.
   The agency temporarily grounded its shuttle fleet this summer
due to hydrogen fuel leaks, and also discovered the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope's performance was badly impaired by a flawed
mirror.
   Planetary scientist Steve Wall said Magellan's radio signal
fluttered in and out of contact before fading away Tuesday night,
indicating an unknown problem made the spacecraft turn so the
antenna it was using at the time no longer pointed at Earth.
   ``We do not believe anything like a massive failure occurred,''
he said.
   Venus and Magellan were almost 149 million miles from Earth on
Wednesday, Wall said. Venus is Earth's nearest neighbor, and is the
second planet from the sun.
   Magellan was designed to use radar to peer through Venus' thick
clouds to make the most detailed pictures and maps yet of the
rugged landscape, where temperatures reach 900 degrees Fahrenheit
due to an out-of-control ``greenhouse effect.''
   The spacecraft was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4,
1989, then looped around the sun 1{ times, traveling 948 million
miles before it slid into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10.
   Magellan first lost contact with Earth for more than 14 hours
starting the night of Aug. 16. Then its automatic safety systems
made the spacecraft spin slowly while beaming radio signals across
the skies until some reached Earth.
   That resulted in eight hours of intermittent communications.
Then engineers sent commands that restored a steady radio link.
   The safety systems didn't automatically make Magellan start
spinning when its radio link failed for the second time starting at
7 p.m. Tuesday. Wall said the signal fluttered for 13 minutes
before fading out.
   That happened less than eight hours after NASA released
Magellan's first test pictures of Venus. The pictures showed that
at least a small part of the planet's surface has been violently
shaped by quake faults and vast volcanic lava flows.
   Stofan said prime suspects as the cause of Magellan's
communications problem are defects in its computer programs or its
hardware.
   Engineers had said Tuesday the leading theory to explain last
week's outage was that Magellan's electronics were briefly
disrupted by a cosmic ray or a high-energy particle from the sun.
   Jet Propulsion Laboratory is known for designing spacecraft to
fix their own malfunctions.
   Voyager 2's main receiving antenna failed after its launch in
1977, leaving it deaf for about a week until the probe
automatically switched to a working backup receiver, laboratory
spokesman Jim Wilson said. The probe successfully completed a
12-year exploration of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune last
year.
