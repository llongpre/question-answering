   The robot Magellan probe streaked on
a near-perfect path toward Venus on Friday while Atlantis'
astronauts melted metal and did other routine tests in orbit.
   The astronauts' work load was light because the heavy weight of
Magellan and its rocket booster, totaling 45,000 pounds, had
restricted the amount of experiments they could carry for the
four-day mission.
   Conversation from the astronauts also was light as they
methodically went about their work, talking only sparingly with
controllers on the ground.
   The 7,600-pound Magellan, launched late Thursday, was more than
175,000 miles from the shuttle by late Friday afternoon and zipping
deeper into space, its systems operating perfectly, officials said.
It still had about 158 million miles to go.
   Barreling along initially at 25,000 mph, the craft slowed
gradually to a cruising speed of about 7,000 mph. When it reaches
its target in August 1990, the tug of Venusian gravity will have
increased the speed again to about 25,000 mph.
   The spacecraft was in excellent condition and on a course that
was only .5 of a degree off normal, Magellan officials said. Such a
deviation was expected, they said, and on May 21, a ground station
will send a signal to trigger a small motor firing to adjust the
path.
   ``The spacecraft is performing just beautifully. All systems are
operational and nominal. It couldn't be better,'' John Gerpheide,
Magellan project manager, said a few hours after the probe was
launched. ``It was really a wonderful day for us, the beginning of
the rebirth of the planetary program.''
   Magellan is the first U.S. planetary mission in 11 years and the
first ever launched from a space shuttle.
   Mission Control in Houston awakened the astronauts Friday for
their first full day in space with the theme music from the movie
``Superman.''
   ``Good morning and congratulations on a super day yesterday,''
said Mission Control communicator Ken Cameron.
   ``Good morning, Houston,'' commander David Walker replied.
``We're up and around. Everybody's feeling good, trying to find our
toothbrushes.''
   Afterward, the astronauts worked with a 128-pound
metals-processing furnace the size of a small microwave oven. They
also brought along medical experiments and several cameras for
photographing the Earth and night lightning strikes in the clouds
below.
   The crew was melting and resolidifying small samples of indium
and selenium in the furnace to see how they react in
weightlessness. Potential applications for such space-made
materials include advanced electronic and optical devices.
   The astronauts reported one melting indium sample may have been
affected by vibrations when Walker briefly fired the shuttle's
steering thrusters in a test for the Strategic Defensive
Initiative, the so-called Star Wars plan to build a missile defense
system. Tracking devices in Hawaii recorded the firings to help SDI
engineers better understand the characteristics of ignitions in
space.
   Flight director Ron Dittemore said in Houston it was not certain
the sample was bothered by the vibrations.
   He reported Atlantis' systems were in excellent condition and
the only problems were ``just annoyances.'' He said a facsimile
machine being tested for sending documents to the shuttle was shut
down when its paper jammed and that a machine for measuring blood
pressure in the jugular system failed.
   Mission specialists Mary Cleave and Mark Lee released Magellan
from the cargo bay by remote control late Thursday, slightly more
than six hours after Atlantis blasted into orbit from Kennedy Space
Center.
   An hour later, two bursts from an on-board rocket propelled the
robot on the start of the $550 million mission to map the surface
of cloud-shrouded Venus with a high resolution radar system.
   Venus is 158 million miles from Earth. But Magellan, looping 1{
times around the sun, will travel 806 million miles to reach its
destination.
   The probe's radar is to map up to 90 percent of the Venusian
surface during a 243-day orbital period. The images, enhanced by
computers, are expected to show features as small as a football
field; that would be 10 times clearer than pictures obtained by
earlier spacecraft.
   The pictures could tell scientists much about the history of
Venus and how it evolved so differently from Earth, although both
were believed to be nearly identical at the beginning of the solar
system, 4.6 billion years ago.
   Atlantis is to return to Earth on Monday, landing at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., at 12:43 p.m. PDT. The other crew members are
pilot Ron Grabe and mission specialist Norman Thagard.
