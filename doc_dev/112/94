   The Magellan spacecraft heading to Venus
will maneuver Sunday night to slightly alter its course and
increase speed, Jet Propulsion Laboratory officials said.
   Magellan was moving at 59,970 mph relative to the sun Friday.
The maneuver at 7 p.m. PDT Sunday will increase the velocity by
about 6.6 mph.
   Jim Doyle, spokesman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory which
controls America's unmanned planetary explorations, said Friday
that the correction is the first of two built into the mission's
trajectory.
   The space shuttle Atlantis carried Magellan into Earth orbit May
4 and launched it toward cloudy Venus.
   Magellan's mission is to map up to 90 percent of the Venusian
surface with imaging radar. The spacecraft will go into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10, 1990. A second trajectory correction will
be performed 17 days before it goes into that orbit.
