   Voyager 2 cruised away from Neptune and
toward the stars Tuesday, completing an $865 million trek past 60
worlds, a triumphant exploration that might help humans prevent
destruction of their own planet.
   ``If you want to understand Earth, go look at other worlds,''
said Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan, a member of the team
that analyzed about 81,000 photographs taken by Voyager 2 and its
twin, Voyager 1.
   ``Our passion to explore, our deep need to understand our
origins, and the very urgent and practical matter of safeguarding
our planet are all enormously enhanced by studying other planets.''
   As scientists held a final news conference at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory to summarize Voyager 2's discoveries, the
one-ton spacecraft was 2.76 billion miles from Earth and 4.2 million
miles beyond Neptune, the solar system's fourth-largest and
currently most-distant planet.
   Voyager also was nearly 4.5 billion miles along a curving path
that took it from Earth in 1977, past Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in
1981 and Uranus in 1986, and now past Neptune in search of the edge
of the solar system. Voyager 1 explored Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn
in 1980.
   For $865 million _ 20 cents per year per American since the
project started _ the twin Voyagers visited four planets with at
least 56 moons, discovering at least 23 of the satellites and
examining worlds of wonder, like Jupiter's moon Io, with its
sulfur-spewing volcanoes.
   ``As exciting as the discoveries at Neptune have been, this
encounter has really just been the fourth and final planet that
Voyager has revealed in an unprecedented decade of discovery in its
journey through the outer solar system,'' said Voyager project
scientist Edward Stone. ``For those of us fortunate enough to be
involved, this has been the journey of a lifetime.''
   At Neptune, Voyager 2 discovered six moons in addition to Nereid
and Triton, which were first detected from Earth. It discovered
three thin rings of debris and two broad rings orbiting the planet.
It found at least six moonlets hidden in one of the rings.
   The spacecraft detected in Neptune's bluish atmosphere an
Earth-sized swirling storm called the Great Dark Spot, 720 mph
winds, photochemical smog, invisible ultraviolet auroras and cirrus
clouds of natural gas casting shadows on clouds far below.
   Voyager revealed two bizarre types of ice volcanoes on icy,
pinkish Triton. The first kind are calderas _ 1,000-foot-deep
craters measuring hundreds of miles across _ that produced
ocean-size floods of ice flowing like lava, probably no more
recently than a half billion years ago, said U.S. Geological Survey
geologist Laurence Soderblom.
   The second type can erupt explosively, ejecting nitrogen ice and
gas 25 miles high at speeds of 560 mph _ higher and faster than
initially estimated, he said. He said he suspects the nitrogen
volcanoes are active today or were active within the past 300 years.
   Soderblom drew gasps of amazement when he showed a Voyager
photograph of one of the calderas, computer enhanced to make it look
as it would to someone standing on Triton's surface and seeing the
crater in three dimensions.
   Scientists also presented new findings Tuesday showing Neptune's
weak, tilted magnetic field doesn't go through the center of planet
but is offset about four-tenths of the way toward the surface. That,
plus new evidence that matter is distributed unevenly inside the
planet, suggests the liquid that generates the magnetic field may
exist in a shallow spherical shell, not in a deep central core as
inside the Earth.
   ``These observations are just as arcane as the discoveries of
Captain Cook or even the posthumous accounts of Magellan,'' said
Planetary Society vice president Bruce Murray, former director of
Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``The discoveries challenge our
imagination and seem just like science fiction. But they may be very
important and very relevant to our grandchildren and their
grandchildren.''
   The knowledge gathered by the Voyagers may help alert their human
masters to the vulnerability of Earth, a tiny garden threatened by
nuclear warfare, the greenhouse effect and destruction of the ozone
shield.
   ``If you look who discovered these dangers ... you find a
remarkable preponderance of present and past planetary scientists,''
Sagan said.
   He said Sherwood Rowland and Mario Molina first warned of
depletion of Earth's ozone layer using chemical formulas devised to
help NASA understand the atmosphere of Venus. Molina now works at
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Sagan and other planetary scientists developed the theory that
smoke from nuclear war could plunge Earth into a dark, cold nuclear
winter and cause mass starvation of those who survived the exchange
of warheads.
   ``The idea ultimately evolved from our attempt to understand the
great Martian dust storm of 1971-72,'' which was detected by Mariner
9 and chilled Mars' already cold surface, Sagan said.
   From Mariner and the space probe Pioneer, scientists studied the
runaway ``greenhouse effect'' on Venus, where thick clouds trap
solar heat, warming the planet to 900 degrees.
   Sagan said Voyager also helps satisfy human wanderlust and seeks
to answer that most fundamental question _ ``where we come from, how
we fit into the grand cosmological scheme.''
   Voyager 2 keeps looking back at Neptune until Oct. 2. Then, like
Voyager 1, it will spend the next 20 or 30 years collecting
information about particles and magnetic fields in space and
searching for the edge of the solar system. Scientists figure the
probes can continue transmitting data until 2020.
