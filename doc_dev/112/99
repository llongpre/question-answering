   The countdown marched smoothly
Wednesday toward a second attempt to launch the shuttle Atlantis
with a crew of five and a space probe destined for Venus. NASA's
only worry was a worsening weather forecast.
   ``All in all, things look good for a 1:48 p.m. launch tomorrow
(Thursday) and the start of our trip to Venus,'' launch test
director Albert Sofge said of shuttle preparations.
   The weather outlook, however, was not the greatest, with
forecasters saying Wednesday afternoon there was a 40 percent
chance that either rain or high winds would prevent a launch during
the available 64-minute launch period. That was up from 30 percent
in the morning and 20 percent two days ago.
   The first launch attempt last Friday was aborted just 31 seconds
before the planned liftoff because of a short circuit in a fuel
pump. NASA said the delay cost about $300,000.
   The mission to take the Magellan spacecraft into orbit will
revive a U.S. planetary program that has been dormant since the
launch of Pioneer-Venus in 1978.
   ``After an 11-year gap in the planetary program, we're anxious
to get started,'' said John H. Gerpheide, project manager for
Magellan.
   Shuttle chief Richard Truly opened an afternoon news conference
with, ``Here we are again, and we're ready to fly again. We've
fixed our problems.
   ``The weather is not going to be as good as it was last Friday,
but it appears it will be good.''
   Air Force Capt. Thomas Strange, the shuttle meteorologist, said
``there is a 40 percent chance of a violation of weather
constraints.''
   He said the forecast called for a chance of rain showers. But of
more concern, he said, was the possibility of crosswinds of more
than 14 mph that could be dangerous if the shuttle had to make an
emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad.
   On Thursday, the shuttle must be launched by 2:52 p.m., the end
of a 64-minute ``launch window,'' in order to have Magellan in the
right position for a flight to Venus. If it isn't launched by May
28, Magellan will have to wait for two years before Earth and Venus
are in the right position again.
   Technicians working around the clock replaced the fuel pump and
a suspect fuel line in half the time expected, enabling NASA to
reschedule the launch for Thursday, at least a day earlier than
officials thought was possible.
   Engineers had thought there was a leak in the fuel line that was
replaced, but tests turned up nothing. They believe a vapor cloud
seen spewing from the line, thought at first to be gas, was trapped
water vapor.
   Sofge reported both new parts had been checked and certified for
flight and that the engine compartment had been closed up. The
launch team prepared to pump 528,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen and
liquid oxygen into Atlantis' external fuel tank early Thursday.
   The five astronauts reviewed flight plans and honed their flying
efficiency over central Florida in T-38 jet planes.
   ``This time we're going to see if we can get it right,'' said
David Walker, who will command the mission. ``We're extremely
pleased the folks here at the Cape were able to do such a good and
quick job getting it ready to go again.''
   The other crew members are pilot Ronald Grabe and mission
specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Norman Thagard.
   Cleave and Lee are to deploy Magellan from the shuttle's cargo
hold six hours after launch. An hour later a rocket will ignite to
propel it on its 15-month journey to Venus.
   Magellan has a radar system powerful enough to pierce the dense
sulfuric acid clouds shrouding Venus and map its surface. The
mission costs $550 million, not including the $225 million cost of
the four-day shuttle flight.
   Magellan's radar images should reveal details as small as 100
yards across, about the size of a football field. This is 10 times
sharper than previous pictures of the planet captured by two Soviet
craft in 1983.
