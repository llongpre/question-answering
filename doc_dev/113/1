   Brother fought brother and the North won
again Sunday as more than 8,000 uniformed men re-enacted the final
charge of the Battle of Gettysburg to commemorate its 125th
anniversary.
   Griff King of the 2nd Virginia Regiment planned to participate
in Pickett's charge against a line of Union troops, where his
brother would defend a ridge with the 93rd Pennsylvania Regiment.
   ``We don't agree on anything anyway,'' said King, a 35-year-old
machine operator from Weston, W.Va.
   About 12,500 mock soldiers and civilians in period garb took
part in the three-day re-enactment billed as the largest ever,
organizers said.
   Some 140,000 people witnessed the event over three days,
according to organizers with Napoleonic Tactics Inc., which staged
the battle on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the actual
battlefield.
   Following a series of cannon blasts by both sides, a 200-yard
line of Confederate troops gave a rebel yell and marched
shoulder-to-shoulder up to a wall defended by Union troops.
   Troops for the North and South traded volley after volley in an
engagement staged at one-third its original scale.
   ``It was a great battle,'' said John McQueen, a 37-year-old
marketing manager from Atlanta who repeatedly fired for the 52nd
Ohio Regiment as soldiers for both sides fell around him.
   ``The rifle barrels were getting so hot you couldn't touch
them,'' he said.
   Confederate troops fell back after an hour of fighting in the
re-enactment.
   The event ended with soldiers standing in silence for an
invocation to those who died in the actual battle. A bugler played
taps while 75 cannons fired one after another.
   As more than 60,000 people massed along a hillside Sunday to
witness the mock charge, a woman stood in 19th-century black
mourning dress to remind them of the consequences of war.
   ``Mourning is appropriate for battle because men die ... women
had to carry on,'' said Lanie Alligood, whose beau ``died'' during
fighting Saturday.
   Ms. Alligood, 34, of Atlanta, said she traveled with a group of
about 15 women from Georgia, most of whom dressed in black.
   The Battle of Gettysburg occurred July 1-3, 1863. Some 50,000
Union and Confederate troops were killed or wounded over the course
of the battle.
   Major Gen. George E. Pickett's unsuccessful charge with more
than 12,000 troops against 9,000 Union soldiers was the
Confederate's final offensive push of the Battle of Gettysburg.
   ``If the Battle of Gettysburg was the turning point of the Civil
War, then Pickett's charge was the turning point of the Battle of
Gettysburg,'' said Kim Holien, a historian with the U.S. Army
Center of Military History.
   King said he decided to join the Confederate army because he
believes in states' rights over the encroachment by the federal
government, a battle he said continues.
   ``The battlefield is the courtroom now,'' said King, as he
packed up his tent before the final charge.
