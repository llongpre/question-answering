<LEADPARA>  GETTYSBURG is under siege, and the struggle is as much over fallow fields as
hallowed ground.;    Spurred by the widening of a nearby highway and the
opening of a Wal-Mart to call its own, this historic town is witnessing
unprecedented pressure from developers, one of whom is proposing a
320,000-square-foot shopping center that would abut the Civil War battlefield.  </LEADPARA>

DEVELOPERS WANT TO BUILD BUT PRESERVATIONISTS
RESIST  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The plan has loosed volleys of displeasure not heard since the
Erector-set-like, 330-foot-tall National Tower observation platform was raised
nearly a score of years ago.;    Gettysburg Borough and the surrounding
townships have long been at odds over the nature and amount of development
that should be permitted, with some municipal officials contending that the
economy has suffered by attempts to keep the park setting pristine.;   
"There's an attitude toward the park here that's very negative -- even
defiant," said Richard H. Schmoyer, planning director for Adams County.;   
Proposed for a 75-acre site in adjacent Straban Township, Mark Development
Co.'s Gettysburg Commons features 25 to 30 stores, a cinema and 1,900 parking
spaces. It also falls partly within the 12,000-acre federally protected
Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District, which encompasses the 6,000-acre
Gettysburg National Military Park.;    As a result, Civil War buffs and
preservationists are left wondering whether Gen. George Pickett's charge will
be remembered as the final, bloodiest confrontation of the Civil War battle,
or thought of as a method of payment at the new department store.;    "We
cannot permit the visual desecration of one of the most hallowed sites in
America," said Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., co-sponsor of 1990 legislation
that significantly expanded the boundaries of the military park. "There are
plenty of places in which to build shopping centers, but allowing one to be
built within sight of the Gettysburg battlefield would be a tragic mistake."; 
  At issue is the view of the battlefield and the town from Benner's Hill, a
crown of land that, while not a major overlook, affords a vista that hasn't
changed much in 118 years. In the fields below, Union forces won a decisive
victory over Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederates in a series of battles July
1-4, 1863.;    "If they build where they say," said Assistant Park
Superintendent Robert E. Davidson, "the shopping center would come into view
very dramatically.";    Keep view open;  Walter L. Powell, Gettysburg
Borough's preservation officer, said: "That view is critical. It is part of
the historic view shed that should be kept as open as possible.";    Others
see the proposal differently, including county planning director Schmoyer, who
has said the shopping center "would not be the worst thing that could happen
there.";    "There is a history of discouraging growth here, and a price has
been paid for it," he said.;    In 1989, Adams County ranked 59th out of
Pennsylvania's 67 counties in average annual wages, far below the other
counties in the eastern half of the state. Many service workers live in mobile
home parks surrounding the borough.;    Three years ago, when Schmoyer
arrived, he warned that when widening of U.S. Route 15 near Gettysburg was
completed, there would be massive development pressure at the four local
interchanges.;    Taken seriously now;  "Few took him seriously then,"
preservation officer Powell said. "They do now.";    Now, with Route 15
serving as a major four-lane highway between Harrisburg and Frederick, Md.,
the Gettysburg area has become attractive as a bedroom community for those
cities, as well as Baltimore and even Washington, 90 driving minutes away.;   
Wal-Mart, the mammoth discount chain, cited the highway and proximity to
Maryland's market among reasons for building in Straban Township.;    Now
property owners are keen with anticipation over Wal-Mart's legendary drawing
power for shoppers -- and developers.;    Mother of all museums;  Dusan
Bratic, a Carlisle lawyer who owns 105 acres at a Route 15 interchange, has
proposed building a kind of mother of all war museums, honoring Americans who
have fought in conflicts beginning with World War I.;    Bratic would not
reveal other plans he might have for his property, except to say he was
bullish on something being done to help the local economy.;    "People these
days are looking for more than Gettysburg has to offer," he said. "The
historic stuff is fine, but people want something to do at night.";   
Although Adams County last year imposed an interchange zoning ordinance along
the three Straban interchanges, it was too late to prevent Route 30, a key
entryway to the borough and battlefield, from becoming a homogenized,
stripped-out melange of 20th-century motel and fast-food culture.;    Are we
in Texas?; "The real tragedy of that strip is that you could be in Waco,
Texas, as easily as Adams County," Powell said.;    Preservationists are still
smarting over the Wal-Mart site, parking for which required knocking down a
two-story Greek Revival-style brick farmhouse, circa 1840, that was used as a
field hospital during the battle.;    The farmhouse was supplanted, circa
1991, by Wendy's.;    "We don't want the National Park Service to come off as
being anti-development; that's not a realistic stand to take," Davidson said
in his office across from the National Cemetery. "We'd like to play a role in
seeing that the development is sensitive to the historical resources."  </TEXT>
