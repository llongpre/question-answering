   The editor of Gettysburg College's
literary magazine rejected a federal arts grant Friday, saying he
believes restrictions placed on the money violate the right to
freedom of expression.
   Peter Stitt, editor of the Gettysburg Review, said new
stipulations banning ``obscene or meritless'' art result in prior
restraint.
   The stipulations were added to the National Endowment of the
Arts grants last year after a furor over federal funding of an
exhibit by Robert Mapplethorpe. Some of the photos had homoxesexual
themes. The changes have brought widespread protests from artists
and their supporters.
   The Gettysburg Review publishes poetry, fiction and non-fiction
articles. It has never published anything considered obscene, Stitt
said.
   ``My decision should not be construed as support for
obscenity,'' he said. ``But, I cannot see any way for us to
determine what the endowment considers obscene unless we submit the
materials that we wish to publish to the endowment for review prior
to the publication.''
   Submitting marterial for approval, an action that could result
in prior restraint, contradicts the First Amendment right to
freedom of expression, he said.
   The NEA does not have a procedure for checking up on the
thousands of photographers, dancers, urban designers, painters and
other artists who receive federal grants each year.
   The journal received a $4,550 grant to increase its advertising
budget. Stitt said the publication had asked for the grant before
the new regulations were enacted last fall.
   Under the regulations, grant recipients were asked to swear off
art that included ``depictions of sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the
sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts
and which, when taken as a whole, do not have serious literary,
artistic, political or scientific merit.''
   All of the more than 4,000 grant recipients this year were asked
to sign letters promising to comply with federal guidelines.
   At least two artists have declined to accept NEA grants because
of the restrictions.
   Theater producer Joseph Papp refused a $50,000 grant and dance
choreographer Bella Lewitzky declined $72,000.
   The New School for Social Research, which received a $45,000
grant to build a sculpture garden at its New York City campus,
filed a lawsuit in May, saying the guidelines were
unconstitutional. The lawsuit has not been settled.
   Congress currently is considering an Bush administration
proposal to extend the NEA program for five years without any
restrictions.
   The proposal, scheduled to be considered on the House floor in
mid-July, could face amendments that would add restrictions or
guidelines for grants, House leaders have said.
