   Re-enactments staged on the great
battlefields of the Civil War usually end the same way _ with boys
in blue routing the Confederate gray.
   But not so in Mississippi this summer.
   At Vicksburg, cannons will boom and muskets flash over the Fourth
of July weekend to commemorate a clear-cut Confederate victory over
Yankee troops when Gen. Ulysses S. Grant made his first major
attempt to silence the Mississippi River fortress 126 years ago.
   And at Brice's Cross Roads in Lee County, scene of a textbook
attack by Confederate Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest's cavalry,
historians recently replaced 99 markers to unknown Southern dead
with 102 stones bearing the names of Rebel soldiers known to have
been killed in the June 10, 1864, battle.
   The Vicksburg artillery demonstrations and engagements by several
hundred re-enactors will take place Saturday and Sunday on private
land in Vicksburg where the actual engagement being commemorated
occurred on May 22, 1863.
   Grant's all-out attack was beaten back by the Vicksburg garrison
during a one-day battle that resulted in 3,000 Union soldiers killed
or wounded. The Confederates suffered about 500 casualties.
   Realizing a direct attack would be too costly, Grant encircled
the city on land and water, starving the garrison into surrender 47
days later on July 4, 1863.
   ``Last year was the first year we had a re-enactment at Vicksburg
and, since it was the 125th anniversary of the siege, we felt it
only appropriate to do the last few days of it, including the
surrender,'' said Gordon Cotton, director of the Old Court House
Museum and organizer of the ``Vicksburg Civil War Re-enactment.''
   ``We did not realize when we planned last year's event that
re-living those days would be so emotionally straining on everyone
here,'' said Cotton.
   ``This year, the re-enactors wanted to do something different,
something very dramatic and we didn't want to go through another
defeat,'' he said. ``So this battle was the obvious choice.''
   Across the state in Lee County, history buff Charles Sullivan and
his associates found another way to remember a Confederate victory.
   ``Up to this point, all the battlefields I have marked were of
Confederate defeats,'' said Sullivan, a department head at
Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College's Perkinston campus and
Confederate graves registrar in Mississippi for the Sons of
Confederate Veterans. ``This time it was different.''
   At the Brice's Cross Roads battlefield, about six miles west of
Baldwyn, Forrest won a major tactical victory over Gen. S.D.
Sturgis' larger Union force. When the fighting ended, over 1,500
Union soldiers had been captured.
   ``For Forrest, it was a textbook battle that has been studied at
war colleges around the world,'' said Sullivan, who will participate
in the re-enactment at Vicksburg. ``Many believe this was his
greatest victory for, heavily outnumbered, he was able to destroy
the federal cavalry first and then the infantry.''
   Sullivan said the markers to the unknown dead were placed at the
battle site sometime after 1930, following passage of a federal law
allowing military stones for fallen Confederates.
   ``Thanks to the research of a friend named Roger Hansen, who has
a network of colleagues throughout the country who trade information
on Confederate dead, we were able to identify 102 men killed at the
crossroads on the Confederate side.''
   Sullivan said the new markers were arranged in alphabetical order
``because we know they were placed in a burial pit but we do not
know exactly where each body was situated.''
