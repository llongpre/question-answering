<LEADPARA>  THE overwhelming success of the "Civil War" television series on PBS last
winter has heightened interest in visiting Civil War battle sites.

place guard their heritage zealously, and both public and private
organizations are well equipped to help a traveler relive events that took
place more than a century ago.;    What follows is a state-by-state list of
those groups that can assist in fashioning a visit to Civil War battlefields
and related areas.  </LEADPARA>
