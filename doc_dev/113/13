<LEADPARA>  When Lauren Cook dons her Confederate soldier's uniform and lines up for
battle, she sometimes almost feels she has traveled back to the Civil War.;   
But while many U.S. women are serving in the Persian Gulf, Cook says some
national parks won't let her join "living history" portrayals of Civil War
battles because she is female.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's illegal, and it's a matter of principle," said Cook, who filed a
federal lawsuit this month asking that the Interior Department be ordered to
let women join Civil War events at national parks.;    It's exciting to carry
a musket and simulate Civil War battles, said Cook, who works as a spokeswoman
for the George Mason University law school in Arlington, Va.;    "You get what
we call a 'period rush,' " she said. "There are times . . . when you
absolutely feel like you're time-traveling -- when you're actually out there
marching along and there are no 20th-century intrusions at all.";    Cook and
her husband, Fred Burgess, spend most weekends involved in Civil War events.
They even had a Civil War-era wedding last fall at Gettysburg, asking all
guests to dress in period costume.;    The National Park Service doesn't allow
actual battle re-enactments, instead holding "living history" portrayals such
as camp-outs and marching and firing drills, where the public can talk to the
"soldiers." Battle re-enactments are held on state and private land.;   
Although Cook works hard to impersonate a man -- binding her chest, wearing
her hair short and talking with a husky voice -- one park official says that
isn't good enough.;    The programs at Antietam National Battlefield in
Sharpsburg, Md., are intended to reflect what actually happened during the
Sept. 17, 1862, battle, park Superintendent Richard Rambur said.;    "If
you're going to portray anything here at Antietam, you have to portray an
accurate picture," he said.;    The park also restricts children from
portraying soldiers, he said, adding that while some children may have fought
at Antietam, "it does not portray the norm, and that's what we do here.";   
More than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed, wounded or
reported missing at Antietam. The park holds about a dozen weekend events a
year to portray different facets of the battle.;    But those aren't the roles
Cook has trained to portray. As a member of the 21st Georgia volunteer
infantry and two other Civil War organizations, she's learned to play the fife
and has studied military tactics.;    "I think I do a far better job than a
lot of the men out there," she said.;    Some national parks have allowed Cook
and other women to march and join firing drills as male soldiers. But she was
barred from participating at Antietam, and stayed away from an event at
Harpers Ferry National Park in West Virginia after being told she wouldn't be
included.;    At a re-enactment last year of the surrender at Appomattox, she
successfully passed herself off as a man.;    Her lawyer, Clint Bolick,
describes the U.S. District Court lawsuit as "a straightforward sex
discrimination case." No hearing date has been set for the suit.  </TEXT>
