   No black soldiers fought at the Battle of
Franklin, but 125 years later black Civil War re-enactors are
reminding their fellow history buffs of the contributions
African-Americans made in the war.
   A re-enactment of the 1864 battle Sunday capped a weekend of
events to mark the 125th anniversary of the fight. In it
Confederate Gen. John Bell Hood lost more than 6,000 soldiers,
crippling the South's second-biggest force, the Army of Tennessee.
   The recreation attracted an estimated 4,000 re-enactors from
around the country. Similar battles will lead up to the 125th
anniversary of the surrender at Appomattox on April 9.
   The recreations feature lines of ``soldiers'' firing replica
weapons, booming cannon and cavalry charges. ``Casualties'' fall to
the ground, though there are rules: Don't fall with a loaded weapon
or with a bayonet.
   In one of the few deviations allowed from the historical record,
the Union forces at a field about 20 miles south of Nashville this
weekend included about two dozen black re-enactors representing the
54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry.
   Gregory Urwin, a history professor at the University of Central
Arkansas in Conway and leader of the 54th, said about 180,000 black
soldiers fought in the Civil War.
   They were allowed to join in 1863 after the Emancipation
Proclamation and eventually made up 10 percent of the Union army.
   ``There was an initial reluctance, a fear of a backlash, that
white Northerners would fight to preserve the union but not to end
slavery,'' said Urwin. ``And there was a fear that Southerners
would fight twice as hard if blacks were armed against them.''
   Black soldiers served with distinction in the Battle of
Nashville, where they helped lead one of the attacks that allowed
Union troops to turn the Confederates back. They were also active
in the siege of Petersburg, Va., and several divisions were among
the Union units that helped stop Gen. Robert E. Lee's retreat at
Appomattox.
   ``The first black units that were raised performed well in
combat. And by that point in the war, heavy losses and frequent
defeats made more Northerners willing to accept any kind of extra
manpower,'' Urwin said.
   Black participation in the war was used to justify the passage
of the 14th Amendment, making them citizens, and the 15th, which
gave them the right to vote.
   ``Without those Constitutional weapons there would have been no
civil rights movement in our own time,'' said Urwin. ``So, in a
sense, the black troops of the Civil War were the pioneers in the
revolution in race relations that we've lived through the past 25
or 30 years.''
   Urwin said the Franklin recreation is a good chance for his
group to remind history buffs of the contribution of black soldiers.
   ``It's a chance, finally, 125 years after, for black and white
Americans to get together and celebrate their common heritage of
valor.''
   The re-enactors have a passion for accuracy in their portrayals,
wearing authentic wool uniforms and camping out without sleeping
bags, as did soldiers of the period.
   Urwin, 34, had no ancestors in the war but has an interest that
goes beyond the scholarship of his military history interest.
   ``I get the chill like everybody else,'' he said. ``There are
certain moments, like when twilight is falling over the camp and
the spectators have departed.
   ``You look and all you see is the 19th century: sentinels are
marching their beats, people are beginning to light their
campfires. That's one moment when you can almost fool yourself into
thinking that you're back in time.''
