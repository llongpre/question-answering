   The wounds from the Civil War have not
yet healed, according to retired Gen. William C. Westmoreland, who
commanded U.S. troops in Vietnam and whose relatives fought for the
Confederate Army.
   Westmoreland, speaking Monday in a Memorial Day ceremony at
Gettysburg National Cemetery, said the three-day Battle of
Gettysburg and other confrontations in the Civil War played a
crucial role in the evolution of the United States.
   ``A nation is never fully formed,'' Westmoreland told about
1,000 spectators in the cemetery where President Abraham Lincoln
delivered his famed ``Gettysburg Address'' in 1863.
   Lincoln sought unity and equality, Westmoreland said. He added
that while the states remain united, ``We have not made a
completely equal opportunity available to all.''
   ``Perhaps the most serious failure in our nation-building effort
has been the fate of our land's original inhabitants, the
Indians,'' he said.
   But, he said, many wounds have healed since Union and
Confederate troops fought here in what many historians consider the
decisive battle of the Civil War.
   ``America, as we know it today, is a vibrant national entity ...
I believe Lincoln would be pleased with the American nation of
1988,'' Westmoreland said, standing near a monument marking the
spot where Lincoln dedicated the cemetery nearly five months after
the fighting ended with Confederate troops retreating from northern
soil.
