   Ken Burns sprinted up a Gettysburg slope in
the footsteps of Gen. Pickett's screaming Confederates and burst
into tears after climbing the hilltop wall that was the high-water
mark of the Confederacy.
   He mourned the deaths of ``friends'' ranging from Abraham
Lincoln to ordinary soldiers who dropped on battlefields 125 years
ago. And he was kept awake by the deafening sounds and vivid images
of Americans killing Americans.
   After 5{ years of work, the award-winning filmmaker is bringing
the sights, sounds, words and emotions of the Civil War into
millions of living rooms in a landmark public television
miniseries.
   ``We've made a film that has attempted to tell the whole story
and acknowledge that it is as dramatic as Hollywood or anyone could
dream up,'' Burns said. ``The Civil War,'' an 11-hour documentary,
will be broadcast on five nights beginning Sunday.
   The boyish-looking 37-year-old said emotions are the key to his
work and to seeing the war, in which 620,000 Americans died, in a
new light.
   ``We were constantly made aware of how poignant this story was,
how tragic it was,'' he said in his hilltop editing studio in
southwestern New Hampshire. ``The depth and profundity of that
emotion is what affected me more than anything else.''
   Burns tapped the emotions by peering into the innermost thoughts
of his subjects, from Presidents Lincoln and Jefferson Davis to
ordinary soldiers who died in the mud. Their diaries and letters to
loved ones are the script.
   ``We get to know two dozen people so intimately that we had to
take one of the final half hours of the film to consider their
fates,'' he said.
   ``To have met this man, Abraham Lincoln, and gotten to know him,
I consider one of the great honors of my life. To have met Robert
E. Lee and Ulysses S. Grant and countless minor soldiers who could
write and speak and fight - and kill and die - has been the
greatest thing.''
   Burns traversed the country seeking information. For
authenticity, he filmed at battlefields on the anniversaries of the
fighting.
   At times he had to stop.
   ``I would dream so vividly about the battles, that it was too
much,'' he said.
   At Gettysburg, where Lee brought his army as far north as it
would get, and where George Pickett led his doomed charge, emotions
overcame him.
   ``I ran the last several hundred yards of Pickett's charge and
went up and over the wall and burst into tears with the sense of
this being the most important moment,'' he said.
   Burns hopes his series will strip away the ``gallant, bloodless
myth'' of the Civil War and show that television can entertain and
inform at the same time.
   His cinematography brings still photographs alive, dragging
viewers along as frightened soldiers feel their way forward looking
for the enemy. In Gettsyburg and Antietam battle scenes, his
zooming, cutting and panning move viewers through a kaleidoscope of
sights toward victory, death or panicked retreat.
   Burns studied and recorded sounds of the birds and insects the
soldiers would have heard, and just how it sounded when 200 cannons
fired at the same time.
   If the images are powerful, the words cut even more deeply.
Rather than use actors, as most documentary filmmakers do, Burns
uses only their voices.
   Here is part of a soldier's letter home after the second battle
of Bull Run: ``Sunday, a soldier in Company A died and was buried.
Everything went on as if nothing had happened, for death is so
common that little sentiment is wasted. It is not like death at
home.''
   History has long been a fascination for Burns in his filmmaking.
His first two documentaries, ``The Brooklyn Bridge'' (1981) and
``Statue of Liberty'' (1985), were both nominated for Academy
Awards. ``The Brooklyn Bridge'' and 1985's ``Huey Long'' won the
Eric Barnouw Prize for historical films.
   The American Film Festival awarded its Blue Ribbon to ``The
Statue of Liberty,'' ``Thomas Hart Benton'' (1988), ``The Brooklyn
Bridge'' and 1984's ``The Shakers: Hands to Work, Hearts to God.''
   Burns, who studied at Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., also
did the documentary ``The Congress.''
   The filmmaker is overwhelmed that PBS, for the first time, is
pitting a miniseries against the commercial networks' new fall
shows. The decision is more remarkable because television
essentially abandoned documentaries 20 years ago, he said.
   The commitment to a lengthy and complex prime-time documentary
is particularly rewarding when much of television has been reduced
to 30-second glimpses and rock videos.
   ``We have to first admit that television is where our children
are getting most of their information,'' he said. ``If you lament
this and merely abdicate it to those who promote its baser
instincts, we've lost the battle.''
   The battle metaphor is no accident.
   ``We are in the front lines attempting to remind people that
television can be used in an honorable, as well as entertaining and
nutritional way, and that's what this series is,'' Burns said.
