<LEADPARA>  When Lauren Cook dons her Confederate soldier's uniform and lines up for
battle, she sometimes almost feels she has traveled back to the Civil War.;   
But while many U.S. women are serving in the Persian Gulf, Cook says some
national parks won't let her join "living history" portrayals of Civil War
battles because she is female.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's illegal, and it's a matter of principle," said Cook, who filed a
federal lawsuit this month asking that the Interior Department be ordered to
let women join Civil War events at national parks.;    It's exciting to carry
a musket and simulate Civil War battles, said Cook, who works as a spokeswoman
for the George Mason University law school in Arlington, Va.;    "You get what
we call a 'period rush,' " she said. "There are times . . . when you
absolutely feel like you're time-traveling -- when you're actually out there
marching along and there are no 20th-century intrusions at all.";    Cook and
her husband, Fred Burgess, spend most weekends involved in Civil War events.
They even had a Civil War-era wedding last fall at Gettysburg, asking all
guests to dress in period costume.;    The National Park Service doesn't allow
actual battle re-enactments, instead holding "living history" portrayals such
as camp-outs and marching and firing drills, where the public can talk to the
"soldiers." Battle re-enactments are held on state and private land.;   
Although Cook works hard to impersonate a man -- binding her chest, wearing
her hair short and talking with a husky voice -- one park official says that
isn't good enough.;    The programs at Antietam National Battlefield in
Sharpsburg, Md., are intended to reflect what actually happened during the
Sept. 17, 1862, battle, park Superintendent Richard Rambur said.;    "If
you're going to portray anything here at Antietam you have to portray an
accurate picture," he said.  </TEXT>
