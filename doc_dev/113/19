   ``Welcome To Historic Appomattox, Where
Our Nation Reunited.''
   Other than the wooden sign at the side of the highway, Harry
Lillie's Civil War souvenir and relic shop adjoining the Lee-Grant
Motel is the only reminder of what happened two miles outside town
on April 9, 1865.
   In the Victorian parlor of a private home, with the
Confederacy's main army surrounded and starving, Gen. Robert E. Lee
surrendered to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, ending, for all intents and
purposes, the War Between the States.
   On the muddy main road of the tiny village of Appomattox Court
House three days later, exactly four years after the war started at
Fort Sumter, S.C., Confederate Gen. John Gordon marched his 28,231
ragged, emaciated troops one last time.
   As Union troops from the 100,000-strong Army of the Potomac
lined the muddy road, the Rebels stacked their guns, hung their
ammunition pouches on the sights, furled their Confederate battle
flags and began the long trek home.
   In a re-enactment commemorating the 125th anniversary Sunday,
the solemn sound of soldiers marching again will be broken by the
crisp order ``Stack ... arms.'' But the skirmishes will be
re-enacted 150 miles away in Fredericksburg.
   Neither local residents nor the National Park Service, which
operates the Appomattox Court House National Historical Park,
wanted to restage the battles.
   Lillie, a well-meaning carpetbagger from New Jersey, is
perplexed by what he considers residents' apathy about the role
their county played in American history.
   ``Appomattox was big enough to handle the actual battles and
surrender, but is not big enough to handle the re-enacted battles.
That ought to tell you something,'' he said.
   About 110,000 people visit Appomattox Court House annually, but
few tarry because Appomattox has only two small hotels and few
places to eat, said Jon Montgomery, the park superintendent.
   In 1865, there were 8,900 residents. Now there are about 12,800.
A publicity pamphlet issued by the chamber of commerce describes
Appomattox as ``an old-fashioned town where progress is slow and
measured.''
   But a chain hotel now is under construction across the street
from Lillie's, and a shopping center, Historic Junction, recently
was completed. Fast-food restaurants beckon on the main highway,
and there are plans to lure more people into the main part of town,
with its freshly painted, century-old wooden homes and stores.
   Montgomery and Mayor Ronnie Spiggle said it takes a sense of
history to understand the reluctance over the years to
commercialize the park and the decision this year to ignore the
battles that took place 125 years ago.
   Spiggle agrees with the shrine-like treatment of the park, which
continues to be surrounded by miles of undeveloped pastures and
looks nearly identical to what the soldiers saw in 1865.
   ``We don't want to emphasize the battles. They were
insignificant compared to other battles of the war,'' Montgomery
said. ``The story here is the peace that came here.''
   After the war, Southern opposition to a park at Appomattox kept
the federal government from establishing one for 75 years. A new
highway skirted the deteriorating village. Buildings disintegrated
and burned. Some were torn down.
   In 1940, the National Park Service acquired the land for the
park, and the main buildings of the village eventually were
restored or reconstructed in time for the 100th anniversary of the
surrender.
   The 10 historic structures, most red brick surround by
split-rail or white picket fences, include the McLean House, where
the terms of surrender were signed, the courthouse, a tavern, a
jail, a general store, a tiny law office and several residences.
   ``The southerners wanted to forget what happened here,''
Montgomery said. ``It marked the end of their hopes of having a
separate country.''
