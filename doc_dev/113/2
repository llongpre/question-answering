   Americans will gather to remember the
greatest battle of the Civil War, where thousands of men in blue
and gray ``gave the last full measure of devotion'' 125 years ago
this summer.
   A 4{-month commemoration of the 125th anniversary of the Battle
of Gettysburg begins Monday with a Memorial Day parade and a
ceremony in the national cemetery.
   Gen. William Westmoreland, who commanded U.S. troops in Vietnam,
will speak at the cemetery services following the parade.
   Other highlights of the anniversary include a re-enactment of
key clashes in the three-day battle, set for June 24-26; a July 2
exchange of battle flags by governors of some states that
participated in the fighting; relighting of the Eternal Peace Light
Memorial on July 3; and re-creation of President Abraham Lincoln's
Gettysburg Address on the 125th anniversary of the speech, Nov. 19.
   National Park Service officials expect the events will draw
record-breaking crowds to the south-central Pennsylvania
battlefield, now a national park, where Union troops forced the
Confederate Army to retreat from northern soil after three days of
bitter, bloody fighting July 1-3, 1863.
   Many historians view the battle as the decisive event in the
war. In all, nearly 50,000 Union and Confederate troops were killed
or wounded after Gen. Robert E. Lee invaded the North.
   After clashing with Yankees at Harrisburg and Chambersburg,
Lee's troops met Union forces under Gen. George G. Meade west of
Gettysburg on July 1. The climax of the battle came July 3 when Lee
ordered Gen. George E. Pickett's division forward. ``Pickett's
Charge'' proved to be a disaster, and Lee withdrew.
   That November, Lincoln made his celebrated speech when he came
to Gettysburg to help dedicate the cemetery there.
   ``Fourscore and seven years ago, our fathers brought fourth on
this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to
the proposition tha all men are created equal,'' Lincoln said.
   He called on his listeners to rededicate themselves to the cause
for which the soldiers gave their lives _ ``the last full measure
of devotion'' _ so that ``government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth.''
   In an average year, 1.4 million visitors tour the battlefield.
This year, officials say, 2 million or more could come to town.
   ``It's going to be a little problem, but we've handled this
before,'' said Mayor Frank Linn.
   During the re-enactment, thousands of Civil War buffs will
participate in a scaled-down version of the fighting at a farm
outside of town. Park Service rules prohibit a re-enactment on the
actual battlefield.
   The peace light memorial that is to be rededicated July 3 was
dedicated in 1938 by President Franklin Roosevelt. Members of the
anniversary commission hope to relight a natural-gas flame that
burned at the monument until 1975, when rising oil prices prompted
federal officials to convert the flame to an electric light. Money
from private donors was raised to pay for the fuel and to repair
the gas lines.
   Astronomer Carl Sagan is scheduled to speak at the relighting
ceremony. President Reagan has also been invited, but has not yet
said if he will attend.
   U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist is scheduled to be keynote
speaker at the Gettysburg Address re-enactment in November. A man
dressed as Lincoln will re-create the actual speech.
