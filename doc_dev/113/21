   A horse-drawn cart draped in black
transported the partial remains of four Union soldiers to their
final resting place in a funeral marking the Battle of Antietam's
127th anniversary.
   About 85 men dressed in Civil War uniforms gave full military
honors Sunday to the four fallen members of the Irish Brigade from
New York whose bones were found in March 1988 by relic hunters in a
field near the battleground.
   ``Re-enactors normally re-enact history, but today we are making
history,'' said 38-year-old Collin MacDonald, who served as
commander for the reburial.
   He said it was the western Maryland park's first Civil War burial
this century.
   An estimated 450 people watched the funeral that began shortly
before noon at the 11-acre Antietam National Cemetery near
Sharpsburg where the remains of nearly 4,700 soldiers are buried.
   ``I've done re-enactments, but to see it for real just sent
shivers up and down my spine,'' said Blake Magner, 39, of Westmont,
N.J.
   More than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were killed,
wounded or missing after the battle, which ended Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee's two attempts to push the war northward. The battle
is described as the single bloodiest day of the war.
   The remains of the four soldiers were sealed in a canister inside
a plain, pine coffin that was lowered into the ground near the
graves of other Irish Brigade soldiers.
   They were with regiments that charged the Confederate line Sept.
17, 1862, and were killed by rifle fire. Researchers speculated that
the men's skulls and leg and arm bones were removed from the
battleground in 1865 or 1866 under a federal program to re-inter
Union dead at the cemetery. The rest of their bodies remained
untouched until March 1988 when they were found by a group using
metal detectors.
   ``We brought the remains home, but it bothered us that we had
human remains,'' said Dave Bebenroth, an elementary school teacher
from Strongsville, Ohio, who was with the group that discovered the
remains.
   About a month after the discovery, they decided to turn the
remains over to the National Park Service, which manages Antietam
National Battlefield.
   Douglas Owsley, a forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History, determined that two of the
soldiers were in their 20s, one was in his 30s and the other was
about 45 years old.
   Earlier in the day, the re-enactors representing the 28th
Massachusetts and the 93rd Pennsylvania regiments gathered for a
Roman Catholic Mass at ``Bloody Lane,'' a sunken road in the middle
of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for nearly four
hours that day.
   After the Mass, the soldiers marched a mile from Bloody Lane to
the cemetery where two buglers played ``Taps.'' The remains were
buried with a clump of turf and a rock from Ireland.
