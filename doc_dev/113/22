   The battle lines are drawn again at Antietam,
the scene of some of the bloodiest fighting of the Civil War, as
preservationists seek to protect the area from encroaching
development. This time neighbor is pitted against neighbor with the
National Park Service in the middle, a scenario that's also being
played out at other historic sites around the country.

   Once again, Millard Kefauver's 280-acre
dairy farm is in the line of fire.
   Kefauver's great-grandfather farmed the same land when Union and
Confederate soldiers surged across the rolling western Maryland
landscape on Sept. 17, 1862, in the bloodiest single day of
fighting of the Civil War.
   Now Kefauver and his family are swept up in a struggle over
efforts to protect the Antietam National Battlefield Park from
encroaching development.
   It is typical of many struggles being fought out as the great
cities of America extend their suburbs into the once-quiet
countryside.
   ``Battles were fought near areas that had strategic importance
then and, since they had strategic importance then, they would have
growth potential now,'' says Edwin Bearss, chief historian of the
National Park Service and a specialist on the Civil War.
   The National Trust for Historic Preservation says Cedar Creek
Battlefield and Belle Grove Plantation at Middletown, Va., where
Union General Phil Sheridan handed the Confederacy one of its final
stunning blows by winning control of the Shenandoah Valley in 1864,
could be surrounded by eight 10-acre industrial parks.
   In 1988, Congress authorized acquisition of Stuart's Hill at
Manassas, Va., stopping plans for a 1.2 million-square-foot
shopping mall on land where the Blue and the Gray fought two
crucial battles. Just last year, Congress stepped in again and
approved expansion of Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National
Military Park in Virginia.
   It is not just Civil War battlefields that are threatened,
preservationists say. The National Trust has a list of what it
calls the 11 most endangered historic places, including sites
associated with Columbus' landing in the Virgin Islands, the
rivalry of Spain and England for control of the Georgia and South
Carolina coasts early in the 18th century, and 19th century gold
and silver strikes in South Dakota.
   Preservationists are far from united on how to deal with the
situation.
   ``One view is that the only way to protect a park and the only
way to be truly fair to landowners is to have the federal
government purchase the property,'' says Bruce Craig of the
National Parks and Conservation Association.
   That approach got a boost as long ago as the 1890s, when
Congress established Gettysburg National Military Park in
Pennsylvania, blocking Gettysburg Electric Railway Co. from
building a development around Big Round Top, a vital point of
ground in the engagement that marked the high-water mark of
Confederate fortunes.
   The railroad sued, saying Congress didn't have the power to
acquire land for commemorative purposes. The Supreme Court, in a
unanimous opinion in 1896, replied, ``Such a use seems ... not only
a public use, but one so closely connected with the welfare of the
Republic itself as to be within the powers granted the Congress by
the Constitution for the purpose of protecting and preserving the
whole country.''
   The trouble is that protecting and preserving the whole country
can be costly.
   In the Manassas case, for example, the purchase price was left
to future negotiation, and hasn't been settled yet.
   ``What the lands will ultimately cost the taxpayer no one
knows,'' says Bearss, the Park Service historian.
   In addition, says Craig of the Parks and Conservation
Association, ``There is sometimes a community hesitation and a
suspicion of what the federal government is likely to do with that
property.''
   There sure is.
   ``I can never be satisfied with anything the Park Service
does,'' says Russell Weaver of Sharpsburg, president of Save
Historic Antietam with Responsible Policies (SHARP), one of two
rival citizens' groups that have sprung up around the battlefield.
   Tom Clemens, president of the Save Historic Antietam Foundation
(SHAF), says, ``There are still people in Sharpsburg who would just
like the whole battlefield and the National Park Service to go
away, and that isn't going to happen.''
   The latest fracas was touched off in 1985 when the zoning
commission approved a rezoning that paved the way for construction,
expected soon, of a shopping center next door to the privately
owned Grove Farm, where President Abraham Lincoln met with Union
Gen. George B. McClellan after the battle in which the forces of
McClellan and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee fought to a virtual
draw and left 23,000 killed, wounded or missing. It will be the
first shopping center in this town of 800, which now has not a
single fast-food franchise.
