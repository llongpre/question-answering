   About 4,000 volunteers dressed as Union
and Confederate soldiers Sunday marked the 125th anniversary of the
end of the Civil War by recreating the solemn surrender of Gen.
Robert E. Lee's troops.
   Nearly 8,000 spectators, some wearing bonnets and hoopskirts
from 1865, stood behind wooden fences along the old stage road
through Appomattox Court House National Historic Park.
   There was scattered applause and a few rebel yells as a man
playing Confederate Gen. John Gordon rode a stocky chestnut horse
in front of a column of rebel soldiers marching four abreast
between Union troops with shouldered arms.
   After Appomattox, more than a month went by before the remaining
Confederate armies surrendered and a few isolated forces west of
the Mississippi River laid down their arms. But historians agree
that Lee's surrender to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant ended the War Between
the States for all intents and purposes.
   The re-enactment took place in the isolated, reconstructed
central Virginia village where the war ended after four devastating
years. Most of the volunteers playing rebel and Union men in
uniform were grim.
   ``It's a solemn occasion,'' said Joe Pitts of Winston-Salem,
N.C. ``We don't particularly care for it, and the troops back then
didn't care for it.''
   One young Confederate wept as he stacked his rifle in one of the
teepee-style piles along the dirt road winding through the region's
rolling hills.
   ``You get into what the soldiers felt back then,'' said Lake Day
of Jacksonville, Fla. ``To subject yourself to surrender is tough.''
   The volunteers said they were saddened this was the last major
re-enactment of the anniversary battles they have recreated during
the past four years. A few said they planned to quit the expensive
hobby after this.
   The re-enactors ranged in age from pre-teens to septuagenarians,
and came from across the United States, Canada and Europe.
   Pitts said they tried to depict the surrender at Appomattox
exactly as the ragged, starving soldiers went through it.
   ``It can't be totally correct; we can't be emaciated like they
were,'' he said.
   The re-enactment also was a few days off, and the sky was blue
rather than gray.
   The stacking of arms came on April 12, 1865, exactly four years
after the war started at Fort Sumter, S.C., and three days after
Lee surrendered to Gen. Grant at a private home on the edge of the
village. Lee's surrender was not re-enacted.
   Terry Daley of Baltimore, who played Union Gen. Joshua
Chamberlain, said his order for his men to present arms as 27,800
Confederate soldiers surrendered, ``helped heal our wounds.''
   ``At the sound of a bugle, Chamberlain paid the highest tribute
you can to an adversary; it was to show we are brothers and
Americans,'' Daley said.
