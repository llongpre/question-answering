   The remains of four Union soldiers were
reburied at the Antietam National Battlefield on Sunday, the 127th
anniversary of an 1862 Civil War bloodbath.
   Relic seekers from Ohio discovered the remains of the front-line
soldiers in March 1988, and anthropologists and archaeologists have
been studying them since.
   On Sunday, the remains were sealed inside a plain, pine coffin
and buried with full military honors at Antietam National Cemetery.
   An estimated 450 people watched the Civil War funeral at the
11-acre hilltop cemetery near Sharpsburg, where the remains of
nearly 4,700 soldiers are buried.
   The four soldiers found were members of the Irish Brigade from
New York, which charged the Confederate line Sept. 17, 1862, and
were killed by rifle fire.
   They were among more than 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers
who were killed, wounded or missing after the Battle of Antietam,
which climaxed Gen. Robert E. Lee's two attempts to push the war
farther north. The battle is described as the single bloodiest day
of the war.
   ``The massive number of dead in the battle made the interment
paramount,'' said Dennis Frye, a historian with the National Park
Service. ``They did not have time to properly bury individuals with
independent memorial services.''
   Douglas Owsley, a forensic anthropologist at the Smithsonian
Institution's Museum of Natural History, determined that two of the
fallen soldiers were in their 20s, one was in his 30s and the other
was about 45 years old. ``The older fellow had arthritis in his
shoulder bones,'' he said.
   ``This was a very unique opportunity because you have the ability
to associate with the men who went into battle,'' Owsley said.
``Normally, you have the artifacts without the bones.''
   About 85 men from re-enactment units representing the 28th
Massachusetts and the 93rd Pennsylvania regiments camped at Antietam
and assisted with the burial and a Roman Catholic Mass.
   The morning service was held along ``Bloody Lane,'' a sunken road
in the middle of the battlefield where intense fighting occurred for
nearly four hours that day.
   ``Re-enactors normally re-enact history, but today we are making
history,'' said Collin MacDonald, 38, of Centreville, Va., who
served as a commander for the event. ``This is the first Civil War
burial that the park has had this century. The re-enactors who are
here are making history.''
   A hazy ridge of South Mountain provided a distant backdrop for
the Mass. The coffin, which rested on sawhorses, was covered with a
34-star American flag. Some of the soldiers, dressed in navy coats
and light blue slacks, knelt on one knee during the service. Smoke
from morning campfires filled the air.
   Pallbearers placed the coffin on a horse-drawn cart drapped in
black, and the soldiers donned black arm bands before starting a
milelong procession from Bloody Lane to the cemetery. The group
marched to a somber beat of drums draped in black.
