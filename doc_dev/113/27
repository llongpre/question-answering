   Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov conferred
with President Bush on Tuesday on the prospects for reducing
nuclear and conventional arms and assured the American people they
need not fear the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet defense minister was kept waiting a half hour as Bush
got a briefing from national security adviser Brent Scowcroft on
the attempted coup in Panama.
   The president was informed after the Oval Office session with
Yazov that the attempt to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
apparently had failed.
   Bush broke his usual practice of refusing to answer questions
during photo opportunities by telling reporters the fighting in
Panama was not ``some American operation.''
   The president asked Yazov to ``pay my respects to President
Gorbachev,'' and said the recent talks with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze were ``very fruitful.''
   ``We are satisfied. We've got some problems still,'' Bush said,
but ``things are moving in the direction we wanted.''
   Yazov, emerging 30 minutes later, offered his own rosy
assessment of the outlook for arms control.
   The burly, beribboned general told reporters:
   ``The main point of my discussions with the U.S. president was
the question of arms control, the question of reducing conventional
armed forces and weapons and the question of promoting a
relationship between our two militaries and our two nations.''
   Speaking in Russian, Yazov said: ``The Soviet people are
cherishing the best sentiments and feeling towards the Americans.
We were comrades at arms during the Second World War and we
succeeded in winning a great victory. And now we have no grounds,
no reason whatsoever, to go into confrontation (against) each
other.''
   Asked if this meeting had furthered the prospects for an arms
pact, Yazov smiled and said, ``Well, I don't think I could really
assure success at the negotiations within half an hour.''
   But he added, ``Our negotiating teams are working in Geneva. I
think we are moving forward step by step to the ultimate conclusion
of agreements on the questions. Anyhow, we are counting on
progress.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said afterward Bush
had ``reiterated his support for perestroika,'' the Soviet process
of reorganization into a more open society, and ``expressed his
desire to conclude agreements on conventional forces in Europe and
on chemical weapons as soon as possible and his hopes for progress
in START,'' the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.
   If Yazov was perturbed at being kept waiting and having events
in Panama intrude on the Oval Office meeting, he did not show it.
   Asked if the Soviet Union favored the removal of Noriega from
power, Yazov said, ``I am not prepared to talk on the issue because
I am not aware of what happened in Panama. ... We have not talked
about it at all. I can't tell you anything more.''
   Yazov said he and Cheney were hoping to reach agreements on
several steps to improve the rapidly warming relations between the
leadership of the Soviet and American armed forces.
   ``We are thinking of expanding our exchanges in the military
field next year and we are going to draft a whole program which
will be designed to promote better understanding between our two
militaries and between our peoples,'' he said.
   Earlier, Cheney took Yazov to Gettysburg, Pa., about 62 miles
north of Washington to see the battlefield where Union troops
repulsed Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate soldiers in a bloody
three-day battle in July 1863 that marked one of the turning points
in the American Civil War. Yazov is a Civil War buff.
   After a two-hour tour of the battlefield and viewing its famous
landmarks like Devil's Den and the Wheat Field, Yazov said, ``I
wish we would not have any battlefields like this one in the
future,'' The Gettysburg Times reported.
   Yazov's busy schedule called for speeches Tuesday at the
National Defense University at Fort Myer, Va., near the Pentagon
and before the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, a private
group.
   Yazov will visit Camp Pendleton, a Marine training base in
Southern California, on Wednesday, and Luke Air Force Base in
Arizona on Thursday. On Friday he will tour Fort Bragg, N.C., then
return to Washington for a news conference with Cheney.
