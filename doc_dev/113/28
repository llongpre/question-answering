<LEADPARA>  FINDING a way to make an 86-year-old story about Abraham Lincoln seem both
fresh and relevant to today's viewers couldn't have been easy, but somehow
they've done it in tonight's ABC movie, "The Perfect Tribute.";    Of course,
they had the considerable help of two-time Academy Award-winner Jason Robards,
who gives a performance as Lincoln you're not likely to forget.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The result is a gentle, heartwarming film that reminds us how the agony of
the Civil War affected a handful of Americans, including the 16th president,
who were touched by one of its most profoundly tragic encounters -- the Battle
of Gettysburg.;    The timing of "The Perfect Tribute" -- arriving when
America is recovering from yet another war -- may make viewers even more
receptive to the film's anti-war message.;    The film follows the journey of
a 13-year-old Atlanta boy, Benjamin Blair (Lukas Haas), through the war-torn
countryside in the third year of the Civil War. He's trying to reach
Washington City, where he believes his older brother, Carter (Campbell Scott),
a Confederate soldier, lies dying from wounds received at Gettysburg.;    At
the same time, President Lincoln is fraught with despair over the worsening
condition of his ailing son, Tad (Andrew Winton), and the awesome number of
casualties on both sides of the epic conflict at Gettysburg.;    Hated by
Southerners and disliked by enormous numbers of war-numbed Northerners as
well, Lincoln has fallen so low that hardly anyone wants to hear him when he
rises to deliver the brief words of dedication at the new national cemetery at
Gettysburg -- words that would later be cited as among the most eloquent in
American history.;    The story of how this troubled president's path crosses
that of the desperate 13-year-old from Atlanta is the core of "The Perfect
Tribute." Only the hardhearted will be unmoved by the sentimental climax.;   
Though the incident never happened, most of the events leading up to it did,
including the film's most spellbinding sequence -- Lincoln's delivery of his
Gettysburg Address to a stunned crowd wholly unprepared for its compelling
depth of feeling.;    Indeed, this is a great television moment, as Robards
gives new dimensions of power to the words so familiar to millions.;    "The
Perfect Tribute" is the work of first-time screenwriter Dennis Brown, a
journalist and sometime lecturer aboard the famed Delta Queen steamboat. He
took it from the short story by Mary Raymond Shipman Andrews, first published
in Scribner's magazine in 1905. Reprinted in book form, it sold 600,000
copies, a phenomenal number in its day.;    The movie shows us how worn-down
Americans were after three years of fighting each other. Most of the
characters are weary and heartsick, hoping for any miracle to bring this
catastrophic thing to a close.;    The exception is young Benjamin, who's
playing war with his tin soldiers at his Atlanta home when we first meet him.
Still untouched by the war, he's able to imagine only the glory of it all.;   
In sharp counterpoint, the movie alternates scenes from the horrors of
Gettysburg as Ben hums to himself and fights his tabletop battle: slugs
thumping into human chests, sending out great gouts of blood, the infernal
pounding of cannon, the screams of the wounded, the deafening buzz of the
flies.;    One of those who falls is his brother, who winds up with a terrible
wound in his chest, slowly dying from the bullet the Union doctor tending him
can't remove.;    It's not until Ben begins his impulsive quest into enemy
territory that he sees war for what it really is. Hiding, he stumbles over a
stiffening corpse in the woods. Starving, he's denied food by even the
Confederate troops he meets. The one Southern soldier who befriends him is
suddenly killed -- quietly, with a neat round hole in his forehead.;    At the
same time, Lincoln is shocked by the early casualty figures from Gettysburg:
3,000 Union dead and 15,000 wounded against 2,600 Confederate dead and 13,000
wounded -- in just three days of fighting.;    Robards is brilliant as
Lincoln, assuming the character naturally without any trace of caricature.
(Robards has played Lincoln twice before on TV, the last time in 1964.) His
Lincoln is a sad, almost pathetic figure but infused with great humanity and
very likable.;    Young Lukas Haas (the memorable Amish boy in "Witness") is
also exceptional, as Benjamin, particularly in the scene in which he reads the
Gettysburg Address aloud from the newspaper to his brother and the man he
doesn't realize is Lincoln himself.;    "The Perfect Tribute" is also loaded
with very strong supporting players, including a surprising dramatic cameo by
Katherine Helmond ("Who's the Boss?") as a war-deadened farm woman who helps
Benjamin along the way.;    Among the others: Jeanne Tripplehorn as a Union
nurse who treats Ben's brother with compassion despite the death of her own
man at Rebel hands; Oscar-winner Jose Ferrer as Edward Everett, the primary
speaker at the Gettysburg memorial, who admits Lincoln's soaring speech has
humbled him, and Emmy-winner Ed Flanders ("St. Elsewhere"), the newspaper
publisher who has grown tired of Lincoln until riding with him to Gettysburg.;
   "The Perfect Tribute" is another jewel in the crown of producer Dorothea G.
Petrie, whose award-laden TV films include "Caroline?" "Love Is Never Silent"
and "Foxfire." With our national interest in the period still running high
after last year's acclaimed "The Civil War" series on PBS, "The Perfect
Tribute" should receive a warm welcome from viewers and leave them feeling
much better for the experience. (box)  </TEXT>
