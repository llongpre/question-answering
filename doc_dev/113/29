<LEADPARA>  THE climactic battle for the Shenandoah Valley, General Pickett's headlong
charge at Gettysburg and the first and second battles of Manassas are the
stuff from which Richard Berg has fashioned a business.;    Berg, 47, a former
New York City criminal defense lawyer, is the inventor of more than a dozen
Civil War games designed to give Civil War enthusiasts an opportunity to
change history.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I think of the games as paper time machines that re-create the Civil War,"
Berg says.;     Outfighting General Lee;    "We give players the battlefield,
the soldiers and the basic rules. Then it's up to them to do what they will
with them. For instance, take Gettysburg; if General Lee had not stopped early
on July 1, because his troops were tired, even though he had a couple of hours
of daylight left, the outcome of the battle and the Civil War might have been
very different. You can see it on the board.";    Explaining that Union forces
had not yet established a defensive position that fateful day, on Cemetery
Ridge and Culp's Hill, Berg points out, had Lee kept going, the Union troops
might have been forced to withdraw.;    Two editions of his game on
Gettysburg, "Terrible Swift Sword," have been strong sellers, and one was
voted Best Game of the Year by the game industry.;    "More than 50,000 people
have bought the games to see if they can do better than General Lee," Berg
says. "A third edition is in the works now.";    Berg began designing games as
a hobby when he was a high-school student at Poly Prep in Brooklyn.;    As an
adult, he became a contributor to Strategy &amp; Tactics, a military and history
magazine now published by 3W Inc. of Cambria. Each issue includes a complete
war game.;    "The magazine grew rapidly, and the games began to attract a
following. Eventually, I began designing board games for the general market.
'Terrible Swift Sword' was my second board game.";    Inventing games was his
avocation, he says, until a few years ago when the pressure stemming from his
job as a criminal defense lawyer began to get to him: "It wasn't exactly
burnout, but something close to it.;    "On the other hand, I was getting a
tremendous amount of satisfaction doing my games and I thought, well, maybe I
can make money doing what I want to do," he says.;    "I recall being somewhat
apprehensive about my colleagues' reaction to my announcement that I was
leaving the legal profession to become a game designer full time, but I
needn't have worried. When I made the announcement, they all wanted to join
me.";     First comes the map;    However, Berg says he made the change
slowly, a step at a time. He resigned from his job, did a lot of research, and
founded a company, Simulation Design, with a partner, Thaddeus Kubits, a
former client.;    Berg set up an office in his Scarsdale home and began
producing his games. He says the first step in designing a game is to do the
board.;    "After the research, which I enjoy thoroughly, I draw the maps.
Then I write the rules," he says. "The basic rules are the same. But before I
had a computer, I used to do them on the typewriter and they took forever.
With the computer, I can move them around with ease.";    A well-designed
game, he says, plays fair and square with the players.;    "It should allow
the players to see the alternatives before they make a move. Some games last
longer than others. Some can be played in two hours, others are good for an
entire weekend.";    Berg, who ranks himself as an ardent Civil War buff who
is familiar with every regiment Lee had in battle, also designs games on other
subjects, such as his "Lord of the Rings" games and sports games.;    "Almost
any event lends itself to a game," he says. "I've designed crisis-management
games, and now we're working on one that is a reflection of the times.
Business is the theme, and each player is out of work and trying to get
another job.";    Berg, who uses the services of free-lance professionals,
says his biggest expense was for printing the board games.;    "Our printing
costs are phenomenal," he says. "We shopped around and looked at plants
overseas that do the work much cheaper. But we found quality control in the
Far East to be somewhat haphazard, primarily because of language differences.
The slightest alteration in the wording of the rules, for instance, blows the
whole game. So we now print at a plant in Dallas, where our main distributor
is located.";    The games, which retail in the $35 to $50 range, are
distributed to hobby shops.;    "It's a peak and valley business. October to
December are busy months, then we fall off until late February, when the large
hobby shows are held. But you can make money as a games publisher if you have
a good reputation and a fairly good inventory. I'm inclined to think games are
pretty recession-proof because when people have less money to spend on
entertainment they'll be home more often and perhaps they play more games. The
biggest game moneymaker of all time, Monopoly, was invented during the Great
Depression.";    What makes a good game?;    "A good game is different every
time you play it. I give players many choices. And they are choices of the
damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't variety. I like to build chaos and
random events into the game; it makes it more interesting.";    Berg says he
gets fan mail and an occasional irate letter from game players.;    "People
who play games are very passionate about them," he says.;    Berg, who also is
a frequent lecturer at schools and historic societies, says games are much
under-used as a teaching tool.;    "Games are a marvelous way to get kids
interested in history. It helps them understand why and how events occurred."  </TEXT>
