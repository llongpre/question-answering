   After three days of wool uniforms and no
showers, thousands of men helping reenact the Battle of Gettysburg
have forsaken the life of a Civil War soldier to the 20th century.
   ``I'd like to stay longer, but you have to make a living,'' said
Griff King, a 35-year-old machine operator from Weston, W.Va. and a
member of the 2nd Virginia Regiment.
   More than 8,000 uniformed men concluded a commemoration of the
battle's 125th anniversary Sunday by staging the final charge of
the war's bloodiest confrontation.
   Organizers billed the event as the largest Civil War reenactment
ever.
   Some 140,000 people witnessed the reenectment over three days,
said Paul Baebler, a spokesman for Napoleonic Tactics Inc., which
staged the battle on 700 acres of farmland five miles south of the
actual battlefield.
   After the last shots were fired, participants from North and
South stood in silence as a bugler played taps and cannons fired
one after another in a 21-gun salute to honor those who died in the
actual battle.
   Close to 50,000 Union and Confederate troops were killed or
wounded at the Battle of Gettysburg on July 1-3, 1863, when the
Army of the Potomac turned back the Army of Northern Virginia's
attempt to invade the North.
   A series of cannon blasts by both sides opened the fighting
Sunday. Then Confederates gave out a rebel yell and marched
shoulder-to-shoulder 200 yards across and several men deep across a
field and up a ridge, where Union troops waited.
   Major Gen. George E. Pickett's unsuccessful charge with more
than 12,000 troops against 9,000 Union soldiers was the
Confederate's final offensive push at Gettysburg.
   ``If the Battle of Gettysburg was the turning point of the Civil
War, then Pickett's charge was the turning point of the Battle of
Gettysburg,'' said Kim Holien, a historian with the U.S. Army
Center of Military History.
   Troops for the North and South traded volley after volley in an
engagement staged at one-third the original scale of Pickett's
Charge.
   ``It was a great battle,'' said John McQueen, a 37-year-old
marketing manager from Atlanta who fought for the 52nd Ohio
Regiment as soldiers for both sides fell around him.
   ``The rifle barrels were getting so hot you couldn't touch
them,'' he said.
   Confederate troops fell back after an hour of battle.
   Five ersatz troops required hospitalization for injuries
suffered during the three days of soldiering, said Dr. Bill
Steinour, director of the emergency room at Gettysburg Hospital.
   He said there were two serious leg injuries, a skull fracture, a
man suffering chest pain and another with a kidney stone ailment.
   ``All in all, we were lucky,'' Steinour said.
   The weather, too, held for the event. It was hot and dry all
three days.
   ``Mother Nature and God were looking out for us,'' Ms. Niero
said.
