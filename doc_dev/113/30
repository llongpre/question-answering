   The North and South both are losing the
modern-day Battle of Gettysburg.
   The monuments that make the rolling hills one of the world's
largest outdoor museums are melting. Every time rain drips from the
marble and bronze memorials, acid slowly but steadily washes away
pieces of history.
   ``The marble ones are definitely on their way to destruction,''
said David Ballard, maintenance director at Gettysburg National
Military Park. ``You can wax bronze, but there isn't a ... lot you
can do about marble. The marble's just going to keep on fizzing
away.''
   Only granite markers and monument bases seem immune. Across the
sprawling battlefield, the effects of acid rain are obvious to even
a casual observer. Brass plaques are stained and streaked with
corrosion in shades of black, gray, green and white. Marble markers
are badly pitted and misshapen.
   On Cemetery Ridge, the high ground that Union forces held on the
decisive third day of the 1863 Civil War battle, Ballard gestured
helplessly toward an octagonal marble marker. Inscriptions had been
chiseled on all eight sides, but only a stray letter or two remain
visibile.
   ``Whatever the heck was here, it's gone now. It's history,'' he
said.
   A short hike away, in the cemetery where Abraham Lincoln
delivered the Gettysburg Address is the first monument erected
here. The Soldiers' National Monument, whose dedication took up
much of the front page of The New York Times on July 2, 1869, is
``probably the most endangered piece we have in the park right
now,'' Ballard said.
   The monument features a woman representing liberty atop a
classical column, which rests on a pedestal. At the four corners of
the pedestal, sculpted marble figures represent War, History, Peace
and Plenty. Damage from acid particles in rain isn't apparent at
first because of the stark beauty of the work viewed as a whole. A
closer look reveals a missing toe here, a washed-out detail there.
   Ballard likened the damage to a melting ice cube, which retains
its general appearance for a while, then collapses because it loses
structural shape.
   Fighting the acidic effects of airborne pollution, according to
a draft National Park Service report, is a losing battle:
   ``Only memories last forever. In time, metal corrodes and stone
crumbles. What worries park managers at Gettysburg National
Military Park is the speed with which our monuments to those
honored dead are disappearing.''
   Complicating Ballard's mission are two facts he can't control.
Pennsylvania, according to the state Sierra Club and Pennsylvanians
for Acid Rain Control, receives the most acidic rainfall in the
United States and is one of the top three sources of sulfur
dioxide. Environmentalists contend sulfur dioxide from coal-fired
power plants is a major cause of acid rain.
   Another constraint Ballard faces is limited government funding,
both to deal with acid rain and maintain Gettysburg's monuments.
   Asked if his crews could protect the 1,300 monuments and major
markers, he replied, ``Not given the current state of funding in
the park service. It would take a crew of a dozen people, perhaps,
working year round.'' Payroll costs alone would total $300,000, he
said.
   Park workers do what they can. Corrosion is removed from bronze
with a pressurized stream of pulverized walnut shells the
consistency of pepper; then it is coated with a protective wax. To
be effective, the coating should be done every year, but funds and
manpower dictate less frequent treatments here.
   The work isn't cheap. Simply erecting scaffolding to repair
acid-rain damage to the Pennsylvania Monument, the largest in the
park, cost $8,000. It cost $2,900 total to clean and wax a smaller
Minnesota monument.
   Environmentalists say the problem can be resolved by requiring
industries to install equipment to reduce and control emissions.
   ``We have the technological means,'' the Canadian Coalition on
Acid Rain said recently. ``We know what we have to do to clean our
air and we know how to do it ... We've studied enough, we've
gathered tons of scientific evidence and we've talked until we're
blue in the face.''
   At recent conference, A. Joseph Dowd of the American Electric
Power Service Corp. said Congress shouldn't require industries to
spend billions on pollution control devices ``unless it is quite
clear that the resulting environmental benefits in the Northeast
and Canada will exceed the cost.''
   Ballard has steered clear of the political battle over acid
rain, but says something must be done before long or major
monuments will be beyond repair. ``It's a real problem, and the
current solutions just aren't good enough.''
