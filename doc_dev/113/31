<LEADPARA>  Visitors to Civil War battlefields soon will be able to ask a computer if
their ancestors were Yankees or rebels.;    The National Park Service has
begun to make a computerized directory of all 3.5 million Civil War soldiers.
Historians estimate that at least half of all Americans have relatives who
fought.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's going to change the way we look at the war. It's going to personalize
the battles, the struggles that went on," said Rich Rambur, superintendent at
Antietam National Battlefield, one of two places where the computerized
directory will be tested come fall.;    "We've spent decades in the
preservation of Civil War land and artifacts. Now, we're preserving the
names.";    The computers are expected to provide names, home states,
regiments, soldiers' ranks and whether they fought for the North or South,
said John F. Peterson of the park service's computer division in Washington.; 
  "It won't prove that your great-grandfather fought at Gettysburg, for
example, but it will tell you what regiment he was in and it will tell you
that that regiment fought at Gettysburg," Peterson said.;    Knowing the
person's regiment, middle initial or home state would help narrow the search
for common names such as Smith and Lee, Peterson said.;    The computers will
provide brief information on the 7,000 Civil War regiments and units, and
information on many of the 10,500 battles, skirmishes and engagements, he
said.;    "We're also going to be able to track where Civil War soldiers are
buried at our 11 Civil War cemeteries within the park system," Peterson said.;
   Computers are to be installed at all 28 Civil War sites that the National
Park Service operates in 21 states and the District of Columbia.;    About 11
million people visit the sites each year. Peterson said the most frequently
asked question is: "Did my great-great-grandfather fight here?";    To answer
the question, park historians now must research pension and service records,
state rosters, census and war records, and county histories.;    Visitors will
be given information on other sources of information, and they'll be
encouraged to continue their research at the National Archives in Washington.;
   The Genealogical Societies of Utah, affiliated with the Mormon Church, and
the Federation of Geneological Societies intend to enter the names on
computer. Otherwise, it would cost the government $4.5 million to hire a
company to computerize all the names.  </TEXT>
