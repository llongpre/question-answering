   Soviet Defense Minister Dimitri Yazov, making
his first visit to the United States, is meeting with President
Bush and touring the Civil War battlefield at Gettysburg, Pa.
   Pentagon officials said Yazov's trip today to the battlefield
where Union troops turned back Gen. Robert E. Lee's Confederate
soldiers in a key, bloody battle was prompted by his interest in
the war between the states.
   Yazov met Monday for more than four hours with Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney at the Pentagon, officials said.
   A senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
described the talks as ``relaxed, candid, generally non-polemical,
informative.'' The goal of the talks, the official said, were to
``improve understanding between the two sides,'' as well as
``enhance stability and predictability.''
   The main topics of discussion were ``how national security and
defense decisions are made in the two countries,'' as well as
military strategies, defense spending, regional conflicts and arms
control negotiations, the official said.
   Specifically, U.S. officials sought information about the Soviet
Union's promise to make unilateral troop reductions and to cut the
defense budget by 14 percent.
   ``The Soviets gave us some details. ... You always learn
something new,'' the official said, but he declined to provide
details.
   Asked if Cheney and his advisers were confident about Soviet
pledges to scale back defense spending, the official said, ``We'll
have to see.''
   Yazov's visit grew out an invitation extended by former Defense
Secretary Frank Carlucci when the two met in Europe near the end of
the Reagan administration.
   In addition to meeting with Bush and visiting Gettysburg, Yazov
also was to speak today at the National Defense University at Fort
Myer, Va.
   On Wednesday, Yazov will visit Camp Pendleton, a Marine training
base in Southern California. He'll visit Luke Air Force Base in
Arizona on Thursday, then fly to Fort Bragg, N.C., on Friday. Later
Friday, he'll return to Washington for a news conference with
Cheney.
