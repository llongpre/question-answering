   The roads and hillsides winding through
Antietam National Battlefield are to be softly lit Saturday night
with 23,110 candles, one for each soldier killed, wounded or
missing after the Civil War's bloodiest battle.
   ``It's a memorial and Christmas is the season of lights. We just
thought it would be a good time to stop and reflect,'' Richard
Rambur, battlefield superintendent, said Friday. ``Everybody talks
about 23,000, but not very many people really have an idea of how
many that is.''
   Up to 5,000 automobilies are expected to join a 4.5-mile tour of
the battlefield near Sharpsburg, about 70 miles west of Baltimore.
Candles glowing inside lunch-sized paper bags filled with sand will
outline the roadways and others will dot the snow-covered
3,200-acre battleground.
   More men were killed or wounded at Antietam on Sept. 17, 1862,
than on any other single day of the Civil War. Union losses were
12,410 and Confederate losses totaled 10,700. It was the single
bloodiest day of American military history.
   ``You're really going to get an impression of what kind of
impact that was,'' Rambur said. ``When they drive through here,
they're going to feel something, I'm sure.''
   In addition to the bags of lighted candles, choirs will be
singing at various spots in the battlefield, including the Dunker
Church, the focal point of repeated clashes as both armies sought
to occupy and control high ground at the site.
   A Civil War-era encampment, complete with uniformed re-enactors,
recaptures the atmosphere of a wintertime camp 127 years ago. The
soldiers will gather at Bloody Lane, a sunken road near the center
of the battlefield where four hours of fighting left more than
5,000 dead or injured.
   Neither side gained a decisive victory in the Battle of
Antietam, but the conflict climaxed the first of Confederate
general Robert E. Lee's two attempts to carry the war into the
North. The battle also gave President Abraham Lincoln an
opportunity to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all
slaves in the United States in 1863.
   An estimated 500 volunteers from church and civic groups,
historical organizations, scouting troops and area businesses have
assembled the lights, said Washington County Tourism Director Bob
O'Connor. The battlefield was divided into 23 grids and groups
assigned to each section are responsible for arranging and lighting
1,000 candles and retrieving them after the five-hour display.
   All 23,110 tapers will be lit in the 30 minutes between dusk and
dark, O'Connor said. ``We don't know of any (battlefield) where
this has been done to this magnitude,'' he said.
   Rambur said organizers are encouraging volunteers to maintain a
somber attitude while lighting the candles.
   ``This is a memorial and we're trying to stress that. We do not
want Santa Clauses and that kind of thing,'' Rambur said. ``If we
learn anything from the battlefields, it is that there just has to
be another answer to war.''
