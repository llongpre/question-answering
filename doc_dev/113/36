   Chief Justice William Rehnquist joined
more than 2,000 people who gathered Saturday to mark the 125th
anniversary of President Abraham Lincoln's Gettysburg Address
honoring the men who fought here in the Civil War.
   Rehnquist noted that although Lincoln's speech endures, it was
not the focus of the Nov. 19, 1863, dedication of part of the
Gettysburg battlefield as a national cemetery.
   ``Edward Everett, the nationally known orator, was the featured
speaker, and spoke for nearly two hours,'' Rehnquist said. ``Lincoln
was invited only to make a few remarks. Yet Everett's oration is
forgotten, but Lincoln's remarks will live forever.''
   People in period dress lined the streets near the town's train
depot, awaiting the arrival of a man portraying Lincoln and his
entourage on the Stroudsburg Railroad.
   As the dignitaries climbed off the train more than 2,000 people
dressed as Civil War troops and townspeople of the era kicked off
the celebration, making a parade to the National Cemetery where
Lincoln gave the famed speech.
   State police estimated more than 5,000 spectators huddled in the
freezing rain to hear James A. Getty, portraying Lincoln, repeat the
270-word speech that begins, ``Four score and seven years ago ....''
   ``You knew he was an actor, but it was still thrilling,'' said
Sunbury resident Jean Marquette, who was not bothered by the bad
weather. ``I got goose bumps.''
   Rehnquist spoke of Lincoln as a great statesman and masterful
speech writer.
   ``From contemporary descriptions of Lincoln, he was not what one
would think of as a great speaker,'' Rehnquist said. ``His voice was
high-pitched, and his tall, lanky appearance gave an impression of
awkwardness. But Abraham Lincoln was a master of the English
language.
   ``He was not just articulate; he was able to convey ideas in
simple terms, and yet with force and sometimes passion,'' Rehnquist
said.
