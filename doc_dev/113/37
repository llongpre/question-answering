   More than a century after Union and
Confederate soldiers spilled blood over stretches of land from
Pennsylvania to Virginia, a group is battling developers for the
real estate.
   The Association for the Preservation of Civil War Sites was
organized last summer to buy land or development rights of
battlefields unprotected by the National Park Service or other
organizations.
   ``All of us have watched over the past couple of years as a
tremendous amount of historic ground has disappeared,'' said Gary
W. Gallagher, a Penn State University history professor who is
president of the organization.
   ``If something isn't done in the next five years, it'll be too
late,'' he said.
   Gallagher said the organization has 500 members and has raised
more than $10,000. The organization received tax-exempt status last
month and plans to begin soliciting members this spring, he said.
   Urban sprawl from the Civil War capitals of Washington and
Richmond, Va., has engulfed many battlefields and threatens others.
   A large mall has been planned for an important part of the
Manassas battlefield in northern Virginia, where the second battle
of Bull Run was fought.
   Annie Snyder, who lives on a 180-acre farm adjacent to the
battlefield, earlier this year organized a group called Save The
Battlefield Coalition to fight the mall.
   Also, five parcels of land on the Cedar Creek battlefield, near
Winchester, Va., are for sale.
   ``One of the Cedar Creek sites has already been targeted as a
light industrial park, and it will be a light industrial park
unless someone buys that ground before the end of the year,'' he
said.
   Many of the former battlefields are farm or pasture land.
Encroaching development has raised real estate prices and taxes,
according to Gallagher.
   ``It's difficult to go to a land owner who hasn't been able to
make it as a farmer and has just been offered $2 million for his
land. How do you convince that person not to take the $2 million
and run?'' he said.
   Gallagher said the formation of the group was prompted last
summer by a developers who slipped bulldozers onto northern
Virginia's Chantilly Battlefield in the middle of the night.
   Initially, the developers had agreed to delay any excavation
until historical surveying could be conducted, according to
Gallagher. Only five acres were preserved to commemorate the
battle, he said.
   The National Park Service owns and maintains several Civil War
battlefields, including sites in Gettysburg, Antietam, Monassas,
Fredericksburg, Appomatox and Richmond.
   Many others remain unprotected, Gallagher said.
   Among them are sites in the Shenandoah Valley, where Confederate
General Stonewall Jackson staged his 1862 campaign, and at Brandy
Station, in north-central Virginia, the site of the largest cavalry
battle in the Western Hemisphere, Gallagher said.
   Gallagher said the organization plans to buy land or development
rights and turn the property over to historical societies or
government organizations to manage.
   ``We're not talking about buying thousands and thousands of
acres. We know some growth is inevitable. We just think there has
to be some balance between growth and preserving a part of our
past,'' he said.
