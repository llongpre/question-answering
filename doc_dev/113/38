<HEAD>House Approves Boundaries For Gettysburg National Military Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Tuesday that
establishes boundaries for the Gettysburg National Military Park,
where President Lincoln delivered his historic address and the
Union and Confederate armies fought a key battle of the Civil War.
   By voice vote, the House adopted the bill that allows the
Interior Department to acquire land and interests in land within
the established boundaries by purchase, donation, exchange or other
means.
   The park, which was transferred from the War Department to the
National Park Service in 1933, includes approximately 3,900 acres
of Pennsylvania land, including about 3,700 that are owned by the
federal government.
   The bill also establishes an 11-member advisory commission to
join with local jurisdictions in managing the park and the
Gettysburg Battlefield Historic District.
   The measure also calls on the Interior Department to take steps
that encourage conservation of the park.
   The House Interior Committee said the bill will result in only a
minimal increase in federal spending. It did not provide specifics.
