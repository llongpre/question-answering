   Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov left Moscow on
Sunday for a visit to the United States, where he will see several
U.S. military bases and the Gettysburg Civil War battlefield.
   The Tass news agency reported Yazov's departure on the trip that
is being made at the invitation of U.S. Defense Secretary Richard
Cheney.
   It follows a series of high-level military contacts between the
superpowers, including the visit to the Soviet Union last year of
then-Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci.
   The tour is expected to include the Naval Air Station near San
Diego, the Marine Corps training center at nearby Camp Pendleton,
Luke Air Force Base near Phoeniz, and Fort Bragg in North Carolina.
   Yazov also will be taken to the battlefield at Gettysburg,
Penn., where one of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War was
fought in 1863.
