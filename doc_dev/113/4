   Amid shouts of ``Fire!'' and the thunder
of cannon, thousands of men in blue and gray stormed each other to
re-enact the opening of the Battle of Gettysburg, 125 years after
the Civil War's bloodiest confrontation.
   A total of about 8,000 men representing Union and Confederate
troops traded mock rifle volleys and cannon bursts Friday, ripping
open paper gunpowder cartridges with their teeth while enemy lines
closed in.
   The Confederate troops pushed back the Union's black-hatted
``Iron Brigade,'' as scores of men on both sides feigned death in
the tall grass and spectators watched from a hill overlooking the
field.
   ``When it gets to firing, you're not in 1988 anymore, you're in
1863,'' said Jeff Douthit, a 28-year-old farmer from Unionville, Va.
   The participants, among them teachers, engineers, artists and
soldiers, had invested $1,000 to outfit themselves with the
uniform, gear and guns needed to become Civil War soldiers, if only
for a day or two.
   Soldiers in the 23rd New York Regiment, played by a group from
Arizona, went so far as to follow Union recipes down to ``hard
tack,'' hard, flat squares of bread.
   ``You might think it was made 125 years ago. It's that
indigestable,'' said Ed Gouvier, a 37-year-old engineer from
Phoenix.
   Mentioning anything modern by members of the 23rd New York
resulted in punishment: standing on a wooden crate at the end of
one of the rows of white, canvas tents.
   Gouvier said people joined the outfit for a chance to relive
history, for the camaraderie, or to take part in the battles.
   ``I've always been a history fanatic,'' he said.
   Others had more personal reasons for joining one of the ersatz
armies.
   Steve DiCarlo, of Owings, Md., said he became a member of the
18th Virginia Regiment in part because his
great-great-great-grandfather was a captain in the Confederate Army.
   ``My wife thinks I'm crazy,'' he said.
   Napoleonic Tactics Inc., which sold tickets to cover its
$450,000 budget for staging three days of ersatz warfare, has
billed the event as the largest Civil War re-enactment ever. The
consulting company was hired by the event's sponor, the American
Civil War Commemorative Committee Inc.
   A total of 75,000 spectators were expected to attend the
re-enactment on farmland five miles south of the actual
battlefield. The event ends Sunday with the restaging of Pickett's
Charge.
   The Battle of Gettysburg took place from July 1-3, 1863, and
resulted in a total of close to 50,000 dead and wounded.
   Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was moving from the north toward
Gettysburg to get shoes for his troops and secure the roads running
through the southern Pennsylvania town, said Kim Bernard Holien, a
historian for the U.S. Army Center of Military History.
   The Union's Army of the Potomac was moving north when the chance
encounter at McPherson's Ridge touched off the bloody battle, he
said.
   Many of the current ``soldiers'' said they prepared for the
battle for months because its size set it apart.
   Tactical commanders for both sides met Thursday night to map out
the next day's skirmish.
   ``Supposedly everything's supposed to happen according to the
script,'' said Paul Baebler, a spokesman for Napoleonic Tactics.
   ``The people who won the first time will win again.'' he said.
   Organizers had said the number of troops falling ``dead'' in
Friday's skirmish would be proportionate to actual losses.
   But Michael Kraus, commander of the Union forces, said troops
often improvise on the field.
   ``It's an individual thing,'' said Kraus, a 34-year-old artist
from Creston, Ohio.
   The largest previous Civil War re-enactment was the Battle of
First Manassas in July 1986, involving 6,000 re-enactors, according
to Napoleonic Tactics.
