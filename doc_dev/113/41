   A Senate national parks subcommittee announced
today a hearing on what has become known as the ``Third Battle of
Manassas,'' the fight by preservationists to prevent construction
of a shopping mall adjacent to a Civil War battlefield in northern
Virginia.
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources subcommittee on public
lands, national parks and forests will meet Sept. 8 to consider
legislation which the House passed 307-98 on Wednesday to buy the
542-acre mall site next to the battlefield where the Confederacy
won two major battles in 1861 and 1862.
   Historians and preservationists say a shopping mall would
desecrate the Union and Confederate soldiers who died on the
battlefield. The House bill would add the land to the existing
battlefield park.
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., said that after testimony is taken
at the hearing, he may offer legislation to buy only a part of the
developer's tract.
   ``My concern continues to be that the federal government could
spend a significant amount of the taxpayers' money for a parcel of
land, which during the debates in 1980, was not regarded as
historically significant for the Park expansion bill,'' said Warner.
   ``If Congress prevents development on this site and purchases
the property, at considerable expense to the federal taxpayer and
the mall is moved to a nearby site and built, is that expenditure
of federal funds justified in order to protect property which has
some historical significance?'' he asked.
   Warner said he believes the tract's Stuart's Hill where
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had headquaters during the Second
Battle of Manassas in 1862 should be considered for inclusion in
the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
   The Reagan administration opposes the measure because of its
cost _ estimated to range from $15 million to $100 million. Office
of Management and Budget and Interior Department officials have
said they would recommend that President Reagan veto the measure if
Congress enacts it in its current form.
   One of the major floor debates was the cost versus the
preservation of American heritage.
   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., said important pieces of property
representing America's heritage must be preserved.
   ``Our country and our culture are built upon our heritage,'' he
said. ``Our past is an important part of our present, and our
future.''
   However, when the matter came to a vote, Parris voted
``present'' because the developer, John T. Hazel, has been a close
friend and campaign contributor to him for many years.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., called the measure ``a squandering
of the taxpayers' money. This should have a low priority or no
priority.''
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., also opposed the measure, saying:
``This is an extraordinary expenditure when we deny the needy.''
   But Rep. Bruce V. Vento, D-Minn., floor manager for the bill,
said, ``This is about history, about our cultural history that must
be preserved.
   ``It's a matter of whether we preserve our history or turn it
into a dollar,'' he said.
   Hazel purchased the land two years ago for under $10 million. It
is now assessed at $13.6 million. He wants to build 1.2 million
square feet of retail space, 1.7 million square feet of office
space and 560 homes next to the site of the two major Civil War
battles.
   Historians and preservationists complain that the development
site includes a bluff from which Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
commanded Southern troops in the Second Battle of Manassas.
   The tract also was the site of two field hospitals, they say.
Most historians believe that the remains of Union and Confederate
dead lie in unmarked graves on the site.
   The First Battle of Manassas, fought in July 1861, was the first
significant land battle of the Civil War. A surprising Confederate
victory there convinced Union authorities that the war would be a
protracted affair.
   More than 20,000 casualties were suffered by both sides in the
Second Battle of Manassas, which lasted over three days in August
1862. Most historians agree that Lee's triumph in that battle
represented the Confederacy's greatest victory in the war.
