<HEAD>Park Service Targets Removal of Controversial Tower at Gettysburg</HEAD>

   National Park Service officials are
pursuing a plan to buy and remove a 370-foot-high observation tower
that has overlooked the Civil War battlefield here for 15 years.
   ``My opinion is that the tower dominates the skyline at
Gettysburg and it's totally out of keeping with what we're trying
to accomplish here in preserving the battlefield,'' John Earnst,
Gettysburg National Military Park superintendent, said Tuesday.
   The preliminary proposal is part of a study ordered by Congress
to determine permanent boundaries for the park, site of the 1863
Union victory and President Abraham Lincoln's legendary address.
   The proposal, outlined at a meeting Monday night, has yet to be
reviewed by Park Service officials in Washington and would require
congressional approval, Earnst said.
   The steel tower, built in 1973 on private land separating parts
of the park, was the focus of controversy over preserving the park
area's historical integrity.
   When the tower was built, then-Gov. Milton Shapp brought an
unsuccessful lawsuit against attorney Thomas Ottenstein of
Bethesda, Md., who came up with the idea for the tower and is a
co-owner.
   Ottenstein, reached in Delray Beach, Fla., said he could not
comment about Monday's meeting because he was unaware of it. The
tower's manager, Gertrude Paris, also declined to comment.
   ``I didn't know a thing until I read the paper,'' she said.
   Congress ordered the study last year while passing legislation
to allow a group's donation of 30 acres to the park.
   The study has identified about 1,800 acres that should be added
to the 3,874-acre park, said planner Jonathan Doherty of the Park
Service's regional office in Philadelphia.
