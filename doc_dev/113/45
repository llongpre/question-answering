   The federal government will ask private groups
and state and local governments to cooperate in preserving the
nation's historic battlefields, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
said Friday.
   The ``American Battlefield Protection Plan'' eventually will
cover all wars fought on U.S. soil, but will begin by focusing on
25 key Civil War sites, Lujan said.
   Because the government can't afford to buy all the land
involved, he said, a cooperative effort is needed to make sure the
farms and fields where Union and Confederate soldiers fought aren't
overwhelmed by shopping malls and industrial parks.
   ``We want the governors, local governments, foundations,
corporations and owners to all join,'' Lujan said in an interview
on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   ``Some of the battlefields, for example, would be purchased, but
some of them can be commemorated simply by easements, some of them
maybe the owner would want us to put a plaque there commemorating
that particular battle,'' he said. ``We don't have enough money
just to go off and buy all these sites.''
   Details of his plan, which includes a request for $15 million in
seed money, will be explained Saturday when Lujan speaks at
Manassas National Battlefield Park in Virginia in ceremonies
marking the 129th anniversary of the First Battle of Bull Run.
   Lujan said he also planned to discuss his ideas with the
governors of the states where the sites to be protected are located.
   Florence Kennedy, director of the battlefield preservation drive
for the private Conservation Fund, praised Lujan's project.
   ``I think the secretary's initiative is a very important one
because it's placing great importance on partnership,'' she said in
an interview. ``This partnership cooperation will be a catalyst to
encourage private sector cooperation.''
   A bitter fight broke out in 1988 over a developer's plans to
build a mall on land adjacent to the Manassas park. Congress later
voted to add the disputed tract to the park, with a final cost
expected to exceed $100 million.
   ``I was in the Congress when we went through the Manassas
fight,'' said Lujan, who represented a New Mexico district in the
House of Representatives for 20 years.
   ``At that time I thought it was the worst way to do it. It's
more expensive, you have to file suits. If we have a planned
program, everything works much better,'' he said.
   As an example of the better way, Lujan cited the Richard King
Mellon Foundation's donation to the federal government three weeks
ago of 10 parcels of land, including important sites from the Civil
War battles of Antietem and Gettysburg.
   Lujan's plan has four parts:
   _Encouraging ``creative public and private land-use tools'' such
as zoning, easements, land-banking and historic district
designation to protect imminently threatened sites.
   _Distribute information on public and private projects to
protect battlefields.
   _Use limited federal funds to encourage land purchases by
private conservation organizations and other public agencies.
   _Develop a national strategy to protect other significant
battlefield sites that aren't imminently threatened, but may be in
the future.
