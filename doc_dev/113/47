   A $50,000 annual Abraham Lincoln Prize has
been established to stimulate scholarship into Lincoln's presidency
and the Civil War era, sponsors of the award announced Thursday.
   The prize, said by its sponsors to be by far the largest ever
offered in the field of American history, will be awarded annually
to a scholarly work _ deemed to be the finest of the year _ dealing
with Lincoln, Civil War soldiers or related subjects.
   The award will be administered by Gettysburg College and will be
presented at its Pennsylvania campus each year on Lincoln's
birthday, beginning on Feb. 12, 1991.
   Funds for the award were donated by New York financiers Lewis E.
Lehrman and Richard Gilder Jr.
   Lehrman, a former unsuccessful Republican candidate for
governor, is a managing director of the investment banking firm of
Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co. Gilder is president of Gilder, Gagnon &amp; Co.,
a Wall Street stock brokerage.
   The announcement of the founding of the award was made in a
ceremony at the National Portrait Gallery in a hall used by Lincoln
125 years ago to celebrate his second inaugural. A portrait of
Lincoln hangs around the corner from where the announcement was
made.
   Gabor S. Boritt, professor of civil war studies at Gettysburg
College, said founders anticipate the Lincoln Prize will usually be
awarded to the author of a work of history, generally a book.
   But he said an important article or essay or even works of
fiction, poetry, the theatre, the arts or film might be considered,
``provided they show high fidelity to history.''
   The jurors for the 1990 Lincoln Prize will be Robert V. Bruce,
professor emeritus of history at Boston University; James M.
McPherson, professor of history at Princeton University and winner
of the Pulitzer Prize for his 1988 Civil War history, ``Battle Cry
of Freedom''; and Tom Wicker, a columnist for The New York Times
whose 1984 novel, ``Unto This Hour,'' dealt with the Civil War
battle of Second Manassas.
