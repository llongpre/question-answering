   In 1986, President Reagan presided over a gala, patriotic
ceremony in New York Harbor for the relighting of the renovated

Communications Commission was within its authority to reprimand a
New York radio station for broadcasting a George Carlin comedy
routine titled ``Filthy Words.''

over Andrea Jaeger.)
   One year ago: Two men became the first hot-air balloon travelers
