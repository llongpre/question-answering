   Several hundred people sang ``Dixie'' on
Saturday at a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the death
of Confederate President Jefferson Davis.
   More than 150 people in Civil War uniforms and period clothing,
plus a similar number of spectators in modern clothing, watched a
re-enactment of Davis being sworn in as president in 1861 atop the
Capitol steps in Montgomery. Richard Couch, portraying Davis, stood
on a bronze star that marks the spot where a country was divided.
   Some spectators carried Rebel flags and most joined in singing
``Dixie'' during the program, which included historical lectures
and displays and a rifle and cannon salute by Civil War re-enactors
from throughout Alabama.
   Norman Dasinger, state commander of the Sons of Confederate
Veterans, said Davis' death a century ago was important to mark
because there was so much misunderstanding about the Civil War.
Davis was 81 when he died in Louisiana.
   ``The ignorance is so pervasive about the war being over
slavery. Out of the 50,000 Alabamians who died in the war, 90
percent owned no one,'' said Dasinger, a professor of education
administration at Jacksonville State University.
   ``The majority of the people here today believe Jefferson Davis
was right and I do, too,'' Dasinger said. ``That does not mean we
want to have a slave nation. We believe in individual rights and
freedoms and state's rights.''
   David Toifel, a history teacher at Hillsdale Middle School in
Mobile who had the idea for the ceremony, said that one reason
Southerners loved Davis so much after the war was that ``he never
admitted what he did was wrong.''
   One of the programs at the State Archives included a film of a
re-enactment in 1914 of Davis' swearing-in by real Confederate
veterans. In that ceremony, they raised the first flag of the
Confederacy atop the Capitol _ the kind of flag that actually flew
over the building when it was the capitol of the Confederacy _
rather than the Confederate battle flag that flies there now.
   The Confederate battle flag has been the focus of protests,
including one on Feb. 2, 1988, that resulted in the arrest of 14
black state legislators who made a symbolic attempt to rip it down.
Black leaders contend the flag has become a symbol of racism
through its use by the Ku Klux Klan.
   Saturday's ceremony attracted no protests.
   The ceremony did bring two sons of Confederate veterans _
80-year-old Eddie Jordan of Selma and 83-year-old Willard ``Fred''
Kennedy of Gadsden.
   ``My daddy never owned a slave. He fought 3{ years in the war as
a volunteer. He was fighting for principle,'' Jordan said. ``When
the Union told him, you've got to get rid of slaves, he didn't like
it. It was the principle. Most people don't like to be told what to
do.''
