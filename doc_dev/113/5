   ``Wednesday 3 June 1863.
   ``Cloudy weather dominated the skies along the Rappahannock
River at Fredericksburg, Va. It rained somewhat in the morning.''
   It was on that day that the Gettysburg campaign of the Civil War
began with the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia starting its
march toward Pennsylvania, as Gen. Robert E. Lee ``commenced to
draw the army from the vicinity of Fredericksburg.'' Lee realized
some of his army's deficiencies, yet wrote to his wife: ``I trust
that a kind Providence will watch over us, and notwithstanding our
weakness and sins will yet give us a name and place among the
nations of the earth.''
   The excerpts are from a National Park Service daybook of the
campaign, part of the national commemoration of the 125th
anniversary of the key battle at the Gettysburg, Pa., National
Military Park.
   The commemoration begins Memorial Day, May 30. A ``Living
History Encampment'' starts June 18 on a farm outside Gettysburg,
when more than 1,000 re-enactors will organize an encampment and
simulate the battle, firing blanks from original and
authentic-looking Civil War guns and cannons.
   It will culminate in three days in July with a re-creation of
the conflict that became the ``high water mark of the
Confederacy.'' On July 1, 1863, the Confederate Army of Northern
Virgina pushed the Union Army of the Potomac from its positions
north and west of the town to its final defense line, to sites like
Little Round Top, Cemetery Hill, Devil's Den, Culp's Hill,
Spangler's Spring.
   Col. George Pickett's charge, a frontal assault on July 3, sent
12,000 Confederate soldiers toward the Union line. Less than 4,000
returned. On July 4, Lee's army withdrew, never to return to the
North.
   Some 160,000 soldiers took part in that battle 125 years ago;
there were some 50,000 casualties.
   A few months later, a national cemetery was dedicated at the
Gettysburg battlefield. President Lincoln gave a brief speech.
   On Nov. 19 this year, the now-famous Gettysburg Address will be
re-enacted with an actor portraying Lincoln leading the procession
from the original railroad station to the National Cemetery. U.S.
Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist is scheduled to
re-read the address.
