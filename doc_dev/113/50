   The cheers of thousands echoed on a
hillside here as a tongue of flame atop the Eternal Light Peace
Memorial burst skyward for the first time in 15 years.
   More than 20,000 people witnessed the relighting Sunday of the
memorial that was first ignited 50 years ago in memory of those who
fought and died in the Civil War Battle of Gettysburg.
   ``It's time for us to learn from the sacrifice of those who fell
here. And it is time to act,'' astronomer Carl Sagan said in his
dedication address.
   ``The real triumph of Gettysburg was not, I think, in 1863. It
was 50 years later, when the veterans, the remnants of the
adversary forces, the Blue and the Gray, met in celebration and in
solemn memorial,'' Sagan said. ``It is time to emulate them.''
   The flame will be kept burning continuously atop the limestone
and granite monument, which was dedicated 50 years ago by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt in a ceremony that drew more than 450,000
people.
   The light burned unceasingly for 35 years except for a two-year
break during World War II. In 1973, it was extinguished by a
congressional order banning all ornamental uses of energy during
the height of the oil crisis except for the flame on President John
F. Kennedy's grave in Arlington National Cemetery.
   The monument remained dark for three years. The natural gas
light then was converted to an electric light that has burned for
the past 12 years.
   The relighting of the gas-fueled flame is ``a dream come true''
for state Rep. Ken Cole of Adams. His uncle Paul Roy, who was then
editor of the Gettysburg Times, conceived the idea for the original
flame and monument, and mounted a nationwide fund-raising effort to
build it.
   ``When they put the light bulb up there and extinguished the
flame, it kind of took the heart out of the monument,'' Cole said.
   The relighting was not lost on Arthur Rice, who witnessed the
original lighting in 1938 and whose relatives helped plan that
ceremony.
   ``I think the idea of rededicating it for peace, for a world
united, is something they would be happy with,'' he said.
   Three central Pennsylvania companys have offered to pay for the
first year's fuel bill.
