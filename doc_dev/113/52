   A new coalition of preservationists says
national parks across the country face threats from commercial
development similar to a plan by a Virginia company to build a
shopping mall next to the Manassas National Battlefield.
   ``At 175 parks, the threat is so significant that the reason the
park was established may be lost,'' Paul Pritchard, one of the
founders of the National Heritage Coalition, said Thursday.
   Pritchard said other endangered parks include Richmond and
Fredericksburg-Spotsylvania in Virginia; Gettysburg, Pa.; the
Everglades National Park in Florida; and Olympic National Park in
Washington.
   At a press conference, Pritchard and other opponents of the
Manassas shopping mall announced their intention to stop it and any
other project that endangers a historic site.
   President Carter's former press secretary, Jody Powell, is
helping the group free of charge with public relations and
organized the gathering.
   The coalition _ sponsored by the National Trust for Historic
Preservation and the National Parks and Conservation Association _
is calling for Congress to enact legislation giving the federal
government power to halt development temporarily so that
negotiation, compromise or federal acquisition of disputed property
can take place.
   As part of its project to protect the Manassas battlefield, the
coalition is working for passage of a bill recently introduced by
Reps. Michael Andrews, D-Texas, and Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., that
directs the Interior Secretary to acquire the land now owned by
developers.
   Meanwhile, bulldozing is under way to prepare for townhouses and
detached homes that will accompany the shopping mall. Bob Kelly,
spokesman for the developer, Hazel-Peterson Co., said nothing can
stop construction short of an act of Congress.
   The acreage in question includes the site where Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee directed troops for the second battle of Manassas and
includes land used for hospital space and as a burial ground for
some of the war dead.
   Though the land has been part of a master plan for expanding the
4,500-acre park since 1935, it never was acquired by the federal
government and Hazel-Peterson bought it about three years ago for
$10 million.
   The Interior Department is promoting a compromise in which the
developer would move the mall so it is not visible from the park.
   The plan is acceptable to Hazel-Peterson, but not the
preservationists who say even the mall still will generate so much
traffic that visitors won't be able to get to the park without
massive traffic jams.
   Fifteen organizations, including the American Association of
Museums, the American Association of State and Local History, the
Council on America's Military Past, the National Center for
Preservation Law, the Society of Civil War Historians and the
Wilderness Society, are included in the National Heritage Coalition.
