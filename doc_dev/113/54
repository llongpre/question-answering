THE PRESIDENT SPEAKS AT GETTYSBURG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Abraham Lincoln delivered the following address on Nov. 19, 1863, at 
the site of the Battle of Gettysburg during the dedication of the national 
cemetery there. 
</P>
<P>
Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a 
new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men 
are created equal. 
</P>
<P>
Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any 
nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great 
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a 
final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might 
live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. 
</P>
<P>
But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can 
not hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, 
have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will 
little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what 
they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the 
unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It 
is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- 
that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which 
they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that 
these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall 
have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the 
people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.
