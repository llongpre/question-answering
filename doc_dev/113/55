   A bill authorizing the federal government to
seize more than 500 acres of a developer's land adjacent to a
historic Civil War battlefield was cleared Thursday for House floor
action, possibly next week.
   The House Public Works and Transportation Committee approved by
voice vote an almost identical measure to one passed earlier by the
House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee.
   The Public Works version, however, stipulated that $30 million
in Interior Department rather than Transportation Department funds
be used to study whether roads should be closed in the Manassas
National Battlefield Park in the Virginia countryside west of
Washington.
   Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., an early sponsor of the bill, said
the House may vote on the measure Aug. 10.
   The bill would allow the government to seize 542 acres adjacent
to the park where a developer has proposed a massive shopping
complex, add the tract to the 4,600-acre park, close two roads
running through the battlefield and build new roads around the park.
   Congress became involved in the dispute when Northern Virginia
developer John T. Hazel announced plans to build 1.2 million square
feet of retail space, 1.7 million square feet of office space and
560 homes next to the site of two major Civil War battles.
   Hazel's first proposal for a modest office park development
raised no community concerns, but when Prince William County, Va.,
officials relaxed zoning laws for the parcel, Hazel expanded his
development plans.
   Historians and preservationists complain that the development
site includes a bluff from which Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
commanded Southern troops in the Second Battle of Manassas.
   The tract also was the site of two field hospitals, they say.
Most historians believe that the remains of Union and Confederate
dead lie in unmarked graves on the site.
   The First Battle of Manassas, fought in July 1861, was the first
significant land battle of the Civil War. A surprising Confederate
victory there convinced Union authorities that the war would be a
protracted affair.
   More than 20,000 casualties were suffered by both sides in the
Second Battle of Manassas, which lasted over three days in August
1862. Most historians agree that Lee's triumph in that battle
represented the Confederacy's greatest victory of the war.
