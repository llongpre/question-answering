   Three congressmen said Thursday they are
striving to block federal highway money for a shopping center to be
built adjacent to a major Civil War battlefield in northern
Virginia.
   Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., has introduced language into a
supplemental appropriations bill that would prohibit federal
highway money from being used for road improvements near the
Manassas National Battlefield Park, 30 miles west of Washington.
   Developers plan to build a 1.2 million square-foot shopping mall
adjacent to the battlefield.
   Mrazek and other self-proclaimed Civil War buffs in Congress
said the project will violate the sanctity of the battlefield.
   ``The battlefield that helped shape the America we know today
should not be the sight of a Taco Bell or a Mattressland,'' said
Mrazek. ``We should not be building on top of a lot of Union and
Confederate soldiers who still lie today where they fell in
battle.''
   The battlefield is where two significant Civil War clashes were
fought, known in the North as the Battles of Bull Run, and called
the Battles of Manassas in the South.
   The first battle, fought on July 21, 1861, was the initial major
confrontation of the Civil War, and a surprising Confederate
victory helped convince Union officials that the war would be a
prolonged effort.
   The second battle, a bloody affair Aug. 29-30, 1862 that saw
24,000 casualties, was a costly victory for Confederate forces.
Union forces that had been as far south as Richmond two months
earlier were driven back into the nation's capital.
   Supporters of the development plan claim that the project will
not violate the battlefield, but Mrazek and Rep. Mike Andrews,
D-Texas, said the project will be built on the spot where
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee had his headquarters for the second
battle.
   Mrazek's amendment, passed by the House Appropriations
transportation subcommittee, would block use of federal money for
highway projects needed to improve access to the rural battleground.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said Mrazek's plan is a stop-gap
measure intended to allow the Interior Department to use money from
a special fund to purchase and protect the 600-acre land parcel.
   ``The Congress is certainly acting in the national interest, so
that this hallowed land can be saved,'' said Vento, who chairs an
Interior and Insular Affairs panel that deals with national
parklands. ``This is an awkward but necessary move.''
