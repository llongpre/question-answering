   An unknown Confederate soldier was carried
from Virginia to a new grave Sunday in a horse-drawn hearse,
accompanied by fife and drum music and about 150 people in Civil
War garb.
   Forensic scientists determined the soldier, about 20 when he
died, was from North Carolina. Scattered among his bones were five
buttons with sunburst symbols worn by Tar Heel troops during the
war.
   The soldier's remains were unearthed recently from the site of
the Cold Harbor battlefield in Virginia. A Civil War buff found the
remains with a metal detector and word reached the North Carolina
Sons of the Confederacy, which arranged to have the soldier buried
in his home state.
   About 2,000 people lined a downtown street to view the
processional.
   Fifes and drums played ``Dixie'' as members of the North
Carolina Brigade, a Civil War re-enactment group, walked behind a
horse-drawn hearse. The re-enactors had the same beards, tired eyes
and sometimes ragged clothes as Confederates in Civil War
photographs.
   Franceine Rees, a member of United Daughters of the Confederacy,
held two Confederate flags as she watched the hearse go by. On her
lapel were nine pins bearing the names of her ancestors who fought
in the Civil War.
   ``This means a lot to me because I had 25 ancestors who
served,'' she said. ``Some of them came back, some of them didn't.
Some were captured, some were tortured. All of them suffered.''
   Organizer Tom Smith, whose great-grandfather served in the Civil
War, said he was proud to be associated with the soldier's burial.
   ``There's a lot of people here and there's no hatred here.
They're simply interested in their history and past,'' Smith said.
   Civil rights groups did not protest the celebration, but the
North Carolina chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People called the event ``insensitive'' to
blacks.
   Some black bystanders agreed the parade and ceremony was a part
of history.
   ``I think it's real nice. We don't have parades like this
through here that often,'' said Ronald Davis, standing with his
family on his front porch.
