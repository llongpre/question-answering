When it comes to recreating the life and times of a 19th Century cavalry unit, 
Pat Coen and the men of his K Troop don't horse around. 
</P>
<P>
One weekend a month, they gallop up hillsides with revolvers blazing, they 
practice fancy equine military maneuvers, they gnaw homemade hardtack -- "It's 
kind of like a hard, thick matzo," Coen says -- and they generally give their 
all to ensure the Republic's manifest destiny. 
</P>
<P>
Then Coen goes back home to his wife and two daughters in Canoga Park, and his 
workaday gig as an RTD diesel mechanic. His 16 or so cohorts in K Troop return 
to their lives as machinists, technicians, engineers. For another month, 
settlers go unprotected, marauders go unchecked, and sunsets go unridden into. 
It's not a perfect system, but as Coen and company have learned in exhaustive 
detail, the Army never was. 
</P>
<P>
"You get an idea of what it was really like 100 years ago," says K Troop 
stalwart Bruce Taylor, a Simi Valley plumber who hauls an 1885 saddle, a 
working 1873 Colt .45 and assorted century-old memorabilia on K Troop 
maneuvers. "It was a rough life." 
</P>
<P>
On occasional "encampments" with other ersatz cavalry units in the Arizona 
desert, the men trudge around in regulation blue woolen uniforms and heavy 
boots that stop a regulation one inch below the knee. "Apaches" wear war paint 
in authentic patterns, made from the very roots and flowers the Indians used. 
Everybody yells a lot, shoots blanks at the enemy -- "It's a search-and-destroy 
kind of thing," Taylor explains -- and flirts with heatstroke. 
</P>
<P>
"You eat period food -- beef jerky, salt pork, if you're lucky a can of 
peaches," he says. "You sleep in an 1880s cavalry tent with nothing under you 
but a bedroll. After a weekend in the 100-degree heat wearing those wool 
uniforms, you're glad to get back to civilization." 
</P>
<P>
Their counterparts 100 years ago had no such choice. 
</P>
<P>
For decades after the Civil War, the cavalry was a haven for the unemployed, 
the illiterate, the desperate, according to contemporary accounts. Nearly half 
the troops were foreign-born. Quarters were cramped and the food was wretched. 
For years, no ammunition was available for practice. Pay was $13 a month. 
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the enlisted men in the Army are simply human driftwood, men 
who have committed crimes elsewhere and are hiding in the service under assumed 
names; men who cannot brook the liberties and familiarities of society, and 
take refuge in military discipline; men who are disappointed, disheartened and 
ambitionless, and find the lazy life of a soldier a relief," a Chicago 
newspaper reporter wrote in 1874. 
</P>
<P>
Coen, a mountain of a man who grew up on a Kansas farm, was first hooked by the 
Hollywood version of the cavalry, the square-jawed lieutenant sitting erect on 
his steed as he scans the ridge top for a row of feathers. The rest, he found 
out, is history. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was 7, I can remember thinking how great it would be to be in the 
cavalry," he says. "I grew up with Rin Tin Tin and John Wayne movies." 
</P>
<P>
His fascination with history kept growing, and, at the age of 19, he signed on 
with a Civil War unit. Then, as hobbyists swarmed into the War Between the 
States, Cohen forged ahead, concentrating on the less voguish Indian Wars. 
After research in military archives and Western libraries, he formed K Troop of 
the First Cavalry, one of about a half-dozen groups in the Los Angeles area 
that model themselves on old cavalry units. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't hear much about the First Cav," he says. "We don't get much notice. 
All the attention is focused on the Seventh, which was wiped out at Little Big 
Horn." 
</P>
<P>
Bivouacked throughout the West, K Troop took its share of lumps as well. It 
swept into California with Gen. Stephen Watts Kearny in the Mexican War, but 
was routed at the Battle of San Pascual, an engagement described by historian 
James M. Merrill as "unnecessary, poorly conceived, badly executed." In 
addition to countless Indian skirmishes, the troop suppressed poachers at 
Yellowstone National Park, and took part in an ill-fated effort to introduce 
camels to the West. 
</P>
<P>
If none of that matches Bull Run or Gettysburg for stirring the blood, it 
doesn't faze Coen. 
</P>
<P>
"The Civil War is a lot more popular," he acknowledges. "You want to do Civil 
War? You go out and get yourself a uniform and a rifle, and you do Civil War. 
This is a lot more difficult. For one thing, you need a horse." 
</P>
<P>
K Troop, which is seeking new recruits, usually mounts up at a stable in 
Newbury Park for its monthly drills, maneuvers drawn from cavalry training 
manuals of the 1870s and 1880s. 
</P>
<P>
To kick things off, Coen bellows, "Command march!" rather than the more 
inspirational but less historically correct, "Forward ho!" On patrol, the men 
ride four abreast, as prescribed in the drill manuals, not two-by-two, as in 
the movies. Their saddles sit on stitch-by-stitch replicas of the last known 
surviving cavalry horse blanket, a tattered 1885 shroud enshrined in a private 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Keeping in Period 
</P>
<P>
"We try to be as historically accurate as is humanly possible," says Coen, who, 
along with his men, peppers his speech with period slang. A dishonorable 
discharge is a "bobtail"; four years of active duty are four years "up the 
pole." 
</P>
<P>
Campfire songs for Company K are all-but-forgotten Army ditties like "O'Reilly 
Was a Soldier" and "General Jake." Calls-to-arms are played by company 
trumpeter Mike Winters, a Van Nuys alarm repairman who has a collection of 
horns dating to the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
"He's one of the top troop musicians in the field," Coen says. 
</P>
<P>
The public rarely gets to see all this. From April through October, other 
outfits, including the Simi Valley-based Company A, strut their stuff at Fort 
Tejon State Historic Park near Bakersfield, but Company K generally shies from 
the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Exhibition 
</P>
<P>
During one of its infrequent exhibitions recently at the Big Sky Ranch in Simi 
Valley, a soldier in full gallop speared a cabbage that was affixed to a post. 
</P>
<P>
Another shot out some balloons. The whole troop charged up a steep hill. 
</P>
<P>
Coen gave a short talk, in which he professed "tremendous respect" for 
Geronimo, who eluded 5,000 U.S. cavalrymen and 4,000 Mexican soldiers for a 
year and a half until his capture in 1886. 
</P>
<P>
He makes no excuses for the epic mistreatment of Indian tribes at the cavalry's 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
"We were the first line of the administration," he says. "We were given the 
order to enforce the will of the government, and we weren't smart enough to 
ask, is this right or wrong? We had our job to do and we went out and did it."
