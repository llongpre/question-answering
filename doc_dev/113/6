   Amid flashing sabers and swirling dust,
about 380 men on horseback staged a Civil War cavalry skirmish
Saturday as part of a three-day reenactment of the Battle of
Gettysburg on its 125th anniversary.
   It was the largest Civil War cavalry reenactment ever staged,
said Kim Holien, a historian with the U.S. Army Center of Military
History. Previously, no more than 100 horses took part in a mock
engagement, he said.
   ``Cavalry outfits don't get a chance to show their stuff very
often,'' said Nancy Niero, vice president for Napoleonic Tactics
Inc., which organized the event on 700 acres of farmland five miles
south of the actual battlefield.
   ``All you see is soldiers and dust and sabres,'' said Steve
Hopkins, a 27-year-old copy machine technician from Arthur, Ill.,
who took part in the action.
   Hopkins rode with the 1st Platoon of the 7th Illinois Cavalry, a
unit he said played Afghani freedom fighters in Sylvester
Stallone's ``Rambo III.''
   Close to 9,000 men in uniform and more than 75,000 spectators
were expected for the three days of reenactments ending Sunday with
a restaging of Pickett's charge.
   Cannons boomed, bugles sounded and pistols crackled as horses
charged and withdrew several times in Saturday's portrayal of a
cavalry skirmish on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg.
   At one point, a Confederate soldier grabbed the Union flag and
headed back toward his line. He was chased by several ``blue
coats,'' who retrieved the standard.
   ``When you go up and grab somebody else's flag, you're asking
for trouble. Some of the people get their adrenaline going a little
too high and are a little too eager to get into hand-to-hand
combat,'' said Holien, who announced the action for a local radio
station.
   One Confederate ``soldier'' who didn't give his name said men in
Union uniforms were a little rough with their sabers.
   At least two riders required hospitalization after falling from
their mounts during the fray, authorities said.
   One suffered a fractured skull and another had a leg injury,
said Roseann McGlade, nursing supervisor at Gettysburg Hospital.
   She said the hospital treated about 24 other reenactors Saturday
morning with problems ranging from heat stroke to eye injuries from
the dust to stomach pains from eating genuine Civil War food.
   Tom McCutcheon of Kennesaw, Ga., said the danger of riding a
horse in a battle reenactment is worth the enjoyment.
   McCutcheon, another member of the 7th Illinois, said he has
served in the infantry and as an artillery unit. Neither compared
to the cavalry, he said.
   ``The exhilaration of the charge. They're the biggest crowd
pleasers. We can ride the wrong way and the crowd will applaud,''
said McCutcheon, a 42-year-old saddle maker and antique dealer.
   The Battle of Gettysburg took place from July 1-3, 1863, and
cost a total of close to 50,000 dead and wounded.
   On July 3, 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee ordered Major
Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry to try to break through the Union's
line.
   Stuart came up against several Union cavalry units including one
led by Brig. Gen. George A. Custer, three miles east of Gettysburg.
   A total of 11,000 cavalry soldiers took part in the actual
engagement, Holien said.
