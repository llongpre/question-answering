   Preservationists and historians were
celebrating Friday after President Reagan signed legislation that
included a provision to block construction of a shopping mall next
to a Civil War battlefield in northern Virginia.
   ``We are pleased, grateful, elated, you name it,'' said Annie
Snyder, a Civil War buff who organized the movement to stop the
building project adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
``It's a tremendous victory, and we're awfully relieved.''
   The administration had opposed the proposal to purchase a
540-acre parcel adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park
because of its projected $60 million-plus cost, but the measure was
attached to a bill that Reagan signed amending the sweeping tax
overhaul enacted in 1986.
   Developer John T. Hazel had planned to build a 1.2
million-square-foot shopping mall, 1.7 million square feet of office
space and 560 homes on the site, but preservationists complained the
measure would violate the still-rustic sanctity of the 4,200-acre
park where two crucial Civil War battles were fought.
   Reps. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., Mike Andrews, D-Texas, and Frank
Wolf, R-Va., fashioned a plan that called on the government to
acquire the entire development tract, close two heavily traveled
commuter routes running through the battlefield and pay up to $30
million for construction of new roads around the park. The House
overwhelmingly passed the legislation in July.
   However, Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., rejected less-expensive
compromise measures and sponsored a bill identical to the House
version. After Bumpers succeeded in getting the bill through the
Energy and Natural Resources committee he serves on, the measure was
attached to the tax bill passed by the Senate.
   A key to the movement's success was a groundswell of support from
around the country, including more than 80,000 petition signatures
asking Congress to buy the land, Snyder said.
   ``It's been the most incredible grass-roots effort I've ever
seen,'' Snyder said. ``It shows when the people of the nation get
behind something, there's still a way for the little guy to win.''
   The park, west of Washington, D.C., includes the site of the
First and Second Battles of Manassas, also known as Bull Run after a
creek in the area.
   The proposed development site includes a hill from which
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee commanded his troops in a stunning
victory in the Second Manassas. Historians also have testified that
unmarked graves of Union and Confederate soldiers were scattered
throughout the site.
