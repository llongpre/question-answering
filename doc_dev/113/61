   Reports that the last Confederate widow died
last week surprised an Alabama woman who has evidence that her late
husband also fought for the South in the Civil War.
   ``I'm still here,'' said 83-year-old Alberta Martin, who married
Confederate veteran William Jasper Martin in December 1927.
   News reports, including those of The Associated Press, after the
Oct. 13 death of Daisy Wilson Cave described the Sumter, S.C.,
woman as the last surviving Confederate widow.
   But Mrs. Martin said Friday she was 21 and working in a cotton
mill when she and Martin were married at the Covington County
Courthouse in south Alabama. She said her husband was about 80 when
he died about five years later. Martin was with the 4th Alabama
Infantry in 1864 and 1865, according to the records of his stepson,
Harold Farrow of North Little Rock, Ark.
   Mildred Cook, president general of the United Daughters of the
Confederacy, said Mrs. Martin is the lone surviving Confederate
widow affiliated with her 25,000-member organization. She said
there may be other Confederate widows, although she is not aware of
any.
   Farrow's wife, Marilyn, said her mother-in-law may have been
overlooked as a surviving Civil War widow because she does not draw
a Confederate pension. After Martin died, Mrs. Martin married his
grandson, Charlie Martin, which apparently made her ineligible for
the pension.
   Mrs. Martin said she can barely remember her husband talking
about his wartime experiences.
   ``I remember him talking about moving up through the field
picking up potatoes,'' she said. ``He said they'd come across a
patch of potatoes, anything they could come across'' to eat.
   Farrow recalled attending his stepfather's funeral when he was 7
and how he and his half brother, William had to relinquish medals
the elder Martin had given them so they could be pinned on his
burial clothes.
   ``We had cherished them very much,'' Farrow said. ``I remember
crying at the time.''
