   This summer's searing heat and drought marked
in cruel fashion the 125th anniversary of the Agriculture
Department's first crop report on July 10, 1863.
   At the time, the Civil War was in full swing, with only a few
days elapsed since the North and South bled each other on the
fields of Gettysburg. And the USDA itself was a fledgling
department, created by President Abraham Lincoln just the year
before.
   Duane L. Jewell, secretary of the department's Agricultural
Statistics Board, the latest successor to the long-ago bureaucracy
that issued the first report, said the war put a damper on the
collection of crop and livestock information.
   Even so, he said in an interview, the first report was nine
pages and included a lengthy explanation of the need for such
material and the meaning of the tables.
   ``We had the report reprinted this year, and as far as I can
tell it's in the same format that was used then,'' Jewell said.
``Some of the information may be a little hard to understand by
today's standards.''
   For example, the original report did not include production
figures for any crop. The board's report issued on Aug. 11, 1988,
showed the corn crop at 4.48 billion bushels, down 37 percent from
the 1987 harvest. Soybeans, which were not reported in 1863, were
estimated at 1.47 billion bushels, down 23 percent from last year.
   Under the 1863 plan, monthly ``circulars'' were sent to about
2,000 farmer correspondents who voluntarily supplied USDA with the
requested information. It was decided that the government should
pay for the return postage.
   ``In the subjoined tables it will be seen that the questions
relate to but two matters, the amount sown in 1863 compared with
that in 1862, and the appearance of the crop in May and June,'' the
report said.
   Replies from some of the states were not as numerous as desired,
the report said. But the answers from ``the great grain-producing
states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and Iowa,
were full and satisfactory.''
   The report added: ``It is due, too, that the promptness of the
new and distant states of Minnesota and Kansas should be kindly
acknowledged, and their example commended to states much nearer to
the capital.''
   Among the specific items, the 1863 report noted that the winter
wheat crop in Nebraska Territory ``was destroyed by the winter, and
in New Hampshire much injured from the same cause.'' Otherwise, the
winter wheat crop looked pretty good in the 20 states, plus
Nebraska, that were surveyed.
   In 1863, there was also a familiar ring for today's corn farmers:
   ``This, our national crop, is reported as generally small in
size on account of the drought of the latter part of May and the
first half of June in some states, and nearly the whole of it in
others.''
   Although the Civil War caused little note in the 1863 crop
report _ except by the absence of information from the Confederacy
_ a portion devoted to wool took the secession into account.
   The U.S. sheep flock by the census of 1860 totaled more than
24.8 million head (compared with 10.8 million head on Jan. 1, 1988)
and wool production more than 60.5 million pounds.
   ``The rebel states produced 5,717,587 (sheep) of the whole
number, which must be deducted from it, as they are not now
represented in the wool market,'' the report said. ``Kentucky and
Missouri raised in 1862, 2,039,601 sheep, and the ravages of war
have destroyed largely these.''
   After some refiguring and allowing for projected annual
increases, the report concluded that the North may have had a sheep
flock of more than 26 million head and a wool clip of 79.4 million
pounds in 1863.
   Today, the whole realm of crop and livestock statistics is
handled by the department's National Agricultural Statistics
Service, or NASS, headed by administrator Charles E. Caudill.
   The agency issues more than 300 national reports and 9,000 state
reports each year, covering more than 150 crop and livestock items.
And in times of emergency, as with this year's drought, extra
efforts are made.
   Normally, reponses from about 30,000 farmers provide much of the
information for the monthly crop reports. Field surveys and other
information are collected by the agency's 44 field offices. The
information is sent to Washington for review by specialists, who
then release final estimates through the Agricultural Statistics
Board under strict security conditions.
   In preparation for the vital Aug. 10 report, Caudill said, a
special additional survey was conducted among 16,000 farmers in 28
states to help assess the drought damage.
   Also, he said, about 1,000 corn and soybean fields are inspected
to help determine acreage and yield estimates. This year, the
sample was doubled.
   But agency officials say one thing hasn't changed from 1863: to
protect farmers and consumers from speculators.
   As the 125-year-old report put it: ``Ignorance of the state of
our crops invariably leads to speculation, in which oftentimes, the
farmer does not obtain just prices, and by which the consumer is
not benefited.''
