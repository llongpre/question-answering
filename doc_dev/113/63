<LEADPARA>  Folded until recently between the pages of an 1865 book at a flea market in
northern Ohio, a one-page document bearing the signature "A. Lincoln" may be
the latest in the 16th president's Gettysburg lore.;    The document, the
second page of a two-page copy of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, was exhibited
by a Dayton, Ohio, artist and researcher last week as a previously lost
original handwritten copy of the Civil War president's speech.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There are five known copies of the Gettysburg Address written by Lincoln,
some penned after he gave the speech.;    The new copy would be the sixth, and
could possibly be the one Lincoln read from when he dedicated the Gettysburg
National Cemetery on Nov. 19, 1863.;    Lincoln was observed pulling a folded
copy of the speech from his coat before delivering it. The new copy is the
only folded one.;    In displaying the document, Lloyd Ostendorf said it had
been authenticated by Wayne Temple, the state of Illinois' chief deputy
archivist.;    But officials of the state's Historic Preservation Agency,
which is in charge of Illinois' extensive Lincoln collection, said they would
prefer the document be subjected to further authentication before lauding the
discovery.;    The back of the document is signed, "For Hon. Judge David Wills
from A. Lincoln."  </TEXT>
