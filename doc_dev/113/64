   J. Seward Johnson, whose statues are so
lifelike a security guard once shot one, envisions a down-to-earth
rendering of Abraham Lincoln for the town where the 16th president
delivered his most famous speech.
   Johnson's Lincoln will be near the town square, but on the
sidewalk instead of a pedestal - and aside a likeness of a 20th
century tourist. The tourist, dressed in slacks and a cable-knit
sweater, holds a copy of the Gettysburg Address as he listens to
the president.
   The artist, who lives near Princeton, N.J., has been
commissioned to create the statue for this rural Pennsylvania town
where Lincoln delivered the famed Civil War speech 127 years ago.
   Johnson, perched on an antique chair in the office of Civil War
scholar Gabor Boritt, said the statute is designed ``to celebrate
Lincoln's humanity, bring him off a pedestal, celebrate the
greatness of him as a human being.''
   Another purpose is ``to show that the Gettysburg Address was
still a meaningful document today.''
   The 268-word address, whose opening, ``Four score and seven
years ago,'' is familiar to millions, is regarded by scholars as
one of the most forceful and elegant speeches ever made.
   Lincoln delivered the address at a dedication of the national
military cemetery in Gettysburg on Nov. 19, 1863.
   In Johnson's artwork, Lincoln is saying something to the tourist
as he points to the nearby Wills House, where he stayed the night
before the speech.
   ``He might have been saying how uncomfortable the bed was,''
Johnson said with a laugh as he flexed his long, thick fingers.
``Whatever it is, the fellow is a little bit in awe of him.''
   Johnson hopes to have the artwork completed in time for next
November's annual Gettysburg celebration.
   A model has been on display around town for several weeks, and
the reception has been positive, Johnson said. He resisted
suggestions that he replace the tourist's sweater with a jacket,
but agreed to some minor changes.
   ``On something like this, I feel an artist has to be very
sensitive to the people who have to live with it,'' he said.
   He was commissioned for the work by the Lincoln Fellowship of
Pennsylvania, which sponsors the annual ceremony marking the
speech. The group has sought a statue honoring Lincoln for nearly
50 years.
   ``The hope has been here for a long, long time and finally we
are doing it,'' said Boritt, a professor of history at Gettysburg
College. He said the Lincoln Fellowship is trying to raise $100,000
to pay for the statue and provide a maintenance fund.
   ``We are willing to accept a dollar and we will accept
$10,000,'' Boritt said.
   The figures will be cast in bronze, but they will wear real
clothes coated with a plastic-like resin.
   Johnson's lifelike sculptures are displayed in 26 states, the
District of Columbia and several foreign countries.
   He tells countless tales of drivers who try to pick up an
umbrella-toting statue in the classic cab-hailing pose or of people
who try to strike up conversations with figures on a park bench.
   But one of his favorite stories involves the statue that was
shot by a security guard answering a silent alarm at a house in Los
Angeles. No intruder was found.
   ``It frightened the guard so much that he shot the sculpture,''
Johnson said. ``The more you can fool them, the better it is.''
