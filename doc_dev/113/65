If the result of the American civil war, or the war between the states, as
people in the south still call it, had gone another way, the history of the
world after 1865 or thereabouts would have been quite different. How
different, in what ways and whether for good or ill, no-one can tell. But if
you think about the question for a moment, you will realise that the
proposition is true: the preservation of the American union was a decisive
historical event.
It was also one of the most brutal campaigns ever fought, mixing new
technology in the north with older notions of valour and chivalry in the
south. There were more recorded casualties than in any previous war.
That is part of the background to the new piece at the Bush by the Canadian
writer, John Murrell. Democracy is one of the most cerebral plays you are
likely to see. It consists largely of a dialogue between Ralph Waldo
Emerson, the thinker, and Walt Whitman, the poet: the rationalist opposed to
the romantic. The exchanges take place near Washington as the battle rages
in Gettysburg in 1863.
Murrell writes beautifully. Emerson has a speech about war which goes on so
long that it must qualify for the Guinness Book of Records in the theatre.
Spoken by Hugh Ross, it remains riveting throughout. Describing the
aftermath of the conflict, he relates: 'Some of the boys coming home from
Gettysburg didn't even seem to recognise the name of the great battle that
they had fought.'
When he says: 'It was hell, Walt. It was hell itself', there is not even the
faintest suggestion that such words could be a cliche. This is an immaculate
performance by Ross.
The other star in Democracy is Robert Jones, who designed the set. When you
enter the theatre, the stage is concealed behind billowing red curtains.
They disappear to reveal a set of woods and wet grasses so naturalistic that
some of the audience started to show symptoms of hay fever.
This is the romanticism behind the war. Whitman has given shelter by his
pond to two young drop-outs from the conflict, one a southern deserter, the
other a dying soldier from the north.
They talk, sing and achieve a kind of harmony while the main business
remains between Whitman and Emerson.
Democracy is not a play that I would recommend to all-comers. There is too
much shouting in the first act. It could be said to have more than a share
of north American sentimentality: too much of the fondness for the pond. The
nature of the dialogue is not the most obvious subject for the theatre. Yet
under John Dove's direction I admired it enormously, and enjoyed it.
