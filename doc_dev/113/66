   Two congressmen moved Wednesday to protect a
historic Civil War battlefield, introducing legislation for the
federal government to purchase the land next to the battle site in
order to block a planned shopping center.
   The bill, authored by Reps. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., and Michael
Andrews, D-Texas, would direct the Interior Department to purchase
from a developer a 600-acre plot of land adjacent to the Manassas
National Battlefield Park, where two important Civil War battles
were fought.
   The congressmen, who are Civil War buffs, say plans for a 1.2
million square-foot shopping center would violate the battlefield
site.
   ``We've come to this conclusion because both of us feel there's
no other choice,'' said Andrews. ``Both of us are convinced that
the local developers and politicians intend to build the shopping
mall.''
   The land-purchase bill comes a week after Mrazek attached
language to a House appropriations panel supplemental spending bill
that would block any federal highway money for road improvements
associated with the shopping complex.
   The 3,800-acre Manassas battlefield, about 27 miles west of
Washington, was the site of the first significant land battle of
the Civil War in 1861.
   In a second, three-day battle in 1862, 24,000 Union and
Confederate casualties were recorded, as Union forces that had been
as far south as Richmond 60 days earlier were pushed back into the
nation's capital.
   The battles, known in the North as the Battles of Bull Run, and
in the South as the Battles of Manassas, helped convince Union
officials that the war would be a protracted affair.
   Developers originally sought to build the shopping center on a
plot of land where historians say Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
had his battle headquarters, but have met with opposition from
local preservationists.
   Last Thursday, Hazel-Peterson Companies agreed to move the
complex a short distance away, at the suggestion of Interior
Department and National Park Service officials.
   Mrazek and Andrews rejected that move.
   ``I don't think that compromise is what we're looking for at the
battlefield,'' said Mrazek, who noted that the developer has
upgraded plans for the development several times. ``I don't think
the property ought to be desecrated, and that's what we view it
as.''
   The land-purchase bill will be referred to the House Interior
Committee.
   Rep. French Slaughter, R-Va., whose district includes the
battlefield site, has not yet studied the land-purchase bill, but
would support a move to reroute roads now running through the
battlefield, he said.
   Interior Department officials were unavailable for comment on
the latest proposal.
   In addition to asking the federal government to use its right of
eminent domain to acquire the land, Andrews, a member of the House
Ways and Means Committee, said he will ask his panel to reexamine
tax breaks given to developers building near national park sites.
   ``The question is, are we really going to protect the buffer
zones around national parks,'' Andrews asked. ``This is an
egregious example of where developers have been invited in by the
local politicians.''
   Andrews said he hoped to move the bill out of committee and onto
the House floor by July.
