documentary series, Saturday won the inaugural $50,000 Lincoln Prize for his
work.;    The prize, presented by the Lincoln and Soldiers Institute at
Gettysburg College to honor scholarship on Abraham Lincoln or the war era,
"reflects a recognition that fine history need not be confined to books or to
the academy," Burns said before the awards ceremony.  </LEADPARA>
