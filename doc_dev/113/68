   A new battle is brewing at the site
of one of the South's greatest victories in the Civil War, this
time pitting federal historians trying to preserve the battlefield
against local officials who want to make the land available for
commercial development.
   The conflict centers on the battlefield where Gen. Stonewall
Jackson led 14,000 Confederate troops in a three-day siege in 1862,
eventually forcing the 12,500-man Union army to give up, the
North's largest surrender of the war.
   The battleground's location along a highway just outside Harpers
Ferry National Historical Park makes it ideal for development.
Harpers Ferry is at the easternmost tip of West Virginia, just an
hour's drive from the Washington metropolitan area and its booming
real estate market.
   National Park Service officials, however, want to preserve it as
it was during the Civil War.
   ``It all happened right there,'' said Donald Campbell, Harpers
Ferry national park supervisor. ``It's a highly significant piece
of American history _ it's certainly the most important battlefield
in the state of West Virginia.
   ``It's just inappropriate to go in there and start digging with
bulldozers. Young soldiers fought and died for their country on
that land.''
   The Jefferson County Commission, however, recently zoned the
privately owned land for high-density housing. Commission President
Garland Moore said the panel didn't see any reason to hold back the
land.
   ``The federal and the state governments own a large hunk of
Jefferson County already,'' Moore said. ``You can't keep taking
land off the tax books and expect to survive.
   ``There was a lot of Civil War activity in Jefferson County. If
we set aside every piece of land in Jefferson County that Civil War
troops fought on, we wouldn't have anything left.''
   The park service can't control what is done with land outside
its jurisdiction and therefore must appeal to the county and state
governments to fight development, Campbell said.
   ``Preserving anything is up to the people,'' Campbell said. ``If
the people want it preserved, history will be preserved. If they
don't, history will be lost. We can only raise the issue.''
   The dispute at Harpers Ferry is not the only battle over
development at a Civil War site around Washington. Plans to
construct a shopping mall outside the Manassas Battlefield National
Park in northern Virginia, site of two important battles, have
drawn strong opposition.
   Moore said the commission's zoning ruling on the Harpers Ferry
site is not necessarily permanent. ``We're certainly willing to
listen,'' he said.
   The park service and the Harpers Ferry town government already
have enacted easements sharply restricting construction in sight of
the historic town, where abolitionist John Brown conducted his
infamous raid in 1859 when West Virginia was still part of
Virginia. The town, much of it preserved in pre-Civil War
condition, is one of the state's top tourist attractions.
   ``We adopted the plan to restrict ourselves,'' said Harpers
Ferry Mayor Bill Brawley. ``The mass majority of the people like
what we have _ we don't want townhouses or apartment houses in the
town.''
   But Brawley said attempts to build in the area surrounding the
park have provoked ``a continuing battle'' between local government
and the park service.
   ``They don't want any development anywhere,'' Brawley said.
