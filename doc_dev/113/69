   More than a century after he fell in
battle, and nearly 20 years after his bones were unearthed by a
South Carolina road crew, an anonymous Civil War soldier is headed
for a hero's burial in Massachusetts.
   ``We're going to feel very good when we finally put him to rest
in his native soil. He's had a strange journey,'' said Robert
Berkeley, a member of the volunteer 12th Massachusetts Regiment and
the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry, which re-enact Civil War battles.
   Burial is scheduled for Aug. 4 at the Massachusetts National
Cemetery at Bourne.
   The soldier's origins haven't become clear since his remains
were found in the early 1970s.
   ``I'd love to know more details, but I'm afraid they've been
lost in time,'' said Larry Fudger, administrative director of
Family Court in Sumter County, S.C., and a Civil War buff.
   ``We're just at a point now where this individual, whoever he
is, whatever he died of, is a federal soldier that fought for his
country and he needs a decent burial,'' said Fudger, who takes part
in re-enactments of Civil War battles in his spare time.
   The idea of bringing the body back to Massachusetts started in
spring 1989 when Berkeley and Fudger met at a battle re-enactment.
   The modern history of the unknown soldier goes back about 20
years, when the remains were unearthed by a road crew working in
Clarendon County, S.C., Fudger said.
   The county sheriff sent the remains to a laboratory and reports
indicated the bones were those of a man between ages 19 and 21 who
had died many years before, Fudger said.
   Fragments of cloth and buttons indicated the man was probably a
Union soldier, Fudger said. It was theorized that he died during an
assault on a Confederate supply troop in the area at the close of
the war in 1865.
   ``The road they found him on is the road the Union soldiers came
down,'' Fudger said.
   Once it was determined that the sheriff did not have a murder
investigation on his hands, the remains ``just got lost in the
shuffle,'' and have been stored at a South Carolina funeral parlor,
Fudger said.
   Because many of the soldiers in the area were from
Massachusetts, local historians think the soldier most likely came
from that state, Fudger said. Further speculation is that he may
have been black, because the 54th Massachusetts, the regiment
commemorated in the movie ``Glory,'' was in the area along with
other black regiments.
   The old forensic tests didn't determine whether the victim was
black or white and no tests have been conducted since on the
remains, Fudger said.
   Fudger said he and his fellow volunteers are glad to see the
episode draw to a close.
   ``We're just trying to do the right thing by him,'' he said.
