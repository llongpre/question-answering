<LEADPARA>  Folded until recently between the pages of an 1865 book at a flea market in
northern Ohio, a one-page document bearing the signature "A. Lincoln" may be
the latest in the 16th president's Gettysburg lore.;    The document, the
second page of a two-page copy of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, was exhibited
by a Dayton, Ohio, artist and researcher Monday as a previously lost original
handwritten copy of the Civil War president's speech.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ON LINCOLN'S BIRTHDAY, A PRESENT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     There are five known copies of the Gettysburg Address written by Lincoln,
some penned after he gave the speech.;    The new copy would be the sixth, and
could possibly be the one Lincoln read from in dedicating the Gettysburg
National Cemetery Nov. 19, 1863.;    Lincoln was observed pulling a folded
copy of the speech from his coat before delivering it. The new copy is the
only folded one.;    In displaying the document on the eve of Lincoln's
birthday, Lloyd Ostendorf said it had been authenticated by Wayne Temple, the
state of Illinois' chief deputy archivist.;    But officials of the state's
Historic Preservation Agency, which is in charge of Illinois' extensive
Lincoln collection, said they would prefer the document be subjected to
further authentication before lauding the discovery.;    Ostendorf said the
document was found late last year inside a copy of the book, "The Lincoln
Memorial," by Judge David Wills, chairman of the Gettysburg dedication
ceremony.;    Four days after Lincoln's speech, Wills requested "the original
manuscript" from the president and asked him to "please append your
certificate.";    The back of the document is signed, "For Hon. Judge David
Wills from A. Lincoln."  </TEXT>
