   About 2,300 weekend soldiers in period
costumes marched back in time Sunday to restage Napoleon's last
stand, the 1815 Battle of Waterloo.
   There was much smoke but no fire, as they redid the battle on
the very site where Napoleon's Grande Armee of 70,000 suffered its
final defeat by more than 100,000 British, Dutch, Belgian, German
and Prussian troops allied under the Duke of Wellington.
   Sunday's ranks featured history buffs of all ages from the
victorious counties as well as France, the United States, Canada
and even the Soviet Union, organizers said.
   At least 80,000 spectators lined the battlefield and sat on the
Butte du Lion, a 130-foot mound topped by a lion overlooking the
farmlands near Waterloo, today a Brussels suburb, where Napoleon
lost his empire.
   They watched soldiers in 19th century uniforms on foot and
horseback moving across grassy knolls, wielding muskets, sabres and
military banners.
   The sound of cannon fire, fifes, drums and bagpipes filled the
air as the soldiers, moving shoulder to shoulder, repeated the
events of June 18, 1815.
   The battle has been revisited in previous years under the
auspices of the British Napoleonic Society, which even supplies a
Napoleon and a Duke of Wellington.
   But Sunday's show was to mark the real event's 175th
anniversary. Among the spectators was the current _ and eighth _
Duke of Wellington, Lord Arthur Valerian Wellesley.
   The festivities began Saturday with a light-and-sound show and
fireworks at the manmade Butte du Lion.
   The Battle of Waterloo is also commemorated in a number of
exhibitions in Belgian museums and in the farm houses that served
as battlefield command posts and headquarters during the fighting.
   Sunday's battle was broadcast live on RTBF, Belgium's
French-language television network. The 90-minute re-enactment
showed soldiers firing and ``dying'' in the fields that roll toward
the French border, 30 miles away.
   Of course, Napoleon lost again.
   After his first defeat in 1814, Napoleon went to the
Mediterranean island of Elba. He returned to mainland France on
March 20, 1815, rounded up an army and set out to fight the allies
in Belgium and regain his empire, whose roots lay in the French
Revolution of 1789.
   The real battle lasted a day and seemed made in Hollywood: The
bad guy might have won if not for the last-minute arrival of
Marshal Gebhard Bluecher's Prussian troops, who turned the tide for
the allies.
   Estimates of the dead at Waterloo range from 12,000 to 50,000
plus 10,000 horses. The injured numbered 40,000, many of whom were
robbed by local townsfolk and riffraff that followed armies around
Europe in those days.
   Napoleon was shipped to the South Atlantic island of St. Helena,
where he died and was buried in 1821. Years later, his body was
returned to Paris.
   The Waterloo battlefield _ an area of 1{ by 3 miles _ was named
a historic site in 1914, and urban development is banned there.
   Even so, this has not prevented a proliferation of tawdry
souvenir shops and restaurants offering ``battlefield specials.''
In recent decades, tourism has dropped sharply from a high of a
million visitors a year in the 1950s.
   Nothing reflects this more than the dilapidated building, next
to the memorial mound, which offers a 360-degree view of the battle.
