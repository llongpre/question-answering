   Bones, buttons and bullets uncovered at
recently discovered graves near the Antietam battleground in
Western Maryland are providing new details about a pivotal Civil
War battle that included the bloodiest day in American military
history.
   Researchers for the Smithsonian Institution and the U.S.
National Park Service say the graves are of four members of the
famed Irish Brigade from New York.
   The four died Sept. 17, 1862, as wave after wave of Irish
Brigade soldiers smashed against the Confederate line and were cut
down by rifle fire on a day that saw 24,000 soldiers, Union and
Confederate, fall in battle.
   Examination of a shoulder blade and teeth found in one of the
sites shows that a 45-year-old man helped lead the Union charge.
   ``This gentleman was in the front rank as the Irish brigade
tried to dislodge the Confederate troops on that day,'' Stephen
Potter, an archaeologist for the U.S. National Park Service, said
at news conference Wednesday.
   Potter said discovery of ``buck and ball'' ammunition indicates
that the Irish Brigade was not well-armed for the battle it met
that day.
   The Irishmen, he said, were carrying smooth-bore long guns
loaded to fire a marble-sized ball and two buckshot pellets.
   ``These were, in effect, combat shotguns,'' he said, that killed
best at close range.
   Based on the Confederate slugs that killed the 45-year-old New
Yorker, said Potter, the rebels were using rifled long guns that
were lethal from long distances. As a result, he said, the
Confederates were able to kill the Union troops at 200 yards, long
before the Yankees could charge to within the effective range of
their weapons.
   The burial sites were found in April by three amateur
archaeologists searching a field near the boundaries of the
federally owned battleground near Hagerstown, Md. A team from the
Smithsonian and the Park Service excavated the site and sifted tons
of clay soil to find artifacts.
   Dennis F. Frye, Park Service historian, said the Battle of
Antietam, named after the creek which flows through the grounds, is
considered by many to be pivotal in the Civil War. Though it ended
in a draw, Frye said the battle halted the South's first invasion
of the North, persuaded France and England to withhold recognition
of the Confederate government, and encouraged President Lincoln a
few weeks later to issue the Emancipation Proclamation that freed
the slaves.
   The battle also marked the first time that the Union army
retained command of a battleground after a clash with Southern
troops.
   ``It was the bloodiest single day in United States military
history,'' said Frye. ``In 12 hours of fighting, there were four
times more casualties than on D-Day,'' the Allied invasion of
Europe in World War II.
   The battle, which Confederates named the Battle of Sharpsburg _
after the nearest village _ pitted 40,000 Confederate troops under
Gen. Robert E. Lee against 46,000 troops of the Federal Army of the
Potomac, under Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan.
   Though undefeated, Lee withdrew the next day across the Potomac
River into Virginia. McClellan, who had 40,000 troops in reserve,
later was criticized for not attempting to the block the Southern
withdrawal.
   The attack by the Irish brigade came at midday. The Union troops
were sent against a Confederate line dug in along a sunken road.
Within a few hours, bodies were piled like cordwood and that small
road became known to history as ``the bloody lane.''
   Douglas Owsley, a physical anthropologist at the Natural History
museum, said the recently discovered shoulder blade showed evidence
of arthritis and that teeth from the same body were heavily worn.
This suggests, he said, that the soldier was about 45 years of age.
   ``This makes him somewhat unique,'' said Owsley, since most of
the soldiers in the Irish Brigade were young volunteers. Because of
the unusual age, he said there is a chance that the middle-aged
soldier may be identified by name.
   At the same site, researchers also found three Confederate rifle
slugs. From their position, Potter said it was obvious that the
45-year-old New Yorker was hit in the chest by all three slugs.
   The site also included a cross, a religious medal, a cuff button
bearing the New York state crest and a blouse button of the type
used by the Irish Brigade.
