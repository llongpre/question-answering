   Gov. Mario Cuomo plans a new book about
Abraham Lincoln that will translate the Gettysburg Address so
Polish school children can learn about government ``of the people,
by the people and for the people.''
   Instead of memorizing the words ``Four score and seven years
ago,'' Polish children may learn ``Osiemdziesiat siedem lat temu
...''
   Cuomo was to announce plans for the book, to be published in
English and Polish, at a meeting Friday with Lech Walesa at an
AFL-CIO-sponsored breakfast in New York City.
   Cuomo also planned to present a bust of Lincoln to Walesa,
founder of the Polish labor union Solidarity that brought sweeping
democratic reforms to his country.
   The unusual book project, for which Cuomo is writing an
introduction, stemmed from a visit this summer by a group of
teachers from Poland, the first Soviet bloc country in 40 years to
hold free elections and form a non-Communist government.
   They asked the governor how to teach their students about
democracy, and Cuomo told them to study Lincoln's writings. Told by
the teachers that there was no such work in Polish, Cuomo promised
to help correct that.
   ``A day after he found out there was no such book in Poland, he
found there was such book in this country either,'' said Cuomo aide
Harold Holzer. ``He thought we could just go out and buy the book
and have it translated.''
   Cuomo and Holzer began rounding up Lincoln scholars and money to
produce such a book. Eventually, said Holzer, more than 40 Lincoln
scholars volunteered their time. Seven are writing essays for the
book.
   Polish-born poet and novelist Czeslaw Milosz, winner of the 1980
Nobel Prize for Literature, agreed to translate the Gettysburg
Address into Polish. Holzer is hoping that the State University of
New York at Stony Brook's Institute for Translation will take care
of the rest.
   Seed money for the project came from the New York Telephone Co.,
the Forbes Foundation, the American Federation of Teachers and the
New York State United Teachers.
   The book will be published next November by Cornelia and Michael
Bessie Books, a division of Harper &amp; Row, said editor Amy Gash.
   The second chapter of what some Cuomo aides have dubbed the
``Lech-Lincoln connection'' comes Sunday when the New York Democrat
goes to Gettysburg, Pa., to be the featured speaker at ceremonies
marking the 126th anniversary of Lincoln's famous speech.
   Billing the governor's own Gettysburg address as a major speech,
Holzer said it would deal with democracy in Eastern Europe and the
question of ``who are the true heirs of Lincoln _ the Democrats or
the Republicans?''
   Cuomo's speech will come at the annual ceremony at the
Gettysburg cemetery, dedicated by Lincoln after the battle that
what was the turning point of the Civil War.
   Previous speakers have included poet Carl Sandburg and Illinois
Gov. James Thompson. Last year, U.S. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist was the main speaker.
