   David O. Dodd took his secrets to the
grave after he was hanged at age 17 for being a Confederate spy 125
years ago.
   A coded message detailing Union positions around Little Rock
after the city fell to Union troops in September 1863 was found in
his boot.
   But Dodd refused to answer questions or testify at a
court-martial.
   Dodd was convicted of spying for the Confederacy and hanged Jan.
8, 1864.
   On Sunday, Civil War enthusiasts gathered at Dodd's plot in Mount
Holly Cemetery to mark the 125th anniversary of his execution. About
40 people _ half in Civil War dress _ stood in the cold as William
W. O'Donnell of Little Rock, author of articles about Dodd,
proclaimed him the ``Boy Martyr of the Confederacy.''
   ``It's a story of unbounded courage,'' O'Donnell said.
   A crowd of 6,000, some of whom walked across the frozen Arkansas
River, witnessed Dodd's hanging near downtown Little Rock. The
execution took five minutes, and wasn't over until a Union soldier
climbed the gallows to jerk the rope, O'Donnell said.
   ``Dodd was one of the youngest ever executed as a spy,'' said
Jerry Russell, a member of the Civil War Roundtable of Arkansas.
   Dodd's fate began to unravel in late December 1863. He traveled
south from Little Rock, surrendering his pass to get through a Union
roadblock. After spending the night with a relative, Dodd headed
back toward the occupied city.
   ``The Union lines had moved out a couple of miles the next day.
Since Dodd had surrendered his pass, he couldn't get through,''
Russell said.
   ``There wasn't a real tight ring of steel around the town. He
might have gotten through with his information. If Dodd had really
been the sneaky type, he would have gone through the woods.
Apparently, he was not sneakily inclined, and thought he could go
through the roadblock.''
   The offer to betray his allies was extended to Dodd by Gen.
Frederick Steele, who, ``in his written reports, felt really bad
about it. He was very anguished over this thing, but they could not
condone spying,'' Russell said.
   Dodd also wouldn't tell why he was carrying the message, which
was in Morse code. ``Why did he do it? Why? He never told anybody,''
O'Donnell said. ``He never took the stand in his own defense. How
could a 17-year-old have so much courage to face the gallows without
trying to escape?''
   In a letter to his family on the day he died, Dodd wrote, ``I was
arrested as a Spy and tried, and Sentenced to be hung today at 3
o'clock. The time is fast approaching but thank God I am prepared to
die. I expect to meet you all in heaven. Do not weep for me for I
will be better off in heaven.''
   On Sunday, the Lord's Prayer and a 21-gun salute echoed in the
windswept cemetery. Seconds passed between each of the three volleys
as seven riflemen reloaded their black-powder weapons.
   Anthony Rushing, 26, of West Memphis, who wore a gray Civil War
coat in the ceremony's color guard, said his image of Dodd comes as
much from the heart as from the history books.
   ``He was done an injustice. I think they were trying to make an
example of him. He was a hero,'' Rushing said.
