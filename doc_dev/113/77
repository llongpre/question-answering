   The tombstones tell the story, a litany of all
of America's wars and the men who fought in them. It's not so large
as Arlington National Cemetery, but the small burial ground at the
West Point Military Academy is unmatched in its historical scope.

   A small cemetery overlooking the Hudson
River is hallowed ground for America's fighting men.
   The modest U.S. Military Academy's Post Cemetery is probably the
only burial ground that holds the graves of soldiers who fought in
every war from the Revolution to Vietnam.
   There are soldiers buried here who were killed by arrows, musket
balls, Viet Cong ambush and space capsule fires. Fifteen are Medal
of Honor winners.
   The 420-acre, 60,000-grave Arlington National Cemetery may be
more expansive and the battlefield cemetery at Gettysburg may
reflect the terrible toll of a single battle.
   But there is unmatched history and glory preserved in the
14-acre West Point cemetery, where American soldiers were being
buried 82 years before the first soldier was interred at Arlington.
   James M. Gavin, a famed and much-decorated World War II general,
was the most recent war hero to be buried here.
   Gavin, who led American paratroopers in the D-Day invasion of
Normandy, the Battle of the Bulge and aerial attacks on Nazi-held
Holland, was buried in late February with full military honors,
including an honor guard from his old outfit, the 82nd Airborne
Division.
   Gavin lies alongside such American soldiers as George Armstrong
Custer, the legendary Indian fighter killed on June 25, 1876, along
with 200 soldiers of the 7th Cavalry in the Battle of the Little
Big Horn; Gen. Winfield Scott, hero from the War of 1812 and the
commander of Union forces at the opening of the Civil War; Robert
Anderson, who defended Fort Sumter in the opening battle of the
Civil War; and astronaut Edward White, the first American to walk
in space, who died during a flash fire aboard the Apollo I space
capsule.
   ``Certainly it's got to be the most varied and comprehensive
military cemetery in the nation,'' says Stephen Grove, the academy
historian. ``With unknown soldiers from the Revolution, and people
like Gavin and Custer, it has tremendous variety and diversity.
   ``Outside of Arlington it has the most distinguished collection
of military people in the United States in one spot. It has
tremendous solemnness. Walking through the cemetery is like going
through pages of history. You come across name after name of people
you've read about.''
   The oldest grave at the cemetery belongs to Dominick Trant, a
Revolutionary War soldier who died at the fort in 1782.
   During the Revolutionary War, West Point was a crucial outpost
because it controlled traffic on the Hudson River north of New York
City. George Washington warned that the British could split the
Colonies and win the war quickly if they captured West Point. It
was West Point that Benedict Arnold plotted to turn over to the
British when he betrayed the American cause.
   With all its history and tradition, being buried at West Point
is a high honor for officers who graduated from the Military
Academy. Gavin, who called West Point his ``spartan mother,'' chose
the post cemetery over Arlington as his burial place.
   ``I think most of the family would have preferred that he be
buried at Arlington, but it was always his desire to be buried at
West Point,'' says Gavin's nephew, Col. Barrie E. Zais, who also
graduated from the Military Academy. ``He was very close to West
Point.''
   Burial is limited to West Point graduates, soldiers serving at
the academy post at the time of their death, and their immediate
family members.
