heroics fighting Sioux Indians in 1891.
   _Margaret ``Captain Molly'' Corbin, who took over a cannon after

in the Revolutionary War.
   The epitaphs provide fascinating and powerful historical
footnotes.
   The story of Thomas Selfridge, the nation's first military pilot
to die in a plane crash, is told on one tombstone. Selfridge ``gave
up his life in the service of his country at Fort Myer, Va., Sept.
17, 1908 in falling with the first government aeroplane.''
   Selfridge, a 26-year-old first lieutenant, was experimenting
with Orville Wright at the time. Selfridge Air Force Base in
Michigan is named after him.
   Walter Schulze's tragic story is told on his tombstone. Schulze,
the 138th ``aero squadron'' captain was killed on June 28, 1919, in
a plane crash in Germany as he was returning from delivering word
to the American troops east of the Rhine River that World War I had
officially ended.
   One tombstone with Chinese characters stands over the grave of
Ying-hsing Wen, a 1909 West Point graduate who went on to be a
lieutenant general in the Chinese Army.
   One of the most poignant tombstones stands over the grave shared
by 1st Lt. John A. Fera, class of 1966, who was killed two years
later in Vietnam, and his father, Maj. Milo A. Fera, who served in
World War II and Korea.
   The cost of the Vietnam War is eloquently told in row after row
of white marble tombstones in the newest section of the cemetery.
   The first of 274 West Point graduates to die in Vietnam, William
Frew Train III, is buried at the cemetery. According to the
epitaph, Train was killed in an ambush on June 16, 1962.
   A few paces away, tombstone after tombstone tells the toll of
Vietnam on a generation:
   Donald Francis VanCook Jr., graduated 1968, killed in action
1969. William F. Little III, graduated 1968, killed in action 1969.
James A. Gaiser, graduated 1968, killed in action 1969. Robert F.
