CITY SLICKERS 2 (12) Paul Weiland
ABRAHAM VALLEY (PG) Manoel De Oliveira
GETTYSBURG (PG) Roland F. Maxwell
FAUST (15) Jan Svankmajer
The curse of movie sequels is the tyranny of plot. Part one of a cine-saga
is enriched by the process of introducing characters and developing their
foibles and interplay. In part two that groundwork is done - so the
film-makers must throw down their spades and take up their scaffolding
tools. Build that narrative adventure-playground] Make the characters Do
Something] The higher the climbing-frame the better; and never mind how
silly the design, so long as there are enough 'What next?' rungs to grab the
attention.
City Slickers was a comedy about a band of urban males surrendering to
Nature on a dude cowboy holiday. No plot in particular: just a funny tale of
culture shock in cactusland. CS2 has a different feel from the start. The
humanist honeymoon is over; the Hollywood hokum is about to begin. We
imagine the opening salvoes at the story conference. 'Guys, we gotta have a
story this time round]' And then, 'Guys, we gotta bring Jack Palance back
into this pic even though he died in the first one. He won us an Oscar]'
Well, there are only two ways to bring a dead character back: as a ghost or
a twin. Slickers 2 opts for the second. Grizzled Jack plays his fraternal
double while star/screenwriter Billy Crystal re-plays Mr Menopausal of
Manhattan, whom wild horses would not drag back into the wilderness but whom
a Compelling Plot Device just might. 'Try buried treasure,' an excited
executive must have said. So they do.
Off to wildest Utah go Mitch (Crystal), Phil (Daniel Stern) and a token new
character in Mitch's brother (John Lovitz). And soon Palance is pouncing off
a rock at them. He is after the treasure as well, since it is his Pop's. He
growls; he hisses through that gargoyle mail-slit of a mouth; he generally
behaves like a great character actor required to ham it up.
Not all is lost, even though Palance is squandered. Crystal can still
deliver a mean one-liner, whether discussing brotherhood with Phil - 'I
can't believe you two are from the same gene pool,' says Phil; 'He's from
the shallow end' answers Mitch.
But mostly everyone seems dazed by the piling on of plot and of irrelevant
action sequences, including a silly stampede. Director Paul Weiland, out of
British TV commercials by one disastrous previous feature outing (Leonard
Part VI), brings little flair to the visuals and not much more to the jokes.
For true comedy you should try Abraham Valley. This purports to be a film by
Portuguese director Manoel De Oliveira, maker of those magisterial lost-love
epics Francesca and Amor Di Perdicao. But we wonder at times if it is not a
lost episode of Monty Python.
To escape the life of deranged formality she has been born into - the
sun-lanced salons, the starched dinners - our heroine Ema leads the life of
a woman inspired, as the film and the novel it is drawn from (by Agustina
Bessa-Luis) make clear, by her Flaubertian namesake.
Bovaryish, she marries a medico: 'a clever doctor, expert in phlegm' says
the voice-over narrator. Bovaryish, she has affairs, reads a lot and gets
bored amid the lovely, yawning scenery. The press-show audience gave a
sympathetic chortle when the narrator told us, after two hours of this
near-catatonic three-hour tragedy/social satire/romance, 'Ema was intent on
stepping up the pace of her life, in any way she could think of'.
Yes indeed. If only. Instead, 60 minutes later, she steps on the rotten
plank of a boat jetty and drowns in what appears to be all of three feet of
water.
Like any seraphically bad film, Abraham Valley has its seraphically good
moments. Oliveira can place a human profile against a painterly blur of
autumn colours and make it an image of searing, hieratic beauty. And he can
freeze the film for moments of meditation, when a poised landscape or
character-grouping define not just a moment but a milieu, even an epoch.
But then the film reverts to its crazed story of passion - this woman causes
cars to crash merely by standing on a terrace - and to its Loony Tunes
one-liners from the narrator. 'Ema put on a boiler suit to go mad in a motor
boat,' he intones at one point; and we are almost too dazed to savour the
line's battiness. But how else to bombard a little life into a woman who is
not so much a human being, more a carbon copy of literary heroines past: a
Flaubert parrot, shall we say, mimicking the cries of a superior creation.
Gettysburg is four and a half hours of the magnificent in hand-to-hand
combat with the mundane. It was made for American TV, so we have no big
stars: just big beards and big battles. Tom Berenger and Martin Sheen sport
the devouring face-fungus as Confederate Generals Longstreet and Lee and
Jeff Daniels is concealed under a walrus moustache as Colonel Chamberlain.
He held the yankees' flank in round one of the Civil War's bloodiest battle,
leading the bayonet charge from the hill known as Little Round Top.
Daniels shows how it should be done. Not impaling Southerners, we mean, but
holding the high acting ground. He delivers the speeches about democracy
with fearless passion; he delivers the tears as comrades die. Daniels'
piercing simplicity as an actor ends up 'holding the line' for the entire
film.
Nothing matches him. Writer-director Ronald F. Maxwell spends the first half
rooting for the North, the second hobnobbing in the Southern camp as Sheen,
Berenger and company get ready for the suicidal assault known as Pickett's
March. Hundreds of extras; serial cannons spitting smoke; and an aerial
camera weaving like a conductor's baton to Randy Edelmann's remorselessly
'stirring' music.
We are stirred. But should we not also have been shaken? The deaths are lost
in the grim abundance of clutched stomachs, unhorsed cavalrymen and
blast-catapulted bodies. We tell ourselves to be appalled. But we wait,
vainly, for the one true moment of felt and intimate horror.
Jan Svankmajer's Faust treads the city of Prague like a lost tourist in
Kafkaland. The film begins with live action, as our clerkish, woebegone hero
(Petr Cepek) threads the city's alleys and labyrinths as if they were the
mazes of his own minds. Then on dance menacing puppets, the writhing clay
creatures, the bald, hog-toothed Mephistopheles and the giant wooden mask
that disgorges mini-marionettes like Gulliver throwing up Lilliputians.
Kafka? Make that Kafka with a dash of Swift, Spitting Image and Hieronymous
Bosch. Much of Faust is appallingly funny; most of it is inspirationally
surreal; and some of it is a touch laborious, as we would expect when a
short-film genius goes to feature length. Wit and vision, though, are rare
enough in the movie world: we are not about to send them back even when they
are thinly spread.
