   The kickoff Friday of the 125th
anniversary observance of the Battle of Gettysburg thrilled Allen
Nelson for a very personal reason: His father fought in it.
   Nelson, 70, a retired career Army officer, drove in from
Sanford, Fla., for the ceremonies. He wore the uniform of a Union
colonel as he watched mock soldiers pass in review to mark the
start of the battle, which was fought here July 1-3, 1863.
   His father, Pvt. George H. Nelson, fought with the 2nd Vermont
Volunteers at Gettysburg and later was wounded in the Battle of the
Wilderness in Virginia.
   Nelson, whose father was in his 70s when he was born, was the
only known first-generation descendant at the national park, where
what many historians view as the central battle of the Civil War
took place.
   The opening event drew only about 1,000 spectators, well below
park officials' estimates that 20,000 or more visitors would be at
the battlefield for each day of the anniversary.
   Last weekend, more than 100,000 visitors attended a three-day
re-enactment of the battle on private property several miles from
this Adams County community.
   ``I do think that a lot of people think last week was the actual
anniversary,'' said Bob Moore, the battlefield park's media
director. ``I think some people mistakenly thought that once the
events of last week were over, that that was the end of it.''
   The first day's schedule mirrored the first day of the battle.
Not much happened.
   But just as the fighting intensified on the second day and
reached its climax with the Union victory on the third, the pace of
events will pick up Saturday and Sunday, with a symbolic exchange
of battle flags, a dedication of the newest monument at the
battlefield and a relighting of the Eternal Peace Light Memorial.
   ``Obviously, Friday and Saturday are when the people are
hopefully going to be here,'' Moore said.
   The last time there were overflow crowds in Gettysburg was 1938,
the 75th anniversary of the clash between Union and Confederate
troops. That was the last major reunion of soldiers who fought here.
   Nelson was here then with his father, who was in his mid-90s. He
remembers touring the battlefield and being able to envision what
happened.
   But he said he didn't hear much about the battle from his father
or the other veterans.
   ``He didn't talk too much about it,'' said Nelson. ``Most of the
veterans wouldn't talk too much about it. I guess they wanted to
forget.''
   Those who turned out Friday were quickly gripped by the
fascination of the once bloody ground, later the scene of Abraham
Lincoln's famous Gettsyburg Address.
   ``We've come a long way to see this,'' said Londoner John
Funnell. ``It's fantastic.''
   His wife, Betty, agreed, but said she was still hoping for one
more thrill at Gettysburg.
   ``I would like to see something like Rhett Butler,'' she said,
referring to the dashing character in ``Gone With The Wind.''
