   The U.S. Armed Forces affixed new ribbons
to their flags Thursday to mark the Panama invasion, which
President Bush said had joined `'the roll call of glory, the roster
of great American campaigns.''
   He listed: ``Yorktown, Gettysburg, Normandy, and now Panama.''
   Bush said the new streamers were ``most of all'' for the 23
soldiers killed in the invasion, which ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   At the ceremony, Bush joined top generals and admirals in a
darkened hall where spotlights played on nearly 200 soldiers,
sailors, airmen and Marines standing at attention, bearing
bayonets, rifles and the flag of each state and territory.
   The honors began with the roar of a 21-gun salute from cannons
outside the Ceremonial Hall that doubles as the base gymnasium.
   It ended with the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, in colonial
garb, marching off after the Army Band played the anthems of all
four services.
   ``We're here today to add another campaign streamer to the roll
call of glory, the roster of great American campaigns _ Yorktown,
Gettysburg, Normandy and now Panama,'' said Bush.
   The flag honors those ``who died in the defense of liberty ...
and that is why I am determined that the American flag will be
consecrated, not desecrated,'' said Bush, who supports the idea of
a constitutional amendment to make flag-burning illegal.
   The flags borne by an honor guard from the Army, the Navy, the
Air Force and the Marines already carry dozens of multicolored
streamers, each signifying a different war or engagement, from the
Revolutionary War to the Civil War to Vietnam and Grenada.
   The Panama campaign streamer was the 169th ribbon affixed to the
Army flag; the 13th for the Marine flag; the 19th for the Navy and
the 78th for the Air Force.
   ``Panama was another chapter in a great epic, an act of free men
and women in the Revolution of '89, a revolution that also swept
the East and is now sweeping the globe,'' said Bush.
   ``The revolution continues. The people have spoken in Nicaragua.
When they speak in Cuba and Haiti, our Western hemisphere will be
entirely within the compass of freedom,'' he said.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said, ``With the presentation of these streamers, the campaign in
Panama is now part of the glorious tradition of our nation and its
armed forces.''
   ``For as long as the Stars and Stripes flies over this nation,
the actions of the men and women who helped to restore democracy to
Panama ... will be remembered,'' said Powell.
