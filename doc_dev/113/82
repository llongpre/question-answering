<LEADPARA>  THE BUSH administration and Congress have expressed strong opposition to the
Soviet government's repressive policies in the independence-seeking Baltic
republics. An imaginary press dispatch relating an event that did not but
could have happened might illuminate how the Soviets may feel about U.S.
statements.;    The fictional dispatch is based upon some facts. Russia's
liberal Czar Alexander II issued a ukase emancipating the Russian serfs in
February 1861. President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation declared the
slaves in the rebellious states freed on Jan. 1, 1863. In 1863, a Russian
fleet visited New York and San Francisco in a gesture widely interpreted as
support for the North. The imaginary event followed a year later. Here is the
fictional news story describing it:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     WASHINGTON, Oct. 1, 1864 -- Czar Alexander II of Russia today sharply
criticized the Union Army's devastation of Atlanta, Ga., warning the North
that, if such practices continue, "the imperial Russian government will have
to reconsider its support.";    In a message directed to President Abraham
Lincoln, the czar said that he appreciated the difficulties of the Civil War
but that these did not justify the "unnecessarily harsh and inhumane treatment
of innocent people in your state of Georgia by the Union Army.";    Alexander
reminded Lincoln that Russia had freed its serfs three years ago and added:
"When the United States followed our example a year later and put an end to
Negro slavery, we began to have high hopes for the development of humane
forces in North America.;    "Even when it became apparent at the terrible
battle of Gettysburg that the loss of life necessary to preserve your union
would be excessive, Russia continued to support your government. As a result,
we sent our naval forces to both New York and San Francisco in a show of
solidarity with the United States of America at the same time that many people
of the British Isles were supporting the Confederate States of America.;   
"However," the czar added, "we must voice our strong disapproval of the
unnecessarily harsh and inhumane treatment of innocent people in your state of
Georgia by the Union Army. We understand the desire of the Washington
government to bring the American states back together. But there are limits to
the human price that is acceptable.;    "It is our earnest hope," the czar's
message concluded, "that the Washington government will realize that should
there be a repetition of such brutal actions as those carried out by Gen.
Sherman in Georgia, and especially in the city of Atlanta, the imperial
Russian government will have to reconsider its support and to consider ways
and means of providing assistance to those damaged by your government's
extremist policies.";    The White House immediately denounced the czar's
message as "gross interference in our internal affairs." Although there was no
direct response from Lincoln, a White House spokesman said: "While we have
appreciated indications of Russian support in the past, we reject absolutely
this unseemly effort to interfere in what is entirely an American concern. If
the czar wishes to help promote freedom in North America, he would be well
advised to keep out of our affairs.;    "That the czar has not done so," the
White House spokesman continued, "not only is a violation of the basic norms
of international relations, but also shows a deplorable lack of understanding
of the currently complicated situation in the United States. We will again
become a united nation, with or without the support of Russia. And future
American-Russian relations will be adversely affected if there is a repetition
of interference in our affairs.";    As stated above, this news story is
imaginary, but it could have happened. That it may be pertinent in view of
American official protests about Soviet actions in the Baltic republics is not
to suggest that the situation in the Baltics and Sherman's march to the sea
are identical. But it does suggest the problems of basing foreign policy
positions on national moral values. (box)  </TEXT>
