<HEAD>Couple About to Become Great-Grandparents Reflects on the Past</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   My wife, Virginia, and I were born in the 1920s.
She never had a glimpse of her grandparents. I have vague
recollections of one _ my mother's father, who died when I was 5.
   Now Susan and Michael Springer of Canyon Country, Calif., have
anounced we are to become great-grandparents. After the spontaneous
outrush of joy, the full implication of the aging of America
smashed in. And if two kids who began dating in high school get the
chance, what lasting impression do Virigina and I want to leave
with our first great-grandchild?
   My reporter's instincts always have been tantalizied by the
lives of my grandparents. If only I could have interviewed them.
   Anders Valter (the name was changed to Andrew Walters at Ellis
Island) was 39 when he left Sweden in the 1880s with a wife and
three daughters (Two children were born in this country, including
my dad). I have the 15-inch jardiniere grandmother Mathilda brought
with her. What would induce her to take such an impractical but
beautiful, piece of porcelain in the 10 cubic feet of steerage
luggage allowed the family? Did my grandfather know before they
left?
   Anders Erikson, my maternal grandfather who became Andrew W.
Ericson, came alone from Sweden about the same time. I have his
contract of passage. He paid $35.74 in U.S. currency. For that he
was assured he would sail in steerage by way of England to New York
City and be carried by train to Porter, Ind., all this ``with good
and sufficient food and hotel accommodations where called for.''
   In 1892, he won a gold medal at the World's Fair. I have a
postal card, apparently as mass advertisement, showing him and his
``refrigerator,'' an ornate box using ice for the coolant.
   His wife, Emma, was born at Porter. Her death, at 42, rated a
long front-page story in the daily newspaper at Michigan City,
Ind., where the Ericsons and Walters then lived. But the story,
also among my possessions, says only that she was known for many
good works in the community, without specifying.
   When our parents were born around the turn of this century, life
expectancy was about 50 years. Today it's 75. Many chldren know
their grandparents, some their great-grandparents.
   However, the mother of Virginia's mother died from complications
of childbirth. The father died a few years later. My future
mother-in-law was raised by relatives. Those three events were
common at that time. My wife's father immigrated from Poland.
Virginia remembers receiving small packages of Polish hard candy
once a year from her grandmother until World War II began. Nothing
afterward.
   Virginia's dad was fluent in eight languages, including Russian,
German and Polish. In Indiana, he managed a factory. But he was
vague about Poland and the reason for his linguistic skills. Was he
involved in revolutionary activities and had to flee for his life,
as a relative later told me?
   Except for vital statistics such as birth, marriage and death
records, that's about all I can tell my grandchildren _ three boys
and three girls _ of their great-grandparents. Will my
great-grandchild want to hear my stories? I can hardly wait.
   Actually, my own great-grandad may have warned me against
smoking marijuana. I'm going to check courthouse records to see if
I can find out when I visit Indiana later this summer. As a
youngster, I went to Porter often to visit ``Grandpa Swanson.'' My
grandmother Emma's maiden name was Swanson, so he could have been
her father. He couldn't have been my grandfather. Family lines were
blurred in those days, and most of us had dozens of ``aunts'' and
``uncles.''
   Once in a while he would tell stories about the Civil War or
Indians. On rare occasions he would take a troop of youngsters for
short walks. On one he pointed to a weed growing alongside a ditch
on his farm and said something like this:
   ``Years ago, when the Pottawatomie Indians lived around here,
they would sit around their evening campfire and some would smoke
this. Now I know you boys and girls are going to try smoking
sometime. It's not a good idea. But if you do, stick to cornsilks
and tobacco. The Indians who smoked this stuff would go real
crazy.''
   Maybe it was because his delivery was so impressive. Maybe we
were so impressionable. But so far as I know, none of us ever tried.
   A Swedish immigrant, he also told of fighting with the Indiana
volunteers at Gettysburg, arriving by forced march on the third day
of the battle.
   ``There were bodies in blue and gray uniforms all over,'' he
said. ``The smell was terrible. The flies came from miles away,
thousands of them. The Army fed us hardtack spread with honey. At
first we tried to pick them off, but two would land for every one
we picked off. Finally, we gave up and ate it, flies and all.''
   Years later, I went to Gettysburg and stood where he must have
been. It was beautiful and peaceful. But in my mind all I could see
where hungry soldiers eating fly-covered honey and crackers.
   I never have been sure of his first name. But each Fourth of
July, when I was a boy, he would dress in his blue uniform and ride
at or near the head of the local parade. Once, at the cemetery, I
saw tears flood down his cheeks when the bugler played taps.
