   Colleges have tried many tactics to
attract capable minority students and make them feel welcome:
offered special scholarships, started support groups, hired
counselors, overlooked low test scores.
   At Gettysburg College, they're about to try genealogy.
   Starting in March, this Lutheran-affiliated liberal arts school
where just 40 of 1,850 students are black is opening an
``intercultural resource center'' where all students, but especially
African-Americans, can learn how to research their family roots.
   The two-story wood-frame center, when it is officially dedicated
at a March 18 ceremony, will coordinate a campus-wide effort to help
minority students develop self-awareness and confidence.
   The ultimate aim: to break down the sense of isolation blacks
often feel on this campus, help them be part of the mainstream and
eventually use their self-awareness to strive for leadership roles.
   Already, the center's bookshelves are packed with state census
records from 40 states dating back to the early 1800s. Thick brown
volumes contain ship passenger and immigration lists dating back to
the 18th century. There are also genealogy guides for Germans,
I.
   The new Gettysburg center is unusual on several counts. Probably
no other school so small has focused such attention on
African-American genealogy, according to James Dent Walker, a
founder of the Washington-based Afro-American Historical and
Genealogical Society. The much larger Temple University in
Philadelphia houses the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American collection
which contains over 40,000 items.
   Second, Gettysburg pointedly chose not to name it an
``Afro-American Center'' or ``Black Student Center,'' as many
colleges have. The idea was to have a place on campus celebrating
all cultures.
   Finally, Gettysburg may be the first college to view genealogy as
a vehicle for recruiting and retaining minority students.
   That strategy may lack the glitz or quick-fix appeal of setting
numerical minority recruitment goals or quotas as other colleges
have, but Gettysburg never did.
   But Matthews says he has already used his approach successfully
as a minority counselor at two other predominantly white campuses,
Northern Michigan University and the affiliated Hobart and William
Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y.
   Now he confidently predicts: ``Gettysburg will end up with a name
across the United States, as a place for the advancement of
African-American and other minority students.''
   Yet Gettysburg seems hardly the most fertile place for an
innovative approach to black student recruitment, despite its
location adjacent to the Civil War battlefield where Abraham Lincoln
delivered his address that became an anthem in the history of race
relations.
   College guides such as the ``Yale Insider's Guide'' have
described Gettysburg's students as ``all alike,'' and ``white and
upper middle-class.''
   The descriptions are ``all too true,'' admits president Charles
Glassick.
   Black students here say that while seldom the target of overt
racism, they often feel shunned and isolated.
   ``Most students here never interacted with blacks, and at
Gettysburg it's possible to avoid that,'' said Michael Warren, a
22-year-old senior majoring in African-American studies.
   ``We were frankly interested in enrolling more minority students.
So we brought in Harry Matthews,'' said Glassick.
   Well under 100 blacks were applying to Gettysburg each year, and
the retention rate of those who attend had been ``abominable,'' said
Glassick. The rate was 46 percent in the 1970s, though that has
recently improved to around 73 percent.
   Even with warm backing by the president and trustees, Matthews'
arrival at Gettysburg in 1985 was not greeted with universal joy.
   ``Did I feel welcome? Hell, no. It was a challenge,'' he told a
visitor.
   ``Some in the faculty and administration were looking for a more
radical guy,'' he said. Some called the conservatively-dressed,
soft-spoken Matthews an ``Uncle Tom.'' Others wondered aloud why
Matthews and his ideas were worth scarce college dollars when they
seemed geared to so few students.
   But when the college spent $450,000 to purchase the building that
eventually housed the center, it became clear to all that the
center, and Matthews, were here to stay.
   Matthews says he faced the same jolting transition that other
black college students often find so trying. He grew up in
Roosevelt, Long Island, a New York suburb where the public schools
are mostly black. He wanted to attend historically black Fisk
University but wound up at the mostly white State University of New
York at Oneonta where financial aid was more generous.
   In 1977, the popularity of ``Roots,'' the book and television
miniseries by Alex Haley, sparked Matthews' passion for genealogy.
``When ``Roots'' came out, I made a pledge to trace my family before
I had children,'' he said, a vow he has kept.
   Eleven years of subsequent research led him to discover ancestors
dating back to the American Revolution. He believes his oldest
ancestor was a freedman known as Isaac the African who served in the
3rd Regiment of South Carolina.
   The resource center will only be the starting point for such
research, however. Students wanting to delve deeply into their past
will still have to go to the National Archives in Washington, talk
to relatives, check state and county records of births, retirement
records, marriage certificates and property deeds, just as any
genealogist would. Eventually, Matthews hopes, the center will
sponsor trips to archives in Washington and elsewhere.
   Genealogy is especially formidable for blacks. Census data are
only helpful back to 1870. It's almost impossible for most blacks to
discover their ancestral ``Kunta Kinte,'' the character in ``Roots''
captured in Africa and brought to America on a slave ship.
   What may be possible, though difficult, is to trace lineage
before 1870 by studying white slaveholding families.
   With black genealogy, said Matthews, ``you just can't get around
white folks. It's the only way.''
