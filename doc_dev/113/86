   Like any good American politician, Soviet
Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov knew what to do when he finished his
private talks in the Oval Office with President Bush.
   Yazov strode out the West Wing doors, past the ever-present
Marine guard, and marched right up to the bank of cameras and
microphones in the driveway Tuesday to offer a personal message of
peace to the American people.
   ``The Soviet people are cherishing the best sentiments and
feelings toward the Americans,'' said the burly, beribboned general.
   ``We were comrades at arms during the Second World War and we
succeeded in winning a great victory. And now we have no grounds,
no reason whatsoever, to go into confrontation (against) each
other.''
   The Soviet general is touring the United States as the guest of
his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   His meeting with Bush was delayed for a half-hour as the
president received an intelligence briefing from national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft on the attempted coup in Panama.
   Bush learned only after the 30-minute session with Yazov that
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's forces apparently had prevailed.
   Reporters were allowed to witness the opening moments of Bush's
meeting with Yazov, and the president broke from his customary
practice by fielding two questions about the coup. Bush
emphatically denied it was ``some American operation.''
   The president asked Yazov to ``pay my respects to President
Gorbachev,'' and said recent talks with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze were ``very fruitful.''
   ``We are satisfied. We've got some problems still,'' Bush said,
but ``things are moving in the direction we wanted.''
   Out on the driveway, Yazov gave a ringing endorsement of the
U.S.-Soviet rapprochement.
   ``The main point of my discussions with the U.S. president was
the question of arms control, the question of reducing conventional
armed forces and weapons and the question of promoting a
relationship between our two militaries and our two nations.''
   Asked if his meeting with Bush had advanced the prospects for an
arms pact, Yazov smiled and said, ``Well, I don't think I could
really assure success at the negotiations within half an hour.''
   But he added, ``Our negotiating teams are working in Geneva. I
think we are moving forward step by step to the ultimate conclusion
of agreements on the questions. Anyhow, we are counting on
progress.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said afterward that
Bush had ``reiterated his support for perestroika,'' and expressed
hope for early agreements on conventional forces in Europe and on
chemical weapons as well as nuclear arms.
   Yazov displayed no pique at being left to cool his heels in the
Cabinet Room and then having events in Panama intrude on the Oval
Office meeting.
   Asked about Noriega, he replied diplomatically.
   ``I am not prepared to talk on the issue because I am not aware
of what happened in Panama. ... We have not talked about it at
all.''
   Yazov said he and Cheney hoped to reach agreements on further
steps to promote U.S.-Soviet military exchanges and ``a whole
program ... designed to promote better understanding between our
two militaries and between our peoples.''
   Earlier, Cheney took Yazov, a Civil War buff, to see the
Gettysburg, Pa., battlefield where Union troops repulsed Gen.
Robert E. Lee's Confederate soldiers in a turning point of the war
between the states.
   Yazov's itinerary included stops today at Camp Pendleton, a
Marine training base in Southern California; Luke Air Force Base in
Arizona on Thursday; and Fort Bragg, N.C., on Friday. He will
return to the capital Friday for a news conference with Cheney.
