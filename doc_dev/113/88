   Sen. Paul Simon, facing the pivotal battle of his
presidential campaign, accused Democratic rival Michael Dukakis on
Saturday of trying to buy the Illinois primary with TV commericials.
   The Simon campaign, already cash-poor, also was buffeted by the
results of a new poll showing the Illinois senator's support
slipping in his home state just three days before the election.
   He also lost key newspaper endorsements _ to Dukakis in the
Chicago Sun-Times and to Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. in the
Chicago Tribune.
   Still, Simon pressed on, enlisting three congressional allies
from industrial states with pending primaries to push his theme
that the post-Super Tuesday campaign marked the start of a second
phase in the nominating process.
   Simon attacked the Massachusetts governor for a new television
advertising assault that Simon's campaign views as a swipe at their
candidate.
   ``You ought to win an election _ not buy an election,'' Simon
said at a news conference at De Paul University.
   The Dukakis ads do not name Simon but criticize his strategy of
remaining in the race until the Democratic convention in July in
hopes of being the consensus candidate in a brokered nomination.
   Simon said he will not respond with his own television
commercials.
   ``Whatever decision the people of Illinois make, I urge that you
not sell your heritage for a 30-second commercial,'' Simon said.
``The question Illinois voters must ask themselves is not who has
the slick commercials, but who can best represent us in the
presidency.''
   U.S. Rep. Stephen Solarz, campaigning for Simon in Chicago, said
the Illinois primary would be either ``the political equivalent of
Custer's last stand or the Battle of Gettysburg'' for Simon.
   ``I trust and hope that for Paul Simon the Illinois primary on
Tuesday will be the political equivalent of the Battle of
Gettysburg, marking the turning point in the campaign leading to
his ultimate nomination at the (Democratic) convention,'' Solarz,
D-N.Y., said.
   But the Sunday editions of the Chicago Tribune brought bad news
for the Simon campaign. Simon shrugged off the paper's endorsement
of Gore, but the poll results showed further erosion in his support
among registered Democratic voters.
   In the poll of 501 Democrats, 35 percent supported Simon, 30
percent favored Illinois' other favorite son, Jesse Jackson, and 18
percent liked Dukakis.
   The results made the race essentially a dead heat between Simon
and Jackson because the poll, conducted March 9 and 10, has an
error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
