   It's the battle of Devil's Den, pitting
tourist convenience against the National Park Service's desire to
curtail traffic through the Gettysburg battlefield.
   The park service has proposed eliminating two access roads, as
well as part of a third, to the historic Devil's Den area of the
Pennsylvania battlefield.
   The idea is to move the battlefield closer to its original
appearance and to halt an erosion problem at Devil's Den, an area
of huge rocks that is a popular tourist spot, National Park Service
spokesman Robert Davidson said Wednesday.
   The debate moved here last week when Rep. Bill Goodling, R-Pa.,
presented to park service Director William Penn Mott a petition
containing signatures of more than 11,000 people who oppose the
plan.
   Mott has agreed to personally inspect the site as part of a
review of the plan, according to park service spokesman George
Berklacy.
   ``There was a road constructed in about 1904 during a period
when people were visiting on horses and buggies,'' Davidson said.
``Since then, the response to more and larger vehicles has been
more pavement, and we just feel that the time has come to take a
new direction.''
   But the Devil's Den Access Committee brought maps and a slide
show last week to document their concerns to the park service that
the plan would be counterproductive.
   Phil Cole, a battlefield guide who heads the citizen protest,
said Wednesday that he fears people would have to walk to Devil's
Den from a planned new parking lot that may be too small to
accommodate visitors.
   The walk is three-quarters of a mile, round trip.
   ``People are not all joggers or athletic. Plus, there is
inclement weather, and hot days,'' he said.
   Traffic, he said, will be diverted to other roads that will
become more congested.
   An access road would be made available so that the disabled
could be driven to the site, the park service said.
   The Gettysburg National Military Battlefield has been holding
events to mark the 125th anniversary of the bloody Civil War battle
on July 1-3, 1863. Some 50,000 Union and Confederate soldiers were
killed or wounded on the battlefield, later the scene of Abraham
Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address.
