   Torn and bloodstained from battle,
regimental flags that led Union soldiers into the breach at
Gettysburg and Antietam face a new fight against the ravages of
time, say museum curators trying to save them.
   Many of the 30 silk banners at the Civil War Museum and Library
here remain rolled around their poles, as they were at the end of
the Civil War in 1865, with little protection against aging.
   Some of the flags were wrapped with paper about 15 years ago to
preserve them, but acids in the paper apparently foiled that
effort. When several were gingerly unfurled last month for the
first time since then, some turned to dust or broke apart.
   ``To me they are sacred. ... They are symbols of the ultimate
sacrifice and love of country,'' said Andy Waskie, a member of the
Grand Army of the Republic, a group of descendants of Union
veterans which operates the museum.
   Some of the 6-by-6{-foot banners have the names of battles
written or sewn on them, and many bear patriotic symbols, such as
an eagle bearing swords in its claws.
   Many of the flags were scarred in war; some bear bullet holes
and others are stained with blood.
   Some had their centers cut out, presumably by color sergeants
who carried the flags in battle and wanted a souvenir, according to
Elmer Atkinson, president of the GAR and great-grandson of three
Union soldiers.
   ``It was a great honor to be the color sergeant. Most of the
time he wouldn't live too long. (The flag) became more or less
personal property to them,'' he said.
   Many flags were hand-painted, a practice that has contributed to
their decay, Atkinson said. Acids in the paint have slowly
dissolved the silk over the years.
   The museum is talking to textile experts on how to prevent
further deterioration, he said. Richard A. Sauers, a restoration
expert involved in a similar effort to preserve 315 Civil War flags
stored under glass in the capitol rotunda in Harrisburg, is also
advising Atkinson.
   Preservation techniques include laying the flags flat in
acid-free paper or plastic, Atkinson said.
   At a minimum, the GAR hopes to stop the decay, which would cost
about $1,000 per banner, he said. Attempts to restore them would
cost much more.
   When the colors are unfurled, it will be in a vacuum with
increased humidity ``to try to bring some life back into the
silk,'' Atkinson said.
   ``There's no way to get them back to hanging off poles again,''
he said.
   The GAR is considering different ways to raise the money, but
won't decide until the total cost of preserving the banners is
known, he said.
   The flags were authorized by the state government at the start
of the Civil War in 1861. The state raised 215 regiments, which
were organized along county lines.
   Many of the flags were returned to the state at a July 4, 1866,
parade in Philadelphia. The state wanted the flags back in case
regiments had to be raised again, Atkinson said.
