   House members on Tuesday vowed to increase
efforts to prevent construction of a massive shopping center
adjacent to the Manassas National Battlefield Park.
   ``We're really a case of last resort here,'' Rep. Mike Andrews,
D-Texas, told a House panel. ``We're either going to save the
battlefield, or let a developer literally put one of the nation's
biggest shopping malls right next door.''
   ``I'm interested in coming up with a policy for these matters,''
said Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., who chairs the Interior and Insular
Affairs subcommittee on national parks and public lands. ``The
preservation of resources is a priority of the National Park
Service.''
   Congress became involved in the development dispute after local
opponents of the project charged that government officials and
builders in Prince William County, Va., tricked them by first
proposing a small office park and then switching to a 1.2 million
square foot mall.
   The battlefield, located 27 miles west of Washington, D.C., was
the site of the first significant land battle of the Civil War. A
surprising Confederate triumph in that 1861 fight helped convince
Union leaders that the war would be a protracted affair.
   The second battle, fought over a three-day span in August 1862,
saw a bloody, decisive Confederate victory that set the stage for
Rebel attacks on the North.
   The present fight centers around a 542-acre tract adjacent to
the federally run park where developers first proposed building the
mall. They agreed to move the mall some 600 feet after historians
noted that a hill in the middle of the disputed land was the site
from which Gen. Robert E. Lee directed Confederate forces in the
second Battle of Manassas.
   That single concession, however, has not satisfied opponents,
who charge that the construction of a mall that large will forever
destroy the sanctity of the still-rural area where 20,000
casualties were recorded in the second contest.
   Andrews and Rep Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y., have introduced
legislation that would direct the Interior Department to purchase
the disputed tract and add it to the park, while Rep. Frank Wolf,
R-Va., has proposed that Congress buy the land directly, a faster
move than waiting up to 10 years for the federal agency to act.
Both measures would also close roads now running through the
battlefields.
   Wolf also wants the federal government to pay for construction
of new highways around the 4,600-acre battlefield park, which
Virginia state highway officials say would cost $101 million.
