<TEXT>
<P>
Like some rusty bayonet or tattered battle flag hidden away in the attic, the 
Elmira prison camp is an all-but-forgotten relic of the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the human suffering involved, maybe memories of the prison, which 
opened 125 years ago this month, are best left undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a flagpole, a small monument and two stone markers, there's nothing 
in the quiet Elmira neighborhood where the prison camp once stood to mark its 
presence. But buried beneath tidy rows of white headstones and shade trees at 
the Woodlawn National Cemetery are the remains of 2,973 Confederate soldiers 
who died at Elmira, many from starvation. 
</P>
<P>
The Confederacy's Andersonville prison in Georgia is remembered as the most 
infamous example of the inhumanity and deprivations of the Civil War, even 
though records show that a soldier imprisoned in Elmira stood little better 
chance of surviving than did one in Andersonville. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Death Camp?' 
</P>
<P>
Questions linger over whether those 2,973 Rebels died mainly because of the 
primitive state of medicine and sanitation during the Civil War, or whether 
they were victims of the Lincoln Administration's retaliatory neglect of some 
prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
"Can one say that, by design, this was a death camp?" asked J. Michael Horigan, 
an Elmira history teacher who spent much of the past year researching records 
from Civil War prison camps in Washington, D.C., and in the South. "I think one 
can say it, but you can't document it. The records on this camp are very 
incomplete. But circumstantial evidence certainly makes it look that way." 
</P>
<P>
Union officials ordered in May, 1864, that a complex of barracks at Elmira that 
had been used for three years to house Union soldiers be converted to a prison 
camp for captive Southerners. A 12-foot-high fence was immediately thrown 
around a 30-acre portion of barracks. 
</P>
<P>
There were 35 wooden buildings in the complex, each about 100 feet long and 16 
feet wide. Union officers in Elmira wrote the War Department that the barracks 
could accommodate 3,000 men comfortably and 1,000 more in a pinch. 
</P>
<P>
Orders came back from Washington that 10,000 men were to be housed in the camp. 
Men not lucky enough to get places in barracks would sleep in tents. Wooden 
barracks weren't constructed for all the men until well after winter had set 
in. 
</P>
<P>
On July 6, 1864, a train pulled into Elmira with the first 399-man contingent 
of prisoners on board. 
</P>
<P>
It was a ragged group of prisoners. Most had been captured during the grinding 
battles of the Wilderness in Virginia. Elmirans noted that their ragtag 
uniforms hardly made the men look like members of the same army. Some prisoners 
wore only shirts and underwear. Many had no shoes. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Grisly Beginning 
</P>
<P>
Things went wrong at the prison camp almost from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
On July 15, a train loaded with 844 Confederates and 128 Union guards bound for 
Elmira smashed head-on with a coal train near Shohola, Pa. Many of the wooden 
cars were reduced to kindling in the accident, which killed 49 prisoners and 17 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
Five prisoners escaped during the chaos, and it took three days for some of the 
wounded to receive medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fouled Pond 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inside the camp, a peril just as lethal, although slower in its 
effect, was taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
A stagnant body of water, called Foster's Pond, was within the fences of the 
prison. With so many men being sent to the camp -- there would be more than 
4,400 by the end of July, and 9,600 by the end of August -- the water quickly 
became fouled. The pond became a breeding ground of disease amid an extended 
heat wave that summer. 
</P>
<P>
Less than three weeks after Elmira opened, a local newspaper reported that a 
"deleterious miasma" hung over the camp due to the stagnant water. One Union 
surgeon called it a "festering mass of corruption." 
</P>
<P>
Prison administrators asked the Union's commissioner general of prisoners, Col. 
William Hoffman, for permission to dig canals connecting the pond with the 
nearby Chemung River to allow fresher water to pass through it. 
</P>
<P>
Approval for that project didn't come until October -- and prisoners didn't 
complete the canals until Jan. 1, 1865. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this falls into the realm of circumstantial evidence," Horigan says. 
"This is what I call the politics of delay. The sluice could have been done by 
August, 1864." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Disease Spread 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, men were dying in droves. 
</P>
<P>
"The scurvy was among us, and as the cold weather advanced the death rate 
increased rapidly," wrote prisoner L.B. Jones. "Scurvy, typhoid, pneumonia and 
finally smallpox broke out to an alarming extent, carrying off great numbers of 
the poor fellows." 
</P>
<P>
Emory Thomas, a history professor at the University of Georgia, says doctors at 
Elmira weren't different from those practicing elsewhere during a war in which 
twice as many men died from disease than from battle-related wounds. 
</P>
<P>
"The doctors really weren't convinced about the germ theory of disease at this 
point," he said. "At this time they were dealing with very, very nuts-and-bolts 
things, like how to set a fracture properly and whether chloroform would kill 
and if ether was better than chloroform. These are important things, but we're 
not talking about great leaps forward in medical practice." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rations Small 
</P>
<P>
The food at Elmira could have been another problem. Elmira prisoners after the 
war said a day's rations generally included two, 1-inch-thick slices of bread, 
2 ounces of meat and a pint of soup, often only the thin broth in which the 
meat was cooked. Union officers insisted after the war that rations at Elmira 
were more generous. 
</P>
<P>
"I was assured by a guard that the same rations were issued to the prisoners as 
to the U.S. troops stationed there," Confederate soldier Erastus Palmer 
recalled after the war. "There seemed to me to be some bad leak in it before it 
got to us." 
</P>
<P>
In May, 1864, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton had ordered that prison rations to 
Confederates being held in Northern camps be reduced to the same level as those 
Southern troops in the field were receiving. This coincided with the Lincoln 
Administration's general hardening of its treatment of Southern prisoners 
starting that year as news began to filter north of the deprivations being 
endured by Union soldiers at Andersonville, the Libby prison in Richmond, Va., 
and other Confederate camps. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Vindictive Man' 
</P>
<P>
Horigan calls Stanton a "very vindictive man" who exercised virtual dictatorial 
control over the Northern prison camp system. 
</P>
<P>
"Abraham Lincoln had very little to do with any decision-making as far as the 
prison-camp system was concerned," Horigan said. "One of the characteristics of 
his presidency was that he (delegated) power to his Cabinet members. He gave 
them an enormous amount of power and an enormous amount of leeway." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Elmira's prisoners blamed Stanton too. 
</P>
<P>
"It is my honest opinion that Secretary Stanton did this in retaliation," 
Virginia soldier Enos Lyons later wrote of conditions at Elmira. "Yes, men died 
in Elmira prison I know from hunger and want; this in a land of plenty. I was 
young and strong and determined I would not be carried out if I could help it, 
but many poor prisoners lay right down and died of hunger." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
More than 20% Died 
</P>
<P>
According to figures compiled by an early-century historian of the Elmira 
prison, Clay Holmes, 27% of the camp's captives died. Pulitzer Prize-winning 
Civil War historian James McPherson places Elmira's mortality rate at 24%. 
</P>
<P>
By way of comparison, 13,000, or 29%, of the 45,000 Union soldiers imprisoned 
at Andersonville died. 
</P>
<P>
For the Civil War as a whole, 15.5% of the Union soldiers imprisoned in 28 
Southern camps died while in captivity and 12% of the Confederates in 24 
Northern camps died. 
</P>
<P>
Why, then, have Elmira and other Northern prisons with high death rates -- Camp 
Alton, Ill.; Lookout Point, Md.; Johnson's Island, Ohio; and Rock Island, Ill. 
-- escaped Andersonville's notoriety? 
</P>
<P>
"To the extent that Elmira and others lack infamy, I would guess it has to do 
with who won the war," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mismanagement on Both Sides 
</P>
<P>
Andersonville's commandant, Henry Wirz, was the only soldier executed after the 
Civil War as a war criminal, an act that caused lingering resentment for 
decades among some Southerners who claimed that he was made a scapegoat for the 
mismanagement of prison camps on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
And the only historic site operated by the National Park Service at a former 
Civil War prison camp is at Andersonville. Events including historic 
re-creations, memorial services and even an archeological dig will be held 
throughout this year to mark Andersonville's 125th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
But Elmira's anniversary will pass quietly. The chances are good that most of 
the people living in the well-maintained, turn-of-the-century homes around the 
former site of the camp won't give the historic significance of this year a 
second thought. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in the South know Elmira," Horigan said. "They know their 
granddaddy was there or whatever. And quite a few compare it to Andersonville. 
I don't think they're correct in doing so. Nothing else was Andersonville. 
</P>
<P>
"But why we only think of Andersonville when we think of Civil War prison camps 
I don't know. These places were bad places, all of them were. It was 
despicable, the way both the South and the Union treated their prisoners. It 
was the darkest chapter of the war."
