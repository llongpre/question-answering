   The Confederacy's infamous Andersonville prison
camp in Georgia marks its 125th anniversary this year. So does the
Union's Elmira prison in New York. While Andersonville remains a
symbol of the inhumanities endured by prisoners in the Civil War,
Elmira and other Northern prisons escaped that notoriety. But there
is little evidence that one was any better than the other.

   Like some rusty bayonet or tattered battle
flag hidden away in the attic, the Elmira prison camp is an
all-but-forgotten relic of the Civil War.
   Considering the human suffering involved, maybe memories of the
prison, which opened 125 years ago this month, are best left
undisturbed.
   Except for a flagpole, a small monument and two stone markers
there's nothing in the quiet Elmira neighborhood where the prison
camp once stood to mark its presence. But buried beheath tidy rows
of white headstones and shade trees at the Woodlawn National
Cemetery are the remains of 2,973 Confederate soldiers who died at
Elmira, many from starvation.
   The Confederacy's Andersonville prison in Georgia is remembered
as the most infamous example of the inhumanity and deprivations of
the Civil War, even though records show that a soldier imprisoned in
Elmira stood little better chance of surviving than did one in
Andersonville.
   Questions linger over whether those 2,973 Rebels died mainly
because of the primitive state of medicine and sanitation during the
Civil War, or whether they were victims of the Lincoln
administration's retaliatory neglect of some prisoners of war.
   ``Can one say that, by design, this was a death camp?'' asks J.
Michael Horigan, an Elmira history teacher who spent much of the
last year researching records from Civil War prison camps in
Washington, D.C., and in the South. ``I think one can say it, but
you can't document it. The records on this camp are very incomplete.
But circumstantial evidence certainly makes it look that way.''
   Union officials ordered in May 1864 that a complex of barracks at
Elmira that had been used for three years to house Union soldiers be
converted to a prison camp for captive Southerners. A 12-foot high
fence was immediately thrown around a 30-acre portion of barracks.
   There were 35 wooden buildings in the complex, each about 100
feet long and 16 feet wide. Union officers in Elmira wrote the War
Department that the barracks could accommodate 3,000 men comfortably
and 1,000 more in a pinch.
   Orders came back from Washington that 10,000 men were to be
housed in the camp. Men not lucky enough to get places in barracks
would sleep in tents. Wooden barracks weren't constructed for all
the men until well after winter had set in.
   On July 6, 1864, a train pulled into Elmira with the first
399-man contingent of prisoners on board.
   It was a ragged group of prisoners. Most had been captured during
the grinding battles of the Wilderness in Virginia. Elmirans noted
that their ragtag uniforms hardly made the men look like members of
the same army. Some prisoners wore only shirts and underwear. Many
had no shoes.
   Things went wrong at the prison camp almost from the beginning.
   On July 15, a train loaded with 844 Confederates and 128 Union
guards bound for Elmira smashed head-on with a coal train near
Shohola, Pa. Many of the wooden cars were reduced to kindling in the
accident, which killed 49 prisoners and 17 guards.
   Five prisoners escaped during the chaos and it took three days
for some of the wounded to receive medical treatment.
   Meanwhile, inside the camp, a peril just as lethal though slower
in its effect was taking shape.
   A stagnant body of water, called Foster's Pond, was within the
fences of the prison. With so many men being sent to the camp _
there would be more than 4,400 by the end of July, 9,600 by the end
of August _ the water quickly became fouled. The pond became a
breeding ground of disease amid an extended heat wave that summer.
   Less than three weeks after Elmira opened, a local newspaper
reported that a ``deleterious miasma'' hung over the camp due to the
stagnant water. One Union surgeon called it a ``festering mass of
corruption.''
   Prison administrators asked the Union's commissioner general of
prisoners, Col. William Hoffman, for permission to dig canals
connecting the pond with the nearby Chemung River to allow fresher
water to pass through it.
   Approval for that project didn't come until October _ and
prisoners didn't complete the canals until Jan. 1, 1865.
   ``I think this falls into the realm of circumstantial evidence,''
Horigan says. ``This is what I call the politics of delay. The
sluice could have been done by August 1864.''
   In the meantime, men were dying in droves.
   ``The scurvy was among us, and as the cold weather advanced the
death rate increased rapidly,'' wrote prisoner L.B. Jones. ``Scurvy,
typhoid, pneumonia and finally smallpox broke out to an alarming
extent, carrying off great numbers of the poor fellows.''
