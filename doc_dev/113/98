Antietam National Battlefield where Union and Confederate troops battled in
the single bloodiest day in U.S. military history.;   The Richard King Mellon
Foundation, assisted by the Conservation Fund, bought 151 acres of farmland
for $500,000, and officially transferred ownership of the property to the
National Park Service during the weekend.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The land, known as the West Woods, already was inside the national
battlefield's congressionally approved boundary, but it was privately owned
and farmed by the Poffenberger family.;   Most of the West Woods;   "The
Poffenberger tract has given us almost all of the West Woods," battlefield
historian Paul Chiles said Monday.;   The land is near a visitors center at
the battleground where the blue and gray fought Sept. 17, 1862. When the
fighting ended, 23,110 soldiers were killed, wounded or missing.;   Some of
the fiercest fighting at Antietam was done in the West Woods, Chiles said.;  
On the morning of Sept. 17, Union soldiers launched three attacks on
Confederate Gen. Stonewall Jackson's army. The Union soldiers pushed Jackson's
men into the West Woods. As the Union soldiers readied to counter artillery
fire from the remnants of Jackson's army, they were hit by a one-two punch
from Confederate reinforcements.;   "The ground seemed to erupt with Rebels,"
Chiles said. "Out of 5,500 Union troops that went into the West Woods, 2,200
were killed or wounded in 20 minutes.;   40 percent Union losses;   "Forty
percent of the Union forces who went into the West Woods were lost. Thus, this
became known as the West Woods massacre.";   The park service is working on a
general management plan that calls for replanting hardwoods in the West Woods,
which is currently used for crops.;   "We want to put it back to its 1862
appearance," Chiles said.;   The Mellon Foundation is a private conservation
organization based in Pittsburgh. The Conservation Fund is a non-profit
organization based in Arlington, Va., that works with other groups to buy and
conserve land.  </TEXT>
