<LEADPARA>  Castro Valley is one step closer to becoming Alameda County's newest city,
following the delivery of a stack of petitions for an election on the issue.; 
  A total of 6,328 signatures -- exactly the number required to qualify for
the election -- were submitted to the Alameda County Local Agency Formation
Commission by Faye Hahn, president of Citizens for Castro Valley.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The signatures represent one-fourth the number of registered voters in the
community of about 50,000.;    "We worked until the very last minute getting
those signatures. It was crucial we got those signatures in before the end of
the year," Hahn said.;    Hahn said that by filing the petitions Monday, New
Year's Eve, more than $5 million in state taxes could be saved by avoiding a
change in tax laws for newly incorporated cities.;    The Registrar of Voters
is expected to randomly check 5 percent of the names on the petitions and
notify Hahn if any are not valid. If any signatures are disqualified, Hahn's
group will have 15 days to supplement the list.;    The county has up to 30
days to count all the signatures.;    Those supporting incorporation point to
the need for autonomy over such key local matters as zoning, housing and city
planning, as well as to combat expansion by Dublin and Pleasanton.;    "It's
about time a community of almost 50,000 people starts making its own
decisions," said Sal Tedesco, a former chairman of the Castro Valley Municipal
Advisory Council. "We deserve a place at the bargaining table where major
decisions are made about land use, transportation and other important
issues.";    As an unincorporated area, Castro Valley is a ward of Alameda
County, governed by the board of supervisors. When competing for money for
social service and other programs, the community's problems have often been
ignored, Tedesco said.;    A feasibility study released last summer said the
community could govern itself without a tax increase -- provided the county
continues subsidizing fire protection.;    The report, initiated by the
county's Local Agency Formation Commission, was more optimistic than a similar
study two years ago that concluded Castro Valley could not make it on its own.
The bedroom community has almost no industrial or commercial businesses to
solidify its tax base.;    The county subsidizes about $4 million of the fire
district's $6 million budget. Even the most ardent incorporation supporters
say that without the subsidy, they would not support making Castro Valley the
county's 15th city.;    "If they lay the fire department on us, we can't
afford to do it," said Tedesco, a member of the feasibility committee and a
vocal proponent of incorporation.;    But members of the county board of
supervisors have said that as a city, Castro Valley would be expected to pick
up the fire protection tab. However, supervisors Mary King and Ed Campbell,
who were the most vocal regarding the fire protection issue, endorsed
negotiations between the county and community to find an alternative plan for
funding the fire district so that Castro Valley residents would not be
overburdened if it incorporates.;    Castro Valley -- one of the largest
unincorporated areas in the county and one of the largest in the state -- has
been debating whether to become a city since World War II. The last vote to
incorporate Castro Valley was 35 years ago, and it was defeated overwhelmingly.  </TEXT>
