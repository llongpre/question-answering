   Rapidly multiplying bacteria
are eating away vivid pictures from the walls of King Tut's tomb,
one of Egypt's most-visited tourist sites.
   Specialists have begun applying an antidote they hope can arrest
the bacteria, but antiquities officials say the original color never
can be restored to the small, pox-like black specks and blotches
marring the walls.
   ``The situation inside the tomb is extremely serious,'' said
Mutaw'ie Balboush, the Egyptian Antiquities Organization's director
for upper Egypt. ``Damage is appearing almost everywhere you look
among the figures.''
   At the start of the winter tourist season in early November,
officials were so worried they considered closing the tomb to let
conservators work unhindered.
   After the antidote was developed last week, however, work to save
the paintings was scheduled before and after tourist hours.
   Tutankhamun, a young pharaoh who died in 1323 B.C., was buried in
a makeshift tomb stuffed with riches in the barren Valley of the
Kings _ the southern wasteland where royalty and nobility were
buried for 500 years.
   During tourist season, his single-chambered tomb draws more than
2,500 visitors a day.
   Its wall paintings, some with colors as bright as the day they
were painted, depict noblemen and officials transporting Tut's mummy
to the tomb. They include a unique scene of the ``Opening of the
Mouth'' rite in which the dead king is given eternal life.
   ``We can't simply remove the infection, because the bacteria have
become part of the paint itself,'' said restoration director Shawky
Nakhla. ``We have to put the bacteria in a situation that won't
endanger the tomb itself.
   ``In the past the bacteria were dormant, but something has
triggered them to life. When we looked at them in Cairo, they were
so active they were duplicating every day.''
   They found four kinds of bacteria and actinomycetes _ an
intermediate step between bacteria and fungi that in humans cause
abscesses under the skin.
   Omar Arini, science officer at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, said
bacteria have been present in Egyptian tombs since they were sealed
thousands of years ago.
   ``If something changes the environment inside a tomb, such as a
rise in humidity, then bacteria can come to life,'' Arini said.
   ``When this happens, the situation is extremely dangerous not
only for the tomb but for others in the vicinity. The bacteria can
spread.''
   Nakhla said bacteria in Tut's tomb could have been activated by
high humidity, difficult to control with so many visitors. And the
number of tourists is expected to increase dramatically during peak
season over the next two months.
   Though smaller and with lesser-quality paintings than some of the
62 nearby tombs, Tut's burial place mesmerizes visitors.
   It owes part of its allure to the myth of a curse visited on
anybody who violates it. It gained prominence in the 1920s and
1930s, after a number of people from the expedition team that found
the tomb in 1922 died unusual deaths.
   Egyptologists scoff at the idea. Grave robbers violated the tomb
at least twice in antiquity and Egyptologist Howard Carter, the
expedition leader, died naturally in 1939 at age 66.
