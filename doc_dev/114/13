Korean dancers, a choir of singers from seven churches and a student drill team 
will highlight Martin Luther King Day events in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The dancers and choir will appear during services Monday night titled "His 
Dream Is Our Dream," sponsored by the Valley Interfaith Council, a coalition of 
about 200 churches. 
</P>
<P>
The service will start with a procession of about 40 elected officials and 
clergy from various religious faiths. Rabbi Aaron Weis, who walked with King in 
Alabama, will be among the speakers. 
</P>
<P>
"What we're trying to do is get a Hispanic, Jewish, Korean, Protestant 
representation out here . . . to demonstrate that it's not just a holiday for 
blacks," said Barry Smedberg, executive director of the interfaith council. The 
services will begin at 7:30 p.m. at St. Catherine of Siena Catholic Church, 
18115 Sherman Way in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, a drill team, choirs and dancers from at least 10 area schools 
will perform during a five-hour tribute beginning at 10 a.m. in the Pacoima 
Community Center at Glen Oaks and Van Nuys boulevards. Essays and art with the 
theme "His Dream Is Our Dream" will be shown at the Youth Culture Center, next 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"When I watch the young people perform, it's like a class," said Arthur 
Broadous, youth center director, who has seen the King tribute at least seven 
years. "A lot of kids never sat in the back of the bus, knew what it was like 
not to be able to eat in a restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, a student discussion of the "unfinished business" in King's legacy 
will end three hours of programming on the activist aired on KLCS-TV, Channel 
58, the educational station of the Los Angeles Unified School District. The 
programs begin at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In events today Harding Street School in Sylmar will hold its 21st annual 
commemoration of King, featuring a six-foot mural of the activist and 150 
students singing his favorite hymns. 
</P>
<P>
"The music is fantastic," said Susan Alves, a teacher and co-director of the 
program. "We had a dress rehearsal and two teachers were crying. . . ." 
Programs begin at 9 a.m. and 1:15 p.m. The school is at 13060 Harding St. 
</P>
<P>
Other events today include reenactments of Rosa Parks' bus trip in Alabama, 
where she refused to give up her seat to a white man in 1955, triggering civil 
rights demonstrations. Re-enactments will be performed at 10:30 a.m. and 1:30 
p.m. at Fenton Avenue School, 11828 Gain St. in Lake View Terrace.

All events are free and open to the public.
