   Nearly 4,000 years after it was built, the
funeral boat of one of Egypt's most powerful pharaohs takes another
journey this week.
   The delicate, 32-foot long, wooden craft was gently lifted off
the floor of the Field Museum of Natural History on Monday and
rotated 180 degrees. Expert riggers who performed the tricky
maneuver kept their hands off, fearing sweat or body oils would
harm the ancient wood.
   Today, the boat used in the funeral of King Sen-wosret III in
about 1850 B.C. will be moved inch by inch a few yards to its new
setting in the museum _ a $2.2 million permanent exhibit.
   When the exhibit opens in November, it will allow visitors to
walk through the eerie world of tombs, mummies, shrines to cat
goddesses and other treasures from ancient Egypt. The museum said
the exhibit would give visitors the only opportunity outside Egypt
to enter and explore a life-size tomb complex.
   King Sen-wosret's boat _ a graceful, crescent-shaped canoe-like
craft _ is but one of more than a thousand artifacts and treasures
from the museum's collection used to recreate the burial scenes.
   Visitors enter the tomb chambers of the 5th Dynasty pharaoh,
King Unis, dating to 2400 B.C. and excavated from Saqqara, Egypt,
in 1908.
   Beneath a false door, a 35-foot burial shaft takes visitors into
the dark and eerie burial chamber. The sarcophagus is empty. When
it was excavated, the pharaoh's mummy was gone, stolen by robbers
or destroyed by time.
   Leaving the burial chamber, the visitor passes through a roughly
hewn tomb robbers' tunnel and into another scene depicting a
variety of Egyptian burial rites.
   ``This could well be the most fascinating part of the exhibit,''
said its developer, Janet Kamien. ``It gives them (visitors) a
chance to explore the age-old mysteries of mummies and life after
death.''
   Next month, the museum staff will move 23 mummies into the
exhibit, along with the accouterments their souls were to take with
them to the afterworld.
   Sen-wosret's boat will be displayed nearby.
   No one actually knows if the boat was used to transport the
king's body across the Nile River to the burial site, said Frank
Yurco, a scholar on ancient Egypt at the Oriental Institute and a
consultant on the museum project.
   The boat was one of six found at the burial compound in 1893-94
by Jacques DeMorgan, a Welsh Egyptologist. Two badly deteriorated
ones were left at the site.
   Two of the four DeMorgan saved are at the Egyptian Museum in
Cairo and the other is at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in
Pittsburgh.
   Sen-wosret is remembered for military campaigns that extended
Egypt's boundary into the Nubian region of Ethiopia and the Sudan,
as well as securing control of the Nile River to the south, he said.
   He also centralized the Egyptian government, setting the pattern
for several hundred years.
   Sen-wosret is believed to have died when he was about 50, said
Yurco.
