   The author of a new book claims the Jewish prophet
Moses was known to ancient Egyptians as Ikhnaton, the ruler and
religious reformer.
   ``I am convinced that I have identified Moses as Ikhnaton, the
prophet, poet and king in the 14th century B.C., who shut the
temples of the ancient gods, sent the priests home and declared
there was only one god,'' said Ahmed Osman.
   His book, ``Moses: Pharaoh of Egypt,'' was published in Britain
on Thursday by Grafton Books. The U.S. rights are under negotiation.
   Osman's first book in 1987, ``Stranger in the Valley of Kings,''
theorized that the mummy of a royal official named Yuya was Joseph,
the biblical figure with the coat of many colors who led the tribe
of Israel into Egypt.
   Osman, 55, an Egyptian who has pursued research in Egyptology
and the Bible in London for 25 years, is regarded by academics as a
controversial but respected outsider.
   Younes Ahmed el-Batrik, cultural counselor at the Egyptian
Embassy, held a reception Thursday night to launch Osman's book.
``It's a very interesting subject and a very controversial book and
I will be interested to hear what the experts say about it,'' he
said.
   In identifying Moses with Ikhnaton, Osman builds on Sigmund
Freud's last book, ``Moses and Monotheism,'' in which the father of
psychoanalysis commented on the similarity of the teachings of the
two ancients.
   Sydney Leperer, a senior history lecturer at Jews' College,
University of London, said of Osman's Ikhnaton-Moses theory:
``There is a faint possibility that it is true, although I have my
doubts.''
   Naim Dangoor, editor of The Scribe, a journal on Babylonian
Jewry, said he had read and reviewed both of Osman's books. Osman
``knows a great deal about the period,'' and his theories ``invite
further investigation,'' Dangoor said.
   Osman said in an interview that scholars had always had
difficulty establishing links between any of the important figures
in the Old Testament and Egyptian history.
   ``I believe that Moses had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian
father,'' he said.
   ``He was the son of Pharaoh Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye,
daughter of Joseph the Patriarch. Tiye's first son had mysteriously
disappeared so when Moses was born, Tiye sent him by water for
safekeeping to her Israelite relatives. I think that was the origin
of the story that Moses was found in the bulrushes on the Nile.''
   After 17 years as pharaoh, Ikhnaton was deposed and succeeded by
the boy prince, Tutankhamen.
   ``I believe Ikhnaton survived and went into exile in Sinai with
a few followers,'' Osman said. ``When the oppressor Pharaoh
Horemheb died, Ikhnaton saw his chance to regain his throne as
there was no heir. He challenged Horemheb's general, Ramses, for
the throne but Ramses attacked him and forced him to flee. The
flight was the Exodus, in 1333 B.C.''
   ``Ikhnaton and his followers attempted to enter Canaan, the
Promised Land, but were slaughtered by Ramses' successor, Seti I.
This fight is recorded in the Temple of Karnak in Luxor,'' the
author said.
   Jewish narratives are silent on any blood connection between
Moses and Egypt because of memories of the oppression, Osman
believes. ``However, the Talmud (the Jewish law) indicates that
Moses became a king and was forced to abdicate,'' he added.
   Eric Uphill, an Egyptologist at London's University College,
said he helped and supported Osman's research because he regarded
Osman as a serious student with extensive knowledge.
   Osman's manuscript was based on the right sources for Egyptian
history, Uphill said, but he would not comment on the conclusions
without further study.
   ``The problem with Moses is that the historical truth about him
is very unclear and lends itself to many theories, some of them
haywire,'' Leperer said.
   Dangoor said Moses' death is a mystery that is not resolved in
the Exodus accounts. ``Osman's explanation that he was killed by
Seti I is very plausible,'' Dangoor said.
