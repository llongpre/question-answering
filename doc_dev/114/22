El Toro High School presented a different version of the two-minute offense 
Saturday at Tustin High, one that produced points in the water. 
</P>
<P>
The Charger water polo team scored twice with less than two minutes remaining 
in first half, and J.P. Mathot scored the game-winning goal with 1:54 to play 
as El Toro (25-3) defeated Capistrano Valley, 3-2, in the Southern Section 4-A 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro will face Long Beach Wilson (22-6) in the final at 8:45 Wednesday night 
at Belmont Plaza in Long Beach. Wilson beat Corona del Mar, 8-4, in the other 
semifinal. El Toro will be seeking its first 4-A championship after winning 
consecutive 3-A titles in 1988 and '89. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have an experience advantage over some teams," Mathot said, "because 
we aren't happy just to be in the finals, but we want to win the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Capistrano Valley (23-4) has dropped the past three meetings with El Toro, 
including last year's 3-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Mathot, who scored 31 goals in his previous five games, went scoreless for the 
first 22 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense for both teams today was unbelievable," El Toro Coach Ron Stoll 
said. "I thought J.P. was playing well, but he got frustrated because he tried 
to do too much." 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I played lousy today," Mathot said, "but I tried to focus myself to 
do at least one thing right on that last play." 
</P>
<P>
With the game tied, 2-2, and two minutes remaining, Mathot zeroed in when he 
received the ball in the hole. He turned Capistrano Valley defender Dan Hancock 
at the two-meter line, then fired his game-winner past goalie Nick Kittredge. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't crash down on Mathot on that play," Capistrano Valley Coach Don 
Cholodenko said, "but we lost the game because we didn't capitalize on our 
six-on-five advantages." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars went zero for three on the one-man advantages, but El Toro 
converted on two consecutive Capistrano Valley kick-outs, with Greg Craycraft 
and Jason Kneitel scoring, to erase a 2-0 deficit late in the first half.
