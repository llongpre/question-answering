   Fruits, spices and grains entombed with the
ancient Egyptian boy king Tutankhamun for his journey to the
afterlife have been rediscovered after 56 years in a musty
storeroom, a newspaper reported today.
   The Times of London said an archeological student discovered the
boxes of food remains at the Royal Botanical Gardens.
   The newspaper said the remains have not been disturbed since
they were sent to the gardens in 1932 by Howard Carter, who
discovered Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valleys of the Kings at Luxor,
Egypt, in 1922.
   The remains were to have been cataloged by retired botanist
Leonard Boodle, but were apparently forgotten after his death in
the 1930s.
   Arthur Bell, director of the gardens at Kew in south London, was
quoted as saying the remains recently were identified by Christian
Tutundjian de Vartavan, a 23-year-old French student working on a
master of science degree in ancient Egyptian plants at London's
University College.
   The Times said the college's Institute of Archaeology is trying
to determine what species of plants are represented in the hoard,
which includes sections of funeral wreaths and more than five
pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in Tutankhamun's tomb
after his death more than 3,300 years ago.
   The Times said the species indentified so far include emmer
wheat for making bread on the journey, barley for brewing beer and
a considerable quantity of watermelon seeds to chew on.
   Also found were coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds,
two kinds of juniper berries and grapes.
   The Times quoted University College botanist Gordon Hillman as
saying the collection also includes more than 20 species of weeds.
   ``They will help to tell us how the crops were irrigated, how
they were harvested and how they were stored,'' Hillman was quoted
as saying.
   The newspaper said officials at Kew are willing to return the
specimens to the Egyptian government, but would like to put some on
display.
   The Independent newspaper said Tutundjian de Vartavan came
across the Tutankhamun remains while studying ancient Egyptian
plant remains.
   The Times and The Independent said the find represents only a
fraction of the food buried in the tomb. The rest is still in 116
original wicker baskets and several pottery jars in the Cairo
Museum and the Dokki Agricultural Museum in Egypt.
