   Excavators have uncovered another 15 statues
of ancient royalty and gods from a pit inside Luxor Temple that
yielded five magnificent statues earlier this year.
   The overall find is as significant as the discovery of the tomb
of Tutankhamun in 1922, which yielded enormous amounts of gold and
other precious objects, said Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization.
   ``The Tut tomb was wonderful but gave us information only about
the art of the day,'' Tawfik said Tuesday. ``This find will answer
many questions about many periods of history.''
   He said one of the new statues is unlike any ever found: a
42-inch-high white granite cobra, probably representing Mertsager,
the goddess of silence. Her job was to keep secret the location of
royal tombs in the bone-dry valleys of the kings and queens across
the Nile River opposite present-day Luxor 450 miles south of Cairo.
   Tawfik and other Egyptian officials said workers trying to take
the search deeper hit underground water at the 10-foot level that
makes digging more difficult.
   Water is more than 3 feet deep at the bottom of the pit,
endangering not only the excavation but a row of towering columns
nearby, Tawfik said.
   Many Egyptologists consider Luxor Temple, built more than 3,300
years ago, the most endangered monument in the antiquity-rich Luxor
area. It lies in a picturesque setting between the Nile and the
modern town of Luxor and suffers greatly from rising water and
other natural debilitations.
   The new statues, found in a sacred courtyard beneath the earlier
finds, cover a wide range of Egyptian history and include
depictions of some of Egypt's best-known rulers and a pantheon of
gods.
   Tawfik said the earliest appears to be an alabaster Sphinx
dating from the reign of Tutankhamun, the young pharaoh who died in
1323 B.C. after a 10-year reign. The latest is a whnite
cobra from the reign of Tao ruled for 26 years and died in
664 B.C. at a time when the pharaonic period was in its death
throes.
   He said some of theries are broken and lack the
artistic excellence of the original five.
   Most of the new stere found last month. Officials said
pieces of some statues were buried at diff
phenomenon they could not explain.
   On Jan.ound the first of the original five
beautifully preserved statues from the New Kingdom, a golden age of
wealth and power for Egyptian kings. The five dated from the reigns
of Amenhophis III, the builder of Luxor Temple who ruled from 1391
to 1353 B.C., to Haremhab, a powerful military commander who died
in 1307 B.C., 12 years after gaining the throne following
Tutankhamun's pnd the brief reign of the caretaker
Aya.
   Antiquities experts are debating why the statues ried,
when and by whom. The answers may never be found.
   ``We have to wait to find the answers, because evee
think we have the right information, we have to change our mim different
periods are found,'' Tawfik
said. ``Now we've even found Roman pottery'' in the exc  The Luxor Temple
cache doesn't appear to approach in number

   At Karnak, the cache contained thousands of statues of gods and
individuals, ans cache contains only
royal and religious images and at least three unique statues,
