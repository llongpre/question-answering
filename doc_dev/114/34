   A student rediscovered a forgotten hoard of grain,
dried fruit, spices and insects from the 3,300-year-old tomb of the
Egyptian King Tutankhamun, archaeologists said Thursday.
   ``It obviously is extremely important archaelogically because
it's a very large amount of material,'' said John Evans, director
of the University of London's Institute of Archaeology.
   ``Very little work has been done on material of this period in
Egypt, and I understand that some of the species which have been
identified are, in fact, the earliest occurrences,'' Evans said at
a news conference.
   Most of the discovery consists of the food placed in
Tutankhamun's tomb to sustain him on his journey to the afterlife.
Scientists said the material is well preserved and could provide
best evidence to date of the diet and lifestyle of the Egyptians at
the time of Tutankhamun's death in 1323 B.C.
   For more than 50 years, the hoard has lain undisturbed in 30
cardboard boxes in a musty storeroom at the Royal Botanical
Gardens. The specimens were sent in 1932 by Howard Carter, the
British archaeologist who discovered Tutankhamun's treasure-laden
tomb in the Valleys of the Kings at Luxor, Egypt, in 1922.
   They were to have been cataloged by the botanist Leonard Boodle.
But Boodle and Carter both died in the 1930s before the work could
be completed, and the specimens were stored in boxes labeled ``From
Ancient Egypt.''
   In February of this year, the material was turned over to a
French graduate student at the archaelogical institute, 23-year-old
Christian Tutundjian de Vartavan, for research leading to a
master's degree in archaeobotany, the institute's speciality.
   He recognized notations on the boxes as those of Carter,
providing the first clue that they might be from Tutankhamun's
tomb. Scientific analysis confirmed his theory and eventually
fragments were matched with photographs taken by Carter.
   ``It all fit in. It was beyond coincidence,'' said
archaeobotanist Gordon Hillmann, who supervised the student's work.
Tutundjian de Vartavan did not attend the news conference.
   Professor David Harris, director of the archaeology institute's
Department of Human Environment, said the announcement was delayed
until it had completed scientific analysis.
   ``We were anxious to announce it as soon as possible, lest it
should leak out, but we felt we had to keep it under wraps as long
as possible, so that we could get as much work accomplished as we
could,'' Harris said.
   He acknowledged that one reason for the secrecy was concern that
the Egyptian government might demand possession before the
institute had completed its analysis.
   Last week, the institute informed the Egyptian Embassy in London
about the discovery and offered to return the material. As of
Thursday, the institute had received no reply, Harris said.
   The hoard includes fragments of funeral wreaths and more than
five pounds of seeds, fruits and spices placed in Tutankhamun's
tomb, Harris said.
   Among identified species are emmer wheat for making bread on the
journey, barley for brewing beer, a large quantity of watermelon
seeds to chew on, coriander, fenugreek, black cumin, sesame seeds,
two kinds of juniper berries, grapes and a datelike fruit known as
a jujube.
   The grains, fruits and seeds were intended as raw materials that
figurines known as shawabtis found in the tomb would cultivate into
food needed by the ``ka'' _ one of the king's souls _ in the
afterlife, Harris said.
   Dr. Ken Thomas, a specialist in insects, said the remains of
thousands of beetles also had been identified. The foods were to
sustain the boy king through eternity, Thomas said, ``but the
insects got through first and had a pretty good crack at them.''
   The find represents only a fraction of the food buried in the
tomb. Harris said the remainder is in 110 to 120 original wicker
baskets and several pottery jars in the Cairo Museum and the Dokki
Agricultural Museum in Egypt.
