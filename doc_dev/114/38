Laguna Beach High School swept to a surprisingly easy 15-4, 15-7, 15-9 victory 
over Capistrano Valley Tuesday night to advance to the semifinals of the 
Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Artists' (19-1) superior serving game and balanced attack was more than a 
match for the Cougars (17-4), who were coming off their first South Coast 
League championship. The victory sets up Thursday's semifinal match with Mira 
Costa. 
</P>
<P>
Mira Costa is the tournament's No. 1 seed and is rated the top high school 
girls' volleyball team in the nation by USA Today. The Artists are the 
tournament's No. 4 seed. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we had the capability to win three straight," Artists Coach Lance 
Stewart said. "When we're on top of our game, we can do it, and this was our 
night." 
</P>
<P>
Senior outside hitter Kit Spath's ace serve gave the Artists a 10-3 advantage 
en route to their 15-4 first-set victory, and the Cougars could never recover 
after that. "The girls seemed to get frustrated," Cougar Coach John Gipe said. 
"We were our own worst enemies." 
</P>
<P>
Outside hitters Sara Nelson and Spath led the balanced Laguna scoring with nine 
kills apiece. Kealy Clark had eight. Setter Angie Rush contributed 12 assists. 
Becky Linhart (12 kills, five blocks, six assists) and Christina Grady (10 
kills) led Capistrano Valley's scoring.
