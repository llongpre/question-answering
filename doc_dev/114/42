Notes: Corona del Mar Coach Gary Salazar rates his Sea Kings as the team to 
beat in the Sea View League, and the returning talent he has supports his case. 
A third consecutive Southern Section 4-A team title seems an attainable goal. 
Phebus, O'Leary, Pollock and senior Courtney Strauss lead the team. Last 
season's Southern Section 3-A champion, Dana Hills, has moved up to the 4-A 
division and should be a good test for Corona del Mar during the playoffs, 
especially if Mall is healthy. Mall, arguably one of the top three singles 
players in the county, has been bothered by a rotator cuff strain in her right 
shoulder. Also contending in the 4-A class will be Capistrano Valley and its 
ace, Bartelt.
