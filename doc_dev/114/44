The Ocean View, La Quinta and Rancho Alamitos girls' basketball teams will find 
themselves in unfamiliar positions when the Southern Section playoffs continue 
Saturday night: Each will be making the school's first appearance in the girls' 
playoff semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View (26-2) will play Buena (25-0) in a 5-A game at Ventura High School; 
La Quinta (25-3) will meet Palm Desert (25-2) in a 4-A game at College of the 
Desert, and Rancho Alamitos (20-3) will play San Dimas (16-6) at Bolsa Grande 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View, the fourth-seeded team in the 5-A division, faces a difficult task 
for several reasons. Buena, the top-seeded team in 5-A, has plenty of playoff 
experience. Last year, the Bulldogs lost in the semifinals. They have been 
semifinalists four times before in the 4-A division, finalists five times, 
champions in 1979 and '84 and state champions in Division I in '83 and '84. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs have advanced to the playoffs in each of Coach Joe Vaughan's 16 
years. Vaughan has the best record (351-29) in the state among girls' coaches. 
</P>
<P>
Buena has lost only twice at home in the past 10 years, to Santa Barbara two 
seasons ago and to state champion Brea-Olinda last season. 
</P>
<P>
The good news for Ocean View is that although the game is a home game for 
Buena, at least it won't be played in Buena's gym. All semifinal games are at 
alternate sites. The game will be played at Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View has a definite height advantage with 6-2, 185-pound Jennifer 
Sullivan (17.4 ppg, 14.6 rebounds) and 5-11 Tracy Wolfe (13.3 ppg, 9.5 
rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Ventura (18-9) vs Loara (16-10) at Savanna High School -- Loara has come on 
strong in the playoffs, upsetting Mission Viejo in the quarterfinals and 
second-seeded Woodbridge in the second round. Loara is led by 6-1 junior center 
Tracy Titus (16.6 ppg, 10.9 rebounds). Jennifer Leonard, Liz Redman and Kristin 
Thibodeau provided strong support, and senior guard Lisa Nakazono runs the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, like Loara, is unseeded. The Cougars upset third-seeded Westlake in 
the second round before eliminating Edison. They are led by 5-7 junior guard 
Cori Herman (16.45 ppg), an adept three-point shooter, and 5-9 sophomore 
forward Denise Rea (9.5 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
In the 4-A: 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta (25-3) vs Palm Desert (25-2) at College of the Desert -- La Quinta 
has dominated the not-so-tough Garden Grove League, winning nine straight 
titles. But in the past, the Aztecs have faltered when they met tougher 
competition in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Not so this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs are led by Amy Jalewalia (33.4 ppg, 11.8 rebounds), a 6-1 
guard-forward-center who last year led the state in scoring. Heather Brannan, a 
5-11 senior forward, averages 15.0 points and 11.8 rebounds a game. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded Palm Desert starts a good-sized lineup including leading scorers 
Tisa Read (5-10) and Brenda Joyce (5-10) each of whom average about 12 points. 
Senior guard Christie Dammer, whom coach Randy Housken calls the best defensive 
guard in Southern California, will attempt to stop Jalewalia. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Brea-Olinda (28-0) vs Alemany (20-6) at Esperanza High School -- Top-seeded 
Brea-Olinda has trounced two playoff opponents. The Lady Cats, the defending 
division champions, are led by state player of the year Aimee McDaniel and 
all-state guard Tammy Blackburn. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany, the fourth-seeded team in the division, is led in scoring by 5-2 
sophomore Rachel Corelli (10 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes (26-4) vs. Estancia (14-12) at University High School -- Unseeded 
Estancia has come on strong in the playoffs, upsetting third-seeded Lompoc in 
the quarterfinals, thanks to a school-record 42-point performance by junior 
guard Melody Earle. 
</P>
<P>
Patrice Lumpkin, a 5-10 forward, averages 12.6 points a game. Forward Monique 
Sweet also provides some solid play. 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes has won the Bay League title and reached the playoffs the past 
three seasons, advancing to the 4-A semifinals last year. The Sea Kings have a 
definite height advantage with three starters at least 6 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Humphreys, a 5-10 senior forward leads the Sea Kings in scoring with 15.2 
points. 
</P>
<P>
In the 3-A: 
</P>
<P>
San Dimas (16-6) vs Rancho Alamitos (20-3) at Bolsa Grande High School -- 
Rancho Alamitos, the top-seeded team in the division, is led by Jenny Newsome, 
a 5-9 senior who averages 24 points and 12 rebounds a game. San Dimas relies 
heavily on inside scoring, which should contrast strongly with the Vaqueros 
up-tempo style. 
</P>
<P>
Natalie Kramer, a 5-11 senior center, and Shelly Baughn a 5-11 junior post 
player each average 15 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
South Hills (19-5) vs. Costa Mesa (15-11) at Estancia High School -- Costa Mesa 
is undoubtedly the Cinderella team of the division. The unseeded Mustangs were 
third in the Pacific Coast League, but they are in the semifinals after 
upsetting third-seeded Bellflower convincingly and defeating Notre Dame of 
Sherman Oaks in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
The Mustangs are led by Orange County's best freshman -- Olivia DiCamilli. 
</P>
<P>
DiCamilli (5-10) averages 14.8 points and 11.8 rebounds but she's scoring more 
points in the playoffs. Junior forward Rachel Ward averages 10.8 points and 
senior guard Thuy Nguyen, a three-point threat, averages 11.1 points. Senior 
Michele Bryant runs the point and junior Robin Nichols is the fifth starter. 
</P>
<P>
Second-seeded South Hills defeated at-large Yucca Valley by 14 points in the 
second round, then edged Cabrillo, another at-large team, by six points in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
In the 2-AA: 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ynez Valley (20-3) vs Santa Margarita (20-6) at Saddleback College at 7 
p.m. -- Santa Margarita, the fourth-seeded team in the division, meets its 
stiffest competition in top-seeded Santa Ynez Valley. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles are led by sophomore Kristen Mulligan, the only Santa Margarita 
player who averages in double figures (22.1 ppg). 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ynez Valley has plenty of height. Amy Kisling (5-11) leads Santa Ynez 
Valley with 14.2 points a game, followed by 5-11 Amy Gillingham (11.2 ppg) and 
5-2 Jenifer DeMatteo (11 ppg).
