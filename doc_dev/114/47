<LEADPARA>  Wilma Dyche, a longtime resident of both the Pajaro and Santa Clara valleys
who had been in failing health for several years, died Monday in Watsonville
at the age of 93. She was a musician and a church organist, but she played no
religious favorites.;    Mrs. Dyche was born a Methodist, so it was natural
that she started playing the organ at the First United Methodist Church of
Watsonville. It was a reed instrument; pumping its pedals fills the bellows
and makes the sound.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When the First Christian Church of Watsonville was rebuilt after several
fires, it had a new organ -- a pipe organ -- no pedals, no pumping, and those
pipes filled the sanctuary with chords.;    "It was like dangling a carrot,"
said Mrs. Dyche's daughter, Ayleen Martin of Watsonville. First Christian
wanted Mrs. Dyche, and she wanted that pipe organ, Martin said. She played it
virtually every Sunday for more than 30 years.;    "The pipe organ is the king
of instruments," said Inez Jefferson, a friend of Mrs. Dyche's. She knows that
because she also played church organs in San Jose and also taught piano.;   
Mrs. Dyche closed out her career as a Watsonville church organist with a
several-year stint at All Saints' Episcopal Church, where Martin was a
member.;    Mrs. Dyche had graduated with a degree in music from College of
the Pacific when it was still in San Jose, then married Justin K. Dyche, a
Watsonville High School teacher who died in 1953.;    Mrs. Dyche was a
teacher, too. She taught scores of Pajaro Valley youngsters how to play the
piano, then continued doing the same for many years after moving to the Santa
Clara Valley in the late 1960s.;    Mrs. Dyche belonged to the Music Teachers
Association of Santa Clara County and the American Guild of Organists. For
more than 50 years she was a member of the PEO Sisterhood, a philanthropic and
educational organization seeking opportunities in higher education for women.;
