   Artisans are re-creating one of the great
moments of archaeology on an island south of Cairo.
   On Nov. 26, 1922, English archaeologist Howard Carter opened the
tomb of the boy Pharaoh Tutankhamun and found a glittering world of
delicate statues, inlaid chests, feather-light fans and decorated
coffins of solid gold.
   The riches he discovered amazed the world.
   Now, 68 years after Carter peered into the small tomb in
southern Egypt, the artisans are fashioning Tut's netherworld once
again, working from photographs and other records. The replicas of
Tut's treasures are to be entombed as the archaeologist saw them.
   Twenty-two artists, sculptors, engineers and university students
are rekindling craftsmanship unseen since the days of the Pharaohs.
   They are halfway through their assignment: to duplicate his
four-chambered tomb and 1,000 of the 1,703 Tut objects in the
Egyptian Museum, as they were left by priests 3,313 years ago and
the robbers who came later.
   Ever-watchful jackals, goddesses in sleek gowns, open-mouthed
lions and even the boy Pharaoh himself, out for a walk in thonged
sandals, cram the bustling workshop on Jacob's Island.
   A year from now, every day on Jacob's Island will be Nov. 26,
1922.
   Until then, people wanting to marvel at King Tut's storied world
must travel to the two places they have visited for decades: the
treasure hoard in Cairo's Egyptian Museum and his tomb, with the
mummy, 450 miles to the south, in the Valley of the Kings.
   ``It's the wonder that we must produce in our tomb - the shock,
which you don't feel when you see the objects away from the tomb,''
said Mahmoud Mabrouk, a sculptor and art professor who directs the
Jacob's Island project.
   ``We work as a team, just as the ancients did,'' he said.
   Novices think Tut's treasures were all of solid gold. There was
plenty of that, but there also were objects of wood, silver and
other metals, alabaster, ivory, leopard skins, leather, pottery and
gemstones.
   Decisions on whether to replicate individual items, big or
small, were based on whether they were important to history or to
art knowledge.
   The project is costing 1 million Egyptian pounds (almost
$360,000) and is the brainchild of former diplomat Hassan Ragab, an
entrepreneur who revived Egypt's extinct papyrus industry.
   In 1985 he opened his Pharaonic Village on Jacob's Island, where
tourists come to view life from the days of King Tut, but without
the boy Pharaoh himself.
   ``Dr. Ragab asked me to create a full-scale tomb with exact
copies of objects so that tourists would feel the wonder as Carter
felt it,'' Mabrouk said. ``The tomb was no problem, but nobody knew
how to make the objects. Everybody I talked with told me to refuse
the offer.''
   Mabrouk, who advises an international committee working to save
the Sphinx, said he accepted the challenge for two reasons.
   ``First, I wanted to enter the mind of the ancient artist,'' he
said. ``What kind of people were these, to create things so
beautiful, but things that would never be seen by the living?
   ``Today, we artists have exhibitions and everybody congratulates
us. Not these artists. Their creations were locked up with Tut.''
   The second reason harks back to Mabrouk's childhood.
   ``I was 12 when my brother and I saw the Tut collection in the
museum,'' he said. ``We were so happy, but we were sad. The objects
were beautiful, but nobody knew anything about them.''
   ``I want Egyptian youth to look back on their history with a
sense of pride, a sense of identity. It's an Arab problem that
Egyptians turn their backs on anything about the Pharaohs.''
   Mabrouk said he is astounded by the quality of Tut relics. ``We
had to start with the simplest items,'' he said. ``Once we mastered
the techniques, we could tackle the most difficult.''
   Reproduction has been made more difficult because objects in the
museum must be examined from behind glass and many Tut objects are
locked in storerooms. Books contain conflicting information, and
Mabrouk said many of Carter's notes are inaccurate.
   Even lowly artifacts proved tricky. A simple pair of sandals
took three months to reproduce.
   Many of the 50 alabaster items from the tomb were lovingly
worked with exquisite designs. Alabaster posed one of the toughest
challenges.
   ``We spent six months working in alabaster factories outside the
Valley of the Kings, just to see how to use the stone,'' Mabrouk
said. ``We finally made three simple vases, but even that took a
month.''
   Still to come are Tutankhamun's gold death mask and the
elaborately inlaid gold sarcophagus.
   ``Sometimes you just have to compromise,'' Mabrouk said. ``We'll
use gold-plated copper instead of gold, but the effect will be the
same.''
