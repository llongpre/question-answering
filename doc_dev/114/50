Three weeks ago, there was little doubt as to the team to beat in the Southern 
Section 4-A water polo playoffs. Corona del Mar High School stood alone. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings were undefeated and the odds-on favorite to win their third 
consecutive 4-A title. The came the fall, three losses which cost Corona del 
Mar the Sea View League title and the No. 1 ranking in the 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
Filling the void is El Dorado, champions of the Empire League. The Golden Hawks 
defeated Corona del Mar twice in the last three weeks, including the 
championship game of the California State tournament. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, El Dorado (22-3) is the No. 1 seeded team going into the playoffs, 
which begin Friday. Villa Park (22-4) is the second-seeded team, Sea View 
League champion Newport Harbor (17-9) third and Long Beach Wilson (17-8) 
fourth-seeded. 
</P>
<P>
And Corona del Mar? For the first time this decade, the Sea Kings are not one 
of the top four seeded teams. 
</P>
<P>
Success is nothing new to the Golden Hawks, who won three consecutive 3-A 
titles from 1985-87. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Hawks, who are led by Matt Maclear and Kyle Utsumi, will play Long 
Beach Poly (10-10) at El Dorado in the first round on Friday.
