Two national-caliber rivalries will continue today in the Kenny Staub 
cross-country invitational at Crescenta Valley Park in La Crescenta. 
</P>
<P>
The girls' teams from Agoura and Palos Verdes highs will meet for the second 
time this season, and Charger standout Deena Drossin and Westlake's Jeannie 
Rothman will toe the starting line for their third meeting this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Agoura edged the Sea Kings, 61-62, in the Woodbridge Invitational on Sept. 15. 
Palos Verdes and Agoura finished first and second, respectively, in the state 
Division I championships the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers and the Sea Kings are the second- and third-ranked teams in the 
country, according to The Harrier magazine, a cross-country publication. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin is undefeated in three races this season, including course-record 
performances in the Seaside and Woodbridge invitationals. Rothman twice has 
lost to Drossin this season. 
</P>
<P>
Drossin won the state Division I title in 1989 and Rothman finished third. Both 
runners were Kinney national qualifiers last year. 
</P>
<P>
Individual contenders in the boys' races include Agoura's Mike Cherman and Ryan 
Wilson, Newbury Park junior Jeff Wilson and Westlake's Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
The Thousand Oaks boys' team and boys and girls from Quartz Hill also will 
compete. MIKE GLAZE
