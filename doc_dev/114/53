<LEADPARA>  Supervisor Ed Campbell of Fremont said Monday night that a battle is brewing
between two of his colleagues to the north over Alameda County's need to
redraw its supervisorial districts.;    While public testimony at four
hearings on the issue has been meager, Campbell said reapportionment could
produce an ugly squabble between board President Mary King of Oakland and
Supervisor Don Perata of Alameda.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A population boom in southern Alameda County means both King and Perata
must shift their districts southward. But neither appears willing to abandon
any of their power base in Oakland, Campbell said.;    "This thing's going to
get messy," Campbell observed after a sparsely attended public hearing in
Fremont. "They feel Oakland is their vote base.";    Neither Perata nor King
attended Monday night's hearing, which drew testimony from just three people.;
   Afterward, Campbell said the apparent lack of public interest in the
remapping wouldn't translate into a lack of political interest on the part of
his two colleagues who represent the county's midsection.;    Perata's
District 3 includes the island community of Alameda and portions of East
Oakland, while King's District 4 covers portions of Oakland along with San
Leandro and Castro Valley.;    Both will need to slide their districts south
or east to help bring districts into balance.;    But, Campbell contended,
neither Perata nor King appears interested in giving up the traditionally more
liberal and ethnically diverse sections of Oakland to head into more suburban
and conservative communities to the south.;    Supervisor Warren Widener of
Berkeley, who did attend the hearing, said he had little choice in the matter
but to slide south because his District 5 is bounded elsewhere by the county
line and the bay.;    The board, meanwhile, plans to release its first maps of
new district boundaries on June 1. The supervisors are scheduled to vote on a
plan June 11.;    Campbell, who represents Fremont and the Livermore Valley,
must give up 41,837 constituents to help bring his district back into balance.
He previously suggested doing this by giving up that many constituents in
Fremont while keeping the Livermore Valley intact.;    "I don't think people
in my district will get real vocal one way or another" about how the lines are
drawn, Campbell said.;    The turnout for Monday night's hearing seemed to
support his theory. No representative of Fremont city government even showed
up to speak.;    Gina Javier, who represents the National Filipino American
Political Association, said Asian groups would be watching the plans carefully
and hoped to come up with a proposal of their own.;    Kathy Vennemeyer, a
Newark resident, said she'd like to see Fremont, Newark and Union City
represented by a single supervisor, rather than split into two districts.  </TEXT>
