<HEADLINE>  LIBRARY FORCED TO CUT HOURS
SCOTTS VALLEY BRANCH FEELS CITY BUDGET PINCH  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "It breaks my heart to reduce the number of hours," said Anne M. Turner,
director of libraries. "All our branches are busy, and the Scotts Valley
branch is  among the busiest. But it was purely a financial decision.";   
Turner said the cuts are necessary because the Scotts Valley City Council
voted not to renew its contract with the library system to pay for hours over
the allotted 32 per week. During the past two years, Scotts Valley's contract
had allowed the library, which is in the Kings Village shopping center on
Mount Hermon Road, to remain open longer.;    "It's terribly sad to have to
make this kind of cut," said Mary Ann Kaplan, chairwoman of the Library
Oversight Committee, which approved the cut. "We know how much the people of
Scotts Valley have valued added public library service. With the added hours,
book checkouts skyrocketed, and use by children and their parents really
increased.";    Noting that the Scotts Valley branch library had been open 37
hours a week before the city began contributing money, Scotts Valley officials
say they feel the city is being unfairly punished because it is not renewing
its $52,000 contract this year because of budget problems.;    "I think it's
callous," said Scotts Valley Mayor Joe Miller. "The city has proven itself as
a friend to the library in good times. Readership has increased over the past
two years. If they were going to be fair to the people who use that library,
they really would consider extending the hours to 42.";    Turner said the
cuts were not punitive.;    "Scotts Valley (officials) felt they were paying
for an additional 17 hours of service, but in 1988 and '89, the year they
first funded their contract, we cut the hours at all the other branches,"
Turner said. "We would have cut Scotts Valley's hours as well if they hadn't
already funded the additional hours. They were paying for 22 additional hours,
not 17.";    The Santa Cruz Public Library system has operated under a joint
powers agreement between the county and city of Santa Cruz since 1917. Hours
at the 10 branches in the system are set by the library oversight committee.
Without additional funding, Turner said increasing the hours at one branch
would force the library to reduce the hours at another one.;     IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED; Until further notice, the Scotts Valley library will be open from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Tuesdays; from noon to 8 p.m. on Wednesdays and
Thursdays; from noon to 5 p.m. on Fridays; and from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on
Saturdays.  </TEXT>
