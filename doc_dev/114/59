   Two small pyramids built for the wives of Pharoah
Pepi I were discovered under mounds of sand by French scientists
who say the find could shed light on a dynasty that ruled Egypt
more than 2,000 years before Jesus was born.
   The discovery was announced Friday by members of the French
Archaeological Mission at Sakkara and scientists from Electricite
de France, the state-owned utility which conducted a high-tech
exploration at the site about 20 miles south of Cairo.
   The Sakkara site contains the step pyramid built by King Zoser,
said to be the first stone structure in history, and other
pyramids. The discovery of the queens' tombs brings to 85 the
number of known pyramids in Egypt.
   One pyramid is in ruins, but the second could contain
subterranean funeral chambers decorated with hieroglyphics, said
Jacques Montlucon, who led the utility's team.
   In the 19th century, the 50-acre Sakkara site served as a quarry
from which stone was taken for building in Cairo. For the last 25
years or so, extensive digging around the pyramid of Pepi I has
left a field of rubble at the site.
   ``It looks like a battlefield there,'' said Montlucon, adding
that the pyramids were covered by ``eight meters (about 26{ feet)
of rubbish.''
   ``In such disturbed land, it would be practically impossible to
find anything, to know where to begin to dig, without our current
technology,'' he said.
   Last summer Montlucon supervised the conservation of artifacts
retrieved from the wreck of the Titanic.
   He said the electromagnetic tests used at Sakkara were developed
by the French utility for conducting geophysical tests at potential
nuclear reactor sites.
   Using test results, the team put together a map pinpointing five
possible pyramid sites. Three sites were then excavated.
   The first hole revealed a highly decorated mastaba, or tomb, of
a dynastic official. Weeks passed before workers finally hit the
stone of a pyramid on Feb. 12.
   ``I was in the big pyramid when the foreman came running in
shouting `Mabrouk!' (congratulations),'' Montlucon said. ``I felt
so happy I could have cried.''
   Workers dug out a ``buttonhole'' through which they could see a
segment of the pyramid wall, smooth and gold in color. The French
archaeological team will ask permission from the Eygptian
Antiquities Organization to begin full excavation next year on the
pyramid, thought to be 66 feet tall and 66 feet at the base.
   The find is ``a big gain for Egyptology'' and ``will allow us to
know more, possibly a great deal more, about the 6th Dynasty'' that
ruled the Nile Valley from 2420 to 2258 B.C., Montlucon said.
   Archaeologists are hoping the pyramid contains hieroglyphic
inscriptions that can be added to the Pyramid Texts, the oldest
writings known to man. The archaeologists also hope the writing
will reveal the name of the pharaoh's wife, shrouded by the
centuries, who is buried there.
