<LEADPARA>  Despite its image as a region with affluent residents, good schools and
plentiful services, a recently released United Way study shows thousands of
Tri-Valley residents are at serious risk because of a lack of health and other
services in the area.;    The report, a 17-month study that assessed social
service needs in Alameda County, found that not only are there large numbers
of poor people in the eastern and southern part of the county, but also there
are few services for them. Children, seniors, drug abusers and minority groups
also lack help.  </LEADPARA>

SERVICES LACKING, SAYS UNITED WAY REPORT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     "The biggest problem we have is the image of affluence," said Kathie
Herwatt, executive director of the Valley Community Health Center in
Livermore, more than 90 percent of whose clients are below the federal poverty
level.;    That image goes back to at least 1982 when a United Way assessment
of services in the Livermore-Amador Valleys found that funding sources tended
to view valley residents as affluent and expected them to be able to pay for
services.;    Cities get more funds;  As a result, "Historically, Oakland and
Berkeley have gotten the most attention from funders because of the multitude
of problems those cities face," said Jim Stafford, spokesman for the United
Way of the Bay Area.;    Stafford said he expects the new study to change the
way eastern and southern Alameda County are viewed by public and private grant
organizations.;    "We hope the study will shift the use of our own money to
include south and east county," he said.;    For many poor
Pleasanton-Livermore-Dublin residents, getting services means going "over the
hill" to Hayward and Oakland for services.;    "That's a two and a half hour
trip by bus," said Herwatt. "Another misconception is that everyone in the
Tri-Valley can afford to drive a car.";    Variety of problems cited; 
According to the report, these are among the problems in the Tri-Valley area
and southern Alameda County, from Hayward to Fremont:;    (check) Indigent
pregnant women who are new patients wait up to six weeks to get a prenatal
care appointment at east and south county community clinics. At Valley
Community Health Center, half of all pregnant patients do not seek medical
care until the second trimester, and 20 percent wait until the third
trimester.;    (check) Half of all new pediatric patients at Valley Community
Health Center are under-immunized.;    Only one hospital;  (check) Highland
Hospital in Oakland is the only facility providing hospital care, emergency
services and night and weekend care for poor people throughout the county.;   
(check) Legal assistance organizations that serve specific cultural
populations are all located in Oakland.;    (check) There is a three- to
four-month waiting time for children and families needing county mental health
services in the Livermore-Amador Valleys.;    (check) The county child sexual
abuse treatment program has documented a three to four month waiting list in
the Hayward area and two months in Fremont.;    (check) There are no gay and
lesbian outreach programs in the Tri-Valley area.;    (check) There are no
senior day health care centers currently operating in south or east county.;  
 (check) There are no low-cost drug and alcohol residential programs in the
Livermore-Amador Valleys, although 40 percent of all new adult patients at the
Valley Community Health Center are alcohol and drug abusers. Thirty percent of
that group report a history of needle use and are at high risk for AIDS.;   
Herwatt and other social service agency officials in south and east county say
the United Way report is the first of its kind to accurately assess the needs
of their areas, and they said they hope the findings reach area funding
sources.;    Robert Fisher, executive director of the San Francisco
Foundation, said the lack of services in the Tri-Valley area is evident from
the low number of grants awarded in the area.;    "It's clear the non-profit
community in the Livermore Valley is underdeveloped because fund-raising for
the area is underdeveloped," said Fisher, whose organization awards grants to
non-profit agencies throughout the Bay Area.;    However, Mary King, president
of the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, said the report would most likely
not put added emphasis on the Tri-Valley or south county.;    "The (report)
demonstrates how out of control health costs are and how they are impacting
people from all socio-economic backgrounds," she said. "The bottom line is,
we're still going to set priorities as resources continue to dwindle. You just
can't compare infant mortality in east Oakland versus Livermore.";    King
said alternatives to increased funding would have to be found, such as more
volunteer programs and mobile social service programs.;    Ethnic
distribution;  The United Way report cites a shift in ethnic and age
distributions in the eastern and southern sections of the county as the reason
for the increased need for social services in those areas.;    According to
figures from the state Department of Finance, two-thirds of the county's
Hispanic population lives in southern and eastern Alameda County, with 17
percent in the Hayward-San Leandro area and 18 percent in the Tri-Cities.;   
About 40,000 Filipinos live in Alameda County, with most living in the south
county cities of Hayward, San Leandro, Castro Valley and Union City.;    The
Tri-Cities has the largest Asian and Pacific Islander population in Alameda
County with 26,541 residents. Fremont is second to Oakland with 13,233.  </TEXT>
