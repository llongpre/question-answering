</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A group of granite monoliths and towering walls often referred to as "Africa's 
greatest mystery" lie half-buried 200 miles southeast of this capital city. 
</P>
<P>
What the Great Pyramids are to Egypt, Great Zimbabwe is to Zimbabwe -- an 
enduring reminder of a civilization long gone. 
</P>
<P>
Covering 1,780 acres, this national monument is three groups of stone 
structures: the Hill Complex, the Great Enclosure or Great House and the Valley 
Complex. 
</P>
<P>
Evolving from a small settlement, Great Zimbabwe flourished under the Shona and 
Karanga civilizations between the 13th and 15th centuries. 
</P>
<P>
It was ruled by a succession of kings whose influence spread throughout what is 
now Zimbabwe. Its growth was stimulated by the gold trade, and gold mining and 
smelting operations were among its main occupations. 
</P>
<P>
On the edge of a 300-foot granite cliff, the Hill Complex, the oldest section, 
was the home of kings. The ridge is occupied by several small enclosures that 
were used for rituals. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Zimbabwe soapstone birds, artistic symbols of the country's past, 
were discovered in one ritual enclosure. The birds are now on Zimbabwe's flag 
and currency and on the crest of the nation's coat of arms. 
</P>
<P>
In a valley at the southern foot of the hill is the Great Enclosure, the 
largest and best preserved of Great Zimbabwe's ruins. 
</P>
<P>
This was the home of the king's wives. Built after the Hill Complex, its 
massive outer wall is 36 feet high and 800 feet in circumference. It contains 
nearly 60,000 cubic feet of stonework. 
</P>
<P>
A chevron design along the top of the Great Enclosure's wall is of the type 
found in other African countries. It is believed to represent the snake of 
fertility that promises a continuing line of descendants. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Enclosure's impressive conical tower was thought to have been built 
at the same time as the outer wall. It is also 36 feet high and has a 
circumference of 56 feet at its base. 
</P>
<P>
The builders of Great Zimbabwe left no records of their activities, so the 
function of the tower remains open to conjecture. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching across the valley are the remains of the dry-stone enclosures that 
make up the Valley Complex. Numerous relics have been uncovered there, and 
archeologists believe that dignitaries of the king's court lived in the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
Before exploring the three ruins, visit the site museum, which contains a 
display of artifacts, including the Great Zimbabwe birds. The museum hours are 
8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The entire national monument closes at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Lodging and camping accommodations are available a short distance from the 
monument at Masvingo and at the Lake Kyle recreation park. 
</P>
<P>
Eastward, near Bulawayo, stands the nation's second-largest archeological find, 
the Khami ruins. 
</P>
<P>
Chinese porcelain of the Wan-Li period (1573-1619), found in the stonework, is 
believed to have reached Khami with early Portuguese explorers or traders. 
</P>
<P>
But it is Great Zimbabwe that remains the most spectacular of Southern Africa's 
ancient ruins.
