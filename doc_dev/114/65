   Whether belching with smoke or strangely
silent, the mills of this once-mighty steel valley have been a
magnet for visiting notables over the decades.
   Britain's Prince Edward, later King Edward VII, toured the
area's mills and factories during his visit to the United States in
1860.
   Prince Don Gelasio Caetani, ambassador from Italy to the United
States, visited the mills of nearby Homestead in 1923. Sweden's
Prince Bertil followed in 1938.
   ``The bold energy and ceaseless inventive imagination displayed
by your industry seems to me to be the surest token of success for
the future,'' Prince Bertil said.
   Even Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, traveling through the
United States prior to a 1959 summit meeting with President
Eisenhower, toured a factory with his wife.
   Krushchev startled everyone when he gave his watch to a
steelworker who had offered him a cigar.
   Constantine, crown prince of Greece, saw a mill during a brief
visit to Pittsburgh in 1959. King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand
and his queen toured a plant the following year.
   The latest member of royalty to venture into the Monongahela
River Valley just south of Pittsburgh will be Britain's Prince
Charles. He doesn't plan to tour any steel mills, but will travel
past them on his way to a meeting with urban experts in Homestead
on Friday.
   Although the steel industry has declined precipitously,
Homestead Acting Mayor Joseph Little, like most everybody else
around this town of 5,000, is proud of the crowd his valley has
drawn.
   ``Homestead was a great town. It still is a great town,'' Little
said. ``We've just got to get something going for us. There won't
be any harm done as far as Prince Charles coming in.''
