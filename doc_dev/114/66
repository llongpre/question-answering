<TEXT>     Police refused to say how he was identified as a suspect.;    Los Angeles
police Cmdr. Rick Dinse, who is heading the department's investigation of the
King beating, said that he asked the California Attorney General's Office on
Wednesday to take over the robbery investigation to avoid "the problems of
appearance of conflict of interest.";    The U.S. Justice Department and the
Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office are investigating the Los
Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division, where both the beating and the
holdup took place.;    King, who is on parole for using a tire iron to rob a
suburban Monterey Park grocer in 1989, could not be reached for comment.  </TEXT>
