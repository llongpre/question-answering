Jordan's King Hussein said over the weekend that he was ready to meet
Israel's prime minister, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, for the first time in public, in
return for US financial aid.
He said Washington had promised to waive about Dollars 950m of debt owed by
Jordan and help with the modernisation of the kingdom's armed forces if he
met with the Israeli premier.
'If the meeting between me and the Israeli prime minister is a price to
change the picture of this country, I will not hesitate at all and consider
it a service for my country,' he told the parliament.
Israeli officials yesterday welcomed the king's statement, and suggested a
summit could take place in mid-October in Cairo. Mr Yossi Beilin, Israel's
deputy foreign minister, said King Hussein's decision was 'courageous'.
Last month, the king announced that Jordan would push ahead in its peace
talks with Israel and could no longer wait for progress on the other tracks.
Frustrated with the lack of co-ordination with the Palestinians and Syrians,
he said that from now on Jordan would look after its own needs.
Next week Jordanian and Israeli negotiators are to meet in Jordan near the
1967 ceasefire line just north of Aqaba to discuss border demarcations. It
will be the first time that Israeli officials publicly enter Jordanian
territory.
Later Mr Shimon Peres, Israeli foreign minister, and Mr Warren Christopher,
US secretary of state, are due to attend the opening session of another
round of talks in the Jordan Valley on economic co-operation. Subjects to be
covered include a Dollars 3bn canal project to join the Red Sea to the Dead
Sea and joint development projects in the Jordan Valley.
