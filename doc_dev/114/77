The Bakersfield West High soccer team was not exactly in the Christmas spirit 
during a championship semifinal match against Simi Valley on Friday night, but 
that didn't stop the Blades from giving the Pioneers a couple of presents 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
And Simi Valley, in Scrooge-like fashion, did not respond in kind while taking 
a 3-2 victory at Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
At the five-minute mark in the first half, Simi Valley forward Kenny Greninger 
booted a shot in front of the West goal that struck Viking defender Eric 
Fambrough in the chest before dropping across the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Four minutes later, West defender Tom Latham nailed a keeper pass back to 
goalkeeper Steve Vesper which rolled between Vesper's legs and into the net for 
a 2-0 Simi Valley lead. 
</P>
<P>
Pioneer forward Spencer Belideau was credited with the second goal. 
</P>
<P>
The Pioneers (8-0) took a 3-0 advantage six minutes into the second half when 
midfielder Craig Hampton, on a corner kick from Brian Weaver, directed a head 
shot into the upper-middle portion of the net. 
</P>
<P>
West made it close on goals by Juan Cruz, on a head shot, and Francis Gangle. 
</P>
<P>
In another tournament match: 
</P>
<P>
Royal 2, Simi Valley JV 1 -- Striker Matt Brinkman scored on a bonus penalty 
kick at the 16-minute mark in the second half to put the Highlanders (6-0-1) 
into the tournament championship match against Marmonte League rival Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Brinkman's initial attempt was blocked but the senior was awarded another kick 
because Pioneer goalkeeper Mike Jones moved before Brinkman kicked the ball. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley tied the score, 1-1, five minutes into the second half on a head 
shot from a yard out by freshman forward Kevin Mykolyk. 
</P>
<P>
Royal led, 1-0, at halftime after striker Mario Andrews scored on Daniel 
Morris' rebound shot at the 10-minute mark. MIKE GLAZE
