For the first half of Crescenta Valley's Southern Section 4-A Division playoff 
opener Wednesday night, it appeared as if Falcon senior guard David Bayles 
would be relegated to a cameo role. 
</P>
<P>
Reasoning that Bayles' poor outside shooting would not help Crescenta Valley's 
cause against the 3-2 press of Newbury Park, Coach John Goffredo sat him down 
58 seconds into the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
But Bayles' bid for playoff heroics wasn't over. When Newbury Park switched to 
a 2-3 zone in the second half, Bayles caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
Bayles scored all of his career-high 14 points in the fourth quarter as 
Crescenta Valley ran off a late flurry to take a 74-65 win at Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Bayles' timely run and Crescenta Valley's superior balance was more than enough 
to put away the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park forward Wayne Cook scored a game-high 30 points, but his team went 
cold in the final three minutes. He made 13 of 27 field-goal attempts as the 
team consistently looked to him for the big basket. 
</P>
<P>
"He's our No. 1 player and the best athlete I've ever coached," Newbury Park 
Coach Ken Barone said. "So he has to have the green light to shoot whenever he 
wants." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Bayles who shot down Newbury Park (13-11). 
</P>
<P>
Trailing, 59-58, with 2:55 to play, Crescenta Valley (16-8) mounted a 14-6 run. 
</P>
<P>
Bayles scored eight of the Falcons' points in the run, scoring on a jump shot, 
two layups and a pair of free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Cook tried in vain to answer Bayles, scoring seven of Newbury Park's final 18 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, a senior who will attend UCLA on a football scholarship in the fall, made 
three of six from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Cook, however, was unable to do it alone. Crescenta Valley held a 48-47 lead 
heading into the fourth quarter, but outscored Newbury Park, 26-18, over the 
final eight minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Cook was one of only two Panthers to reach double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Falzone scored 11 for Newbury Park and teammate Amir El Farra added 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
When it counted, Crescenta Valley knocked off Newbury Park with a depth charge. 
</P>
<P>
John Gilmore scored 12 points and teammates Paul Matijasevic and Brian Cortes 
each added 10. 
</P>
<P>
Lamar Breeding, who was promoted from the junior varsity last week, scored a 
career-high 15 points for Crescenta Valley, 13 in the first three quarters to 
keep the Falcons close.
