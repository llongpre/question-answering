   Workmen cleaning the dusty tomb of Ramses
II's beautiful Queen Nefertari found a fragment of beaten gold
jewelry that grave robbers and tourists apparently overlooked for
3,250 years.
   Resins clinging to the etched fragment indicate it may have been
attached originally to her missing mummy, Egyptian and American
officials said Tuesday in announcing the find.
   If the fragment is determined to have belonged to the queen, it
would be rare indeed. The only other surviving legacy of Nefertari
is the lid of her sarcophagus, on exhibit at the Turin Egyptian
Museum in Italy.
   Egyptian Culture Minister Farouk Hosni called the jewelry, which
is 1{ inches long and an inch wide, ``a significant discovery _
only the second object ever found that probably belonged to
Nefertari.''
   The piece resembles segments of armlets or bracelets surviving
from Ramses' New Kingdom era, with golden pieces linked by chains
and beads and decorated with flowers.
   The fragile gold sheet was in an anteroom behind the queen's
burial chamber, found during a project to stop the decay of
Nefertari's tomb in southern Egypt's Valley of the Queens.
Sponsored by the Egyptian Antiquities Organization and the Getty
Conservation Institute of Marina del Rey, Calif., the project began
18 months ago and is expected to last another 3{ years.
   With its splendid vividly colored wall paintings, Nefertari's is
the greatest among 80 tombs in shallow valleys called ``the place
of beauty.'' Royal wives and children were buried there in rock-cut
tombs opposite the ancient capital Thebes, now called Luxor, 450
miles south of Cairo.
   Luis Monreal, the Getty Institute's director, said nobody
believed anything of significance had escaped the attention of
grave robbers or the thousands of tourists and conservators who
visited the tomb since its discovery in 1904.
   Workmen inching across the floor of the tomb's final chamber,
clearing away the centuries of dust by hand, found the fragment on
Feb. 8, Monreal said.
   It lay ``covered by dust, then by broken bits of wall paintings
which in themselves were covered by layers of dust,'' he said.
   ``Another real bonus that we hadn't expected is that we
recovered pieces of a complete segment (of wall painting), which
will cover some 10 square feet when we reattach it to the rear
wall,'' he said.
   Although proof hasn't been found that the fragment was
Nefertari's, there are indications, including its hieroglyphic
inscriptions, Monreal said.
   Los Angeles-based British Egyptologist Helen Strudwick, who
studied the piece for Getty, found significance in the ritual
inscription ``true of voice,'' a phrase ancient Egyptians normally
used after the name of the person who died.
   She noted that the phrase had a feminine ending. That, plus the
fragment's discovery inside Nefertari's tomb, ``highly suggests''
that it was from the queen's burial paraphernalia, perhaps even
torn from her mummified body.
   ``The piece does not rank with the Tutankhamun treasure in
esthetic terms, but it still has historical and sentimental value
because the powerful Nefertari simply vanished,'' Monreal said.
   Nefertari, the beautiful and bold wife of warrior-hero Ramses
II, is thought to have died about age 45 about 3,250 years ago. Her
tomb paintings and inscriptions depict her as a woman of great
charm and exquisite taste, adorned with magnificent jewelry and
wearing fashionable gowns.
   Ramses' favorite of 13 wives, Nefertari accompanied her husband
in battle and helped negotiate the world's first peace treaty,
Ramses' agreement with the troublesome Hittites of Asia Minor. In
her famous temple at Abu Simbel, Nefertari is pictured begging
Ramses to be gentle with his captives.
   ``Nefertari was the world's first first lady,'' Monreal said.
``She was last seen accompanying her husband to consecrate the two
temples at Abu Simbel in 1255 B.C. Then we know nothing of her.
Maybe this piece will tell us about her death.''
