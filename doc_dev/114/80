<TEXT>     Police said King's "name came up" on Tuesday during an investigation of the
robbery but refused to say how he was identified as a suspect.;    Los Angeles
police Cmdr. Rick Dinse, who is heading the department's investigation of the
King beating, said that he contacted the California attorney general's office
on Wednesday and asked them to take over the robbery investigation.;    Double
investigation;  Both the U.S. Justice Department and the Los Angeles County
District Attorney's Office are investigating Los Angeles Police Department's
Foothill Division, where both the beating and the holdup took place.;   
"There is a crime report, and Mr. King is a suspect on it," Dinse said.;    "I
have requested the attorney general take over the case to avoid the problems
of appearance of conflict of interest, in all fairness to Mr. King and the
department," he said.;    "I have no doubt that our investigators are
perfectly able to conduct the investigation," Dinse added. "But we're trying
to decrease the perception that this department is out to get Mr. King. I
think that the attorney general's office is the way to do that.";    The Los
Angeles County district attorney's office agreed with the decision to call in
state prosecutors, a spokeswoman said.;    "We have told the Los Angeles
Police Department that it is not the appropriate agency to be investigating
this matter," said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for District Attorney Ira
Reiner.;    Officials in the California attorney general's office refused to
discuss the case.;    King, who is on parole for using a tire iron to rob a
suburban Monterey Park grocer in 1989, could not be reached for comment.;   
His attorney, who has filed an $83 million claim against the city for injuries
suffered by King during his March 3 beating at the hands of police, said that
he was unaware of the new allegation.;    "My client has not told me of any
involvement in the case," said attorney Steven Lerman. "We don't know about
it.";    Police officials initially declined to identify the video store, but
Dinse confirmed information obtained by the Los Angeles Daily News that it was
the Video All Stars store on Glenoaks Boulevard in Sun Valley.;    Marcos
Kaffdos, who owned the store at the time of the robbery but has since sold it,
said in an interview that a black man armed with a gun entered the store in
the early afternoon on Feb. 21.;    The robber fired a shot that hit one of
two women who were working in the store, said Kaffdos, who was not present at
the time of the robbery. The woman still is recovering from a gunshot wound to
the left shoulder, Kaffdos said.;    King, who was paroled on Dec. 27, was
reported speeding on March 3 by California Highway Patrol officers, who began
a chase that ended when he pulled over in the Los Angeles area of Lake View
Terrace.;    At least 21 Los Angeles Police Department officers were at the
scene, and some of them beat and kicked King while other officers watched.;   
A grand jury has indicted a sergeant and three officers on assault and other
felony charges. Those officers pleaded innocent on Tuesday.;    The scene was
captured on videotape by an amateur photographer, and has caused a nationwide
uproar over police brutality that has led to increasing pressure for the
resignation of Los Angeles police Chief Daryl F. Gates.;    Gates' shape-up
plan; Gates on Wednesday announced a 10-point plan aimed at restoring
confidence in his police department.;    He said he has asked retired state
Supreme Court Justice John Arguelles to head a five-member panel that will
examine incidents in which officers have used excessive force and recommend
reforms in police department policies.;    As Gates was going on the offensive
with his plan, Mayor Tom Bradley and Councilmen Michael Woo and Marvin Braude
were calling for the chief to resign.  </TEXT>
