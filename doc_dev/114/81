The words "Back to back Western State Conference champions" hang prominently 
below the scoreboard in the Santa Monica College gym. 
</P>
<P>
But any notions of "Threepeat" might be a bit premature for the Santa Monica 
men's basketball team after Valley snapped the Corsairs' 29-game conference 
winning streak with a 79-69 victory Wednesday night at Santa Monica. Valley 
improved to 3-0 in conference play, 12-8 overall; Santa Monica fell to 18-4, 
2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Valley had lost to Santa Monica in the championship game of the Antelope Valley 
tournament last month. However, the Monarchs were without the services of 
6-foot-5, 210-pound forward Shelton Boykin, who missed the game because of an 
ear infection. 
</P>
<P>
But Boykin (13 points) was back this time and made his presence felt early with 
a tomahawk dunk over a defender off the break and then hit a short jump shot in 
traffic during a 30-second span in the first half to give Valley an 18-7 
advantage at the 14:22 mark. 
</P>
<P>
"We were confident," Stephens said. "We're playing a lot better now and we're 
playing together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
Valley led, 54-42, with 16 minutes remaining, but Santa Monica closed to within 
62-60 with 7:40 to play on Chico Langston's breakaway layup. 
</P>
<P>
Valley's Erik McDaniels then hit two outside jump shots and Steve Ward tipped 
in a rebound as the Monarchs scored six unanswered points to squelch Santa 
Monica's rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Corsairs cut the lead to five, 74-69, with 51 seconds left, but sophomore 
guard Andre Harrell hit four consecutive free throws to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
"(Santa Monica) is a good team," Stephens said. "They're tough, we knew they 
were going to come back. They don't give up. We had some turnovers near the 
end, but we we're able to hang on." 
</P>
<P>
Ward led Valley scorers with 19 points and Harrell added 14. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica's Mark Moton scored 16 points and Donald Smith had 10. 
</P>
<P>
Valley jumped to a 12-3 advantage after 2 minutes, 45 seconds of play and never 
trailed thereafter. Santa Monica cut the lead to three, 25-22, with 10:09 left 
in the first half, but Valley went on a 7-0 run to increase its advantage to 10 
during a 2:34 span and led 45-38 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Valley will meet Glendale, which defeated Canyons in overtime 
Wednesday, 91-88.
