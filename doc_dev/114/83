Daniel Morris scored from 10 yards out with two minutes remaining to give Royal 
High a 3-2 upset victory over previously undefeated Simi Valley on Thursday 
night in a Marmonte League boys' soccer match. 
</P>
<P>
One minute after Morris scored on a penalty kick to give Royal a 1-0 lead in 
the second half, Daniel Anderson fouled Simi Valley striker Kenny Greninger, 
setting up a Pioneer penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
Greninger took the shot, but Royal goalkeeper Steven Hambly dived to his right 
and deflected it. Marc Cargnel gathered the rebound and fired from 12 yards. 
Hambly, barely off the ground after Greninger's shot, dived to his left and 
made the block. 
</P>
<P>
"After I saved it (the first time), I saw where it was going," Hambly said. "I 
knew it was coming, but I didn't know where it was going. I just reacted." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley (15-1, 1-1 in league play), ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section 
4-A Division, tied the score, 1-1, on Cargnel's head shot from 10 yards out at 
the 24-minute mark. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Brinkman found the lower left corner of the net on a penalty kick to give 
the Highlanders (11-2-1, 1-0) a 2-1 lead with 11 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
Three minutes later, Cargnel had scored what appeared to be the equalizing 
goal, but the score was negated because the Pioneers were offsides. 
</P>
<P>
With five minutes remaining, Simi Valley striker Brian Weaver's penalty kick to 
the upper left corner tied the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
Royal's victory avenged a 4-1 defeat to the Pioneers last month in the 
championship match of the Simi Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a local derby," Royal Coach Peter Schraml said. "It's emotional. The 
Valley pride is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley, however, was without the services of All-American midfielder Craig 
Hampton, who is playing with a U. S. national soccer team on the East Coast 
until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
But Simi Valley Coach Andy Silva said that the Pioneers' loss could not be 
attributed to Hampton's absence. 
</P>
<P>
"We miss him on the field, obviously, but we're not going to say that we lost 
because he wasn't here. It just wasn't meant to be today at all."
