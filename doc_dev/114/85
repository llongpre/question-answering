This game could have been played by plastic surgeons -- it was nip and tuck all 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
Valley College held on to first place by defeating visiting Moorpark College, 
83-80, in a Western State Conference game Saturday night in which the lead 
changed hands 15 times. The score also was tied more times, 10, than Michael 
Jackson has had nose jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a good game," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said. "Both teams played 
well. They hit some shots at the end, and that was key." 
</P>
<P>
With less than a half-minute remaining and Valley leading, 77-73, Valley's Rick 
Garrick broke free for a dunk. 
</P>
<P>
"They got that break there, and that made a big difference," Nordquist said. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Bruce Watson came back with a three-point basket to make the score 
79-76, but Garrick made four free throws in the last 16 seconds to protect 
Valley's margin. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew it was going to be a hard game," Valley Coach Jim Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing that surprised me, that I didn't anticipate, was Sam (Crawford) 
being able to shoot outside on us." 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, Moorpark's point guard, made a 35-foot, three-point heave at the 
final buzzer to finish with 25 points and five three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark never led by more than seven points, Valley never by more than six, in 
what was a crucial conference match-up for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
Valley (17-9, 7-1 in conference) won its first six conference games but lost at 
Santa Barbara on Wednesday and needed a victory to remain a half-game ahead of 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (16-8, 4-3) was attempting to bring front-running Valley back to the 
WSC pack as well as rebound from a loss Wednesday to Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
"You can only try to get the kids up for certain games," Stephens said. "We 
knew this was going to be tough." 
</P>
<P>
Valley led at halftime, 34-33. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them at half the difference was going to be on the boards, and Shelton 
(Boykin) and Shawn (DeLaittre) got us some defensive boards." 
</P>
<P>
Boykin finished with eight points and six rebounds. DeLaittre scored a 
team-high 24 points and grabbed eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"That's how we got here, him being inside," said Stephens, who began playing 
DeLaittre inside more often at the onset of WSC play. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best game he's had." 
</P>
<P>
Garrick scored 13, and Cliff Barnes and Steve Ward each added 12. Valley's 
Andre Harrell finished with 11. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Roger Thomas broke out of a mild scoring slump with 21 points. 
Watson made three second-half three-point shots for Moorpark and scored 15.
