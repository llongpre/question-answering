<DESCRIPT>  CASTRO-VALLEY; CITY; ELECTION; CAMPAIGN  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Faye Hahn has two weeks to collect 1,546 signatures if she wants Castro Valley
to have a chance at becoming a city.;    A petition to put the incorporation
of Castro Valley before voters has fallen short of the 6,328 valid signatures
needed to qualify for an election. Although Hahn's group, Citizens for Castro
Valley, collected the required number of signatures, only 4,782 were verified
by the county registrar of voters.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We have a tough time ahead of us," Hahn said. "We're going to be beating
the bushes now.";    The total signatures needed represent one-fourth the
number of registered voters in the community of about 50,000. Hahn said that
by filing the petitions on Dec. 31, more than $5 million in state taxes could
be saved by avoiding a change in tax laws for newly incorporated cities. The
registrar of voters randomly checked 5 percent of the names on the petitions
to see if any were not valid. According to state law, Hahn has 15 days to
supplement the list for any of the signatures that were disqualified.;    Hahn
said she has about 20 volunteers working to get more signatures and has
already collected an additional 500 signatures.;    "We had 314 duplicate
signatures. Some people may forget they already signed the petition. Some
people may be trying to sabotage our efforts," she said.;    Those supporting
incorporation point to the need for autonomy over such key local matters as
zoning, housing and city planning, as well as to combat expansion by Dublin
and Pleasanton.;    A feasibility study released last summer said the
community could govern itself without a tax increase -- provided Alameda
County continues subsidizing fire protection. The county subsidizes about $4
million of the fire district's $6 million budget. Even the most ardent
incorporation supporters say that without the subsidy, they would not support
making Castro Valley the county's 15th city.;    But members of the county
board of supervisors have said that as a city, Castro Valley would be expected
to pick up the fire protection tab. However, supervisors Mary King and Ed
Campbell, who were the most vocal regarding the fire protection issue,
endorsed negotiations between the county and community to find an alternative
plan for funding the fire district so that Castro Valley residents would not
be overburdened if it incorporates.;    Castro Valley -- one of the largest
unincorporated areas in the county and the state -- has been debating whether
to become a city since World War II. The last vote to incorporate Castro
Valley was 35 years ago, and it was defeated overwhelmingly.  </TEXT>
