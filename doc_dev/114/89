Antelope Valley College's excursion Saturday night onto the synthetic turf at 
East Los Angeles College was hardly what one would call a magic carpet ride. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley turned the ball over three times in the first quarter, fell 
behind, 21-0, and spent the remainder of the game playing catch-up in a 31-20 
Foothill Conference loss. 
</P>
<P>
East Los Angeles (3-3, 3-1 in conference play), the Foothill's top offensive 
team, piled up 408 yards against the conference's second-best defensive unit. 
But the Huskies turned the ball over six times, allowing Antelope Valley 
(3-3-1, 2-2-1) to stay close in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
ELAC's Adan Avina, the conference's leading rusher, gained 201 yards in 36 
carries and scored on runs of 10 and two yards. Avina also scored from 28 yards 
on a screen pass in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies' defense, ranked sixth in the conference, held Antelope Valley to 
two yards rushing and 146 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley quarterback Cole Speer threw a nine-yard touchdown pass to Abe 
Ivory late in the second quarter, and the Marauders trailed, 24-6, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley closed to within 24-12 when Ivory scored on a one-yard run 
after Birk Sopsher's interception of a Larry Razo pass in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
But Avina's two-yard touchdown run on the ensuing possession gave the Marauders 
a 19-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
Razo threw another interception, at the Huskies' two, and Ivory scored his 
third touchdown on a two-yard run late in the third quarter. JIM COLEMAN
