<P>
Joe Gordon of Simi Valley High came up short in his last shot at the Southern 
Section home run record Thursday when he went zero for four in the season 
finale, a 7-2 nonleague win over visiting L.A. Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
After Simi Valley jumped to a 6-0 first-inning lead, Coach Mike Scyphers 
cleared the bench, replacing every starter but Gordon and pitcher Jeff 
Treadway. 
</P>
<P>
Gordon finished the season with 15 home runs, tying Scott Sharts for the school 
record but leaving him one shy of the Southern Section record of 16 set by 
Channel Islands' Arnold Garcia in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Treadway (4-2), a freshman right-hander, earned the win. He struck out seven 
and allowed three hits in five innings.
