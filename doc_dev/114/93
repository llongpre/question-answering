<LEADPARA>  BO MAY know basketball, and Pete Wilson may know San Diego, Washington and a
little bit of Sacramento -- but does our new governor really know the great
state of California? Does he know Brite Valley, Dinkey Creek and Cow Hollow?; 
  Today, as Wilson marks his first full day as governor, we think it's time to
instruct him on the California mystique, at least as it shows up in the
wondrous names given to cities, villages and communities throughout the Golden
State.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Not surprisingly, sunny California contains a dozen sunny cities: Sun City,
Sunland, Sunnybrook, Sunnyside, Sunnyslope, Sunnyvale, Sunny Vista, Sunset,
Sunset Beach, Sunset Estates and two Sun Valleys.;    It should also go
without saying that in the Golden State one can pan for gold and come up with
communities named Fine Gold, Golden Hills, Golden Shores, Golden Valley, two
Gold Hills, a Gold Run, a Gold Springs and a Bonanza. (Also two Silver Cities,
a Silver Fork, Silver Lake, Silverpeak and Silver Strand. Not to mention
Diamond Bar and Diamond Springs.);    These names, however, don't even begin
to describe the amazing disparity of community names in a state large enough
to be a country.;    Downright delight is expressed in the more exuberant
California towns: Brite Valley, Eureka, Fair Play, Good Hope, Happy Camp,
Harmony Grove, Imperial, Industry, King City, Likely, Mecca, Nice, Paradise,
Pinnacle, Pleasant Grove, Pleasant Hill, Pleasanton, Pleasant Valley, Point
Pleasant, Rainbow, Rescue, Reward, Summit City, Talent, Ultra and Wonder
Valley.;    Some Californians can even say they live in Confidence, Freedom,
Independence or Tranquillity.;    But life is not all beer and skittles for
every Californian, alas. Pity those who make their homes in Badwater,
Bitterwater, Bummerville, Cave Junction, Death Valley, Devils Den, Dinkey
Creek, Drytown, Fallen Leaf, Hells Gate, Lost Hills, Weed Patch, Witch Creek
and Whiskeytown.;    The Post Office must do a few double takes when looking
at letters intended for the truly international state of California. We have
our own Albany, Bangor, Bridgeport (three of them), Dixieland, Las Vegas,
Pittsburg, Plymouth, Ponderosa, Quincy, Reno and West Point.;    It gets
better. You also can travel to California and find yourself in Arabia, Bagdad,
Dublin, Glasgow, Johannesburg, Tijuana, Venice or Waterloo.;    Or do you
prefer cities named for fruits, nuts and other edibles? Hey, we got 'em: Apple
Valley, Cabbage Patch, Coffee Creek, Fruitvale, Grapevine, Lemon Grove, Lemon
Valley, Orange Cove, Peanut, Pearblossom, Prunedale, Pumpkin Center, Raisin
City, Red Apple, Rice, two cities called Strawberry, one Strawberry Valley,
Sugar Loaf, Sugarloaf Village, Sugar Pine, Sugarpine, Walnut, Walnut Creek and
Walnut Grove.;    You can find local color in Auburn, Black Point, Blue
Diamond, Blue Lake, Blue Lakes, Browns Valley, Brownsville, Greenacres, Green
Acres, two Greenfields, Green Point, Green Valley, Greenview, Greenville,
Greenwood, Orange, Orange Cove, Orangevale, Red Bank, Red Bluff, Redlands and
Red Mountain.;    And California is absolutely overrun with places named for
birds, animals and fish: Antelope, Antelope Acres, Badger, Bass Lake, Birds
Landing, Bear Harbor, Bear Valley, Bear Valley Springs, Cockatoo Grove, Cow
Hollow, Coyote, Coyote Wells, Crows Landing, Deer Park, one Dog Town and two
Dogtowns.;    There's also an Eagle Lake Resort, an Eagle Mountain, an Eagle
Rock, an Eagles Nest, Eagleville, Eel Rock, Elk, Elk Creek, Elk Grove, Elk
Valley, Fish Camp, Fish Rock, Fish Springs, Forks of Salmon, Frogtown,
Gazelle, Horse Creek, Los Gatos (the cats), Owl, Pelican City, Quail Valley,
Salmon Creek, Seal Beach, Sheep Ranch, White Horse, White Wolf and Wolf.;   
Men's names were not forgotten when California cities were named: Broderick,
Bruceville, Clark, Clay, Clyde, Dawes, Denny, Douglas City, Felix, Freds
Place, Georgetown, Hector, Hercules, Joshua, Julian, King Cole, Kit Carson,
Leon, Lincoln, Maxwell, Peter Pam, Raymond, Ross, Salvador, Victor and
Vincent.;    By the way, there's also a community called Fellows, so all guys
are covered.;    Women have been remembered with Brenda, Elizabeth Lake,
Evelyn, Helena, Jenny Lind, Linda, Loraine, Lorella and Victoria.;    One
might expect a chorus or two of "Hail to the Chief" in Adams, Fillmore,
Jackson, Madison, Taft, Washington, Nixon and Ford City.;    And numerologists
must have named Four Corners, Five Corners, the two towns called Five Points,
Seven Pines, Three Arch Bay, Three Point and Three Rivers.;    We even have
our tree cities. Why not? Lone Pine, Palo Alto (tall tree), Poplar, Pine
Valley, Quaking Aspen, Tahoe Pines, Thousand Oaks, Thousand Palms, White Pines
and The Willows.;    At the very least the sheer beauty of California has
inspired the most descriptive, even poetic place names on the globe: Aerial
Acres, Alpine Hills, Alpine Meadows, Alpine Peaks, Angels Camp, Bee Rock,
Boyes Hot Springs, Clear Creek, Cliff House, Cold Springs, Desert Hot Springs,
Democrat Hot Springs, Flowing Wells and Fountain Valley.;    Also: Grand
Terrace, Grass Valley, Half Moon Bay, Hollow Tree, Hot Springs, Indian
Falls,Indian Springs, Indian Wells, Miracle Hot Springs, Mountain View,
Needles, Oceanside, Pacific Grove, Pebble Beach, Redwood City, Rolling Hills,
Sand City, Seaside, Sleepy Hollow and Whispering Pines.;    Which means, of
course, that there is absolutely no excuse for such no-name city names as
California City and National City.;    Some Golden State communities have
unique one-syllable names: Brant, Brea, Cobb, Cox, Crest, Day, Eads, Earp,
Field, Galt, Ganns, Gish, Glenn, Goffs, Grimes, Helm, Hilt, Hodge, Holmes,
Holt, Hood, Hume, Keyes, Klau, Knob, Knowles, Nairn, Palms, Pentz, Pike, Pond,
Priest, Sloan, Sloat, Sparks, Stent, Styx, Thorne, Troy, Twain, Watts and
Weed.;    Only a few are difficult to pronounce or spell: La Jolla,
Nipinnawassee, Tehachapi, Tassajara and Weitchpec.;    So one just has to
wonder how in the world we got stuck with all those downright silly-sounding
communities: Azusa, Calistoga, Ballarat, Bullhead City, Cupertino, Cuyamaca,
Darlingtonia, Fiddletown, Grizzly Flat, Hallelujah Junction, Hat Creek, Log
Cabin, Long Barn, Milpitas, Mi-Wuk Village, Oxnard, Kerckoff Powerhouse, Kono
Tayee, Mad River, Plaster City, Rough and Ready, Skidoo and Slide Inn.;   
Confused? Don't come to us. We're just happy we found the way to San Jose.  </TEXT>
