With the score tied and 2 minutes remaining in overtime, Capistrano Valley High 
School forward Becky Linhart did what no other player could manage Friday night 
at Gahr High School. 
</P>
<P>
She reached another peak in her already peaked performance. 
</P>
<P>
In what may have been the greatest breakaway of the season, Linhart dribbled 
past four defenders and slammed home the final goal that gave Capistrano Valley 
a 4-3 victory over Simi Valley in the Southern Section 4-A girls' soccer title 
match. 
</P>
<P>
"All I knew is that we had 2 minutes left and we had to do it," said Linhart, 
who also scored one goal in regulation. "It was either now or never." 
</P>
<P>
With the match quickly coming to a close, the reality of a co-championship -- 
awarded to teams which tie in a championship match -- drew near. 
</P>
<P>
To some, this might have seemed an appropriate outcome. After all, both teams 
played spectacular soccer, forcing each other to a higher level after each goal 
was scored. And one by one, players on both sides were dropping with injuries 
and drooping with fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"One thing I told the girls (before) overtime is we didn't come here for a 
tie," Cougar Coach Steve Bignal said. "They knew they could leave here 
champions." 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars responded with authority. Although Simi Valley had outshot 
Capistrano Valley, 18-9, during regulation, it was the Cougars who got their 
offense going when it got tough, outshooting Simi Valley, 8-4, in the 20-minute 
overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
Monica Larrson managed the first shot just 25 seconds into the period, 
rebounding less than a minute later with a dangerous breakaway attempt that was 
blocked by Simi Valley defenders. The Cougars closed in repeatedly, with 
Gretchen Fleischli firing a strong attempt from 30 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Although Simi Valley goalkeeper Kim Duran caught Fleischli's shot, the Cougars 
did not let down. Seconds later, Larrson zipped downfield toward what appeared 
to be a clean breakaway goal in the making, but, just 10 yards before the goal, 
Larrson was tackled by a defender and no foul was called. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley began to respond, firing six consecutive shots on goal. But a 
moment later, Linhart made her scoring breakaway and the Cougars had the title. 
</P>
<P>
"We played such a good game," Simi Valley Coach Mark Johnson said. "Oh, it's 
hard to lose after playing so well." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley, which had upset three-time defending Mission Viejo and top-seeded 
Esperanza en route to Friday's championship match, played especially well in 
the first half. The Pioneers (24-3-2) kept the Cougars out of their favored 
precise-passing game. But Simi Valley's most dangerous weapon proved to be the 
throw-ins of senior halfback Stephanie Gainer, which led to goals -- one by 
Gina Skinner and a second by Kim Taketa, who tied the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
Ginger Frank and Cindy Attaway scored the other goals for Capistrano Valley, 
which finished its season 22-4-1.
