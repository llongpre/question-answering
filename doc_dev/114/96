<HEAD>Strong Thunderstorms Develop In Upper Ohio Valley</HEAD>

   Locally heavy rain caused flooding Sunday in West Virginia and
flooding caused by earlier rain threatened a dam in Indiana,
forcing evacuations.
   Thunderstorms developed overnight along and south of a
stationary front and produced heavy rain in the upper Ohio Valley,
and developed over some of the same areas again Sunday afternoon,
including eastern Kentucky, southern Ohio and southwestern West
Virginia.
   Thunderstorms dumped more than 5 inches of rain on parts of
northwestern West Virginia early Sunday, forcing people from their
homes and leaving a couple clinging to a clump of trees after their
pickup was washed away, authorities said.
   ``We got a call when a neighbor saw the truck floating away,''
said Wood County Sheriff's Sgt. Mark King. ``By the time our
deputies got there, the water was over the truck.''
   King said a number of homes along a creek were evacuated, many
county roads were inaccessible because of downed trees, minor mud
slides and high water, and there were power outages.
   Parkersburg received 3.4 inches of rain, while Clarksburg in
nearby Harrison County received 2.6 inches. In northeastern Wood
County, 5.1 inches of rain was measured in 3{ hours early Sunday.
   At Rochester, Ind., a hospital and apartments for elderly people
were evacuated as a precaution Sunday when high water threatened to
break a dam on Lake Manitou, police said.
   Six inches of rain Saturday pushed the lake about 2 feet above
flood stage and leaks appeared in the dam. Officials said between
50 and 75 people were evacuated from the Waterhaven Apartments and
another 28 were moved from the hospital.
   Volunteers, fire crews and civil defense officials laid about
13,000 sand bags along the dam early Sunday, Fulton County chief
jailer Robert Bryant said.
   Showers and a few thunderstorms also extended from eastern South
Dakota to Wisconsin during Sunday afternoon.
   Showers and thunderstorms also were scattered across Florida and
the central Gulf Coast region, along the middle Atlantic Coast and
southern New England, and over the lower Great Lakes.
   Elsewhere, isolated showers and thunderstorms were over central
Arkansas, central Oklahoma and eastern Kansas. Isolated showers
spread along and west of the central Rockies.
   During the night and early Sunday, showers and thunderstorms
produced locally heavy rain in the southern Plains, the North
Central states, the Great Lakes, the upper Ohio Valley and Florida.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hours up ,to 2 a.m. EDT
included 1.9 inches at Grand Rapids, Mich., and 1.7 inches at Key
West, Fla.
   Heavier rainfall for the six hours up to 8 a.m. EDT included 4.9
inches at Altus, Okla.; 2.8 inches at Rockford, Ill.; And 1.9
inches at Akron, Ohio.
   For the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, heavier rainfall included
3.1 inches at Islip, N.Y., and 1.8 inches at Rochester, Minn.
   Blustery north wind ushered cool air into New England during the
afternoon.
   Afternoon readings were only in the 60s across much of the area
from the northern Plains to New England, with temperatures in the
50s in some areas.
   Morning lows dipped into the upper 40s and 50s across parts of
the northern Plains, the upper Mississippi Valley, the Great Lakes
and the northern Atlantic Coast.
   Lows also were in the 40s and 50s in the Rocky mountain region
and the Great Basin covering Nevada and western Utah.
   Sunday's low for the Lower 48 states was 35 at Gunnison, Colo.
