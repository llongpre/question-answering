<P>
The mayor of San Dimas and a Covina councilman face each other and three other 
opponents in a contest for a seat on the 12-member board of the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
The election was forced by the resignation of Baldwin Park Mayor Leo King on 
Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
King represented the 61 cities of the board's eastern region, which stretches 
from Long Beach to Pomona and as far north as Santa Clarita. A delegate from 
each of the cities will be allowed to cast one vote Jan. 4 during the election 
for King's successor at the district's headquarters in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
A complicated voting formula will determine the winner. To be elected, a 
candidate must receive votes from at least two-thirds, or 41, of the eastern 
region's cities, whose combined populations must represent at least two-thirds 
of the residents of the area. 
</P>
<P>
Covina Councilman Henry M. Morgan and San Dimas Mayor Terry Dipple are the two 
San Gabriel Valley candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Morgan, 62, retired two years ago after a 35-year career in marketing and 
management with IBM. He has served on the council since 1978 and has been 
active in regional government affairs. In October, he became a member of the 
Los Angeles County Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a zealot for the environment," Morgan said, "but I certainly agree 
with everybody that the environment's something we've got to nurture. 
</P>
<P>
"Clean air. You've got to do it," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
Dipple, 36, was elected to the San Dimas council more than 13 years ago. He 
runs his own planning, development and real estate investment consulting firm.
