   A battered 3-year-old being used as a
panhandling prop died just after a concerned passerby sent her to a
hospital, the second death in two weeks of a toddler who lived at
the city's largest welfare hotel, police said Friday.
   The girl's mother's boyfriend was charged with murder.
   Maya Figueroa had ``bruises and contusions on her face, back and
neck. Some of these bruises appeared to be recent,'' police Capt.
Michael Gardner said at a news conference.
   Police questioned the girl's mother, Elise Vasquez, 32, who was
in Bellevue Hospital after giving birth Wednesday to her fifth
child.
   The girl was pronounced dead Thursday evening, 20 minutes after
she arrived at New York University Medical Center, said Aaron
Rosenthal, assistant chief of Manhattan detectives.
   An autopsy Friday indicated the toddler died of blunt force
injuries of head and abdomen with internal injuries and bleeding,
said Ellen Borakove of the city medical examiner's office. The case
was officially ruled child abuse and a homicide, she said.
   The girl had been sent to the hospital by a man who saw her on a
street corner with Benito Sanches, 29, who had been panhandling,
police said. Maya was in a stroller and her 18-month-old brother
was in Sanches' arms, Rosenthal said.
   ``Maya appeared to be in serious condition with trauma at least
around the face,'' Rosenthal said.
   He said Sanches had a habit of using the children to panhandle.
   ``He'll take two of the children of his girlfriend, put them in
a stroller and go out and solicit funds in their presence,''
Rosenthal said.
   The passerby, who had not been identified, stopped a cab, gave
the driver $5 and told him to take Sanches and the children to a
hospital. The cab driver told police what had happened.
   Gardner said police were seeking the passerby.
   ``We appeal to him to come forward. We would like to speak to
him about what was going on,'' said Gardner.
   Sanches is a drug abuser with a past record who came to the
United States in May 1980 with the Cuban boat lift, Gardner said.
He was charged with second-degree murder, said police Officer Jim
Coleman.
   Maya lived with her mother, her brother and Sanches at the
Prince George Hotel on Manhattan's East Side, where the city houses
463 homeless families, or about 2,600 people.
   The city provides housing for about 28,000 homeless people,
12,000 of them in welfare hotels and the remainder in shelters,
said spokeswoman Suzanne Trazoff of the Human Resources
Administration.
   Two weeks ago, 3-year-old Quintin McKenzie was scalded to death
in a bathtub at the hotel. His mother, Merian McKenzie, was charged
with second-degree murder and her husband, Calvin C. McKenzie, was
charged with assault for allegedly beating the toddler.
   ``These are terrible stories,'' said Ms. Trazoff.
   ``The Prince George has a large number of social services,'' she
said. A social service office, open during daytime hours, is
located in the hotel and a variety of programs are available,
including preschool and day care programs, she said.
   When asked why no one apparently noticed that the child had been
beaten, Ms. Trazoff speculated that the child's family may not have
requested any social services.
   The spokeswoman said HRA was checking its records to see if the
family had ever asked for help from the agency.
   The 18-month-old boy, whose name was not released, was admitted
to the hospital for observation although he had no visible signs of
abuse.
   Sanches and Ms. Vasquez had lived together for 16 months,
Rosenthal said. Ms. Vasquez's two other children live with
relatives. The baby she had just had at Bellevue was the first the
couple had together.
