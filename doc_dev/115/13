Teresa Soria was taking out the trash Wednesday morning when a little boy 
wearing blue pajamas ran across the street with tears in his eyes begging for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother is laying on the floor," the boy said, trembling. "There is blood 
all over." 
</P>
<P>
Soria sent him to another neighbor who, after peering into the living room of 
the home in the 6700 block of Arbutus Street in Huntington Park, gathered up 
the 8-year-old boy, and his younger brother and sister, and called police. 
Officers arrived to discover the brutal murder of Bertha Gomez, 31, who was 
shot while her children slept. 
</P>
<P>
The crime has brought terror to the tidy neighborhood of Spanish-style homes, 
whose residents had considered themselves somehow immune to a surge in murders 
in the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
In a town that has but four homicide detectives, it has also stretched the 
resources of a 60-member police force already overwhelmed with an alarming 
number of mostly gang- and drug-related violent crimes -- including 27 drive-by 
shootings since January. 
</P>
<P>
The number of serious crimes, including murder, rape and auto theft, has risen 
from 3,406 incidents in 1985 to 4,968 in 1989 -- an increase of 31.5%, police 
spokesman Tom Weselis said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had nine homicides in five months, compared with 12 all last year," he 
said. "Our guys are busier than hell, running nonstop from crime to crime to 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, patrol officers have been working 65-hour weeks in an effort to keep 
up with an increase in calls for assistance in the three-square-mile city of 
70,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
"My phones are ringing all the time from people wanting to organize 
Neighborhood Watch programs, because they don't want to be the next victim," 
Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
Police and city officials blame the problem on the fact that the Police 
Department has not expanded along with the population over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to beef up the force, the city plans to use more than a million 
dollars in cash seized in local drug busts to hire five new officers. "Five is 
not enough, but it will help," Weselis said. 
</P>
<P>
The latest murder followed a double homicide on Feb. 27, in which two robbers 
broke into a Huntington Park condominium and terrorized six members of a family 
for hours before killing a pregnant woman and her 8-month-old fetus. Two 
suspects were arrested in late March after two investigators put in a total of 
260 hours tracking leads and evaluating evidence, including fingerprints lifted 
at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
In the Gomez case, investigators also "have lots of leads" and believe that the 
woman may have been killed by members of an "auto insurance fraud ring" that 
she knew, Detective Steve Hess said. He declined to elaborate on the possible 
motivation for the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
"We have three suspects in mind, none of whom wore gloves when they ransacked 
the house," Hess said. "We also have the bullet in the victim's brain, which we 
can compare with a murder weapon." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Gomez's 8-year-old son "was very strong, very alert and able to 
give us a strong, accurate and consistent account of what happened," the 
detective said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy told investigators that three masked men entered the house about 8 p.m. 
Tuesday. One of them carried a handgun and another had a knife. One of the men, 
in Spanish, ordered the children to go to bed. The boy and the two other 
children, ages 2 and 5, did as they were told, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest child awoke Wednesday morning about 8 a.m. and found his mother's 
body. About 15 minutes later, he told neighbors that "we've been robbed and my 
mother has blood in her mouth." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the evidence in the case, many residents have been unable to sleep 
since word spread along tree-lined Arbutus Street that the shy, introverted 
woman was found bound and gagged on the floor of her bedroom with a gunshot 
wound in her head. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand why it happened here," neighbor Jaime Maya, 23, said 
Thursday. "Everybody around here grew up together. We wave to each other on the 
street. It's been peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought I'd buy a gun," Maya added. "But this has opened my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
A few doors down, Marina Acosta, a 40-year-old mother of two teen-agers, said 
she has been sleeping on the living room couch because she is afraid to stay in 
her bedroom at night. 
</P>
<P>
"When someone knocks on the door I'm afraid to open it," Acosta said, studying 
the occupants of every vehicle that passed the home she has lived in for 17 
years. "I'm thinking about moving to another block." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to live here anymore either, but where can you run?" wondered 
another neighbor, who asked that her named not be used. "We're going to have to 
grin and bear it."
