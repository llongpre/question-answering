   Mexico, the world's sixth largest oil
producer, last month trimmed the average price of its light Isthmus
crude to U.S. clients, the government oil monopoly said Wednesday
night.
   Pemex said in a statement that it charged U.S. customers an
average of $15.78 for a 42-gallon barrel in May, down from the $16
of April.
   The average price of heavy Maya oil rose from $12.77 a barrel in
April to $13.07 in May, the statement said.
   ``The Isthmus- and Maya-quality crudes that Mexico exported
during the month of May to the American continent had a light
variation in their quotations, with respect to April, due to the
linkage of the prices of Mexican oil with the prevailing ones in
the international market,'' Pemex said.
   Prices for Japanese buyers were held steady in May at $15.30 a
barrel for the light oil and $12.60 a barrel for the heavy brand.
   European customers paid less last month. Pemex said those
clients were charged on average $14.99 a barrel for Isthmus crude
during the first 15 days of May and $12.15 for the Maya quality. In
April, the average cost for Europe was $15.43 a barrel for Isthmus
and $12.51 for Maya.
   Pemex said Mexico exported an average of 1.357 million barrels a
day in May, with U.S. buyers taking 51 percent of the total.
   Spain bought 21 percent of the total, and Japan was the third
largest buyer, with a 15 percent share.
   Mexico is not a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries, a 13-member cartel, but it monitors its
decisions closely and often follows its guidelines on pricing and
production.
   OPEC members are scheduled to hold their regular mid-year
meeting in Vienna, Austria, on Saturday. They are expected to focus
their attention on whether to overhaul production quotas.
   Mexico and five other non-cartel nations earlier this year held
talks with OPEC about reducing output in an effort to bolster
sagging world prices.
   Mexico, which has a foreign debt of about $100 billion, relies
on its oil sales to help keep current on its loan payments and buy
needed imports for its developing economy.
   President Miguel de la Madrid has in recent years pushed to
reduce the nation's dependence on crude exports and build up sales
of non-oil goods to foreign buyers.
