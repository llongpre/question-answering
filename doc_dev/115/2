   A panhandler who used a dying 3-year-old girl
and her brother to win sympathy has been charged in her beating
death, and police appealed for further help from the passerby who
tried to save her life.
   Benito Sanches, 36, a ``crack'' cocaine addict who came to
America in the 1980 Cuban boat lift, was charged Friday with
second-degree murder in the death of his girlfriend's daughter,
Maya Figueroa, police said.
   She was the second toddler in two weeks to die a violent death
at the city's biggest welfare hotel, The Prince George Hotel.
   Welfare workers had investigated the family for complaints of
abuse and neglect, but caseworkers had found no evidence of child
abuse, said Suzanne Trazoff, a spokeswoman for the city Human
Resources Administration.
   Detectives were investigating whether the girl's mother, Elise
Vasquez, 32, was involved in the alleged abuse, police Capt.
Michael Gardner said.
   On Thursday, the night Maya died, Ms. Vasquez was in Bellevue
Hospital, where she had given birth to her fifth child, a boy, the
day before.
   In an interview with the Daily News on Friday before signing
herself out of the hospital, Ms. Vasquez was quoted as saying she
did not believe Sanches had hurt Maya and said that ``he loved the
child like it was his own. ...
   ``She would call him `Dada.' She wanted to be with him and to
play with him. He would take her panhandling because she liked to
be with him,'' Ms. Vasquez said. ``She has been going out with him
for two years and he never laid a hand on her or any of the other
kids.''
   At the time of the battered girl's death Thursday, Maya and her
18-month-old brother were being used by Sanches as panhandling
props, police said. They said he had used them before to solicit
money.
   ``He hoped to get sympathy and compassion that way,'' said Aaron
H. Rosenthal, assistant chief of Manhattan detectives.
   Maya was in her stroller when a concerned passerby noticed her
as Sanches begged for coins at 28th Street and Second Avenue at
9:30 p.m. Thursday. The man flagged down a taxi, gave the driver
$5, hustled the three into the cab and ordered the driver to take
them to a hospital, police said.
   Maya was declared dead on arrival at the emergency room at New
York University Medical Center. Her brother, whose name was
withheld, was admitted to the hospital for observation although he
showed no signs of abuse.
   Authorities questioned the cab driver; they hoped to locate the
good Samaritan and find out what he saw that night.
   ``We appeal to him to come forward. We would like to speak to
him about what was going on,'' Gardner said.
   An autopsy Friday indicated the toddler died of blunt force
injuries to her head and abdomen with internal injuries and
bleeding, said Ellen Borakove of the city medical examiner's
office. The case was ruled child abuse and a homicide.
   Maya had ``bruises and contusions on her face, back and neck.
Some of these bruises appeared to be recent,'' Gardner told a news
conference.
   The two children, their mother and Sanches lived at the Prince
George on Manhattan's East Side, which has 2,600 residents, mainly
homeless families. Ms. Vasquez's two other children, ages 12 and
14, live with relatives in Brooklyn, police said.
   Two weeks ago, 3-year-old Quintin McKenzie was scalded to death
in a bathtub at the Prince George. His mother, Merian McKenzie, was
charged with second-degree murder, and her husband, Calvin C.
McKenzie, was charged with assault for allegedly beating the
toddler.
   At the Prince George on Friday, a steady stream of people flowed
in and out of the two steel doors guarding the threadbare lobby.
Many of them pushed strollers or had young children by the hand.
   ``I have to say it: it's drugs,'' said a 21-year-old woman with
a stroller, who identified herself only as Maria. ``If they don't
get money for the drugs, they take it out on the kids.''
   ``It's drugs,'' said Dr. Maria New, who chairs the Pediatrics
Department at New York-Cornell Medical Center. ``McKenzie was
drugs, and now this one, all drugs.''
