   Mexican oil prices rose an average of more
than $2 a barrel in December in the wake of the new OPEC quota
agreement, the government oil monopoly Pemex said.
   The price of light Isthmus crude in the Americas was $13.93 a
barrel in December, an increase from $11.62 in November, Petroleos
Mexicanos said late Thursday.
   The heavy Maya grade sold for $10.52 a barrel, compared with
$9.21 a month earlier, and the extra-light Olmeca for $15.24, up
from $12.90.
   Customers in the Far East paid $12.95 a barrel for Isthmus and
$10.30 a barrel for Maya, increases from $10.82 and $8.22 a barrel
respectively.
   Prices for European buyers during the first half of the month
averaged $14.39 for Isthmus and $11.09 for Maya, up from $12.79 and
$9.71.
   Pemex said the increases were the result of ``the significant
recovery in prices of the principal crudes sold on the international
petroleum market'' following the agreement Nov. 28 by the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   OPEC's 13 members agreed to lower their output by nearly 4
million barrels a day, to 18.5 million barrels in an effort to stem
the flow of excess oil and reverse the decline of world oil prices.
Mexico is not a member of OPEC.
   Since the accord, prices for U.S. crude, as well as Middle East
and other crudes, have risen more than $3 a barrel.
   Mexico's crude oil exports for 1988 averaged 1.3 million barrels
a day and petrochemicals, 40,000 barrels a day, Pemex said.
   In December, 51.6 percent of crude oil exports went to the United
States. Spain was the second largest buyer with 16 percent and 13
percent was sold to the Far East.
