   Mexico announced Friday it is reducing crude
oil exports by 5 percent beginning April 1 in a coordinated move
with other producers in an effort to buttress prices on the world
market.
   Crude exports will be cut by an average of 68,600 barrels a day
from the current average of 1.37 million, the Department of Energy
and Mines said in a statement.
   ``With this, Mexico fully acknowledges that strengthening the oil
market is a joint responsibility by producers and consumers, since
everyone benefits from a stable market and (fair) prices,'' it said.
   The statement did not give a time frame for the reduction but a
source at Pemex, the state petroleum monopoly, said the cut will
probably be maintained at least until the end of the year, depending
on world market conditions.
   The cut was tentatively agreed upon Feb. 21 at a conference by
Mexico _ the world's fourth biggest producer and sixth largest
exporter _ and the five other non-OPEC producers in London. Two
weeks of consultations and negotiations followed on the details.
   At the London conference, Mexico proposed to cut exports by 5
percent provided the other non-OPEC nations did the same. The
agreement came after the 13 members of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries agreed to cut exports during a meeting in
Vienna, Austria.
   Participating in the talks at the Mexican Embassy in London were
Mexico, Oman, Malaysia, Egypt, China and Angola. The Soviet Union,
Colombia, North Yemen, Norway and the state of Alaska and the
Canadian province of Alberta sent observers.
   Although Mexico refuses to join OPEC, it has often used the
international cartel's guidelines to set prices and export limits.
   OPEC members Alberia, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,
Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela together were estimated to be producing in
February about 19.5 million barrels a day.
   This was 1 million above their agreed production limit but well
below their fourth-quarter production last year. OPEC has set a
target price of $18 a barrel for the second quarter of this year.
   Mexico's production averages 2.5 million barrels a day, and about
half of it is exported to the United States. Japan, its principal
customer in the Far East, buys about 180,000 barrels daily. Mexico
also imports 56,000 barrels a day from the United States for its
northern border region to save transportation costs.
   On Wednesday, Mexico reduced prices of its light Isthmus to
Western Europe and the United States, and its extra-light Olmec to
the United States by 10 cents a barrel, but kept the price of its
heavy Maya crude unchanged.
   Olmec, which Mexico began producing in mid-1988, is sold only to
the United States.
   Pemex establishes its prices by region, using a formula based on
average prices on so-called world ``spot'' markets, where oil is
auctioned to the highest bidder. But it sells only to fast customers
under contract of one year or more.
   Thus, the price of Maya to the U.S. averaged $12.38 a barrels
during the first half of January, while Isthmus averaged $15.86 and
Olmec $16.80. In Western Europe, Maya averaged $11.52 and Isthmus
$15.71 a barrel and in the Far East Maya averaged $12.20 and Isthmus
$14.85, according to Pemex figures.
