   Jeronimo Maya can't accept all the offers
he receives to play his guitar in flamenco concerts because there
are times when he has to stay home to do his homework.
   At 10, the guitar prodigy is already a veteran of three years of
flamenco shows, and his audiences have included Spain's King Juan
Carlos and Queen Sofia. Last August he was invited to Jordan by
King Hussein and Queen Noor to play at a royal wedding in Aqaba.
   ``It's always nice to play for kings and queens,'' the youngster
said during in a recent interview. ``They're nice people to meet.''
   Following a recent sold-out performance in Madrid, a music
critic for Spain's leading daily, El Pais, called Jeronimo
exceptionally talented.
   Jeronimo began playing professionally three years ago when his
guitar was nearly as big as he was. He has been studying since he
was 5 with his father, the noted flamenco guitarist Felipe Maya. He
also studies classical guitar at a Madrid conservatory.
   Maya says his son's talent and success are rooted in hard work,
not in any type of gift from God.
   Flamenco, which encompasses singing, guitar-playing, dancing and
hand-clapping, traces its roots to 16th century southern Spain
where it emerged as the artistic response of Gypsies to widespread
repression, and was influenced by elements of Jewish and Moorish
music.
   Sometimes, his father lets Jeronimo stay up to play in a 3 a.m.
``juerga'' _ a sort of flamenco jam session _ at Candela, Madrid's
hangout for flamenco artists and aficionados where he wows the
late-night crowd with the depth and sensitivity of his playing.
   Professional flamenco guitarists call him a young maestro who
plays at a level far advanced for his age.
   World-famous guitarist Sabicas says he has never heard a
youngster play so well.
   Jeronimo has already appeared twice in the annual ``Flamenco
Summit'' in Madrid, on a youth program in 1985 and as a featured
soloist last year, a spot usually reserved for such talents as Paco
de Lucia.
   Felipe Maya says Jeronimo, his other son and two daughters often
get together with him at home and hold their own ``juergas.''
   ``As Gypsies, we externalize our feelings and emotions,'' the
father said. ``We could be sitting around, and then we start
singing and dancing just because we feel like it.''
   Maya says his son has been fortunate not to encounter the
discrimination many Gypsy children suffer in Spanish schools.
   ``He's very down to earth, and in the school, people look up to
him,'' he said.
   Jeronimo, who wants to travel to China and the United States _
``to see the big New York skyscrapers'' _ also likes Brazilian and
jazz guitar and says his favorite classical composers include
Mozart, Beethoven and Debussy, the latter particularly because many
of his compositions were based on flamenco patterns.
