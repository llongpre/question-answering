   Mexico's state oil monopoly Pemex has begun
marketing a new high-grade crude in the international petroleum
market, the government newspaper El Nacional reported.
   Abundio Juarez Mendez, deputy director of primary production for
Pemex, said the company last month exported 250,000 42-gallon
barrels of the new crude, called Olmeca. He did not identify the
purchaser.
   He said the new crude can be priced a dollar more a barrel than
the Isthmus brand, which previously was the nation's superior oil.
Mexico also exports a heavy crude, called Maya.
   ``(Olmeca) is much finer than Isthmus (and) it is superior to
Arab light,'' Juarez Mendez told local reporters at an oil
conference on Latin American drilling, according to the article,
which was published Thursday.
   Mexico, he said, has the capacity to eventually export 125,000
barrels to 150,000 barrels a day of the new crude, which is being
extracted from fields in the southeastern state of Tabasco along
the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
   Juarez Mendez said the new oil has a density of between 38 and
40 on the American Petroleum Institute scale, compared to a density
of 32 to 34 for Isthmus.
   The English-language daily Mexico City News quoted an
unidentified Pemex official as saying the government ``is not yet
sure how much light oil it has. Pemex is still exploring.''
   ``There is probably not much Olmeca in Mexico,'' he was quoted
as saying.
   Pemex, meanwhile, reported that prices to Japanese clients for
Isthmus and Maya crudes were held steady in May
   The price for Isthmus was $15.30 a barrel in May to Japan, the
same as in April, and for Maya, $12.60 a barrel.
   ``This reflects the stability that prevails in the general level
of prices in the international oil market,'' Pemex said in a
statement.
   Mexico has a contract with Japanese customers to supply 180,000
barrels of oil a day, the statement said.
   Mexico's prices vary according to geographical area. The oil
company did not give the May prices for U.S. and European customers.
   In April, the price of the Isthmus brand to U.S. customers was
$16 a barrel and $12.77 for the heavy type.
   Mexico maintains an export platform of 1.36 million barrels a
day.
