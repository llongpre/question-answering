In a letter to the San Diego Zoo, investigators at the Humane Society of the 
United States contended Wednesday that the zoo's elephant exhibit is inadequate 
and "extremely dangerous" for both the huge mammals and their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
The open letter to Doug Meyers, director of the San Diego Zoological Society, 
was prompted by the death Sunday of Maya, a 51-year-old Asian elephant. Zoo 
officials ordered that Maya be killed after being crippled by a fall into an 
elephant yard moat. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not question the care Maya received after her tragic fall, nor the fact 
that euthanasia was the humane decision to make on her behalf," wrote David K. 
Wills, a vice president in the Humane Society's Department of Investigations. 
"However, we are concerned as to what steps zoo officials are going to take to 
improve conditions for the surviving elephants." 
</P>
<P>
Wills contended that there are uninsulated floors and insufficient heat inside 
the barn-like structure and that the exhibit provides limited outdoor shelter. 
He also questioned the daily reliance on chains to restrain the elephants and 
called for widening of the catwalk connecting two parts of the elephant yard. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jouett, a spokesman for the zoo, acknowledged that the nearly 30-year-old 
elephant yard is "not perfect," but he said the zoo is improving it. Shade 
trees have been planted and decaying floorboards replaced, he said. The zoo 
also plans to widen the catwalk. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett rejected Wills' charge that Maya might be alive if the catwalk were 
wider, saying no one witnessed her fall or her position on the walkway. He also 
denied that the exhibit, which houses one African and three Asian elephants, is 
"grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
"It has passed USDA inspections and we'll welcome the USDA to come look at it 
again," Jouett said, noting that Wills has asked the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture to investigate the exhibit. He called most of Wills' allegations 
"exaggerations to catch the public's attention. It makes nice quotes but it's 
just not true." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Homer Malaby, a USDA animal-care specialist in Sacramento, said he will 
visit the zoo next week to investigate the Humane Society's allegations.
