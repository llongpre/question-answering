<LEADPARA>  'SEA, sun, sand and sex" vs. ecotourism: When surveyed, 77 percent of a group
from Liverpool, England, vacationing in Cancun, Mexico, didn't know what
country they were in, said Bill Garrett, former editor of National Geographic,
speaking at the World Congress on Adventure Travel and Eco-tourism recently in
Colorado Springs.;   What most of the 1.5 million annual visitors to Cancun
also don't know, Garrett said, is that just a few miles away are more ancient
ruins than can be found in Egypt -- built by a culture that lasted six times
longer than the Roman Empire and was in full flower when Europe was in the
Dark Ages.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Garrett is now president of the Virginia-based La Ruta Maya Conservation
Foundation, aimed at fostering "rational and sustainable" tourism development
in the ecologically and archaeologically rich areas of Mexico and Central
America.;   The economic, population and political pressures there are
destroying the culture and natural resources. Just to survive, the people must
cut down the forests, Garrett says. In Guatemala, for instance, the average
agricultural worker earns $2 a day, while a gallon of milk costs $1.60 and a
gallon of gas costs $2. "One of the hottest-selling items in that area is the
chain saw. The main industries are killing animals to sell their pelts,
growing crops of marijuana, logging and illegal pet trade in jungle birds and
animals.;   "We have to make the environmental and cultural aspects too
valuable to be destroyed -- too valuable to the local people for them to
destroy them." Ecotourists, he says, have been found to spend twice as much
money as the "sea, sun, sand and sex" crowd -- "and may even have twice as
much fun." La Ruta Maya tries to help villages set up their own tourism
businesses -- to act as guides or make reproductions. Another idea is having
"adventure" travelers stay with Maya families. The foundation is also helping
create an international peace park on the borders of Mexico, Guatemala and
Belize.;   Ecotours; Here were a few eye-catching trips at the recent
International Adventure Travel Expo, in Colorado Springs:;   (check) Amazon
River Adventure: The Meeting of the Waters Tour. See pink dolphins, take walks
through the rain forest and sleep in hammocks on a Brazilian version of the
African Queen as it chugs down the mighty Amazon -- 60 miles wide in some
sections -- to meet the Rio Negro near Manaus, Brazil. The tour company hires
local people as guides, cooks and boat captains, and charters locally owned
river boats. The "black water" of the Rio Negro is so-called because of
suspended organic matter in the water, which makes it too acidic for
mosquitoes to breed in. Price $1,215 all-inclusive from Miami. Contact

Q. Roo 77500, Mexico; (988) 4-95-83.;   Guidelines; What is the essence of
being an environmentally sensitive traveler? The International Wilderness
Leadership Foundation lists the following:;   (box) Protect wildlife and wild
lands -- Respect the animals' space and privacy and watch from a distance
comfortable for both them and you. Move lightly to prevent damage to delicate
vegetation. Consider not only your impact, but also the total impact of all
those who have had or will share the same experience.;   (box) Respect the
host culture -- Local customs, beliefs, social systems, art work and artifacts
are as important to your nature adventure as are the wildlife and wild lands.;
  (box) Support local people -- Use local services and purchase locally made
goods for a fair price. The best nature tour companies employ as many
indigenous people as possible and provide advancement opportunities for them.
Steady livelihood, adequate education and appropriate training for local
people are key elements in sustaining wildlife and wild lands.;   (box)
Enhance your personal understanding -- The essence of wilderness is a unique
combination of the inner person with the outer world, of the human soul with
the spirit of the land. Allow it to happen and allow yourself to change.;  
(box) Involve yourself in conservation -- Translate the adventure and
excitement into a personal commitment to nature conservation. Find out what
you can do to help protect its wildlife, wild lands and local cultures -- and
then act.; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; For a complete copy of Guidelines for
Ecotourists, contact the International Wilderness Leadership Foundation, 211
