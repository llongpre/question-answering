   Midnight street theater, Cuban jazz,
flamenco dance, roving street clowns and mimes: It's all part of the
International Cervantes Festival, a two-week celebration staged each
fall in this charming colonial city.
   The 16th annual edition of Mexico's cultural event features about
150 dance, theater and music repertory groups from 57 countries and
Mexico.
   It also draws countless ``unofficial'' folk bands, clowns and
mimes to the twisting cobblestoned streets and hidden alleys of
Guanajuato, a 16th century silver mining town about 225 miles
northwest of Mexico City.
   ``The festival is an expression of friendship between peoples,''
says Lourdes Gomez, a spokeswoman for the Cervantino, as the event
is known in Spanish. ``People forget about their troubles, and
culture overcomes crisis.''
   Each year, thousands of visitors from Mexico and abroad enjoy
near-continuous performances staged in streets, theaters, parks and
open-air stages throughout the city.
   The sounds of Andean flute music give way to brass, reggae and
rock 'n' roll. Strollers always seem to be gathered on some street
or plaza enjoying an impromptu mime act or a play sandwiched between
the festival's headline events.
   Among them was the stirring performance last week by Mario Maya's
flamenco dance company, the Andalusian Gypsy Theater. The sharp,
clipped vibrations of the troupe's exaggerated handclapping and
foot-stepping were felt throughout the four-tiered Juarez Theater.
   The choreographer, born into a Gypsy family that lived in a cave
in Granada, Spain, says he began experimenting with forms of
flamenco dance theater in the 1960s as a way to fight the
marginalization of Gypsy culture under the Franco regime.
   ``For me, it was a necessity. Flamenco was a way of expression,
of spreading the culture through theater,'' Maya says, describing
his efforts as the ``folklorization'' of flamenco.
   The troupe's sharp dance score, complemented by an encore of
individual performances, elicited bravos and a standing ovation in
the theater.
   The smell of roasted corn husks filled the air as Jose Maria
Vitier's nine-piece jazz band from Cuba torched the open-air stage
at Guanajuato's downtown granary, the site of bloody fighting during
Mexico's fight for independence from Spain.
   With Vitier hammering on a Steinway and electric pianos, and
Lazaro Gonzalez on violin, the ensemble sped through 12 numbers that
included a percussion-driven rendition of Keith Jarrett's ``My
Song.''
   Those who weren't at the granary were on the street in front of
the Juarez Theater, surrounding Indian saxophonist Kandri Gopalnath
as he knelt on a 7-foot square Persian rug and wailed on the
instrument.
   Fusing the Western sax with Eastern musical strands, Gopalnath's
free-form instrumental at times differed little from the sounds of
sitar and provoked wondrous stares from some in the crowd, and
evident delight among others.
   Guatemala's Fine Arts Marimba ensemble offered a melodious
sampling of ancient Meso-American songs inside the colonial Temple
of San Diego church. The group displayed the remarkable flexibility
of the marimba in wrapping up its performance with mambo, merengue
and even polka numbers.
   With Guanajuato's streets under cover of darkness, a woman in
peasant dress emerged from an alleyway into the central Plaza Jardin
pounding on a drum and heralding the beginning of a phantom-like
spectacle by Italy's Tascabile de Bergamo theater troupe.
   The silent drama, ``Albatross,'' was performed by four actors on
stilts, draped in white and scarlet and carrying torches. Its story
of lovers who are threatened by the seductress albatross coursed
through Guanajuato's narrow streets at midnight as the crowd of
spectators eagerly followed.
   The play reached its dramatic conclusion in the Plaza Jardin when
other ``evil'' albatrosses appeared screaming on rooftops above,
their white robes in stark contrast against the night sky.
   These were but a sampling of the Cervantes Festival's offerings
to a delighted public. The Jamaican reggae band Chalice, Britain's
eclectic Bow Gamelan Ensemble, the Soviet Union's Vilnius Opera
Ballet Theater, Anna Sokolow's dance company and Igor's Cowboy Jazz
Band from the United States also staged appearances.
   The University of Guanajuato, a prominent fine arts institution,
supplied numerous student theater and musical performances
throughout the festival. But they and dozens of repertory groups
from Latin America and the world will be back next year.
   ``We're already working on it,'' says Gomez.
