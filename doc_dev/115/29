  [Text] The recently dedicated Maya Aqueduct will benefit 
more than 14,000 people, representing more than half the 
population of Maisi Muncipality, the easternmost point in Cuba 
and the main coffee producer in the country. Further details on 
this by reporter Leonel Perez Moya: 
  [Begin Perez recording] Using its own resources, at a cost 
of 
690,000 pesos, the revamped plant operates by gravity and 
replaces the old, inefficient installation that has been 
corroded by inclement weather. The approximate five km of 
conduits and pipes of various diameters, leading to the main 
duct, replaces the pumping system, with an annual savings of 590 
megawatts of electricity. 
  This inexpensive technology provides for a continuous supply 
of potable water to residents of Punta de Maisi on the 
easternmost point of the nation; to La Maquina, the center of 
Maisi Municipality; and to eight other populated settlements. 
Water is also carried to the largest coffee plant in the zone 
and to the family doctors' offices, to schools, minifarms, 
agricultural areas, and other socioeconomic institutions. [end
