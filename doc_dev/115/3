<LEADPARA>  WEARY of burning your retinas on the same old Mexican beach vacation? How
about a visit to "El Mundo Maya" instead?;    If it's a phrase you haven't
heard yet, be prepared: El Mundo Maya -- the world of the Maya -- is one of
the waves of the future in vacation travel to Mexico and Central America. You
may also hear it referred to as "La Ruta Maya," the route of the Maya, but the
idea is similar -- travel to the developed and undeveloped Mayan sites in
Mexico, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And there are hundreds of them, stretching from heavily visited places,
such as Tulum in Mexico's Yucatan, to Tikal in Guatemala, Copan in Honduras
and lesser-known sites in war-torn El Salvador.;    Whether Mundo Maya or Ruta
Maya, the words will most likely also be linked to what has already become one
of the big trends in travel for the 1990s: ecotourism. Ecotourism basically
means environmentally sensitive and socially conscious travel to wilderness
areas, especially those in underdeveloped parts of the world.;    The
underlying idea is that such travel, if it is well-managed, can prevent damage
to pristine areas, while generating enough income to keep the natives from
ravaging the same environment -- rain forests, for example -- to eke out a
living.;    In the last two years, a series of meetings among commercial and
governmental tourism officials in the five nations has found general accord
with linking tourists on a Mayan route through Mexico and parts of Central
America. It even seems likely that a Mundo Maya "passport" will be created at
some point, to ease travel among the nations.;    But the concern of many
environmentalists is that El Mundo Maya will simply become another way for
Mexico to generate tourist dollars.;    The commercial operators are "more
concerned with tourism, and we're more concerned with preservation," says Bill
Garrett, founder and president of La Ruta Maya Conservation Foundation and a
former editor of National Geographic. Garrett wrote an article for the October
1989 Geographic that outlined ambitious plans to preserve and protect the
Mayan sites and their surrounding rain forests and preserves.;    Garrett
recalls watching in horror as guides ran boats close to a huge flock of
flamingos near Celestun in the Gulf of Mexico, and made loud noises to spook
the birds into flight so tourists on the boats could get better pictures.
That's ecoterrorism, not ecotourism, he says.;    "At some point, they're
going to have to enforce the rules," Garrett says. "Most tourists aren't going
to get mad and go home if you say, 'Don't break the rules.' ";     IF YOU'RE

available at many bookstores for $14.95.  </TEXT>
