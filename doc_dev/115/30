    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Guatemalan guerrilla activities monitored through 1 
June. 
  A bomb exploded yesterday at 1800 near Channel 7's 
installations, hurling pamphlets of the Rebel Armed Forces with 
slogans against the Army and calling for the creation of the 
Truth Commission, an issue that is yet to be discussed at the 
negotiations table. The explosion caused no property damage but 
frightened people who were nearby. (Guatemala City SIGLO 
VEINTIUNO in Spanish 28 May 94 p 12) 
  National Police agents captured two guerrilla suspects; one 
near Maya neighborhood in Zone 18 and the other near the Guarda 
market in Zone 11. In the first case, the National Police's 
Public Relations office noted, the suspect was captured when 
several policemen were attacked by three individuals riding a 
blue Mitsubishi vehicle near the bus station in Maya 
neighborhood. The second suspect attracted the attention of the 
police because of his suspicious attitude. He was carrying a 
briefcase that contained three grenades. (Guatemala City 
SIGLOVEINTIUNO in Spanish 31 May 94 p 8)
