   Mexico plans to cut oil exports about 5
percent and raise some crude prices by 10 cents a barrel starting
March 1 in an effort to help strengthen world oil prices, government
sources said Wednesday.
   The disclosures followed Tuesday's meeting in London of non-OPEC
producing countries, including Mexico, who have pledged to support
OPEC's effort to reduce production and raise prices.
   A source at the state oil monopoly, Pemex, who insisted on
anonymity, said the government would announce the cuts within the
next few days.
   Emilio Matar, a spokesman for Pemex, confirmed that the new
prices would take effect March 1.
   The increases would be for the posted price of Mexican light
Isthmus sold to the United States and Western Europe and extra-light
Olmec sold to the United States.
   Energy and Mines Secretary Fernando Hiriart told reporters on
Monday that Mexico was willing to reduce its exports by 5 to 6
percent for the rest of this year, provided other oil exporting
countries reduce their sales.
   The Pemex source said that if other countries honor the London
agreement Mexico would reduce its average daily exports by as much
as 65,000 barrels a day. The amount would probably vary from month
to month, but could average about 5 percent lower than January
exports, the source said.
   The source did not say which countries' exports would be targeted
for cutbacks.
   Details of the London agreement have not been released. A
statement issued after Tuesday's meeting said that some countries
would reduce exports while others would freeze sales temporarily and
that details were forthcoming.
   Production by Mexico, the world's sixth largest crude oil
producer, averages 2.5 million barrels a day. In January, it
exported a total of 1.3 million barrels a day _ approximately half
to the United States. Japan, its principal customer in the Far East,
buys an average of 180,000 barrels daily.
   Mexico also imports 58,000 barrels daily from the United States
for some of its northern border region to save transportation costs.
   Last November, the 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed to lower its exports to 18.5 million barrels a day
in the first half of 1989 to buoy world market prices and called on
independent producers to make similar cuts. Mexico is not a member
of OPEC, but often uses that international cartel's pricing
guidelines.
   OPEC, whose production late last year was estimated at 22.5
million barrels a day, agreed to the new quota after oil prices
sagged to about $10 a barrel, well below the cartel's benchmark of
$18.
   Mexico sets different prices for its crude for the United States,
Europe and the Far East, under long-term contracts with individual
customers.
   The price of heavy Maya to the United States averaged $12.38 a
barrel during the first half of January, while Isthmus averaged
$15.86 and Olmec $16.80 barrel. In Western Europe, Maya averaged
$11.52 and Isthmus $15.71 a barrel. In the Far East, Maya averaged
$12.20 and Isthmus $14.85 a barrel, according to the latest Pemex
figures.
   Pemex sells Olmec, which it started producing in mid-1988 in
small quantities, only to the United States.
