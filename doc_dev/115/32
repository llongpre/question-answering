<LEADPARA>  IT'S not your usual night at the opera.;   The singers on stage are dressed in
the feathered finery and crimson robes of pre-Columbian priests. The dancers
are moving to the percussive sounds made by rattles strapped to their feet. A
minimalist computer accompaniment and the pungent aroma of incense waft over
the small invited audience.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The scene is from a workshop presentation of an excerpt from "Popol Vuh," a
commissioned opera-in-progress, which could become the most ambitious project
attempted by Opera San Jose.;   With a score by prize-winning electronic
composer Allen Strange, a libretto by Robert Jenkins and choreography by David
A. Vargas, the 16-minute excerpt staged recently at San Jose State was as
visually stunning and exotic as anything in "Aida" or "L'Africaine.";   This
operatic pie-slice is decidedly unorthodox, using computer-generated music
throughout and no acoustic instruments.;   Composer Strange, a nationally
recognized San Jose State faculty member, had never written an opera before.
He ran across a translation of "Popol Vuh" in a bookstore -- misplaced in the
cooking section. He and librettist Jenkins approached Opera San Jose about
writing an opera based on the work.;   "I always thought of opera as
19th-century TV," he commented after accepting a commission to start on the
project.;   A number of listeners at the Aug. 22 presentation were so
impressed that they stayed to see a second run-through later the same evening
-- this, despite the use of the Central American texts, three languages, the
electronic score and some moments that seemed more like anthropology than
opera.;   Indeed, some accurately inflected Quiche-Mayan spoken texts had been
provided on audio tape by Stanford anthropology professor James Fox. They were
sprinkled in with the singing in English and Spanish.;   Opera San Jose has
taken a cautious approach to the project in this recession year. The company
gave the green light for the 16-minute workshop scene with makeup and
costumes. A grant of over $9,000 from the San Jose Fine Arts Commission was
seed money for the mini-production, whose costs were estimated at $14,000 in
cash and $30,000 in in-kind services.;   Opera San Jose videotaped the
workshop in order to interest potential contributors. The company has set an
August 1992 deadline for raising the "$80,000 to $100,000" needed for
completion of the libretto and score, according to executive director Craig
Palmer. Says Palmer, "This piece is at least three to four years away" from
the main stage.;   The basis of the libretto is the opening portion of "Popol
Vuh," the sacred book of the ancient Quiche Mayas, whose descendants still
survive in the highlands of Guatemala.;   The earliest written versions of
"Popol Vuh" were set down on scrolls in the mid-16th century by native priests
who feared that otherwise their indigenous tradition would be wiped out by the
Spanish conquistadors.;   The opera adaptation of "Popol Vuh" represents an
unusual attempt at an honest and historically informed portrayal of a tale
drawn from an indigenous American culture.;   Older operas were not nearly as
true to their historic sources. The two "Montezuma" operas by Karl Heinrich
Graun (1755) and Roger Sessions (1962) are rooted firmly in the European
operatic tradition. And two better-known works -- Purcell's "The Indian Queen"
(1694) and Offenbach's "La Perichole" (1868) -- are merely excuses for
European singers with thoroughly European scores to don exotic finery and play
out painfully implausible tales. Unlike "Popol Vuh," none of these is written
from the perspective of New World peoples.;   But despite the admirable
intentions, producer Daniel Helfgot had to overcome resistance when he sought
out dancers who could perform in the Aztec and Mayan traditions from the local
group Tezkatlipoka. "The dancers were suspicious," said Helfgot, an urbane
emigre from Buenos Aires and the only Latin American involved on the creative
team. "They wondered, 'What do these Caucasians want to do?' Now they have
joined us. But we are sensitive to them.";   Asked about the possibility of
offending the surviving descendants of the Quiche Mayas, librettist Jenkins
said, "I've worried a lot over it. . . . (Therefore) we're staying as close as
possible to the sacred text.";   Apart from this problem, there's also a
question of how well the stories will translate to the operatic stage. To this
critic, the excerpt at San Jose State offered more color than drama. The
decision to stick closely to the Mayan codex appears to be pushing the work
toward ceremony and away from plot development and a strong set of central
characters. Most of the scene played like something akin to Pharaonic rites or
a religious service.;   Baroque composers faced a similar quandary in dealing
with sacred texts. The prolific opera composer Handel put his Biblical works
into oratorio (concert) form rather than opera. Bach created his Passions for
use in the church rather than on the stage; modern-day operatic stagings of
his great "St. Matthew's Passion" have not met with favor, despite repeated
attempts.;   Still, it's clear that Opera San Jose has made great strides,
demonstrating its excellent production skills even in the bare-bones San Jose
State Studio Theater. The ensemble had done its homework, and the presentation
had integrity.;   As for theatricality, the overrunning of the Mayan religious
rites by the conquistadors in one portion provided a vivid if melodramatic
touch.;   While the fund-raising effort goes on, the Opera San Jose creative
team, from artistic director Irene Dalis to conductor Barbara Day Turner to
choreographer David A. Vargas, are hoping enough backers will be found to make
the opera happen.;   Composer Strange, meanwhile, has musical sketches galore,
with five discs of computer-synthesized flute music alone.;   "With
computer-generated music, every minute (performed) takes about 18 hours of
work" by the composer, Strange says. "And that isn't much different than
traditional composing (for voice and orchestra).";   If this project catches
on, and the entire five-volume set of sacred writings of the Quiche Mayas were
to be turned into opera, Strange's score would make Richard Wagner's epic
"Ring" cycle look like a minuet. If dramatized at the current rate, the entire
set would entail well in excess of 60 hours of music.;   Now that would be an
opera to remember. (box)  </TEXT>
