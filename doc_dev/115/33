   A huge oil slick caused by the collision of two
freighters has floated near the mouth of a leading northeastern
port, officials said today.
   The 40-square-mile slick is near the Dalian port and is
continuing to move east in the direction of North Korea, Zhu Li of
the Dalian Marine Safety Supervision Bureau said in a telephone
interview.
   The State Oceanography Bureau in Beijing said it was China's
largest oil spill ever from an ocean vessel, but it could not
assess the seriousness of the environmental damage.
   The spill has received little attention in the official media
and there has been no outcry over responsibility.
   The spill was caused by the June 8 collision of two
Japanese-owned freighters in the Bohai Gulf, east of Tianjin. One
vessel, the Maya 8, sank and began leaking its fuel oil. It was not
carrying any cargo.
   The second ship, the Spring Falcon, loaded with magnesium ore,
rescued the Maya 8's crew and continued its journey to Japan.
   Both the Oceanography Bureau and the Marine Safety Supervision
Bureau said they did not know how much oil the Maya 8 was carrying.
The People's Daily, which reported the slick's spread to near
Dalian, said that as of Thursday oil continued to leak from the
vessel but the flow had slowed.
   The slick near Dalian appeared to be only one portion of the oil
leak. Initial reports after the collision said oil was covering
more than 480 square miles.
   Ms. Zhu said she did not know whether the spill would affect
shipping and fishing in the gulf.
   She said that by cutting off the oxygen supply to the water, the
oil spill had produced a red tide _ a proliferation of red
organisms that can harm fish and plant life.
   Efforts are being made to clean up the oil, she said, but she
could give no details. She did not know the cost of the cleanup.
