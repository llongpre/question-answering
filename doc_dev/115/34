   From the Great Seal of the United States to
the folklore of Native Americans, birds of prey have been powerful
symbols of freedom, dignity and strength.
   But eagles, hawks and other raptors also send another message.
Because of their position near the top of the food chain, they serve
as environmental monitors, warning of impending danger like canaries
in a coal mine.
   ``If we see things happening to these birds ... that signals us
that there are more severe problems lower down in the food chain,''
said Tom Cade, who founded the Peregrine Fund in 1970 while a
professor at Cornell University.
   Peregrine Fund researchers and volunteers, who helped bring the
species back from near extinction, now are applying what they
learned to the study and preservation of raptors _ predatory birds
distinguished by talons, hooked beaks and keen eyesight _ from the
jungles of Guatemala to the plains of Africa.
   At the World Center for Birds of Prey in the southwestern Idaho
desert, researchers breed tropical raptors in captivity for release
in the wild. Others are in the field, collecting data on the birds
in their native habitat.
   Their work has led them into the battle to preserve tropical rain
forests that are home to half the world's plant and animal species
and are disappearing at the rate of 50 acres a minutes, said Bill
Burnham, the center's director.
   ``Many of the nations are beginning to see their environments as
their futures,'' Burnham said. ``If you eliminate your natural
resources, if you cut down all your forests, your children and your
grandchildren won't have much to look forward to.''
   The impact of the rain forests reaches far beyond the boundaries
of the nations they cover; many songbirds, waterfowl and raptors
considered indigenous to North America actually spend much of their
time in the tropics.
   ``Wildlife do not recognize political boundaries,'' Burnham said.
``You can't be provincial and manage a highly migratory species.''
   Little is known about many of the tropical raptors, and ``there
is no way to know how to preserve them if you know nothing about
them,'' he said.
   In its ``Maya Project'' in Guatemala and Belize, the Peregrine
Fund is studying raptors in both pristine and altered forests to see
how the birds adapt to changes in their environment. It also is
trying to determine where the birds live in the forests and how much
territory they need to survive and breed _ information that later
can be used in establishing wildlife preserves.
   For example, the harpy eagle, thought to be the most powerful
eagle in the world, may require 5,000 acres or more for each pair,
Cade said.
   Studying the birds first required finding them in the dense,
mosquito-infested jungles. From perches atop trees and ancient Mayan
temples, researchers were able to observe some birds flying above
the forest canopy. Other species were lured with taped calls. The
team has detected 26 raptor species in the two Central American
nations.
   Working with peregrines not only gave the group a scientific
background that can be applied to other raptors, but it also helped
them develop skills needed to work with other people, Burnham said.
``Cooperation is the key word. We are not a confrontational
organization. We are a conservation organization that works together
with other groups.''
   Among those cooperating on the Maya Project are Guatemala's
Institute of Anthropology and History and the Belize Department of
Agriculture.
   Though prospects of saving tropical raptors seem daunting, the
Peregrine Fund can take heart from past success when the odds were
against them.
   Because of the effects of the pesticide DDT, peregrine falcons,
once common in much of the United States, had been had reduced to 35
pairs by 1975, and none remained east of the Mississippi. Largely
through the efforts of the fund, there now are more than 600 falcons
in 25 states. The group's goal is to have the birds removed from the
endangered species list by the turn of the century.
   ``It's gone a long way further than I ever envisioned it back
when we started,'' Cade said.
