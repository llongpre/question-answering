Ray Fowler scanned his morning newspaper to see whether any of his friends or 
neighbors had made the list of Los Angeles County taxpayers who were late 
paying their property taxes. The last thing he expected to find was his own 
name. 
</P>
<P>
"It is just not a happy experience to go whipping down the delinquency column 
and find yourself listed there," he said -- especially since he had paid his 
taxes. He said the list, prepared by the county tax collector, left his friends 
and neighbors with the erroneous impression that "Ray Fowler is a deadbeat" and 
brought him "strange looks" at his bank. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like having a pie thrown in your face," said Lillian Romero-Gomez, who 
was shocked to find her name on the list, even after she had sent copies of her 
paid tax bill to the tax collector's office. 
</P>
<P>
They and a few other taxpayers complained to their county supervisor. The 
result was a change in county policy. From now on, taxpayers erroneously 
identified as delinquent can get a public apology from the tax collector in the 
form of a published retraction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Mindful of Image 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County tax collector's office, mindful of its image, recently 
led a successful lobbying effort in Sacramento that led to a change in state 
law allowing counties to delay publication of the lists for up to a year in 
order to ensure their accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
The county is required by state law to publish the lists of delinquent 
taxpayers. But it does not make the same effort to notify those who are due 
refunds. 
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 taxpayers a year are believed to overpay their taxes but never 
receive refunds because the county cannot find them. Unclaimed money is 
deposited into the county treasury after a four-year waiting period. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the coffers were boosted by $479,626 in overpaid property taxes, 
including $7,387 due a single unwitting taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
County officials said it would be unfair for the general taxpayer to bear the 
expense of tracking down taxpayers who, in the words of one official, are "poor 
record keepers." They said it is the taxpayers' responsibility to keep track of 
how much they pay. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Published Each September 
</P>
<P>
As for the county's delinquency lists, nobody knows how many taxpayers' names 
end up there mistakenly. The lists are published every September in community 
newspapers, and nearly 100,000 names appeared last year. 
</P>
<P>
Tax officials say mistakes are inevitable because of the sheer volume of 
property tax bills -- a staggering 2.5 million -- and the complexity of the tax 
system. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Sanchez, manager of the tax collector's secured property division, said 
she "would be surprised if I have 50 people" a year complain that their names 
were published in error. Until now, the tax collector has sent letters of 
apology to taxpayers "and to whomever they tell us they want us to write," 
including gossipy neighbors, Assistant Tax Collector David Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
That was not enough for Supervisor Pete Schabarum. He recently won his 
colleagues' approval to require the tax collector to publish an apology when 
requested by a taxpayer. Tax Collector Sandra Davis said her office will 
determine whether an error has been made. Wording of the apology has not been 
worked out. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum proposed the new policy after complaints from several constituents, 
including Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
Fowler, owner of apartment buildings in Claremont, said he saw his name on the 
list published in his community paper, the Claremont Courier. 
</P>
<P>
He said he paid his taxes in December, 1987, but because of a processing error, 
received a delinquency notice in the mail the following June, the month the tax 
collector sends notices to delinquent taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
Forgetting that he had paid, he sent another check. Perusing his financial 
records the next day, he found proof of his earlier payment and stopped payment 
on the second check. 
</P>
<P>
"How many other citizens have paid twice under such circumstances?" he wrote 
Schabarum. "If the county records show I'm delinquent, and I don't have an 
infallible system and am busy, as well as basically compliant, I'm inclined to 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
Tax Collector Davis, in a letter of response to Schabarum, said Fowler was at 
least partly responsible for the mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Fowler did not review his records before taking action and sent a check to 
cover the delinquencies. Had he determined that payment was made and so advised 
this office, research would have uncovered the processing error and it could 
have been corrected so that no default or published notice would have 
occurred." 
</P>
<P>
But Fowler and two other taxpayers interviewed said they tried for months to 
clear up the matter with the tax collector before contacting Schabarum, whose 
office resolved the problems within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the tax collector's office, Fowler said, "Most of them treated me 
as if they were not in the tax collector's office, but in the felony division 
of the Sheriff's Department, and I was the culprit." 
</P>
<P>
Mindful of its image, the tax collector's office recently began training its 
operators in "telephone etiquette." In addition, the Board of Supervisors has 
allocated $4 million to add phone lines and increase staff in the tax 
collector's office. 
</P>
<P>
"Taxpayers do not want taxes raised, but they want immediate service," said 
Sanchez, pointing out that the tax collector's office processes more than 4 
million tax payments a year and is still not fully computerized. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Greenbaum-Maya, another Claremont taxpayer who wrote Schabarum, said she 
was "outraged" to find her name on the delinquency list. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not how I wanted to appear in the paper, as delinquent in my taxes," 
she said. "I am a psychologist, and I work in the area where I live, and that's 
embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
And, "as far as we knew," it was unfounded, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum-Maya admitted that she was not entirely blameless. She and her 
husband indeed owed taxes, but she said they were unaware of it until they saw 
their name in the newspaper. She said she never received a notice in the mail 
in June. 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum-Maya said that after she saw her name in the paper, "we did the 
conscientious thing" and immediately called and wrote the tax collector's 
office to try to clear up the matter. 
</P>
<P>
Despite her efforts, she said her and her husband's name appeared in the 
newspaper a second time. The lists are published three consecutive weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The taxpayers have mixed views about a public apology. 
</P>
<P>
"The county uses its money poorly enough as it is," Fowler said. "The issue is 
really at the front end. Why did this whole thing happen in the first place?" 
</P>
<P>
Greenbaum-Maya and Romero-Gomez said they welcome retractions. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the fair thing to do," Greenbaum-Maya said.
