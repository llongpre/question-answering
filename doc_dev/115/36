   Pemex, the government oil monopoly, said
Friday it will raise prices for crude oil exports to its customers
in the Western Hemisphere on Sept. 1 but prices will remain
unchanged for exports to Europe.
   The announcement was made as the secretary-general of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, Ahmed Subroto of
Indonesia, completed a three-day visit and said Mexico had agreed
not to increase its crude exports.
   Mexico does not belong to OPEC but closely follows the 13-member
organization's pricing and production guidelines.
   Pemex said its Petroleum Foreign Trade Committee had authorized
the price increases for countries in the Western Hemisphere ``to
align prices for exports of Mexican crude with those prevailing in
the international market.''
   Sales to customers in the Western Hemisphere averaged 717,000
barrels daily between January and July _ 54 percent of Mexico's
petroleum exports during that period, according to Pemex. The
United States is the main client.
   Pemex said the price increases will be 10 cents per barrel for
light Isthmus crude and 30 cents for heavy Maya crude because of a
``technical adjustment in export formulas.''
   In July, Isthmus sold for $13.78 a barrel and Maya for $11.21 a
barrel in the Western Hemisphere.
   Subroto told a news conference that ``Mexico reiterated its
collaboration with the petroleum cartel not to increase its
production and to search for the stabilization of the market.''
   He said he was convinced of Mexico's commitment to work with
OPEC and he hoped ``soon the world petroleum market will be
stabilized.''
   The government news agency Notimex announced Friday that Pemex
has begun exports of special diesel fuel to the United States with
a 30 million-liter shipment from the Gulf of Mexico port of
Tampico. A liter is equal to 1.06 liquid quarts.
   Notimex did not identify the U.S. customer but said it was ``one
of the most important United States petroleum companies.''
