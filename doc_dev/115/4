<TEXT>     She was, of course, mistaken: At every bus stop in the capital, Mayan men
and women stand waiting for their rides to work. Yet the teen-ager's ignorance
was somehow logical.;    Her ancestors, the Spanish conquistadors, had wiped
out nine of every 10 Maya Indians they had found in Guatemala in the 16th
century.;    Four hundred years later, her people, called Ladinos, run a
government that does little more than the minimum to improve the lot of the
surviving indigenes, whom they call simply "Indios" and who constitute more
than 40 percent of the popula tion.;    The golden age of the ancient Maya,
the most advanced pre-Columbian civilization in the New World, lasted from
A.D. 250 to 900.;    During that time, they built such magnificent cities as
Chichen Itza, Palenque and Uxmal in Mexico; Copan in Honduras; and Caracol in
Belize. The greatest Mayan city of all is Tikal, which has become Guatemala's
No. 1 tourist attraction.;    But many of the visitors to the Tikal ruins
don't realize that more than 3 million Maya live in Guatemala today -- more
than are found in the other Central American countries and Mexico put
together. Guatemala remains the heartland of Mayan civilization.;    No
pretext for a visit to Guatemala is more compelling than to make acquaintance
with the Maya -- both ancient and living.;    There are many other reasons to
travel to our nearest Central American neighbor: The alpine beauty of the
volcanic highlands, a remarkably favorable exchange rate between the dollar
and the quetzal, a cross-cultural openness in the hinterlands that, in the
words of photojournalist Galen Rowell, reminds one of the free-and-easy hippie
ambiance of Katmandu in the 1960s.;    And, despite continuing skirmishes
between guerrillas and the army, Guatemala is safe for visitors. There is
little of the anti-American feeling found in El Salvador, Nicaragua and
Panama.;    Visitors fly into the capital, Guatemala City. A day there is long
enough, time to wander through its excellent museums housing everything from
ancient Mayan artifacts to modern art, before heading west.;    A smoggy
metropolis, the city was leveled by earthquakes in 1917 and 1976, and as a
result little remains of colonial architecture.;    Only 30 miles west lies
Antigua Guatemala, where the Spanish built a colonial capital to rival Mexico
City. The population today is only 16,000, but the town breathes the
melancholy grandeur of the conquest.;    Half-ruined baroque churches by the
dozen; clean cobblestone streets and bright-hued housefronts; a glimpse of
cool inner patios spangled with hand-painted tiles; and rising 7,000 feet
above the village, the steep blue cone of Volcan Agua, its summit lost in
mist.;    The road wends on, deeper into the highlands, till you come suddenly
upon Lake Atitlan, rimmed by tall mountains whose shoulders slope into the
dark water.;    Tucked in a wrinkle of its north shore is the village of
Panajachel, full of Cakchiquel-speaking Maya and blissed-out hippies, both
young and aging, from Germany, France, Sweden, Holland and even the United
States.;    A morning ferry traverses the lake to the village of Santiago
Atitlan. Cross the waters and you have changed cultures, though at first blush
the markets and churches look the same.;    In Santiago, though, the women
wear white garments, called huipils, instead of the red and blue huipils in
Panajachel. The people speak Tzutuhil instead of Cakchiquel.;    They were
once, in fact, enemies, and if you knew how to probe skillfully enough, you
might still uncover the old Tzutuhil bitterness against their neighbors, who
allied themselves with the butcher Pedro de Alvarado, a lieutenant of Hernando
Cortes, who conquered Guatemala in 1524, bringing Christianity with him.;   
Nothing in Mayan life today is more bizarre than the amalgamation of pagan
with Catholic beliefs.;    In the Santiago church, there is a statue of a
"saint" called Maximon, supposed to be a combination of Judas, Pedro de
Alvarado and the Mayan god Mam. Other towns have a Maximon, whom the people
revile every year during Holy Week. In Santiago, for some reason, at Easter
they take Maximon out of his cupboard, stick a cigar in his mouth and revere
him.;    The most intriguing highland town is Chichicastenango, 25 miles north
of Lake Atitlan. The town is an ancient center of the Quiche (KEE-chay), who
are among the most traditional of today's Maya.;    The market is held every
Thursday and Sunday. Rich in the superbly woven textiles for which the Maya
are famous, the market also displays cunning painted boxes, jade necklaces and
the lurid masks the Maya use in their dances.;    From the highlands,
travelers can fly to the Peten, in the northern lowlands, Guatemala's wild
west. There is only one paved road -- the main route to Tikal.;    The
countryside is seamed with rivers, and the outboard-powered dugout canoe is as
vital to commerce as the diesel truck.;    Flores, a tiny island town in Lake
Peten Itza, is worth a few days' stay.;    From there, you can hire a taxi for
the 40-mile trip to Tikal. Chichen Itza in the Yucatan, the most visited of
all Mayan cities, feels somehow tame, gardened and restored.;    But in Tikal,
deep in the tangled rain forest of the Peten, a primal rawness lingers about
the ruins. A team of archaeologists from the University of Pennsylvania worked
for 13 years in Tikal in the 1960s and 1970s.;    They found more than 3,000
buildings spread over six square miles. Yet for all their labor, most of the
great city remains unexcavated.;    In Tikal, find your way to El Mundo
Perdido, the lost city, whose squat pyramids were built in the Pre-classic
era, long before anything else in Tikal.;    Or prowl through the North
Acropolis and locate the huge, grotesque molded heads hidden in dank side
chambers.;    Walk the Maler Causeway out to Group H, where the walls abound
in enigmatic Mayan graffiti. Climb to the roof comb of Temple IV, at 212 feet
the tallest building ever found in pre-Columbian America, and see how, for all
its grandeur, Tikal is nearly swallowed by the jungle that stretches to the
far horizon.; If you go . . .; (check) Getting There; Several airlines,
including Continental and American, fly to Guatemala City. From there, daily
flights go to Flores in the Peten. These cannot be booked from the United
States but are seldom sold out.;    (check) TOURS -- Several American travel
companies offer one- or two-week guided tours of Guatemala. One of the best is
run by Sobek Expeditions, P.O. Box 1089, Angels Camp 95222;(800) 777-7939.
Other tour operators include Overseas Adventure Travel, (617) 876-0533; Tara
Tours, (800) 327-0080; and Festival Tours, (800) 327-2838. The Guatemalan
Tourist Information Office is (305) 358-5110.;    (check) RENTAL CARS -- The
best way to see the highlands is by rental car, but it is easier and
remarkably inexpensive (about $40 a day or less) to hire a car and driver for
days at a time.;    (check) WHERE TO STAY -- The Hotel Atitlan in Panajachel,
with its secluded beach and splendid flower garden, may be the most delightful
inn in Guatemala. The Mayan Inn in Chichicastenango is a close rival. In
Flores there are a number of decent, cheap hotels ($15-$20 per night). The
Jungle Inn at Tikal has clean rooms and a funky ambiance.  </TEXT>
