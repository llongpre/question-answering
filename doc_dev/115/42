Architect Maya Ying Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 
Washington, D.C., when she was a Yale student, has returned to her alma mater 
to mark the arrival of women undergraduates 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Yale has commissioned Lin to design a sculpture to celebrate new generations of 
Yale women on campus, culminating a yearlong observance of the 20th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
The monument "is more about the future than commemorating the past," Lin said 
this week, and likely will include places where "people can sit and enjoy 
themselves." She would not discuss possible designs. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981 as a senior, Lin's design was chosen from 1,420 entries for the Vietnam 
memorial, a black granite work inscribed with the names of 58,000 Americans 
killed or missing. It is the most visited monument in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Lin also designed a monument to those slain during the civil rights movement. 
The work was dedicated in Montgomery, Ala., in November.
