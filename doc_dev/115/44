On Easter day in Greece, the usual 'good morning' greeting is replaced by
'Christ is risen' as children crack their hard-boiled eggs against those of
their companions in a spring-time version of conkers.
In Britain, eggs tend to be soft-boiled for serving at the Easter breakfast
table. For years, though, I had a childish horror of fresh eggs cooked
lightly. Growing up at a time of rationing when powdered eggs were the norm,
I was repelled by the sticky yolks and semi-jellied whites of soft-boiled
eggs.
One memorable Easter, I went to a tea party at the house of some friends
where, with leaden heart, I saw the table was laid with an egg cup and spoon
at every setting. 'A special treat,' our hostess smiled as we sat down and
the eggs were brought in. My misery deepened when I realised there was no
bread and butter on hand to blot up the worst excesses of eggy liquefaction.
I had no choice but to crack into the beastly thing. I raised my spoon and
bashed the shell ferociously, hoping to spill some of its contents. What
blessed relief to find the egg was not really an egg at all. It had been
blown out and refilled with melted chocolate.
Although it was a harmless, sheep-in-wolf's-clothing type of prank, it was
the sort of surprise I prefer to live without. In fact, I have been nervous
of Easter eggs ever since - unless they are made by Faberge. I offer you,
instead, an undisguised and egg-less chocolate confection.
CHOCOLATE &amp; PRUNE PETITS FOURS (makes about 16)
These are fiddly to make and not worth attempting by the impatient or those
in a hurry. But they are unusual. One or two per person makes an attractive
alternative to pudding at the end of a fine meal, served with coffee and
perhaps brandy or port.
To mould the chocolate shells, you will need some small fluted paper cases
of the sort sold by kitchenware shops and some hardware stores for making
mini-muffins, chocolates and other confectionery.
For the chocolate shells: 5oz best bitter chocolate;  1/2 oz unsalted
butter.
For the filling: 6oz big squashy prunes; 1 1/2 oz sultanas; 1 1/2 oz
currants; 3 fl oz or so each of port and water; 1 tub creme fraiche or
clotted cream; a little cocoa powder.
Put the dried fruits and liquids into a flame-proof casserole with a heavy,
well-fitting lid. Bring very slowly to simmering point. Cover and cook over
the lowest possible flame for one hour, stirring occasionally, until the
fruit is very tender and has absorbed most of the liquid.
Set aside, still covered, for 1 1/2 hours until cold. Then, stone the
prunes, whizz all the fruits and their juices to a rich dark puree, and
refrigerate.
Dice the chocolate and melt it with one teaspoon of warm water in a bowl
placed over a pan of barely-simmering water. Away from the heat, beat in the
butter.
Using a teaspoon, line the paper cases with chocolate, smoothing it across
the base and up the sides right to the top. Spread it thickly: a good ratio
of chocolate to filling makes for good eating, and stout walls are less
fragile and easier to un-mould than thin ones. Chill on a plate.
When the chocolate shells have set solid, fill and un-mould them. To guard
against the chocolate softening messily in the warmth of the kitchen or the
heat of your hands, take the shells out of the refrigerator just one at a
time, work on each one quickly, and put it back in the fridge before
starting on the next. Do not overdo the filling: two-thirds full is better
than brimfull.
Spread a small spoonful of the rich, dark prune puree across the base, add a
snowy covering of cream, and shake a pinch of cocoa powder over the top.
Strip off the paper carefully, loosening it round the rim and peeling it
downwards.
Keep the petits fours in the fridge until you are ready to serve them, and
hand them round on the chilled plate on which they have been stored.
Green &amp; Black's organic chocolate, made with 70 per cent cocoa solids, dark
and agreeably un-sweet, was an instant hit when launched a few years ago.
But it was difficult to buy unless you lived near a health food shop. Now,
it has reached the supermarkets; it is available at Safeway and Sainsbury,
with Waitrose and Tesco to follow soon.
Just in time for Easter, Green &amp; Black is bringing out another chocolate
that looks set for success. Again made with 70 per cent cocoa solids, this
one is called Maya Gold and is flavoured with orange, vanilla and allspice.
Maya Gold is, moreover, the first product to go on sale bearing not only the
Soil Association symbol but also the mark of the Fairtrade Foundation in
recognition of Green &amp; Black's long-term trading commitment to the Maya
Indian cocoa growers of Belize.
Launch stockists are Sainsbury, Tesco, the Co-op and Asda. A 100g bar costs
Pounds 1.95.
