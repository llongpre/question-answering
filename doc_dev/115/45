<HEAD>Polgar Sister Overtakes Chiburdanidze, Kasparov Leads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUCERNE, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zsuzsa Polgar of Hungary moved into
second place behind her top-ranked sister, Judit, in the new women's
chess rankings released Thursday by the International Chess
Federation.
   In the men's category, world champion Garri Kasparov maintained
his lead over fellow Soviet Anatoly Karpov. Vassily Ivanchuk, a
20-year-old Soviet among the youngest in the world's top 100
players, shot from sixth to third place, ahead of Britain's Nigel
Short and Viktor Korchnoi of Switzerland.
   Judit Polgar, who at 13 is the youngest leader ever, stayed first
in the women's list as her older sister, Zsuzsa, moved up one spot
to overtake Maya Chiburdanidze of the Soviet Union. Pia Cramling of
Sweden broke a tie with Nana Ioseliani of the Soviet Union to take
undisputed fourth place.
   The lists are published every six months.
