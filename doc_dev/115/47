   Birtcher Medical Systems Inc., Irvine, Calif., said it
signed a definitive agreement to acquire closely held Solos
Endoscopy Inc. for stock valued at $36.8 million.
   William E. Maya, Birtcher president, said that, as a
result, Birtcher will be better positioned to compete in the
fast-growing field of providing products for "minimally
invasive" surgery. Solos, based in Duluth, Ga., had $19
million in sales for the 12 months ended June 30. The firm
specializes in making products and instruments for minimally
invasive surgery.

   The merger has been approved by the boards of both
companies. The transaction is subject to approval of the
shareholders of both companies, among other things.
   The Birtcher stock used to make the acquisition will be
newly issued shares, Mr. Maya said. Birtcher currently has
7.2 million shares outstanding.
   Birtcher makes electronic medical instruments and
disposable supplies for the health-care industry. In the
fiscal year ended June 30, Birtcher had net income of $1.6
million, or 28 cents a share, on sales of $31 million.
Birtcher closed yesterday at $18.25, up $1.25, in national
over-the-counter trading.
