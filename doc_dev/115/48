   A man who slipped into a coma after drinking a
Colombian soft drink that had been laced with cocaine in an
apparent smuggling scheme died Monday after doctors disconnected
life-support equipment.
   Maximo Rene Menendez, 25, collapsed July 26 after drinking from
a six-ounce bottle of Pony Malta de Bavaria that contained many
times the lethal dose of cocaine. Drinking just one gram of the
drug can be fatal, investigators said.
   ``His life support was disconnected at 5:02 p.m. and he expired
at 5:15,'' said Victor Maya, executive director of AMI Kendall
Regional Medical Center. ``There was absolutely nothing that could
be done for this man.''
   Menendez's family had a court order to cut off his life support
on Aug. 13 after neurologists concluded he had no brain activity.
But his leg moved and he took shallow breaths after the respirator
was turned off the next day.
   Doctors reconnected the equipment and the family asked for a
second opinion by experts at the University of Miami, who agreed
Menendez was brain dead without hope of recovery, Maya said.
   FBI experts have discovered at least 45 contaminated bottles
containing 20 to 40 grams of the drug in a 1,000-case shipment of
the soft drink. Federal officials warned consumers that hundreds of
cases of Pony Malta distributed in South Florida were unaccounted
for.
   The FBI wants to question Hugo Alfredo Rios, whose Miami Sweet
company imported the shipment from Cerveceria Bavaria S.A. in
Colombia. The bottler said Rios was unauthorized to import the
drink.
