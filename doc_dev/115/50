Investigators at the Humane Society of the United States sent a letter 
Wednesday to the San Diego Zoo charging that its elephant exhibit is inadequate 
and "extremely dangerous" for both the huge mammals and their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
The letter to Doug Meyers, director of the San Diego Zoological Society, was 
prompted by the death Sunday of Maya, a 51-year-old Asian elephant that was put 
to death after she fell into a moat and crippled herself. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not question the care Maya received after her tragic fall into the moat, 
nor the fact that euthanasia was the humane decision to make on her behalf," 
wrote David K. Wills, a vice president in the Humane Society's Department of 
Investigations. "However, we are concerned as to what steps zoo officials are 
going to take to improve conditions for the surviving elephants." 
</P>
<P>
Wills criticized the exhibit for its uninsulated floors and its lack of heat 
inside the barn, its limited outdoor shelter and its daily reliance upon chains 
to restrain the elephants. In addition, he charged that a catwalk that connects 
two areas of the elephant yard is precariously narrow, and he called for it to 
be widened. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Jouett, a spokesman for the zoo, acknowledged that the nearly 30-year-old 
elephant yard is "not perfect," but he said the zoo is in the midst of making 
improvements. So far, they have planted shade trees, he said, and replaced 
decaying floor boards with cement. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said the zoo also plans to widen the catwalk. But he rejected Wills' 
claim that "if the catwalk were widened, Maya might still be alive today," 
saying that while no one witnessed her fall, her placement in the moat 
indicated she did not fall off the walkway. Jouett also dismissed Wills' 
assertion that the exhibit, which now houses one African and three Asian 
elephants, is "grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
"It has passed USDA inspections, and we'll welcome the USDA to come look at it 
again," Jouett said, noting that Wills has asked the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture to investigate the exhibit. He called most of Wills' allegations 
"just exaggerations to catch the public's attention. It makes nice quotes but 
it's just not true." 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Homer Malaby, a USDA animal care specialist in Sacramento, said he will 
visit the zoo next week to investigate the Humane Society's allegations. Of 
particular interest, he said, was their charge that the animals have no way to 
escape the rain during the day because they are locked out of their barn. 
</P>
<P>
"If the only shelter the animals have from inclement weather is their indoor 
housing facility, and if they're put out every morning and not allowed back in, 
no matter what the weather, then yes, that would be a violation of the Animal 
Welfare Act," Malaby said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jouett said that the barn door is always opened when it rains. 
</P>
<P>
"They only need walk into the barn," he said, characterizing Wills' letter as 
an attempt to drum up negative publicity. "It's the animal ambulance chaser 
syndrome -- take a tragedy and use it to get your name in the paper." 
</P>
<P>
Wills' letter asserts that nearly half of the zoos approved by the American 
Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums have abandoned the practice of chaining 
elephants at night. 
</P>
<P>
But Jouett said he was "sure" that was an overstatement -- he has only heard of 
a handful of zoos that don't use chains. In the winter months, he said, the San 
Diego Zoo chains its elephants for 16 hours a day, while the rest of the year 
the animals are chained for about 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
"They're chained for the protection of the elephants and the people to make 
sure they don't steal each others' food and to maintain the safety of the 
keepers," Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett called Wills' contention that the elephant barn should be heated 
"intentional misrepresentation." 
</P>
<P>
"The temperature in the elephant barn is not cold," he said. Even during the 
recent frigid weather, he said, when the barn is closed at night "a person 
could walk in there and break a sweat. We have four huge animals that are like 
furnaces -- four huge masses of body heat. Elephants have a problem staying 
cool, not staying warm. It's not a concern."
