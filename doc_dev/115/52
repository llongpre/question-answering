   Zookeepers and elephants are mourning the death
of the San Diego Zoo's oldest and most popular elephant, a
10,000-pound matriarch that led the herd for 47 years and
entertained millions of tourists.
   The 51-year-old Asian elephant, named Lucki, was put to sleep
Sunday because her health had deteriorated to where she could no
longer stand, even with the help of a forklift, said spokesman Jeff
Jouett.
   ``She was one of most popular and best-loved animals at the
zoo,'' said Jouett, who estimated that 102 million tourists had
seen her over the years.
   Lucki, who came to San Diego in 1941 from a zoo in Calcutta,
India, was the zoo's biggest and most dominant elephant. She stood
9 feet at the shoulder.
   ``It's a major passage in the zoo elephant herd when the
matriarch dies,'' Jouett said. ``The current elephant keepers love
her dearly and are stunned by her loss. ... It's a subdued day at
the zoo.''
   About 10 years ago, Lucki started suffering from chronic tooth
and foot ailments, Jouett said.
   In 1981, Lucki became the first captive elephant to have a tooth
pulled. Keepers regularly trimmed her foot pads to lessen her
problems, which were caused by lack of exercise.
   But during the past week, her condition worsened because of an
infection in her front feet. Sunday morning Lucki was unable to
stand.
   ``The veterinarian believes she reputured the muscles in (her)
back legs while trying to push herself up,'' Jouett said. ``They
tried coaxing her up. They brought in a forklift with a crane
attached. There was no way she could move.''
   After consulting with elephant keepers and curator of mammals
Rick Barongi, veterinarian Don Janssen injected the fatal shot of a
drug, the spokesman said.
   Among the witnesses were the zoo's director, Doug Myers, who
came in on his day off, and eight former or present elephant
keepers. The zoo's five other elephants were brought in later.
   ``Elephants are very intelligent and they can understand why one
of their own is no longer with them,'' Jouett said. ``They do a
very similar thing in the wild, so Maya and other elephants got an
hour to pay last respects.''
   Maya is a 49-year-old Asian elephant that came from India with
Lucki and was her best friend, he said.
   As matriarch, Lucki was always the first in the herd to eat and
enter the yard from the barn, Jouett said. She also was responsible
for disciplining members of the herd, as well as defending it from
intruders.
   Asian elephants have lived to nearly age 70 in captivity, but
are believed to have shorter life spans in the wild, Jouett said.
Lucki's body was transported to the zoo's hospital for a necropsy.
