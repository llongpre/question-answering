   The Egyptian navy stopped an Israeli tour ship
that apparently strayed off course Friday in the Red Sea and
detained it for five hours, the Foreign Ministry and Israel radio
reported.
   Thirty-five people were aboard, including French and West German
tourists, the reports said. Israel radio said the vessel and those
aboard were released after Egyptian diplomats intervened at
Israel's request.
   The ministry and radio reported another incident Friday in which
the Egyptian navy seized an Israeli fishing boat in the Red Sea and
took six people into custody.
   A ministry spokesman said it was not interceding for the
fishermen, detained off the Sinai Peninsula 40 miles south of Elat,
because ``If Israelis fish in Egyptian territorial water, we know
it's against the Egyptian law.''
   Several hours before the reports, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres
formally accepted a U.S. invitation to a meeting on Middle East
peace Sept. 26 with President Reagan, Secretary of State George P.
Shultz and Esmat Abdel-Meguid, foreign minister of Egypt.
   Interception of the cruise vessel was the most serious
Israeli-Egyptian border incident involving tourists since a berserk
Egyptian policeman opened fire in October 1985 in a Sinai desert
resort, killing six Israelis.
   Israel radio said the Egyptian gunboat Insah intercepted the
tour ship Maya south of Taba, a disputed border area.
   It said the warship rammed a hole in the Israeli vessel,
breaking water pipes. Those aboard the tour ship were 15 tourists
from France and West Germany, 15 Israeli vacationers and a five-man
Israeli crew.
   The radio quoted Capt. Moshe Saar of the Maya as saying the
Egyptians threatened his ship with guns and later jammed radio
communications.
   After a search, the Israeli vessel was towed to an Egyptian navy
base on nearby Coral Island and an Israeli navy ship in nearby
waters was told not to intervene, the radio reported.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said it was advised of the incident
at about 2 p.m. and ``we approached the Egyptian ambassador in Tel
Aviv and asked him to intervene.''
   Ministry officials also were in touch with the Egyptian military
liaison office and the Israeli Embassy in Cairo, he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's definitely not clear to us what the boat did,'' he said.
``It was probably cruising within an area where Egyptians do not
allow our boats to cruise.''
