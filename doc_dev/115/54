In the latest tit-for-tat exchange with the San Diego Zoo, investigators at the 
Humane Society of the United States on Friday attacked the credibility of the 
zoo's spokesman and restated their belief that the elephant exhibit is badly in 
need of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no nice way to put this," David K. Wills, a vice president in the 
Humane Society's Department of Investigations, said in a press release 
rebutting several published statements made by Jeff Jouett, the zoo's 
spokesman. "He's just not telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
To support that claim, Wills provided documents that appear to show that top 
zoo officials sought in 1984 to widen a narrow cat walk and in 1985 assessed 
how much it would cost to install heaters in the elephant barn. As yet, neither 
improvement has been made, and Jouett has said that heaters are unnecessary 
because the elephants' body heat is furnace-like. 
</P>
<P>
Wills and Jouett have been trading charges in the press since Thursday, when 
The Times reported that the Humane Society was seeking an investigation of the 
exhibit after the death of Maya, a 51-year-old Asian elephant that was 
euthanized after she fell into a moat and injured herself. Wills charged that 
Maya's death proved that the elephant enclosure is "grossly inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
But, on Friday, Jouett said Wills' allegations stemmed solely from "a 
disgruntled employee who now makes a profession out of zoo-bashing" -- a 
reference to Lisa Landres, a former elephant keeper at the San Diego Zoo who is 
now a Humane Society investigator based in Washington. Landres resigned in 1989 
because, she said, the zoo was punishing her for being outspoken about the 
beating of the elephant Dunda. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett, who has acknowledged that the elephant exhibit is "not perfect," said 
that, by necessity, repairs at the 100-acre zoo must be done in order of 
priority. Although the zoo plans to widen the cat walk eventually, he said, it 
is not an urgent need. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's an immediate concern for animal health or safety or human health or 
safety, then it rises to the top of the priority list," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Wills, meanwhile, provided a copy of an internal zoo memo, dated Aug. 9, 1984, 
in which zoo officials listed, in order of priority, what they called 
"modifications requirements" in the elephant mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Roocroft, the elephant supervisor for the zoo and Wild Animal Park, said 
the first priority was improved access for heavy-duty vehicles -- an 
improvement that Jouett said has since been completed. The second priority, in 
a list of six, suggested replacing a large pool with a smaller one in order to 
accommodate wider walkways. 
</P>
<P>
"Currently it is not possible for more than one animal to safely negotiate its 
way around the pool," Roocroft's memo said. "In addition, the space is so 
narrow that the possibility always exists that an animal might lose its footing 
and tumble into the moat." 
</P>
<P>
Another memo a month later estimated that it would cost $4,000 to make those 
changes to the pool and cat walk. 
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Roocroft's safety concerns would classify the 
walkway-widening project as urgent, Jouett said no. He said that, although no 
one witnessed Maya's fall on Sunday, he believes she did not fall off the cat 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
"An elephant can be bumped into the moat from any point in the exhibit, whether 
on the cat walk or not," he said. In response to the memo, he said: "It doesn't 
say the elephants were at risk if they were walking in single file. It doesn't 
say that one animal is in danger. Yesterday I saw two elephants there -- they 
walked the whole length and lived to tell about it." 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Friedlund, an elephant keeper who was the first to rush to Maya's aid 
after she fell, said that it is "almost an absolute sure bet" that Maya fell 
from the cat walk. When Friedlund found the elephant, her back legs were in the 
moat and her front elbows were resting on the cat walk, indicating that she had 
fallen head-first from the walk and was trying to right herself. 
</P>
<P>
"The walkway is a death trap," said Friedlund, who estimated the cat walk is 2 
1/2 feet wide. "The zoo has known the problem for a long time. They're 
defending their Disneyland image that everything is safe and sound here. It's 
time to get on with the business of solving the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Another inter-office memo provided by Wills estimates the cost of installing 
elephant barn floor heating. In the September, 1985 memo, Hella Winter, a 
project coordinator in the zoo's architecture and design department, estimated 
that it would cost $15,000 to install a 12-foot-wide heated strip in the 
concrete floor that would run the full length of the barn. 
</P>
<P>
The memo was addressed to Friedlund, Carmi G. Penny, the zoo's curator of 
mammals, and another animal care specialist who has since left the zoo. At the 
bottom, Winter has written: "Please call us &amp; let's decide ASAP what to 
do!" 
</P>
<P>
According to Wills, Winter's memo came in response to keeper documentation of 
frigid temperatures -- 40 degrees and lower -- in the elephant barn at night. 
</P>
<P>
"Without heating in the floor, the concrete draws the body heat away from the 
elephants when they lie down," Wills' press release asserts, adding that the 
keepers recorded the cold temperatures when there were seven elephants in the 
barn. "With only four left, Mr. Jouett's idea that they are 'furnaces' loses 
even more credibility." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett responded that he had heard that Landres and Friedlund measured the 
temperatures in a zoo office, not in the barn, "in an attempt to prove their 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Friedlund countered that in fact, Curby Simerson, the zoo's assistant animal 
care manager, was the person who held the thermometer in the barn. It read 34 
degrees, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But Jouett said that was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not 40 degrees in the barn with the elephants," he said. "Consider the 
source. . . . Two years gone and 3,000 miles away, Lisa (Landres) is still 
trying to push through her pet projects, and she's using (The Times) to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Reached in Washington on Friday, Landres said, "That's just a lie. You wouldn't 
believe how cold it is in there. Whether I worked there or not, why don't they 
focus their energy on making the place better?" 
</P>
<P>
Sally Mackler, a spokeswoman for the animal rights group San Diego Animal 
Advocates, echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a poor excuse and an easy out to blame a 'disgruntled employee,' " 
Mackler said in a statement. "We should take a closer look at why Lisa Landres 
was dissatisfied with zoo policies and methods regarding the elephants' care." 
</P>
<P>
Wills also contested Jouett's claim that the elephants may take shelter in 
their barn during inclement daytime weather. 
</P>
<P>
"The elephant barn has not been made available to the elephants as a shelter 
from the rain, except in rare, isolated instances when past keeper staff let 
the elephants indoors due to extreme cold or wind," Wills wrote. "With this 
documentation in hand, you may join with us in realizing that it's difficult to 
know what to believe when the San Diego Zoo responds to criticism." 
</P>
<P>
Jouett responded: "In a hard, cold rain, the doors are opened. If it's a warm 
day or a light shower, and they're showing no ill effects, the doors probably 
won't be open. For an elephant, that's not inclement weather." 
</P>
<P>
He added, "What happens if it rains in Africa or Asia? Do the elephants run in 
the barn then? The elephants like the rain."
