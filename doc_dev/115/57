<LEADPARA>  Anthropologists digging into an 8th century pyramid in Guatemala say they
opened a tomb of what may be one of the last great leaders of the Mayan
civilization.;    Officials at Vanderbilt University announced Tuesday that a
group led by Arthur Demarest, a professor of anthropology, removed the final
loose stones under an ancient Mayan pyramid and found a skeleton wearing a
bejeweled headpiece.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Tracey Ferrell, the project administrator at Vanderbilt, said she talked
briefly with Demarest on Tuesday and was told that the researchers found the
skeleton amid elaborately decorated pottery and knife blades made of obsidian
glass.;    "It's definitely a ruler of some kind," Ferrell said. "Obsidian was
an elite material in the Mayan world because it had to be brought from far
away.";    Obsidian is a volcanic glass. Knives made from the material were
used in bloodletting ceremonies among the royalty, she said.;    The pyramid
is in an ancient city known as Dos Pilas that is thought to have been the
capital of the Petexbatun region of Guatemala. It is near the present city of
Antigua.;    Ferrell said Demarest reported that the headdress adorning the
skeleton was made of mother of pearl, shells and jade, and said to be in
excellent condition.;    Workers are tediously removing soil and debris around
the skeleton, and Ferrell said the legs have been uncovered.;    Pottery in
the tomb is covered in hieroglyphics that may give clues to the relationship
of the Mayan center where the pyramid is situated and the rest of the Mayan
civilization.;    Ferrell said the skeleton may be that of a monarch known to
researchers as Ruler 2. This name is used because no other has been found.;   
Demarest, who has been excavating in the area for two years, said in a report
that the royal tomb was located on the edge of a great plaza and is near a
monument, called Stela 8, that is dedicated to Ruler 2. The stela bears a date
of A.D. 715.;    "Ruler 2 was one of the kings that launched the ambitious
program of conquest in the 8th century," Demarest reported. This led to
formation of what he called the largest territorial state in Maya history. By
A.D. 740, he said the kingdom started by Ruler 2 stretched for 1,500 square
miles along the Pasion River.;    Researchers believe the father of Ruler 2,
known only as Ruler 1, was expelled from the Mayan city of Tikal a generation
earlier. He went 60 miles into the jungle and established Dos Pilas.;    Ruler
2, Demarest said, was the key figure in five decades of war that "may have
destroyed the ecology of the region.";    He said the war and the expansion of
Ruler 2 empire may have changed the agriculture system of the area and forced
farmers into agrarian habits that stripped the land. War may have finally
forced the population to seek shelter in defensible areas of the city.;   
Eventually, the Mayan civilization collapsed in about A.D. 830.;    Ferrell
said there is evidence that the city was placed under siege at one point.
Stones from the pyramid and other structures were arranged in a circle around
the city. Within these circles are weapons artifacts, suggesting the intense
warfare that was waged.;    When the pyramid was first discovered, Ferrell
said, it appeared to be only a mound covered with grass and trees. Centuries
of weathering had removed mortar from around the stones, leaving them loose.
Workers had to shore up a shaft being dug into the pyramid to prevent the
large rocks from falling.;    Artifacts recovered from the dig cannot be
removed from Guatemala and eventually will be stored in the national museum
there, she said.  </TEXT>
