<HEAD>12-Year-Old Hungarian Tops Women Ratings</HEAD>

   Judit Polgar, a 12-year-old
Hungarian, has been ranked No. 1 in the world in women's chess, the
youngest ever to top the list.
   In the men's rankings, World Champion Gary Kasparov continued to
top the list ahead of former title holder Anatoly Karpov.
   Miss Polgar, the youngest of three chess-playing sisters,
overtook World Champion Maya Chiburdanidze in the ratings published
Wednesday by the International Chess Federation.
   ``It's the first time that we have a 12-year-old at the top of
the ratings,'' said Casto Abundo, assistant secretary-general of the
federation.
   Ms. Chiburdanidze is ranked second, and Miss Polgar's 19-year-old
sister, Zsuzsa, is rated third. The third Polgar sister, 15-year-old
Sofia, is ranked 35th on the women's list.
   Kasparov and Karpov, both of the Soviet Union, held the top two
spots, but Britain strenghtened its position. Nigel Short was ranked
third, Jonathan Speelman was fourth and John Nunn was ninth.
   The Netherlands' top hope, grandmaster Jan Timman, who placed
third a year ago and fifth in July, fell to 11th place.
   The ratings are compiled twice annually by the Lucerne-based
chess federation, on the basis of players' performances at
international tournaments.
   The Americans figured lower in the rankings: highest in the men's
field was Yasser Seirawan at 13th, Boris Gulko was 20th, Nick de
Firmian was 45th, Maxim Dlugy was 46th and Lubomir Kavalek was 49th.
   Among the women, Anna Akhcharumova was 9th, but no other U.S.
player listed among the top 50 women.
