<F P=106> [Communique issued by the Farabundo Marti National </F>
Liberation Front Party National Council, read by Jorge Shafik 
Handal, general party coordinator, at party headquarters in San 
Salvador -- live] 
  [Text] The FMLN [Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front] 
National Council, during its regular afternoon and evening 
meeting on 9 May, discussed as the agenda's main point the 
FMLN's participation in the Legislative Assembly. The FMLN 
adopted the following conclusions and agreements: 
  1. The FNLN's legislative programs and plans were made known 
and approved. These define the goals and tasks that will be our 
deputies' work in the struggle for democracy and social justice. 
The Council agreed to publish and make known this document of 
guidelines and actions to be undertaken that constitutes a 
commitment to the Salvadoran people. In this way, we place it 
at the disposal of the diverse peoples and national sectors for 
debate and enrichment. 
  2. In keeping with Article 30, Paragraph 1, of our by-laws, 
Comrade Deputy Manuel Orlando Quinteros Aguilar, alias Gerzon 
Martinez, has been appointed leader of our legislative faction. 
  3. Regarding the events that occurred during the 1 May 
installation of the Legislative Assembly and the events that 
followed, the National Council: 
  A. Ratifies and supports the decision by the Political 
Commission not to participate in the Legislative Assembly's 
Board of Directors. ARENA [Nationalist Republican Alliance] has 
turned this Board into a tool of its hegemony and antidemocratic 
actions through the surprising and illegal last-minute reform of 
its internal regulations. Under these conditions, the 
Assembly's Board of Directors does not reflect the proportional 
composition that resulted from the 20 March elections and 
exacerbates the internal regulation that requires deep reform 
for democratizing the Legislative Assembly's actions. 
  The Council reaffirms that the FMLN's participation in the 
Legislative Assembly's Board of Directors depends on democratic 
reform of the regulations. 
  B. It ratifies and supports the contents and terms of the 
communique issued by the FMLN's general coordinator on 3 May 
regarding this event. 
  C. It censures the action of seven deputies who, having been 
appointed candidates by the FMLN, which is committed to the 
struggle for democracy, bowed to ARENA's maneuver by 
participating in the Board of Directors' election and by 
accepting posts on the board. It also censures Joaquin 
Villalobos, who without being a deputy has played an important 
role as instigator of this action. 
  The National Council believes that the behavior of these 
eight comrades during and after 1 May constitute a persistent 
divisive action that violates the norms that rule the FMLN's 
endeavors and that undermine the foundation of its unity 
agreement. This is undoubtedly a serious transgression against 
our party's principles, goals, and by-laws and a harsh blow to 
the hopes that hundreds of thousands Salvadorans have placed in 
the FMLN. 
  D. Before and after 1 May, the eight mentioned comrades have 
had the chance to participate, with all the rights that the 
by-laws grant to FMLN members, in the debates and the 
decisionmaking. Nevertheless, they did not openly present to the 
Political Commission their intentions nor did they attend this 
National Council meeting to present and debate their opinions 
and positions. The by-laws approved and signed by all state: 
Taking into consideration the significant value of party unity, 
and within the framework of free discussion of ideas, it is 
required that decisions be adopted by consensus. If this is not 
achieved, the minority will respect the decisions of the 
majority. Article 8 of the by-laws. 
  The National Council point outs that the argument that 
within 
the FMLN there is systematic confrontation of three against two 
is false. It does not correspond to the reality in innumerable 
cases of unanimous and consensus votes of four to one and 
diverse compositions of three to two. 
  E. Given the above reasons, the National Council agrees to: 
  E.1. De-authorize as FMLN representatives Deputies Eduardo 
Sancho, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, Juan Ramon Medrano, Fidel 
Recinos, Eli Avileo Diaz, Sonia Aguinada Carranza, Francisco 
Mena Sandoval, and Joaquin Villalobos. 
  E.2. Suspend all these comrades from the posts to which they 
have been assigned by the National Council. Ask the National 
Resistance and the People's Revitalizing Expression to correct 
the conduct that has given way to this situation and to propose 
substitutes for approval by the Council to participate in the 
continuing internal debate and in the task of party management. 
  E.3. Convene a special national convention in June -- after 
canvassing the opinion of the party's rank and file -- to ratify 
these National Council agreements and to adopt the corresponding 
decisions to normalize the situation and foster the FMLN's 
struggle and development. In light of the special national 
convention, the National Council asks the party's diverse 
district and sectoral structures to hold a broad consultative 
debate.
