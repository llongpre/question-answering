<LEADPARA>  ON THE front steps of the 450-year-old Santo Tomas Church in this city, Mayan
Indians can be seen burning incense in coffee cans, crossing themselves like
Catholics, but speaking softly to their own gods.;    In other small churches
throughout Guatemala, Indians recite traditional Catholic prayers on the same
cold floors where they later talk sincerely, often to the point of tears, to
the images of historic figures, who for them represent different gods.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the last decade, Catholic missionaries have worked hard to help the
Indians combine elements of their traditional religion with Catholic teaching
to convert the Mayans, who make up nearly half of the country's 9 million
people.;    Religion is just one of the forces working to change the Indians
in Guatemala, one of the largest indigenous populations in all of Latin
America.;    Political turmoil and violence have plagued Guatemala since the
mid-1950s and Indians have often been caught between warring factions fighting
for control of territory and the population. The incursion of modern
communications also has aided the erosion of Indian culture. Many of the most
remote villages now have TV satellite dishes; North American-style programs
and advertising are becoming a regular part of community life.;    The
Catholic effort to incorporate Mayan culture in its worship is being countered
by the recent surge of evangelical Christians in Guatemala who regard the
ancient religious practices as pagan.;    Those who study the Maya say the
effort by Catholics to blend religious practices and the zealous proselytizing
by growing evangelical groups are whittling away at the Indians' traditional
lifestyles.;    "Ethnic diversity is in danger of dying out in this decade,"
said Samuel Franco, owner of an indigenous music museum in Antigua. "The
traditional Indian religious music played by marimbas and wood flutes is
rarely played any more. The religious dances by masked dancers are rarely
performed.";    The period before Easter has become a stark reminder of how
the modern age and the pull of different missionaries has begun to unravel the
Indian culture.;    During Holy Week in the village of Santiago Atitlan, for
instance, hundreds of Mayans offer cheap rum, cigars and new clothes to the
wood statue "saint" they call Maximon, a combination wise man, healer and
judge.;    In earlier times, Mayans by the thousands, dressed in traditional
garb and playing wooden flutes and drums, used to flock to this village to
venerate Maximon. This week, only a few hundred showed up, wearing jeans and
T-shirts, listening to cassette tapes of Mayan music.;    Bishop Efrain
Hernandez, secretary to Guatemalan Archbishop Prospero Penados del Barrios,
says the Catholic Church is not trying to destroy indigenous beliefs, but
simply mix two ways of thinking.;    The Catholic Church has tried so hard to
accept Mayan behavior that it has come increasingly under fire by evangelicals
who say Catholics are ignoring black magic ceremonies, including the sacrifice
of chickens, and the use of liquor at celebrations honoring Indian saints.;   
"We have a strong movement among the Indians and their actions are pagan.
That's a fact," said Edmundo Madrid, president of Guatemala's Evangelical
Alliance. "We are trying to stop the rituals. They do all kinds of image
worshiping and believe in animism. The Catholics try to unite everything, but
what they are doing is not Christian."  </TEXT>
