The Palos Verdes High girls cross-country team did not run its fastest times of 
the year at last week's sweltering CIF Southern Section qualifying meet at Mt. 
San Antonio College. But, as Coach Joe Kelly will tell you, the Sea Kings had 
their burners set on low. 
</P>
<P>
"We were just running to qualify," Kelly said. "Our girls will run considerably 
faster on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
Palos Verdes still ran the fastest team time at the preliminaries. Saturday 
morning, led by sophomores Tami Wilcox and Maya Muneno, the Sea Kings will try 
to win their fifth consecutive 4-A Division championship at Mt. SAC in Walnut. 
No other school has ever won more than three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids work their tail off, they deserve the credit," said Kelly, whose 
girls team has also won two consecutive State Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern Section and L.A. City finals, Saturday at Pierce College, will 
determine representatives for the state championships Nov. 25 in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
The top five teams from each Southern Section division and the top five 
individuals from teams that do not place will qualify for the state meet. The 
top two City Section teams and top five individuals not on those teams will go 
to Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
The only team regarded as a threat to the Palos Verdes girls is Buena of 
Ventura . 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to consider ourselves the favorite," Kelly said. "To beat us, 
(Buena) would have to run very well, and we'd have to be a little off." 
</P>
<P>
The Torrance boys qualified for the 4-A final, led by Israel Pose, who covered 
the hilly three-mile course in 15 minutes, 41 seconds last week, tops in his 
heat. Pose should place in the top five individual finishers. 
</P>
<P>
The Palos Verdes boys have also qualified for the final. Kelly hopes the team 
can place sixth or higher. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys 3-A Division, West Torrance ran the third-fastest qualifying time. 
If the Warriors run well, they could challenge Hart and San Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
The Miraleste girls team qualified for the 1-A final. 
</P>
<P>
Carson's Steven Gonzales and Banning's Roman Rendon will once again duel for 
top spot among South Bay runners at the City finals. 
</P>
<P>
Gonzales and Rendon each ran 15:32 over three miles to qualify for the final on 
Pierce's flat course. 
</P>
<P>
Carson Coach Bill Mocnik said Gonzales could challenge for the City individual 
championship if he can stay close to the leaders and catch them at the end. The 
Colts' Richard Raya, who placed fifth in last year's City final, could also 
crack the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Joel Mayorga of San Pedro and Ryan Winn of Narbonne ran well in qualifying 
heats.
