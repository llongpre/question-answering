  [Text] Maya Ganiyeva, our correspondent in Uzbekistan, once 
again in her reportage returns to the program's theme of spring 
floods, but the report is much more alarming than those from 
Nizhniy Novgorod and Rostov-on-Don. The fact is that, 
specifically because of heavy flooding, the threat of 
radioactive pollution hangs over the heavily populated Fergana 
Valley of Uzbekistan. Let us hear from Maya Ganiyeva: 
  [Ganiyeva] I am bringing you this report from the shores of 
the mountain river Mayli-Say. The town with the same name in 
Kyrgyzstan is situated not far from here. It was founded in the 
1930's following the discovery of uranium ores. Its processing 
capacities--an enrichment factory and a hydrometallurgical 
works-- were soon built. In 1968, when all supplies were 
exhausted, they were simply destroyed. Traces remained, 
however, just as the burial grounds of radioactive materials 
also remained. What is interesting is that there is radioactive 
waste in the ground from everywhere, even from Czechoslovakia. 
  Following the mudslides, heavy rain, and landslides, there 
was a real danger of poisonous substances finding their way into 
the river. It is swollen to an incredible size here. At any 
moment, the water sweeping all around may also wash away the 
radioactive tombs. There below is the Fergana Valley. The most 
alarming thing is that this whole area, the Syr Darya River that 
runs through it, and large regions of Central Asia may become 
polluted. That is why the Governments of Uzbekistan and 
Kyrgyzstan and the public have sounded the alarm. Even now a 
government commission has been set up, and there has been rapid 
strengthening of the banks. Hydrological facilities that may 
absorb the waters are being planned. 
  I flew in here with a special international group headed by 
Ecosan, the Uzbekistan ecology and health fund. The Ecosan 
international fund has brought aid--medical supplies and 
disposable syringes--to those hit by the landslides. 
  My companion is Yusuf Shedemetov, president of the Ecosan 
international fund. Yusuf Shedemetovich, what is being done to 
avert a disaster? 
  [Shedemetov] The main task is to bring it to the attention 
of 
the world community, the leaders of the Central Asian states, 
and the governments of this region--all governments. In 
addition, it is also necessary to ask the Russian Federation for 
help. Many specialists and many leaders of the ministry of that 
time worked in this region. They left a lot of traces. Also, 
our research here shows that there is still a lack of technical 
documentation that would be very useful today for deeper 
scientific research. That is why the Academy of Sciences of the 
Russian Federation and many ministries, departments, and state 
committees could render practical aid. 
  [Ganiyeva] Yes, it would be a very great mistake if these 
blossoming pistachio and apricot orchards were turned into a 
mini-Chernobyl. One would like to hope that the efforts of 
ecologists and the public will not be wasted and that the valley 
will be preserved for life.
