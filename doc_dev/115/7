   A jungle-shrouded city of pyramids and
temples in Guatemala was built as long ago as 630 B.C., showing
that Mayan civilization blossomed about four centuries earlier than
believed, scientists say.
   The findings may make the ancient city of Nakbe in northern
Guatemala one of the oldest in the Americas, researchers said.
   ``It's a very significant discovery,'' said Arthur Demarest,
anthropology chairman at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee.
   The University of California, Los Angeles, on Monday announced
the findings by archaeologist Richard Hansen and colleagues at
UCLA, Utah's Brigham Young University and Guatemala's University of
San Carlos.
   ``We have substantial evidence that this is the earliest Maya
urban center ever found,'' Hansen said.
   BYU anthropology chairman Donald Forsyth added, ``We're now
going to have to push the beginning of Maya civilization back
further into the past.''
   Archaeologists once believed advanced Mayan civilization emerged
around A.D. 300 and ended 600 years later during what is described
as the ``classic period.'' Research conducted during 1978-83 at El
Mirador, Guatemala, pushed that date back to 200 B.C.
   But in excavating Nakbe, 350 miles north of Guatemala City and
not far from El Mirador, Hansen's 50-member team determined that
roughly 100 stone pyramids and other buildings were from about 630
B.C. to 400 B.C. So were some of the site's 65,000 pottery pieces,
sculptures, figurines and other artifacts.
   Dates can be determined by the radioactivity of carbon in
organic material associated with buildings. Pottery is dated by
comparison with the style of shards from elsewhere in Central
America.
   ``We have from 1000 B.C. to 600 B.C. a small village with wooden
buildings,'' Hansen said by telephone from his home in Rupert,
Idaho. ``Then all of a sudden _ boom! They brought in rock and fill
and buried the village and made platforms. On those they placed
their buildings.''
   Hansen said Nakbe's buildings include 35- to 150-foot-tall
platforms and flat-topped pyramids, many of which are topped by
three small temples and sculpture depicting important gods and
kings. The buildings are solid, without interior rooms.
   The scale of construction reflects the emergence of an
administrative and religious elite to command thousands of workers,
Hansen said.
   Anthropologist John Graham of the University of California,
Berkeley, said an even earlier center of advanced Mayan
civilization may be found.
   Still, Graham said, the Nabke study ``is part of the most
exciting Maya discovery of recent decades.''
   The discovery solves a puzzle for archaeologists: The Mayans
seemed to evolve more slowly from farming communities to cities
than other pre-Columbian civilizations to the north and south. But
archaeologists say Nakbe proves that Mayan development occurred
more or less in step with the rise of the Olmec culture in Mexico,
thought to be the oldest civilization of the Americas.
   An archaeologist mapped some of Nakbe's architecture in 1962.
Hansen first visited in 1987 and his team conducted the first
full-scale excavation last February through April.
   Hansen's team hacked their way through dense jungle for three
days and 40 miles to reach Nakbe from the nearest road. They hauled
water from a swamp 4 miles away. Demarest admiringly called it
``macho archaeology.''
   Among the most important finds at Nakbe is a sculpture on a
limestone slab that probably dates from about 400 B.C. and is about
10 feet tall, 4 feet wide and 18 inches thick.
   The sculpture of two royal figures and a god ``is the earliest
and largest preclassic sculpture ever found,'' Hansen said.
   Other discoveries include seashells and obsidian glass tools
that indicate emergence of long-distance trade. There also are
signs of a society taming its environment: gutter-like water
collection systems on six buildings and 60-foot-wide stone-and-mud
roads, Hansen said.
   He said he believes transformation from village to city happened
because trade and the need for water and transportation fostered
emergence of an administrative and religious elite, which then
ordered construction of temples.
