<F P=106> [News conference by Joaquin Villalobos, leader of the </F>
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, with unidentified 
reporters on 22 March at the Presidente Hotel in San Salvador -- 
live or recorded] 
  [Text] [Villalobos] As time goes by we are receiving 
detailed reports -- 48 hours after the elections -- on how the 
elections were conducted. These reports led us to conclusions 
beyond those that we reached on 20 March as the results were 
released. We had an informal agreement that as preliminary 
results were being released we could analyze the elections. Our 
plan was to make an assessment before the results were released. 
In our assessment, we reported that some citizens were unable 
to vote. No one can estimate the number of people who could not 
vote. We have an indication, though. For instance, we have a 
list of people who approached an ONG [expansion unknown] and 
were unable to vote despite having their voter registration 
cards. The list was prepared over a few hours and describes 
incidents at a polling station in La Union Department. This list 
includes about 200 people who had their voter registration cards 
but could not vote. The exclusion of voters is the first 
anomaly we reported in the elections. 
  As time goes by, we are receiving other reports. For 
example, a critical case involves the Jucuapa Municipality, 
Usulutan Department. Two Arena [Nationalist Republican 
Alliance] members, whose names I know, were caught red-handed. 
One of them had poll watcher credentials, and the other was a 
member of a voting table board. They were caught with a large 
number of Arena ballots that were in the box. This incident 
prompted... [pauses] in the Jucuapa case, there are ballot boxes 
that had more votes than the number of votes that each box was 
supposed to have, that is, there are boxes that had more than 
400 votes. This also happened in other communities. 
  The Jucuapa incident prompted the raid on the town's mayoral 
office at a time when all ballot boxes inside. [sentence as 
heard] Members of all opposing parties, including the CD 
[Democratic Convergence], the National Solidarity Movement, the 
Unity Movement, the Christian Democratic Party, and the FMLN, 
staged a protest together, because we were worried that the 
ballot boxes could be taken away and tampered with. 
  There are also a large number of reports on minors who had 
voter registration cards. There are also reports on people who 
came to vote and realized that someone else had voted for them. 
We are receiving a number of votes... [pauses] in other 
communities, we found ballots marked on the front that were 
supposedly lost. We found them and are using them as proof. 
  The most serious report consists of Arena ballots already 
marked that were placed in the boxes. The other serious report 
consists of FMLN ballots that were lost. Everything indicates 
that more ballots were printed than were needed. There was a 
plan to print ballots twice. However, at the moment we cannot 
determine how large this operation was. We know that the 
ballots were printed by the Laser Printing Company, whose owner 
is General Alejandro Vides Casanova, former defense minister and 
former National Guard chief. We must emphasize that we reported 
this earlier. We opposed printing the ballots there. Our 
position called for the ballots to be printed abroad. 
  [Reporter] What are you denouncing? 
  [Villalobos] We are denouncing a fraud whose extent we have 
not yet been able to determine. This afternoon, we filed 
protests to contest results in various places. In the 
department of... [pauses] in San Miguel Municipality, Mr. Garcia 
Prieto took 15 ballot boxes home with him. We are contesting 
those 15 ballot boxes. 
  [Reporter] Where are those boxes from? 
  [Villalobos] From San Miguel Municipality, from the city of 
San Miguel. 
  [Reporter] [words indistinct] number of anomalies, in other 
words... 
  [Villalobos, interrupting] We are proceeding through legal 
means. This afternoon we filed protests in various places. The 
problem is that this kind of fraud, depending on how extensive 
it truly is -- and granted, it is true that it may not affect 
the final outcome of the presidential election, and we cannot 
determine this anyway -- nevertheless, it did indeed affect 
mayoral and deputy elections, because these elections can be 
decided by 10 votes, six votes, 20 votes, or 50 votes. This is 
a very complex situation. 
  More important is that we are extremely worried because 
Arena 
has claimed to have won 42 deputy seats. This claim conflicts 
with our vote count. According to our count, Arena has won 37 
deputy seats so far, while the FMLN has won 23 deputy seats. 
  It worries us that on the very night of the elections the 
PCN 
[National Conciliation Party] claimed to have won up to 14 
deputy seats. At this time, we think all of these anomalies are 
designed to establish a majority between the PCN and Arena in 
the Legislative Assembly. This would constitute very serious 
and substantial fraud.
