<LEADPARA>  A ceramic vessel bearing rows of Maya glyphs and scenes of mythological events
has been identified by scholars as the earliest known evidence of book writing
in America.;   Scholars said Wednesday the illustrations on the sides of the
10-inch-high rectangular vessel represent pages from a Mayan book, showing
that the great but mysterious Central American civilization produced books as
early as the eighth century, at least 500 years earlier than previously known.  </LEADPARA>
