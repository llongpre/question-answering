Flamenco is not synonymous with Spanish dance, but it is a key element. It has 
also successfully supported imaginative transformations to the dramatic stage 
almost since its beginning. 
</P>
<P>
None of this was made very apparent Sunday afternoon at the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium by the Teatro de Danza Espanola, a young-looking -- and -dancing -- 
troupe making its first U.S. tour. The company boasts a flamenco cadre that 
would do many a Seville or Madrid tablao proud, but it did not provide a basis 
for any coherent choreography or dramatic extension. 
</P>
<P>
Company director Luisillo's "La Trilla" provided a pseudo-folkloric pageant as 
a setting for big solo efforts from Juan Fernandez and Maria Vivo. Despite the 
scenery and profusion of agricultural props, this scene of workers in an 
Andalusian field -- the women, of course, in heels and their best ruffled 
skirts -- was hardly plausible as either a social or dramatic context. 
</P>
<P>
The individual dancing, however, proved eminently credible. Fernandez, despite 
a superficial resemblance to John Travolta and despite his adoption of some 
disco poses, moved with supple authority and maintained a crisp, cool fury in 
his intricately patterned heel work. 
</P>
<P>
Vivo emphasized exaggerated sensuality through sinuous, seemingly boneless arms 
and bump-and-grind torso work. Her solo developed increasingly abandoned 
variations, with the rhythm of her heel work buried by the accompanying 
hand-clapping. 
</P>
<P>
Elaborate palmoteo, indeed, was the central element of the accompaniment, led 
by singers Toni Maya and Cancanilla de Marbella, who also contributed clowning 
dance parodies. This was raucous, spirited, punk flamenco nuevo, greeted with 
cheers from the audience and continued in the exuberant encores. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the program was devoted to Luisillo's "Carmen," set to the 
music of Bizet -- taped, of course -- as reordered and recomposed by Rodion 
Shchedrin for his wife, Maya Plisetskaya, in 1968. The poverty of imagination 
and lack of self-confidence and identity apparent in choosing a Soviet 
arrangement of a French operatic view of Spanish life was reflected in the 
cluttered choreography, which made no effort to establish character or 
motivation and covered important solo entrances and duets with chorus line 
kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
Rocio Acosta brought a measure of paradoxically flamboyant dignity to the title 
role, dancing with technical assurance in the tawdry surroundings. Though 
billed as a principal ballet dancer, her part called more for modern dance 
movement and flamenco poses, plus a loud cry and gasps to initiate her extended 
death throes. 
</P>
<P>
Her partner as Don Jose was not the similarly billed Miguel Valeran, but 
Florencio Campo. He provided little more than an heroically out-thrust chest 
for characterization. In a sad reflection on his ease in the role and the 
confused choreography, it was impossible to tell whether he was supposed to 
collapse under Carmen at the end, or simply overbalanced attempting to carry 
her away. 
</P>
<P>
Vigorous dancing of varying skill in the supporting roles and ensembles did not 
redeem the effort.
