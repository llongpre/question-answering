<P>
For more than 100 years they have been coming to California and herding sheep, 
working interminable hours, rarely taking days off, enduring months of 
isolation in tents or primitive trailers. 
</P>
<P>
It was a job few Americans wanted. But for the young men in the mountainous 
Basque regions of Spain and France, shepherding was a way to parlay a few years 
of hard work into a better life. 
</P>
<P>
The Basques quickly developed an enduring reputation as the finest sheepmen in 
the American West. Basque shepherds had an uncanny ability to find the richest 
pastures, sheepmen said, rarely lost lambs to predators, and their ewes 
routinely had the most offspring. 
</P>
<P>
But during the 1970s, because of improved economic conditions in the Basque 
countries, immigration to America almost ceased. Sheepmen, once assured of a 
steady stream of young Basque men, were faced with a shepherd shortage. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden things changed, and people in the sheep business couldn't find 
any shepherds," said Frank Iturriria, president of the Kern County Wool Growers 
Assn., who started as a shepherd when he immigrated to America 28 years ago. 
"Some people had to get out of the sheep business. Others switched over to 
cattle." 
</P>
<P>
The sheepmen eventually developed contacts in South America and began bringing 
in shepherds from Peru and Chile who were able to stay three years as guest 
workers and then return home. But for California's Basques, a way of life was 
unalterably transformed. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty years ago, 95% of the shepherds in Kern County -- the largest sheep 
county in the state -- were Basque, Iturriria said. Today, fewer than 10% are 
Basque, mostly aging men who have worked as shepherds for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The sheepmen lament the end of a tradition, the changing order of their 
business. Most young Basque men came to the United States with a few dollars in 
their pockets, worked as shepherds for a few years, received their pay in ewes 
and slowly amassed their own herds. 
</P>
<P>
In Kern County today, every large sheep ranch except one is owned by a Basque, 
and most of the owners began as sheepherders. But as they retire, young Basque 
men are not taking their places, and they fear that the tradition of the Basque 
sheepman will end. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm 44 and I'm the youngest sheepman in Kern County," said Frank Iturriria's 
brother, Antero, who also started as a shepherd. "The second generation of 
Basques in America don't want to go into the business. They want to be 
professional people. And the young Basques are staying home. What happens when 
I leave the business? Who will take my place?" 
</P>
<P>
At the edge of a pale-green alfalfa field speckled with hundreds of ewes and 
their newborn lambs wobbling about on unsteady legs, Elias Aleman mended a wire 
fence. It is the end of the winter lambing season in Kern County, and Aleman 
has to protect his sheep from speeding cars, a danger his flock never faced in 
the small Spanish town in the Pyrenees s where he was raised. 
</P>
<P>
"In my home village, there were no cars. . . . There weren't even many 
bicycles," he said in Basque, smiling shyly, as his employer, Frank Iturriria, 
interpreted. 
</P>
<P>
Because his hometown was so small -- about 300 people -- and isolated, Aleman 
said, there was little opportunity. But a Bakersfield sheepman visiting 
relatives in the Pyrenees offered him a job. So, at the age of 22, like most 
young men in his village, he moved to America. 
</P>
<P>
For 21 years Aleman has lived the lonely, nomadic life of a California 
shepherd. After the winter lambing, Aleman spends April and May in the Mojave 
Desert, watching his flock during spring grazing. He spends his summers on the 
mile-high meadows of the Owens Valley on the slopes of the Sierra. In the fall, 
he returns to the Kern County foothills. 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Aleman and the other shepherds lived in tents and followed their 
flocks' peregrinations by foot over the century-old California Sheep Trail. It 
was one of the longest annual animal drives in the nation -- 400 miles over the 
Tehachapis to Mojave, up past Lone Pine and Bishop to the high mountain summer 
meadows of the Sierra and then back to Kern County. Now, the sheep are trucked 
to the seasonal grazing spots, and Aleman follows, pulling a battered trailer. 
</P>
<P>
But it is still a hard life, a life that young Basque men no longer are willing 
to endure, Aleman said. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young, this was our only opportunity," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Aleman stooped over and picked a strip of foxtail grass. All was silent except 
for the ringing bell from a running ewe and the bleating of newborn lambs. 
"Today, in my home village, they all have cars now and can commute to 
factories. They no longer have to live this life." 
</P>
<P>
When the young men stopped coming to America, Basque neighborhoods in many 
California towns faced extinction. But Bakersfield's Basques have endured, and 
they have held onto a few remnants of their community. Basques are still 
scattered throughout the sheep-growing regions of the San Joaquin Valley, but 
the Bakersfield area has the largest community, with about 6,000 people of 
Basque descent. 
</P>
<P>
Like most Basque neighborhoods, Bakersfield's was founded near a railroad 
station. For generations, shepherds speaking no English arrived on the train, 
clutching scraps of paper bearing their destination, and walked to Basque 
boarding houses nearby and waited for sheepmen to give them work. 
</P>
<P>
The blocks around the Bakersfield Southern Pacific Railway station were once 
filled with Basque boarding houses and hotels, Basque restaurants, social halls 
and bakeries. Today, the Basque neighborhood is barely discernible. All that is 
left are a few aging restaurants, hotels and a bakery in an industrial section 
of town hard by the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Handball and Card Games 
</P>
<P>
But on Sunday the neighborhood is revived. After church, Basques line up 
outside the Pyrenees Bakery for the thick-crust, sourdough "shepherds loaf" for 
their Sunday meal. Others gather at the Basque Club for a game of pelota 
(Basque handball) or a card game called mus. By late afternoon, the bar at the 
Noriega Hotel is filled with sheepmen and the descendants of sheepmen drinking 
Picon punch, a heady blend of brandy, grenadine, soda and Amer Picon aperitif. 
</P>
<P>
The Noriega Hotel, a rooming house built in 1893, is the traditional center of 
Bakersfield's Basque community. A generation ago, it was filled with young men 
just off the train looking for work or shepherds spending their brief vacation 
in town. The rooming house provided three meals a day and free storage space 
while the shepherds were on the range. 
</P>
<P>
Many young Basque girls obtained their first jobs in America at the Noriega, 
and the hotel was the site of many marriages between chambermaids and visiting 
shepherds. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel still has eight boarders, including three retired Basque shepherds 
who now work as gardeners, said the current owner, Janize Elizalde. And the 
hotel still serves a traditional Basque meal at 7 p.m. sharp as boarders and 
visitors sit side by side at long wooden tables. The dim dining room and the 
ancient bar with a 
</P>
<P>
linoleum floor and creaky overhead fans provide a Spartan decor. 
</P>
<P>
Basque meals are famous for their plentitude, and no one ever walked away from 
Noriega's hungry. A recent meal included vegetable soup, Basque beans, pickled 
tongue, salad and Pyrenees bread for starters. The entrees were prime rib and 
lamb stew, served with heaping platters of French fries, spaghetti, cottage 
cheese and green beans. Dessert included large chunks of bleu cheese, followed 
by ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's and the seven other traditional Basque restaurants in the area 
attract tour groups and gourmands from throughout California. One of the 
Basques' greatest accomplishments is that they have managed to transform 
Bakersfield -- not considered one of California's cosmopolitan centers -- into 
a city known for its cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
The tradition of the Basque sheepman in America began during the Gold Rush. But 
these first sheepmen were not from the Basque homeland; they were South 
American cattle ranchers of Basque descent who had decided to try their hand at 
gold mining. 
</P>
<P>
A few discovered that because of the great demand for fresh meat in the mining 
camps and the plentiful rangeland, they could make more money raising sheep 
than panning for gold. These Basques attracted other Basques, relatives and 
friends from the home villages in Spain and France, and soon there was a steady 
flow of shepherds to the sheep-growing regions of California, Nevada and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
Basques are proud of their heritage and boast of having the oldest surviving 
culture in Europe. Although their homeland straddles the mountains between 
Spain and France, they do not consider themselves to be part of either country. 
They inhabited the Pyrenees long before Spain and France became nations. 
</P>
<P>
But opportunity was limited in the remote mountain villages, and by the turn of 
the century, Basques were pouring into the United States. They quickly adapted 
to the hard life of sheepherding and proved themselves "natural sheepmen," said 
Martin Etchamendy, a Kern County sheep ranch owner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Early Start 
</P>
<P>
"Basques have an ability around sheep we haven't found with any other people," 
said Etchamendy, who worked as a shepherd when he immigrated to America 27 
years ago. "For centuries, people have been raising sheep in the Pyrenees. 
Although not all Basques were shepherds in the old country, most had some sheep 
on their family farms. Ever since we were 4 or 5 years old we have been caring 
for the sheep, herding them, helping make cheese from their milk. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We adapted to the loneliness of sheepherding better than a lot of people 
because most of us are from very small villages with few neighbors. We grew up 
with the isolation." 
</P>
<P>
Etchamendy drove his pickup to a grazing field north of Bakersfield where his 
"No. 1 shepherd," Juan Maya, watched the flock. Maya, who looked like a figure 
from Biblical times, stood motionless for minutes, hunched over a wooden Basque 
shepherd's crook called a makila, silhouetted against the dying rays of the 
late afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been around sheep ever since he was born," Etchamendy said, flicking his 
head toward Maya, 61, who continued to stand motionless in the distance. "He is 
a man who really knows the character of sheep. Nobody has an eye like him." 
</P>
<P>
Maya knows how to quickly tie together the rear legs of twins so that the 
mother gets the smell of both and realizes she must nurse two instead of one. 
He knows how to match a twin whose mother does not have enough milk for two 
with an ewe who has lost a lamb after birth. He is an expert at skinning the 
dead lamb and placing the pelt over the back of the twin so that the ewe is 
fooled into thinking the lamb is her own. 
</P>
<P>
These are arcane skills that Basque shepherds take pride in but few Americans 
care to learn. Although Americans have mythologized every aspect of cattle 
ranching, few have paid any attention to the travails of the sheepman, said 
Larry Garro, director of the Western Range Assn., which locates foreign 
shepherds for local ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
That is why, for more than a century, the United States has imported its 
sheepmen. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody in America wants to be a cowboy," Garro said. "But nobody wants to 
be a shepherd."
