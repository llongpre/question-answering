   An Israeli girl hiking in the West Bank with
friends was likely killed by a bullet fired from the rifle of
another Jewish settler, not from a stone flung by an Arab as
previously reported, Israeli media said.
   The reports, citing an army probe, raised the possibility that
one of the two settlers guarding the hikers inadvertently shot
15-year-old Tirza Porat during a clash with Arabs in the village of
Beita on Wednesday.
   The army said it had not determined the exact cause of the
girl's death, which prompted calls for revenge from settlers and
led the army to blow up 13 homes in Beita belonging to Arabs
allegedly involved in the clash.

   Back home after logging 16,000 miles in a
failed effort to get Arabs and Israelis to agree to negotiations,
Secretary of State George P. Shultz says he won't be deterred from
trying again.
   Their reluctance to sign on to a two-stage U.S. proposal for
negotiations, means one deadline has passed and another almost
certainly will go by the boards.
   The first was Shultz's call for a reply by mid-March. Israel and
Jordan, the two key parties, did not turn him down. But they also
did not agree to the talks.
   The second deadline was mid-April, the target date for an
international peace conference. That obviously will not happen,
Shultz said Friday at his last stop in Amman, Jordan.

   Jimmy Swaggart and the nation's largest
Pentecostal denomination walked away from each other after the
church said it was defrocking him for rejecting its punishment for
``moral failure.''
   Swaggart on Friday announced his resignation from the Assemblies
of God shortly after the church said it was ousting him for
refusing to undergo a year's suspension from the pulpit and at
least two years of rehabilitation.
   The punishment was ordered after Swaggart confessed publicly to
unspecified sins. Though never proven but also never disputed, it
was widely reported that Swaggart had committed lewd acts with a
New Orleans prostitute.

   Former White House political director Lyn
Nofziger expects his conviction and 90-day prison sentence for
illegal lobbying to be reversed, saying the prosecutor made
``mountains out of molehills'' and lied.
   ``I am an honorable man,'' Nofziger told U.S. District Judge
Thomas A. Flannery, who also fined him $30,000 on Friday. ``Like
other honorable people, I have gone through life making mistakes,
doing stupid things. ... But I am not a criminal.''
   He said independent counsel James C. McKay was ``not an
honorable man.''.
   Nofziger, a longtime associate of President Reagan, shook hands
with friends and kissed his wife and other family members after the
sentence was pronounced.

   President Reagan has turned out a
winner in the tax-reform law he championed, making more money and
paying less tax last year than he did in 1986.
   The White House on Friday released copies of federal tax return
filed by Reagan and his wife, Nancy. It showed their tax liability
for 1987 was $86,638, or 25.1 percent of their $345,359 gross
income.
   In 1986, their tax bill had been $92,460 on a total income of
$336,640, or 27.5 percent.

   A panhandler who used a dying 3-year-old girl
and her brother to win sympathy has been charged in her beating
death, and police appealed for further help from the passerby who
tried to save her life.
   Benito Sanches, 36, a ``crack'' cocaine addict who came to
America in the 1980 Cuban boat lift, was charged Friday with
second-degree murder in the death of his girlfriend's daughter,
Maya Figueroa, police said.
   She was the second toddler in two weeks to die a violent death
at the city's biggest welfare hotel, The Prince George Hotel.
