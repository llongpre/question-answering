FT  05 JAN 94 / Peasant army embarrasses Mexico: The insurrection in Chiapas
may alter government policy

The attack by up to a thousand armed peasants on four Mexican towns in the
southern state of Chiapas presents the government of President Carlos
Salinas with an acute political problem.
Despite the negligible military threat from the rebels, who were last night
reported to be retreating, the uprising comes at a time when the government
is keen to project Mexico as a peaceful and stable country ready to become a
member of the first world of rich nations. The insurrection offers a very
different image, and underscores the social and political difficulties ahead
as Mexico joins the North American Free Trade Agreement.
The troubles coincide with the beginning of the campaign to elect Mr
Salinas's successor this August. If the violence continues, Mr Luis Donaldo
Colosio, the ruling Institutional Revolutionary party's candidate, may have
to go further in making social development rather than economic reform the
key element of his political platform.
The uprising has already led to nearly 90 deaths, and countless more victims
have been wounded. The rebels have ceded control of three of the four towns
seized on New Year's Day - San Cristobal, Las Margaritas and Ococingo -
while reporters visiting Altamirano, which had been held until early
yesterday, said they saw no sign of them.
Known as the Zapatista Army of National Liberation, the guerrillas declared
war on the government on behalf of the country's indigenous people. They
said they timed the New Year's Day insurrection to coincide with the formal
enactment of Nafta, a treaty they said would be a death sentence for
natives.
Their fight was for 'work, land, housing, food, health care, education,
independence, freedom, democracy, justice and peace'. Most of the rebels are
poor Maya natives from the region, although some of the leaders are reported
to be from the centre of the country. They appear well-financed and
organised, suggesting perhaps links with drug or arms smugglers. The
government quickly painted them as radical groups with little popular base
or support, and bent on violence at no cost. An official said they were
supported by Guatemalan guerrillas and other Central Americans, and had ties
to the leftist clergy in the state.
However, government critics see the violence as the product of the extreme
poverty and repression afflicting Chiapas for centuries. It is by some
measures Mexico's poorest state, with lowest levels of installed
electricity, literacy and school attendance rates in the country. The state
is dominated by political bosses who belong to the PRI, and has one of the
worst records of human rights abuses by the police and army. Disputes over
land have turned into violent clashes between poor peasants and the rich
landowners who control the economy of the state.
Last year the Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights, an independent US
organisation, accused Mexico's military of torturing indigenous peoples in
the state. Other reports by Amnesty International and Americas Watch have
catalogued similar abuses.
The Minnesota report concluded: 'The lawless practices of the Mexican
military have been increasingly tolerated at the highest levels of Mexican
government.' The charges were denied by the government-controlled Human
Rights Commission, but have long been made by the local Catholic Church,
which actively supports the rights of natives.
While Mr Salinas's economic reforms have made many Mexicans better off, they
have yet to improve the lot of the rural poor, most of whom are found in
southern states such as Chiapas. According to the government statistics
institute and the United Nations, the number of people living in extreme
poverty in rural areas increased from 6.7m in 1984 to 8.4m in 1989 and 8.8m
in 1992.
During the past four years the government has poured billions of dollars
into the Solidarity anti-poverty programme, of which Chiapas has been the
biggest recipient. However, this programme has not been able to offset the
impact of the removal of agricultural and other subsidies, and the decline
in prices of products such as coffee.
The opposition to Nafta reflects a widely held view that the south of Mexico
is unlikely to benefit as much as the north or the centre. Many Chiapas
workers live off corn they produce, or on coffee farms. Under Nafta, Mexico
will gradually open up to corn imports, and demand for farm labour is
expected by most economists to fall sharply.
The government's immediate response to such problems is to pour more money
into the state. The social development minister said on Monday the
government would establish new programmes to address the problems of the
region. It remains to be seen whether such spending will be sufficient, or
if a broader political solution to the rights of indigenous peoples is
necessary.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
                              CHIAPAS STATE
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
It is one of Mexico's least-developed and most violence-prone
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
It has only 4 per cent of the nation's population but 25 per cent of
its land disputes
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
About 30 per cent of its 3.2m residents are illiterate; one in four
speaks an indigenous language but not Spanish
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
About 20 per cent of children do not attend school, partly because not
enough teachers speak both Spanish and indigenous languages; roads are
scarce and bad
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The state has been made even poorer and less stable by thousands of
undocumented central American refugees trying to reach the US
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Success in winning converts by both Roman Catholics and Protestants,
the latter of whom were encouraged by the authorities in the 1940s to
counter Catholic power, has exacerbated tensions: village leaders have
expelled thousands of converts, accusing them of undermining Mayan
traditions
