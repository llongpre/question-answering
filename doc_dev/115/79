   The government has recovered more gold, jade
and stone artifacts that were stolen from the National Museum of
Archaeology in a daring Christmas Day robbery in 1985, an official
said.
   Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo said one of the 19
pieces of jewelry found Friday was among the most important of all
the stolen items.
   Authorities recovered 111 items last weekend. On Wednesday
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari presided over a ceremony
returning them to the museum.
   The artifacts date from 500 B.C. to 2500 B.C. and include masks
and jewelry from Mexico's ancient Aztec, Mixteca, Maya and Zapotec
civilizations. About 25 items still are missing.
   Federal agents in Mexico City followed one man, Carlos Perches
Trevino, 24, for 45 days before his arrest on June 9, Alvarez said
earlier this week. He said officials were seeking another man,
identified as Ramon Sardina Garcia.
   Sardina left a box of tools at the home of a friend, Maria
Antonieta Ponce Mercado, who became suspicious after learning of the
man's alleged involvement in the museum robbery and told her uncle,
Alvarez said. The uncle contacted the attorney general's office on
Friday.
   Alvarez said federal agents and museum officials went to Ms.
Ponce's house in a Mexico City suburb and found 19 pieces of jewelry
in the box.
   ``Among what we found was one of the five most important missing
pieces, a figure of a Mayan governor,'' he said Friday night.
   Alvarez said earlier this week that Perches and Sardina had
staked out the museum for six months. The pair then jumped the
fence, crawled in through an air conditioning duct and looted seven
display cases, he said.
   The attorney general said the men kept the artifacts for more
than a year, then exchanged some for drugs.
