STOLEN CONTINENTS: THE INDIAN STORY by Roland Wright John Murray Pounds
19.95, 424 pages
'FOR FIVE centuries,' writes Roland Wright, 'we have listened only to the
history of the winners.' Stolen Continents redresses the balance by
portraying the European 'discovery' of the continents of North and South
America from a 'native' perspective.
In selecting the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, Iroquois and Cherokee, he has focused
on the most complex societies for whom the greatest source material is
available. 'The five I have chosen must therefore stand for the many who
will never tell their stories because they are extinct. The silence of the
Caribbean Taino, the Newfoundland Beothuk, and the Ona of Tierra del Fuego
is the most terrible eloquence of all.'
Wright portrays the history of these five groupings during three phases:
invasion, resistance, rebirth. The book is timely, not just because this
year marks the 500th anniversary of Columbus's first voyage across the
Atlantic, but because Wright follows the story through to the vociferous
nationalism of today.
His account is passionate and moving. Through reconstruction of wide-ranging
primary sources the reader can relive the agonies of the original
inhabitants at the hands of the invaders. But whereas we may be accustomed
to the devrecounted in the sixteenth-century Florentine Code, the continued
persecution of the indigenous population comes as a surprise. The memoirs of
the Guatemalan Mayan activist Rigoberta Menchu, written in 1982, are so
horrific that Wright admits some people may not believe that such horrors
really happened.
Wright sees the superior European attitude towards the 'primitive' natives
as almost laughable were the consequences not so tragic. The 'Requirement'
read by the sixteenth-century Spaniards to the local people at each
encounter demanded they submit to God, the Pope and the Church. 'And if you
do not do this . . . with the help of God I shall come mightily against you,
and I shall make war on you everywhere . . . and I shall do all the evil and
damage to you that I am able. And insist that the deaths and destruction
that result from this will be your fault.' This 'shabby document', as Wright
points out, was a symbolic necessity to justify outright plunder. The
Indians understood neither its meaning nor its intent.
Apologists for the European 'invasion' rightly point out that what decimated
the local people was not so much warfare but European diseases. But Wright
stresses the consequences of Lord Jeffrey Amherst's command against the
Iroquois in 1762. 'Infect the Indians with sheets upon which smallpox
patients have been lying or by any other means which may serve to
exterminate this accursed race.' The epidemic raged all summer, says Wright.
'One by one the leaders who survived it were compelled to sue for peace.'
Whether he is talking about the Incas, Aztecs, Mayas, of South and
Mesoamerica, or the Cherokee and Iroquois of North America, the 'Indian
story' is a tawdry one of misunderstanding and betrayal. Time and again the
new arrivals in North America reneged on their treaty obligations with the
original inhabitants who had once made them welcome.
There never was any expectation that the 'white' and 'Indian' cultures might
coexist. Thousands of books of Mayan hieroglyphs were destroyed because the
Spaniards could not understand them. When finally the remaining few were
deciphered, they revealed advanced astronomical information. In their
attempt to eradicate the Inca culture, the Spaniards banned Ouecha song,
music and theatre. Even well-meant reforms backfired.
Although the title of the book indicates that the continents of North and
South America have been 'stolen' from their pre-Columbian inhabitants, the
reader is left in no doubt that 500 years later the 'theft' is still being
contested by those who have not lost sight of their ancient culture or
language. 'If Guatemala really had majority rule, it would be a Maya
republic,' says Wright. In the Andes 12m people speak the Inca language.
There are more Iroquois living in North America than there have been for
three and a half centuries. And the eastern Cherokees have managed to remain
in the Great Smoky mountains where they lived in pre-Columbian times.
