   Bryant Gumbel and Willard Scott sought to patch
things up on a special ``Today'' show hookup, but the critical
co-host balked at reciting the weatherman's pledge against computer
memo writing.
   Tuesday's on-air conversation followed a botched effort Monday to
reach the vacationing Scott in Florida. ``I hung up on you,'' Scott
joked about the previous day's technical snags.
   Scott, who had threatened to leave unless Gumbel apologized for
his in-house memo criticizing Scott and other staff members, then
told the co-host to raise his right hand and recite after him.
   Gumbel raised his left hand.
   Scott: ``I, Bryant Gumbel...''
   Gumbel: ``I, Bryant Gumbel...''
   Scott: ``...will promise...''
   Gumbel: ``...will promise...''
   Scott: ``...to never write another memo and leave it in the
computer again.''
   Gumbel: ``...but I can't write in longhand.''
   The session concluded with Gumbel and co-host Jane Pauley wishing
Scott, who turned 55 on Tuesday, a happy birthday and a good
vacation.

   Actor Ben Vereen, columnist Ann Landers and
country singer Tammy Wynette were honored for their efforts to
educate the public about mental illness and addiction.
   ``I'm not proud of the fact that I once had a drug problem, but I
am proud I did something about it,'' Ms. Wynette, who overcame
dependency on prescription drugs, said Tuesday at an awards
reception on Capitol Hill.
   ``Let's be sympathetic, let's be kind, let's be caring and let's
recognize the burden these people who have mental illness are
carrying. I can't tell you how much pain, how much suffering is out
there,'' Ms. Landers urged.
   Vereen, a national spokesman for the campaign for ``A Drug Free
America,'' said parents and teachers must be educated to spot mental
illnesses such as depression that can lead to drug abuse, and then
reach out to those afflicted.
   He promised to continue the fight ``to free America from its
chains of drugs and mental illness.''
   The ``From Shame to Hope'' awards were co-sponsored by the Mental
Health Liaison Group, the Alcohol and Drug Problems Association of
North America and the Mental Illness Research Advocacy Coalition _
Learning and Educating.

   An Arizona company was inviting criticism when it
sent a sample of its windshield-cleaning product to ``60 Minutes''
commentator Andy Rooney, a lawyer for CBS has argued.
   Attorney Douglas Jacobs on Monday asked U.S. District Judge
Robert Broomfield to dismiss a $16 million suit filed against the
network and its newsmagazine show by Unelko, a Scottsdale-based
company. He said the suit attacks freedom of expression.
   Robert Cummins, a lawyer for Unelko, countered that the
Constitution does not protect the snide type of ``factual
disparagement'' made by Rooney during an April 17, 1988, broadcast
of ``60 Minutes.''
   ``Nobody invited Mr. Rooney to do anything,'' Cummins said.
``Twenty million folks heard CBS and Andy Rooney declare that Rain-X
doesn't work.''
   Rooney, who attended the hearing but did not testify, said on the
air he was receiving ``junk'' in the mail. He held up a bottle of
Rain-X, which is supposed to make rain or snow roll off auto
windshields, and said he'd tried the product and found it lacking in
the advertised qualities.
   ``They can't suppress an opinion just because it doesn't agree
with theirs,'' Jacobs said.
   Broomfield took the case under advisement.

   Spanish tenor Jose Carreras, resuming his
career full-time after overcoming leukemia, said he will sing an
entire opera this summer and begin filming a movie about Enrico
Caruso in the fall.
   ``I am ready to face this challenge as a real professional, not
as a miraculously healed person,'' the singer told a news conference
at Milan's La Scala Theater Tuesday.
   Carreras, who has performed a number of concerts since he began a
comeback last year, said he will sing in Luigi Cherubini's ``Medea''
in Merida, Spain, in July. He said it would be a good test for
tougher engagements later, including a world premiere of ``Cristobal
Colon,'' by Catalonian author Lleonard Balada, in September.
   Carreras, who fell ill nearly two years ago, made his
announcement hours after an emotional two-hour concert Monday night
in the prestigious Milan theater that drew ovations from a sold-out
crowd.
   ``Carreras proved he fully regained his voice,'' the daily
Corriere della Sera wrote under the headline ``The Triumph of
Carreras.''
   The singer said he will portray Caruso in a movie that will begin
filming in October in Sorrento, near Naples, where the legendary
tenor died in 1921.

   Javier Perez de Cuellar called for ``mutual
tolerance'' of the world's major faiths as the U.N.
secretary-general visited the site where Buddha was born more than
2,500 years ago.
   Perez de Cuellar on Tuesday toured the Lumbini Garden 125 miles
southwest of Katmandu and lit a butter-fed lamp at the Maya Devi
Temple in front of the ancient sculpture of Lord Buddha and his
mother, Maya Devi.
   ``The world community which in our time needs to preserve and
draw inspiration from its entire cultural heritage,'' he said. ``For
this, the mutual tolerance of the different major faiths is of
course a prerequisite.''
   The United Nations has been associated with a $60 million project
to establish a center of pilgrimage and meditation at the site.
