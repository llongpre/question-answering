<P>
First, teacher Maya Decker says she was falsely accused on a religious radio 
show of hypnotizing four students in her family life class at Corona del Mar 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
Next, some parents charged that condoms were passed out during one of her 
lectures for students to take home -- a charge that was denied by school 
officials, who interviewed students. 
</P>
<P>
Then, there was the condom demonstration. Decker used a banana. It got the 
attention of some parents, she admits, including the founder of a traditional 
values group who demanded that the school board discipline her. 
</P>
<P>
"Things really hit the fan. I've never heard the end of it," Decker said. "It 
became a red herring. I don't think the banana is a big problem, especially 
when people are dying of AIDS. If they want to feel victorious about getting 
the banana out of the classroom, great." 
</P>
<P>
For more than a year, Decker, 47, has been under fire by religious and 
conservative political groups who maintain that the family life class she has 
taught for eight years serves impressionable children "a philosophical agenda 
that destroys values and divides families." 
</P>
<P>
Her class also found its way into the school board campaign that culminated 
with Tuesday's election. Although Decker's name was not on the ballot, she 
clearly emerged a winner. 
</P>
<P>
She believes she was effectively vindicated when incumbents in the Newport-Mesa 
Unified School District board race defeated two challengers who wanted to 
overhaul the district's sex education program, including her family life class. 
</P>
<P>
"The board election was very important," Decker said after school one day last 
week, shortly before embarking on her usual five-mile hike to relax. "I wanted 
the community at large to say they supported the program, and they did." 
</P>
<P>
Family life, an optional course at Corona del Mar High School, has been taught 
for almost 20 years. Its comprehensive lesson plan now addresses personal 
relationships, dating, marriage, parenting, child development, human sexuality, 
contraception, abortion, abstinence and sexually transmitted diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Decker, who is president of the Orange County chapter of the American Civil 
Liberties Union and an active member and former head of the 700-member Newport 
Mesa Teachers Federation, claims her critics are ignorant about her class. She 
brings in a wide variety of guest speakers, including homosexuals, pro-choice 
and anti-abortion advocates, contraception experts, family law attorneys and 
married couples with babies. 
</P>
<P>
District officials say the course is designed to prepare high school students 
for adulthood and provide them with a broad range of information so they can 
make informed decisions and cope with today's world. 
</P>
<P>
To take Decker's class, students need permission from their parents, who can 
review course materials a week before school begins. About 70 students enroll 
in her two courses every semester. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel what I teach are survival skills -- relationship survival skills," said 
Decker, who has taught for 23 years, almost all of it in Room 246 at Corona del 
Mar. "I get positive feedback, extremely positive feedback from parents and 
students." 
</P>
<P>
There are exceptions, however. Some parents and members of the Committee to 
Restore Ethical and Traditional Education (CREATE), a traditional values group 
based in Costa Mesa, want her class replaced or revamped to teach abstinence 
and refusal techniques almost exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
CREATE's literature states that Decker's family life course, as well as other 
sex education classes in the district, shock or entice students "into the abyss 
of an 'anything goes' world of amoral social behavior." 
</P>
<P>
She's "an aberration of the system," said John Gustafson, a founder of CREATE. 
"They say to the students, 'I know you are going to have sex, here's the 
contraceptives, and you can get an abortion.' I bet Decker has not taught a 
refusal technique in her life." 
</P>
<P>
Gustafson earlier this year called on the school board to discipline Decker 
when a guest speaker from UC Irvine also used a banana in her class to 
demonstrate a condom. District administrators said the banana had to go. 
</P>
<P>
In the school board election, the group backed candidates Wendy Leece of Costa 
Mesa and Jo Ellen Allen of Corona del Mar, who called for an abstinence-based 
sex education program and a school board that was more responsive to parents' 
concerns. Both were defeated. 
</P>
<P>
CREATE and its followers began monitoring Decker's class last spring, using 
students and adult observers for three consecutive days. Some them did not have 
children in the class. 
</P>
<P>
Decker said the visits created "a three-ring-circus atmosphere" and she fought 
back by taping her lectures and inviting a Newport Mesa Federation of Teachers 
representative and an administrator into her classes. She said none of the 
observers confronted her face to face with their complaints. 
</P>
<P>
This week, the school board will take action to adopt a formal policy 
restricting the type of visits members of CREATE have sought. 
</P>
<P>
"They come in and pick the most titillating stuff and not the other information 
which is the bulk of the course," Decker said. "They read sinister intent into 
the most simple things. They have a narrow perspective that is not 
representative of the Christian community." 
</P>
<P>
CREATE's founder responded that outsiders have been turned away from her class 
and the district has not honored promises to turn over class material. 
</P>
<P>
"They are clearly ashamed of what's going on. If they were not ashamed, they 
would let people in. . . . We have not been disruptive," Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy surrounding Decker began last year when a student complained to 
his parents that four classmates had been hypnotized in her class as well as in 
a psychology class. 
</P>
<P>
The purported incident was recounted on a radio broadcast by Focus on the 
Family, a Pomona-based religious organization, in September, 1988. Included in 
the program was a reading of what was taught in the human sexuality sequence of 
Decker's course, which represents one of six units of course material. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't even talk about hypnosis in the class," Decker said. 
</P>
<P>
The students, Decker and Corona del Mar High School were not named on the show, 
said Paul Hetrick, vice president of Focus on the Family. 
</P>
<P>
The radio report was followed by the latest banana controversy, charges that 
Decker's class promotes homosexuality, questions about condoms being 
distributed, and demands by CREATE members and other parents that Decker drop 
certain topics from her class. 
</P>
<P>
Although she did not agree with the decision, the district removed a lecture on 
human sexual response. 
</P>
<P>
Decker, an avid bird-watcher and board member of the Audubon Society, hikes 
five miles almost every day in the countryside near her Laguna Niguel home. 
</P>
<P>
She is a theatergoer. Sometimes, she says, it reminds her of the controversy 
surrounding her. Last spring when CREATE followers were clamoring to get into 
her classroom, she saw the Arthur Miller play "The Crucible" at South Coast 
Repertory. 
</P>
<P>
The drama explores the infamous witch hunts that ravaged the Puritan community 
in Salem, Mass., during the last decade of the 17th Century. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange County is Salem, Mass., in 1692," Decker quipped.
