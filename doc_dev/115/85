   The first of a string of Central American
``peace parks'' intended to save critical wilderness areas and end
decades-old border disputes has been launched in Costa Rica and
Panama, officials said Wednesday.
   The park has been established in the misty mountains of the La
Amistad Biosphere Reserve, which includes the largest tract of
undisturbed cloud forest in Central America.
   The reserve straddles the border of Costa Rica and Panama. As
many as 40 percent of its plants and animals are found nowhere else
on Earth.
   So far, 115 fish species, 215 reptiles and amphibians and at
least 500 bird species have been found there.
   Similar parks are on the drawing board for a forest that
overlaps the border of Belize and Guatemala and for the Maya
Biosphere Reserve that includes parts of Mexico and Guatemala.
   A third is planned for an area along the Costa Rica-Nicaragua
border, said James Nations, director of the Latin American program
of Conservation International, a private environmental organization
in Washington, D.C.
   ``The idea is to defuse the border conflict by creating an
international peace park in an area that was formerly the haunt of
the Contras,'' said Nations.
   ``What we're doing is looking for regional solutions to regional
problems.''
   Central America has more different species of plants and animals
than any comparably sized region on Earth, according to
Conservation International. It is one-eighteenth the size of the
United States, but has just as many plant species and twice as many
vertebrates.
   Nations said Conservation International and the Organization of
American States have just completed a management plan for the Costa
Rican side of the peace park.
   The plan specifies steps that must be taken to protect the park,
including projects to improve the well-being of the park's
residents.
   ``If you allow those people to produce the income they need,
they won't need to move across the hillsides destroying the
tropical forests their lives depend on.''
   ``It is the first time the original residents of the region are
being treated as equals in deciding how land and resources will be
managed,'' said Hernan Seguro, a Bribri Indian and a representative
to the park's coordinating commission.
   The proposed peace park along the Guatemala-Belize border
exemplifies the importance of international cooperation in
preserving ecosystems, he said.
   The border is criss-crossed by the Chiquibul River, which begins
in Belize, runs through Guatemala and then dumps into Belize's San
Ignacio Valley, an agricultural area that supplies most of Belize's
food.
   ``What happens to that river when it's in Guatemala is vitally
important to Belize,'' he said. ``If you can get the two countries
talking to protect that forest, you've done something positive for
both countries.''
