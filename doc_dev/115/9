In 1988, La Jolla's Iturralde Gallery (then La Casa del Arte) showed a series 
of lithographs by Lucia Maya that were inspired by the extraordinarily prolific 
and passionate life of Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Maya's affinity for Kahlo's 
precise, naturalistic style of rendering and her symbolic, surreal imagery made 
the series as much a dialogue between kindred spirits as a homage to a 
legendary life. 
</P>
<P>
This month, an extensive selection of Maya's paintings, prints and drawings can 
be seen at the Centro Cultural Tijuana in a show titled "Umbral de las 
Transfiguraciones" (Threshold of Transfigurations). Though Kahlo's striking 
visage is nowhere to be found here, her pointed, poignant approach is present 
throughout. 
</P>
<P>
Maya, who was born on Catalina Island and now lives in Guadalajara, never 
musters the same blend of toughness and vulnerability that makes Kahlo's work 
so singularly intriguing. Her intent, though, differs substantially. The mood 
she consistently creates is less intimate and revealing than Kahlo's and, 
instead, feels like a melange of received styles: saccharine sweetness, Gothic 
horror and surreal poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Maya's debt to the heritage of surrealism runs the deepest, especially in her 
use of familiar forms such as the human heart, in disjunctive, startling 
contexts. The heart appears throughout her work -- as vital organ, container of 
the 
</P>
<P>
soul, the spirit, and source of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
In the drawing, "Epifania de la Tierra" (Epiphany of the Earth), hearts sprout 
from the soil like saplings yearning for the sun. On the horizon of this 
fertile field, uprooted trees soar into a sky charged with unrest. In the 
foreground, a young woman unearths one of the hearts to find a child's pair of 
legs attached. Her wide-eyed innocence mirrors our own before this bizarre 
vision of birth and tempestuous demise. 
</P>
<P>
Maya makes an analogy between the heart's arteries and a tree's branches in 
several images, part of a larger expression of her view of the affinity between 
human and organic realms. Two large, dynamic drawings of trees double as 
portraits of twisting torsos, rooted to the ground but with branches/arms 
reaching upward, striving for a higher reality. In "Madre Corazon" (Heart 
Mother), one of three delicate drawings on the theme of maternal, life-giving 
power, Maya substitutes a heart and healthy foliage for a woman's head and 
shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
The most profound use of the image of the heart appears in the painting, 
"Exodo" (Exodus), one of the quietest but most moving works in the show. A 
gray-haired man stands against a screen of tall, mist-enshrouded trees, his 
pale hazel eyes staring wistfully ahead. Beneath his arm he carries a small 
house, with a roof resembling a human heart and walls frayed into a web of 
ungrounded roots. A small patch of earth near him is stained red, indicating, 
perhaps, the site of the unrooting. "Exodo" illustrates in simple terms the 
adage that home is where the heart is, while also conveying a more complex and 
powerful portrait of loss, separation and exile. 
</P>
<P>
Maya layers seemingly incongruous emotional and physical states throughout her 
work, evoking images both provocative and unsettling. Often she wraps her 
female figures in white, cocoon-like shrouds, linking them to both nascent and 
decaying states. They lie immobile, in a permanent dream state, the favorite 
realm of the founders of surrealism. 
</P>
<P>
Death and life shadow each other closely here, two facets of the same evolving 
entity called existence. Their transfiguration from one into the other is 
rendered seamless in the painting, "Concepcion Inmaculada" (Immaculate 
Conception), where an auburn-maned woman and a similarly coiffed skeleton share 
a single white, billowing smock, bloated by the figure's pregnancy. The cycle 
of birth and death becomes truly circular here, part of a continuum played out 
at once by a single individual. 
</P>
<P>
Much of Maya's work is, indeed, rich with poetic possibilities, but much is 
also mired in a stiff sentimentality. Her languorous sirens and brooding lovers 
drip with melodrama, cheap and over-acted, and her tight, linear drawing style 
sometimes stiffens and becomes static and lifeless. Underlying all of her work, 
however, is the potent realization that life and death, love and loss, the 
human and the organic all nurture each other while deepening each others' 
mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
Lucia Maya's work can be seen at the Centro Cultural Tijuana (on Paseo de los 
Heroes) through Aug. 31. Also on view in a separate show, through Aug. 29, is a 
strong selection of prints on the theme of the Mexican revolution.
