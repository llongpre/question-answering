Guatemalan Indian leader Rigoberta Menchu, accepting the 1992 Nobel Peace
Prize yesterday, called for international help to end her country's
guerrilla war and eradicate human rights abuses, Reuter reports from Oslo.
Accepting the gold Nobel medal and a diploma at a ceremony at Oslo's City
Hall, she urged greater efforts to stamp out racism and discrimination
against all indigenous peoples.
Talks between left-wing Guatemalan guerrillas and the government of
President Jorge Serrano on ending a 30-year war in which perhaps 100,000
people have been killed have been deadlocked for months.
Ms Menchu, a Maya Indian, said other countries should bring pressure for a
joint accord on human rights as a first step towards peace in her country.
