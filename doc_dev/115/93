<F P=106> ["Paid Publicity" by the Permanent Commissions of </F>
Representatives of Guatemalan Refugees in Mexico (Comisiones 
Permanentes de Representatives de Refugiados Guatemaltecos en 
Mexico--CCPP) issued in May 1994 in Guatemala City] 
  [Text] The CCPP, in view of the government's 
noncompliance with the agreements signed on 8 October 1992, 
which permit the voluntary and dignified return of our brothers, 
would like to inform national and international public opinion: 
  First: 
  That we announce the return of our brother refugees from 
Mexico to the farm La Quetzal, La Libertad Muncipality, Peten 
Department, will take place on 27 June, according to the 
government and CCPP agreement. 
  In view of the government's lack of respect and 
irresponsibility in connection with the signed agreements, we 
hold the government responsible for any attack or incident 
against the personal safety of those returning as well as 
against those who offer their solidarity by accompanying them. 
  Second: 
  That the CCPP, always respecting what has been agreed, 
presented to the CEAR [Special Commission for Assistance to 
Repatriated People] on 14 April a plan of operation for the 
return of the refugees, thus complying with the agreements in 
which it is stated the refugees may return 60 days after the 
plan is presented, meaning in our case the return to Guatemala 
can legally take place after 15 June. 
  Third: 
  That one of the seven agreements dated 8 October establishes 
that the refugees may decide how, when, and where they will 
return. We have decided to return to El Peten, specifically to 
the farm "La Quetzal," which is private property, and an 
agreement has already been reached for its purchase from current 
owners. 
  To this avail CONAP [National Council for Publicity] has 
issued an opinion that at least 20 percent of this farm may be 
used for settling. Nevertheless, afterward, and to block our 
return, CONAP contradicted itself and has said it is illegal to 
settle in "El Quetzal," because it is a part of the Maya 
Environ. CONAP has always opposed our return, despite the fact 
they and several institutions have made studies indicating only 
80 percent of the farm lies within the environ and the number of 
families that will settle will not endanger forest conservation 
or the environment. 
  Fourth: 
  We call on the national and international community to speak 
up regarding this situation and demand the Guatemalan Government 
comply with the agreements signed on 8 October 1992, without 
further delays or pretexts. 
  Fifth: 
  We ask the verification board to issue the report requested 
on 24 March 1994. 
  Sixth: 
  Last, we summon the accompanying forum [foro de 
acompanamiento] to establish a permanent assembly to accompany 
the movement's return to El Peten, which, we repeat, will take 
place on 27 June. 
  [Issued] Guatemala City 
  [Dated] May 1994. 
  The return is a right of all Guatemalans, and it is 
essential 
to the national process of reconciliation. 
  Return is struggle, not resignation
