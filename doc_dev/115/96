Jose sat beside me wearing red and white pin-striped trousers and black
leather chaps. He had a long straight Mayan nose and dry black skin like
crumpled linen. On his head, at a slight angle, sat a straw boater.
He was taking the bus home from market, along with his wife and two young
daughters and a chicken in a cardboard box. They lived in Todos Santos
Cuchumatan, in the mountains of north-west Guatemala.
Jose was a Nam Indian, a true descendant of the ancient Maya yet, like his
village, his name was Spanish. The conquistadors had made the arduous trek
to Todos Santos even before a road was built to connect it to the outside
world.
The Spaniards converted the inhabitants to Roman Catholicism, gave them new
names and a distinctive local costume. Legend has it that the men of Todos
Santos were so taken by the finery worn by one particularly flamboyant
Spaniard that they all copied it.
Today, the villagers still make the straw hats by hand and a boy does not
properly become a man until he is allowed to wear the red shirt with its
brightly patterned cuffs and upturned collars.
The bus pulled out of Huehuetenango with a few nervous coughs and a loud
roar. I shared a seat built for two with Jose and his family. One of the
girls was allocated to me and she sat on my lap for the entire journey
staring silently up at my alien face.
As we approached a police checkpoint the conductor told everyone to crouch
on the floor. There were 20 or 50 people standing in the aisle and they all
obliged, the men gently laying down their machetes, the women heaving babies
on to nearby laps.
We made it through but at a second checkpoint we were stopped and a
policeman noticed the bus was illegally overloaded. A small fine was
negotiated and we were off again.
For anyone over 5ft 6in tall, the seats were horribly cramped - the bus had
been designed to carry American schoolchildren. Above the windscreen,
between a blaring tape deck and a picture of the Virgin Mary, a faded sign
warned: 'No Swearing, No Horseplay.'
After 20 minutes we ran out of road and started to climb a lush mountain,
rarely getting out of first gear and hardly topping walking pace. The
driver, a man in his 40s with sunglasses, a greasy quiff and a row of silver
teeth, handed over the wheel to his conductor so he could chat up a woman
passenger.
An hour later we reached the peak and pulled up at a lonely truck stop
10,000ft above sea level. The men filed off, loosened their chaps and
relieved themselves against the side of the bus.
They did not speak much. Spanish remains their second language and they
would smile and exchange pleasantries but little more.
After a light lunch of Coca-Cola and dried cakes we were back on the road
crossing a stark barren plain. We dropped into a steep valley.
We could see Todos Santos spread out below us when we heard another bus
behind, hooting and snarling as it tried to pass on the narrow dirt road.
Our driver refused to pull over even when he stopped to set down passengers.
The other driver jumped out of his cab and ran up to our bus, swinging a
machete, stamping his feet and howling obscenities.
Our driver pulled away, stopping on the next bend to let the other bus pass.
As it did so a young man stood in the doorway of the other vehicle, and
waved the machete. With a flash of steel he slashed one of our tyres and we
ground to another halt.
Todos Santos was a picture of peace and tranquillity. Around the whitewashed
colonial church half a dozen young men leant in doorways, talking in
whispers and coyly posing in their brilliant costumes. Families sat outside
their adobe huts weaving: women at the looms, children bundling up cotton
and men sewing little bags.
The villagers had set up a workers' co-operative and their tiny shop was
packed with colourful weavings, each with a tag showing the name of the
person who had made it.
Next day, I saw a funeral. Half a dozen small children were walking down the
main street in single file, each holding a peace lily and solemnly staring
ahead. Behind them a boy of about 14 supported the rough-hewn coffin of a
child across his shoulders as if he was carrying his own cross.
He was followed by a dozen women in dazzling red blouses and skirts. None
displayed any emotion. It was exquisite and heart-breaking.
There was just one restaurant in town which served the same meal of
scrambled eggs, black beans and tortillas for breakfast, lunch and dinner,
and a hostel with horse-hair beds in draughty rooms that got hellishly cold
at night. I lasted two days before I got back on that bus.
This time we broke down after just 45 minutes. A second bus took us back to
Huehuetenango where I found I had missed the connection east to Sacapulas
and would have to wait until morning.
Next day at 11am I was back on the road with another lunatic at the wheel
who hurled us around the winding mountain roads until after two hours we
shuddered to a halt when the transmission shaft snapped. I sat at the side
of the road dreaming of cold beer, watching a herd of oxen overtake us and
thinking that even by Guatemalan standards three breakdowns on the trot must
be considered pretty bad luck.
A United Nations truck pulled up but the driver refused to give us a ride so
we had to wait two hours for the next bus. When it came it was already
nearly full but the driver seemed so pleased to see a rival broken down that
he made sure everyone squeezed on.
By the time we reached the little crossroads town of Sacapulas at the foot
of the Cuchumatan mountains it was almost dusk. I had missed the last
connecting bus to the village of Nebaj and was looking for a cold drink when
a lorry driver offered me a lift.
He was leaving immediately so I clambered up the back of his open truck,
clinging to the edge as we thundered high into the hills. I turned and
through the swirling dust saw a warm golden sunset over the valley. I looked
down to find myself standing on a mountain of wooden crates filled with
beer.
