National Liberation Army, EZLN, in "the mountains of

  [Text] For the national weekly PROCESO, the national 
newspaper LA JORNADA, the national newspaper EL FINANCIERO, and 
the local newspaper TIEMPO of SLCL [expansion unknown]: 
  10 June 1994 
  Gentlemen: Run! Go tell the Mazahuas, the Amuzgos, the 
Tlapanecos, the Nahuatlacas, the Coras, the Huicholes, the 
Yaquis, the Mayos, the Tarahumaras, the Mixtecos, the Zapotecos, 
the Mayas of Yucatan, Campeche, and Quintana Roo, the Chontales 
of Tabasco, the Seris, the Triquis, the Kumiai, the Cucapa, the 
Paipai, the Cochimi, the Kiliwa, the Tequistlatecos, the Pame, 
the Chichimecos, the Otomis, the Mazatecos, the Matlatzincos, 
the Ocuiltecos, the Popoloca, the Ixcatecos, the Chochopopoloca, 
the Cuicatecos, the Chatinos, the Chinantecos, the Huaves, the 
Papagos, the Pimas, the Tepehuanos, the Guajiros, the Huastecos, 
the Chuj, the Jalaltecos, the Mixes, the Zoques, the Totonacos, 
the Kikapus, the Purepechas, and the O'Odham of Caborca! 
  May the members of the University Student Confederation and 
all the groups know about it! May it reach the ears of workers 
and landless peasants! Tell those from the Barzon, the 
housewives, the settlers, the teachers, and students! 
  May the Mexicans abroad hear this message! May the bankers 
and the dinosaurs of Atlacomulco hear it! May it resound in the 
halls of the stock exchange and in the gardens of Los Pinos! 
May this voice reach the Mapuches and the authentic Farabundos! 
May all the brothers of these lands open a place in their 
hearts for this shout! May the drums and the teletypes start 
beating! May the satellites start going crazy! 
  What? You want to know what the message is? It is only one 
message: The Zapatists. Stop. [preceding word in English] Do not 
surrender! Stop. [preceding word in English] They resist! Stop 
[preceding word in English] and end of message. 
  From the mountains of southeastern Mexico 
  Rebel Subcommander Marcos 
  Mexico, June 1994 
  P.S. of imprudence: 
  We were advised to be prudent and to sign the peace 
agreement; we are told that if we do not sign the peace 
agreement, the government could finish us off in a matter of 
hours or days if it is delayed. We are advised to settle for the 
promises offered to us and to wait. We are told to have the 
prudence to surrender and live.... Who could live with that 
embarrassment? Who could trade life for dignity? Such sensible 
advice was useless because imprudence.... and dignity have 
reigned in these lands for many years. 
  P.S.: We were holding discussions in the committee all 
afternoon. We looked up the word for "surrender" in the Indian 
language, and we could not find it. There is no translation for 
it in Tzotzil or Tzetal. No one remembers seeing that word in 
Tojolabal or in Chol. They have been looking for hours for an 
equivalent word. It is raining outside, and a friendly cloud 
comes to lie down with us. Old Antonio is waiting for everyone 
to shut up until only the beating of the rain on the roof is 
heard. Old Antonio silently comes to me, coughing from his 
tuberculosis, and tells me in my ear: "That word does not exist 
in real language. That is why our people never surrender and 
prefer to die because our dead people believe that words that do 
not move should not be lived [nuestros muertos mandan que las 
palabras que no andan no se vivan]." Later, he walks toward the 
fireplace to scare off his fear and the early morning cold. I 
tell it to Ana Maria; she looks at me with tenderness and 
reminds me that old Antonio is already dead.... 
  The uncertainty of the last few hours in December 1993 
repeats itself. It is cold; the guards relieve one other with a 
whispering countersign. Rain and mud turn everything off. 
Humans whisper, and water shouts. Someone asks for a cigarette, 
and a lit match illuminates the face of the female fighter that 
is on duty.... It is only a slight instant.... but it is enough 
to see that she is smiling.... Someone arrives wearing a cap and 
carrying a rifle dripping with water. "There is some coffee," 
he says. The committee, as is the custom in these lands, 
decides to vote on whether to drink coffee or to continue 
looking for an equivalent of the word "surrender" in real 
language. Coffee wins unanimously. No one surrenders. 
  Are we going to be left alone?
