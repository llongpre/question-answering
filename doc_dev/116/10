<LEADPARA>  For people who ponder the merits of the pressurized flush vs. the gravity
flush, or people who calculate toilet efficiency in GPF (gallons per flush) to
the 10th degree, 1992 will be a very good year in San Jose.;   The city's
builders and residents will get a dose of toilet training next year. Some of
these measures were discussed at a council meeting Tuesday.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  IN '92, S.J. MAY BE FLUSH WITH WATER-SAVING TOILETS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     On Jan. 1, ultra-low-flush, or ULF, toilets will be required in all new
housing throughout the state. These next-generation models use only 1.6 GPF,
at high pressure, compared to 5 to 7 GPF for basic toilets, or 3.5 GPF for
some recent water-saving models, which also use the older, low-pressure,
gravity technology.;   Experts say a family of four switching from an old
toilet to ULF can save 60 gallons a day. That helps the city twice over: It
conserves water and it eases the South Bay's maxed-out sewage system.;   The
city probably will pass its own law in January with even stiffer standards,
mandating that the new-fangled toilets be installed whenever a bathroom is
remodeled.;   San Jose hopes to get 171,000 ULF toilets installed by 1996, at
a cost of nearly $13 million.;   The city council took one step toward toilet
consciousness Tuesday. It voted unanimously to draft the bathroom-remodeling
ordinance.  </TEXT>
