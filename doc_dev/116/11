<LEADPARA>  PICKLED or white-tone finishes for wood are difficult to achieve over existing
darker finishes.;    Q I want to refinish my kitchen cabinets with a pickled
finish. They are oak with a medium finish. I know I'll have to do some
sanding, but how much? What else do I need to do?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A The fashionable pickled finish, which is basically a white stain with a
protective coating, looks best and is simplest to apply on pale woods that
have not been previously finished. Pine, one of the palest woods, is ideal for
pickling. Oak can be pickled, but some oak is quite dark and might even need
bleached for best results. The previous finish and/or stain will have to be
completely removed by stripping or sanding, as it is important for the
pickling stain to fill pores and grain of the wood, which helps give pickled
wood its attractive tone.;    I suggest experimenting with a single cabinet
door, which can be removed for easier handling. If the process is too tedious
or the results aren't good, a simpler finish such as a light-tone enamel can
be used.;    Here's an outline of the procedure:;    Remove old finish with a
paint-varnish stripper, following all cautions and instructions on the
container, including use of eye and hand protection. To help remove old finish
from pores after the surface finish is removed, apply another coat of stripper
and go over the wood with a brass-bristle refinishing brush. Clean the surface
with mineral spirits (paint thinner) and sand.;    The basic pickling finish
can be flat white latex paint, thinned about one-third with water, or a
special pickling stain such as ZAR Country White. Brush the paint on a
workable area, such as a cabinet door or side. On light wood, wipe off the
paint almost immediately with rags, working across the grain so some paint
remains in pores. Waiting a short time before wiping can help lighten darker
wood, but the paint should not be allowed to overdry. Some refinishers
experiment on scraps to get the correct waiting time.;    When the paint
dries, sand lightly and remove dust with a sticky tack cloth or vacuum. Apply
two coats of a non-yellowing clear finish. One good choice is a water-based
protective finish, such as Carver Tripp's Safe &amp; Simple.;    Q I want to
replace an old toilet that uses 5 1/2 gallons of water per flush. The
plumbing-supply dealers in my area all sell toilets with 3 1/2-gallon tanks
only. Plumbers have told me the smaller tanks tend to block sewers. I feel the
more water the better, so where can I get a 5 1/2-gallon toilet?;    A Toilets
that use five gallons or more per flush have been virtually phased out because
they waste water. Most manufacturers began switching to 3 1/2-gallon tanks in
the late 1970s, but even those tanks are considered water wasters in some
areas. The new trend, especially in states such as California where water is
increasingly scarce, is toward ultra-low-flush toilets that use only about 1
1/2 gallons per flush. Compressed air is used in some low-water models to give
additional velocity to the water during a flush.;    It's true that some
plumbers are critical of water-saving toilets, but experience has shown that 3
1/2 gallons is generally more than adequate for flushing. Most homes have so
many other water-using fixtures and appliances, such as clothes washers and
dishwashers, that sewer lines are kept clear unless there are other factors
causing blocks, such as tree roots. At any rate, if you insist on a
five-gallon flusher, you might have to get it from a salvage yard.;    Q We
recently purchased an older log cabin with logs in sound condition. I'm
wondering if I should treat the logs to help prevent deterioration. I prefer
to keep the natural color. What, if anything, should I use?;    A Any
unpainted outdoor wood will benefit if it is treated periodically with a
water-repellent sealer, which will help prevent mildew, rotting, cracking and
warping. Many log-home manufacturers recommend using a stain or sealer with
water repellent on logs.  </TEXT>
