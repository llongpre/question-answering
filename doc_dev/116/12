   Hai Nguyen, a city mechanical engineer,
laughed self-consciously as he unrolled toilet paper while visitors
watched a test flush of the porcelain privy he had rigged.
   Nguyen pushed a button and a pressurized tank in the Water
Closet Inc. fixture discharged a shot of water into the toilet
bowl, which then emptied in nine seconds.
   ``This is the wave of the future,'' said an impressed R.J.
Martin, the city's chief plumbing inspector.
   Welcome to the city's toilet test lab, where the next generation
of high-tech toilets, which use a mere 1{ gallons per flush, are
being put through their paces. No commode can be sold until it has
passed the code.
   The Los Angeles lab's flush requirements are set by the American
National Standard Institute, which specifies that the toilet paper
field test, ``shall be comprised of an appropriate number of
six-sheet strips of single-ply roll toilet paper, each crumpled
into a loose ball measuring 2 to 3 inches in diameter.''
   Latex cylinders, ping-pong balls and other materials are also
specified by ANSI for certain tests. Another standard determines if
a toilet can rinse off a line drawn inside the rim with a
water-soluble marker.
   ``I think Los Angeles is one of the few _ if not the only _
municipality in the country with a test lab to make sure toilets
are in compliance,'' said James S. Nishimoto, whose mechanical
engineering division oversees the lab operated by the city
Department of Building and Safety.
   Within a stone's throw of the Los Angeles River, city engineers
at the laboratory ensure that toilets from designer thrones by Ifo
of Sweden to the American Standard models meet the same
requirements for flushing, scouring and rinsing.
   For some critics, the lab's certification of low-flush toilets
is taking too much time and hampering water conservation efforts in
a drought year.
   A new measure passed by the Los Angeles City Council in April
seeks to conserve water and ease the strain on the city's aging and
overwhelmed sewer system.
   Among other things, the measure requires installation of
``low-flush'' toilets for new construction. The toilets use just 1{
gallons per flush, compared to the usual 3 to 6 gallons.
   About 10 low-flush models have been developed, but only one has
been certified for use in Los Angeles, said lab manager Yogen R.
Thakar.
   ``It's just another example of a bureaucracy going around in
circles to me,'' said Larry Farwell, water conservation coordinator
for the Goleta Water District in Santa Barbara County.
   Certification is pending for the WCI unit, which was tested
recently, Thakar said. It takes from eight to 10 hours to test a
privy, but three to four months to certify each model. ``It's a
bureaucratic process,'' he explained.
   Critics also complain that the city's lab charges a minimum $500
to test each model, and $300 each year afterward to renew its
certification.
   ``It's totally unnecessary,'' said Tom Scheller of DEA Bathroom
Machineries, a plumbing importer and distributor based in Murphys,
Calif. ``The city is just using it as a means of generating
revenue.''
   The fees charged by the lab pay for most of its $600,000
operating budget, Nishimoto said. The lab also tests garden-hose
pesticide sprayers, commercial washing machines, dishwashers, ice
machines and just about anything else that is connected to the
city's potable water supply.
   ``I do feel that it serves an important function,'' Nishimoto
said. ``It's an area that's in public health, and I really don't
think any other lab gives it the same kind of attention that we
do.''
