<LEADPARA>  The Santa Clara Valley Water District signed onto a statewide urban
conservation plan Tuesday that, if widely observed, could save enough water
throughout California to meet the needs of 5 million people a year.;   The
plan, developed over the past two years by a coalition of water suppliers and
environmentalists, calls for urban water systems to be more efficient, outlaws
wasteful practices and promotes frugality.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But there's a catch. The State Water Conservation Coalition proposal is
strictly voluntary, carrying only the threat of embarrassment to ensure
compliance.;   "This is not a contract we're signing," Leo Cournoyer, the
district's water supply manager, told the district board.;   Water supply
agencies that sign the plan agree to develop conservation programs over the
next three years and to adhere to them until the year 2001.;   Called the
Urban Water Conservation Charter, the plan calls for such conservation
measures as installation of low-flow shower heads and ultra-low flush toilets.
It recommends leak-detection programs, indoor and outdoor water use audits,
and adoption of landscape water conservation ordinances.;   Those so-called
"best management practices" were worked out by the coalition, chaired by
Contra Costa County Supervisor Sunne McPeak and Ventura County Supervisor John
Flynn.;   The plan is being circulated among the major urban water agencies
for adoption and will be a recommendation to the State Water Resources Control
Board as a guide to setting state water policy. It is to go into effect Sept.
1.;   "Most (water) retailers are doing a great deal already," Cournoyer
said.;   The district board approved signing the agreement on a 5-0 vote, with
directors Joe Judge and Joe Pandit absent.;   The state board is establishing
water quality standards for San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento-San Joaquin
River Delta that will affect how much water can be diverted wisely for urban
use.;   Although the Santa Clara Valley Water District is a wholesaler, it
signed the plan as an umbrella agency for four of the county's retail water
suppliers -- the Great Oaks Water Co. and the city agencies of Morgan Hill,
Cupertino and Sunnyvale.;   San Jose Water Co., the largest in the county with
203,000 customers, endorsed the plan but did not sign it because some of the
elements would require it to seek approval from the California Public
Utilities Commission.;   The city of Gilroy declined to participate because
officials don't agree with all of the recommendations in the plan and consider
some of its provisions another layer of bureaucracy.;   Six other private and
municipal water suppliers in Santa Clara County have yet to act.;   What is
most remarkable about the plan is that it was negotiated among normally
competing interests -- Northern California vs. Southern California, water
agencies vs. environmental groups.;   The coalition said the plan can result
in saving 500,000 to 1 million acre-feet of water annually -- about the amount
consumed by 2.5 million to 5 million people.; Saving water; Here are some of
the "best management practices" in the Urban Water Conservation Charter. Some
already have been implemented in Santa Clara County in response to five years
of drought.; (box)City codes would be proposed requiring installation in new
homes of "ultra-low flush" toilets that use 1.6 gallons or less per flush,
compared to old-style toilets that use five gallons or more. Low-flow shower
heads and toilet tank dams would be distributed.; (box)Water suppliers would
encourage replacing toilets in existing homes and commercial and industrial
buildings with the new models, possibly by providing financial incentives or
seeking city ordinances requiring replacement on sale of the property.;
(box)Major water users would be audited to identify potential savings.
Conservation devices would be installed to reduce consumption.; (box)Water
suppliers would search aggressively for leaks and plug them.;
(box)Water-stingy landscaping guidelines would be adopted for commercial
projects and large multifamily housing complexes. There would be incentives
for single-family homeowners to install drought-resistant landscaping.;
(box)Gutter flooding and fountains that do not reuse water would be banned.;
(box)In cities that do not require water meters, such as Sacramento and
Fresno, all new hookups would be metered and plans would be adopted to
retrofit meters on existing homes.; (box)Pricing structures should give a
break to those who conserve and charge more to those who waste water.; Source:
