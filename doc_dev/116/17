   The phrase ``doggie do'' has a different
meaning for two sisters who make it their livelihood.
   Diane Fenger and Arlene Steinle train canine coiffeurs to handle
everything from American Kennel Club show styles to the occasional
doggie dye job.
   The words ``dog groomer'' are taboo at their Tara Lara Academy of
K-9 Hair Design because the sisters believe that's like saying the
Cordon Bleu turns out cooks.
   ``We aren't teaching basic dog grooming,'' said Fenger, who
founded the school 20 years ago with her sister. ``We are teaching
all-breed styling, including show work.''
   Fenger, a former hairdresser, traded permanents for pooches in
1968. The academy, highlighted in the sisters' book, ``The Standard
Book of Dog Grooming,'' draws students from around the country. The
school isn't cheap: $795 for a four-week groomer's assistant course,
up to $2,995 for a 16-week master course.
   Students scrub dogs in tubs, cut their hair and dry it with a
blow dryer or a heated cage dryer. The finishing touch includes
ribbons, scarves or bells. Fenger said she also teaches students how
to handle the dogs, including touching the animals in specific
places to control and relax them. She said properly handled dogs are
less likely to bite the hand that grooms them.

   Government handouts have come a long way since the
federal government doled out surplus cheese. In Massachusetts,
they're giving away toilets.
   This summer, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, hoping
to promote an ethic of water conservation, is handing out 2,500
low-flow toilets to communities for public use.
   The Municipal Toilet Replacement Program is designed with the
hope that after residents try the toilets at their town hall or
public library they will buy one for their home, said Jeffrey
Lissack, a spokesman for the program. The toilets cost the authority
$350,000.
   The authority needs to save water to continue adequately
supplying water to 2.5 million people in the Boston area.
   Toilets consume an average of 38 percent of household water.
Conventional toilets use 3.5 gallons to 7 gallons per flush; the
model being given away uses 1.6 gallons or less.
   Starting March 2, the state will require that all new toilets use
no more than 1.6 gallons of water per flush, which is expected to
save more than 3 million gallons of water daily.
