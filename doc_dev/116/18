<P>
As part of an effort to identify water-saving measures, the city of Oxnard is 
studying whether to make wasting water illegal and punishable by jail time and 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
In a report released this week, Public Works Director James Frandsen said the 
water-wasting practices covered by the proposed law could include over-watering 
lawns and hosing off driveways and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
Residents and businesses also could be penalized under the proposed law for 
maintaining fountains and carwashes that do not recycle water. 
</P>
<P>
Similar laws have been passed in Ventura and Camarillo, while several other 
cities in Ventura County have adopted voluntary water-conservation guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed law would be part of a water-conservation plan that the City 
Council is expected to consider in September, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The city is now offering residents free water-saving kits that include two 
shower flow devices and two dye tablets that detect leaks in toilet tanks. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard is also offering partial or full rebates to residents who exchange 
older, conventional toilets for new, ultra-low-flush models. 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard residents use an average of 160 gallons of water per person per day, one 
of the lowest per-capita rates in the county, according to the report. HUGO
