<DESCRIPT>  PALO-ALTO; RECYCLE; PROGRAM  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Old toilets never die. They just fade away into something else, at least in
Palo Alto.;   The city that already recycles just about everything has come up
with a program to recycle worn-out, obsolete commodes.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  PALO ALTO RECYCLES EVERYTHING, INCLUDING OLD
TOILETS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Rather than piling up at the city landfill, the old toilets will be hauled
away by a recycler, then crushed. The bits and pieces of porcelain later will
be mixed with asphalt to help form future highways and roads.;   "Yes, what
you once sat on, you could soon be driving on," quipped Debbie Katz, the
city's energy services manager.;   In all seriousness, though, the recycling
program does serve an important purpose: It means that old, water-wasting
toilets won't be resold and used again.;   It's all part of the city's new
water conservation incentives program. The effort also includes 50 percent
rebates to residents who replace old water-guzzling toilets with new ultra
low-flush models.;   The toilet rebate, which began this month, is the first
of its kind in the Bay Area, Katz said. Palo Alto officials hope the pilot
program, modeled after one in Santa Monica, will inspire other cities to
follow suit.;   Residents as well as owners of small businesses and
restaurants who switch to the ultra low-flush toilets after Oct. 1 can receive
a rebate for half the cost of the new toilet, up to $75.;   Ultra low-flush
toilets, some of which incorporate air to increase water pressure, use just
1.6 gallons of water per flush, compared with low-flush toilets that use about
3.5 gallons per flush and older toilets that can use 7 gallons or more.;  
"People may see 1.6 gallons and think, 'Gross! How's anything going to go
down,' " Katz said. "But these toilets are really efficient now.";  
Corporations also can benefit. Big businesses that replace their toilets or
modify cooling processes to save a minimum of 74,800 gallons of water a year
will be eligible for a minimum rebate of $100.;   If the incentives program
proves successful, it may be expanded later in the year to include ultra
low-flow shower heads, Katz said.;   City officials hope the new $150,000
incentives program will result in a savings of about 101 million gallons of
water a year, enough to serve about 310 average families for a year, Katz
said. One-third of the funds for incentives has been set aside to pay for
about 500 toilet rebates.;   The program also will help Palo Alto continue to
meet its water consumption limit. So far, the city has been doing well. At the
end of September, it was using 40 percent less water than in 1987 or 18
percent less than the limit set by the San Francisco Water Department, which
supplies all of the city's water.;   "We think there's a gigantic market for
these rebates," Katz said. "And we think it will put a good dent in our water
use.";   IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; To receive a rebate application packet, list of
approved ultra low-flush toilets and plumbing permit, call the Palo Alto
