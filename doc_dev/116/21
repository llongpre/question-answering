<LEADPARA>  THE sound of water running in an unused toilet generally signals a problem
that is fairly easy and inexpensive to repair but costly if ignored.;    Q
Every few hours, my toilet seems to flush itself. I've replaced some parts,
but the flushing continues. What's wrong?  </LEADPARA>

OF WATER  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     A The flushing sound from the toilet is probably caused by the tank's
refilling itself after the water has leaked from the tank into the toilet
bowl. A leak of this type can waste thousands of gallons of water in a few
weeks.;    Most tank-to-bowl leaks are caused by a faulty flush valve. To
check, remove the lid from the tank and watch the operation of the mechanism
inside during several flushes.;    The flush valve is at the bottom of the
tank, near the center. In some toilets, it consists of a rubber half-ball on
the end of a rod. When the toilet is flushed with the flush handle, the ball
is raised from its seat, and water rushes through an opening into the bowl.
Some toilets have a flapper type of valve hooked to a chain instead of a ball
and rod, but the principle is the same. In either case, during a flush, the
ball or flapper returns to its seat and plugs the opening after the tank
empties. The empty tank automatically refills with water and is ready for
another flush.;    If the flush valve is malfunctioning, water from the tank
leaks through the opening into the bowl and eventually lowers the water in the
tank to the point where the tank refills again and the process starts over. If
there is a very slow leak, the cycle can take several hours.;    Watching how
a flush works sometimes makes the cause of a flush-valve malfunction obvious.
In a ball-and-rod mechanism, for example, a slightly bent rod might be causing
the ball to hang up on the edge of the seat instead of closing completely. A
slight adjustment to the rod can often correct this problem.;    If the ball
or flapper seems to be seating properly, the seal still can be poor because of
dirt or corrosion on the valve or seat. Feel the mating surfaces and carefully
wipe to remove any debris. If the metal seat is rough or corroded, it can
sometimes be smoothed with steel wool or fine emery paper.;    Flush-valve
leaks also can be caused by holes or cracks in the ball or flapper.
Replacements parts are available at many home centers and hardware stores.;   
...; Q Wallpaper in our den came loose at the seams. What causes this, and how
can we repair it?;    A The usual cause is not enough paste at the edges or
slow application, which lets the paste dry too soon. Loose seams can usually
be repaired with a special adhesive available in tubes at wallpaper stores.
Also buy a seam roller, which has a small wood roller to press down the seams
for better adhesion. Read the instructions on the adhesive container
carefully. One widely sold product, Elmer's Wallcovering Repair Adhesive, is
applied to both the wall and paper surface and allowed to dry before the
surfaces are joined. If the wall surface is very porous, give it two coats of
adhesive before pressing the loose seam to the wall.;    ...; Q The metal
front door of our house was repainted last fall, but the paint blistered and
flaked off during the winter. What went wrong, and how can we get a lasting
paint job?;    A Probably the wrong type of paint was used, or the surface
wasn't properly prepared. Scrape off all blistered paint and sand the surface
thoroughly. Prime any bare spots with an alkyd-base primer or special metal
primer. An alkyd or acrylic enamel or trim paint can be used for the finish
coats, but be certain it is designed for exterior surfaces and is suitable for
use on metal. Use at least two coats of finish paint, sanding lightly after
the first coat.  </TEXT>
