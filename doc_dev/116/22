<LEADPARA>  YOU'RE wandering through a store looking for a low-flow shower-head or an
energy-saving light bulb. You can't find one, so you ask for help.
Unfortunately, the clerks don't know what you're talking about. And the
manager doesn't either.;    Frustrated? You're probably not alone. How can
anyone in your community buy energy- or water-saving fixtures if they can't
even find them?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Here's a summer project for anyone who wants to help the environment: Help
turn your local hardware store into an environmental supply center.;    
Conservation facts;    (check)  The United States imports more than 50 percent
of its oil, more than in the oil crisis of the 1970s. Much of this is used to
generate residential electricity -- so making homes more energy-efficient
reduces our dependence on foreign oil and helps the economy.;    (check)  The
average American home wastes much of the energy it consumes. Energy-efficient
household products help cut down emissions responsible for acid rain, the
greenhouse effect and other environmental ills.;    (check)  Surveys show that
90 percent of Americans would rather buy water- and energy-saving products at
a local store than order them by phone or mail.;     Shopping survey;  The
next time you go to a hardware store, check to see how many energy- and
water-saving products it carries. Take notes as you go. If you have any
environmental catalogs, take them along to help you look for specific products
and brand names. Pay attention to how well displayed the products are. Check
the store for these items:;    (check)  Plumbing: low-flow shower-heads (2.5
gallons per minute or less), ultra low-flush toilets, toilet dams and
water-saving faucet aerators.;    (check)  Lighting: compact fluorescent light
bulbs, energy-saving floodlights and energy-efficient outdoor fixtures such as
metal halide, high-pressure sodium or compact fluorescent.;    (check) 
Miscellaneous: water heater insulating jackets, appliance timers, programmable
thermostats, battery rechargers and weatherstripping supplies.;     Hardware
audit;    (check)  List what you were looking for, what the store had and what
it didn't have. Compare the selection with other local hardware stores. Make a
separate list for each store.;    (check)  If one store had a better selection
than the others, let each of the managers know, and tell them that you and
your friends will shop at the store with the best selection. Make good on your
promise -- change your shopping habits.;    (check)  Contact your local energy
or water utility; find out if they offer rebate coupons for conservation
products. If they do, ask them to provide local hardware stores with stand-up
displays. Using rebates makes energy-saving products more affordable.;

products for the home.  </TEXT>
