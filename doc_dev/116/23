<LEADPARA>  RAIN WAS pounding the windows of our little San Francisco Victorian on a
Saturday in late March -- a rare sound in a long drought. Shoot. If I went
jogging, puddles would surely flatten the air-bubbled insoles of my running
shoes. Maybe I'd do laundry instead.;    Roger and I perused the mail: Macy's
bill, letter from Mom, amazing credit-card offer and -- uh oh -- The Official
Notice From The Water Department.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Roger tore it open and we both hunched over it to see the tiny
computer-generated numbers that told us how much water we could use for the
next 12 months.;    "Not much," Roger said, tossing the sheet aside. I grabbed
it, looked again, and the reality of the five-year drought sank in for the
first time.;    Our ration of the sapped Hetch Hetchy water supply was a
dribbly 218 gallons a day -- to be shared with the three tenants in our front
house.;    It worked out to 43.6 gallons a person. That was even less than the
notorious 50 gallons-a-person limit for Marin County's parched populace.;    I
looked closer at the numbers. They didn't change. I prayed for biblical rain.
That's what the water czars said we would need to go back to our wonderfully
wicked water-wasting ways.;    "Wait a minute, you realize what 43 gallons
is?" I asked, my voice soft at first but steadily rising to a plaintive whine.
"It means we can't flush the toilet if we wanna take a shower. We can't do the
dishes if I wanna wash my hair. We can't brush our teeth if we wanna do the
laundry. We can't . . .";    There was too much rain to go jogging, but not
nearly enough to do the laundry.;    Baths and hot tubs?;  My co-workers in
the South Bay seemed comparatively unfazed by the drought. This became
apparent one day when a large group went out to lunch. These happy-go-lucky
people were talking about giving kids their baths, planting perennials and
filling their hot tubs. I wondered how I was going to wash my hair that
night.;    If the whole state was in a drought, I thought, how come only some
of us were forced to conserve?;    I decided our water department was to
blame. If Hetch Hetchy hadn't sold water to every county, city and farmer who
asked years ago, we'd have plenty of water for San Franciscans who own the
water system.;    OK, so we usually have a lot more water than we need. And
we've made millions of dollars selling Sierra runoff over the years. And other
places need the water too. But weren't we stretched a little too thin?;    It
also seemed our rationing formula -- based on our water use in 1987 -- was
preposterously obsolete. With the new 45 percent cutback, those of us who'd
always conserved were given a puddle; San Franciscans who nurtured their
bougainvillea and cucumbers in 1987 were getting 150 gallons a day apiece.;   
"Why not just give everyone a flat amount?" I seethed. The water department
asserted the formula is the only feasible way to figure what everyone needs.; 
  Hardware solution;  Roger and I headed to the full-service hardware store on
Clement Street. The friendly clerks there can maneuver through rows of
mystifying metal thingamajiggies to find any household gadget known to man.;  
 "You want what?" asked the crusty clerk with the tobacco-stained smile.
"Low-flow shower heads?" He chuckled, squinted one eye and sucked a drag off a
cigarette. Then he wound through the musty aisles, with us following like
puppies, until we reached the bathroom-fixtures display. He pointed to a wall
of empty hooks.;    "I guess it's a no-go on the low-flow," he said, coughing
out a hearty laugh. "We were all outa those a long time ago. Next shipment'll
be in three weeks."; (hbox);    Most people use about 150 gallons a day. It
takes 43 gallons to flush the toilet six times or take a five-minute
normal-flow shower. If we did either one of those, we couldn't turn on the tap
for the rest of the day.;    Roger and I visited our three tenants to explain
we were truly in a drought. If we used more than our share, we'd have to pay a
big fine and eventually they would shut off our water altogether.;    The
tenants stared silently. "I don't want to pay a fine just so you can do your
laundry," one of them declared.;    True, we have a washing machine that uses
55 gallons for one load and they go down the street to the laundromat.;    We
decided not to do the laundry unless we skipped two days' worth of showers.;  
 Mutual monitoring;  But the rigid rations created a new air of suspicion as
the five of us embarked secretly on a mission of mutual monitoring.;    A
tenant peered out her window to watch as I hauled a load of laundry to the
basement. I paused under their kitchen window counting gallons as they washed
their dishes.;    Even Roger and I started snapping at each other as we
suddenly focused on each other's water-wasting tendencies.;    "Why are you
turning the water on?" I shouted first thing one morning. He had just flipped
on the bathroom faucet and was rummaging through the medicine chest to find
his toothbrush.;    "Oh. Sorry. It's just habit," he said, twisting the faucet
shut while he continued his search.;    I got up in the middle of the night to
go to the bathroom. He awoke and shouted: "Don't flush the toilet!" I snapped
to attention.;    "It was reflex," I said, sinking into guilty dreams of
wallowing in water.;    Soon we started planning our toilet flushes, realizing
that each time we pushed the handle it cost us seven precious gallons. Roger
and I set aside our pride and let the contents pile up until it smelled like
the cat box. Then we flushed without remorse.;    Last week, we put away our
china and filled our cupboards with paper plates. It saved a lot of
dishwashing, but burdened us with the guilt of contributing more to the
landfill crisis.;    We also realized that we were wasting several gallons
each morning by running the bathtub water until it turned hot. So we put a big
pot into the bathroom and used it to catch the "heat-up" water. Brilliant,
right? Except that the pot was too heavy to lift out of the tub. Both of us
stood there pulling and grunting, and feeling like we were in a Mack Sennett
silent movie.;    So we started filling the pot only halfway. It was still
comical; we'd run with it into the kitchen and dash back into the heated
shower. Later we would use the rescued water to steam vegetables, wash dishes
and water plants.;    One day my girlfriend from Oakland, where water is
plentiful, visited our drought wizened house. When she saw our big pot of
captured "heat-up" water, she stared at me as though I'd suddenly shaved half
of my head and dyed the other half green.;    "You save your water?" she said
in a low voice. "I do four loads of laundry a day. I stand in the shower as
long as I want. How come we live a few miles apart and I have as much water as
I want and you guys have so little?";    Good question. It reminded me of so
many other times that family and friends had pointed out San Francisco's
shortcomings. "There's no parking in the city!" "You have too many hills to
ride your bike." "Aren't you petrified of earthquakes?";    Now the drought.
Is this just another quirk that gives San Francisco its character? Or is it
time to move on?;    Well, we had survived so far on our cramped, hilly,
fault-ridden terrain. And now the water board is to meet Tuesday to decide
whether to give us more water.;    If March storms dumped enough snow in the
Sierra, and if the snowmelt is running into our reservoirs, and if we'd have
enough water for next year, then they may raise our rations.;    We'd be
rolled back just 25 percent. A mere inconvenience. Just think. We could use
real china, take a shower every day, do laundry once a week, flush almost
every time . . .  (box)  </TEXT>
