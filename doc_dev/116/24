   Far from making jokes about European plumbing
arrangements, Americans are now growing interested in fixtures from
overseas, according to the Plumbing-Heating-Cooling Information
Bureau.
   One of the reasons is the design itself, says Linda Mayer, the
Kohler Co.'s marketing director. ``In good design, form follows
functions, and Europeans do a good job at both,'' she says.
European fixtures tend to be more rounded and come in interesting
shapes, some with Art Deco flavor.
   Thompson Price, a designer and president of the National Kitchen
&amp; Bath Association, says the European look uses rounded, gentle
curves which follow the contour of the body. ``Traditional American
fixture and faucet design tends to be more angular, with more
straight lines. Form follows function rather than aesthetics.''
   In recent years, major American fixture manufacturers have gone
into joint ventures with European companies to add some continental
finesse to their lines. Eljer, for example, has contracted with
Swedish, French and Italian groups, while Kohler Co. recently
acquired a French maker, Jacob Delafon. And the German firm, Ideal
Standard, is part of the American Standard corporate family.
   ``During the past several years, American manufacturers have
made great strides in adapting the `Eurostyle' look to domestic
bathroom products,'' says David L. Weiner, the PHCIC's executive
director. ``In turn, European manufacturers, particularly faucet
producers, have done a good job in cracking the American market.''
   The faucets have a soft, rounded look and often are colored.
Perhaps more importantly, they`re quieter. ``Europeans are very
sensitive to the noise made by their faucets,'' says Don Arnold, an
industry consultant. ``They have strict regulations on faucet
operating noise. American faucets would never pass these
regulations.''
   European makers are courting the U.S. customer. Joey Von Korff,
sales and marketing director for the Europe-based Villeroy &amp; Boch,
says that ``Americans are enthusiastic about our designs and
colors, and they appreciate our superior quality. Our plan is to
continue to build consumer awareness of our products.''
   But American firms still dominate the U.S. market, says Mayer.
``Fixtures are difficult to import, and they're priced higher than
domestic brands.''
   Major differences that may not translate well for the American
market are toilets and bidets. Scott Atcheson, Eljer's fixtures
product manager, points out that European toilets are not what
Americans are used to at home. ``European toilets are all super
water savers, using as little as 1.5 gallons per flush. Regulations
on water usage are stricter there than in the U.S.,'' he says.
``Although low-consumption toilets are now on the scene in this
country, the American consumer is still accustomed to a good strong
toilet flush.''
   And bidets in this country may be considered more a status
symbol than a necessity, adds Price. ``Europeans, on average, take
only about three baths per week as compared to seven or more for
Americans,'' he says. ``Europeans couldn't do without the bidet.''
