It didn't quite pack the suspense of a countdown at Cape Canaveral. 
</P>
<P>
"Three, two, one . . ." a reporter intoned. 
</P>
<P>
And then, Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter pulled the lever on a 
toilet that was stationed outside the Department of Water and Power building 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
As the machine flushed its water out through a specially attached hose Friday, 
conscientious radio and television reporters gallantly thrust their microphones 
inside the white ceramic bowl to illustrate its relatively quiet thrust. 
</P>
<P>
The colorful exhibition was staged to unveil an ultralow-flush toilet, which 
swallows just 1.6 gallons of water at a time, about half of what a standard 
toilet uses. A city ordinance mandates that, beginning July 1, all new and/or 
replaced residential toilets must be of the low-flush variety. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter said that she expects about 250,000 such toilets installed in the 
first year, which would save an estimated 476 million gallons of water. That's 
enough water, her staff pointed out, to fill the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 
four times over. And, perhaps, wash the Raiders out of town. 
</P>
<P>
Indian Joe hasn't been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
The headstone of the 19th-Century Downey resident disappeared from a local 
cemetery last year, but Ed Lewis and the Greenleaf 4-H club have come to the 
rescue. They're constructing a duplicate -- a 2 1/2-foot-tall redwood marker 
that will bear the original painted inscription: 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good Indian while he lived. He belonged to the Kaweah. He lived in 
Downey 22 years and died November 22, 1895." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis said he's making this marker longer so that it can sit deeper in the 
cement. "Last time it was in cement, too, and they (the thieves) just dug the 
whole thing out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Joe, who died at about the age of 55, was something of a local medicine man who 
shared his home remedies with local residents, said Joyce Lawrence of the 
Downey Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
In an obituary on Joe, a Downey newspaper noted that he lived his last years 
outdoors. Once he had lived in a shed near the tracks of the Southern Pacific 
Railroad, the article said, but after a storm blew the shed down on him, he 
"could never be induced to sleep under a roof again." 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, you can find valet parking for everything from movie 
premieres and the Beverly Hills post office to barbecued ribs joints. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes an event so big that a $5 valet charge is being assessed drivers -- 
and the charge must be paid by mail 10 days early. 
</P>
<P>
What is this extravaganza? The June 30 inauguration of Los Angeles' newly 
elected city officials on the posh 1st Street steps of City Hall. No paparazzi, 
please.
