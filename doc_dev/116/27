   A judge declared a mistrial in a drug trial
when three jurors made an unauthorized visit to the alleged crime
scene to see how long it took a toilet to flush.
   This particular privy was supposed to be private.
   ``I'm hard pressed not to use the analogy, flushed down the
toilet,'' Superior Judge Robert Bradley said in declaring the
mistrial Tuesday in the case against Nelson Cortez, of Oxnard.
   The jury foreman told the judge the panelists visited an
apartment rented by co-defendant Joel Ruvalcaba to test the truth of
Cortez' testimony.
   Cortez had testified he was awakened by the sound of a toilet
flushing on Jan. 14, 1988, went into the bathroom and was
immediately arrested by waiting police after officers found a bag of
cocaine in the bowl.
   Cortez claimed he didn't know how the drug got in the toilet.
   Ruvalcaba, meanwhile, was arrested in the living room.
   Two jurors tried flushing their own toilets at home to see if
Cortez would have had enough time to get up, go to the bathroom and
get arrested all in the flush of a toilet.
   Not satisfied with the home experiments, three jurors went to the
apartment building on a lunch break last week, posed as prospective
renters to gain access to Ruvalcaba's former apartment and timed the
toilet flush.
   The judge said he had to declare the mistrial because the
apartment visit was ``serious misconduct.'' Jurors had been told not
to visit the crime scene.
   The panel was allowed to continue to deliberate the fate of
Ruvalcaba.
