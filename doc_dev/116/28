<HL> Technology: California Town Enlists House Builders To Implement Water Conservation Plan </HL>

   In a program with national implications, a small California town is requiring contractors to retrofit existing houses with water-saving devices before issuing building permits for new houses. 

   Like many U.S. communities, the south-central California town of Morro Bay, population 10,000, is chronically short of fresh water because it depends on shallow ground-water basins. 
Its program aims to save as much water in older residences as new houses can be expected to use. 

   Thus, officials now require contractors to buy and install at their own expense water-saving toilets, shower heads and faucets in at least 10 houses for every new house they build. 
Each package of water-saving devices cuts a household's water use by roughly 20%, which translates into lower monthly water bills for those owners who volunteer for the retrofit. 

   While a number of states and cities, including Massachusetts and Los Angeles, either have or are about to impose water-efficiency standards for new construction, Morro Bay is believed to be the first town in the U.S. to make enhanced water efficiency in existing houses a prerequisite for building a new house. 

   James Christian, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions in Washington, thinks the idea could catch on wherever water supplies are tight. 
In his opinion, "Mayors and city commissioners will see this as {politically} easier than bond issues and raising property taxes" for improvements to the local water-supply system. 

   Mr. Christian further says Morro Bay appears to be part of a more-general developing trend that has contractors being asked to spend their own money on municipal improvements, particularly roads, before getting a permit to build. 
Mr. Christian says he wouldn't be surprised if, one day soon, contractors are even subsidizing improvements to town dumps. 

   So far, according to Morro Bay associate planner David Bugher, one-third of the town's 5,000 houses, as well as more than 400 motel rooms and 29 commercial establishments, have been retrofitted, resulting in building permits being issued for about 150 new houses. 

   At a cost to the contractor of roughly $200 a house, including installation, Morro Bay house owners are getting for free a package that includes a toilet that uses just 3.5 gallons a flush, or half the average of most toilets. 
The package also includes a shower head that uses only three gallons of water a minute, compared with the average head that uses five to eight gallons a minute. 

   The toilet's efficiency stems from a shallower trap. 
The shower head has smaller holes plus aerating vents that suck in air and blow it out with the water stream, giving the effect of higher water volume than is actually used. 

   To be sure, more-efficient toilets, using just 1.5 gallons a flush, are on the market, and are even the standard in Massachusetts. 
But while that would increase the water saving to 25%, Mr. Bugher says the 1.5-gallon toilet has a "perception problem" with local residents, who, he says, just don't see how it can work. (The 1.5-gallon model has an even shallower trap.) 

   Given that new houses currently sell for $200,000 to $300,000 each, Mr. Bugher adds that a contractor doesn't have much trouble passing through to the new-house buyer the additional $1,000 or so cost for water retrofitting.
