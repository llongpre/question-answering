   The movers and shakers in the world of plumbing
and wastewater treatment celebrated the opening Wednesday of a new
museum exhibit illustrating the plumber's role as guardian of the
nation's health.
   ``The average person flushes the closet and (they) don't know
what happens to the water. They don't realize what's all involved
in plumbing,'' said William Reichert, chairman of the Chicago
Plumbing Council.
   ``Our motto is, the plumbers protect the health of the nation.
The doctors take care of it _ but we protect it,'' said Reichert,
who began as an apprentice plumber in 1926 and now is president of
a local plumbing and heating company.
   About 200 people, many of them plumbing contractors, plumbing
inspectors or plumbing engineers, crowded into the new
2,200-square-foot exhibit at Chicago's Museum of Science and
Industry.
   The exhibit illustrates the flow of water in the Chicago area
from Lake Michigan through treatment plants, into the home, out the
toilet and into sewage treatment plants.
   Instead of the traditional ribbon-cutting, Mayor Eugene Sawyer
did the honors at a pipe-cutting ceremony, working up a sweat
slicing the pipe as some of the plumbers' wives snapped pictures.
   ``I've just earned my plumbing (union) card again,'' Sawyer
quipped. ``I used to be a member of the Plumbers Union because I
started out in the Water Department as a chemist.
   ``I understand how important it is that we in Chicago have clean
water,'' the mayor said.
   Reichert, proudly showing off the exhibit, said it was a tribute
to the plumber's role in modern society.
   The first section features seven animated transparencies showing
how the city's water system provides more than 1 billion gallons of
water daily to more than 7 million people.
   The next section, a series of full-scale cutaway rooms in a
house, features glass pipes instead of steel or cast iron, showing
how water flows through the kitchen, bathroom and laundry room.
   ``When you flush the closet, it shows how the closet works and
where the water goes,'' Reichert said. ``It's interesting. If you
have kids, you can bring them down and show them.''
   He pointed to a bend inside the bottom of the toilet, just
before the point where the water flows out, and noted that's where
most blockages occur.
   Reichert paused before a glass display case containing a fat,
two-foot chunk of weathered wood.
   ``Way back in Chicago in the 1800s, we had wooden water mains.
When they dug the subway they uncovered some of these,'' he said.
   ``And here's an old-time closet with a wooden tank like they had
way back when,'' Reichert said, pointing out an older model of
toilet.
   The final section of the exhibit is a walk-through theater
describing the history and wastewater treatment responsibilities of
the Metropolitan Sanitary District of Chicago.
   Frank Mucha of Chicago, a museum visitor, was among the first to
view the new exhibit.
   ``I think it's very nice. It's interesting and educational.''
   Mucha confessed he'd never given much thought to what happens
when the commode is flushed.
   ``I never paid any attention to it in the past. I had no idea
what happened.''
