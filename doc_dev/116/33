   Amtrak pleaded innocent Monday, via
facsimile machine, to charges that it illegally flushes
passenger-car toilets and sewage tanks when its trains cross Florida
waterways, where fishermen have been sprayed.
   The transmission of the pleas to Circuit Judge Robert Perry
quickly ended an arraignment, said Assistant State Attorney Paul
Meredith. The judge scheduled a Nov. 2 hearing for pre-trial motions.
   Amtrak has threatened to halt service in Florida.
   The plea was entered after Amtrak earlier rejected a settlement
offer from State Attorney John Tanner, who promised to drop three
charges of commercial dumping if Amtrak would stop all flushing
while its trains cross trestles over creeks and rivers in his
judicial district.
   Amtrak, which has been dumping along its tracks under a federal
law dating back more than a century, said it can't do that because
it would set a precedent.
   The federal law permits the railway to flush toilets along its
right-of-way, and federal law overrides state and local regulations,
Amtrak contends.
   Amtrak has also come under fire in several Western states for its
sanitary habits, but Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said this is
the first complaint filed in a criminal court.
   Amtrak had threatened to suspend service in Florida if Tanner
pressed his case, but Tanner said Amtrak was bluffing.
   ``We hope we won't have to suspend service to Florida,'' said
Amtrak spokeswoman Sue Martin in Washington, D.C. ``But we are
between a rock and a hard place and we certainly do not want to
continue this public embarrassment. We do not want to be accused of
committing a felony every day.''
   Tanner filed the misdemeanor counts after getting complaints from
people who said they were sprayed with raw sewage while fishing
beneath trestles in the Palatka area of northeastern Florida. Tanner
said the charges would be dropped if Amtrak agreed to stop dumping
over Rice Creek, a tributary of the St. Johns River, and in the
river itself.
   Black said agreeing to Tanner's conditions would have made Amtrak
a target for similar demands from anyone else wanting to stop
dumping in any body of water in Florida.
   Amtrak's passenger cars dispose of sewage either by dumping
directly onto the tracks when toilets are flushed or by spraying the
contents of 30-gallon holding tanks along the tracks when the trains
are traveling at least 35 mph.
   The company hopes eventually to replace much of its fleet with
cars that would have holding tanks for all toilets. Black said it
would cost $147 million to install those tanks on the current fleet.
