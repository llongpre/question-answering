After six months of efforts to encourage voluntary water conservation in 
Anaheim resulted in just a 1% reduction in water use, the city Utility 
Department next month will begin an aggressive new water-saving program with 
possible financial rebates for residents. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to cut water waste in the city by 10% in the next two years 
under the plan, saving the city up to $1 million, some of which may be passed 
on to water users. 
</P>
<P>
"People start out with very good intentions, but the little good habits we 
build seem to go out the window when the extreme conditions come along," said 
Ray Merchant, a spokesman for the city utility department. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for residents to install low-flush toilets and high-efficiency 
shower heads, which combined can save at least 30 gallons of water per person 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
Incentives, such as a possible $75 to $100 rebate for installing the 
water-saving toilet, would also be offered to encourage residents' 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
The Utility Department also hopes to encourage businesses to participate by 
using recycled water when possible in commercial and industrial operations, and 
by reducing the amount of water used for landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Two new Utility Department staff members will be hired to administer the 
program, which will be jointly funded by the city, the Metropolitan Water 
District and the county Sanitation District of Orange County, with each entity 
paying $120,000 toward the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Cutting water use could result in savings of up to $1 million in fees from the 
Metropolitan Water District and the county Sanitation District. However, the 
Metropolitan Water District can fine the city up to $550,000 if it fails to cut 
water use by 5%. 
</P>
<P>
"Our hope is that these programs -- though they will have short-term effects -- 
will be long-term programs," said Merchant. "We're still not talking about 
mandatory conservation. But we're talking about doing what we can now so that 
if it becomes mandatory, it won't be severe." LISA MASCARO
