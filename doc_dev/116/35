<TEXT>     The water-loving culprits aren't gremlins. They are automatic water
softening systems. And water officials estimate that they are responsible for
wasting at least a half-million gallons every night in homes throughout the
Santa Clara Valley, enough in one night to supply three average families for a
year.;    There are tens of thousands of automatic water softeners being used
throughout the South Bay: not the little charcoal faucet attachments, but the
big tanks that sit in garages and laundry rooms. Most are in homes. But many
offices and restaurants also use the devices, which remove calcium, magnesium
and other particles from hard water to make it taste better and to keep it
from leaving ugly deposits in sinks and tubs.;    But that is a luxury that
officials at the Santa Clara Valley Water District say they can no longer
afford.; "We'll be asking people to turn them off this year," said Teddy Morse
of the Santa Clara Valley Water District. "The water . . . won't taste the
same. But (the softeners) use an awful lot of water.";    Just how much?
Thirty-five to 120 gallons every time the systems need to be flushed. In most
homes, it's every three days. In some homes, restaurants and offices, it's
every night.;    The request to abandon water softeners comes just when water
will be tasting its worst because more of it will be pumped from underground
wells.;    The large amounts of water are used when the softeners "regenerate"
-- using a saltwater solution to clean the resin bead filters that collect the
bad-tasting particles. This cleaning process is automatic, set by a timer for
the wee hours of the morning, when there is little water demand. Then, the tap
typically runs for an hour or more.;    Water mystery;    Just how much water
runs through softeners has caught some people by surprise.;    Two months ago,
Dave Mendoza tried to add up how much water he and his wife used each day.
They counted the toilet flushes, the showers, the dishwasher, the two weekly
loads of laundry.;    "It didn't add up. Our water bill said we were using
hundreds of gallons more than we thought," said Mendoza, who lives in San
Jose. "Then a neighbor told us it was our water softener.";    Mendoza
discovered the 7-year-old system used 50 gallons every other day. The Mendozas
have since shut it off.;    "The water doesn't taste as good," he said, "but
we're saving $30 a month on our water bill.";    Water softener manufacturers
are quick to defend their products.;    'Health is more important';  "People
look at it this way: The family's health is more important than the fine for
using too much water," said Mari Lynn Johnson, manager of Eco Water Servisoft
in San Jose, which rents 6,000 softeners and sells about 1,200 each year.
"It's not as bad as they make it sound.";    Water officials and consumer
advocates reply that, while the softeners may improve taste, they aren't
designed to remove harmful contaminants.;    "Actually, they send too much
salt to the sewage treatment plants," said Pat Ferraro, a water board member.
"The salt will eventually become as important an issue as how much water they
use." An average water softener uses six pounds of salt each regeneration
cycle.;    To keep water-watching customers from turning away from water
softeners, some companies have come up with plans to clean the resin beads at
water plants, so people don't have to use their home water allotments to flush
the purifiers.;    Installs flow restricters;  Johnson said her company
installs water flow restricters such as low-flow shower heads to make up for
the water used to clean the systems that it sells.;    "We dread having people
shut everything off because they are wasting water," said Pam Workman of Rayne
Water Conditioning Systems, which has 14,000 customers in the San Jose area.
"There are alternatives.";    In response to the drought, Rayne has developed
a water softener that uses only 12 gallons per regeneration flush. But few
other companies have followed suit.;    The Santa Clara Valley Water District
advises people with water softeners to shut them off for the duration of the
drought. If they can't stomach the water, the district is requesting that
people try to reduce the timing of their softener flushing cycles to once a
week or less.;     THE PROCESS; This is how a water softener works:;
(box)Mineral-rich "hard" water flows through a tank filled with resin beads,
which remove the minerals and other particles.; (box)The particle-free "soft"
water flows directly to outlets in the home or business.; (box)As the resin
beads remove the minerals, they slowly get saturated with "hard" material.
They must be cleaned every few days so they can continue to grip onto
particles. This is done by running saltwater through the resin.; (box)After
the saltwater cleanses the beads, it runs down the drain.;  HOW MUCH DO THEY
FLUSH?; Here is about how much water selected automatic water softening
systems use each time they clean the resin filters after 1,000 gallons of
water have been purified. The frequency of flushing varies with household
water use but is generally every one to three days.; Type of softener
