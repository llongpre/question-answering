<LEADPARA>  Charles Gerba knows exactly where his research will put him: in front of a
toilet, head down in the bowl.;    He's investigated airplane toilets -- "I
almost swallowed my equipment." He's explored gas station toilets -- "They
were so awful, I almost lost my scientific curiosity." But his career is built
on the toilets in people's homes.  </LEADPARA>

SCIENTIST SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Gerba, a microbiologist at the University of Arizona in Tucson, is the man
who can tell you in great detail what happens to your bathroom every time you
flush.;    "A very fine aerosol spray is ejected," he says, enthusiastically,
between sips of coffee. "You don't see it, or feel it, but it fills the room.
So, if your toothbrushes are out, you may end up brushing your teeth with
material you thought had gone down the toilet.";    As part of his research,
Gerba, who keeps his toothbrush in the medicine cabinet, visited a series of
residential bathrooms and placed glass dishes throughout them. He filled the
dishes with a thin gel on which bacteria and viruses grow. Then he flushed the
toilet. The dishes were soon blooming with micro-organisms.;    "We repeated
the experiment by putting a virus that mice are susceptible to in the toilet
bowls and putting caged mice in the bathrooms," Gerba said. "They all became
ill with that virus after we flushed the toilet. Except for those above six
feet. In both cases, the spray clearly did not reach above six feet.";    His
interest is in public health. Gerba says he suspects that illnesses such as
colds and influenza could be drastically reduced if people understood what
germ factories exist in their homes. In fact, one study of more than 200 homes
found that 91 percent contained micro-organisms that cause skin and eye
infections, pneumonia and meningitis. Eighty percent contained bacteria that
may cause intestinal illness.;    During a recent visit to Sacramento, Gerba
said an increasing number of scientists are coming to believe that the
presence of viruses and bacteria on household surfaces, such as bathroom and
kitchen counter tops, may play a major role in the spread of disease.;   
Recent studies even suggest that touching a contaminated surface is much more
likely to bring on a cold than being exposed to a sneeze. One U.S. Army
experiment involved keeping soldiers inside a barracks. Those with colds could
not touch surfaces used by healthy people. Even though the group shared the
same air -- filled with sneezes and coughs -- none of the healthy soldiers
came down with a cold.;    Gerba recommends that bathrooms and kitchens be
disinfected weekly, using a chemical disinfectant.;    "Wiping with a rag just
isn't enough," Gerba said. "All you do is spread the germs out in a thin layer
of water, which is exactly where they like to live anyway."  </TEXT>
