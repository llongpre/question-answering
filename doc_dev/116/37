<CAPTION>  Diagram; Illustration by Jenny Anderson; DIAGRAM: (Diagram of house and yard
including items referred to in text below) (color); ...; Windbreaks: Will
reduce evaporation. They shouldn't cast shade all day. Anything light-colored
could reflect too much heat. Moisture-stealing summer winds come mostly from
the northwest and west.; ...; Compost heap: Decomposed organic waste used to
enrich soil and as mulch. Use grass clippings, leaves, disease-free plants,
small twigs, kitchen waste (avoid grease, fat, meat scraps or bones, which
attract flies and insects). Don't use pet droppings. They can carry disease.;
...; Camellia, azalea: Can't tolerate graywater. Use water collected while
waiting for shower to warm up. Use pine needles as mulch.; ...; Trees: Should
be able to survive with deep watering once a month. California native trees
can go all summer with no irrigation. Can tolerate graywater; be careful not
to splash graywater on trunk. Rotate watering so trees don't get graywater
exclusively. Use low-nitrogen fertilizer (6-10-10). Irrigate fruit trees
during blossoming and fruit set periods. Allow only fruit you want to harvest
to develop.; ...; Deep watering: Dig holes 12 to 18 inches deep, 1 to 2 feet
apart around drip line. Fill with organic matter, sand or gravel; connect with
shallow trench. Water directly over holes. Use mulch around tree. Keep water
away from trunk.; ...; Basin watering: Build a 3- to 4-inch berm around tree
to keep water inside drip line. Mulch area inside berm. Use porous hose laid
inside berm along drip line; water at night.; ...; Raised beds: Plants seem to
like them and they use water efficiently. Make 1 foot high, no wider than 4
feet so you can reach halfway across. Group plants by compatibility, length of
growing season, water needs; space so that when plants are mature there is no
exposed soil. Go for compact plants that produce full-size vegetables or
flowers. Plant vegetables that produce more than one crop. Put flowers around
edge or interplant to repel insects and add beauty.; ...; Graywater: To
augment water supply, collect from bathtub, dishwasher, washing machine. Must
be used knowledgeably. Don't use on vegetables. See Page 4D; ...; Containers:
Good way to grow flowers, vegetables on small- scale. Use mulch, polymers.
Bottom of container should have good drainage.; ...; Watering: Use timer with
drip irrigation system to closely regulate amount of water used. Select drip
fixtures that provide correct amount of water for type of plant.; ...; Lawn:
Best turfgrass is tall fescue -- uses less water because it has deep roots,
tolerates heat, withstands wear and tear, is disease-resistant, out-competes
weeds. Aerate in spring so water penetrates. Apply pre-emergent herbicide. Use
slow- release fertilizer lightly to encourage root development and keep lawn
healthy but not fast growing. Mow to height of 2 inches. Water weekly early in
the morning to a depth of 4 to 6 inches. To prevent runoff, water 15 minutes,
wait an hour, water 15 minutes more. Consider letting lawn die but leave the
dead turf as mulch.  </CAPTION>
<DESCRIPT>  GARDEN; WATER; CONSERVATION; DROUGHT; GUIDELINE; MAJOR-; STORY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Despite recent soaking rains, there will again be water rationing this summer.
Gardeners will have to stretch their available water to keep all or part of
what's in their yards alive. This guide is intended to help gardeners get the
most out of every drop. The garden shown includes plants, shrubs and trees
likely to be found locally. The watering scheme is based on having 1,400
gallons per week -- an average calculated by the San Jose Water Co. based on
1990 use in this area -- available for irrigation. By using graywater and
cutting down on indoor use by installing low-flow toilets or taking fewer
showers, gardeners can make their water go even further.;

<MEMO>  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 4/4/91, pg. 2E);  Also in that same
section, some information about watering could have been misleading. Experts
say that those who soak their lawns should water with half the amount they
intend to use, stop watering for about an hour and then use the other half of
the water. The article said to water for 15 minutes.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  Plant Guide; (box) Flowers: Cosmos, cornflower, sunflower, French marigold,
nasturtium, sweet alyssum, lavender, geranium, vinca. Annuals need more water
than perennials, but annuals set flower more quickly.; (box) Vegetables:
Beets, bush beans, carrots, leafy lettuce (not head); Asian red mustard, hot
peppers, Chinese cabbage, cucumbers, eggplant, parsley, radishes, spinach,
compact summer squash, Swiss chard, tomatoes, turnips. Don't plant corn and
vining crops such as melons.; (box) Shrubs: Broom, juniper, Oregon grape,
firethorn, heavenly bamboo, Australian bluebell, ceanothus, rosemary, lemon
bottlebrush. California native shrubs use the least amount of water.;

ENHANCING SOIL'S WATER-RETENTIVENESS; Mulching: (Includes diagram of compost
levels); Critical in a drought because it helps prevent evaporation and keeps
the soil cool. Before putting down mulch, cultivate soil and remove weeds.
Established trees and shrubs can be mulched with a 2- to 4-inch layer; smaller
plants, annuals, perennials, bulbs, 2 inches. Leave no bare ground. Use
organic mulches such as hay, compost, peat moss, leaves, redwood soil
conditioner, small bark chips, bark fiber or grass clippings that will
decompose and enrich the soil. If you use compost as a mulch, be sure it is
completely rotted.; ...; Polymers:; Water-absorbing gels that expand to many
times their size, then release excess water slowly into the soil. They seem to
work best when used in containers and raised beds for flowers and vegetables
but can be used with other plantings. Polymers are fairly expensive but can
last many years in the soil. On the flip side, their lasting quality concerns
environmentalists. Some gardeners won't touch polymers because they're
synthetics.; xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx;
Dispersing graywater: (includes drawing in color); Cut off the top of a
plastic milk carton or coffee can. Punch holes in it and bury in ground by
plant. Fill with graywater. Water will slowly drip into root zone.;
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; SETTING
PRIORITIES; Know your yard. What kind of plants and trees do you have? How
well established are they? How healthy are they? How do they respond to
graywater? What's expendable? There's a world of difference between a
30-year-old redwood or healthly, bearing fruit tree and annuals and ground
cover that can be replaced in one growing season.; ...; Purely personal
choices:; (box) If you take one less shower per week, you will save enough
water for an azalea bush for a week.; (box) If you don't wash your car, you
will save the amount of water a redwood tree needs in a day.; (box) If you use
graywater to flush your toilet, you will save enough after 7 flushes to
irrigate a 100 square feet of raised bed garden for a week; after 14 flushes,
100 square feet of lawn for a week.; ...; How to tell when to water:; (box)
When a plant changes color fropm bright green to dull gray-green and visibly
wilts.; (box) When moisture meter reads in the "dry" range.; (box) If you step
on the lawn and can see your footprint, it needs watering.; ...; How much
water to use(*); (box) Lawn: 100 square feet of lawn needs about 70 gallons of
water per week. (A 20-foot by 20-foot requires 280 gallons per week.) Water
every 5-7 days.; (box) Raised vegetable beds: 100 square feet, mulched, using
drip irrigation, need about 37 gallons of water per week, or about half as
much as the same amount of lawn. May need to be watered twice a week. DO NOT
use graywater on vegetables.; (box) Boxwood hedge: If healthy and established,
a 30-foot hedge containing 5-7 plants needs 30-35 gallons of water per week.
It can probably get by with one 15-to-20-minute watering per month using an
"ooze tube" (porous hose). Graywater OK.; (box) Camellia or rhododendron:
Medium-size bushes need 5-10 gallons per day. Azaleas need about half that
much. Water frequency depends on shallowness of roots; shallower roots need to
be watered more often.; (box) Apricot or orange tree: Need 70-210 gallons per
week. Water monthly. Graywater OK.; (*) Water needs are based on amounts
plants must have to survive in hot, dry conditions.  </TEXT>
