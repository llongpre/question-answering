<LEADPARA>  It was an odd scene: Environmentalist Dorothy Green, founding president of
Heal the Bay, was saying Angelenos have "gone overboard" in water
conservation.;   "There's no need to have brown lawns; there's no need not to
flush the toilet when you need to," Green said from her seat on the city's
Department of Water and Power commission. An irate customer had been fuming
over a proposal to raise water rates, after consumers have endured months of
humiliation as they tell out-of-town guests not to flush.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Like water agencies throughout the state, the DWP is losing money: It is
selling less water to water-saving customers, causing a drop in revenues,
while the cost of providing that water is growing.;   Santa Barbara, which
last year regaled the world with images of residents painting their lawns
green after watering was prohibited, now is dropping most of its conservation
restrictions. The new rules will allow people to buy more water and enable the
city to cover the costs of providing the new water residents have demanded.;  
Projected revenue loss; In Los Angeles, Department of Water and Power
officials say the problem is dire because a mandatory rationing plan called
for 15 percent cuts, but customers instead saved 30 percent. The department
now faces a projected revenue loss of at least $70 million in its $300 million
budget. Meanwhile, the costs of maintaining DWP's system remain the same, and
some costs have increased.;   A toilet retrofit program has been so successful
-- there have been 115,000 orders for the $100-per-water-wasting-toilet rebate
since spring 1990 -- that the program is $8.5 million over its original $2
million budget and probably will end in October.;   The cost of meeting new
water quality standards also has risen.;   If rates don't rise considerably,
water department officials say, projects to expand reclamation and recycling
will be delayed. The agency also would lose its AA bond rating, they say.;  
"If we can't issue debt, we literally shut down," said Mike Gage, DWP
commission president. The agency still would have water, he said, but it would
have to pay tens of millions of dollars in higher interest and it would lose
the water-saving benefits of projects put on hold.;   'Everyone screamed';  
The Santa Clara Valley Water District has faced similar problems. Earlier this
year, the district was in danger of losing its AA bond rating and raised its
water prices by about 50 percent. "When that hit, everyone screamed," said
board member Pat Ferraro.;   Although the financial outlook has improved,
Ferraro said he still worries about the district's ability to finance an
extensive water reuse project he'd like to see.;   And the increase hasn't
been enough to cover some water-saving programs the board wants to start,
Ferraro said. For instance, although the district hired a conservation
manager, it has postponed a toilet rebate program.;   And then there's Santa
Barbara, which at one point imposed 45 percent rationing while officials
scrambled to find more water. That scramble yielded emergency water from the
state and a desalination plant. Along with "March miracle" rains, the new
water sources have convinced city officials they can meet 80 percent of normal
demand for three years even if the drought continues.;   But the new water
sources cost a lot of money, leaving a potential deficit of at least $1
million in the city's water budget.;   People can 'start landscaping';  
Deputy City Administrator Sandra Lizarraga is diplomatic in describing the
motivation for a proposal to roll back rationing: "We're letting people know
they can abandon their hardship practices, and they can start landscaping, but
we're also promoting wise use of water.";   Bob Bronfen, vice chairman of the
city's water commission, is blunt: "Hopefully, people will use more water.";  
Bronfen, who paid $500 for water one month last year, said he approved the new
rules reluctantly, "because I think what we really want in the long run is for
people to use less water. . . . But right now, we have to balance the
budget.";   Los Angeles never faced the kind of Draconian rationing imposed in
Santa Barbara. But with the unexpected 30 percent conservation, the Department
of Water and Power now is seeking an 11 percent rate increase and a hike in a
temporary drought surcharge, from about a penny per 83 gallons to as much as a
penny per 37 gallons.;   'The state's broke too';   "It's inevitable that when
you get substantial conservation savings you lose revenue, and you have to
make it up somehow," said Marc Reisner, author of "Cadillac Desert," a highly
acclaimed book about Western water policy.;   "I don't have an answer. You
can't look to the state. The state's broke too.";   But raising rates after
people conserve twice as much as they are asked to "makes people very
cynical," Reisner said.;   Some city council members here say the DWP should
look to its own budget for cuts to make up the loss, but Commissioner Green
says the department has cut what it can.;   "It's really the horns of a
dilemma," she said. "I don't want to cut that toilet program. But it's chewing
up our budget.";   Said Mary Nichols, the third environmentalist on the
five-member DWP board: "We're not saying, 'Use more water.' We're saying you
don't have to suffer. . . . If people are so afraid of paying a penalty that
they're not flushing toilets when they should, and not washing their hands
when they should, and spreading diseases, that's their problem -- it's not
something we're telling them to do.";   New revenue plan considered; The
problem of plummeting revenues is widespread enough that the state Public
Utilities Commission, which regulates private companies such as the San Jose
Water Co., is studying whether to develop a new revenue plan for companies
howling over their losses.;   The San Jose Water Co. has gotten approval
several times in recent years to raise its rates, according to Sharon Whaley,
a spokeswoman for the company. But the increases covered only increased costs
of buying water, she said. The company was compensated for lost revenue from
decreased sales only once, when the PUC decided last year that the company
could keep conservation penalty money it had collected.;   Even if the drought
ends, water officials say, the state is facing more rate increases to cover
the growing costs of developing new water sources and of meeting tougher
quality standards. In Southern California, the Metropolitan Water District
expects to nearly triple its water prices over the next decade to help cover a
planned $6 billion expansion.;   Excess capacity; "You can see a continued
increase in costs," said MWD general manager Carl Boronkay. "Water was cheap,
still is cheap." Because the Metropolitan Water District's system was built
big to meet needs for several decades, he said, the excess capacity of the
early years fed bad water-use habits. Eventually, conservation was inevitable,
he said, "and the time is here."  </TEXT>
