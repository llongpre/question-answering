FEW WATER-SAVING DEVICES TESTED RIGOROUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: When I buy water-saving toilet products, what should I look for? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Many water-saving products for toilets haven't received rigorous 
testing to determine long-term performance and reliability. 
</P>
<P>
Until more testing is done, we can't be sure which are the best. If you do see 
a water- or energy-saving device you think might work, consider these buyer 
tips: 
</P>
<P>
First, take your time. Don't be high-pressured into buying because of a 
one-time special price. Reputable sales people will give you time to make up 
your mind. 
</P>
<P>
Then, look at your present costs. Estimate how much of your water and sewer 
bill is due to toilet flushing. Note that toilet flushing uses more water than 
any other tap in the home. 
</P>
<P>
Once you have estimated the cost, find out the pay-back. How long will it take 
you to get your money back after you purchase the product? Will the product 
last that long? Do you plan to be in the same house that long? 
</P>
<P>
Become educated about the water-saving device. Find out about the different 
types of devices available, their cost, and their advantages and drawbacks. 
Free information should be available through libraries. You might also try 
contacting competing firms to see if they carry the same product. Estimates 
from those firms can be very useful. 
</P>
<P>
Look closely at claims. What kinds of tests are the claims based on? Was the 
testing done by an independent, recognized testing laboratory? 
</P>
<P>
Check out the business you are dealing with. It's a good idea to get estimates 
from different companies for the water-saving device you are considering. Price 
should not be the only factor in making the decision. Is this a product you can 
install yourself, or will it require a plumber? 
</P>
<P>
Contact the Better Business Bureau to find out how long the firm has been in 
business. Ask also about its record.

Solar Pool Heater Is Inexpensive, Practical 
</P>
<P>
Q: We spent $200 a month heating our swimming pool last year with natural gas. 
Could we reduce costs by using a solar pool heater? How expensive, how 
complicated, and how practical is it? 
</P>
<P>
A: They can be inexpensive, simple and very practical. Solar pool heaters let 
you dive into spring earlier and stroke deeper into fall. 
</P>
<P>
The season in the sun can stretch from three months to as many as six. Your 
energy savings will pay for the equipment and installation in just a few 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
Solar pool heaters need a large area for the solar collectors, on average, 75% 
of the surface area of the pool. A 20x30-foot pool needs 450 square feet of 
south-facing collectors. In many cases, the pump that filters the pool water 
can be used to circulate water through the collectors. 
</P>
<P>
An automatic controller turns the pump on and off as it senses heating supply 
and demand. Some installers are willing to reduce costs slightly if handy 
homeowners donate semi-skilled labor. 
</P>
<P>
And remember, a good pool cover saves money and time by keeping heat in and 
debris out. 
</P>
<P>
Refrigerator Consumes a Lot of Electricity 
</P>
<P>
Q: We went away on vacation for a month and unplugged our electric appliances 
to lower our electric bills. We also switched off the hot water heater. The 
only appliance we left plugged in was the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
Our electric bill still seemed high for that month. Can the refrigerator be 
using that much electricity? It's only two years old. 
</P>
<P>
A: Your refrigerator is the third greatest consumer of energy in the home. The 
thermostat setting can make a big difference in how much electricity it uses. 
Thermostats on refrigerators are often inaccurate. Manufacturers put arbitrary 
numbers, like one through six, rather than temperatures on the dial. 
</P>
<P>
To determine what setting to use, you'll need to find out the actual 
temperature inside the refrigerator. Put a thermometer inside the refrigerator 
compartment and look at the reading in an hour or two. Adjust the thermostat 
until you get a setting between 35-38F. 
</P>
<P>
If the freezer compartment has a separate thermostat, set it between 0-5F. 
Stand-alone freezers should be set at 0F. 
</P>
<P>
When you check the temperature inside your refrigerator, take it in several 
places. Varying temperatures may mean you need to defrost the freezer 
compartment or vacuum the dust from the coils on the back or bottom of the 
appliance. 
</P>
<P>
Dust on the coils makes the unit use more energy. If the heat can't be 
dispersed easily, the compressor has to work longer for the same benefit. 
</P>
<P>
Here are some other energy-saving tips: 
</P>
<P>
Locate the refrigerator/freezer away from the stove, dishwasher or direct 
sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
Leave four inches around the condenser coils (usually located in the back of 
the unit) for air to circulate. 
</P>
<P>
Replace leaky or broken door seals. 
</P>
<P>
Use "power saver" or "energy miser" switches unless excessive moisture buildup 
on outside surface occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Consumer Reports magazine found a 5F colder setting increased the electrical 
consumption by as much as 30%. Models with the largest freezers had the biggest 
increases. 
</P>
<P>
According to the American Homeowners Foundation (AHF), disputes often arise 
between homeowners and home-improvement contractors. 
</P>
<P>
They usually concern issues that were not discussed clearly at the time of 
hire. 
</P>
<P>
To help reduce misunderstandings -- and legal problems -- the AHF has developed 
a model contract. It alerts all parties to the areas most often resulting in 
disputes, if not addressed in advance. 
</P>
<P>
You can obtain a copy of the Model Owner-Vendor Contract ($5.95). Send a check 
or money order payable to American Homeowners Foundation to the foundation, at 
1724 S. Quincy St., Arlington, VA 22204. Additional copies are $1.95. 
Professionals can buy a set of 20 contracts for $24.95.
