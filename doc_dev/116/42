<CAPTION>  Photo; PHOTO: Jose Luis Villegas -- Mercury News; Some 2,000 tons of old
water-hogging toilets are piled up at the city Recycling Center in Palo Alto,
awaiting crushing for later use as a component of road base. The old toilets
were replaced by new ultra low-flow models that use only 1.6 gallons -- or
less -- per flush through a rebate program sponsored by the city of Palo Alto.
Response was overwhelming to the city's offer of rebates of up to $75 per
toilet to residents and businesses. In all, about 400 toilets in single-family
homes will be replaced through the pilot program, said the city's Monica
Villasenor, and there's already a waiting list of 400 in case more rebates are
offered. Applications still are being accepted to replace toilets in
businesses and multifamily dwellings.  </CAPTION>
