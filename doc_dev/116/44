<DATELINE>NICOLLET, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An $8,000 water bill run up by a toilet
that flushed non-stop for several weeks will be paid by the school
board, says Chairman Bill Hohenstein.
   ``The majority of board members thought we should pay it,''
Hohenstein said after Tuesday's Nicollet School Board meeting.
   The malfunctioning toilet, which has been fixed, is located in a
school building now used for storage. The building was supposed to
have been checked regularly, Hohenstein said.
