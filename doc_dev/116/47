<LEADPARA>  Standing on the pristine beach at Carmel River State Park, I have the eerie
feeling of knowing that a tortured drama is being played out behind a placid
surface reality.;     Two middle-age women with easels and watercolors stare
out over a stunning landscape drenched in a rich, late-afternoon light.
Against a backdrop of soft green hills, the Carmel River meanders through a
golden marsh before entering a lagoon banked by glowing white sand. The sand
is the problem. When rains are normal, the Carmel swells into a river mighty
enough to punch through the sandbar and empty itself into the Pacific. But
when the rains don't come, the river grows weak and expires just a hundred
yards from its destination.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     On the ocean side of the sandbar, steelhead heavy with eggs and sperm
gather for their historical migration up the Carmel to their freshwater
spawning grounds.;    If the river doesn't open, the steelhead, unlike salmon,
can reabsorb their eggs and sperm and return the following year. But the
Carmel has been closed for the past three years, so the steelhead indigenous
to the river are running out of time. If the stream stays closed another year
or so, says marine biologist Dean Marston, the Carmel River run of steelhead
could be lost entirely.;    The same drama is being played out at the nearby
Salinas and Pajaro rivers, as well as at up to 30 other streams up and down
the California coast.;    While their paintings reflect only the tranquillity
of the scene, the two women on the Carmel beach are well aware of the drought.
Blue Butler said she has had a water-efficient toilet installed and uses wash
water to keep her roses alive.;    Eileen Gardner, who had to apply for an
extra allotment of water when her grandson recently visited, described herself
as a conservationist who saves water not as a response to the current
emergency but "as a way of life.";    (hbox);    SANTA BARBARA -- If fish seem
helpless against the drought, consider the arsenal of weapons available to
Robert Almy, manager of the Santa Barbara County Water Agency.;    His first
line of defense is a sophisticated cloud-seeding program, which, alas, has
been of no use because there are no clouds to seed. So Almy must rely on his
next best weapon: a 3-foot "rain stick" made by Diaguita Indians in northern
Chile. When he turns the hollow stick upside down, pebbles pour over thistles
inserted along its sides, creating the patter of heavy rain.;    "It works as
well as anything," he says with a shrug and a sheepish grin.;    If there were
a capital of the drought, it could be here. Santa Barbara arguably has been
hurt more by the drought than any community so far. Because the county has no
access to state or federal water projects, it has had to rely largely on two
reservoirs. Now one of those is bone dry, and the other has, at best, a
one-year supply of water.;    Through voluntary but pressured conservation,
Santa Barbara has cut water use 45 percent without actual rationing.;    A key
element of the conservation program is a steeply ascending rate structure in
which per-unit water costs increase 800 percent for heavy users. Another
element is a force of "drought cops" who patrol the town in white vans,
dispensing tips on how to save water and issuing $250 citations to those who
squander it.;    The city gives away low-flow shower heads and provides $80
rebates on low-flow toilets, which cost about $110 and use 1.6 gallons of
water per flush rather than the seven gallons used by normal toilets. City
spokeswoman Lisa Weeks said 14,000 toilets already have been replaced.;    On
the drawing boards is a huge desalination plant that would -- at a high cost
-- provide much of the city's water needs. Until that is built, there seems
little the city can do but hope Almy figures out how to use that rain stick.  </TEXT>
