   Pittsburgh braced for a long-term water crisis
Monday as a slow-moving fuel spill snaked down the Allegheny River,
threatening supplies to as many as 1 million people.
   ``I think it's very possible the worst of this is yet to come,''
said the city's public safety director, Glenn Cannon. ``There's no
end to it.''
   A hospital served meals on paper plates, supermarkets sold out
of bottled water, schools closed and a steel plant trucked in water
to flush its toilets.
   A landslide late Friday severed an underground 10-inch-wide
pipeline near Freeport, 35 miles north of Pittsburgh. The pipe
spilled between 75,000 and 300,000 gallons of gasoline, diesel fuel
and kerosene into the river.
   Like tumbling dominoes, water companies along the Allegheny were
forced to close the intakes of their water treatment plants one by
one as the 20-mile-long spill oozed toward Pittsburgh, reaching the
city early Monday evening. Some were able to reopen Monday as the
spill became more diluted and the water could be treated with
filters.
   The Pittsburgh Water Department, which serves 450,000 people,
still was drawing water from the river and boosting its reservoirs
Monday afternoon but was preparing to close its intakes at any
moment.
   If the spill ``should move suddenly, we'll have to shut the
plant,'' said Mayor Sophie Masloff.
   Pittsburgh gets only part of its water from the Allegheny, and
had enough reserves to last three to five days, said Cannon. ``The
long-term impact could be devastating,'' he said.
   Up to 20,000 residents served by the Harrison Township Water
Authority have been without water since Saturday and depended on
National Guard portable water tanks set up to provide drinking and
cooking water.
   Orders to conserve water were issued to at least 400,000 other
people served by various other water authorities northeast of
Pittsburgh.
   At least nine school districts closed Monday, idling more than
21,000 students, and many businesses were affected by the spill.
   State emergency officials trucked in water to replenish a
45,000-gallon reservoir at Allegheny Valley Hospital, which draws
its water from the river. The hospital used paper plates and cups
to serve meals to its 225 patients, closed its laundry and was
sending dirty linens to another hospital.
   Drinking water was trucked in for the 2,600 employees of the
Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp. specialty steel plant in nearby
Brackenridge, and some was used to flush toilets, said company
spokesman Bert Delano.
   At Marshall's Amoco station in Natrona Heights about 30 miles
northeast of Pittsburgh, the taps and the car wash went dry Sunday
afternoon, said attendant Laurie Maycock.
   ``Nothing happens when you turn the tap on,'' she said. ``But
it's not so bad. It's raining, so no one wants to wash their car
anyway.''
   Like many supermarkets in the area, the Shop'N Save in Natrona
Heights quickly sold out of 150 cases of bottled water Monday
morning.
   ``That's the thing about water,'' said manager Bill Rossey.
``You don't miss it until it's gone.''
   The thick, gel-like spill, estimated to be 5 to 21 feet deep,
moved almost imperceptibly at times. At its fastest, it moved half
a mile an hour.
   ``It's almost as if it stops and takes a rest somewhere,'' said
John Kaus of the Allegheny County Emergency Management Agency.
   Booms stretched across the river were having little effect, and
recovered less than 10,000 gallons because most of the fuel was
well below the surface, Kaus said.
   About 100 workers from Buckeye Pipeline Co. and two contractors
worked Monday to clean up the leak, said Roy Haase Jr. of Buckeye
Pipeline. Below the source of the leak, crews built a dam on Knapp
Run Creek to collect fuel flowing from the oil-soaked soil.
   The landslide prevented workers from reaching the broken
pipeline, but the danger of an explosion has been minimized by rain
and wind, Haase said.
   Officials said some fish and other aquatic life were killed, but
said it was too early to determine the extent of environmental
damage.
