   A group of California's biggest urban water suppliers
agreed to implement conservation measures that will ease, but
by no means quench, the drought-plagued state's huge thirst.
   The suppliers include the agencies that provide water to
about 80% of California's 30 million people, including
inhabitants of Los Angeles and San Francisco. Under the
agreement, the agencies will promote or demand such
water-saving steps as indoor and outdoor water audits,
water-efficient plumbing fixtures such as low-flow shower
heads and low-flush toilets, leak-detection programs and
landscaping water conservation ordinances.

   California is heading into its sixth year of withering
drought. The accord's backers, including Gov. Pete Wilson's
administration, hailed it as an important drought-fighting
measure that will save as much as one million acre feet of
water each year. (An acre foot is 326,000 gallons.)
   However, that savings would be a small drop in a rather
large bucket: California sops up 34 million acre feet of
water each year. Moreover, urban and industrial users consume
only about 15% of California's water; the rest is guzzled by
agriculture. The state and various federal agencies and
officials are grappling with proposals that would reduce
farmers' disproportionate share of water usage, but farmers
are resisting them.
   Barring deluges, agriculture's heavy water usage and the
state's relentless population growth assures that California
will continue to struggle with water shortages, no matter how
much urban water suppliers conserve.
