   Americans are flushing too much of a precious
resource down the toilet, say two lawmakers who are pushing for
strict water-flow standards on household plumbing fixtures.
   Manufacturers are fighting the congressional attempt to impose
first-ever federal efficiency standards on toilets, shower heads and
other fixtures.
   The average American uses more than 18,000 gallons of water a
year in the home _ about 50 gallons a day. Of that, 40 percent goes
down the drain from toilets, said Rep. Chester G. Atkins, D-Mass.
   ``The amount that is used unnecessarily is staggering, especially
in light of the fact that new technology to improve performance of
water-saving products is commercially available,'' he said.
   Atkins and Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., have drafted legislation
that would mandate national water efficiency standards for household
plumbing fixtures such as faucets, washing machines, dishwashers,
shower heads and toilets.
   The largest savings would come from better toilets.
   Only one state, Massachusetts, has imposed toilet efficiency
standards.
   Amy Vickers, project manager at the Massachusetts Water Resource
Authority, estimates that the new 1.6 gallons-per-flush state
standard, which took effect earlier this month, will save the
typical Boston household $70 a year.
   Older toilets typically use 5 gallons of water per flush; newer
models, 3.5 gallons.
   Massachusetts' standard will save the state about 70 million
gallons of water daily by early in the 21st century, Ms. Vickers
projected.
   On a national scale, that would mean a savings of 2 billion to 3
billion gallons of water a day from the most efficient toilets, she
said.
   Proponents of low-flow standards say they could eliminate the
need for building expensive water supplies and water-treatment
facilities, especially in big cities such as Boston and New York
where officials already are worrying about balancing limited water
supplies against ever-increasing demand.
   Toilet manufacturers oppose the legislation, saying it would
create an unnecessary bureaucracy and amount to an improper
intrusion by Washington into an area that has been traditionally
handled by local governments.
   ``It puts the federal government for the first time directly into
the process of writing building codes and standards. And the federal
government, for the last 200 and some-odd years, has tried very hard
to stay out of that process and leave it to the states and local
communities,'' said Richard Church, president of the Plumbing
Manufacturers Institute.
   Church said it would be dangerous to ``force manufacturers to
bring that technology out before it's completely tested,''
especially for installing the more efficient ``water closets'' _ as
the industry still calls toilets _ in older houses.
   ``We're quite concerned that in specific localities there's apt
to be severe problems if 1.6 (gallons-per-flush toilets) are the
only ones available,'' said Church. ``You're asking for problems.''
   ``Water closets are flushed with gravity. At 1.6 gallons, we're
right on the edge of what gravity can actually do,'' he said.
   But proponents of the legislation scoff at the suggestion that
the bill's 1992 deadline for more efficient toilets would be
difficult for the industry to meet.
   ``This isn't like trying to go to the moon,'' said Ms. Vickers.
   The two leading U.S. toilet manufacturers, American Standard and
Kohler Co., are fighting the legislation.
   Although the toilet provision has drawn the most controversy, the
legislation is, as an Atkins aide, Rob Henken, says, ``by no means
just a toilet bill.''
   The proposal would set a 2.5 gallons-per-minute standard for
shower heads and kitchen faucets, a 2 gallons-per-minute standard
for bathroom faucets and a 1 gallon-per-flush standard for urinals,
Henken said.
   Those requirements would take effect in January 1991, a year
before the standard for toilets, he said.
   The bill also would require the Energy Department, within three
years of enactment, to set water efficiency standards for washing
machines and dishwashers.
