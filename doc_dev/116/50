   Huge oil tankers steaming along the
Pacific coast from Alaska could be joined next year by ships
carrying water to drought-stricken Southern California, city
officials said Friday.
   Water has become so scarce in Santa Barbara that it's a crime
for a homeowner to hose down his lawn. The gives away low-flow
shower heads and offers $80 each to people who switch from
big-flush to small-flush toilets.
   The water tanker idea is one of three being considered by the
city to ease the drought, said city spokesman Pete Ramsdell.
   The city is negotiating with three companies on a proposal to
import thousands of gallons from Canada. Another idea is to
construct a $50 million desalination plant that would turn sea
water into drinking water, said Ramsdell.
   The city staff will recommend to the City Council on July 31
which idea is worth pursuing further, Ramsdell said.
   Santa Barbara is not connected to either Northern California or
Colorado River supplies and must rely entirely on local sources for
water. Thus it has been the Southern California city hardest hit by
the region's 4-year-old drought.
   City officials made it clear earlier this year they would listen
to just about anyone with an idea on how to get them more water.
   That's where the water tanker idea came in, Ramsdell said.
Proposals rom two Canadian companies and a Santa Barbara firm are
currently being studied.
   Officials of the local company, Sun Belt Water Inc., met with
city officials Friday, said Richard Schuller, the company's
president.
   The company has proposed using tankers to bring in 14,000
acre-feet of water per trip from British Columbia's Toba Inlet.
   Sun Belt's partner in the deal, British Columbia-based water
bottler Snowcap Ltd., is one of several companies already licensed
by the Canadian province to export fresh water.
   Ramsdell said the city, which used about 16,000 acre-feet of
water a year before the drought, wants to import at least 5,000
acre-feet a year of water.
   Schuller, noting his company proposed bringing in far more than
that, said the rest could be sold to other water users in Santa
Barbara County.
   Schuller said his company made an initial bid of $2,700 per
acre-foot. The costs would cover installing terminals in Canada and
California for drawing and unloading the water, he said.
   ``We would own the facilities and operate the ships,'' he said.
