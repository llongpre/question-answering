<TEXT>     In a no-nonsense water policy under review, families that use more than
about 11,000 gallons per month would pay four to 10 times more for the overuse
than they now pay.;    Under rates adopted last year to discourage overuse, a
family that uses, for example, 15,000 gallons in a month pays about $19 plus a
service charge of from $3 to $4.;    The same use will cost $42 to $87, plus
the service charge, if tougher rates are adopted.;    The exact figure depends
on which overuse fee is part of the 1991 version of the city's water reduction
program.;    Two figures have been suggested by city staff. One is $10 and the
other is $25 per 1,000 gallons used in excess of 11,000 gallons per month.;   
Little leverage in old rates;  Nearly 90 percent of Gilroy households used
12,000 gallons or less in February, according to city records.;    But they
were charged under rates adopted last year, which were not high enough to
discourage overuse, City Administrator Jay Baksa said.;    Whether stricter
penalties for overuse go into effect soon won't be known until Santa Clara
Valley Water District officials map out conservation mandates for 1991, Baksa
said.;    A workshop between city and district officials is scheduled for 7
p.m. today at City Hall to discuss conservation guidelines.;    In the
meantime, the city council on Monday was scheduled to discuss and possibly act
on two other aspects of the new guidelines and suggestions.;    One is use of
gray water from bathtubs and sinks for plants and toilet flushing.;    The
other is elimination of turf areas in the city.;    To cut water use, parks
and recreation director Bob Connelly has recommended elimination of about 20
acres of turf.;    Flow restricters a possibility;  Areas affected could
include the golf course, the civic and community centers, the police
department and fire stations, the museum and most city parks.;    The new plan
also could mean mandatory installation of flow restricters on all private and
public faucets, toilets and shower heads.;    A city task force recommended
that Gilroy provide households and businesses with such devices and pay for
installation. The estimated cost is nearly $380,000.;    In addition, the new
water conservation proposals could mean no new street trees and the shutting
off of some public drinking fountains.  </TEXT>
