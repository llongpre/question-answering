<LEADPARA>  In California, homes in the hottest cities have green lawns and no water
meters. Taxpayer-subsidized water floods fields of taxpayer-subsidized cotton.
Countless acres of irrigated pasture and hay -- feed for 3 million cattle --
actually soak up more water than the state's 30 million people.;    California
has gotten away with a remarkably inefficient use of its water because,
normally, there is more than enough to go around. And gallons to squander.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  'PERESTROIKA FOR WATER': DROUGHT INSPIRES
REVOLUTION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     But as California wilts into a fifth consecutive dry year, there are signs
of permanent change -- not just quick-fix drought remedies. A revolution is
taking place in the way California distributes its most precious commodity.;  
 "What we're advocating is perestroika for water," said Richard Howitt, an
agricultural economics professor at the University of California, Davis. "The
value of water has finally become apparent to Californians, and people are
realizing we have to be a lot more flexible about how it is used.";   
Officials now acknowledge that California can't afford many new dams and
aqueducts, which have become financially and environmentally unpalatable. What
California can do is compromise, conserve and trade to get water where it's
needed most.;    Even during this devastating drought, California has plenty
of water. But it's distributed unevenly. Agriculture, which makes up 3 percent
of the economy and employs 1 percent of the workforce, consumes about 84
percent of the water used -- enough to supply 280 cities the size of San Jose,
the state's third-largest city. Everyone else shares what is left.;    It
wouldn't take draconian measures to change the water equation. University of
California studies show tougher urban conservation and an 8 percent cut to
farms would ensure enough water for wildlife, crops and people -- including
700,000 more of us each year for 30 years.;    "Agriculture can make the cuts
without causing Armageddon," said Assemblyman Phil Isenberg, D-Sacramento, who
long tried to lead the Legislature on water reform.;    Innovations; from the
south;    The most creative water solutions so far have come from Southern
California, which lost some water from Mono Lake and the Colorado River and is
more desperate than Northern California.;    The Metropolitan Water District,
which has its headquarters in Los Angeles and serves 15 million Southern
Californians, plans to create a "water bank" for use in dry years by storing
surplus water underground near Bakersfield in Kern County. Although many urban
areas, including the Santa Clara Valley, have stored water in sand and gravel
formations for years, the Metropolitan Water District project marks the first
time that urban areas have tapped far-away farms for storage.;    In another
unusual project, the district will pay farmers in the Palo Verde Valley near
the Colorado River to let their fields lay fallow in drought years; in return,
the district could take their water for urban areas.;    The district has even
figured out a way to capture irrigation water that is simply evaporating or
leaching through the sand in the scorching Imperial Valley. The district spent
$120 million to build concrete ditches, new sprinkler systems and other
equipment to help farmers in the southeast corner of the state conserve water.
In exchange, the district gets to take the water it saves, some 36 billion
gallons each year, enough for 200,000 homes.;    The Metropolitan Water
District hopes to triple its current Imperial Valley project within the next
two years, General Manager Carl Boronkay said.;    "It sounds like a lot of
money, but $125 an acre-foot is a good deal for us," Boronkay said. "We know
the farmers pay less, but they have the historic rights to the water. We
don't.";    Enlisting cooperation; from state's farmers;    Farmers are
realizing that they can profit by reselling their water to cities instead of
using it to irrigate crops. Thanks to tax subsidies, farmers buy water for as
little as $3.50 an acre-foot while urban water districts are willing to pay up
to $230. And in some coastal communities, like Morro Bay, residents are about
to pay $3,000 an acre-foot for desalinated ocean water.;    Most farmers get
their cheap water through 40- and 100-year contracts that guarantee rights to
reservoir water from state and federal programs, primarily the Central Valley
Water Project.;    "To farmers, their water rights are more valuable than
their land," said Mary Ann Warmerden, natural resources director for the
California Farm Bureau. "They don't intend to give up those rights. But they
are more and more interested in being flexible and selling what they don't
need.";    Breaking down; the legal barriers;    Ironically, state and federal
laws make water trading tough. Farmers who belong to the Central Valley
Project in the San Joaquin Valley, for example, are forbidden from selling
water outside the area under a 50-year-old law that says the water can be used
only for crops.;    To make water trading easier, Sacramento lawmakers are
trying to circumvent water policies engraved in the California landscape for
more than 100 years.;    "The Legislature has been scared to death of (water
marketing)," said Marc Reisner, an expert on Western water policy and author
of the book "Cadillac Desert." "Only in the fifth year of drought do we see
some leadership emerge. Now that everybody is panicking, they might get
somewhere.";    Since the drought began, only a handful of trades have been
made in California's tight water market.;    More and more urban water
districts, including Santa Clara Valley and San Francisco, have become
frightened by the drought projections and are clamoring to find farmers able
to sell.;    "We're on a shopping spree," said Joe Judge, a member of the
Santa Clara Valley Water District board. "If anyone can get us 26 billion
gallons of water, we'll take it.";    This year, farmers will transfer 500,000
acre-feet to cities, according to Howitt of UC-Davis. "That's not nearly the
potential, but it's a lot, considering that no agricultural water went to
cities five years ago.";    Voices against; marketing of water;    At least
one person, Rep. George Miller, D-Martinez, is outraged at the widespread
acceptance of water trading.;    "Taxpayers have spent billions of dollars to
develop the water resources, the canals, the dams, for these farmers," said
Miller, acting chairman of the House Interior Committee. "Now, to suggest that
farmers can turn around and sell that water for a profit is a major insult to
taxpayers.";    Miller hopes to pass legislation this year that would instead
limit water subsidies to large farms, forcing agriculture to pay more for
water in hope that it would be used more efficiently.;    The Natural
Resources Defense Council is taking a different approach in a lawsuit that
seeks to prevent the federal government from renewing farmers' 40-year federal
water contracts without first assessing the environmental effects of diverting
water to crops.;    The council says areas like the Sacramento Delta shouldn't
be drained, and low-value, water-loving crops, like alfalfa, rice and cotton,
shouldn't be grown in hot, desert climates.;    "Most of these marginal lands
should be out of production," said Sami Yassa, a research associate in the
council's San Francisco office. "We shouldn't stay with a 50-year-old water
system just because we've always done it that way. There's no excuse for using
water inefficiently anymore.";    The costs of cutting; farmers' water;  Not
everyone advocates diverting water from agriculture. Runoff from overwatered
fields is essential for some rivers and wetlands. And if cropland is left
fallow, there could be severe economic hardships in small communities
dependent on farming jobs.;    "Rural economies and towns could dry up," said
Henry Vaux, director of the Water Resources Center at the University of
California, Riverside. "Considerable attention must be paid to those . . .
effects.";    The one solution; with no ill effects;  Water analysts say the
safest way to ensure California a plentiful water supply is permanent
conservation: low-flush toilets, low-water landscaping, extra plumbing to use
reclaimed sewage to water lawns.;    A few independent irrigation districts
have launched efforts to reduce their water consumption, spurred by the
drought and contamination problems caused by too much runoff from
selenium-laden soil.;    This month, the Firebaugh Canal District, near
Interstate 5 south of Los Banos, hopes to encourage water conservation with a
new tiered pricing system: the more water a farmer uses, the more expensive it
gets. Agricultural water was so plentiful and cheap in the past, that it
actually cost more to install water-saving irrigation systems than to waste
water.;    State Sen. Dan Boatwright, D-Concord, has introduced a bill that
would mandate water meters in all new development in California by January
1992. Today, virtually no major city in the San Joaquin Valley, where
per-capita water use is the highest in the state at 300 gallons per day, has
homes or businesses where water use is even measured. In Sacramento,
homeowners pay a flat $7.50 a month and can let the tap run all day.;   
"Conservation isn't sexy," said Rick Battson, an aide to Isenberg. "Building
dams and aqueducts is exciting stuff. But low-flush toilets, you don't get
named after them. The water engineers now have to switch gears from the big
things to the mundane."  </TEXT>
