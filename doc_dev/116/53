QUESTION: All summer long our toilet tank sweats and drips water, especially 
when it's humid. We've tried several products, but they only work for short 
periods. One plumber suggested that we hook up the tank to the hot-water line, 
but others had never heard of this. Who's right? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The plumber knows his business. When warm, moist room air hits your 
water-cooled tank and bowl, condensation forms. Tell your plumber to install a 
mixing valve that will flush your toilet with room-temperature water (not 
straight hot water). The valve can be adjusted to maintain the correct water 
temperature without wasting hot water.

Urethene Foam Not Recommended for Attic 
</P>
<P>
Q: My insulation installer recommended urethane foam in my attic. He claims 
that 1 inch of urethane will equate an R-30 value. He claims that's a lot 
better than fiberglass because 6 inches of fiberglass can't get anywhere near 
that R-value. But I have heard that plastic foams should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
A: You'd better change installers. Never even consider using foam in the attic. 
The material was developed for use in walls or on flat roofs (mainly commercial 
ones). By the way, don't confuse all "foams" with urea-formaldehyde, which the 
Consumer Product Safety Commission has deemed harmful to your health. Most 
foams, however, are flammable and certain precautions must be taken.

Interior Room Vapors Cause Blisters on Siding 
</P>
<P>
Q: We installed redwood siding 26 years ago, and painted it with the best 
exterior oil paint. Every spring since, paint blisters and red stains appear. 
We've sanded the siding and applied latex paint over the best undercoat 
available. But we still have the same blistering, peeling and red stain 
problem. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: I believe interior room moisture (vapor) is passing through your walls and 
popping the paint. You need to treat the interior walls so warm, moist air 
won't pass through to the outside. 
</P>
<P>
Apply an interior paint designed to minimize the flow of moisture, or place a 
polyethylene vapor barrier between the studs and the drywall. Once you've 
corrected the moisture problem, scrape off the blistered paint and sand the 
wood bare. Prime the blistered area with an oil-base primer, then repaint the 
entire area. Note: Primers containing zinc are sensitive to water and should 
not be used on redwood. 
</P>
<P>
Latex or other water-base primers should not be used on woods containing 
water-soluble extractives (natural moisture that can be drawn out), such as 
redwood or cedar. The water in the primer base will cause bleeding stains. 
Latex top coats may be applied over an oil primer.

Seek Engineer's Advice Before Moving Column 
</P>
<P>
Q: A support column in my basement is right in the way of my new pool table. Is 
there any way to remove that column without causing a sag in the floor above? 
</P>
<P>
A: As your drawing shows a girder joint over the column in question, I believe 
that removing the column would cause total collapse. Your problem can be 
corrected, but to make absolutely certain you should seek the services of a 
professional engineer.
