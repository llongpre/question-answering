<LEADPARA>  Palo Alto officials are touting small measures to save huge amounts of water
as the drought drags on.;    The programs would eventually reduce Palo Alto's
water consumption by 5 to 10 percent, saving billions of gallons, said Debbie
Katz, the city's energy services manager.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The city's staff has developed 10 new water-saving programs that will go
before the city council Monday. These include incentives to encourage
businesses to use drought-tolerant landscaping and a system to irrigate parks
with treated sewer water.;    "The potential water that could be saved is
still only scratching the surface," said Katz. "But these are certain things
that are easy to do and smart to do.";    Palo Alto, which operates its own
water department and gets all its water from San Francisco's Hetch Hetchy
system, has been struggling with other Northern California cities to cope with
mandatory cuts.;    These long-term solutions, which could be implemented
starting this year, would cost the city $4 million to $6 million. Customers
can expect a rate increase as a result. But the increase is expected to be
nominal, Katz said.;    The programs are part of the city's urban water
management plan, which by state law must be updated this year. These are the
programs that could be established:;    (check) Creating incentives to use
drought-tolerant landscaping throughout the city. Landscape irrigation
consumes almost 35 percent of Palo Alto's water supply. The program could
encourage businesses to use fewer non-native plants and to maintain smaller
lawns. If irrigation were cut in half, about 135 million gallons of water a
year could be saved, the report said.;    But this program could not start
until the drought ends. In fact, the city is discouraging new plantings during
the drought because young plants need more water than mature ones, Katz said.;
   (check) Using reclaimed water. Palo Alto already plans to use treated
sewage water to irrigate Greer Park. But treated effluent could also be used
for other irrigation, wetlands maintenance, cooling and toilet flushing.
Treated water could also be transported to Stanford University.;    Palo Alto
is already developing a $150,000 master plan for reclaimed water. Using
treated wastewater could save 224 million to 524 million gallons a year, the
report said.;    (check) Using city wells for large landscaping projects. Palo
Alto owns four wells that can supply about one-fourth of the city's water. The
well water, which is of lower quality than that from Hetch Hetchy, could be
used for park irrigation. This program would not necessarily save water. It
would merely save high-quality water by substituting lower-quality water.;   
(check) Encouraging city facilities to use less water. The city could install
more efficient sprinkler systems in parks and the golf course, and
water-saving faucets and cooling systems in city buildings. That could save
the city 89.8 million gallons annually.;    (check) Customizing water programs
for major accounts. The city could work more closely with large commercial and
industrial customers on individual water conservation measures. If these
customers cut indoor water use by one-quarter, the city could save 1.1 billion
gallons a year.;    (check) Encouraging apartment dwellers to use less water.
The city would lobby apartment managers to install low-flow shower heads and
to meter apartments separately. This could save about 10.7 million gallons
annually.;    (check) Encouraging households to conserve. If indoor use were
cut by a quarter, the city could save 47.9 million gallons a year.;    (check)
Urging small businesses to conserve and offering them rebates to install
water-saving equipment. If water use were cut by one-fourth, the city would
save about 9 million gallons annually.;    (check) Making schools aware of
conservation programs, which could save about 15 million gallons a year.;   
(check) Encouraging stores to stock water-efficient products.  </TEXT>
