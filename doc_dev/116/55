   Having toilets to flush and safe water to
drink will help end Third World conditions in the impoverished
``colonias'' along the Mexican border, community activists
celebrating voter approval of a water plan said Wednesday.
   Seven years of organizing and lobbying paid off with Tuesday's
passage of Proposition 2, said Amalia Lerma, a leader of Valley
Interfaith, a coalition of 36 churches in the Lower Rio Grande
Valley.
   A network of church-based groups throughout the state have pushed
for improved conditions in the substandard rural subdivisions for
years, including the statewide water amendment.
   Two things most Americans take for granted _ drinking water and
sewer lines _ will arrive for the first time for thousands of
colonia residents, Mrs. Lerma said.
   ``Peope will have toilets to flush,'' she said. ``It's not a
joke. This will make a big difference in people's lives.''
   Sewer systems particularly will help curb the incidence of such
``Third World'' diseases as hepatitis, tuberculosis, dysentery and
other gastrointestinal illnesses in the colonias, Mrs. Lerma said.
   The amendment authorizes a $500 million bond package for water
projects, sewer systems and flood control statewide. The colonias
are to get $100 million of the bond revenues.
   The measure passed by a vote of 686,475, or 60 percent, to
462,582, or 40 percent, of the ballots cast.
   More than 100,000 people are estimated to be living in colonias,
which often are carved out of farmland by real estate developers who
offer homes for down payments of as low as $100, but never install
adequate water, sewers, streets or drainage.
   Outhouses in back yards are common sights in colonias. Most homes
have drinking water but it is not unusual for the water system to be
contaminated or limited to a single outdoor faucet in the front
yards.
   Carmen Anaya, who has lived in Las Milpas, a colonia south of
Pharr in the Lower Rio Grande Valley for more than 30 years, said
Wednesday that the amendment's passage reminded her of the biblical
story of a man who said he could die contented after seeing Jesus.
   ``Last night, I went to church and I told God, `Thank you, but I
don't want to die. I want to keep working,''' said Mrs. Anaya, who
spent Tuesday hauling colonia residents to the polls in a tiny
Chevrolet Chevette.
   ``My greatest desire was that our children have water, so they
could bathe and go to school without being covered with dust from
the streets and being rejected by the other children,'' she said.
