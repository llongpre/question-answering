DIAPER SERVICES ARE ANSWER TO POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your Consumer Affairs column, "Needed: A Disposable/Cloth Diaper Hybrid" (Nov. 
16), concluded with the theme that a natural solution is still required. The 
proven solution to diaper pollution is offered by a professional diaper 
service. 
</P>
<P>
At Dydee Diaper Service in Orange, of which I am president, we use a special 
10-step process for laundering soiled diapers that includes several flushings, 
sudsings and rinsings using only 88% pure soap. This process generates about 4 
1/2 gallons of waste water per child per day, less than the water used in one 
average toilet flush, and four times less than the amount of water a parent 
would use if they were to flush the solid waste from their disposable diapers 
as the package recommends. 
</P>
<P>
As for fuel conservation, Dydee's delivery trucks are powered by clean burning 
propane, compared to the fuel used to deliver the trees from the forest (more 
than 2 million a year) to produce disposable diapers, to deliver them to retail 
stores and to take the soiled disposable diaper to the landfill, plus the 
powered machinery used to level the trash there. 
</P>
<P>
To conserve energy, we use special equipment that reclaims heat from our dryers 
and waste water. 
</P>
<P>
Disposable diapers create 90 times more solid waste than a reusable cotton 
diaper. For every baby in cotton diapers, more than a ton of paper diaper waste 
is diverted from landfills. Environmental groups will always recommend a 
reusable product over a single-use one.
