   When the shuttle Columbia returns to
Earth on Friday, scientists will spend weeks debriefing the
astronauts, but an engineer dubbed Dr. Flush will be interested in
only one thing: How did the toilet work?
   Don Rethke, a mechanical engineer at Hamilton Standard for 27
years, is hard at work refining a space toilet that he says will
solve the delicate problems that have plagued astronauts since the
early days of space exploration: how to cope with zero gravity,
limited storage and, well, the smell when answering nature's call
in space.
   ``We wanted it to be more earthlike,'' Rethke said recently as
he showed off a prototype of his commode during an interview in his
cramped research trailer _ about half the size of the shuttle cabin.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has already
given Rethke's design its preliminary approval, but the five
Columbia crew members will be quizzed when they return and their
reports passed on to Rethke so he and his assistants can further
refine the commode.
   ``It's going to be a pretty user-friendly type system,'' said
Eugene Winkler of NASA's shuttle support team at the Johnson Space
Center in Houston. ``We've put the best minds in the country
together on this new potty, so I think it should work out pretty
well.''
   Hamilton Standard, which has been designing space suits for NASA
since the 1960s, last year won a $35 million contract to design a
toilet that will meet the demands of larger crews and longer
missions.
   Rethke's commode will be installed on the ``extended-duration
orbiter'' shuttle to be launched in March 1992 for 16 days, but is
ultimately headed for the space station Freedom, an orbiting
laboratory where astronauts will live for months at a time later
this decade.
   The aeronautics division of the giant defense contractor United
Technologies Corp., Hamilton Standard lost a fierce competition
with General Electric to design space commodes in the early 1970s,
but got a second chance after GE dropped out of the space-waste
game. The firm last year also won the maintenance contract for the
disposal system now in use.
   Things have come a long way since that day in 1961 when Alan B.
Shepard Jr. wet his space suit as he sat helplessly strapped in his
Freedom 7 capsule atop a Redstone rocket, waiting to become the
first American launched into space.
   During the Gemini and Apollo programs, astronauts urinated into
cups that were just dumped into space; they used stick-on plastic
bags for solid waste they carried back to Earth, Winkler said.
   It was all very messy, smelly and uncomfortable, and ``zero
hygiene for the astronauts who went to the moon,'' Rethke said.
   The shuttles have had improved commodes that resemble portable
toilets, but the accommodations are still pretty Spartan. Capacity
is a problem and the astronauts have to use the same bowl that
can't be flushed, Rethke said.
   Rethke's aim for the space toilet was simple: make it
comfortable and clean.
   His commode looks much like the ordinary toilet, but instead of
water, there are individual collection bags for solid waste. Urine
is funneled into a separate container and will be chemically
treated for ``hygienic use'' _ washing, but not drinking water.
   The commode, in a closet similar to the cramped restrooms on
commercial jetliners, has biodegradable wipes, a rearview mirror to
help astronauts with delicate manuevers and padded bars to hold
them in place.
   A vacuum-like device solves the zero-gravity problem by drawing
the waste downward, also controlling ordor and bacteria.
   Instead of flushing, the astronauts will simply press a button
after they are done. The collection bags are then automatically
sealed, moved along a metal track and dropped into a compacter that
can hold a week's worth of waste from four astronauts, Rethke said.
When full, the 25-inch, fiberglass cannister is stored on board and
replaced with a fresh one.
   Each astronaut inserts a fresh bag for the next user.
   Rethke's devotion to his space toilet has spurred more than a
little ribbing from colleagues and he rarely makes it through the
day without hearing a potty joke.
   He frequently appears at company functions with his ``Dr.
Flush'' kit, including a taped bathroom noises, a white jacket
emblazoned with his ``Dr. Flush'' logo, and a toilet seat featuring
a stained-glass image of the shuttle.
   ``It has a lot of personal satisfaction from the point of view
that you're helping mankind,'' Rethke said. ``And it is extremely
serious for the astronauts. ... We have to make extremely sure it
works right.''
