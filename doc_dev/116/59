   On the road hardly means roughing it as
truckers haul their own chandeliers, fax machines and microwave
ovens along with products going to market across country.
   ``You can just about put anything you want in there,'' said
Steve Bombela of United Truck and Body in Des Moines, which makes
cabs and does customizing for semi-trucks.
   The longer cabs contain a sleeping unit behind the front seat
that can be furnished with just about anything a trucker can dream
up.
   Steve Blunt, 37, president of Steve Blunt Trucking Inc. of Des
Moines, owns ``The Bird,'' a 70-foot long customized Kenworth
Aerodyne. He spent $70,000 getting the truck just the way he wanted
it.
   It is painted with two, 17-foot, air-brushed blue firebirds from
the hood to the tip of the trailer. The sleeper has a bath with
shower, foldaway tables, a central vacuuming system and a kitchen
with sink, two-burner stove, microwave and customized cabinets.
There are refrigerators in both the cab and the sleeper.
   The sleeping compartment for two has a 15-inch remote control
color television, a VCR and a cellular telephone.
   A stereo system with 28 speakers provides cruising music.
   ``You've got to have some tunes,'' said Blunt, whose drivers
transport boxed beef to New York City and Boston.
   He likes the shower best.
   More husband and wife teams are buying the big cabs since
deregulation eased restrictions on truck length, according to
Kenworth Mid-Iowa in Des Moines. About 10 percent of the company's
business is in the big Kenworth Aerodyne.
   The cab and sleeper costs $90,000 to $100,000, without extras,
and is about the fanciest cab sold. It also is the largest,
measuring 110 inches by 96 inches. It comes with a button and tuck
padded interior and upper and lower bunks and a full-sized 42-inch
bed.
   Bombela said his deluxe cabs and sleepers cost about $25,000.
For that price, Bombela's company installs a shower, a microwave,
refrigerator, color television, flush toilet, sink, oak cabinets,
water holding tanks and generator. For a little extra money, they
will install water beds.
   ``We put in showers, flush toilets, computers, fax machines ...
even chandeliers.''
   But some truckers don't like the big cabs despite the added
comfort, he said. The large units, with extras, can add a thousand
pounds, a concern for truckers faced with weight limitations. And
the trucks are more difficult to drive because the wheel base is
stretched to accommodate the sleepers, he said.
   Paul Swesey, 27, of Panora, spent $40,000 to customize his truck
because he ``likes the show.''
   Swesey is a household goods mover and spends more than
three-quarters of the year on the road, sometimes not getting home
for months at a time.
   ``I go into a neighborhood and all the people want to see it.
They've never seen a truck like this one before,'' he said.
   It has a fax machine, phone and modem, computer with dual disk
drives, printer, microwave, sink with hot and cold water, portable
toilet, built in alarm clock, television and VCR with wireless
remote. The central vacuuming system is ``really slick,'' he said.
   He also has a 5-kilowatt generator ``so even when it's 20 below
you can stay nice and warm without idling the engine,'' he said.
