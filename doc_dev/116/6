   Sen. Wyche Fowler's plan to save water by
legislating more efficient toilets isn't going down well with
plumbers and toilet makers, who contend the public is more
concerned with toilet performance than water consumption.
   ``Conservation efforts will ultimately fail if proper regard is
not given to the reasonable public demand for sound performance
standards in water supply and waste disposal,'' said George Bliss,
assistant director of training for the United Association of
Plumbers and Pipefitters.
   Bliss testified Wednesday at a hearing before the Senate
Commerce consumer subcommittee on legislation introduced by Fowler,
D-Ga., and Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., to set national water
efficiency standards for toilets and other plumbing fixtures.
   The legislation would require that all new toilets installed
beginning in 1992 use only 1.6 gallons of water per flush. State
and local building codes generally have required a 3.5 gallon
standard since the early 1970s.
   ``When the amount of water is cut in half, there is reason to
doubt whether the system will operate properly,'' Bliss said,
arguing Congress should not act until more research is done on such
issues as ``to what extent will bowl staining become a factor due
to low flush.''
   Fowler said concerns such as those raised by Bliss are nothing
more than ``red herrings.'' He said toilets that meet the 1.6
gallon per flush standard, as well as other efficient plumbing
fixtures, already exist and ``are proven to work.''
   Supporters of the legislation told the Senate panel that in the
past year, seven states with 40 percent of the nation's population
have adopted standards requiring that new toilets use only 1.6
gallons per flush.
   ``There is no evidence to support the claim that there would be
a problem transporting solid waste down drain lines with low flush
toilets,'' said Amy Vickers, a water resources consultant from
Boston who became known as the ``commode queen'' last year during
her efforts to have the 1.6 gallon per flush standard adopted in
Massachusetts.
   Fowler said the bill would help reduce the strain on the
nation's water supplies by putting ``a stop to the massive waste of
water in faucets, water closets, showerheads.'' He said replacing
all such fixtures in American homes with more efficient models
would save almost 7 billion gallons of water a day.
   Craig Selover, a vice president of the Delta Faucet Co., said
the Plumbing Manufacturers Institute opposes the legislation
because it would ``create a needless federal bureaucracy, wasting
taxpayers' money'' and do little to promote water conservation.
   ``The legislation would, quite probably, create a negative
attitude toward water conservation among consumers, thereby
hampering important and much needed efforts to conserve precious
potable water resources,'' he said.
