<TEXT>
<P>
A team of Roto-Rooter employees went beyond the call of duty to retrieve a 
$5,000 engagement ring a San Jose woman accidentally flushed down the toilet 
just a day before her wedding. 
</P>
<P>
Their efforts, which included tearing up the front lawn and flushing gallons of 
water into a sewer main, paid off. Trish McDonald's ring was saved from a 
watery grave on May 19. 
</P>
<P>
"I gave them all the champagne out of my refrigerator," said McDonald, a 
27-year-old flight attendant. "I was just passing it out in the street." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald, who had been preoccupied with pre-wedding arrangements, forgot she 
had wrapped the ring in toilet paper to protect it. After she wiped the sink 
dry with some other toilet paper, she flushed the whole clump. 
</P>
<P>
"I just about hyperventilated on the floor. I said, 'This is the beginning of 
the end of my marriage.' "
