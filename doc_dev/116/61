HANDYMAN Q&amp;A: HOW TO CLEAR DEPOSITS FROM NEW TOILET VALVE

QUESTION: I had a Fluidmaster 400-A tank valve installed in my toilet recently, 
and have since noticed a gurgling sound coming from the toilet. It sounds as if 
the valve is stuck open, allowing water to run into the bowl. The water level 
in the bowl doesn't change. Any ideas as to what's happening? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: The condition may be the result of a sediment buildup. Often, sediment 
in the plumbing is loosened when the new valve is installed and is carried by 
the water stream into a Fluidmaster valve. 
</P>
<P>
To flush out the deposits, turn off the toilet's water supply. Unscrew the 
valve's cover by pushing down and turning counterclockwise. Hold an overturned 
cup above the valve and turn the water on again. Flush out the valve 
thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
Check that an angle adapter has been installed on the overflow pipe. Without 
it, water will be siphoned from the tank, down the pipe and into the bowl. 
Also, check that the flusher is properly aligned over the valve seat so water 
won't leak past it. 
</P>
<P>
If sediment continues to clog the valve, you may need an in-line water filter 
in the house water-supply line.

May Need to Open Wall to Fix Pocket Door 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can I fix pocket sliding doors that came off the rail without cutting into 
the wall to gain access? The hangers and rollers either come loose, or the rail 
becomes loose due to screws falling off. 
</P>
<P>
A: You may be able to solve the problem by adjusting the hardware the door 
hangs from. If, however, there is a problem with the tracks inside the wall, it 
may be necessary to open one side of the wall for access.

When Paint Blisters, Check Ventilation 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last spring, I scraped every speck of defective paint from the siding on our 
house, then primed and painted with a high-quality topcoat. By November, the 
new paint had blistered. My neighbor painted two years earlier and his house 
remains in pristine condition. Why? 
</P>
<P>
A: Cut open some of the paint blisters. If bare wood shows beneath, it's almost 
certain you have a moisture problem. Check the venting on your neighbor's house 
and compare it with your own. Does he have a stationary attic vent? Has he 
installed vents in his siding? Good venting allows moisture to pass to the 
outdoors from inside a house before it can penetrate the siding and lift the 
paint. As a further precaution, use paint on interior walls that is rated as a 
vapor barrier. Also, make sure caulking and flashing are sealing out leaks.

Root of Sidewalk's Problem Is Tree 
</P>
<P>
Q: Whole sections of my concrete sidewalk have heaved because of tree roots. Do 
I have to tear out the old walk and pour new concrete? 
</P>
<P>
A: Pouring a new walk would solve your problems only temporarily. The real 
problem is the tree roots. Since your concrete is in good condition, it should 
be a relatively easy matter to pry up the sidewalk in sections. Use a pry bar 
to move slabs out of the way. Chop out the tree roots. You may need to dig the 
subgrade deeper if the level has shifted. Tamp the earth firmly. For good 
drainage, put in six inches of gravel. Then replace the slabs on the gravel 
bed.
