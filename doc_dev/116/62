<LEADPARA>  'IGGY," THE iguana, kicked the bucket last weekend.;    At the Rocky Mountain
Institute, the energy resource think tank where the three-foot lizard had
resided in subtropical luxury despite the 7,100-foot altitude, snow and
freezing outside, reactions to Iggy's passing varied.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Hunter Lovins, the institute's co-founder and president, slid her fingers
between his prehistoric-looking jaws and recounted the time they had clamped
down on her.;    "Hurt like hell. He was a mean old boy," she said in an
out-by-the-barn twang that hides her background as a lawyer, sociologist,
forester, environmentalist and, along with her physicist husband, Amory,
advancer of common-sense thoughts on how to save ourselves from ourselves. "I
can't say I'm sorry to see him go.";    She's also a volunteer firefighter,
country bar bouncer, rodeo rider and deer hunter. She can outride, outrope,
outshoot, outcuss, outdrink, outthink, outcharm and outcavort about any urban
cowboy you and I know.;    I learned this in a day chasing her on horseback
through snow-covered hills.;    Back indoors, she set the iguana's stiff
corpse on a long spruce table that serves as a dining, work and conference
area for the 4,000-square-foot, energy-efficient home, bioshelter, office and
internationally renowned resource center overlooking a spectacular valley 14
miles west of Aspen.;    Amory Lovins, a slight, scholarly looking
indoor-kind-of-guy, joined us. There is a rumor the two had exchanged buck
knives at their wedding. It's hard to imagine -- at least on his part.;   
'ALAS, POOR Iggy," he said solemnly, stroking the rigid iguana. "I knew him
well.";    It was a Shakespearean utterance of appreciation for the irony of
Iggy's demise -- not from freezing but from gorging on the berries of a
malabar spinach plant flourishing in the 900-square-foot greenhouse with huge
south-facing windows. The window panels also act as solar collectors to help
produce not only more heat than the building can use but also electricity in
such occasional abundance that the local utility company purchases the
excess.;    Amory Lovins, the 43-year-old energy-efficiency wizard, designed
the building 10 years ago to save space and energy. He bounded around it like
a child, showing off the Lazy Susan space-saving closets and devices that you
and I can use to cut back on water, energy and utility bills.;    There were
the low-flow shower heads that are just as powerful but nearly 90 percent more
efficient than normal shower heads. And there was the Swedish-built toilet
that uses 0.8 gallons of water per flush, compared to five to seven gallons
per flush in normal toilets.;    "You can do this without sacrificing a hot
shower and cold beer," he said. "A normal house this size with this much glass
in this climate would run about $1,000 a month in utility bills. But we save
around $7,000 a year or around $20 worth of electricity a day, the equivalent
of two-thirds of a barrel of oil.";    He pointed to a fluorescent light bulb
over the big table.;    'IT IS JUST as bright as a regular 100-watt bulb and
will last 10 times longer," he said. "In one year, this bulb could save enough
energy to spare one ton of carbon dioxide from being emitted into the air from
a coal-fired generating plant.;    "If used throughout the nation, around 60
large power plants could be shut down and we'd save around $100 billion.";   
He showed me the kitchen faucet equipped with a toggle switch you can flip to
turn off the water when the phone rings or the kids interrupt. He showed me
the special air-to-air heat exchanger that recovers and circulates heat from
the stove, and the photocells that automatically dim and brighten the lights.;
   He beckoned me around a corner and showed me the 4-inch Freon-filled
polyurethane foam insulation between the walls and the argon-filled windows --
twice as efficient as triple-glazed windows, he says.;    Finally, he stopped
at a control panel where all the utility meters are, and consulted a grid
chart of daily electrical usage, saying: "It looks like a surplus of 5
kilowatt hours. At our utility rates, that's a savings of 37 cents. Better
put, it's the equivalent of not burning one pound of coal.";    Or, as the
institute's literature says: the equivalent of lighting a 100-watt lamp for 10
hours.;    He paused, looking at me, waiting for things to sink in.;    As I
think about my own house in California, they are starting to.  </TEXT>
