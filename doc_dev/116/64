<LEADPARA>  WITH drought on everyone's mind, water is a No. 1 priority when you're
shopping for a place to live. Here are some suggestions:;    (check) Check all
faucets for dripping. Besides kitchen and main bathroom faucets, check faucets
in the laundry-room tub and outdoor faucets. Turn off each faucet and wait at
least a minute, to see if it drips. Look under the sink to see if there's
water dripping from the plumbing there.;    (check) When the water is running
from each faucet, look at it closely. Is it clear or is rust visible? Sediment
buildup may mean pipes are decaying.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (check) While the water is running, check the pressure. Insufficient
pressure may be an indication of faulty plumbing or inadequate pressure from
the water source.;    (check) Check the shower pressure to see if water merely
dribbles out of the shower head. If you're concerned with saving water, turn
off the water after you've soaked down and then turn it on again after you've
soaped down, using as little as possible.);    (check) Check toilets for
pressure. Water-saving toilets use less water in the flush cycle, but there
should still be adequate pressure in the flush.  </TEXT>
