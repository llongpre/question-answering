   A tearful mother used a lifelike rubber
doll and a porcelain toilet to show jurors Tuesday how her husband
fatally plunged her 2-year-old son headfirst into the commode as
punishment for soiling his pants.
   ``He held him way up here,'' 21-year-old Sheryl Coe testified,
grabbing the doll by the ankles and dunking its head into the
toilet. ``He flushed the toilet water so the water would flush on
his head.''
   Thomas Coe, 23, stared straight down as Mrs. Coe testified that
Bradley McGee's death came after weeks of her husband's torturing.
Coe is charged with first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.
The state rested its case after Mrs. Coe's testimony.
   Bradley died of head injuries July 28, 1989, only two months
after he was returned from state foster care to his mother and
stepfather.
   Mrs. Coe agreed to testify against her husband after pleading no
contest to second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse charges.
She is serving 30 years in prison.
   Dressed in dark-blue prison garb, Mrs. Coe said her husband's
disciplinary methods included forcing Bradley to stand in the
corner with his hands on his head, making him eat feces off the
ground and grinding his fist and cayenne pepper into the child's
genitals.
   She testified that her husband had previously dunked Bradley in
the toilet, but the last time came July 27, 1989, after Coe had
returned from a job interview.
   Mrs. Coe said her husband became furious when she told him the
child has ``made a mess'' in his pants.
   ``Tom took him back to the bathroom and dunked his head into the
toilet several times,'' she said.
   She then described how Coe threw the boy under a cold shower
``with a clunk and a boom,'' and forced him to walk into the living
room where they beat him with cushions ``until he collapsed and
went into, like, an epileptic fit.''
   Bradley was taken to Lakeland Regional Medical Center after a
neighbor called for help. He was pronounced dead the next day.
   In a taped statement played for the jury Tuesday, Coe said he
meant to scare the child.
   ``I turned him upside down and dunked him into the toilet. I
don't know how many times I did it _ it happened so fast. I flushed
it just to scare him,'' Coe said. ``I'm sorry I did it. I didn't
mean to do it. I lost control. It was a bad day all the way
around.''
   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Coe.
   Defense attorneys concede Coe dunked the child into the toilet,
but say he should be convicted of a lesser crime because it was
merely a one-time form of punishment and there was never any intent
to harm the child.
   They have portrayed Mrs. Coe as an unstable, self-serving liar,
arguing that she has changed her account of events at least four
times.
   ``I was scared, I didn't know what to do,'' she said.
   Bradley's death came after a state Department of Health and
Rehabilitative Services caseworker recommended that a judge return
the child to his mother, despite a psychological report that
questioned the couple's abilities as parents and detailed their
explosive personalities. Mrs. Coe had abandoned Bradley at a
shopping mall when he was 3 months old.
   Public outrage over Bradley's death led legislators to change
the law, placing child welfare above attempts to reunite families.
   Bradley's main caseworker, Margaret Barber, was convicted June
15 of felony child abuse, and sentenced to three months' probation.
Three other caseworkers were cleared of criminal charges.
