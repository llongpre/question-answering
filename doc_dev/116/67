   Most restaurants in this desert resort serve
water on request only, towering hotel-casinos have reduced the flow
from thousands of showerheads and a showroom elephant waits longer
for her bath to be changed.
   The drought has come home to Reno, but its slot machine bells
still jangle and chips still fly across its felt gambling tables.
   In fact, the drought that has stunned the nation's midsection
with its severity hasn't surprised hotel owners here.
   After two consecutive years in which the area has received half
its scant 7.5-inch annual precipitation, Reno is in a Stage One
drought alert, calling for voluntary cutbacks in water use. Stage
Two, which mandates some unenforced reductions, is expected by
mid-August.
   Unlike Las Vegas, where the Colorado River provides more than
enough water to the casinos and their shimmering fountains, Reno
depends almost solely on runoff from winter snow in the Sierra
Nevada for its summer water.
   And the snow is gone.
   Restaurants, hotel-casinos and other businesses here typically
have been watchful of their water use, partly because they pay for
every drop.
   ``Our per-person use is half that of residential consumption,''
said Glenn McCormick, chief engineer at the Peppermill Hotel Casino.
   McCormick estimates that water-saving conversions at the
year-old hotel tower have produced a minimum savings of 3 million
to 4 million gallons of water annually for little more than the
cost of the time it took to make them.
   While some hotels here and at Lake Tahoe have installed
restricted-flow shower heads and water-saving toilets, McCormick
opted to modify the existing fixtures.
   ``You don't have to spend a lot of money,'' he said. ``People go
out and buy a lot of gadgets they don't need.''
   He cut back the Peppermill's water use by putting smaller
washers in shower heads and reducing pressure in the taps. Lower
water levels in hotel toilets cut consumption from 6 gallons per
flush to 4, he said.
   Outdoor watering was decreased by replacing thirsty plants with
decorative rocks or vegetation better suited to the desert.
   At John Ascuaga's Nugget in nearby Sparks, all outside plants
are watered by drip irrigation installed during the past year,
according to spokesman Art Long.
   The Nugget, like other local hotels, recycles water in air
conditioning cooling towers and loads dishwashers completely before
starting them.
   Conservation even has affected Bertha, the Nugget's trained
elephant who warms up showroom crowds for entertainers like Red
Skelton and Shirley MacLaine.
   ``We used to clean and drain her pool twice a week. Now it's
down to once a week. And the water that's pumped out is used to
water the lawn and foilage around Bertha's Elephant Palace,'' Long
said.
   Homeowners, however, successfully fought efforts to require
water meters. They pay a flat monthly fee regardless of how much
water they use. New homes are required to have water meters, but
there still are nearly 50,000 with virtually unlimited water use.
   ``Hotel-casinos are not the biggest users. I think they take a
bad rap,'' said Bob Firth, water resources manager for Westpac
Utilities.
   Businesses use only 22 percent of the 90 million gallons or so
his company pumps out daily, Firth said. By comparison, he said, 47
percent of the daily summertime use goes for watering lawns and
hedges.
   The Reno area's last prolonged dry spell was in 1976-77, and
even though those years were a little wetter than the past two,
``we got through kind of by the skin of our teeth,'' Firth said.
   ``The difference between now and 1976-77 is that we've had a 33
percent growth rate,'' Firth said. ``Measures may have to be a lot
more drastic than they were at that time.''
