<LEADPARA>  THE CLARENCE Thomas Story, being told this week in the Senate Judiciary
Committee, has already toppled a towering edifice of American political
iconography -- the log cabin -- and replaced it with something a little
different.;   The outhouse.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "In 1955, my brother and I went to live with my mother in Savannah," Thomas
told the panel Tuesday as it began considering his nomination to the Supreme
Court. "We lived in one room in a tenement. We shared a kitchen with other
tenants and we had a common bathroom in the back yard . . . It was hard.";  
"I understand this," said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. "I was born into a family
where we didn't have indoor facilities either. . . . I have to tell you, Judge
Thomas, I am so doggone proud of you I can hardly stand it.";   Arguably, this
has implications for natural law and the right of privacy. But mainly it's
supposed to be proof of character -- even a window on the soul. Clarence
Thomas -- and, apparently, Orrin Hatch, too -- are thus salt of the earth, not
the sort of moral weaklings to be pampered by the extravagance of a flush
toilet.;   "It seems to be part of the agrarian myth," says historian William
Leuchtenburg, president of the American Historical Association. "It isn't
simply that one was poor. It's that one knew what the countryside was like."; 
 Leuchtenburg waxed nostalgic: "When I was a boy in the 1930s, we had almost
no books in the house. One of the few books we possessed was by Chic Sale, who
specialized in outhouse humor. It was the entire corpus of my literary
education in those days.;   "The other piece of literature associated with
outhouses was the Sears Roebuck catalog," Leuchtenburg added. "You'd rip the
pages out as necessary.";   Stephen Ambrose, a historian and biographer of
Dwight Eisenhower and Richard Nixon, said, "Outhouses were very typical,
actually, of World War II America. Outside of the cities, a majority of houses
did not have indoor plumbing. I myself was in that situation.";   The young
Ike made do without indoor plumbing, as did Nixon, Ambrose said. He cited
figures from the 1940 census indicating that of 35 million households in the
United States, 33 million boasted radios but only 20 million had flush toilets.  </TEXT>
