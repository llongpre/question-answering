<LEADPARA>  THIS Christmas there were 15 people at my house. Some arrived with huge
suitcases and stayed for days. Some arrived with gifts and stayed for just a
few hours. Some are there permanently. I have a schizophrenic attitude toward
guests: I love having them, but I love it even more when they leave.;    When
you invite them -- months before the actual date -- you forget the hassle
guests entail. You're just thinking, "It'll be great to see so-and-so." As a
rule, I feel sorry for my guests because sometimes I can be charming, then
testy the next moment. It all has to do with having small children; I wasn't
this way before I became a mother.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This year, I thought I had everything under control: gifts for everyone,
lots of food -- lots of booze, too. How wrong I was. With guests, things never
turn out the way you plan.;    Early Christmas morning, one of the guests --
as he does every year -- struggled into his rented Santa suit. He was feeling
smugly pleased with himself. In previous years, he'd only managed to rent a
Santa suit meant for outdoor wear and had broiled inside the wig, beard and
heavy boots. But this year he had a lightweight indoor version. What's more,
this year he didn't have a hangover.;    Everything was running smoothly, just
as I had planned.;    At the first sound of movement in the house my kids woke
up and ran down the hall. "It's Phil!" they screamed, as they caught Santa
searching for his glasses. Not so alert were the couple of teen-agers,
sleeping on the pull-out couch in the family room. It was only 6:30 a.m.;   
"Aaargh!" came a strangled scream. One had woken briefly to find a man with a
snowy white beard, a red suit and glasses making coffee.;    All in all, it
was a charming Christmas scene. But then things began to go wrong, horribly
wrong.;    On Christmas Eve I had served the grand assembly a hearty chili.
Robust it was, with plenty of beans. I wanted to fill them up for a long time
because I knew we probably wouldn't eat until late afternoon on Christmas Day,
save for a self-serve breakfast.;    As fate would have it, Christmas Day
dawned and the toilet was blocked. Panic time. Should I spend my life savings
on a plumber's Christmas Day rates? What alternative did I have? It's bad
enough to have a blocked toilet on an average day, but when you have 15 people
sitting around eating twice what they normally eat, the situation can quickly
turn into a disaster.;    I flushed the toilet a couple of times and made a
bad situation worse. Water spilled out over the bowl. I searched high and low
for a plunger. Meanwhile, the turkey was merrily roasting in the oven and the
living room floor was strewn with wrapping paper and gifts. And my guests,
American and British, were squirming uneasily in their chairs.;    National
characteristics emerge quickly under stress. English guests -- as a rule --
are terrified about appearing ill-mannered, so they'll sit for hours, dying
for a cup of tea, but not daring to ask because to ask is rude.;    American
guests are bolder. They never arrive empty-handed like the British, but inside
your house they'll head straight for the refrigerator and help themselves, ask
for the car keys, turn up the thermostat, and make themselves right at home.; 
  This combination of national characteristic plus a blocked toilet might
strain British-American relations, I thought. More panic. Several family
members were due to arrive later. I called my stepson: "Have you got a
plunger?" I screamed. There was a low moan at the other end; he was asleep.
"Wha . . . ?" he said. "Have you got a plunger?" Long silence. "Dunno, I'll
look." He hung up.;    Meanwhile, back in the living room, tension and
discomfort were words that described the mood, especially for my British
guests who were unused to exotic foods like chili.;    "There's a gas station
a few blocks away," I suggested. "You could carpool.";    "How do we get
there?";    I gave directions.;    Hasty decisions were made; several cars
were involved. "Somebody take my children with you," I yelled as I disappeared
into the kitchen to baste the turkey. "I'll go along later.";    Just then the
last batch of guests arrived, holding armfuls of gifts -- and a plunger. I
grabbed it and headed to the bathroom.;    Within moments a symphony of
successful flushings could be heard ringing joyously through the house. My
guests began to line up, Americans first.  </TEXT>
