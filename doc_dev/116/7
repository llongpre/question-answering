Faced with a continuing statewide drought and diminishing out-of-state water 
supplies, Los Angeles officials announced a pilot program Tuesday in which the 
city's Department of Water and Power will offer $100 rebates to residents who 
replace older toilets with ultra-low-flush models. 
</P>
<P>
With two of the models on hand as props during a morning news conference, Mayor 
Tom Bradley kicked off the novel program that encourages Los Angeles residents 
to replace older, water-guzzling toilets with ones that use only 1.6 gallons of 
water per flush -- a reduction that could save Los Angeles as much as 80 
million gallons of water by the time the one-year program ends. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for us to develop every means of water conservation that we 
can," said Bradley, who was joined by City Council members and representatives 
of local water agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The placement of low-flush models in homes throughout Los Angeles, Bradley 
added, "could save a significant amount of water that is otherwise now wasted 
by being flushed through the system." 
</P>
<P>
The DWP and Metropolitan Water District have budgeted $750,000 for the pilot 
program, which seeks to replace 7,500 older toilets -- which may use up to 
seven gallons of water with each push of the lever -- with the ultra-low-flush 
models. Residents of single and multifamily dwellings who participate in the 
program would be given $100 rebate checks upon verification of installation by 
DWP officials. 
</P>
<P>
With some of the toilets selling for as little as $50, the rebate check could 
"defer all or a big portion of the cost of replacing the toilet," said Rick 
Caruso, president of the Board of Water and Power, adding that residents could 
choose to do the installation themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The project is the first such rebate offer made by the DWP in the area of water 
conservation, according to officials, and it comes at a time when California's 
water resources are rapidly diminishing in the midst of a four-year drought. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the best means of water conservation available because it's the 
machine that does it for you. . . . You don't have to change your life style," 
said Councilwoman Ruth Galanter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's good for the city because we don't have to take the water out of Mono 
Lake," Galanter continued, referring to the body of water in the Eastern 
Sierra. And, she added, "We don't have to purchase it from other resources." 
</P>
<P>
Besides minimizing water waste, DWP officials said, such conservation efforts 
can decrease water costs for single-family customers by approximately $19.50 
per toilet per year, and reduce pressure on Los Angeles' overtaxed sewage 
system -- a system that became so burdened with storm overflow this past 
weekend that a city treatment plant had to divert some of its waste into the 
ocean to prevent it from flowing into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
State and local officials have taken steps in the past to conserve water that 
is often flushed away and wasted. A state standard was set in 1983 that 
required all toilets sold in the state to use only 3.5 gallons of water per 
flush. The Los Angeles City Council took the action a step further, approving 
an ordinance in 1988 that required all toilets installed in newly constructed 
homes or residential additions to use 1.5 gallons per flush. 
</P>
<P>
If the rebate program shows significant water savings for customers, the 
project could extend indefinitely, Caruso said.
