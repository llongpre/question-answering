   In their latest move to toilet train the people,
authorities plan to fine those who fail to flush after using public
lavatories.
   Beginning July 1, first-time offenders may be penalized as much
as $77. Repeat offenders caught neglecting to flush three or more
times may have to pay as much as $515.
   Public toilets are defined as those to which the public has
access, including those in hotels, department stores, cinemas and
restaurants. The Environment Ministry says many people simply are
not flushing after use.
   Government campaigns to improve public hygiene in this city-state
of 2.6 million people are not new. A Clean Public Toilets campaign
was first mounted in 1983. A team of health inspectors was deployed
last year, but offenders merely received warning letters.
   The deteriorating state of public toilets and anti-social
bathroom behavior receive much attention in this country, which uses
the slogan ``clean and green'' to describe itself.
   A survey of 3,550 public toilets turned up ``a problem of users
showing no consideration for the next person,'' said Richard Lim of
the Environment Ministry.
   The Straits Times newspaper last year targeted ``toilets of
shame,'' singling out by name, photograph and location
``particularly disgusting facilities.'' Both the newspaper and the
Environment Ministry installed telephone hotlines for complaints.
   Many apartment blocks have become high-rise slums with elevators
reeking of urine and corridors filled with trash.
   The elevator problem became so bad that the Housing Board
installed a sophisticated monitoring system in some buildings.
   Sensors activated by the high salt content in urine stop the
elevator, activate a video camera hidden in the ceiling and alert
the janitor. The trapped offender is supposed to be turned over to
police.
   Dozens of culprits, aged from 7 to 79 and including at least one
woman, have been flushed out so far. They face a fine of $1,030,
three years in jail and a flogging of from three to eight lashes.
