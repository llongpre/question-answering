<HEAD>Courthouse Toilets Explode When Compressor Connected to Water Line</HEAD>

   About two dozens toilets and urinals in the King
County Courthouse exploded when they were flushed after an air
compressor was mistakenly connected to a water line, officials said.
   ``We think we've lost about 20 to 25 toilets,'' building services
manager Bill Kemp said Thursday. ``The porcelain is actually
cracked.''
   Each time the pressurized privies were flushed in restrooms
throughout the 72-year-old building, plumbing started popping, Kemp
said. Instead of the usual swirl and gurgle of water, geysers
erupted.
   Officials eventually traced the problem to an erroneous
compressor hookup by a construction worker on a nearby $430 million
bus tunnel project.
   ``They started blowing at about 11:30 (a.m.) and it took us a
while to figure it out,'' he recounted. ``We knew it had to be air
in the system, but the (city) Water Department said that was
impossible.''
   Kemp said there were no reports of injuries, although several
people apparently were soaked.
   After the incident, all courthouse restrooms were closed for the
day, and employees and others had to walk across the street to
toilets in the county Administration Building. Kemp said most
courthouse toilets would be back in operation today. Damage has yet
to be determined.
