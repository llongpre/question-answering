<LEADPARA>  A four-flushing criminal, plumbing the depths of depravity, has made off with
the handles of 109 toilet bowls from all over lower Manhattan -- including one
just down the hall from Mayor David Dinkins' office.;   "This is really going
on," said Lisa Ryan, a spokeswoman for the city Department of General
Services. "It's a problem that can cause a real mess. It sounds funny, but
we're not happy about it."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The toilet thief began striking in March, with May the busiest month, said
Ryan. Things slowed down during the summer, but they picked up again last
month: 20 disappeared in September.;   City employees have been warned about
the prowling plumber, who also makes off with the inside hardware attached to
the handle.;   "If you hear someone working with wrenches in a stall, be
cautious," said a memo from General Services' Robert Carney.;   The thief only
strikes in men's rooms. The most brazen bathroom heist: a May robbery in a
City Hall stall, a short distance from Dinkins' basement office.;   What
motivates someone to commit lavatory larceny? Nobody's quite sure.;   "There's
a little brass in there. Or maybe he's refurbishing and reselling them. Or
maybe he's using them for another purpose. I don't know why anyone would want
them," Ryan said.;   The city, for one. Replacing each piece costs $50 for
parts plus labor; that's $5,450 gone before a single flushometer (the
technical name) is back in place.;   The city has developed a low-cost
response to the problem: a $5, doughnut-shaped device that attaches to the
flusher to combat theft.;   On the bright side, the crime wave has not caused
real waves in the affected men's rooms. The thief thoughtfully shuts off the
water to each toilet before removing the flushometers.;   "It's probably
self-preservation," Ryan mused. "He doesn't want to get up to his neck in his
work."  </TEXT>
