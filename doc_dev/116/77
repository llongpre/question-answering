<LEADPARA>  The San Jose-Santa Clara sewage treatment plant flushes $13 million worth of
fresh water into briny San Francisco Bay every year, and Bob Gross figures
that is kind of dumb when we are spending millions to import water.;    Gross
said he has a better idea:  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  CREATE LAKE OF TREATED EFFLUENT, OFFICIAL
SAYS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Create a lake in Alviso, pipe in reclaimed water from the treatment plant,
then pipe the water out to the surrounding industrial area for such uses as
landscaping, car washing -- and flushing 30,000 toilets if a new Giants
stadium gets built nearby.;    As a bonus, the county would get a recreation
area suitable for small boats that would also provide a habitat for migratory
birds. Additional areas could be developed for bicycling and picnicking.;   
Gross, chairman of the Santa Clara Valley Water District board of directors,
sees a lake about 15 feet deep and capable of storing 1,500 acre-feet of
water, making it comparable in size to the county's smaller reservoirs --
Almaden and Vasona.;    Dumping the water into the bay not only wastes it,
Gross said, it also destroys the salty environment.;    San Jose is under
orders from the state Regional Water Quality Control Board to restore the
salinity of a portion of the bay where the endangered clapper rail and harvest
mouse live, or buy a comparable piece of wetlands where they can survive.
Gross suggested that if the plant stopped pumping fresh water into the bay,
the situation might correct itself.;    The idea of reusing the plant's water
is not new. San Jose and the water district already have an agreement to study
some kind of reclamation system that would use up to 10 million gallons of the
100 million gallons the plant treats on peak days. The lake is a new wrinkle.;
   Besides supplying the "Golden Triangle" industrial area -- some of which is
yet to be developed -- the reclaimed water could be piped back up nearby
Guadalupe River and Coyote Creek for percolation into the underground basin,
Gross said.;    The plant treats about 50,000 acre-feet a year, Gross said. In
the past 60 days, the water board has agreed to spend $7 million to import
water needed to get the valley through the summer after five years of drought
have left it far short of its needs.;    Gross said the land he has in mind
for the lake is already owned by San Jose. It is a parcel of several hundred
acres just south of the treatment plant, bounded by Highway 237 on the south,
Zanker Road on the east, the plant on the north and the industrial area to the
west. Gross proposes a joint venture between San Jose and the water district
to build the project. He had no cost projections.;    "I'm confident that the
water from the treatment plant is as clean or cleaner than what we're pumping
out of the (Sacramento-San Joaquin River) Delta" and treating to use as
drinking water, Gross said.;    Now is the time to do it, he added, before the
industrial area is fully developed and while new buildings can still be fitted
with dual plumbing systems -- one for drinking water and the other for treated
water.;    He has presented the plan to the seven-member water board, which
sent it to the staff for evaluation. San Jose officials could not be reached
for comment.;    If all his other points are not enough, Gross said, he has
one last argument in favor of developing a reclaimed water system.;   
"There's the potential for the baseball stadium there (near the lake)," he
noted. "When you have a game, you have 30,000 toilets being flushed.;   
"We're talking about the movement of a considerable amount of water."  </TEXT>
