<LEADPARA>  San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer and city council members Nancy Ianni and George
Shirakawa, three politicians who help set the city's drought policy, have
failed recently to meet water-saving standards, a survey of council members'
water bills shows.;    Hammer's account with the San Jose Water Co. shows her
conservation lagging by enough water to supply an average household for a year
-- an aberration, she says, caused by a leaky toilet and a ruptured pipe
during the winter freeze. The mayor denies that she is a water waster and
offers as proof a clean water record for 1989 and most of 1990.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Both Ianni and Shirakawa slightly exceeded their annual allotments, which
were 80 percent of what they used in 1987. Rationing tightens to a 75 percent
allotment starting in May.;    Ianni, like Hammer, blamed the bill on the
freeze, while Shirakawa said his 29-year-old son and 25-year-old daughter take
long, repeated showers.;    "You know young people, you have to battle them
for conservationism," Shirakawa said. His kids recently moved back into the
house.;    Ianni could not be reached for comment. But she said in a note that
she had fixed a leaking irrigation valve "as quickly as I could and since then
(I) have been back on track.";    Hammer and her husband, Phil, live in a
five-bedroom, four-bathroom house on West Hedding Street. The mayor says they
shower quickly, flush sparingly and go easy on the landscaping. "We just don't
use a lot of water," she said.;    But in November, she discovered a problem
with an out-of-the-way toilet and had it fixed. Then, one day in December, she
came home to find a pipe burst outside, shooting water 20 feet in the air. "It
was like a geyser, like Yellowstone," she said.;    It took several hours
before the water company cut the spout, she said.;    As a result, Hammer
said, her water bank went from a surplus of 76 ccfs in September 1990 to a
deficit of 155 by February. Before the leaks, Hammer had kept surpluses for
more than a year, her records show.;    A ccf -- 100 cubic feet -- is 748
gallons of water. In a normal year, the average household in San Jose would
use 17 ccfs per month, water company officials say. During the drought, the
average has dropped to 13 ccfs.;    Hammer's deficit grew to 214 ccfs by
April, according to records provided by the mayor's office. Maribel Alvarez, a
spokeswoman for the mayor, said that Hammer may have more plumbing problems
but that they have either been fixed or will be soon.;    "We have exhausted
the subject," Alvarez said, when asked for further explanation.;    Hammer
said she soon will apply for an adjustment to her account to reflect the
plumbing problems. The water company's hardship policy is to scan fix-it
receipts and review individual cases. It sometimes makes adjustments.;   
Sharon Whaley, a water company spokeswoman, said 80 to 85 percent of the
company's 203,000 customers have positive bank balances, meaning they are
meeting the rationing goal.;    Whaley said the company would not comment on
individual customer's bills. The private company, which serves most of San
Jose, routinely denies public access to its records. The Mercury News obtained
the water bills by asking council members for copies.;     Who's saving;
water; Following are the balances each San Jose City Council member has in the
water bank, as recorded in their most recently available water records. A ccf
is 748 gallons. Except where noted, the figure is a surplus.;   Member

after calling San Jose Water.; (s2)Stabile is served by Great Oaks Water Co.,
which does not keep a water bank. But the company says she is well under the
goal.; Source: San Jose City Council; Mercury News  </TEXT>
