<LEADPARA>  As a Vietnam veteran, I get tired of protesters comparing every military
operation we have had since that conflict to the war itself. The truth is, we
never had any vital interests in Vietnam.;    Every conflict we have been
involved in since the Vietnam War -- such as Grenada and Panama -- has been in
our vital interests, or at least a lot closer to home. Certainly we have vital
interests in the Middle East. Why do protesters keep harping about every new
conflict being "another Vietnam"?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Before this war began, President Bush showed considerable restraint,
compared to Lyndon Johnson and the beginning of the Vietnam War. I believe it
is time to back our troops in the gulf.;    -- Tom Peterson; Cupertino;
DROUGHT CRIES OUT FOR WISE WATER WAYS; The media repeatedly tell us that we
are entering the fifth year of drought. We are reminded that such droughts
recur approximately every 10 or 11 years. Even if the rains were to resume
tomorrow, another shortage is just a few years away.;    State and regional
water agencies are holding emergency meetings to implement drastic
conservation measures. Consider these suggestions:;    (check) Relate billing
units to gallons. We use -- and save -- water by the gallon, not the cubic
foot. One billing unit &equals; 100 cubic feet (ccf) &equals; 748 gallons.;    (check)
Establish a lifeline rate of $1 per unit for the first seven units (5,236
gallons) per month; then, in steps, escalate rates dramatically to $20 or more
at 50 units (37,400 gallons!) a month. That's still less than 2.7 cents per
gallon!;    (check) Establish absolute limits and collect a hefty fine for
exceeding them. A penalty of a meager $2 per ccf for exceeding the allotment
only adds a quarter of a cent to the cost of a gallon of water.;    (check)
Use increased revenues to fund research and construction of alternative,
environmentally sound sources of water. Desalinization may be expensive, but
it holds promise.;    (check) With state and local officials, develop
guidelines for gray water use. Establish tax credits or similar incentives for
designing and installing effective gray water-recovery systems. Why use clear
drinking water to flush the toilet?;    (check) Acknowledge the tremendous
commitment of those who are already conserving dramatically. Carrying buckets
of water from the bathtub to the washing machine or the lawn -- for less than
a penny a bucket -- is clearly a labor of love.;    We certainly must make
some modifications in our lifestyles -- not just while we're in this drought,
but permanently.;    -- Jonathan P. Cranch; Palo Alto; BROWN DOESN'T SPEAK FOR
THE MAJORITY; When Jerry Brown, chairman of the Californian Democratic Party,
implied Jan. 19 on a TV program called "Sound Off" that President Bush led the
United States into war with Iraq to increase his popularity, Brown made public
his contempt for the president, his ignorance of the causes of the war and his
cynical attitude toward American public opinion.;    If, as Brown implied,
President Bush predicted that a war would increase his popularity, that means
that most Americans support the war. Who, then, does Brown speak for when he
objects to the war? Not for the majority of Americans.;    -- Rivka
Sherman-Gold; Palo Alto  </TEXT>
