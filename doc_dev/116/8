<LEADPARA>  The city of San Jose is hiring a toilet consultant. It's not that the city's
coffers are flush but that its toilets are flushing too much.;    Since wasted
water is serious business in the fifth year of a drought, San Jose City
Council members will be asked Tuesday to approve a $50,000 contract for James
M. Montgomery, Consulting Engineers Inc. to do a six-month study on
ultra-low-flush toilets.  </LEADPARA>

S.J. TO HIRE CONSULTANT TO HELP SLOW THE
FLOW FROM TOILETS  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Known in bathroom-wise circles as ULFs, the toilets are said to use only
1.6 gpf (that's gallons per flush) as opposed to more traditional water
closets, which use anywhere from 3.5 to 7 gpf.;    San Jose's water-watchers
estimate that toilets account for about 40 percent of all water used indoors.
The result is up to 15 million gallons flushed away to the city's sewer plant
each day.;    The city's aim is to find out whether it can put together a
workable program to encourage or require homeowners and businesses to replace
their toilets with ultra-low-flush models.;    And just to keep everybody up
to date, the city has called together architects, plumbers, plumbing suppliers
and representatives of builders to talk toilet at a workshop scheduled for
Jan. 24.  </TEXT>
