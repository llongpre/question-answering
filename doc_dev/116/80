   Many victims of Hurricane Hugo are
relying on flashlights, candles and antique kerosene lamps during
the dark, eerie nights in a city deprived of electricity, running
water and other basic services.
   Thirty mobile feeding vans were to arrive Saturday to provide
food for hurricane victims, said Glen Ellis, executive director of
the Carolina-Low Countries chapter of the Red Cross.
   ``We're going to feed everybody that needs feeding and is
hungry,'' he said. ``Some people don't have any electricity. Some
people don't have a house to cook in.''
   Since Hugo hit Thursday, the Red Cross has been passing out
sandwiches and drinks at its damaged headquarters in North
Charleston. On Saturday afternoon, 1,500 people remained in 14
shelters, Ellis said. Dozens of Red Cross volunteers with chain
saws were helping homeowners remove trees and other debris.
   Almost 200 Red Cross staff members have been dispatched to the
Carolina coast to work with hundreds of volunteers, said Dave
Langston, assistant director of Eastern Relief Operations for the
Red Cross. He said the Red Cross expects to provide 5,000 cots and
blankets and 9,000 cleanup kits for homes, as well as cash grants
so families can buy emergency supplies.
   Except for power provided by emergency generators at hospitals
and other high-priority facilities, Charleston remained without
electricity. Phone service was greatly reduced. Callers sometimes
could not call around the block but could reach relatives across
the continent.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said Saturday morning that running
water has been restored, but he advised residents to boil drinking
water. Thousands of residents were unable to take showers, wash
dishes or flush toilets for about 36 hours.
   ``I had a shower this morning. Don't I look beautiful?'' said
Loving Phillips. ``I feel wonderful.''
   Her friend Myriam Buvinger said she was cooking on a gas stove,
but had to use candles at night and, until water was restored,
scooped dirty water from sinks to flush toilets.
   Like many residents who have electric stoves, Mrs. Phillips has
not been able to cook since the storm.
   ``I had cereal and my very last banana for breakfast,'' Mrs.
Phillips noted Saturday morning. ``I don't have any other breakfast
plans. I had tuna fish salad with wilted lettuce last night.''
   Patsy Narth said the storm left her with useless credit cards
and no cash. Without electricity, businesses could not run the
usual credit checks.
   ``We have no water, no electricity and no phone,'' she said as
she walked along Meeting Street with her son and daughter, trying
to find a restaurant. The owner of the only open restaurant in the
neighborhood refused to take a credit card.
   At Aaron's Deli, customers lined up for a $3 breakfast of hot
coffee, scrambled eggs, bacon and hashed brown potatoes cooked on a
gas grill.
   ``We're the only place in town that's got it at that price,''
said co-owner Eli Hyman. ``We're trying to help ourselves by
getting rid of perishable items and help the people because they
don't have anything to eat.''
   Hyman said he would offer shrimp and other seafood for lunch and
dinner to lessen the risk that $12,000 worth of seafood in
refrigerators and freezers will spoil.
   Long lines formed at two gas stations that re-opened Saturday
morning using generators for power.
   C.B. Branan, surveying the uprooted trees and damaged historic
homes in his downtown neighborhood, said he and his 17-year-old son
were using kerosene lamps and a propane lantern for light. He is a
hunter, he said, and is used to roughing it.
   ``We're not doing a lot of cooking,'' he added. ``We have
hard-boiled eggs. I guess everybody is so hyped up we don't feel
like eating very much. The adrenalin is still in us.''
