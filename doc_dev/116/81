<HEAD>Three Injured After Propane in Water Causes Toilet Explosions</HEAD>

   Propane gas accidentally injected into a
city water line caused three toilets to explode in separate
buildings, injuring three people, authorities said.
   ``I've never seen the like, or heard of anything like this,''
Fire Chief Roy Wayne Moseley said Wednesday. ``Things come and
things go, but when a man sees water burning, maybe it's time to
go.''
   He said an accidental hookup allowed the propane to enter the
water system from a pressurized railroad tank car at a company that
uses water to clean railroad cars. Flushing released bubbles of the
highly flammable gas.
   He said each explosion was set off by ``either a space heater or
a hot-water tank or some source of open flame near the toilet. There
was an ignition source nearby in each case.''
   Peronie Weathers said he was sleeping Tuesday afternoon when he
heard his 15-year-old daughter, Retha, scream.
   ``When she flushed it _ boom. I heard her calling, `Daddy come
here. Daddy come here. The house is on fire,''' Weathers said.
   Retha was treated at Dallas County Hospital and released.
   Weathers said he lost everything in the fire. ``When there is no
time to get your britches and shoes, that's bad,'' he said.
   Wendell Rex Wells, 48, said he heard a strange bubbling sound
coming from a toilet at the Benton Casket Manufacturing Co., where
he works, and touched the tank lid.
   ``Whomp, the commode burst into flames,'' he said. The blast
slammed the bathroom door and set fire to the room and his clothing.
He was hospitalized in Little Rock.
   Another young woman was in fair condition in a Little Rock
hospital after an explosion at her home.
   Moseley said the improper hookup was made at Transitank Corp.,
which cleans and refurbishes railroad cars and routinely works on
cars carrying propane.
   ``When they have propane in a car they have to bleed that off and
pull it through a tower and burn it off,'' he said. ``Then they
inject steam, water and air into the car to clean it. We have
determined through investigation that there was a crossover hookup,
we believe by accident, that actually brought propane from a
pressurized car into the water system.''
