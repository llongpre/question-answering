   While some city slickers may think real
cowboys are an endangered species, cowboy poets know better.
   Sixteen cowboy poets participated in Friday's National Cowboy
Symposium and Celebration, reciting verses about bull riding, the
cowboy's changing way of life and the barren land they try to tame.
   ``As long as there are cows and people eat hamburgers, there
will be cowboys and my audience will exist,'' said Baxter Black,
who quit his work as a cattleman and veterinarian in the early
1980s to become a full-time cowboy poet.
   The poems were melancholy and humorous; John Underwood's had
plenty of whimsy. One verse was about a dream of a scientifically
enhanced steer with ``eyes a big a truck headlights, each horn
weighed a thousand pounds.''
   ``Cowboy poetry is looking at our flaws and foible and laughing
at ourselves,'' said Black. ``I try to nudge that fine line between
good taste and throwing up in your hat.''
   Black recites his poems, which run as long as 10 minutes, from
memory almost effortlessly. However, on a recent appearance on the
Johnny Carson show, he was so nervous he considered using a
TelePrompTer.
   ``But I decided, no, that's not the cowboy way,'' he said.

   Popeye will soon return to his watch
outside a spinach warehouse.
   Pranksters stole the 7-foot, 200-pound fiberglass statue last
month, but an anonymous tip a few days later led police to Popeye.
He was in a ditch.
   A note, stuck in the sailor's mouth, said: ``We deeply regret
the absence of your friend Popeye. We are returning him because he
just didn't seem happy with us. He wouldn't eat his spinich (sic)
so we figured something was wrong. Help Popeye find his real home.''
   The note was signed by a fraternity from the University of
Arkansas, but Allen said he doubts that the fraternity took Popeye.
   Allen Canning Co. has since repainted the statue. The company
also is working on a way to re-erect the monument to spinach
vitality ``that we think will be pretty secure,'' David Allen,
spokesman for the family-owned business, said Friday.
   He said the company isn't looking for the Popeye thieves.
``We're just glad to have Popeye back in the family,'' he said.

   With one flush, Trish McDonald saw her
wedding go down the toilet.
   A day before she was to tie the knot, the San Jose woman
accidentally flushed a $5,000 engagement ring down her toilet.
   McDonald, preoccupied with prewedding arrangements, forgot she
had wrapped the ring in toilet paper to protect it. After she wiped
the sink dry with some other toilet paper, she flushed the whole
clump.
   ``I just about hyperventilated on the floor. I said, `This is
the beginning of the end of my marriage.'''
   Enter a team of Roto-Rooter employees.
   The workers tore up the front lawn, built a special dam and
flushed gallons of water into a sewer main.
   And they found it.
   ``I gave them all the champagne out of my refrigerator,'' said
McDonald, a 27-year-old flight attendant. ``I was just passing it
out in the street.''
   ``It was a real long shot,'' said Dean Williamson, a Roto-Rooter
employee. ``I didn't think myself that we'd ever get it.''
   Trish and Gary McDonald were married on schedule, May 20.
