Be careful about where you sit in the Sangamon County Building, where the 
toilets have been exploding lately. 
</P>
<P>
A water tank in the building's basement filled with air Tuesday, and the excess 
pressure caused five toilets to be blown apart, sending the porcelain flying. 
</P>
<P>
Court reporter Jerry Wedeking was a witness. He flushed a toilet in a 
fourth-floor jury room and saw dollar-size pieces of porcelain fly around him. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing I did was check to see if there were any pieces sticking in 
me," said Wedeking, a 27-year courthouse veteran.
