<LEADPARA>  Mary Perry explains the Campbell Union School District's need for $39 million
in general obligation bonds in very basic terms. How do you teach kids if the
plumbing gives out?;   "You have to do a lot of things if the toilets don't
flush," said Perry, a trustee in the district and chairwoman of Yes on Measure
B. "We don't want to have to make a choice between being able to flush toilets
and being able to provide a quality educational program."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When voters in the district go to the polls Nov. 5, they will be asked to
decide on a bond measure that will cost homeowners about $23.30 per year for
every $100,000 in assessed value of their home. The owner of a home valued at
$250,000 would pay about $56 annually for 25 years.;   For supporters of the
bond measure, the needs are obvious. Campbell Union has 11 schools in
Campbell, San Jose, Saratoga and Los Gatos which range in age from 25 to more
than 40 years. The district expects 1,000 new students in the next five years.
And, the schools are not prepared for the technology needs of the next
century.;   "We have classrooms that have two (electrical) outlets. That makes
it very difficult to use computers," said Perry.;   If approved, uses for bond
money will include:;   (check) Renovating schools, including heating, plumbing
and electrical systems.;   (check) Updating classrooms for technology.;  
(check) Housing additional students and providing additional space for child
care.;   (check) Adding or upgrading library-media centers at all schools.;  
One of the challenges facing bond supporters is that they need a two-thirds
majority vote to pass the measure in an area where less than 20 percent of the
residents have children in the district. So Perry said they must convince
voters of the value of schools for everyone.;   "We as a society have decided
public education is a community responsibility," she said. "In addition,
quality public schools enhance the quality of a community.";   Organized
opposition to the bond has come from the Libertarian Party, which has no
problem with Campbell Union specifically but with public education in general,
according to a spokesman.;   Mark Hinkle, vice-chairman of the Northern
California Libertarian Party, said, "In general, throwing more money at the
problem isn't the solution.";   "We see school districts asking for more and
more money for worse and worse results," he said.;   The Libertarian Party
opposes the "forced collection of money" in general and is opposing similar
elections in other local school districts, Hinkle said.;   Perry said in
response that Campbell is a fiscally responsible district with critical
needs.;   "I would challenge them to find a way to educate children without
buildings," she said. "When the roofing goes, it goes.";   Some in the
community have also questioned $182,000 in renovations recently completed to
the 35-year-old district office, but Perry said those renovations were put off
several times over a period of years. School officials proceeded with them
when asbestos began breaking through floor tiles, she said. Repairs included
interior and exterior paint, flooring and ceiling work and some lighting
work.; Measure B ballot language: Shall Campbell Union School District issue
bonds for acquisition and improvements to real property used for education,
including the construction and rehabilitation of new and existing classrooms,
computer labs, library/media centers and repairs for student safety, in an
amount not to exceed $39 million, with an interest rate not to exceed the
statutory limit of 12 percent?  </TEXT>
