<TEXT>
<P>
In an east Pasadena neighborhood of well-kept residences along Mountain Avenue, 
a dozen people in polo shirts were on a house-to-house mission. 
</P>
<P>
They knocked. Householders opened doors and let the crew of perfect strangers 
invade their privacy, explore their bathrooms and even issue comments on their 
cleaning habits. 
</P>
<P>
At one house, the visitor showed a woman that, by simply removing the bottom of 
her refrigerator, she could clean the dust from the cooling coils, improving 
the energy-guzzler's efficiency -- and saving money on her the electric bill. 
</P>
<P>
Down the street, another visitor replaced a shower head with one that uses half 
the water, potentially saving nearly 50 gallons per shower. In a commode, she 
installed a flexible metal-and-hard-plastic device called a toilet dam, said to 
save half a gallon per flush. 
</P>
<P>
At still another house, the guest installed a super-efficient, long-lasting 
fluorescent light bulb in a coffee table lamp. The bulb, which sells for $10 to 
$15, can more than pay for itself over its five- to 10-year lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
But this one was free, courtesy of the city and its new "Lite Bill" energy 
conservation program. 
</P>
<P>
"This ties in nicely because I'm keen on recycling too," an amazed Megan 
Elliott said last week after she received her free conservation kit from one of 
the polo-shirted workers going door-to-door. "I didn't know about a lot of this 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope that other residents will be pleased with the smorgasbord 
of approaches for cutting water and electric use in the city, and, in turn, 
reduce consumers' bills and the city's own energy-related expenses. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena, which operates one of the four municipal utilities in the Los Angeles 
Basin, has within the last six months embarked on an ambitious program that 
city officials say goes beyond federal and state mandates on energy 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the city began a water survey and inspection program for residential 
users who use large amounts of water. The program, open to all water customers, 
provides conservation ideas. 
</P>
<P>
In November, the Lite Bill program started. It will reach 37,000 residences 
this year. The retail value of the free materials being handed out door-to-door 
is about $60 per residence; the city's cost is $25. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city has adopted a rate system that encourages 
conservation, especially during the summer months of peak demand: Rates are 
increased for consumers who use large amounts of water. 
</P>
<P>
The city has also adopted rules that require all new municipal landscaping to 
use plants that flourish in the semi-desert of Southern California. City 
officials say they want to set a good model for the rest of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Eighteen months ago, the city created the Resource Planning and Conservation 
Division of the city's Water and Power Department. "Conservation programs did 
exist, but there weren't as many or as intense," said Mariann Long, the city's 
conservation and consumer programs coordinator, who previously had worked in a 
similar Santa Monica municipal project. 
</P>
<P>
Still, some environmentalists say the city has taken too long to implement the 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still not satisfied," said activist Tim Brick, a member of the city's 
utility advisory panel and the city's representative on the board of the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Yet critics acknowledge that, when compared to the other three municipal 
utilities in Los Angeles County, Pasadena spends a far greater portion of its 
revenues to promote conservation. 
</P>
<P>
An analysis of the latest spending of revenues by the region's four municipal 
utilities shows that Pasadena spends $18 for every $1,000 of revenue to help 
customers cut water and electric usage. Utility leaders in the field nationally 
spend nearly twice as much as that. 
</P>
<P>
In comparison, Los Angeles spends $6.80 per $1,000, and Glendale and Burbank 
even less: Burbank, $2 per $1,000, and Glendale, $1 per $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Pasadena officials boast that no other city-operated utility in the 
country goes to such great lengths on so many fronts. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the municipal utilities are looking at either water or electricity. 
What we're saying is that there's a synergy between the two," said Deputy City 
Manager Edward K. Aghjayan, who oversees the Water and Power Department. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason why we can't reduce water and electric consumption by 25%. 
In terms of the positive impact on the environment and scarcity of resources 
alone, we could justify our expenditures on conservation," said Aghjayan, who, 
before coming to Pasadena four years ago, had set up nationally recognized 
conservation programs in Austin, Tex., and Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
As an example of the voluntary conservation approach Pasadena is actively 
encouraging, Aghjayan cited the new Doubletree Hotel, where special 
low-water-use toilets were installed at the city's suggestion. The toilets cost 
the hotel's developer an extra $30,000, Aghjayan said, but there will be a 50% 
savings on water needed to flush, and an overall reduction of 25% to 30% of the 
hotel's water bill. In two years, he said, the hotel will have recouped the 
expense. 
</P>
<P>
Over the long term, conservation makes economic sense for a utility company and 
for consumers, he said. "To the extent that our customers conserve, they not 
only save money for themselves but we save money by not having to build more 
facilities, improve power plants or treat more water." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, when consumers use less power, the city generates less, he said. 
That helps because the city's power plant faces increasingly tighter 
restrictions on the amount of emissions it can legally release while it 
generates power. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting on the bandwagon late, but we're getting on with a bang," said 
City Director Rick Cole. "There's some justification to the boast that we're 
going beyond what other (communities) are doing." 
</P>
<P>
But Cole expressed concern that the city, in its aggressive pursuit of 
progress, may give the appearance of establishing a "water police force" to 
penalize those who don't comply. 
</P>
<P>
However, Thomas E. Pape, a city conservation program specialist, said: "It's no 
hard sell and we're not the water police or the energy police. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of what we do is salesmanship. We're trying to show that it's easy and 
it's low cost and the savings are guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
The Lite Bill program will cost about $800,000 this year. In addition, the city 
expects its conservation programs to cost it $200,000 in lost revenues over 
five years because of lower consumption. Yet the city will save in other ways, 
and will receive a $373,000 credit for water-savings efforts from the 
Metropolitan Water District. The incentive is offered because the district can 
reduce its pumping expenses when use goes down. 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena's efforts, meanwhile, are not occurring in a vacuum. On Wednesday, a 
coalition of environmentalists, utility executives and state officials 
announced a $550-million proposal to boost California to the forefront of 
energy conservation. Under the plan, the state's four major utilities would 
double what they spend to encourage conservation. 
</P>
<P>
It would provide rebates to customers who install energy-saving devices such as 
super-efficient light bulbs -- just like the ones the people in polo shirts 
passed out last week on Mountain Avenue in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
