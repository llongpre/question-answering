The Simi Valley City Council on Monday will consider adopting a mandatory water 
conservation ordinance that would only be implemented in the event of an 
emergency, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which supplies water to 
areas of the east county, has urged all of its customers to adopt water-saving 
ordinances so that they will be prepared if cuts in their water supplies become 
necessary, said Ron Coons, director of Simi Valley's Department of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
Water district officials said Friday that they will reassess statewide drought 
conditions next month to determine if any cuts are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"If we cannot voluntarily conserve water, then this may be prudent for us to 
do," Coons said of the possibility of implementing the mandatory measures. 
</P>
<P>
The city has already taken some actions to reduce water usage. Earlier this 
month, the council voted to require all new construction projects to use 
ultra-low flush toilets and urinals. The city is also providing water-efficient 
shower heads free of charge and continues to send out notices urging residents 
to voluntarily conserve. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Councilwoman Ann Rock said, the city several years ago undertook a 
major capital improvement program to reduce the amount of water leaking from 
city pipes from about 12% to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we have done a great deal," Rock said. "What else we can do depends on 
the severity of the drought. It may be that sometime in the future we are going 
to have to mandate. We're pretty much dependent on what the Metropolitan Water 
District is going to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
Coons said city staff had consulted with water officials as well as business 
people in the community to get their assistance in putting the mandatory water 
conservation ordinance together. 
</P>
<P>
Should the need arise, the mandatory ordinance would be implemented in three 
phases, with each phase requiring a public hearing before it could take effect, 
Coons said. 
</P>
<P>
Penalties for violations of the ordinance would range from a simple warning to 
fines and other stringent measures, such as requiring customers to install 
water efficient shower heads, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the first phase of the ordinance, residents would be prohibited from 
watering their lawns between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., and watering would only be 
allowed every other day. Residents would not be allowed to fill fountains or 
ponds except with recycled water, and restaurants could not serve water unless 
it was requested. 
</P>
<P>
The second phase of the ordinance would include limiting the watering of lawns 
between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. every third day, Coons said. Water-dependent 
industries, such as commercial nurseries and golf courses, would be required to 
water before 10 a.m. or after 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Phase three would involve a 20% reduction in water usage by all residents. Some 
restrictions would include watering lawns by bucket or by slow-drip irrigation, 
city officials said.
