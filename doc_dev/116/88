<HEAD>Toilet Rat Cure: Flush Them Back Down</HEAD>

   Rats are scurrying into residents' toilets
with increased frequency as a major sewer project is completed
around the city, a city official says. His solution: ``Flush them
right back down.''
   Bernie Fritz, animal control supervisor for the city, said
Wednesday the rodent problem has worsened as the new system
gradually eliminated the rats' usual exits from sewers _
street-corner catch basins.
   ``They are seeking food and water,'' Fritz said. ``The toilet has
the biggest opening, so the rodents swim through the water and pop
their heads right up.''
   The elimination of catch basins that trap refuse swept into the
sewers also has hurt efforts to control the rat population. The most
convenient and effective way to kill the rodents has been by putting
poison in the catch basins, Fritz said.
   The rat problem has not reached a crisis stage, he said, but the
increased number of rodents in areas where catch basins have been
eliminated has left public health employees seeking a new way to
control them.
   The sewer project, now in its fourth year, creates separate lines
for sanitary and storm sewers. The sewers had been combined, which
occasionally posed health and environmental problems.
   Fritz told the City Council's Public Works Committee Wednesday
that workers have begun attaching poison to pieces of plywood that
they then hang from manholes into the sanitary sewers that run down
city streets.
   Workers have begun a three-month test to make sure the plan works
and to better judge how much more money it might cost the city,
Fritz said.
   Fritz said residents in the vicinity of sewer separation work can
make sure basement toilet lids are shut and floor drains closed.
   And if they find a rat in the toilet?
   ``The best thing to do is shut the lid and flush them right back
down,'' he said.
