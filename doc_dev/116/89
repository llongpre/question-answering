SIERRA CLUB THREATENS TO STALL SEWAGE PLANT PACT

The local Sierra Club chapter threatened Thursday to hold up the city of San 
Diego's tentative legal settlement with three other government agencies on 
construction of a $2.8-billion sewage system because the plan contains no 
meaningful water-conservation provisions. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sierra Club's attorney conceded that it is still unclear whether the 
environmental organization, which has intervenor status in the complex 
litigation, can hold up a settlement among the city, the state Water Quality 
Control Board, the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"It is the Sierra Club's position that, yes, it would not be appropriate for a 
consent decree to be executed without having the Sierra Club a signatory to 
it," said William Benjamin, a Sierra Club attorney. "But that decision has not 
yet been made." 
</P>
<P>
City attorneys maintain the opposite position -- that they can settle their 
differences on a construction timetable for the huge sewage system upgrading 
without the Sierra Club. The Sierra Club is entitled only to a hearing before 
U.S. District Judge Rudi Brewster to press its objections, said James Dragna, a 
private attorney hired by the city. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the four government agencies have reached a tentative agreement 
that calls for the city to complete the largest public works project in its 
history by Dec. 31, 2003. The settlement is the product of negotiations that 
began even before the federal and state agencies sued the city for missing a 
July, 1988, deadline for compliance with the federal Clean Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
The law requires that all cities upgrade their sewage treatment systems to 
so-called "secondary standards," under which 85% to 90% of suspended solids are 
removed from the effluent before it is dumped in the ocean. The city's existing 
"advanced primary" treatment system removes 75% to 80% of the solids. 
</P>
<P>
City planners have drawn up a $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion renovation project 
that includes the upgrading of the city's Point Loma treatment plant, another 
secondary treatment plant in the South Bay and six water reclamation plants 
around the city. The plants would yield as much as 135 million gallons of water 
each day for reuse on golf courses, parks and highway medians. 
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Thursday, the Sierra Club pressed its longstanding demand 
that the council reduce the 190 million gallons per day of effluent being 
treated at the city's Point Loma sewage plant to 100 million gallons daily by 
1999. 
</P>
<P>
That could be accomplished, the Sierra Club contends, by replacing every toilet 
in the Metropolitan Sewerage System with 1.6 gallon ultra-low volume toilets. 
The effort would allow for a drastic downsizing of the planned construction 
project and save ratepayers, who will foot the bill for the system, a 
substantial sum, Sierra Club members said. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, the Sierra Club is offering a plan under which the city 
would reduce the total sewage flow by 50 million gallons daily within eight 
years, but only if it also devoted any fines for past sewage spills to a 
sizable water conservation effort. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA is demanding the fines, which could total millions of dollars, as 
payment for sewage spills into local waterways dating back to 1983. No 
settlement has been reached on the penalties, which are the subject of separate 
negotiations and could be the basis of a separate trial before Brewster if no 
deal is reached. 
</P>
<P>
The money could be used as sewage fee rebates or other forms of incentives to 
promote installation of the ultra-low-volume toilets, according to Sierra Club 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
Besides saving money, the water conservation effort would create excess 
capacity in the system that could accommodate the sewage that will be generated 
by population growth, Emily Durbin, a Sierra Club member and plaintiff in the 
lawsuit, said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dragna, who agreed that the city endorses the Sierra Club's water 
conservation goals, nevertheless said that water conservation is "a whole 
separate issue" not appropriate for inclusion in a legal settlement concerned 
with sewage treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"This document is the vehicle to require (the city's) waste water treatment 
system, not to dictate its water use or growth patterns," Dragna said. 
</P>
<P>
As engineers continue to design and build the system, they can tailor it toward 
a larger water conservation effort, he said.
