tribulations of passengers

Early last Sunday Andrew Lennox was cold, stiff and fed up. After sleeping
for three hours in a corridor, he got up, adjusted the hard hat he had put
on for safety, and set off to find somewhere more comfortable.
A sign saying Purser's Office reminded him where he was. This was not an
unfinished Spanish hotel but the Queen Elizabeth 2, the world's most famous
passenger liner and what the chief executive of Cunard, its owner, would
later call a 'national heritage monument'.
As Mr Lennox wandered deeper into the ship, it hardly resembled a monument.
Cables and pipes protruded from holes in the ceiling, building equipment was
strewn everywhere, and cabin furniture stacked in open spaces. Some
passengers without cabins were sleeping on mattresses, while some of the 400
workers still on board were making themselves comfortable as best they
could.
Later this week, as news of conditions on the QE2 filled the newspapers,
what started as an inconvenience for passengers turned into a public
relations disaster for the liner and its operator. The reputation of the
British ship outfitting industry was also threatened as tales of the 'Horror
Cruise' emerged.
For Mr Lennox, the priority was getting to sleep. Spying an empty cabin on
3-Deck which at least had a bed in it, he lay down. Not the ideal start to
his 30th birthday.
It was also not the way Cunard executives had planned the QE2's Pounds 30m
refit. Twenty-five years after the liner's maiden voyage, the refurbishment
was supposed to prepare it for the 21st century.
'We had to invest in the vessel or take another course,' said Mr Robin
Wilkins, Cunard's commercial director. The 'other course' was building a new
liner.
In addition to structural alterations, all 963 cabins - 720 with en suite
bathrooms - were to be re-equipped; three restaurants, the casino and the
library rebuilt; and two new nightclubs and a pub constructed.
To save on the costs of keeping the liner in dry dock, the refit was to be
attempted in just a month. Although workmen would be on board from July, the
ship would be out of service only from November 14 to December 14 - leaving
it ready to sail on its Christmas cruise on December 17.
That meant thousands of workers from more than 50 companies being flown to
Hamburg's Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard to work to a complex timetable. Cunard
admitted the programme was ambitious but said it was achievable.
'All the contractors knew what they were undertaking and were prepared to
tender for it. They convinced us they could finish on time,' said Mr Michael
Gallagher of Cunard.
By late November, the QE2 was in dry dock and virtually unrecognisable,
buried under a mass of cables, cranes, ladders and workers. On December 13,
as planned, it sailed for Southampton, the vast majority of the work
complete.
But inside, a small number of contractors had fallen behind. When the ship
docked in Southampton the next day, Cunard officials were alarmed at the
state of the cabins and neighbouring corridors, but said they were assured
by contractors that hundreds of men working round the clock could transform
the ship in just a few days.
On Friday December 16, further inspections convinced Cunard officials that
not everyone due to sail on the QE2 the next day could be accommodated.
Determined not to cancel the cruise, Cunard decided to contact some of the
passengers and offer compensation if they abandoned their trip.
'We felt we had a duty and obligation to fulfil the holiday requirements
over the Christmas period. We felt it was very important to stick to that
schedule,' said Mr John Olsen, Cunard's chief executive.
Only 300 passengers could be contacted. Several hundred others arriving in
Southampton the following day faced an unpleasant shock.
Most passengers knew nothing of the problems. They checked in about 2pm and
settled down in the passenger lounge to wait for the 5pm departure.
At 4.30pm Cunard announced there had been a short delay and the ship would
sail at 6pm. Boarding began, with round-the-world cruise passengers escorted
on first.
Two hours later, stewards entered the lounge where almost 300 passengers
were still waiting and made an announcement: owing to delayed completion of
refitting work, insufficient cabins were available and no more passengers
could be taken on board.
'That was perhaps the worst moment of all,' said Mr Lennox. 'There was
absolute chaos.'
The next few hours passed in confusion, as 190 passengers agreed to go home
in return for a full refund, and a free cruise next year, plus Pounds 250
spending money. Added to the 300 whose holidays were cancelled the day
before, that made 490 passengers left behind.
Another 80 insisted on boarding the ship anyway, knowing their cabins would
not be ready. The ship sailed six hours late at 11pm, with many still
looking for somewhere to sleep.
Many of the public areas, as Cunard claimed, had been finished to a high
standard. But in some areas, especially towards the rear of the ship and on
3-Deck, conditions resembled a 'building site'.
Mr Andrew Coad, a Briton living in Montclair, New Jersey, said: 'The higher
up the deck, the less dissatisfied people were. The predominant problems
appeared to be on 2-Deck and 3-Deck.'
Mr Coad, who ended up on 3-Deck, said he and his wife were originally given
a room that had water slopping in the entrance, no carpet, and builders'
materials in the middle of the floor.
'Eventually we went to the purser's office and they told us the ship was
about to sail.' He demanded that the ship did not sail until they had
satisfaction.
Mr Coad and his wife were taken to another cabin that at first seemed
acceptable but had no running water. 'It was three days before we got
running water and 3 1/2 days before the toilet would flush,' Mr Coad said.
Mrs Katherine Justice, 70, and her friend Mrs Megan Taverner, 73, said they
were both suffering from sickness and diarrhoea, but their cabin had no
water, no air conditioning and no flushing toilet.
'We washed in a carafe with two flannels,' Mrs Justice said. 'They gave us a
wine carafe - they put that in there, with ice - and as soon as the ice
melted, we used our flannels to wash: her flannel first, then mine after,
for two days.
'It's horrific what happened to us. We are not the nouveaux riches. It's a
dream, isn't it, the QE2 - somebody kind and loving to look after your every
need. We couldn't even get water.'
Mr Stewart Manville, a 67-year-old museum archivist from White Plains, New
York, said: 'I think the basic problem was that the plumbing job was done in
too much of a hurry. Several times a day you would hear the announcement
'Niagara] Niagara] Niagara]' which meant that the special team that was
there to stem the leaks would come running.
'When I first got on, my toilet worked, thank God. But I was helping a
contractor find bedrooms for some of his workers, and we tried several
cabins where the toilets weren't working. Eventually we figured out that if
you took the douche spray from the bath and sprayed it into the toilet, you
could make it flush.'
To cap everything, the QE2 ran into force nine gales shortly after leaving
Southampton. Seasickness among passengers and workers caused further delays
to refitting, and on Tuesday another 158 UK passengers due to join the
cruise in New York had their holidays cancelled. Cunard's nightmare was
worsening.
Back in London, Cunard found the spotlight trained on its handling of the
affair. Industry observers believe it made many mistakes. The first was
going ahead with the cruise.
A hotel company executive aboard the ship said: 'The best option would have
been to cancel the cruise, apologise and give everyone their money back.'
A second mistake was the failure to take on public relations consultants,
but rely instead on Cunard's two beleaguered press spokesmen to handle
hundreds of calls from the world's media.
'They should have taken on a good agency and begun a massive damage
limitation exercise as soon as the problems began last Saturday,' said a PR
consultant.
Perhaps the biggest mistake, having allowed the cruise to go ahead, was to
fail to make any apology or compensation offer to passengers as they crossed
the Atlantic.
'That was what really irritated us,' said Mr Lennox. 'We never got any kind
of apology from Cunard. But we knew people left behind had already been
offered compensation.'
'We have no complaints about the crew, who were absolutely marvellous,' he
added. 'But Cunard's attitude was terrible.'
Disgruntled passengers met the liner's captain, Ron Warwick, last Tuesday
and asked him to secure an apology and compensation offer from Cunard.
On Wednesday, at an angry meeting with about 250 passengers, Capt Warwick
reported that Cunard had simply advised passengers to write to their nearest
Cunard office when they arrived home.
Some passengers were incensed. About 150, of whom Mr Lennox emerged as
leader, threatened a sit-in in New York until Cunard directors came on board
with offers of compensation.
Not all passengers agreed on the action to be taken, however. Speaking from
the ship on Wednesday, Mr Peter Ludlow, a passenger travelling with his
girlfriend on a Pounds 7,500 cruise to the Caribbean, remarked: 'It's all
getting quite factional here, among the passengers. It's getting a bit like
Bosnia.'
The next day Cunard began its fightback. Mr Olsen gave a press conference in
New York to confirm he would meet the ship.
As the QE2 docked in New York on Thursday night, 11 hours late but in a
better condition than it had left Southampton, Mr Olsen was waiting with
soothing words, an offer of reimbursement for the transatlantic leg of all
passengers' journeys and 25 per cent off another Cunard cruise. The
threatened sit-in was averted but yesterday passengers faced further delays
in sailing after the US Coastguard refused to give the ship a safety
certificate.
US passengers were reported to be planning a class action suit which, if
successful, could cost Cunard millions of dollars. In total, the company
already faces the cost of reimbursing about 1,000 passengers who had paid
between Pounds 500 and Pounds 5,000 for transatlantic cruises and of
providing many with free cruises next year.
There may also be longer-term effects, both for Cunard and other cruise
operators.
'The cost in terms of consumer confidence in the company could be high,'
said Mr Keith Betton of the Association of British Travel Agents.
However, Mr William Gibbons, director of the Passenger Shipping Association,
did not believe the QE2's problems would damage the image of the cruise
industry.
'People perceive the QE2 as a one-off, prestige vessel,' he said. 'Generally
people have a high opinion of cruise holidays and they have short memories.
They will have forgotten about this in a few months.' Those who travelled on
the ship might not forget so quickly.
