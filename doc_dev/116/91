<LEADPARA>  WHETHER you're interested in remodeling -- or just browsing -- you can pick up
dozens of home improvement ideas this weekend at the Orchard Supply Hardware
How To Fair at the Santa Clara County Fairgrounds. The show is open today from
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.;    For 13 years OSH has
given consumers a chance to view new products and talk directly with
manufacturers' representatives. This year is no exception, with more than 365
booths displaying everything from abrasives to work clothes. Nothing is sold
at the show, which makes for a pleasing atmosphere free of pitchmen and sales
pressure.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Here are some of the many new products worth checking out:;    (check)
Future Flush, a new water-saving device for toilets, operates with two toilet
tank handles in the space of the one already in place. One handle is used for
longer flushes for solid waste. A shorter handle is used for shorter flushes
for liquid waste.;    (check) S. L. Waber and Intermatic both will be showing
electrical surge protectors, which protect an entire household full of
electronic and sensitive computer equipment.;    (check) Holmes Hardware will
show an adjustable garage door frame, which allows homeowners to build their
own single or double garage door.;    (check) Eveready has come up with a new
combination flashlight and area lamp that operates on four AA batteries. It's
designed for camping or would be ideal as part of an earthquake kit.;   
(check) SmartLevel, one of my personal favorite high-tech tools, is a highly
accurate and easily recalibrated electronic level. It will be demonstrated by
Wedge Innovations.;    (check) Orchard Supply is also introducing a new line
of high-efficiency pleated heating and cooling filters, designed to remove
smaller dust particles than standard heating and cooling filters.;    Before
you leave home, jot down on a note pad questions that you would like answered
by product experts in attendance. Record dimensions and details of the areas
you're interested in improving. The pad is also a good place to record ideas,
suggestions and product details for future reference.;    Q A wrought-iron
bench was bolted to the patio concrete. When it was removed, the workman
pulled out some metal tubes that held the bolts and the concrete broke on the
surface. It looks terrible in four fist-size spots. What can I do to fix
them?;    A Buy a box of Mr. Mac's Concrete Fix, which contains cement, liquid
additive and easy-to-follow instructions. Clean the damaged areas of concrete.
Mix the Fix according to directions. Apply with a trowel, smooth, and let
dry.;    Because you are applying new cement to old concrete, you will not
have a perfect color match, but the finished job should be an improvement and
certainly safer than the damaged area. When it is necessary to remove concrete
anchors it is best to drill them out rather than pull them out.;    Q I pulled
out the valve stems in a bathroom faucet and replaced the washers, hoping that
that would correct an annoying squeaking sound when water was turned on. The
noise is still there. Does this mean that I will need to replace the entire
faucet stem?;    A The threads on the faucet stem may need lubricating with
heat-resistant plumber's grease. If you had been hearing an annoying and
vibrating chatter, the problem would probably have been a loose or badly worn
washer.;    Q How do I restore the paper backing on a picture frame?;    A I
assume that you mean the dust cover on the back of the frame. Art supply
stores sell double stick tape made for this purpose.;    You could do it the
old-fashioned way. Remove as much old paper as possible from the back of the
frame molding. Cut a piece of paper at least 2 inches larger than the frame
back and moisten it with a damp sponge. Coat the back of the frame molding
with an even coat of white glue or carpenter's glue.;    Place the damp paper
over the back of the frame and smooth it out as tight as possible. You should
have at least 1 inch of paper hanging over each edge. With a pair of sharp
scissors, razor blade or knife make cuts through the excess paper up to each
corner of the frame.;    As the paper dries it will shrink and should be
nearly drumhead tight. To remove the excess paper, wrap a piece of 280 grit
sandpaper around a wooden block and carefully sand through the dust cover
along the frame edges at a 45-degree angle. Sand slowly as you only want to
sand through the backing paper.  </TEXT>
