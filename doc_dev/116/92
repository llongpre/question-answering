   At the Randy Bishop home in the heart of
south central Iowa's parched cattle country, the well has been dry
since September and hauling water has become routine.
   So has wearing clothes longer between washings for Bishop, his
wife, Christine, and three young children, turning off the shower
between lathering up and rinsing and leaving to Mommy the decision
on when to flush the toilet.
   Farming is now even more of a gamble in the stunted pastures
nestled amid roller-coaster hills along the Iowa-Missouri border,
where rainfall has been less than 50 percent of normal since
January 1988.
   There were a few generous showers in May, allowing newly planted
corn and soybeans to sprout, raising spirits and turning pastures
green. Farmers now say that with a few more timely rains, they may
have enough moisture to raise corn stalks tall enough to chop up
for silage to sustain their cattle, even if there's not enough rain
for the crop to mature and be harvested.
   ``I'm not sure we can catch up in one year and get back to even
halfway normal,'' says Bishop as his pickup truck bumps across a
pasture seven miles south of Mount Ayr. G I mow it, there's
nothing to rake up.''
   Normally, the Memorial Day Weekend is when farmers begin to
harvest the first of several cuttings of the hay crop.
   ``I don't know when it's going to be this year,'' Smith says.
   Smith, 65, remembers his father surviving the Dust Bowl years of
the 1930s without electricity and air conditioning.
   ``It seemed hotter in the '30s. But it certainly didn't last as
long,'' he says.
   Average rainfall in Iowa from May 1988 through the end of April
1989 is 22.08 inches, 10 inches below normal and nine inches less
than the same period a year earlier that led up to the Drought of
1988.
   At Blockton, total rain from Jan. 1, 1988, through the end of
April came to 16.86 inches, just 40 percent of the normal 41.91
inches for that 16-month period and the lowest of 162 official
measuring sites in the state.
   Blockton Mayor Richard Melvin had to scramble up to the roof of
his plumbing supply business to make repairs after a recent rain.
``We didn't have enough rain to go through the cracks before
then,'' he said.
   The National Guard has been hauling water for household use to
one southeast Iowa community and eight in south central Iowa since
May 8. Four of those cities are around Blockton.
   Although Blockton's municipal well is deep enough to ensure
water supplies to the community's 120 households, most surrounding
farms are in trouble and some farmers are traveling almost 80 miles
roundtrip to haul water.
   ``Last year the wells went dry, but we had ponds. Now the ponds
are going dry,'' Melvin said.
   In Corning, where water shortages following droughts in the
mid-1970s led to the development of ample water supplies, water
sales to individuals are up sharply.
   The municipal water works has a coin-operated machine that
dispenses 50 gallons of water for 25 cents. Sales, which totaled
about 25,000 gallons in all of January 1988, ran above 535,000
gallons this month, says Dean Davis, director of the municipal
utility. About three-fourths of those sales are for household use,
and farmers also have been buying water for mixing with chemicals
to control insects and weeds.
   When there is rain, it immediately is soaked up in the loose top
inches of the soil, never reaching deep enough to be stored for the
rest of the growing season or to flow into depleted farm ponds and
rivers.
   Davis, checking on the installation of new street lights, said
6-foot deep holes revealed bone-dry earth below a narrow band of
moist topsoil.
   That is a major worry.
   Subsoil moisture is deemed 100 percent inadequate throughout
south central Iowa.
   In last year's drought, it was ample subsoil moisture at the
start of the planting season that enabled many farmers to avoid
being wiped out.
   ``The lack of water is more scary than the lack of feed,'' Smith
says. ``Everyone's trying to hang on. But everybody I talk to says,
`When I run out of water I'm getting rid of them (cattle).'''
   So far, there's been no rush to liquidate breeding herds.
   But at the rural Corning farm of Ralph Neill, productivity
records on each cow are being reviewed to decide which ones to send
to the slaughterhouse if feed becomes scarce.
   The 51-year-old farmer, whose family has been working the remote
fields since 1875, says he knows such action is risky.
   ``If I don't save replacement heifers, every year the average
age of the cows gets one year older and you get in a perilous
situation,'' he says.
   He used to wait for a truckload of cattle before making the trip
to market to sell the weakest stock from his herd, but this day, he
was preparing to sell four cows that had lost calves.
   With feed scarce, there's no excuse for keeping marginal stock
on hand, he says.
   Cattlemen in the drought area say the May rains have been enough
to keep them going another 30-45 days even if no more rain falls.
   But many veterans say they've made their cutbacks early.
   Bill Henderson, a fifth-generation farmer near Clearfield who
says nine of his 14 ponds have run dry, reduced his herd by 25
percent a year ago.
   ``You make contingency plans way in advance,'' says Henderson.
