<HEAD>Hard Toilet Paper Flushed Away</HEAD>

   One of the two British companies still making hard
toilet paper abandoned production of it Wednesday with a ceremonial
final flush down an 1890 toilet at London's Science Museum.
   ``Today's consumers simply prefer a softer option,'' said David
Driver de Valle, general marketing manager of British Tissues.
   The company decided to do away with its hard toilet paper, known
as Bronco, after a major customer, British Rail, switched to softer
tissues for train bathrooms last year.
   Ron Day, former managing director of Bronco, carried out the
final flushing of the last sheet of paper at the Science Museum.
Another brand of hard toilet paper, Izal, is still available.
   Soft tissue arrived from the United States in the 1930s but
wartime rationing halted imports to Britain, so the rougher brands
survived. But customers over the years began opting for the softer
tissue.
   De Valle said the brand name Bronco will survive, but he refused
to reveal details of the new product. ``We couldn't let a name as
famous as Bronco die out after 100 years,'' he said.
