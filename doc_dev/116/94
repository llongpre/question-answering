<LEADPARA>  THE NOTICE on my Palo Alto water bill sounded ominous: "Your water use during
this billing period was higher than our winter goal of 7 CCF per household."; 
  I knew the water police would catch up with me eventually. My lawn was still
embarrassingly green even though most of the green stuff was clover. My shower
takes forever to heat up in the morning and I was just letting the cold water
run down the drain. My 1-year-old loves to splash in the toilet, so I'd been
flushing after every use.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     My neighbors who are morally superior to me had been siphoning off their
bath water for months to dump on the yard. I couldn't look them in the eye.;  
 So there it was. I had exceeded the dread 7 CCF limit. But nowhere on the
bill did it say how many CCFs I had used or, for that matter, what the heck a
CCF was. I looked in the dictionary but the only definition I found was
"Cooperative Commonwealth Federation of Canada.";    Palo Alto's water bills
are infuriating. Mine told me I had used 222.1 gallons per day and 19 "water
units" since the meter was read two months ago. In tiny type at the bottom of
the page it said that 1 water unit equals 748 gallons, but it said nothing
about converting that to CCFs.;    I called the city's water and energy
services department to complain about the bill. How do they expect people to
monitor their water use, I asked, if they can't figure out how much water
they're using? Why doesn't the bill say what a CCF is?;    "It doesn't?" She
sounded mildly interested and suggested I call customer service. But she did
clear up the mystery for me. A CCF is 100 cubic feet and it is the same as a
water unit. (So why don't they say so?) She said 7 CCFs is the limit for the
average family of 2.5 people. (You know, that average couple with half a
child.);    Our four-person family is allotted 11 CCFs, she said, or 276
gallons per day. At 222.1 gallons per day, we were well under the limit. So
why the nasty notice? Probably because the computer saw 19 water units, didn't
realize it was a two-month total, and spit out a warning.;    Whew. So I
wasn't a water criminal. I was so pleased that I even agreed to let her send
me some water-saver kits for my toilets.;    I was feeling smug as I hung up,
knowing what a CCF was, so I called customer service to suggest they change
the language on the bills.;    But when I got a recording that said: "We are
in a meeting," I decided I'd expended enough energy on this one. Besides, by
that time the shower was good and hot.  </TEXT>
