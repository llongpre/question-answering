<LEADPARA>  THE longer I own a house, the easier I am to please. Earlier this week, I was
dancing on air because I had found a small piece of leather. Finding it meant
my quest for the leather piston plunger had ended.;   After four days and
unsuccessful visits to two hardware stores and a plumbing supply house, I
found the elusive piece of leather and a companion rubber ballcock washer at a
store about 10 miles from my house.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  FLUSH WITH VICTORY OVER BALKY TOILET  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Now that the leather washer and its companion are in place, the household's
busiest water closet is functioning again, just in time to accommodate a
carload of visiting cousins from Vermont.;   In addition to restoring family
harmony, and preventing a big water bill, fixing the toilet was a great
victory of man over machine.;   In an ideal world, man and machine work in
perfect harmony. But in the real world we skirmish. A few days ago, for
instance, the newspaper computer did something its keepers promised would
never happen. It wiped out several stories, including an earlier version of
this column. The machines won that battle. But I beat the toilet.;   When the
toilet first started misbehaving, I did what I am supposed to do when my kids
act up. I got down to its level and listened to the troublemaker.;   I spent a
good portion of Sunday afternoon staring at the inside of a toilet tank. What
I heard and saw was a waterfall. Now some folks think all waterfalls are
photogenic. I say it depends on where the water is falling.;   If it is
landing in a river or a mountain stream, then the waterfall is downright
scenic. But when the water is falling down the overflow tube of a toilet tank,
even Ansel Adams couldn't make it into a pretty postcard.;   At first I tried
tinkering with the toilet. I took everything apart, sanded off any corrosion
and then put the pieces of the ballcock apparatus back in place. I stole this
tinkering approach from business management theory. The theory holds that as
long as it appears that bosses are concerned about employee well-being, the
workers will be productive. So by taking the ballcock apart, I was letting it
know I cared.;   But the ballcock didn't care that I cared. It continued to
balk.;   Next I tried to massage the old washer on the ballcock plunger. I
figured that if a massage revived my tired old body parts, it might have the
same restorative effect on the worn-out washer. I figured wrong.;   Finally I
gave the toilet a few days off, and hunted for replacement parts.;   It was a
frustrating, tiring undertaking. I carried the ballcock part from store to
store and presented it to plumbing parts sales clerk after plumbing parts
sales clerk asking if they could help. Time and time again I was rejected.;  
But one night I found the parts I needed. I was excited. I raced home and
while still wearing my shirt and tie, put the toilet back together again.;  
Victory was sweet. But just in case my fortunes shift, I bought extra parts.  </TEXT>
