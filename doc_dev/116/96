<LEADPARA>  LISA Stapleton wants to do her part to ease the demand for water by installing
a small cistern system to quench the thirst of a small grove of fruit trees
she's planted around her South San Jose home.;    Likewise, Gillian Gibbs of
Saratoga plans on watering her half-acre of landscaping with rainwater from an
updated version of the cistern systems she grew up with as a child in South
Africa.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A run on plastic trash cans and other containers homeowners bought to slip
under their downspouts when it rained buckets earlier this week also revealed
a growing interest in cisterns as an answer to the dry state we live in.;   
But before you install a professional cistern system, you should read the
regulations that govern them and learn about their inherent problems. As
interest grows, you can bet your water bill that slippery salespeople will
prowl the new market looking to cash in on collecting rainwater.;    Cisterns,
any above or below ground receptacle used to capture and store water (usually
rainwater), have been widely used for eons in the Middle East, Africa, the
Mediterranean and other arid regions of the world.;    It's difficult to
figure water cost savings with a cistern unless you live in an area affected
by surcharges or special costs for landscape water use. For many who have
installed or are considering installing a cistern system, it's more of a
personal environmental concern.;    "We are making a greater burden on the
land and figured it was a way to at least support those trees," Stapleton
said.;    Since 1977 California's "cistern king," William C. Woodworth of
Pacific Grove, has collected rainwater in 10 plastic and metal tanks and
preaches the word on the ancient practice.;    The retired Air Force
meteorologist has perhaps one of the most elaborate systems with a total
holding capacity of 1,200 gallons. He fills the tanks during rainstorms,
empties them for irrigation between rainstorms and, in a good year, collects
and uses 15,000 to 20,000 gallons of rainwater.;    "I do my landscaping
primarily. But I also flush my toilets with it. You can wash your car,
clothes, you can do everything with it except drinking and cooking," Woodworth
says. Horticulturists and health and sanitation experts agree.;    Woodworth,
who advised Stapleton about her needs, says he knows of 100 other Monterey
Peninsula residents who use cistern systems ranging from garbage cans under a
downspout to a 150,000-gallon capacity system under construction for a $3
million home in Hidden Hills near Salinas.;    Jonathan Cranch, in charge of
engineering, design and construction for the new Walnut Creek-based Cistern
Concepts Inc., says 50-gallon garbage cans under a downspout are a start, but
even in a brief rain the cans will soon overflow. A 4,000-square-foot roof can
collect 2,500 to 2,600 gallons of water from just an inch of rain.;   
Collecting and storing water in any large amount from 50 gallons to thousands
of gallons isn't as simple as redirecting downspouts.;    The systems, which
can cost from a few thousand dollars to $10,000 or more, demand some kind of
filtering system to sift out debris, and safety precautions to keep breeding
mosquitoes out and kids and pets from tumbling in. And the cisterns should be
constructed with some kind of opening to allow maintenance.;    Larry Wilson,
superintendent of the Ground Water Protection Division of the Santa Clara
Valley Water District, has a list of cistern concerns he'd like to check with
contractors before they start installing tanks below or above ground.;   
There are no specific state regulations that govern cistern design and
engineering. Installers, like Cistern Concepts, are required only to earn a
general contractor's license.;    Building officials say permits are required
for most large cistern installations that include new plumbing or electrical
wiring or additions to a property's existing plumbing and electrical systems.
Electrical pumps are often used to either irrigate or pump the rainwater up to
surface cisterns. Otherwise, permits may not be required, but that could mean
that a building official would not visit the site to make sure the
construction was sound.;    In any event, underground cistern installation
must adhere to a countywide water district ordinance called "Standards for the
Construction and Destruction of Wells and other Deep Excavations." Other
counties have similar ordinances.;    "The cistern might not be a problem, but
it's the pathway it provides. If it is five or more feet deep, we are trying
to protect the groundwater basin's clay layer," Wilson said.;    The clay
layer in the earth acts as in impermeable barrier against some contaminants
such as pesticides, septic tank overflow and other potentially toxic
materials.;    Wilson also cited seismic considerations, leaks that could
allow water to undermine a home's foundation and inadvertent cross-connection
with the existing potable water supply.;    "I hate to be so negative. I like
to see people conserve water. But there are some things to look at. My own
feeling is that this is not a good solution," says Wilson.;    Cranch says
Cistern Concepts isn't presenting its services as a short-term answer to the
drought, but as part of long-term water supply management. Woodworth is a
consultant to the company, and Cranch says the firm is taking great care to
perfect the technology for use by homeowners in California.;    "I don't
consider his (Wilson's) concerns negative. He's trying to protect the
citizenry and we are doing the same thing.";    Wilson said homeowners and
contractors can call him about cistern questions. They should also check with
local building departments about permit requirements for the systems. Finding
an experienced installer is a major problem. Few exist. Cistern Concepts has
yet to install its first unit.;    Nevertheless, from what I've learned,
cisterns can help take some of the burden off our demands for landscaping and
some other non-potable water needs. Wilson, Cranch, Woodworth and others
should huddle, study the issue and begin to develop specific guidelines and
standards. We don't need a cistern full of confusing new regulations. Adjuncts
to existing construction and water use standards should suffice.;   
Homeowners, who in the end will either benefit from such an effort or suffer
from the lack of it, should supply the questions.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;
