Sanki Engineering Co. Ltd., Japan] 
  [Text] Plans to regenerate building wastewater for reuse 
are being actively promoted for implementation, with an 
increasing number of wastewater regeneration installations 
(water reclamation systems) coming into operation every year. 
This is not only because the need is created by the already 
existing limitation to further development of water resources in 
urban areas as well as by the growing water demand in cities due 
to shortages of water, but also because the public sewer system 
is beginning to have relative shortages in capacity due to the 
ever-increasing volume of wastewater, as a result of the 
gravitation of the population toward cities. 
  Under such circumstances Sanki Engineering succeeded in 
developing its wastewater reclamation system utilizing the 
ultrafiltration membrane separation (UF membrane) technology. 
This treatment technology combines the activated sludge process 
with membrane separation. Since 1980 when its first full-scale 
installation came into being as a commercial size MSR (Membrane 
Sewage Reclamation) System Sanki Engineering has successfully 
installed a great number of plants utilizing this technology. At 
the same time the company has undertaken maintenance and 
operation management for these plants and through this 
experience has developed and acquired a broad knowledge of 
problems associated with operation management. 
  Building on this extensive operating experience Sanki 
Engineering discusses here the outline of the building 
wastewater regeneration and reuse technology incorporating the 
UF membrane separation technology. 
<H5>  1. Basic Requirements for a Building Wastewater Regeneration </H5>
System 
  As the basic requirements, the system must: 
  (1) be installed in small space; 
  (2) be easy to operate and maintain; 
  (3) produce treated water of high and stable quality; 
  (4) not cause secondary nuisance such as an odor problem, 
etc. 
<H5>  2. Selection of Flowsheets Recommended for Systems </H5>
Incorporating UF Membrane Separation Technology 
  Several alternative process flows can be considered as 
systems incorporating the UF membrane separation technology. 
  Introduced here is a representative process flow combining 
UF 
membrane separation with biological treatment (activated sludge 
process). Although some types of system flows do not incorporate 
biological treatment, it should be safe to adopt a system flow 
combined with biological treatment for building wastewater 
regeneration, since it is almost impossible to exclude living 
wastewater when reuse is considered within standard office 
buildings. 
  This paper discusses later ``The Kinds of Wastewater To Be 
Regenerated and Their Uses.'' 
<H5>  3. Kinds of Wastewater To Be Regenerated and Their Uses </H5>
  Building wastewater is classified into low BOD loading 
wastewater such as from washstands, washbasins, etc. and high 
BOD loading wastewater such as kitchen wastewater and sewage 
(toilet flush water), but any kind of building wastewater can in 
principle be regenerated for reuse, regardless of its source. 
  Special caution, however, is needed when the latter is used 
by itself or in case its mixing ratio is higher even when used 
together with low BOD loading wastewater. 
  The point is that it is necessary to remove oily substance 
contained in kitchen wastewater or to take necessary measures 
with the treated water (regenerated water for reuse) for its 
color in case of sewage. 
  3-1. Low BOD Loading Wastewater 
  (1) Wastewater From Washstands, Washbasins and Hot Water 
Makers 
  Wastewater from these sources amounts to about 10 percent of 
the total wastewater volume discharged from a standard office 
building, and, because lower in contaminants loading, should be 
given priority for reuse from a water quality standpoint. 
  In many cases, however, the volume of wastewater from these 
sources alone may not be sufficient to cover the required 
quantity of regenerated water. 
  (2) Blow Water From Cooling Towers 
  Wastewater from this source is virtually free from 
contaminants loading and of good quality, and, therefore, should 
be recovered for reuse, separately from living wastewater. 
  This kind of wastewater can be adequately treated for reuse 
by a simple method such as a usual type of filtration plus 
sterilization. 
  This kind of wastewater can be effectively treated together 
with rainwater, and does not require an application of the UF 
membrane separation system for its treatment. 
  3-2. High BOD Loading Wastewater 
  (1) Kitchen Wastewater 
  This is wastewater discharged from corporate dining rooms 
and 
other eating and drinking establishments. This kind of 
wastewater is very high in organic type contaminants loading and 
contains mainly BOD, oily substance, surface activating agents, 
etc. Because it is comparatively stable in volume and can serve 
as a nutrient source for microorganisms in the aeration tank, 
this kind of wastewater can be effectively treated together with 
low BOD loading wastewater. 
  It is, however, necessary to remove oily substance to a 
required level in case this kind of wastewater is used by itself 
or in case its mixing ratio with low BOD loading wastewater 
exceeds 30 percent when using the two kinds of wastewater 
together. This is because unless the level of oily substance 
removal is adequate, sludge generated in the biological 
treatment process will be of such nature that it tends to clog 
up the UF membrane. 
  (2) Sewage (Toilet Flush Water) 
  Because this kind of wastewater is very high in organic type 
contaminants loading and contains ammoniacal nitrogen, bilious 
coloring matter, etc., and further because oxidization of 
ammonia forms nitric acid resulting in lower pH, it is necessary 
to neutralize the regenerated water from this kind of wastewater 
for reuse and also to provide the aeration tank with acid-proof 
treatment. 
  It is also necessary to further treat this regenerated water 
by taking decoloring measures (by activated carbon, ozone 
treatment, etc.), as it takes on light yellow color because the 
substance formed from bilious coloring matter in it remains 
undissolved. 
  For those reasons there are few cases where this kind of 
wastewater is positively reclaimed for reuse even when the 
treatment system incorporates a UF membrane separation unit. 
However, the MSR system can be considered as an effective means 
in case this kind of wastewater needs to be regenerated for 
reuse, since decoloring effects on it can be expected by 
lowering the pH level of the aeration tank. 
<H5>  4. System Constitution </H5>
  Elements which constitute the system generally consist of 
the 
following, although they may vary somewhat with the kind of 
wastewater to be treated: 

  -  Screens (Screens with Coarse Openings, Screens with Fine 
Openings) 
  -  Pumps, Blowers, etc. 
  -  Ultrafiltration Unit 
  -  Aeration Tank 
  -  Other Tanks 

    In addition to the above, an oil removal device (pressurized 
flotation tank, etc.) and/or an activated carbon adsorption 
tower may be required in case measures are necessary to remove 
oily substance or color, depending on the kind of wastewater 
intended for reuse. 
<H5>  5. Features of the UF Membrane System </H5>
  (1) Availability of Regenerated Water of Stable and High 
Quality at All Times 
  Because organic matter is completely decomposed in the 
aeration tank and all of suspended solids are eliminated by the 
UF membrane separation unit, this system can produce treated 
water of extremely high quality. 
  This means that no special consideration is required of the 
materials of construction used for those piping and equipment 
handling this superior quality treated water and serves as a 
good proof that combination of the activated sludge process with 
the UF membrane separation technology makes a superior treatment 
system. 
  (2) Generation of Little Excess Sludge 
  Little excess sludge is generated, since activated sludge 
that can not pass through the UF membrane separation unit is 
concentrated and returned to the aeration tank. 
  This means that the propagation of microorganisms and their 
self-oxidization is well balanced by the increased concentration 
of activated sludge in the aeration tank. 
  (3) Compact, Reduced Size 
  Wastewater regeneration systems employing such processes as 
activated sludge process, contact oxidization process, rotating 
disc process, etc. require sedimentation tanks and may have to 
be equipped with two stages of biological treatment or followed 
by a sand filter, activated carbon adsorption tower, etc. in 
case high quality treated water is needed. 
  This system, however, requires no sedimentation tank nor 
does 
it almost require two stages of biological treatment of 
post-treatment equipment. 
  (4) Ease of Operation and Maintenance 
  Since this system requires no sedimentation tank, it is not 
necessary to control the volume of excess sludge to be returned. 
Consequently, the system is very easy to operate and maintain. 
  Furthermore, this system, not being subjected to effects 
from 
the settling characteristics of the sludge, is easy to manage in 
respect of operation, unlike other conventional types of systems 
equipped with sedimentation tanks which may have to heavily 
depend on filtration and other post-treatment equipment in case 
of handling a type of sludge difficult to settle. 
  (5) High Wastewater Recovery Rate 
  Ninety-nine percent or more of the original wastewater can 
be 
recovered as treated water, because little excess sludge is 
generated. 
  (6) No Odor Dispersion 
  Since all the process equipment is tightly enclosed, no odor 
dispersion occurs. 
<H5>  6. Uses for Regenerated Water </H5>
  Regenerated water is used as toilet flush water in almost 
all 
cases for the present time except that part of it is used as 
sprinkling water for gardens. Since the quality of regenerated 
water from the water reclamation system incorporating the 
activated sludge method combined with UF membrane separation is 
very high, it is expected that many other uses will be developed 
for this high quality treated water in the future. Uses will be 
found, for instance, as make-up water for cooling towers, 
landscaping water, car washing water, fire-extinguishing water, 
etc.
