<LEADPARA>  The Sept. 14 Mercury News contained three letters written by articulate people
championing the cause to outlaw abortion. As an ambivalent observer of this
conflict between groups who are, in the view of their respective opponents,
either pro-murder or pro-slavery, I believe several questions remain to be
answered by each.;   Is a human egg, at the instant of fertilization, endowed
by God with all of the rights to life and afterlife held by the woman and man
who conceived? Those mortals who dare to speak for him, tell us God's will is
that a newly fertilized human egg is a person complete with a soul and made in
His image.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     As a Christian, I believe the Bible is the only word of God, albeit
filtered through several layers of translators, editors and publishers. I
cannot find any Holy Scriptures which unambiguously and directly address the
issue currently before us. I am not convinced the biblical interpretations
offered by pro-slavery forces are any truer than my own.;   Is it the right of
a woman to rid herself of the life growing within her womb? Is there really an
issue of legally compelling a pregnant human being to undergo a lengthy,
uncompensated and possibly lethal ordeal? A few years ago, a friend
unexpectedly died in childbirth. Her passing reminded me the risk of death was
behind the early laws making rape a capital crime.;   As a pragmatist, I
believe the pro-murder forces would lose the strongest of their arguments if
pro-slavery groups pressed for legislation that would pay a woman for giving
birth to an unwanted baby at half the rate hospitals charge for nine months of
full life support care.;   The other half of the money would go to the child.
The costs of such a system could be borne by donations made by millions of
caring and committed people willing to annually tithe a portion of their
income to end the tragedy of abortion.;   I do not know which side of the
fence I am likely to come down on but I sense a time coming when those two
opponents will force us to make up our minds at the polls. And I resent it.;  
-- Steve Munzel; Milpitas; LET FIRMS WORK OUT; POLICIES ON LEAVES; Regarding
your Sept. 12 editorial, I agree with the benefits of parental and child care
leave. I do, however, disagree that it should be provided for through the
Family and Medical Leave Act that affects only 5 percent of the nation's
employers.;   Employee benefits should be negotiated between employers and
their employees just like wages and fringe benefits. They should not be
mandated by the government.;   Scheduling and cost are the two main concerns
of employers opposed to this legislation. A 50-employee business could easily
have five to six employees each working in eight to 10 different
non-overlapping jobs.;   This business must already schedule for leaves for
vacation, illness, disability and personal reasons. To add a six-month leave
on top of other work absences could easily become unmanageable. Because of
learned product knowledge or technical skills, there are few job
classifications that can be covered by temporary personnel for a six-month
period.;   In regard to cost, a typical local HMO monthly premium for employee
and family health insurance is $350. During a six-month parental or child care
leave an employer would have to continue to fund $2,100 in medical insurance
costs for each employee absent. If a business is fortunate to locate a
temporary replacement, health care protection must be provided for that person
as well. The consumer will ultimately pay for the benefit through higher
prices.;   Like all employment benefits, it is important to determine whether
or not an employee really has a need for parental and child care leave. If
they do, there may have to be trade-offs with other benefits to make it
affordable and workable. This can only be determined between an employee and
his employer.;   Finally, if mandated parental and child care leave is the
family bonding, parental caring, employment turnover reduction benefit that
Congress and your editorial staff believe it to be, why did Congress exempt
its own employees from the benefits of this legislation?;   Isn't this act
really a poorly disguised vote-generating device? President Bush is correct to
veto this act and allow each employer to provide benefit packages that fit the
employees' needs.;   -- Bruce J. Pohle; San Jose; WE SAVE WATER; BUT WASTE
OIL; Why are we willing to go to such extremes as not flushing the toilet in
order to save a few gallons of water? Why don't we do the same to save a few
gallons of oil? Not only will it save our surrounding environment but also
places like the arctic refuge.;   Do you feel guilty when you let the water
run while you're brushing your teeth? Why don't you feel as guilty when you
let your car idle while waiting in line at the gas station?;   We all pulled
together to save water. Now let's save oil. Turn down the heater a couple of
degrees, install some fluorescent light bulbs, take your foot off the gas and
coast to the next red light. These things aren't any harder to do than
installing low-flow shower heads.;   If we all work together, we can also use
less oil than we did in 1987.;   -- Nancy Jackson Schuler; Palo Alto  </TEXT>
