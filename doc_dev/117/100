bi-centenary

NEXT WEEK marks the bi-centenary of the birth of Percy Bysshe Shelley, one
of England's greatest Romantic poets, a figure reviled in his lifetime for
his scandalous life and unfashionable opinions, and quickly apotheosised
after his death at the tender age of 29 as the very type of the Poet -
Matthew Arnold once described him as a 'beautiful and ineffectual angel,
beating in the void his luminous wings in vain.'
Although one of his grandfathers was born in Newark, New Jersey, Shelley
himself came from West Sussex, but there was no love lost between him and
his forebears, whom he once described as 'a parcel of cold selfish and
calculating animals who seem to have no other aim or business on Earth but
to eat drink and sleep.' Fortunately, he spent little time there.
He was beaten and bullied at Eton, where fellow pupils denounced him as 'mad
Shelley', and later expelled from University College, Oxford, for failing to
answer questions in front of a public tribunal (consisting of heads of
college, professors and a quorum of bishops) about a pamphlet that he had
written and circulated, entitled 'The Necessity of Atheism.' And in 1816 he
was banished from the family estate for eloping to Edinburgh with the
16-year-old Harriet Westbrook - the first of many flights from authority.
Much of his later life was spent in Italy - Lucca, where he translated
Plato's Symposium, Venice, Naples, Pisa and, ultimately, Lerici, where he
lived in a lonely beach house on the bay with the rest of his household,
which by this time consisted of Mary, their son Percy Florence, and Claire
Clairmont, Mary's young step-sister. It was here that his last major poem
was written, 'The Triumph of Life', which was left unfinished at the time of
his death. The last, sad act in the drama has been well documented: Shelley,
a non-swimmer, drowned in August 1822 after an unexpected squall hit the
schooner Ariel during a return trip from a visit to Byron at Livorno. The
god was dead.
The myths surrounding the person and the poetry of Shelley were freely
circulating within a quarter of a century of his death. Why was Shelley so
ripe for myth-making? Five reasons, principally: he had been astonishingly
prolific at a very young age; he had died at sea, a kind of death that had
already been immortalised by Milton in 'Lycidas'; he had a lived a life of
public scandal and concern, thanks to his extreme political views and his
atheistical tendencies; his personal life had been repeatedly tainted by
charges of immorality. And, equally scandalously, he had been friends with
Lord Byron and other dangerous aristocratic reprobates, thus heaping scandal
upon infamy in the mind of a public as thirsty for the stuff then as now.
But, above all things else, he had been cut off in his prime - old age had
not had the opportunity to wither or mature him.
And then, in the 20th century, Shelley the Skylark's reputation nose-dived,
thanks to a great deal of scatter-spray loosed off from that rusting
blunderbuss, FR Leavis, and his beaters. Leavis mocked and reviled Shelley
for his linguistic vagaries and ridiculous rhetorical flights of fancy.
Unfortunately, and as was so often the case with Leavis, the quotations that
were deployed to set Shelley spinning down from the upper air were highly
selective - and his life and other achievements as thinker, letter-writer
and savage polemicist were ignored.
It is these aspects of his multifarious talent that other, later critics
have hailed as remarkable - his passionate indictment of the failures of
technology; his defence of vegetarianism; and the political radicalism that
made him the toast of a thousand radical and chartist groups in the middle
of the 19th century while the defenders of his poetry, makers of that very
myth-machine, were soaring high in the clouds with his juvenilia.
How do we explain such a multi-faceted genius as Shelley's? He seemed to
contain within himself the extreme passion and the extreme idealism of a
young man who had not lived long enough to be browbeaten into the
conformities of middle age - wedded, of course, to a brilliant intellect
that genuinely believed in the power of the hammer-blows of reason to beat
down the walls of Tyranny. The date of the bi-centenary is August 4.
