   The red building tucked away in the scenic
mountains of northwest Virginia looks more like a schoolhouse than
the nation's first prefabricated jail made from converted shipping
containers.
   New picnic tables in the back overlook a lush green field.
There's plenty of room outside the building for exercise or
picnics. But the building is being noticed for more than its looks.
   ``I think what these people are doing for prison construction is
equivalent to what Henry Ford did for automobile construction,''
said Richard Abell, assistant U.S. attorney general for justice
programs. ``Henry Ford did not invent the automobile, but he made
it accessible. What these people are doing is making prisons
accessible.''
   Abell said the Loudoun County facility is the first of its kind
in the country. He said what makes this jail different is ``no one
has ever taken these shipping containers already made, and made
them into jails.''
   Surfside 6 Industries of McLean built the six-cell, 23-cot jail
in 13 working days for $96,398. That translates into a cost of
about $4,000 a bed.
   ``Ordinarily, it costs $40,000 to $100,000 per bed space, and it
generally takes two years to build a jail or a prison,'' Abell
said. ``These guys put it together in two weeks. That's beyond
revolutionary.''
   Abell said another advantage is the flexibility of the prefab
jails.
   ``Like Tinkertoys, they can be rearranged if they need to be
changed in five or 10 years,'' Abell said. ``If the needs have
decreased, they're not stuck with it on the landscape. You don't
have a problem like San Francisco has with Alcatraz _ a big massive
sore on the landscape.''
   Jim Wordsworth, secretary and treasurer of Surfside 6, said the
prefab building could be used as a shelter for the homeless or to
store records.
   Each steel shipping container is 8 feet tall, 8 feet wide and 20
feet long, Wordsworth said. To convert it into a jail cell, the
container is insulated and a wall covering such as cement or
drywall is put on. The finished building uses traditional plumbing,
wiring and heating.
   Wordsworth said the used containers are transported to Surfside
6 Industries' factory in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and put together
there, then shipped to the location. He said they can be built on
site too.
   Abell, a member of the National Institute of Corrections
Advisory Board, said prison crowding has become a national problem.
   ``Between 1963 and 1981, our crime rate soared 337 percent in
the United States and prison construction in the same period went
up 27 percent,'' Abell said.
   Loudoun County Sheriff John Isom said there is a shortage of
about 3,000 beds in the Washington, D.C., area, and of about 1,900
beds in northern Virginia.
   He said the maximum-security prison in Leesburg has 63 beds and
averages 100 people a day. He said he plans to move at least 23
people who are in work-release programs to the prefab jail when it
opens this month.
   But Isom said, ``Overcrowding will continue unless someone
figures out a way to eradicate the drug problem.''
   Crowding causes many problems, he said, including violence.
   ``We have inmate fights a couple of times a week,'' Isom said.
   While counties elsewhere have agonized over finding sites and
money to build large, future-oriented buildings equipped with
computer-controlled security and even robot food carts, Isom said
he was looking for a quick and inexpensive solution.
   He and Wordsworth said the jail's security will be adequate.
Wordsworth said a special welding torch would be required to cut
through the walls, made of Insulcrete, a patented concrete with
high insulation quality.
   He said officials from all over the country are calling about
the jail.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' he said. ``They're bringing the county
administrator, the director of finance, the sheriff to look at this.
   ``It's unique, it's portable, you can set it down and then move
the whole structure,'' he said. ``There is so much citizen unrest
on the location of prisons and jails ... They can assure the
citizens they're temporarily solving a problem until they go
through all of the rituals of building.''
   Greg Bogdan, spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, said
the bureau isn't opposed to the prefab idea, but says it isn't the
long-term solution to the crowding problem.
   ``They're suitable for emergency situations, but they're not an
answer to the long-term prison problem as far as the bureau is
concerned,'' Bogdan said. ``There is still a need for permanent
facilities.''
