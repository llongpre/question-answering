   EDITOR'S NOTE _ For decades she labored in obscurity, writing
the poems that no one would publish. Now at an age when most people
are considering retiring, Amy Clampitt has begun to attract
attention in the literary world.

   In the early 1980s a New York bookstore
sympathetic to struggling writers returned four of the five copies
of Amy Clampitt's self-published poems she had asked the store to
try to sell. The only one that was sold was bought by a friend of
hers.
   But by the beginning of this year she had four collections
published by a large publishing house, and her work was being
likened in significance to Lowell, Stevens and Plath. One specialty
publisher is now even producing a handmade volume of some of her
work that will cost $700 per book.
   At age 70, Amy Clampitt is enjoying success rarely visited upon
American poets.
   She first attracted attention with the 1983 publication of ``The
Kingfisher,'' which unleashed, to use a phrase from one of her
poems, ``a shower of bloom.'' The praise has largely continued
through three more volumes, most recently, ``Westward.''
   ``All I can tell you is that it wasn't any cinch,'' Clampitt
says.
   For decades she wrote in the deep obscurity of a New York
artist's life, even as the popular appeal of poetry seemed on a
death spiral, especially the sometimes demanding verse _ critics
call it allusive _ that she writes.
   Clampitt must have hardly seemed up to such hardscrabble work
when she left the farm in New Providence, Iowa, a town of 200
people in the heart of the heartland. She was a nervous, elfin kid
who had a Phi Beta Kappa key from Grinnell College, but had not
been enough of a hand around the farm even to have milked a single
cow.
   ``I wasn't very muscular or inclined to do strenuous things,''
she concedes.
   But she learned how to fetch a phrase. She learned mostly from
her grandfather, a lover of reading and nature who once awakened
one of his children and carried her into the night to point out the
sound of a whippoorwill.
   Clampitt's poetry is alive with such pastoral sights and sounds:
the ``cheekily anarchic dartings and flashings'' of birds, the
``vaporous fripperies'' of clouds, of ``bog laurel and lambkill''
the ``blurred flute note'' of a warbler. They all come out in
``torques, in curdlings, cadenzas by the earful.''
   Even when the reader is wading through ``seaweed-clodded
polyphloisboio thalasses'' or trying to see ``chiasmus through the
looking-glass,'' her wordplay is resonant, musical.
   Over the years, as her splendid words went unnoticed, she
sustained herself with a few attempts at traditional work,
including a brief stint as an assistant librarian at the Audubon
Society in New York. But she worked mainly as a free-lance editor.
   By the 1970s, she was reconciling herself to never being widely
read. But she kept writing.
   Then, in 1978, The New Yorker _ one of the magazines which had
``been rejecting me for years'' _ took a long look and decided to
publish some of her work. She had found a kindred spirit in poetry
editor Howard Moss.
   ``He knew what a sundew is,'' she says, recalling with a fresh
giggle one of their early conversations about her writing.
   After The New Yorker, many of the other important magazines
followed. When ``The Kingfisher'' came out, the little world of
American poetry was stunned by the thrill of, the achievement of,
the thing.
   Clampitt, meanwhile, suffered the letdown that comes after
publication of a first major work. She also suffered from all the
attention.
   ``This kind of fame is limited to a little circle, but it is
very different,'' says Clampitt, who was in Cambridge for a reading
of her poems. ``I thought I was going to be a person who spent her
life in obscurity, and then this came. It jolted me. I wasn't ready
to have people know about me.''
   Then, when the windfall of attention had subsided somewhat, the
gainsayers who had been crouching in discontent emerged. And it
hurt.
   The comeuppance came mainly by way of three poetry magazine
contributors _ she calls them ``aspiring critics'' _ who took issue
with her dense language and literary allusions.
   ``They were all women,'' she says. ``I guess some of them just
don't allow for throwbacks like me.''
   Some of the criticism was well-reasoned, for at times Clampitt
can be excessive in her reference to other texts or in her
language, i.e., her preference for classical traditions over the
sparse style so much in vogue.
   But, oh, some of the things they said:
   ``Clampitt is not a poet of emotional depth.''
   ``...it would be better for Amy Clampitt if, at least for a
while, she tucked her notes from Poetry 101 away in a trunk.''
   ``...all her prosodies tend to cacophony (sic).''
   Clampitt can be vague, but her work is more likely to sparkle
with the bright particulars she has enjoyed in her long romance
with the language. She can be quick in her borrowings from other
writers, but she is also a jewel thief who can pick the pockets of
Hopkins or Wordsworth when they have just what she needs. She is
stylistically somewhat outdated, but refreshingly so.
   Her poems already are finding their way into anthologies, and
many critics are talking as if her work will ``last.''
   Helen Vendler, Harvard professor and poetry critic of ``The New
Yorker,'' says in her recent book on poetry, ``The Music of What
Happens,'' that Clampitt's poetry will endure because of her rare
voice and because it ``will take on as well the documentary value
of what, in the 20th century, made up the stuff of culture.''
   Because she was discovered so late in life, most of her close
friends are much younger poets also just emerging. She is a little
cowed in the company of the established writers of her generation.
   Clampitt has been a visiting writer and lecturer at several
colleges, and is now working on more poems, occasional reviews, and
on a play about Dorothy Wordsworth.
   Her latest volume, ``Westward,'' has not received as much
attention as her earlier works, but it offers sensual delights and
is accessible to even the most casual reader.
   Turn to ``The Prairie,'' a long poem in ``Westward'' for the
spirit that imbued her. From this story of her family and the
uncertainty and hard history of working the plains, she exacts a
rugged, solemn beauty.
   ``Hard work.'' ``Hard work,'' it calls out.
   She answered the call, and still she wonders if her grandfather
would approve of her journey eastward.
   ``I feel a halfway need to justify, to whisper. `Please don't
disapprove, don't think me frivolous.'''
   He couldn't.
