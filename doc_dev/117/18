   The telephone company launched a new service for
culture-lovers Monday _ Dial-a-Poem.
   For 70 cents a minute, British Telecom's customers can hear
five-minute recordings of leading poets reciting their verse.
   Callers dialing 0898-222255 could hear John Heath-Stubbs, 70,
saying: ``I'm very happy to be the first poet to be recorded in
this dial-a-poem series,'' before reciting from four of his poems,
ranging in subject matter from Noah's Ark through cats in poetry to
clocks and space.
   Heath-Stubbs is among six contemporary poets chosen for
Dial-a-Poem.
   It's too soon to tell whether the innovation will confound the
19th-century historian Thomas Macaulay's conviction that ``as
civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily declines.'' But
something clearly is astir.
   The London subway has beun displaying verses of Shelley, Burns
and de la Mare on some of its trains, and a year ago the railroad
company organized poetry readings at some of its stations.
   Sarah Chesney of the English Language Society, the literary
group that selected the poets for Dial-a-Poem, explained in a
telephone interview: ``We felt we should make poetry more
accessible.''
   Added Lisa Bourne, a British Telecom spokeswoman: ``Poetry was
slowly fading away, and we thought it would be a great idea to
bring it back.''
   State-owned until it was floated on the stock market in 1984,
British Telecom is ever on the lookout for a profit-making
sideline, and it said that if Dial-a-Poem attracted 1,000 calls a
week, it would make the service permanent.
   Others poets reading their verse for telephone callers during
the six-week trial run are Kathleen McPhilemy, Jeremy Reed, Bernard
Kops, James Berry and Gillian Allnutt.
   ``We wanted something refreshingly adventurous _ poetry that is
not so obscure that it doesn't come across well on the phone, but
that is also not strictly traditional,'' said Ms. Chesney.
   She said each poet would receive 10 percent of the profits from
the service.
   One problem is British Telecom's phone lines, which aren't
famous for their clarity. Heath-Stubbs came through somewhat
faintly and would only be comprehensible in a quiet room.
   ``I don't think the telephone does the poets justice in a way
that hearing them firsthand would,'' Ms. Chesney said. ``But many
people won't have the chance to hear them firsthand, and for them
it's refreshing to hear them (the poets) in their own voices.''
   To listen to Heath-Stubbs' entire five minutes costs $3.45
between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. But a cheaper rate during slack hours
brings the cost down to $2.25. A sampling from Heath-Stubbs's ``The
Cosmic Clock'':
   Planets, stars, galaxies _ the whole
   Winking and blinking caboodle _
   This, it seems, is the only reliable clock:
   A beam from a star crossed a sensitive plate _
   Then came the pips: the British nation
   Turned on the 10 o'clock news.
   
   This is the moving image of eternity _
   I don't mean Paley's watch discarded
   By the absconding Watchmaker
   Upon a bank of Wordsworthian daffodils,
   But pulsars, quasars, decaying elements, black holes;
   Yet this, they say, is likewise winding down _
   And hickory _ dickory, men and mice we run in it!
