<TEXT>     "It may sound expensive, but it will be cheaper than trying to acquire
nearly 5,000 volumes," said Stephen Pocock, the senior project editor at
publishers Chadwyck-Healey Ltd. of Cambridge. The discs will become available
between March 1992 and March 1994.;    "Some of these poets have not been
reprinted since their work was originally published in the 17th and 18th
centuries. The poetry will be indexed by author, title, part-title and key
words so that anyone searching it will be able to see if some poets borrowed
anything from their predecessors," Pocock said in an interview Friday.;    He
said the work stopped at 1900 because of copyright difficulties with 20th
century poetry.;    Publication is scheduled for three installments, one disc
each for the periods 600 to 1660 and 1661 to 1800 and the last two for the
19th century, which contains as much verse as the other two periods together,
Pocock said.;    "All the published work of these poets will be included, the
famous and the completely obscure, whether it was poetry of genius or just
plain awful. Even famous poets like (William) Wordsworth wrote some dire stuff
at times," he said.;    Even one of Wordsworth's worst lines will be included:
"This piteous news so much it shocked her, She quite forgot to send the
doctor.";    Besides the great masters like William Shakespeare, John Milton
and Lord Byron, the project will include little-known versifiers.;    One is
William Tennant, whose epic 1822 poem "The Thane of Fife" has some memorable
imagery like, "Now, in the very navel of the sky" and "Morning's
golden-tassell'd shoes, Had leapt from sea and now in heaven walk dry.";   
"It's taken 15 people all summer just to count the words involved and there
are more than 1 billion characters," said John Russell, the publisher's sales
director.;    Pocock said the poets are those listed in "The New Cambridge
Bibliography of English Literature," issued by Cambridge University Press from
1969 to 1972, and which includes English translations of Welsh, Scottish and
Irish poets who wrote in other languages.;    "We expect university libraries
around the world, English faculties and some public libraries to buy it. Much
of the material is hard to come by and isn't available in some British
libraries," Pocock said.  </TEXT>
