Will China's protesters produce a Madison -- a constitutionalist, a codifier of 
liberty -- before there emerges a Napoleon whose riposte to philosophy is 
artillery? Probably not. But a 20th-Century Chinese thinker said when asked the 
significance of the French Revolution, "Too soon to tell."

Looking back on 1989 from, say 2005, as Wordsworth looked back on 1789 from 
1805, many Chinese, young no more, will surely think, "Bliss was it in that 
dawn to be alive, but to be young was very heaven!" However, many may then feel 
as Wordsworth did about the long gone "hour of universal ferment" when "the 
soil of common life (was) too hot to tread upon." They may say as he did, "Now 
do I feel how I have been deceived."
