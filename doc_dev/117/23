LIKE LOUIS MacNeice, Derek Mahon is an Irish poet (born in Belfast, 1941)
who eludes characterisation by his Irishness. His subjects are general, his
sensibility is that shared by all poets whose primary interest is in making
a variety of verbal objects and thereby, as he writes in the MacNeice
memorial poem which heads this new selection, 'keeping the colours new'.
Mahon's Irish interests are not repressed - in fact they are abounding; but
unlike his near-contemporary Seamus Heaney or Paul Muldoon (another devotee
of MacNeice) he does not seek to create an Irish myth of any sort.
Interested in everything, and infallibly interesting, he is simply and
thoroughly a poet in a way that not only recalls MacNeice, but the
distinctions of Auden, Lowell and Elizabeth Bishop too.
Like all those poets he is blessed with technical accomplishment. His
management of metrics, stanza and rhyme, his sure sense of the fine,
ringing, quirky, inevitable line, his eager appetite for, and seemingly
instant command of, new forms set him apart from most of his English and
American contemporaries, and they, on the whole, are a brilliant lot.
Reading through this book - his second selected volume, but with the feel of
a 'Collected' - one cannot fail to admire Mahon's knack of being himself in
whatever formal guise he adopts, be it epigram, short lyric, verse letter,
villanelle, dramatic monologue, free translation (Ovid, Corbiere, Rimbaud,
Pasternak, Jaccottet) or big stanza-statement poem. Every piece here is
fully achieved; the ambition behind the book must be enormous but is never
obtrusive.
Beyond the attributes of technique there is in Mahon's best poems an
endlessly ponderable richness of language, a sense of which may be gained
from the opening stanza of his most celebrated piece, 'A Disused Shed in Co.
Wexford': 'Even now there are places where a thought might grow - /Peruvian
mines, worked out and abandoned /To a slow clock of condensation, /An echo
trapped for ever, and a flutter /Of wild-flowers in the lift-shaft, /Indian
compounds where the wind dances /And a door bangs with diminished
confidence, /Lime crevices behind rippling rain-barrels, /Dog corners for
bone burials; /And in a disused shed in Co. Wexford'.
This poem expands on what might be thought of as Mahon's principal theme:
the pathos of discarded things, the poetry of the contingency of everyday
objects. 'Left to itself,' he writes in 'Disused Shed's' sister-poem, 'A
Garage in Co. Cork', 'the functional will cast /A death-bed glow of
picturesque abandon'. The poet's visionary task is no longer to descry
Wordsworth's noble 'light that never was, on sea or land', so much as to
notice the 'late sacramental gleam' with which the most mediocre bits and
pieces of life will start to shine.
'We might be anywhere but are in one place only', he insists in this
Elizabeth Bishop-like reverie on an obscure, mundane filling-station, into
which he nevertheless manages to work, and charmingly, the Ovidian myth of
Philemon and Baucis. 'A god who spent the night here once rewarded /Natural
courtesy with eternal life - /Changing to petrol pumps, that they be spared/
For ever there, an old man and his wife'.
It is one of the triumphs of Mahon's art that for all his resolute attention
to the ordinary, he can be 'myth-kitty' in a powerfully plausible way to
which Philip Larkin who coined the phrase could not reasonably have
objected, as when in the book's grand finale, 'Death and the Sun', he
imagines 'Plato's neolithic troglodyte /Released from his dark cinema'
standing at last, 'Absurd and anxious, out in the open air', while (in a
wonderful concluding flow of mixed metaphor) the 'Sun gongs its lenity from
a brazen heaven /Listening in silence to his rich despair'.
If Mahon in this hugely enjoyable gathering of poems shows himself to be
free from any Irish stereotyping, the quintessentially English poet Andrew
Motion in his bleakly impressive new collection, Love in a Life, gives the
impression of wanting to emulate the linguistic violence and tonal daring of
his Irish contemporaries Paul Muldoon and Tom Paulin. A bitter colloquialism
constantly threatens the poised lyrical structures of the book's three short
sections and actually causes 'The Vision of that Ancient Man' to abort: it
ends 'like . . . Sod it; who cares?'
But in breaking with traditional values, Motion gives striking expression to
a burdened breadwinner's view of the modern world as endlessly aggravating,
rawly inhospitable. The sad old whippet in 'It is an Offence' who regularly
leaves his 'sloped, weary turds' by the poet's front door 'doesn't know he's
doing, and yet /I'd still like to cover his arsehole with quick-set cement'.
That is very much the mood of the book.
