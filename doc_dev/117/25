CYMRU OR WALES?
by R S Thomas
Gomer Pounds 3.75, 32 pages
HENRY VAUGHAN, David Jones, Vernon Watkins, Dylan Thomas, R S Thomas - there
is a continuing tradition of Welsh poets who write in English, and English
poetry would be much impoverished without them. Sometimes their work has its
origin in native Welsh experience, like Watkins's Ballad of the Mari Lwyd;
at others it stems from the poet's sense of being a part of a European
tradition with roots in classical Greece and Rome, as may be seen in the
many fine translations that Watkins made into English verse from Homer,
Dante, Ronsard, Baudelaire, Goethe, Rilke.
There is a similar double-vision in the work of R S Thomas, who celebrated
his 80th birthday on March 29 with a massive volume containing his poetic
output over the best part of half a century. In many of the poems Thomas
appears as the poet of rural Wales, portraying individually named
farm-workers, their wives and children, the inhabitants of his parish, seen
against a sharply etched background. One figure constantly recurs - Iago
Prytherch, the labourer, a Welsh Piers Plowman, whose harsh life Thomas
never tires of describing.
Yet there are also many poems in the R S Thomas canon that transport the
reader far from Welsh concerns. Kierkegaard and Wallace Stevens are two
non-Welshmen who ignite Thomas's muse; so do many French painters. One of
his recent books, Ingrowing Thoughts (1985) was entirely devoted to poems
based on modern art, starting with Picasso and Matisse, concluding with
Magritte, Max Ernst and Roland Penrose. Whether he is writing about a Welsh
milkmaid or Matisse's 'Portrait of a Girl in a Yellow Dress', Thomas's
approach remains the same. He stands back from the object of his
contemplation, recreating its appearance in carefully structured words, and
letting it serve, by the close, as a general reflection on the human
condition. The language is austere, the rhymes sparse, the mood often
bitter.
For much of his life Thomas wrote his poetry while serving as a minister of
the Church, in 1936 at Chirk on the Welsh border, and then among the hill
farmers of Montgomeryshire; but the reader who expects a God-centred
lyricism, hymning the Welsh countryside, will be disappointed. It was that
other Thomas - Dylan - who composed odes in praise of innocence and sunshine
at harvest-time, who sang of 'the round Zion of the waterbead and the
synagogue of the ear of corn', not this one. By contrast Rev Thomas watches
his parishioner Evans, 'On his way to the fields, where he hoes/ up one roe
of mangolds and down/ The next one' and just in case we should be so foolish
as to think that the poet is glorifying Evans as some kind of latter-day
Wordsworthian solitary, he adds: 'You needn't wonder/ What goes on in his
mind, there is nothing/ Going on there . . . '
To find Thomas's sense of a connection between his two careers, the Church
and literature, one needs to consult the introduction he made in 1967 to his
selection from the poetry of George Herbert. He speaks there of: 'The
possibility of a fruitful relationship between Christianity and poetry. The
bridge between the two latter is the Incarnation. If poetry is concerned
with the concrete and the particular, then Christianity aims at their
redemption and consecration. The poet invents the metaphor, and the
Christian lives it'.
These complementary approaches to human suffering act together in his own
work and underlie a dialogue that runs right through it. Thomas finds it
difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile himself to the miserable and
often futile lives of the ordinary men and women in his pastoral care. 'The
great problems,' he writes in one characteristically short laconic poem,
'Remain, stubborn, unsolved'.
One of the saddest tasks a priest has to perform is to be present at the
deathbed of one of his flock whom he has known and loved. Father Gerard
Manley Hopkins watched the farrier Felix Randall 'pining, pining' until,
wasted with disease, he died. But then, miraculously, that poem did end on a
redemptive note, as Hopkins remembered Felix as he was formerly, full of
health and strength, and making for 'the great grey drayhorse his bright and
battering sandal]'
In Thomas's poem 'The Mill' he describes how he would pay regular visits to
a miller confined to his bed for nine years before he died. The poem ends
with no spark of redemption: 'The great frame rotted/ While the past's slow
stream,/ Flowing through his head,/ Kept the rusty mill/ Of the mind turning
 / It was I it ground'.
Thomas deals with the condition of Wales in several of his poems in the same
spirit of ruthless candour. He is a passionately committed nationalist
appalled by much that he sees going on around him. He was 30 before he
learnt to speak Welsh but he wishes that he and the other Welsh poets I
mention had written in their own indigenous language.
He deeply resents, as he says in his outspoken pamphlet Cymru or Wales?,
'the effects of an English life-style, English thought processes and the
English vocabulary . . . ' However, as I hope I have indicated, this
resentment has not prevented Thomas in his poetry from attaining to a great
mastery over the English language.
