Oliver Hindle is the newest choreographer to be nurtured by Peter Wright
with the Birmingham Royal Ballet. His Sacred Symphony for the company last
May was a professional debut; now, with funding received by Peter Wright
(the 1991 Digital Premier Award), his second creation has been made
possible. Dark Horizons is set to Shostakovich's chamber symphony (the
eighth string quartet in Barshai's arrangement). Its theme is the fate of
North American Indians driven from their lands 'on to infertile
reservations', and it is cast with nine male dancers placed against a rocky
landscape designed by Peter Farley.
It is all - in the current cant phrase - 'politically correct' (even the
Shostakovich score bore a dedication to 'victims of fascism and war'), and
staggeringly worthy in ideals. In a threnody for a people dispossessed,
Hindle shows us the men (outfitted in what look like Iriquois bathing
trunks, body paint and modish hair-styles) who are by turns watchful or
sorrowing. There is nothing, though, suggestive of the extreme richness of
tribal dance - central to the identity of the Indian races, and, in the
Sioux ghost dance cult at the turn of this century, a war-like response to
persecution by the white man. Instead, Hindle gives us pieties with an
admixture of conventional academic movement and poses that look more
cinematic than ethnic.
The merits of the piece lie in Hindle's ability to make fluent lines of
movement, and to set a personal stamp upon the dynamics of a phrase. That he
is gifted there is no doubt, and he has inspired heart-whole performances
from his cast, admirably led by Joseph Cipolla. Yet, as with Sacred
Symphony, I find that Hindle has opted for a theme too static to allow the
emotional or physical development which will let his creativity soar and
dare braver things.
This new BRB triple bill opened with a sympathetic account of Les Sylphides.
Not grand, but sincere; musical (Philip Ellis, here as with the
Shostakovich, guiding sure accounts of the score) and graceful in manner,
and in Ravenna Tucker finding a sensitive ballerina for the mazurka and the
nocturne duet: gentle, lovely dancing. The programme ended with Hans van
Manen's Five Tangos, a work without which I can very well do.
Sir Kenneth MacMillan's new and stunning Judas Tree is framed in the Opera
House programme by two major Balanchine pieces: Stravinsky Violin Concerto
and Symphony in C. The evening is one which, with the addition of Brian
Elias' powerful score for MacMillan, reasserts the musical standards of our
national ballet and the responsiveness of our dancers to good scores and
fine accompaniment.
The influence of Constant Lambert upon the identity of the Royal Ballet can
never be over-estimated: as composer, conductor, arbiter of taste for two
decades from the inception of the company, his imprint still lies in the
civilised musical attitudes of our dancers and choreographers, even in
certain felicities of style. Balanchine, most musical and most musically
educated of choreographers, never put a dancer's foot wrong in relationship
with a note or phrase. And though the Royal Ballet manner does not aim for
the bright-edged clarity of New York City Ballet in works such as Violin
concerto or Symphony in C, there is energy and rigour to the dancing in this
current series of performances, and the sense of a company on fine and
secure form.
Part of this is owed to the vitality of the orchestral playing under Barry
Wordsworth. Stravinsky Violin Concerto on two recent evenings sounded
spirited and intense (and intensely poetic in the arias), with the young
Israeli violinist Hagai Shaham a dazzling soloist, and the dancers'
performance reflected these qualities exactly. Darcey Bussell exposed all
the linear tension of the first aria; Sylvie Guillem, looking at moments
like Sargent's portrait of Mme Gautreau, seemed to lose herself in the dance
to potent effect. In the sunburst of Symphony in C , the refinement of the
orchestral playing - textures airy, clear  - encouraged dancing that was
buoyant, generous, and radiant in spirit as in step.
About The Judas Tree I can but say that a second viewing revealed fresh
layers of meaning and fresh richness of choreographic invention (how vivid
is Mark Silver, seemingly the one sympathetic character, standing hand over
mouth, denying the truth, Peter-fashion, at the action's crisis). The detail
and power in the company performances is everywhere magnificent. It is an
astonishing, adventurous work of art. Brian Elias' score is superbly
theatrical, and it finds ideal advocates in the Opera House orchestra under
Wordsworth.
