MARK Twain and Ray Bradbury rub shoulders with Charlotte Bronte and Susan
Hill, and Dickens and Shakespeare jostle with Alexander Solzhenitsyn and
Henrik Ibsen in the National Curriculum Council's suggested English
literature reading list for 16-year-olds in England and Wales. Even Philip
Larkin gets a mention.
One immediate effect of the list will be to boost sales for writers not yet
widely read in schools, according to Penguin, the publishers owned by the
Pearson Group, which also owns the Financial Times.
Mr Patrick Hutchinson, Penguin's marketing and sales director, described the
list as mainly 'safe and traditional'. But he added that inclusion on the
list would help sales of some of the lesser-known modern authors.
He said: 'When the list for primary schools came out three years ago, many
schools didn't have the resources to buy all the books. Parents then rushed
out to the shops and bought copies for the children, so this is going to
propel authors on to shelves where they may not have been before.'
Appearances on reading lists reliably increase book sales.
The proposals prescribe that children between 11 and 14 (Key Stage Three)
should read at least one Shakespeare play, then read another between 14 and
16 (Key Stage Four). These must come from separate categories - the
histories, tragedies and comedies.
Beyond this, 11-to-14-year-olds should read drama 'appropriate for their
age' - one suggestion is Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood - while
14-to-16-year-olds have to read at least one play by an author from a list
that includes Arthur Miller, J B Priestley, Oscar Wilde, Robert Bolt, Tom
Stoppard, Alan Bennett and Henrik Ibsen.
Requirements for poetry include more imaginative choices. At both key
stages, children must read works by at least five poets, of whom at least
two should have been published before 1900.
The list at Key Stage Four includes a number of writers less well-exposed.
In addition to Blake, Coleridge, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley, Donne
and Chaucer, modern poets such as Brian Patten, Derek Walcott, Sylvia Plath,
Dannie Abse and Norman MacCaig are included.
Modern writers who might hope for a boost from sales include Jan Mark,
Rukshana Smith, Michelle Magorian, Beverly Naidoo, Anne Holm, Berlie
Doherty, Joan Lingard, Katherine Paterson, Rosa Guy, Marjorie Darke and Gwyn
Thomas.
Teachers reacted with alarm to the amount of Shakespeare prescribed,
regardless of childrens' ability. Ms Judith Rowley, an English teacher from
the Morton School in Carlisle, said: 'I'm certainly not against Shakespeare,
and I would expect to read one of his plays with a top set by the age of 12
or 13, but as far as the lower groups are concerned I would be doubtful
about it.'
She also voiced concern about the inclusion of Ibsen and Solzhenitsyn.
