   Assuming Johnny can read, the question remains:
What should he read?
   The Times of London and The Daily Telegraph have tried to answer
the question with lists of classics recommended for children from 3
to 18. Apart from a few books, notably J.D. Salinger's ``The
Catcher in the Rye'' and the basic works for children, the lists
had little in common.
   The papers revealed a powerful pro-British bias, with David
Holloway, one of the conservative Telegraph's panel of experts,
commenting: ``American universities tend to supply their students
with reading lists containing thousands of titles. This is not only
daunting but counterproductive.''
   So The Telegraph suggested the 100 books every youngster who has
gone to school ought to have read by the time he or she finishes.
The Times' panel of teachers, writers and critics came up with 50
titles.
   The Times went by age group and stuck to fiction, while The
Telegraph cast a wider net: modern fiction, classics, translations,
poetry, drama and entertainment.
   The two papers found the most agreement on books for young
children, with The Times recommending, among others, the ``Winnie
the Pooh'' stories, Rudyard Kipling's ``Just So Stories,''
``Charlotte's Web'' by E.B. White and Maurice Sendak's ``Where the
Wild Things Are.''
   The Telegraph, altogether weightier in its approach, opened with
a category called cornerstones that included the Bible, Homer's
``Iliad,'' Horace's ``Odes,'' Geoffrey Chaucer's ``Canterbury
Tales'' and all of Shakespeare's plays.
   ``Don Quixote,'' by Miguel de Cervantes, John Milton's
``Paradise Lost,'' Boswell's ``The Life of Samuel Johnson and
Charles Darwin's ``The Origin of Species'' rounded out the list.
   However, against such high-brow fare as Bertrand Russell's
``History of Western Philosophy,'' the Telegraph also suggested an
entertainment list that ranged from Arthur Conan Doyle and Edgar
Allan Poe to ``The Big Sleep'' by Raymond Chandler and Agatha
Christie's ``The Murder of Roger Ackroyd.''
   Its children's category included one American work, Mark Twain's
``The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.'' Many of the others in the
category were the same as chosen by The Times.
   In its 12-18 category The Times ignored Shakespeare and the
ancients but suggested Twain's ``Huckleberry Finn,'' George
Orwell's ``1984,'' ``The Diary of Anne Frank,'' ``Jane Eyre'' by
Charlotte Bronte and ``Pride and Prejudice'' by Jane Austen.
   There was Robert Louis Stevenson's ``Treasure Island'' alongside
``The Lord of the Flies,'' William Golding's frightening tale of
power-corrupted children. Salinger's ``Catcher in the Rye'' rubbed
shoulders with ``Emil and the Detectives'' by Erich Kastner.
   The Telegraph recommended 13 translations, among them Boris
Pasternak's ``Dr. Zhivago,'' Gustave Flaubert's ``Madame Bovary,''
``The Three Musketeers'' by Alexandre Dumas, ``The Plague'' by
Albert Camus, Franz Kafka's ``Metamorphosis'' and Gabriel Garcia
Marquez's ``One Hundred Years of Solitude.''
   ``War and Peace'' didn't make the list but ``Anna Karenina'' did.
   The Telegraph's longer list found more room for American works,
mentioning F. Scott FitzGerald's ``The Great Gatsby,'' Margaret
Mitchell's ``Gone With the Wind,'' Ernest Hemingway's ``A Farewell
to Arms,'' John Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and Saul
Bellow's ``The Adventures of Augie March.''
   Vladimir Nabokov's erotic masterpiece ``Lolita'' also was
recommended.
   Poets on the Telegraph list included John Keats, William
Wordsworth, Samuel T. Coleridge, Lord Byron, Alfred Tennyson, T.S.
Eliot, W.H. Auden, Philip Larkin and Charles Baudelaire, plus ``The
Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.''
   Its recommended plays were Moliere's ``Tartuffe,'' William
Congreve's ``Love for Love,'' Richard Brinsley Sheridan's ``The
School for Scandal,'' Oscar Wilde's ``The Importance of Being
Earnest,'' Henrik Ibsen's ``The Master Builder,'' Anton Chekhov's
``The Cherry Orchard,'' George Bernard Shaw's ``Saint Joan'' and
Samuel Beckett's ``Waiting for Godot.''
   But as the Telegraph's Holloway acknowledged in his
introduction: ``It would be an ideal child who had read the lot,
and a pretty remarkable one who could score more than 50 percent.
Certainly, none ... could, hand on heart, say that he or she had
read the whole list before leaving school.''
