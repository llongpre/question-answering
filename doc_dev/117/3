The Huntington Art Gallery's current exhibition, "British Portrait Drawings of 
Notables," takes as its central theme the famous historic individuals in 
European literature, the arts and politics. It offers a modest but often 
delightful look at writers and poets such as Charles Dickens and Elizabeth 
Barrett Browning and such memorable figures as politician William Gladstone and 
adventurer Captain Blood.

Culled by curator Shelley M. Bennett from the Huntington's collection of more 
than 13,000 drawings and watercolors, the exhibit features some of the most 
famous countenances in European history, from Napoleon to Johann Sebastian 
Bach.

Any exhibit of historical portraiture must unfortunately deal with a 
contemporary ignorance of history. Thankfully, this show's descriptive labels 
are more than just title and artist. They are mercifully brief but give a touch 
of history, a hint of social implication and occasionally even a whiff of 
gossip. This kind of concise information adds immeasurably to an appreciation 
of images such as illustrator James Smetham's gaunt and intense pencil 
self-portrait and comic artist Thomas Rowlandson's stinging watercolor of the 
theatrics of actress Sarah Siddons. 
</P>
<P>
The show isn't large, but the history it covers gets further clarification by 
being broken into three small rooms, which feature heads of state, the arts and 
finally notables in politics, the military and the church. Interestingly 
enough, the distinction of social position also shows some of the artistic 
conventions that artists used to express the personality of their subject. 
Poets and artists like Lord Byron appear to glow with an inner fire. 
</P>

Creativity frequently lights their the faces with near-mystic inspiration as 
they gaze off into infinity with romantic melancholy. But heads of state such 
as King George IV are ripe for lampooning and wily politicians such as William 
Gladstone are engagingly exaggerated into a kind of physical comedy of 
political blunders. 
</P>
<P>
Explanations and commentary aside, the seduction in these portraits lies in the 
fact that these were memorable individuals. After being duly impressed by their 
credentials and the artistic trappings of their positions, we want to feel we 
can know what they were like as people. We try to read their faces, looking 
deeply into their eyes for humor or cruelty. We see in the scholar Johann 
Bodmer's hawklike profile a keen intellect and summon up William Wordsworth's 
mellowness from his relaxed and open gaze. Portraits provide a way to search 
for character and personality. It's a rewarding and timeless venture that makes 
history seem more about people than events.

<P>
Yet for all the glamour of famous personalities, this exhibit is remarkably 
restrained, tucked away in an upstairs corner of the Huntington mansion like a 
bright, shy child. The images are small and sometimes so pale the viewer must 
look closely to catch the nuances in color and line. But the subtle charms of 
the doe-eyed illustrator Kate Greenaway and the impishness of artist John 
Linnell are worth looking for. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will be on view until June 25 in the Changing Exhibitions Rooms. 
The Huntington is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 1 to 4:30 p.m. and on 
Sundays by reservation.
