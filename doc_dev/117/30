TRAIL-HIKING STUDENTS TRACK THE SECRETS OF NATURE -- AND OF HOW TO WRITE ABOUT 
IT

As the students hiked into the Santa Monica Mountains toward Eagle Rock, they 
stopped to study the rocks, the clouds and a horned lizard, the size of a 
quarter, that could have starred in a movie called "Honey, I Shrunk the 
Stegosaurus." 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, a student dropped behind, pulled a journal from pocket or 
backpack and scribbled a paragraph or two. One student wrote a mini-essay about 
life and death, inspired by a patch of dead buckwheat. Another noted that the 
mountain trail was "as wide as a spare rib."

The 16 students were taking an unusual course being offered for the first time 
this summer by Santa Monica College. Called "Writing About Nature," the 
double-credit course is an introduction to physical geography and a beginning 
composition course. Taught by geographer Bill Selby and poet Jim Krusoe, it 
requires students to learn how to use both a sling psychrometer and a simile. 
Those who succeed get credit for both Geography 1 and English 1.

Although the teachers' disciplines diverge dramatically, Selby and Krusoe say 
they have a common goal -- to teach students to observe closely and to record 
their observations with precision. "So many of our students have lost the 
ability to observe things that aren't fed to them," Selby said. "You have to be 
a good observer to be a great writer, and there's never been a great scientist 
who wasn't a great observer." 
</P>

During the six-week course, the students learn something about maps, weather 
and climate, geology and the plants and animals of Southern California. They 
work their way through a text called "Modern Physical Geography." Classroom 
lessons are supplemented with a weekly field trip, such as the recent hike to 
Eagle Rock in Topanga State Park. As the students are learning what an 
inversion is they are also studying nature writing and learning how to string 
together their own words about the natural world.

"Essentially, they have to learn to write in six weeks," Krusoe said. "It's a 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe exposes the students to model nature writers as disparate as Romantic 
poet William Wordsworth and contemporary environmental activist Edward Abbey. 
According to Krusoe, Sue Hubbell's book, "Country Year," is especially useful 
to beginning nature writers.

In critiquing students' journal entries, Krusoe is quick to praise evidence 
that they are paying close attention, whether observing an alligator lizard 
barely visible in the dust or a distant cluster of homes that looks like a 
beehive when viewed from the mountains. "The funny thing about paying 
attention," he told his students, as they perched on Eagle Rock, moments after 
displacing a raven, "is that when you really see something, sometimes it's even 
better than just using your imagination." 
</P>
<P>
Krusoe said students tend to "get too pretty" when they begin to write about 
storm clouds and life cycles. Krusoe's reading assignments for the course are 
examples of writing about nature without verbal genuflection. The assigned 
writers have "natural voices," he said.

As a geographer, Selby said he is repeatedly shocked and saddened at the lack 
of widespread knowledge about weather, the rock cycle and other natural 
phenomena. "It's scary to know that so many people know so little about the 
world we live in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Resting with the students on Eagle Rock, Selby talked about the materials that 
formed the outcropping and the natural forces that created it. Geology lessons 
are much more vivid in the wild than in the classroom. "You can't stand here 
and see the rock cycle, but you get a feeling for how the rock cycle is 
changing the landscape," Selby said.

Evelyn Batiste, 26, said she had taken the course to fulfill a science 
requirement and because she thought she would benefit from the writing 
component. After the first class, the Inglewood woman recalled, she was able to 
identify the stone in the campus parking lot as shale.
