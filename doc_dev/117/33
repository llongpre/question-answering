   You can tell the old, retired, slightly rundown
gumshoe is back on the job. He offers his younger brother, an
ex-cop, a pint of Levy's Select Irish Whiskey to help out. ``House
brand,'' he explains.
   So it goes for Robert Mitchum in ``Jake Spanner, Private Eye.''
But his new movie, airing Nov. 15 on the USA Network, is not the
``Farewell My Lovely'' or ``The Big Sleep'' kind of classic Mitchum
detective movie.
   ``This is a complete charade,'' Mitchum says of this cable
venture, which co-stars his brother, John, as the ex-cop; a son,
Jim, as a cop, and Ernest Borgnine as retired mobster Sal ``The
Salami'' Piccolo.
   The film, he reports, includes one scene ``with a bunch of naked
girls around the pool. I think it's all done very discreetly.''
   Students of the cinema may consider ``Spanner'' close in spoof
spirit to Mitchum's ``His Kind of Woman.'' That 1951 epic makes one
suspect that, during filming, the cast partook of strong drink and
had fun.
   ``I don't remember what it was all about,'' Mitchum insists. He
does recall the fun part. And that producer Howard Hughes made the
cast film it twice, the idea being to make a good film a great one.
That was no fun, he says.
   Mitchum, whose more recent work includes the two ABC
mega-miniseries, ``War and Remembrance'' and ``Winds of War,'' has
a dry, sardonic sense of humor befitting a star who has logged 46
years in movies and TV movies.
   Now 72, he has been around and about. His early days dossier
includes ditch-digging; a shot at boxing; assistant to the
astrologer Carroll Righter; the Long Beach Theatre Guild, and
writing for radio.
   That should prepare a man for anything, particularly writing
scripts where the producers, he recalls, ``would say `we need 17
pages by Wednesday,' and they wouldn't say 17 pages of what.''
   He laughs when asked if he ever feels he could write a better
script than many offered him. ``Well, I've just shown the attitude
that Johnny Huston had. He said, `If they want 'em bad, kid, we can
make 'em bad, too.'''
   Fortuneatly, his first substantial role, one that got him an
Oscar nomination in 1945, was in a good movie. He played the
war-weary infantry captain in ``The Story of G.I. Joe,'' a film
based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning column by war correspondent Ernie
Pyle.
   His first insubstantial roles were in 1943, in ``Hopalong
Cassidy'' movies. He had no trepidations about becoming an actor
then, he says, only about getting his horse to go forward and to
stop:
   ``I didn't know how to ride a horse, really. As a matter of
fact, I didn't know if you were supposed to bring your own horse.''
   Mitchum's plain, sleepy-eyed, unpretentious style often has won
acclaim, that usually occurring when he likes the movie he's in.
   Away from the cameras, he avoids the Hollywood ramble. He is a
private man. He packs a tight suitcase, odd but nice in an era when
it takes a two-by-four to stop a star from talking about his or her
personal life.
   It is known, however, that Mitchum has played guitar and likes
jazz guitarists such as Barney Kessel. But he quit as a player a
long time ago, he says: ``There are too many good ones.''
   He also has written poetry. But again, that's history, he
insists: ``No. I never see anything but the back of a check to sign
now.''
   Still, he likes ``all the coherent poets,'' particularly William
Wordsworth, the English romantic. This sparks a memory of a time a
Wordworth passage even showed up in a film he made with Katharine
Hepburn.
   Doing a fine basso version of her distinctive speech pattern,
Mitchum recalls that, reading the script, she ``comes up and says
`The world is too much with us late ends soon,''' and then demands,
``Who said that?''
   ``I said, `Nobody ever said that.' She said, `What?' I said,
`What the hell's it mean?'''
   They repaired to the studio's library to check the line and its
punctuation, Mitchum recalls. Then, the actor with a rep for
playing tough guys proceeds to surprise his listener by quoting
part of the passage from memory:
   ``The world is too much with us; late and soon, getting and
spending, we lay waste our powers ...''

   Elsewhere in television:
   SWEEPS ARE HERE AND SO IS SEX _ This is a month of ratings
``sweeps,'' and surprise, this week is ``Bad Girls Week'' on
Geraldo Rivera's syndicated talk show. Monday's show concerned
mothers in prison, Tuesday it was women in jail for life, and today
you get teen-age prostitutes. Thursday will bring on women who date
married men, while Friday's guests are ... nymphomaniacs.
   What is Phil Donahue doing in the way of counterbattery fire?
He's being relatively restrained, with all but the New York market
getting a show Monday on food's effect on sexual performance. The
poor New Yorkers.
   They got a show that previously aired elsewhere in America, a
``Donahue'' spokeswoman says. It was about transsexuals,
transvestites and hermaphrodites.
   ``Donahue,'' orginating from Los Angeles this week, has the men
of NBC's ``L.A. Law'' on tap today.
