This year's Festival, which has just completed its first week, is immensely
successful.
The opening day included a memorial reading for Alan Hancox, the Cheltenham
bookseller who has long been the Festival's patron saint and occasional
director - perhaps mainly of local interest, but the readings were by Ted
Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Michael Foot and Melvyn Bragg, no modest assembly.
Then a debate, about war correspondents' capacity to give the whole truth,
between America's Martha Gellhorn, the BBC's John Simpson, and Max Hastings,
Editor of The Daily Telegraph, which currently sponsors the Festival. The
day's rousing conclusion was Anthony Burgess's Cheltenham Lecture, on
translation; his versions of Roman dialect verses included four-letter words
seldom heard in that hall.
Is there any special theme? a visitor asked me. Half-a-dozen at least, from
which you might choose biography, travel, therapy or crime before reaching
mere literary criticism or plain old poetry (for which poets have an hour
every day).
Therapy may seem unexpected, but we had an interesting analysis of Salman
Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea of Stories by Kleinian analyst Hanna Segal.
Wordsworth's Prelude was psych-ed by Dr Ronald Britton, and George Eliot's
Middlemarch by AS Byatt and Ignes Sodre. For the opposition, Against Therapy
was a superbly witty attack on therapists by Fay Weldon, in which she read
some of her next novel. Travel was sensibly discussed together by Redmond
O'Hanlon, Colin Thubron and Gillian Tindall, and less seriously by humorist
Miles Kington, who travels with a double-bass.
Crime fielded a strong side. PD James asked How Good are Crime Novels? - is
crime trivialised? can the writer get properly into the criminal mind? As
Lady James has entered another field in her newest novel, perhaps she felt
too many literary handcuffs. In Serious Crime, three days later, Ruth
Rendell, Julian Symons and HRF Keating paced the same field with their own
individual tread; and next morning, Patrick Marnham discussed Simenon, whose
biography he published this year. John Mortimer affectionately offered a
parade of both fictional and real villains.
Biography was well represented too. The practice of the art was luminously
examined by Hilary Spurling in her account of her researches into Ivy
Compton-Burnett's family, and into Paul Scott's undeclared years. Richard
Hoggart dealt with the craft of autobiography, having written three. Among
the biographers, Richard Holmes was enlightening on the circumstances of
Shelley's death; Humphrey Carpenter on Benjamin Britten's life. Three
left-wing ex-Ministers, Tony Benn, Barbara Castle and Roy Jenkins,
approached the question of political memoirs' truth mainly through their own
writing.
Today's theatre was sharply dealt with by critic Michael Billington. London
theatre was sacrificed to musicals, while the two great subsidised
companies, the Royal National and the Royal Shakespeare, were doing work the
world might envy. There were many good young writers, but much of the
interesting theatre was in the regions. The previous evening, Billington had
been straight man to John Schlesinger's talk on directing films. It was
characteristic of the care with which this year's programme was organised
that the local Odeon gave showings of the films he spoke of.
Nigel Nicolson was authoritative on Vita and Harold; Richard Ingrams devoted
on Chesterton; John Julius Norwich and Artemis Cooper assured on the letters
between Evelyn Waugh and Lady Diana Cooper. The annual Shakespeare Lecture
was given by John Bayley on Shakespeare's Enemies, the commentators who
impose false emphases or meanings on the plays; and the Cheltenham Lecture
by Peter Ackroyd, in a marvellous hour on Englishness and the English
Language. He traced a specific character in English from Philip Sidney to
the middle of the 19th century, the equivalent of Hogarth's 'line of beauty'
 -now no more.
This is no exhaustive view of what we have heard so far in the Festival,
superbly directed by Richard Cohen. There was a children's drama festival
too, four newly-commissioned plays, that alas I had no time for. More when
the Festival is done.
