   The foreign minister of Liberia and other
prominent Liberians say their president will soon resign and leave
the country and asked for a temporary U.S. peacekeeping force in
the war torn nation.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the department received the appeal and may respond in some way
today.
   Foreign Minister J. Rudolph Johnson, Washington Ambassador
Eugenia Wordsworth-Stevenson and eight other Liberians wrote
President Bush Thursday that they expect the ``resignation and
departure from Liberia'' of President Samuel Doe ``and the
establishment of an interim government.''
   The letter proposed that ``a limited U.S. force be provided, on
the invitation of that interim government, to play an initial
peacekeeping role'' in the vicinity of Monrovia, the capital now
under siege by rebel forces.
   The appeal did not explain how the resignation and departure of
Doe would be carried out. While agreeing not to seek re-election,
the president has refused to leave the country and is sitting out
the approach of rebel forces in his heavily fortified residence in
Monrovia.
   The State Department said the letter was being studied by its
task force monitoring the crisis in the African nation founded by
freed American slaves 150 years ago.
   The letter and its signatures were regarded as authentic, the
U.S. official said.
   U.S. warships with Marine units embarked were moved close to
Liberia several weeks ago.
   Ambassador Wordsworth-Stevenson and former Liberian U.N.
Ambassador Winston A. Tubman, listed as a press spokesman, did not
answer their telephones Thursday night.
   Without foreign peacekeepers, victory ``by any faction'' will
not end the civil war and ``is far more likely to trigger a more
violent ethnic-based bloodbath,'' the letter said.
   This is because the war has spawned ``rival armed factions now
threatening the capital, has inflamed tribal animosities and
endangered the whole country as never before,`` it said.
   ``Liberians are now at the mercy of advancing bands of
foreign-armed combatants, each with its own agenda and none capable
of averting massive plunder and tribal revenge,'' the letter added,
not naming the arms providers.
   Because of its moral authority in Liberia going back to the
country's founding, ``the United States is uniquely positioned,
with minimum risk, manpower and expense to halt the breakdown of
law and order in Liberia and prevent even worse carnage,'' the
letter said.
   ``Neighboring African states can thereafter play, as it is
intended they should, a more sustained peacekeeping role,'' it
added.
   ``This crucial help would not be viewed as colonial paternalism,
Mr. President,`` the appeal said. ``It would be welcomed by all
Liberians as the generous assistance of ...the same friend that
helped create Liberia nearly a century-and-a-half ago and has been
our constitutional ideal ever since.''
   Hopes for reform ``have turned to dust'' under Doe, who took
power in a 1980 coup, the letter said. The rebels accuse his
government of corruption, mismanagement and widespread abuse of
human rights.
   Other signers of the letter were Tubman, former armed forces
chief George Toe Washington, former Customs Commissioner George
Toukolon, former Post and Telecommunications Minister Abdulai
Vandi, former Commerce Minister A. Romeo Horton, Senator Hilary F.
Gbunblee, former Justice Minister Lawrence A. Morgan and Winifred
Massaqquoi, former student adviser at the Liberian Embassy in
Washington.
