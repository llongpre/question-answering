<HEAD>Coleridge Biography Wins Whitbread Book Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A biography of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the
British poet who wrote ``The Ancient Mariner'' and ``Kubla Khan,''
was named the Whitbread Book of the Year on Wednesday.
   Author Richard Holmes was awarded the prize and $36,300 for his
biography ``Coleridge: Early Visions.''
   The volume is the first part of a major series on Coleridge, who
was an opium addict and contemporary of William Wordsworth.
   ``The prize means basically that I will have time to write
more,'' said the former teacher after receiving the award at
Whitbread's, a brewing firm.
   Holmes's book was voted Biography of the Year by Whitbread
judges in October. Competitors for the Book of the Year were
October's winners in the categories of first novel, best novel,
poetry and children's novel.
   Last year's Book of the Year award went to ``The Comforts of
Madness,'' Paul Sayer's first novel about long-term psychiatric
hospital patients who cannot speak.
