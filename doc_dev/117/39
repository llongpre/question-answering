   After four novels, polite reviews and paltry
sales, A.S. Byatt has emerged from the shadow of her younger, more
prolific sister, novelist Margaret Drabble.
   Byatt's fifth and latest novel, ``Possession,'' scooped up
Britain's and Ireland's top literary awards and the hefty hardback
sold strongly leading up to Christmas.
   But the 54-year-old author is taking fame and fortune in stride.
   ``I'm too old to get awfully changed, yet young enough to enjoy
it,'' Byatt said in an interview.
   She has, however, become more wary. When ``Possession'' began
collecting rave reviews, she welcomed journalists into her home.
But after a catty comment or two about her housekeeping appeared in
print, she insists on doing interviews by telephone.
   Some of the $39,200 from the British Booker Prize and the
$45,000 from the Irish Times-Aer Lingus International Fiction Prize
have been spent on a few good suits and a London taxicab account.
The remainder will build a swimming pool at the author's house in
southern France and maybe buy a couple of pairs of shoes.
   ``Possession,'' in the tradition of John Fowles' ``French
Lieutenant's Woman,'' intertwines past and present: A modern
romance grows as two literary scholars discover, through poetry and
fragments of letters, an unknown relationship between two Victorian
poets.
   In her previous novels, Byatt worked with material from her own
life.
   ``It was a sort of pleasure not writing realistically about
anything I had actually experienced or knew ... the 19th century I
had to invent,'' she said.
   Antonia Susan Byatt was born in 1936 into the puritannical
household of a Yorkshire judge, John Drabble. She went to a Quaker
school, then to Cambridge where she graduated with honors. She
earned a master's degree at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.
   ``I was very unhappy there. I ... wanted something different and
got more of the same. I thought America would be big and modern
with chrome on everything, moving at twice the speed. Instead I was
in a Victorian building and a Victorian library with not a man in
sight,'' she said.
   Byatt taught American and English literature, including
Victorian poetry, at University College in London until 1983, when
she quit to write full time.
   Thirty years years ago, she gave the name Antonia to her first
daughter, and began calling herself A.S. Byatt.
   ``When I had my first child I was in a fit of despair. I was 23
and I thought she had better have this good name (Antonia) and
carry it on - for I shall never write a book,'' Byatt said.
   She and her first husband, Ian Byatt, also had a son, who was
killed in an accident at age 11. She and her second husband,
investment adviser Peter Duffy, have two daughters.
   Byatt published her first novel in 1964, and three more
followed. She also wrote a critical study of William Wordsworth and
Samuel Taylor Coleridge and another on novelist Iris Murdoch, and
edited George Eliot's ``The Mill on the Floss.''
   But it wasn't until her daughters had grown and she had
foresaken academia that she wrote ``Possession,'' with its strong
plot line and sexual tension.
   ``I had a very puritanical background and was taught to think
very hard about what was valuable in life, and from that background
novels aren't very valuable at all,'' she said.
   ``It's difficult to try and put anything first if you have
children, and until recently I wasn't at all quite sure that I
could put it first.''
   The author said her American publishers, Random House, were
concerned that ``Possession,'' at 511 pages and more than 1,700
lines of Victorian poetry, would be too academic for a broad
audience.
   ``People have made too much out of the fact that I'm an
academic. ... I am an artist not a career academic, but because I
talk about things as one knows things, people assume I am trying to
impress.''
   That impulse showed in her fourth novel, ``Still Life,''
published in 1985, about a playwright who becomes absorbed in his
subject, the painter Vincent van Gogh.
   ``You couldn't do it without doing the research, so I read the
letters, just reading a biography doesn't do it,'' Byatt said. She
also went to Amsterdam to study his paintings.
   Van Gogh appealed to Byatt because of their mutual passion for
light. She suffers from ``seasonally adjusted depression'' and must
sit in front of a bright light during winter.
   ``He is a paradigm of myself. I am obsessed with the sun and in
the south I start going too fast. When I am slightly on the edge of
being mad I get terribly speeded up like him, I know what he feels
like,'' she said.
   After years of comparisons with her younger sister, Byatt shrugs
off the reports of antagonism between the two.
   ``We get on fine, we don't see each other much and we don't look
for the worst in each other,'' Byatt said. She lives in cozy Putney
in south London, while her sister settled in tony Hampstead to the
north.
   Critics lazily tended to compare the two sisters, Byatt said,
``when there are other writers more interesting to be compared to.
... I don't mind being compared to Iris Murdoch, I learned a lot
from her and I admire her.''
