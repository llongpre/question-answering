FT  20 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: A classic strategy - The
publisher which revived Everyman's Library

ABOVE A pornographic magazine shop in London's Soho, one of the most
startling publishing stories of recent years has unfolded, to the surprise
of the publishing establishment.
Three men have spent little more than two years resurrecting the nearly
defunct Everyman series of hardback classics. In the process they have
created a substantial market in the US, introduced the newly-designed tomes
into almost every good bookshop in the uk and, from scratch, sold 750,000
volumes in spite of the worst retail conditions for 20 years.
In the first nine months of trading, David Campbell Publishers, new owners
of the Everyman's Library with its hard back rights to 1,200 titles, racked
up a turnover of Pounds 2.4m. It surprised itself by making a pre-tax
profit, one of Pounds 120,000. For the current year to July, the tiny
company is on course to make Pounds 500,000 pre-tax on sales of Pounds 3.9m.
'Everyman, I will go with thee and be thy guide' is scrolled into every one
of the 60m books published in Everyman's Library since production started in
1906. The problem was that the company lost its guide some time in the
1940s. In spite of owning rights to a vast range of works from translations
of Aristotle to Conrad and Dickens, the company fell into decline. During
the 1980s it changed hands twice, ending up in the Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson
stable and with a yearly turnover of only a few hundred thousand pounds.
'I had been tracking it for a long time,' says David Campbell, who was then
a senior manager at the Hachette publishing company in France. 'I could
never understand why there was no hardback series of the world's greatest
books in English. There is even one in Norwegian for goodness sake] Everyman
was a great brand name and brand names are very rare in publishing. It was
also a good business idea.'
That idea was to produce high quality hardbacks, cloth bound rather than
glued and with acid free paper that would not brown. 'I thought that if we
could produce such books for only a few pounds more than a paper back we'd
have a market.' The target was the gift trade and readers who wanted
affordable books in 'permanent' form.
Campbell spent three years trying to raise the cash. In 1990, the venture
capital arm of merchant bank Robert Fleming provided capital of more than
Pounds 1m to cover the (much lower cost) purchase price and working capital.
For this the bank obtained a quarter stake in the new company. The bulk of
the shareholding is held by Campbell, Mark Bicknell, a 38-year-old former
investment banker, and Alewyn Birch, a man with a long career in publishing.
Campbell and Bicknell, who run the company, together put in a little over
Pounds 100,000.
'That's enough to hurt but not to take the roof away,' says Bicknell.
After the purchase it took a year to get the business running. Some of this
time was taken signing up a printer - Bertelsmann of Germany which produces
all the new Everyman books (retailing at Pounds 7 to Pounds 16 and averaging
Pounds 10) - and Random House, the US publishers, which handles all
marketing and distribution.
'You can be well managed, inventive and quick on your feet but no matter how
clever you are you need firepower and small companies don't have firepower,'
says Campbell.
'We were very fortunate that the US deal provides up front cash flow,' says
Bicknell. 'That gave enormous comfort to our printers.' On each print run
the little company is paid in advance about one third of what it is
eventually due.
David Campbell Publishers operates with small overheads, paying Pounds
18,000 a year for a three storey office in Soho and employing just four full
time staff. Currency movements have made a large contribution to profits.
The rise of the D-mark against the pound has not been beneficial but the
strengthening of the dollar has generated a windfall.
'We bought the company when it was Dollars 1.60 to the Pounds 1,' says
Bicknell. 'It then went to Dollars 1.90 and is now down to just over Dollars
1.40. If it had stayed at Dollars 1.90 making a profit would have proved
very difficult. We are making a margin of 5 per cent and currency movements
could wipe that out. I spend an hour a day talking to foreign exchange
dealers.'
The company's success nevertheless reflects its publishing nous. Of the 128
titles so far printed, 40 were not in the Everyman stable.
'Of the 1,200 titles we could plunder a good quarter we would not want to
publish,' says Campbell. Not surprising perhaps when they include
obscurities such as F W Robertson's Sermons on Christian Doctrine or The
Channings by Mrs Henry Wood. Instead Cambell has been buying hardback
reprint rights to 20th-century authors outside the Everyman stable,
including Orwell and Hemingway.
The company has also launched a series of children's books. 'I thought there
was a market for proper reading books with nice illustrations.' Alice in
Wonderland in smart, heavy duty binding sells for Pounds 7. Treasure Island
comes with drawings by Mervyn Peake.
The company has relaunched and repackaged a publication called Your
Birthday, 80 pages of historical events and famous birthdays - now being
published by W H Smith. Everyman hopes the little books, retailing at Pounds
3, will prove a cash cow. The company has also acquired the English language
rights to a new travel series by a French publishing house, the books
containing up to 2,000 illustrations in seven colours.
One trend that has helped is a readership swing towards the classics. 'I
think one reason is that there are 125,000 new titles in the English
language every year and that is far too many. Booksellers are all clogged up
and the man on the Clapham omnibus doesn't know what to take.'
One consequence is what has been termed the classics wars. Other publishers
are churning out volumes at a rapid rate of knots though all of these, from
Penguin to World Classics and Oxford are in paperback. One publisher,
Wordsworth, sells its paperback classics for Pounds 1.
Some in the publishing industry who thought Campbell was mad to buy Everyman
think Campbell could catch a cold from these new low-cost books. He
dismisses the suggestion. 'We have no competition. Wordsworth will hurt
Penguin. The more razzamataz in the market for classics the better.'
