A decade ago, the correct position for the liberal intellectual of London
NW3 was clear enough. Support the Yorkshire coal miners; rally behind the
time-honoured extraction of fossil fuels; defy the Thatcherite logic of pit
closures.
It was a cause both brave and easy to espouse. To the literary mind, it
called up comfortingly noble images of gaunt men in hob-nailed boots
gathering under great iron wheels, or women in shawls mashing tea by
blackened cottage hearths. Futile, of course: if coal is not wanted, coal
miners must pass away, whether Hampstead cherishes them or not.
So the North gets the message. No-one wants fossil fuels, and in any case
they cause holes in the atmosphere. Robbed of their collieries, the district
councils of Lancashire and Yorkshire hit upon new schemes for lighting their
streets and boiling their kettles.
This is wind power. Hitherto the stuff of New Age dreamers in far-off parts
of west Wales and Jutland, or schemes which got no further than the
blueprints of crank utopians, wind power must have blown into the practical
North on the wings of divine inspiration.
What could be better? No shortage of breezes up on the moors; no shortage of
under-subsidised hill farmers, ready to turn wind into brass; best of all,
no shortage of right-on one-upmanship, as the grimy North shows the pure
South what energy can be generated without a smidgin of uranium or mess.
But what the councillors of Bradford and Calderdale reckoned without is the
alternative map of England. This enjoys only minority acknowledgement, but
that minority is articulate, noisy and influential. According to its
preferred nomenclature, England is divided along the proprietorial lines of
distinguished writers. So you could travel from Daphne du Maurier's
Cornwall, progress to Hardy's Wessex; perhaps head up to Housman's
Shropshire, and across to Bennett's Midlands; thence up through Lawrence's
Nottingham and onwards to Wordsworth's Lakes. In the course of this journey,
naturally, you would have to negotiate the Brontes' Yorkshire.
The Brontes' Yorkshire. The passport for entry is to have read Emily
Bronte's Wuthering Heights; the objective of travelling there is to see the
old family parsonage, home to the Bronte Society since 1927; perhaps seek
out the site of Thrushcross Grange, or Lowood School, or the Haworth
graveyard.
But, above all, to cast your gaze across the same tussocked wilderness as
met the eyes of Cathy and Heathcliff; watch the same plovers dip into the
ling; inhale the same heady west wind. It is still a fair impetuous wind.
And the crime of the local councils is to have tamed it into boiling
kettles.
Leafy Hampstead sprang into alliance with the Brontes' Yorkshire last week
with a letter to the Times Literary Supplement, signed by 60 names.
Admittedly, they are not homogeneously Hampstead: Iris Murdoch sits oddly
with Cliff Richard, who (odder still) plans to be Heathcliff in a new London
musical, and the coalition of Ted Hughes with Auberon Waugh is provoking.
But these signatories are bound by the insistence that wind turbines shall
not be erected within a 20-mile radius of Haworth (sorry, the Brontes'
Haworth), because they constitute 'an assault upon our artistic and our
literary heritage.'
When utopian dreams of putting wind to work are turned into blasphemies
against nature, one has to question the pieties behind this protest. It is
an unusual conflict, in which the conservationists of the earth's atmosphere
find themselves opposed by conservationists of a literary ambience.
The reason is that in the secular society of modern intellectuals, the
houses of great writers have supplanted saintly shrines as places of
pilgrimage. Relics must be preserved, the landscape of worship maintained.
Seeing is believing. We will not understand Wuthering Heights if we cannot
roll our eyes across Emily's own moors. That must be the ultimate ground on
which the protestors stand.
Thus exposed, it reduces to a naive view of the human imagination. And it
imposes a strictly Romantic definition upon beauty, whereby wilderness alone
is chief of the muses. It would be interesting to learn how many of the
protestors would consider retrospectively demolishing all the windmills of
Suffolk - Constable's Suffolk - or indeed that unsightly water mill at
Flatford. Or are such man-made intrusions acceptable once touched by the
brush or pen of a genius?
Here lies the only solution to this issue. Bradford council, which is
hospitable to the creative spirit, must commission a work of art. It may be
a poem, a novel or a grand painting; it may be a film, even a soap opera. An
everyday tale of wind-farming folk: their trials, passions, couplings and
bereavements. If it is done, and done well, I dare say we will look kindly
upon the turbines of the West Riding.
