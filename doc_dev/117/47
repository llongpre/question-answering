   Parents are urged to begin saving for
college even before their kids are out of diapers.
   But, if they do, will that eliminate them from consideration for
financial help later?
   No, says James Scannell of the University of Rochester.
   ``Colleges and universities follow standard guidelines in
determining financial need. They do not penalize those who have
saved for education.
   ``For example, if parents have accumulated $100,000 in assets,
only about 5 percent of those funds will be counted in a needs
analysis. That is, a parent will be expected to contribute only
$5,000 toward tuition.''

   What do you do when your parents no longer can
care for themselves?
   Here are some housing alternatives for the elderly from Family
Circle magazine. For specific referral assistance, call the agency
for aging in your area and ask about the following programs:
   _ Shared Housing and Matching Programs: Here, two or more
unrelated people share a house. Usually, the living, kitchen and
bathroom areas are communal but each person has a bedroom or other
private space.
   _ Accessory Apartments: These are in underoccupied single-family
houses that are large enough to accommodate a separate apartment
with its own entrance.
   _ Elderly Cottage Housing Opportunity: These self-contained
units are built for an elderly parent on your own house lot. Many
of these dwellings are prefabricated.
   _ Retirement and ``Life-Care'' Communities: These range from
places for those in good health to those who need 24-hour nursing
care. Some have rental apartments, co-ops, condos, one-family
cottages and services that keep pace with the changing needs of the
residents.

   Airlines are working to increase travel
security, but it could take some time for them to adopt widespread
measures.
   Here are some safety suggestions from the Travel &amp; Leisure
Information Center.
   Don't spend any more time than necessary at the check-in counter
or in public concourses, restaurants and bars. Terrorists who
attack airports usually target such areas.
   As soon as you have checked in, go through the security
screening station to the departure gate or airline club.
   Don't carrry provocative items on the plane. In the Middle East,
terrorists have harassed passengers for carrying liquor or
publications they considered sexually oriented.

   A new computerized system is helping
customers select eyeglasses that are matched to their facial shape
and skin tone.
   The equipment from Liberty Optical is called facial analysis and
color enhancement system. It includes a hand-held computer, caliper
and eye and complexion charts. The computer calculates facial shape
and determines skin undertones. The caliper measures facial
dimensions.
   From these readings and charts, opticians can recommend glass
frames in terms of shape and color to suit all facial structures
and skin tone requirements.
