DORCHESTER, England 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With apologies to Browning, this is the poetic time of year along the back 
roads of southwest England, when walking trails begin to flower with spring 
blossoms all the way from Dorset, the Cotswolds and the moors of Dartmoor to 
the Scottish countryside. 
</P>
<P>
To travel through the Dorset countryside, my wife, Elfriede, and I brought one 
backpack from home, which is all we needed for overnighting in village inns 
before returning to our base in this historic country town of about 13,000. 
</P>
<P>
Driving through the southwest of England by rental car from London, we used 
Dorchester two times as a base for backpack hikes. 
</P>
<P>
Every hike around the Dorset region is an adventure of the mind, confirming the 
words spoken by Hippocrates 2,400 years ago: "Walking is man's best medicine." 
</P>
<P>
This has been called Thomas Hardy country. It's part of his novels and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Over Hill and Dale 
</P>
<P>
Side roads, cow paths and walking trails, and names of villages, hills and 
rivers make their own poetry and folk tales: Melbury Osmond and Minterne Magna, 
Piddle River, Puddletown and Plush. 
</P>
<P>
Cows and sheep graze along the way. Ruins of Iron Age forts emerge from rolling 
downs. We walked to the top of Batcombe Hill, then descended to soft green 
pastures. 
</P>
<P>
The 180-foot Cerne Giant dared us to climb his chalk hillside, which we did. He 
presides over the inns, pubs and old houses of Cerne Abbas, and probably was 
carved into the hillside in Roman times. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking the countryside and walking the villages offers what other great writers 
have said about Dorset. 
</P>
<P>
T. E. Lawrence wrote "The Seven Pillars of Wisdom" at his Clouds Hill cottage. 
He's buried at Moreton village, half a dozen miles east of Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
Jane Austen brought the village of Lyme Regis into her novel "Persuasion," as 
did John Fowles in his "French Lieutenant's Woman." 
</P>
<P>
But it was Hardy who immortalized the countryside. He spent much of his long 
and creative life here, from 1840 to 1928. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Novel Setting 
</P>
<P>
It's only a three-mile walk from Dorchester to the village of Higher 
Bockhampton, where the cottage of Hardy's birth and boyhood is a National Trust 
property. The cottage gardens are open from March to October, and you can phone 
for an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Hiking on across the brooding stillness of Edgon Heath, we could feel why Hardy 
made it a setting for "The Return of the Native," and why his life in Dorset 
could inspire "Far from the Madding Crowd." The financial success of the latter 
novel enabled him to build his Max Gate home just outside Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
The walk from Max Gate into Dorchester is a return to the cobbled streets Hardy 
walked for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
The museum has his original manuscript of "The Mayor of Casterbridge," the name 
Hardy gave to Dorchester in his novel. To the Romans it was Durnovaria. 
</P>
<P>
The town's Thomas Hardy Society has prepared walking guides to the streets and 
country lanes around it. 
</P>
<P>
King's Arms coaching inn at the old town center of Dorchester is a gracious 
place to shed a backpack. Hardy used it for scenes in his Casterbridge novel. 
</P>
<P>
The inn has 31 bedrooms with private baths; one has a four-poster. The dining 
room, two bars. 
</P>
<P>
A room for two is about $110 U.S. Call for reservations. Along the Dorset 
hiking trails, village inns such as Summer Lodge in Evershot and Plumber Manor 
at Sturminster Newton have double accommodations at about $50 U.S. Farmhouse 
lodging can cost half that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Scheduled Treks 
</P>
<P>
The three Englishmen who founded The Wayfarers walking tours open their sixth 
season of countryside adventures on April 16. The 28 scheduled treks will 
conclude Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Other walking tours in England are being offered by such organizations as 
Toronto-based Butterfield &amp; Robinson, and Dales Centre Ltd. through the 
Yorkshire Dales, sponsored by Lord Willie Peel and his associate, Terry Parker. 
</P>
<P>
The five-day, six-night Wayfarers walking adventures average about 10 miles 
daily for a group of about a dozen hikers. A walk leader charts the course and 
introduces historic sights. Luggage is transported to picnics or pub lunches 
and to overnights with dinner at country inns. 
</P>
<P>
The hiking routes cover Hardy's Dorset, Wordsworth's Lake District, Sir Walter 
Scott's Borders, James Herriot's Yorkshire, Devon Coast and Dartmoor, a 
Cotswold Way, Cornwall Creeks and Coves, Wales Border Castles. 
</P>
<P>
Hardy's Dorset hiking tour begins in Sherborne, the town of an old abbey and 
Sir Walter Raleigh's two castles. 
</P>
<P>
It continues to Cerne Abbas and its cliffside giant, Hardy's "Tess of the 
D'Urbervilles" countryside and a 13th-Century manor house, Hardy's Cottage and 
his grave at Stinsford Church. Afterward a farewell dinner in Dorchester. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of each hiking tour is 595 (about $1,065 U.S.), including breakfast, 
lunch and dinner daily, transportation of baggage, tips and taxes.
