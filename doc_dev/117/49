THE SUCCESS of Cambridge mathematician Alan Turing as a code-breaker is one
of the legends of the second world war. Around 1944, when the German naval
codes had all been cracked decisively by the government code and cypher
school at Bletchley, Buckinghamshire, Turing had (in the words of his
biographer, Andrew Hodges) 'learned how to build a brain - not an electric
brain, as he might possibly have imagined before the war, but an electronic
brain.'
If Turing were alive today - the harsh English law against homosexual men
led to his untimely death in 1954 - he would surely take a well-deserved
pride in the universal labour-saving which the electronic brain he and other
pioneers conceived plays in all our lives. He might have foreseen that it
would revolutionise business and industrial practices, and that it would
take over much of the ground-work in applied mathematics, the engineering
sciences, physics and astronomy; but could he have imagined the inroads it
has now begun to make into the area known traditionally as the humanities?
Some of the most hitherto insoluble problems of authorship have begun to
yield to scrutiny by Turing's electronic brain. The identity of the
acidulous Whig activist who contributed letters to the public prints,
attacking George III and other 18th century worthies under the pseudonym
'Junius,' was one of the earliest pieces of successful, computer-based
research analysing an author's style. Swedish scholar Alvar Ellgard
published his conclusions in A Statistical Method for Determining Authorship
(1962), where he established the overwhelming probability that the
scurrilous letters were written by Sir Philip Francis, Gibbon's schoolmaster
and later a civil servant.
Work of this kind where each word and punctuation mark in a text is computed
into lists, charts and graphs designed to show the number of times it is
used in a given type of sentence-formation - plotted against a putative norm
 -once required the resource of a mainframe computer, the kind of machine
available only to a scholar working in some handsomely endowed university
research centre. Now, though, the equipment to undertake such a project is
coming within the reach of anyone with a reasonably efficient modern home
computer.
Many of the Oxford dictionaries are now on computer disc and available
commercially to the ordinary 'user'; so are several of the standard texts of
the Oxford English School. The Oxford University Press has in train an
extensive programme of electronic publishing, as I discovered on a visit to
its headquarters at Walton Street, Oxford.
'Look here upon this picture, and on this . . .' as Hamlet says. In this
instance, Picture One depicts 20 heavy, large, dark-blue volumes occupying
4.5 ft of shelf space and costing around Pounds 1,500 for the set (according
to the bargain you strike with your supplier). Picture Two shows what author
Anthony Burgess calls a 'silver beer mat'; in other words, a compact disc.
This particular one costs Pounds 495.00. Both accommodate exactly the same
amount of information - the entire contents of the Oxford English Dictionary
2nd edition (1989). In the first instance, all you need is a strong pair of
arms and reasonably good eyesight;. in the second, a personal computer (PC)
fitted with a CD-ROM drive.
This is a gadget that extends a computer's memory vastly, necessary when the
machine has to take on board the OED's 500,000 head words, their
definitions, pronunciation, etymology, and the 24m quotations that
illustrate their use in texts since the beginning of English. Many libraries
and institutions have such a drive but most private PC owners do not
(although it is becoming less expensive and is likely to become a standard
option for them fairly soon). To run the OED electronically, you also need
to have the Microsoft system known as Windows (version 3 or above); a
Macintosh version of the OED 2nd edition will be available next spring.
In this form, the OED has become a lexical database. Its users are able to
look up English words in a variety of different ways, not just
alphabetically as before. The entire dictionary may be scanned in less than
a minute to give the answer to abstruse searches. Colonel Pickering in
Pygmalion was an authority on spoken Sanskrit and was working with Professor
Higgins on Indian dialect words in English. He would have been overjoyed at
being able to 'wild card' - that is, put an asterisk against typical
end-formations in English of the kind of words in which he was interested
and, within 40 seconds, to have on screen a complete list of all such words
in the dictionary. At a more frivolous level, crossword addicts may use the
wild card command to find words of which they know only certain letters.
There is an obvious benefit in having the OED available in this electronic
form for its editors and compilers; it releases them from an incalculable
amount of donkey work. Looking to the future, the editors now have the task
of preparing the 3rd edition of the OED, scheduled for publication in 2005.
Will there need to be a printed version of the 3rd edition at all or will by
then everyone be using it electronically?
That is a question to which the OUP does not yet know the answer. What is
becoming clear is that the old system of issuing supplements between
editions in order to keep up to date with new words and fresh shades of
meaning can now be abandoned because these neologisms can, as soon as they
are identified, be added to the database.
It is not only lexicography that it is being given a new lease of life by
the computer but classical and literary scholarship as well. Computers have
been aiding scholars in deciphering early languages like Ancient Egyptian
for many years, but now they are moving in force into the study of
literature.
The Americans have a project to put the whole of English poetry, from
Langland to Larkin, on to computer disc, and some classical texts studied in
the Oxford Greats School are available as software. The Bodleian Library in
Oxford has a terminal in the reading room and classics dons at work on
Virgil or Horace can be seen operating it.
The OUP has just launched its Oxford Electronic Texts Library for English
literature. This consists of The Complete Works of Jane Austen (Pounds 60),
The Riverside Chaucer (Pounds 75), The Poetical Works of Samuel Coleridge
(Pounds 60), and The Poetical Works of William Wordsworth (Pounds 60). These
are all out now, and coming next Spring will be electronic versions of
Hardy, Milton, Mary Shelley and Mary Wollstonecraft.
The controversial modern spelling edition of William Shakespeare: The
Complete Works, edited by Wells and Taylor and published in 1986, is now
available to PC users at Pounds 95.
None of these electronic texts has the search functions that are built into
the electronic OED. They offer the standard Oxford texts on diskettes of
regular size in which each line, as well as each page of the text, is
enumerated. Used in combination with a text-analysis software package such
as Micro-OCP (Oxford Pounds 175.00), however, you can very easily get your
computer to make searches, word lists, concordances and indexes from them.
What use, though, is it for the person who does not happen to be studying
for a BA in English or a B Litt to have such a resource? Clearly, no use at
all. If you just want to sit by the swimming pool and read Northanger Abbey
for fun, you would be much better off with the Worlds Classics paperback.
But it is important, even to such a reader, to have a text as close as
possible to the one approved by the author. Computers can play an important
role in establishing an authentic text and, in some cases, establishing
authorship as well.
A new computer-based literary discipline called Stylology has begun to
emerge in which texts are submitted to computational tests not merely as
part of textual scholarship but also in the hope of arriving at new critical
insights. An outstanding example of this is the book Computation into
Criticsm: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels and An Experiment in Method by JF
Burrows (Oxford, Pounds 25.00). The author, an Australian professor of
English, checked the speech habits of all the main characters in Jane Austen
through an extended series of computer tests and collated them, using
methods borrowed from statistics, to determine variations from normal or
average usage.
Burrows' findings inevitably are the source of much debate in English
faculties. They have been welcomed warmly in an appreciative review by at
least one prominent member of the Oxbridge establishment: Marilyn Butler,
the Cambridge professor of English Literature. His charts and graphs of
pronoun usage by Elizabeth Bennett, Mr D'Arcy and the rest prove beyond any
doubt (if they prove nothing else) that, in a novel, the distinction made up
to now between the 'grammatical' words said to be inert, and the 'lexical'
words said to be the source of energy, no longer holds. Burrows shows in
innumerable ways how grammatical words are as great a source of fictional
energy as the lexical ones in character building, narrative development etc.
Move over, Dr Leavis, you have had your byte at the cherry. Now let the
computer have its turn.
