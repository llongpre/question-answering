   The remains of England's monasteries, ``those
bare, ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang,'' symbolize
wounds too deep for healing even after 450 years.
   Anglican and Roman Catholic leaders have abandoned plans for a
commemorative service at Whitby, the Yorkshire port where Rome
asserted authority over the English church 13 centuries ago,
because of fears on the Catholic side that the event was something
of a celebration.
   ``We hit a seam of sensitivity which was deeper than any of us
realized and probably deeper than even the Roman Catholics knew,''
said the Rev. Ben Hopkinson, the Anglican rector of Whitby. ``In
the end they could not cope with it.''
   Hopkinson's announcement on Friday marked the end of two years
of planning for a weeklong religious festival beginning June 25,
including a commemorative service which was to be held on June 29
in the abbey ruins with Princess Anne attending.
   The Anglican bishop of Whitby, the Right Rev. Gordon Bates, said
he was saddened by the decision. ``It is very difficult to have a
service of penitence and reconciliation if the Catholics are not
prepared to be involved,'' he said.
   The Right Rev. Augustine Harris, the Roman Catholic bishop of
Middleborough, had nothing to add to the announcement, his office
said.
   ``There should be no blame attributed because the differences
were on both sides,'' Hopkinson said. ``Progress towards true
reconciliation must continue and not be diverted because of one
setback.
   ``But what this has done has illustrated very clearly that while
we have thought we were communicating with one another, we were
really still speaking different languages,'' Hopkinson said.
   ``We don't see it as something to celebrate,'' said the Rev.
A.J. Stacpoole, senior tutor at St. Benet's Hall at Oxford
University. The hall is associated with the Benedictine Abbey of
Ampleforth in Yorkshire.
   ``If you regard the Reformation in England as an act of state,
as the historian Maurice Powicke called it in line one of his book,
there was nothing noble about the destruction of the monasteries.
Asset-stripping is what it was all about,'' Stacpoole said Saturday.
   ``The martyr tradition of 200 years began at that very moment,
starting at the London Charterhouse where 18 monks went under,
along with Chancellor Thomas More and Cardinal Thomas Fisher,''
Stacpoole said.
   Fisher, who was the confessor to Henry's first wife Catherine of
Aragon, and More refused to take the oath demanded by the Act of
Succession affirming the king's supremacy over the church.
   Whitby, at the mouth of the River Esk on the Yorkshire coast,
was the scene of a decisive moment in the history of the English
church. In 664, a council convened at Whitby settled the date on
which Easter was celebrated in Britain. The question was far from
trivial, for it represented the triumph of Rome over the practices,
and the calendar, of the Celtic Christian church.
   Whitby was sacked by Danish raiders in 867 and was refounded as
a Benedictine house in 1078.
   Henry VIII split with Roman Catholicism in 1533, suppressed the
smaller monasteries three years later, and turned against the great
monasteries, including Whitby, in 1539.
   Whitby Abbey had fallen into ruins by the early 19th century,
and much of what was left was shelled by the German fleet in 1914.
Of the church built in 1222, only the front wall and the two
transepts are still standing. Nothing remains of the other monastic
buildings.
   Such holy ruins inspired William Shakespeare to write of ``bare,
ruined choirs'' _ the choir being the rear portion of the church
where monastic services were held.
   And it was from his vantage point above the ruins of Tintern
Abbey in southwestern England that William Wordsworth heard ``the
still, sad music of humanity'' and rejoiced in ``that blessed mood,
in which the burthen of the mystery, in which the heavy and the
weary weight of all this unintelligible world, is lightened.''
