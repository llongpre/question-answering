EUROPE'S oldest music festival, the Three Choirs, outstrips Edinburgh by two
centuries, its antecedents reaching back to the Restoration. The annual
programme strives to maintain a balance between tradition and innovation,
with large choral works its forte - a staggering number are mounted within
the space of a week, with the conducting shared between the three cathedral
organists of Worcester, Hereford and Gloucester.
This year's director, John Sanders, produced perhaps the week's outstanding
performance, a Bach B minor Mass, in which all aspects gelled: precise
chorus intonation, distinctive soloists led by Emma Kirkby,
period-instrument clarity from the Brandenburg Consort.
The premieres were mixed. Alongside a slightly dull brass piece from Hugh
Wood and an unexpectedly-imaginative anthem from John Rutter came Philip
Cannon's A Ralegh Triptych, settings of three poems penned in anticipation
of execution. The angularity of Cannon's spare A Cappella writing poses a
challenge. That it came across well was due to the boys' alertness in tuning
and attentive direction by Donald Hunt. Cannon merits unearthing: his
Ligeti-inspired Quartet, Chansons for soprano and harp or the Oraison
Funebre de l'Ame Humaine for strings, all manifestly called for revival.
Despite a valiant effort by the tenor, Maldwyn Davies, a tiring Royal
Philharmonic Orchestra just took the edge off Finzi's sumptuous Wordsworth
setting, Ode to Immortality, whose word-painting is as delicate as
Britten's. A different problem is set in Janacek's inspirational Glagolitic
Mass. For all the flair in big climaxes, flat choral enunciation merge with
a lethargic orchestral reading. The work has much in common with Janacek's
pliant operatic writing, yet only John Mitchinson, the veteran tenor, found
the required energy for its impassioned Gloria and Credo. The show was saved
by Mark Lee, the young organ soloist, whose playing proved one of the
distinctions of the week. The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra rose to
the Processional finale like an idle schoolboy runner who surges
ostentatiously to the finishing line.
Of the visitors, Richard Hickox followed a scintillating Elgar Alassio with
a Mahler Fourth Symphony of breath-taking indifference. But Michael
Berkeley's ritualised, Messiaenic organ concerto (its inflections suggest a
debt to Jehan Alain) easily proved its repertoire worth, with Thomas Trotter
an articulate soloist. More striking was Meredith Davies conducting EJ
Moeran's cello concerto, eloquently played by Raphael Wallfisch, who has
also recorded the work for Chandos. Davies's direction proved something of a
revelation: he has been too long exiled from the podium.
Chief pleasure of a buoyant Fringe was Nicola-Jane Kemp's song recital,
setting Schubert and Wolf alongside a new cycle by Gloucester composer,
Christopher Boodle. There were two literary tributes. A new biography of
Hubert Parry, harbinger of the English revival, was prefaced by an
enthusiastic talk from its author, Jeremy Dibble, at Parry's own Highnam
Church, Paul Spicer's lecture celebrating the centenary of Herbert Howells
set the tone for the week. Musical examples, especially those from an
earlier period, left one in no doubt that Howells' importance in the British
canon calls for reassessment.
This summer also brought a new history of the Three Choirs by Anthony Boden,
a canny sifter of anecdote, as his books on the Gloucester poets, Ivor
Gurney and FW Harvey, have already shown. A sense of fun pervades Three
Choirs (Alan Sutton, Pounds 20), whose meticulous research starts with the
Civil War period and Restoration and supplants dry annals by a colourful,
though never trite, account of the festival.
