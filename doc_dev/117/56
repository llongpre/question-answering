The relentless punning, literary allusiveness and political disquisitions of
Tom Stoppard's Travesties, written 20 years ago, is still perhaps a bit much
for West End audiences.
The loudest laughs for Adrian Noble's Royal Shakespeare Company production,
which arrived from the Barbican at the Savoy Theatre last week, were
certainly reserved for the clowning, the gimmickry and song and dance
routines. A speech that quotes or deliberately misquotes TS Eliot,
Wordsworth and Churchill in the space of a few sentences is doubtless
unlikely to get belly laughs; but the theatrical appeal of he who quotes -
British consular official Henry Carr, confusedly reminiscing about Joyce,
Lenin and Tristan Tzara in the Zurich of the Great War - is large enough to
carry away any audience.
As played by Antony Sher with a perfect feeling for the character's
magnificent vague magniloquence, his old man's disinclination to tie up a
sentence or stick to a fact, his sheer joy at swimming in cliche, Carr is an
irresistibly naughty old blunderer, grinning with vivid schadenfreude as he
holds on to one fact, at least: that Joyce is dead while he himself isn't.
And he's not just an old blunderer, but a young one too; for he must slip
continually between his dusty anecdotage and his dapper heyday, a feat Sher
performs with easy brilliance.
In his younger incarnation Carr, along with most of the other characters, is
presented in terms of his role in an actual production by Joyce's English
Players of The Importance of Being Earnest. This rendering of Joyce through
the framework of Wilde is a marvellous basic image for the play, which not
only offers actors acting real-life people acting (Carr, too, is based on
fact), but with its stopping and starting and repeated versions of the same
scene nicely dramatises the very act of remembering.
To angle the historical drama through insignificant Carr's eye is Stoppard's
most poignant and Joycean invention. Great art may perfectly well be a
'celebration of nonentities', or of tyrants, Joyce informs the Dada-ist poet
Tzara (the spiffy David Westhead). A pity that, as Alastair Macaulay found,
reviewing the production's Barbican opening on this page last September,
Lloyd Hutchinson isn't commanding enough as Joyce. He looks right, but lacks
the true top o' the morning brio.
The tyrant Lenin fits more problematically into Stoppard's scheme, but even
he - in this recension of the published text - has the Wildeanism of: 'To
lose one revolution is a misfortune. To lose two looks like carelessness.'
Geoffrey Freshwater - a fine portrayal of uncanny physical likeness - cracks
that one from a high orator's platform cleverly cut into the backdrop by
designer Richard Hudson.
Amanda Harris, Rebecca Saire and Trevor Martin as Wildean women-folk and
manservant give immaculate support. Adrian Noble's staging - which fits its
new home pretty snugly - is intelligent, vigorous and sometimes touching.
Savoy Theatre until June 4
