FT  23 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): From lender to investor -
Banks appear increasingly willing to take equity stakes in small companies

Looking for equity? Forget the venture capitalists - they are too demanding.
Leave aside private investors or 'business angels' - they are difficult to
track down. Why not try your high street bank? It is very early days, but
there are signs of a growing willingness on the part of banks to consider
providing equity.
In many cases this has been forced upon them. Sometimes the best way to save
a business from failure is to convert loans into equity. Last month,
shareholders in Trencherwood, a quoted housebuilder, approved a refinancing
package which gave the company's banks a 37 per cent stake, rising to a
maximum of 67 per cent if they converted their preference shares.
'The bank takes the view that a 'gone concern' is not attractive to anyone,'
says Jim Tracey, a manager in the corporate recovery department at Royal
Bank of Scotland, one of the three banks involved. 'If we can keep them
alive, we do so and we look to take an equity holding. We swap lost money
for a potential upside in the years ahead.'
Putting equity into a business in trouble, rather than calling in the
receiver, represents a shift in bank attitudes. But Tracey's department is
part of a unit at RBS, called Specialised Lending Services, which aims to
help companies by taking an equity stake.
Since the end of last year it has been headed by a venture capitalist, Derek
Sach, former managing director for UK investments at 3i. Midland Bank has
also launched an ambitious programme to provide equity to unquoted companies
through its branches and a network of small regional venture funds.
Midland is ready to refinance well-managed businesses where interest charges
threaten to overwhelm the company, says David McMeekin, a corporate banking
director. 'If we convert a loan to equity, it may give us something to set
against the provision we have to make. But this is not the way I want to see
the banks ending up with equity stakes in their customers.' The model
envisaged by Midland is for the bank to take a modest equity option,
starting as small as 2 or 3 per cent, to help a customer complete a
fund-raising. 'If all went well, we would sell the stake back to the
company,' says McMeekin. Midland has completed a dozen equity deals since
launching its new policy.
An important reason for the banks' move into providing equity is a desire to
share in the high returns which successful equity investments can provide.
The narrow margins on much conventional lending can soon be eaten up by
failures.
'It has always frustrated me that if a company did well, the bank was repaid
and the shareholders went off with big amounts of money,' comments Hans
Blankvoort, UK general manager of Bank Mees &amp; Hope, part of the Dutch ABN
Amro banking group. Mees's corporate finance department has begun providing
equity alongside debt finance to a small number of customers.
The frustration felt by bankers was highlighted in a recent study* of
investment returns carried out for National Westminster Bank. A survey of
the fortunes of more than 100 small business customers between 1986 and 1990
showed the bank increased funding at a faster rate than the owners boosted
their investment. Firms that borrowed performed better than those that did
not.
Yet while the average return on the owner's invested capital was 48 per
cent, interest payments on the bank loans provided a return of only 10 per
cent.
Jane Bradford, head of NatWest small business services, says: 'When small
business owners invest their own funds they assess the risk for a
potentially unlimited return, whereas the return on a bank loan is limited
to the interest rate charged. But both stand to lose equally, if a small
business should fail.' Business owners may have little sympathy for this
argument. The banks have not endeared themselves to their small business
customers, with increased charges and reductions in loan facilities.
But a more serious issue is whether bankers are capable of assessing equity
risks. The flip response, though one with an element of truth, is that much
of their lending in the late 1980s involved an equity-style risk anyway.
Crucial to success will be the sort of company they back. Mees &amp; Hope says
it will target the more established business with turnover of Pounds 10m or
more and a good business plan. Of the four companies backed so far, one was
a management buy-out of Bolton Brady, the industrial door-making subsidiary
of Tarmac, and another was Foster Church, a start-up company. Mees has taken
a 20 per cent stake in Foster Church, which provides working capital finance
to young companies and, with a Dutch investment company, a stake of just
over 50 per cent in Bolton Brady.
'Combining loans and equity is the way forward for banking,' says Darryl
Keys, corporate banking manager. Mees plans to provide equity backing of
between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 1m to about a dozen companies. Clearly, a
Dutch merchant bank has a different culture and approach than the UK
clearing banks. For the UK clearing bank, equity investments involve a leap
of the imagination.
NatWest found how difficult it was to get equity investments right when it
was forced, in January 1991, to acknowledge the failure of its Growth
Options venture, launched five years earlier. Growth Options started out
taking equity options alongside loans, but then moved to taking
straightforward equity stakes. But a higher-than-expected failure rate
forced NatWest to merge it with NatWest Ventures, its venture capital arm,
after it had made 65 investments involving Pounds 10m of equity. 'We just
couldn't make money out of these small investments,' said Mark Wordsworth of
NatWest Ventures. 'The costs are the same as for bigger companies. You still
need to spend Pounds 50,000-Pounds 70,000 on accountancy and legal fees
before you start.'
If anything goes wrong with a small company, there is little leeway for a
rescue. 'We can refinance bigger companies with a balance sheet and a
management structure, but with very small companies with Pounds 100,000 of
turnover there is nothing you can take out,' says Wordsworth. NatWest's
experience appears to indicate that if banks are to provide equity it will
be, as Mees has also decided, to larger companies.
Barclays Bank has targeted the slightly larger business through a link with
Baronsmead, a venture capital company. Barclays says it has backed about 40
companies, investing an average Pounds 400,000 in each since 1989. Barclays
uses Baronsmead's venture capital expertise to pick companies, but bank
staff are seconded to the venture firm. Barclays says it has had only one
failure among companies backed, and it expects to continue the joint venture
when the initial Pounds 20m of funds are exhausted.
The banks are attempting to succeed in a field of investment in which their
venture capital subsidiaries have found it difficult to make money. It will
be several years before the results of the present renewal of interest in
equity come through. Meanwhile, the banks will need to be selective in the
companies they back and business owners must be choosy in who they tie up
with.
