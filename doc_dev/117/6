This month, the great cultural monument that is Sir Stephen Spender will be
85 years of age. It is now more than 30 years since the death of Louis
MacNeice, 20 since the deaths of WH Auden and C. Day Lewis and 10 since that
of Christopher Isherwood. Spender, the last surviving member of that
much-memorialised generation of the 1930s, has survived them all - and he
continues to write and review regularly to this day.
The poetry, however, has come very slowly. His last full collection, The
Generous Days, was published in 1971; his Collected Poems of 1985, though
containing some new works (including notable elegies to MacNeice and Auden)
was largely a re-presentation - often drastically re-worked  - of older
material.
In 'Worldsworth', the best poem of his new collection, Dolphins, he records
his first brush with poetry. In 1916 the Spenders were obliged to leave
their home on the cliffs near Sheringham, Norfolk after two stray German
bombs fell nearby. The family decamped to a farmhouse near Lake Derwentwater
and it was there that Spender, then seven years old, heard his father
reading Wordsworth in the garden. The vocabulary and the cadences of
romanticism became a life-long passion and it is a passion that has both
enriched and hobbled his poetry.
'Worldsworth' is just one of several autobiographical poems in this short
collection. Another, 'Air Raid', captures a moment in 1941 when a bomb, that
'unreasoning fury from an enemy's vision of life', destroys the outer walls
of a house, turning what had once been private and inside - a bath, a
wardrobe, books, the telephone - into a public spectacle. All that "tender
sensitive life" has been thrown away.
Variants upon this observation are the over-riding theme of the collection,
no matter how widely it may seem to range in subject matter  - from memories
of the first and second world wars, through elegies for dead friends, to a
long poem which examines the explosive relationship between Rimbaud and
Verlaine. What can be preserved of the intensities of the inner life in a
world that seems hell bent on its own annihilation? The poet, according to
Spender, acts as a mediator between the uniquely private self and the world
outside us. There is a lived, shared reality which is both general to
everyone and unique to each person, and it is poetry's task to describe it.
Unfortunately Spender's abilities in this book are rarely equal to his
vision. 'Air Raid' collapses at the end into cliche and verbal redundancy;
many of the other poems seem too casually written, as if they are little
more than notebook jottings. Only in the Wordsworthian blank verse of
'Worldsworth' do we find a sustained and excellent piece of writing from
beginning to end.
Sir Stephen Spender, cultural ambassador plenipotentiary, the memorialiser
of himself and his famous generation, journalist, editor, essayist,
university teacher and literary critic seems to have spent so much time
clinking glasses across tables and lurching from glittering lunch to equally
glittering dinner (anyone who doubts this should read his Journals
1939-1983) that it is a wonder he has had the time - or the powers of
concentration - to write any good poetry at all. The fact is, of course,
that he has written a little. But most critics would agree that he has not
achieved his life-long ambition to be a great poet. His more enduring
achievements have been elsewhere: as a writer of prose, for example, (an
autobiography, World within World, is his masterpiece). Here he has found a
way with words that is much more subtle, flexible and assured than most of
his poetry ever manages to be, marred as it so often is by a peculiar
stiffness and Shelleyan rhetoric. As a spokesman for liberal values, no
matter how hopelessly privileged the spokesman may at times seem to be,
Spender has also made his mark: to argue for the sacredness of the
individual and his impulses is, after all, one of the finest fruits of the
romantic movement.
