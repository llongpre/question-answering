   Cardinal John J. O'Connor, New York Mayor
Edward I. Koch and hundreds of other pilgrims gathered in the stark
boglands of western Ireland today to begin a campaign of prayer for
peace in Northern Ireland.
   ``I hope to do nothing but be a pilgrim. I hope to do nothing
but pray,'' O'Connor, who heads the New York's Roman Catholic
archdiocese, said at the airport. He said he would not get involved
in political issues.
   Koch, however, repeated his belief that the British should
``ultimately'' get out of Northern Ireland and said the government
should release a report on police violence in the province.
   Koch joined the pilgrims at the airport following a visit to the
Netherlands, where he offended some officials by suggesting drug
enforcement efforts were lax.
   He embraced O'Connor, who kidded him, ``You're all over the
papers'' _ a reference to a photograph of Koch pouring a pint of
ale in a Dublin pub.
   ``I've frequently been told the mayor is going to Ireland and
taking me along,'' O'Connor joked.
   The pilgrims were drawn to this village by the Shrine of Our
Lady of Knock, which commemorates the evening in 1879 when 15
townsfolk said they saw a vision of Mary, the mother of Jesus. Pope
John Paul II visited the shrine in 1979.
   Some skeptics have argued that a pilgrimage composed mostly of
Catholics will succeed only in threatening Northern Ireland's
Protestants, but several pilgrims said prayer deserved a chance.
   ``Ireland has been suffering for hundreds of years, and the
problems don't seem to have been solved by any other means,'' said
Agnes McShane, of Hastings-On-Hudson, N.Y. ``(English poet William)
Wordsworth said, `More things are wrought by prayer than this world
dreams.' ''
   After three days at Knock, O'Connor will visit Belfast and
Armagh in Northern Ireland and conclude the pilgrimage with two
days in Dublin.
   At least 2,646 people have died since sectarian violence began
in August 1969 in Northern Ireland, where the predominantly
Catholic Irish Republican Army is fighting to unite the province
with the Irish Republic.
   When he announced the pilgrimage on St. Patrick's Day after
three Catholics were killed a Protestant gunman rampaging through a
Belfast cemetery, O'Connor called for 100,000 participants and said
prayer had been neglected as an instrument of peace in Northern
Ireland.
   The number was then scaled down to 1,500, but only 350 signed up.
   Still, more than 20,000 people, including many American tourists
already in Ireland, are expected to join prayers at the shrine on
Saturday.
   Dan Kelly, a telephone company employee from Garnerville, N.Y.,
said he came to Knock to pray for peace.
   ``It might call more attention to the problem in the States,''
he said. ``I think that's what Ireland needs _ more attention from
the people in the States.''
   Jim Higgins, the Knock area's lawmaker in the Dail, or
parliament, wished the mission would produce a miracle, ``because
at this juncture it will require almost divine intervention to
resolve the problems of the north.''
   Higgins, a Catholic representing the opposition Fine Gael party,
said the mission should persuade Americans of ``the futility'' of
the IRA's guerrilla war.
   The IRA is outlawed on both sides of the border. In Belfast, its
legal political wing, Sinn Fein, said the group had asked to meet
its leader Gerry Adams.
