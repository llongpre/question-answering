Beauty does not qualify you as a novelist. Dame Iris Murdoch will take no
offence if one describes her appearance in terms of elderly grunge. Her
husband, Booker Prize judge John Bayley, matches her aptly with his
professorial bagginess.
Why should the essentially cerebral, hunched and private business of writing
demand painted nails and trim thighs? And yet there is no doubt that an aura
of pulchritude helps.
Joanna Trollope is on view in every bookshop window, in a misty vignette of
blonde allure. Donna Tartt pouts on her dust jackets like the classic belle
dame sans merci. Downmarket, Jackie Collins oozes ripe glamour; upmarket
Anita Brookner is fading, but still has the air of an arch schoolmistress at
whose feet one would gladly sit. And as for Jilly Cooper - her convent girly
radiance beamed above the frightful scrummage that is The Spectator's annual
party: she slew me with a wink.
Since looks sell books, it is not surprising that the superlative of all
supermodels, Naomi Campbell, should have become an author. Such is the
triviality of modern popular culture.
What has unnerved the literary establishment, however, is the extent to
which Naomi Campbell has dedicated herself to writing. According to one
slur, her publishers at Heinemann had to send her a simple 250-word synopsis
of her novel, Swan, in order that she might be able to tell people what it
was about. Not because, in the flux of creative energy, she had become
over-absorbed in her plot and her characters, but rather because the story,
in fact, was effectively composed by someone else.
Well, ghost-writing is nothing new. It is an odd variation of getting the
school swot to write an essay for you, but no great calumny attaches to the
process. It is generally known, for example, that whenever the reader of
Margaret Thatcher's memoirs comes across a flash of wit, or a nice turn of
phrase, then one of her several ghosts, John O'Sullivan, is revealing his
hand. Doltish sports personalities, too numerous to mention, have always
relied on spectral scribes; royalty, film stars and rock singers likewise.
If one describes ghosting as a form of collaboration, it begins to look
rather respectable. It is rarely revealed how far the verses of Keats - a
paradigm of isolated, hermetic genius - were altered or 'improved' by his
friends: the progress to 'fair copy' of his long poem Isabella, for example,
is strewn with corrections and interpolations from an unsung associate
called Richard Woodhouse.
John Stuart Mill's posthumously-published Autobiography is reckoned to have
had, technically, no fewer than seven authors (primarily his wife, Harriet).
The first-page pieties of thanking spouses for support probably conceal
masses of ghost-writing; and there is scarcely a book in the whole of
English literature which will not have been in some way shaped by its
printer, publisher or editor.
Not to mention, of course, those cases of literary association that obscure
pure authorship. How much of Conrad's work was done by Ford Madox Ford?
Which of Wordsworth or Coleridge was the more responsible for The Ancient
Mariner, and of Eliot or Pound for The Waste Land? And did Bacon write
Shakespeare?
The cult of the author is a powerful force: the local economy of
Stratford-upon-Avon will collapse overnight if it is ever demonstrated that
Bacon ghosted the Bard. Even when we know that an author such as Homer can
never have existed in any proper sense, we still like to cherish an image:
blind, old, wise Homer, who would have a cottage to visit if only we could
find it.
Knowing who wrote a poem or a story is, for many people, crucial to whether
or not they like it; no wonder the Sunday supplements like to tell us what
Peter Ackroyd has for breakfast, and publishers are so happy to have the
likes of Madonna or Naomi Campbell on their lists.
But in a wider philosophical context, it does not matter whether young Naomi
Campbell wrote a story called Swan or Nigel Spivey wrote it for her.
As French literary theorists would put it, there are no such things as
authors, only 'author-functions'.
Authors, as names in a catalogue, are useful for christening a particular
discourse, or placing some historical constraints on what their stories
might mean. But ultimately their own intentions belong to oblivion. The
supermodel author and her ghost are equally bound to be effaced.
The discourse of the novel belongs to greater powers than an individual can
wield: social systems, institutions and customs rule us all, including the
literary genius.
