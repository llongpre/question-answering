<LEADPARA>  LITERATURE DIED in the past 30 years, partly by its own hand, partly by
attacks from outside, partly from the extensive social and technological
changes known as postmodernism. The authority of a high-culture literature
erected on the works of Dante and Shakespeare, Voltaire and Swift, Wordsworth
and Goethe, Valery and Joyce that flourished in capitalistic Western society
in the high age of print, between the mid-18th century and the mid-20th, is
now gone.;    This was literature in the grand sense: Shelley's unacknowledged
legislation of the world; Eliot's monuments of the European mind extending
from the rock drawings in Lascaux to his own epic of the disintegration of
Western society after the Great War, "The Waste Land." It was an art in the
service of its world. Dickens' novels, for example, gave themselves and
literature substantial value by doing the important work of making sense of
the difficulty of living in the strange new surroundings of the impersonal
19th-century city.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     A great literature in the native language was believed to be a matter of
pride for national states, and a knowledge of literature a mark of polite
culture.;    The most obvious break in this tradition has been the
disappearance of novels like Hemingway's, poetry like Frost's, plays like
O'Neill's that were read and understood by at least the educated and spoke to
the serious issues of the '20s and '30s. Writings such as these legitimized
literature and its authors, giving them a place of dignity in the culture and
the school curriculum.;    But they, almost mysteriously, disappeared into
tormented poetry like Robert Lowell's and John Ashberry's, novels like Norman
Mailer's "factions" -- part fiction, part reporting -- Saul Bellow's
black-humor tales of culture under siege, and plays of meaninglessness and
exhaustion like Samuel Beckett's "Endgame" or Pinter's "The Birthday Party."
Even these voices of the old literature trailing off are gone now, and in
their place we have the turgid black art associated with names like Tobias
Wolff, Andrea Dworkin, William Burroughs and Ann Beattie.;    There remain
honorable workers, particularly in the novel, but it doesn't matter much
anymore. The brightest and the most imaginative thinkers don't any longer find
poetry, fiction or drama the best ways to work out their ideas or to influence
the public view on important questions.;    Meanwhile, within the academy, a
group of radical university critics practicing what has been aptly called "the
hermeneutics of suspicion," has actively sought the destruction of the old
literary order. Known in the broadest sense as structuralism and
deconstruction, these have been a poetics militant, attacking all authority,
including all literary authority, as illegitimate and repressive, showing the
meaninglessness of the language and the emptiness of the "truths" in literary
works.;    Originally employed as a tool for ferreting out the unspoken
presuppositions of philosophical texts by "deconstructing" language choices to
reveal the presumed prejudices of the author, deconstruction's effect on
literature has been to make even the most harmless texts seem tendentious,
full of hidden political agenda.;     Political masquerades;  Radical politics
has played a similarly demeaning role. Feminists and gays have denounced
literature as an instrument of straight male domination. From that
perspective, "Moby Dick" is transformed from an epic of American mercantilism
and transcendental quest into a portrayal of masculine individualism gone mad,
despoiling nature and seeking death.;    So strident has the conflict become
that well-educated people have actually made such statements as "To write well
is counter-revolutionary.";    Signs in the classroom;  As literacy rates
decrease, courses in composition are increasingly replacing courses in
literature in colleges and universities. As students read less, verbal scores
on the SAT exams continue to drop, as do enrollments and majors in literature.
The students are not voting only with their feet. In 1988, Stanford University
students demanded that a required course in great books drop some of the
classics written by "dead white males" to make room for books by women, blacks
and Third World writers. Under pressure, the faculty and administration caved
in, replacing some classics with books like Simone de Beauvoir's "Second
Sex.";    The death of literature, and the parallel severe disturbances in all
the arts -- witness the recent questioning of "what is art?" in the Robert
Mapplethorpe obscenity case -- are a part, minor but very interesting, of a
much larger social change that began in the 1960s and is putting severe
pressure on all our traditional values and major institutions. There is as yet
no satisfactory name for this extensive social shift.;    "Postindustrialism"
and "postmodernism" record only our sense that older ways of life have passed
without specifying what has replaced them. Still, we know the symptoms: a
shift to a service from a manufacturing economy, from a print to an electronic
mode of information storage and retrieval, from an economics of scarcity and
saving to the "affluent society" of consumers, from a politics of
representation to one of individual and group social activism, from an
acceptance of authority to individual freedom of choice, and from disciplined
self-denial to hedonism, permissiveness and self-indulgence -- the cult of
narcissism.;    The Gutenberg devolution;  The breakdown of literature is a
small matter alongside major social catastrophes such as the ruin of the
nuclear family. But the death of literature, and the events that have
accompanied it, can be understood only in the larger context of this social
revolution. Literature is book-centered, and it began to lose its authority --
and consequently its reality -- at a time that electronics began replacing
print as the most efficient and attractive source of entertainment and
information. Where the printed work of literature was stable and durable, the
electronic image floats, transitory and infinitely recombinable in new
configurations.;    The fate of literature is closely keyed to the state of
the printed book. Literature, we might say, institutionalizes the best that
can be said of the power of print. But as electronics takes over, the book
suffers some heavy blows, and literature feels them as well. Publishers'
inventories are now heavily taxed by the federal government, making it
difficult to keep classics in print. Copyright, which makes it possible for
authors to make a living, is under challenge. Books printed on acid paper are
disintegrating on the shelves of libraries at a rapid rate.;    No wonder,
then, that there are many and ominous signs of the end of the Gutenberg era,
such as Columbia University's recent decision to close its prestigious library
school on the grounds that the professional study of books and their
management no longer has a place in a research university. Nor is Columbia
alone; 14 prestigious library schools have closed in recent years.;    Under
these kinds of social and academic pressures it is by no means certain that
some modified form of literature, by whatever name, will continue to exist in
the postindustrial, post-Gutenberg future. There is always the possibility
that literature was so much a product of print culture and industrial
capitalism, as bardic poetry and heroic epic like Homer were of tribal oral
society, that, like chivalry in the age of gunpowder, it will simply disappear
in the electronic age.;    Books as weapons;  The real problem for the
deconstructionists' new conception of literature is its unquestioned
assumption of the continued authority of the book and the ability to read with
the precision and intensity that the printed page insists upon. There is,
however, no guarantee whatsoever that very many people are going to find
reading and talking about books an important activity.;    It is not that the
book will disappear -- more than 50,000 titles are printed in the United
States annually -- or that literacy will break down altogether. But in the
electronic age, books, words and reading are not likely to remain sufficiently
authoritative and central to knowledge to justify literature.;    If
literature, however, is to survive in some diminished form, positive ways to
speak of it must be found again.;    Suspect creativity;  One of the
distinctive marks of literature and the arts has in the past been that they
are primary instances of human creativity. But now creativity itself is
suspect and plagiarism, its dark opposite, increasingly hard to define. Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, had
difficulty understanding why people took seriously his unacknowledged use in
campaign speeches of details from the biography of the British Labor leader
Neil Kinnock.;    A few years ago, a panel was convened to discuss the use by
D.M. Thomas, in his popular novel, "The White Hotel," of whole pages from
another book titled "Babi Yar," about the slaughter of the Jews of Kiev by the
Nazis. One expert on the panel expressed doubt that there is any such thing as
pure creativity: "What is plagiarism, apart from legal questions of ownership,
copyright or financial gain? How, for example, does it differ from repetition,
reportage, quotation, paraphrase, exposition and other ways of reproducing
previously existing material? Plagiarism is closer to pride, a sin of the
spirit, than to the criminal activities of the burglar."  </TEXT>
