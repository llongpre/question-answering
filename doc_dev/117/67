   When American dramatist Richard Nelson was asked
to write a play for Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company, he set one
condition: ``There was no way I would write about English people;
that would be wildly presumptuous.''
   Instead, Nelson chose as his topic a troupe of American
academics leading a theater tour of England. The result is ``Some
Americans Abroad,'' the first play the state-subsidized RSC has
ever commissioned from an American.
   Reviews have been mixed to favorable. Michael Billington in The
Guardian thought it was ``beadily funny'' in Nelson's
``characteristically wry, ironic'' style.
   But Martin Hoyle in The Financial Times found the play ``a
frequently delicious joke (that) may be as insubstantial as dry
ice,'' adding, ``Had an Englishman created these Americans ... it
would have been a case for the Race Relations Board.''
   The play, directed by Roger Michell, had its world premiere July
19 at the RSC's small studio theater, The Pit, located in the
depths of London's Barbican Center. It runs in repertory through
Sept. 12.
   It would have been easy for ``Some Americans Abroad'' to pander
to the cultural snobbism of some English intellectuals who love
mocking American theatergoers for laughing in the wrong places or
romanticizing anything British.
   But the 38-year-old Nelson said in an interview that he was
after greater complexity. His characters are mostly duplicitous,
money-obsessed and culturally bereft, but the play, he said, ``deep
down is about exile, not only geographically but out of time. These
are people of a liberal consciousness adrift in a time when to be
of the liberal left in the United States is very frustrating.
   ``I never thought, `Let's go bash on Americans and really make
fun.'''
   An all-British cast plays American tourists _ faculty, mostly,
and several students _ who frequent theaters in London and
Stratford-upon-Avon omnivorously feasting on a culture which, it
becomes clear, they don't really understand.
   Chief among them are Joe (Anton Lesser), an erstwhile leftist
and cynical professor of English; Philip (Oliver Cotton), his
broodingly handsome colleague accused of molesting one of the 22
students on the tour; and Henry (Simon Russell Beale), the young
lecturer being quietly ousted from his job.
   Nelson said he wanted to explore attitudes towards culture: ``I
think we (in America) are, by and large, a country that is
unconcerned about its own culture and the continuity of that
culture.
   ``We latch on to things that don't matter, that we can put on a
pedestal.''
   Accordingly, his characters sentimentalize plays whose titles
they can't remember and, in one especially peculiar scene, appear
on Westminster Bridge in the rain reciting William Wordsworth's
celebrated poem about it.
   The theme of exile, physical and spiritual, is common to
Nelson's plays. ``Between East and West,'' seen in London in 1987,
examines the displacement of a Czech theater director and his
actress wife who have moved to New York from Prague.
   ``Principia Scriptoriae,'' which ran off-Broadway and at the RSC
in 1986, is about an American writer in self-imposed exile to Latin
America.
   ``Principia'' was better received in London than New York, and
its acclaim prompted the RSC to commission the current play.
   ``The two experiences I've had with the RSC have been the two
best I've ever had with plays of mine,'' said Nelson, who talks in
the same Anglophile terms that he derides in his new play.
   ``The reaction here has been much more generous, much more
understanding,'' he said. ``(My plays) have been critically
perceived and understood and argued about.''
   But Nelson, a Chicago native and Yale Drama School graduate, has
no plans to uproot his family to move to London from their home in
Rhinebeck, N.Y.
   ``I love my country,'' said Nelson. ``I'm American; I love
living in America.''
