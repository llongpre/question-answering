FT  17 FEB 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A lifetime's travel
for a literary type - Lucy Kellaway on a UK publisher's unlikely choice of
sales promotion

What would T S Eliot have made of it? The company that publishes his poem
The Wasteland is trying to boost its sales with the sort of promotion
usually associated with vacuum cleaners and supermarkets.
'A lifetime's free travel - the monthly 'super' draw where no one loses,'
scream the headlines. 'Nine great prizes must be won.' All you need do is
buy one of UK publisher Faber and Faber's slim volumes of poetry or English
literature, and you could win enough money to cruise round the world for the
rest of your days.
The promotion is one of the first of its kind in the publishing industry,
which is only just discovering the marketing gimmicks that other industries
have used for decades. First came promotions for individual authors and
titles, now Faber is taking it one step further by promoting the whole
brand.
The move shows how hard publishers are fighting for market share. 'During
the recession they increased margins by cutting costs, now they are
desperate to build turnover,' says Penny Mountain, deputy editor of The
Bookseller magazine.
Different publishers are going about this in different ways. In the next few
months Penguin and Wordsworth Editions will declare a price war selling
paperback classics for Pounds 1 each.
Faber's move is at the other end of the spectrum: it is throwing money at
its brand to distinguish itself from the pack. The total cost of this
promotion is Pounds 250,000, more than a quarter of the company's pre-tax
profits last year.
According to Joanna Mackle, the scheme's creator, Faber is unusual in having
a clear brand image to promote. Only a few other publishers - Mills and
Boon, Ladybird, Virago and Penguin - are in this position. She says many
readers consciously choose to buy a Faber book. 'We are trying to strengthen
that.'
But even if people do choose books on the basis of who publishes them rather
than who writes them, Faber's choice of promotion could seem curiously
down-market. Mackle says not, pointing out that these prize draws work just
as well for quality British newspapers such as The Times as they do for the
tabloid Sun. And if it means that Faber loses some of its rarefied image,
that is not such a bad thing: 'People can make us appear holier than thou,'
she says.
Up-market or down-market, these promotions appear to be a good way of
selling literature.
Last year Faber launched its first such campaign, which held out the chance
of making one reader a millionaire. Even though the big prize was not won,
Mackle claims the promotion was spectacularly successful, and sold an extra
Pounds 1m of books. The new travel promotion runs for three times as long
and the main prize is worth twice as much again.
Since the beginning of the month, anyone who buys a Faber book is presented
with a travel bond. They could win a weekend on the Continent, a
transatlantic ticket for two, or a lifetime's travel worth more than Pounds
1.5m. There is, however, a 'several hundred to one' chance against the main
prize being won at all. But, just in case it is, Faber has taken out
insurance to cover the cost.
Eliot is most definitely not turning in his grave, says Mackle. As a banker
and a gambler he would surely have approved of the promotion.
