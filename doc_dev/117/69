Birmingham Royal Ballet has begun its new season with the acquisition of two
major works: Ashton's Enigma Variations and Massine's Le Tricorne. This is a
welcome extension of Peter Wright's policy of rescuing important ballets
from repertory oblivion. The recent staging of Choreartium was significant
in reminding audiences of Massine's stature.
There are other Massine works, ballets by Ashton, Tudor, MacMillan, Lichine
 -and how many more - which merit such new life. The Tate Gallery aspect of
such care - 20th century masterpieces kept on show for us - should be a
vital aspect of BRB's identity.
Not surprisingly, Enigma Variations came up very well at Tuesday night's
first performance. The cast understood Ashton's loving homage to Elgar's
world, with its nostalgic haze of golden autumnal light - such days as we
are currently enjoying - warmed by late sun and much emotion. All honour to
Michael Somes, great Ashtonian, who has mounted the ballet impeccably. It is
also a tribute to the exceptional quality of BRB's artists as an ensemble of
dance-actors. Technical style may be sometimes mousey; the playing of roles,
as we see here, is authoritative.
Enigma is, superficially, a series of vignette portraits done by a master -
and assembled by a master into something far greater then its brief parts,
with Ashton, like Elgar, able to evoke a social world and the feelings that
sustain it with subtlest skill. With a couple of exceptions - Troyte like a
man beset by hornets - the portraits are ideally done. I salute Desmond
Kelly's life-like Elgar, true and commanding focus of the action, and the
serene beauty of Sherilyn Kennedy's view of his wife.
The work's emotional heart - the scenes with Alain Dubreuil's sincere,
acutely judged Jaeger - was perfectly shown. Very touching, too, Sandra
Madgwick as a mercurial Dorabella (coached, I'd venture, by Antoinette
Sibley, the enchanting original) and Catherine Batcheller's noble Mary
Lygon. The sense, throughout, is of a ballet honoured because understood.
And I record with pleasure that Leslie Edwards is returned to the role of
Nevinson which he created, and that his precision of playing is as rewarding
as ever.
About Tricorne my feelings are rather mixed. It is important that this
masterpiece be seen, but it is increasingly difficult to find dancers who
look as essentially Spanish and as stylish as Massine's dances demand, and
as the Picasso designs and the de Falla score postulate.
When the piece first came to the Royal repertory in 1947, Massine was on
hand to galvanise the cast, and to show in his own performance the psychic
and physical energies needed. (It was significant that the best interpreter
of the Miller's Wife was the Bolshoi-trained Violetta Elvin, who brought a
blaze of physical beauty and temperament to the dances.)
On Tuesday, BRB's artists had still to come to terms with the piece: there
was more sang-froid than hot blood on view. It is not a polite ballet, not
in theme - sexual jealousy as comedy - nor in step, score or design. It must
have the furia we see with Cumbre Flamenca, controlled but not diminished by
balletic rule.
BRB show it as some sort of Hispanic charade. Joseph Cipolla - who has the
heart of the matter in him - came alive as the Miller when the dramatic
temperature started to rise. Monica Zamora, very lovely, needs a dress, and
emotions, of a deeper shade: let her trust her Spanish blood rather than her
Baron's Court training. The neighbours look extinguished under the marvels
of their costumes, vivid patterns and colours framing bun-faces and a
general air of wishing they were in Frinton rather than Andalucia. (They
should adopt a darker, bolder make-up, and the manner to go with it).
But Tricorne is a masterpiece, worthy of every effort to capture its style.
It must not be neglected, nor allowed to remain in its present deep-frozen
state. It has been revived by Lorca Massine - and what has happened to the
little kite that the Dandy used to fly? - its score, like the Elgar
variations, played with strong theatrical sense by the Royal Ballet Sinfonia
under Barry Wordsworth. The Tricorne production was sponsored by British
Land. The programme was completed by David Bintley's Galanteries.
Birmingham Royal Ballet plays this triple bill again on October 21, 22; then
tours it to Edinburgh, Bradford, Bristol, Plymouth until November 26. Check
local theatres for dates.
