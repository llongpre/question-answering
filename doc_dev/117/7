<HEAD>Actor's Ashes to be Entombed in Westminster Abbey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The ashes of Laurence Olivier will be buried in
Westminster Abbey among monarchs, prime ministers and great artists
of past centuries.
   The Very Rev. Michael Mayne, dean of the church where England's
kings and queens are crowned, said a public memorial service for the
actor would also be held in the abbey this autumn.
   No date for either event was announced, but Mayne said the burial
and placement of a memorial plaque would be some time after the
memorial service.
   Olivier, 82, died July 11.
   Two of the great actors with whom he was frequently compared,
David Garrick and Henry Irving, are buried in the abbey.
   Among other famous tombs in the former monastic church are
Geoffrey Chaucer, author of the ``Canterbury Tales''; the
lexicographer Samuel Johnson; the playwrights Ben Jonson and Richard
Brinsley Sheridan; and poets Robert Browning and Alfred, Lord
Tennyson.
   William Shakespeare is among the artists honored by a monument in
``Poet's Corner,'' but is not buried in the church. Others so
honored include John Milton, William Wordsworth, Charles Dickens,
Thomas Hardy, Jane Austen, T.S. Eliot, and Emily, Anne and Charlotte
Bronte.
