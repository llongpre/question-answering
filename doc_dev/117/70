<HEAD>Two Test-Tube Baby Clinics To Open In Bahrain</HEAD>

   The government will allow two hospitals
to open test-tube baby clinics, but only married couples can take
advantage of the procedure, officials said Sunday.
   In 1985, Saudi Arabia became the first Arab nation to open an
in-vitro fertilization clinic after Moslem theologians ruled the
procedure permissible, provided it involved the sperm and egg of a
married couple.
   The government in Bahrain plans to help establish two clinics
but will ban embryo banks and any fertilizations involving sperm
from anonymous donors.
   Kenneth A. Wordsworth, spokesman for International Hospital of
Bahrain, said officials hope to establish a clinic at the hospital
early next year. A spokesman for the Bahrain Defense Force Hospital
said that it had plans to open a clinic in two months.
   Babies conceived through in-vitro fertilization are commonly
called test-tube babies because the mother's egg is removed from
her body, fertilized in a laboratory dish and then reimplanted in
the womb.
