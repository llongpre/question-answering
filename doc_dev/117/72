FT  05 FEB 92 / Leading Article: Princely capitalism

<TEXT>
THE PRINCE of Wales has undeniably left his mark, for better or worse, on
British architecture. Is he now about to use the luxury of his position as a
potential head of state to do the same for business?
His speech to the grandly named World Economic Forum in Davos yesterday
suggests that he aspires to do so. But capitalism is a tougher nut to crack
than the British architectural profession; and the prince's interpretation
of the business world is sufficiently idiosyncratic to raise a doubt or two
about his prescriptions.
Business, he asserts, is the core of modern society - a statement that might
just make sense of the Japanese social structure, but which seems to bear
little resemblance to anything that is happening in western Europe. And
business, he adds, has been the real victor of the Cold War. If we are to
find solutions to the challenges of the post-Cold War era, runs his
argument, business must work in partnership with governments, local
communities and pretty well everyone else to achieve not only economic, but
spiritual, social and ecological goals.
This is a novel interpretation of post-war history and it incorporates a
monumental non sequitur. There are many businesses in the former Soviet
Union which are not victors of the Cold War and whose problems stem
precisely from working in a collaborative system. It so happened that the
collaborative system was managerially and administratively less efficient
than the more market-oriented systems of the west.
Great irony
That said, the prince's worries about the ability of old-fashioned economic
liberalism to deliver in the late 20th century are not without point. The
great irony of the post-Cold War era is that if the former Soviet Union had
not collapsed we would now be discussing the dismal performance of
capitalism. The debt-laden Anglo-Saxon economies are resisting all attempts
at resuscitation; continental Europe appears to have lost the secret of job
creation; and the Japanese economic miracle has been won at the cost of a
stressfully uneven distribution of wealth. Many share the feeling that
deeper human values have been a casualty of the profit motive.
This is, of course, a rich man's complaint. And it leads the prince to a
curiously eclectic vision in which capitalist animal spirits are
incongruously leavened with nostalgia, social responsibility and something
that verges on natural mysticism. It is a vision whose pedigree runs from
the romanticism of Wordsworth, via the industrial reformism of Dickens's
Hard Times, to the socially conscious profitability of Marks and Spencer. It
may not be full-blooded collectivism (and it is not, alas, in inspired
pentameters) but it is, at the very least, corporatist in spirit.
Comparative advantage
For all that, there is one sense in which the prince may be more in tune
with the modern world than some neo-liberals. Comparative advantage in
today's world has much more to do with the efficient deployment of human
capital than of natural resource endowment. And there is no doubt that some
of the most successful models of economic growth in the Far East are highly
co-operative at company level, even though intense competition prevails
outside. Human capital is sometimes, though not invariably, treated with
greater respect in Japan than in the US or in Britain.
Yet it is hard to move from generalisations about mankind's relationship
with the urban or rural environment to concrete prescriptions about
corporate governance or social and environmental responsibility. And a
belief in 'working together' has to be tempered with the knowledge that
government has all too often proved a poor partner for business working in
the community.
Perhaps as well then that the Prince of Wales yesterday did little more than
urge what many employers would regard as best practice in relations with the
community and on the environment. Take away the mysticism and you have
something slightly woolly, very British and really rather familiar. But not
something likely to generate an economic miracle.
