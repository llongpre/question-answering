   Professor Archie Campbell peers into
the future and sees fish, a thousand tons of the sea's bounty
heaped high on a magic cart gliding effortlessly above the floor.
   Campbell is joking, but he and his colleagues in the new
Research Center in Superconductivity are well aware that the
British government expects some practical, patentable return on its
investment.
   ``We are in a bit of a glass house to see whether we can produce
something of interest to the public, and commercial firms in
particular,'' says Peter Duncumb, the center's director. ``I think
that's all to the good.''
   Cambridge University, whose scientific tradition stretches from
Sir Isaac Newton to Stephen Hawking, author of the contemporary
best seller, ``A Brief History of Time,'' seems the obvious choice
for the government's first venture in interdisciplinary research
centers.
   Appropriately, the center is in the new building of the
Cavendish Laboratory, famous for its pioneering work in splitting
the atom in the 1930s.
   Superconductors have zero-resistance to electric currents and
defy gravity by repelling a magnetic field. But they now work only
at the temperature of liquid nitrogen, about minus 390 degress F,
which limits their potential.
   The elusive room-temperature superconductor conjures up visions
of 2,000-mph trains, smaller and faster computers, electromagnetic
launchers to replace rockets. Visions, too, of bags and bags of
profits.
   The center is the first of nine interdisciplinary research
centers established by the government, with an initial commitment
of $9.3 million for six years.
   ``We're well-funded,'' Campbell says carefully, ``by British
standards.''
   The U.S. government spends about $90 million a year on
superconductivity research, and a White House advisory committee
proposes spending $30 million more.
   Cambridge is sometimes thought of as the scientific half of
Oxbridge, as Britain's two oldest and greatest universities are
often called. But Oxford, 70 miles to the southwest, is also
getting an interdisciplinary research center _ in molecular
sciences _ and Cambridge's literary heritage includes Milton,
Marlowe, Wordsworth and Dryden.
   Government grant reductions which led to Oxford's public appeal
for funds have also been felt in the Cavendish Laboratory.
   ``We have good people, so we can get research grants from the
research councils, but the difficulty today is that the backup in
the case of laboratory space, technician support and general
running costs is no longer adequate,'' says John Deakin, secretary
to the department of physics and the Cavendish Laboratory.
   Technicians, he says, have been lost to better-paid jobs in
private industry in the Cambridge Science Park. Ironically, the
park is run by Trinity College and plows part of its profits back
into the university.
   Denis Noble, professor of cardiovascular physiology at Oxford
and founder of the lobbying group Save British Science, says that
funding is an old problem.
   He cites the case of Charles Babbage, a Cambridge experimenter
in mechanical calculators who lost his government funding in 1842.
   ``The mind boggles to think that Britain might have had an IBM
in the 19th century,'' Nobler says. ``We could have had a world
lead in that area.''
