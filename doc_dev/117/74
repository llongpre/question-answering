Sir Peter Wright's version of The Nutcracker at Covent Garden is a delight.
It is an exemplar of how the old ballets, which are our ancestral jewels,
can be shown off, lovingly and carefully reset, and made to enhance our
dancers.
The secret is that, for once, a producer of the classics has listened to the
score. I am increasingly of the view that some choreographers are deaf, that
others are musically illiterate, and that yet others stick their fingers in
their ears as they enter the rehearsal room. How else to explain the
brutalisms that are inflicted upon the Tchaikovsky scores, and the sheer
bloody-mindedness of the way music, modern and ancient, is maltreated? We
cannot hope for creators as educated and perceptive as Balanchine, who
studied at the Petrograd Conservatoire, but it is a failing in companies
when choreographers are not given guidance with a score. We should be saved
many a chain-saw attack on defenceless composers were there more rigorous
winnowing of musical choices.
Wright has listened to his score, has understood its magic and its
melancholy, and has seen how the overt narrative and the mysterious subtext,
which is Tchaikovsky's vision of childhood, can be made real for us.
Everything works in the staging, and everything persuades us that it is
right. Julia Trevelyan Oman's snowy Nuremburg frames an enchanting
Biedermeier interior, which the Royal Ballet's artists fill with warm,
generous characterisations. Derek Rencher and Sandra Conley preside over the
Christmas party, and they and their guests are winningly shown. The mouse
battle, the Christmas tree's transformation, the haunting figure of
Drosselmeyer (well taken by Stephen Wicks), and the sprightly - but not too
sprightly - cohorts of the Royal Ballet's Junior School, make a spectacle
that combines fun and sudden darker tones that are echt Hoffmann.
The glories of the first act's music - the sublime sweep of Tchaikovsky's
imagination that takes us from the end of the party to the close of the snow
scene - were excitingly clear under Barry Wordsworth's baton on Friday
night, and not one note was betrayed by the staging. I salute the young
Naomi Reynolds as Clara, a delightful child and enchantingly spacious in her
dance with the transformed Nutcracker. And it was very good to see Philip
Mosley again as this hero - youthfully dashing as any little girl could
wish. I salute, indeed, everyone in the first act: they (and Peter Wright)
show us why the score is a masterpiece, and why in Balanchine's words,
'Hoffmann's Nutcracker is a serious thing wrapped in a fairy tale'.
In the second act there must always be problems with those sticky
divertissements. But once we had got through them on Friday, we had Lesley
Collier and Irek Mukhamedov to bring off the great duet with rare authority.
Collier listens to the music: she knows that its sorrows cannot be
expressed, but that to dance it the ballerina must have dignity. Her
performance was wholly apt: subtle in musicianship, pure in statement, with
nothing forced and nothing too beguiling. I have not seen her dance it
better, nor with greater sympathy for its choreographic and emotional tone,
elegiac rather than festive.
I felt happy for the many children in the house; they will have something
very special to remember. They will also have Mukhamedov's noble presence to
recall. The cavalier's part is nothing. Mukhamedov gave it grace of means,
true charm, and very polished dancing.
