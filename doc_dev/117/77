IN NORTH-WEST England house styles are diverse; from the brick houses and
the black and white half-timbered confections of Cheshire, to the rough
stone cottages of the Lake District, there is property to suit all tastes.
The M6 and its connecting motorways hold the region together, making it easy
to travel south or across the Pennines to Yorkshire or further north to
Scotland. Manchester's newly-enlarged airport is another plus for the
region.
For amusement and culture the choice is equally varied; from Blackpool
illuminations to the museums and galleries of Manchester and Liverpool. And
do not miss the treats in smaller civic collections, bought with profits
derived from the heyday of Lancashire's cotton industry.
Sportswise you are spoilt for choice; football, rugby league, cricket at Old
Trafford, the Grand National at Aintree, lake sailing, fell walking, fox
hunting or pony trekking are on offer. That will stimulate your appetite for
a farm tea - or dinner at Sharrow Bay, Ullswater - as you rest your limbs
and dream of Wordsworth, daffodils, Beatrix Potter and Ruskin.
Winter life in the Lake District can be far from a dream. Most cottages and
houses are built low to be out of the wind, the cottages usually dug into
the bank and tucked under the fell. They look idyllic in summer. But winter
means clouds hanging on the hills, and down in the dip no sun for weeks on
end. Can you survive that?
Flash flood becks appear after a downpour and are through the back door
before you can blink. Are you prepared? Before buying, check carefully the
direction the house faces - north may be too gloomy - and find how much
rainfall that particular part of the lake has, as it can vary sharply within
a few miles.
In summer be ready for tourist traffic; cars take maybe 25 minutes to get
through Ambleside. If you still want the lakes and a traditional cottage,
then Side Cottage at Patterdale - Lowther Scott-Harden at around Pounds
190,000 - is a charming example. In the next price band the company offers
the attractive white-painted 19th century Garth House at Skirwith in the
Eden Valley at around Pounds 225,000, and the solidly Victorian Lane Hall at
Weasdale for Pounds 265,000.
Sparket Mill, at Hutton John near Ullswater, a complete water mill with a
kiln for roasting corn that worked until the 1970s (mostly oats for
oatmeal), up to 20 acres, and fishing rights in the beck (trout and
sometimes salmon), is on offer at over Pounds 250,000. It is a surprise that
the agents still suggest that larger houses have a use as country house
hotels, since so many have ended up in receivership.
An alternative might be the use of such homes for extended families. If only
they could manage to unite and move back to use them as they were intended.
But where have all the maiden aunts gone?
Turn-of-the-century Fayrer Holme at Bowness-on-Windermere has 11 bedrooms
(10 with their own bathrooms), and planning permission for a hotel. Cluttons
offers it at around Pounds 695,000, and similarly the Georgian Rusland Hall
near Newby Bridge at Pounds 850,000.
Rusland is where the author Arthur Ransome, of Swallows and Amazons fame, is
buried. More intriguing, and cheaper at Pounds 295,000, is Thackwood Nook
near Carlisle, dating from 1681 and one of the two remaining Red Spear
houses in the country. These were armed manors the local yeomanry held
against border attacks.
In Staffordshire the superb Grade I Elizabethan/Carolean black and white
Broughton Hall that belonged to the Delves Broughton family is now owned by
an order of nuns who have made its 20 bedrooms into 34. Broughton could also
become a hotel. Strutt &amp; Parker offers it at around Pounds 750,000, with a
cottage for about Pounds 125,000 more.
In Cheshire, Pinfold House (in brick) at Marthall comes with masses of
stabling and a handy position for Manchester and the airport. Meller
Braggins offers it with Jackson-Stops for about Pounds 695,000. A cheaper
house with stables is Granary Farm, at Hawarden (Gladstone's country), 10
years old, in traditional style, and with a jacuzzi (Strutt &amp; Parker, around
Pounds 250,000).
More austere than either of these is the imposing Grade II* 17th century
Alvanley Hall near Chester, built of stone to make clear its importance
(Jackson-Stops, around Pounds 250,000).
