   Poet Robert Frost won four Pulitzer
Prizes and the adoration of millions by traveling ``The Road Not
Taken,'' as one of his poems relates.
   But ask a poet or scholar who most influenced poetry in the 20th
century and the likely answer will be William Carlos Williams, a
physician whose clear, modernist cadence broke centuries of
convention.
   ``He was one of my strongest influences,'' said Allen Ginsberg,
the bard of the beat generation. ``He was part of a group that was
the most important thing to happen to American poetry in this
century.''
   In retrospect, Williams _ not Frost _ ``took the one less
traveled by.'' He chose medical school and private practice over
the bohemian life of his contemporaries. Indeed, scholars attribute
Williams' medical training _ his eye for picking details from the
mundane _ with distinguishing him from lesser poets.
   His books of poetry include ``Collected Poems'' and ``Pictures
From Brueghel,'' for which he won a Pulitzer in 1963. He also wrote
critical essays, plays, novels and short stories.
   His verse gained international recognition in 1913 for his
second collection, ``The Tempers.'' His contemporaries _ Gertrude
Stein, Ernest Hemingway and schoolmate Ezra Pound _ fled what they
saw as the oppressive, capitalist climate of early 20th century
America. But Williams chose to remain in the United States. In tiny
Rutherford, a rural town on a knoll rising above the empty New
Jersey meadowlands in view of the growing Manhattan skyline, he
turned his observations of common life into innovations.
   Langdon Hammer, an associate professor of English at Yale
University, said Williams' work elevated American poetry to the
forefront of the modernist movement of the early 20th century,
displacing the more formal British school.
   ``He has a status like that of Yeats or Elliot,'' said Hammer.
   Ginsberg first met Williams while working as a reporter for a
left-wing Paterson, N.J., labor paper.
   ``I cooked up some excuse to interview him because I had heard
him recite at the Museum of Modern Art,'' Ginsberg said. ``It
opened my eyes immediately. His poetry was simply an intensified
form of speech.''
   Ginsberg recalled sending Williams a letter with some poems
after the interview. The doctor sent them back, telling him to go
back to his notes to find the raw versions _ the less refined, more
natural drafts.
   Not long afterward, in 1957, Ginsberg published his classic
poem, ``Howl.''
   Williams lived in Rutherford from his birth in 1883 until his
death in 1963, treating the poor and middle-class families of
surrounding towns and the gritty mill city of Paterson about 10
miles to the north. The city would be the subject of the
five-volume epic poem ``Paterson,'' written between 1946 and 1958.
   Williams also left his mark on medicine, eventually becoming
chief of staff at Passaic General Hospital and a recognized pioneer
in pediatrics, one of the first doctors to make it his specialty.
   His son, Dr. William Eric Williams, lives and practices medicine
in the same home his grandparents purchased in the late 1880s.
Dealing with the legacy of his father, spending endless hours with
English professors and biographers, and answering the same
questions from journalists time and again, has taken a lot out of
him, he says.
   ``For 75 years I've been communicating with artists, scholars,
reporters and writers about my father,'' he said in a brief
interview. ``I can't get my own work done and I've just had to stop
giving my time away.''
   But surprisingly, in a state where the ultimate tribute may be
getting one's name on a New Jersey Turnpike reststop, Williams'
reputation has remained obscure beyond scholars and other poets.
   ``It's almost like we haven't figured out what place he holds in
our history,'' said John Dollar, a retired Fairleigh Dickinson
University professor who used to read to Williams after the poet's
vision was impaired by a stroke in the late 1950s.
   In the Rutherford Public Library, Williams' books, photographs
and paintings clutter a tiny room dedicated to the poet, but it is
locked and dark most of the time.
   Dollar and a handful of other former acquaintances and fans help
gather artifacts from the poet's life. ``We don't know quite what
to do with this room,'' Dollar said. ``I'm afraid its fallen into
disarray.''
   Williams' greatest talent was his ability to draw meaning from
common things, scholars say. Pound wrote him many times imploring
him to leave Rutherford for Europe.
   Composition on a typewriter _ considered an eccentricity and
even reviled by some critics at the time _ cultivated in Williams
an interest in the physical shape of the verse as well as its sound
and message.
   If Rutherford's image of the poet-doctor remains ill-defined,
his memory lives on in the William Carlos Williams Center for
Performing Arts, opened a decade ago in the abandoned Tivoli
Theatre building. But the man who worked so hard for the poor and
infirm has won little wide acclaim.
   ``They never understood him really,'' said Dollar. ``I believe
it was one of the things that truly bothered him. The (Fairleigh
Dickinson) University never gave him an honorary degree, although
he spoke there often. They never recognized what they had right
under their noses.''
