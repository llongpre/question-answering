NOT BECAUSE it was a quarter of a century ago, simply as an interesting
year, Radio 3 offers a 1968 Season for a week or two. Myself, I enjoyed
1968. I went to the theatre 208 times, I spent ten days in Venice, I heard
Gwyneth Jones as Sieglinde in Die Walkure; but in retrospect I think
everyone, even me, took things too seriously, as Radio 3 does now. In That
Was the Year, That Was, Alan Bennett recalled his happy times with John
Gielgud in Forty Years On; Jonathan Miller regretted not having pursued his
neuropsychology and insisted that his televised Alice in Wonderland was
Wordsworthian rather than satirical; Peter Hall recalled his move from the
Royal Shakespeare Company to the not-yet-royal National; Michael Frayn began
writing novels because he had no more to say in his newspaper column.
Nothing significant, unless you count Peter Hall. Comparatively few of the
items seem actually to have happened in 1968, anyway. Of Hits of 1968, only
'The Age of Aquarius' meant anything to me, and that not much.
Peter Barnes's The Ruling Class is the first of four 1968 plays to be
revived. In Nottingham that year, it ran nearly three-and-a-half hours, but
when it reached the West End (in 1969) it had lost 20 minutes, and Radio 3
plays it in two hours and 20 minutes, a real improvement, though there is
still much dispensable frivolity. Lunatic Jack (versatile Simon Callow)
succeeds as 14th Earl of Gurney, believing that he is Jesus Christ, married
to Marguerite Gautier. A German psychiatrist 'cures' him by confrontation
with a rival God, so instead of the loving New Testament Deity, Jack now
becomes the vengeful Old Testament God. Moreover, being Jack, he is also
Jack the Ripper. This is how he is to take his seat in the Lords. No one but
a few Oxford students could have thought that hereditary peers, mad or sane,
were vital in the government of the country, but there is some fun. Gerry
Jones directed.
I am conscious of devoting too little space to Radio 5, so here are some
notes on three series that began this week, no candidates for historical
importance. On Monday we enter Mark Davies Markham's The Mall, a new
shopping centre. All the population sound like teenagers, even when they are
a bit over. Jonathan is sacked for stealing just before the opening, so he
and Mickey break in and bust it up. There are to be 14 parts, so we may hope
for high adventure.
Hatches, Matches and Despatches on Tuesdays is lightweight education. This
week was Hatches, a fascinating array of customs, superstitions, folklore
and general knowledge connected with the birth of children, not only in
Britain but among the Sikhs, Hindus, Moslems, Chinese and others. John
Walters was the presenter.
On Thursday we had the first of seven stories about The Green Hornet, a a
respectable newspaperman until there is a matter that he must put right, and
for this he dons a sinister disguise. The series was first heard in 1936 on
Detroit Radio and played for 16 years thereafter. This week we had the
dishonest exploitation of a charity, and as it began with one of the
directors handing over a bunch of signed blank cheques to his colleague,
dishonesty was no surprise.
Once again we find radio supplanting the magazines. The equivalent of this
kind of material might have been found in Chums or The Modern Boy, though I
do not think they would have used delinquency so blithely for entertainment.
Not that Jonathan or the dishonest charity is defended, but the existence of
such behaviour is taken for granted - and so it should be. Why not contrive
an exciting serial about car joy-riders who all end up reformed? If radio is
an influence at all, on Radio 5 it is for good.
