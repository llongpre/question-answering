Peter Wright has for some years hoped to present a staging of MacMillan's
Romeo and Juliet for his section of the Royal Ballet. The move to
Birmingham, which brought increased forces and stage potential, made this
hope a fact, and on Monday night Birmingham Royal Ballet showed us their own
Romeo. And perhaps because BRB is, in essence, an ensemble young in spirit
as in personnel, Sir Kenneth MacMillan has chosen a young talent to decorate
the production.
Last year he saw the graduate show of the Wimbledon College of Art stage
design course, and was impressed by the work of Paul Andrews. So, at the age
of 22, Mr Andrews found himself entrusted with a three act ballet as his
first professional commission. The decision was bold, but it has produced
decoration which has an enthusiasm, a freshness of eye, that accord very
well with this tragedy of youthful passion performed by a youthful company.
Mr Andrews has inevitably had to accommodate the shape of his set to
existing choreographic outlines. His basic structure, of a curved and tiered
colonnade broken by a central stair, is handsome, and the stage space is
varied - for Juliet's bedroom; for the Capulet tomb - to provide a more
intimate, rectangular dance area. The decoration pays its historical dues to
quattrocento and cinquecento painting and architecture in shapes and colour.
It is an incidental pleasure that at moments one may recognise Mantegna or
Uccello, and Mr Andrews' own sense of delight in renaissance Italy is
communicated to performers and audience without undue fuss. Design is not
flawless - I find Escalus' glittering gold armour altogether too bright, and
the bushy page-boy wigs for Romeo and his chums help extinguish their
characters - but it is a brave and stimulating view of the drama, and it is
superlatively lit by Hans-Ake Sjoquist, who enhances every moment of the
action.
Monday night's premiere was intended to feature the Moscow guests Nina
Ananiashvili and Alexey Fadeyechev, both experienced MacMillan interpreters
after their success in Prince of the Pagodas. Unhappily, Fadeyechev has
sustained a knee injury, and Kevin O'Hare who replaced him, though
conscientious in everything, could not provide all the emotional and
physical rapport demanded by Ananiashvili's gifts. She is one of nature's
Juliets. The role is often played in terms of innocence awakening to a first
passion. With Ananiashvili there is the added fascination of seeing a
ballerina 'as' Juliet. The power and the savour of the interpretation lie in
the reconciliation of a child's grace with the authority of the superlative
classical artist. (Plisetskaya's ardent Juliet was just such a reading).
In the first act, Ananiashvili played sweetly to O'Hare's innocent Romeo,
the balcony scene exquisitely done. It was in the third act - which is
Juliet's alone - that she revealed her command of the role. As Romeo leaves
her bedroom, she stands as if stunned, lost in dreams; sitting for an
eternity on the bed, we see her draw courage from her feelings as her body
becomes erect; the run to Friar Laurence has an irresistible momentum (and
was superlatively lit by Mr Sjoquist); facing to her parents' anger, she
bows in acquiescence, then eddies away from them (and from her plight) in an
exquisite pas de bourree that speaks of her innermost feelings. It is
Ananiashvili's sensitivity to MacMillan's physical truths, and the refined
utterance she gives them, that make this so beautiful and honest a reading,
and one so grandly that of a ballerina.
Like O'Hare's Romeo, company performances are as yet mostly promising
sketches. Ensembles are full of vitality, albeit certain scenes seem
diffuse. The pacing and weighting of effects will come with experience, but
the production already represents a major achievement by the Birmingham
troupe. I salute Anita Landa's Nurse, a lovingly judged portrait, and the
clean dancing by the ensemble.
From Barry Wordsworth and the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, an account of
Prokofev's score that was vivid in colour, purposeful in drama.
Romeo and Juliet continues at the Hippodrome, Birmingham, until June 6;
thereafter it can be seen at the Apollo, Oxford, June 29, 30 and July 1; and
then in Southampton and Bristol.
