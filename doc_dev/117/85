<HEAD>Three Leftists To Stand Trial For Plotting To Overthrow Government</HEAD>

   Three militants of the Marxist
opposition party will stand trial in October for allegedly plotting
a coup earlier this year.
   Senior High Court Magistrate Ramraj Jagnandan ruled Tuesday night
that the three farmers from the country's eastern district of
Demerara conspired to overthrow the government of President Desmond
Hoyte by force.
   The announcement came after six weeks of hearings in which
defense lawyers and the prosecution debated the admissibility of
confession statements allegedly made by Bhokpertap Singh, Karran
Persaud Deokarran and Neville Wordsworth.
   The defense alleged police had kidnapped the men from their homes
in May, tortured them for a week, forced them to confess, then
announced their detention publicly.
   The confession statements were accepted by the court, a decision
criticized from opposition parties.
   The three militants of the Marxist People's Progressive Party are
in prison awaiting trial.
   The government's case rests on allegations that the men conspired
with others to train people to make explosives and use firearms.
   Their arrest in May came just a few days after Hoyte warned of a
plot to topple his government. His People's National Congress has
ruled this South American nation since independence from Britain in
1966. The opposition has regularly accused it of rigging elections.
   In April and May, Guyana was rocked by a six-week strike, food
riots and arson attacks on public buildings. The unrest was
triggered by government austerity measures, including a devaluation
of the Guyana dollar, which prompted a 300 percent increase in food
prices.
