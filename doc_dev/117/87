BY 1802, the year in which Wordsworth wrote his great 'Ode on the
Intimations of Immortality', the notion that children were a unique species
deserving of attention in their own right, and not merely dwarfish
adults-in-the-making, was already in popular currency. And what better as a
means of educating this species than books with pictures in them?
The publishing of childrens' books with accompanying illustrations began in
earnest in the 1840s and accelerated as the 19th century moved towards its
close. Sophisticated methods of using engravings beside printed text were
invented and refined; and the middle decades of the century saw the
appearance of three great talents who were to revolutionise the world of
illustrated childrens' books: Hans Hoffman in Germany, whose Struwelpeter of
1845, a ferocious tale originally devised for some hapless, cowering
three-year-old, was rapidly translated into many other European languages,
including English; Edward Lear, that morose painter of bird-life, whose
nonsense rhymes were first published in 1846; and the Rev Charles Dodgson
(better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll), the Oxford logician, whose
partnership with the successful professional caricaturist (of Punch), John
Tenniel, was to produce perhaps the greatest illustrated childrens' classic
of all time, Alice in Wonderland. And then, as the capacity to print in
colour developed, other great names appeared: Caldecott, Crane and Potter,
for example.
Some of the finest achievements in childrens' book illustration, spanning
the period from 1840 to the present day, are on display at the National
Gallery of Scotland until the end of December and they demonstrate how
haphazard the process of writing and publishing books for this untested
market must have been. So much seems to have depended upon relationships
between illustrators and particular children, for example. Beatrix Potter's
earliest tales developed out of her habit of writing letters to child
friends, in which she would describe the antics of her own pet rabbits, with
appropriate doodles in the margins. The Tale of Peter Rabbit was rejected by
publishers so many times that she decided to produce it at her own expense
in 1901, with a single black-and-white illustration as frontispiece. After
its appearance, Macmillan offered to publish the book with colour
illustrations and Potter was able to take advantage of the recent discovery
of the 3-colour printing process to achieve the harmonious greens and browns
of her now-so-familiar garden settings.
The exhibition shows her studies of rabbits, minutely observed, and a
watercolour of that garden in Wales where so many of the early stories were
set. All this preliminary work demonstrates a remarkable capacity for
prolonged and detailed academic preparation.
Lewis Carroll, too, was a great perfectionist - and he, too, paid for the
publication of the first edition of Alice in 1865, though Macmillan
distributed it. His relationship with the equally pedantic Tenniel (some of
whose Alice engravings are on display in the exhibition) was a stormy one,
the artist on one occasion flatly refusing to illustrate 'a wasp in a wig'.
Carroll withdrew the chapter altogether.
The exhibition also enables us to compare how different illustrators have
interpreted the same text - Stevenson's Treasure Island, for example. Ralph
Steadman's remarkable depiction of Long John Silver in a tavern, surrounded
by carousing piratical types, is full of violence and blood-lust; little, if
anything, remains of Stevenson's description of Silver as a 'clean and
pleasant-tempered landlord.'
Mervyn Peake's wonderful pen-and-ink illustration of Billy Bones, which
appeared in an edition of 1949, strips Bones back to his meanest essentials,
grotesquely simplifying the features to such an extent that the character
looks positively haunted by the evil in his heart. For every illustrator, it
seems, there is a new Stevenson to be discovered.
The exhibition's greatest and most pleasurable surprise is Randolph
Caldecott, clerk by profession, whose marvellous watercolours of frogs and
mice in motion, skipping and leaping about, or at supper, looking like
bloated bon viveurs in their ridiculous 18th century costumes, accompanied
his 'Toy Books' of the 1880s.
Caldecott is scarcely in print these days and certainly not in editions that
show his achievements off to any advantage; and that is a tragedy because,
from the evidence available in this exhibition, he was perhaps the most
influential illustrator of the 19th century. And evidence of that enduring
influence is to be found in almost every new picture book for children
involving anthropomorphised animals on the run.
Once Upon A Time, an exhibition of children's bookillustrations, is on
display at the National Gallery of Scotland, The Mound, Edinburgh, until
December 27
