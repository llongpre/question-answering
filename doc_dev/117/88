Useful idea the holiday. Helps you put things in perspective. Beautiful
Umbrian hillside, nice old farmhouse. Why not read David Copperfield? Bit
long: 836 pages in the excellent Pounds 1 Wordsworth edition. But it's a
treat. A joy. I had forgotten that although Dickens was a barnstormer and a
sentimentalist, he was, first, a master of character and narrative, and set
out to give his readers enjoyment. His books still do.
We are told Dickens would have been at home in the television age because,
like so much fiction on television, his work is episodic, having been
written as part-works for monthly publication. There is probably less to
this than meets the eye. The question I bring back to the old green sofa in
London is simple: although I spend much of my time defending television and
arguing that, as in most other aspects of life, the best is very good, do I
ever get as much pleasure from it as I get from reading David Copperfield?
The answer after one week back in front of the screen is a qualified no.
The first programme I see is a new comedy series called Once Upon A Time In
The North. BBC1 seems to have invented it to show that Bernard Hill, flavour
of the decade, who has done everything else from Yosser to a police chief,
can also turn his hand to comedy. Well, yes, it seems he can, but is that
surprising when the material is as undemanding as this? Hill is saddled with
that standard comedy figure in the age of feminism: the useless
paterfamilias. Out of work, unable to do even the smallest thing (putting a
message on an answerphone) correctly, he is treated with contempt by
everyone from wife to youngest child. This might have seemed novel, shocking
and funny in, say, 1850 when patriarchy was still the norm, but in 1994? It
is time British comedy writers caught up with their American cousins who
moved into the post-feminist age four or five years ago. I itch to get back
to David Copperfield.
Instead I watch The Lifeboat, an episodic drama (BBC1 again) featuring a
group of characters brought together by the dangers of the sea. But where in
this soggy, soapy story of darts and extra marital sex is there a single
character as memorable as Copperfield, Steerforth, Traddles, Betsey
Trotwood, Uriah Heep, Agnes Wickfield, Peggotty, Ham, Little Em'ly, Dora,
Rosa Dartle, or Doctor Strong? You could list a dozen more: even minor
Dickens characters such as Barkis the carrier, and Creakle, the
Chenevix-Trench of his day, have more life in them, more vividness, than the
entire cast of The Lifeboat. Good grief, Jip the dog is more memorable than
the characters in most of last week's television dramas.
There was one programme which did have something of Dickens' power to evoke
the very smell of its milieu. Family (yet another from BBC1) on Sunday, the
first in a four-part drama written specifically for television by Roddy
Doyle, author of The Commitments and The Snapper, reeked of Dublin. Its
portrayal of Charlo, the violent, thieving, lying, brawling, unfaithful,
unemployed paterfamilias, was very powerful. Indeed, even after all these
years of working class realism in television drama, Doyle - and superb
acting from Sean McGinley - made this a truly shocking portrait.
The trouble lay in the bleakness. Though Doyle has shown us brutishness
before, there have always been redeeming moments, but the opening episode of
Family lacked even a hint of redemption. However much one may admire the
professionalism of the production, that makes enjoyment difficult. Dickens
painted some grim pictures, but his canvases were so broad, covering the
whole of society, that it was almost impossible for the gloom to be
unrelieved. In this, television is at a terrible disadvantage, being such a
desperately literal medium. While print can leap in one sentence from the
real to the imagined, from the literal to the metaphorical, from the inside
of someone's head to the outside of the stagecoach in which he rides,
television's cameras have a terrible tendency to bind you to the actual.
Perhaps that is why the most vivid and engrossing drama of the television
week was not fictional but factual. Watergate, the first in a five-part
series of BBC2 documentaries, began to re-tell the story of how men employed
by the late Richard Nixon broke into the offices of his political opponents
and, crucially, how Nixon and his cronies then plotted to cover this up.
One of the difficulties is that although producers Norma Percy, Mick Gold
and Paul Mitchell are doubtless so familiar with every nook and cranny of
the story that they cheered at every new morsel they unearthed, most of us,
as non-experts, feel we have heard it all before.
However, this does not matter because here, at last, television comes up
with a truly Dickensian cast and the sort of narrative drive that would have
made the old boy beam with pleasure. What writer of fiction would dare have
Jeb Magruder deliver his reminiscences while dressed as a priest? And follow
that with a performance from Gordon Liddy - seemingly in front of a table
spread with hand guns - which makes Micawber seem quiet and retiring?
Having roped in just about everybody who played any part (as with her
outstanding series The Second Russian Revolution) Norma Percy has once again
made the process of telling true stories on television look easy. Yet when
you think of the interviewing and then the editing which must have gone into
this apparently seamless narrative, with John Dean picking up from Haldeman,
or Ehrlichman seeming to take his cue from Alexander Haig, you realise that
this is the art that conceals art.
As a collector of eccentrics and one-time political reporter, Dickens would
have loved it.
