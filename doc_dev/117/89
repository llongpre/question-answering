   On the killing fields of Vietnam, residue of the 10-year war has
been mostly bulldozed away, except for an occasional spent shell or
a rusted mess kit stuck in the red dirt.
   But back home in America, a spate of new books and films has
kept memories of the divisive war very much alive.
   Like the men they portray, books about the Vietnam War, fiction
or non-fiction, had a tough time being accepted after Saigon fell
to the communists. Now 15 years later they pour from the presses by
the hundreds.
   Through them a new generation relives the horrors of the battles
at places like the Rock Pile, Dak To, Hamburger Hill, Khe Sanh and
Nui Lon Mountain.
   It was on April 30, 1975, that South Vietnam fell, ending a war
in which nearly 3 million Americans fought and 58,000 died.
   In the late 1970s, an older generation of award-winning books
about Vietnam came along. They included Michael Herr's
``Dispatches,'' Tim O'Brien's ``Going After Cacciato,'' Robert
Stone's ``Dog Soldiers'' and Philip Caputo's ``A Rumor of War,''
which like some others was initially rejected before being
published in 1977.
   But it wasn't until the 1980s that Vietnam became a popular
subject for books and movies. The dedication of the Vietnam
Memorial in Washington brought a new respectability to veterans,
and a new look at the war.
   Tom Hebert, a veteran who runs the mail-order Vietnam Bookstore
from his home in Burlington, Conn., estimates more than 500 books
about the Vietnam War have been published since 1982. His best
sellers from the '80s include John DelVecchio's ``The 13th
Valley,'' Robert Mason's ``Chickenhawk'' and Neil Sheehan's ``A
Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam.''
   The passing of time also has brought a breakthrough in movies.
   After 10 years of trying, a twice-wounded Vietnam veteran,
Oliver Stone, brought to the screen ``Platoon,'' the 1987 Academy
Award-winning movie that is a semi-autobiographical account of his
tour.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' based on paraplegic Ron Kovic's
1976 autobiography of patriotism, anger, guilt and disillusionment
in the aftermath of war, was nominated for eight Academy Awards
this year.
   ``The experience of war is still inherently so mysterious and
fascinating that we just can't seem to examine enough of it,'' says
Michael Norman, a radioman who wrote ``These Good Men,'' one of a
recent outpouring of powerful personal accounts of the savagery of
the war and a search for its meaning.
   ``For the men who fought who want to turn war into art, you got
to let some time pass,'' says Norman. ``Wordsworth was right. Art
is emotion recollected in tranquillity. You can't be tranquil about
the war until you let a decent amount of time pass and you think
about it.''
   Norman traced the lives of 11 comrades with whom he had survived
the ``brutal, obscene'' war in an odyssey that took him 50,000
miles in search of what it all meant and what they had become.
   The realization came to him 16 years later that these men acted
at their very best even though he feels sending them to Vietnam in
the cause of democracy turned out to be a lie.
   ``There is no sense to Vietnam when one is sober,'' Rod Kane
writes in ``Veterans's Day,'' another recent book. His service as a
medic was like being on a car that was out of control, he says.
After a while, Vietnam was out of control. Watching his friends die
turned Kane into a drunk until he sobered up eight years ago.
   The new books are filled with metaphors of the senselessness of
the war, of American blood spilled in assaults against meaningless
hills and mountaintops of no strategic value.
   News correspondents who were there recall hills like 875 and
1338 that towered thousands of feet above the Dak To Valley and
claimed 1,300 American soldiers. Scores of wounded had lain on the
hillside for more than two days in great pain before a relief
column broke through to rescue them.
   ``I have always preached a lot about hell but I had never seen
it until the last three days,'' the brigade chaplain was moved to
say.
   Many of the American paratroopers at Hamburger Hill had a
premonition they were going to die but they were unable to do
anything about it. For eight days, the paratroopers assaulted the
hill at the cost of 46 men killed and 300 wounded.
