the list

The list of England's top schools produced by the government's examination
performance tables has a familiar look about it.
Selective independent schools dominate, with only four state schools in the
top 50 when judged by A-levels - all four long-established grammar schools
with a history of independence and which have opted out of local authority
control.
Virtually all are in urban areas, which provide a large pool of academically
able children, and their sixth forms are small compared with the sixth-form
and further education colleges where most English students now take
A-levels.
Most exceptions to these general rules have strong inbuilt advantages. For
example the only top 50 school with more than 200 A-level candidates was
Eton College, arguably the most famous and prestigious boarding school in
England. Manchester Grammar, the next biggest, has a similarly formidable
reputation.
Two other schools named in the Clarendon report at the end of the last
century - Westminster and St Paul's, both in London - finished ahead of
Eton.
Less privileged schools which managed a strong result include The Grange,
Northwich, founded as a grammar school in 1978, and York College for Girls,
an Anglican foundation which this year entered only 16 pupils for A-level
and plans to amalgamate with a local Quaker school.
The top performers, as last year, are the King Edward's and King Edward VI
High Schools, independent schools on adjoining sites near Birmingham
university.
Both are highly selective and financially well-resourced, having raised
money from corporate sponsors for capital projects such as a new
craft-teaching block. They also make maximum use of the assisted places
scheme - attacked at the weekend by the Labour party - which provides state
aid to help families on low incomes to pay fees.
Similar criteria are at work at GCSE level, although the government figures
do not differentiate sufficiently to draw strong conclusions. Of the 97
schools listed by the Department for Education as achieving five GCSE passes
of at least grade C for all their pupils, only 17 are in the state sector.
Again, most serve affluent or big urban catchment areas.
They are: Kendrick Girls' Grammar, Reading; King Edward VI Camp Hill and
King Edward VI Handsworth, Birmingham; Newstead Wood School, Orpington;
Aylesbury High School; Pate's Grammar School, Cheltenham; Dartford and
Rochester Girls' Grammar Schools, Kent; Clitheroe Royal Grammar School,
Lancashire; Skegness Grammar School, Lincolnshire; Woodford County High,
London; Newport Girls' High, Shropshire; Altrincham Grammar, Cheshire; Queen
Mary's Grammar, Walsall; King Edward VI Grammar, Stratford-upon-Avon; Bishop
Wordsworth's, Salisbury; and Wolverhampton Girls' High School.
Only five of these are still maintained by their local education authority.
But many of the schools which have opted out of local control had a
tradition of independence before they joined their local authority, so these
figures do not necessarily point to improved academic success once schools
opt out.
