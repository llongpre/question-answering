   The United States has no immediate plans to
send a U.S. peacekeeping force to Liberia as requested by officials
of the West African nation besieged by civil war, the State
Department said Friday.
   ``Our policy is to continue to urge both sides to participate in
negotiations to prevent the further loss of life,'' spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler told reporters.
   The United States, she said, strongly supports negotiations
aimed at a cease-fire and international peacekeeping force by the
Economic Community of West African States and ``regrets that the
talks have broken down,'' she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler confirmed that President Bush had received an
appeal from Foreign Minister J. Rudolph Johnson, Washington
ambassador Eugenia Wordsworth-Stevenson and eight other prominent
Liberians for a temporary U.S. force to prevent bloodshed until
international peacekeeping machinery is set up.
   Most Liberians would welcome U.S. help in ``averting massive
plunder and tribal revenge'' and in having President Samuel Doe
evacuated from the country, said one of the Liberian signers,
former U.N. Ambassador Winston Tubman.
   They letter said Doe's ``resignation and departure from Liberia
... and the establishment of an interim government'' was expected
soon.
   Rebels on Friday overran most of northern Monrovia, the capital
city, pushing several hundred remaining government troops into a
narrow strip of land on both sides of Doe's executive mansion.
   Witnesses reported many government casualties, and shipping
sources said two Liberian coast guard cutters were sunk in the port
by gunfire.
   U.S. warships with Marine units aboard were moved close to
Liberia several weeks ago.
   The African nation, founded by freed American slaves 150 years
ago, has traditionally had close ties with the United States.
