A HISTORY OF WALES
by John Davies
Allen Lane Pounds 30, 718 pages
IT IS A conspicuous phenomenon. The histories of Ireland, Scotland, Ulster
and Wales have all now been vigorously established. But writing the history
of England is no longer a la mode. No better index of this is the news that
the Pelican History of England, staunch vade-mecum of the sixth-form swot,
is to be replaced by a Pelican History of Britain and, what is more, that it
is to be written largely by transatlantic authorities.
To anyone who has ever been in the 'Celtic fringe' long enough to know that
it is not a fringe but its own domain of self-defined activity, this comes
as no surprise. The English have got their come-uppance. For years, the
English have bullishly regarded British history as English history. Never
mind 1066 and All That: what do the English know of 1536, 1707 and 1800?
These are dates which still rankle with the Welsh, the Scots and the Irish,
for they mark the extension of English sovereignty throughout the British
Isles; but up until recently, very little English historical attention has
been focused on those Acts of Union, and the residual fragility of that
nationhood which we call 'British'. The Maastricht debate has been useful in
this respect: it has shown just how few of our parliamentarians (especially
the 'patriotic' among them) have any understanding of how weak and cosmetic
are the bonds which hold 'Britain' together.
Against this background, John Davies' History of Wales makes a timely
appearance. The value of the book is attested by its own history.
Commissioned by Penguin to come out in Welsh, it materialised so large that
a paperback was impossible, but Allen Lane issued Hanes Cymru in 1990 never
the less.
The Welsh original had an almost totemic force, whatever its contents: I
well remember with what pride it was displayed in the dingy windows of sub
Post Offices in minor mid-Welsh market towns. And now Davies has turned his
Welsh text into English, bringing it to the wider readership it much
deserves.
There is always a danger that these nationalistic histories will be quaint.
And indeed, some aspects of Welsh nationalism are quaint: anti-English
sentiment is always framed in Welsh as anti-Saxon, and assumes a purity of
English culture that really no longer exists (in many 'English' towns
Punjabi must be almost as much used as English). It may be that English
nationalistic history is no longer possible precisely because England is now
much more of a multi-cultural society than Wales, Scotland or Ireland.
Although Davies is palpably passionate about Wales as a nation, and a nation
with a future as well as a past, he manages to keep his narrative free of
whimsy. His agenda is straightforward: he has to show how 'Wales' and 'the
Welsh' have survived as significant terms despite the fact that since 1536
(if not earlier, effectively) the country and its people have been treated
as a part - or worse, an appendage - of England.
The survival is remarkable. So many factors could be hypothetically invoked
as reasons for the eclipse of Wales. The lack of its own political
institutions; the lack (still felt) of a decent infrastructure; the lack,
until 1955, of a capital city; the difficult terrain; and so on. Yet the
eclipse never happened. The defiance of Wales is not overtly explained here,
but we can see for ourselves how it was nourished.
Davies engages with all types of history - economic, social, religious, even
archaeology - but wherever he is he has an eye for the prime medium of
communication. From the bards who delighted the warlords of the 14th century
to the prodigious pamphleteering of evangelist dissenters in the eighteenth,
and Radio Cymru in the 20th, the Welsh have communicated to each other in
their own language.
And it is no exaggeration to say that the language has preserved the
nationality of Wales. There may never have been a Wordsworth of the Valleys,
but lyrical ballads circulate in Wales as they no longer do elsewhere.( To
see a child of six stand before an audience of thousands, take a single note
from a harp, and then deliver a song in perfect pitch, is extraordinary to
outsiders attending an eisteddfod, but natural to this country). It is clear
that the centre of gravity for Wales resides, as it always has done, in the
language: and it was Matthew Arnold's big mistake, when he was Inspector of
Schools, to suppose that you could keep 'Welsh culture' without its own
linguistic base.
A cultural centre of gravity does not, of course, imply absolute cohesion.
There are two distinct facets to Welsh history: one is the Celtic, the other
(to borrow an Arnoldism) the Hebraic - by which I mean the tea-urn culture
of Dissent and Nonconformity. Bingeing versus temperance, poets versus
preachers, warriors versus pacificists: following the interaction of the
Celtic and Hebraic throughout this book is perhaps the most satisfying part
of it. But whether it is for hell-fire or lechery, the language has been one
and the same: which is why it is entirely right, and an act of enlightenment
from Penguin that A History of Wales comes after, not before, Hanes Cymru.
