Just over 25 years on, John Osborne has done it again. Dejavu is not Look
Back in Anger, but it has every claim to become the most talked about play
in London. The only reservation apart from the length - a good three hours -
and the uncertainty about how to bring it to an end is whether you need to
know the earlier piece in order to enjoy the latter. My guess is that Dejavu
just about stands in its own right.
Osborne has forgotten nothing since the height of his powers. A quarter of a
century later, Jimmy Porter and Cliff are still there, relatively affluent
and with Jimmy tending to be known as JP. But instead of Alison, Jimmy's
wife, there is now Alison, his daughter, and instead of Helena, his wife's
friend, there is now Helena, the friend of his daughter. The rest of the
plot is much the same, right down to the use of the ironing board and the
switch of allegiance.
Apart from the sheer pleasure of seeing Look Back revisited, there are two
fundamental reasons why this production by Tony Palmer works so well. One is
that Osborne at his best is such a brilliant stage-writer: the words and the
allusions come tumbling out, joke after joke. The other is that this Jimmy
Porter - the ageing John Osborne in all but name - is played by the youngish
actor, Peter Egan.
This is crucial to the success. It means that even when JP is at his most
cantankerous and bilious, he still has a youthful charm. The danger of
playing him like a stereotype - angry young man turned reactionary fogey -
has been avoided. Although Egan appears to get through enormous quantities
of red wine and champagne in the course of the show, it never seems that it
is wholly the drink that is talking. This is Porter Senior reflecting on
Porter Junior: curiously enough he tends to the conclusion that the
generation of the 1950s had it better.
Jimmy looks younger than Cliff (Gareth Thomas), as perhaps he always was at
heart. What they still have in common, however, is the ability to turn on a
double act. The two man cabaret show is at the heart of their performance.
Where Osborne scores, just as he did in Look Back and also in The
Entertainer, is in mixing the corniest of old music hall jokes with the most
literary.
Some of the awfullest old lines are repeated, like 'my feet hurt' - 'why not
try washing your socks?' Then we are off with 'Auntie Wordsworth'. Osborne's
language is steeped in Shakespeare. Remember that team of comics, Jock and
Day, who stood tiptoe on the misty mountain top? This mock-literary stuff is
the preferred home of Jimmy and Cliff. They were, as one of them says in
Dejavu, camp before anyone knew what it meant.
There are also the Osborne swipes at fashionable trends. JP has become a
wine snob, and uses the language to dismiss the Nicaragua '89. In the
Osborne world there is now an A level in joined-up writing; for GCSEs you do
Elton John since nobody has heard of TS Eliot. The local shopping precinct
is called after Winnie Mandela. But the style is not repetitive because the
jokes are so infinitely varied.
There is a lot more besides. The Sunday papers are back: Osborne claims not
unfairly to have invented the category 'posh'. The bears and squirrels of
Look Back now appear regularly in the Valentine's Day messages in The Times.
If the earlier work was seminal, this is an essential catch-up.
