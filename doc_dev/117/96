The time was the summer of 1816; the place, the Villa Diodati on the shores of 
Lake Geneva; the characters and plot so rife with Gothic-Romantic potential as 
to inspire -- as it did, alas -- a Ken Russell film. 
</P>
<P>
Here George Gordon, Lord Byron, already renowned and notorious for his poems 
and his shocking conduct (a true celebrity also in the curiously modern sense 
of being famous for being famous), fled in the wake of a scandalous separation 
from his wife. Accompanied by his young physician/traveling companion John 
William Polidori, Byron met up with Percy Bysshe Shelley, Shelley's mistress 
and soon-to-be-wife Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, and Mary's stepsister Claire 
Clairmont. The teen-aged Claire, an early version of the modern groupie, had 
met -- and thrown herself at -- Byron in London in the spring of that year. By 
the summer she was pregnant with his child. 
</P>
<P>
Byron at 28 was the oldest of the company, Claire at 17 the youngest -- with 
the exception of Godwin and Shelley's son William, known as "Willmouse," who 
was less than a year old. 
</P>
<P>
That summer, Byron wrote "The Prisoner of Chillon" and "Darkness," his powerful 
vision of apocalypse as entropy which begins "I had a dream, which was not all 
a dream. The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars / Did wander darkling 
in the eternal space . . . ." Shelley wrote his pivotal poems, "Hymn to 
Intellectual Beauty" and "Mont Blanc." And one dark, presumably scary, night, 
the group set themselves the task of writing ghost stories, a game that 
eventually gave birth to Mary Shelley's astonishing novel, "Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, speculations about the strange menage abounded: Was Claire 
Shelley's mistress as well as Byron's? Had Byron, who was bisexual, found his 
way into Shelley's bed? Relatively few speculations, then or now, have focused 
on Polidori, who remains a kind of footnote to a footnote. 
</P>
<P>
Half Scottish, half Italian, "the youngest man ever to receive a medical degree 
from Edinburgh University," Polidori had literary ambitions himself. In taking 
up the case of "Lord Byron's Doctor," the accomplished, amazingly versatile 
writer Paul West is not out to "prove" that the brilliant, rather unstable, 
young physician was actually a neglected man of genius, or that he was 
intellectually or morally superior to the more luminous stars in this circle. 
This novel is by no means an "Amadeus"-style vindication of a lesser light. 
</P>
<P>
What does appear to interest West about Polidori is precisely his 
secondariness: his resentment at snubs and slights; the love-hatred he feels 
for Byron and the displaced hatred he feels toward Shelley for being Byron's 
friend and equal; and his nonetheless unshakable conviction that this 
experience marks the high point of his life: "I, however, had fixed on Diodati, 
the style of life and love there. The longer I was there, the less I was able 
to think of living in any other way, wolfing the sandwich in which humiliation 
sat between layers of splendor." 
</P>
<P>
West, who wrote a nonfiction book called "Byron and the Spoiler's Art" (1960) 
and who has explored the bizarre, the offbeat, the grotesque, and the liminal 
in numerous works of fiction, has an affinity for the least appetizing aspects 
of Byronism, and in Polidori he has found an eminently suitable mouthpiece for 
this novel's potent blend of fact and imaginative hypothesis. 
</P>
<P>
Frustrated, obsessed, unreliable, and more than a little mad to begin with, 
Polidori is also an anatomist driven by the dissector's need to see things at 
their worst, which he calls "deinosis." He details Byron's sadistic sexual 
exploits, his heartless treatment of Claire, his arrogance and self-loathing, 
in the mode of the scientific medical observer intrigued by strange symptoms, 
yet in the voice of a young man horrified and fascinated by a slightly older, 
vastly more glamorous one. The Polidori West gives us embodies that strain of 
Romanticism which sought to apply the fearless methods of Enlightenment 
rationalism to the irrational, forbidden, and mysterious realms summoned up in 
Gothicism. His susceptibility to the power of Byron's personality manifests 
Romanticism of a different sort. Here, he recalls their parting in the Alps: 
</P>
<P>
"We embraced once, twice, and I smelled the macassar oil in his hair, telling 
myself that all the fragrance of the wide world was going away from me now, all 
the joie-de-vivre and all the celebratedness; I was to pop back into the hole I 
had sprung from, but irremediably changed. Would I, at this watershed, this 
sheer drop, get the kiss he reserved for me alone? I did. I kissed him back, 
and we stayed there hugging in the recoil from the kiss, our cheeks in touch, 
our lips, our pairs of them, isolated in the spring air." 
</P>
<P>
West's feel for the Zeitgeist is matched by his uncanny, ventriloquistic 
ability to simulate the voices of these historical characters without seeming 
anachronistic. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of his narrative, Polidori is dead, a suicide at 26, unable to bear 
the letdown of being dropped from the charmed circle. Yet before then, he tells 
us what happened to the other characters -- this, although he dies in 1821, 
before Shelley or Byron, let alone Godwin or Claire. (West performs a similar 
narrative feat in his novel "The Very Rich Hours of Count von Stauffenberg.") 
The fiction writer's attempt to rejoin the magic circle of the past is bound to 
end in failure. West, like Polidori, is an imposer and something of an 
impostor. The strength of this novel is that for a little while we accept its 
imaginative imposition.
