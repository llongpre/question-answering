<DESCRIPT>  CONSUMER; PRODUCT; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE booming athletic shoe business is offering another item that can be sold
with a new pair of shoes, the innovative NRG (pronounced "energy") elastic
cord lace system.;   These bungee-cord type shoelaces help in keeping the
shoes securely on and convert a pair of athletic shoes into slip-ons. Because
the laces expand and contract, they do not bind like standard shoelaces. But
they still grant full support.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The NRG laces are used like an ordinary pair. It is best to first lace the
shoe on your foot so it's not too tight. Then insert the two ends into the
lock and secure. Instead of having to loosen the laces and tie to put on your
shoes, you just grasp the sides and slip them on.;   NRG's elastic cord lace
system is available now and sells for $7 per pair. For more information, call
(213) 474-9377, or write: NRG Inc., 10850 Wilshire Blvd., Eighth Floor, Los
Angeles 90024.;   BEAT THE BACKUP -- Another noteworthy item I recently found
is Design Tech's Reverse Alert.;   This product is a combination backup light
and warning alarm for your car. The Reverse Alert's 80-decibel tone is
designed to warn others that you are backing up.;   Best of all, this product
takes less than a minute to install. Since it replaces the existing backup
light bulb, it just snaps into place. It fits all import cars and 90 percent
of U.S. vehicles and sells for $30. For more information, call Sears at (800)
366-3000 (item No. 28BK5920).;   WHERE THERE'S SMOKE -- There is also a new
smoke detector that is easy to install and doesn't need to have its batteries
changed.;   New from Generation Two is the G2 Smoke Detector. Just screw it
into a light socket and it gets its power from the AC current. It features a
backup battery that automatically charges when the light switch is turned on
and takes over when it is turned off or in the event of a power failure.;   A
light bulb can be inserted in the opposite end of the smoke detector, so the
fixture can still be used as a lamp. The G2 Smoke Detector is available now
and sells for $25. For more information, call Hammacher Schlemmer, (800)
543-3366 (item No. 42507H).;   PAIN IN THE DRAIN -- The next time your sink
clogs, you may want to try Jet Blast's new Drain Blaster.;   This unit uses
water pressure to unclog even the most stubborn drains. It connects to any
faucet and features a thin 8-foot hose.;   After connecting the hose to the
faucet, just slide it into the drain and turn on the water. A high-pressure
jet spray pierces through blockages while flushing debris from pipe walls.;  
When tested on a slowly draining sink, this unit performed remarkably well,
better than liquid drain openers. The Drain Blaster sells for $20. For more
information, call (800) 538-2527.  </TEXT>
