Once it was just the young who clumped around in Doc Martens while their
elders tended to look on and wonder why they could not trip about in
something a little daintier. These days, however, clumpy shoes are
everywhere. I even found myself scouring London for a pair of heavy lace-up
Ann Demeulemeester shoes (found eventually - at a price - at Jones in Floral
Street in London's Covent Garden); everything else seemed too timid, too
demure to set off a new suit I had bought.
The fashion pages show that the skinniest, most fine-boned of models prefer
combat boots or heavy trainers. Every fashionable foot is wearing the
walking shoe, the army boot or the sturdy lace-up. There may be some among
you who think that dainty lady-like shoes should be worn with floating
chiffons - I urge you to try a sturdier shoe (or even boot) and see how it
gives a fresher, more youthful look, how it adds a touch of wit and
modernity to what could otherwise verge on cutesey sweetness.
An unlikely provider of this look is Hawkins, a traditional footwear company
which bears a Royal Warrant and which provided hard-wearing and comfortable
riding boots to the army during the Boer War.
For years Hawkins has been a solid provider of footwear for riding, for
walking, for the army. Its reputation was founded on function, quality and
practicality.
Fashion, however, has caught up with Hawkins which, to its astonishment
found that its Kinderboot, which it had perceived as a functional low-budget
walking boot, was nearly as fashionable as Doc Martens. Featured in The
Face, Arena and other trend-setting journals it was to be seen tromping up
and down the chicest streets, worn with everything from jeans and cotton
chinos to evening dress and floaty chiffons.
Since it had found itself so unexpectedly in the fashion arena Hawkins
decided that it might as well build on that and developed a fashion
collection of its own which it launches next Thursday.
As fashionable footwear this year coincides so closely with the things that
Hawkins does best - the boot, the lace-up, the brogue - the collection is
well-timed. Prices, though not cheap, do seem good value. They vary between
Pounds 39.99 and Pounds 89.99. Hiking boots can be had for Pounds 52.50, the
famous Kinderboot for about Pounds 55.
The collection is available nationwide at Sacha branches as well as at many
other shoe shops. For a local stockist you could call 0604-32293.
