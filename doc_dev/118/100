<LEADPARA>  A COLLEGE teacher of mine (anthropology) used to refer constantly to "the ham
bone." As I recall, the ham bone was central to the culture of some tribe
somewhere, although its importance is not only lost to me now but was lost to
me and my classmates then. The teacher would say, "It's like the ham bone,"
and we would nod, never admitting that we didn't know what he was talking
about. Now I know: He was talking about sneakers.;   Sneakers are my major
metaphor. I refer to them often and mention them in many contexts, sometimes
bothering to explain myself, sometimes not, lending myself an air of mystery
that I can desperately use. By sneakers, I want you to understand, I am not
referring to expensive athletic shoes. No. My sneakers are the most humble of
footwear, mere canvas and rubber, inexpensive and looking it. As a kid, I was
not permitted to wear them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Why? Because sneakers afforded the foot no support. Without support,
something awful happened to the arch and the ankle. They buckled and flattened
or some such thing. This was not only well known, it was scientific. Sneakers
were not even sold in really good shoe stores. You can look it up.;   Aside
from sports, only poor kids or those of negligent mothers wore sneakers. You
could spot those kids at school and feel sorry for them. I'd see their feet
shod in canvas and know, based entirely on what I had been told, that within a
certain period of time, they would have flat feet or ruined feet or no feet at
all. Sneakers could do that to you. You can look it up.;   You can also look
up the fact that medical science, a contradiction in terms, has changed its
mind on feet and their need for support. The latest wisdom (stay tuned for
revisions) is that the growing feet of growing children do not need any
support. The perfect shoe, it turns out, is the one with the least support. In
short, we're talking sneakers.;   This is why I prattle on about sneakers.
They not only represent the ability of medical science to change its mind and
to march, suddenly, in the opposite direction, but they also represent what I
call the ironic consequence of good intentions. It's important to note, for
instance, that if a mother was conscientious and avoided sneakers, she was
doing precisely the wrong thing. It's a miracle I can walk at all.;   Usually,
I yell "sneakers!" whenever medical science says with absolute authority that
what it has said with absolutely authority for so long is without any
authority whatsoever. I yelled "sneakers!" when I read just recently that,
really, caffeine is OK. This followed several years of reading how my coffee
habit was a killer. Now I am told caffeine really does wake me up in the
morning, helps my clarity of thought and -- unmentioned but true nonetheless
-- tastes just great. Also, it seems harmless. SNEAKERS!;   Up to now, I have
been yelling "sneakers!" all by myself. It would thrill me to no end if I
could be joined by 2,240 people. That's precisely the number of people
evacuated in 1982 from Times Beach, Mo., on account of truly lethal levels of
the chemical dioxin in the ground. All those people moved away. They lost
their homes. Now the government scientist who issued the original warning has
changed his mind. Sneakers!;   The best thing about the sneakers metaphor is
that it works no matter what happens next. For instance, back when sneakers
were universally considered the worst shoe you could wear, I noticed that the
poor kids who wore them seemed to walk just fine. Now I notice that those of
us who wore the bad heavy shoes walk just as well. This leads me to conclude
that in due course medical science will have something new to say on the
subject, at which time we can all yell "sneakers!" and have a good laugh.;  
But you'd be wrong if you concluded that sneakers! was an expression of
derision. No way. I'm a former smoker who sorely misses my old habit.
Sneakers! -- sigh -- is really a forlorn expression of hope.  </TEXT>
