Since the passing of the FSA (Footwear Services Act), shoe wearers and their
feet are protected from the unscrupulous salesperson. Witness the care and
diligence displayed by the footwear adviser.
Client: I'd like to try on that pair of shoes.
Footwear Adviser: If I may say so, madam, before we investigate that
particular pair, we must establish your foot-wearing circumstances and
objectives; after all, it might be that you need cycling shoes or wellington
boots or silver slippers or . . .
C: Sorry, I haven't time for all that. Those should fit the bill or rather,
my feet.
FA: We must take nothing for granted, madam. After all, you wouldn't thank
me for selling you slippers if you needed mountaineering boots.
C: True, but I know what I want.
FA: But do you know what you need? Do you need what you want? Our duty is to
your needs.
C: Okay, I need those shoes . . .
FA: Standing before madam is an experienced professional adviser - yet madam
prefers madam's amateur hunch? Has madam passed the Footwear Advisers'
Competency Test?
C: Isn't that simply multiple choice - with questions such as where should
shoes be put on? Hands, mosque, bathtub, feet?
FA: Now, now - life under the sole of the FSA is to madam's advantage. No
more pre-FSA days of blisters and bunions - of which-shod businessmen and .
. .
C: Please, can't I just buy those shoes?
FA: I could accept the order as execution-only; but my head's on the line -
or, rather, under the boot. I'm allowed only one a year, but if you insist .
. .
C: Excellent - I'll try one on. One's in the window.
FA: Oops, sorry] By displaying it, we're already advising you, so
execution-only is impossible. Mind you, it's a left shoe in the window; I
could let you have the right one execution-only.
C: But not the left?
FA: No, we'd need a fact-find on your left foot. It will be difficult to
leave the right one execution-only.
C: You win] Let's answer your questionnaire - it can't take long.
FA: Indeed not; we'll have our next meeting in three weeks, when your
personalised footwear report is ready.
C: You mean I can't buy the shoes today?
FA: Think of the complexities - of insteps, style, fashion statements,
laces. What appears right to you might not really be right for you.
C: But why do you need to know about my other shoes and dresses and the
colour of my underwear - and about my carpets?
FA: Footwear affects, and is affected by, all manner of things. Does it
match your clothing, even when you're undressing? Might stilettos damage
your floors?
C: I see . . .
A thousand-and-one weary sighs later, the client stumbles into the street;
she is barefooted. It looks as if she needs shoes, but conclusions must not
be drawn hastily.
Three weeks later, the adviser is explaining his lengthy report . . .
FA: So, we've projected from your current needs, ensuring you are well
foot-clad throughout life.
C: But I came in just for a pair of shoes - not for a lifetime of laces.
Where are the shoes I first saw?
FA: Unavailable, madam. They were in a sale.
C: But they're the ones I . . .
FA: Ah, you were going to use that naughty 'want' word again, weren't you.
Look, here's a pair recommended for you.
C: They're not shaped in the way I . . .
FA: Beware the 'W' word, madam.
C: I mean - their shape fails to satisfy the needs of my desires and they're
far too expensive.
FA: Come, come madam, do not be fooled by price. Prize your feet, not the
cost. You'll also need the winter-wear recommendations on page 18. Your
children must have . . .
C: But this will cost thousands. I don't like this pair.
FA: See how well these shoes are projected to perform for the next 20 years.
C: For so long? Perhaps they are worth buying.
FA: Mind you, the projections are mythical with assumptions about pavements
walked and . . .
C: Still, they must give some idea of what I'd be getting for my money.
FA: Not quite, madam. The illustrations are not based on these shoes and
costs; they derive from an average abstract shoe, unworn by mortals.
C: But it says here that the past is no guide to the future, so why are we
discussing any of this? Why were you asking me about past walking habits? If
the past's no guide, it's all irrelevant.
FA: Ah, the FSA regulatory bodies say . . .
C: I've heard enough. I'm going]
FA: But this form needs completion with your friends' names - purely because
you might walk out together.
Regrettably the client failed to recognise the adviser's professionalism.
But not all was lost for the shoe company.
The next day, she saw a newspaper offer for the desired shoes. Different FSA
advertising rules permitted her to buy the shoes right off the page.
Unable to check the fit, she was lucky; they felt just right. Tragically,
she remains blind to her needs; she merely got what she wanted.
