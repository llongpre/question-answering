   When G.H. Bass &amp; Co.'s former corporate parent
finally found a buyer for its shoe manufacturer in 1987, prospects
for Bass looked so bleak that the new owner got a bargain.
   Today, the 113-year-old Bass is winning back a following after
rescuing its reputation for quality and updating its traditional
styles.
   Bass was on the block when the British-Dutch consumer products
giant Unilever acquired Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., which had owned
Bass since 1978.
   No eager buyers rushed forward because the American footwear
industry was being crushed by foreign competition and Bass looked
like it lacked the market toehold to wage a successful fight.
   ``Bass had done nothing but struggle from 1983 to 1987,'' says
John Thorbeck, the current Bass president. ``During this time, Bass
was a prominent example of how a domestic manufacturer was under
great pressure, and at the same time was dealing with its own
misdirection and mismanagement.''
   American shoe manufacturers in the early 1980s had to adjust to
radically changing American tastes in shoes while coping with an
influx of imports.
   Orderly marketing agreements with South Korea and Taiwan
controlling U.S. imports of non-rubber footwear _ meaning virtually
all types of shoes _ were allowed to expire under the Reagan
administration. At the time, the two countries were major foreign
suppliers of everything from tennis sneakers to dressy pumps.
   Imports surged. By 1986, imported leather and plastic shoes had
expanded to about 1 billion pairs from 520 million in 1981, said
Peter T. Mangione, president of the Footwear Distributors and
Retailers of America.
   The supply went to satisfy a burgeoning demand for athletic
shoes; the jogging craze evolved into the aerobics fad, both of
which were part of a bigger fitness movement that has influenced
consumers' shoe selections ever since.
   ``The driving factor in the footwear market in this country is
fashion and the athletic trend drove this market for the last
decade,'' says Mangione.
   In such an environment, a company like Bass known for
conservative, sturdy leather lace-ups and loafers wasn't where it
was at.
   ``Nobody was crazy about traditional Bass Weejuns,'' Thorbeck
says of the shoe, named for its Norwegian inspiration, that debuted
in 1936. ``These were the years when Nike and Reebok were becoming
billion-dollar companies. The casual shoes were being swept aside
by the Nike and Reebok hurricanes.''
   During those troubling years for Bass, which had been a private,
family-owned business for most of its history, the firm branched
out in directions that turned out to be the wrong ones.
   It introduced Bass Air, a line of athletic shoes that flopped.
It imported a line of women's shoes from Brazil and the quality was
so poor that every retailer returned its shipments to Bass. It
neglected to advertise or place marketing emphasis on its hand-sewn
leather moccasins and other shoes. With cost-cutting in mind, it
allowed quality to slip.
   Most of Bass's U.S. factories were shuttered, leaving only one
in Wilton, Maine, and one in Puerto Rico. The company lost $46
million on sales of $150 million in 1986.
   The next year Phillips-Van Heusen Corp., famous for making and
marketing women's and men's apparel, particularly shirts, bought
Falmouth, Maine-based Bass for $79 million, well under its book
value of $130 million.
   Thorbeck, formerly with shoe company Timberland Co., says when
he was brought in by Phillips-Van Heusen in November 1987 he felt
Bass needed to reassert its identity after mistakenly ignoring its
own strengths for too long.
   Bass decided to win back affluent consumers, those willing to
pay around $100 for a pair of loafers. It took a targeted
advertising approach and placed 12-page promotional pitches in the
upscale magazines Vogue and GQ.
   Some early successes under the new ownership helped restore the
company's confidence. Contemporary versions of some of Bass's old
favorites appealed to retailers, who probably were looking for shoe
lines to satisfy nostalgia-mad grown-up baby boomers. Saddle shoes
and buckskins were enjoying renewed popularity within some yuppie
circles
   ``In one season we proved ourselves as traditional yet
contemporary,'' says Thorbeck. ``We were hitting on all cylinders
by the fall of 1988.''
   Some of Bass's recent updating touches have proved timely. The
company capitalized on the demand for so-called status sneakers
this spring by bringing out a version of the canvas, rubber-soled
shoe swith brass eyelets, leather-padded trim and leather laces.
Instead of selling a projected 30,000 pairs in the first year, Bass
now thinks it will sell 400,000 pairs.
   Bass has concentrated on a relatively small selection of
retailers, including department stores Bloomingdale's, Marshall
Field and Nordstrom.
   It doesn't sell to discounters at all and controls the markdowns
on its merchandise by offering reduced-price shoes at outlets.
These Bass-owned stores are carefully located in areas with
numerous factory outlets that attract bargain-hunting tourists.
   Bass has returned to profitability. It earned $16 million in
1988 on sales of $180 million and expects to report significantly
better results for 1989.
   A Bass catalog has been brought out, with clothing to complement
the shoes.
   Thorbeck says he's pleased with the prominence retailers are
giving Bass in their shoe departments.
   Phillips-Van Heusen has given Bass management leeway to develop
its own strategy.
   ``One of the advantages of a company that was in this poor shape
was we could sweep through changes without much hesitation,'' says
Thorbeck. ``We went back to what we knew best and we reinterpreted
it for a contemporary customer.''
