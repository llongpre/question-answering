   Sparks fly while Reggie Kester hammers a
length of red-hot iron just out of the forge, and gradually the
metal takes the shape of a horseshoe.
   Kester works in much the same way as craftsmen have for hundreds
of years, using forge, anvil and hammer. His rough hands speak of
the 30-odd years he has spent in the trade.
   But this isn't the village smithy. Kester and his wife,
Marcella, run the Oklahoma State Horseshoeing School, where they
teach the craft of the farrier, not blacksmithing.
   People hoping to enter what can be a lucrative trade come to the
school from around the world.
   ``I know guys that are making $150,000 shoeing horses,'' Kester
says. But he admits most make between $20,000 and $40,000 a year.
   They've have had students from Germany, Sweden, Australia,
Canada, Ireland, Israel and Switzerland. The six-week course costs
$2,450 and is offered six times a year.
   Kester credits trade advertising and word-of-mouth for the
school's wide appeal. All kinds sign up for the Kesters' courses.
   ``Most of the people we have are people who have experience with
horses,'' Kester says. But he adds: ``We have people come through
here who know nothing about horses except what they look like.''
   Kester says that after his course, they'll all be able to shoe a
horse and make a horseshoe from scratch.
   ``Sometimes you just can't buy what you need,'' Kester says.
``So you make it.''
   He says he learned the trade of a farrier as he teaches it: in
school.
   ``I'm a journeyman, certified horseshoer,'' he said. ``I've had
a lot of experience, and I've been in the teaching business for 15,
16 years.
   ``I went to school for it in '66. I thought I knew something
until I went to school and met people who did.''
   Kester says there's a lot to being a farrier, and it takes
instruction and practice. He says an unskilled person who shoes a
horse runs the risk of crippling the animal.
   His students don't spend all their time at the anvil. He's got a
textbook, a thick volume called ``The Principles of Horseshoeing
II,'' which contains information about anatomy, metallurgy and
history.
   Kester says there are many types of horseshoes for different
kinds of animals. There are lightweight, aluminum shoes for race
horses; large, heavy shoes for work animals; and even plastic shoes
for injured horses.
   Most horseshoes today are still metal and are nailed to a
horse's hoof. But synthetic and plastic shoes that are glued to the
hoof are beginning to take over.
   ``I think in 10 or 20 years the standard horseshoe we've known
for hundreds of years'll be obsolete,'' Kester says.
   As long as there are horses, there will be a need for people to
shoe them, but Kester says the farrier's business requires
individuals to go out and find clients.
   ``You don't go get a job'' just out of school, he says. ``You go
get a clientele. It's an entrepreneurial deal.''
   Clients vary. Racetracks are specialized and many require union
certification, he says, and working on show horses requires a high
level of skill. Horses with injured hoofs need a special kind of
care.
   In some ways, Kester says, he's an equine podiatrist. But he's
not a blacksmith.
   ``I call myself a horseshoer ... and that's what I am.''
