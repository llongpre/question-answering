<LEADPARA>  LIKE flocks of penguins looking for a rookery, more than a thousand men in
tuxedos wandered the downtown streets of Palo Alto on Saturday night, with an
equal number of ball-gowned women beside them.;    Starting at City Hall on
Hamilton Avenue, they promenaded past Mac's newsstand on Emerson Street and
Zebra Copiers on University Avenue, finally coming to roost in celebratory
glory above the traffic on the Alma Street bridge. But they didn't come to
preen and pick at each other's feathers; they came to party.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It was Palo Alto's fifth annual Black and White Ball, which has exploded
from the first 125-person dance at Lucie Stern Community Center to a mega
gala-cum-dance riot that spreads from the Holiday Inn to the downtown CalTrain
station and MacArthur Park restaurant, with plenty of fun in between -- thanks
to the Galactic Rock Tent, a hip-hop DJ with projection dance screen towering
over the street and pedicabs schlepping revelers from one site to the other,
zipping through the strolling crowds.;    From 9 p.m. until 2 a.m. an army of
musicians and other entertainers held court at the scattered sites. As if
things weren't already lively enough, there was even a midnight raid by those
musical anarchists, the Stanford Marching Band.;    With streets closed off
and the 3,000 revelers converging nearly en masse, downtown Palo Alto was very
confused for a while. Maury Hearn and Shawn DeLuna, who just happened to be
cruising by in a fully restored and beautiful 1935 Packard Super Eight, caught
the attention of the Palo Alto Police, who assumed the guys were there for the
ball. They weren't, but they passed on through when the officers thoughtfully
moved a barricade for them. And, since they had their tuxedos on hand -- for a
Concours d'Elegance they planned to attend Sunday -- they parked the Packard
outside MacArthur Park, adding a touch of old-time elegance to the evening.;  
 For all that $50-a-head tickets and black-tie imply, it was a remarkably
egalitarian, universal party-hardy crowd of all ages, with women in beautiful
black lace swigging Coors in the street and very distinguished-looking men in
elegant tuxedos sweating clear through to their cummerbunds, dancing to the
Zasu Pitts Memorial Orchestra in the tent and the Pete Escovedo Orchestra at
MacArthur Park.;    There were lots of little black dresses, of course, but
also a number of elegant pantsuits, a fair amount of white satin, a generous
amount of lace. One woman in red, and another just barely held in by a gold
wrap-around number, added bright splashes of color to the black and white
evening. Very few men wore anything other than standard-issue tuxes, though
there was at least one pair of leather pants and the tyranny of black tie
formality was disturbed frequently by men wearing glow-in-the dark earrings.; 
  It was, however, painfully evident that very few attendees knew how to
samba, rumba or foxtrot. Really, Palo Alto, learn to dance.;    The best
dancers seemed to gravitate to the tent, for The Plaids and Zasu. It was sad
to see the Bill Lombardo Orchestra play a perfect fox trot in one of the two
Holiday Inn ballrooms for people who had no idea how to step-step-side-step.
In a second Holiday Inn ballroom, as the Charms (in really scary '50s poof
blond wigs) played "Tan Shoes and Pink Shoelaces," people just generally went
rhythmically insane, which was acceptable. All around them were tables piled
high with sweets ranging from strawberry shortcake to truffles to mini-quiches
to keep their energy levels up.;    Outside the Soda Shop on the darkened
lawn, Heidi Anderson and Marilyn Parker of Palo Alto played with their
light-up yo-yos.;    "Watch out," Anderson shouted, "I'm walking the dog!"
"Hey, honey, I'm going around the world," Parker yelled.;    By 10:45 the
lines to the women's rooms were dangerously long. At MacArthur Park an
emergency was declared and the men's room was turned into a second women's
room, with a hastily scrawled sign directing men to the temporary facilities
set up in the street. At the Holiday Inn, a gentleman threw his tuxedo over
his desperate date's face, and shouting "Girl on the floor!" escorted her
blindly into the mens room, where, of course, the lines were much shorter.;   
Patty Richmond of Palo Alto was dancing to rap music on the Alma bridge when
she was startled by the sneak attack of the Stanford Band, which has been
thrown out of worse places than the Black and White Ball. "If I'd been dancing
to a song I really liked," Richmond said, "It would have made me mad, I guess,
but this was all right.";    The guerrilla commandos of marching music, the
Stanford anarchists rushed around the train station parking loop, then took a
formation on the bridge to play the Doors' "Come On, Touch Me, Baby.";    At 2
a.m., as most of the crowd were just starting to think about leaving, John and
Sherri Shenk of Atherton started through the graffiti-covered pedestrian
tunnel back to downtown. Seduced by the great, resonant echoes, John Shenk
cupped his hands and capped the evening with a series of animal howls:
"Arooooooo!" he yelled into the night. "Yip-yup-ah-arooooo!"  </TEXT>
