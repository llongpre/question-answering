   Want to run faster and jump higher? 

   No sweat. 
All you have to do is lace up a pair of high-tech sneakers. 

   It's all part of the shoes' "biomechanical" design -- which has replaced fashion as the selling hook in athletic-shoe advertising. 
The new shoes, their makers say, collect energy released by each step and return some of it to the wearer. 

   The performance revolution, however, may be more gimmick than substance. 

   For one thing, most athletic-shoe buyers -- 80%, in fact -- wear them for walking. 
In addition, researchers question just how much of an advance the high-tech shoes represent for runners. 
Even people in the industry get a bit fuzzy when they talk about what they're pitching. 

   "I run in the shoes myself," says Brian Igoe, a Reebok International Ltd. marketing executive. 
"I like them, but I don't know how much energy return I'm getting." 

   Nevertheless, the shoe makers know a good sales pitch when they see it -- especially with the Summer Olympics coming. 
"The feeling among companies," says Mr. Igoe, "is that the general public will say, 'Hey, if the shoe is good to run a marathon in, then it's certainly good to go to the supermarket in.'" 
Shoe makers also think consumers are tiring of the fashion emphasis -- started by Reebok in 1983 -- and may be ripe for a new approach. 

   Companies are pouring money into advertising the high-tech shoes, which cost $65 to $100 a pair. 
The progenitor of the breed was Nike Inc.'s Air Revolution shoe, introduced last year with television ads set to the Beatles' "Revolution" and print ads promising improved performance. 
Several rivals have been introduced recently, or will be soon, including the Energy Wave shoe from Converse Inc., a unit of Interco Inc.; the World Trainer shoe, with an "Energy Return System," from Reebok; and a line of shoes from Etonic Inc. using a "Dynamic Reaction Plate." 

   The shoes have similar designs: A resilient substance, such as polyurethane, gel or compressed air, is sandwiched in the sole. 
The companies say the substance both cushions the foot as it hits the ground and captures some of the energy released and returns it to the foot. 

   In their ads, the shoe makers promise improved performance -- much as Hyde Athletic Industries Inc. did back in the 1950s when it said PF Flyers would make kids walk, run and jump better. 
"Imagine how much easier running would be," reads a current Etonic ad for the reaction plate, "if people could actually get energy from their shoes, so they could use less of their own." 
A Converse ad promises, "Athletes riding the (Energy) Wave can keep fresher legs, jump higher, run further." 

   The ads often cite in-house research in claiming that the company's shoes are better than the competition's. 
Reebok, for instance, says its Energy Return System is superior to the Nike Air Max and the Tiger Gel (made by Asics Tiger Corp., a unit of Asics Tiger Japan) by "up to 30%." 
Converse says its Energy Wave "provides 77% more energy return than (Nike's) Air." 

   Nike dismisses these attacks as "unscientific." 
Martin Short, director of Nike's sports research division, says, "What Reebok says is energy return is not necessarily what we define as energy return." 

   Some researchers say the high-tech footwear isn't significantly better than its predecessors. 
Peter Cavanagh, a professor of biomechanics at Pennsylvania State University and author of a book on running shoes, says buyers "have had high-energy return shoes all along without realizing it. 
What has happened is that the companies never before considered high energy as a marketing plan."
