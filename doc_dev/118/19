   While Richard Nixon was on the West Coast to
open his presidential library, actor Jim Cooke did what he could
here Wednesday to revive the reputation of another maligned
president, Calvin Coolidge.
   He brought his one-man show, ``More Than Two Words,'' to the
National Archives auditorium to repeat the wit and words of a chief
executive who is usually pictured as possessing little of either.
   The show's title comes from a Coolidge story, perhaps apocryphal.
   ``Oh, Mr. Coolidge!'' a dinner partner is said to have gushed to
a president known for his taciturn tendencies. ``I've made a five
dollar bet that I can get more than two words out of you.''
   Said he to her: ``You lose.''
   Cooke, 53, like Coolidge a flinty Vermonter, tried to hide his
dismay when he was reminded in an interview that history has not
been kind to Coolidge.
   Samuel Eliot Morison, in his ``Oxford History of the American
People,'' said this of the man who served as president for six
years during the tumultuous 1920s:
   ``A mean, thin-lipped little man, a respectable mediocrity, he
lived parsimoniously but admired men of wealth, and his political
principles were those current in 1902. People thought Coolidge
brighter than he was because he seldom said anything. ...
   ``Mrs. Coolidge was a handsome and gracious lady, without whom
the formal parties at the White House would have been unbearably
grim. She helped this dour, abstemious and unimaginative figure to
become one of the most popular American presidents.''
   Cooke flinched when reminded.
   He said maybe historians had been so enamored of Franklin D.
Roosevelt ``that they got into the habit of denigrating anyone who
came before him.''
   Maybe it was the mad-dog midday heat that brought them in, but a
lunchtime audience of Washingtonians spent an hour with Cooke and
Coolidge. By coincidence, the performance occurred on the same day
that Nixon, another former president with a rotten reputation, was
in Yorba Linda, Calif., for a ceremony opening his presidential
library to the public.
   Cooke recited lines from Coolidge's twice-weekly news
conferences, from his speeches, from his autobiography first
serialized in Cosmopolitan magazine in 1933, and from his letters
to his father, always signed, ``Your son, Calvin Coolidge.''
   Coolidge, Cooke said later, delivered his humor deadpan, almost
with a scowl, so effectively that people didn't know he was joking.
   At a news conference, talking about retirement and twitting his
reputation for parsimony, he said: ``I would like to report that
there is no foundation to the rumor that I have been offered an
opportunity to teach a course in thrift at Scotland's University of
Aberdeen.''
   And hidden deep within a paragraph of his autobiography: ``The
pressure to speak is constant and intolerable. However, I resisted
most of it.''
   ``I have found in the course of a long public career,'' said
Coolidge and recited Cooke, ``that the things I did not say never
hurt me.''
   For the occasion, Cooke wore a starched, high-collared shirt, a
tight double-breasted suit and high-lace shoes.
   He used to teach theater at Boston's Emerson College, has done
Coolidge 40 or 50 times over the last five years and hopes to do it
in each of the 48 states in the union when Coolidge was in the
White House.
   ``I've come to like him a lot,'' said Cooke. He also likes what
Coolidge's son, John, 83, said _ Coolidgelike _ when he took in
Cooke's first performance in Coolidge's hometown, Plymouth, Vt.:
``I thought he did quite well.''
   After the show, Fran Wells, who came here in 1939 and worked for
the old War Production Board and for the Federal Trade Commission
and the Postal Service, hurried up to Cooke and said, ``I have to
tell you, I have a better opinion of that man.''
   Coolidge might have frowned. Cooke beamed.
