a crowd with odd footwear.  A Spanish designer and producer with an original
range - from the asymmetrical, to more classic styles

Anyone accustomed to buying shoes that are absolutely identical has probably
not stopped to consider whether there is some immutable law behind this
perfect symmetry.
Since our childhood, shoes have come in pairs and the likelihood was that
they would do so for ever more.
But Camper, a Spanish company based in Majorca, decided to look at the
matter differently. 'Why,' it asked, 'is that throughout history a pair of
shoes has always been made symmetrical, the left exactly the same as the
right?'
And it followed this up with another question: 'Why can't a pair of shoes be
disparate, asymmetrical and the left different from the right?' Twins, after
all, are not necessarily identical and sometimes even scarcely resemble each
other.
It went on to point out that the notion of asymmetry has a distinguished
architectural lineage - from Gaudi and Le Corbusier in the fields of
architecture to Vionnet, Miyake, Yohji Yamamoto and Rei Kawakubo in the
field of fashion.
From there it was a short step to an exercise in exploring the asymmetrical
pairs of shoes, some of which are photographed here. The kinship between the
shoes is obvious - there could be no mistaking that they belong to the same
pair and yet each left is subtly, and sometimes not so subtly, different
from the right.
For those who find this breaking of the established rules of footwear a
trifle alarming, Camper does produce other ranges which, though less
innovatory, are just as interesting.
Its Camaleon line is a self-conscious recreation of a peasant shoe, the sort
worn by country people all over Majorca. The perfect shoe for the
ecologically concerned, it is made from unusable off-cuts of leather, worn
out tyres and strips of canvas.
It also occurs to me that it is the perfect shoe for those who dislike
anything that looks too new - these shoes look as if they have already been
to some interesting places before they leave the shop. For those who do not
lead the life of a country peasant these shoes are the sort to take on
holiday, to beaches, to Majorca perhaps.
Perfect for those who spend summer holidays on beaches or in hot climates is
the Terra collection. Based on the old-fashioned espadrille it has been
updated by dyeing the canvas with colours and patterns and using new
materials (rubber and natural rope) for the sole which give it greater
strength without detracting from the original 'look'.
Camper also has a range for real traditionalists - the Cartujano which aims
to marry traditional Spanish styling with fine quality leather. There are
soft loafers, brogues, boots - the whole gamut of classic footwear.
The Camper range can be found at Paul Smith of Floral Street, Covent Garden,
London WC2; Nichols of Birmingham; Matches of Wimbledon; Limeys of
Leicester, Sheffield, Derby, Nottingham; The Natural Shoe Store, 325 Kings
Road, London SW3; and 21 Neal Street, London WC2. Prices range from Pounds
45-Pounds 80.
If your tastes are more classic still it might be worth looking at the
Paraboot which has similarly romantic origins. Camper shoes are made using
traditional methods in little workshops all over Majorca, while the Paraboot
comes from the small village of Izeaux in the Isere region of France. The
original footwear produced in Izeaux was practical and sturdy, shoes for the
tough farming life, often made in the farmers' own homes with crude tools.
However, Remy Richard-Pontvert, a local cobbler, began to visit fine Paris
boutiques and saw that quality and finish were important if he wanted to
expand and sell to more sophisticated shoppers. While in America he saw
rubber-soled shoes. He went straight home and developed and then patented
his own rubber sole from which evolved the Paraboot (the rubber came from
Para in Brazil).
In France they are as well-known as Church's are in Britain. They are made
from fine full-grain leather and all the stitching is still done by hand.
They have only fairly recently been on sale in the UK but have already
become much sought after.
Most famous shoe in the range is possibly Michael, a soft casual lace-up but
there are loafers, brogues, boots, golf shoes and boat shoes. Prices range
around Pounds 105 a pair and the shoes can be found in good men's shoe
shops, including Office Shoes, Jigsaw for Men, Woodhouse and Selfridges in
London.
