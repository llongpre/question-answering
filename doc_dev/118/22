   Andy is a 2-year-old with a new pair of
shoes. Nothing unusual about that, except that Andy is a goose.
   Andy, owned by Gene Fleming of Hastings, was born without feet
and has legs that end in stumps just below the ankle.
   ``He had to balance himself like a child on stilts,'' Fleming
said.
   Until recently, Andy's legs weren't big enough to support shoes.
Fleming bought leather shoes _ size 0 _ for Andy.
   Now, the goose can walk, run and swim.
   ``Those shoes gave him a whole new lease on life,'' Fleming
said. ``Now he can outswim the other geese.''
   Fleming said the idea for shoes came easily, but that keeping
the shoes on a goose was another matter.
   He modified the shoes, putting foam rubber in the end for
comfort and to keep them from turning around. He also had to glue
the bows to the shoe because Andy kept untying the laces. Small
holes in the bottom of each shoe allows water to drain so the
leather won't freeze in winter.
   ``He just loves 'em,'' Fleming said. ``He doesn't try to kick
them off any more. He used to think he had mud on his feet and kept
kicking backward. Now he's got a big smile on his face.''

   Malay, this Southeast Asian
nation's official language, is for the birds as far as a carnival
is concerned.
   Mynah birds that can speak Malay will get more points in a mynah
bird speech contest at a carnival in Lumut 75 miles northwest of
here next month, according to the national news agency Bernama.
   The competition is open to mynahs able to speak any language,
said Zainuddin Abdul Shukor, chairman of the carnival organizing
committee.
   The contest is open to all mynah owners in peninsular Malaysia,
said Zainuddin, who is also director of the National Parks and
Wildlife Department.
