   News reports of a 77-year-old miser who
died with no known relatives and had $250,000 stashed in banks
across the country have drawn out a horde of would-be heirs.
   And now the lawyer in charge of the man's estate has got a judge
to agree to a search for even more money.
   At least 400 people claiming blood ties to Henry Drummond have
called the Ingham County Probate Court or Paul Rosenbaum, the
state-appointed lawyer handling Drummond's estate. An additional 150
have written.
   ``I have about 100 people asking for checks who say they are
second cousins twice-removed,'' Rosenbaum said. ``It's like `Send me
a check, we'll figure out how I'm related later.'''
   If no relatives are found, Drummond's estate will go to the state
of Michigan.
   Thanks to bank correspondence found in Drummond's $49-a-week room
at the YMCA in downtown Lansing, Rosenbaum has located accounts
holding more than $250,000 in nine banks from Denver to Boston.
   And during a hearing Thursday in Ingham County Probate Court,
Rosenbaum said Drummond's fortune could be even larger than first
thought, swelled by what he believes are extensive holdings in
stocks and bonds.
   In addition to the mail from banks in Drummond's room, the lawyer
said he found a key to a safe-deposit box, but it doesn't fit any
safe-deposit boxes in Lansing. Judge George Economy authorized
Rosenbaum to spend $5,000 to hire a private investigator to scour
the country for the box that matches the key.
   Drummond died Jan. 28, three weeks after he was found unconscious
in his $49-a-week room at the YMCA in downtown Lansing.
   He had come to town in 1985, and spent his days roaming the
streets.
   He wore an old fedora, an old coat and had unwashed, scraggly
hair and a beard. He apparently did not bathe often. Workers in the
Federal Building once chipped in and bought Drummond a suit and
other clothes. He never wore them.
   If anyone asked about his past or his family, he would become
evasive, said postal worker Francis Dodge.
   In Drummond's room, Rosenbaum found hundreds of pairs of used
shoe laces, three old suits, eight pairs of shoes and 50 pairs of
white socks. One drawer was full of clippings and pictures of
Princess Diana of Great Britain.
   Rosenbaum also found journals in Drummond's handwriting, from
which he has been able to put together a sketchy history.
   Drummond was born June 27, 1911, in Houston. His father was John
T. Drummond, a carpenter for the Southern Pacific Railroad. His
mother's maiden name was Westelle Rosalie Howard. He was an only
child.
   When Drummond was 4, his father left and later died in Denver.
His mother died in 1952 at the age of 80.
   Drummond graduated from high school in Pasadena, Calif., and
worked in a bank. He was drafted in 1942 and served four years in
the Army as a clerk-typist, before returning to the bank.
   Drummond wrote that he was fired from his bank job in 1959 by a
man who accused him of stealing adhesive tape and other supplies. He
then worked as a postal clerk in Pasadena until he retired in 1973.
   Then it was on to Denver, where he lived at a YMCA until 1981. He
spent the next four years roaming the East Coast, staying at YMCAs
and opening bank accounts.
   Drummond was earning some $20,000 a year in interest and his
government pension when he died.
