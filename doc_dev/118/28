<DESCRIPT>  FASHION; YEAR; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  FASHION designers welcomed the first year of the '90s by resurrecting the
'60s, causing women who'd been there before to wince and others to roll up the
waistbands of their already short skirts and wonder if false eyelashes, too,
would make a comeback.;    Those same designers also took a look around at
what real people -- not clotheshorses -- were actually wearing, and gave a
twist to "street fashion" by turning things such as parkas and hooded sweat
shirts, stretchy bicycle shorts, waist-slung belt bags and all manner of
functional sportswear into "high fashion."  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  THE YEAR IN FASHION
NO DOMINANT '90 TREND, EXCEPT HIGH PRICES  </HEADLINE>
<MEMO>  Style  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Everybody moaned about the high cost of clothes, then went right out and
bought whatever it was they considered essential in their lives: yet another
pair of dangly earrings; a Barbara Bush fake pearl choker; a Bart Simpson
T-shirt; expensive running or walking or aerobic or basketball or
cross-trainer athletic shoes; a long, long jacket; or maybe even something in
a bright color for a change.;    It was not a year when only one look or idea
dominated women's fashion or when a new or renewed trend or fad blotted out
everything else.;    Ironically, the new women's clothes that were added to
many a mainstream wardrobe were based on ideas that first appeared on European
runways in '88 and '89.;    The fashions that looked weird and elicited scorn
and "who's going to wear that stuff?" back then started looking fairly normal
when they showed up on women riding the bus, sitting at the next desk, dining
at the next table in the same restaurant: long jackets or great big sweaters
with tights -- and nothing else; over-the-knee boots; dressy shorts worn with
hose and a jacket for jobs or social events; embroidered, sequined,
embellished everything; and, yes, even short skirts.;    The surprise
successes of the fall season were what Neiman Marcus vice president and
fashion director Joan Kaner calls "second skins," referring to all types of
stretch body coverings -- leggings, stirrups, catsuits -- that were strong
sellers at all price levels. They were the cover-ups, literally, that helped a
lot of women ease into shorter skirts or newer looks by offering coverage and
doing away with the appearance of naked legs.;    But if there was one item
that said "fashion" in 1990, it was the jacket. Women who already owned a
bunch of them added one more -- a long, long, lean one by, or more likely,
inspired by Giorgio Armani. Others latched on to all sorts of variations of
Chanel-styled jackets, particularly those in plaids or sporting some type of
quilting.;    By far, these two designers -- Milan's Armani and Chanel's Karl
Lagerfeld -- continued to be the most influential in the realm of women's
clothing: Armani for his understated, comfortable and easy clothes, along with
his muted and mellow colors; Lagerfeld for everything from jackets and tights
to tiny bags, wide headbands and wigs.;    The name that gained added
recognition among fashion followers during the past year was that of Parisian
Claude Montana, sure to be an increasingly potent force in the future with his
sleek and modern clothes.;    Among American designers, Donna Karan continued
to do phenomenal business, especially with her DKNY collection of sporty
clothes. Though this line is supposedly moderately priced, many of her fervid
fans add a treasured piece or two only after vigilantly watching for "sale"
signs, then pouncing when a markdown makes something affordable.;    At year's
end, Karan was named women's fashion designer of the year by the Council of
Fashion Designers, while a youngster, 21-year-old Christian Francis Roth, was
awarded the council's "new talent" prize for his whimsical clothes based on
children's playthings -- Crayola sleeves, tick-tack-toe pockets.;    The year
ended with the promise that the dress was making a comeback, something that
women will decide when they start buying spring clothes -- if they do.;    In
men's clothing, it was pattern that made an impact. Though ponytails and
slouchy suits and spicy colors caught on with some individualists and the
fashion forward, by far the biggest thing to hit the widest audience was the
patterned -- or the "important" -- tie.;    Teens into "looks" focused on
their heads and their feet: Big hair, no hair, colored hair, partially shaved
heads, box cuts and baseball caps vied for attention with clunky Doc Martens,
any big black shoes or canvas shoes -- especially high-tops with different
colored laces that are never, never, ever laced.  </TEXT>
