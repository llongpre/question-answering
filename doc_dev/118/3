American women are in the midst of a flats attack. Just ask Libby Edelman, 
designer and co-owner of Sam &amp; Libby shoes in Northern California, who 
accords top billing to her company's leather ballerina slipper. 
</P>
<P>
At Nina in New York, fashion director Flori Silverstein likens her firm's big 
hit, a wedge-heel, patent-leather skimmer (2 million pairs sold in two years), 
to a classic T-shirt. And Miriam Sirota, the trendy co-owner of Privilege shoe 
stores in Los Angeles, insists "flats have become a basic." 
</P>
<P>
She's seen the most avid high-heel wearers make the switch this spring, 
inspired perhaps by Sirota's firm belief: "Flats don't mean unflattering." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes they don't mean expensive either. This year the hot contender is 
expressive, fabric footwear that retails for $50 or less. 
</P>
<P>
Sirota says she and partner Thierry Coulon carefully chose three cloth designs 
from Europe, all priced around $50, to sell along with much more expensive 
merchandise. While she thinks of them as "fun, one-season throwaway shoes," she 
says they don't have to be. 
</P>
<P>
"It all depends on how much a woman wears them. If she buys one pair to go with 
three or four outfits and wears them once a week, they can last longer." 
</P>
<P>
Details such as a slight, wedge-heel on a pair of fuchsia, purple and black 
Shantung ballerina slippers at Privilege "make it just a little bit easier to 
walk in than a flat flat," Sirota notes. "They sell well because they give the 
comfort and allure of a flat, but they give you height as well." 
</P>
<P>
Measuring in at 5-foot-1, Sirota scoffs at the notion that petite women need 
high heels. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in flats every day. I'm short and it doesn't bother me even if I go 
somewhere where I'm the shortest person in the room." Describing her personal 
style as "very, very trendy," Sirota believes that some of today's fashions, 
"Bermuda shorts, miniskirts and long, wide pants are totally unfit for high 
heels." 
</P>
<P>
Nina's Silverstein has her own answers to why more and more women are getting 
into low-heel shoes: "Life is getting faster and we have to move faster." 
</P>
<P>
One of her company's most popular styles is a $39, go-anywhere mule (a slip-on 
shoe open at the toe and heel) that comes in bright-colored patent leather or 
metallics. It is considered to have longevity despite the price. 
</P>
<P>
"They need care," Silverstein says, suggesting that patent be wiped with a damp 
cloth. She says cloth designs, such as pastel and print-mix espadrilles, "can 
be spot-cleaned with a little soap and water and a toothbrush, but the joy of 
most fabric shoes is not to have to spend a lot of money for them and not to 
worry about them." 
</P>
<P>
Silverstein's tricks for fabric footwear include adding an emblem or an 
inexpensive Chanel-look pin where you might expect to see a bow. "Or you can 
paint them or change the ribbons. And if worst comes to worst, you can buy a 
little package of dye and dye them black." 
</P>
<P>
Fun and quality at a price are two reasons "fabric shoes are back," she says. 
"Who wants to spend $100 for polka-dot leather pumps when you can have polka 
dots for $35 and throw them out at the end of the summer." 
</P>
<P>
For designer Edelman, this year's challenge was "to get people out of last 
summer's sneakers. We thought they would be ready for a change." She designed 
canvas shoes in solids, stripes or dots and added a crest as well as a leather 
sole. 
</P>
<P>
Lillian Navarro, shoe designer for Chinese Laundry, sees both stripes and 
European-inspired suede summer shoes, with slightly pointed toes and high 
vamps, as "wardrobe necessities." 
</P>
<P>
To get women's feet closer to the ground, designers such as Navarro are adding 
clever ornamentations to flats that suggest "the dressy look of high heels," 
she says.
