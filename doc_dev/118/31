jacket and black metal jewellery are perfect to set off the slip-dress as it
comes come out of the boudoir

Visualise the counterpoint of iron and lace, specifically, the chiaroscuro
of black Berlin iron jewellery resting on white skin dressed in lambent
satin edged with lace.
For the past two seasons, the American designer Donna Karan has been showing
slips in silk satin - but these slips are not for the boudoir, they are to
be worn as day dresses under neat, plain, tailored jackets. The look is a
natural continuation of Karan's exploration of ways to soften a woman's
wardrobe after the shard-sharp assertiveness of working women's clothes in
the 1980s.
Her bronze satin slip-dress at Pounds 520 and tweed jacket at Pounds 1,075
are available at Brown's in South Molton Street, London W1, and those who
love the Donna Karan look can spend huge sums on buying the original.
However, women on a tight budget will find it is the idea that matters, and
it is worth browsing round the lingerie shops (Janet Reger, Rigby &amp; Peller,
Fenwick's and Janet Whiteman at weekends in the Covent Garden market), where
petticoats and slips can be found for between Pounds 22 and Pounds 29.
Team them with neat, trim-waisted and tailored jackets. It is important to
juxtapose the boudoir tone of the lingerie with the propriety of the
tailored jacket if this look is to work outside the bedroom.
Put together carelessly, it could appear that you had forgotten your skirt
or - worse - leave you looking like a streetwalker. So choose accessories
carefully. Wear fine, skin-toned hosiery, such as Wolford's 10-denier
'Individual'. Absolutely sheer tights look tarty; opaque ones too heavy.
Choose gossamer-light shoes to give the impression that you are barely shod.
Russell &amp; Bromley has an extensive range of pretty, strappy and ribbon-tied
high sandals this season in black, bronze, silver, gold and pink, for about
Pounds 100.
Your jacket should be understated. Avoid loud, gilt buttons or 'novelty'
details. If you are reviving an old, tailored jacket, replace the gilt with
dressmakers' buttons of the same tone as the cloth or, if you cannot find
them, modest mother-of-pearl ones. Above all, grooming should be bandbox
smart and classic: that tousled 'just out of bed' style and lashings of
make-up will only induce unwelcome attention.
The new, on-the-knee length of skirt is perfect - too short, baby-doll
style, looks comical. Avoid transparency, too much lace or too many bows and
ruffles. Keep it simple.
The White House has a particularly wonderful lingerie department. The
workmanship on its embroidered slips is exquisite and there is the added
thrill of receiving your lingerie in a big, white shiny box, lettered in
gold and fastened with ribbons, which, if you live in London, is delivered
to your door free of charge by an old retainer driving a green and gold van.
Such delicacy needs finely crafted jewellery to set it off. Berlin Iron,
which imitates the filigree effect of black lace, has a compelling history.
In 1804 the Royal Prussian Iron Foundry introduced the jewellery as a
sideline. During the Prussian War of Liberation in 1813, aristocrats who had
sacrificed their diamonds and pearls for the war coffers, donned this
patriotic jewellery to proclaim their loyalty in the fight against Napoleon.
Grand duchesses and countesses appeared at political salons and country
house parties wearing black inscribed rings in place of their wedding rings,
and steel cameos depicting the profiles of their war heroes wreathed in
Roman-style laurels.
European ladies swooned with envy, for the Royal Foundry and its fellow
steelworks - Trier on the Moselle in Austria, Gleiwitz in Silesia, and Count
Stolberg-Wernigerode's at Ilsenburg in the Hartz mountains - refused to
disclose how it was done for several decades.
At the Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace in London in 1851, English
craftsmen speculated about the iron's composition. Had phosphorus been added
to the molten iron in the casting process? Perhaps the Germans used iron
without graphite; perhaps it was the inordinately high temperatures of the
charcoal-fired furnaces that allowed such precision? Would-be imitators were
confused and maddened.
Berlin iron was never diminished by the description 'imitation jewellery'.
It was far too defined and demanded such artistry and skill. That the iron
of canons could be turned into fine foliated scrolls, and gothic motifs had
Europe marvelling at its strange beauty. Even the enemy Napoleon dispatched
patterns from Berlin to Paris in 1806 to be copied.
By 1860 its moment had passed. Nickel alloys circulated as poor cousins and
the sacrificial notion was briefly revived during the first world war by the
Germans, but its heyday was gone.
Perhaps the strength of iron, lying lightly on a whisper of lace is the way
to reflect the strong and the gentle side of a woman this winter.
