<LEADPARA>  FOR once, getting a leg up on fashion doesn't require skipping a mortgage
payment.;    Leggings -- tights that end above the ankle -- just keep gaining
in popularity. Popular with dancers for years, they moved easily into the
world of exercise wear before teens recognized their inherent fashion quotient
and started tugging on leggings in place of pants.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This true "street" fashion has since been enthusiastically embraced by
adult women, little girls and the design establishment. They're hot now and
they're hot for fall, where they are a foundation for many key looks.;   
"Leggings are the pants of the '90s," says Sarah Hoskins, spokeswoman for Hue,
a major manufacturer whose products are carried in more than 5,000 stores
across the country. In the past two years, sales of leggings have increased 35
percent, Hoskins says.;    Prices start at around $10 -- not bad, when you
consider a pair of leggings often makes half an outfit. Of course, prices go
up from there, but for under $30 you can find just about any look you want --
from solid colors to Pucci pattern knock-offs. And if you simply must run up
your charges, there are luxury leggings in velvet that cost $75.;    Aside
from the comfort factor, the appeal of leggings is that they create a slim
look on most women -- particularly if you pair black leggings with an
over-size shirt, sweater or jacket that hits at mid-thigh.;    Here are some
tips for maximizing the leggings look:;    (box) Solid colors are more
slimming than patterns. If you've got long, lean legs you can wear whatever
you like, but if your legs aren't your best feature, stick to solids.;   
(box) Don't buy a pair of patterned leggings without trying them on first and
taking a good look in the mirror. That pretty pattern may stretch into a
not-so-pretty blur.;    (box) If you really like the idea of a pattern, look
for small rather than large prints, subtle rather than psychedelic colors or
lace -- which will give you both a pattern and a solid color.;    (box) If
your hips are as slim as your ankles, you can pair leggings with short tops.
If not, stick with long tops that cover any bulges or rolls.;    (box) For
day, flats or sandals are the perfect footwear. Ballet-slipper flats are
ideal.;    (box) For evening, heels can work but it's a tricky combination.
Again, take a long look in the mirror to make sure the heels, leggings and top
all work together.;    While leggings aren't for every woman, tights are. If
the idea of a break between your pants and shoes makes you uncomfortable, a
heavy pair of tights works just as well as leggings.;    In fact, designer
Louis Dell'Olio is telling people his innovative pant boots and pant heels (a
pair is pictured on the cover of today's Living section) came about in part as
a solution for the woman who doesn't like to expose her ankle. They also are
an alternative to the early-morning ritual of finding the right shade of
hosiery to go with both your shoes and your outfit.;    However, unlike
leggings, the pant boots Dell'Olio designed for the fall Anne Klein collection
are equal to a mortgage payment. Pant boots in simple stretch velvet sell for
$450 and the dressier rhinestone-encrusted pant boots cost $1,200.  </TEXT>
