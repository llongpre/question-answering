   For a time Monday the most pressing
question for some of the highest officials of the U.S. government
was: Which ones are my shoes?
   The top poohbahs of the Bush White House had to leave their shoes
at the door when they lunched in the pleasant wooden surroundings of
the Ever Spring House on the grounds of the Blue House, the
fortified residence of Korean presidents.
   That's Korean tradition. No problem.
   But when lunch was over there they were, in a neat row, the nine
pairs of nearly identical black slip-on shoes that clearly are
favored by the upper crust of the Bush team.
   Which were Secretary of State James Baker's and which were Chief
of Staff John Sununu's? Which belonged to Brent Scowcroft, the
temporarily shoeless national security adviser, and which to Gaston
Sigur, the assistant secretary of state?
   With all the dignity they could command, they stood on the porch
of the Ever Spring House, long-handled shoehorns in hand, figuring
out which shoes belonged to which feet.
   They did it, and were shod in time for the formal ceremony ending
Bush's talk and lunch with President Roh Tae-Woo, the former
four-star general who is Bush's Korean counterpart.
   Bush had no problem with his shoes. The presidential shoes were
the only ones of the American party that were laced, traditional
black wingtips.
   It didn't even matter, hoever, since a Korean aide whisked Bush's
shoes inside at the last minute, sparing the president the need to
put them on in public.
   If shoes were a problem, so were legs, at lunch. The Ever Spring
House is a handsome Korean building of 52 red pine pillars, and the
meal served inside was equally traditional, including the sitting
arrangements.
   Sitting was on seats that lack legs. The president, who stands
6-feet-2, did not know quite where to put his feet that lacked shoes.
   So he asked his host, Roh, ``Do you put your legs straight out or
do you fold them up?'' The president of Korea showed the president
of the United States how to fit his long legs under the low table.
   Bush was in Korea for a friendship stop on the way home from his
trip to the funeral of Emperor Hirohito of Japan and his visit to
China.
   He talked and lunched with Roh _ pumpkin porridge, three kinds of
fish, sliced marinated beef, dumpling soup, rice cakes and
milky-white Korean rice wine. But mostly he posed for pictures duing
his Korean visit of less than five hours.
   He posed at the airport, where Koreans waving paper flags held up
signs reading: ``Great Regard for George Bush.''
   He posed with Roh upon arriving at the Blue House, and with Roh's
wife, and when he signed the guest book. He posed during the talks,
photographers being allowed in in relays, assembly line fashion.
   He posed before lunch in the Ever Spring House, with his shoes
off. (The photographers were equally unshod.)
   He posed after lunch with Roh after both declared their talks a
great success in remarks written before the session started.
   At the National Assembly, Bush posed with the assembly speaker
and the speaker's wife. Just a few more pictures at the airport with
members of the American community and Bush was ready to head home.
   Bush went by helicopter everywhere he traveled in Seoul. Parts of
the city, including near the U.S. Embassy and the university, saw
ugly police-demonstrator clashes, but the airborne Bush never laid
eyes on an angry Korean.
