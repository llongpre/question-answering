LALIQUE is one of the greatest of names in the litany of fine French
companies that cluster together near the Madeleine in the poshest part of
Paris. It was Rene Lalique who lifted the company out of the ranks of mere
producers of glass into starry status of world-famous designers of
sought-after crystal. However, Rene Lalique actually began in a smaller way
 -with jewellery.
Marie-Claude Lalique, his grand-daughter, has now gone back to where her
grandfather started and has produced a summery, colourful collection of
crystal jewellery, photographed right. The Cabochon collection comes in 14
colourways, including bracelets and ear-rings, brooches, pendants, pins, tie
clips and cufflinks. Prices range from Pounds 345 for the bracelet and
Pounds 125 for the ear-rings to Pounds 75 for the pendant. The collection is
stocked at the Lalique shop at 162 New Bond Street, London W1Y 9PA, at
Selfridges of Oxford Street, London W1, at Mappin &amp; Webb in Regent Street
and from Mulberry Hall, Stonegate, York.
Some lovely new wallpapers from Osborne &amp; Little have been brought out.
Scaglia is a striking paper rendering of Italian marbling which comes in 20
different colourways, ranging from a rich terracotta to a heavenly pale
blue, from palest apricot to a country green. Stronger and more striking
than its forerunner, Sienna, it is an easy, almost instant way of conjuring
up some of the latest paint effects.
If Scaglia is too strong for your tastes then take a look at Pietra, also
new to the range, which imitates very soft Italianate stone effects. There
are some 20 different colours: gentle stones, beiges, greens, blues, pinks.
Both papers come in rolls of 10 m long by 52 cm wide and both sell at Pounds
17.15 per roll (inclusive of VAT) from Osborne &amp; Little's own shops at
304-308 King's Road, London SW3 5UH and 39 Queen Street, Edinburgh, and from
good interior decorators and designers.
What does a well-dressed chap wear on his feet when he is relaxing around
the house during the summer? Docksiders, that's what. Once the only shoe the
yachting crowd would contemplate, it has now become the THE snob shoe for
fashionable landlubbers as well.
The pukka original version was a soft, comfortable moccasin, treated with
oil to make it waterproof and with rubber soles to keep the wearer steady on
deck. The most noticeable trademark, though, are the eyelets and lacing at
the sides. Versions abound in almost every high street shoe shop, but
anybody who is not near a good shoe shop might like to buy the Sebago
version direct by mail from Shipton &amp; Heneage, 117 Queenstown Road,
Battersea, London SW8 (tel: 071-738-8484).
Prices are Pounds 55 for the women's shoe, Pounds 60 for men. Colours are
plain tan, two-tone tan, suede, navy and white, navy and tan. And remember -
NO socks.
