   A man who spent 20 years on the rodeo
circuit now makes his living making boots and other items that fit
the special needs of professional cowboys.
   And a few yuppies who would like to look like professional
cowboys.
   Veldon Morgan, his wife and two sons, run the Old Spade Western
Store that greets visitors to this community of about two-dozen
people in the heart of the Nebraska Panhandle.
   Handmade Morgan boots, which line the walls of the rustic store
built in 1869, run from $119 to $750, excluding custom orders.
   The newest boot, a lace-up roper, was the brainchild of the
54-year-old Morgan and a professional rodeo friend and customer.
   ``Regular cowboy boots have a somewhat flimsy shaft,'' explained
Wayne Morgan, Veldon's son and general manager. ``Professional
ropers complain that when they step, jump or fly off a horse it's
easy to twist an ankle in conventional boots.''
   A U-shaped toe and a block heel make the new lace-up boots
working boots bound to be a hit with cowboys.
   ``The professional rodeo cowboy is a honed athlete, but they've
always had to dress like a ranch cowboy,'' the elder Morgan said
Monday.
   ``To send them into the rodeo arena dressed like a ranch cowboy
is like sending a boxer into the ring wearing cowboy boots,'' said
Morgan, who was on the professional rodeo circuit for 20 years.
``The guy with the boxing shoes would beat the other guy every
time.''
   The company also has found a new market: ``one we'd never expect,
among yuppies on the coasts,'' his son said.
   ``The idea of a lace-up cowboy boot must just appeal to them.''
   So, apparently, does the gear used to carry coiled ropes and
boots and saddles, he said.
   ``We've expanded the nylon luggage line into a whole area of
backpacking, horsepacking and camping equipment as well,'' Wayne
Morgan said.
   More than 40 people work in the large manufacturing plant and
warehouses attached to the store.
   The complex has been expanded twice as the business has grown,
Wayne Morgan said. Last spring, the company bought the Laramie Boot
Co. and some manufacturing is done in El Paso, Texas.
   Handmade saddles ranging from $895 to $2,000 have become another
staple of the business. It takes 15 hours to assemble a plain
saddle's 25 to 30 parts, Wayne Morgan said.
   Craftsmen work at individual booths in the factory, concentrating
on one saddle at a time.
   ``We've tried to make things that are needed,'' Vernon Morgan
said. ``Somebody made lace-up boots back in the '30s and then quit.
We decided to pick it up again. It's a new frontier out there.''
