It is always easy to spot the Englishman on holiday. He is the burnt one,
whose clothes - an untantalising mixture of sagging swimwear and ill-chosen
separates - set him apart so dismally from most other nationalities.
Many men who dress appropriately for the office and attractively at
weekends, often abandon any vestige of sartorial savoir faire at passport
control. This is an unnecessary shame: a holiday wardrobe, like any other,
requires only a little imaginative application and a modicum of
self-knowledge.
The first rule of holiday dressing (assuming a reasonably sophisticated
destination that offers the usual mix of beach life, sight-seeing and night
life) is to remember that the same body you live with throughout the year
comes on holiday too and, thus, clothes that do not suit your shape at home
will look even worse abroad.
This may seem obvious, but I am constantly amazed by how many Englishmen
dress like clowns when on holiday. The right clothes make economic as well
as practical sense, as they will integrate happily into your general summer
wardrobe when you return home.
The second principle is to go easy on colour. The English complexion may
look peerless when celebrated by Lely or Gainsborough, but does not stand up
well to the harsh glare of the southern sun.
Unclothed, I, like many of my compatriots, bear a striking, and seriously
unappetising, resemblance to saumon en croute before it goes in the oven.
Leave bright colours to others and, instead, look at soft cream, stone, ecru
and white, with a few earth tones - such as terracotta and indigo for the
more adventurous.
A restricted colour palette will also help with the third prerequisite of
the holiday wardrobe - interchangeability. So will sticking to clothes in
plain rather than patterned fabrics. No one wants to travel with masses of
luggage, yet most people pack far more than they need. Everything described
here is designed to work together in different combinations, depending on
weather conditions and dress codes.
So we come to the components. The first necessity is a good lightweight
jacket. It is both practical and versatile and its pockets mean you need not
wear a money belt which, although undeniably useful, is grisly to look at.
The jacket should be made of linen, which is the coolest and most breathable
of cloths. Man-made fibres, no matter how advanced, should be left at home.
Some of the nicest jackets comes from Dries van Noten at Joseph. Made from
white linen, they are unstructured and cut fashionably long.
Alternatively, plump for a more robust white cotton drill blazer bristling
with antique brass buttons from Voyage, an excellent shop in London's Fulham
Road selling clothes ideal for travelling.
You also need to pack a couple of pairs of trousers. These could be the
lightweight linens, matching the Dries van Noten jacket, a pair of more
substantial cotton chinos from The Gap, in khaki, stone and salt, or, more
fashionably, a pair of draw string, pyjama-style pants from Voyage. These
would look much more up-to-the-minute than jeans and are also more
comfortable in hot climates.
When it comes to the vexed question of shorts, length is crucial. Too long
and you will look like a superannuated boy scout; too short and you appear
undressed. Opt for a beautifully-cut, mid-length pair in stone-coloured
linen by Margaret Howell. They are flattering and versatile. Passable
cheaper versions can be found at Thomas Burberry, Marks and Spencer and The
Gap.
Margaret Howell also scores well with her understated, relaxed shirts in
cotton or linen. These are cut generously, are cool to wear and can be
teamed with trousers, shorts and worn as a cover-up on the beach. Also
include a selection of classic polo shirts in Sea Island cotton from John
Smedley and plenty of white cotton T-shirts by the American manufacturer,
Hanes. Should you need clothing for a black tie occasion, an
exquisitely-made, knife-pleated evening shirt from Budd, in the coolest
cotton voile, is the most elegant thing you can wear.
A summer suit is also recommended. Ivory linen is always the most glamorous
choice. It can be worn on any occasion when you have to dress up a little
and its components can be worn separately with other items in your holiday
wardrobe. Also, with the addition of the Budd evening shirt, a corded silk
black bow tie and a pair of patent pumps, it will convert into an acceptable
tropical dinner jacket.
Designer Paul Smith has a three-button, single-breasted version that
manages, in true Smith fashion, to look both classic and contemporary. More
conventional tastes could invest in his khaki cotton version or an even more
traditional model in olive, buff or navy from Hackett, although neither of
these could be transformed into black tie.
When it comes to beachwear, I am rather tired of seeing Englishmen lolloping
about in baggy shorts. I feel that surfing jams look best on those for whom
they were originally intended. Opt instead for a pair of well-designed
classic swimming trunks.
Speedo have good styles including a model made in a special sleek
lightweight fabric developed for professional swimmers. Look out, too, for
designs by the Los Angeles Sporting Club at branches of Sports Locker. Black
or darkest navy blue, remain the smartest colour choice. Remember, white is
for exhibitionists only as it becomes transparent when wet.
The beach look is completed with a cotton singlet available in a selection
of muted hues from Voyage. This year's most trendy holiday garment is a
Kikoi from Kenya, which works as a wrap, towel, mat and, for some men,
tropical night wear.
When choosing footwear, espadrilles are de rigueur. Both Ralph Lauren and
Dries van Noten have attractive designer versions, but you are probably best
buying them on location.
You should also include a couple of pairs of Superga Originali plimsolls, in
navy, white or ecru, a washable deck shoe by Dexter, a pair of the lightest
canvas desert boots from Fratelli Rossetti and a pair of formal light-brown
lace-up shoes. I am particularly impressed with John Lobb Oxfords at Kurt
Geiger, which are elegant and light. If you want to wear sandals, Paul Smith
has a handsome classic design in brown or black leather.
A cotton sweater is a must for cool evenings - and there is little to beat
Marion Foale's classic, understated and beautifully-made knitwear. The look
would be completed by a fold-up, wide-brimmed, panama from Herbert Johnson,
a couple of silk ties from Turnbull &amp; Asser and sunglasses from the Paul
Smith range. With these purchases you will have a holiday wardrobe that,
although classic in inspiration, will be modern, practical and stylish. Bon
voyage.
