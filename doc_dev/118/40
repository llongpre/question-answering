   As the saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a
first impression. So making a good one can be a vital key in your
quest for corporate success. How you look and how you communicate
during an interview can affect its outcome.
   Among contenders with equal qualifications, the candidate who
with the best communications skills is the one most likely to get
the job offer, says Barbara McEntee, a New York City communications
consultant whose clients include some of the country's top
companies. ``In fact, the ability to communicate well is ranked as
the number one key to success by leaders in business, politics and
the professions,'' she says.
   Job-seekers can say a great deal about themselves without
uttering a word, says Richard Press, grandson of the founder of J.
Press Clothiers.
   ``Without words, a properly-dressed applicant lets the
interviewer know he will fit into the `corporate culture' of a
company,'' says Press, whose male customers include leaders of
business and industry.
   How should a man dress for an interview?
   ``Conservatively,'' says Press, in a word. ``Most corporations
value a traditional approach to work and apparel.''
   Some of his recommendations for the job applicant:
   _ Suit: Navy blue or dark gray pinstripes, single breasted.
   _ Shirt: White, with spread or button-down collar (some
companies have a white-shirt-only policy).
   _ Tie: Ancient madder foulard or patterned silk (never wear a
striped tie with a pinstripe suit).
   _ Handkerchief for breast pocket: Optional (it should complement
but not match the tie).
   Socks: Navy blue or black over-the-calf.
   Shoes: Calfskin lace-ups, well polished.
   Press says clothes should be thought of as a career investment.
``If a suit is selected with care,'' he notes, ``it will last five
or more years without going out of style.''
   Both men and women should strive for the neat, tailored look, he
adds.
   Posture also is important in the job interview, according to
Linda Fields, an expert on body language and public speaking.
   ``Slouching sends a message you're insecure and nervous and
perhaps not capable of handling the job,'' says Ms. Fields, a
principal of New York-based Fields &amp; McKamy International Speaker
Services. Sitting on the edge of the chair will help you avoid the
slouch, she says.
   Both Ms. Fields and McEntee say the candidate should maintain
eye contact and appear confident.
