When it comes to colors, few shoemakers can rival Vans. The company's canvas 
sneakers are sold in more than 30 different shades and prints, from red 
checkerboard to little green fish swimming through a sea of black-and-white 
swirls. 
</P>
<P>
But when a retailer recently placed a large order for sneakers in bright 
purple, green and orange, Vans didn't have them. But the shoe manufacturer 
promised that it could make them -- fast. 
</P>
<P>
And therein lies the Vans secret. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no shoe company that can respond as quickly," boasted company 
President Richard Leeuwenburg, sinking back onto a couch while pointing the 
waffle soles of his light-colored Vans sneakers at a visitor. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the retailer had uncovered a fashion trend that had eluded 
the rest of the shoe industry. The purple, green and orange shoes are expected 
to be so popular with the back-to-school crowd that Vans is featuring them in 
its billboard ads. 
</P>
<P>
Vans, founded in 1966 as the Van Doren Rubber Co., rose to dizzying success in 
the wake of the 1982 movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." Actor Sean Penn wore 
a pair of checkerboard Vans in the film, sparking a wave of teen-age copycats 
who snatched up every pair they could find. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to cash in on its hit product, Van Doren Rubber expanded quickly by 
building new stores -- too quickly, as it turned out. When the fad died out, 
sales plummeted and the company suddenly was stuck with the big debt incurred 
during its expansion. By 1984, the company had filed for protection from 
creditors in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. But it didn't stay there 
long. 
</P>
<P>
The company emerged a year later and was sold to a Menlo Park venture capital 
firm, McCown De Leeuw &amp; Co. Leeuwenburg (the similarity between his name 
and the venture capital firm's is only coincidental) took over the company and 
has embarked on a strategy of expansion beyond Southern California. The 
48-year-old executive said the East Coast and foreign markets are ripe for 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
He said the shoes are especially popular in Mexico and Europe. Sales in Mexico 
would have been even better, Leeuwenburg said, except for a counterfeit ring 
that flooded the Mexican market with cheaply made knockoffs of Vans shoes. The 
counterfeit ring was broken up by Mexican authorities, but not before the 
company lost an estimated $4 million in profits in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping that the counterfeiting problem is behind it, Leeuwenburg predicts a 
strong year for the shoemaker. At least one industry observer agrees. 
</P>
<P>
"That whole fashion-active look . . . is one of the biggest-growing 
categories," said Dick Silverman, editor of the 30,000-circulation Footwear 
News, a New York-based trade publication. "That market overall is in good 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
The key to the company's success, Leeuwenburg said, is the ability of the 
1,500-employee manufacturing plant to handle special orders as well as the 
company's stock. The flexibility also allows the company to quickly adopt new 
fabrics or colors into its lines so that it can stay on the cutting edge of 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the 75,000 pairs of shoes that the company manufactures this year 
will be custom-ordered. Customers can select shoes in different colors and 
shades from the company's catalogue, and retailers can place special orders for 
large volumes. Custom shoes cost $2 to $5 more than the usual $30 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
The company's most popular model, a lace-up sneaker, has not changed in design 
since its introduction in 1966. But by constantly adding new colors of canvas 
or stripes, the look can be simply updated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Leeuwenburg acknowledges that Vans is a bit player in an industry dominated by 
the likes of Nike and Reebok. The company holds less than 10% of the sport shoe 
market and has its highest profile in Southern California, where it has 59 
company-owned retail stores. Its shoes are also sold by some large retail 
chains such as the Foot Locker. 
</P>
<P>
Vans had sales of about $70 million for its fiscal year ended in May. The 
privately held company does not disclose its profits. 
</P>
<P>
The company focuses its marketing efforts on its core customer group: males 
ages 9 to 19. It markets its shoes as a unique alternative to regular sport 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
"The product itself is fun," he said.
