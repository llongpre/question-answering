<LEADPARA>  IT'S THOSE three seconds that give you pause. You've leaped face-first from
the crane platform, the elastic cords strapped to your ankles undulating
limply a few feet away as you drop. It's supposed to be about three seconds
before the cords start to stretch and slow your fall.;    Long enough for a
moment of reflection. As you drop, rock-like, at a speed now approaching 55
mph, you wonder vacantly, "What the hell am I doing, and why?"  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     What you are doing is startlingly obvious -- you are hurtling headlong
toward a patch of rocks about 200 feet below. Why you are doing it is, of
course, another matter entirely.; (hbox);    This is bungee jumping. Some call
it a sport. Some just call it crazy. Since it's commercial start in 1988, it's
caught on quickly with the thrill-junkie crowd. There are small firms all over
the country now offering jumps, including several in the Bay Area.;    The
oldest and biggest, Bungee Adventures of Mountain View, started modestly in
May of 1988, with its founders hooking their customers into the cords (used by
the military in dropping equipment from planes) and having them jump off
bridges.;    Now John and Peter Kockelman, the founders, own a 250-foot,
100,000 pound tower crane, which they have set up on private land near Tracy,
about a 1 1/2-hour drive from the South Bay. Every weekend dozens of people
gather there, paying $99 each to scare themselves.;    You may remember the
Kockelmans. They were the ones who jumped off the bridge in the television
commercial for Reebok sneakers. It aired only a few times before it was pulled
because it was . . . well, too crazy. Since then they've set a world bungee
record with a jump of 1,000 feet out of a hot air balloon, and plan a
2,000-foot jump from a balloon in August. They do exhibitions -- including one
at an Oakland Coliseum Grateful Dead show and a recent jump at a monster truck
show in SJS' Spartan Stadium -- and are developing a couple stunts for a Fox
network television show scheduled to air in the fall.;    Mostly, though, they
bring religion to folks on a hot and barren parcel of land in the Central
Valley.;    On a recent Saturday morning, there were about 40 people signed up
to jump. A group of 21 had made the trip over from Moffett Field -- Navy
fliers presumably bored with maneuvering several tons of high-tolerance
machinery through the air at excessive speeds. Larry Smith, the organizer of
the jet-jockey group, had jumped a few weeks earlier and wanted to let his
buddies -- and his girlfriend -- in on the thrill.;    Like everyone else
questioned, they had no idea exactly why they were doing this. "Sounds like
fun" was as deep as it got.;    Fun, indeed. Ask Smith's girlfriend, Kim
Harris, of Campbell. Before she went up in the crane platform, as she stood
below watching the first few jumpers step into the void, her face was an
immutable, twisted grimace. It was white-knuckled fear, and she admitted it.; 
  "Very nervous," she said.;    A few minutes later, she was pushing herself
backward off the platform for her 100-foot jump. Her eyes were shut tight and
she yelled not "Geronimo!" but "AAAYYYYYY!";    Back on the ground the grimace
was still there, but softened by relief.;    So was it scary?;    "Not so much
scary as awesome," she said, still out of breath.;    You going to do it
again?;    "No," she said quickly. "That's enough for me.";    Despite the
safety redundancies in the equipment and the knowledge that Bungee Adventures
have had no serious injuries in more than 15,000 jumps, jumping from a crane
100 or 200 feet in the air is pretty much as scary as it sounds.;    After a
short presentation on the procedures, the equipment and safety ("Keep your
arms and legs spread at all times"), they start taking people up one at a time
in the crane platform, which is attached to a steel cable hung from the very
top of the crane boom. The railed platform can be lowered or raised in a
matter of minutes using hydraulic controls on the ground.;    One end of the
bungee cord is hooked to the bottom of the platform; the other end is hooked
to the jumper's shoulder harness and rock-climber's seat harness. (For the
jumps from 200 feet, you can wear a customized ankle harness, so at the end of
the jump you're dangle upside-down.);    The trip to the 100-foot level is
quick. There's not much time to have second thoughts or take in the scenery.
In fact, it's a good idea not to dwell too much on the scenery from this
height -- it's like looking down from the top of a 10-story building, only the
building is suspended in mid-air, and is swaying gently in the breeze.;    The
efficiency of the operation is helped by The Countdown -- a transparent
euphemism for peer pressure. Once you're up there, hooked into the cords and
on the outside of the railing, screwing up the courage to push off, the
attendant in the platform requests the countdown via walkie-talkie.;    The
order is relayed to the group below, which yells in unison "Five, four, three,
two, one." At "one" you go. Needless to say, you lose face if you need more
than one countdown to launch. On this Saturday, everyone jumped at "one.";   
The trip down, those few seconds when you seem disconnected from the earth, is
like flying. It almost doesn't seem like you're plummeting like a stone. And
the cord's absorbing of your falling weight heightens the floating sensation.
There is no jerk at the end of the rope (except the jumper, of course). The
cord stretches to twice its original length, then flings you back up about 75
percent of the distance you fell. You get about five successively smaller
bounces until you're dangling at the end of the rope and the crane operator
lowers you to the ground.;    The ankle jump from 200 feet is hairier. This
time you're supposed to approximate a swan dive from a platform that at that
height feels like it's the size of a doormat. You faintly hear the countdown
reach "one" and leap, trying to hold a modicum of form as you fall.;    The
thing about the higher jump is that its longer fall gives you just enough time
-- three seconds or so -- to think about it. Perhaps flash back to the Reebok
ad, where the guy with the inferior shoes bought the farm, off camera at
least, leaving his empty shoes stuck in the ankle harness.;    The fall gives
you just enough time to think about that scene, and to reflect on your shoes,
and how tight you tied the laces.  </TEXT>
