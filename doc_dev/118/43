   LOS ANGELES -- Nike Inc. filed suit against L.A. Gear
Inc., alleging that L.A. Gear's new "Catapult" athletic shoes
infringe on patents that Nike holds.
   According to the two-count complaint filed in federal
court here, the technology that gives Catapult its bouncy
sole "embodies the invention" in the "spring moderator"
system that Nike developed. Nike hasn't used the spring
moderator in its shoes, depending instead on its "Air"
technology. "We consider the spring moderator a second horse
in our barn," said an attorney at Nike, Beaverton, Ore.

   Nike also claims in its suit that L.A. Gear's Catapult
infringes Nike's patent on a so-called "variable lacing"
system. The suit seeks an end to the alleged infringements
and unspecified damages.
   A spokesman for L.A. Gear said officials of the Los
Angeles company hadn't seen the complaint and therefore
couldn't comment.
   This isn't the first time that Nike has sued L.A. Gear
over a similarity in sneakers. Last year, Nike alleged that
L.A. Gear's MVP-1 too closely mimicked Nike's Air Jordan
basketball shoe, thereby misappropriating Nike's intellectual
property. The suit was settled out of court.
