   Christian Lacroix scored a solid success in his
first ready-to-wear show Wednesday, keeping hemlines short and
flirty.
   His show capped the first day of a big week for buyers and press
who come to view what Paris has to say about next winter's clothes.
The consensus is that many influential designers plan to keep their
skirts short. Others will set hemlines zooming down.
   Paris wonder-boy Lacroix was most successful in his daytime
clothes. His late-day dresses were inspired by Moroccan folklore
and the dance hall, a departure from the ``Arlesienne'' look of
previous collections.
   He had hinted he would show very simple clothes, but couldn't
resist some occasional fantasy, and his offerings were anything but
dull.
   The show started with a bang: hot-colored coats in all shapes
from swirly trapeze to fitted, often with big fichu collars. The
little suits in houndstooth checks or plaids with fitted jackets or
tiny boleros were geared more to daily life then some of the
costumey lines in his couture collections.
   Simplicity, however, took away none of the pizazz of these
outfits, which are priced ultra-moderately compared to his ``luxe''
or couture lines. Made for him by Genny of Italy, the ready-to-wear
ensembles are expected to sell for about $420 to $1,060.
   Top sellers in this collection may be the fabulous silk jacquard
full-skirted coat-dresses in coral, yellow and blue.
   Lacroix was ebullient, with a fun-and-games approach in hats
such as an animal-spotted stovepipe or tipped pyramids, to go with
little satin beribboned ballerina shoes.
   He went in for some of his favorite full taffeta babydoll
dresses with bows or pyramid shapes. His fluid black jersey
waistless or fitted dresses with asymmetrical hemlines, topped by
dresses with big white organza collars might appeal as well _ to
those with conservative tastes.
   The fancier numbers included some ribbed sweaters with
embroidered net tops over flying bright skirts. There were merry
widow dresses too, complete with music-hall tights that had lace
and garter effects under the full, bouncy skirts.
   In a circus vein, he branched out into some loud and crazy
patchwork dresses with woolen balls and ribbons.
   The dressier silk or velvet outfits with Moroccan jewelry and
lace embroidery did not come off as well in this collection as the
beautifully finished simpler clothes. But the audience loved it all
anyway, and gave him a big hand for his peppy approach.
   In contrast to Lacroix's exuberance, Lolita Lempicka's
collection featuring mannish suits was down-to-earth to the point
of boredom.
   In greys and black pinstripes with ties, the outfits had long
pleated or short lean skirts, some of the jackets fitted, other
spencer-style for office chic. More mannish looks featured
trousers, making a comeback.
   Streamlined long and loose princess coat dresses were winning in
sober silvery grey, black or brown light wools.
   The satin and lace evening looks made an attempt at gaiety with
their bubbling scalloped skirts, but they didn't quite hit the
mark. And lace sleeves on man-tailored jackets over knit knickers
were not quite successful in their androgynous aim for a
masculine-feminine line.
   Doby Broda went in for sweaters on more sweaters _ a pullover
V-neck topped by a cardigan with a shoulder shrug, sometimes over
cuffed long or pedal-pusher pants. Her skirt lengths in low-key
outfits of mauve, beige or violet were either well above the knee
or nearly to the ankle.
   Kimijima's ``Venetian Carnival'' show was all in good fun,
especially the evening wear with huge peplumed bright taffeta
skirts, some harlequin-motif underskirts, and embroidered fitted
tops.
   Chantal Thomass _ known as ``queen of lingerie'' _ toned down
some of her risque touches in a bright, appealing show featuring
lots of pink angora and black stockings with vine-like motifs up
the front.
   Her wrapped tops over very short lean or bubbled skirts were
offset by some ankle-length numbers, often in soft pastel knits.
Equally appealing here might be the long and full cuffed pants and
the coats _ either full trapeze style or in sober charcoal and
white stripes fitted like short redingotes.
