   L.A. Gear Inc., maker of athletic footwear, accused rival
Nike Inc. of antitrust violations and unfair competition over
Nike's alleged efforts to monopolize the high-tech basketball
shoe market.
   L.A. Gear made the charges in a counterclaim filed in
federal court in Los Angeles yesterday in response to Nike's
recent patent-infringement lawsuit against it. Los
Angeles-based L.A. Gear said it could suffer damage of more
than $3 billion over the next three years if it is blocked
from the high-tech basketball shoe market.

   Nike's suit alleged that L.A. Gear's new "Catapult"
athletic shoes use a "spring moderator" system that Nike
developed. Nike also contended that the shoes infringe Nike's
patent on a "variable lacing system." L.A. Gear denies the
charges.
   Late yesterday, Nike officials couldn't be reached for
comment at company headquarters in Beaverton, Ore.
