   Nike Inc. plans to spend 17 percent of its $30
million basketball shoe advertising budget this year on public
service-type messages encouraging youngsters to stay in school.
   The campaign comes at a time when some critics have blamed
high-priced athletic shoes for triggering crime in poor urban
areas. Some children wearing the shoes have been attacked by other
youngsters who covet them as status symbols.
   ``We know people that are in our ads are role models and kids
pay a lot of attention to our ads,'' said Liz Dolan, a spokeswoman
for Nike. ``We felt this could be a real contribution that we could
make.''
   The Beaverton, Ore.-based athletic shoemaker said Tuesday it
plans to spend $5 million to buy time for these messages and will
run them along with its regular product ads so they won't be
consigned to the least-watched times.
   Nike's public service messages would feature pro basketball
stars Michael Jordan, who has appeared for his own line of Nike
shoes, and David Robinson, who is about to turn up in a new ad
campaign for Nike's Force line.
   Robinson, who plays center for the San Antonio Spurs, told a
news conference he thought it was unfair to single out the makers
of athletic shoes for causing crime.
   ``Kids are attacking kids over a lot of things, not just
shoes,'' he said.
   He said the new ads give him a chance to become a positive role
model for children who may not have one.
   Prices for the Force line of shoes run from $58 to $135 a pair
with the major share of sales coming in the least expensive shoes,
Ms. Dolan said.
   Nike brand marketing manager Ron Hill said the Force line
accounts for about 60 percent of Nike's $250 million a year in
basketball shoe sales.
   In the $15 million ad campaign for the line, which debuts in
late April on the NBA playoff telecasts, Robinson is the amiable
focal point in his own ``Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood,'' an apparent
takeoff on the children's public TV show ``Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood.''
   In one ad, Spurs Coach Larry Brown talks about the words for
that day, ``Transition Game.''
   Brown repeatedly admonishes Robinson to run back down the court
after the opponent misses a shot as clips of Robinson playing
basketball flash on the screen.
   ``I don't think we'll have Coach Brown on the show anymore,''
Robinson tells viewers as the commercial ends.
   Another ad in the series, called ``Kick Butt,'' is being held
until fall when the new inflatable Nike Force shoes are on the
market. The shoes have a built-in pump to inflate the collar around
the ankles; the shoes replace Nike's Air Pressure shoes that
required a separate pump.
   Nike's arch rival Reebok International sells a shoe called The
Pump that is inflated by pressing a marked spot on the tongue of
the shoe.
   In the ad, Robinson demonstrates how to tie them _ ``Mr.
Robinson likes double knots'' _ and to inflate them _ ``Mr.
Robinson likes six pumps.''
   ``Then Mr. Robinson likes to take his special Nike shoes onto
the court and kick some butt,'' the athlete says in an innocent
voice.
   ``Can you say `Kick some butt?''' he asks as the words flash on
the screen, interspersed with more shots of Robinson in action on
the basketball court.
   Ms. Dolan said Nike feels viewers will understand that Robinson
is talking about playing agressively, and doubts youngsters will
read more into it.
   ``I think everybody will get the joke,'' she said.
