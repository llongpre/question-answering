<LEADPARA>  Has anybody else noticed that today's big educational problem is not that
Johnny hasn't learned to read, but that he can't tie shoelaces? Oh, eventually
he will, but not until he's 8 or 9, when he first gets shoelaces. Until that
age, children's shoes all fasten with Velcro.;   I don't know why I say
"shoes." Children don't have shoes now. They have sneakers, and not the canvas
kind we had. These may be leather, and cost about as much as new feet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I have taught a half-dozen children to tie shoelaces, not because I
remembered learning any better than their parents, but because I found a tutor
-- a helpful shoe salesman close enough in age to her first experience with
shoelaces to remember. It was completely different. You don't do each loop
separately now; you make two loops, one in each hand, then tie them together.;
  When something as elemental as the way shoelaces are tied changes in your
lifetime, you're up against a really galloping form of obsolescence. Instead
of just sitting around and talking nostalgically of things in common usage
during our parents' lifetime, we can now tally all that has disappeared during
our own.;   Some products have been outmoded by technology, which produces a
better model, and these days, does it faster than ever. Some products went out
of fashion. Some disappeared, in some cases replaced by an unexpected
alternative, part outgrowth, part chance.;   Most people think first of the
things that technology replaced with a better (faster, more accurate, easier)
means of getting to the same end. Gone, for example, are rotary dials on
telephones. Push buttons get callers to the numbers they want faster and more
accurately, and nowadays, can take them many other places besides. Records and
record players are virtually gone. Compact disc players deliver the same
music, but a better sound, and by a totally different mechanical means.;  
Cloth diapers were gone, but they're coming back. It turned out that
disposable diapers, for all their other virtues, aren't as disposable as
believed.;   Slide rules are definitely gone, replaced by electronic
calculators. But gone with them, and less easily replaced, said a scientific
friend, is something even more vital -- the need, and the continued ability,
to estimate.;   Not yet gone, but going, are passenger trains, unable to
compete with planes on speed or price or even service now. Again, something is
going with them -- leisurely travel, comfort, a close-up view of whatever lies
between here and there? And enough people feel the loss to keep a few clumsy
versions of them in business, if barely.;   Going also, if gradually, are
typewriters -- manual, electric, and even the electric versions desperately
posing as word processors. With them, of course, goes carbon paper, and good
riddance.;   With clotheslines will go clothespins; the wooden kind have
already vanished. Only poor people, unable to afford dryers, still have
clotheslines, as do the rich, who still have seasonal articles "aired" and
linens hung out for a "fresh" smell. Washtubs disappeared in our parents'
lifetime, and laundry tubs are disappearing from ours. Only a dozen of us
believe this a great loss.;   Just as many, if not more products, fell to
fashion, not technology. People simply wanted a different look, or were given
one, perhaps because of some practical advantage in cost or function.;  
Clothing styles are always changing, but rarely does a whole item vanish.
Girdles seem quite gone, and except for a nostalgic little resurgence, so are
stockings, firmly replaced by panty hose. Peds are not just gone, but almost
unknown. This is a test: What were Peds?;   Fitted bedspreads are gone,
probably because of the labor of fitting and piping those corners. Telephone
booths are almost gone, reduced to shallow body shields that save space and
material.;   Window shades have also disappeared, for no discernible reason,
considering their ineffective replacements. Eggbeaters are hard to find, also
retired unjustly. It's odd how many kitchen instruments have been replaced by
a motorized version no more effective, much bulkier, and harder to wash.;  
Explanations, even with hindsight, are often just guesswork. Many products
just evolved: A change or addition turned out to be practical for the
manufacturer and appealing to consumers.  </TEXT>
