The country hick in town has been a source of fun for centuries, from The
Country Wife to Crocodile Dundee. Less has been made of the reverse
situation but now the wellington is on the other foot. Increasingly
insulated from rural reality, the town mouse is likely to make sartorial
mistakes when faced with the countryside.
Country dressing has codes which slowly change and which may no longer fit
the townie's stereotyped vision. The owner of a West End country outfitters
who divides his time between London and the shires says he now sees far more
khaki wax and loden in SW1 than in Wiltshire.
The aims of country dressing are to keep warm and dry, and to merge
discreetly with the surroundings. There are several ways stylistically to
achieve this but all are based on the same principles - the build-up of
practical layers to vary depending on the weather.
So far, outer layers have mostly exercised the minds of technical fabric
experts. A fine membrane of waterproof but 'breathable' Goretex or
dry-cleanable Sympatex now lurks, unseen and efficient, inside both
traditional tweed shooting coats and casual padded parkas.
Tough, Goretex-lined cottons have threatened the supremacy of wax finishes
though traditionalists still swear by heavy 'farmer's weight' wax for real
rain and thorny terrain, and more colour variety has given these coats a new
lease of life.
The waterproof leather which Timberland pioneered 20 years ago now makes
coats as well as boots and ways of keeping it supple through years of
wetting and drying are being developed.
The inner layers of all-weather clothing are now coming under scrutiny.
Cotton fleece fabrics are popular to provide warmth and filter moisture away
from the body, but they are bulky. Fleece finishes are now being applied to
thinner cofton knit fabrics to wear as underlayers. So-called thermal
underwear has also evolved, with finer, softer fibres, such as silky-feeling
Tactel, and a higher aesthetic element.
In fashion's current layered mood everything can be on show not least, when
the going gets warm, a lace-edged fine-knit 'body' or a ribbed collarless
T-shirt. Knickerbox's deep green, lace-trimmed thermals or Levis' dark
rib-knits are good country colours.
Style is as essential as practicality. The art of country layers is that
they should look artless but still as if they belong together. The effect
may have taken time and thought to achieve but no-one should ever know this.
The easiest way is to pick one of the classic country styles and stick
broadly within it, adding one or two surprise elements to prevent
stereotyping.
For instance, young countryfolk like the pioneer style of padded parkas,
chunky sweaters, lumberjack shirts and tough cord or fatigue-style trousers.
Break this outfit up with a still-bulky, heraldic-looking sweater based on a
point-to-point jockey's jumper, or a soft tartan jacket that conveys more of
British tradition than backwoods US.
The popular Navajo-style mix of blanket jackets and denim needs sleek, plain
suede or Aran-pattern knits to stop it looking like the costume for a
B-movie version of Hiawatha.
The swathes of knitted layers, mostly cashmere, which the rich favour for
country wear need to be in subtle mis-matched neutrals and contrasted with a
coarser-textured, bulky overlayer to have the sharp edge of current fashion.
And the twills, cords and waxes of English country-house style shape up with
a new palette of rich autumn shades and a touch of bold knit pattern or
lumberjack check.
The quickest way to spot an untutored townie is by the feet. Fine leather
shoes well-spattered with mud are inappropriate. People whose dress code
demands polished leather can choose Sam Walker's shiny but water-repellent
brown boots, or Cole-Haan's robust but elegant-looking styles. The more
rugged still choose Timberland or the even tougher French Paraboot, footgear
of the French Foreign Legion.
