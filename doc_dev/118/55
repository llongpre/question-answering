<LEADPARA>  MEN dressing for success these days are likely to also be slipping into
comfort -- on their feet.;    Makers of men's dress shoes say the trend is fed
by a generation used to the relaxed roominess of athletic shoes, as well as by
the changing workplace of the 1990s, with its less rigid ideas about what is
acceptable in business footwear.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Toss in high technology and orthopedic improvements, and " 'the comfort
factor' is the news in men's shoes," said Tom Julian, a spokesman for the
Men's Fashion Association, a trade group.;    To compete, the 140-year-old
shoe company Johnston &amp; Murphy, based in Nashville, introduced business shoes
with what it calls a "trampoline" cushion system in wing tips, kilties,
slip-ons and cap toes that can go toe to toe with any other  dress shoe.;   
No rubber soles: The company still uses leather, as well as welt construction.
The shoes sell for about $200.;    Allen-Edmonds makes dress shoes that are
known for their cork cushioning. Virginia Riddle, a spokeswoman, said the
technology hasn't changed since 1922.;    The shoe is welted -- stitched all
the way around -- and there are no nails, metal shanks or plastic parts.;   
"Due to the recession, a huge part of our business growth in our executive
shoes has been tied to our policy of re-crafting old shoes," Riddle says.;   
It is not uncommon, she says, for customers to send back 40-year-old shoes for
repair. More than 500 pairs with an  average age of 10 years arrive at the
factory in Port Washington, Wis., every week.;    The cost for re-crafting a
pair of shoes is $79. They get new soles, heels, cork cushioning and welting,
and the calfskin uppers are completely stripped and refinished. This all takes
three to four weeks.;    Allen-Edmonds' wing tips, cap toes, loafers, oxfords
and spectators cost about $200.;    "Men who wear ours also use Rockport,
frankly," Riddle says. She was referring to a competitor that many men say
eased them into comfort shoes.;    Next fall the Hush Puppies division of
Wolverine World Wide will enter the dress-comfort race with five styles, at
$80 to $95.;    Naturalizer also is planning a men's collection that it hopes
will make compromise a thing of the past. And sport brands like L.A. Gear,
Reebok, Cole-Haan and Nike are tailoring their casual styles more for the
business setting, using sueded canvas, beefier treads and soft interior
construction.  </TEXT>
