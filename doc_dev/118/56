FT  11 MAR 93 / Asia-Pacific consumers help Singapore turn up volume:
Insatiable demand for electronics goods

MR MILIVOJ von Somogy, head of Asia-Pacific operations for European
electronics giant SGS-Thomson, has a problem. He cannot produce enough goods
to satisfy demand.
SGS-Thomson produces about 100m pieces of various computer chips each month
at its plants in Singapore. Mr Somogy says the company's semiconductor sales
in the Asia-Pacific region grew by 33 per cent last year.
'In the Singapore/Malaysia area our sales now exceed those of either France
or Britain and are the same as those of Germany. . . it's no longer a
question of orders. Instead it's a question of whether we can supply fast
enough.'
The SGS-Thomson experience is shared by several other companies based in
Singapore and elsewhere in the region.
Regional demand for a whole range of goods is soaring while in much of the
rest of the world it is stagnating or declining. More and more
multinationals are realising that it is vital to have a manufacturing base
in the world's fastest growing region.
At first foreign electronics companies invested in Singapore because of
cheap labour. Times have changed. Companies that in the 1960s were
assembling black and white television sets have evolved to design and
manufacture a comprehensive range of final products, sub-assemblies,
components and parts for both industrial and consumer electronics
industries.
More than 250 electronics companies in Singapore produced an estimated
SDollars 31bn (Pounds 13bn) worth of goods last year, 6 per cent up on 1991.
Products cover almost the entire electronics sector: Singapore now accounts
for about 50 per cent of total world output of computer disk drives.
At a time of serious investment shortfalls elsewhere, investment commitments
in Singapore's manufacturing sector reached a record high of SDollars 3.5bn
in 1992 - 21 per cent up on 1991. Of that, SDollars 1.4bn, more than 40 per
cent of the total, is being invested in the electronics sector.
Electronics companies invest in Singapore because of its industrial
infrastructure and its well established expertise in the industry. The city
state is also at the centre of an increasingly regionalised industry.
SGS-Thomson has 1,500 people there producing increasingly sophisticated
'front end' products. Another 3,200 are employed in 'back end' operations in
Malaysia. The island of Penang in Malaysia is becoming an important
electronics manufacturing centre. Parts made there or in Thailand are
shipped to Singapore for finishing.
Nike, the US running shoes manufacturer, tied up its laces and moved its
manufacturing operations across the Pacific some time ago. Of the 90m pairs
of shoes Nike produces each year, less than 2 per cent are made outside
Asia.
Du Pont is one of several chemical companies making multi-million dollar
investments in new plant in Singapore. One of the Du Pont plants will
produce key ingredients for polyurethane used, among other things, for
liners in the running shoes industry. In future, Du Pont will able to feed
Nike plants in Indonesia and elsewhere in the region from its Singapore
plant, rather than from the US.
'We've been selling our products in this region for many years,' says Mr
Thomas Springer, managing director of Du Pont's Singapore operations. 'Now
having a presence here makes sense both from a production and sales point of
view. Over the next few years we see our market in the Asia Pacific growing
at twice the rate of anywhere else.'
Eastman Chemical of the US, which has recently opened a regional
headquarters in Singapore and is looking at investments in the area, says
Asia will remain the world's fastest growing consumer market for some years.
'It's here, in the Asia Pacific, that we can see our future,' says Mr
Earnest Deavenport, Eastman's president.
An increasingly affluent middle class is fuelling consumer spending in the
region, greatly increasing demand for everything from electronic equipment
to goods derived from the petrochemicals industry.
Singapore's planners expect that the country's - and the region's -
dependence on traditional export markets in the US and Europe will diminish
as demand rises closer to home. The newly opened economies of India and
China are being targeted as the main new growth areas.
Companies such as SGS-Thomson see the changes reflected in sales figures.
'In terms of sales, our semiconductor market in the Asia-Pacific has caught
up with Europe,' says Mr Somogy. 'China is opening up and presents a
tremendous market. I don't see much change in the growth trend in this
region for the next 10 to 15 years.'
