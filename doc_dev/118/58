FORGIVE ME for returning to the theme of basics so soon. A mere four weeks
ago I was recommending to you the excellent qualities of Racing Green, a new
mail order company purveying nothing but . . . yes, basics. The difficulty
is one cannot avoid them - at the moment they seem to be everywhere.
For example, at a recent lunch at Marks &amp; Spencer I was galvanised by the
information that three simple items, the Brooks Brothers' blazer, the
gilt-snaffled loafer and the five-pocket Western jean (see below) are
responsible for Pounds 50m turnover a year. It may be the sequins and the
lace, the corsets and the zips that grab the headlines, but clearly it is
the basics that do the business.
Then there is the phenomenal success of The Gap clothing chain, which has
made its fortune out of nothing but basics: very well-made, simply
displayed, keenly priced (though in the UK they cost in pounds what they
cost in dollars in the US and consequently seem rather less of a bargain).
It arrived in the UK some four years and already has 35 branches. Richard
Hyman of Verdict (the retailing consultancy) guestimates that it does some
Pounds 40m a year.
You might think that anybody could do basics, that you hardly need involve a
designer at all. Exactly the opposite is true. It requires a finer eye, a
more scrupulous attention to detail and nuance to turn a basic into the sort
of must-have commodity that sets the tills ringing. From the fabric to the
stitching to the placing of the seams and the choice of buttons, every
single detail contributes to the whole.
Take the classic white cotton shirt. You might feel that this would be the
easiest thing in the world to find, and that when you did it should not cost
more than, say, Pounds 40. You would be wrong. This week I have looked high
and low - I have found delicious shirts, ravishing shirts, shirts well worth
buying, but the only truly classic simple cotton shirt I could find in the
shops came from Polo Ralph Lauren. It was perfect - but it cost Pounds 100.
Marks &amp; Spencer itself admits that it has not yet come up with the perfect
white cotton shirt. It has a ravishing classic shirt in heavy silk at an
excellent price - Pounds 49.95 - and just this week I spotted a splendidly
simple linen one at Pounds 35, but nowhere could I find the perfect plain
white cotton one.
The rewards for getting the basics right are enormous. M&amp;S, for example, has
been selling jeans, in good numbers, for years, but it was not until they
came up with the five-pocket Western jean at Pounds 19.99 that sales really
took off. Word got out that here was the definitive jean with the fit, the
proportions, the swanky air of a jean that usually costs double the price.
M&amp;S did the same with the classic gilt-snaffled loafer - working at it until
it had the softness, the comfort, the air of relaxed class that the customer
looks for. They priced it at Pounds 29.95 and it has been a huge
money-spinner ever since.
Ditto the blazer. The company had been selling a so-called classic navy blue
version for years but to the discerning eye the fabric was too heavy, the
shape too boxy, the buttons nothing special. But when M&amp;S brought out the
truly classic Brooks Brothers version last year the discerning shoppers'
network really began to buzz.
The demand for the carefully-made, properly thought-out classic seems almost
limitless. Lands' End, a US mail order company specialising in
quintessential American classics - the Oxford shirt, stone-washed jeans,
cowhide belts, flannel shirts, polo shirts, 'sweats' - put its toe in the
mail order market last November with a small brochure. The response was so
encouraging that just three months later it has brought out a much larger
brochure, in which the seeker after classics will find nothing fancy,
nothing that will ever, ever date, but solid quality at fair (but not cheap)
prices. For the catalogue ring 0800-220-106.
Johnny Boden is, by contrast, very, very British. An ex-investment banker
who tired of the endless search for the elusive piece of no-hassle clothing,
he decided to track them down, put them together and launch a mail order
service. 'I had always thought that if I felt like this then lots of other
people must, too.' What he wanted, and what his clothes deliver, is:
'Nothing fussy, nothing fancy and everything made to last.'
His first catalogue is a joy, featuring his own quirky essays on why he
chose each piece. It covers just basic clothing - moleskin trousers (Pounds
48); hand-crafted saddle leather belts with strong solid brass or nickel
buckles (amazing value at Pounds 18); heavy cotton twill button-down collar
shirts (Pounds 35); Shetland wool sweaters (Pounds 39); silk ties (Pounds
23); corduroy trousers (Pounds 48); 100 per cent pure white cotton boxer
shorts (Pounds 3 for Pounds 19); and, finally, the Boden bag (Pounds 90) to
put them all in. The catalogue is available from Boden, 9 Forge Court,
Reading Road, Yateley, Camberley, Surrey.
Take a look at the three basic items pictured left - a blazer, a pair of
jeans and a pair of loafers. They may look unexciting, but the sums of money
they generate is far from dull - they have in the last two years done Pounds
100m of business for Marks &amp; Spencer in the UK alone.
After knickers, socks and shoes these must be some of the most basic of all
basics. There can hardly be a wardrobe in the land that does not have at
least one of them, and most will probably have all three. They have become
the staples of leisure dressing. Every fashion editor worth her little gilt
chair has written reams on how to take the jean, blazer and loafer and make
them your own - how to dress jeans down with a white T-shirt, dress them up
with a handkerchief, soft white cotton shirt and a Hermes scarf, and so on
ad infinitum.
The problem with these kind of basics is that they often cost more than
seems proper for their understated role. Here at last are three excellent
versions at sensible prices, available in most M&amp;S branches. The Brooks
Brothers' blazer, nicest in navy but also available in black, red or beige,
is Pounds 79.95. The five-pocket Western jean is Pounds 19.99. Ladies'
gilt-snaffled loafers, in black or cream leather and red or navy suede, are
Pounds 29.95; mens are Pounds 39.95, in brown suede or black leather, and
available only in Marble Arch, London.
There is no garment more basic than the white shirt. They come in many
fabrics and many moods: crisp, quirky, diaphanous, classic, romantic, sleek
 -a white shirt can transform an outfit, set a scene. Sketched above are
just six of the best options around.

(also in silk, Pounds 140), 143 New Bond Street, London W1. (post and

gilt buttoned cuffs, by Lilli Crepon, Pounds 195 from Whistles branches (for
mail order, Pounds 3.50 extra, ring 071-935-7309). 'Prudence', a crisp white
cotton shirt with elongated collars giving it a rather Japanese air, Pounds
59.95 from The Shirtsmith, 139 Portland Road, London W11 4 LR. Mail order
Pounds 2.50 extra.
