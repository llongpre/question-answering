Q: I'm 5-foot-10 and wear a Size 10 medium shoe. What style shoes should I wear 
with my strapless white taffeta prom dress? My date is also 5-foot-10, and I 
don't want to tower over him. 
</P>
<P>
The dress has a fitted bodice and long, full skirt. I plan to wear it with a 
white lace shawl. -- L.M.

A: How about dancing the night away in ballet slippers? They're fashionable, 
comfortable and will make your date feel 10 feet tall -- well, almost. Those 
illustrated here are a new, improved version of the classic dance shoe. By Paul 
Mayer, they are designed with a ruffled top line to simulate the look of 
drawstrings and/or elasticizing. 
</P>
<P>
The shoes are available in white leather, bronze and gold metallic leather, 
black suede and black patent for $86.95. Any of the first three would look 
ideal with your dress. The shoes come in Sizes 5-10 medium at Nordstrom's San 
Francisco Center, 855 Market St., San Francisco, Calif. 94103. If you haven't 
already purchased the white lace shawl, how about giving the white a lift by 
wearing a gold shawl with gold ballet slippers?
