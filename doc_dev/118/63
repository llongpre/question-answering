<LEADPARA>  The physician examined the ill 12-year-old patient at Agnews Developmental
Center last November and decided to send her to Kaiser-Santa Clara hospital's
emergency room. Although the little girl had suffered a seizure because of her
cerebral palsy, the hospital was only seven miles away, a 20-minute ride by
Agnews' medical van. Plenty of time.;     Forty unexplained minutes later, the
van still hadn't left despite the doctor's orders. Then the driver got lost.
Twice, she drove right past Kaiser. An hour and 45 minutes later, there was
nothing doctors in the emergency room could do. The girl was dead minutes
after arriving.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>      Three other patients at Agnews -- a 1,200-bed state hospital for the
mentally and physically disabled -- also died late last year from what state
investigators say was poor patient care. In the past two years, Agnews has
received 24 citations from state Department of Health Services inspectors,
eight of them for serious offenses, and amassed more than $120,000 in fines.
Since Agnews is a state facility, the fines are not collected.;    What is
especially troubling to state investigators is the frequency and seriousness
of the offenses at a facility that for years enjoyed "a good record" for
patient care.;    "Overall, for the number of clients they serve and the
particular problems those people have, they have a good compliance record,"
said Carla Framiglio, chief of the state health agency's district office in
San Jose. But then Agnews essentially turned itself in for what Framiglio
calls "a cluster of deaths" that occurred in a one-month period.;    "These
kinds of incidents would be hard for us to find with a random check of their
records," Framiglio said.;    Charlene Stewart, clinical director at Agnews,
said, "We are concerned about situations that jeopardize individuals, and have
taken steps to provide more training and to improve emergency response
procedures.";    Many of the citations resulted, Stewart said, from the
hospital's requirement that employees "report any harm, no matter how minor.";
   Agnews' clientele consists mostly of retarded people, many of whom have
multiple medical disorders. The incidents occurred in the 366-bed skilled
nursing unit, which takes care of those with the most fragile health.;    
Started in October;  According to state records, the deaths began Oct. 28 and
continued to the day before Thanksgiving:;    (check) On Oct. 28, 43-year-old
Samuel J. LaGrande was described by three licensed nurses as not eating, too
sleepy to sit upright, pale and lethargic. That went on for 13 hours before a
doctor saw him. He was dead two hours later of pneumonia, which he apparently
had had for several days. A paramedic said she waited 10 minutes with the man
"gasping for air" while nurses got his records together.;    (check) The next
day, 36-year-old Pedro A. Halcon was found face-down and not breathing on his
bed. Though he was still warm to the touch, the staff did not use the
emergency phone line, no one attempted to resuscitate him, no one remained
with him or turned him over, and no one was there to direct paramedics to the
right room. Fourteen minutes passed before anyone tried to revive him.;   
(check) Benjamin C. Hartzell died Nov. 20 after drinking caustic detergent. He
found it in an unlocked laundry room, in a cup similar to the drinking cups
used in the hospital. He had been returned to his ward by a therapist and left
unsupervised. He was 28.;    In the case of Melissa Macy, the girl in the van,
investigators said the driver was unfamiliar with the area, had never been to
Kaiser in Santa Clara, was given wrong directions when she left Agnews, did
not have a map and didn't use the radio in the van when she got lost.;    "The
deaths all seemed to be isolated incidents," Framiglio said. "However, when we
looked into them, there were indications that the underlying causes needed
correction.";     Revamping services;  She said Agnews already had started to
draft a plan of correction, including having the facility's deputy director
restructure the entire acute services department and requiring monthly
progress reports.;    "We will monitor the plan to ensure that they carry it
out and that it is effective," Framiglio said.;    Agnews' Stewart said the
death of the man who drank the detergent was "an extremely unfortunate, tragic
accident. We've never had another accident such as this." Nevertheless, she
added, "There are procedures to safeguard chemicals, and we're reviewing and
beefing those up.";    She said Agnews has ensured that drivers have maps and
get clearer instructions.;    Stewart also said the number of deaths last year
at the hospital -- 23 -- was not out of line with other state hospitals, and
she pointed out that of the 23 deaths, Agnews drew citations in only the four
cases.;    Of the remaining 20 citations Agnews received, 15 involved alleged
abusive or careless behavior by staff members dealing with patients, abuse of
patients by other patients and an assortment of injuries, explained or
unexplained.;     Inaction cited; There was the 90-pound man, tipped out of
his wheelchair seven times in one month by another patient, asking for a
transfer to a safer place to no avail; the 16-year-old girl who was not
treated for 64 hours for a broken leg, although a nurse wrote in the record
that she suspected a broken bone; the fragile, 56-year-old woman whose foot
was twisted so violently by a psychiatric technician trying to remove her
high-top tennis shoe that both her lower leg bones were broken. His defense:
the laces were tied too tightly.;    The facility also was cited for failing
to protect a 57-year-old woman with severe mental retardation who, during her
18-year stay at Agnews, has suffered 85 incidents of injury, including
bruises, scratches, blackened eyes, a broken nose (twice), nosebleeds, cuts
and bites.;    Her most recent injury was an unexplained fractured skull.;   
State hospital authorities should have been aware she often was the victim of
assault or injury: In the 10 years she spent at Sonoma State Hospital before
coming to Agnews, she suffered fractures and numerous other injuries.;    But
at least two senior nurses told state investigators that staffing is not
adequate to care for and protect such patients.;    "One of the problems we
have here, frankly, is that the cost of living and competitiveness of salaries
don't allow us to keep people," Stewart said. "The state pays the same wage
everywhere." She said the state is studying whether Agnews' staffing -- 1,400
people in direct clinical services and 300 in administration -- is adequate.; 
   Violent teen-ager; In another case, the state claimed Agnews also failed to
address the problems of a 243-pound teen-ager who repeatedly bashed other
patients, requiring numerous trips to hospitals for treatment.;    Between
February and October of last year, the 19-year-old's record of assaulting
others included such entries as, "Numerous scalp and facial lacerations with
broken glass"; "massive head injury requiring surgery with massive bruising of
abdomen, thighs and genitalia"; "head trauma and rib fracture by stomping.";  
 The staff knew as early as November 1988, state investigators said, that
while he became hostile and frustrated because he was not able to talk well,
he could use sign language.;    "It's frustrating to us as outsiders,"
Framiglio said, "because we could see the pattern. Each time he was involved
in a violent incident, they moved him to a different unit. But that only
increased his frustration because he couldn't express his needs.;    "They
recognized his need to communicate with signs, but they didn't put him on a
unit where staff members 'sign.' " Abuses cited by state; In addition to
citations in four of the hospital's 23 deaths last year, Agnews was cited in
1990 for 20 other cases. Fifteen of them, including the following, involved
injuries or alleged abuse or carelessness.; (box)A 90-pound man, who asked
fruitlessly for a transfer to a safer place, was tipped out of his wheelchair
seven times in one month by another patient.; (box)A 16-year-old girl's broken
leg went untreated for 64 hours, though a nurse wrote in the records that she
suspected such an injury.; (box)A 56-year-old woman's foot was twisted so
severely by an attendant trying to remove her shoe that both bones in her
lower leg were broken. The man complained that the laces were tied too
tightly.; (box)Though known before her arrival to be a frequent victim of
assault or other injury, a 57-year-old woman has, in 18 years at Agnews,
suffered 85 injuries, including bites, a broken nose and a broken skull.;
(box)A 243-pound teen-ager, reportedly hostile and frustrated partly because
no staff members in his unit can communicate with him in sign language, has
repeatedly assaulted other patients, in one case causing head injury and
broken ribs by stomping on one.  </TEXT>
