<LEADPARA>  SHOPPING for shoes may be the most difficult aspect of putting together a
school wardrobe. Putting aside the question of three-figure price tags on
athletic shoes for 8-year-olds, the problem of fit remains.;   Shoes that "fit
fine" in the store seem to shrink and stiffen the first day of school. To help
your child find the right fit, consider these tips from the American Podiatric
Medical Association:  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (check) Shop for shoes in the afternoon. Even healthy, normal feet will
swell slightly during the day.;   (check) Have both feet measured while
standing. Feet are seldom precisely the same size, so buy for the larger
foot.;   (check) Avoid shoes that aren't immediately comfortable. Shoes should
not need to be "broken in." Have your child try on both shoes and walk around
the store to make sure they're right.;   (check) If there is any gapping on
the sides, slippage at the heel or less than 1/4- to 1/2-inch space between
the child's longest toe and the tip of the shoe, try another pair.;   (check)
The ball of the foot should fit snugly into the widest part of the shoe.;  
(check) For everyday wear, crepe- or rubber-soled shoes help cushion the
impact on growing feet better than dressier shoes with thinner soles. Young
girls should save their "Mary Janes" and other party shoes for special
occasions.;   (check) Shoes that tie or buckle are best for active, daily wear.  </TEXT>
