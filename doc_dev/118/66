Los Angeles' long-vanished "Old Chinatown" -- razed to make room for Union 
Station more than half a century ago -- is revealing some of its secrets to 
urban archeologists now poring over a cache of artifacts unearthed during Metro 
Rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
The finds range from the ordinary to the exquisite: a portable cooking stove; 
porcelain tea cups, rice bowls and spittoons; a woman's high-laced leather 
shoe; rusted Chinese coins; gambling dominoes and opium pipe bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands of objects, left behind 52 years ago when most of Los Angeles' first 
Chinatown was bulldozed to make way for the station, are providing experts with 
a detailed look at the life, habits -- even the diets -- of early Chinese 
railroad workers, vegetable peddlers, merchants and their families. 
</P>
<P>
The area excavated represents about one-quarter of Old Chinatown, 12 square 
blocks whose earliest residents, mostly railroad workers, arrived in the 1870s. 
In its heyday, the area was a thriving business and residential district 
inhabited by 3,000 Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
The excavation project -- begun last year and set to conclude later this year 
when all the items are dated and analyzed -- will help scholars better 
understand early Chinese-American history, said William Mason, a curator at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, which may become the artifacts' 
permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
The result may be a toppling of popularly held stereotypes: that there were few 
women in Old Chinatown (most of the early immigrants were thought to be men who 
didn't bring their families), that opium-smoking and gambling led to the 
community's demise, that everyone who lived there belonged to one socioeconomic 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"Where often it is said there were no women in Chinatown, we have proven that's 
not true," said Roberta S. Greenwood, an urban archeologist whose firm won a 
$240,945 contract from the Southern California Rapid Transit District to 
monitor digs for artifacts uprooted by Metro Rail construction. "We found 
women's jewelry, shoes, beads. Even after the Exclusion Act (an 1882 federal 
law designed to keep out Chinese immigrants), professionals and merchants were 
allowed to bring families." 
</P>
<P>
Mason said that what the archeologists didn't find is just as interesting as 
what they did. 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper articles during the area's heyday in the early 1900s described 
underground passageways leading from building to building, which the Chinese 
supposedly would use as opium dens, gambling parlors or hideaways during tong 
wars -- clashes between secretive Chinese associations. But Greenwood said she 
found no evidence of such tunnels under Union Station, although one has been 
discovered under a nearby brick building. 
</P>
<P>
Mason believes there never was a massive network of tunnels. He said the 
newspaper accounts were used as "scare propaganda. People were violently 
anti-Chinese." 
</P>
<P>
The artifacts also suggest a diverse social structure in Old Chinatown -- 
"everything from teachers to fortunetellers," Greenwood said. Most of the 
jewelry found under Union Station was "imitation jade" -- colored glass 
bracelets and beads made to look like the precious stone that was too expensive 
for most working-class Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
Yet lying nearby were vases made of fine quality porcelain -- some expensively 
glazed -- that more likely belonged to a wealthy merchant. 
</P>
<P>
"It was said that the Chinese community was . . . monolithic," Greenwood said. 
"I don't believe that for a minute. There was quite a range of occupations." 
</P>
<P>
The discoveries were made when archeologists, using old fire insurance maps as 
a guide, spent three weeks last year exploring an area east of Alameda Street. 
Metro Rail work crews at the site had removed 14 feet of soil to begin 
construction on the first stop of the 17.4-mile Red Line. There, just as 
expected, were the brick remains of old Chinese settlements, vegetable stalls 
and open trash pits. 
</P>
<P>
"It is very exciting," said Suellen Cheng, a Los Angeles historian specializing 
in Chinese-American history who was consulted during the excavation. "We have 
been talking about the history, but it was only words. Now we can see the real 
objects. It's a much more vivid history with the support of the artifacts." 
</P>
<P>
Most residents of Old Chinatown lived in cramped quarters -- whole families 
lived in the back of a store, while bachelors crowded into poorly lit boarding 
houses with little heat or ventilation. 
</P>
<P>
Because of laws preventing Chinese from owning property, most early immigrants 
paid rent to the family of rancher Juan Apablasa, who owned most of Old 
Chinatown. By 1913, the family was taking in $4,000 a month from Chinese 
tenants, according to a June, 1949, account in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
After being displaced by Union Station construction during the 1930s, most 
Chinese pooled their money, gathered their belongings and resettled a few 
blocks northwest in the area known today as Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
Greenwood, who was first hired in 1974 by state and local agencies to excavate 
Chinatowns and Chinese gold-mining camps in California, said the Union Station 
discovery is by far the largest she's come across. 
</P>
<P>
The Old Chinatown finds are not the only discoveries unearthed by Metro Rail 
digging. Other sites have yielded fossils dating back millions of years, said 
Bruce Lander, a North Hollywood paleontologist on the project. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinatown collection is being stored temporarily at RTD headquarters, but 
may be permanently displayed at the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural 
History or at Metro Rail stations. Meanwhile, Chinese community leaders are 
pushing for a new Museum of Chinese-American History to house the collection. 
</P>
<P>
News of the excavation of Old Chinatown has traveled quickly through the 
Chinese community, sparking memories -- both painful and pleasant -- for some 
men and women alive during that time. 
</P>
<P>
"We were very isolated," said David Lee, 71, whose family owned Man Jen Low, a 
three-story restaurant in Old Chinatown. "We were not able to go to public 
swimming pools. There was one day when blacks and Asians were allowed." 
</P>
<P>
But Lee also recalled times when he and other youngsters would hide inside 
stables where vegetable peddlers kept their horses, carts and produce. 
</P>
<P>
"We'd crawl underneath and steal fruits," he chuckled. "We wore coveralls with 
big pockets to put all the fruit in. . . . We had a colony of our own."
