British male professional is turning increasingly to Hollywood for a role

JUST A FEW years ago, the sartorial and professional role model for young
British professionals was Bud Fox, the aspiring arbitrageur in the film Wall
Street. Now, he has been replaced by another big-screen business figure:
Griffin Mill, studio executive in The Player. Things have changed: the
American look and lifestyle to which British men aspire is no longer Brooks
Brothers, East Coast traditional - but West Coast contemporary.
As the dress code of the 1990s has become more relaxed, West Coast has
replaced East Coast as the sartorial role model. For casual clothes, British
men are looking to the West Coast workwear, typified by The Gap chain of
fashion stores. And for business, the designer look of Hollywood executives
is replacing the formality of East Coast bankers.
Each world has its codes. There is a particular movie business style - a
cashmere/silk blend suit with pleated trousers, saved from dark-suit
conformity by a subtle stripe of, say, lilac, rust or peacock blue in the
fabric; a light, designer shirt; a Giorgio Armani tie (wider in cut and
lighter in fabric than East Coast power ties); and spectacular socks.
Magically transported to the other coast, to the corner of Wall Street and
Broadway, the Brooks Brothers-clad businessmen would stop and stare - but in
Hollywood, that is just the Uniform.
Even the lace-up black shoes. the classic half brogued New &amp; Lingwoods worn
by Tom Wolfe's Sherman McCoy in The Bonfire of the Vanities, are replaced,
by tasselled loafers - and in suede, too. When Sig Rogich, an advertising
and PR man from Las Vegas, was brought to Washington to polish President
Bush's image, his brown suede, Cole-Haan loafers immediately attracted
attention. 'I'm fighting for freedom around the world,' said Secretary of
State James Baker with mock scorn. 'So you can wear shoes like that?'
Designer menswear took off quickly on the West Coast. It was new, and it was
expensive - two endearing characteristics in LA. Italian designers use
lighter fabrics, better suited to the Californian climate than the heavier
weight of East Coast tailoring. Indeed, tailoring itself is seen as Old
World, and Los Angeles is the place furthest from being Old World.
And as with movies themselves, the entertainment industry believes in paying
for big names and trusting them to get it right. So buying top-to-toe
Giorgio Armani is the executive dress equivalent of investing in Arnold
Schwarzenegger. Arnie or Armani - it is still a low-risk investment in a
high-concept name.
The look spreads beyond the movie industry itself, even to sports
personalities such as Pat Riley, coach of the LA Lakers basketball team, who
now lectures American executives on motivation. He wears sharp, continental
suits with his slicked-back hair: he is stylish enough to have featured on
the cover of US GQ and attended Giorgio Armani's country house parties. And
when the Lakers won their second consecutive championship, the talk was not
of their achievement, but of why the coach wore a purple shirt in the
victory parade.
It was the UK screening of the hit television series LA Law which allowed
British executives to see just how sharp West Coast dressing could be. And
the BBC series Naked Hollywood, coupled with the movie The Player, have
provided an equivalent view of the professionals in the movie industry. The
result has been to legitimise West Coast style for British business.
The West Coast look shuns the traditional trappings of preppy businessmen:
no cufflinks or braces, no heavy silk power ties, no striped shirts, brogues
or three-piece suits. Instead, think in terms of lighter weight, foulard
ties with Art Deco-inspired patterns; plain designer shirts with unstiffened
collars; loafers; and lightweight suits, dark but with an intriguing stripe,
cut more loosely than traditional tailoring. The look is like the West Coast
mood - lighter, and more relaxed.
In LA, work is done at odd times and odd places: Sunday brunches, beach
parties, around the pool. No wonder the dress codes of business and pleasure
have become so intermingled. And while the lawyers and agents have relaxed
the traditional business dress code, their style is still formal when
compared with many West Coast men. The relaxed style of Californian dressing
is something of a cliche.
It is still said in New York that the edict 'formal dress' on a West Coast
invitation means that you are expected to wear socks. Informality has
reached such extremes in California that the Triad Artists agency recently
felt obliged to stem the tide and issue a dress code, banning jeans and
T-shirts during business hours.
The most informal professionals in Western business are probably those in
the California computer companies. The average age of employees at many
Silicon Valley companies is between 25 and 33. And aside from giants such as
IBM and Digital, most high-tech firms are simply too young to be shackled by
orthodoxies from the past. Polo shirts, jeans and loafers are standard
working attire. At Apple computers. staff favour T-shirts, shorts and
Birkenstock boots. 'People put in a lot of hours around here,' says an Apple
spokeswoman. 'You have to accommodate them. We have to warn executives if
outside people are coming around.'
And at Sun Microsystems, which employs nearly 7000 producing workstations,
Scott McNeally, the chief executive, says: 'We don't have a dress code. The
only rule on dress is that you must.'
It is this shifting attitude to dress which has spawned The Gap, the San
Francisco-based clothing chain which is now the second-biggest clothing
label in the US, behind that other West Coast clothing phenomenon, Levi
Strauss.
What The Gap sells is dubbed 'workwear' because its style comes from
blue-collar professions such as truck driving and engineering; yet it is now
workwear for white collar work, such as film production, media and computing
in both the US and Britain.
When their stylish, black-and-white ad campaign appeared on London buses,
you could see a traditionalist like shoe designer Manolo Blahnik wearing a
Gap turtleneck under an Anderson &amp; Sheppard Savile Row suit. In a British
menswear market looking for a way forward from traditional tailoring it was
clear that this West Coast combination of the classic with the comfortable
was going to succeed. It was timeless - the value we had been taught to look
for in quality menswear - but also relaxed, that key word both of the 1990s
and of Californian culture.
The Gap now provides British professionals with the casual basics - chambray
shirts, chino trousers and polo shirts - which are becoming increasingly
acceptable in creative work as well as at weekends. Of course, on the West
Coast those two may be indistinguishable: but that may also, eventually, be
true of the wardrobes, too.
As the LA look makes business dress more relaxed, and casual wear more
acceptable for work, there may come a point when the two meet in the middle.
Or is that just California dreaming?
