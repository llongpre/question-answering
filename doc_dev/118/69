<TEXT>     There are piles of leather everywhere. Big piles. On the floor. Spilling
out of boxes. On tables. Fat bunches of leather laces hanging from the
ceiling. Rolled-up cowhides sitting in the corner.;   A deliveryman walks in
and takes a deep breath. "That leather sure smells good," he says.;   Chilton
glances up from his workbench, but doesn't answer. He is focused on the task
at hand -- ripping a baseball glove apart. Cutting the laces between the
fingers, pulling out the inner liner that protects the palm, extracting the
padding.;   On the dusty floor around his feet, more beat-up gloves are lying
every which way. Gloves are sent to Chilton by Little Leaguers, high school
and college players, rank amateurs and major leaguers.;   Baseball glove
owners in the United States, Argentina, Liberia, the Soviet Union, Israel,
Nicaragua -- they all send their gloves to Chilton because they trust him to
make them better than new. Chilton spent Tuesday afternoon at Candlestick Park
and expects Giants outfielder Willie McGee to send his glove to Fremont in the
next few days. All these people trust Chilton because he is a legend, once
written up in Sports Illustrated, because he's that good. And Chilton, who
never forgets a face or a glove, upholds his end of the deal because he is,
after all, the Gloveman.;   "See, a glove is something sacred, man," says
Chilton, a soft-spoken, Mack truck of a man. "A glove is a boy or a young girl
who's playing ball's first love. It's their first best friend.";   A child's
glove hangs from the pegboard next to Chilton's long-armed sewing machine. The
glove is a Cal Ripken Jr. model, a Rawlings, about 5 years old. Chilton picked
it up at the San Jose Flea Market for $2 shortly after his son, Scott, was
born. Chilton pulled it apart, cut it down to fit Scott's hand, rebuilt it and
gave it to Scott, who is 5, about a year ago. Now when Scott comes to the
shop, "He looks to see if his glove's still there, and if it's been moved, he
wants to know who moved it and whether they had permission to move it.;   "We
get a lot of gloves in -- look at this one here." Chilton picks up an ancient,
worn-out black mitt. It's a first baseman's glove, a model known as the Claw.
"An old Rawlings. And you might ask, 'What does anyone want to keep that for?'
And the reason is, he wants to give it to his son or his grandson. And his
grandson probably won't use it, but he'll have the glove that his grandfather
used. It brings back that what used to be.";   The phone rings.;  
"The-Gloveman-May-I-Help-Yuh," chants Chilton into the receiver. "It'll cost
you $66 and we give you a two-year guarantee. Turnaround time is 20 days or
less. Enclose a check for $47.50 and we'll bill you the balance. Right. We go
through a glove completely.";   He hangs up the phone.;   An old friend named
Daryl Auten has walked in with his 7-year-old daughter, Brieanne. Chilton and
Auten played outfield for the Santa Clara University baseball team that ranked
No. 3 in the nation in 1971. Chilton sometimes still wears a red SC baseball
cap as he works in this crowded but friendly workshop that attracts as many
visitors as a country store.;   The morning runs its course; then it's the
afternoon and Chilton is still cutting, stitching, massaging leather, making
things perfect. And slowly he starts to tell his stories, growing louder and
more loquacious, talking about his granddad, Otis Scott -- "the only man I was
ever afraid of." He talks about being a loner and still enjoying every minute.
About having few expectations and a similar number of obligations. About
making your own way in life.;   "I wasn't raised on can't," he says.;  
Brieanne is mesmerized.;   Auten's three older children, two sons and a
daughter, know that feeling. They have spent a lot of time in this shop with
Chilton, talking baseball and listening to his stories. Friends, some 90 years
and older, come down from Oakland and Sacramento on Thursdays to play
dominoes. Teen-agers drop by at night to discuss baseball fundamentals with
Chilton, who still umpires semi-pro games on weekends.;   Other teen-agers
come by for "attitude adjustment." That's because Chilton, 42, is an ex-youth
counselor with advanced degrees in social psychology and philosophy. He is a
stabilizer who still runs interference for so-called "troubled kids" with
their parents, schools and the courts.;   He is on the board of directors of
College Bounders, a youth counseling group in Oakland. Chilton calls it "an
extended family." There are 17 young men around the Bay Area, ages 16 to 26,
who when they see Chilton, tell people, "That's my dad.";   "I normally pick
up a new son, two new sons, every year, man," Chilton says.;   The love of
leather; Brieanne settles into her father's lap and listens to Chilton talk
about growing up in Arkansas, working as a migrant fruit picker in California
and fixing baseball gloves.;   "To get off into baseball glove repair, a
person has to love leather -- you can't come in here loving silk. I love the
strength of leather, I love the feel of it. And in relation to gloves, I enjoy
doing this because the expressions I get off people's faces when they come in
here say, 'Hey man, you brought my baby back to life!';   "See, a glove can
tell a thousand stories. I had a dream after the Sports Illustrated story: I
walked into the warehouse; there were all these stacks and stacks of boxes and
I heard these voices. And what it was was the gloves were talking to each
other. They were talking Spanish and German -- you know, gloves are sent to me
from 14 different countries -- and I thought, 'Aw man, these gloves are going
crazy.' And there was this box doing the translating. And one glove says, 'I'm
out of here Wednesday.' And the other glove says, 'Well, I'm here until
Tuesday, but it's been nice being here with you at the Gloveman.';   "And I
told my wife and she said, 'Hey boy, these gloves are making you crazy.' And I
started thinking about all the postage involved and how much time it would
take to send all those gloves back to their owners. And I got to thinking, 'Is
it worth it?';   "Yeah," Chilton answers himself, "it's worth it.";   Chilton
has been fixing gloves full time for a decade. After the 1987 Sports
Illustrated article, he and his staff of "technicians" repaired about 500
gloves a month and marketed Chilton's own line of custom-built gloves.;  
Chilton was inundated and soon found himself talking shop with a stream of
strangers who dropped by the shop: "I've had suckers who come in and talk to
me for a couple of hours, and they turn around and open up a shop in Union
City or Sunnyvale and they say, 'I was trained by the Gloveman!' They learn
how to lace a glove, and all of a sudden they're experts. You wouldn't believe
all the experts we have in the Bay Area.";   Also in 1987, Chilton was
divorced. For personal and financial reasons, he cut down the size of the
operation over the past three years. Now he's talking about gearing up again,
bringing his technicians back around the clock, even moving part of the
operation down to Arkansas. He wants his two young sons to know the aging
aunts and uncles who still live there, and he wants to train five apprentices
to carry on the glove-repair tradition: "But no more than five. I don't want
the quality and the workmanship to get watered down. I don't wanna be the next
Colonel Sanders.;   Here comes the philosophy; "What is success in America?"
he asks. "Is it me driving a Rolls Royce or owning a $2 million house? Is it
me having a bunch of college degrees? Success to me," he answers himself, "is
being able to feel good about what one's doing at that time. Success to me is
being able to enjoy every minute, every second that God gave you while you're
here. Success is being able to appreciate your own experiences. For me to sit
back on a river bank with a fishing pole or to ride down the freeway at 2 a.m.
with the windows down and thinking about what I'm going to do when I get back
to Fremont.;   "Success," Chilton goes on, "is knowing how to handle a peace
officer when he tells you to get out of your car and spread-eagle. Success is
understanding that there's no job that's more important than you. And success
is understanding what the word D-E-B-T means. I know what it means. Success is
just being able to control as much of your own destiny as possible.";   Lee
Chilton was born in Arkansas in 1949. The looming figure in his life was his
grandfather who, Chilton says over and over, taught him the value of brutal
honesty and unconditional love.;   "Granddad was a farmer. And he made
cross-ties for the railroad which quite a few black folk did down home at that
time. Came to California and we wound up being migrant workers. And nobody I
knew could beat me picking anything. People used to bet money on me. Wasn't a
bracero could beat me picking peaches, plums, tomatoes, topping onions,
chopping cotton. I don't care what it was; I wasn't going to let you beat me
doing it. Always had a hustle. I used to shine shoes. Made a lot of money, but
now no one wears shoes. Businessmen going to work wearing Reeboks.";  
Independent early on; Attending high school in Stockton, Chilton was the
independent type. He used to install stop signs on hazardous street corners
without bothering to tell anyone in the city government. He drove a '55
Oldsmobile and a couple of girls named Wanda and Carutha refused to ride with
him because it was too beat up. Then, one rainy afternoon, the girls, finely
dressed, were desperate for a ride and Chilton told them, "A raggedy ride
beats a dressed-up walk any day, and you can't ride in this car today.";  
Chilton pitched on the high school baseball team. In 1965, he took $30 he
earned mowing lawns and invested it in a Wilson A2212 baseball glove. He
couldn't believe it when the glove's lacing broke, so he sent it back to the
manufacturer and never saw it again. This is when Chilton's grandfather gave
him a few bucks to go down to the Goodwill store and buy a few secondhand
gloves. Chilton turned the gloves inside out, figured out how they were
constructed, and started fixing gloves for his buddies.;   It was a hobby he
maintained through his undergraduate and graduate schooling in the Central
Valley, San Jose, Texas and Arizona. Chilton eventually earned five graduate
degrees and became a community relations specialist for the City of San Jose.;
  In 1981, just 31, he got sick. Some doctors said he had suffered a mild
stroke; others said he was simply stressed out. In any event, Chilton was
temporarily paralyzed on his left side and it took about 18 months for him to
recover. He took his ex-wife's advice and went full time with the glove repair
operation he had in his garage.;   "The world travels a little too fast for
me," Chilton says quietly, "and baseball repair is something that allows me to
take it easy and enjoy myself.";   Brieanne is still sitting in her father's
lap, listening.;   "The funny thing is, I get at least one guy coming in here
a week to make me rich. Everybody's got a plan. But I tell you something. I
been doing so much with so little for so long, should I start making some real
money, I wouldn't know what to do with it." He pauses. "I'd probably go out
and buy me a whole lot of bubble gum.";   He and Auten break out laughing.;  
Chilton continues: "Some dudes come in and tell me, 'We're gonna mechanize
this for you. We'll set up snappy machines, we'll do this, we'll do that.' And
I'll say, 'Well, that's fine, but you can do that next door, 'cause in here
people are going to use scissors until I decide to use snappy tools.' And I'm
pretty sure I haven't changed that much to this day.";   He turns to Auten:
"Have I changed that much?";   "No," his old teammate tells him, "I'm pretty
sure I still don't understand you."  </TEXT>
