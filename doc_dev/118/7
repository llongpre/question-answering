   Down in south Louisiana, where children
grow up hearing about the voodoo queen Marie Laveau, even judges
seem to feel it's better to be safe than sorry where curses are
concerned.
   District Judge Joel Chaisson, not wanting to take any chances
with powers stronger than his, did what any born-and-bred south
Louisianian could be expected to do.
   Chaisson ordered Ronald P. Edwards, 27 of Des Allemands to
remove a curse as a tongue-in-cheek special condition of probation
on charges of simple battery and disturbing the peace.
   Edwards, who pleaded guilty to both charges Friday, was arrested
the day before after a ruckus at his house. As he was being taken
to jail, Edwards warned that he had cast a spell on the arresting
deputy sheriff and on the judge who would hear his case. Both would
become paralyzed soon, he predicted.
   In court, Chaisson asked Edwards if he practiced voodoo. Edwards
said it was just a joke.
   The judge fined him $200 and put him on a year's probation with
the curse removal as a special condition of probation.

   An all-sports shoe allowing an athlete to
change soles to play different games, super-scrub skates, and an
adjustable ski pole were some of the gadgets on hand as young
inventors got to show off their stuff.
   Other inventions on display last week at Oakdale Elementary
School were a bathwater temperature-control device and a children's
zipper tie that makes adjusting the tie easier.
   Approximately 125 Oakdale Elementary School sixth-graders
participated in the program. Those judged the best get a crack at
state and national competitions.
   ``We want the kids to have fun and use some of their
creativity,'' said sixth-grade teacher Christie Webb, the event's
organizer. ``They took a problem and thought of something to make
it easier.''
   Steve Symkoviak, 12, inventor of the all-sports shoe, explained
how screw holes in his sports shoe allow an athlete to put on
different kinds of soles for different kinds of athletic events.
``I got tired of going on a trip and having to take so many pairs
of shoes. Now I can just take one pair and the rest of the soles.''
   And here's Parker Shaw, 12, on the super-scrub skates: ``These
are a lot more fun than a mop because you can slide around and the
floor will be cleaner because the legs are stronger than the arms.
I thought of the idea when I spilled something on the floor.''
   Amberly Richards, 11, inventor of the adjustable ski pole, said
it will allow children to use the same poll as they grow, adding,
``This invention will save them a lot of money.''
   A little bit of everything was displayed, from real technical
inventions like the earthquake-proof ``anti-jar-juggler'' to
down-to-earth simple things that only a child would think of.
   ``I'm excited. This helps school be a little bit more fun,''
said Webb. ``It's neat to see some kids you have never seen the
light turn on get excited over something like this.''
   The Invent America program is a national awards program designed
to stimulate invention and creativity among children. More than
80,000 schools around the country and 31 million children and their
teachers are invited to participate nationwide.
