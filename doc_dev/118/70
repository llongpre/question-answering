Maria Anderson came all the way from Minneapolis to outfit her daughter's 
wedding at one of Filene's Basement's legendary bridal gown sales. Every price 
tag in a sea of white lace and pastels had been slashed to $199. 
</P>
<P>
Although she and her daughter were weary, they posted trophies: a flowing 
antique white extravaganza (original price: $2,000), a silver-gray gown (from 
$850) and four square-necked, peach-colored bridesmaid's dresses (each reduced 
from $700). 
</P>
<P>
Filene's Basement's bridal sales occur two or three times a year. Sales of 
women's designer-label suits ($150 to $285 reduced to $75) are held twice 
yearly, and sales of men's designer suits ($185 to $235 reduced to $79) are 
held once a year. Discounts of 50% to 70% on casual to formal clothing and some 
home accessories occur every day. 
</P>
<P>
Although some of its items are available in limited sizes or colors and labels 
are often removed, Filene's Basement draws shoppers from around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The granddaddy of New England's off-price stores, Filene's Basement was founded 
by Edward A. Filene, who sold marked-down goods in the basement of his pricey 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
Filene's Basement became a separate business in July, 1988, with its own chain 
of stores. The flagship is still in the basement of Filene's at 426 Washington 
St. Seven other stores are in the Boston environs: Framingham, Burlingon, 
Danvers, Dedham, Saugus, Braintree and Kingston. Still others are elsewhere in 
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
Don't believe for a moment that the Andersons' pre-nuptial trek to Filene's 
Basement was unusual, because discount shopping is one of New England's top 
tourist attractions. In addition to Filene's Basement, hundreds of discount 
outlets, selling everything from shoes to top-quality porcelain at 30% to 50% 
off regular retail prices, abound. 
</P>
<P>
Outlets at factories or in nearby stores offer shoppers an opportunity to see 
how goods are made. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheese Outlet, 398 Pine St., Burlington, Vt., is in a huge 120-year-old 
brick building next to a factory that gives mouth-watering tours. Happily, the 
firm sets out samples of Vermont cheddar, gouda, feta and all sorts of imported 
cheeses. In all, the store carries about 100 varieties of cheese at low prices. 
Creamy French brie is only $1.99 per pound. 
</P>
<P>
General Manager Steve Lidle says that the Cheese Outlet also sells other 
gourmet goodies. "Three times a year we offer pure Vermont maple syrup for $20 
per gallon, and there's always a selection of about 30 close-out and 
private-label wines for $3.99 each, or two for $7. We ship everything, except 
wines, so shoppers don't have to carry their purchases, including our crustless 
Vermont Velvet cheesecake." 
</P>
<P>
About 50 miles to the north, Johnson Woolen Mills Factory Store, on Main Street 
in Johnson, Vt., punctuates an otherwise rural experience with some high-tech 
weaving and wonderful bargains on hundreds of woolen and natural-fiber 
blankets, sweaters, outerwear, sportswear, mittens and fabrics. These are sold 
at 20% to 40% off list. A seconds and samples section also reduces prices, by 
50% to 70%. 
</P>
<P>
Discounters, offering overruns or second-quality local and imported goods, put 
otherwise obscure towns on the map. In Mount Washington Valley, N.H., the 
stretch of Route 16 near North Conway Village boasts 39 discount outlets. 
</P>
<P>
Looking for home accessories? You'll find Corning/Revere, Dansk, Gorham (china, 
crystal and Norman Rockwell prints at 60% off list) and Alpine Sheets and 
Towels (Fieldcrest and other labels). For clothing: Izod, J. Crew, Jonathan 
Logan, Calvin Klein, Evan Picone, Guess?, Leslie Fay, Liz Claiborne, London 
Fog, Levi Strauss, Timberland, Andrew Marc, Aileen, Anne Klein and others. For 
shoes and accessories: Swank, Converse, LeSportsac, Johnston &amp; Murphy, 
L'Eggs/Hanes, Dexter Shoes, Reebok/Rockport and others. 
</P>
<P>
Some chain store discounters have identical stores in several popular discount 
malls. Anne Klein, Calvin Klein, Harve Bernard, Dansk, American Tourister and 
Villeroy &amp; Boch are frequently featured. 
</P>
<P>
For out-of-towners, discount malls are best bets for variety of merchandise. 
Connecticut's two examples of the well-groomed New England mall are easily 
accessible from New York City by car or public transportation:
