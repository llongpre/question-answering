<LEADPARA>  MISSY PARK was tired of wearing athletic apparel designed with men in mind.;  
 "Most manufacturers cater to male customers," said Park, the 28-year-old
president of Title 9 Sports, a mail-order company based in Berkeley that
features workout gear for women. "Their products are basically down-sized
men's athletic clothes in pink."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Her catalog offers "woman friendly" products such as tights with built-in
liners to provide underwear without panty lines, two-piece bathing suits
designed for swimming laps and sports bras that don't bind.;    "There's a
real niche out there for women's sporting apparel that works," said Park, a
former basketball, tennis and lacrosse player for Yale University, who started
the company three years ago.;    A recent survey of 10,000 homes by the
National Sporting Goods Association found that 22.5 percent of women 25 or
older participate in a fitness activity at least twice a week. Only 18 percent
of men report exercising as often.;    That means a growing market of female
consumers. "Right now I don't think there is any major athletic company that
is not sensitive to the fact that women are important to business," said
Thomas Doyle, director of information and research for the association.;    As
women have taken a leadership role in activities such as aerobic dance and
exercise walking, some women entrepreneurs have concentrated their efforts on
designing and marketing athletic apparel for bodies like their own. These
smaller companies are successfully competing for their share of the market.;  
 "There's a lot of good products out there," says Ellen Wessel, president of
Moving Comfort, a manufacturer of women's running apparel. "There are just not
a lot of companies making women their focus.";    In 1977, Wessel was a
marathon runner logging 70 miles a week but was unable to find clothes that
fit. "You go through a period of time thinking you're too fat, too thin, too
this or that instead of realizing the clothing is really the problem," Wessel
recalls.;    She ended up designing her own running clothes, and the styles
were so popular that she started a custom clothing business. With a
professional seamstress as her partner, Wessel began making clothing for
sporting goods chains such as Lady Foot Locker and Herman's World of Sporting
Goods.;    Last year the company, based in Springfield, Va., had sales of $5
million. "I guess we're just lucky to be part of the baby boom bulge. We
represent a lot of people's lifestyles," said Wessel, who is 39.;    Another
designer who was at the forefront of such lifestyle changes was Gilda Marx, a
mother and housewife who began teaching exercise classes from the patio of her
San Fernando Valley home in the '60s.;    Over the years the 54-year-old Marx
has taught her brand of aerobic exercise to celebrities including Jane Fonda,
Richard Simmons, Barbra Streisand, Shirley MacLaine, Brooke Shields and
Madonna.;    In 1977 Marx introduced the Flexatard, a four-way stretch knit
garment that molds to the body. It proved to be a flattering style for women
with imperfect figures. "I really tapped into the psychology of the market,
knowing that if a person feels good and likes the way they look, they will be
much more disciplined regarding the activity," Marx says.;    Gilda Marx
apparel is sold in 5,000 retail outlets and had sales of $38 million last
year. Her unitards and capri tights have provided inspiration for Donna Karan,
who recently bought a half dozen unitards and $500 worth of capri leggings in
Marx's New York showroom.;    Meanwhile, success in the competitive athletic
market, which includes the likes of Nike, Reebok, Avia and Hind, also means
keeping up with the latest fabric technologies.;    Marx recently introduced
Breathables, a liner with a Coolmax panel developed by DuPont that wicks
moisture away from the skin. The material, incorporated into all of Marx's
silhouettes, has been shown to be successful in helping prevent yeast
infections.;    Marx points to the Breathables line as an example of why it is
important to have women designing for women. "It is a sensitive conversation.
Why would a man think about it? I, being one who wears tight-fitting clothing
when I exercise, would think about it and want to help women with this
terrible problem.";    Likewise, some women become just a bit tongue-tied
trying to describe to a 16-year-old boy at the sporting goods store what type
of support they need from a sports bra.;    "I always thought a good pair of
shoes and a good bra are the two things women need most when they do any kind
of athletics," said Hinda Miller, a former theatrical costume designer and
president of JBI Inc., creators of the original Jogbra.;    Miller didn't have
much trouble finding a pair of shoes, but she had a tough time finding a bra.
In 1977, Miller and partner Lisa Lindahl created the first Jogbra by sewing
two athletic supporters together.;    Today, the Jogbra is made of a stretchy
cotton-Lycra blend that fits over the head and has crossed straps in back to
avoid slipping. Other features include no hooks and seams sewn to the outside
to avoid chafing.;    In July, the independent company, based in Williston,
Vt., became a division of Playtex Apparel Inc. The Jogbra is available in
sporting goods stores, while an early version of the Jogbra is part of a
costume display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  </TEXT>
