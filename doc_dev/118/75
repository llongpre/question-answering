EVENING wear for men looks deceptively simple. The usual kit seems
well-defined, with ground rules honed by tradition. In reality, it is easy
to get it wrong.
The black tie is a relatively new tradition. It was first worn by Edward VII
when he was Prince of Wales and became popular in the US around 1910 when
the Tuxedo Club was started in upstate New York. Between then and now, posh
parties have seen everything from the Sergeant Pepper velvet patchwork of
the 1960s to serious black silk polo-neck sweaters sported by 1980s'
advertising men with their Japanese designer suits.
These days when the invitation says 'Black Tie,' it means exactly that.
White tie (and tails) are commanded rarely these days, except for livery
dinners, hunt and Highland balls. Cocktail parties and smarter dinners are
the occasions when you can afford to be more adventurous.
When choosing a dinner jacket the quality of the fabric is important and
generally you get what you pay for. Suits are best tailored from barathea (a
combination of wool and silk); silk alone is too shiny and you could look
like a second-hand car salesman. Revers (lapels) on the jacket and the
discreet strip down the outside of the trouser leg are best when cut from
fine corded silk.
Jackets can either be single or double-breasted depending on your taste and
figure. Traditionally they should be without vents and are a little shorter
than those worn every day. Collars are best cut with classic revers and not
with the sort of shawl or roll collar favoured by Glen Miller.
Trousers are lightly pleated, high-waisted and always worn with braces.
Cummerbunds are purely decorative and should be looped through a tab at the
back of the trousers so that the two do not come adrift.
They were originally designed with a small pocket hidden in the pleats to
house a fob watch or some snuff when waistcoats went out of fashion. I
prefer cummerbunds and ties to be in black corded silk and would only choose
purple or emerald for whacky braces or satin linings.
Nearly half of Moss Bros customers are brave enough to buy bow ties that
they tie themselves; an adjustable tie could be tied for you in the shop but
these cannot be worn with a wing-collared shirt. A good standard width for a
tie is 2 1/2 inches although Turnbull &amp; Asser, with many American customers,
stand by a good three inches. Avoid made-up ties - they always look like
propellers.
Shirts are classier in a pure fibre, either silk or cotton, in white or
cream. Once again simple is best; forget frills, the front could either be
pleated or made out of marcella (a stiffish honeycomb cotton). Wing collars
must be detachable as they cannot be starched successfully if they are not,
but a plain collar is perfectly alright. Pocket handkerchiefs are perfect in
white cotton.
Shoes can be surprisingly flashy - black patent with a flat gross-grain bow
on the front can look good but if these are too foppish for you a plain
black leather lace-up will look just as good. Velvet slippers are very chic,
with or without monograms, but are best with a velvet smoking-jacket.
If it isn't a 'black-tie' do what do you wear? Much will depend on your
personality and what sort of 'do' you expect it to be. For a dinner after a
day out shooting in the country velvet smoking jackets (with black evening
trousers and velvet slippers) are generally worn; these are usually
double-breasted with frogging and the most popular colour is a dark forest
green.
If this look is too fogeyish for you there are many alternatives. A young
friend wore his dinner jacket and bow tie with a pair of studded black
leather trousers to a trendy Paris party; it looked perfect.
If you do not attend many formal evenings it is a good idea to buy a plain
black lightweight wool suit to wear with a white silk shirt and black bow
tie, or with an exciting silk waistcoat.
Many younger designers are making classically cut single-breasted velvet
suits which look very lush for London nights out. Richard James of 37a
Savile Row, London W1, for example, has wonderful velvet jackets for Pounds
295, and matching trousers for Pounds 125. Frilly shirts are fun but should
be worn without a tie and if you choose a brightly printed silk bow it is
best not to team it with a matching cummerbund or waistcoat - too much fun
all at once looks a bit frenetic.
Waistcoats which are not part of three-piece suits have made a comeback.
They are often works of art and, if the fabric on the back is the same as
the front, need not be hidden under a jacket.
With black tie, cuff links, dress studs and watches are the only acceptable
jewellery. Antique gold oval cuff links are my favourite but they are rather
expensive. However, there are lots of cheaper alternatives. Most shops sell
coloured silk-knot cuff links and gold plate has become so sophisticated it
is difficult to tell the difference from 18 carat.
WHERE TO SHOP:
Moss Bros, 27 King Street, WC2 (and 90 branches nationwide) has 1,000 dress
suits to fit everyone from giants to jockeys. As it also sells a large
number of designer evening suits off-the-peg it could be a useful place to
choose what style and shape is best for you. Keep away from its own-make
jacket at only Pounds 79. Those who can raise the Pounds 1,295, its most
expensive suit (by Brioni, one of the best Italian ready-to-wear tailors)
will get a very made-to-measure look for their money.
There is a lot to choose from in between. Look out for Jasper Conran, Zegna,
Canali, Hugo Boss, and, for the more generous or 'mature' figure, Chester
Barrie (which sells all over the country as well as from its own shop in
Savile Row).
Moss Bros also stocks a good range of shirts, including my favourite
Pancaldi in cream silk at Pounds 249.
Harrods and Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge both stock good selections of
evening wear. Harrods has a good velvet smoking jacket in several colours
for Pounds 195, a large selection of evening shirts including a cotton one
of its own make. It looks classic when worn under a jacket but has a Rupert
Bear print on the back.
Harvey Nichols stocks the best classic makes as well as Montana (a slightly
sharper cut), Valentino, Adolfo Dominguez and Armani. Emporio Armani has a
younger and cheaper range and has shops on Knightsbridge and in Long Acre,
Covent Garden where a dinner jacket will cost about Pounds 450. Cerruti, who
dressed Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Irons for the Oscar awards, has an
elegant line; its own shop is at 75 New Bond Street. English Eccentrics
designs a good range of silk waistcoats.
Austin Reed, 103 Regent Street, although better known for business suits
also sells tailored evening wear or it will hire out the complete kit,
including shirt and tie. It would cost Pounds 33.40 to rent a
single-breasted version for the weekend, and an extra Pounds 5 for double.
Austin Reed has a good selection of Chester Barrie, Hugo Boss and Oscar
Jacobson and my eye was caught by some jolly tartan wool waistcoats priced
at Pounds 59.
At the cheaper end Debenhams in Oxford Street (and lots of branches
nationwide) has its own make, IQ, and sells a DJ with satin lapels for
Pounds 130. Turnbull &amp; Asser at 70a Jermyn Street, London SW1 sells superb
velvet smoking jackets at about Pounds 650 and Tuxedo suits for Pounds 900,
both off-the-peg; there are ten different varieties of dress shirts to
choose from and one of the best is in thick, cream tussore silk with French
cuffs at Pounds 175.
New &amp; Lingwood at 53, Jermyn Street has black patent pumps for Pounds 95 and
Oxfords for Pounds 145, but across the road my favourite shoe shop,
Trickers, sells similar classics for a little less. It also has an unusual
black patent loafer with a silk tassel at Pounds 87.70 and will make
tapestry slippers.
For interesting waistcoats, jackets and shirts try Favourbrook, 19-21
Piccadilly Arcade. There are waistcoats in every fabric from rich brocade to
moire silk and to suit everybody from 90-year-olds to Royal pages. No more
than four are made from the same design. Prices range from Pounds 70 to
Pounds 350 for the most unusual one: appliqued with pheasant feathers.
The original waistcoat king is Tom Gilbey, its Waistcoat Gallery is off
Regent Street at 2 New Burlington Place, London W1. It boasts a selection of
1,001 different styles and fabrics and also sells through Liberty, Harrods
and Harvey Nichols. A rather special one in paisley sari silk will cost
Pounds 175.
Smart second-hand clothes were made acceptable by Hackett, 137 Sloane
Street, London SW1, 117 Harewood Road, SW6 and other branches.
It now sells only new versions of the classic cut and all styles are Pounds
395 and good value.
Bertie Wooster, 284 Fulham Road, SW10 has taken on where Hackett left off.
Second hand DJs are Pounds 95 but the quality varies, so you will need to
check what you buy. The owner, George Cazenove, found a beautiful velvet
smoking jacket which had originally cost Pounds 2,800 from Huntsman - He
saved it for himself.
Finally, if you are wondering what to give a special chap this Christmas, a
black cashmere top-coat would be splendid - it could be worn as easily with
less formal suits as with evening wear. Aquascutum of 100 Regent Street, has
the most exotic at Pounds 1,220 but Selfridges of Oxford Street, London W1
has a classic double-breasted version for Pounds 499 and a wool / cashmere
mix for Pounds 225. At Malcolm Levene, 13-15 Chiltern Street, London W1
there is a double-breasted wool / cashmere mix coat at Pounds 328
