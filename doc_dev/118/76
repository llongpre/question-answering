   Jane E. Smitt prefers being known
as a residential organizer than Michigan's ``closet queen.''
   But no matter how she describes it, what Smitt does for a living
is make big bucks by arranging wealthy people's closets.
   At least, they start out as closets. She turns them into
fabulous ``spaces behind doors'' that can turn even the worst slob
into an organized fashion plate.
   Except while she's at it, she gets rid of the closet doors.
   ``My premise is that you should be able to see everything you
have, it should all be out in the open,'' Smitt said.
   Nothing is strewn on the floor in Smitt's own closet, which is
more like an entire room in her West Bloomfield home. Nothing is
hidden in even the remotest of corners and clothes are not so
crammed that they come out wrinkled. There are nooks to stash
purses and crannies to hang belts, long spaces for dresses and
pants, shorter spaces for T-shirts and skirts and little drawers
for underwear and socks.
   On top of all that, the clothes are color coordinated by season,
black to white and cotton to wool.
   Even her 75 pairs of shoes have a place _ ``Most of my clients
have about 125 pairs,'' she adds in a futile attempt not to appear
excessive.
   Indeed, there's a place for everything. And she doesn't have to
ask her clients to get rid of anything.
   ``I can't stretch walls, but I generally can double and
sometimes triple the space in a closet,'' she said. ``My goal is to
make everything visible and to make it more functional. My business
is so custom. Some of my clients let me open all the doors, some
people don't. Some people store a case of toilet paper, some people
buy four (rolls) at a time.
   ``The key is listening to them just to find out about their
lifestyles and know how they live. Then you can better direct them
and better advise them.
   ``Like if you know a guy isn't going to walk a few steps to put
a shirt in the laundry, you need to know that so he doesn't end up
in the same situation he's already in. Or maybe the mirror needs to
go right near the tie rack, otherwise he's going to walk out with
his tie crooked.''
   Her clients are equally serious about the business.
   ``Before, when I wanted to wear something, I didn't know which
closet it was in,'' said Adria Aronovitz, who used to have to
disperse her garments in three closets throughout her home.
Aronovitz's son moved out and Smitt converted his room into a
closet.
   Now Aronovitz, who sells jewelry from her home, loves her closet
so much she treats it like a showcase, bringing guests in to see it.
   ``It is easier now. I just love it. It makes such a big
difference,'' she said. ``I spend a lot of time in there.''
   Smitt's designs reduce junk collecting and disorder because
there's a specific place for everything. High heels won't fit in a
slot for tennis shoes, and a dress will not fit in a shorter space
intended for a skirt. The compartments are all adjustable to allow
for inevitable fashion changes. Smitt even provides pullout hooks
for unused hangars.
   Smitt, 35, has charged from $250 to redo an existing closet _ it
takes two weeks if drawers aren't needed _ to $15,000 for all the
closets in a Birmingham home she began work on before it was built
_ that took a year and a half. Single closets range from $250 for a
5-foot lineal closet to $6,000 for a 15-foot-by-18-foot room.
   Her price includes her design fee, materials, aesthetics, belt
and tie racks, hooks and any other gadgets she needs to make the
closet fit the customer. Some ask for shoe shiners, pant steamers
or a space to pack suitcases.
   Smitt confesses she didn't always have a tidy room, but she was
the type of child who felt she had better things to do than listen
to her teachers during school.
   ``I loved to organize my pencil drawers. I used to take all the
pencils out of the drawer and put them back in. And when I went
home, I'd take everything out of my looseleafs and make it really
organized,'' she said. ``Still today, I like making the silverware
drawer stacked in neat piles _ I like to do it.
   ``It just became a natural. I love it. I love what I do.''
   Smitt said she earned a college degree at the request of her
father, but she never really found her niche in life until she
started working in kitchen sales. Her business developed from that.
   She has been in business for herself about six years, and now
employs an accountant and a part-time assistant who helps with
designs. She says she has never advertised _ she relies on
word-of-mouth by happy clients.
   Smitt organizes all ``spaces behind doors,'' including linen
closets and kitchen pantries. She's even done a yacht.
   Her service is not unique, she has competition in the nearby
affluent Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe and she's a member of the
Los Angeles-based National Association of Professional Organizers.
But Smitt says she's one of the few organizers who will return
after the design is complete and the carpenter is finished to hang
up each piece of clothing.
   ``You have to give them order in their life, and if you give
people order, then generally they can maintain it,'' Smitt said.
