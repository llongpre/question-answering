FT  12 JUN 93 / Fashion: Flower power for a very Nineties summer - The
floral frock is back. But, says Avril Groom, the modern version is a long
way from Laura Ashley

IT IS 40 years since Laura Ashley started making tea towels and aprons on
her kitchen table in London's Pimlico and 25 since she launched the first of
her printed dresses that were to alter the fashion perceptions of a
generation of British women.
This year, appropriately, the floral frock is back - but what would the late
Laura make of it now? She was designing in a tradition going back to the
18th century, fabrics from which inspired some of her flower-sprig prints.
The tradition periodically surfaced in fashion until the 1920s. Historically
it belonged as much to the milkmaid in simple printed cotton as to the lady
in summer garden silks but, if fashion can be said to mimic television
series, the Ashley look was aimed Upstairs rather than Down. It was
essentially British, rural and, in the early 1970s, aspirational.
The floral frock's latest reincarnation is none of these. Now that design
thinking deems it unworthy to look like a possessor of wealth, inspiration
comes from the opposite end of the social scale. In this case that means
either wartime flea-market Parisiennes with drooping cigarettes and clumpy
wedge sandals, or East European gipsy refugees and their sanitised fashion
equivalents, the neo-hippies in mismatched print layers.
The roots of this odd skewing of a classic look are decidedly French. The
young Parisian deconstructionists have embraced it enthusiastically, with
designers such as Martin Margiela seeking out 1940s dresses to recut and mix
with devastating effect. But the origins of it lie with the often-prophetic
Jean-Paul Gaultier, a disciple of bondage corsetry and mannish tailoring who
first showed he had a softer side with a memorable mid-1980s collection of
faded flower-print chiffon overalls, aprons and lingerie lace, layered over
his usual pinstripes. He called it 'La concierge est dans l'escalier' and
has said since that he has 'the tastes of a concierge'.
Now this is what everyone claims and, though Gaultier's look took some time
to take off, by last summer every city girl in France and Italy looked like
a concierge in a floppy, navy or black sprig-printed button-through frock
worn with tennis shoes and tanned legs (still perfectly good styling for hot
weather this year).
On the catwalk, printed overalls and turban-tied headscarves came even from
that icon of 1980s success-dressing, Chanel. Add an injection of American
grunge nostalgia and the resulting style makes you look, even if you inhabit
a large country house, as if you should wield the duster rather than the
purse strings.
It sounds unpromising, yet this is a style with charm and practicality. The
secret of making it look good is, as with so much of this summer's fashion,
in the layering. Too often the traditional British floral frock does not
tally with the traditional British summer climate and disappears under
ill-assorted cardigans or coats. This year that is exactly what it is
supposed to do, but naturally the results are best if it is thought through
and co-ordinated first.
Colour-matched mixed prints, stripes and spots can look richly wonderful, if
slightly Bohemian. A classic floral frock from last time round passes muster
if you give some fresh thought to layering. Put a stripey T-shirt or a
skinny jumper under it, making it more useful on cooler days, plus another
cropped or skinny knit on top. In warm weather, sandwich it with this
summer's light, transparent layers such as a lacy camisole, a loose chiffon
shirt or a crochet waistcoat.
Strappy dresses that will become sunfrocks in high summer can be layered
pinafore-style for now. And why stick to one dress when you can wear two? A
button-through frock can double up as a fluid coat, this season's favoured
way of expressing softness and newer-looking than a jacket. By wearing the
dresses together or separately you also multiply your choices.
This need not be an expensive option. The floral frock is everywhere, from
chainstore versions not much over Pounds 20 through the middle of the market
to designer originals such as Ralph Lauren's fragile silk slip at Pounds
700-plus. The designer end gives you silk, chiffon, subtle prints and more
swirly fabric for your money; the middle good shapes but a tendency to
polyester; the chainstores offer still nice floppy viscose, though with a
skimpier one-sized cut, shaped with ties at the back and, harking back to
the 1940s originals, a resurgence of shoulderpads.
The comforting thought is that, after the passion for layers has faded, all
these dresses will slide easily back under a plain tailored jacket to become
the classic British summer look once more.
To show how concierge style suits gracious summer living, we photographed it
at Llangoed Hall, the Wye Valley hotel owned by Sir Bernard Ashley and
decorated by his son Nick, former design chief of Laura Ashley. Here we show
how, mixed with other good, simple pieces, the chintzy print can look softly
elegant - just like the floral frock.
