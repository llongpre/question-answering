   NEW YORK -- Joan and David Helpern, who make upscale
women's shoes, now complain that AnnTaylor Stores Corp. isn't
the cutting-edge fashion emporium it once was.
   Joseph Brooks, the chairman and chief executive officer of
AnnTaylor, a major specialty retailer of apparel for career
women, now complains that Joan &amp; David Helpern Inc. makes too
many high-priced flat-heeled shoes.

   After 24 years of a near-perfect marriage, during which
Joan &amp; David and AnnTaylor grew and prospered together, the
two New York companies are getting a divorce.
   The breakup is painful and messy because like many other
entrepreneurs, the Helperns grew heavily reliant on a single
business arrangement with a larger partner. They claim the
partner then demanded that they make radical changes in their
own business -- something they refused.
   Now, the pending split leaves Joan &amp; David struggling to
find new retail channels. That "will cost a lot of time and
money," says David BenDaniel, a professor of entrepreneurship
at Cornell University. The recession and the general glut of
retail stores in the U.S. will make the task all the harder.
   For years, the Helperns' company made its reputation and
built a loyal clientele by riding the fancy coattails of
AnnTaylor, where Joan &amp; David generated more than half its
overall business. But after a lawsuit, the parties agreed
last year to phase out their relationship by February 1993.
   Joan &amp; David doesn't disclose its total sales, but its
sales through leased departments at AnnTaylor fell to $35.5
million in AnnTaylor's fiscal year ended Feb. 2, from $42.6
million a year earlier. Joan &amp; David is operating in
substantially fewer AnnTaylor stores than before. In
addition, AnnTaylor has begun selling private-label shoes,
which appear to be drawing away some customers from the
higher-priced Joan &amp; David line.
   The Helperns, whose ages (she's 64, he's 73) apparently
haven't diminished their energy and intensity, vow to make
their enterprise stronger than ever. "By spring of 1993 we
will have replaced all the {AnnTaylor} business," Mr. Helpern
declares. Among other things, the Helperns are banking on a
license to produce shoes for the New York designer Calvin
Klein, as well as a women's apparel line and men's shoes.
   The Helperns are also opening more of their own stores;
the 13 opened within the last year have brought the total to
24 (excluding eight foreign units). Because its shoes are
high-priced -- mostly between $150 and $300 a pair -- Joan &amp;
David has a limited choice of locations for its stores. Yet
an apt location can pay off big. At Tootsies Inc.'s flagship
apparel store in Houston, for example, the Joan &amp; David
leased department enjoys more than $1 million of business a
year, says Tootsies owner Mickey Rosemarin.
   Whether or not they succeed at replacing all the AnnTaylor
business, the Helperns expect never again to be so much at
the mercy of another company. Leased departments like theirs
have traditionally been beholden to the stores in which they
operate. "It's like being a guest in somebody's home," Mrs.
Helpern says.
   Yet many shoe, jewelry and fur salons have little choice
but to operate under such precarious circumstances. Just as
shopping center tenants draw from their neighbors' traffic,
shoes and furs sell better when they're surrounded by
clothes. Moreover, leased operations don't require a huge
capital investment.
   For years, the Helperns had relatively few complaints with
AnnTaylor. Shortly after the couple -- who had earlier owned
four shoe stores in Boston -- became shoe designers, they
teamed up with Richard Liebeskind, who founded the first
AnnTaylor boutique in 1954, in New Haven, Conn.
   Unlike the high-heeled pumps popular at the time, Joan &amp;
David shoes were mostly flats and low-heeled styles that
complemented the career clothes AnnTaylor was known for.
"Most shoe companies made shoes for standing in bars," says
Mrs. Helpern. "Our shoes are for women who run through
airports."
   As AnnTaylor stores blanketed the country, Joan &amp; David
shoe salons were installed in 90% of them (the figure now is
about 40%). Joan &amp; David focused its attention on designing,
and on collaborating with 22 factory contractors in Italy.
   But over the years, Joan &amp; David was also forced to adapt
to five different AnnTaylor owners, who progressively made
AnnTaylor clothes less high-fashion and more mainstream.
These shifts made the Helperns increasingly aware that they
needed to decrease their dependence on AnnTaylor. By the time
that Mr. Brooks took over AnnTaylor in a leveraged buyout in
1989, Joan &amp; David had already begun courting other retailers
and opening its own stores.
   Industry observers weren't surprised when Mr. Brooks
started putting his stamp on AnnTaylor. Grooming the company
to go public, which it did last May, he opened some 60 more
stores and took the chain another notch downscale. Mr. Brooks
stressed private-label goods over name brands in order to
increase profit margins, including a new private-label shoe
line.
   In her first meeting with Mr. Brooks, Mrs. Helpern says
the AnnTaylor chief told her, "`I can either make you rich or
make you a pauper.' . . . . He wanted to take our name off
the shoes; he wanted us to make private-label shoes that were
coordinated with the clothes . . . . He wanted to run our
business." Mr. Brooks replies: "That is absolutely not true.
I find that comment insulting."
   In February 1990, Joan &amp; David sued in Boston federal
court, seeking to stop AnnTaylor from interfering with its
business. Two months later, however, Joan &amp; David, in effect,
signed a divorce by agreeing to close its leased departments
by February 1993. That didn't entirely end the friction
between the two parties: In Manhattan federal court,
AnnTaylor later accused Joan &amp; David of violating its leases,
in part by failing to sell "superior quality merchandise."
The two companies say they have reached an agreement that
would settle the suit out of court.
   But the tensions between the parties remain palpable, even
among saleswomen at AnnTaylor stores. Recently, a shopper
wished to try on pairs of both AnnTaylor and Joan &amp; David
shoes at AnnTaylor's flagship store in New York. "We're Joan
& David; they're AnnTaylor," was the curt reply of a
saleswoman who declined to help with the AnnTaylor pair.
