DEAR HOT: I have some relatives coming to town who saw the film "Pretty Woman" 
and loved it. I thought it would be fun to take them to some of the shops Julia 
Roberts went to in Beverly Hills. Could you list them? 
</P>
<P>
 -- A.M., West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR A.M.: That movie was the ultimate shopper's dream, wasn't it? What we'd 
give to be able to spend limitlessly on Rodeo Drive -- and have a pizza thrown 
in as well. Fortunately, you don't need a Swiss bank account to check out some 
of the stores that either provided merchandise or were featured in the movie, 
namely: 
</P>
<P>
* Boulmiche (9501 Santa Monica Blvd.) offers ready-to-wear designs from young 
European designers. 
</P>
<P>
* Valentino (414 N. Rodeo Drive) is where Roberts picked up many of her 
exquisite suits, that red gown and the dress she wore in the polo match scene. 
</P>
<P>
* Fred Joaillier (401 N. Rodeo Drive) features pricey gemstone baubles and 
watches. 
</P>
<P>
* Gucci (347 N. Rodeo Drive) hardly needs explaining for those familiar with 
the leather handbags, luggage, shoes and accessories that made logo-flaunting a 
national past-time. 
</P>
<P>
* Mr. Guy (previously on Rodeo, now at 301 N. Canon Drive) wasn't filmed for 
the movie, but the store did provide Richard Gere's finely tailored Cerruti 
1881 suits. 
</P>
<P>
* The Regent Beverly Wilshire hotel (9500 Wilshire Blvd.) is where the couple 
lived out their Cinderella fantasy. If you can't afford the Presidential Suite 
at $3,000 a day, it's a nice place to have afternoon tea and watch the world go 
by. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, Entertainment Weekly magazine totaled up what Roberts' wardrobe 
would have cost had Gere actually purchased it for her: a stunning $26,804.48, 
including some outfits custom-made by the film's wardrobe designer, Marilyn 
Vance-Straker. When life imitates art, it can get pretty expensive. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR HOT: I'm one of those "big, beautiful women." My problem is, despite all 
the new stores specializing in clothing for people my size, I haven't found any 
that carry really sexy lingerie. There's plenty of basic, utilitarian underwear 
and a some very elegant robes and teddies out there for women in larger sizes, 
but they're still too prim for me. I want something that sizzles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.K., Pacific Palisades 
</P>
<P>
DEAR G.K.: There's a new catalogue for the Delta Burke set that should suit 
your needs just swell. It's called Oh! Such Style and features bustiers, bikini 
underwear, garter belts, laced-topped thigh-high stockings and one item that 
shall go unmentioned here. Trust us: It's in the truly trashy tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the catalogue has more conservative styles, such as terry-cloth 
robes, peignoirs, teddies, caftans and slips. Styles are designed for 
full-figured women equivalent to dress sizes 16 through 28. Prices range from 
$5 for a pair of nylon stretch stockings to $126 for a three-piece satin pajama 
set. For a free copy of Oh! Such Style, call (800) 835-2246 ext. 272.
