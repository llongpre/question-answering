New Year's Eve outfits for about $100 are easier to find than most women might 
expect. Post-holiday markdowns help, so does some creative thinking about how 
to spruce up what you already own. 
</P>
<P>
At ClothesTime, a bargain-hunter's paradise, there are velvet cocktail dresses 
for less than $40 and sweaters trimmed in gold ribbon for less than $30. 
</P>
<P>
Other stores, including Whip Cream in the Beverly Center, have marked down some 
holiday items as much as 50%. "Our customers are more cost-conscious this year, 
and looking for sales," says Chris Coyle, manager of Whip Cream. Even at full 
price, party fare at the store, which specializes in junior fashions, ranges 
from $70 to $98. 
</P>

For women whose budgets best fit a new accessory, not an outfit, shoe ornaments 
have become a favorite wardrobe reviver. Nordstrom stores and Le Petite Jean, a 
Beverly Hills shoe store, stock elegant clip-on shoe ornaments, encrusted with 
faux pearls, rhinestones, bows and other trims, priced from $7.95 to $50.

Scarfs in festive fabrics can dress up a plain sweater, tunic or evening 
jacket. At Robinson's, a solid sequined scarf by Oscar de la Renta sells for 
$60. 
</P>

Deborah Harmon, a Sherman Oaks actress, takes an imaginative approach to 
accessories. She bought a large scarf in black crepe with gold soutache trim to 
wear as a sarong on New Year's Eve.

CBS senior publicist Lori Huhn combats outfit fatigue by mixing old and new. 
For this New Year's Eve, the Manhattan Beach resident and infrequent party-goer 
decided to pair a new, black lace skirt with a chiffon-sleeved black jacket 
already in her closet. She added a new hat to complete the ensemble. Total 
investment: $80. 
</P>
<P>
Another money-saving tip: Shop resale stores. April, a new Long Beach 
consignment store, recently sold a gently worn, red wool jersey dress by Donna 
Karan for $100, a fraction of the original cost. 
</P>
<P>
For the most temporary yet trendy looks of all, rental stores such as Dressed 
to Kill in West Hollywood will loan big-name designer chic for about $150. The 
fee buys an evening with a Bob Mackie black velvet short cocktail dress with 
gold lame trim, or a black strapless Gianni Versace cocktail number. Given the 
holiday crunch, the by-appointment-only store suggests a week's notice.
