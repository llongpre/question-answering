Connie Victoria is always hearing about her clothes. She's used to it, as you 
have to be if you don't wear anything less than 40 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't care what people think," she says. "I wear what I like." 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in a decidedly offbeat ensemble -- a long denim skirt paired with a 
lacy T-shirt and denim fringes -- Victoria shows off her vintage clothing store 
in Ventura, Street Scene Classics. 
</P>
<P>
A sleeveless black chiffon number with wine-colored lace and matching costume 
jewelry from the 1930s is displayed outside the door. A 1940s wedding dress and 
a white veil hang on the wall. A silk afternoon dress from the 1920s hangs in 
one corner. 
</P>
<P>
Clothing comes in lace, brocade and velvet, and with gloves, hats, shoes and 
costume jewelry, dating from the 1920s to the present. Both sexes are 
represented. None of it is in any sort of order. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria haunts estate sales, swap meets and garage sales. Treasures usually 
get a cleaning, but only one-fourth need repair, she said. "They're made so 
well," she said. "Everything is lined." 
</P>
<P>
Ballroom dancing allows her to show off her wardrobe, Victoria said, but most 
customers don't generally wait for a costume ball or Halloween to dress up. 
They tend to be "weird people, just like me, who want to have fun." PEGGY Y.
