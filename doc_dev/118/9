   For three decades, the world of fast-lane, fancy
restaurants was Stuart Levin's oyster. Then, multiple sclerosis
struck, taking the oyster but leaving a pearl Levin discovered in
himself and some young recovering drug addicts.
   It took guts and insight and pain to find the gem.
   A couple of years ago, when his multiple sclerosis was at its
worst, Levin sat in his apartment, just sat, day after day. One
morning, as he watched some teen-agers horsing around outside, he
said: ``I thought about how far I had come, and I said, `Dammit, I
can't do nothing. And I was doing nothing.''
   And he thought of the young people at Phoenix House Foundation.
Levin once had helped a friend, Phoenix House President Dr.
Mitchell M. Rosenthal, set up a dinner for donors to the drug
treatment agency.
   Levin _ who had managed The Four Seasons, one of Manhattan's
plushest places to dine, and catered to the Kennedys, among other
things _ trained young people in Rosenthal's program as cooks, bus
boys and waiters for the night.
   So, now Levin called on Rosenthal.
   ``I told him, `I can't walk and I can't run, but I can talk and
I can think. Maybe there's something I can do to further their
lives.'''
   ``And I was being selfish. I needed them.''
   ``We all felt it was a wonderful opportunity to have a man of
Stuart's experience,'' said Rosenthal. ``He's just a wonderful
teacher.''
   Levin and Phoenix House officials settled on a restaurant
service program, which began just over a year ago with Levin
devoting one day a week to teaching recovering drug addicts skills
they needed to work in restaurants, skills that would enable them
to earn a good living when they left Phoenix House.
   One day soon became five _ all volunteer _ and one program
became two. In one, students at a Phoenix House residential high
school and treatment program learn cooking and other aspects of
food service. In the other, which included opening a dining room
with lunch service for employees at Phoenix House headquarters,
people ages 21 to 26 learn dining room service.
   But Levin teaches more.
   ``I teach a way of life, what it is to have patience, what it is
to have understanding, to share experiences. For these young people
to be part of our society, they have to learn,'' Levin said.
   ``No one had time for these kids when they were growing up. I
have time for them _ I have all the time in the world. They are my
life.''
   Tony May, who owns San Domenico restaurant and hired one of
Levin's students, says: ``The Stuart Levin I've seen recently is
the same Stuart Levin I knew 20 years ago. ... His enthusiasm, the
way he moves, the way he pushes. He's the same man to me.''
   ``He's a different kind of person, a man who came from the
top,'' said student Gameal Abdo, 22. ``He teaches the right way,
how it's supposed to be done out in the real world.''
   ``We love him _ for someone to put themselves out for kids like
us ...,'' said Jeffrey McGee, 19.
   ``A lot of people might feel the same way, but he shows it,''
adds Andrew Galloway, 20.
   ``We've had our trials and tribulations on the street, but we've
come a long way and for him to see us as people ... that counts,''
said Lorraine Johnson, 19.
   Levin, 58, teaches what he knows best, what he learned over 35
years.
   Besides being the first resident manager at The Four Seasons, he
was president of Le Pavillon, now closed but once considered among
the country's best restaurants, and he opened the Top of the Park,
high above Central Park.
   A ``Stuart Levin Day'' was once proclaimed in New York City.
   The mementos of that life take up five walls of Levin's
apartment. Mixed in with certificates of appreciation, photographs
with famous people and awards are pictures of his two children and
their children, his parents, himself as a child.
   The mementos of his new life are on the coffee table: a poem, a
letter and a card, from students.
   Of his old life, he says, ``I don't miss it. I think about it,
but I don't miss it, because my life is so full.''
   ``It's like a tree. I'm the main stalk, and my life was one
branch out here,'' he said, stretching out his left arm. ``It fell
off, so I'm starting a new life, a new branch over here.''
   He almost didn't give the new branch a chance to grow.
   There had been signs of weakness and trouble walking, but Levin
said his doctor could not find the cause. Then one morning in June
1985, Levin woke up and could not move his right side. He soon
learned he had MS.
   ``I wanted it to be fatal. I wanted to end it all. Why me?''
   Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system
that afflicts an estimated 250,000 Americans. The cause is not
known, nor is the cure, though some treatments are available.
Symptoms vary greatly from person to person, and range from blurred
vision to paralysis to confusion. It is not contagious and is
rarely fatal.
   After Levin's diagnosis, his doctor sent him to a rehabilitation
center, and Levin became determined to walk again, and without leg
braces. ``We tried. I couldn't walk. I broke down in hysterics for
one day.'' Then he put on the brace, and now he walks, with a
walker. He also sometimes uses a wheelchair.
   ``My most difficult thing is putting on my shoes in the
morning,'' he said, pointing at black lace-up shoes. ``I scream at
myself, `Come on, Stuart,' and then I get dressed and start my
day.''
