   Feeling Bogged Down?
   There's Help Afoot

   TWO NEW designs claim to make it easier to get around on
mud or snow.
   In inventing the Mudder shoe, logger James Johnson of
Astoria, Ore., was inspired by the great blue heron's foot.
The Mudder has hinged "wings" that, when you put your foot
down, spread out to four times your boot area. The wings keep
you from sinking, and they trap air to prevent the suction
that makes it hard to pull your foot out. When you do lift
your foot, the wings collapse for easier walking. Amark of
Merrimack, N.H., makes the Mudder out of a strong, light,
non-sticking plastic produced by Air Products &amp; Chemicals of
Allentown, Pa.
   Bowdoin Lusk, vice president of Atlantic Commodities,
Cheriton, Va., says he and his employees use Mudders when
digging clams and oysters. He calls the shoes "a pretty neat
deal," and says other devices -- skis, snowshoes, plywood,
inner tubes -- proved "terribly cumbersome."
   An official with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says
the shoes have let volunteers studying shore birds along the
Virginia coast to "get to places you couldn't with anything
else."
   Mudders don't solve every problem. The maker urges users
to carry a pole for balance.
   The company plans soon to bring out a lighter model that
will work in snow. "Being smaller, we can go places that
snowshoes can't go, like in among brush," says Glen Gott, an
Amark assistant sales director.
   Snowshoe makers aren't taking that kind of criticism lying
down. Atlas Snowshoe, San Francisco, offers an aluminum and
nylon snowshoe that it says is small and light enough for
running as well as for working in the woods.
                                                                                                       

   Business Schools Skimp
   On Design Instruction
                                                                                                       

   DESPITE a growing recognition of the importance of design
to business success, only a few business schools in the U.S.
offer courses in design. More would like to do so.
   That's the conclusion of a survey of 700 business schools
by Richard Blackburn, professor of business at the University
of North Carolina, for the Corporate Design Foundation,
Boston. Mr. Blackburn says other demands and lack of money
prevent many schools from teaching design.
   Of the 160 schools that responded, only 3% now offer
design-related courses. But 90% thought it was important for
business school students to be exposed to design. And 30% of
business schools include design issues in other courses, such
as manufacturing and marketing.
   Harry Davis, deputy dean at the University of Chicago
Business School, says he is "surprised" how late in the
development of new products U.S. companies "start dealing
with thingness." Mr. Davis has an industrial designer as a
helper in his new-products lab course.
   Gary Cadenhead says the course he teaches on corporate
design strategy at the University of Texas business school
helps students "get oriented to the needs of the consumer."
                                                                                                       

   The Ultimate Pay Phone
   For People On the Go
                                                                                                       

   THE PHONE of the future, or a designer bumblebee? Eric
Williams has designed a public phone for the suburbs, where
many people would rather drive than walk. Wheel guides in the
pavement would bring a car close to the phone. The driver's
window would stay closed to block outside noise.
   Infrared sensors would guide a liquid crystal display and
a microphone and speaker next to the driver's window. The
driver would use his window as a touch screen to seek
information or dial a number. Sound would be transmitted
through the glass.
   Mr. Williams, a New York designer, conceived his suburban
public phone while a student at Cranbrook Academy of Art, in
Bloomfield Hills, Mich. The work was sponsored by Nynex.
   Designers like his phone. It recently won a gold award
from the Industrial Designers Society of America. Juror
Charles Burnette likens the phone to "a gigantic bee trying
to get in through the car window," with "wonderfully engaging
forms."
   The phone industry is less excited. Nynex says the
technology for the Williams phone exists, but the company has
no plans to produce it. "We are trying to provoke some
leading-edge thinking for people who would like to
manufacture," says Nathan Felde, director of Nynex's media
lab.
   Michael Zeaman, a spokesman for American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, says: "We haven't seen the need for the gee-whiz
phone booth." Herb White, a vice president at Adco, a booth
maker in St. Joseph, Mo., says phone companies "don't
normally like to hang a high-cost item out in public."
