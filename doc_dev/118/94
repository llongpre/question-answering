   For $3,000 a man can get just about any
shoe he wants, no matter if it's to be made from turkey, baby
shark, elephant or plain old cow.
   Shoemakers Domenick DiMeola and Raymond Robinson will handcraft
men's footwear _ from the bizarre to the banal.
   DiMeola and Robinson, among only a few shoemakers still
producing shoes from scratch, work for the Johnston &amp; Murphy shoe
company in Nashville. The 138-year-old firm is the oldest
manufacturer of men's dress shoes in the country, company officials
say.
   Johnston &amp; Murphy sells machine-made shoes for $130 to $290 but
the handmade versions will cost $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the
materials and variations in the foot.
   DiMeola, 62, is the senior craftsman and learned his trade in
Italy where his father and grandfather were shoemakers. He was born
in Newark, N.J., moved as a toddler with his family to Italy and
returned to New Jersey at age 6.
   When DiMeola began plying his trade, scores of shoemakers could
be found. Now they are a rarity and DiMeola considers himself part
of a passing profession.
   In his melodious accented English, DiMeola said he plans to
retire in a few years which means a replacement has to be found.
Robinson, 47, of Woodbury, who has trained under DiMeola for 17
years, will choose DiMeola's successor.
   As they sit in a workroom filled with shoes and the aroma of
leather, Robinson grimaces at the idea of finding a replacement.
Clearly the two men get along.
   On one side of the cavernous plant, the men work in a shop
surrounded by multi-tiered racks cradling a variety of wingtips,
loafers and golf shoes in various stages of production. DiMeola
jumps up from one of the two rectangular workbenches cluttered with
oddly-shaped tools to show off a pair of spiked golf shoes made for
and worn by Arnold Palmer.
   They say their work requires much skill, patience and attention
to detail. DiMeola has made shoes for such luminaries as Presidents
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter, and talk show
host David Letterman.
   DiMeola says his most unusual customer was the late pianist
Liberace. The flamboyant pianist eschewed the standard leather
shoes the men produce and instead sent DiMeola a piece of cloth
embossed with a piano keyboard. DiMeola used the cloth to create a
pair with the keys running across the toes.
   Robinson says his strangest order was from a man who sent in
turkey skins to be made into a pair of boots. ``He wanted them by
Thanksgiving,'' Robinson said.
   ``It was the worst leather we ever worked with,'' DiMeola chimes
in, adding that the skins were very thin.
   The men no longer produce boots. But they still make $3,000
alligator shoes, and the more bizarre special orders from baby
shark (``awful delicate to work with'') to elephant (``tough, but a
good leather'').
   But no matter the materials or the customer, the men say
everyone gets the same treatment.
   ``I still put the same effort, the same material and the same
workmanship for people like you and me,'' DiMeola says proudly.
   In the recession years of the early 1970s, DiMeola said the
inflated cost of importing leather cut demand for handmade shoes.
But in the last two to three years the demand has increased and
DiMeola and Robinson are overwhelmed with orders.
   ``Normally we stay behind 20 to 30 pair,'' DiMeola said. ``Right
now we are behind 200 pair. We can only make one pair a day. It
takes 19 hours to make a pair.
   ``They (customers) have to wait 12 to 16 weeks normally to get a
pair, but now we are seven months behind,'' he said.
   Special orders, particularly for men who suffer orthopedic
problems, are booming. Out of nearly 300 pairs of shoes the men
made last year, 150 were special orders.
   The special orders can be made to the exact specifications of
the customer's foot and make room for corns, raised bones and other
problems. With proper care, including a rest after every two to
three days of wear, the shoes will last longer and look better than
machine-made footwear, DiMeola says.
   Only one pair of shoes was returned last year, DiMeola says, and
about 1 percent of all shoes they've made have been sent back.
   ``We stand behind our product,'' he says.
