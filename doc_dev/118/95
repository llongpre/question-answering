   There are karate shoes and volleyball shoes,
skateboarding shoes and cheerleading shoes. Now, syringes washing
onto beaches are boosting sales of the latest entry in the athletic
footwear market: the water shoe.
   The $25-to-$60 ankle-high, mesh and rubber booties are light
enough for swimming but have tough soles to protect against hot
sand, barnacles, shells, coral ... or the occasional jagged test
tube encrusted with blood.
   Despite their price _ two to six times the cost of ordinary
flip-flops _ the shoes are reported by retailers and mail-order
houses to be selling fast, especially in Florida, Texas, Southern
California and New England.
   ``They've caught on really fast,'' said Kristi Pike, a floor
supervisor for Eastern Mountain Sports in Boston. ``People see other
people wearing them on the beach and come in to ask for them.''
   Nike originally developed its Aqua Sock as a super-light running
shoe. But what bombed among runners scored an immediate hit among
windsurfers when it re-emerged two years ago in a modified shape and
neon colors.
   ``We really thought there was going to be a narrow market for
it,'' said Liz G. Dolan, a spokeswoman for the Beaverton, Ore.,
company. ``Now we're in a situation where we really cannot make them
fast enough.''
   Plenty of industry analysts believe the water shoe could outrun
the football shoe, which is projected to generate $50 million in
sales this year, and perhaps climb as high as the hiking boot, with
$116 million in sales.
   So far, the main entrants in the water shoe market are
Stoughton-based Reebok International Ltd., Nike and Omega Corp., a
privately-held boat shoe manufacturer in Boston.
   Citing the intense competition, all three companies declined to
release sales figures.
   After the water shoe, what's next?
   ``I don't know,'' said Stephen Encarnacao, head of marketing and
research for Converse Inc. of North Reading. ``It's good for people
to take their sport seriously and to immerse themselves in it. But
you can take this thing too far. I wouldn't want us to take
ourselves so seriously that we really believe you need a croquet
shoe.''
