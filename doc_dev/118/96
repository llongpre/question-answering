<LEADPARA>  Owning a pair tap shoes would be the sure ticket to bliss. I knew that when I
was 6. Back in Miss Mary Jane's dance classes in Olympia, Wash., I longed --
nay, I yearned -- for the tap shoes that older girls wore as they shuffled off
to Buffalo.;   My mother had enrolled me in ballet class, but it was tap dance
that looked like fun. It combined beauty, noise and moving around fast. The
shoes had sophisticated bows and they made a wonderful tock-click-tock-click
sound when they speeded up. The year I got to click those tap shoes myself I
count as one of the great years of my life.  </LEADPARA>

FROM TAP SHOES TO TUTUS, IT'S ALL BEAUTY AND NOISE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     I caught that same feeling of bliss when I watched Ardith Gotthardt, 60,
teach a beginning class of dancers with the help of "Miss Jennifer" Morrison,
19, at the Centerville Community Center.;   "Those little kids are only 3 or 4
years old and they get to wear tap shoes," I thought. Lucky lucky lucky.;  
The lyrics of one of their dance numbers caught the spirit "Hey, look at me --
whee." Wearing tutus, T-shirts and Spandex, the 11 dancers finished more or
less in line with their hands exultantly waving in the air.;   They are the
youngest of 1,100 participants in Fremont's Leisure Services' dance program,
which includes ballet, tap, jazz, ballroom, tumbling and square dance taught
by 10 instructors. "As far as we know, it's the largest dance program in the
state sponsored by a recreation or leisure services department," Skip Domville
said.;   After a quick change into flat ballet slippers, the students learned
ballet steps, following directions to "Step, hop, kick!" across the hardwood
expanse. Then on to tumbling, which culminated in fearless -- if mildly
baffled -- cartwheels.;   Moms and grandmothers sat on chairs along the wall,
watching the tiny figures -- their faces reflecting every move and mis-move on
the part of their young. Many parents are repeat customers -- or dance
students themselves.;   "Dance helps with their coordination," said Wanda
Ostler, as Rebecca, 4, skipped along on the dance floor. "Her older sisters
took dance from Mrs. Gotthardt -- and so did I for five years," she said.
Sometimes two generations of Ostlers appeared in dance recitals together. "It
was exciting getting ready together, doing the makeup and getting into
costume.";   Classes help young boys and girls learn socialization skills and
get a friendly introduction to dance, Gotthardt said. Adults come "because
they danced when they were younger -- or because they never got to dance when
they were younger," she said. "But once they get into it, it's fun and good
exercise.";   With so many dancers, the city now has -- for the first time --
a studio designed primarily for dance. Remodeling of the old Centerville
Community Center included approximately $40,000 to remodel the old
multi-purpose room into a dance studio. The tile-covered cement floor was
replaced with springy wooden floors. Mirrors let the dancers check their
positions. Permanent barres are in place for warm-ups.;   The airy studio is a
far cry from school and community center multipurpose rooms Domville has
scouted for dance classes through the years.;   "In the heyday of disco, we'd
have 30 or 40 in a class. We even used the old school district building on
Fremont Boulevard," Domville said. His staff would dismantle the school
board's setup to make room for discomania.;   Dance recitals for all levels of
dancers are a yearly ritual, often held at Irvington High School. Sometimes it
takes five separate recitals to accommodate all the students.;   Joan
Caldwell, who founded the program 29 years ago, still teaches, as do other
long-timers Betty Gentry, Gotthardt, Charlene Welty and Janet Hakola.;  
Chifra Holt, who became dance coordinator eight months ago, hopes to introduce
more straight ballet classes and develop new performance groups. A
professional dancer and choreographer, Holt trained in modern dance with Alwin
Nikolais and Martha Graham and in ballet with Robert Joffrey, Mia Slavenska
and Sally Streets. She teaches dance at De Anza College in Cupertino.;   Dance
is good exercise. And sometimes you get to wear tap shoes.; IF YOU'RE
