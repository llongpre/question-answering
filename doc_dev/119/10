   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, pocked
by thousands of years of vandalism and stone-robbing, is finally
getting a facelift.
   The effort to clean rubbish from between the massive limestone
blocks and to tighten loose rocks marks the first restoration work
ever attempted on the outside of the sole survivor of the ancient
world's Seven Wonders.
   ``This is not just cosmetic work,'' said Zahi Hawass, the
Egyptian Antiquities Organization's director-general for the
pyramids area. ``We're afraid unless we do something to stabilize
the outer stones, there could be a tragedy.
   ``People have a tendency to think that pyramids will be here
forever because they're so massive, but each is suffering from wind
and sand erosion, rain and salt (and) ... to a great extent because
of the hands of man.''
   Work began inside the Great Pyramid last winter to remove salt
that oozed through the limestone and accumulated along passageway
walls. The work on the outside began in late August.
   From a distance, the pyramid appears fine. Close up, it's
obviously far from healthy. Many of the massive blocks, weighing an
average 2{ tons, have eroded or disappeared. Others hang
precariously on uneven ledges.
   In 1976, a stone weighing several tons fell from the southern
side. No one was injured because tourists were being kept away
during a dignitary's visit, Hawass said. ``We chose to begin
(restoration) with Cheops Pyramid first, because we know there's a
chance more stones will fall.''
   When put in place 4,600 years ago, the estimated 2.3 million
blocks were assembled with such skill that only a thin sheet of
paper would pass between.
   The new project aims at duplicating such precision. Workers
skilled in climbing scurry over the rocks, binding loose stones
with natural mortar like that used by the ancients and repairing
damage caused by millenia of nesting birds, desert animals and
human ravagers.
   Historical records and legends indicate the first man-made
damage occurred as early as 500 years after the death of Cheops,
the second pharaoh of ancient Egypt's Fourth Dynasty. The Egyptians
were in revolt against tyrannical and oppressive practices of the
past, hacking and destroying statues and monuments from the earlier
days of the pharaohs.
   Less than a century later, the 12th-dynasty Pharoah Amenemhet
took many stones from Cheops' pyramid complex to build one for
himself at el-Lisht, south of Giza Plateau. Teams from New York's
Metropolitan Museum, who excavated Amenemhet's pyramid, found
hundreds of the decorated pieces.
   Nobody knows when or why, but the Great Pyramid at some time
lost 30 feet of height, leaving it still enormous at almost 453
feet. Its outer surface originally was covered with a protective
layer of fine, hard limestone, only traces of which survived
desecration and looting.
   Thousands of its stones were stolen over time, but the pyramid
remained structurally intact until the late ninth century, writes
I.E.S. Edwards, the British Egyptologist acknowledged as the
authority on Egyptian pyramids.
   At that time, Arab raiders broke a large hole just below the
main entrance and entered the monument in a vain search for
treasure, Edwards wrote in his showpiece work ``The Pyramids of
Egypt.''
   ``Subsequently it became a copious and convenient quarry,
providing the stone required for bridges over irrigation canals,
houses, walls and other buildings in the neighborhood of Giza and
Cairo,'' he wrote.
   In the early 19th century, the Albanian Mohammed Ali, credited
with creating the modern Egyptian state as part of the Ottoman
Empire, thought nothing of using blocks from Cheops and other
pyramids for construction.
   The English Egyptologist Flinders Petrie wrote in the 1880s of
watching as a steady stream of camels, hundreds daily, carried
massive blocks into Cairo from nearby Abu Rawash pyramid, built by
Cheops' successor Djedefre.
   Today the pyramid area is littered with toppled building blocks.
