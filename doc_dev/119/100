AROUND THE VALLEY: LESSON IN MIND OVER MATTER

It was billed as a workshop in telekinesis -- moving objects with the power of 
the mind -- and most of the students wanted to believe. Really. 
</P>
<P>
But although the catalogue of Learning Tree University promised that 
participants in a parapsychology workshop would discover and learn to control 
their innate psychic powers ("foster the ability to control dice and other 
objects mentally"), the class was more like a "power of positive thinking" 
workshop. 
</P>
<P>
No step-by-step instructions on how to levitate socks and direct them into the 
laundry hamper while still in bed sipping the morning coffee. No advice on 
ensuring that the dice come up seven or 11 every time. 
</P>
<P>
Instead Lee Domez, clad in a pale blue suit with a lavender striped tie and a 
teddy bear lapel pin, preached his philosophy of believe and let-believe. 
</P>
<P>
In a small, freshly painted pale-pink conference room at the Learning Tree, a 
Chatsworth school with a widely varied curriculum, Domez flashed a toothy grin 
and spouted truisms, a good ol' fashioned motivational pep talk, with a 
sprinkling of New Age terms thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be yourself," said Domez, with the fervent zeal of a TV evangelist 
revealing the Truth. "You have to march to your own drummer." 
</P>
<P>
"We create our own situations, even if it's only self-fulfilling prophesies," 
he advised. 
</P>
<P>
"All of us are in total charge of our own lives. If you don't take charge of 
your life, I guarantee that there will be someone else to take charge for you." 
Sounding like a self-help guru lecturing disciples, the silver-haired, 
silver-bearded Domez admonished the four women and three men in the class not 
to be afraid to explore the world of psychic phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
"I salute each of you for being in a class like this," he congratulated them. 
</P>
<P>
"Each of us has experiences that are not logically explained, and we are afraid 
to discuss them," he said, his three silver and turquoise rings and silver 
bracelets flashing as he gesticulated, his voice rising and falling 
melodramatically. "Why are we afraid to discuss them? Because there is a thing 
out there called society. 
</P>
<P>
"There is so much prejudice against what we don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Spend five minutes a day, center on who you are and just listen. You will be 
surprised with what you hear." 
</P>
<P>
But Domez was preaching to the converted, to people who have already dabbled in 
the realm of inexplicable phenomena and are not afraid to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
One member of the class said she has seen her guardian angel. Another sees 
auras of color around people. A third told classmates that when people die they 
are just "making their transitions. It's a spiritual world, and they are just 
living in another expression. I may not see them, but we are communicating 
spiritually." 
</P>
<P>
Tim, an Orange County computer programmer, talked about out-of-body experiences 
with the casual confidence of a world traveler telling a novice tourist about a 
trip to Outer Mongolia. 
</P>
<P>
He told the class how his spirit left his body and went to a neighbor's house, 
where he peeped in a window. The next day, he said, his neighbor confirmed his 
account of events inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
Gwen, who lives in the Valley, spoke hesitantly about her premonitions of 
danger and ESP communication with a friend. With the shy manner of a young girl 
telling about her first kiss, Gwen explained after class that she had a vision 
of her uncle and a flame while on an evening hike with a friend during a 
camping trip. When they returned to her campfire several miles away, they found 
Gwen's uncle passed out with his arm in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
Several similar experiences have convinced Gwen that she may have psychic 
powers, and nervously, she is now setting out to explore the regions of the 
Unknown. 
</P>
<P>
These weren't the kind of students who needed urging to "open their minds" and 
drop their inhibitions. They accepted telekinesis as a possibility and wanted 
concrete how-to tips and a road map, or at least convincing evidence that there 
is such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
After an hour, Domez addressed the subject of the day. 
</P>
<P>
The possibility that objects can be moved with mind power alone cannot be ruled 
out, he proffers. What else, he asked, can explain the pyramids of Egypt? 
</P>
<P>
"How did they move those big rocks in Egypt to build those pyramids? Those huge 
stones are nowhere in evidence around Giza. People say, 'slave labor,' but 
that's not logical," he said. "Even with our advanced technology today we could 
not duplicate that, and scientists have said that." 
</P>
<P>
With all other scientific explanations thus eliminated, that leaves 
telekinesis. 
</P>
<P>
"One tenet stands above all else: You must have belief," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember Uri Geller, who used to bend spoons and keys with his mind on 
television," Domez began, but was interrupted by a class participant, an 
engineer from Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew him personally. We grew up together. That guy is a crook," the engineer 
protested. "Maybe all these things are possible. I'm here to learn. But it's 
obvious that what he was doing were all tricks." 
</P>
<P>
That was it. No flying socks. No odds-defying dice. 
</P>
<P>
Class dismissed.
