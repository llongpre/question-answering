<LEADPARA>  Archaeologists have unearthed Egypt's oldest bakery, where bakers laboring in
smoke-filled rooms turned out thousands of loaves every day for hungry
pyramid-builders.;   "We're talking colossal baking here, easily enough to
feed 30,000 people a day," said Egyptologist Mark Lehner of the University of
Chicago's Oriental Institute.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  ARCHAEOLOGISTS UNCOVER RUINS OF COLOSSAL BAKERY
THAT FED PYRAMID BUILDERS
DISCOVERY ILLUMINATES LIFE IN ANCIENT EGYPT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The well-preserved bakery, with a hearth, dough vats and bread pots, dates
from Giza Plateau's pyramid-building days, which began with the fourth dynasty
in 2575 B.C. Experts say it's the oldest bakery found in Egypt, perhaps in the
world.;   To ancient Egyptians, king or commoner, bread was an everyday
staple, taken with a bit of onion or garlic and a swig of beer. Money didn't
exist, and bread was doled out as partial payment to those who inched massive
stones into the towering pyramids that still evoke awe after 4,600 years.;  
14 kinds of bread; Records from the period describe at least 14 kinds of
bread. So far the team of American and Egyptian Egyptologists working 1 1/2
miles from the Sphinx has found three kinds of bread molds: small and large
bell-shaped, and flat trays. The largest earthenware molds weigh 22 pounds.;  
The dig began in October, financed by business executives David Koch of New
York and Bruce Ludwig of Los Angeles. Diggers found the bakery in November.
After the season's work ends this month, team members plan to study the art of
bread-making using ingredients available then.;   "I have to admit I'm not a
baking expert, which would help," said Lehner, the excavation's co-director.
He said tomb artists left some baking clues, though much was left to the
imagination.;   Bread-baking is pictured on tomb walls of a fifth-dynasty
official named Ty in the cemetery of Sakkara south of the pyramids.;   "We
didn't know for sure until now that this scene was real. We didn't have a
bakery to compare it with," said expedition co-director Zahi Hawass, in charge
of antiquities in the pyramids-Sakkara area.;   Baked in clay pots; A room in
the bakery contains three large earthenware vats beside rows of grooves for
bread pots lined up like eggs in a carton.;   The excavation has revealed
generally how bakers did their work. They took a "bedja," a heated, greased
bread pot, and put the rounded end into a baking pit. They poured in the dough
and placed an inverted pot on top. Both pots were covered with heated coals
and ash, causing the dough to rise and bake.;   For those making the bread,
working conditions were nightmarish.;   Heat was intense. Smoke was so thick
"these rooms would have been like a night sky filled with rain," Lehner said.
"We've dug through 1 1/2 feet of black-velvet, built-up ash."  </TEXT>
