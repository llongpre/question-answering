<LEADPARA>  RENOWNED tourists spots are almost invariably disappointing. The Mona Lisa
bakes under glass, and reflections of tourists elbowing toward her ruin her
famous smile. The Grand Canyon is usually shrouded in haze. To get into the
Empire State Building, you have to maneuver past shady characters hawking
phony Rolex watches. The Tower of Pisa is closed, and London Bridge has been
moved to Arizona. Six of the seven original Wonders of the World no longer
exist.;    But the pyramids are still magic. Provided you get there before
dawn.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Why get out of bed so early? Because at 5:45 a.m., you have 4,500 years of
history all to yourself. If 100,000 workers can lug 2.3 million stone blocks
without so much as a wheel, then you can get up before sunrise to see them in
their pastel beauty.;    Don't take my word for it. The guard says that
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak often takes visitors to the site at 6 a.m.
because that is when the Sphinx and the Pyramids of Giza are in their best
light.;    In the cool desert before dawn, there's just enough moisture to wet
the back of a parched throat. As dawn approaches, a lone soldier, wrapped in a
sheet like a modern-day mummy, stands in front of the Sphinx. Behind the
66-foot-tall half-man, half-lion stand three dark, huge, mysterious triangles
eerily jutting out into the night. Soon the sun would rise from the desert
floor facing the Sphinx, and the Pyramids of Giza would turn a soft golden
brown.;    Slipping in;  The tourist books tell you the pyramids open at 8
a.m. But with a little baksheesh -- or tip -- you can go earlier.;    After 9
a.m., the desert begins to sizzle and the buses containing caravans of
invading tourists arrive. Tourists make fools of themselves trying to look
comfortable posing for photos on bony camels.;    The best views are those
with a little height, but climbing the pyramids is prohibited. That is, unless
you are there early and the night watchman offers to guide you to the top of
the pyramid for a little baksheesh. The views are stunning, although the
climbing is steep. The Great Pyramid of Khufu, or Cheops, rises 450 feet. Be
sure to bring bottled water, for once the sun emerges, it quickly gets hot.;  
 The ancient Egyptians built the pyramids to be tombs to preserve the bodies
of their kings. Believers in the occult say that mystical vibes are trapped in
the pyramids.;    But all is not well at this seventh wonder of the world. The
Sphinx, buried and unburied throughout the centuries, is deteriorating, having
been exposed to moisture, winds and traffic fumes. The pharaoh's beard is
gone, its nose has crumbled and its skin is pockmarked. Part of its right
shoulder caved in in 1988.;    Serious business;  Egyptians don't take these
things lightly. A 1982 rockfall cost the chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization his job. Now specialists say measures taken to help the Sphinx
may have hurt more than helped. So an international commission was formed to
save the Sphinx.;    Repairs are under way, but the poor Sphinx now has
instruments attached to its rear end to monitor air pollution, wind and
moisture. National Geographic reports that, if you probe below the limestone
base, "a red powder appears, as if the Sphinx were bleeding.";    But, at
least, peddlers are no longer allowed on the pyramid grounds. They just wait
outside for the 8 a.m. starting time.;    An early-rising peddler spies an
American leaving the grounds, and says, "Ah, Bush, Bush, very good." He
reaches into his pocket and pulls out a silver-plated medallion of the Sphinx.
"I want to give this to you to take to America, a souvenir," he says. "I want
to shake your hand. Can you give me a souvenir of some American dollars?" he
says.;    The Persian Gulf war was disastrous to Egypt's tourist industry. "So
far it hasn't picked up," says Hamdi Saad El-Din, director of the Egyptian
Tourist Authority. "People were afraid. But we have never had one incident of
terrorism involving an American. Egypt is a very strong ally. You get the best
value in the world here now because we floated the Egyptian pound.";    Cairo
is remarkably inexpensive. For example, the cost for a car and driver for
three hours was $7.;    A deluxe hotel room at the Intercontinental with a
balcony overlooking the Nile is $100 a night. Silver goods cost one-third of
prices in the States. A pair of engraved silver earrings goes for $9, a good
meal $10.;    At the pyramids, as 8 a.m. nears, it's time to go. The sun is
already beating down on camel drivers, and the shopkeepers squint as they open
their stores. One Egyptian man kisses his camel for the cameras, hoping for a
tip. Another naps near the chairs set up for the evening's sight-and-sound
light show.;    We beat the traffic back into town and have breakfast near
tourists headed to the pyramids.;    Outside, the Nile shimmers and the buses
stutter inch by inch up the avenue toward the pyramids, just outside the city.
It's only 10 a.m., but there's another appointment to keep. It's at the health
club for a massage to soothe the aching muscles. Another bargain -- $6 for an
hour.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; Egyptian Tourist Authority, 323 Geary St., Suite
