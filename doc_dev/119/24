   ``Pyramid,'' a PBS special on Monday night, is
about some world-famous monuments dedicated to the notion that you
CAN take it with you.
   Based on David Macaulay's 1975 book, ``Pyramid'' combines
location shots of some of Egypt's greatest wonders with an animated
cartoon story weaving historical gossip about royal family intrigues
and speculation on how the tombs were built, some of them more than
4,000 years ago.
   The show clearly explains the details of construction, although
plot twists in the animation, a kind of ``docudrama'' historical
cartoon strip, tend to get a little too convoluted.
   From 3,000 to 1,100 B.C., Egypt was ruled by kings called
pharaohs. The Egyptians believed that when pharaohs died they became
gods, so their tombs were the largest and most elaborate of all.
   The ancient Egyptians also considered death the beginning of a
new life in another world. This life would last forever, they
believed, if certain precautions were taken, including preserving
corpses by mummification.
   A pyramid's burial chamber held the mummy and all the objects,
actual and symbolic, that would help the person's spirit, known as
the ka, survive in the afterlife.
   ``One of the reasons we have such a rich legacy of artifacts and
information, much of it about everyday life, is that much of it was
entombed for use in the next world,'' said Macaulay, who has
published 14 other books, including his latest, ``The Way Things
Work.''
   The show includes a visit to a museum with an exhibit of a
replica taken from a pyramid of an Egyptian cattle dealer. He
``wanted to take his business with him,'' said Macaulay, who serves
as the show's host and guide, ``and so he did _ in a model. He even
had some accountants in the model to make sure he wasn't
shortchanged.
   ``The models were as important as real life. They were the real
thing; they weren't just models in the minds of the Egyptians,''
Macaulay said in an interview.
   Macaulay spent several weeks on location in February 1986. ``We
were given access to all sorts of things that people are not
normally given access to,'' he said. ``We had, for instance, the
Cairo museum to ourselves for three nights running.''
   The film goes beyond the book by showing the urban sprawl that is
encroaching on the historical sites. There are, for example, some
glimpses of pyramids near modern residential neighborhoods of Giza,
a suburb of Cairo.
   ``You can get shots of them from the desert side, and it looks
like there's nothing around them. But if you shoot them from the
building side, you end up with little buildings that are five or six
stories high in front of these pyramids and for the first time you
really get a sense of the scale of these pyramids.''
   The great pyramid at Giza is 481 feet high or about the size of a
40-story office building. It was built with more than 2 million
blocks of stone, some weighing 15 tons, and covers the equivalent of
seven square blocks of midtown Manhattan. It stretches 755 feet on
each of its four sides and is so close to geometric perfection that
the difference between the longest and shortest side is only 7
inches.
   In the book, the pyramid and complex of surrounding temples and
tombs are imaginary. They are, however, based closely on several of
the pyramids and temples still standing in Egypt.
   The show's script was written by Marc Olshaker, who also was
producer, in cooperation with Macaulay and a group of five
Egyptologists from the United States and Egypt.
   ``Pyramid'' is the third PBS production by Unicorn Projects,
which also did specials on two previous Macaulay books,
``Cathedral'' in 1986 and ``Castle'' in 1983.
