   He was an ancient Egyptian turncoat,
backbone of the pharaoh's government one day and strong right arm
of the conquering Persians the next.
   Most of what the world knows of Udjahorresnet comes from
inscriptions on his statue in the Vatican collection, which boast
of his calculated opportunism and the power his treachery won him.
   But it's a tale without an end _ the finale missing, the last
lines obscured.
   Now, in the depths of a desert burial maze, Czechoslavak
scientists are finding clues to the fate of one of pharaonic
Egypt's dastardly personalities.
   Almost 60 feet down, at the foot of a central shaft cut through
soft petrified clay and filled with sand, the team discovered a
burial chamber.
   ``What a shock to see his name, Udjahorresnet, in such an
unexpected place, away from his home'' in the Nile delta, ``away
from his Persian connections,'' said Miroslav Verner, head of
Egyptology at Charles University in Prague.
   ``It was thrilling,'' Verner said. ``His name is what all
Egyptologists learn first when they study the Persian takeover of
Egypt. ... He was a dark personage, a man known for his betrayal.''
   Verner has been field director since 1976 of a Czechoslavak
archaeological mission in Abusir, an ancient burial and religious
center 18 miles southwest of Cairo.
   Mission scientists discovered a series of rubble-filled shafts
in 1981 on a site misidentified 150 years earlier as a pyramid
ruin. Verner's 10-man team and colleagues from the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization began excavating last November.
   Udjahorresnet took few chances in life and fewer in death. The
maze of shafts he commissioned used a traditional method for
repelling robbers by filling shafts with sand, and was more
intricate than others found in Egypt.
   He was a trusted official of the 26th-dynasty Pharaoh Psamtik
III, then turned up as colonial administrator after Cambyses of
Persia conquered Egypt in 525 B.C.
   Little is known of Udjahorresnet's later life.
   ``The last we knew of him, he was leading an Egyptian army to
help the Persians under Darius I, Cambyses' son, put down internal
strife,'' Verner said. ``Then he disappeared from history. The
final lines on his statue are damaged unreadably and no tomb was
ever found.''
   That obscurity may be about to end.
   In the limestone chamber at the bottom of the Abusir shaft,
excavators found a megalith-sized sarcophagus sheltering an inner
coffin with decorated sides. They bore the name Udjahorresnet.
   The chamber held neither a mummy nor major funerary articles,
but Verner said team members found five small statuettes with the
names of Udjahorresnet and his parents, and a list of his titles.
   Since the 1960s, the pyramid-domed sands of Abusir have yielded
several major finds to Czech archaeologists: the oldest papyri
found in Egypt, the oldest hall with standing columns and several
spectacular statues dating from the fifth dynasty, more than 4,000
years ago.
   Once considered a stepchild of its famous neighbor, the Giza
Plateau, Abusir became one of Egypt's most exciting archaeological
sites.
   Because of his important titles _ Egypt's chief physician and
overseer of the royal navy and Greek mercenaries _ Udjahorresnet
would have been ``a man in the know when the Persian invasion
came,'' Verner said.
   ``History doesn't record his exact role,'' the archaeologist
said, ``but the next thing we know after Egypt's defeat is that
this man was part of the Persian regime, close to Cambyses: his man
in Egypt, you might say, highly rewarded for his new loyalty.
   ``Udjahorresnet even boasts ... that he put together Egyptian
titles for the new Persian ruler. He was a 100 percent quisling, an
opportunist.''
   His statue, obtained by the Vatican collection 200 years ago, is
thought to have left Egypt with the Roman Emperor Hadrian early in
the second century.
   Hadrian was a restless traveler and protector of the arts who
appropriated the beautiful and strange to adorn the imperial villa
at Tivoli near Rome.
   The architect of Udjahorresnet's tomb used sand, in an
hour-glass effect, first to lower the massive sarcophagus and then
to seal the passages, Verner said. The burial chamber's roof
contained holes with clay pots beneath, which the last worker broke
one-by-one as he left through a side shaft so sand would flow in
from a shaft above, the archaeologist said.
   At least four grave-robbing forays were made into the shaft, the
latest in medieval tims. Verner said robbers finally tunneled
through the soft rock and penetrated the basalt coffin by using
fire and water alternately to weaken it.
   ``During their robberies, the thieves lived in the shafts,'' he
said. ``We know all about them from rubbish they left'' and the
soot from their fires.
