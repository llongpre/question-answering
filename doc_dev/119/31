   The National Geographic Society released
pictures today of an Egyptian boat photographed with special
equipment in a stone chamber where the royal vessel was entombed
beside the Great Pyramid of Khufu 4,600 years ago.
   National Geographic officials said the photographs were taken
with remote cameras lowered through a drill hole and that the
chamber then was sealed, leaving the ancient craft undisturbed in
its resting place.
   A similar boat was found in a chamber nearby in 1954. That
142-foot-long craft was excavated, reassembled and put in a museum
specially constructed for its display. Officials said that boat now
is decaying rapidly.
   But new techniques permitted experts from the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization and from the United States to survey the
new boat using remote cameras, the National Geographic announced
today. The boat was documented last October and its chamber then
was sealed with the craft untouched.
   The National Geographic said in a release that a joint
U.S.-Egyptian team of scientists had hoped that the chamber
containing the new boat had remained airtight during the 46
centuries since it was sealed.
   In an effort to capture samples of that air, the scientists used
a drill enclosed in an air lock. An arrangement of vacuum tubes was
used to suck the chamber's air into storage tanks for analysis.
   ``The air in the chamber proved to be moderately polluted urban
air,'' said Pieter Tans, a scientist from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration who analyzed the samples.
   He said this proves that the chamber was not sealed and
possibily never was. Samples of the cap of the chamber, said Tans,
showed that the rock was a light limestone.
   ``The rock was so permiable that this pit probably has never
been sealed,'' he said.
   Remote television pictures taken inside the chamber detected a
beetle, which immediately proved, officials said, that the chamber
had been unsealed for some time.
   Tans said the insect was identified as a common desert beetle
that feeds on fungi that is commonly found in decaying wood.
   Television and still cameras lowered into the drill hole were
able to document the entire interior of the boat chamber. The TV
camera used fiber optics to light the chamber. In this way, the
lights added no heat to tomb environment.
   Photos released by the National Geographic show a mound of cedar
timbers collapsed to the floor of a long chamber that had been cut
with precision out of solid limestone bedrock.
   Scientists studying the pictures have identified various boat
parts, including oar blades, deckhouse and hull planking. There was
no sign of a mast, sail or rigging.
   The video camera detected hieroglyphic markings on the ceiling
of the chamber. The National Geographic interpreted these symbols
as measurements and as the name of the team of workers who carved
the stone used in the chamber.
   The National Geographic announcement said the purposes of the
boat, and of its sister craft excavated in 1954, remain a mystery.
   ``Why did the ancient Egyptians disassemble and bury two
full-size royal ships at the base of the Great Pyramid?'' the
announcement asks.
   The boats are thought to have been entombed to honor the Pharoah
Khufu by his son and successor Djedefre, according to the National
Geographic.
   But it is not known if the boats were used to bring Khufu's body
on the Nile from his palace at Memphis to the pyramid at Giza, or
if the craft were entombed in the belief that Khufu would use them
in an afterlife.
   A report on the exploration of the boat chamber is carried in
the April issue of National Geographic, the monthly magazine of the
National Geographic Society.
