   A computerized weather station atop
the Sphinx will begin transmitting data that scientists hope will
help them stop the monument's alarming decay.
   ``The Sphinx has deteriorated more in the last 50 years than in
all previous centuries of its existence combined,'' Sayed Tawfik,
Egypt's chairman of antiquities, said Tuesday.
   The $200,000 solar-powered station was developed by the Getty
Conservation Institute of Marina del Rey, Calif., for a project in
China and was adapted for the Sphinx.
   People have worked for thousands of years to keep the
4,600-year-old crouching lion with a pharaoh's face from falling
apart, but nothing has worked for very long.
   Rocks still fall from the structure, located at the base of the
Giza Pyramids. A large stone fell from the great beast's shoulder
in February 1988, provoking an international outcry.
   The massive stone face now is covered with scaffolding. Egyptian
conservationists are removing and replacing blocks already restored
on the right paw and sides, trying to make the Sphinx look like its
old self.
   The 200-pound, 6{ foot-tall weather station, installed Tuesday,
sits piggyback on the Sphinx's back, held in place by sandbags.
   Scientists said the monitor will remain in place for at least a
year, transmitting data to a computer a mile away.
   It will monitor rainfall, wind direction and speed, relative
humidity, pollutants, temperature and the effects of water and salt
on the limestone layers that make up the statue. All are possible
causes of the monument's problems, said Frank Preusser, acting
co-director of the Getty conservation team.
   An adjacent instrument measures solar radiation.
   Preusser said data from the new project should help Egyptian
officials develop a plan to save the Sphinx.
   ``The Sphinx s perhaps the most famed, and by far the most
thoroughly documented and scrutinized, monument of the ancient
world,'' he said. ``There has never been a coordinated effort to
methodically quantify and examine ... factors affecting it.
   ``We can't stop deterioration of any monument in the world, but
there is always a solution to slowing the decay.''
   Tawfik called the Sphinx ``the greatest symbol of our heritage.''
