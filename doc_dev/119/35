   To save Ethel St. Lawrence from the aneurysm
pressing on her brain, doctors ``killed'' her for 40 minutes. They
put her in a coma, stopped her heart, chilled her by 40 degrees and
drained her body of blood.
   St. Lawrence was back at work 10 weeks after what she calls ``a
cotton-pickin' miracle,'' a sort of suspended animation that lets
surgeons cure hard-to-reach, high-risk aneurysms that once were
considered inoperable.
   ``It is everything that technology can possibly offer,'' said
her neurosurgeon, Dr. Robert Spetzler at Barrow Neurological
Institute in Phoenix.
   ``It may be the surgery of the future in cases where bleeding
poses the greatest risk to the operation,'' said Dr. Julian E.
Bailes, a neurosurgeon at Allegheny General Hospital here who
studied with Spetzler. ``That's the biggest cause of death in
surgery. If you could put someone in a state of suspended
animation, you could operate in a totally bloodless field.''
   In a severely cold, bloodless state, the brain can be deprived
of oxygen up to 55 minutes, giving surgeons time to remove the
aneurysm _ a bubble caused by weakness in the wall of a blood
vessel _ and clip arteries feeding it without the danger of massive
bleeding and certain death.
   Of 15 patients who have undergone the procedure at Barrow, only
one has died, Bailes said. Most had ``excellent'' results, a few
reported some weakness but otherwise did well, and most remained in
a coma no more than five days.
   But the risks, including that the heart won't restart, are too
great to use the procedure where normal anesthesia can adequately
do the job.
   And because the patient has to be taken to the point of clinical
death for the operation to succeed, doctors approach it with ``a
lot of respect,'' said Dr. Steven Shedd, a Barrow
neuroanesthesiologist who worked on St. Lawrence.
   St. Lawrence, a 61-year-old Phoenix secretary, had surgery June
6. She now needs no medication and the severe headaches are gone,
though she still is unable to fully open her eye.
   Cecilia Duffy, a 76-year-old Pittsburgh woman, hasn't come out
of the coma induced Aug. 31 to remove an aneurysm. Her brain
activity is improving, there is no evidence of brain injury, and
she moves her legs when stimulated, but doctors don't know why she
doesn't wake up.

<HEAD>Augustine Research May Provide Valuable Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTINE VOLCANO, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Working from a plywood shack
and tents perched on the flank of Augustine Volcano, researchers
are setting up a high-tech system to measure the volcano's shudders
to within an inch.
   When they're done, scientists using briefcase-sized laser
instruments ``could detect less than that, but it's a matter of
whether you believe it,'' says Gene Iwatsubo of the U.S. Geological
Survey, one of the researchers trying to puzzle out how the volcano
works and whether its eruptions can be predicted.
   ``The thrust of the research is to try to find precursors, signs
of eruption,'' says Juergen Kienle, a University of Alaska
geophysics professor. ``The more precursors you have, the better
off you are.''
   Augustine Volcano juts 4,000 feet out of Kamishak Bay on the
west side of Cook Inlet. It appears benign but there have been six
major eruptions since its discovery in 1778. One, in 1883,
triggered a 30-foot wave that destroyed houses and boats at Port
Graham, nearly 50 miles away.
   Computer models show a slide-generated tsunami would reach
Homer, a Kachemak Bay fishing community of 4,000 people about 70
miles away, in about an hour. A smaller wave would reach Anchorage,
175 miles away, three hours later.
   Information that may enable scientists to predict eruptions
accurately at Augustine may be of great value to other parts of the
world where millions of people live in the shadows of volcanoes _
or on them.
   Four seismographs ring the volcano at an elevation of about
1,000 feet and two are near the peak. Three sets of tiltmeters
measure changes in the surface.

<HEAD>Restorers Tackle Massive Great Pyramid for First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, pocked
by thousands of years of vandalism and stone-robbing, is finally
getting a facelift.
   The effort to clean rubbish from between the massive limestone
blocks and to tighten loose rocks marks the first restoration work
ever attempted on the outside of the sole survivor of the ancient
world's Seven Wonders.
   ``This is not just cosmetic work,'' said Zahi Hawass, Egyptian
Antiquities Organization director-general for the pyramids area.
``We're afraid unless we do something to stabilize the outer
stones, there could be a tragedy.''
   Work began inside the Great Pyramid last winter to remove salt
that oozed through the limestone onto inside walls. The outside
work began last month.
   From a distance, the pyramid appears fine. Close up, it's
obviously far from healthy. Many of the massive blocks, weighing an
average 2{ tons, have eroded or disappeared. Others hang
precariously on uneven ledges.
   In 1976, a stone weighing several tons fell from the southern
side. No one was injured because tourists were being kept away
during a dignitary's visit, Hawass said. ``We chose to begin
(restoration) with Cheops Pyramid first, because we know there's a
chance more stones will fall.''
   When put in place 4,600 years ago, the estimated 2.3 million
blocks were assembled with such skill that only a thin sheet of
paper would pass between.
   The new project aims at duplicating such precision. Workers
skilled in climbing scurry over the rocks, binding loose stones
with natural mortar like that used by the ancients and repairing
damage caused by millenia of nesting birds, desert animals and
human ravagers.
