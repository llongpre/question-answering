   Dallas beat out San Antonio in a Texas-sized
duel for the right to hold an exhibition featuring artifacts of
Ramses II, one of Egypt's greatest pharaohs.
   Cairo's archaeological circles dubbed it the second ``Gunfight
at the O.K. Corral.''
   Each city was armed with what it considered a valid
letter-of-intent signed by Egyptian officials promising the popular
exhibit of the pharoah who ruled Egypt 3,200 years ago.
   The Ramses exhibit will go to the Museum of Natural History in
Dallas in April and then return to Egypt. A compromise worked out
Thursday won't leave San Antonio empty-handed.
   The San Antonio Museum of Art will be second in line for ``Art
of Ancient Egypt,'' a new exhibition of art treasures from Egypt's
Nile Delta region. The exhibit debuts in November at Washington's
National Gallery and then travels to San Antonio in March 1990.
   ``I think it's a good solution,'' said Zahi Hawass, the
archaeological adviser to Egypt's Minister of Culture who drafted
the compromise.
   The Ramses exhibit opened in Montreal in 1985 and is on display
in Boston.
   The U.S. tour opened in Provo, Utah, in October 1985, and it has
been an attraction at Jacksonville, Fla.; Memphis, Tenn.; and
Denver. It heads to Charlotte, N.C., in September before moving to
Dallas.
   Hawass said the problem between Dallas and San Antonio occurred
because both cities thought the Ramses exhibit was going to their
museums.
   ``Dallas has been interested in Ramses for about two years,'' he
said. ``And there is letter signed by Egyptian officials, which
Dallas considered a letter of intent, and San Antonio later signed
a regular letter of intent.
   ``So we were left with two cities, each wanting Ramses and each
thinking its letter was legal. We had to reach some sort of
solution.''
   Money from both exhibits will help finance a new Museum of the
Egyptian Civilization to be built in Cairo and the Nubia Museum at
Aswan, 615 miles to the south.
   Hawass said Dallas' contract calls for payment to the Egyptian
Antiquities Organization of $750,000, plus $100,000 for the use of
a 27-foot-tall Ramses statue restored by Egyptian and American
experts in honor of the exhibition.
   He said the agreement also calls for the organization to receive
5 percent of profits from the catalog and related items sold in the
museum shop.
   ``In the past Egypt didn't get a proper financial return for its
exhibits sent abroad. The Tutankhamun exhibit that toured England
and the United States is the best example,'' Hawass said. ``We know
every museum hosting such an exhibit makes $10 million to $12
million. Each exhibit draws more than a million viewers.''
   The exhibit featured gold and other items from Pharaoh
Tutankhamun's tomb, which toured several countries in the 1970s.
Egyptian officials complained that contracts were too tightly
drawn, leaving them out in the cold as far as sharing the profits.
   Hawass said the Culture Ministry has decided to demand for
future exhibits a minimum of $850,000, plus 50 percent from the
sale of catalogues and other items.
   ``We take a risk in sending artifacts out of Egypt,'' he said.
