   Construction workers carving out a
road for an elite Mediterranean resort bulldozed their way into an
ancient world under a blanket of seaside sand.
   They had stumbled upon a city more than 2,000 years old and
stretching for more than a mile along Egypt's coastline 125 miles
west of Alexandria.
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Ali Hassan, who controls Egyptian
Antiquities Organization operations in the region. ``Other
countries get excited about finding an ancient house. We have a
whole city. It's without equal in all of Egypt.''
   The bulldozers were stopped a month after the ruins were
discovered in 1985. By that time, a road had been sliced through
what appears to have been an ancient temple, but much more remained.
   A few months later, Egyptian and Polish archaeologists began
excavating the ruins, without letting word out, and what they've
found over the last three years is in remarkable condition.
   ``What we have in hand is a golden egg, undisturbed, a complete
city that changed with time,'' said Hassan, director general of
Pharaonic monuments. ``It's not only a city of the dead, but also a
city of the living, side by side. It's something very rare and very
important.''
   The city, believed to have been founded in the second century
B.C., lasted more than 500 years. As excavators intruded on its
serenity since 1986, antiquities officials have worked quietly in
Cairo to save the site from further destruction.
   The still-unidentified city now peeks in and out of its sandy
grave.
   To one side stands a row of ultramodern apartments built along
the coastline by Egypt's Ministry of Housing. A new apartment
complex was to have been erected on top of what turned out to be
the ruins.
   ``The site is under our protection,'' said Sayeed Tawfik,
chairman of the antiquities organization. ``Nothing can happen to
it now.''
   Only a small area has been excavated, but archaeologists already
have discovered well-preserved houses, vast cemeteries with
decorated and undecorated tombs, catacombs, a bath, a basilica and
many artifacts, imported and local, including statues and frescoes.
   Egyptian excavators are now at work. In February they'll be
rejoined by 10 Polish archaeologists and restorers to make detailed
surveys of the site and its needs.
   They already have restored critical pieces that had begun to
disintegrate since the bulldozing of the road.
   Walking through the excavations, Feisal Mohammed Ashmy, the
antiquities inspector in charge of the ancient city, pointed toward
mounds of toppled marble columns. They lay at the beside a ditch
cut 35 feet wide and 10 feet deep by the grading equipment.
   ``Before the bulldozers got here, this was a temple, I think.
It's terrible, but we now have to focus on saving what's left,'' he
said.
   ``There's so much. All you have to do is to look down, and
history says, `Take me.'''
   Early historians recorded a number of small coastal cities along
Egypt's Mediterranean coastline. Villages of white houses, fishing
boats and nets, and later the domes of early Christian churches,
dotted the landscape. Vineyards, olive groves, fruit trees and
almonds were plentiful. Families on outings sailed to outlying
islands to drink wine.
   W.A. Daszewski, head of the Polish Archaeological Institite in
Egypt and an expert in the Greco-Roman period, said he's delighted
with the find.
   ``This is a great opportunity for us to see how it was. It's a
unique chance to understand the quality of housing during this
period,'' he said in an interview.
   ``This was a landowners' city. ... They probably had farms
inland, but residents preferred to have their houses along the
coast because of the cooler climate.''
   Excavated houses are large, with complex systems that carried
rainwater from the roof to basement cisterns. Some are elaborately
decorated with pillars, niches, statues and delicate frescoes.
   ``The architectural decoration in the city is first class and
well-preserved,'' Daszewski said.
   Designs on tombs range from simple pits through small step
pyramids to magnificent, multistoried funerary complexes. Daszewski
said burials date from the second century B.C. to the end of the
third century A.D., but he believes the city existed in some form
until the early seventh century.
   Daszewski said he knows of two possible names for the city:
Leucaspis _ white shield _ which would refer to a sandspit that
protected the harbor; and Antiphre or Antiphra, a city mentioned as
late as the fourth century A.D. because of a bishop who hailed from
there.
   ``Both are possibilities, but we have a basilica here, so the
city existed during early Christian times,'' Daszewski said. ``I
rather think it's Antiphre, but it's possible the city was called
one thing, the harbor area another. We don't know.''
   The Polish and Egyptian archaeologists predict it'll be years
before excavation and restoration is completed.
   ``Maybe 10, maybe 15, maybe more,'' said antiquities official
Ali Hassan.
