<HEAD>Millennium Society Says Bush May Attend 1999 Bash in Egypt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President-elect Bush is spending this New
Year's holiday at Camp David, Md., but in 11 years he may be in
Egypt.
   Organizers of the Millennium Society say he's already committed
to ushering in the next century at the Great Pyramids of Cheops in
Giza, Egypt.
   The society, founded in 1979 by New York attorney Edward McNally,
holds annual balls in several cities around the world, with ticket
contributions channeled to charity.
   But those parties are just a warm-up for the big bash in 1999 at
12 noon, Greenwich Mean Time, outside Cairo.
   McNally, who was a student at Yale University when he conceived
of the society, nine years ago invited Bush to attend the 1999,
black-tie ceremony. At that time, McNally was at Notre Dame law
school.
   Bush, in a tongue-and-cheek vein, responded to McNally in a
hand-written note dated Jan. 7, 1999.
   ``Dear Ed,'' Bush wrote.
   ``The last two decades have been rough, but you are doing well on
the Supreme Court. We are still fine. I think back to Jan. 21, 1980,
when we did well in Iowa. (We did _ didn't we.) I'm getting older,
but we still miss you.
   _George Bush''
   In 1985, Bush, then the vice president, prepared a statement that
was read at the society's New Year's Eve balls here and in Beijing,
China.
   ``Barbara and I wish you the best of luck in the next year, and
we're looking forward to your celebration in Egypt in 1999,'' Bush
said.
   He said he and his wife ``fervently support the society's
dedication to education, international understanding and world
peace.''
   The society, which charged $70 for tickets, is a non-profit group
that donates money to an international scholars program. The
students are selected to attend the United World Colleges, a
worldwide group of colleges headed by the Prince of Wales.
