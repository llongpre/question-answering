   Move over, Rover. This is cat city.
   They're everywhere. Pyramids have cats. Apartment stairwells
have them, and offices, and hospital examination rooms. Cats prowl
hotel lobbies and restaurants. Theaters have cats, and bazaars have
cats.
   Even an airplane had one. It made front-page headlines: ``Cat
Forces Plane Back to Cairo.''
   The story tried to explain how a cat found its way into the
cockpit of an Air Sinai flight headed for Sharm el-Sheik on the Red
Sea.
   Once airborne, the cat made a great fuss about risking one of
its nine lives in such a manner. Its howls caused ``pandemonium
among the 31 passengers,'' the article said, forcing the pilot to
turn back.
   Such cat stories abound in Egypt, where felines have a storied
history. Cats were worshiped even before there were pharaohs, and
remained sacred long after the pharaohs were gone.
   The singing cats of El-Gomhouriya, a theater where operas are
performed, are famous throughout the city.
   Hassan Kamy, Egypt's leading tenor, has been upstaged several
times.
   ``It was the last act of `La Boheme','' he said in an interview.
``I was holding the dying Mimi in my arms. The orchestra was
silenced for the finale. A cat walked onto stage.
   ``At first, the audience simply giggled quietly, but the cat
took a long time getting across the stage and I kept holding the
dying Mimi. Finally, the audience was in hysterics.''
   Then there is Kamy's tale of two cats, another opera and a lamp:
   The lamp ``was a stage prop,'' he said. ``All was fine until two
cats decided to walk onstage and go to sleep at the base.
   ``It was act three, a love duet. You could feel the emotion in
the air, the audience getting hotter. But so were the cats.
   ``They chose this moment to begin a romantic interlude under the
lamp. The higher the diva sang, the higher they sang. ... The next
day, newspapers asked, `Which had the greater range, the soprano or
the the cats?'''
   Cats made another artistic headline last year by disrupting an
Italian group's performance at an Experimental Theater Festival.
   The avant-garde play was set on a beach and the actors insisted
the stage be covered with sand a foot deep.
   Midway through the performance, cats wandered onto the stage and
began doing what cats often do in sand. The actors were horrified;
the audience howled.
   ``What can you do?'' Kamy said. ``Nobody will touch a cat. Even
now, in the villages, people are scared of them, afraid to harm
them or anger them. Cats are sacred in Egypt.''
   In ancient times, a favorite goddess was the cat Bastet, sleek
and sensual.
   Short-haired, long-legged house cats, domesticated from wilder
strains, are depicted in tomb paintings enjoying life's better
things. They were much loved in life, much mourned at death.
   About 2,000 years ago, worshipers buried mummified cats near
Bastet's sacred temples.
   Cat mummies, embalmed and wrapped in intricate bandages, were
dedicated by the thousands. Archaeologists uncovered 300,000 in one
temple.
   Even cat fetuses were mummified sometimes, and occasionally
buried with a tiny mouse or ball of yarn.
   Mummified or live, ancient cats never lost their special status.
An official record tells of a Roman soldier in Alexandria who
accidentally killed a cat. A mob killed the soldier.
   Owning an Egyptian cat was such a mark of prestige that
Phoenician and Greek traders, and Christian monks, did big business
exporting them to the Far East and around the Mediterranean area,
especially to Italy.
   Trade ended when a place had enough cats to start its own
colony. Thus did Rome, not Cairo, gain fame as the world's cat
capital.
   Islamic invasions in the seventh century and afterward disrupted
many aspects of life in Egypt, but Moslems viewed the whiskered
pets as good omens that protected home and family.
   The prophet Mohammed is said to have been fond of cats. One
story says he awoke from a nap and wanted to get out of bed, but
found a cat asleep on his robe. Rather than wake the cat, he cut
the robe.
   In the Middle Ages, while their cousins were being killed in
Europe as agents of black magic, Egyptian cats were pampered, as
usual.
   In the 13th century, Islamic rulers of Cairo established a
special garden for stray cats where attendants served them food,
with pomp, each afternoon.
   The tradition of feeding strays remained strong in the 19th
century. English travelers wrote home that special servants were
assigned each afternoon to feed street cats, which were
well-mannered despite questionable pedigrees.
   Cairo's cats still are fed well. Even poor peasants share their
bread with stray cats, beckoning them with the pet name Mish-Mish _
Arabic for apricot, the most common color of Egyptian cats.
