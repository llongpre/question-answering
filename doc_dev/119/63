   Scientists who experimented with
an ancient corpse nicknamed Lady X have developed a new type of
museum case to protect from decay such priceless relics as mummies
and the Dead Sea Scrolls.
   The technique involves construction of hermetically sealed
display cases filled with inert nitrogen gas.
   A small-scale prototype of the case, which contains temperature
and humidity sensors, a leak detector and almost no oxygen, was
unveiled Tuesday during a seminar attended by 100 scientists,
museum officials and Egyptian dignitaries.
   Lady X, a 3,000-year-old mummy, rested nearby in a less
sophisticated case. Scientists at the Getty Conservation Institute
used cotton swabs to collect bacteria and fungi from her surface
for use in tests that led to development of the new case.
   ``In the past, very little research has been done on the
conservation of organic materials,'' said Luis Monreal, director of
the institute.
   Included among organic materials, he said, are mummies,
parchment manuscripts, textiles and embroideries, artworks on paper
and relics made of leather, bone or wood.
   The institute, part of the J. Paul Getty Trust, plans to build a
full-size display case and test Lady X in it for one to three
months, said research director Frank Preusser.
   The mummy, a brown-skinned, 4-foot-10 woman believed to have
been a commoner, was shipped here from Cairo last September.
Discovered near Luxor in the 1960s, she was the first mummy sent
out of Egypt since the remains of Pharaoh Ramses II were taken to
Paris in 1976 for radiation treatment to halt fungal decay.
   Once research is completed, Egypt will build cases so mummies of
27 pharaohs and queens discovered in 1881 can be placed on display
for the first time, perhaps by May 1989, said Zahi Hawass, director
general of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization.
   Plans to display 15 of those mummies last October were canceled
to await results of the California research, he added.
   He said Egypt's government has extended its original six-month
contract with the institute for another six months to allow
completion of research on Lady X, who was nicknamed by an Egyptian
official.
   ``I'm afraid this mummy will stay here and ask for an American
green card,'' Hawass joked, referring to a temporary work permit.
   Monreal said the new case was designed to be built relatively
inexpensively so any country can use it to preserve organic
materials.
   He said the institute offered its findings to the Israel Museum
in Jerusalem if the museum wants to build cases to preserve the
Dead Sea Scrolls. The leather and papyrus manuscripts were
discovered in the 1940s and 1950s and contain all the books of the
Old Testament except Esther.
   Lady X probably was about 40 years old when she did. She lived
sometime during Egypt's New Kingdom period, from 1500 B.C. to 1050
B.C. Egypt has thousands of such mummies. Most were commoners.
   The mummies were perfectly preserved for millenia in tombs. But
after excavation, they became threatened by pollution, bacteria,
fungi and changes in temperature, humidity and light.
   Getty scientists didn't take tissue samples from Lady X.
Instead, the microbes they collected were grown on strips of
parchment placed in glass vials.
   Growth of the microbes was tested under varying conditions of
light, temperature, humidity and oxygen levels, said researcher
Nieves Valentin.
