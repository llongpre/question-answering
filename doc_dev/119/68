   EDITOR'S NOTE - It sounds like something Disney would do, build
replicas of the tombs of Egyptian pharaohs for the tourists to look
at. But the people responsible for preserving Egypt's antiquities
say they have little choice. The real tombs are deteriorating
rapidly in the crush of the tourist flow. To close them would mean
losing the tourist trade.

   Egypt's pharaohs built their tombs to last
an eternity. But some of the most magnificent of the royal resting
places may not make it much past the 20th century.
   A main spoiler is man.
   Drawn by ancient Egypt's aura of mystery, thousands of visitors
parade every day through the once off-limits world of dead pharaohs
and their queens. They violate tomb chambers designed by ancient
priests for one mummy-filled coffin.
   With that in mind, a Swiss group has come up with a
multimillion-dollar answer: Custom-built tombs, clustered in a new
``valley of death,'' especially groomed to accommodate mass
tourism.
   Give the tourists what they've come to see, but in facsimile.
   ``If you want to have your tourists and save your tombs,
building replicas is the only answer,'' says Theodor Abt, president
of the Zurich-based Society of Friends of the Royal Tombs of Egypt.
   ``We haven't a minute to lose,'' he says. ``Each time I come I'm
shocked to see what has happened. The world can't afford to give up
something so unique and precious.''
   Egyptian officials agree. In March they approved a proposal from
the society to duplicate two tombs: the tiny, gold-painted chamber
of the boy Pharaoh Tutankhamen, and the larger, beautifully
decorated tomb of Nefertari, powerful chief queen of warrior
Pharaoh Ramses II.
   They are among more than 400 tombs stretching for five miles
along the Nile River's western bank opposite ancient Thebes, now
Luxor, 450 miles south of Cairo.
   Saving both tombs has been a great worry for antiquities
officials.
   ``It's a wonderful project, the answer we've been searching
for,'' says Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization. ``Now we can save our tombs without depriving our
tourists of their beauty.
   ``And if we have to close one or more of them for restoration
and conservation, we won't feel so bad about it.''
   Tawfik says tourists still will be allowed in the original
tombs, but he expects the replicas ``to deflect masses away from
endangered ones.''
   Not even Egypt's mightiest kings foresaw that their secret
burial chambers, carved in valleys so desolate they were unfit for
the living, one day would attract a tourist boom of monumental
proportions.
   But they do. Each day 3,000 to 5,000 people crowd the land of
the dead, even in the horrendous heat of Upper Egypt's summer.
Humidity, dust and salt brought into the tombs by sweaty bodies and
the touch of countless fingers are eating away at the timeless but
fragile decorations on their walls.
   The only sure way to save them would be politically and
economically explosive: bar tour groups from the most popular
tombs. Most visitors travel in groups, carried across the Nile by
special launch and bused to the various valleys of death. Only
about two dozen tombs are open to the public at any one time.
   Permanently closing the tombs is an option that's hardly figured
in years of debate over monument conservation because of a national
push to bring ever more tourists into Egypt.
   Some 2 million visitors now pump $2 billion a year into Egypt's
dollar-starved economy. The government predicts the number of
tourists will double within the next few years.
   For antiquities officials, whose job is to protect relics,
copying the best and most endangered tombs offers an acceptable
alternative to locking doors. It leaves room for tourist expansion.
   Also, the replicas will be tombs with a difference. Tourists
will see them as the ancients did, not the faded and damaged
chambers visited today. And with modern touches: one-way traffic
and air conditioning.
   Abt, a Zurich psychoanalyst, says engineers have selected the
bone-dry, fault-filled Western Valley for the reproductions, lying
just over the hills from the tombs of Tutankhamen and fellow
pharaohs.
   The Western Valley was chosen because of ``its beauty and
emptiness. The sacred atmosphere so important to early tomb
builders is something we don't have to duplicate,'' Abt says.
``It's already there.''
   The West Bank's most popular tourist spot is the Valley of the
Kings, where New Kingdom rulers were buried for 500 years.
   But ancient architects originally gave the royal nod to the
Western Valley, where they placed the mummy of pharaoh Amenophis
III in 1353 B.C. The area later was abandoned in favor of valleys
to the east and south.
   Abt says plans call for the first cluster of duplicate tombs to
include, in addition to Tutankhamen's and Nefertari's, those of the
warrior Pharaoh Tuthmosis III and two non-royals, Sennedjem, a
court official, and labor foreman Inherkhau.
   He estimates each cluster will cost as much as $80 million,
raised in a campaign like the 1960s UNESCO drive that saved the
monuments of Abu Simbel and other Nubian sites south of Luxor.
   Abt says duplicate tombs will be low-slung, built to disguise
their locations and decorated by Egyptians using techniques of the
ancients. Originally, tombs were dug into the landscape to hide
them from would-be robbers after the riches accompanying the dead
pharaoh into the afterlife.
   ``Each cluster will be built against the mountains and covered
with rocks to give the same feeling of antiquity as the ancient
tombs,'' Abt says.
   To ensure that each tomb will be correct historically, the Swiss
group's 50 international members include as vice president an
authority on the West Bank burial grounds, Basel professor Erik
Hornung.
   While new in Egypt, building replicas to save antiquities is not
a new concept.
   French officials closed the Lescaux Caves near Montignac in 1963
after 100,000 visitors surged in the previous year to see the
monuments' prehistoric paintings. In 1983 a facsimile was opened,
which today awes 400,000 visitors annually.
   Spain currently is seeking money to reproduce 12,000-year-old
wall paintings of bison and horses at its Altamira Caves. The
tourist crush in the main cave became so great in 1982 that it too
had to be closed.
