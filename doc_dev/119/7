   A tomb built 4,300 years ago for a
palace official and his two wives has been found in the shadow of
the Giza Pyramids, the first unknown tomb discovered on the plateau
since the mid-1950s.
   ``This is the first time we've seen such a tomb,'' said Zahi
Hawass, director general of the pyramids area. ``We can find no
parallel to this tomb during the Old Kingdom.''
   Giza inspector Mahmoud Hassan Afife found the new tomb in
October when he chanced upon the edge of a limestone wall. ``We
looked at the old records to see what early excavators had recorded
in this spot. There was nothing.''
   Hieroglyphics revealed the tomb owner's name, that he was a
``purification priest'' who handled religious rituals, and that he
was a palace official.
   Hawass dates it to the end of the Fifth Dynasty, about 200 years
after the death in 2528 B.C. of Pharaoh Cheops, builder of the
Great Pyramid.
   Built of limestone blocks, the 26-foot by 66-foot oblong tomb,
called a mastaba, stands over a shaft 23 feet deep that was sealed
with mud bricks after bodies were lowered into it. The mastaba had
no inner chambers.
   On one side, ancient artists carved two false doors with the
owner's name, Per-N-Ankh. The doors face a courtyard with six
limestone columns describing him and his wives Mitrt Nefer and
N-Hwy.
   The winter archaeology season was a month old when Afife found
the tomb, and vigorous excavation has continued since. On a recent
morning, a sandstorm so engulfed the dig that workers used rubber
buckets to shield their heads from the sand. Debris cascaded onto
the tomb's base faster than diggers could dig.
   Suddenly, from deep in a shaft, a workman yelled, ``gumgumah,''
Arabic for ``skull.'' As a man above slowly turned a pulley, a
reddish-gold skull creaked its way up the pit. It appears to be a
female's, in excellent condition.
   Such a find testifies to the site's value. Nearby pits have
yielded piles of pottery shards, bones and wooden pieces that
officials said might be part of a bed or other funerary furniture
to accompany the dead into the afterlife. In an adjacent tomb were
two limestone statues of wives of pharaonic officials.
   Hawass said he knew valuable leftovers would emerge from
re-excavation of the vast Western Cemetery, begun in the fifth year
of Cheops' reign. Officials and their families used the cemetery
over the centuries, building limestone and mud-brick tombs along
avenues of various sizes.
   ``Some Egyptologists thought the area wouldn't give anything
else, but they're wrong. Early excavators were in a hurry, Indiana
Jones-style. Some even used dynamite,'' he said. ``This tomb lies
at the edge of the cemetery. Earlier this century archaeologists
dumped their dirt onto these hills without checking to see if
anything interesting lay underneath.
   ``Chances are even more tombs still lie just over there.''
   Excavating leftovers is ``never a waste of time, never
busywork,'' said Amal Samuel, Giza's chief inspector, who estimates
that as many as 4,000 tombs and pits exist in the area known as the
Western Cemetery. ``When people dug in the past they only searched
for treasure. Today, we're looking for history. We never think if
we'll find something or not.''
   Last spring archaeologists clearing another part of the cemetery
found the well-preserved, gypsum-masked head of a female mummy from
about the same period, her faint smile reminiscent of the Mona
Lisa's.
   Giza Plateau has two great cemeteries: the Eastern, between the
Great Pyramid and the Sphinx, and the Western, wedged between the
pyramids of Cheops and Chephren. Generally, queens and royal
offspring are buried in the Eastern Cemetery, officials and their
families in the Western.
   The cemeteries of mastabas were arranged in parallel rows
several feet apart, with ownership planned carefully. Everybody
wanted to be buried in the pyramids area, seeking special benefits
in life after death. Over the years, as demand increased, the
symmetry went askew. Small tombs of officials and priests were
placed among the once neat rows until the area was honeycombed.
   ``We have to think of these cemeteries as a community that
surrounded the king with the same feeling as when he was alive,''
said Hawass. ``At the top of his pyramid is the pharaoh, the head
of his country. Around him lay those who would have been near him,
his family and officials. ... Those closest are in the Eastern
cemetery, just like in a palace.''
