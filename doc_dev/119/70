   Prehistoric caves in France and Spain. Rome's
Coliseum or Athens' Acropolis. Egypt's mystic pyramids. It's hard to
imagine the Mediterranean world without its most famous landmarks.
   But the area's monuments face an uncertain future as they become
caught up in a push toward lucrative mass tourism that could
endanger them.
   Indicative of the dilemma facing the region's planners is the
view of Sayed Moussa, Egypt's head of tourism promotion, who
acknowledges that history and the tourist dollar can be at odds.
   ``Antiquities officials are so jealous of their rocks,'' he said.
``We have commercial interests to consider.''
   From another point of view, antiquities officials throughout the
area decry the uproar caused when saving monuments requires
difficult decisions affecting tourists.
   ``We in Egypt are constantly reminded that our monuments belong
not only to Egypt but to the world,'' said Mut'awie Balboush, head
of antiquities for Upper Egypt, where 23 restoration teams are
working to save failing structures.
   As a region, the Mediterranean Basin is the world's biggest
tourist attraction. Host to more than a third of all international
travelers, the region's 18 countries this year alone welcomed well
over 110 million visitors, 80 percent of them in Spain, Italy and
France. If experts are correct, 450 million to 700 million annual
visitors will head to the Med by 2025.
   Tourism is not new to the Mediterranean. Egypt and the rest of
the Middle East already were ancient when history buffs Alexander
the Great, Julius Caesar and Napoleon Bonaparte took time out from
conquest to go sightseeing.
   In most countries revenue from tourism is set aside at least
partly for saving antiquities.
   But transporting tourists pours exhaust fumes into the air.
Tourists stir up dust with their footsteps, touch fragile wall
paintings with sweaty hands or mar them with graffiti. Many ascend
shaky monuments like mountain goats for just the right photo.
   Even by breathing, tourists damage some monuments.
   Throughout the region, a staggering growth in tourism has
prompted self-defense decisions by antiquities officials.
   _In Spain, visited by 50 million tourists in 1988, officials a
decade ago closed the Altamira Caves with their 12,000-year-old wall
paintings of bison and horses. The images had been damaged seriously
by a sharp rise in humidity and temperature generated by 1,000
visitors a day. In 1982, the main cave was reopened but access
limited to no more than 30 tourists a day. A replica will be opened
to all comers in 1990.
   _In France, officials faced the same dilemma and closed the
Lescaux Caves near Montignac in 1963, a year after 100,000 visitors
surged into the cave network. A facsimile opened in 1983 draws
350,000 visitors annually, and officials have developed
tourist-control techniques for other caves in the Dordogne region,
trying to preserve paintings while allowing visits.
   _In Greece, tourism authorities say visitors have caused no major
damage but archaeologists counter that 30,000 feet trampling on the
Acropolis' floor each summer's day can be doing no good. In 1978,
the Parthenon, the fifth-century architectural glory of Athens'
Golden Age, was roped off to the public after years of being worn
and chipped away by visitors' heels.
   _In Italy, support scaffolding and a ban on traffic in Rome's
historic center have been tried to reduce monument deterioration
from acid rain, car exhausts and traffic vibrations. At least 10
percent of Italy's more than 50 million annual tourists go to Rome,
crowding such monuments as the Forum and Coliseum. Trevi Fountain
soon is going behind a clear plastic screen to accommodate tourists
during a year-long restoration. Restorer Giorgio Toracca said the
only way to stop deterioration of Rome's monuments would be to put
them under glass, ``but glass cages would change the entire view.''
   _In Egypt, a glass tunnel has been inserted into a 3,300-year-old
noble's tomb that tourists and time had damaged. The World Bank
financed the Swedish experiment as a possible solution to the
emergency facing many of the tombs of the West Bank cemetery of
pharaohs, queens, royal children and courtiers. The pilot project
has remained closed to tourists, however, as antiquities officials
debate its pros and cons, including whether the fragile tomb's
allure remains the same to people peering through glass.
   Of the Mediterranean countries, Egypt, said to house more than
half of the world's standing monuments, has suffered the most with
the crunch of time: burgeoning population, subterranean water,
pollution and salt attacking historic remains.
