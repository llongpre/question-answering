   The Museum of Fine Arts has plunged to old depths
to show why some of its more than 1.5 million works of art grace
its walls and others hang on racks behind steel doors in
underground rooms.
   ``Unlocking the Hidden Museum: Riches from the Storerooms''
gives museum-goers a chance to see what they haven't seen and may
not see again.
   ``I'm always eager to demystify the museum,'' said its director,
Alan Shestack. ``It's really a look, and a rather rare look, at the
submerged part of the museum iceberg.''
   Nearly 200 pieces have been moved to the iceberg's tip _
etchings by Rembrandt, paintings by Millet, figurines from Africa
and the Orient, scrolls, fabrics, furniture, fragments of ancient
sculptures. They will be in the Gund Gallery through Sept. 9.
   Authenticity, condition, quality, size and taste can make the
difference between display and storage.
   Side by side in this special exhibit are an 18th century
painting by Jean-Honore Fragonard and a copy by a contemporary, and
an authentic 8th century Chinese figurine and a modern fake.
   Some works such as a wire cow with 3{ legs by Alexander Calder
and an Edvard Munch lithograph faded by light are too fragile for
continuous display.
   Some pieces are considered too fragmentary for public viewing.
   Two tiny feet on a base are what remain of a small statue of
King Cheops, builder of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Identification
was made from the part of the cartouche still on the base.
   One section of the exhibit reflects how tastes change in
collecting and displaying art. A huge 19th century French painting
of a nude man with two rearing horses was highly praised at the
time and bought by the museum through public subscription 100 years
ago.
   This is the first time in decades that it's been shown.
   ``We're curious to see the reaction of today's public,'' said
Erica Hirshler, curatorial assistant in the Department of Paintings.
