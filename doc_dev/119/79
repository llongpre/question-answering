   Egypt and Israel ended talks Tuesday without
reaching a compromise solution to a border dispute over Taba, a
resort area on the Aqaba Gulf claimed by both countries, officials
said.
   ``There has been no agreement on any of the subjects discussed''
during the daylong talks, said Nabil Araby, head of Egypt's
delegation to an international arbitration body in Geneva that is
to settle the dispute over the 250-acre area.
   No further talks are planned, and the Israeli delegation was
scheduled to fly home later in the day, Foreign Ministry officials
said.
   Taba, which Israel captured in its 1967 war with Egypt, was not
returned after the 1979 peace treaty. The two countries in 1986
agreed to accept a final decision on the territory by a five-member
international panel in Geneva. The result of the arbitration is
expected in September.
   The United States mediated Tuesday's talks, held at a hotel near
the Giza pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo.
   The delegations in Tuesday's negotiations were led by Yossi Ben
Aharon, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's chief aide; Ahmed
Maher, director of the Egyptian Foreign Ministry's legal
department; and Abraham Sofaer, legal adviser to the U.S. State
Department.
   It was the fourth meeting between Israel and Egypt on the issue.
A previous session, held in Washington in June, also failed to
resolve the differences.
   Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid told reporters
Tuesday that Egypt considers Taba part of its territory and hopes
to win its case in Geneva. In recent weeks, Egyptian officials,
including President Hosni Mubarak, have emphasized that their
country's sovereignty over Taba was not negotiable.
   Taba has a hotel and a tourist village, both Israeli-owned, and
Egypt has offered to buy them.
   Ben Aharon, in an Aug. 1 interview with Newsweek magazine, said
that Egypt and Israel should ``either divide the territory or make
it a neutral zone and give both sides equal rights.''
   Maher warned in an interview published Monday in the Cairo
newspaper Al-Ahram that if the Israeli side brought up such a
suggestion during Tuesday's talks ``this would signal the end of
the meeting.''
