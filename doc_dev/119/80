   Americans marveled at the towering statue of
Ramses II in an exhibit of artifacts from the mighty pharaoh's
reign, but now it appears the colossus is a retouched image of
someone else.
   New research indicates the statue was of a lesser-known pharaoh
who ruled 600 years before Ramses the Great was born. Experts say
it became Ramses because he had his artisans retouch the face and
inscribe his name.
   They also say the ancients would have been worshipping both
god-kings when they made offerings to the 24-foot statue of red
granite, which weighs 47 tons.
   No one doubted the statue was of Ramses when, in 1987, it was
pulled from its grave of mud and weeds in Memphis, the ancient
Egyptian capital.
   So positive were promoters that it was given a royal sendoff
from the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. A band played the
national anthem and boat sirens blared a 20-minute farewell salute.
   With American help, the statue was restored at Memphis State
University in Tennessee. Then it joined other Ramses artifacts
already being exhibited to complete a hugely successful nationwide
tour of U.S. museums.
   First at Memphis, then in Denver, Boston, Charlotte, N.C., and
Dallas, the colossus stole the show.
   But it isn't Ramses, says art historian Hourig Sourouzian, who
has spent years studying Ramses statues.
   ``It's Sesostris I,'' she said. ``Ramses touched it up, made it
more his style and put his name on it.
   ``Of course, when Ramses did this, the statue became Ramses. No
problem. But when the ancients were giving gifts to the colossus,
they were remembering not only Ramses, but Sesostris.''
   Sesostris I also was called ``the Great'' and died in 1926 B.C.
He was a pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom, while Ramses was of the New
Kingdom, ruling for 67 years in the 13th century B.C.
   Ms. Sourouzian said a major problem in identifying large
Egyptian statues is that ``Ramses had so many of them, and his name
was so famous, that any oversized statue naturally was assumed to
have been his.''
   Nevertheless, she said, ``something disturbed me even then''
when she first saw the colossus in the mud of Egypt.
   ``The next time I saw it was on exhibit'' in Memphis, Tenn., she
said. ``It was beautifully restored, beautifully lighted, but when
I took a deep look, I said, `It's not Ramses.'''
   Rita Freed, who led the restoration team for the Institute of
Egyptian Art and Archaeology at Memphis State, said she first heard
of the Sourouzian research a year ago.
   ``It's excellent. I think she's right,'' Ms. Freed said by
telephone from the Boston Museum, where she now works.
   ``I didn't think anything about it until we brought the statue
to Tennessee,'' she said. ``Once we had it standing, I said, `Gee,
that looks Middle Kingdom,' but I must emphasize it's Ramses. His
name is on it and we've done a wonderful job of saving a
magnificent statue.''
   It is no secret that Ramses had a fondness for gigantic statues
of himself. He erected them throughout Egypt.
   Some depict him standing, some sitting. The largest, estimated
to have stood 57 feet and weighed 1,000 tons, lies headless in his
ruined mortuary temple, the Ramesseum.
   Perhaps the most famous are the four seated statues at Abu
Simbel, southern Egypt.
   Ms. Sourouzian said she discovered Ramses the Great borrowed
colossal statues in his customary grand style. She reported finding
nine Sesostris I retreads.
   Both pharaohs had connections with Memphis, now Mit Rahina
village, 17 miles south of Cairo. Memphis contained several
colossi, including one of Ramses now in Cairo's Ramses Square.
   Another of him remains at Mit Rahina, on display where it fell.
A twin of the colossus that toured America, also a made-over
Sesostris, is in pieces at the Mit Rahina outdoor museum, Ms.
Sourouzian said.
   Discovering what is or is not the Ramses look hasn't been easy
for the Armenian-born scholr, who is a doctoral candidate at the
Sorbonne in Paris and co-author of the official catalogue of
Cairo's Egyptian Museum.
   Relics of Ramses and his family are everywhere in Egypt. He had
at least three queens and scores of lesser wives and is said to
have fathered 167 children.
   About 300 statues of Ramses have survived, and Ms. Sourouzian
has used her artist's eye to examine them: clothing, expression,
muscles, size of the legs, items in each hand, the crown.
   Statues of Sesostris' era had one look, those of Ramses' another.
   ``In earlier times, statues showed fierceness because the
pharaohs were trying to show they could smite their enemies,'' Ms.
Sourouzian said. ``Ramses, who truly was great, could have
portrayed himself on statues this way, but he preferred a faint
smile, a gentleness.
   ``A Ramses statue has a sweet expression. He has massive legs
and wears a longer kilt. He has a triangular or round face with
almost almond-shaped eyes, looking down. He wears a uraeus on his
crown,'' an ornamental cobra favored by New Kingdom pharaohs.
   The nine colossi that Ramses recycled are backed by stone slabs
and have straight mouths, rectangular faces, thick cheeks and eyes
staring straight ahead. The kilts are short.
   Despite Ms. Sourouzian's research, the identity of the colossus
scheduled to arrive home from America on Dec. 6 is not in question,
said Egyptian antiquities official Zahi Hawass.
   ``When the statue is perched on its waiting pedestal in ancient
Memhis, the name we'll put under it is Ramses II,'' he said.
