   In a Hollywood time warp, a filmmaker
is unearthing an ancient Egyptian city, built and buried not by
pharaohs but by legendary director Cecil B. DeMille.
   Archaeologists are uncovering the City of the Pharaohs, erected
for DeMille's 1923 silent film ``The Ten Commandments,'' with as
much enthusiasm as if it were a real Egyptian city.
   ``This is utterly unique,'' said Jarell Jackman, executive
director of the Santa Barbara Trust for Historical Preservation.
``It gives you a sense of time having passed - that movies are now
part of history.
   ``Some archaeologist may be uncovering Disneyland 500 years from
now.''
   The movie city, one of the largest sets in film history,
included walls 110 feet high and 75 feet wide. The entrance was
flanked by four 35-foot Pharaoh statues and 21 huge sphinxes.
   When he was finished with the movie, DeMille had the set buried
in the local sand dunes.
   A search of the northern Santa Barbara County site with
ground-penetrating radar shows that much of the original set
remains intact, said archaeologist John Parker, who compared the
readings with old charts of the movie set.
   The readings show large objects in the place where the sphinxes
should be, leading excavators to believe the statues remain intact.
   Peter Brosnan, a Los Angeles screenwriter and documentary
filmmaker, is spearheading the campaign to get financing for the
excavation project and secured a $10,000 grant from the Bank of
America.
   Brosnan dug up one of DeMille's horse heads on a 1983 trip to
the dunes about 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles, and then
started to preserve the site as a historical treasure.
   ``It's a hobby that got out of control,'' he said.
   On Monday, Brosnan proudly showed off some unearthed treasures.
   ``Take a look at this guy,'' he said. ``That's the Pharaoh.''
   Brosnan will use the excavation to help complete a documentary
video on DeMille and the buried set.
