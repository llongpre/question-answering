Americans marveled at the towering statue of Ramses II in an exhibit of 
artifacts from the mighty Pharaoh's reign, but now it appears that the colossus 
is a retouched image of someone else. 
</P>
<P>
New research indicates that the statue was of a lesser-known Pharaoh who ruled 
600 years before Ramses the Great was born. Experts say it became Ramses 
because he had his artisans retouch the face and inscribe his name. 
</P>
<P>
They also say the ancients would have been worshiping both god-kings when they 
made offerings to the 24-foot statue of red granite, which weighs 47 tons. 
</P>
<P>
No one doubted that the statue was of Ramses when, in 1987, it was pulled from 
its grave of mud and weeds in Memphis, the ancient Egyptian capital. 
</P>
<P>
So positive were promoters that it was given a royal send-off from the 
Mediterranean port of Alexandria. A band played the national anthem and boat 
sirens blared a 20-minute farewell salute. 
</P>
<P>
With American help, the statue was restored at Memphis State University in 
Tennessee. Then it joined other Ramses artifacts already being exhibited to 
complete a hugely successful nationwide tour of U.S. museums. 
</P>
<P>
First at Memphis, then in Denver, Boston, Charlotte, N.C., and Dallas, the 
colossus stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
But it isn't Ramses, says art historian Hourig Sourouzian, who has spent years 
studying Ramses statues. 
</P>
<P>
"It's Sesostris I," she said. "Ramses touched it up, made it more his style and 
put his name on it. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course, when Ramses did this, the statue became Ramses. No problem. But 
when the ancients were giving gifts to the colossus, they were remembering not 
only Ramses, but Sesostris." 
</P>
<P>
Sesostris I also was called "the Great" and died in 1926 BC He was a Pharaoh of 
the Middle Kingdom, while Ramses was of the New Kingdom, ruling for 67 years in 
the 13th Century BC. 
</P>
<P>
Sourouzian said a major problem in identifying large Egyptian statues is that 
"Ramses had so many of them, and his name was so famous, that any oversized 
statue naturally was assumed to have been his." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she said, "something disturbed me even then" when she first saw 
the colossus in the mud of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
"The next time I saw it was on exhibit" in Memphis, Tenn., she said. "It was 
beautifully restored, beautifully lighted, but when I took a deep look, I said, 
'It's not Ramses.' " 
</P>
<P>
Rita Freed, who led the restoration team for the Institute of Egyptian Art and 
Archaeology at Memphis State, said she first heard of the Sourouzian research a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It's excellent. I think she's right," Freed said by telephone from the Boston 
Museum, where she now works. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think anything about it until we brought the statue to Tennessee," 
she said. "Once we had it standing, I said, 'Gee, that looks Middle Kingdom,' 
but I must emphasize it's Ramses. His name is on it and we've done a wonderful 
job of saving a magnificent statue." 
</P>
<P>
It is no secret that Ramses had a fondness for gigantic statues of himself. He 
erected them throughout Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Some depict him standing, some sitting. The largest, estimated to have stood 57 
feet and weighed 1,000 tons, lies headless in his ruined mortuary temple, the 
Ramesseum. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most famous are the four seated statues at Abu Simbel, southern 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Sourouzian said she discovered Ramses the Great borrowed colossal statues in 
his customary grand style. She reported finding nine Sesostris I retreads. 
</P>
<P>
Both Pharaohs had connections with Memphis, now Mit Rahina village, 17 miles 
south of Cairo. Memphis contained several colossi, including one of Ramses now 
in Cairo's Ramses Square. 
</P>
<P>
Another of him remains at Mit Rahina, on display where it fell. A twin of the 
colossus that toured America, also a made-over Sesostris, is in pieces at the 
Mit Rahina outdoor museum, Sourouzian said. 
</P>
<P>
Discovering what is or is not the Ramses look hasn't been easy for the 
Armenian-born scholar, who is a doctoral candidate at the Sorbonne in Paris and 
co-author of the official catalogue of Cairo's Egyptian Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Relics of Ramses and his family are everywhere in Egypt. He had at least three 
queens and scores of lesser wives and is said to have fathered 167 children. 
</P>
<P>
About 300 statues of Ramses have survived, and Sourouzian has used her artist's 
eye to examine them: clothing, expression, muscles, size of the legs, items in 
each hand, the crown. 
</P>
<P>
Statues of Sesostris' era had one look, those of Ramses' another. 
</P>
<P>
"In earlier times, statues showed fierceness because the Pharaohs were trying 
to show they could smite their enemies," Sourouzian said. "Ramses, who truly 
was great, could have portrayed himself on statues this way, but he preferred a 
faint smile, a gentleness. 
</P>
<P>
"A Ramses statue has a sweet expression. He has massive legs and wears a longer 
kilt. He has a triangular or round face with almost almond-shaped eyes, looking 
down. He wears a uraeus on his crown," an ornamental cobra favored by New 
Kingdom Pharaohs. 
</P>
<P>
The nine colossi that Ramses recycled are backed by stone slabs and have 
straight mouths, rectangular faces, thick cheeks and eyes staring straight 
ahead. The kilts are short. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Sourouzian's research, the identity of the colossus scheduled to arrive 
home from America on Dec. 6 is not in question, said Egyptian antiquities 
official Zahi Hawass. 
</P>
<P>
"When the statue is perched on its waiting pedestal in ancient Memphis, the 
name we'll put under it is Ramses II," he said.
