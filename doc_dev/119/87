   A giant groundbreaking party, ``The Big
Dig,'' is set for the Great American Pyramid sports and
entertainment arena, which is being touted as a prime tourist
attraction when it opens in 1991.
   ``It's the first pyramid of consequence to be built in 5,000
years and it just happens to have an arena in it,'' said Sidney
Shlenker, who helped develop Houston's Astrodome in the 1960s and is
working on the pyramid.
   Groundbreaking is scheduled for Friday night, complete with
parades, street parties and fireworks. It will feature a
75-foot-long arrangement of lights in the shape of a shovel, and a
light and laser display showing the size of the future pyramid.
   That display will be formed by stringing lights from a
321-foot-tall industrial crane at the center of the pyramid site,
said Henry Turley Jr., a Memphis real estate developer helping
organize the groundbreaking, called ``The Big Dig.''
   With music traditional to Memphis playing over loudspeakers along
the downtown riverfront, a police helicopter will deliver the
75-foot ``shovel'' to signal the beginning of a fireworks display,
Turley said.
   Comedian Dan Aykroyd will perform at the Mud Island party with
other members of the Blues Brother review, a rock 'n' roll band
featured in a movie by the same name starring Aykroyd and the late
John Belushi.
   Local government is paying for the $56 million arena. Shlenker
has an agreement to operate it, take the lion's share of any profits
and pay the money back over 25 years.
   He also has a contract giving him control of a nearby $63 million
tourist park the city built in 1983 on a 3-mile-long Mississippi
River sandbar called Mud Island.
   Shlenker, a former owner of the Denver Nuggets of the National
Basketball Association, runs four Memphis corporations, which he
groups under the name of The Pyramid Companies. He and his principal
financial partner, international businessman John Tigrett Sr.,
expect to spend some $80 million developing the pyramid-park project.
   The pyramid began with plans four years ago to provide a new
basketball arena for Memphis State University. The idea grew of
building a pyramid-shaped arena to play on Memphis' link to its
namesake, the ancient capital of Egypt which stood beside the Nile.
