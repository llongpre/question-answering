   NAZLETT EL-SAMMAN, Egypt (AP) _ Sewer workers have discovered
remains of a temple that Pharaoh Cheops built for his funeral 4,600
years ago, and Egyptologists are hoping it will tell them more
about the mysterious pharaoh of the Great Pyramid.
   The discovery this month of Cheop's Valley Temple confirms
theories about the layout of Giza Plateau for the 70-year period in
which the pharaoh, his son and grandson built their three pyramids
and monuments nearby.
   Nazlett el-Samman lies at the foot of the plateau, facing the
Sphinx, and sewage from the village often is mentioned as a cause
of the Sphinx's dangerous deterioration. A U.S.-financed sewage
project began last year, and Egyptologists were assigned to monitor
construction because of the probability of finding antiquities.
   They were on hand in early March as diggers began uncovering
mammoth granite and limestone blocks, a flint knife, Roman brick
walls and other relics.
   By mid-March, more remains were turning up, and finally the main
prize _ a 59-foot-long row of basalt rocks. The experts identified
it as the floor for Cheops' Valley Temple.
   Because basalt is difficult to carve and expensive, the stone
was reserved for royal use, often as flooring for sacred places.
   Although his pyramid was the largest ever built, Cheops left few
other glimpses of his life or his 23-year reign, which ended in
2528 B.C.
   ``With what we're finding now, we can piece together Cheops'
history and reconstruct how this part of the pyramids area would
have looked,'' said Zahi Hawass of the Egyptian Antiquities
Organization.
   The newly found ruins lie 13 feet below street level, partially
covered with sewage.
   Getting to them will not be easy. Diggers already are excavating
two Roman-era sites in a Nazlett el-Samman alley only a foot from
village houses. Archaeologists have to contend with children at
play, donkeys and angry villagers worried that antiquities
officials might invoke their legal authority to force them from
their houses.
   Cheops' Valley Temple is proving an even greater challenge.
Engineers for the sewer project are pumping water from the drainage
ditch where the basalt flooring was found.
   The Giza Pyramids and the structures around them are thought by
some Egyptologists to be part of an elaborate blueprint for the
dead, precisely planned and executed. But their exact roles in the
death and resurrection of the pharaohs are debated.
   Burial was an elaborate ritual to ensure that neither the
pharaoh nor Egypt would ever die.
   The journey to eternity began in the Valley Temple, where the
pharaoh's body was taken for ritual purification, perhaps
embalming. For the final rituals, the body was carried up the long
causeway to a mortuary temple next to the pyramid.
   Early travelers' descriptions of the pyramids area had given
modern egyptogists a good idea where Cheops' temple should be found.
   In the fifth century B.C., the Greek Herodotus wrote that he saw
Cheops' causeway, covered and decorated with carved animal scenes.
The German scholar Karl Richard Lepsius said only traces remained
of the ruined causeway by the early 1840s.
