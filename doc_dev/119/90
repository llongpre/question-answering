   Patched in white limestone bandages,
the Sphinx had a head-to-toe checkup Thursday by antiquities
officials, and the prognosis was mixed.
   ``The Sphinx is in no danger of collapsing,'' Minister of
Culture Farouk Hosni said after a 45-minute detailed examination of
the monument with the face of a pharaoh and the body of a lion.
   He admitted its problems are severe, however, and said Egypt is
willing to listen to any suggestions on how to solve them.
   ``The Sphinx belongs to Egypt, but even if someone on the moon
has a suggestion that would help us, we will listen,'' he said.
   Sayed Tawfik, chairman of the Egyptian Antiquities Organization,
predicted it would take at least a year before a team of
international and local experts can agree on a permanent solution
to the 4,600-year-old monument's lingering ills.
   The tour by Hosni, Tawfik and others was to counter local press
reports that a year-long emergency restoration effort has failed to
stop deterioration.
   ``The talk that the restoration work is bad was made only to
cause a crisis,'' Hosni said. ``These are personal rivalries, and I
don't want them to interfere with scientific work.''
   Officials have known for years that the Sphinx, fashioned from
layers of limestone piled on a natural knoll, was in trouble. In
February 1988, a chunk of rock tumbled from its right shoulder, and
the patchup began.
   Restorers encased a critically weak portion of the endangered
shoulder behind a limestone retaining wall. Limestone blocks have
been placed alongside the body as braces.
   It's the clash of the bright white limestone against ancient
brown stone that causes visitors to say the Sphinx just doesn't
look the same. Hosni said he's determined to find a balance between
the subtle beauty the ancients built into the sculpture with the
need to save it by introducing modern touches.
   UNESCO, the United Nations' education and scientific agency, has
given $100,000 for equipment to monitor harmful natural and
man-made phenomena like pollution and wind. The antiquities
organization's Tawfik said discussions for technical help are under
with with the Getty Conservation Institute of Marina Del Ray,
Calif., and the Smithsonian Institution.
   ``This rock has been sick ever since it was hewn. There's been
repair and restoration work for thousands of years,'' Hosni said.
``Under the pharaohs, under the Romans, under subsequent reigns,
we've been trying to restore this rock because it is not firm. It
has been affected by erosion, by atmosphere, climate or by
subterranean waters.''
   Hosni said antiquities officials are trying to protect the relic
as its builders did, without using cement.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``Nothing we have done cannot be
reversed.''
   Tawfik noted that the Sphinx's Arabic name is Abu el-Hawl,
``Father of Terror,'' and said experts remain terrified.
   ``Scholars are afraid to do anything to harm the wonderful
beast,'' he said. ``Any international expert is at once faced with
the idea he may cause danger to one of the world's most famous
monuments.''
   Tawfik described the work done so far as patchwork.
   Once the conclusions are in, he said, ``We'll take the greatest
step ever for the Sphinx, to restore it as a whole. But it will
require restoration forever. Doctors will have to feed him what he
needs now and then.''
   Omar el-Arini, the U.S. Embassy's science officer, said the
Sphinx must be considered 50 million years old.
   ``That's how old the rocks are that made the Sphinx,'' he said.
``The Sphinx is living rock, and it's suffering from old age.''
   Tourists will get used to its new look, el-Arini said. ``The
Sphinx has had many looks,'' he said. ``It had one look when it was
built. A thousand years later it had another. Most of the time it
was buried in sand.
   ``Another generation of tourists won't remember how the Sphinx
looked to those who came before.''
   The important thing, he said, is to keep it standing. Or rather
sitting.
