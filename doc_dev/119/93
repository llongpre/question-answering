Archeological exploration in Iraq has picked up since the cease-fire in the 
Iran-Iraq war, yielding rich finds from the era 2,000 years ago when the 
powerful Assyrian empire dominated the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The upsurge comes as President Saddam Hussein's government seeks to bolster 
Iraq's self-image through excavation and rebuilding at sites such as Babylon 
that symbolize the nation's historical greatness. 
</P>
<P>
"By appealing to history, Saddam encourages Iraqis to view themselves as the 
heirs of a great civilization that flowered in ancient Iraq while the 
surrounding world was lingering in prehistory," a Western diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq includes much of the "fertile crescent" of ancient Mesopotamia, where 
early rulers developed efficient armies and sophisticated city administrations 
that rivaled the Pharaohs' Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Importance Illustrated 
</P>
<P>
Ruined temples and palaces adorned with colossal stone sculptures, archives of 
inscribed clay tablets, delicate gold work and ivory carvings illustrate the 
importance of early Iraqi civilization. 
</P>
<P>
To help build morale during the recent eight-year war with Persian Iran, the 
Iraqi government recalled Assyrian and Babylonian victories in the first 
millennium BC against the ancient Persians, portrayed as unscrupulous 
aggressors. 
</P>
<P>
Although the war was halted last August by a United Nations-mediated 
cease-fire, history is still being promoted, underscoring Hussein's drive to 
boost Iraq's role in the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Iraqi teams, archeologists from the United States, Britain, 
Poland, West Germany, the Netherlands and Japan were digging in the country 
earlier this year. Most will resume work in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Spectacular' Finds 
</P>
<P>
Hussein also agreed in recent talks with American businessmen in Baghdad, 
Iraq's capital, that a selection of ancient Iraqi treasures will tour the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear there's more than scholarship involved in all this promotion of 
archeology . . . but the recent finds have been spectacular," said a Western 
archeologist, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
New excavations at three sites in the Assyrian heartland of northern Iraq have 
unearthed a gold-filled royal tomb dating from the 8th Century BC, as well as 
imposing sculpture and architectural remains. 
</P>
<P>
At Nimrud, the Assyrian military capital 250 miles north of Baghdad, Iraqi 
archeologists found a stone chamber where two women were buried along with more 
than 55 pounds of gold jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
Muzahem Mahmoud, the excavation director, said it was "the richest Assyrian 
burial known." 
</P>
<P>
An inscription on stone in the tomb in wedge-shaped cuneiform writing 
identified the women as Yabaya and Taliya, possibly the daughter and 
granddaughter of King Sargon, who ruled an empire that stretched from the 
Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
The inscription also laid a curse on anyone who opened the burial chamber: "If 
anyone lays his hands on my tomb or opens my grave, I pray to the gods of the 
netherworld that his soul should roam in the scorching sun after death. . . . 
Let the ghost of insomnia take hold of him forever and ever." 
</P>
<P>
The gold jewelry included diadems, necklaces, belts, bracelets and anklets and 
50 pairs of earrings, as well as a bronze mirror with an enamel handle 
encrusted in precious stones. 
</P>
<P>
At Nineveh, the Assyrians' administrative capital, another Iraqi team unearthed 
a stone door carved with four lions that was part of the city's fortifications 
in its last days. 
</P>
<P>
They also found arrowheads and skeletons of Assyrian warriors who may have died 
during a siege by the Babylonians and Medes. Nineveh fell in 612 BC after 
holding out for two months and was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the ruins, the archeologists found remnants of an irrigation system 
built by King Sennacherib a century earlier to increase vegetation around the 
city, as well as a stone terrace where he constructed what the tablets call "a 
palace without rival." 
</P>
<P>
Farther north near the border with Syria, British archeologists tentatively 
identified a 100-foot-high mound as the remains of ancient Tillule, another 
important military and religious center. 
</P>
<P>
The team found the base of a ziggurat, a temple shaped like a stepped pyramid, 
that may have belonged to a shrine for the Assyrian weather god, Adad. 
</P>
<P>
They also located sections of two roads believed to be part of highways linking 
Nineveh with Syria and Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything here tells us that this is a major settlement," said excavation 
director Warwick Ball of the British Museum. "It's only a matter of time before 
we find the clues to tell us that Tel Al-Hawa is the modern name of Tillule." 
</P>
<P>
He said the Assyrians used Tillule as a center for massing troops before 
launching campaigns against Syria, Palestine and Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
At Babylon, whose kings succeeded the Assyrians as rulers of Mesopotamia, a 
major project is under way to excavate and restore the whole nine-square-mile 
area of the ancient city. 
</P>
<P>
The multimillion-dollar restoration will include the palace of King 
Nebuchadnezzar, the 6th-Century BC king who built the legendary Hanging Gardens 
of Babylon, one of the Seven Wonders of the World. 
</P>
<P>
The city quickly grew into Mesopotamia's largest population center with about 1 
million residents. But Babylonian supremacy lasted less than a century before 
the city was overrun by King Cyrus of Persia in 539 BC.
