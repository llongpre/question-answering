   The discovery of five ancient statues has
transformed a tranquil courtyard of Luxor Temple into an
archaeologist's dream.
   ``We want to discover who buried the statues, why and when,''
Mohammed Saghir, the Luxor area's director of antiquities, said as
diggers' picks and shovels turn the silty earth in search of more
statues.
   Since the Jan. 22 discovery of the well-preserved statues,
experts have debated whether more lie near them beside towering
columns on the north side of the courtyard of Pharaoh Amenophis III,
who ruled Egypt in 1391-1353 B.C.
   The courtyard, just over 57 yards long by 50{ yards wide, is
considered the glory of Luxor Temple, a fabled remain altered and
reworked by many of ancient Egypt's best-known rulers.
   On a recent Sunday, four of the statues, covered in padded vinyl
and tied so only their toes peeked out, sat in their burial pit.
Workers dug around them as small boys carted basketfuls of dirt to
mounds near an outer temple wall on which Ramses II, in a chariot,
smites the ill-fated enemies of Egypt.
   Each digger hopes to be the next el-Rayees Farouk, chief of
temple workers, who was credited with finding the edge of a buried
granite statue base that had shielded the figures from generations
of footsteps.
   Farouk, in a brown galabeya, or robe, his head swathed in the
traditional scarf of southern Egypt, shouted orders to his men as
they excavated.
   They've found no additional large statues, but Saghir said the
dig had turned up a small bronze of the god Osiris, lord of the
underworld; part of a stela or commemorative plaque; copper tools,
and other small artifacts.
   Some light has been shed on mysteries of the discovery, one of a
number of group burials by ancient Egyptians.
   ``We know this burial was not accidental,'' Saghir said. ``These
statues were placed lovingly in the earth, their sides turned toward
the west. Not only did the ancients protect the statues by putting a
base over them, but they took the care to seal the pit with a layer
of gypsum and limestone chips. They wanted to save them for
eternity.''
   The base, a granite slab with two niches carved in it, apparently
once held two of the statues found in January. The general, and
later pharaoh, Haremhab, knelt in a rounded-off rectangle with
offerings before a seated creator god, Atum, that fit in a
rectangular niche, according to measurements.
   A third statue found in January is of the goddess Hathor, patron
of beauty and womanhood, and the fourth is a minor goddess, Yunet.
   Originally, the base lay on the ground inside the temple. At some
time, for reasons unknown, the ancients decided to bury the statues.
They put them in a hole, covered it with dirt, gypsum and stone,
then put the base on top and covered it with dirt _ much like the
layers in a sandwich.
   Saghir and others think the base may have provided protection, or
may have had some magical significance. It only actually covers a
quartzite statue of Amenophis III, which Saghir said was the most
important find.
   The statue depicts Amenophis III standing on a sledge to
demonstrate his divinity. Tomb paintings and small wooden statues
exist showing him in such a pose, but the stone statue standing more
than eight feet tall is unique.
   Over 34 centuries Amenophis III has remained among ancient
Egypt's most fascinating personalities. Early in his reign he
claimed to have killed 102 fierce lions. He brags in heiroglyphs on
the new statue that he controls land from Nubia, ranging from
southern Egypt through what is now northern Sudan, to the Euphrates
River to the east to the Taurus Mountains in southern Turkey. In
later life, Amenophis III preferred luxury to prowess. A patron of
the arts, he demanded magnificent monuments and the finest works
craftsmen could produce.
   The five statues show the masters' touch, and conservation
experts from Cairo will have the job of ensuring their safety in the
modern world. They have been moved from the courtyard to a special
storage area at Luxor.
   Saghir said he's just beginning to have the time to think about
what's been found. ``Finding something by surprise and discovering
it in a regular excavation give different feelings,'' he said.
   ``The first night after these statues were found I couldn't
sleep. I went to Luxor Temple at 11 p.m. and walked in the
moonlight. I went home. At 2 a.m. I went again to the Temple. I was
trying to decide what to do next. I was so afraid something would
happen to them. I knew at first sight we had a cache.''
   The statues may have been put in hiding for safekeeping during
the Assyrian invasion, he said. That west Asian empire conquered
Egypt in 671 B.C., and for years its soldiers ransacked and
plundered monuments throughout the country.
   However, Egypt suffered ups and downs as early as 100 years after
Amenophis built Luxor Temple, when the pharaohs began to decline
after the 66-year reign of Ramses II, and that may account for the
statues' burial.
   In Cairo, Rainer Stadelmann, director of the German
Archaeological Institute and one of the profession's most respected
scholars, said he believes the order in which the statues were
buried gives history a hint.
   ``The best choice'' for the time of burial would have been during
the reign of Ramses II, who expanded and redesigned Luxor Temple, he
said. ``Perhaps they bothered Ramses in some way or interfered with
his processions.''
   He reasons that the statues were grouped as they are for a reason.
   ``To me they represent the west, the setting sun,'' Stadelmann
said. ``If this is true, then we can expect in the opposite
courtyard to find another grouping, this time representing the east,
the rising sun.''
   He characterized his ideas as fantasies because the discovery is
so new, but said he expects that the statues lined the sides of the
festival courtyard in ancient times to produce a processional
journey for the sun god.
   ``We have these processions painted on walls, but in this case it
could have been done with statues. To the ancients it wouldn't have
mattered if the pharaoh were dead or if the statues later were
buried...
   ``The journey would continue.''
