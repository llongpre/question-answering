   With the flick of a tail and the
wave of a claw, two huge lobsters were freed Monday in the Atlantic
Ocean, safe from seafood lovers after a roundabout landlubbers tour
of the Northeast.
   ``Shirley,'' a 25-pound male lobster, and ``Bob,'' his 19}-pound
companion, went down into the sea off foggy Portland Head Light.
   They had apparently already been hearing the call of the wild
and snacked on seafood in the tank where they were being kept
before their release.
   ``They were real frisky,'' Marine Patrol Officer Donald K.
Lockhart Jr. said. ``They put a quahog (a large clam) in there and
the big one just snapped it up like it was butter. They left a crab
in there overnight and it was gone this morning.''
   The two behemoths almost became a very expensive Easter dinner
in Pennsylvania before an unlikely combination of animal rights
activists, seafood dealers and state officials came to the rescue.
   A 30-minute boat ride from Portland marked a storybook ending to
the rescue mission.
   Dana Neuts, retail manager of Harbor Fish Market in Portland,
and Kevin Hill, owner of Main Line Seafood Co. in the Philadelphia
suburb of Ardmore, had the honor of putting the monster crustaceans
into the water.
   Neuts grabbed Shirley's baseball mitt-sized claws and Hill took
the tail, and the two gently lowered the lobster over the side of
the 35-foot Maine Marine Patrol boat. Bob went into the same
protected cove moments later.
   The two men who make their living from selling seafood agreed it
seemed strange to be returning it to the sea, but in the case of
Shirley and Bob they had no complaints.
   ``It feels great. It really does,'' Neuts said. ``I like the
idea of the whole thing.''
   ``These are well-traveled lobsters,'' Hill said. With his wife,
Vickie, he accompanied the two lobsters on their flight Monday from
Philadelphia to Portland.
   ``We shouldn't be catching lobsters this size. Maine is the only
state that's doing anything to protect them, and that's why we're
here,'' Hill said.
   Maine law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five
inches, covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds. It is the
only state with a legal limit on the maximum size of lobsters.
   Shirley, whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old,
and the smaller companion were rescued from a Philadelphia man who
wanted to serve them for Easter dinner.
   Col. Robert Fogg, chief of the Bureau of Marine Patrol of the
state Department of Marine Resources, said the lobsters had
apparently gotten snagged in the nets of a dragger and were landed
in Rhode Island.
   The lobsters had been trucked from Long Island, N.Y., to Hill's
store, where retired carpenter Art Miller bought them for $287.
   After animal rights activists took up the lobsters' cause, Hill
persuaded Miller to take 45 pounds of smaller lobsters instead.
Pity Not Cruelty Inc., an animal rights group, arranged to turn the
creatures loose and assumed the $40 flight cost.
