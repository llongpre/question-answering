   It was a good year for the company that
makes paper for U.S. currency, and that means more folding money for
its workers.
   Crane &amp; Co. officials said Tuesday it would contribute a record
$4.5 million to a profit-sharing plan for 1,100 employees at three
plants in western Massachusetts. The payments amount to between 16
percent and 20 percent of the annual salaries of workers, who make
$6 to $12 an hour, officials said.
   Last year, the company distributed $3.2 million to employees.
   Company officials declined to reveal how much of their total
sales of $119.8 million involved paper used in currency, and aside
from the United States, they would not identify the countries that
use their paper.
   Sales were up for all products made by Crane, such as stationery
and specialty papers for drafting, said personnel director James D.
Manning.
   Manning did say Crane won a new three-year contract to produce
paper for U.S. bills in early 1988. The company first began making
the paper for this country's legal tender in 1879.

   If the latest exhibit at the Steinhart
Aquarium looks like a fish out of water, that's exactly what it is _
a frozen shark.
   The great white shark _ 1,500 pounds and 13{ feet long _ was
caught off the Golden Gate bridge last fall by fisherman Michael
McHenry.
   ``He must have used a huge hook,'' aquarium director John
McCosker said Tuesday. ``It's in there somewhere.''
   McCosker said great white sharks have rarely been kept alive in
captivity for more than a few hours because they have to swim to
breathe.
   But he's confident that someday the aquarium's tanks will contain
a live shark. Until then, the Steinhart's new exhibit is a good _
and safe _ way to get a close look at one.

   Clyde, an 80-year-old Maine lobster, is a long
way from his stomping grounds but he should feel right at home in
this landlocked state. After all, he's been named an honorary
citizen of Nebraska.
   But the 17-pound crustacean will be moving on to saltier waters,
or worse, fall victim to the lobster pot if his new owner cannot
raise $6,000 to buy an aquarium to keep him at Omaha's Henry Doorly
Zoo.
   ``I don't want him being sold. I don't want him being eaten,''
said Louise Douglas, who won Clyde through a grocery store drawing.
``If he made it more than 80 years, I don't want him killed.''
   Hinky Dinky store manager Tim Myers said patrons ooooed and
ahhhed at the mighty lobster when it was lowered into the tank
before the drawing.
   Myers agreed to donate the lobster to the zoo and instead give
her 10 smaller lobster tails, but Mrs. Douglas said the zoo will
only accept Clyde on a permanent basis if a chilled saltwater tank
is purchased to house him.
   Otherwise he'll be sent to the New York Aquarium, said Randy
Wisthoff, associate director of the zoo. He said the lobsters on
display at the zoo are Caribbean creatures and live in warmer waters
than Maine lobsters.
   Meanwhile, Clyde is being stored at the zoo in a big cooler.
