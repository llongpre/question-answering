   They came from all over to try the Scream
Machine, the Z Force, and the Georgia Cyclone. The Mind Bender got
a pass, because as roller coasters go, it's no big thing.
   The Cyclone was getting most of the attention from about 450
members of the American Coaster Enthusiasts at their annual outing.
   ``Wood is a living, organic thing. Here, standing in the middle
of this one, it's like being in the heart of a great beast,'' said
Randy Geisler of St. Paul, Minn., president of the 3,500-member
organization.
   The enthusiasts were out in the fog Saturday night testing the
Cyclone, a new-style, old-fashioned wooden roller coaster at Six
Flags Over Georgia.
   ``It's absolutely dynamite,'' said David Schini of Naples, Fla.,
who with his wife, Elizabeth, had ``driven 11 hours to ride this
thing.''
   ``This one, it takes all the old-fashioned thrills and adds the
modern technology,'' Schini said.
   The Georgia Cyclone combines the speed of a big, wooden roller
coaster with the twisting, banked turns of a steel coaster.
   ``To me, one of the most important things is the visual effect
of it _ white scaffolding, deep dips. The coaster will lift you off
your seat _ coaster riders call it `air time,''' said Glenn Allen
of Ocala, Fla.
   The 1 minute, 48 second, ride reaches a top speed of 50 mph.
   ``It's one of the great things about wooden roller coasters.
About all the members like the wooden roller coasters better,''
Allen said.

   A firefighter, trained to rescue people
from burning buildings, had to tap new talents to ``rescue'' a
19-pound lobster from a grocery store tank.
   The monster lobster ended up on display in an Edmond grocery
store after a well-meaning friend shipped it to Max Raydon,
president of the Homeland grocery store chain in Oklahoma.
   ``We went through kind of a mess trying to figure out what to do
with it,'' said Scott Stelfox, assistant manager of the chain's
Edmond store.
   The lobster, estimated to be 100 years old, was finally placed
in the store's lobster tank. ``We didn't have much choice,'' even
though the tank wasn't designed to hold even one 19-pound lobster,
Stelfox said.
   Most of the lobsters sold to shoppers are about 1{ pounds.
   Firefighter Cody Barger heard about the lobster from his wife,
who saw it in the tank while shopping.
   Barger, a diver with an interest in marine animals, began
looking for a home for lobster. Neither the Oklahoma City Zoo nor
the Tulsa zoo had a place for it. Finally, the staff at Florida's
Sea World agreed to adopt him.
   ``They just opened a lobster display and they only have a
7-pound lobster in it,'' Barger said.
   The lobster was shipped to its new home Friday.
   Despite his size, the Oklahoma lobster, who actually came from
Boston, isn't nearly big enough to make the record books. The
largest known lobster lives in a museum in Maine. It weighs 58
pounds and is estimated to be 300 years old.
