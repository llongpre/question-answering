   Maine lobstermen are laying three times as
much bait and scientists have even tried raising lobster larvae in
test tanks, but the harvest of the tasty crustaceans hasn't
increased in 20 years.
   Marine biologists from the University of Maine and Bigelow
Laboratory in West Boothbay are conducting a 10-day research cruise
next month, and hope their detailed probe of breeding grounds will
help explain the inability of lobstermen to increase the annual
catch.
   The lobstermen, some of whom have volunteered to assist
biologists as they map the ocean floor, are hoping the investigation
will lead to bigger catches.
   Lobster production is vital to Maine's economy, not least because
of its contribution to tourism.
   ``We want to make sure that resource is around a thousand years
from now. It's so much a part of our income, our history and our
art, it's just incredibly important to us,'' said Dave Dow, director
of the Lobster Institute, a trade organization affiliated with the
University of Maine.
   The harvest of the ``bugs,'' as they are affectionately called by
lobstermen, has remained at about 21 million pounds per year during
the past two decades, despite legal, scientific, and practical
measures to increase it.
   Biologists at the Cutler Marine Hatchery have coaxed thousands of
lobster eggs to grow at a quickened rate in warm-water tanks and
then stocked coastal waters with the immature larvae.
   State legislators have gradually increased the minimum size
limit, hoping more females would mature and reproduce.
   And lobstermen have worked harder; they haul about triple the
number of traps they put out 20 years ago. But the lobsters have
refused to take the extra bait, according to the Lobster Institute.
   In next month's cruise, five scientists aboard the research
vessel Argo Maine will survey four major lobstering sites in the
Gulf of Maine.
   They will use sonar to determine the sea bottom's
characteristics; search for and count larval lobsters; scuba dive to
survey lobster densities, shelter sizes and abundance of predators;
and sample ocean bottom sediment for invertebrates.
   The investigation could affect where lobstermen set their traps,
as well as plans to stock coastal waters, said Dave Cousins, a
lobsterman from South Thomaston, 75 miles northeast of Portland.
   University of Maine marine biologist Robert Steneck, one of the
project leaders, has sought for eight years to explain the static
harvest.
   ``His theory operates on the premise that something in nature
limits our productivity out there,'' Dow said.
   The limiting factor could be the amount of suitable habitat the
lobsters can live in, the amount of food available for the
creatures, or the ecological balance of lobsters and their
predators, Dow said.
   The lobsters go through three planktonic, or swimming stages,
before they are ready to settle on the sea bottom, and the suitable
bottom habitat is distributed in patches along the shoreline.
   ``If Mother Nature, because of the way she works the tides and
currents, doesn't allow delivery to the appropriate habitats, that's
going to be important for the overall production,'' Dow said.
   The public's appetite for lobster is matched by the appetites of
various marine creatures, he said.
   ``There's a million lobster-seeking missiles waiting for those
little fellows to hit the bottom ... these little fellows are
subject to thousands of attacks a day.''
   Large codfish have been found to contain up to a dozen lobsters
when they are cut open, Dow said.
