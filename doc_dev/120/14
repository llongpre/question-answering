   When it comes to license plates, Maine has always kept a fairly low profile. 
No dramatics like New Hampshire ("Live Free or Die"); no wishful thinking like New Jersey ("The Garden State"). 
Just a simple black and white plate with the words "Maine" and "Vacationland." 

   Last year, however, the state enacted a law that -- beginning July 1 -- will force drivers to trade in the simple for the sublime: a new license plate in blue and white trim that features a bright red lobster. 

   And now, some normally reserved Mainers -- including lots of school children -- are boiling. 

   It seems that quite a few residents are having second thoughts about riding around with a lobster on their tail. 
"I am receiving letters from people all over the state," says Rep. Mary McBride, who is sponsoring a bill to give drivers a choice of license plates. 
"I didn't realize this was going to be such an emotional issue." 

   The children, however, are angry for the opposite reason: It was their idea to put lobsters on licenses in the first place. 
What began as a civics project in 1983 in a fourth-grade class in Kennebunk ended up as a statewide campaign to add a little flavor to Maine's auto tags. 
With children crowding their chamber, legislators approved the change by a vote of 156-5. 

   Revising the law now would be a blow to the students, says Peter Towne, the teacher who started the whole thing. 
"The governor came down and signed the bill, and all the kids said, 'Boy, this is going to be on Dad's plate,'" he says. 
"The kids are a little upset." 

   Not surprisingly, the children are getting moral support from the state's lobstermen, who oppose any plans to give drivers a choice of plates, says Edward A. Blackmore, president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association. 
"If you don't like it, don't look at it," he says. 

   Those on the other side of the fence include animal-rights activists and vegetarians -- who note that lobsters are red only after they've been cooked -- and residents who would like to see license plates with a pine tree, a lighthouse, a potato, or even marine worms (a big industry in Maine). 
Anything but a lobster. 

   Portland housewife Gayle Drummond, for example, says she is outraged by the legislature's capitulation to the students. 

   "You want to cheer kids on so they grow and learn," she says. 
"But this is like a cheap souvenir of Maine . . . . 
It's more like Atlantic City than Maine."
