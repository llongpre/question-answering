   A live Maine lobster bought for a
Valentine's Day dinner got a reprieve from a boiling pot when a wife
told her husband she preferred the sea crustacean as a pet instead
of as a main course.
   Suzanne Brown had planned to serve the lobster to her husband,
Dave, to crown a romantic, home-cooked dinner.
   She presented her husband with the $14 catch wrapped in
newspaper, a valentine attached. But when it came time to drop it in
the boiling water, Suzanne proved to be softer skinned than her
hard-shelled prey.
   ``I kinda fell in love with a lobster,'' said Mrs. Brown. ``I
decided I wanted to keep him for a pet.''
   The 1\-pound lobster, dubbed Oscar, stayed alive in the Brown's
refrigerator in a damp towel while Suzanne called around for help in
setting up a lobster tank.
   The Seattle Aquarium couldn't help her, nor could the University
of Washington. She finally went back to seafood market, where she
learned that the smallest commercial tanks go for $1,200.
   So Gary Gerontis of Johnny's Seaford took the lobster back and
promised to fly it back to Gloucester, Maine, so that the wholesaler
can throw it back into the Atlantic.
   ``He could live another 50 years, or he could get caught next
week,'' said Harold Frisk, sales manager for the wholesaler,
International Lobster.

   For $10 you can buy a historic home
from the Springfield Preservation and Restoration group. And the
group will give you $1,000.
   All you have to do is move. The house, that is.
   The six homes for sale are on property purchased by University
Hospital and must be moved by April. The catch is that they may not
be worth the cost of moving them, estimated at $10,000 to $30,000
each.
   The houses, built between 1910 and 1920, are in disrepair and
have become havens for vagrants, making the area dangerous for
hospital employees, said Judy Skelton, a hospital spokeswoman.
   ``We want to work with SPAR to preserve the houses for historical
purposes, but a lot of our employees have to walk past there from
the parking lot and it's just not safe,'' she said.
   University Hospital turned the homes over to the preservation
group, which is selling them for $10 each and then funneling $1,000
from the hospital as an incentive to buyers.
