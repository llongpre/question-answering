   Mimi, the 17{-pound lobster described as the
Elizabeth Taylor of crustaceans, died of natural causes days after
being shipped to her new home - at a restaurant. She was 20 to 100
years old, officials said.
   Mimi, captured last week off the Maine coast and flown to
Detroit, died Sunday in the tank at Carl's Chop House, which paid
$320 for the huge lobster.
   ``She had quit moving. I picked her up. She still didn't move,''
said Barry Hornecker, executive chef at Carl's.
   So he chilled and poached Mimi and began making plans for a
feast.
   ``Mimi was like Elizabeth Taylor. ... She was always
beautiful,'' said Jim Richards, owner of the Long Wharf Lobster
Co., which flew the lobster to Detroit.
   Although Mimi was a lot bigger than the 1{-pound average
lobster, she wasn't the biggest. Earlier this year, Florida's Sea
World adopted a 19-pound lobster, whose age was estimated at 100
years, from a grocery store in Oklahoma.
   The largest known lobster lives in a museum in Maine. It weighs
58 pounds and is estimated to be 300 years old.
