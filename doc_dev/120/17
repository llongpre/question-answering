   Every year, a few lobstermen find a freak
when they haul in their traps - a lobster with a shell as blue as
the Maine sky.
   And they'll often call Sam Chapman, the godfather of blue
lobsters in Maine. He has about 400, ranging in hue from powder
blue to electric cobalt blue to ``a blue so dark it's almost
black.''
   Most lobsters plucked from the Atlantic's icy waters are a
mottled mixture of green, red and brown. They turn bright red when
they're cooked.
   Blue lobsters are genetic mutations in which the crustacean's
blue gene is dominant. About one in every 3 million or 4 million
lobsters caught along the Maine coast is blue, Chapman said.
   ``Lobsters have genes for the production of red, yellow and
blue,'' said Chapman, an aquaculture specialist at the University
of Maine's Darling Marine Center. ``If the gene for red and the
gene for yellow aren't functioning, you get a blue lobster.''
   The disorder also produces lobsters with yellow shells, red
shells and even yellow with black spots, known as calico lobsters.
   Chapman has been raising blue lobsters since 1982 in a study to
determine if Maine's fishing grounds can be restocked with lobsters
raised in hatcheries.
   Hatcheries have operated in Maine off and on for decades. But
Chapman said no one has ever proved that restocking coastal waters
increases the number of lobsters in the ocean.
   Part of the problem is that hatchery-raised lobsters are
released when they're the size of a thumbnail and hard to tag for
later identification.
   So with the blue lobster, Chapman said, ``what you have is
essentially a colored tag.''
   ``You can do all of the plot sampling and research that you
want, but the proof of the pudding in this whole program is how
many blue lobsters show up in traps'' over the next five years, he
said.
   It took from 1982 - when he collected Amanda and Vinnie, the
first two blues he bred - until the summer of 1988 to raise enough
blue lobsters to get started.
   In June and July 1988, Chapman and another University of Maine
researcher released 5,600 blue lobsters off Boothbay Harbor. In
1989, they sampled the area and found two blues. But sampling this
past summer turned up none.
   Chapman released 1,100 blue lobsters in Pemaquid Harbor this
past summer and 1,500 in Cutler Harbor.
   He thinks the latest restocking will be easier to monitor
because Pemaquid and Cutler are sheltered harbors. ``My feeling is
somewhere between three and four years after you let them go,
they'll start showing up in traps,'' Chapman said.
   He also has kept about 375 blue lobsters for behavior testing.
They're living in rows of cages in his laboratory, each 2 years
old, 3 to 4 inches long and bright blue.
   In addition, Chapman has older, larger blues that have been
donated over the years by lobstermen. He fetched two for a
photographer - a 1&rsqb; pounder that is 8 years old and a 2{ pounder
that is about 10 years old.
   ``An obvious question is do blue lobsters survive at the same
rate as regular lobsters do? What we need to know is do they behave
the same when they're introduced to the ocean bottom.'' he said.
   To answer those questions, he has begun studies to see how blue
lobsters behave when introduced to different environments with and
without the presence of predators.
   David Dow, a former lobsterman and executive director of the
Maine Lobster Institute at the University of Maine, thinks
Chapman's work could be important for the future of the industry.
   ``We don't know how long our production is going to last,'' he
said. ``Ten years down the road, we might not have as large a
supply. Or 10 years down the road, if we do our homework and expand
our markets, we might want to increase our supply.''
   Anthony D'Agostino, director of the Montauk Marine Science
Institute on Long Island, said Chapman's project seemed
``worthwhile.''
   ``I just wonder if he has enough funding to do it properly,''
said D'Agostino, who has been studying lobsters since 1975.
   Chapman's funding is slight - he started with $7,000 from the
Lobster Advisory Council and keeps going with a yearly stipend of
about $600 from the Maine Lobstermen's Association.
   For all Chapman's work, however, he can't answer the key
question on every lobster-lover's mind - do blues taste the same?
   ``Everyone asks that question,'' Chapman said. ``The problem is
we've never had enough to be able to eat any. So I don't know. I've
never eaten a blue lobster.''
