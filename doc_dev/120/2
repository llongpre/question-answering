   ``Shirley,'' a 25-pound male
lobster with claws as big as baseball mitts, returned to the ocean
today, saved from a dinner plate by animal rights activists, a
seafood vendor and state officials.
   Lifting the giant crustacean by its claws and tail, seafood
dealers from Portland and Philadelphia gently swung him over the
side of a Maine Marine Patrol boat into 22-feet-deep water near
fog-shrouded Portland Head Light in this Portland suburb.
   Bob, a companion lobster weighing in at 19} pounds, was dropped
into the water moments later.
   Dana Neuts, retail manager of Harbor Fish Market in Portland,
said he wasn't used to the idea of returning potential seafood to
the sea, but in the case of Shirley and Bob he had no complaints.
   ``It feels great. It really does,'' Neuts said. ``I like the
idea of the whole thing.''
   ``These are well-traveled lobsters,'' said Kevin Hill, the
Philadelphia seafood vendor who accompanied Shirley and Bob on
their flight to Portland on Monday. ``We shouldn't be catching
lobsters this size. Maine is the only state that's doing anything
to protect them, and that's why we're here.''
   The two lobsters spent the night in a 12-by-4-foot tank in
Neuts' market along the Portland waterfront before being placed
aboard the 35-foot boat for the half-hour ride through choppy seas
to a protected cove off Cape Elizabeth.
   Shirley, whose age has been estimated at 40 to 125 years old,
and her smaller companion were rescued from a Philadelphia man who
wanted to serve them for Easter dinner.
   ``This is symbolic of what we're trying to do and what citizens
are trying to do for a natural, sustainable resource,'' said Col.
Robert Fogg, chief of the Bureau of Marine Patrol of the state
Department of Marine Resources. ``By protecting these large
lobsters, there's more of a chance of them reproducing'' and
perpetuating the industry.
   ``It shows there's a lot of concern about our natural resources
out there,'' Fogg added.
   Maine law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five
inches, covering crustaceans heavier than 4 to 5 pounds.
   The Marine Patrol said the two lobsters appeared to be in
``excellent'' shape after their flight and enjoyed a seafood dinner
in their tank at the Portland fish market.
   ``They were real frisky,'' said Officer Donald K. Lockhart Jr.
``They put a quahog in there and the big one just snapped it up
like it was butter. They left a crab in there overnight and it was
gone this morning.''
   The lobsters had been trucked from Long Island, N.Y., to
Philadelphia, where they were sold to a customer for $287.
   Animal rights activists took up the lobsters' cause when they
heard that Art Miller, a retired carpenter, planned to use them for
a feast.
   Hill, owner of Hill's Main Line Seafood Co. in the Philadelphia
suburb of Ardmore, persuaded Miller to take 45 pounds of smaller
lobsters instead.
   Hill put the lobsters in a window tank for the rest of their
visit to Philadelphia's Main Line, acknowledging that saving
lobsters from dinner was something new for him.
   ``It's been very good for business,'' he said. Thousands of
people dropped by for a look at Shirley. ``If they don't buy now,
at least they know where we are,'' said Hill.
   Pity Not Cruelty Inc., a small animal rights group, made
arrangements with Maine officials to turn the creatures loose and
assumed the $40 flight cost.
   It may seem a lot of trouble for a couple of lobsters, but group
vice president Gloria Felscher-Cohen makes no apologies.
   ``Why not?'' she asked. ``These two lobsters have survived
hazards, particularly Shirley, over 100 years. Why should she need
to succumb to the cruelest predator of all, man?''
