   Tom Stanesa is as comfortable flying
cross-country as most people are driving to work. He should be;
he's racked up more than 1 million miles in the air on business
trips for Caterpillar Inc.
   ``Flying planes was all I ever wanted to do,'' he said.
   He started out to be a pilot, but an accident during Navy flight
training affected his vision. So he's flown as a passenger, and
logged every run.
   About a year after he joined Peoria-based Caterpillar in 1967,
Stanesa took a 140-mile business flight to St. Louis and jotted the
mileage and a few flight details in a notebook.
   Two decades later, Stanesa's weathered notebook is crammed with
37 single-spaced pages of notes documenting 1,403 flights for the
world's biggest maker of earth-moving equipment.
   His total so far is 1,008,752 miles.
   ``I know there are others in the million-mile category'' at the
company, said Caterpillar spokesman Mark Polzin. ``But Tom's
probably the only one who can prove it.''
   His work has taken him to 26 countries on 42 different types of
airplanes. He has traveled on 29 domestic airlines and 30 foreign
carriers, and made 62 Atlantic crossings.
   Bad weather and risky landings have not soured Stanesa on
flying, but he does have a complaint.
   ``It's not very fun to fly anymore,'' he said. ``There's so much
lost luggage and incredible damage being done to luggage. And the
airports are extremely overcrowded.''
   No, Stanesa hasn't taken gotten any free flights _ Caterpillar
collects his frequent flier bonuses.

   ``Lobzilla,'' a gigantic lobster spared a
date with a boiling pot after a wave of public sympathy, was flown
from North Carolina to Maine by an animal rights group Thursday to
be returned to the ocean.
   But the group didn't get to make the release. State marine
patrol agents confiscated the illegally oversized crustacean _ and
then released it themselves.
   The 21-pound lobster almost got cooked and served Nov. 30 in
Shucker's Oyster Bar in Charlotte, N.C. But after some publicity
from an animal rights group, manager Kurt Larkins decided to give
Lobzilla to the group, gratis.
   Larkins said the lobster measured more than 3 feet when
stretched out.
   ``Oh, he's so beautiful,'' said Cam MacQueen, of People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals, who accompanied the lobster which
traveled in an icebox labeled: ``Eat beans, not beings.''
   ``He is truly majestic, incredible to look at,'' said Ms.
MacQueen, who estimated his age at 150 years.
   Carol L. Burnett of the Washington-based animal rights group
said the group picked Maine for Lobzilla's release because state
law does not permit the taking of lobsters whose shells measure
more than 5 inches, in order to preserve large ones for breeding.
   Because that law also prohibits possession of oversize lobsters,
marine patrol agents confiscated Lobzilla on arrival, then went
ahead and released it.
