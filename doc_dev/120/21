<HEAD>Canadian Cabinet Rejects Proposed Settlement of Lobster Dispute</HEAD>

   A Canadian board on Wednesday rejected a proposal to settle a
free trade dispute between lobstermen in the United States and
Canada.
   Canadian fishermen are allowed to keep and sell smaller lobsters
than their U.S. counterparts. Representatives of the U.S. and
Canadian lobster industries recently had proposed increasing the
minimum size of lobsters taken along Canada's Atlantic Coast to the
U.S. level of 3\ inches.
   The proposal also called for creating a joint U.S.-Canadian
committee to discuss lobster management issues and for both
countries to work together to promote and market lobsters.
   But on Wednesday, Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie announced
in Ottawa that the country's federal cabinet had rejected the
proposed settlement.
   John Kearney, a spokesman for the Maritime Fishermen's Union in
Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, hailed the decision.
   ``We have no biological reason in Canada for increasing our
minimum size,'' he said. ``We have a whole range of management and
regulatory measures ... that are non-existent in the United
States.''
   But lobster industry officials from Maine predicted a worsening
of relations between the two countries because of the decision.
   ``For them to pull out of it means there's going to be more
bickering and fighting among all the various factions of the
industry,'' said William Anderson, a lobsterman from Lubec and
chairman of the state's Lobster Advisory Council.
   To U.S. fishermen, the dispute over size is much more than
academic because they compete against Canadian lobstermen who sell
the majority of their catch in the United States.
   ``It's a big deal because so many lobsters fit into that size
range. Lobsters that are just over that (minimum) measure make up
the majority of the catch,'' said David Dow, executive director of
the Maine Lobster Institute, a scientific and educational
organization that fosters cooperation in the lobster industry.
   At the urging of U.S. lobstermen, President Bush signed
legislation last December banning the import of live Canadian
lobsters that are smaller than the minimum U.S. size.
   Ottawa contended the new law violated the U.S.-Canada Free Trade
Agreement and would cost the industry $30 million of its $180
million live lobster industry. But an international panel ruled in
late May that the U.S. law did not violate the pact.
   The proposal rejected Wednesday called for increasing the
minimum size of lobsters taken along Canada's Atlantic Coast to the
U.S. level of 3\ inches from the crustacean's eye socket to the
edge of its body where the tail begins.
   Currently, Canada has a range of minimum sizes from 2{ inches to
3 3-16 inches, depending on where the lobsters are caught.
   Some Canadian lobster industry officials were upset by their
country's decision. The nation's largest lobster exporter,
Clearwater Fine Foods of suburban Bedford, Nova Scotia, has long
supported raising size limits for what it says are conservation
reasons.
   ``There is no competent biologist who advises other than the
desirability of raising size imits,'' company spokesman Doug
Robinson told Canadian Press on Wednesday.
   ``The bottom line is most lobsters now caught are immature. They
have not spawned,'' he said.
