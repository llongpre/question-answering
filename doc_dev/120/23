   Hot lights rather than boiling water may
have killed a 1\-pound lobster that gained attention when the woman
who bought it for a Valentine's Day feast decided to spare it from
the pot.
   Suzanne Brown said the $14 Maine lobster she dubbed Oscar died
this weekend.
   Gary Gerontis, a seafood merchant who had offered to fly the
lobster back to New England so that it could be tossed back into the
ocean, told Mrs. Brown on Friday that Oscar was terminally ill.
   She said she gave him permission to put the lobster to sleep by
placing it in the freezer.
   Mrs. Brown, tearful over the whole incident, said she feared the
media attention she stirred up to save Oscar might have caused its
demise.
   She said she told her story to the news media in hopes of finding
a tank for Oscar. The story of the woman who fell for the lobster
became an instant hit, and Oscar spent ensuing days under hot
television lights, a pen shoved in one claw to sign autographs.
   ``Everybody thought it was a wonderful story and it did make a
lot of people happy,'' she said.
   Mrs. Brown said she planned to bury the crustacean at Point
Penrose State Park.
   Her husband, Dave, planned to help bury the lobster that was
intended for his dinner plate. While he supported her efforts, he
offered a final observation: ``I never did get my dinner.''
