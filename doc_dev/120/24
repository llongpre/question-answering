Mimi, the 17 1/2-pound lobster described as the Elizabeth Taylor of 
crustaceans, died of natural causes days after being shipped to her new home -- 
at a restaurant. She was between 20 and 100 years old, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Mimi, captured last week off the Maine coast and flown to Detroit, died in the 
tank at Carl's Chop House, which paid $320 for the huge lobster. 
</P>
<P>
"She had quit moving. I picked her up. She still didn't move," said Barry 
Hornecker, executive chef at Carl's. 
</P>
<P>
So he chilled and poached Mimi and began making plans for a feast. 
</P>
<P>
"Mimi was like Elizabeth Taylor. . . . She was always beautiful," said Jim 
Richards, owner of the Long Wharf Lobster Co. in Portland, Me., which flew the 
lobster to Detroit.
