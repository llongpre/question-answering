   Electronic equipment similar to ``laser tag''
games is helping game wardens detect sophisticated lobster poachers.
   The Passive Integrated Tag Gun actually is a pistol-shaped
sensing unit connected to a computer; it sets off an alarm when it
detects a tiny metal tag placed in the body of a lobster, said game
warden Mike Castleton.
   When a lobster is showered with the invisible but harmless beam,
the tag number is recorded and displayed on a monitor. The tags,
nearly impossible to detect with the naked eye, give crustaceans
sort of an electronic fingerprint.
   The device has been used to track migrating fish for several
years, but was used to catch a poacher of California spiny lobsters
for the first time in early October off the San Diego coast,
Castleton said.
   It remains to be seen, however, whether the gun will reduce such
illegal catches or just cause poachers to figure out ways to avoid
detection. ``They are forcing us to become more sophisticated,''
Castleton said.
   ``You catch on to all their tricks after a while when you've
seen the same thing a couple of hundred times. People try to hide
lobsters in their clothes, secret compartments in their boats, all
over.''
   Though its now being used only against sport fishermen,
Castleton said he expects the electronic gun eventually to be used
to reduce commercial poaching. Commercial fishermen often complain
that competitors raid their traps.
   More dishonest fishermen than ever seem to be plucking lobsters
and other fish from Southern California waters, he said. Entire
generations of lobsters can be wiped out by just a few aggressive
poachers.
   California spiny lobsters, which thrive off the San Diego coast,
live in crevices and feed at night on fish, algae, eel grass and
invertebrates. Their name is derived from the sharp spines on their
shells. They don't have large pinching claws like their cousins in
the Atlantic Ocean.
