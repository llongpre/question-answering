   A man who is in hot water after being
caught with an oversize lobster says ``Herb'' was a pet and Marine
Patrol officers went too far when they seized the 10-pound
crustacean and made two boys cry.
   James Benenson, a New Yorker and summer resident of this Down
East town, said Friday he would not mind paying the $71.50 fine for
lobster fishing without a license. But he pleaded innocent at
arraignment Thursday.
   ``The reason I'm scrapping about it is that I think it is quite
silly bothering children over a benign act,'' Benenson said.
   He said two officers confiscated Herb earlier this month from
the submersible box where his sons James, 10, and Clement, 8, had
kept it for about seven years.
   ``They cried their eyes out,'' said Benenson. He recalled his
younger son telling him, ``Daddy, police are supposed to help you,
not make you cry.''
   Benenson said he does not know where Herb was taken, ``but we
hope he's not in someone's stomach.''
   Messages left Friday at the Marine Patrol headquarters in
Augusta were not returned immediately. A secretary said no officers
were available at the Ellsworth field office, and referred calls to
Augusta.
   Herb lived on seafood fed by his ``family.''
   ``He loved pogies,'' a fish used for bait and oil, said
Benenson. ``He loved dogfish. He could eat a 3-foot dogfish in less
than a week, and he would eat everything but the teeth.''
   Herb also loved to be scratched while lying on the dock,
preferably with mussel shells _ and that is what ultimately led to
Benenson's citation.
   Officers spotted the lobster earlier this month. Later, two
officers came to Benenson's home and demanded identification so
they could cite him, Benenson said.
   Benenson said he tried to find a new home for Herb at aquariums
but failed, and the officers later confiscated the lobster.
   Technically, Benenson is accused of lobster fishing with the
wooden box his sons used to catch crabs, said Benenson.
   His lawyer, Barry Mills, said he hopes to work out an agreement
with prosecutors ``in as amicable a way as possible.''
   ``On a scale of crime from one to 1,000, this is a one half,''
said Mills.
