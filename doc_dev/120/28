JACK SMITH: SHOWING SOME BACKBONE BY AVOIDING MEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
Gradually, in response to appeals from save-the-animals groups and in obeisance 
to my own conscience, I am eliminating meat from my diet. That is, I have given 
up scallops, oysters, snails and all the other invertebrates, which I never 
liked anyway. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to be cynical. I am horrified by stories of how young cows are 
raised for veal, and I don't even like to think of what life must be like for 
chickens. In fact, I have given up veal. The problem is, I still eat chicken. 
</P>
<P>
My excuse, of course, is that it is not ordained that we refrain from eating 
meat. Random Chance made us omnivorous. We are at the top of the food chain, 
and we may eat whatever appeals to us, without sin. In the Bible, did they not 
barbecue the fatted calf? Was Jesus not a fisherman? 
</P>
<P>
It is also true that the people who champion animals are more inclined to favor 
vertebrates than non-vertebrates. It is much easier to love a panda than a 
jellyfish. 
</P>
<P>
However, as Sy Montgomery noted on The Times' science page some time ago, 
people are beginning to realize that invertebrates are worthy creatures too. In 
Plainfield, N.H., he pointed out, the people have adopted the Cobblestone Tiger 
Beetle as their town insect, and sales of T-shirts displaying the beetle on 
them pay for the protection of its habitat. 
</P>
<P>
That being the way the wind is blowing, I am happy to receive a letter from 
Mario E. Baur, a professor of chemistry at UCLA, commending me for my recent 
column on the banana slug, a species that, as he points out, "does not usually 
receive favorable publicity." 
</P>
<P>
Introducing me to a new word, he observes that "unfortunately, most humans, 
even those who relate positively to animals, tend to be rather chordocentric 
(from Phylum Chordata, the vertebrates, broadly speaking) and may be willing to 
grant a certain right to exist to a lamb or squirrel while wishing to deny it 
to a termite, mosquito or slug." 
</P>
<P>
As Montgomery pointed out, people used to think that "invertebrates were there 
to swat, spray or step on." 
</P>
<P>
I myself have trouble identifying with flies, ants and back-yard snails. I 
realize that flies are marvelous flying machines, that ants exist in highly 
organized societies and that snails -- frankly, I can't think of anything good 
to say about snails. 
</P>
<P>
"Surely," however, Prof. Baur argues, "all creatures are equal in the eyes of 
Uncle Random. . . . Even spineless individuals have feelings." 
</P>
<P>
Baur recalls that some years ago a certain garden snail in their yard came to 
recognize his wife, and would crawl toward her whenever she put out birdseed. 
This snail (they recognized it by its markings) would not come out to anyone 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"It continued to appear in this fashion for most of the summer and fall, and 
then, I presume, someone -- perhaps one of the skunks or opossums to whom we 
try to show hospitality -- got him or her. Severe but necessary is the way of 
the food chain." 
</P>
<P>
Baur confesses that he can not bear the sight of live lobsters in holding tanks 
at supermarkets. (I have also seen them in some restaurants, waiting for some 
hungry patron to pick them out.) 
</P>
<P>
"I used to love to eat lobsters," Baur admits, "until one day, while keeping 
one alive until dinner time in my bathtub, I had occasion to watch it and 
realized that it was watching me, with emotions which I could (I hope not 
entirely fancifully) imagine." 
</P>
<P>
I am reminded of the remark made by Dahlia Gomez when her husband, Romulo, 
dropped a live lobster into a pot of boiling water. She turned to me and said, 
"They don't like it, you know." 
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Baur no longer eats lobsters or any other wild creatures, though he 
thinks it quite all right to kill and eat domestic animals. "I cheerfully eat 
steak, hamburgers, chicken and yes, Dodger Dogs." 
</P>
<P>
As I say, I'm gradually eliminating certain kinds of animal flesh from my diet, 
but, like Prof. Baur, I tend to rationalize. I may give up steak, but not 
hamburger; I may give up oysters, but not orange roughie; I may give up shrimp, 
but not bacon; I may give up veal but not little pig sausages. 
</P>
<P>
And I'll never give up Dodger Dogs.
