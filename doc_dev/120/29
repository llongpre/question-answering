<LEADPARA>  Bay Area blues singer Vala Cupp once told us she doesn't like to eat things
that have faces. Do a lobster's buggy eyes, waving antennae and oral mandibles
add up to a face? Does it make you squirm when you throw a live lobster in
boiling water and it thrashes around? We tell how to prepare these crustaceans
humanely and deliciously.; NIBBLE ON THIS  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  Instant gazpacho; Sure, you should make it with fresh tomatoes, peppers and
corn. But if you're in a hurry, try Sam's Three-Can Gazpacho. Throw together a
quart of Spicy Hot V-8 Juice, a seven-ounce can of chopped green chilies and a
seven-ounce can of drained corn (12 or 15 ounces if you really like corn).
Chill thoroughly.  </TEXT>
