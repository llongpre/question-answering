   A 25-pound lobster that nearly became
somebody's Easter dinner has been rescued and will be jetting to
Maine on Monday to live out its old age beneath the Atlantic.
   Publicity forced a seafood company owner, a seafood lover, an
animal-rights group and the Maine Department of Marine Resources
into an unlikely alliance to save the creature, which was estimated
to be between 40 and 125 years old.
   Also saved from the pot was a 19}-pound companion.
   ``This was something that strikes you in your moral craw,'' said
Gloria Felscher-Cohen, vice president of the rights group, Pity Not
Cruelty Inc.
   ``Here is a very old lobster and it just seemed disgusting that
it should end its life to the cruelest predator _ man _ in a pot of
boiling water.''
   The 25-pounder, equipped with claws the size of baseball mitts,
arrived from Boston on March 25 after an order got mixed up at
Hill's Main Line Seafood Co. in Ardmore.
   When owner Kevin Hill recovered from his astonishment, he and
his staff dubbed her Shirley. Then he sold her and the other hefty
crustacean to a regular customer, a retired carpenter from
Haverford, for $287.
   But before Shirley was out the door, The Philadelphia Inquirer
ran a story about her, and Hill's phone began ringing with calls
from lobster advocates, including Ms. Felscher-Cohen.
   She told him it would be a ``lovely gesture'' during the
Passover and Easter holidays to celebrate themes of freedom and
resurrection by buying back the lobsters.
   She even offered to top the carpenter's price.
   After several calls like that, Hill was convinced. When the
carpenter came to pick up the second lobster, Hill offered him $387
for both.
   ``His first feeling was `What do you mean they're going to take
the lobsters?''' Hill said.
   ``I said, `Look, there's too many people (calling). Let's free
the things.''
   The customer, Robert Miller, agreed to exchange the large
lobsters for 45 pounds of smaller ones, rather than for money.
   ``I think it's ridiculous,'' Miller said. ``What's the
difference between a one-pound lobster and a 25-pound lobster?''
   Pity Not Cruelty, meanwhile, had already made arrangements with
the state of Maine to turn the creatures loose. The group assumed
the flight costs.
   Crated and covered with seaweed, the lobsters are due to fly to
Portland Monday afternoon for a few hours of observation.
   ``If they are healthy, we will liberate them the next day,''
said Lt. Joseph Fessenden of the Maine Bureau of Marine Patrol.
   They should be freed off the shore of Cape Elizabeth, by the
Portland Head Light, he said.
   In Maine, he added, it would be illegal to catch Shirley,
because she is much longer than the five-inch maximum (measured
from the rear of the eye socket to the end of the body shell)
allowed by the Maine Department of Natural Resources. The older
lobsters are protected, he said, because they have more offspring.
   His department will probably investigate Shirley's origins, he
said.
   The state helped save a 23{-pound Alaskan lobster from gourmands
last November, he said.
   That lobster ``was very lively,'' he said. ``I'm pretty
optimistic that these will fare as well.''
