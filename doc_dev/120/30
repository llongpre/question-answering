   A monster lobster, weighing 35 pounds and believed
to be 140 years old, made a big splash at a display in downtown
Boston this weekend.
   The lobster was caught Thursday off the coast of New Bedford
when it was dragged in with a load of scallops, said Heather
Robertson, spokeswoman for The Boston and Maine Fish Co., which
bought the creature.
   At about 3 foot long, the lobster is believed to be one of the
largest and oldest ever captured off the Bay State coast.
   ``I've been in the seafood business for over a decade and this
is the largest lobster I've ever seen,'' said Larry Smith, owner of
the fish company.
   The lobster was displayed at Boston's Faneuil Hall and was moved
to the New England Aquarium on Saturday.
