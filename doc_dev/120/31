   Residents keep their windows shut and an
inn has closed as the stench from thousands of rotting fish fills
the air.
   In the waters of Quahog Bay, Maine's latest menhaden kill has
suffocated thousands of lobsters, crabs, snails and other sea life.
   ``The eels are even dead and they're hard to kill,'' said Linda
Webber, who owns Webber and Sons Lobster Co. with her husband in
this seacoast town of 2,500 about 15 miles from Portland. Webber
said the company has lost about $10,000 worth of lobsters.
   Robert Waddle, owner of Quahog Lobster Inc., the other lobster
dealer at Quahog Bay, said he has lost at least that much. Lobsters
generally sell for less than $4 a pound in Maine this time of year;
wholesalers commonly keep the crustaceans in holding pens in bays
or harbors.
   ``The overall loss is tremendous. Not just my loss, but
everyone's loss because everything in the bay's been killed,''
Waddle said.
   Vast schools of menhaden, or pogies, first were chased into
Quahog Bay by feeding bluefish about a month ago, Waddle said
Wednesday. The schools severely depleted the oxygen in the water,
killing lobsters and other aquatic life.
   Dead pogies can be seen floating in clumps throughout the cove
and are caked onto rocks along the shore.
   ``It's been like this for almost a month, but the past few days
have been unbearable,'' said Marianne Lavine, who has kept a summer
home at Quahog Bay for 20 years. ``We've had the doors and windows
closed for three days now. It irritates your throat and nose. It's
disgusting.''
   The smell is so bad that a bed-and-breakfast on the bay closed.
One of the inn's owners said he and his wife will not reopen until
the odor is gone.
   Fish kills have happened along Maine's coast several times in
recent years, but ``this is certainly a large die-off,'' said
Marshall Murphy, spokesman for the state Department of Marine
Resources.
   Pogies are oily fish that can weigh up to two pounds and are
used for lobster bait, fertilizer and cat food.
   An estimated 3,000 pounds of pogies, or 50 bushels, washed
ashore in Belfast Bay in September 1987. In August 1985, about
8,000 bushels of pogies washed into a cove in Southport, and
officials brought in a huge vacuum cleaner to suck the rotting fish
out of the water. In 1984 about 25,000 menhaden and 500 bluefish
died in the Kennebec River, also from oxygen deprivation.
   Murphy said the state won't attempt a cleanup in Quahog Bay. He
said past cleanups have proved to be ``very expensive and less than
totally successful.''
   ``At this point, our decision is to allow nature to continue the
decomposition process of the menhaden,'' he said. It takes about 10
days for the fish to decompose.
   There is no river is at the head of the bay to flush the cove,
so only winds and tides may help.
   A northerly wind last week carried some of the pogies away, but
a southwesterly wind this week carried the dead fish back into the
bay, Murphy said.
