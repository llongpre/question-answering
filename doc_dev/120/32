<DESCRIPT>  RECIPE; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  LOBSTER, although expensive, is one of the most versatile of seafood.
Traditionally, it is boiled, steamed or grilled and served with a range of
sauces, often quite rich. It makes a delicious soup, tastes good cold and fits
right into today's lighter menus.;    But it was a pair of traditional lobster
recipes that were requested by D.F. Cruff of San Jose: Lobster Newburg and
Lobster Thermidor.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mrs. Gregory Dumas of Milpitas and Carol Zink of San Jose sent replies.
Zink's recipe from "New England Cookbook" by Eleanor Early included this bit
of history: The recipe is from Delmonico's Restaurant and was invented by a
Mr. Wenburg. Initially it was called Lobster Wenburg. Then Delmonico quarreled
with Wenburg and changed the name of the dish to Newburg.; LOBSTER NEWBURG; 2
cups cold boiled lobster (2 medium-size lobsters);  1/2 cup butter, divided; 
1/4 cup dry sherry; 3 tablespoons flour; 1 cup heavy cream;  1/2 teaspoon
salt;   Few grains cayenne;  1/4 teaspoon paprika;  Cut lobster into chunky
pieces. Melt butter, add lobster, saute for 1 minute, tossing lightly. Pour
sherry over lobster. Let stand while making a heavy cream sauce with other 1/4
cup butter, the flour and cream. Make the cream sauce in the top of a double
boiler. Add salt, cayenne and paprika. Add lobster mixture. Cook all together
10 to 15 minutes in double boiler. Cool. Chill in refrigerator 24 hours.
Reheat before serving. Serve on toast points.; (hbox);    LOBSTER THERMIDOR; 6
large live lobsters or large frozen lobster tails; 2 cloves garlic, chopped; 1
onion, chopped;  1/2 cup salt; 2 teaspoons pepper;  3/4 cup plus 3 level
tablespoons butter;  1/2 cup flour; 1 1/2  cup light cream; 9 mushrooms, cut
up; 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard; 3 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley; 1 cup
sherry; 3 dashes paprika;  Parmesan cheese;  Put lobsters or tails to boil for
30 minutes in a pot of water seasoned with garlic, onion, salt and pepper. Let
cool. Remove foam from the pot. Remove the meat from shells. Dice meat and set
aside and reserve the shells. Melt 3/4 cup butter in a pot. Add flour and stir
until smooth. Add cream, stirring until the sauce is thick. Take off the heat
and set aside. Saute lobster meat and mushrooms in the 3 tablespoons butter
for 5 minutes. Add the lobster meat, mushrooms, mustard and parsley to the
cream sauce. Stir for 5 minutes, then add sherry and blend in well. Add
paprika, then place the mixture in the lobster shells. Sprinkle with Parmesan
cheese, put in 450-degree oven and bake for 15 minutes. Serves 6.; You've got
a friend; Harriet M. Hegg of Hollister and Olga Flores of San Jose sent
recipes for friendship cake in response to requests from Melody Govaerts of
Los Altos and Peggy Page of Santa Clara. Although the recipe calls for 1 1/2
cups starter, Flores suggests starting from scratch since the unused liquid
becomes the next batch of starter.;  FRIENDSHIP CAKE;   Starter: On the first
day, combine 1 29-ounce can of sliced peaches with juice, chopped up, and 2
1/2 cups sugar in a large jar or other glass container. Cover with foil but
leave container on the counter, never refrigerate or freeze starter. Stir
every day for 10 days. On day 10, add 2 1/2 cups sugar, 1 16-ounce can crushed
or chunk pineapple with juice. Stir every day for 10 days. On day 20 add 2 1/2
cups sugar, 1 16-ounce can fruit cocktail with juice and 1 10-ounce can of
maraschino cherries, chopped. Stir every day for 10 days. On day 30, drain off
the liquid to share with friends, but keep 1 1/2 cups for the next starter.
The recipe provides enough fruit for three to four cakes.;    Cake: Mix 1
package cake mix with pudding (yellow, white or orange), 1 1/2 cups drained
fruit, 4 eggs, 2/3 cup oil and nuts, if desired. Pour into bundt pan and bake
at 350 degrees for 40 to 45 minutes or until tester comes out clean.; Calls
for help;    Francis McCabe of San Jose wants to know where she can get yellow
rice mix that she used so frequently when she lived in the South. She uses it
with beans.  </TEXT>
