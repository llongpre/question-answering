   Lobstermen are feuding again in the rich
lobster-fishing areas of Casco Bay, and in one dispute two
fishermen were tossed in the harbor, a gun was brandished and a
boat damaged.
   ``It's a territorial dispute,'' Maine Marine Patrol Lt. Joseph
Fessenden said Tuesday. ``It's a situation where there's a limited
area of space to fish.
   ``The lobstermen are competing for the same area and we've had a
situation where they've been cutting each other's traps,'' he said.
``There have been several lobstermen who've lost several thousand
dollars worth of traps. This has been happening throughout the
summer.''
   Discontent has been high among Maine's estimated 4,000 full-time
lobstermen. Strikes throughout the summer protested prices being
paid for lobster catches.
   Softshell lobsters often have sold for as low as $1.75 to $1.85
a pound wholesale this summer, said Bob Brown, president of the
Maine Import-Export Lobster Dealers Association. He said this price
resulted from supply and demand. Maine harvested about 22 million
pounds of lobster in 1988, 24 million in 1989 and this year's
prediction is 26 million pounds.
   Under pressure to maintain their income, the dozen boat crews
feuding in Portland Harbor have been suspicious of others taking
more than their fair share, Fessenden said.
   ``They call this area `the Bay of Pigs' and this is one of the
reasons,'' he said.
   Lobstermen have their own specially marked buoys attached to a
line of lobster traps. Every day, they travel through their
territory, stopping at each of their buoys to haul up their lines,
empty the traps, put in new bait and dump them back in the water.
   On Monday, a dispute between the captains of two boats, the B&amp;B
and the Rambler, turned violent in what Fessenden described as the
worst confrontation he has seen in 15 years as a Marine Patrol
officer.
   Fessenden said the B&amp;B pulled alongside the Rambler as its
captain, Matthew Chipman, 28, of Portland, was trying to pull up a
string of traps that had been cut.
   Norman Solak, 52, a longtime lobsterman from West Buxton, and
one of his crew, Edward Mains Jr., 36, of Gorham, boarded the
Rambler, Fessenden said.
   The two crews struggled, he said, and Solak and Mains were
thrown into the harbor.
   Fessenden said the Rambler's crew charged later in a radio call
to the Coast Guard that one of the B&amp;B's crew brandished a gun.
   The Marine Patrol and the Coast Guard confiscated three weapons
from the B&amp;B: a .30-caliber rifle, a .22-caliber handgun and a
.38-caliber handgun.
   One of the boats also was damaged in the confrontation, said a
Marine Patrol officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fessenden said the Marine Patrol is investigating whether to
file criminal charges against the crews involved.
   ``It's highly illegal to molest another man's gear,'' said David
Dow, executive director of the Lobster Institute, a cooperative
research program at the University of Maine at Orono. ``It's an
automatic, three-year license suspension for anybody caught doing
it.
   ``But territoriality has been around for as long as anybody can
remember,'' Dow said. ``It's rare that you see a territorial
dispute flare up in this overt fashion. Most of the territorial
disputes are only handled in the thick fog and the black of night.''
