<HL> To Get a Lobsterman Steaming, Just Try Messing With His Traps </HL>

   Maine lobstermen are considered an independent and cantankerous breed, and most attempts at intervention in their industry are about as welcome as an empty lobster trap. 

   The latest try is no exception -- though it began as a bid to improve lobster traps. 
Instead, it's resulted in traps that let lobsters get away, lobstermen complain. 

   The dispute involves a state rule requiring that the traps include some biodegradable parts, so that lobsters can escape from "ghost traps" -- the estimated 92,000 traps lost on the ocean floor annually that keep catching and killing lobsters. 

   Some lobstermen have experimented with the new traps, usually equipped with a plastic panel attached by iron fasteners designed to rust out. 
But they say the fasteners fall apart too fast. 
They are supposed to last a full season, usually from March to December, but in some cases fall apart within three to six months. 

   "The concept is a good one," says Edward A. Blackmore, president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association. 
"But the technology to develop the biodegradable fasteners didn't come along as well as everyone thought it would." 

   Frank Chalmers, a Maine lobsterman, says he used some of the traps for six months, and "about half the doors came open in that time." 
But, he adds, different versions of the traps were tested, and now some think "they know what will work and what won't." 

   The law took effect Jan. 1 but hasn't been enforced. 
And state Rep. Roland Salsbury of Bar Harbor, whose constituency includes about 500 of Maine's more than 8,000 licensed lobstermen, has proposed a bill delaying the law until 1990, when the traps also must conform with U.S. rules requiring larger escape vents to protect smaller-than-legal-size lobster. 

   Some say the real reason for the griping is that Maine lobstermen simply don't like anybody telling them what to do -- even if it's for their own good. 
One Maine newspaper estimates that two million pounds of lobster, about 10% of the annual catch, are lost each year to ghost traps. 
Others say its closer to 400,000 pounds. 

   William Brennan, Department of Marine Resources commissioner, says the rule has been in the works for six years and stems from concerns expressed by the industry. 
The agency's advisory council, he says, decided that giving the lobstermen "six years to adjust to a change they recommended themselves is enough."
