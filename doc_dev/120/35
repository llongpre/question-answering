<HEAD>Panel To Hear Arguments On New U.S. Law</HEAD>

   An international panel is to decide in April whether an American
law banning the import of undersized lobsters violates the Free
Trade Agreement between the United States and Canada.
   The panel, which was scheduled to hear arguments on the dispute
today, is to recommend a resolution in mid-May that could range
from leaving the law as it is to banning it altogether. The board
of three Americans and two Canadians could also call for a
compromise.
   ``Lobster fishing is the backbone of hundreds of coastal
communities in Canada. Millions and millions of dollars in lost
income are at stake,'' said John Kearney, who represents the
Maritime Fishermen's Union in Nova Scotia.
   Bob Brown, director of the Maine Import-Export Lobster Dealers
Association, said the dispute is ``on everybody's lips on both
sides of the border.''
   At issue is a bill that President Bush signed into law in
December, prohibiting the importation or interstate transportation
of lobsters that do not meet federal minimum-size standards.
   Lobsters that are shorter than 3\ inches from the eye socket to
where the tail begins are illegal under the new law. By 1992, the
minimum legal size will be 3 5-16 inches.
   But in Canada, lobster fishermen can catch lobsters 1-16th of an
inch shorter than those allowed in the United States.
   Lobstermen, dealers and industry observers throughout New
England and the Canadian Maritime provinces say the panel's
decision could have a major impact on the industry.
   ``It could change the way lobsters are marketed,'' and more
significantly might change the way the government regulates lobster
management, said University of Southern Maine Professor Charles
Colgan, a former state economist.
   Canadian officials argue that the law is purely a trade barrier
that violates the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. They say their
country has plenty of conservation laws, and the United States has
no right to tell them how to manage their resources.
   American lobstermen have complained to Congress that they could
not compete against the smaller, less expensive Canadian lobsters,
which were being shipped to American markets. The new law barring
the smaller lobsters could mean a potential loss to Canada of $20
million to $30 million in exports each year.
   American officials maintain that the law will protect the
lobster population by allowing more lobsters to live long enough to
reproduce.
   The new law as written will help American dealers protect their
domestic markets, but it also could lead to the loss of foreign
markets, industry sources say.
   Maine dealers previously could buy smaller lobsters from Canada
and pack them for shipment to out-of-state markets. The new law
prohibits that practice, and Maine and New England exporters are
making changes to adapt to the law.
   The board hearing the dispute could call for a compromise that
would allow imports only to American export companies or only
during certain times of the year, or to place quotas on undersize
lobster imports.
   The panel's decision would not be binding, but both countries
are obligated to honor it under provisions of the Free Trade
Agreement.
   It is only the second time since the Free Trade Agreement was
enacted on Jan. 1, 1989 that a panel has convened to resolve a
trade dispute.
