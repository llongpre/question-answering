   With Maine's rockbound coast in the
background, Captain Owen Beal hauls a trap over the side of his
lobster boat and makes his pitch to television viewers in a thick
Down East accent.
   ``You can have your lobster within 24 hours from Maine's clear,
cool ocean waters,'' says Beal, in a 60-second spot scheduled to
debut within the next month on cable TV stations in various major
U.S. markets.
   Beal, clad in a yellow slicker, tells viewers that all they have
to do is dial a toll-free telephone number if they want ``the
tastiest lobsters in the world'' on their dinner table.
   The ads will mark a 30-day trial of what is billed as the first
television sales and distribution network to guarantee home or
office delivery of live Maine lobsters anywhere in the nation
within 24 hours.
   The venture represents a merger of modern high-tech
telemarketing systems and a 75-year-old lobster pound operated in
this small eastern Maine fishing village by Sidney Look, the fourth
Look generation to run the business.
   The idea originated two years ago when Ed Dugay of Cherryfield,
a pilot who flies spotter planes for herring fishermen, brought
Maine products such as lobsters, blueberries and sardines as gifts
on a visit to his brother in Nashville, Tenn.
   ``He's involved in a lot of telemarketing,'' Dugay said of his
brother, Mike, and ``a lightbulb went on.'' The two brothers hit
upon the TV marketing plan and approached Look with it.
   ``It's a great marriage really. Sid has three lobster pounds and
a lot of inventory, and we're kind of acting as consultants,''
Dugay said Wednesday.
   Operators in Dallas will process telephone orders and feed them
into a computer. Between midnight and dawn, the data will be
transmitted along telephone lines to a recently-installed bank of
computers on the second floor of Look's shingled packing house at
the end of a wharf.
   At the start of the workday, the orders are printed out and the
lobsters are packed. At the same time, credit card numbers debit
customers' accounts and copies of the orders appear on the main
Federal Express computer in Memphis, Tenn.
   A truck arrives at 4 p.m. to pick up the lobsters, which are
shipped from Bangor International Airport before sunset.
   Launching the business from this village of 1,200 in a remote
section of the Maine coast forced the Dugays to overcome some
hurdles. Overnight shippers had no daily Federal Express service to
Jonesport before the inauguration of Look's Lobster Line.
   Likewise, Jonesport had no touch-tone phones, relying on rotary
dials or communication through an operator. Because computers
require touch-tone systems, Dugay had to add a conversion device to
the modem linking his phone line to the computer.
   Dugay says the markets for the initial ads still are being
selected, but he expects Denver and Chicago to be among them. The
minimum order will be for six, 1-pound to 1\-pound lobsters, at a
total cost of $89, plus $10 for shipping and handling.
   If the lobster line proves successful, Dugay says he is prepared
to offer other eastern Maine products, including quahogs, mussels
and blueberries.
