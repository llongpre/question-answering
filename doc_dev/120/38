Association of University Women traded their dressy attire for sweat shirts to
raise money for scholarships by selling shellfish.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Eight volunteers busily handed out at least 287 live lobsters, 20 cooked
ones for the faint of heart, 85 pounds of clams and 17 dozen blue point
oysters.;   It was the group's biggest fund-raiser of the year, said Rosanna
Yau, co-chairwoman of the Lobster Sale, which has been a Palo Alto tradition
since around the mid-1970s.;   She said the $1,500 raised by the sale will go
to the Educational Foundation of the American Association of University Women,
which provides scholarships to women around the nation, mostly for graduate
work.;   All the shellfish were paid for in advance "so there is no risk,"
said Marie Walbach, a member.;   Garnet Johnson, co-chairman of the sale,
said, "I've been dreaming about lobsters. . . . Once in a while I have a
nightmare that the lobsters aren't coming.";   But the crustaceans arrived on
time. Ed Zeldin, a semi-retired fish wholesaler from Fremont, helps the AAUW
procure the seafood. The shellfish, from the Atlantic off Massachusetts and
Maine, were flown in live to San Francisco International Airport, where Zeldin
picked them up Saturday morning in his refrigerated truck for the trip to Palo
Alto.;   For AAUW members, it's a time for camaraderie and friendship. Marcia
Baugh, a volunteer, said, "There is a feeling of doing something good
together. Much of what AAUW does is intellectual and this is more practical,
earthly.";   For the shoppers, it's a chance to make a contribution and have
fun later in the day. "We're going to have a party with friends," said Trina
Lovercheck of Palo Alto, who heard about annual lobster parties at the sale
and decided to buy six live lobsters. "It's our first time doing it.";   June
Schiller of Palo Alto watched at a slight distance while a volunteer handed
over eight of the live ones. "We have an annual party, perhaps for the past 12
years. It's a tradition. We take turns having it."  </TEXT>
