<LEADPARA>  IF COOKING live lobsters gives you the creeps, listen to this: A University of
Maine researcher says lobsters don't have enough of a brain to feel pain.;  
But in an effort to determine what cooking method would make lobsters wriggle
the least when cooked, Michael Loughlin steamed some on racks, put others in
warm water brought slowly to a boil, and hypnotized others before tossing them
in boiling water.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     His conclusion: Chill them on ice before dropping them in boiling water.;  
Loughlin's experiment was prompted by inquiries from supermarket chains about
how to cook lobsters humanely. In his research, Loughlin turned his attention
to keeping lobster flipping to a minimum so guilt-ridden cooks can feel
better.;   With clipboard, pen, stopwatch and video camera, Loughlin observed
200 lobsters being cooked. Lobsters kept on ice for 15 minutes and then
dropped into boiling water tended to wriggle for no more than 30 seconds, and
some didn't flip at all.  </TEXT>
