<LEADPARA>  CONSIDER the lobsters in the tank next time you're at the supermarket. Amid
rising bubbles they crawl, their claws clamped tight by thick rubber bands.;  
Always there, fun to look at. But these crustaceans are not for amusement like
fish in an aquarium. They are yours for steaming, cracking and eating -- the
ultimate shellfish.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     How long since you splurged on lobster at home? Have you ever?;   If the
answer is a long time or never, perhaps it was the cost or the logistics that
dissuaded you. But now is the time, because lobster season is in full swing.
Prices are as good as they're going to get. (This week, at selected Safeway
stores, live Maine lobsters are selling for $4.98 a pound.);   One-pound
lobsters, called chickens, are considered prime for individual servings of
whole lobster. Also desirable are 1 1/4-pounders, called quarters.;   And
following are Lobster Logistics: how to cook, crack and eat a lobster.;   To
cook lobster at home, try steaming instead of boiling. Maine lobster fishermen
prefer steaming because they say boiling can toughen the lobster and make the
meat soggy.;   Be prepared for an intense eating experience. In lobster
houses, bibs are standard equipment. Have lots of napkins on hand and be
prepared to eat with your fingers.;   How to steam a lobster;   Bring about an
inch of salted water to a boil in a pot large enough to hold lobsters. Place
lobsters (1 per serving) in pot, head first, and cover with lid. When water
returns to boil, add corn, allowing two ears for each serving. Steam lobsters
for 15 minutes, or until shells turn bright red and antennae pull out easily.
The corn should be done by then also. Serve with lots of melted butter.;   How
to eat lobsters;   First, twist off the large claws. Crack each claw with a
nutcracker, pliers, knife, hammer or rock. Separate the tail from the body by
arching the back until it cracks. Break off the tail flippers.;   Next, insert
a fork and push the tail meat out in one piece. Remove and discard the black
vein that runs the entire length of the tail.;   Then, unhinge the back shell
from the body. The green part in the body cavity is the "tomalley," which many
people consider the most delicious part of the lobster (it's the lobster's
liver -- some say it's not a good idea to eat more than one of these in a
day). The coral-colored roe is also edible.;   Finally, open the body by
cracking it apart sideways. Lobster meat lies in the four pockets (or joints)
where the small walking legs are attached. The small walking legs also contain
excellent meat that can be removed by sucking.;   Trivia;   From Ken Barnes,
captain of the schooner Stephen Taber, Rockland, Maine, who presides over a
weekly lobster roast for windjammer guests:;   "Lobsters' claws are bound with
rubber bands to keep them from hurting each other, not consumers. Because
lobsters are cannibalistic, their claws must be clamped shut to prevent them
from damaging each other during shipping.;   "The long narrow claw or 'thumb'
portion of each claw makes a perfect pick for getting to the meat in the body
and small walking legs of the lobster.";   From Peggy Dupont, Massachusetts
Lobstermen's Association:;   "Treat lobsters humanely by putting them in a
'trance' before they go into the pot. Rub on the underside of the tail for 30
to 40 seconds. When the lobster goes limp, quickly plunge it into the boiling
water head first. Add lobsters one at a time after water returns to boil."  </TEXT>
