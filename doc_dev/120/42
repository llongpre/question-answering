Does anybody remember the 12.5 million tomato seeds that were carried on the 
space shuttle Columbia in order to study the effects of long-term space 
exposure on living tissue? We just heard that school children in West 
Lafayette, Ind., were given some space-exposed seeds and raised tomatoes that 
were served in the school cafeteria. So what are they like? (And what about the 
remaining 12,499,900 space tomato seeds?)

A computer-operated machine can now form a protein coating around sausage, 
potentially making plastic or gut casings unnecessary. It's said that Natraskin 
is edible and doesn't split during cooking.

Vegetables such as beans and cabbage cause gas because they contain 
indigestible sugars that ferment in our digestive tracts. However, an enzyme 
called alpha-galactosidase will break these compounds down so they won't 
ferment, if you sprinkle a few drops of it on your first mouthful of the 
dangerous food. It should be available soon, under the elegant brand name Beano 
Drops, in the supermarket antacid section (meanwhile there's a Beano Hotline, 
800-257-8650). From Lactaid, Inc. of Pleasantville, N.J.

A couple of weeks back a Detroit man paid $320 for a 17 1/2-pound Maine 
lobster. It can take 100 years or so for a lobster to get that big, and Detroit 
animal rights activists picketed the restaurant and rang the diner's phone off 
the hook and offered to buy "Mimi" (as the news media had named the lobster) on 
the grounds that she was the equivalent of a historical building. It was to no 
avail -- Mimi died from injury and trauma in shipping, and so she got eaten 
after all. What all the Detroiters neglected to realize was that the best 
lobsters are the 1 1/2- to 2-pound size . . . the helpless infant size, that 
is.

White House Green

Broccoflower, the pale green cross between broccoli and cauliflower introduced 
this year, has been served at the White House. No word on whether the First 
Broccoli Hater liked it, but it's made the menu on two occasions.

Clearly, what the world needed was a card game for foodies, so here it is. 
Goulash is loosely based on Old Maid: You match cards containing the first and 
last parts of two-word dish names, and the card reading "goulash" is the card 
you don't want to get stuck with. The person who ends up with the Goulash card 
is, under the rules of the game, supposed to cook all the other players a 
dinner, but we'll see how often that happens. CHARLES PERRY
