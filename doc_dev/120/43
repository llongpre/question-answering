   President Bush signed legislation Tuesday
banning the import of undersized lobsters.
   The bill was backed by New England lawmakers who presented it
both as a conservation measure and as a way to protect U.S.
fishermen against Canadian competitors harvesting smaller lobsters.
   The lobster provision is contained in the $400 million
authorization bill for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sen.
William S. Cohen, R-Maine, first sponsored the provision after
Maine fishermen complained about Canadian competition.
   Fishermen argue that Canada's smaller minimum legal size of
lobsters has allowed Canadian fishermen to catch and sell smaller,
cheaper lobsters in U.S. markets.
   The legislation signed by Bush would place a market representing
roughly half of Candada's lobster exports off limits for the sale
of ``short'' lobsters.
   The current minimum legal size in the United States is 3\ inches
from the eye socket to the edge of the back where the tail begins.
The Canadian minimum is one-sixteenth of an inch smaller.
   Up to now, U.S. law has not regulated the size of imported
lobsters.
   In coming years, U.S. regulations would gradually increase the
minimum size of a lobster that could be caught in U.S. waters.
   Because Canada would not be bound by the increased minimum size
regulation, its fishermen could continue to deplete the harvest and
compete unfairly with their U.S. counterparts, lobster fishermen
argued.
