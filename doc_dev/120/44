   Lobstermen who staged a 10-day strike
to protest wholesale prices were back at work Tuesday after
receiving assurances dealers would pay more in the future.
   The fishermen went back to work Monday in a ``good faith'' deal
with buyers for future price increases, said David Cousens, a
representative of the Maine Lobstermen's Association.
   ``We were successful, but we paid for it dearly,'' Cousens said.
``But we put our point across and that's what we wanted to do. We
didn't want to drive dealers out of business.''
   Cousens estimated up to 400 lobster boats participated at one
time or another during the strike, which began Sept. 9 and ended
Monday. About 1,000 people have lobster-fishing licenses in the
affected area, the middle coast of Maine.
   Lobstermen staged the strike in hopes of raising the price paid
by dealers for lobster from $2.10 per pound to the $2.25 per pound
lobstermen to the north and south receive, said Edward Blackmore,
president of the Maine Lobstermen's Association.
   ``There's no signed agreements or anything, but it was
understood by the group involved they were going to go back and get
prices at the $2.25 level, which is what they thought they (needed
to) operate and make a living at,'' Blackmore said.
