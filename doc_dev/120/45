Hitler Ho used to be a regular caller to the late-night radio request
programme in Hong Kong. Wagon Lee, presumably a man with a penchant for the
overnight services of the European railway system, was a columnist on a
local paper.
Names are peculiar things. The gender of my own is often confused - once,
this led to being confined overnight in the women's cabin section of a
Swedish ferry.
So what about the name Olwyn? The very picture of Welsh womanhood.
Healthy-cheeked, leek-eating, daffodil-growing. Wind from the Beacons
blowing through blond hair. Chapel on Sunday evenings. Cardiff Arms Park
with the lads. Dylan Thomas. The Eisteddfod.
Not this Olwyn, though. Olwyn Weerasekara is a man. A native of that magical
but, sadly, strife-filled island of Sri Lanka. He is also keeper of one of
the world's more unusual restaurants.
'I think maybe my father had a Welsh girlfriend once and decided I should
commemorate her,' says Olwyn. The name has never bothered him. He gets on
with what he knows best - cooking and sharing drinks and chat with
customers.
Olwyn's - or the Beach Wadiya restaurant - is on the open-sided
three-wheeler. Turn off the main road going south. Go down a dusty,
pot-holed track towards the sea. Take a left. A few desultory fairy lights
blink in the distance. 'Olwyn's,' says the driver. You stop and make sure
there are no hoots from oncoming locomotives.
The Beach Wadiya is on the other side of the railway tracks, perched on a
strip of sand between the trains and the sea. Levering the flesh out of a
crab claw might be interrupted by the very close rumble of the southern
express.
Olwyn's speciality is lobster. Lots of them. Grilled, poached, fried - with
butter and garlic, with chilli, with curry. Colombo's aficionados ring
beforehand to place their orders. Then, they know they can be sure of
Olwyn's personal touch in the cooking.
Later, being partial to a drink or two, Olwyn tends to be pre-occupied
elsewhere, mainly in the cut and thrust of intellectual conversation at
various tables littered round the sand. 'What is life for but to enjoy a few
fragile moments like this?' he says. The train goes past, making the
restaurant - and life - seem very fragile.
'Of course, people come here for the food, but it's not just that - it's
more for the, how shall I say . . .' His verbal meanderings are interrupted
by a slight hubbub at one table. A coconut has dropped from a tree, nearly
flattening the bald-headed diner underneath.
With commendable sang-froid, Olwyn waves at the rather startled gathering
and tells the waiter to take a jug of the local coconut toddy across.
'Nothing like good, strong toddy for putting the world right,' he says, with
a sharp slap of the thigh and a hearty roar of laughter.
The lobsters arrive. Two of them, stretching across the table. But I am not
allowed to eat. First, I have to examine the weighty books of customers'
comments.
Sample: 'I am from the USA. I have not eaten yet. But look forward to my
prawns. I hope on my next visit I can write in your guest book again and
tell you how good the food was or was not. Regards, RM Schwartz.'
Schwartz has no other entry. Perhaps the prawns were not up to scratch. More
likely, the toddy froze his literary abilities. Or he was brained by a stray
coconut.
I crack a lobster claw, but Olwyn wants to show me the pictures. A group of
very red-faced diners. 'The England cricket team - they all came here and
stayed till very late. We even had some bowling on the beach.'
Perhaps googlies go better with toddy.
'Olwyn, I really must get back to my lobster.'
'All in good time. Life should not be rushed. Now look at these pictures.'
Olwyn is a fan of the late Elvis. So, he had an Elvis lookalike competition
at Beach Wadiya. It was one of the highpoints of the restaurant's existence.
Lobster, toddy and rock-a-hula-baby.
A frisson of excitement runs among the tables. Sri Lanka is playing host to
Miss World Tourism. Several of the girls have found their way to Olwyn's.
Each one of them 6ft tall, most of it legs.
Olwyn jumps like one of his crustaceans on the way to the griddle. 'So
honoured ladies. Of course we have room.'
There is only one table with space. Mine - at present occupied only by two
sadly neglected lobsters.
On one side, Miss Poland. On the other, Miss Latvia.
'Kieran? But that is a girl's name, yes?' says Miss Poland, in a tone that
brooks no contradictory opinion.
'Olwyn?' says Miss Latvia. 'That is a very sweet name. It is a Sri Lankan
name, no?'
Olwyn waves for more toddy. The train goes past. The lobsters do a Fred
Astaire on the table.
'We will eat your lobsters,' says the long legs from Warsaw.
'You are so kind,' says the twinkling Miss Latvia to Olwyn.
