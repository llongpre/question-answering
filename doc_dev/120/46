   In life and death, thousands of pounds
of Atlantic herring have been eating up the oxygen in Block
Island's Old Harbor _ and stinking up the local lobster industry.
   Local officials Wednesday sought state help for lobstermen who
lost an undetermined amount of catch when the herring depleted the
small harbor's oxygen supply. About 10-15 commercial lobstermen
operate from the harbor.
   Restaurants on the tourism-dependent island also lost lobsters
stored in tanks that circulate harbor water.
   Andrew Hunt, an aide to Lt. Gov. Roger Begin, said he was trying
to arrange relief funds or low-interest loans for those affected.
   Experts believe a large school of small fish entered the
harbor's inner basin, on the island's east side, on June 4.
   ``What we think happened is a school of Atlantic herring
possibly was chased into the basin in the Old Harbor area by
predators. It could be bluefish or striped bass,'' said Joseph
Migliore, a scientist with the state Department of Environmental
Management.
   The small fish has a fast metabolism and consumes a lot of
oxygen. The school, estimated to weigh 15,000 to 50,000 pounds,
apparently overwhelmed the seven-acre basin and its oxygen supply.
   Such fish kills are relatively common in enclosed bodies of
water. But Block Islanders can't remember such a large kill on
their isolated dot 12 miles off the Rhode Island coast.
   ``As far as I know, and I've talked to people who've been
fishing out of that harbor all their lives, 15 to 30 years, this
has never happened,'' said Chris Littlefield, harbor master for New
Shoreham, the island's only town.
   First Warden Edward McGovern, New Shoreham's equivalent of a
mayor, said the smell got really bad last week, but is improving.
   As the fish began dying, lobstermen collected about 50 barrels
for bait. But most of the dead fish sank to the bottom and began to
rot _ further depleting the oxygen.
   Unsuspecting lobstermen left their catch in cages filled with
harbor water _for storage until shipment to market _ and some think
the lobsters suffocated.
   Lobsters in restaurant tanks suffered similar fates. At least
some eateries were seeking an alternative storing method until the
harbor oxygen is restored.
   Experts could not estimate the extent of the damage or predict
when the harbor would return to normal.
   Littlefield said some of the dead fish were beginning to be
swept out with the tide, but most were staying on the bottom.
