FISHERMEN SAY ENCINITAS REFUGE WOULD DEVASTATE THEM

Randy Miller has been a commercial fisherman for a quarter of a century, plying 
his trade up and down the North County coast in his 26-foot boat, the Seaway. 
</P>
<P>
It is not an easy business. Even with tricks of the trade gleaned from years on 
the water, Miller wages a constant battle to keep fiscally afloat. There are 
the whims of the weather, problems with poachers and the perpetual toll of the 
elements on boat and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Now comes a new challenge. Little more than a week ago, state legislation was 
introduced that would create a marine refuge along a half-mile strip of 
coastline in Encinitas, effectively putting it off-limits to commercial and 
sport fishermen, as well as divers looking for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ecologically Rich Area 
</P>
<P>
The bill, written by Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas) and championed 
by city officials, is designed to protect in perpetuity the ecologically rich 
area, prohibiting the harvest of all manner of marine life from the tide pools 
to a mile offshore. 
</P>
<P>
Miller, however, sees the proposal as yet another shot across the bow of his 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the best fishing reef in North County, bar none, absolute, period," 
Miller, president of the Southern California Lobster Fisherman's Assn., said 
one recent day. "It's a mortal blow to local fishermen. It would be 
devastating." 
</P>
<P>
The unfriendly reception the legislation has received from local fishermen, who 
promise to fight the bill to the end, has taken Encinitas officials as well as 
Mojonnier by surprise. The proposal has been in the works since mid-1988 and, 
until now, no one had uttered a word of disapproval, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nothing we've hidden. This thing is months and months old," said David 
Wigginton, the city's community services director. "I think the fishermen have 
to look out for their interests, and I'm sure their concerns will be heard. . . 
. The intent wasn't to jeopardize anyone's welfare, the intent was to preserve 
an area of coastline for all people to enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
The legislation would establish an ocean sanctuary stretching south from D 
Street at Moonlight Beach to the southern edge of Swami's, a popular surfing 
spot noted for an extensive reef system that stretches well beyond the 
breakers. 
</P>
<P>
A rugged ocean outcropping, the reef serves as a feeding ground for a wide 
array of fish, and harbors perhaps the most abundant crop of lobster north of 
La Jolla Cove, which is already designated a marine refuge. Moreover, the tide 
pools that appear as the ocean recedes each day play host to sea anemones, 
crabs, sea cucumbers and other flora and fauna of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"At low tide it's beautiful," Wigginton said. "There's everything imaginable 
out there. You don't see the same things twice." 
</P>
<P>
The bill was sparked by Encinitas City Councilman Gerald Steel, who pushed 
through a unanimous resolution in July, asking that the sanctuary be 
established. Steel has since moved to Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
Given his marching orders, Wigginton approached Mojonnier's office with the 
idea. State Department of Fish and Game officials were consulted, and they 
advised the assemblywoman that the quickest avenue to secure a refuge would be 
through the Legislature instead of the cumbersome bureaucratic process. 
</P>
<P>
State law protects about three dozen ocean sanctuaries. While the zones are 
open for scientific and recreational purposes, they are off-limits to fishermen 
and divers, with a strict look-but-don't-take rule enforced. 
</P>
<P>
Vernon Goehring, the DFG's legislative coordinator, said the agency has yet to 
take a position on Mojonnier's bill, but suggested that the region off 
Encinitas is not a unique habitat nor does it play host to a specific plant or 
animal threatened by extinction. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Endangered Species 
</P>
<P>
"There's no particular species that's endangered there," Goehring said. "I'm 
not saying protection of tide pools isn't important, but it isn't to a point 
where there is an endangered species that is native only to that particular 
location." 
</P>
<P>
Mia Tegner, a marine ecologist with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 
La Jolla, said she is unfamiliar with the spot under consideration, but 
supports the concept of marine refuges as a way of protecting the fragile ocean 
ecosystem. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the general idea of reserves is a good one," she said. "It would be 
nice to take my grandchildren out and show them what an abalone looks like." 
</P>
<P>
Tegner noted, however, that the sector "may well be the North County hot spot" 
for fishermen, meaning the anglers have "a legitimate gripe here." 
</P>
<P>
"If fishermen say they have to have every square inch of coast, it's one thing, 
but if they say this particular spot is a source of livelihood, it's another," 
Tegner said. 
</P>
<P>
Local fishermen, meanwhile, make no bones about it -- the stretch of ocean off 
central Encinitas is the prime ocean acreage for anglers and lobster men in 
North County. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Would Be a Disaster' 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of guys who make their living off Swami's," said John Guth, a 
lobster fisherman for more than 20 years. "This would be a disaster for us. 
We've already had so many closures. If they take another, there's just not 
going to be that much there." 
</P>
<P>
Jack Perdew, a lobster fisherman out of Oceanside Harbor, agreed. "I would rate 
it one of the best, if not the best," he said. "I hope the thing doesn't go 
through. I'm sorry that our legislators don't have the courtesy of checking 
with the people it would most affect." 
</P>
<P>
Miller, a third-generation Encinitas resident and chief spokesman for the local 
lobster fishermen, suggested that the key flaw of the proposal is that it 
underestimates the ability of the ocean to renew itself when properly handled. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got to ask why we are saving it," Miller argued. "Just to look at? The 
ocean is renewable if we manage it properly. It can serve the fisherman and the 
general public. To have it for one interest group is like saying the rest of us 
aren't good enough. . . . It's kind of utopian. They want to create a private 
pond off the city." 
</P>
<P>
As a child, Miller lived with his family on the bluff overlooking Swami's. He 
recalls the days when a small wooden wharf extended from the rocky point. 
Miller grew up with fishermen all around. Later, he became a surfer, but turned 
to fishing for his livelihood when he realized his skills on a board would not 
put bread on the table. 
</P>
<P>
He recalls years past when the lobster population off the coast had dwindled to 
record lows. A fisherman could throw as many traps as he'd like into the water, 
but the things would generally come up empty. The area was all but fished out. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Young Ones Can Escape 
</P>
<P>
In recent years, lobster have rebounded, most notably because of new traps that 
allow the younger and smaller crustaceans, which will grow into next year's 
whoppers, to escape through a portal in the steel mesh, he said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the past six years have been very good, said Miller, who also 
fishes for shark, sea bass, yellowtail and other fish after the close of 
lobster season, which begins the first Wednesday in October and lasts more than 
five months. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know how we'll fight it," Miller said. "We'll probably have to go up 
to Sacramento and deal with it there. It's not something that we haven't had to 
do before." 
</P>
<P>
Such talk aside, room for compromise may remain. 
</P>
<P>
Wigginton said his impression of the original intent of the proposal is that it 
primarily sought to protect the tidal areas off Encinitas. By spreading the 
refuge boundaries a mile out to sea, the legislation may have unintentionally 
snared the fishermen. 
</P>
<P>
"If a mile is too far out, maybe we can negotiate it back in," he said. "But 
not having heard the concerns of those parties firsthand, it's hard to say what 
direction any action might take." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Heiserman, an administrative assistant to Mojonnier, said the 
assemblywoman's staff was unaware of the fishermen's concern before introducing 
the legislation, but would be happy to arrange a meeting with all parties 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly want to hear these people out," Heiserman said. "If they've got a 
legitimate beef, we'll want to put that on the scale, too."
