   Almost 100 Vietnamese fishermen in Boston Harbor,
all former boat people, say they face the loss of their livelihood
this week because of new restrictions on their gill-net fishing
methods.
   But the lobstermen who lobbied the state to enact the new rules
say that it was their livelihood that was threatened by the fishing
method used by the Vietnamese.
   The dispute has led to tension between the two sides, including
one incident in which a lobsterman brandished gun at a Vietnamese
fisherman, the Vietnamese said.
   At issue are restrictions that went into effect this week on the
use in Boston Harbor of gill nets, which are set upright in the
water to catch fish by entangling their gills in their meshes.
Lobstermen said too many lobsters were being caught up in the nets.
   Alex Farent, head of the Boston Lobsterman's Association, said
that ``if in any way this new regulation is not complied with, we
will kiss our livelihoods goodbye. That's it.''
   But to the Vietnamese fishermen, who began fishing in the area
last fall, losing their right to do so comes as an especially cruel
blow. Most of them grew up around boats in Vietnam, and fishing is
their only real skill, said Mai T. Thoi, one of the few of the
fishermen who speaks English.
   ``The state government didn't consider our need to make a
living,'' said Thoi. ``If this regulation continues, there's no way
we can continue our way of life. We are now in an emergency
situation. We need a miracle.''
   Thoi and representatives of the lobstermen met with state
officials Monday, and Thoi was unable to persuade state officials
to relent.
   James Fair, assistant director of the Division of Marine
Fisheries, said gill-net fishing within Boston Harbor is allowed
during the winter, but lobsters often get tangled up in the gill
nets during the summer catch.
   The new regulations were initiated because a valuable resource,
lobsters, is in ``great danger,'' he said. Fair also said that the
Vietnamese, who are not licensed to catch lobsters, have sometimes
retrieved them in their nets.
   Before the rules went into effect, the Vietnamese fished within
three miles of the harbor. Now they must take their boats out about
10 miles into deep water, which they say is too dangerous with
their aging vessels.
   Fair also said the state wanted to stop the conflict between the
Vietnamese and the lobstermen before the tension escalated.
   Three weeks ago, Thoi said, several Vietnamese fishermen
reported being harassed and threatened by local lobstermen.
   Tung Phan, 21, a crew member on one of the boats, said Monday
that a lobsterman had pulled his boat near Phan's boat one day and
showed a knife, yelling at the crew members to ``get out.'' During
another incident, a lobsterman pulled a gun out and brandished it
from his boat, Phan said.
   ``It's ironic,'' said Thoi. ``We had to flee here and we were
trying to survive and now they're not letting us survive.''
   Fair said that state officials ``recognize that they were able
to fish like that in Vietnam, but they have to realize that the
same techniques are not compatible with the way they do things in
Boston Harbor.''
   Thoi said the fishermen hope to continue their fight to be
allowed to fish in the harbor. He said, however, that ``we will
respect the law.''
