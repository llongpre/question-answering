   A 25-pound lobster with claws the size of
baseball mitts that was saved from becoming an Easter dinner
arrived in Maine on Monday on the final leg of a roundabout journey
back to the sea.
   Maine marine officials gently placed ``Shirley,'' a male
estimated at 40 to 125 years, and a 19}-pound companion lobster
into a 600-gallon tub of icy saltwater after their flight from
Philadelphia. Freed from their ice-packed travel boxes, the
lobsters immediately began moving their giant claws around.
   ``Very good, he's moving around already. That's a good sign,''
Col. Robert Fogg, chief of the Bureau of Marine Patrol of the Maine
Department of Marine Resources, said of Shirley. ``A real weak
lobster would be very lifeless.
   ``They're excellent. I'm pleased with the way they've shown up.''
   Marine officials planned to return the crustacean behemoths to
the Atlantic early Tuesday off Cape Elizabeth if they remained
healthly overnight.
   ``This is symbolic of what we're trying to do and what citizens
are trying to do for a natural, sustainable resource,'' Fogg said.
``By protecting these large lobsters, there's more of a chance of
them reproducing'' and perpetuating the industry.
   Maine law protects lobsters with body shells longer than five
inches, covering lobsters larger than 4 to 5 pounds.
   If the lobsters' health deteriorated during the night and they
could not be saved, Lt. Joseph Fessenden of the Maine Bureau of
Marine Patrol said the largest would be turned over to the Maine
State Museum.
   ``They're looking for a lobster to stuff,'' he said.
   Shirley and the companion lobster had been trucked to
Philadelphia from Long Island, N.Y., and sold for $287. After
crustacean rights advocates took up the cause, Kevin Hill, owner of
Hill's Main Line Seafood Co. in the suburb of Ardmore, persuaded
the buyer to take 45 pounds of smaller lobsters instead.
   Hill put the lobsters in a window tank for the rest of their
visit to Philadelphia's Main Line. He acknowledged that saving
lobsters from dinner palates was something new for him, ``which is
all right.''
   He also said that the lobsters had been good business, as
thousands of peole dropped by for a look at Shirley.
   ``It's been very good for business. If they don't buy now, at
least they know where we are,'' said Hill, who planned to travel to
Maine to be on hand for the lobsters' release into the Atlantic.
   Hill delayed packing the lobsters for their trip until the last
possible minute. ``Believe it or not, I'm still getting people
coming by the window to look at 'em,'' he said Monday.
   Pity Not Cruelty Inc., a small animal rights group, made
arrangements with Maine officials to turn the creatures loose and
assumed the $40 flight cost.
   If it seems to be a lot of fuss over a couple of lobsters, group
vice president Gloria Felscher-Cohen makes no apologies.
   ``Why not? These two lobsters have survived hazards,
particularly Shirley, over 100 years,'' she said. ``Why should she
need to succumb to the cruelest predator of all, man?''
