KENNEBUNKPORT, Me. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Until George Bush began strolling through his hometown as a presidential 
candidate, about the last thing of note that had happened here was the 
Historical Society's recovery of the old fog bell from Goat Island lighthouse a 
few miles offshore in the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
If you include being totally wiped out by Indians in 1689, Kennebunkport has 
been home to a few historic events since its founding in 1653. Yet during its 
300-plus years it has hardly been a Lexington or Concord. 
</P>
<P>
Farming, fishing and sawmills along inland streams and the Kennebunk River were 
the first economic activities. But by the beginning of the 19th Century the 
shipbuilding industry was turning out 100 vessels a year. 
</P>
<P>
During the first half of the 19th Century, those affluent shipbuilders began 
putting up impressive homes in Greek Revival, Federal, Colonial and, later, 
Victorian styles. So in addition to being a lively summer resort, the little 
village has that old-fashioned, lived-in look of a New England seaside town. 
</P>
<P>
But good times or bad, one thing Kennebunkport has had going for it is natural 
beauty, sited as it is at the mouth of the Kennebunk River near the Atlantic's 
Cape Porpoise Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
Any way you look at it, President Bush's forebears were pretty smart folks to 
have settled here. 
</P>
<P>
To get here: Fly Delta, TWA or Continental to Portland, Me., with changes. From 
there it's 30 minutes by car or bus on to Kennebunkport. 
</P>
<P>
How long/how much? You can do the town's sights in a day, but with water 
sports, antique shopping and perhaps a bit of fishing, give it several days. 
Accommodations are moderately priced, up a notch for the summer season. Dining 
well is also moderate. 
</P>
<P>
A few fast facts: The busy season is from mid-June until mid-October. And a 
trolley makes the rounds of many hotels and the mid-village shopping area for a 
50-cent ticket. 
</P>
<P>
Getting settled in: Nonantum-Portside Resort (Ocean Avenue; $80 to $125 double) 
has a main hotel that is more than a century old, plus the new Portside also in 
traditional style but with water views from every room. There's a private 
marina, heated pool, tennis and golf nearby. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms in the newly restored main hotel are comfortably old-fashioned and 
freshly painted with wicker furniture, TVs and pretty flowered walls. Most of 
the Portside rooms have their own balcony with trim white banisters. The dining 
room has a good selection of seafood, pretty straightforward thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
The Welby Inn (Ocean Avenue; $60-$80 B&amp;B double) was built in 1900 by a 
prosperous sea captain. Seven rooms have handmade bedspreads, hooked-rag rugs, 
samplers on walls and flowers all over. Your breakfasts might consist of fresh 
fruit, eggs to order, apple-walnut bread, blueberry muffins and lots of tea or 
coffee. This charmer is owned and operated by the Knox family and is very 
popular, so write ahead for reservations. 
</P>
<P>
The Inn at Goose Rocks (Dyke Road; $75-$105 double) is just outside town in a 
wooded setting overlooking saltwater marshes and near Goose Rocks Beach. The 
inn's 32 guest rooms are spread out in a traditional building, many of the 
rooms with four-posters. There's a pub lounge, deck area, pleasant library with 
plenty of books and a fireplace. The dining room has a blue-nautical motif, 
attractive stenciling on walls and good food and service. 
</P>
<P>
Shawmut Inn (Turbot's Creek Road; $90-$150 double) is right by the ocean, a 
huge complex built in 1913 with a main building, several other large ones and a 
clutch of separate cottages. A recreational director sees after things around 
the Olympic-size saltwater pool, volleyball, shuffleboard, jazz concerts on 
Sunday. All meals served, and a van takes you to and from the port area in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
Regional food and drink: You haven't really lived until you've dug into a fresh 
Maine lobster, the world's best, with a side of "steamers" (soft clams), corn 
on the cob and a bowl of slaw. These are the basics of a beachside clambake, 
but many restaurants also serve them. In addition to the steamers you may find 
quahogs, a mud-loving clam that makes great chowder. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the lobster-clam headliners, look for sweet shrimp and scallops, 
baked, broiled or deep-fried. You might also scan menus for fresh ocean perch, 
pollack, cod, halibut, haddock, sole and shad roe in the spring. Nowhere will 
you find a greater variety of fresh seafood. 
</P>
<P>
Fruits show up in such favorites as apple crisps and apple pandowdy, blueberry 
and strawberry tarts and cobblers. Injun pudding is sure to destroy your daily 
calorie count, a heavy affair made of molasses, cornmeal, milk, sugar, butter 
and whatever seasonings the cook has on hand. 
</P>
<P>
Good dining: Cafe Topher (Lower Harbor Village) couldn't be prettier, a 
downstairs pub with piano music, upstairs a lovely room with crisp pink linens, 
pink flowers, etched-glass dividers and a grand piano. 
</P>
<P>
Lobster fettuccini heads the list of numerous seafood dishes, several steaks 
and chicken entrees for landlubbers. The dessert menu promises homemade fruit 
pies "often," cherries jubilee "never." 
</P>
<P>
The Lobster Pot (Mills Road, Cape Porpoise) always has a steady crowd of locals 
willing to take the three-mile ride out there for simple decor, paper napkins, 
ceiling fans and unadorned fresh seafood. Choose your live lobster from the 
tank: $10.95 for a one-pounder, $16.95 for two. Most folks also go for the 
steamers at $5.85. You may start with clam or fish chowder, rich lobster stew. 
</P>
<P>
Seascapes (Cape Porpoise Pier) is a really lovely restaurant right over the 
water, with pastel pottery and lots of flowers highlighting the attractive 
decor. It has a small bar and marvelous views of the water in one of Maine's 
prettiest fishing villages. 
</P>
<P>
The menu reaches out with the likes of shrimp a la turkolimani, sauteed with 
fresh tomatoes and feta cheese; scallops sauteed with arugula and lime pesto; 
lobster braised in Drambuie cream; Maine crab cakes with tomato-rosemary sauce. 
</P>
<P>
On your own: Eighteenth- and 19th-Century architecture buffs will have a field 
day here, with the Greek-Revival Nott House, White Columns, being the town 
showpiece. Built in 1853, it still has original wallpapers, carpets and 
furnishings. A tour of this one is a must. 
</P>
<P>
Summer Street has a line of beautiful homes of the last two centuries, and the 
1826 Wedding Cake House, built by a sea captain, is extraordinary in the true 
sense of the word. 
</P>
<P>
Sixteen antique shops in a small town are enough to set any antiquarian 
atwitter, so comb them for pewter, pine furniture, duck decoys, silver, 
scrimshaw, country cupboards and whatever else you absolutely need. 
</P>
<P>
Feisty striped bass draw fishermen to the mouth of the Kennebunk and Mousam 
rivers, while the deep-sea types head out on party boats for cod, mackerel, 
tuna and anything else biting in the Atlantic that day. 
</P>
<P>
And in this friendliest of all small towns, almost every hotel or inn has free 
bicycles to loan you, so strike out down the road and start meeting 
Kennebunkporters. You might even run into you-know-who taking a stroll. 
</P>
