   Stone crab fans waited for the season's first
catches of the Gulf of Mexico's top crustacean like wine lovers
yearning for the year's first Beaujolais nouveau or New Englanders
watching for leaves to turn color.
   ``It's sweet, it's delicious, it's flaky - it's a legal
narcotic,'' said Ron Goldstein, executive vice president of the
East Coast Fisheries market and restaurant, holding up the rich
meat from one of the first crab claws available during the Oct.
15-to-May 15 season. ``That's why people get all excited.''
   Maine has its lobster and Maryland its blue-claw crabs, but
people here swear stone crabs taste better.
   Dick McDaniel, who runs seafood operations at Joe's Stone Crab
in Miami Beach, said diet makes the difference.
   ``Blue crabs eat garbage meat - the rottener it is, the
better,'' McDaniel explained. ``But stone crabs are very
persnickety. They must eat the Rolls-Royce of baits: fresh fish
heads.''
   Joe's has been serving up the tasty critters since 1913 and now
serves up a ton of cold claws each night - 400,000 pounds a year -
at $24.95 for little more than a pound of meat.
   In the early days at Joe's - when Miami Beach was little more
than a sandbar with a bathhouse - writer Damon Runyon once observed
that a man could dip his foot in Biscayne Bay and come up with a
crab hanging from each toe.
   Now stone crabs roam mostly along Florida's Gulf coast. About
300 professional crabbers work the waters from the Keys to Panama
City, taking more than 2.5 million pounds of crab claws each
season, according to the state Department of Natural Resources.
   The crabs aren't killed, though. Crabbers, hauling in hundreds
of traps each day, remove a claw at a time from the crabs before
tossing them back into the sea, where they regenerate their lost
limbs in the off-season.
   ``We're taking something off a live animal without killing or
destroying him. We're doing something right with the harvesting,''
McDaniel said.
   The claws are quickly hauled off the boats and boiled before
being iced down.
   So eager was Monty's Stone Crab restaurant in Miami to start
serving the claws this year that it hired a helicopter to fly them
in from the Gulf on Monday night. Their competition used trucks to
cross the Everglades and couldn't serve fresh claws until the next
day.
   Tourism officials see the start of each season as a sign that
the summer doldrums are ending.
   ``We're already getting phone calls. We can start to feel the
quickening pace at just about the same time stone crabs debut,''
said Mary Louise English, spokeswoman for the Greater Miami
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
   Not all people see the start of stone crab season as a glorious
event, however.
   For Sheri Ashcraft, an admissions adviser at Barry University
and a native Floridian, it's a sign that Miami's clogged roads are
about to get even harder to navigate.
   ``It's like `Attack of the Rental Cars.' You see their tags and
they're always right in front of you, going 10 mph,'' she joked.
``The restaurants are more full. People suddenly appear in
snow-white skin, with the wild shorts and zinc oxide on their
noses.''
