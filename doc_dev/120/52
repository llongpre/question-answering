<LEADPARA>  THE backstage drama for "The Adventures of Alice" rivals the rehearsals in
complexity, the cast in number of personnel and Lewis Carroll's books in
imagination.;    Behind the rehearsal hall is San Jose Dance Theater's costume
shop, where three enterprising women direct a mutable, motley crew of parents
and student dancers in constructing 160 elaborate costumes for the production.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The costumes were designed by Shawn Stuart, associate artistic director of
SJDT. But the real work of making them has been done by costume mistress Kathy
Koon and two assistants, Coleen Kubota and Eileen Jimenez, who are sisters.;  
 Koon has been involved with San Jose Dance Theater for about eight years; her
daughter graduated from the company last year.;    Kubota has two dancers in
"Alice": Laura, 12, a lobster, and Karen, 8, a joker in the pack of cards and
a king's horseman. Jimenez also has two, Teresa, 11, a lobster, and Elena, 9,
a pinion in the Jabberwock's wing.;    Koon, Kubota and Jimenez all know how
to handle a sewing machine, but their real skill is in problem-solving. It's
up to them to break down the process of making the costumes into small enough
units that workers of any level of skill can do them.;    Here, a mother has
been assigned to cut a bolt of felt into long strips; there, a father glues
felt to the frame of a hat. More experienced workers are given more exacting
tasks: shaping unbleached muslin to the wire frame for the dragon's head;
stenciling intricate designs onto the red felt sandwich-style tunics worn by
the deck of cards.;    As Kubota is giving a tour of the assembly line, a
teen-age dancer bundled up in a sweater and leg-warmers comes out of rehearsal
and says: "Is there anything you need help with? 'Cause I've got two hours."
She is handed an iron and a heap of wrinkled blue chiffon, which will become
part of Alice's pool of tears.;    For this production, Kubota explains, most
of the costumes are made of felt because it's relatively cheap and easy to
work with. It doesn't have to be hemmed, and the flat colors are those of
story-book illustrations.;    The real headache for "Alice" is that so much
material had to be hand-dyed. "You just can't go out and buy
jabberwocky-colored fabric," said Kubota, indicating a pile of leprous green
stuff starred with yellow tie-dyed blotches. This will become the armor of the
dragon in "Jabberwocky.";    Some of the costumes are ingenious theater
pieces. The rosebushes in the Queen of Hearts' garden, for instance, wear
puff-sleeved green tunics with big white chiffon flowers. When the queen's
gardeners come through and paint all the roses red, the rosebushes simply
switch their white blossoms for red ones -- thanks to the magic of Velcro.;   
Kubota drags out four 6-foot-long cardboard packing cartons, the kind in which
florists pack live plants, to show off the piece de resistance of the costume
shop: the lobsters, whose four-part outfits include tunics, huge claws,
jointed tails and hoods with cowl collars, all in cream-of-tomato-soup-red
felt.;    Anyone who's ever reupholstered a chair knows how the antennae are
made: cut on the bias and stuffed by working a cord through the casing. The
lobsters' big gold eyes are painted wooden eggs. And the claws are like big
muffs, stiffened with boat-cushion foam rubber.;    "You're looking at about
200 hours of work spent on 16 costumes," she says proudly.  </TEXT>
