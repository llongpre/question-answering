<HEAD>Bear Paw Prints May Rub Out Lobsters on Maine Plates</HEAD>

   Red lobsters once adorned Maine license
plates. Now there's talk of stamping them out with a bear paw
print.
   The University of Maine Alumni Association wants to persuade the
Legislature to approve an idea to reward university supporters with
vanity license plates bearing some likeness of the school mascot.
   ``As a schmaltzy alumni director, I'd like to see a black bear
or bear paw print,'' said H. Maxwell Burry, executive director of
the association.
   The suggestion comes months after the Legislature approved a
bill allowing motorists to obliterate the red lobster now on Maine
tags, so long as the numbers and letters stay intact.
   Some people think the likeness of the lobster crawling across
Maine plates since 1987 gives the wrong impression that Maine is a
place for the rich.
   The school's alumni would be able to get the vanity plates by
paying an extra fee, which would go back to the alumni association.
The university trustees will consider the bear paw proposal Monday.
