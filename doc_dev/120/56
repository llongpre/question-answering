Bonifacio Guenechea is a very generous man and has some very special cooking 
ware. I first met Boni only a few months back when I borrowed three of his pans 
to cook at a benefit beach party for cystic fibrosis at my brother's home in 
the Florida Keys. Boni's pans (he calls them magic pans) are giant paella pans 
that come with their own butane burner and tripod, and are perfect for cooking 
for a crowd. With three of them, I cooked beef, chicken and Florida lobster for 
250 people in just over an hour. 
</P>
<P>
My brother called again last month, "Hey how about coming down and cooking for 
the Florida Keys Fishing Guides Assn.? They do a lot of conservation work and 
they are gonna be doin' a fund-raiser and thought maybe you'd help out. Whadda 
ya say! Maybe we could use Boni's pans again." 
</P>
<P>
I called Boni. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," he replied, "you can use 'em. How many will ya be cookin' for?" 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure," I said, "maybe 200, maybe 400." 
</P>
<P>
"Tell ya what," he said, "I'll come down and help ya. I'll bring my big pan. We 
can do paella." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Paella's Spanish History 
</P>
<P>
Boni's big pan is almost 4 feet in diameter and 6 inches deep -- big enough to 
cook paella for about 150 people at a time. Two batches was all it took. As we 
stood around his pan stirring, Boni told me a bit about the world-famous dish 
from his native Spain. 
</P>
<P>
Paella gets its name from the pan it is cooked in. The pan is the paella. The 
dish can be made from a variety of different ingredients, meat, fish, poultry 
or a combination. The only ingredients that are traditionally used are olive 
oil, rice and saffron. Boni said he sometimes uses yellow food coloring in 
place of the very expensive saffron, "but it's not nearly as good." He also 
said that you don't have to have the traditional paella, you can make it in any 
casserole dish, "but it's not quite the same." 
</P>
<P>
Paella can be simple, inexpensive family fare with chicken and pork, or elegant 
festive fare with lobster and stone crab. Either way, it's fun food. Boni sent 
me the following recipes to document paella's versatility.
