<HEAD>Pilot Makes Emergency Landing With 400 Lobsters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A single-engine plane carrying 400 live lobsters
made an emergency landing Friday in a park outside a prison.
   Pilot Carsten Petersen said his Cessna 206 developed engine
trouble west of London while flying from the Outer Hebrides islands
off Scotland to Le Touquet in northern France.
   He was cleared to make an emergency landing at Heathrow Airport,
but the engine problem forced him to land on the first open terrain
he could find: a recreation ground behind Wormwood Scrubs prison in
west London.
   The 46-year-old pilot and his cargo of crustaceans were
unscathed, but the plane cannot be removed without taking off its
wings, and Petersen said the lobsters were unlikely to continue
their journey to French gourmet restaurants.
   ``The lobsters are sick of flying,'' he said.
   Their reprieve was only temporary, however. The dealer who
arranged the flight is diverting the shellfish to London
restaurants, and a colleague was dispatched to pick them up.
   ``If you go into a good London restaurant you might get one,''
Petersen said.
