   A lobster who escaped the jaws of death when a
woman couldn't bring herself to eat him has found a home at the
Henry Doorly Zoo.
   The 24-pound crustacean called Clyde was the prize in a January
supermarket promotion, but the contest winner decided against making
a meal out of him and the Omaha zoo took him temporarily.
   A Clyde the Lobster Zoo Fund helped raise some $5,000 money to
keep the lobster in Omaha. At one point a man dressed as a lobster
stood on a downtown street corner and asked for donations, and a
radio station held a 28-hour fund-raising broadcast.
   Clyde was unveiled in his 240-gallon, $6,300 saltwater tank
Thursday. The zoo opens its 1989 season today.
   ``Everything appears to be fine,'' aquarium supervisor Kathy
Vires said. ``He eats, he's active, he keeps his tail tucked. Those
are all signs of a healthy lobster.''
   Zoo employees sometimes find him standing on his tail with his
claws open and extending above the top of his tank, she said.
   Zoo Director Lee Simmons said the zoo would like to establish a
larger cold-water exhibit. But for now, Clyde is the only cold-water
creature on display.

   Legislators often are accused of dealing
with pork in the budget, but pigs were among the few barnyard
animals absent from the Statehouse for National Agriculture Day.
   Cows, calves, goats, kids, ducklings and a turkey were among the
animals displayed on the Statehouse lawn Thursday.
   Inside the Capitol, people gathered in the Rotunda to sample free
West Virginia-grown products, including apples, country ham,
marinated chicken, potato chips, beef jerky and white and chocolate
milk.
   Outside, a barnyard aroma wafted through the air as hundreds of
kindergarten and preschoolers strolled around pens of live animals.
   ``We're doing it because it's fun,'' Agriculture Commissioner
Cleve Benedict said. ``It's fun for us and it's fun for the kids.
And it's all educational.
   ``You know, some youngsters, even growing up in a rural state
like West Virginia, live in a city like Charleston and think eggs
come from the ... store. They've never had a chance to pet a goat,
for instance.''
