<LEADPARA>  The latest in food rages in Japan is to eat fish live -- flounder that flop on
the plate, finger-length eel swallowed raw. And remember, if the shrimp don't
dance, send them back.;    "The food moves around a lot -- that's the whole
idea," said Sunao Uehara, a chef at Chunagon, one of Tokyo's most expensive
nightspots.  </LEADPARA>

TO EAT FISH ALIVE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Waiters bring the fish in wiggling, eyes and mouths moving, then quickly
gut it and slice it. Like sushi or sashimi, the slices are dipped in mixed soy
sauce and horseradish.;    Lobster is served belly up, cut along the tail so
diners can get at the meat. Small squid and eels are eaten whole. Shrimp are
featured in a dish called "dance" and are expected to do just that.;    Though
some Japanese express misgivings about eating live food, it is a concept that
fits in easily with the emphasis on freshness and natural presentation upon
which Japanese gastronomy is based.;    Live fish tend to be expensive.
Lobster courses at Chunagon range from a basic $44 meal to the top-of-the-line
$120 dinner.;    A spokesman for the Japan Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals said the practice is not considered cruel.;    "Eating live
fish is part of our unique Japanese culinary culture," said the spokesman, who
requested anonymity.;    "Westerners eat dead fish; we eat them live. It's
just a cultural thing. We are not being cruel. We want to have the
best-tasting fish."  </TEXT>
