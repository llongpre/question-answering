   Residents of this pristine island town
are luring city dwellers with offers of low-cost land and homes in
an attempt to stop Frenchboro from becoming just another tourist
spot along Maine's scenic coast.
   Sanford Lunt, his family and their neighbors developed the
homestead plan after years of watching residents forsake the island
for the mainland.
   The first homesteaders arrived recently, and by Christmas the
rest are expected to be living on the island, most of which is owned
by the heirs of Nelson Rockefeller.
   ``These people are great,'' said Steve Beote, a 27-year-old
electrician who moved from Salem, Mass. ``You don't find people like
this in Massachusetts anymore.''
   Beote's and six other families were chosen from about 300
applicants to move onto the 2,500-acre island, officially called
Long Island, across Blue Hill Bay from the mainland.
   Between 1960 and 1980, Frenchboro's population dropped from 57 to
43 as young residents left for the mainland and older residents died.
   About the same time, vacationers discovered the island, with its
clear, accommodating harbor and proximity to the popular resort town
of Bar Harbor, 25 miles away by boat.
   The island's attractiveness concerned residents, who prefer a
relaxed life without distractions from the outside world, said Lunt,
78, the island's oldest resident.
   ``We're getting down in population, and if it gets down too far
it might be all summer people,'' Lunt said, with bent nails
protruding from his mouth as he repaired a lobster trap. ``We don't
want that to happen.''
   A twice-a-week ferry that takes 40 minutes connects the mainland
with the island, which has no doctors, year-round stores, public
telephones or traffic lights.
   Islanders say life has a special meaning here, and as if to prove
the point, they feed plump ``wild'' deer by hand and ducks and geese
outside their doorsteps.
   ``It's a good place, it's quiet and you don't have to worry about
anyone breaking in on you at night,'' said Lunt.
   The homesteaders who have already arrived have been helping to
build their own houses in thick, pine woodland, about a half-mile
from the Atlantic Ocean. The rest of the town faces the harbor,
where lobstermen sell their catch to a wholesale lobster pound.
   The seven homestead families are renting the newly built homes
for three years, and later will purchase them at below-market
prices. The homes are scattered among about 55 acres of land donated
by wealthy heirs of Rockefeller, the late vice president. The
construction was paid for with $400,000 in federal community
development money.
   Walter Pietrowski, who moved to the island a few months ago, said
Frenchboro offers a tranquility he never found amid the hustle and
bustle of New Haven, Conn., where he, his wife and three children
lived.
   ``Sometimes you sit and you just don't hear anything,'' said
Pietrowski. ``It's strange, but I like it.''
   Pietrowski and the other homesteaders were awarded their land and
homes after a selection and screening process by a panel of
islanders and state officials.
   Most of the homesteaders have young families, and the men have
worked in trades as carpentry and and pipe fitting.
   Kerry Hartman, hired to educate the island's seven elementary
schoolchildren in its one-room schoolhouse, said that what attracted
him to Frenchboro, among other things, was the harbor, which is
littered only with lobster buoys.
   ``It's like having Arcadia National Park in your back yard,
except there's no tourists,'' said Hartman, a 26-year-old Bar Harbor
transplant. The national park comprises most of the island on which
Bar Harbor is located.
   Much of the credit for saving the island goes to the Lunts, whose
ancestors settled here in 1822. The family, which makes up half the
island's population, was the impetus behind the homesteading
project, and have made sure all the newcomers are warmly welcomed.
   ``It's more a family than it is a town,'' said Warren ``Pard''
Higgins, an island lobsterman. ``Everybody helps everybody out
whenever there's a problem.''
