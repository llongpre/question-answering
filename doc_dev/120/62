   Lucky the lobster has gone back to sea, thanks
to an outpouring of support for the 17-pound crustacean who proved
too big for the tank at the Fisherman's Galley seafood restaurant.
   Waitresses took up a collection from staff and customers to pay
the giant critter's expenses for a trip to Portsmouth, N.H., where
it recently boarded a lobster boat for the trip out to sea.
   ``The chef and I packed him up and off he went,'' said restaurant
manager Paul Renaud. Lucky, wrapped in salt-water-soaked paper,
traveled in an insulated box with ice packs. Lobsters can breathe
out of water.
   Lucky's driver was Shelley Pierce, a waitress and one of his most
ardent supporters.
   Renaud said one of the restaurant's reasons for giving up Lucky
was that it needed room in its tank for other, more normal-size
lobsters.

   Debra and Gregory Linderme didn't get a
surprise party on their joint birthday but they did receive an
unexpected gift against long odds: 7-pound, 20-inch Brian Stephen
Linderme.
   The Lindermes, both born on Dec. 21, didn't expect the baby until
Dec. 27. Nevertheless, he emerged at 5:30 p.m. Wednesday in
Providence Hospital in Holyoke.
   Linderme, a 25-year-old Holyoke landscaper, said he thought he
might get an unexpected birthday gift when his 22-year-old wife woke
him at 2 a.m. with contractions.
   ``I was pretty amazed that she was going to have it that day,''
he said. ``You can't ask for a better birthday present.''
   The odds of three people in the same family being born on the
same day are 7.5 in 1 million, according to John Buonaccorsi, a
mathematics professor at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst.

   A suburban fire company that published a 1989
calendar displaying photographs of scantily clad women will bow to
complaints from feminists by publishing a beefcake version for 1990.
   ``We know what these ladies want, and we'll give it to them,''
said Dan Haeck, chief of the Pleasant Hills Volunteer Fire Co.
``They say we've exploited women with our calendar. Well, next year
we'll even up the score.''
   A calendar featuring scantily clad men will accompany the next
version of the cheesecake calendar, he said recently.
   ``We're not real good-looking guys, so we might only use a couple
of our guys and hire professionals,'' Haeck said.
   Haeck said the company received letters from women demanding the
second version featuring men.
   Meanwhile, he said, the 1989 ``Blazes of Glory'' calendar is
``selling ... like crazy.''
   The company produced the calendar, priced at $12.95 by mail,
after more traditional fund-raising methods failed to raise the
$800,000 needed to for fire equipment.

   Yes, Virginia, even Santa Claus gets parking
tickets.
   Wes Rupell looked authentic when he pulled up at the Hughes
Justice Complex on Thursday to distribute candy canes and yuletide
cheer. He sported a real beard, jingle bells, spectacles, rosy
cheeks and the requisite red suit.
   But that didn't prevent the long arm of the law from slapping him
with a parking ticket at the state-operated child care center.
   ``I say, `Bah, humbug! Three days before Christmas a Santa gets a
ticket,'' said Cindy Carella, who runs the Justice Juniors center,
which cares for children of state employees.
   It seems the officer who spotted his car illegally parked in a
popular spot outside the state's headquarters for law and order
didn't buy the sign he posted in his window. The sign said Santa was
making a brief stop inside at a children's party.
   Ms. Carella said Rupell spent about 30 minutes with the 25
youngsters, distributing candy canes and letting them sit on his
lap. Because parking is tight at the state building, she had told
him to park in front if he couldn't find a spot.
   ``Everyone should have a Santa like this,'' she said. ``He even
ties jingle bells to his pants so he jingles when he walks.''
   Ms. Carella said she will foot the bill.
