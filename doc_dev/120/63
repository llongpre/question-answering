The Cabrillo Marine Museum sponsored its first in a series of ecology marine 
study trips over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
Larry Fukuhara, the museum's program director, selected a group who showed 
interest in the study of marine life. The Shogun out of L.A. Harbor 
Sportfishing was equipped for a trip to Catalina Island with gear for observing 
marine activity. 
</P>
<P>
The Shogun was just an hour out in the channel when four playful dolphins put 
on a show on both sides of the boat's bow. 
</P>
<P>
When the boat reached Catalina just before daylight, floodlights were turned on 
so everyone could see how squid float and are brought into waiting nets. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd Ellis, marine diver for the museum, made dives and brought up many sea 
creatures and some kelp. He also surfaced with sharks he had baited, which were 
tagged and released. 
</P>
<P>
Traps brought up calico bass, perch and whitefish, all of which were released 
after studies. 
</P>
<P>
Fukuhara said more trips will be offered as part of a series he calls "Above 
and Below Catalina Marine Ecology Studies." 
</P>
<P>
Tours of the museum's tanks, holding many exotic fish, are available Tuesday 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Yarbrough of Torrance was first-place finisher in the 13th annual Dive and 
Surf lobster contest. 
</P>
<P>
He brought up seven lobsters of legal limit with a total weight of 45 pounds. 
The contest was sponsored by Redondo Beach Dive and Surf stores, which launch 
the lobster season opener every year in October. About 300 divers participated 
in this year's contest.

South Bay Catches: Charles Pfluven of Long Beach, fishing aboard the El Dorado 
on a two-day albacore trip, caught the whopper of the week when he brought to 
gaff a 46-pound yellowfin tuna.

the jackpot with a 29 1/2-pound yellowtail.
