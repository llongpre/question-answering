'Jambalaya, crawfish pie, file gumbo . . . Son of a gun, gonna have me some
fun, On the bayou . . .'
I had heard the song many times, as I expect most people have. It is a
rambunctious, toe-tapping hymn to the food and exuberant way of life of the
Cajuns of backwoods Louisiana. In fact, I had heard it so often while dining
in New Orleans that I was getting downright tired of it.
Ruminating over a julep, I decided it was time to stop listening and start
imitating. From the tourist restaurants of the French Quarter, the levees of
the Atchafalaya Basin - the largest freshwater swamp in north America - are
just four hours away. I decided to have a little fun on the bayou myself,
and go crawfishing.
So it was, a few mornings later, that I found myself standing in a drizzle
in a pitch-dark sugar-cane field on the edge of swamp country south-east of
Lafayette. I was waiting for a couple of Cajuns, Horace Broussard and Moses
Rebert, to arrive from nearby St Martinville. Horace and Moses were
energetic, baseball-capped young men in foul-weather gear driving a shiny
pick-up truck.
Off we splashed through the cane fields, the tyres slipping and spinning on
a dirt road made soggy by days of heavy rain. It was too early and too dark
to see the flooded rice field where we stopped at last, and too cold and wet
to enjoy sitting in the little flat-bottomed skiff that we pulled from the
bullrushes at the edge of the water. Perched on an aluminium seat, my bottom
was quickly numbed.
Some fun on the bayou, I thought, shivering as Horace whipped the engine
into life and we pulled away from the bank. I fell into a daydream of
fragrant coffee and beignets being served at that very moment in the
early-opening cafes at the New Orleans market. All I could smell was mud.
Slowly, though, the day dawned, the drizzle let up and the world around us
took on a misty shape. I gazed around. Horace calls this work 'running the
pond'. It was an extraordinarily large pond, though - we were floating
across acres of silvery-grey water, the surface broken only by the
protruding tips of long rows of thin metal stakes. From a leafless bough on
the near shore, a curious owl stared down. Snowy egrets, their heads and
necks making perfect 'S' shapes, stood motionless in the brown, dead rushes.
Like us, they were interested in catching crawfish.
Lying skewered at the bottom of each metal stake, in about 2ft of water, sat
a wire mesh trap that works on the same principle as a lobster pot. Lured
into the trap through a narrow, one-way opening by a tasty morsel of bait,
the unwary victim finds it cannot make its way out and, soon after, becomes
a tasty morsel itself.
As we ran the pond, chugging up and down the rows of stakes, Moses in the
bow scooped the traps from the water, dumped a dozen or so wriggling little
creatures from each into a suspended, nylon-mesh sack, and handed the trap
to his partner at the rear. Before the stern of the skiff had passed the
stake, Horace, one hand on the tiller, had re-baited the trap with a fish
head and dropped it back down in place. I sat in the middle beside the
fast-filling sacks and contemplated the twisting, tail-flipping,
claw-snapping little beasts before me.
In France, they are called ecrivisses and cost a bomb. In Australia, they
are yabbies and are rare enough to be the subject of midnight raids on
farmers' reservoirs and lakes. In Louisiana, they are crawfish, crawdaddies
or mudbugs - anything but crayfish - and are found in vast quantities in
freshwater bayous, swamps and flooded fields throughout the state.
Cajuns, who have traditionally thrown into the cooking pot just about
anything that can be hunted, fished or trapped, have been eating these
miniature, lobster-like shellfish ever since they settled around the
Atchafalaya Basin in the 1700s. But, in the 1950s, the humble crawfish -
swamp food for the poor man - achieved a new, elevated status. It became the
subject of a nascent industry - commercial farming in stocked ponds - at
precisely the time Cajuns were re-discovering their rich and different
French-based culture.
The result was that the crawfish became a sort of mascot of Cajun
regeneration. It moved rapidly from the homes and bars of the Basin to the
restaurants of New Orleans and on to elegant tables around the world. Today,
crawfishing is big business in Louisiana. Followed closely by China, the
state is the world's biggest producer, harvesting more than 100m lbs every
year.
Crawfishermen aside, just about everyone else around the Basin - bait shops,
marinas, trap-makers, boat-builders, pond owners, peelers and processors -
depends on the crawfish for a living (to say nothing, of course, of the
tourist industry: in the summer, it is almost impossible not to stumble
across a fiddle-scraping, beer-guzzling crawfish festival).
I left Horace and Moses to their endless rows of traps - with more than
1,000 in three Atlantic-size ponds, they had their work cut out. I drove
through rice and soya bean fields, past shacks surrounded by junk and old
cars and through thick, waterlogged forests of black willow and cypress
trees. Finally, miles from anywhere, at the point where terra firma gives
way to alligator country, I stopped in at Crawdad Unlimited, one man's
little empire in the swamps.
Buddy Duchamp is an amalgam of two generations, a mixture of old-style swamp
Cajun and high-tech entrepreneur. I met him in his panelled office, his
fingers skipping restlessly over a computer keyboard; he was trying to
project catch totals for the coming season and scheming ways to break into
the French market. Outside, the freezing units of his new plant were humming
and the automatic peeling machines banged away.
Buddy's cousin, Phillip, was going to show me a second kind of crawfishing:
deep-water swamp fishing. While he fuelled his boat, I wandered past the
petrol pumps to the more old-fashioned side of Crawdad Unlimited: a bar, a
restaurant serving all the beasts that can be hunted, fished or trapped in
the surrounding swamp, and a grocery store.
There were deer heads and mounted bass hanging over blueberry cheese
danishes. Stuffed foxes and bobcats glared glassily from above chocolate
Twinkies. Wild turkeys, martins and squirrels overlooked cases of cold beer
and Dr Pepper. No one could doubt Buddy's Cajun origins here.
I had a chat with Katherine Blanchard, who was sitting behind the cash
register. She used to go to school by boat. She agreed that, in spite of the
intrusion of roads and modern life, many of the favourite traditions, feasts
and get-togethers of the Basin had survived. Take a crawfish boil, she said.
When her own family of 15 gathered for a boil, it needed at least five sacks
of crawfish - 200lb - to satisfy its needs. The great thing, she added, was
that one needed only to jump out the back door into a boat to fetch them.
If I had jumped out of Buddy's back door on my own, I would have been lost
in five minutes. The Basin, which collects run-off from the Mississippi
river and takes about 25 per cent of its flow, is large: about 20 miles wide
and 150 miles long. It teems with wildlife and, below water, with crawfish.
With all signs of civilisation falling behind, Phillip and I shot at great
speed up narrow, winding channels into a great, confusing labyrinth of
backwaters. Here, on silent stretches, some dark and open, others covered
with bright green water hyacinth, he showed me where long, joined strings of
traps lay; only coloured ribbons attached to stumps and overhanging boughs
indicated their presence. But eight, 10, 12ft below the surface, small claws
were busy trying to pinch their way out of underwater prisons.
In vain. That evening, in the Jungle Dinner Club at Ville Platte, I ordered
a plate of crawfish. In the upmarket restaurants of New Orleans, crawfish
tails are often served in a rich, roux-based bisque or etouffe, smothered in
a butter-simmered stew of peppers, onions and garlic. Here, in Cajun
country, true crawfish aficionados appreciate them simply boiled in vast
numbers with salt and cayenne.
Four pounds of crawfish - about 80 steaming crawdaddies - arrived on a tray
and I began the long process of pulling off heads and peeling back shells.
Tedious? Not a bit. There was no jambalaya, no file gumbo, and I was some
distance from the closest bayou. But that did not matter. After just one
bite of tail-meat, I knew I was going to have me some fun.
