   Amateur fisherman Tomas Ervik trapped a
22-pound lobster believed to be 40 years old, the oldest and
biggest lobster ever caught in Norway, a newspaper reported Monday.
   The lobster, caught last week off the west coast port of Floroe,
died before it reached Bergen, where it would have been studied at
the national Oceanic Research Institute before going on display at
Bergen's Sea Aquarium.
   ``We'd hoped to get it here alive, but I assume the strain of
being caught after such a long life was too much for the old
giant,'' aquarium spokesman Tor Smuelsen told the Bergens Tidende
newspaper.
   The normal life span of a lobster is 20 to 30 years, the report
said.
