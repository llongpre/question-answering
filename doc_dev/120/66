   Articles such as "Asparagus Runs: Corporate Pilots Air Their Frustrations" (Manager's Journal, Dec. 22) may seem humorous to some readers, but they also are misleading. 

   Real-life corporate aviation is somewhat different. 
Most corporate executives in charge of aircraft are responsible business people who use their aircraft efficiently to move company personnel to places where they will do the most good for that company. 
Corporate aviation flies more than 10 million productive hours per year, and these are safe hours. 
Corporate aviation had a better safety record than the air carriers last year. 
Our association has 2,900 responsible member companies that utilize more than 5,000 aircraft. 

   Frivolous use of aircraft such as "asparagus runs" may happen occasionally, but the frequency of this has become rare. 
For the most part, managers are held accountable for their aircraft operation to stockholders and other investors in today's cost-conscious marketplace. 
CEOs and other executives must constantly justify the use of their aircraft or lose them.

   I was a Maine lobster dealer in Portland, Maine, with a solid liaison with the sprawling corporate world of America via little airborne packages of kicking, squirming, succulent one-pound Maine lobsters. 
I never had anything as dramatic as the $10,000 case of asparagus described by Sharon Carter, but I have sent off some tiny packages of lobsters that, figuring their mode of transportation, must have wound up costing over $300 a pound. 

   It was a unique experience to meet a sheepish but obedient corporate pilot who had just come from Memphis or Norfolk or some other faraway place in order to provide dinner for his boss and guests. 
Maine lobsters are an enormous gourmet delight and probably taste better after they have taken a 500-mile-an-hour trip in a $2 million airplane.
