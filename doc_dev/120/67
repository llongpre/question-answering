   Rhode Island oysters _ as famous as
Maine lobsters until pollution and overfishing wiped them out
during World War II _ may be making a comeback.
   The numbers are tiny as yet, but shellfish dealers report buying
occasional batches of oysters from fishermen who normally harvest
quahog clams.
   ``There are quite a bit of oysters around,'' said Mark Boucher,
manager of Top Quality Shellfish in Bristol. ``Two, three years
ago, you wouldn't see anybody digging them.''
   But some Rhode Island oyster beds remain off-limits because of
pollution.
   ``The largest oyster population is in the Pawcatuck River, which
has been closed (to shellfishing) for years,'' said Arthur Ganz,
senior marine biologist with the state Department of Environmental
Management.
   To assess the extent of the comeback, the Narragansett Bay
Project next month will start an 18-month study to pinpoint the
bay's oyster beds.
   ``The speculation now is that they are remnants of the
cultivated oyster industry that was flourishing here in 1900 to
1940,'' said Caroline Karp, the project's director.
   Michael Rice, assistant professor of fisheries at the University
of Rhode Island, said the drop in metal pollution in the upper bay
in the last few years might be one explanation for the oyster
revival. Adult oysters can live in extremely polluted waters, but
metal contamination can be fatal to oyster larvae.
   Metal pollution at the Narragansett Bay Commission's sewage
treatment plant in Providence dropped from 954,000 pounds per year
in 1981 to 180,500 pounds per year in 1988, said Chip Young,
spokesman for the environmental group Save the Bay.
   Parts of the bay distant from the plant are open to shellfishing.
   The oyster industry flourished in Narragansett Bay in the early
part of the century. Because oysters spawn best in comparatively
fresh water but grow best in saltier water, the baby bivalves were
imported into the bay.
   ``The oysters were dredged from coves in Connecticut, schoonered
over to Narragansett Bay and left to grow until they were big and
fat and succulent,'' Ganz said.
   ``The old discarded shells would be shoveled back on the
schooners, sent back to Connecticut and used as cultch,'' the
ragged surface that young oysters need to attach themselves to in
order to grow.
   Rhode Island oysters in those days were known as the best in the
country, smaller but less salty than those raised in the Chesapeake
Bay, Rice said.
   ``They had a mystique about them, something like the Maine
lobsters,'' Rice said.
   Increasing pollution and the destruction of reefs by silt and
over-use of oyster tongs wiped out the oysters around World War II,
and many shellfishermen turned to quahogs, or hard-shell clams,
that recently have become a Rhode Island state symbol, Rice said.
   Ironically, a shortage of quahogs may be helping fuel the
renewed interest in oystering, said Boucher.
   ``They are digging them now more so because of the shortage of
littlenecks,'' Boucher said. ``The upper bay isn't open as much
anymore (to quahogging) so they're looking for any other way to
make a dollar.''
   Oysters bring anywhere from 70 cents to $1.20 a pound at Rhode
Island docks, about the same price as steamer clams but less than
the prized littlenecks, the smallest and most tender of the quahogs.
