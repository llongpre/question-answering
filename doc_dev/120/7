   Animal rights activists on Friday spent $240 to
buy seven live lobsters from a suburban Maryland restaurant and fly
them to a new home off the coast of Maine.
   Cam McQueen of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals picked
up the lobsters from the House of Chinese Gourmet in Rockville, Md.,
about 10 a.m., took them to Washington National Airport and boarded
a flight to Portland, Maine, a PETA official said.
   Members of the U.S. Coast Guard then were expected to escort her
and the lobsters to a boat station to release the creatures into
their new ocean home, PETA spokeswoman Victoria Thomas said.
   The House of Chinese Gourmet is popular among local vegetarians
who were offended when owner Jack Sun introduced the lobster tank
about a month ago, Ms. Thomas said.
   ``All of the sudden they put up a 125-gallon tank with live
lobsters, and there was a big outcry,'' she said. ``All their
vegetarian clientele got very upset.''
   Sun agreed to get rid of the lobster tank, Ms. Thomas said,
provided the animal activists bought the lobsters and arranged for
their freedom. The total cost of the lobster rescue was $240 _ $40
for the lobsters and $200 for the flight. The Coast Guard donated
its services.
   Maine is noted for its prime lobster growing areas.
   ``The water is cooler, and lobsters prefer that,'' Ms. Thomas
said.
   Ms. Thomas said there were no plans to free lobsters waiting to
be entrees in other restaurant tanks in the Washington metropolitan
area.
   ``We particularly targeted that restaurant because we knew they
had a big vegetarian clientele,'' she said.
