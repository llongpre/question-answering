Rhode Island oysters -- as famous as Maine lobsters until pollution and 
overfishing wiped them out during World War II -- may be making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
The numbers are tiny as yet, but shellfish dealers report buying occasional 
batches of oysters from fishermen who normally harvest quahogs, or hard-shell 
clams. 
</P>
<P>
"There are quite a bit of oysters around," said Mark Boucher, manager of Top 
Quality Shellfish in Bristol. "Two, three years ago, you wouldn't see anybody 
digging them." 
</P>
<P>
But some Rhode Island oyster beds remain off limits because of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
"The largest oyster population is in the Pawcatuck River, which has been closed 
(to shellfishing) for years," said Arthur Ganz, senior marine biologist with 
the state Department of Environmental Management. 
</P>
<P>
To assess the extent of the comeback, the Narragansett Bay Project next month 
will start an 18-month study to pinpoint the bay's oyster beds. 
</P>
<P>
"The speculation now is that they are remnants of the cultivated oyster 
industry that was flourishing here in 1900 to 1940," said Caroline Karp, the 
project's director. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Rice, assistant professor of fisheries at the University of Rhode 
Island, said the drop in metal pollution in the upper bay in the last few years 
might be one explanation for the oyster revival. Adult oysters can live in 
extremely polluted waters, but metal contamination can be fatal to oyster 
larvae. 
</P>
<P>
Metal pollution at the Narragansett Bay Commission's sewage treatment plant in 
Providence dropped from 954,000 pounds per year in 1981 to 180,500 pounds per 
year in 1988, said Chip Young, spokesman for the environmental group Save the 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Parts of the bay that are distant from the plant are open to shellfishing. 
</P>
<P>
The oyster industry flourished in Narragansett Bay in the early part of the 
century. Because oysters spawn best in comparatively fresh water but grow best 
in saltier water, the baby bivalves were imported into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
"The oysters were dredged from coves in Connecticut, schoonered over to 
Narragansett Bay and left to grow until they were big and fat and succulent," 
Ganz said. 
</P>
<P>
"The old discarded shells would be shoveled back on the schooners, sent back to 
Connecticut and used as cultch," the ragged surface that young oysters need to 
attach themselves to in order to grow. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island oysters in those days were known as the best in the country, 
smaller but less salty than those raised in the Chesapeake Bay, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a mystique about them, something like the Maine lobsters," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing pollution and the destruction of reefs by silt and over-use of 
oyster tongs wiped out the oysters around World War II, and many shellfishermen 
turned to quahogs that recently have become a Rhode Island state symbol, Rice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, a shortage of quahogs may be helping fuel the renewed interest in 
oystering, Boucher said. 
</P>
<P>
"They are digging them now more so because of the shortage of littlenecks," he 
said. "The upper bay isn't open as much anymore (to quahogging), so they're 
looking for any other way to make a dollar." 
</P>
<P>
Oysters bring anywhere from 70 cents to $1.20 a pound at Rhode Island docks, 
about the same price as steamer clams but less than the prized littlenecks, the 
smallest and most tender of the quahogs.
