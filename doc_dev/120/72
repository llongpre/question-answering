<DESCRIPT>  RESTAURANT; REVIEW; SANTA-CLARA; FOOD; FISH; CHINA  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  TANK space is limited at the Royal Garden, a 3-month-old Chinese seafood
restaurant just off 101 in Santa Clara. The lobsters and crabs get to swim,
but the rest of the fish -- off to the freezer.;    That's heresy, but I can't
say the results are inferior. We tried three seafood dishes one night and
liked them all, and if the whole steamed sole with ginger and scallions might
have been improved by flexing its fins longer, the difference, it seems to me,
would have been slight.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Wok lobster;  Royal Garden is a free-standing restaurant in the Oxford Park
office complex; despite a big sign, it's easy to miss unless you're looking
for it. I was looking for it because one of the neighboring high-techies
called and praised it. "They're selling lobster for $6.95!" he cried.;    No,
they're not. It's up to $7.99, your choice of lobster or crab, but at that
price it's still a loss leader, so there's a limit of one to a table. Maybe
you could talk them into making it two, if you ordered enough other stuff.;   
We had ours with black bean sauce, and it was superb -- yanked from the pan at
the moment of perfection. The sauce was pungent but not overpowering, and the
lobster flesh was fresh and sweet.;    "You ever eat lobster Chinese style?"
asked Ellen Hong, the waitress. "Chopsticks better." The trick was to pick up
a piece with the chopsticks (the shell defies forking) and -- words failing
her, she demonstrated a mighty chomp.;    When I tried it, though, the lobster
slipped from between my chopsticks. Pinning a chunk down with one chopstick
and forking the meat out worked marginally better, but fingers worked best.
Hong provided a big finger-bowl of tea with lemon.;    Our first course was
scallops ($7.50) in a wonderful spicy garlic sauce -- not too spicy but very
garlicky, with lots of chopped stir-fried garlic on top. The most strongly
flavored of our three dishes, it should have come last, had we thought ahead.;
   The whole steamed fish ($9.99) came readily off the bone, although some
tiny bones remained embedded in the soft flesh. The scallions were crisp and
the tang of ginger just sufficient to offset the slight oiliness of the
soy-laced sauce.;    When we left a little of the fish uneaten, Hong grew very
stern, implying by word and expression that we had . . . disappointed her.
There are Jewish mothers everywhere.;    Hong is the sister of owner/chef Siu
Hong. They're a Macao family, from the one-time Portuguese colony across the
bay from Hong Kong, which presumably means he knows from bacalao, too. He
certainly knows from fish tanks, but maybe if business picks up, he'll buy
one.;    Come for dinner;  We closed with a dessert of crispy fried milk
($2.95), really a thick custard that is chilled, scooped into balls, lightly
battered and deep-fried. A very delicate dish, but we both thought it could
have been just a tad sweeter.;    I had dropped in for lunch the day before,
and been disappointed. I had shrimp with lobster sauce ($5.45), in which the
shrimp were nicely done but the sauce too powerfully flavored with dark soy.
It came with a pile of pork fried rice, a cup of gray, thick soup, both
utterly without flavor, and two fried won tons that were almost unchewable.
