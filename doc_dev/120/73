<LEADPARA>  NO MATTER where or when you travel in Canada, you're apt to find the citizenry
celebrating. Some festivities honor a town's European heritage. Others -- like
the rodeos, lobster festivals and even mining festivals -- fete the local
industry.;    Some are meant to build up the community's public image, to put
it on the map, or to indulge the citizenry's fondness for music, dance and the
other arts. There are plenty of summer festivals, most of them during July and
August.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Even the smallest is worth a detour. Here are a few suggestions:;    
Eastern Canada; (box) FESTIVAL BY THE SEA, Saint John, New Brunswick: Some 500
entertainers, many representing other Canadian provinces, perform more than
1,200 shows during two weeks in August in this festival honoring New
Brunswick's marine heritage. Information: Festival by the Sea, P.O. Box 6848,
Station A, Saint John, New Brunswick A2L 4S3; (506) 632-0086.;    (box)
MIRAMICHI FOLK SONG FESTIVAL, Newcastle, New Brunswick: This five-day event is
a gathering of old-timers who indulge in enthusiastic accompanied and
unaccompanied singing about lumber camps and days at sea, in French and
English, and occasionally in other languages as well. Held annually the first
week in August. Information: Susan Butler, P.O. Box 13, Newcastle, New
Brunswick E1V 3M2; (506) 773-4469.;    (box) SHEDIAC LOBSTER FESTIVAL,
Shediac, New Brunswick: One of the hot spots of coastal sailing, this fishing
community is called the "Lobster Capital of the World." So this annual
six-day, mid-July bash seems entirely appropriate. You'll find all the
goings-on that are usual at such small-town festivities -- as well as
lobster-trapping and boiling exhibitions, lobster-eating contests, and, well
worth the trip, plenty of lobsters for all. Information: Shediac Lobster
Festival, P.O. Box 969, Shediac, New Brunswick E0A 3G0; (506) 532-2421.;   
(box) ANTIGONISH HIGHLAND GAMES, Antigonish, Nova Scotia: The Scottish
yearning to link arms with kith and kin, near and far, under the shield of the
family clan is expressed at this colorful gathering that takes place for a few
days annually in mid-July. The oldest Scottish games in North America are held
here, but you don't have to be a Scot to enjoy the fun. Information: Nova
Scotia Department of Tourism, 4th floor, Cornwallis Place, 1601 Water St.,
Halifax, Nova Scotia B3J 3C6; (902) 424-5000.;    (box) SHAW FESTIVAL,
Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario: George Bernard Shaw has done for
Niagara-on-the-Lake what Shakespeare did for Stratford. Every year, from May
to October, three theaters are given over to productions of 10 plays by the
celebrated playwright and his contemporaries. What began as a small community
of devoted actors has become one of the most successful professional theaters
in North America. Information: Shaw Festival, P.O. Box 774,
Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario L0S 1J0; (416) 468-2172.;    (box) STRATFORD
FESTIVAL, Stratford, Ontario: This event, held from May to October, produces
some of the best theater in the world. Originally known for its fine
star-studded productions of Shakespeare, the festival now presents a fine
program including plays by other classical writers, world premieres, musicals
and modern contemporary classics. Information: Stratford Festival, P.O. Box
520, Stratford, Ontario N5A 6V2; (519) 271-4040.;    (box) CANADIAN NATIONAL
EXHIBITION, Toronto, Ontario: The world's largest annual exposition, this
enormous Canadian version of a state fair keeps more than 2 million visitors
entertained with everything from a mile-and-a-half midway to agricultural
displays and competitions. Artisans compete for prizes with their quilts and
other handiwork. There are grandstand shows with name performers, daily water
shows, many major-league sports events, and the Canadian International Air
Show during the last four days of the fair. The CNE, founded in 1879, runs
from mid-August to Labor Day. Information: Canadian National Exhibition,
Exhibition Place, Toronto, Ontario M6K 3C3; (416) 393-6019.;     Western
Canada; (box) CALGARY EXHIBITION &amp; STAMPEDE, Calgary, Alberta: Canada's
self-styled "Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth" draws people from all over the
world for 10 days annually, around the first or second week of July. The Half
Million Dollar Rodeo, which takes place daily, ranks among the top events on
the circuit, and cowboys compete hard for prize money in bareback-bronc
riding, saddle-bronc riding, bull riding, steer wrestling, calf roping, barrel
racing, wild-horse racing, wild-cow milking and Indian-buffalo riding.;    But
there also are World Championship Chuckwagon Races, live entertainment, a
casino, Indian dance competitions, rock concerts, agricultural exhibits, a
midway, a big parade, a vast array of free entertainment, and much more. This
is the Wild West at its 20th-century best. Ticket information: Calgary
Stampede, P.O. Box 1860, Calgary, Alberta T2P 2M7; (403) 261-0101 or (800)
661-1260. Details on accommodations: Calgary Tourist and Convention Bureau,
237 8th Ave. S.E., Calgary, Alberta T2G 0K8; (403) 263-8510.;    (box)
KLONDIKE DAYS, Edmonton, Alberta: The fact that Edmonton is on the map today
is almost exclusively the result of the turn-of-the-century gold rush to the
Yukon, when the community became a supply depot and departure point for
north-bound fortune seekers. So when the town fathers were casting around for
a theme for a community celebration, this colorful bit of local heritage was a
natural choice. Everyone dresses in Gay Nineties garb, and buildings all over
town disappear behind 19th-century storefronts.;    What makes the festival so
much fun -- for the residents as well as the tourists -- is the lively program
of activities that features everything from marching bands and flapjack
breakfasts to river raft and bathtub races, street entertainment, community
dances, and sporting events, as well as a midway. Klondike Days takes place
the last half of July just after the Calgary Stampede. Information: Edmonton
Klondike Days Association, Suite 1660, 10020-101A Ave., Edmonton, Alberta T5J
3G2; (403) 426-4055.;    (box) FRINGE THEATRE FESTIVAL, Edmonton, Alberta:
What started as a daring experiment a few summers ago is now regarded as the
largest, most exciting festival of alternative theater in North America.
Fringe-goers can choose from among an eclectic selection of 150 new plays in
14 theaters, plus dance, music, mime and street entertainment by performers
from around the world. Theater buffs have been known to spend the last nine
days of August racing feverishly from one play to the next. Information:
Fringe Theatre Festival, Chinook Theatre, 10329 83rd Ave., Edmonton, Alberta
T6E 2C6; (403) 448-9000.;    (box) WORLD CHAMPION BATHTUB RACE, Nanaimo to
Vancouver, British Columbia: The madcap race across the 34 miles of the Strait
of Georgia, under the aegis of the Loyal Order of the Bathtub Society, is one
of those things you have to see to believe. Why would anyone want to watch a
bathtub race, you ask? Suffice it to say that this contest, held every July in
"The Bathtub Capital of the World," has spawned dozens more, and, to this day,
every bathtub race follows Nanaimo rules. Information: Tourism Vancouver,
Pavilion Plaza, 4 Bentall Centre, 1055 Dunsmuir St., P.O. Box 49296,
Vancouver, British Columbia V7X 1L3; (604) 683-2000.  </TEXT>
