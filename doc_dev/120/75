<TEXT>     Seafood cocktails range in price from $3.95 to $5.25. You can choose from
crab, prawn, lobster, shrimp or a combination cocktail. There are also oysters
on the half shell (one-half dozen), and either Eastern clams bordelaise or
linguine and clam sauce.;    Louies and salads are made with shrimp, crab,
prawn and lobster, and tomatoes stuffed with crab or shrimp. Marina's Special
Captain's Salad is made with crab, shrimp, prawns and lobster on shredded
lettuce with thousand island dressing. These range in price from $1.95 to
$9.25.;    Of course, there is clam chowder, Boston-style. My dining companion
and I each enjoyed a cup. While it was quite good, with ample chunks of clam,
I prefer a thicker chowder. It was accompanied by warm French bread, which was
replenished more than once.;    The fish entrees are prepared a number of ways
-- baked, sauteed, grilled, poached or stuffed. Selections include salmon,
halibut, sole, sea bass, flounder, Idaho rainbow trout and frog legs.;   
According to Jennifer Lam, whose family owns the grotto, the most popular
entree is the filet of sea bass. "It is baked in a casserole, with chopped
green onions, mushrooms and a tomato-based sauce," she said.;    There are
ample tempting shellfish entrees. Many are served with top sirloin. Oysters,
crab, lobster, abalone, scallops, calimari, prawns and shrimp are all
available. The "Hangtown Fry" sounded intriguing. "It's like an open omelet
with fried oysters, bacon and fried tomatoes," Lam said.;    Also interesting
to note is the scalone, a combination scallop and abalone steak and cioppino
in a shell, which is followed by the statement, "You wear a bib!" All entrees
range in price from $6.95 to $19.95.;    My companion chose the top sirloin
and prawn en skewer ($10.25) and I chose the deep-French-fried baby shrimp
($7.50). Both were served with a choice of clam chowder or salad, a baked
potato and green beans. The sirloin and prawns were bathed in a brown gravy
and were quite flavorful, and the portion was ample.;    There were literally
hundreds of fried baby shrimp on my plate, more than I could ever hope to
consume. There were no tails, a nice touch, and they were golden, not
overcooked. Very tasty! I bagged the leftovers for a later snack.;    For
dessert, my companion had the mud pie and I had the cherry crumble cheese pie
(both $2.50). Both were good, but the slices were rather thin. The mud pie is
made with a rich chocolate fudge ice cream, and the cherry crumble cheese pie
is similar to a cheesecake with a layer of cherries in the middle.; Marina Sea
