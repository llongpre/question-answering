   Shoppers at the biggest supermarket chain in
the Baltimore-Washington area are accustomed to getting advice from
Odonna Mathews, whether they want it or not.
   She is the consumers' ombudsman, advocate and confidante at Giant
Foods, and what's good for customers turns out to be good, too, for
the prospering chain, the country's 12th largest supermarket company.
   Twenty thousand times a year, customers write or call Mrs.
Mathews to ask for a recipe, to request that stores stock an old
familiar brand or to complain about the checkout clerk who put the
eggs at the bottom of the bag.
   When Giant started selling live lobsters, two customers asked for
a merciful way to cook the crustaceans.
   Mrs. Mathews consulted animal rights people, the National
Aquarium and the fish industry and wrote into a guidebook two
alternative methods _ severing the spinal cord or starting out with
cool water. The experts said lobsters feel less pain than when they
are plunged into boiling water.
   On Giant's commercials, Mrs. Mathews brims with advice. She tells
how to combat cholesterol, compare costs of different brands or opt
for healthful snacks (``choose pretzels, plain or fruit-filled
shredded wheat or matzo.'')
   ``Lower The Fat,'' urges a sign over the stores' meat counters.
``Choose chicken. Remove the skin. Eat more white meat than dark.''
   On the shelves, green arrows point out foods that are high in
fiber or low in fat and cholesterol.
   Three ounces of meat in a serving is really enough, Mrs. Mathews
advises budget-minded shoppers. ``Slice the meat thinly and fan it
out on the plate.''
   ``Everyone in the Washington area can tell you who Odonna is,''
says Lou Garcia of the Society of Consumer Affairs Professionals,
which represents 1,000 firms that employ consumer advisers. ``Not
many of them have her kind of recognition.''
   The only woman among 22 Giant vice presidents, Mrs. Mathews says
she is free ``to openly disagree with company policies when they are
not in the consumers' best interest.''
   She pestered Giant's bakers until they finally agreed to forswear
highly saturated palm and coconut oils in baked goods, except for in
whipped toppings _ and she's working on those.
   ``Some people think I'm a pain in the neck,'' she says. ``If I
am, I'm doing my job.''
   Another idea came from Giant's consumer board, on which customers
volunteer to serve. At their urging, she pressed Giant to create one
checkout lane in each store with no candy to tempt kiddies. The
chocolate industry protested in vain, she says.
   In an interview in Giant's nothing-fancy corporate headquarters
in a warehouse neighborhood outside Washington, Mrs. Mathews spells
out her philosophy:
   ``People are going to eat their hot dogs and their chocolate
chips. But choices should be there. Consumers have the right to
choose, and they have the right to be informed.''
   A native of Washington, she started as an intern to the company's
first consumer adviser, Esther Peterson, who also served as consumer
adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Carter.
   ``Giant was ahead of the curve,'' says Guy Ford, who analyzes
supermarket stocks for Investment Corp. of Norfolk, Va. ``The
industry is just coming around to what Giant's been doing for
years.''
   The Food Marketing Institute says a third of 164 retailers who
took part in a 1987 survey have consumer affairs departments. Forty
percent of the consumer advisers report to top management.
   Analyst Kimberly Walin of Prudential Bache notes that what Mrs.
Mathews does is also good business. ``The costs are not that high
and the goodwill between Giant and the community is great,'' she
says.
   With 147 stores, Giant enjoys net profit margins of over 3
percent of sales _ well above the industry average of 0.71 percent.
Giant's sales, near $3 billion a year, have doubled in eight years.
