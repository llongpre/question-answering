SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SAN DIEGO STILL HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A GHOST TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By ANTHONY PERRY

<TEXT>
<P>
Be advised that San Diego County is amply represented in the new book "Haunted 
Houses of California: A Ghostly Guide." 
</P>
<P>
That's real haunted houses -- apparitions, ectoplasm, restless dead people, 
mysterious goings-on, etc. -- not the Halloween type. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is by author Antoinette May, who grew up in La Jolla and writes a 
horoscope column for the San Francisco Chronicle. She's best known for her 
biographies of novelist Helen Hunt Jackson and war correspondent Marguerite 
Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
May identifies as San Diego County's poltergeist centers: 
</P>
<P>
* Rancho Jamul, built in 1852. Strange lights, cold spots, crying Indians, 
screaming women. 
</P>
<P>
* The Thomas Whaley House, built in 1857, in Old Town, once a site for public 
executions. Ghostly men in frock coats, weird women in calico dresses. 
</P>
<P>
* Casa de Estudillo, built in 1829, in Old Town. Faces in mirrors, flashes of 
red light. 
</P>
<P>
* Hotel del Coronado, room 502, doors closing, noises, lights, strange 
occurences, maybe from a hushed-up society suicide in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
* The Fallbrook Enterprise office. A little girl in a red dress is seen 
occasionally and vanishes, maybe from a long-ago family. 
</P>
<P>
At five, San Diego has one more haunted house than all of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
May, 47, who lives in Palo Alto, explained in a telephone interview that the 
history of San Diego County has all the fixings for wandering spirits. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego was a frontier town, with lots of violence, confusion, political 
feuding and discord," she said. "That's what generates the energy necessary for 
an atmosphere where spirits thrive." 
</P>
<P>
Violence, confusion, political feuding and discord as the ingredients for 
spooky stuff? 
</P>
<P>
If so, San Diego these days must be cooking an entire subdivision of haunted 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
"I see no reason why not," May said. She's already trying to track down a 
modern haunting in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
For Something a Little Different 
</P>
<P>
The best of everything. 
</P>
<P>
* No chicken and peas, please. 
</P>
<P>
Kara Kobey may not be elected to the governing board of San Diego Community 
College. But her fund-raiser next Sunday seems destined to be the season's best 
buffet: 
</P>
<P>
Ceasar salad; rigatoni with four cheeses; canelloni Avanti; tortellini with 
walnuts, mushroom, cream and Parmesan; eggplant parmigiana; penne (macaroni) 
and spicy tomato sauce, and focaccia bread with onion and tomato. 
</P>
<P>
* The Lakeside-based Animal Press is tilting toward Dianne Feinstein in the 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein opposes puppy mills and supports putting animal-rights advocates on 
the Fish and Game Commission. Pete Wilson is mum. 
</P>
<P>
An irate voter called Pete Wilson's San Diego office to check a rumor that if 
Wilson is elected governor he'll appoint Sunny Bonno to his Seante seat. 
</P>
<P>
Answer: No. 
</P>
<P>
* With a week to go before the deadline, the drive to recall San Deigo 
Councilwoman Linda Bernhardt has only two-thirds of the signatures needed to 
force an election. 
</P>
<P>
* North County bumper sticker: "When in despair, hug your bear." 
</P>

Putting a Claw on Glasnost 
</P>
<P>
For seven years, Larry Lobster was a regular at the Old Globe Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-inch plastic lobster made his debut in the feast scene of the 1982 
production of "The Tempest." Then he became a good-luck charm and was hidden on 
stage for each new play. 
</P>
<P>
But he vanished after "Brothers and Sisters," last year's offering from the 
Maly Drama Theatre of Leningrad. A search was futile. 
</P>
<P>
Globe technical director Loren Schreiber has now just returned from a trip to 
the Maly. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, he spotted Larry on stage. He also decided Larry should remain in 
Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Reason: An ersatz crustacean is a small price to pay for glasnost, dramatically 
speaking.
