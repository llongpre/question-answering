   A new security zone in the waters
off President Bush's summer home is drawing fire from lobstermen,
who object to changing their fishing routines for their famous
neighbor.
   ``It would be a faux pas to say, `You poor fishermen can't
fish.' Basically, what they're saying is you can fish there if you
can withstand the grief,'' lobsterman Jim Nadeau said Wednesday
night after the Coast Guard announced lobster boats would be
boarded and searched for bombs and terrorists before they can come
within 500 yards of Bush's home.
   ``If I don't fish in there, that one particular area will
probably cost me $500 or $600 or $700 a week,'' said Nadeau, who
will keep working around the Bush home at Walker's Point.
   Bush has said in the past he does not want to disrupt the
lobstering done around his home by about three dozen fishermen. But
lobstermen said the Bush entourage has caused problems since he was
vice president.
   Lobstermen complain that Coast Guard cutters on security patrols
have slashed the buoy lines on their lobster pots, costing them
hundreds of dollars as the traps and lobsters are lost.
   Coast Guard Capt. R.W. ``Bud'' Breault Jr. acknowledged that
more lobster traps will be destroyed with the new security zone,
and it may be difficult for the lobstermen to prove who did it if
they try to file a claim.
   ``This will have an impact on you and probably your lobster
pots,'' Breault told the angry lobstermen in a special meeting.
   Some lobstermen said they will refuse to work the waters off
Bush's property because they don't want government officials
boarding their boats.
   ``None of us wants to be boarded on a regular basis,'' said
lobsterman Knoep Nieuwkerk, who plans to stay away. ``Nobody wants
to be boarded. Do you want police checking your car every day?''
   Coast Guard boats have cut lobster pot buoy lines because they
are not equipped with ``cages'' that prevent propellers from
slashing the lines, the lobstermen said. The Coast Guard said
Wednesday night it will install nozzles that wrap around the
propellers on some of its smaller boats, but not on the large
cutters that will roam the safety zone and a larger area extending
another 500 to 1,000 yards farther out to sea.
