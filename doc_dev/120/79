pound live lobster; 12 large shrimp; 12 mussels; 12 small clams;  1/2 pound

peppers and cook until vegetables are soft but not brown. Add ham, cook a few
minutes, then add tomatoes, almonds, bay leaf, saffron crushed between your
fingers, salt and pepper. Simmer over moderate heat about 20 minutes or until

this point.;    While base is cooking, clean the shellfish. Remove claws from
the lobster. Cut body in half lengthwise with a large, sharp knife. Discard
central body, retaining the brown tomalley and black roe, if any. Cut tail in
half, lengthwise. Peel shrimp, leaving tails on. Scrub mussels, removing
beards. Scrub clams. Cut scallops in half.;    To assemble, combine base and
stock and bring to a simmer. Stir thoroughly and adjust seasoning if
necessary. Add lobster, mussels and clams. Cover and cook 10 minutes. Remove
clams or mussels that have opened to a serving tureen. Add shrimp and
scallops. Cook 5 minutes longer. Discard mussels or clams that don't open.

thinner fillets. Cover and cook 5 minutes or until just done. Do not let boil.
