   Secretary of State George P. Shultz on Monday
sidestepped differences with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
on a Middle East peace conference and kept a U.S. peace plan alive
by focusing on Palestinian self-rule.
   ``We do have a sense of movement,'' a senior U.S. official told
reporters after Shultz met separately with Shamir, Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
   A senior Israeli defense official, however, said the government
remained deadlocked and the only way to gain acceptance of the plan
would be for Shultz to persuade King Hussein of Jordan to accept it.

   Michael Dukakis stood in the muddy farmyard,
showing a group of children how to play the traditional Greek game
``cracking of eggs'' on Easter Sunday.
   ``You hold the egg up like this,'' the Massachusetts governor
told one child and then turned to another and said, ``And then you
hold your egg and tap hers. The one whose egg isn't broken at the
end is the winner.''
   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential candidate with a reputation
as a technocrat, is trying to warm his cool image as he struggles
to win Wisconsin's primary Tuesday and get back on track for the
nomination.

   The Roman Catholic church, shepherd
of Latin America's soul for centuries, often minds its politics as
well and is a component of life: mediator, pacifier, giver of
praise and criticism by turns.
   Latin Americans often turn to the church in times of crisis, and
have done so in this troubled country.
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath of Panama has been asked to mediate
the political dispute that began in June over the leadership of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who commands the Defense Forces and
controls the civilian government.

   A judge and a witness were given
police protection Monday after a vengeful cop killer described as
``educated and cold-blooded'' broke out of a maximum security
prison along with two other murderers.
   Bobby Stacy, 35, and two other inmates serving life sentences
without chance of parole escaped from the West Virginia
Penitentiary here on Sunday.
   ``My fear is that some police officer is going to get killed,
because that's this guy's method. He has nothing to lose, plus it's
his history,'' said Charles Hatcher, the assistant Cabell County
prosecutor whom Stacy had threatened.

   The United States has more than 90 million
households for the first time, but each contains fewer people than
ever, the Census Bureau reported Monday.
   The 90,031,000 households in the United States averaged 2.64
members each as of last July 1.
   ``The reason is, in effect, changes in the age structure,''
explained Campbell Gibson, a population specialist for the bureau.

   The Supreme Court on Monday refused to let
public airports ban all demonstrations, soliciting and distribution
of political and religious literature from their terminals.
   The justices let stand rulings that the terminal at Lambert
Airport in St. Louis, like a city street or sidewalk, is a public
forum where free-speech rights must be accommodated.
   The court's action, taken without comment, sets no national
precedent and therefore carries no direct impact for airports in
most states. The action also does not preclude the possibility that
the justices will study the issue some day.

   Poland was all wet on Monday.
   Nationwide, young people hurled buckets of water at each other
in the annual post-Easter folk holiday of ``Pouring Monday.''
   In Warsaw, the teen-agers also doused a few police officers who
wandered by the good-natured and vaguely political water games that
pitted a contingent of ``Smurfs'' dressed in blue against
green-clad ``Water People'' in Castle Square in the Old Town.

   Christo, the unconventional artist whose
creations have included fabric-wrapped islands and a 24{-mile cloth
fence, now wants parts of Japan and southern California to blossom
with 3,000 huge umbrellas.
   ``A big part of it is a comparison of differences and
similarities between places and people with a lot of affinities,''
Christo, 52, said recently by telephone from his studio in New York.
   His plan calls for about 1,500 yellow umbrellas, 19.8 feet high
and 26.4 feet in diameter, to blossom like California poppies in
the Tehachapi Mountains 60 miles north of Los Angeles. At the same
time, he wants to unfold 1,500 umbrellas _ identical except blue _
in the lush rural valley of Japan's Ibaraki prefecture, 72 miles
north of Tokyo.

   A 25-pound lobster with claws the size of
baseball mitts that was saved from becoming the main course at
Easter dinner was still a meal ticket Monday for a seafood vendor
who found potential customers flocking to his store to gawk.
   Marine officials in Maine, where large lobsters have legal
protection, hoped to return ``Shirley'' and a 19}-pound companion
to the sea Tuesday morning off Cape Elizabeth if they are healthy
after a Monday afternoon flight from Philadelphia.
   ``I'm waiting for the last possible moment to pack 'em up,''
said Kevin Hill, owner of Hill's Main Line Seafood Co. in the
suburb of Ardmore. ``Believe it or not, I'm still getting people
coming by the window to look at 'em.''
