   President Bush and Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney said today they stand ready, in Mulroney's
words, to help Colombia ``stomp out'' the terror of drugs.
   In a seaside news conference at Bush's vacation home, the two
leaders chatted about what Bush called ``an unusually productive
visit,'' that included airing differences on two trade issues:
lobsters and pork.
   But the two leaders, both casually dressed, directed most of
their attention to international issues, including ongoing efforts
to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   On the situation in Panama, where Noriega has thwarted the
scheduled transition to democracy, Bush acknowledged feeling ``a
high frustration level'' with U.S. efforts to dislodge the dictator.
   But he added: ``We are not going to give up on this. We are not
going to permit the will of the people of Panama to be thwarted by
this dictator.''.
   Bush said, ``I've never seen a coming together in world opinion
as there is on this one ... that Noriega ought to get out.''
   After the two leaders concluded their 35-minute news conference,
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu predicted the president's new
anti-drug package will cost $7.8 billion _ almost $2 billion above
current spending levels. Bush will unveil it on Tuesday.
   Asked whether he favored use of a multilateral military to help
Colombia wipe out the drug cartels, Bush replied, ``The main thing
is to cooperate with President (Virgilio) Barco in the ways that he
feels (would be) most effective.'
   Bush added, ``There is no point on Canada or the United States or
... any group of countries imposing its will on a country that is
now trying very, very hard to rid itself of this menace.''
   Mulroney said he and Bush were in ``complete agreement ... (on)
the need to support a very courageous leader in Colombia and the
need to stomp out by every reasonable means the terror of drugs.''
   While Bush said there was ``broad'' agreement between the United
States and Canada on trade, ``there are still bumps in the road.''
   Asked whether he favored a multilateral force to fight Colombia's
drug cartels, Bush said he didn't want to ``do something or say
something that would be counterproductive and turn public opinion
... against President Barco's efforts.''
   But he said ``an international effort on whatever line it is _
aid, help of any kind _ would be useful.'
   On the lobster dispute, Mulroney said: ``The president was big on
lobsters today. I was big on pork because we feel that the Americans
have just imposed an unfair tariff on pork.''
   He said they had discussed the mechanisms to resolve the pork
dispute under the Free Trade Agreement.
   Mulroney said Bush ``advanced some persuasive arguments that I
have instructed my officials to begin examining'' on the lobsters.
Maine lobstermen say the Canadians catch lobsters so small they have
not even had a chance to reproduce.
   Mulroney, who leaves with his family later today, said they had
been swimming, boating, and doing other activities, including ``a
little fishing by me.'' Mulroney, like Bush throughout his 16 days
here on vacation, caught nothing.
   Mulroney offered ``the impartial international assessment of the
fact that there are no fish out there. I can certify to that. It's
not the president's fault.''
   On another issue, Bush said he was considering increasing
emergency food shipments to Poland. ``That is one (area) where we
ought to be able to do more,'' he said.
