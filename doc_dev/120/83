One of these days, Jon M.C. Wee, 23, and Owen Norse, 22, plan on getting real 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, they're juggling their way around the country while cracking 
jokes about their seemingly uncluttered life style that started out as a hobby. 
</P>
<P>
"When we met at the International Jugglers Assn. convention in 1986, we were 
both trying to decide whether to get a real job or juggle for a living," said 
Wee, who graduated with an economics degree from Luther College in Iowa. "Both 
of us were looking for a partner." 
</P>
<P>
Norse added: "The switch from . . . thinking about getting a regular 9-to-5 
job, getting married and having kids was tough. I had to convince myself it 
would be the right decision," said the Tustin High and UC Irvine psychology 
graduate. 
</P>
<P>
They are living in Tustin while performing at Disneyland after a year on the 
road entertaining at fairs, colleges, nightclubs, and private and corporate 
parties throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"We hope to make a living from juggling as long as we can. We want to make it 
to the big time in Vegas and Atlantic City or on television," said Wee, who 
started juggling in the eighth grade, as did Norse. 
</P>
<P>
After only a year together, they won the world championship in team juggling at 
the July International Juggling Assn. contest in Baltimore. "That was our 
proudest moment," Wee said. 
</P>
<P>
Both began to juggle as a hobby. "But when we found out it was paying for 
school and leaving us with money, we found ourselves having an absolute blast," 
Norse said. 
</P>
<P>
They decided to form a comedy-juggling team -- called The Passing Zone -- last 
year after they graduated from college. Both sets of parents urged them to 
follow their feelings "and go for it. So we did," Norse said. 
</P>
<P>
Wee, who was part of a juggling team in high school, said: "In a sense, this is 
a real job. When we're not performing, we're on the phone trying to get jobs or 
else we're practicing. We're always practicing." 
</P>
<P>
With their careers on the upswing, "It's hard to picture us taking a real job," 
he said. "Suddenly, working a 9-to-5 job doesn't seem too attractive." 
</P>
<P>
Norse believes that society offers more options today to people who can turn 
hobbies, such as juggling, into lucrative businesses. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think it could happen to me until I looked at other jugglers and 
realized I was as good or better than a lot of them," said Norse, who usually 
is the butt of his partner's jokes in their comedy routine. 
</P>
<P>
"We found not too many people are interested in watching juggling alone, but 
they really tuned in when we added the comedy routine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The two jugglers seem to find themselves in perpetual motion. "We've worked 
every weekend since April and worked a lot during the week," said Wee, who 
wouldn't mind working as a comedian. 
</P>
<P>
"I've thought about stand-up comedy, but I think I'll stay with juggling and be 
funny at the same time," he said. "Comedy is a tough career. People expect you 
to be funny all the time."

When San Clemente restaurateur Robert Novello says he serves the freshest 
lobster, no one can challenge him. 
</P>
<P>
After the season opened Oct. 4, one of his lobster boats tied up at the San 
Clemente Pier and Novello helped pull up a gunny sack full of the crustaceans 
that his fishermen had just caught. 
</P>
<P>
From there, Novello took the bag into his Fisherman's Restaurant on the pier 
where the lobsters were cooked for waiting diners. 
</P>
<P>
Although he admits that hoisting the gunny sack was mainly a ceremonial 
gesture, "They still have got to be the freshest lobster anywhere," said the 
restaurant's director of operations. "It comes right out of the ocean." 
</P>

Acknowledgments -- Jay Lyttle, a Garden Grove machinist, retained his Amateur 
World Heavyweight Arm Wrestling title by defeating five challengers Sunday at 
Peak Park In Buena Park. Lyttle said he will continue to compete in other 
amateur contests but plans to turn professional next year. "Right now, I'm 
going back to the gym to continue my training," he said.
