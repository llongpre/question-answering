   Twenty years after the first moon
walk, the Apollo 11 crew called for further exploration of the lunar
surface and Mars, but another astronaut said a bold new program is
unlikely soon.
   Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin and Mike Collins, at a ceremony
Sunday commemorating the anniversary of their spectacular liftoff on
July 16, 1969, expressed their hopes for a rejuvenated space program.
   On Thursday, the anniversary of the landing, they will join with
President Bush for a celebration outside the National Air and Space
Museum in Washington, D.C.
   There, Bush will deliver a speech on space policy. Some are
pressing him to announce a return to the moon, while others are
pushing for an exploration to Mars. Many scientists are suggesting a
joint U.S.-Soviet exploration for either option.

   A lucrative consulting business as a registered
foreign agent helped fuel the lavish lifestyle of Craig J. Spence,
the flamboyant lobbyist now under investigation in Washington's male
prostitution scandal.
   Justice Department records show that Spence, a former television
reporter with political connections in the Orient, was paid
thousands of dollars by Japanese business and political interests in
the 1980s to open the right doors in Washington for his clients.
   Spence, 48, has been linked by The Washington Times to a
homosexual prostitution ring that is under investigation by U.S.
Attorney Jay Stephens and the Secret Service.
   The Times, citing credit card records, reported that Spence spent
as much as $20,000 a month on male escort services run by the ring,
which was raided by police in February. It also quoted unidentified
male prostitutes and others as saying Spence had his house bugged.

   Thousands of union coal miners returned
to work today, but some wildcat strikers continued their protest,
threatening to cloud the goodwill message their leaders want to send.
   United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka, who was to meet
Tuesday with a federal judge in Virginia and hoped to show the
miners' desire to return to work, called for an end to unauthorized
pickets and a monthlong wildcat strike.
   Most UMW locals east of the Mississippi River met during the
weekend and approved Trumka's request, which he issued Friday.
   In southern West Virginia and western Kentucky, however, wildcat
strikers again disrupted coal production today.

   Maine lobstermen are laying three times as
much bait and scientists have even tried raising lobster larvae in
test tanks, but the harvest of the tasty crustaceans hasn't
increased in 20 years.
   Marine biologists from the University of Maine and Bigelow
Laboratory in West Boothbay are conducting a 10-day research cruise
next month, and hope their detailed probe of breeding grounds will
help explain the inability of lobstermen to increase the annual
catch.
   The lobstermen, some of whom have volunteered to assist
biologists as they map the ocean floor, are hoping the investigation
will lead to bigger catches.
   Lobster production is vital to Maine's economy, not least because
of its contribution to tourism.

   Paul Adams says he has James Watt to thank _ or
blame _ for the spotlight the low-key inspector general at the
Department of Housing and Urban Development finds himself under
these days.
   ``News is driven by personalities,'' Adams said last week. ``I
think absent Jim Watt this thing would have been quickly forgotten.
He's such a controversial individual, a lightning rod.''
   Adams finds himself ensnarled in controversy as the problems at
the multibillion-dollar agency during the Reagan administration come
under scrutiny by Congress, the Justice Department and new HUD
Secretary Jack Kemp.
   Adams and his investigators and auditors reported several years
ago on many of the abuses now under investigation. Some of those
doing the investigating, particularly members of Congress, say Adams
should have done more to bring attention to the problems.

   Randall Dale Adams refuses to let bitterness
spoil his enjoyment of freedom, even though he served 12{ years in
prison and came within three days of being executed for a murder he
didn't commit.
   ``I hate what happened,'' said Adams, 40, freed in March from a
Texas prison after an appeals court set aside his conviction. ``But
each day is like being granted another day to walk upon the Earth
and bring peace to my family.
   ``If I did hold feelings of bitterness or revenge, I will ruin
whatever future I do have. If you come within three days of being
executed, you better know who you are and you better throw your
animosities out the window.''
   Adams was convicted in the 1976 shooting death of a Dallas police
officer. The case was documented in the film ``The Thin Blue Line,''
which questioned the testimony of prosecution witnesses including
David Ray Harris, who is on death row in Texas for another killing.
In the film, Harris virtually confessed to the 1976 shooting.

   Conductor Herbert von Karajan, the
brilliant and revered maestro who stirred millions with his music
and inflamed passions with his stormy life, is dead at age 81.
   He was perhaps the world's most honored, prolific and well-known
conductor.
   Karajan, who resigned as conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic on
April 24 after 34 years, died Sunday at his home in Anif near
Salzburg, said Albert Moser, the president of the Salzburg Festival.
   Austrian television said the cause of death was heart failure but
festival organizers could not confirm it.
