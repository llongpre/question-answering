Hans Prager's Yankee Tavern has drawn a large, steady stream of patrons since 
the day it opened last year, just plain folks who come for all-American fare 
like pot roast, succotash and blueberry cobbler. Now I'm happy to say that any 
of the restaurant's opening wrinkles have been totally ironed out.

I enjoyed a delightful dinner there this week; the service was speedier than I 
remembered, and the food tasted more American than ever. Maine lobster bisque 
is one of the best I've ever tasted -- rich, ruddy and velvety smooth, with 
chunks of lobster like sunken treasure on the bottom. A large, tender T-bone 
steak comes with perfect onion straws, lightly dredged in flour and crispy as 
can be.

There is an excellent stuffed chicken that will remind you of the holiday 
season, complete with cranberry relish and a medley of julienned vegetables. 
And Monday nights even feature a clambake, with steamers, fresh lobster, boiled 
potatoes and corn. 
</P>
<P>
Don't forget about the excellent desserts. The restaurant's strawberry 
shortcake, a superbly flaky sweet biscuit with a mountain of berries and fresh 
whipped cream, has no equal in the area. Cobblers and cakes are exemplary, too.

The restaurant retains its harbor-side Cape Cod look. The enormous windows and 
high-beamed ceiling give the room a lofty, spacious look, and the framed 
watercolors of ships and nautical scenes recall a small-town art gallery. Now 
Prager has added a champagne brunch on Sundays, featuring such down-home dishes 
as silver dollar-size blueberry pancakes with Vermont maple syrup, poached eggs 
with grilled ham and cheddar cheese rarebit, and skillet-browned roast beef 
hash. The price includes fruit, fresh breads and muffins, and domestic 
champagne. I can't wait for Sunday.
