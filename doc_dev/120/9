   Some Canadians and New Englanders are getting pretty steamed these days -- about lobsters. 

   The U.S. and Canada recently hammered out a new pact designed to promote freer trade between the countries. 
Now, as the proposed agreement awaits approval from Congress, a dispute has erupted over little lobsters. 
To be precise, Canadian lobsters measuring less than 3 7/32 inches from their eyes to the ends of their body shells, not including claws or tails. 

   "This isn't a joke," insists Sen. George Mitchell of Maine, who is leading the fight against the foreign crustaceans. 
Says Edward Blackmore of the Maine Lobstermen's Association: "I'm sure a lot of people out there equate lobsters with a luxury kind of thing, and can't get too worked up" over the topic. 

   But New England lobstermen can. 
They are seeking a ban on importing the little lobsters. 
Conservation laws prohibit American lobstermen from harvesting lobsters of less than a certain length in order to allow the crustaceans to mature and reproduce. 
Canadian laws are more lenient, allowing fishermen to catch smaller lobsters, some of which they export to the U.S. 
In fact, Canadians have captured half of the $731 million U.S. lobster market. 

   American lobstermen are boiling mad. 
The Canadians are undermining conservation efforts and depleting the lobster population, the lobstermen say. 
Besides, they argue, if left alone, many of Canada's little lobsters would migrate south and grow up to be an ideal catch for any New Englander. 

   Nonsense, say the Canadians. 
An embassy official says the American lobstermen's efforts are "totally inappropriate" to the spirit of the free-trade agreement. 
The Reagan administration also has cut the lobstermen adrift, saying the group's motivation in seeking the ban is protectionism. 
The agreement -- minus the lobster clause -- is likely to pass the House today. 
But the lobstermen say they'll press on. 

   (The lobstermen also are seeking to bar imports of "berried," or pregnant, lobsters, or "scrubbed" lobsters that show evidence of eggs having been removed.) 

   Administration trade officials have tried several maneuvers to derail the lobstermen. 
First, they questioned whether lobsters migrate. 
The New Englanders fought back with studies that suggest they do. 
Then a trade official suggested the ultimate insult: Canadian lobsters mature and become sexually active at smaller sizes than lobsters that live in the warmer waters off New England. 

   Trade officials also tried to butter up Maine interests by including in the trade pact a provision that would benefit potato farmers. 
To that, Sen. Mitchell retorts: "What's a potato without a lobster?" 

   American lobstermen are putting their faith in politics. 
They have high hopes for help from Vice President George Bush, who they think is sympathetic to their cause. 
Mr. Bush recently assured the lobstermen that, if elected president, he'll still permit them to trap in the waters off his compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, despite possible Secret Service objections. 
"Bush understands," says Robert Brown, the president of Lusty Lobster, a lobster-supply business in South Portland. 

   In fact, the lobstermen figure they can't lose in this fall's election. 
"Gov. 
Dukakis knows a lot of lobsters are caught in Massachusetts," Mr. Brown says.
