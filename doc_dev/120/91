   Residents are gleeful, proud and a
bit apprehensive about what could become of their seaside community
of 4,500 people now that summer resident George Bush has been
elected president.
   ``I think everyone's real excited,'' Kathy Anuszewski said
Wednesday as she worked at The Lobster Port, a shopping center Bush
frequents about a mile from his family compound. ``But no one really
knows what to expect about its effect on the town.''
   Except for during World War II, Bush has spent every summer since
he was a child in this town 25 miles southwest of Portland.
Residents speak of the 64-year-old Bush and his family reverently,
and even those worried about the consequences admit that having the
president nearby is an honor.
   Janet Winters, a Republican member of the town's Board of
Selectmen, said residents are happy for Bush, but said there is
concern about the potential for a rise in tourism. The streets are
already clogged daily between May and September.
   ``I am proud. I'm pleased he'll be here,'' said Gerda Towne, who
owns two stores at the Port. ``But the merchants have got to be sure
the town doesn't go to pot. We don't want any honky tonks.''
   Ocean Avenue, the winding, narrow road where the Bush family
lives, is often lined with cars bearing people who sit and stare at
the Bush compound. Many locals say they fear those crowds will grow.
   ``I'm a little leery because I don't know what costs the town
will incur,'' Winters said. ``Every bus tour that comes into
southern Maine will swing into town. But still, there's a sense of
pride in him, a feeling it's our town that could be the center of
attention.''
   Republican friends of Bush have hired a local artist to paint a
36-foot banner to hang across Dock Square when the Bushes return to
town.
   ``Welcome Home,'' the banner says. ``George Our President And
Barbara Our First Lady, Our Hopes And Prayers Are With You.''
   Secret Service agents already have met with town officials to
discuss the precautions that must be undertaken now that Bush will
be president, Duncan said. What changes will take place are still
unclear, however, and town police have yet to meet with the Secret
Service.
   ``We just don't know what to expect,'' Town Manager Jane Duncan
said. ``Rumors are running rampant.''
   Police Chief John Prescott said he hopes to meet with Secret
Service officials by the end of the week.
   One security-related worry concerns the lobstermen who pull their
traps from waters around the Bush compound during warm weather.
There has been speculation the fishermen will be ordered away.
   Bush has said he would forgo Kennebunkport if it means others
will suffer. Statements like that have generated affection for the
president-elect.
   ``He's just a real nice guy, a down to earth guy,'' Anuszewski
said.
   ``My dad has known George Bush a long time, and he plays golf
with him,'' she said. ``We're all really proud of him, but he's
still the same guy was before.''
