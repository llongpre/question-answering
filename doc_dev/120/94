<HEAD>Bush: Soviet Leader Would Find Home in Maine</HEAD>

   President Bush wouldn't say Wednesday
whether he'd consider inviting Mikhail Gorbachev to his vacation
home, but Bush was sure the Soviet leader would take to the seacoast
town. ``Everybody likes it,'' he declared.
   The president took a break from his boating, golf and tennis to
field questions from Maine reporters on the lawn of his vacation
home, discussing everything from world events to the price of
lobster.
   But he sidestepped a question on whether he would ever invite
Gorbachev to join him at his Maine retreat.
   ``Well, he'd be welcome,'' said Bush, who is here on a three-week
vacation that runs through Labor Day.
   ``Do you think he'd like it?'' Bush was asked.
   ``Who couldn't like it? Yes. Everybody likes it.''
   Asked if the average Mainer could afford to have a vacation like
his, the president responded: ``I don't think so. I'm very
privileged and lucky in that regard. But I also don't think the
average Mainer begrudges me a vacation of any kind.''
   The president was stumped when one reporter asked, ``Mr.
President, what do you think a fair price for a pound of lobster
is?''
   ``I don't know. Can't give it to you.''
   Bush was also asked to reflect on his first seven months in
office, and to comment on his high acceptance level reflected by
public opinion polls.
   ``Some of it is my wife. Some of it is the fact, I think, people
see that we're trying hard. It's fundamental values. Some of it is
that I've tried to calm things down and work with Congress.''
   ``But these things change. You know, these polls _ look, you're
looking at a guy who was standing on this lawn about a year ago at
this time and ... the numbers were quite different ... What goes up
can come down, and I'm well aware of that.''
   He admitted the White House trappings that have caused traffic
headaches for town residents have also made his summer in
Kennebunkport different from years past.
   ``What bothers me a little bit is that you just can't jump in the
car over there and drive downtown or something of that nature,'' he
said. ``But that goes with the territory.''
