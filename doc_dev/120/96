   Four sheriff's department divers were
caught snatching lobsters from a commercial fishing bed and face
misdemeanor counts of game law violations, authorities said.
   ``Lobsters really bring out the larceny in everybody,'' said
state Fish and Game Department Warden Mike Castleton, who spotted
the divers' boat early Friday anchored off La Jolla Shores.
   ``Everybody thinks of the deluxe lobster dinner. It's just
crazy,'' Castleton said.
   The men are part of an elite diving rescue and
evidence-gathering team, said San Diego County Sheriff's Lt. Alan
Fulmer. They were cited for 13 misdemeanor counts and could face
six months in jail on each count and be fined up to $1,000. They
also could face disciplinary action by the department.
   The divers were on duty at the time and had used county
equipment, including an inflatable boat, trailer and pickup, Fulmer
said. Inside their boat, authorities found 13 undersized lobsters.
   ``What they did was stupid,'' he said. ``They did get caught and
what can you say when you get caught with your hand in the cookie
jar?''
