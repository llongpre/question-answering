   Oil rigs disguised as dinosaurs and four
giant red lobsters were the winning entries in a national design
contest to decorate a rundown gasoline station built in the
mid-1950s.
   The jury initially dismissed the lobster motif as ``too
whimsical,'' but ``we kept coming back to it, over and over,'' said
former Mayor Pamela Plumb, one of the judges. ``It would become the
Eiffel Tower of Portland,'' an instant landmark and potential
meeting place, she said.
   ``They're not token lobsters or trite gestures. They're blown up
to a scale where they're truly heroic,'' said Deborah Andrews,
another judge.
   The 60-foot-long and 20-foot-tall lobsters, each resting on a
giant canopy, were designed by Philadelphia architects Willis
Pember and Andrew Blanda.
   That design and the dinosaur entry from Architect William
Collett of Cambridge, Mass., were the winners in the Gateway Gas
Design Competition devised by the C.N. Brown Co., owner of the
dilapidated station.
   The two first-place winners announced Wednesday received $2,000
each. Residents in Portand will have a chance to comment about the
winners and 157 other entries.
   C.N. Brown is not obligated to use any of the designs when it
renovates the station. The contest came about when city planners
balked at the company's bid to use a standard Mobil Oil Corp.
design to replace the existing structure.
   Collett's design pays homage to fossil fuels. The roof is
reminiscent of prehistoric animals and appears to mimic the action
of oil drilling rigs when blown by the wind.

   Bobby Stephenson and his friends needed
something special to compete in the world's largest barbecue
cookoff. So they built a 53-foot-tall, two-ton, steel replica of
the Eiffel Tower.
   The cooking booth is this year's focal point at a Mississippi
River bluff where 175 barbecue teams will spend today through
Saturday cooking 25 tons of pork.
   The party includes a ``Miss Piggie'' beauty contest, a
hog-calling competition and a parade.
   Stephenson said his 22-member group, The Not Ready for Swine
Time Porkers, started working on their blue-and-white tower in
January.
   A 22-foot-square base forms the cooking booth's roof and a
second story observation tower. Next to the booth is a 7-foot-long
steel cooker with three cooking surfaces and plenty of space for a
whole hog.
   ``It got to be a bit more involved that my team had expected it
was going to be,'' Stephenson said.
   This year's contestants come from 22 states and France, Ireland,
Great Britain, Canada and the Soviet republic of Estonia.
   The Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest
is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the largest
event of its kind anywhere. The listing was based on the 55,747
pounds of pork cooked last year.
