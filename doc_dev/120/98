<LEADPARA>  DYNASTY, at the far or California Street-end of the three-block-long
restaurant ghetto that is downtown Mountain View's Castro Street, is an
old-line Chinese restaurant.;    Its walls, not recently painted, are the
color of diluted chicken soup, and they are bare except for a small Daily
Special board, in Chinese, back by the catfish tank.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The crabs and lobsters are in another tank, on the opposite side behind a
room divider, which may explain why Fu Lam Mum, just down the street, was
packed on this Thursday night while Dynasty was almost empty. Fu Lam Mum's
tanks are in the window.;    Once, years ago, when our first choice was closed
for a wedding and we had no particular reason to choose one Castro Street
restaurant over another, we had wandered into Dynasty, ordered one of the
standard dinners -- the Deluxe, $8.75 a person? the nine-course Dynasty at
$10.75 per? -- and enjoyed a marvelous meal, not transfiguring, perhaps, but
well-made and plentiful.;    So this time I chose it on purpose, ignoring the
crowds down the street, at least for now. Seafood was what I had in mind,
which simplified matters: a crab, a lobster, some squid and a soup with
scallops to start. The result was a pleasant, messy and only slightly
monotonous meal for three that cost around $50, beer included.;    Extensive
menu;  Focusing on seafood allowed us to save the rest of the menu for another
look. None of us felt up to plowing through three pages (nine entries under
Duck &amp; Pigeon alone, not counting shredded duck soup), so I missed entirely
the opportunity to try braised duck feet, down there on the second page of
Chef's Specials (58 in all), just above the chitlins.;    Dynasty is a
Cantonese-style restaurant with Hong Kong overtones. The sauces are thick,
well-made but either quite similar or quite subtle, depending on one's taste.
The ingredients, however, were of the first quality, and the service
efficient.;    We began with a soup listed as scallops with leek and asparagus
($5.75). Asparagus being out of season, the restaurant simply omitted it. The
rich, thickened broth was filled with slivers of scallop and vegetables,
sometimes -- but not always -- leaving a hint of ginger on the tongue.;    The
use of fresh milk (and surely some condensed, too, for sweetness) in a sauce
for the lobster was one hint of Dynasty's origins. Another was the waiter's
reaction when we ordered Tsingtao, a mainland beer. He shook his head and
suggested Sun Lik, from Hong Kong.;    The lobster ($14) tasted fresh -- as
though it had just lurched ashore. Cleaved into bits and baked, its meat was
sweet, with just a faint tang of the sea. The crab, a medium-sized Dungeness,
was baked with ginger and scallions, the ginger laid over the emptied carapace
in sheets. It, too, was fine.;    Slippery shells;  The only problem with both
these dishes was a mechanical one. Their sauces were thick and began to gel as
the shellfish cooled. We had only chopsticks and forks. While the claws and
shells had been adequately cracked, those buggers were slippery.;    Throwing
decorum to the winds, I went at them with both hands. Since, technically
speaking, both the steamed rice and our third dish, of stir-fried fresh and
dried squid, required the use of a utensil, it became difficult to know with
which grimy paw to do what. Fortunately, as one of our fortune cookies pointed
out later, we had "an optimistic faith and confidence in life" and did not go
hungry.;    By the time a third companion joined us to pick at the remains,
spooning some rice into the soup bowl and finishing off the squid, we were
sticky-handed, surrounded by piles of red and white shellfish detritus, and
replete. "You should not return to the past," counseled another fortune
cookie. But when it comes to Dynasty, I don't see why not.; Dynasty;
