   When Johnny Sylvester's father wanted a second
opinion about his sick boy, he consulted Babe Ruth. The baseball
legend's treatment was unorthodox _ a 1926 World Series home run.
   John Dale Sylvester, 74, died Monday. But Ruth's purported
promise and delivery of a home run lives on, memorialized in
newspapers, biographies and on film, though wildly distorted.
   ``So many things about Babe Ruth have become like Greek
mythology,'' baseball historian Don Honig said after hearing of
Sylvester's death.
   Sylvester died at a hospital on New York's Long Island. No cause
of death was given.
   According to news reports from the time, Sylvester was kicked in
the head by a horse, suffering a life-threatening injury which left
the 11-year-old boy bedridden in Essex Fells, N.J.
   Johnny reportedly told his father, Manhattan bank vice president
Horace Sylvester, ``Gee, I wish I could see Babe Ruth wallop a
homer before I die.''
   The elder Sylvester contacted Ruth's team, the New York Yankees,
in St. Louis via telegram, recounting his son's request.
Autographed balls from the Yankees and the St. Louis Cardinals were
sent to the lad; Ruth wrote on one ball, ``I'll hit a home run for
you in Wednesday's game.''
   The Sultan of Swat then hit three homers in the Yankees' 10-5
fourth game victory over the Cardinals. Johnny's doctors reported
the boy had bounced back remarkably from his illness, and a legend
was born. Sylvester quickly became America's most famous invalid.
   ``That and the called home run _ those two specific incidents
are probably the best known Ruth stories,'' said Robert Creamer,
author of the biography ``Babe.''
   ``The incident is sort of characteristic of Ruth. He had a great
sort of ingenious quality about him,'' said Creamer. ``He'd do
things like this, sometimes with great publicity, sometimes with no
publicity.''
   When William Bendix portrayed ``The Bambino'' on film, the story
had Ruth bedside with a dying boy when the home run was promised.
It was far from accurate, but as Creamer noted, ``That was a pretty
bad movie.''
   One week later, Ruth visited the lad. Johnny, well aware that
Ruth had been caught stealing for the final out in the Yankees
series loss, told the Babe, ``I'm sorry the Yanks lost.''
   Sylvester went on to attend Princeton University, serve in World
War II, and become president of packing machinery business. His
son, John Jr., said his dad remained a Yankees fan until the end.
Slyvester is also survived by a sister and a brother.
   The whole Johnny Sylvester story apparently had little effect on
the Babe. According to Creamer's biography, Ruth was sitting around
with a couple of baseball writers during spring training in 1927
when Sylvester's uncle approached the Babe and thanked him
profusely.
   ``How is Johnny?'' Ruth asked. The uncle assured the Babe that
Johnny was doing OK and walked away.
   Ruth, who was notoriously bad with names and referred to most
everyone as ``kid,'' turned to the reporters and asked, ``Now who
the hell is Johnny Sylvester?''
