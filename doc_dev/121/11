<LEADPARA>  CREATING almost as much stir as Stephen Lang's portrayal of "Babe Ruth" in
tonight's NBC movie is the man who plays baseball legend Ty Cobb in the film:
Pete Rose.;   A baseball immortal himself, Rose took on his first acting role
in the midst of the ongoing controversy over his disgrace in a betting scandal
that ended with his being banned from baseball for life in 1990.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the film, Rose has just one scene as Cobb with Lang's Babe Ruth. Ruth is
eager to become a baseball manager; so he meets with Cobb, then player-manager
of the Detroit Tigers, to see how he likes it.;   Ironically, Rose, years
later, also was a player-manager for his team, the Cincinnati Reds. He also
was known as a "hustling" ballplayer like Cobb and, in fact, was the man who
broke Cobb's record for total hits.;   "It just seemed to be a perfect
choice," said producer Frank Pace. "Rose named his son after Ty Cobb and knows
more about Cobb than possibly any person living.";   But there were limits to
how Rose could be used in the film. Organized baseball refused to permit Rose
to appear in a major league uniform and wouldn't allow him to be photographed
at a ballpark. One ballpark scene where Cobb disputes an umpire's call on Ruth
was canceled. Rose appears in street clothes in a hotel room for his only
scene as Cobb.;   How does Rose perform as an actor? This critic thinks he's
fine in a very small part, but Executive Producer Lawrence Lyttle, the man who
signed Rose's paycheck, offers a professional opinion:;   "He has a natural
cadence about his acting, and he was absolutely charming. I think everybody's
going to be surprised at just how natural he is as a performer." (box)  </TEXT>
