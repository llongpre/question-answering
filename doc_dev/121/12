Remember way back when the All-Star game was first played in Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
Dave Sommers remembers. He was one of 46,309 fans nestled comfortably in their 
seats at the nearly new Anaheim Stadium on July 11, 1967, when the Big A 
marquee stood right behind the outfield fence and when there was no permanent 
seating behind center field. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Clair remembers. He was there too. He even has a memento of the game, a 
program that sold for 50 cents at the gate. This year's All-Star program costs 
$5. 
</P>
<P>
And 89-year-old Ernie Johnson remembers. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson wasn't at Anaheim Stadium in 1967 when the National League 
All-Stars clipped the American League All-Stars 2-1 in 15 innings. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson recalls an Orange County all-star baseball game a few years earlier -- 
1924 to be exact. That was when a barnstorming team headed by New York Yankee 
immortal Babe Ruth played in Brea against another touring team captained by 
favorite son Walter Johnson of the Washington Senators, who, like Ruth, ended 
up in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
"The only thing I can lay claim to is that I was there when Babe Ruth and 
Walter Johnson played," said Johnson, president of Brea Canyon Oil Co. and no 
relation to the illustrious pitcher. "I was quite a follower of Babe Ruth and 
Johnson. They put on quite a show." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson the oil man said that Johnson the pitcher grew up in Olinda, which is 
known today as Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
"He persuaded Babe Ruth to come," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
On that November day nearly 65 years ago, Ruth hit a home run off a Johnson 
pitch but another time he went down swinging. "He could throw that ball hard," 
Johnson said of the pitcher. Nevertheless, Ruth's team won 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
"When Babe Ruth struck at that ball and he missed it, he turned clear around," 
recalled Johnson, one of 5,000 to 16,000 Orange County residents on hand that 
day, depending on which yellowing newspaper account you believe. 
</P>
<P>
"Baseball's quite a thing," Johnson concluded. "It attracts a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
One of those who will resist the attraction of this year's All-Star game is 
Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. Like Johnson and Johnson (Walter and 
Ernie, that is), Riley played baseball as a young man and has remained a fan. 
But Riley will miss the midsummer classic in Anaheim just as he did in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
"Just this morning, I had a call from a friend who invited me to sit in their 
box," Riley said. "I have tickets, but I'm going to give them to a member of 
the staff. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pretty much of a baseball fan . . . but Emma Jane (his wife) is not such 
an enthusiastic fan. We sort of compromised and will forgo this one." 
</P>
<P>
Had Riley an opportunity to attend the 1967 game, however, he would have leaped 
at the chance, he said. At that time he was recently retired from the Marine 
Corps and vice president of a Newport Beach manufacturing company. 
</P>
<P>
Riley does not recall the hoopla that led up to the 1967 game. But he clearly 
has noted the changes in Orange County that have taken place since. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of us are still having difficulty with that feeling that we are really 
big boys now," Riley said. "We are really an urban county, second or third 
largest in the state, depending on which day you count." 
</P>
<P>
"We've developed that tremendous stadium. We've really developed a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think it was kind of a remarkable thing that we had 63,000 people?" 
Riley said of the Fourth of July crowd at the stadium for the California 
Angels' game and fireworks display. 
</P>
<P>
Like Orange County, Anaheim Stadium has grown in the past 22 years. The 1989 
All-Star game is a sellout, but there will be about 17,000 more seats occupied 
this year than at the 1967 sellout, a dozen years before the addition of two 
tiers of seating beyond the outfield fences. 
</P>
<P>
Another difference this year is that Genevieve Linhoff plans to see the entire 
game from her seat -- and a choice location it is too, right down in the front 
row, smack behind the American League third-base dugout. 
</P>
<P>
In 1967, Linhoff missed about three innings of the game when unexpected 
last-minute emergencies required her to help out in the stadium ticket office 
where she was employed as secretary to the ticket manager. This year she is 
assistant ticket manager. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to be sitting in the seats this time. I'm going to see the whole 
game," Linhoff said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Anaheim has changed" since 1967, Linhoff said. "We were more intimate 
. . . now we're big. Particularly at the stadium. You knew so many of the 
customers. We had fewer people." 
</P>
<P>
Like so many baseball fans, Linhoff is a traditionalist. She wasn't even real 
fond of expanding stadium seating and moving the distinctive Big A from behind 
center field to exile in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like that too well, but it's progress, more capacity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Ernie Johnson recalled how progress altered forever another Orange County 
baseball tradition. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1920s a large crowd used to gather outside an Anaheim coffeehouse, 
where the proprietor kept the baseball-hungry throng posted on play-by-play 
developments of the World Series by relaying telegraph bulletins from the East. 
</P>
<P>
On a large board erected outside the eating establishment, the restaurateur had 
denoted bases, the outfield and the players. 
</P>
<P>
"We stood on the opposite side of the street and watched it and sat on the 
curb," Johnson recalled. "He got the reports by telegraph, and he played the 
game out." 
</P>
<P>
"He had . . . lights and he'd ring a bell when there was a hit and he'd tell 
who the batter was. He yelled it out through that window." 
</P>
<P>
Alas, progress intervened and in later years radios became commonplace. There 
soon was always someone who would have more up-to-the-minute news than could be 
provided by the quaint coffee-shop scoreboard, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
"That began to kind of spoil the thing a little bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Back to the future. Johnson intends to attend Tuesday's All-Star game. Like 
Supervisor Riley, he missed the one in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Even if his wife were enthusiastic about attending, Riley has decided that 
considering "the traffic and all involved, I think I'd feel better if I watched 
it at home" on television.
