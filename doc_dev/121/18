   Dorothy Ruth Pirone, the daughter of
baseball great Babe Ruth, died at home Thursday. She was 68 years
old.
   Pirone lived in Durham for more than a dozen years, where she
raised Arabian horses.
   For most of her life, Pirone was led to believe that her mother
was Ruth's first wife, Helen, despite rumors to the contrary in the
press.
   In 1980, however, she learned that her real mother was a woman
she had grown up knowing and loving as a close family friend.
Pirone said last year she held no bitterness toward her father for
not revealing her true mother's identity.
   Last year, Pirone wrote a book about her famous father, ``My
Dad, the Babe.'' It was co-authored by Chris Martens and published
on the 40th anniversary of her father's death, Aug. 16, 1988.
   ``I think I did it more for myself and to show my father was not
the kind of person he was portrayed. I was very defensive of my
father and I can't help it,'' she said in an interview last year.
   Pirone died of natural causes, the family said through a
spokesman at the B.C. Bailey Funeral Home Inc., in Wallingford.
   Pirone, wife of the late Dominick L. Pirone, is survived by four
daughters, one son and 12 grandchildren.
