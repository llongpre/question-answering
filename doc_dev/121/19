   George Bush, former baseball coach, took time
out Friday from preparing for his trip to communist Europe to talk
baseball with 4,000 Little Leaguers.
   ``In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and
of your dreams,'' he said to the kids.
   They were gathered on the South Lawn, decked out in uniforms
identifying them as Indians, Mets, Springfield, Rocco's Rockettes,
and Parkland Blue Jays.
   The purpose was to mark the founding of Little League 50 years
ago in Williamsport, Pa. Adding luster to the ceremony were such
baseball greats as Stan Musial, Mike Schmidt, Brooks Robinson, Gary
Carter, Ted Sizemore, Joe Morgan and Jim Palmer.
   The president confessed his baseball hero was Lou Gehrig. And he
recalled that when Babe Ruth presented his papers to Yale, the Yalie
who accepted them was none other than George Bush.
   To the young players, Bush repeated a line that Babe Ruth
delivered to a crowd in Yankee Stadium when he was dying of cancer:
   ``You know, the only real game in the world, I think, is
baseball. You've got to start from way down when you are 6 or 7
years old and if you try hard enough you're bound to come out on
top.''
   With those words, said the president, Ruth ``defined why Little
League baseball has become an American, indeed, an international
institution.
   ``My four boys played it, I coached it, and Barbara _ not many
non baseball players could properly score a baseball games, but
Barbara did that, inning after inning,'' Bush said.
   ``Like you, I know what makes Little League so special. It's a
feeling of sportsmanship, generosity, teamwork, a feeling of family,
fathers and daughters, mothers and sons.''
   He said in the 50 years, 20 million youngsters had played Little
League _ more than 2.5 million in 33 nations this year alone.
   Bush told the crowd that when he is in Poland next week, he will
have the pleasure of helping import Little League. And he said he
will tell about Musial and Carl Yastrzemski, both baseball greats of
Polish extraction.
   ``In Little League all that matters is the size of your heart and
of your dreams and ask these kids about it,'' Bush said. ``Dreams
are the essence of America and of baseball and Little League can
propel those dreams.
   ``In the end what matters is how we conduct ourselves on as well
as off the field. That's where Little league really connects, by
building courage and character. It belts a grandslam home run by
doing those two things.''
