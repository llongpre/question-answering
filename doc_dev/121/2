Book publishers and baseball memorabilia collectors have scored a major victory 
in a court case about who can publish photographs of Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
New York federal appeals court ruled Monday that, although the Babe's heirs own 
his name, they do not own his image. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed against Macmillan Inc. by Ruth's 
daughters, Dorothy Ruth Pirone and Julia Ruth Stevens, claiming that Macmillan 
had illegally used three photographs of Ruth in a 1988 baseball trivia 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Irving R. Kaufman wrote in his opinion: "Ruth was one of the most 
photographed men of his generation, a larger-than-life hero to millions and a 
historical figure in whom interest still runs high." 
</P>
<P>
While Ruth lived, the judge wrote, he was paid by various manufacturers for the 
use of his picture or name in promoting the sale of various products. After 
Ruth's death in 1948, his daughters registered the words Babe Ruth as a 
trademark for "paper articles, namely playing cards, writing paper and 
envelopes," Kaufman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
That trademark has been lucrative. Mark Roesler, president of Curtis Management 
Group, the Babe's Indianapolis-based licensing agent, said last December that 
fees paid to the Ruth family were estimated at $400,000 for 1989 and were 
expected to grow to $1 million in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The photographs at issue in the case appeared in the 1988 Macmillan Baseball 
Engagement Calendar. The words Babe Ruth are not on the calendar cover, the 
judge noted. 
</P>
<P>
The calendar cover has a photo of Ruth helping a small boy with his batting 
grip. Inside the calendar, there is a photo of the Babe saluting Gen. John 
Pershing and a photo of a baseball autographed by Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth's daughters objected to the use of Ruth's likeness. Their suit alleged 
federal and common-law trademark infringement and unfair competition, 
infringement of the common law right of publicity and violation of the New York 
Civil Rights Law. The New York law forbids the use for advertising or trade 
purposes of any portrait or picture without the consent of the subject if the 
subject is living. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Kaufman acknowledged that there is a valuable commodity in a public 
figure's image, but he said that Ruth's daughters had made much too broad a 
claim.
