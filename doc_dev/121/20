   A lock of George Washington's hair fetched $2,750
at an auction of celebrity memorabilia Saturday, which also
featured a package of letters written by mass murderers and Adolf
Hitler.
   The lock from the nation's first president went to a bidder,
who, like the other buyers and the sellers, requested anonymity
from the DuMouchelles auction house in Detroit, said auctioneer Joe
DuMouchelle.
   The collection of letters from John Wayne Gacy, David Berkowitz,
Charles Manson and Hitler brought $700.
   Fecthing the highest price was Babe Ruth's 700th home-run
baseball, sold for $9,300 by a New Jersey buyer, said DuMouchelle,
whose family owns the auction house.
   An autographed photograph of Marilyn Monroe, who died in 1962,
brought $5,000, the robe worn by Sylvester Stallone in ``Rocky
III'' sold for $2,400, and a pair of silk boxer shorts once owned
by actor Jack Nicholson went for $700.
   Two art deco etchings by Louis Icart sold for $7,000 and $6,500
each, the auctioneer said.
   The items were auctioned off in estate sales and the
standing-room only crowd of bidders came from across the nation,
DuMouchelle said.
   Manson is serving a life prison term for the California murders
of starlet Sharon Tate and six others by members of his cult
``family'' in 1969; Gacy was convicted in 1980 of the sex-related
killings of 33 young men in suburban Chicago, more murders than
anyone in U.S. history; ``Son of Sam'' killer Berkowitz murdered
six people in New York City and wounded seven others in 1976 and
1977.
