<LEADPARA>  PERHAPS because of baseball's longevity, or maybe because of its association
with childhood summers, the sport thrives on nostalgia. It's a game many of us
can regard with soul-warming affection, even if we didn't play it well. By
definition, then, a videocassette called "Baseball's Greatest Moments" (60
minutes, $19.95) is destined to find a receptive audience.;    The tape also
happens to be a production of Major League Baseball Home Video, giving it that
"official" cachet. The viewer can rest assured the best available game footage
was used.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     New York focus;    The tape limits itself to 20 "greatest moments," which
fill an hour nicely but also will spark disappointment among partisans who
have their own ideas of greatness. The relative merits of specific plays can
be argued endlessly by fans (and in fact they are, to the game's enrichment),
so your own favorite may have to wait for an enlightened sequel.;    For the
time being, however, it's fair to say that fans of the Yankees, Dodgers and
Giants will find themselves particularly well-served. Among the players
extolled here are Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Jackie Robinson, Willie
Mays, Bobby Thomson, Don Larsen, Roger Maris and Reggie Jackson. The rest of
the country may wonder why MLB Home Video didn't call the tape "New York
Baseball's Greatest Moments.";    Starting with Babe Ruth's "called shot"
homer in 1932 and ending with Nolan Ryan's sixth no-hitter just last year,
each historic moment is preceded by a title screen describing the event and
date. The titles are set inside of picture frames, and signature scenes from
each event are glorified with special video treatment that renders
painting-like images.;    The narration supplies the context leading up to the
crucial action -- Mays' over-the-shoulder catch in 1954, Larsen's perfect game
in the 1956 World Series, Maris' 61st home run, Pete Rose's 4,192th career hit
and so on.;    Looking back;    Where possible, each is followed by the
comments of players or managers as they are today, looking back at the moment.
These scenes can be powerfully moving, such as Maris' recollection of feeling
embarrassed about stepping out of the dugout to take a bow after he broke
Ruth's home-run record, or Harvey Haddix still smiling at the fates who took a
game away from him even after he had pitched 12 perfect innings.;    "Greatest
Moments" is not limited to actual hits, runs and errors. Also shown are
Gehrig's farewell speech in 1939 (coupled with DiMaggio's reflection on that
day) as well as the arrival of Robinson in the major leagues. Leo Durocher
recalls the very unwelcoming attitude of his Dodgers and his own words of
advice: "You'd better get used to it, boys."  </TEXT>
