<LEADPARA>  JOHN Goodman is scoring a home run with his portrayal of the legendary Babe
Ruth for the Universal big-screen cameras.;    "His transformation is
awesome," reports John Fusco, writer and producer of "The Babe." He adds,
"I've spent the last two years studying newsreel footage of Babe Ruth -- and
I'm looking at him now. John Goodman is the Babe."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Speaking from Chicago's Wrigley Field during filming of a re-enactment of
the 1932 World Series, Fusco said of his star, "John's transformation has been
uncanny. He lost about 60 pounds for the role. He went through a rigorous
training period to learn to execute a Ruthian swing -- an incredibly powerful
left-handed swing. He does Ruth's classic home run trot. He's got his speech
mannerisms down pat. Sometimes it's spooky. Even now, in our seventh week of
production, he's constantly studying footage of the Babe in his trailer. It's
John's first dramatic starring role -- and he's shown an incredible level of
concentration.";    "The Babe," slated for release at the beginning of next
year's baseball season, is scheduled to complete production the end of the
month -- just days before Goodman's "Roseanne" series revs up for the new
season.;  NEW WOMEN: "Designing Women" starts new season production July 29,
with a story that will incorporate new "Women" Julia Duffy and Jan Hooks into
the cast. Gone, of course, is battlin' Delta Burke, who's been dropped from
the show, and Jean Smart's only going to be around for an occasional episode.
"Jean will do the first couple," says producer Harry Thomason, "and then we'll
play it by ear." Hooks will be playing Smart's sister, recently divorced from
the biggest mobile home dealer in the Southwest. Duffy will come aboard as a
cousin to Dixie Carter and Burke's Sugarbaker sisters.;  PLAYING GODDESS:
Susan Griffiths, who wrapped work as Marilyn Monroe in ABC's "Marilyn &amp; Me"
movie earlier this month, is already girding herself for the critical flogging
she figures could come when the production airs this fall. "I'm kind of
putting myself on the chopping block by doing this," admits the 26-year-old
actress, who's playing 20ish Norma Jean Baker (Monroe) in the movie detailing
the relationship between the screen icon and writer Bob Slatzer -- who claims
to have been Monroe's second husband. "I hope the movie's taken for what it
is, a beautiful love story -- whether or not they believe Bob's account," says
Griffiths (who does). No matter how "Marilyn &amp; Me" is received, she doesn't
plan to continue playing Monroe after it airs. Having made a part-time career
as a Monroe look-alike since age 17 -- with three Japanese commercials, a
Vegas stage act, and now, the ABC telepic -- "I've done it. I can't imagine
playing her in anything better than 'Marilyn &amp; Me' -- and I'd really like to
do more as myself now.";  By St. Clair Pugh and Denis Ferrara for Liz Smith in
New York;    DOUBLE DEBUT: Two of television's most popular women, Stephanie
Zimbalist and Linda Purl, are going to be treading the off-Broadway boards in
their New York stage debuts. Zimbalist and Purl will star in Jane Anderson's
acclaimed play "The Baby Dance," which explores the emotionally charged issue
of adoption.;    This drama began its journey to New York in February 1990,
when it premiered at the Pasadena Playhouse. It was extended twice by popular
demand, finally moving eastward to the Williamstown Theater Festival and a
recent engagement at New Haven, Conn.'s, Long Wharf. Set to star opposite
Zimbalist and Purl are Richard Lineback, Joel Polis and John Bennett Perry.  </TEXT>
