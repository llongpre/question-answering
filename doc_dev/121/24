<LEADPARA>  Police in Pleasant Hill launched a big league effort to recover 16 priceless
autographed baseballs stolen from the home of Bill Hawe last month, and they
hit a home run when they cracked a teen burglary ring. "It's a pleasure," said
the 62-year-old Hawe, who began collecting signatures on baseballs when he was
about 5 years old. He thought he'd never see the collection -- including two
horsehides signed by Babe Ruth -- again after it was stolen in February. But
police recovered the balls when they unraveled a string of home burglaries
last week. Ten youths aged 16 and 17 burglarized seven homes in the area,
detective Dan Connelly said. One of the youngsters turned over the balls.
"They didn't realize what they had," Connelly said. "When they got outside and
they saw one that said Babe Ruth and they said, 'Holy moley.' " Hawe, who
didn't know the value of his collection until part of it was stolen, said
experts estimate it is worth more than $250,000.  </LEADPARA>
