   Prince Edward plans to quit serving tea to members
of composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group and set up a
production company of his own with five members of the theater
company.
   The 26-year-old prince, the fourth and youngest child of Queen
Elizabeth II, joined Lloyd Webber, whose hit musicals include
``Cats,'' ``Starlight Express'' and ``Aspects of Love,'' as a
production assistant in 1988.
   Production assistant is the most junior job in theaterland. The
prince's backstage work included making tea for co-workers.
   Edward said in a statement Tuesday that he was grateful to Lloyd
Webber and the Really Useful Group for the chance to work in the
theater.
   The prince and his five colleagues refused to discuss their
plans.

   Talk show host Larry King is asking fans ``to
go to bat for the Babe'' in a fund drive to expand the Babe Ruth
Museum.
   ``These are exciting times for baseball fans. Starting today
we're going to offer fans across the country membership to the Babe
Ruth Museum,'' King said Tuesday behind the house where the Sultan
of Swat was born 95 years ago.
   ``We hope we can count on all of you to go to bat for the Babe.''
   The museum hopes a broadened membership will pay for a
12,000-square-foot addition, including a 6,000-square-foot
auditorium.
   The museum was built in 1974 around the birthplace of George
Herman ``Babe'' Ruth.

   Seattle Seahawks linebacker Brian
``The Boz'' Bosworth is a cross between James Dean and Arnold
Schwarzenegger, says the director of his first film.
   Bosworth stars in ``The Brotherhood,'' a $10 million movie being
shot here in which he continues to play defense _ in this case, as
an FBI agent seeking to stop a political assassination by a
motorcycle gang.
   Bosworth is trying to recover from injuries that have
interrupted his football career.
   Director Bruce Malmuth called Bosworth the star of the 90s.
   ``Boz is great,'' Malmuth said Monday. ``He's just picked up
right where he left off in the sports world and he's zoomed to the
foreground.
   ``I see in him Marlon Brando, James Dean and Gary Cooper, all in
one package. He's got the same appeal of a Stallone or an Arnold
Schwarzenegger.''

   Former President Gerald Ford, an avid
golfer whose game is best known for his beanings of spectators,
practiced his swing Tuesday for the first time since a knee
operation, but only for a moment.
   ``My surgeon I'm not sure would appreciate this,'' Ford said as
he hit six balls at a driving range. The swings were largely for
the benefit of local news photographers.
   Ford stopped in Juneau during a sightseeing tour of Alaska with
his wife, Betty, and former British Prime Minister Leonard James
Callaghan.
   Callaghan watched from behind as Ford prepared to take his first
swing.
   ``Stand back, everybody,'' Callaghan joked.
   Ford looked out at the driving range. ``You're safer behind than
out there,'' he said.

   ``Roger &amp; Me'' filmmaker Michael Moore once again
stalked the elusive quarry of his movie, this time to give General
Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith a copy of the video.
   ``He said he hasn't seen the movie yet and so I figured ... the
video comes out tomorrow, I'll give him the very first copy of the
videotape and he'll get a chance to see it,'' Moore said Tuesday,
after GM security guards refused to let him take an elevator to
Smith's office.
   GM issued a statement saying Smith was out of town and
criticizing Moore's visit as a publicity stunt.
   The film is a tongue-in-cheek documentary about Moore's attempts
to interview Smith about GM plant closings and layoffs in Flint,
Moore's hometown.

   A luncheonette owner who feels sorry for
Donald Trump is asking customers to chip in spare change for the
billionaire developer.
   Ed Mancini, owner of EATS, put a jar labeled ``Donald Trump
Fund'' next to his cash register Sunday after hearing customers
discuss the real estate mogul's failure to pay about $31 million
owed to bond holders of the Trump Castle Casino in Atlantic City.
   ``I know it's not going to be enough to help him. I know it
sounds stupid. But he's a good man and we want to support him,''
said Mancini.
   About $10 has been raised so far.
   ``When the can is full, I'm going to send the money. I don't
know what he'll do with it, maybe he'll send it to charity,'' said
Mancini.
   A spokeswoman for Trump had no comment on the fund drive.
