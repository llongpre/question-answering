<LEADPARA>  (check)  At the right (in suspenders) is acting newcomer Pete Rose, who plays
the immortal Ty Cobb in NBC's "Babe Ruth," with Stephen Lang, who plays Ruth.
Because Rose is banned from baseball for life for gambling, he was not
permitted to suit up in any major league stadium while making the movie, which
will be shown Oct. 6.;   That's Lang at the far right, too. You would never
have seen him dressed that way if John Goodman of ABC's "Roseanne" hadn't
walked out of the part because he got a better offer to play Ruth in "The
Babe," which hits theaters in 1992.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     (check) What do Candice Bergen and Katey Sagal have in common? They're both
expecting babies this season. Bergen's "Murphy Brown" doesn't know who
fathered her child, but fans of the CBS comedy will learn early this fall.
(She's at right, above, with co-stars Jay Thomas and Robin Thomas.) Sagal's
real-life pregnancy is being written into her Fox sitcom, which may change its
name to "Married . . . with More Children.";   (check)  Julia Duffy, Mary Page
Keller and Connie Sellecca all gave birth to the same baby. Sellecca (bottom
right with Brandon Justin Conkling) was the original TV mom on ABC's "Baby
Talk" but quit before the series premiered last season. Julia Duffy (bottom
left with Paul, or Ryan, Jessup) took her place but quit last spring to join
CBS's "Designing Women." Don't worry, though. Baby Mickey has a new mom this
season: Mary Page Keller (bottom center). Kirstie Alley of "Cheers" was
Mickey's first mom in "Look Who's Talking." Wisely, she's had nothing to do
with the TV series, which returns Sept. 20.;   (check) Olivia Burnette (not
shown) is the 14-year-old narrator of NBC's "The Torkelsons," a gentle comedy
about a dirt-poor Oklahoma family trying to scrape by. I think Burnette is the
discovery of the season, and writer-producer Lynn Montgomery's
autobiographical comedy may be the season's best.;   (check) Sellecca co-stars
in the season's worst debacle, CBS's "P S I Luv U," an excruciatingly dumb
action show about an unmarried couple pretending to be married while hiding
from hit men. (box)  </TEXT>
