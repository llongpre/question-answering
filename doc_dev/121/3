   Babe Ruth wasn't just a legendary home run
hitter for the New York Yankees _ he's a registered federal
trademark, his two daughters have charged in a suit against
MacMillan Publishing.
   The suit filed Friday in U.S. District Court by Dorothy Ruth
Pirone of Durham, Conn., and Julia Ruth Stevens of Conway, N.H.,
seeks to halt sales of a 1988 calendar published by MacMillan that
carries a picture of the late slugger on its cover.
   ``MacMillan's unauthorized, unlicensed and unapproved use of
Babe Ruth's image, likeness and name tends to cause confusion and
deceive the public,'' said attorney Martin A. Levitin, representing
the Ruth family, in court papers.
   ``The 1988 MacMillan Baseball Engagement Calendar'' includes two
photos of the Babe that were used without permission of the family,
the suit charged.
   The suit, which also lists Babe Ruth League Inc. and the Curtis
Management Group Inc. as plaintiffs, said Ruth's daughters filed a
written request with MacMillan asking it to halt distribution of
the calendar. The publisher allegedly ignored the request.
   Ruth's daughters received a federal trademark last year for the
name ``Babe Ruth'' on paper articles, the suit said. Curtis handles
licensing of third parties seeking to use Ruth's name, it said.
   Sharon Dynak, a spokesman for MacMillan, said she had not yet
seen the suit and had no immediate comment on the suit, which
charges MacMillan with trademark infringement and unfair
competition.
   The plaintiffs asked U.S. District Judge Pierre Leval for a
permanent injunction blocking MacMillan from using additional
photos of Ruth; an award to the plaintiffs of all profits made from
calendar sales; additional monetary damages; and reimbursement for
all lawyers' fees.
