The contents of safe deposit boxes left dormant for five years got new life 
Monday, when they were sold at a state-run auction presided over by State 
Controller Gray Davis. 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of the auction, held in West Hollywood, came early in the 
proceedings when Beverly Hills art dealer Louis Stern plunked down $2,500 for a 
baseball autographed by Babe Ruth. He hopes to sell it to a Tokyo real estate 
magnate who is creating a baseball museum. 
</P>
<P>
The ball was one of 1,200 lots for sale. Other items included an autographed 
picture of the Beatles (which went for $80), coins, jewelry and trinkets. The 
total appraised value of the lots was $150,000. Information on the total amount 
raised was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
After trying to locate box owners through Social Security and driver's license 
records and by taking out newspaper advertisements for at least a year, the 
contents of the boxes were put on sale, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sale proceeds for each item will be held for the rightful owners or their 
heirs," Davis said. Until claimed, the money is invested and held in the 
state's General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Through periodic auctions, the controller's office hopes to bring attention to 
the approximately $520 million in unclaimed property and assets that the state 
currently holds, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
"One out of every seven people living in the state have something owed to them 
by our office. The odds are much better than winning at Lotto." 
</P>
