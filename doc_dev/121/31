<LEADPARA>  In yet another case of art imitating life, Pete Rose was picked to play Ty
Cobb in a made-for-TV movie: "The Babe Ruth Story.";    Maybe next he could
play Babe Ruth in "The Ty Cobb Story." Who knows? Could go on for years.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Cal Levy, one of Pete's agents, was quoted as saying: "It's not a huge role
or anything, so they must have figured they didn't need a name actor to play
the part.";    Nice goin', Cal. Keep talking and next thing you know, they'll
be asking Pete to do the gig for free.;    Rose dumped Cobb's seemingly
untouchable career-hit record with No. 4,192 off Padres pitcher Eric Show in
September 1985. (Was it that long ago?);    The most notable thing he
accomplished after that was to get himself in a lot of trouble with both
baseball and the federal government. Make that two things.;    Which puts him
two up on Show.;  BACK-HANDED SALUTE FROM SNIPPY NORTH; When the A's Mike
Moore gave up 10 runs in three innings in an 11-6 loss to Cleveland last week,
that pushed Seattle past Oakland into first place in the A.L. West. Moore was
selected by Seattle as the top pick in the June 1981 draft but left the
Mariners as a free agent in 1988 to sign with the A's. So, wrote Jim Street of
the Seattle Post-Intelligencer last week: "Mike Moore finally pitched the
Mariners into first place.";  HOCKEY GRABBING OUR HEARTS AND HEADLINES; 
Remember when hockey puck was a Don Rickles gag line? What happened? It's all
the Sharks' fault. All of a sudden we're talking seriously about guys who end
each sentence with "Eh?";    First we got an Elvis Presley impersonator
rockin' out with Pittsburgh Penguins player Phil Bourque (he's the one in the
Stanley Cup T-shirt). Then, talking about T-shirts, we learn that somewhere in
the greater Toronto area, there are a lot of puckheads wearing Sharks
T-shirts. The T-shirts are reported to be a hot item at a store in Toronto's
Eaton Centre, where a clerk said 17 have sold this month. And we're talking
devoted fans here, because the made-in-Canada T-shirts carry a $29.98
(Canadian dollars) price tag.;    Oh, and one thing more: Please don't ask us
why.;  She is head over heels in love with baseball; Ethel Peckham, 90, of San
Mateo was approaching a picture of Babe Ruth near the entrance to the Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., last week when she fell and broke her hip.;   
Peckham underwent surgery right there in Cooperstown, got a new artificial hip
and was scheduled to be released Thursday. But she didn't feel up to trekking
across town to the Hall of Fame, so the Hall of Fame came to her.;    A museum
official showed up with a baseball cap and T-shirt, a Hall of Fame yearbook
and a lifetime pass.;  ' Being single, sometimes you want; to get out and meet
people.  '-- Mark Gastineau, before pleading innocent; to punching; a bar
patron in Hempstead, N.Y.  </TEXT>
