<LEADPARA>  AS contract hassles and walkout threats pollute the major league baseball
scene, it's refreshing to know there's one local success at the college level
who hasn't forgotten his loyalty or roots.;    Jackie Nickell, a 1987 Gunn
High graduate, pitches for the University of Southern California baseball
team. He returns this weekend to Sunken Diamond, where he handed Stanford its
only home loss of the 1990 Pacific-10 Conference season, a 3-2 verdict last
May.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The victory comes secondary to another feat that happened that day.;   
Sure, it was the ultimate homecoming, to beat the nation's third-best team
while snapping its 18-game home win streak before 2,351 fans.;    Winning
before relatives and friends would seem like the perfect time for a grand
celebration, a night on the town.;    But Nickell kept his victory in
perspective.;    He simply celebrated by helping his father, Rory, coach his
Babe Ruth League team for a few innings before leaving to grab a bite and
return to the hotel before curfew.;    "He just showed up," Rory Nickell said.
"I hadn't even thought about it.";    The younger Nickell attracted Will
Clark-like attention from the younger players but downplayed his presence.;   
"I just watched the starting pitcher get loose and coached one of the bases,"
Jackie Nickell said.;    He was asked a lot of questions and showed the
leadership of a veteran, providing tips to the youngsters.;    "A lot of them
liked to ask about playing Stanford. I told them it was great. I showed the
pitchers what they can do within the boundaries (of the rules).";    Nickell
chuckled while completing the final sentence. While I sensed that he was
willing to give inside tips had the pitchers reached adulthood, he clearly
enjoyed spending the precious time he had.;    It's not the first time Nickell
has done this. He said he makes an effort to help his father's team when the
Trojans visit the Bay Area and Dad's team is playing.;    Father and son admit
it's tough to see each other during baseball season. Last season, Papa
Nickell's only chance to see son Jackie play came at Stanford. Making a living
and coaching a Babe Ruth team don't leave much free time.;    "Last year, it
was a tossup between the College World Series (in Omaha) and getting my team
over a bad hump," Rory Nickell recalled.;    Rory Nickell didn't have to make
that decision when the Trojans, a game away from the CWS, lost two straight to
host Louisiana State in the double-elimination South I Regional and were
denied a trip to Omaha.;    But there was no summer break for Jackie. He went
to play in the Cape Cod League and posted a 5-2 record with a 1.74 earned run
average, fifth best in the league.;    "I wish I was closer to my parents,"
Jackie said last week. "But I enjoy what I'm doing.";    And there's plenty of
fun this season. As of last week, Nickell posted a 4-3 record with wins over
Stanford and UCLA. The Trojans remained in first place in the Six-Pac with an
11-1 record and were ranked second in two college baseball polls.;    Although
the Babe Ruth season is more than a month away, Jackie hasn't forgotten his
role as a coach.;    "Hopefully, some time this year I'll be able to help
Dad.";    And all the advice Dad gave to son wasn't forgotten.;    "I was
amused when Jackie would reiterate something to the kids that would be exactly
the same thing I told him.";    Sounds like good advice.  </TEXT>
