RUTH BROUGHT BASEBALL ROARING INTO THE '20S

<P>
Seventy years ago today, a first-year outfielder for the New York Yankees hit 
his 30th and 31st home runs of the 1920 season in the second game of a 
doubleheader at the Polo Grounds. 
</P>
<P>
So what? 
</P>
<P>
So, George Herman (Babe) Ruth became the first to hit 30 home runs in a season. 
In the next several weeks, he would also become the first to hit 40 and 50 home 
runs, too. 
</P>
<P>
He was on his way to a home run record that, in 1920, was almost beyond belief 
-- he would hit 54, then 59 in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
Reference points: When Ruth hit 54 in 1920, the second-highest total in 
baseball that year was 19, by George Sisler. Only one other team in the 
American League that year hit more than 44 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
When he hit his 30th homer that afternoon, it was the 138th of Ruth's career, 
making him, at 25, the all-time home run leader. Many baseball historians claim 
today that Ruth's 1920 and '21 seasons were the greatest consecutive seasons by 
any hitter in baseball history. And many even believe either season was 
superior to his more famous 1927 season. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth played in only 142 games in 1920, yet drove in 137 runs. His home run 
percentage that season was 11.8%, compared to 1927, when it was 11.1% as he hit 
60 in 151 games. 
</P>
<P>
But most impressive of all, Ruth's slugging percentages in 1920 and '21 were 
.847 and .846. Neither figure has ever been approached. In fact, a slugging 
percentage higher than .704 has been achieved only 20 times, eight by Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth has the three highest slugging percentages ever. His .772 mark for 1927 is 
No. 3. No. 4 is Lou Gehrig's .765 in 1927. Ruth and Gehrig are on the top-20 
list 11 times. The most recent player to make the top 20 was Ted Williams, who 
hit .731 in 1957 to rank 12th. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth joined the Yankees after the 1919 season, when Boston sold him to New 
York. In his last Red Sox season, playing in 130 games, Ruth was 9-5 as a 
pitcher, and hit 29 home runs -- then a record -- and drove in 114 runs as an 
outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
Before 1920, no 20th-Century player had ever hit 30, 40 or 50 homers in a 
season. Only three had ever hit 20, and one was Ruth. Three late-19th Century 
players hit between 20 and 27 home runs, but some of those, it is believed, 
were inside-the-park homers, many coming in fenceless ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
So in 1920, no one had ever seen this kind of home run production. As recently 
as 1918, Ruth co-led the major leagues with 11 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
And people paid plenty to see home runs in bunches. The Yankees, who after two 
more seasons would be able to afford to build a new ballpark -- Yankee Stadium, 
a.k.a. "The House that Ruth Built" -- became the first team to draw 1 million 
fans in a season, in 1920. They drew 1,289,422, breaking the previous 
attendance mark by 380,000.
