   Babe Ruth drank here, between innings. Bill Veeck
threw his wooden leg across a stool and rhapsodized here for hours.
And future baseball legends, it now appears, will get a chance to
become part of the lore at McCuddy's saloon.
   The tavern is one of 11 businesses scheduled for demolition as
the state clears the area around ancient Comiskey Park for a new
stadium for Chicago's White Sox by 1991.
   But Gov. James R. Thompson has promised that McCuddy's, with a
little help from the state, will rise from those ashes like a
phoenix in the same spot it has occupied for 78 years _ directly
across the street from Comiskey Park.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Pat Senese, the bar's 65-year-old owner, said
Monday. ``My wife is the third generation of the McCuddy family to
have a stake in this and now we know it'll go on beyond that.
   ``It'll be sad to see the building come down, and besides, we'll
be closed for two years'' during stadium construction, Senese said.
   ``But they tell me it's sitting where the third-base line of the
new one (stadium) will be.
   ``And opening again in two years is better than not opening at
all.''
   The interior of McCuddy's will be all that survives the move.
Thompson said he wanted to save the exterior, but noted there is no
way to build the new stadium and parking lots and still accommodate
McCuddy's during the two-year construction.
   ``It'll have the same feel even if the exterior is new and even
if we're sitting on state-leased land,'' said Senese, who sold his
old parcel of land _ the bar, an adjoining home and two lots _ to
the state for about $235,000.
   ``We'll be across from the park and we'll put a few cracks in
the floor and walls if we have to.''
   McCuddy's has been a Chicago institution since John J. McCuddy
got a tip from a rich and powerful friend named Charles Comiskey.
   Known as the ``Old Roman,'' Comiskey owned Chicago's American
League franchise at the turn of the century, and long harbored
dreams of one day moving from the old wooden ballyard at 39th
Street that was the club's home.
   John J. McCuddy was one of the few people Comiskey let in on the
dream, and McCuddy's opened its doors in time to serve the
construction workers who built Comiskey Park _ dubbed the
``Baseball Palace of the World'' when it opened July 1, 1910.
   ``We've been open for every home game ever since,'' said Senese.
   ``In fact, that's the only time we are open. They have rock
concerts here, soccer games, whatever _ our doors are shut.
   ``This is a baseball joint _ always has been, always will be.''
   So much so that Ruth, legend has it, came across the street
between innings of Yankees-White Sox contests during the mid-1920s
and tipped a few beers before making his way, tipsy sometimes, back
to right field.
   The Babe's visits to McCuddy's would have come right in the
middle of the Prohibition Era, which began in 1920 and lasted until
1933, when Elizabeth ``Toots'' McCuddy headed the family and ran
the tavern.
   But that didn't mean Babe would have had a problem getting a
beer, said Pudi McCuddy, Senese's wife and Elizabeth McCuddy's
daughter.
   ``I know McCuddy's used to serve what they called near beer (a
legal, weaker version of beer) in those days,'' said McCuddy, who
still has the photograph depicting Ruth holding her when she was a
young girl.
   ``But it's also possible the real stuff was available for
special customers as well. Knowing Toots, that would be my guess.
   ``Unfortunately, the only person who would know for sure is my
aunt Frances,'' she added, ``and she died two years ago.''
   ``He was the only guy ever allowed into the place wearing
spikes,'' said Senese. ``He ate everything he could eat and drink
in about three minutes is how my wife tells it. Of course, she was
a little girl then, so we're relying on second-hand information.''
   Yet the day after the White Sox' final home contest this season
_ originally thought to be McCuddy's last stand _ Ruth's daughter
called up Senese and said she wanted to see the place so lovingly
described by the Babe.
   ``People get emotional about this place. Bil Veeck, when he
owned the club, always found time to come in for a beer and he'd
end up sitting for hours. Always had time and a few good stories
for the fans,'' Senese said.
   ``In fact, we've had women bring their infants in and fill up a
thimble with beer _ just so they can say that the little one had
his first one at McCuddy's.''
