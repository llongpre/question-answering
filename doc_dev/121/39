<LEADPARA>  JOHN Goodman's "Babe" will not lionize the baseball legend.;   "Babe Ruth had
a lot of problems, a lot of vices. It's a dark movie -- with warts and all
kinds of things," reveals Bruce Boxleitner, who plays Ruth's wisecracking best
friend, Joe Dugan, in the upcoming feature. He feels the approach of the
biopic "might even make some people angry."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The recent "Babe Ruth Story" TV movie did touch upon the late Sultan of
Swat's drinking and womanizing, but could only go so far as a network
television offering. "Babe," however, "doesn't stop," Boxleitner says, and
when it comes to the slugger's parade of women, "it doesn't hold back. . . .
Ruth was the most famous athlete of his day, and as far as female admirers,
the situation for athletes then and now wasn't that different.";   Boxleitner
did additional "Babe" shooting earlier this month -- after he completed CBS's
upcoming "The Secret" TV movie, in which he plays the son of Kirk Douglas'
character.;   HELLO AGAIN: Jack Klugman is returning to the tube -- in a
two-hour presentation of "Quincy" for Universal. It's been a long road back
for the beloved actor, who lost a vocal cord during cancer surgery in 1989.
However, he's feeling and sounding fine -- and expects to have another TV
project firmed soon.;   BOW-WOW: Ivan Reitman's "Beethoven" comedy, in which a
dog serves as the title character, is set for an Easter release. It sounds
like it'll be well worth the wait from what we're told by some who've seen
early sneaks of the picture -- and from "Beethoven" star Charles Grodin. He
reports the movie "has elements of what 'Lassie Come Home' had -- a dog in
jeopardy." He adds it wasn't only the dog that made "Beethoven" a challenge,
but also working with a child, 6-year-old Sara Rose Karr. "You'd be in the
middle of a scene and suddenly she'd be telling you about her new jacket. I'd
look up at Ivan and he'd smile like, 'That's just the way it is.' After making
'Kindergarten Cop,' he's an old hand at working with kids," says Grodin, who
adds, "I'm not complaining. She's adorable.";   MOVING ALONG: Singer/actress
Carrie Hamilton reveals that since the mother-daughter book she was supposed
to do with mom Carol Burnett fell through, she's been approached by several
publishers about doing her tale solo. She's rejecting such a notion. "They
keep asking if I want to carry on and write the book on my own," says
Hamilton, who went through years of a harrowing teen-age drug addiction. "I
just celebrated 10 years sober, but I'm not Gandhi. I'm still just sort of
living life and stumbling through like everyone else." And besides, she adds,
"Back then (1987), the whole idea of a dysfunctional family was relatively
new. Now there's been so many 'I was a bad girl' books. I'm just going to
leave it shelved.";   HUMAN KIND: It'll be a different -- "more human" --
Steven Seagal on the big screen next year when his "Dreadnought" film goes
into release.;   That's the word from writer Jonathan Lawton, who reports, "We
are trying to make him more mainstream . . . getting him out of the pure
action genre and into an acting role." Among other things, he says, the macho
star will be shown shooting a gun and missing -- and getting punched, knocked
down "and not hitting the guy back or killing him or anything.";   The
29-year-old, best-known for writing "Pretty Woman," is feverishly finishing a
rewrite of the "Dreadnought" script -- for which he received $1 million up
front with $300,000 more to come. "I'm trying to bring the budget within a
reasonable range. The original script was almost irresponsible, with things
like battleships getting blown up," admits Lawton -- who is also busy trying
to launch the offbeat new "Pizza Man" comedy he wrote and directed (under his
sometimes-pseudonym J.D. Athens).;   "The way it was, 'Dreadnought' would have
cost $100 million-plus to make. Now we're looking at the $30 million range,"
he says.;   The feature was initially planned for a December production start,
but now Seagal hopes to start the picture in January, according to Lawton.
Second-unit filming has already begun in Hawaii. "It was Steven's idea to fit
the Pearl Harbor Memorial into the film," says Lawton, "because all these
incredible ships would be there -- a spectacular sight."  </TEXT>
