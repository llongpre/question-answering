<HEAD>Court: Ruth's Heirs Cannot Sue Publisher For Trademark
Infringement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Babe Ruth's daughters struck out in federal
court when an appeals court ruled that a publisher did not infringe
on their trademark by using pictures of the Bambino in a calendar.
   Three judges of the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals on Monday upheld a
lower court ruling that dismissed a lawsuit by Julia Ruth Stevens
and Dorothy Ruth Pirone, who has since died, and against Macmillan
Inc.
   After Ruth's death, the sisters registered the words ``Babe
Ruth'' as a trademark for playing cards and other uses.
   The court said the trademark did not apply to photographs of
Ruth.
   The calendar, ``The 1988 Macmillan Baseball Engagement
Calendar,'' contained three references to Ruth. The cover was a
photograph of Ruth helping a boy with his batting grip; a week in
October was illustrated with a picture of Ruth saluting General
John Pershing; and a page in the December section had a photograph
of a baseball autographed by Ruth.
