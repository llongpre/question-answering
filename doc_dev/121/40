   George ``Specs'' Toporcer, the
first non-pitcher to wear eyeglasses in a major-league ballgame,
died Wednesday after a fall. He was 90.
   Toporcer went straight from semi-pro baseball to the St. Louis
Cardinals in 1921, breaking in as a utility infielder. During an
eight-year career with the Cards, he played all four infield
positions but spent most of his time at shortstop.
   Toporcer posted a lifetime batting average of .279 and appeared
in one game during the 1926 World Series, which the Cardinals won
in seven games over the New York Yankees.
   After finishing his career with the Cards, Toporcer became a
minor-league manager until his eyesight totally failed in 1951. He
wrote an autobiography called ``Baseball From Backlots to Big
Leagues.''

   Percy Bugbee, a pioneer of fire safety who
headed the National Fire Protection Association, died Tuesday at
age 90.
   Bugbee was chairman of the War Department's Advisory Council on
Fire Protection during World War II.
   Under his leadership as general manager from 1939 to 1969, the
association developed and published standards of fire safety that
have become the foundation for all state and ocal fire codes.
   Bugbee's 1978 book, ``Principles of Fire Protection,'' remains
the leading text on fire science in the country.
   Former President Richard Nixon appointed him to the National
Commission on Fire Prevention and Control. Bugbee was a contributor
to the 1973 report ``America Burning,'' which led to establishment
of National Fire Academy.

   Scott Barry, 32, a prominent spokesman for
AIDS victims, died May 11 of the complications of the disease.
   Barry, who had been an exchange student in West Germany,
abandoned his medical studies in Dusseldorf in 1981 after testing
positive for the AIDS virus. He remained in that country as source
of information on the then-new disease, appearing on TV talk shows
and speaking to the German parliament.
   In 1986 Barry was awarded the German Medal of Honor, the
youngest American ever to receive that award.
   In the same year, Barry returned to Los Angeles to form Being
Alive. Being Alive is a support group that has counseled hundreds
of AIDS patients to abandon their isolation and participate as
fully in life as their health permits. He also became a board
member of AIDS Project-Los Angeles.
