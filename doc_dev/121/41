LAST WEEK we told you about an upcoming book titled "All That Glittered: My 
Life With The Supremes" written by the late Florence Ballard's friend and fan, 
Tony Turner. This behind the scenes tell-all didn't have many nice things to 
say about Diana Ross and Berry Gordy Jr. and about Motown's efforts to control 
or silence the volatile and bitter Ballard. 
</P>
<P>
Now Gordy has given his first in-depth interview in 20 years to Rolling Stone, 
an issue due on newsstands Aug. 7. And in light of this latest bashing that he 
and Ross are about to endure, what Gordy has to say to Michael Goldberg about 
the breakup of the Supremes is very interesting indeed: 
</P>
<P>
"It had gotten to the point, as it does in so many groups, when there's a total 
miscommunication between the two factions. The ones in the background were 
having conflicts with the one in front. Diana never wanted to leave the girls, 
particularly. She was more or less pushed out, but that's what happens when a 
person is out front, and people are telling the background singers that she's 
stealing the show. . . . I made the choice who sang lead, and my opinion was 
always that Diana had the magic and Mary Wilson didn't. But Mary felt she 
should be the one, and I said no and favoritism was charged. And it was perhaps 
favoritism because Diana was a favorite of mine." 
</P>
<P>
It must be noted that Berry does not mention Ballard in his overview of the 
rise and fall of The Supremes. Perhaps that is just as well. They parted as 
enemies and Flo was never able to reconcile herself to the fact of Diana Ross's 
charisma, and that it was Ross's appeal that propelled the group to 
super-stardom.

JOHN GOODMAN is possibly the busiest and most popular actor around right now. 
He's currently exterminating spiders in "Arachnophobia," just finished up 
Universal's "King Ralph I" in London and will soon return to the set of ABC's 
hit series "Roseanne" (that is, if his co-star Roseanne Barr, doesn't 
completely self-destruct). 
</P>
<P>
Now comes word that it will be John Goodman in an upcoming big-screen movie 
about the life of baseball legend Babe Ruth. 
</P>
<P>
Film and sports buffs may recall it won't be the first time Ruth's life has 
been given the Hollywood treatment. In 1948 William Bendix portrayed baseball's 
great star in "The Babe Ruth Story." 
</P>
<P>
KEVIN COSTNER is putting the final touches on his "Dances With The Wolves" 
epic, a film which he produced, directed and stars in. While doing this, and 
preparing for his Robin Hood role in "Prince of Thieves," he is mulling over an 
offer from Orion for a sequel to his big hit "Bull Durham."
