   McCuddy's Tavern was built 79 years ago, just in
time to cool the throats of construction workers who were building
a baseball palace for Charles Comiskey's Chicago White Sox.
   On Monday, the scene was reversed: The bar was destroyed to make
room for a new ballpark.
   It was a tearful occasion for Jack Blachley, 12, who once sold
hot dogs at McCuddy's, a baseball landmark and one of Babe Ruth's
favorite hangouts when he came to play the White Sox.
   As the great-great grandson of the tavern's founder pulled the
lever and about 40 McCuddy family members watched somberly,
Speedway Wrecking Co. took the first big chunk out of the small
historic saloon that stood across the street from Comiskey Park.
   Young Jack was too choked up to talk about it at first and hid
his face as he said of the demolition, ``It's stupid.''
   But he later mustered up enough mischievousness to grab a piece
of rubble and shatter the front window, minutes before wreckers
made their final assault on the white, brick building.
   The demolition of McCuddy's was like a funeral, family members
said, but in two years the tavern will be resurrected a block away,
right next to the new Comiskey Park.
   Artifacts from the tavern, including the mahogany bar and
``hundreds of priceless photos from the inception of the team,''
have all been placed in storage and will be used to duplicate the
old tavern's interior in the new bar, Mrs. Blachley said.
   ``I feel very empty,'' said Puddy McCuddy Senese, Jack's
grandmother and grandaughter of John J. McCuddy, who opened the
tavern in 1910. Workers who built the ballpark that year used to
down a few beers on breaks.
   ``It's a very hard thing, it hurts,'' said Mrs. Senese, the
tavern's current owner, as she watched history turn into rubble.
   When the late Bill Veeck owned the White Sox, he used to toss
his wooden leg over a stool at McCuddy's and shoot the bull for
hours.
   When the Yankees were in town in the 1920s and '30s, Ruth would
guzzle a few drinks at the tavern.
   When the McCuddy family home was next door, the Sultan of Swat
``would come over and have dinner with my great-grandmother,'' said
Sheri Blachley, Mrs. Senese's daughter.
   Roast beef and homemade bread were Babe's favorite meals, said
Mrs. Senese. Both women declined to reveal their ages.
   The family home, where both women grew up, was knocked down
along with many other homes as the state cleared the way for
construction of the new ballpark, which will sit on top of the old
tavern site.
   ``I didn't want to come'' to watch the demolition, Mrs. Blachley
said. ``My mother asked me to. She put it this way: `It's only
going to happen once.'''
