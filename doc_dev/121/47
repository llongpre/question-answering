<TEXT>     We spoke to Harry Allen, who calls himself a "hip-hop activist &amp; media
assassin" -- yes, he specifies the ampersand -- and who is also the publicist
for the rap group Public Enemy. (His formal title is Director of Enemy
Relations.) Allen, citing a book called The United Independent Compensatory
CodeSystemConcept, said that rap artists often reject their "government names"
and take on a new name that more adequately addresses their aspirations, and
which is "compensatory" for societal racism. For example, a member of Main
Source calls himself Large Professor -- that's not just a name, it's an
identity.;    "The reason they do it is the same reason that black people
march -- it's compensatory . . . it's making up for racism," says Allen.;   
There's a simpler explanation, too: Whether involved with music or not, young
people in the inner city have often used street names. Tone Loc was born Tony
Smith but was known by his homeboy handle of Tony Loco. When he became a
rapper he changed that to Tone Loc.;     GUESS AGAIN; JOHN GOODMAN IS SLATED
