   John Dale ``Johnny'' Sylvester, who became
the most famous little sick boy in America after Babe Ruth promised
to smack a World Series homer for him _ and hit three _ has died 63
years later. He was 74.
   Sylvester died Monday at a Mineola hospital. No cause of death
was given.
   In 1926, Sylvester was suffering from a serious infection of the
forehead caused by a kick from a horse when he told his father, ``I
wish I could see Babe Ruth wallop a homer before I die.''
   The family sent telegrams to the New York Yankees while they
were playing in St. Louis. Back came an airmail package containing
two baseballs, one autographed by the St. Louis Cardinals, the
other signed by several Yankees, including Ruth, who wrote, ``I'll
knock a homer for you on Wednesday.''
   Ruth hit three that day. In a follow-up note the day of Game 6,
Ruth said he would ``try to knock you another homer, maybe two
today,'' but went homerless. He hit one in Game 7 but it was not
enough to prevent the Yankees from losing the Series. In fact, Ruth
was caught stealing for the final out.
   Ruth visited the Essex Fells, N.J., boy at his bedside after the
Series, a meeting at which Sylvester remarked, ``I'm sorry the
Yanks lost.''
   No miraculous recovery occurred, but the visit certainly did no
harm. It took Sylvester three years before he fully recovered.
Sylvester returned the gesture in 1948, visiting Ruth four months
before the slugger died of cancer.
   The 1926 episode later was part of the movie ``The Babe Ruth
Story,'' but the screen version stretched the truth by having Ruth
make his home run promise at Sylvester's hospital bedside. The boy
apparently was never hospitalized.
   Earlier, in the 1942 movie ``The Pride of the Yankees,''
Hollywood had stretched the tale even further with a promise of two
home runs by Lou Gehrig.
   Sylvester served in the Navy in World War II and was later
president of Amscomatic Inc., a manufacturer of packing machinery.
   He is survived by his son, John Jr., a sister, Ruth Elliott of
Barrington R.I., and a brother, Horace C. Sylvester Jr., of
Osterville, Mass.
