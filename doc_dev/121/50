<LEADPARA>  The most famous asterisk in sports may disappear from the record books if a
baseball committee follows Commissioner Fay Vincent's recommendation to give
full respect to Roger Maris' 30-year-old home run record.;    Vincent wants to
drop Babe Ruth's 60 homers from the record books and give unqualified
recognition to Maris' 61.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Vincent said Thursday that the eight-member committee for statistical
accuracy will meet in September to consider the issue. The panel, chaired by
Vincent, is composed of two other baseball officials, a statistician, two
sportswriters and two professors.;    "I'm inclined . . . to support the
single-record thesis, and that is Maris hit more home runs in a season than
anyone else," said Vincent, who was inspired by a Roger Angell article in May
27's New Yorker.;    The issue was first decided by Commissioner Ford Frick on
July 17, 1961, when Maris had 35 homers and was three weeks ahead of Ruth's
pace.;    Maris hit his 61st home run in the New York Yankees' final game of
the season. It was the first year of the expansion era, and the schedule had
been expanded to 162 games from 154, its length when Ruth hit 60 for the
Yankees in 1927.;    Frick died in 1978, Maris in 1985.;    For the record,
there is no actual asterisk. Therecord books list both marks -- with a
notation.  </TEXT>
