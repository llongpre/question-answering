</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1925, Miller Huggins' New York Yankees were on their way to a seventh-place 
finish. At one point, the Yankees fell 18 games below .500. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Yankees of Manager Bucky Dent (well, at least he was manager when this 
newspaper went to press) repose 14 games behind the American League 
East-leading Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
Yankee fans may draw some comfort from that. But look closely. There is no 
comfort there. The '89 Yanks have equaled a record for futility, but they are 
by no means the equal of the '25 club. Not even close. 
</P>
<P>
This Yankee team has descended to an intolerable position. It is duller than 50 
gallons of dishwater. Poor play and losing go in cycles. Eventually, the 
Yankees will be up again. But because of the tension, instability and panicky 
disorganization that exists throughout, it may take many years. 
</P>
<P>
But dullness is unforgivable in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
The Yanks of 1989 will avoid last place only because of the Detroit Tigers, who 
have died this season of natural causes. The Yankees have been murdered by 
their owner and their own hands. 
</P>
<P>
The 1925 team finished 69-85. Yankee fans stayed away. After drawing more than 
1 million fans for five consecutive seasons, attendance fell to 697,000. But 
dullness was not a problem. Huggins was in the middle of an 11 1/2-year tenure. 
Before George Steinbrenner, a Yankee manager's position was relatively safe as 
long as he did the job. Huggins, Joe McCarthy, Casey Stengel and Ralph Houk all 
managed 10 years or more, although Houk's term was divided in two parts, ending 
in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
One difference between the Yankees of 1925 and 1989 is the difference between 
Miller Huggins and Bucky Dent. Huggins was tough, seasoned and in full command. 
Dent is hanging timidly around until the ax connects with his fully exposed 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 Yanks don't have hope. Isn't that awful? No hope. Only dullness and 
certain uncertainty. They lost 19-5 to the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
The 1925 Yanks allowed 19 runs in a game, too, losing 19-1 to Detroit in 
mid-June. But they were only pausing to pull their feet out of the mud during 
that season and everyone knew it. In the next three years, they would win three 
pennants and two world championships. 
</P>
<P>
June 1, 1925 was a significant date for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
It was on that day that Lou Gehrig replaced Wally Pipp at first base. Some 
2,130 games later, the Iron Horse came out of the lineup. It was also the day 
Babe Ruth was inserted into the Yankee lineup for his first game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press ignored Gehrig but reported this on Ruth in The Courant on 
June 2: "In the clean-up position of the Yankees batting order again after 
almost two months' confinement to a hospital with influenza and indigestion, 
Ruth's opening successes were limited to fielding features." 
</P>
<P>
Walter Johnson was pitching that day for the first-place Washington Senators, 
who in October would lose the World Series in seven games to the Pittsburgh 
Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
Ruth would play 98 games, hit 25 homers and drive in 66 runs in his curtailed 
season. That was expected. Gehrig had played 13 games for the Yanks in 1923 and 
10 in 1924. No one could forsee his magnificant baseball future when he 
replaced Pipp on that day. But in the ensuing 126 games he hit 20 homers and 
knocked in 68 runs, batting .295. Oh, these Yankees had hope all right. 
</P>
<P>
The next year they had a rookie second baseman, Tony "Poosh 'em Up" Lazzeri, 
who was ready. He played 155 games. Ruth hit 47 homers, Gehrig 16 with 107 RBI. 
Leadoff man Earle Combs had a solid season and the pitching, anchored by 
veteran Herb Pennock (23-11), was sound as a 1925 gold piece. The Yanks won 91, 
lost 63 and although they lost the series to the St. Louis Cardinals and 
39-year-old Grover Cleveland Alexander, the dynasty was reestablished. 
</P>
<P>
The next season they won 110, and the next 101. 
</P>
<P>
Today's Yankees are sliding more and more rapidly backward. They have some fine 
players -- Don Mattingly, Steve Sax, Bob Geren, Dave Righetti, Roberto Kelly, 
Jesse Barfield -- but they don't have hope. It is not a team that can hope for 
anything except avoiding the cellar this year, and little else next. 1990 will 
not be like 1926 for the Yankees. They don't have the weapons or the will to 
make the needed commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Too much trouble. Too much Steinbrenner. Too much dullness. Shame, shame, 
shame.
