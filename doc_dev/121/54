<TEXT>  HarperCollins, 333 pp., $21.95; IN HIS introduction to "I Had a Hammer,"
co-author Lonnie Wheeler admits that other writers warned him about trying to
do Aaron's life because the baseball superstar has never had much to say.
Wheeler went ahead in the belief that "no life of such accomplishment and
eloquence could fail to produce a book of importance." Wheeler was right, but
he has written a book that manages to convey the accomplishment only
adequately.;    The accomplishments are inescapable. Aaron's career spanned
and illustrated significant changes in the game and society. As Wheeler
writes, "The man played in the major leagues from Williams to Yount, from
Kiner to Schmidt, from Eisenhower and Khrushchev to Carter and Khomeini, from
Hemingway and Steinbeck to Woodward and Bernstein; from James Dean to Jack
Nicholson, Elvis to Elton John, Nat Cole to Natalie, and Sugar Ray to Sugar
Ray, from Jackie Robinson to Jackie Onassis; from the fifteen-cent hamburger
to the fifteen-cent stamp; from the four-minute mile to the four-minute
dinner." Yet it remains news to even serious baseball fans that Henry Aaron is
the best hitter in professional baseball history, not Pete Rose, Ted Williams,
Willie Mays or Joe DiMaggio. The one-time crosshand-hitting, skinny shortstop
in the Negro American League hit his way through history, into history. His
dramatic assault on Babe Ruth's all-time home run record forced baseball and
America to confront their racism and hypocrisy.;    Unfortunately, Aaron's
personality is too clearly reflected in the tone of the book. Henry Aaron is
an intense, private, persistent personality. A teammate describes him as
totally in control of his emotions. He only appeared so, but because he
appeared so, Henry Aaron's monumental baseball career is nearly always
underestimated. Even though he understood why he was overlooked, Henry Aaron
just hit. "Because I was black, and because I never moved faster than I had
to, and because I didn't speak Ivy League English, I came into the league with
an image of a backward country kid who could swing a bat and was lucky he
didn't have to think too much." That overlooked, smart-as-a-fox country boy
ignored the slights and quietly stayed atop a very tough profession for 23
years, had 3,771 hits (that's a lot), 755 home runs (that's the most) and most
amazingly 6,856 total bases (more than 700 bases beyond the next player). He
was also a defensive star, base-stealer and model citizen and teammate.;   
The irony of Henry Aaron's life is that his black and poor beginnings in the
Deep South empowered him with the ability to be invisible necessary to succeed
in a hostile culture, but at the same time created a style unable to draw
attention to his accomplishments. Where Willie Mays did everything with such
verve that he demanded our eye, Aaron just hit. Day after day, in the face of
beanballs and death threats, sliders and slurs, in sickness and in pain, he
hit. That is the greatness in this book, but I'm not sure enough people will
appreciate it. Our culture seems to prefer flash, peak experience, charisma,
and under-appreciate the efficient secretary, committed relationship or
under-successful old friend.;    Although the book's stated purpose is to
carry on the cause of Jackie Robinson, the man who integrated baseball, and be
a reminder of the ordeal demanded of a man of color in a racist society, there
is little new here. "Our mission -- and that's the only thing to call it --
was to do something with the chance we had." Still, "I Had a Hammer" adds to
the details that can be filed under American Racism, Sports, Aaron. I was
surprised to learn that baseballs pitched to Aaron as he neared the home run
record were stamped with infrared numbers, so authenticity of the souvenirs
could be assured; that Aaron's first major league game was the first where
fielders were not allowed to leave their gloves on the field when they came to
bat; that the National League dominance in the All-Star game was racially
motivated; that Babe Ruth was often called "nigger" because of his broad-nosed
features.;    The book is, like Aaron, persistent and plodding. The
straightforward narrative, the gentle telling of stories, the simple repeated
themes provide only shadows of the man. Aaron's presence is felt, if not seen,
towering over the writing.;    In keeping the focus on the racial aspects of
Henry Aaron's life, I'm afraid the authors have missed some of the eloquence.
Aaron's life is not just that of a black man in a racist society; his success
is more universal. The challenges he faced were more common. So when Aaron
reaches the realization of his quest, the reader should feel a part of it.
Instead Aaron gropes for the words. "I knew what the past twenty-five years of
my life had been all about. I had done something that nobody else in the world
had ever done, and with it came a feeling that nobody else has ever had -- not
exactly, anyway. I didn't feel a wild sense of joy. I didn't feel like
celebrating. But I probably felt closer to God at that moment than at any
other in my life. I felt a deep sense of gratitude and a wonderful surge of
liberation all at the same time. I also felt a stream of tears running down my
face.";     Aaron took the thing he loved to do, the circumstances he faced
and his desire for dignity -- and made history. It is every person's
challenge. In this book it seems it is only a challenge to be black and play
baseball, or to be Southern and get respect. If I had a hammer, that's the
pointed message I'd like to see pounded into this book. (box)  </TEXT>
