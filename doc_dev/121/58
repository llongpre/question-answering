<LEADPARA>  The Chicago Cubs ruined the Giants' attempt to recreate a 1920s atmosphere at
Candlestick Park on Sunday by refusing to wear vintage uniforms.;    Credit
the Cubbies, however, for prompting the most amusing part of the day: Giants
third baseman Matt Williams' unscheduled pregame rendition of Babe Ruth's
historic "called" home run.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The Cubs sent their bat boy over to tell me to do it," Williams said after
the Giants' dramatic ninth-inning rally for a 2-1 win. "That started it. Then
our guys said, 'C'mon.' I was about as embarrassed as I could be.";    Five
minutes before the opening pitch, Williams, who is known for his talent at
mimicry, trotted out to home plate with a warm-up jacket stuck inside his
jersey to assimilate Ruth's belly. The crowd's roar as he pointed his bat at
the bleachers quickly turned to laughter after he swatted an imaginary pitch
and circled the bases in the Bambino's stilted, mincing shuffle.;    Williams
said those tiny steps were exhausting.;    "I was gassed by the time I got
back to the plate," he said. "The Babe must've been in some kind of shape. I
was looking for a beer and a hotdog when I got back to the dugout.";   
Williams added a nice touch by motioning at the Cubs' bench with outstretched
arms and upturned palms as he rounded third, as if to say, "Stay where you
are.";    "That's on the film," Williams said. "It's where he tells them to
sit down.";    The uniform also helped. The Giants wore replicas of the New
York Giants' uniforms in the 1920s, complete with horizontally striped socks,
pin-striped caps with short blue bills and snow-white uniforms with
elbow-length sleeves.;    But Williams' imitation did nothing for starting
pitcher John Burkett's "game face.";    "It was a little strange to be
laughing and having fun five minutes before the game," Burkett said.;   
Relief pitcher Jeff Brantley, who earned the win by pitching a scoreless ninth
inning, was among several Giants who were disappointed that the Cubs did not
take part in the game's "Turn Back The Clock" theme. The Giants did what they
could. They used an old wooden scoreboard with several men in knickers putting
up the numbered boards. The on-deck circles were hand-painted with simple
white paint, in place of the ornate team insignias. A barbershop chorus sang
the national anthem, and an announcer gave the lineups on the field through an
over-sized striped megaphone.;    "It would've been a lot nicer if the Cubs
had participated," said catcher Steve Decker. "Maybe they would've been a
little more lucky.";    They certainly would've made more points with several
fans, including Alan Libin of Encino and Colin Cabral of Burbank. The two said
they drove from the Los Angeles area Saturday night specifically to see the
Giants play in their vintage uniforms.;    "I wish they'd all go back to the
old-style uniforms," said Libin, 24. "We came up here because the Dodgers
aren't doing it.";    "It kind of stinks," said Paul Garvey, a San Franciscan
who bridged the gap by wearing a 1951 Giants warm-up jacket and Giants beach
shorts. "I think Major League Baseball should've stepped in and made the Cubs
dress up."  </TEXT>
