<TEXT>     "He's like a turkey in a tobacco patch that sees a worm," the late Branch
Rickey told Sports Illustrated, "and knocks down every stalk to get it . . .
";   Durocher was loud, profane and, when he wanted to be, charming. He was
the first of the celebrity managers, and he traveled with other celebrities.; 
 "Leo was my idol," Los Angeles Dodgers Manager Tom Lasorda said Monday after
learning Durocher, 86, had died of natural causes in Palm Springs. "I took his
number (2) because of the love, admiration and respect I had for him.";  
Durocher roomed with actor George Raft, was married three times, including
once to actress Laraine Day, and ran around with Frank Sinatra. His
relationship with Raft was a factor in Durocher's one-year suspension from
baseball in 1947. Durocher always claimed that Commissioner Happy Chandler
banished him without cause, and there was no evidence to indicate otherwise.; 
 Hank Sauer, the Chicago Cubs slugger of the 1940s and early 1950s who often
found Durocher infuriating as an opponent but equally charming as a companion,
said Durocher was ever-feisty in old age. "He was no different in golf," Sauer
said. "He would do everything in the world to win $10 from you. Then he'd buy
dinner for $50.";   Durocher played 12 full seasons and parts of four others
in the major leagues. His big league career officially began in 1928, when he
was among Babe Ruth's teammates with the New York Yankees. He also was a
member of the 1934 St. Louis Cardinals, the Gas House Gang. He was a superior
shortstop but an average hitter with a .247 lifetime average.;   He gained
greater prominence during his 25-year managerial career. Three of his teams
won pennants and one -- those 1954 New York Giants who swept the favored
Cleveland Indians -- a world championship.;   Five of his 1950 Giants -- Eddie
Stanky, Alvin Dark, Whitey Lockman, Wes Westrum and Bill Rigney -- became
managers.;   "He could take a club destined to finish in the second division,
and he'd lose interest," Rigney said. "But give him a chance to run for the
roses, and he'd give everything he had.;   "One-third of the club would be
scared to death of him. One-third weren't sure. And then there was the
one-third who knew him and understood him.";   His first year of managing was
1939, when he also played 116 games at shortstop for Brooklyn. His 1941
Dodgers won the pennant.;   It was while managing the Dodgers that Durocher
said, "Nice guys finish last." He said it of Mel Ott, never dreaming that in
1948, the year he returned from his year's suspension for associating with
"unsavory" people, he would replace Ott as Giants manager.;   In 1951, his
Giants made what is still regarded as the most dramatic comeback in baseball
history, overhauling the Dodgers after being 13 1/2 games behind in August.
That also was the year Willie Mays entered the majors.;   "It was like a
father-son involvement," Mays said. "When I came to Leo in '51, I was very
shy. The people in Minneapolis had built me up, and I must have been very
scared.;   "When I didn't hit when I first came up, he said to me that I was
his center fielder as long as he was here. He gave me the confidence, saying
hey, they're no different here.";   Three years later, with Mays in his first
full season after military duty, the Giants repeated as league champions and
dismantled the Indians in the World Series.;   In 1955, Durocher abruptly quit
the Giants and joined NBC. He remained out of baseball for five years,
returning in 1961 as a coach with the Los Angeles Dodgers.;   In 1966,
Durocher was named to manage the Chicago Cubs, turning them into pennant
contenders in the late 1960s.;   His last managerial job in the majors was
with Houston, in 1973. Claiming he couldn't relate to the modern player,
Durocher retired after the 1973 season.;   Mays and Durocher remained friends.
They owned houses near each other in Palm Springs, and they performed in four
or five card shows a year. One recurrent conversation was the Hall of Fame
Committee's snub of Durocher.;   "I think he was living for that," Mays said.
"He said to me many times that he'd just wished they'd say, 'Leo, you're in.'
";   Durocher told a close friend two weeks ago that he had instructed his
lawyer to refuse his induction if he were chosen posthumously.;   "It was the
one thing that bothered Leo right to the end," said Buzzie Bavasi, the
longtime baseball executive who went to work in the Dodgers organization in
1938.;   "He didn't want to go in (to the Hall) after he died," Bavasi said
Monday. "He told me just two weeks ago that he'd instructed his lawyer not to
accept it if they put him in after he was gone. He was so mad at the world.;  
"I think he said it in a fit of anger. I can't believe he meant it, but he
said it.";   Former Dodgers pitcher Don Drysdale said, "He belongs in the Hall
of Fame, but if he ever gets into the Hall it will be like so many other
deserving people . . . it always seems they get in after they die.";
