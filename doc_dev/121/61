Billy Joel says he can't wait to play Yankee Stadium -- he'll be playing music 
and a little baseball on the field where Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, 
Mickey Mantle and other greats once performed. 
</P>
<P>
Two popes and several heavyweight fights have sold out the stadium, but Yankees 
officials say the native New Yorker and five-time Grammy winner will be the 
first rocker to headline a show there when he appears June 22. 
</P>
<P>
Other bands have played there following Yankee games.

"It's the House that Ruth Built, man. It's a magic place," Joel said in a 
telephone interview from Chicago. "The day we set up, I'm going to walk out to 
the mound and do a little pitching, maybe shag a few flies." 
</P>
<P>
His piano will be set up in left-center field.
