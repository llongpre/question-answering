The Lexington Avenue express is not the only means of getting to Yankee
Stadium, but it is by far the most satisfying. The subway train rumbles
through Harlem and under the Bronx River to emerge blinking into the
sunlight alongside the great ballpark. As the train pulls into the 161st
Street station, the appetite is whetted by a tantalising glimpse between the
stands of the lush grass in rightfield.
As I stepped off the train last week, I experienced the familiar rush of
excitement as thousands of other baseball fans walked up River Avenue to
join the long lines at the ticket booths. The division-leading Yankees, who
this season have been playing their best baseball in 13 years, were at home
to the Cleveland Indians, and Yankee Stadium seemed the perfect place to be
in New York on a warm Saturday afternoon in mid-summer.
At Dollars 11.50 a seat, watching the Yankees is not cheap, but for that you
get an upper deck seat in the sun, three or more hours of major league
baseball, and a big, lovely slice of history.
Yankee Stadium is not just any old sports ground. It is known as 'The House
that Ruth Built', after the great Babe Ruth, whose exploits attracted the
huge crowds which ultimately paid for the stadium's construction. When it
opened in 1923, Yankee Stadium was the wonder of the sports world, with its
imposing entrance and spectacular two-tier stands. It remains so today, even
after a mid-1970s facelift that changed much of the way it looks but which,
thankfully, left history intact.
The seats high in the upper deck afforded a splendid view. As the Yankee
players jogged out for the opening inning against Cleveland, the bright
white of their uniforms sparkled against the green of the outfield and the
brown earth of the diamond-shaped basepaths. While the outfielders languidly
tossed balls around as they awaited the arrival of the Indians' first
batter, I bought a hot dog from one of the vendors who roam the stands
shouting 'Dawgs - Who Wants Dawgs?' in mustard-thick accents.
Yet my enjoyment of the game was marred by the certain knowledge that the
Yankees' great run of 1994 was heading for a premature end. This was not
because I had had some premonition that the team was going to stop playing
the smart, unfussy baseball that had taken it to the top of the table, but
because I knew the team was going to stop playing, full stop.
Just days before the Cleveland game, the players' union had announced plans
for an indefinite strike, starting on August 12, to protest against the
baseball owners insistence on including in the new labour contract a salary
cap - a limit on the total amount each team can pay its players.
The owners, who have been unable to agree among themselves on how to divide
baseball's revenues so that the clubs in smaller cities such as Milwaukee,
Pittsburgh and San Diego are not forced into extinction trying to compete
with the wealthy, big-spending clubs in cities such as New York, Chicago,
and Los Angeles, view the salary cap as a way of controlling their
rapidly-escalating costs. The players regard the cap as an infringement of
the free market and oppose pay limits.
Yesterday, the union made good on its threat, and the 1994 season - so far a
marvellous one, full of promise, not just for the Yankees but for other
teams, and for several players who are poised to break some of baseball's
oldest records - came to an inglorious halt.
The strike is maddening. Irrespective of the merits, or otherwise, of the
players' actions, there is something ludicrous about millionaire sportsmen
striking against multi-millionaire owners in an argument over money.
As anyone who watches a game or reads the sports pages knows, there is
plenty of money in baseball. The average salary for a player is Dollars 1.2m
(Pounds 770,000) a year. Revenues from attendance, television contracts and
merchandising total almost Dollars 2bn a year. And the 28 teams of Major
League Baseball are estimated to be worth a combined Dollars 2.5bn. With
that much money swilling around, it is remarkable that a way cannot be found
to share the bounty of America's national game.
Not only is the strike ludicrous, but there should be a law against it.
Indeed, were it any other US sport there would be: earlier this summer,
baseball managed to fight off an attempt in Congress to overturn its
precious, and unique, exemption from anti-trust laws. Both the owners and
the players have overlooked something important in their dispute: the fans.
It is they, after all, who pay everyone's wages.
This may be a cliche, but it is true. The players are not paid millions of
dollars because a home run, a strike, or a great catch are of themselves
valuable commodities. Gold, oil, copper - these are valuable commodities. A
home run is valuable because people are willing to pay to see it happen,
either in the flesh or on television. If people were not willing to pay to
watch big league baseball, players could hit all the home runs they wanted
but would still never earn a cent.
Everyone in the business of baseball is party to a three-sided contract
between the players, the owners, and the fans. The players have broken that
contract. The owners are equally culpable for having made such a hash of
their own affairs. The fans should sue.
If they do not sue (and this being America, someone probably will), fans
will be left to do what they spend much of the year doing anyway - moaning
about the greedy players and greedier owners. A few were energised enough
this week to plan a fans' strike, but little came of it. Why? Because fans -
the poor pathetic things they are - love baseball, even if baseball does not
love them. Thursday was the last chance to see a game before the shutters
came down, and hundreds of thousands paid to do just that.
Now the baseball bats are silent. Yankee Stadium should have been alive this
Saturday with the sound of 40,000 fans cheering on their team against the
world champions from Toronto. Instead, the great ballpark will be deserted.
And the Lexington express from Manhattan will rumble past almost empty. All
that will be on offer at Yankee Stadium is that inviting glimpse of the
lush, green grass in rightfield.
