   Now playing center field at Yankee Stadium ...
Billy Joel.
   The five-time Grammy winner, whose most recent album is the
former No. 1 ``Storm Front,'' will become the first rocker to
headline a show at the stadium, as far as New York Yankees
officials can determine. Two popes and several heavyweight fights
have sold out the stadium, but no musical acts.
   Joel will play a June 22 concert at the Bronx ballpark, the
playground of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio and Mickey
Mantle, to name a few. His piano will be set up in left-center
field.
   The show, for an expected 57,000 fans, will be a homecoming for
the native New Yorker.
   ``It's the House that Ruth Built, man. It's a magic place,''
Joel said in a telephone interview from Chicago. ``The day we set
up, I'm going to walk out to the mound and do a little pitching,
maybe shag a few flies.''
   The show will be part of Joel's second swing through the United
States on a tour that began last year. On May 5, he begins a
one-month European tour.
   Joel, who early in his career played under the nom-de-tune Billy
Martin, said there's a possibility of a second show at the stadium
if the first sells out.
   The show will be co-promoted by Yankees owner George
Steinbrenner, whose biggest concern was the Yankees infield.
   Joel, who first visited the stadium for a late '50s World Series
game, agreed. ``That's understandable. That grass is sacrosanct,''
he said.
   Joel's group will not be the first band to play at the stadium.
The Beach Boys and the Charlie Daniels Band have performed
following Yankee games in recent years.
