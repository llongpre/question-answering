   Actress Karen Austin says she hasn't quite found
the words to describe what it was like to work with screen legend
Katharine Hepburn in the NBC movie ``Laura Lansing Slept Here,''
but she gives it a shot.
   ``I was intimidated, I was exhilarated, I was overwhelmed, I was
inspired, all those things. I don't know, it's like a kid getting
to play baseball with Babe Ruth,'' said Austin. The made-for-TV
movie airs Monday.
   ``She has a great sense of humor about herself. She has no
reverence about herself as an icon. The fact that other people
regard her so highly is, I think, a source of benign amusement for
her.''
   Austin, who starred in the first season of ``Night Court'' and
later had a recurring role on ``St. Elsewhere,'' plays Melody
Gomphers, a suburban housewife whose life is turned upside-down
when a publisher bets a fabulously wealthy novelist that she can't
stand to live with a typical American family for a week.
   ``It's a gentle comedy,'' Austin says. ``You can imagine her
descending on suburbia in full sail, with chauffeur and luggage.
It's a great part for her, and she's costumed wonderfully, hats and
Tibetan jewelry and exotic clothes. I kept my hair in a braid,
little housedress. It was kind of fun finding a character that was
realistic, but also would contrast well with her. That was my aim,
really, was to be a backdrop as much as anything for her, a
springboard.''
   Hepburn plays Laura Lansing, a famous, relentlessly spunky
author whose publisher (Lee Richardson) says she should give up
writing because she's lost touch with the common people.
   He bets her she can't stand to stay for a week with the
Gompherses and their three children in their little tract house in
Hicksville on Long Island.
   It's a cute movie. Lansing expects to find a little gingham
world, not a soap-opera plot with a philandering husband, crabby
kids and a rebellious teen-ager on the road to juvenile delinquency.
   For their part, the Gompherses are awe-struck when their famous
guest arrives, cowing them to the point that they sit silently in
the living room, terrified to turn on the television or make any
noise that would disturb her.
   ``Is this what you do in the evening,'' Lansing asks innocently
when she emerges to find them all lined up on the sofa, ``sit in
silent meditation?''
   Joel Higgins plays Walter Gomphers. Schuyler Grant, who is
Hepburn's grand-niece in real life, plays the Gomphers' teen-age
daughter. Sean Harmon plays their prepubescent son, and twins Ryan
and Kyle Comber play 17-month-old Malcolm.
   ``Katharine's grand-niece (Grant) and I used to sit around,''
said Austin, ``and I would try to explain to her, because to her
it's just Aunt Katie, but I would try and explain to her what it
was like for me to work with her aunt.''
   In real life, Hepburn did descend on suburbia in Vancouver where
the movie was shot last year.
   ``The neighbors actually would go away when we asked them to,''
Austin says with wonder. ``They'd be crowding over the fence taking
pictures, and she'd say, `Go away, now. Go away, don't do that.'
And they would actually leave. They were so polite and respectful.
You can imagine what they would do in New York City?''
   Hepburn, Austin said, ``knows what quality is, and it's great to
be around someone whose standards will not be compromised, and who
has the clout to just say, `Well, we can't do it this way,' and
everybody says, `Well, we can't, I guess we can't.' And then it
gets done right. It's great.''

   Elsewhere in television:
   `LATE NIGHT' IN LONDON, `TODAY' ON ORIENT EXPRESS _ ``Late Night
with David Letterman'' has settled on dates for its London run, May
3-6, at the Victoria Palace Theatre. Though Britons have been able
to see ``Late Night'' once a week since last year, they won't see
the four London shows until sometime in the future. Says producer
Robert Morton, ``We plan to do basically the same program we do
here in New York, except that we'll have new audiences that
hopefully speak the same language we do.'' The following week,
NBC's ``Today'' show will do five shows from aboard the famed
train, the Orient Express, starting in Paris with stops in Zurich,
Munich, Vienna and Venice. ...
   LEMMON SALUTE _ ``The American Film Institute Salute to Jack
Lemmon'' is being taped March 10 for airing later this spring on
CBS. Julie Andrews, who starred with Lemmon in Blake Edwards'
``That's Life,'' will be the host. The producer is George Stevens
Jr., who produced Lemmon's recent miniseries on NBC, ``The Murder
of Mary Phagan.''
