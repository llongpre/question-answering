<LEADPARA>  Our mystery celebrity (guess who he is and win the usual prize) is somewhat
older today than we see him here. This shot was taken in 1948 and probably was
on the sports pages of the time, particularly those on the East Coast. Even a
casual baseball fan will recognize Babe Ruth in the center -- he died that
year -- but only the true baseball historian can name the man with whom he is
shaking hands. He's Ethan Allen, a major leaguer in earlier decades but a
university baseball coach when this shot was taken. At left, our hero is
holding the manuscript for "The Baby Ruth Story" which the Bambino was
presenting to Yale's coach and its starting first baseman, George Bush.  </LEADPARA>
