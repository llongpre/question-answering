<LEADPARA>  In the last couple of seasons, Mark McGwire has changed his contacts, his
approach, his attitude, anything anybody thought might help.;    But McGwire
hasn't been able to hitch up his batting average to a number he wouldn't be
embarrassed to see next to his name on a scoreboard.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     McGwire could still hold his head up after he hit .231 in 1989. After all,
33 homers and 95 RBIs were nothing to be ashamed about. But then, he followed
that up with a .235 average in 1990. And even 39 homers, 108 RBIs and a Gold
Glove for his defensive work at first base didn't divert attention from
McGwire's average.;    Four seasons into his career, it's certain McGwire will
go down as a prodigious home-run hitter. But there's also the possibility that
he'll become known as a Dave Kingman type, a slugger who couldn't hit for
average. And then, there's the question of whether it really matters if Mark
McGwire hits .235 for the rest of his career, as long as he keeps crushing
homers and collecting 100-RBI seasons.;    While he's working with renewed
purpose again this spring to improve his average, McGwire insists that it
really isn't significant.;    "I don't think it does matter. It really
doesn't. If I played on another ballclub, I don't think it'd matter one bit,"
he said. "But because of the team I play on and because we're in the public
eye so much, something has to be written about me.;    "The only thing they've
talked about is my batting average. There might be one mention about my first
year. You know, I've set a few records that might or might not be broken. But
if you really look at it, I don't know if that many people know that.";   
Right now, McGwire is keeping better company than Kingman in baseball record
books. He demolished the rookie record with 49 homers in 1987; he became the
first player to reach 30 homers in each of his first four full seasons in
1990. His home-run ratio of one per 13.9 at-bats is second in history to Babe
Ruth's 11.8. Babe Ruth.;    And thanks to the .289 McGwire hit as a rookie and
his .260 average in 1988, his lifetime average isn't shabby at .253. Harmon
Killebrew took 573 homers and a .256 average into the Hall of Fame. But
Kingman finished with 442 homers and a .236 average, and there's some doubt
about how he'll be received by Hall of Fame voters.;    "I think he has the
capabilities of hitting for a higher average than he has the last two years.
It has nothing to do with ability. He has all the ability in the world," says
new A's hitting coach Rick Burleson. "I honestly believe that if he continues
with his approach the way it's been going the last couple of seasons, he'll
still put productive numbers up. But he might not hit again for the average
that the A's would like to see and that Mark McGwire would like to see.";   
In a lot of ways, McGwire still has to live with 1987 and probably will for
the rest of his career.;    "I think (1990) was a pretty good year. I think
pretty much my last three years have been pretty good years, but they've been
overshadowed because of '87, they've been overshadowed because of the players
we've had on our team," McGwire said. "It's going to be like that for Cecil
Fielder. He's going to live with it from now on. 'Can you ever hit 51 (homers)
again?' Chances are really not that good, because it doesn't happen that
often.;    "It's funny. I don't ever regret it. But sometimes, I wish I just
had a pretty good year instead of the great year that I did have.";    Over
the last four seasons, pitchers have adjusted their approach to McGwire. And
McGwire himself changed. When his stroke is right, he uses more of the field.
But he has become a dead-pull hitter. According to the Elias Baseball Analyst,
43 percent of the balls McGwire hit to the outfield last season went to left.
McGwire and Gary Gaetti had the fewest hits to the opposite field (11) of
American League players with 100 or more hits.;    It makes a certain sense,
says A's coach Reggie Jackson, who knows a little something about power
hitting.;    "He's gotten home run conscious. When you're successful -- and
success in the game today is winning and making money -- it's real hard to say
you're not doing the right thing when your team has been in the World Series
three years in a row, you've led the league in home runs and you're making $3
million a year," Jackson said. "We've got to get him to have success out there
(in center and right), because he's making a real good living hitting the ball
to left field.;    "He's forgotten about hitting the ball away from him. And
the reason he's been able to do that is because he has tremendous success
hitting the ball out of the ballpark. He's not covering the outside part of
the plate.";    McGwire has a good concept about the strike zone. He walked
110 times and struck out 116 in 1990. His on-base percentage was .370. For
comparison's sake, Willie McGee, who won the National League batting title
with a .335 average, had a .373 on-base percentage playing for the St. Louis
Cardinals and the A's last season.;    And A's Manager Tony La Russa knows
there could be a fine line between improving McGwire's average and
overemphasizing its importance.;    "You've got to keep things in perspective.
What's of highest significance is his production. You don't want to do
anything to take away from that, become too batting average conscious," La
Russa said. "But you don't want to be careless with at-bats.";    Burleson is
convinced that if McGwire buys this approach -- and McGwire says it is a
return to old ways for him -- he won't be a .230 hitter.;    "It's a slow
process. You don't go to a player of his stature, his ability, the things that
he's done in the game his first four years, and say you have to do this. You
have to take it one step at a time," Burleson said.;  MAKING HIS HITS COUNT;
