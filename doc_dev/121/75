   Iron man Lou Gehrig will be featured on a new
commemorative postage stamp this summer, the Postal Service reported
Tuesday.
   The stamp honoring the former New York Yankees hitter will be
issued June 10 at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.
   Gehrig played a record 2,130 consecutive games, batting cleanup
behind slugger Babe Ruth in the Yankees' famous ``Murderer's Row''
lineup.
   During his career, Gehrig hit 493 home runs, driving in 100 or
more runs 13 seasons in a row and batting .340 lifetime.
   Gehrig took the field for the Yankees June 2, 1925, and didn't
miss a game until May 2, 1939, after he was diagnosed as suffering
from the fatal disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. That disease
has since come to be known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
