<LEADPARA>  THE worst reason to read "A Whole Different Ball Game" (Birch Lane Press) by
Marvin Miller is historical importance. The irresistible reason is that it's a
well-paced combination of inside information and caustic fun.;    Miller is
the former executive director of the Major League Baseball Players
Association, but putting it that simply is a bit like saying that Babe Ruth
was a famous player. And, for anybody who insists on reviewing Miller only in
relation to his impact on the game, the comparison with Ruth, noted on the
book jacket, is apt. In fact, Miller probably was more important than the Babe.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Miller's role in all the changes that sometimes seem to define baseball
-- free agents and calculator-straining salaries, strikes, lockouts and
arbitration -- might be better described and evaluated by a more objective
writer. What makes his book worth buying right now, in hardcover, is a biting
style and an appreciation for humor, eccentricity and athletes.;    For sheer
sharpness, you can start with the chapter called "Bowie Kuhn Was Not in the
Best Interests of Baseball.";    "His moves," declares Miller, "consistently
backfired; his attempts at leadership created divisions. His inability to
distinguish between reality and his prejudices, his lack of concern for the
rights of players, sections of the press, and even of the stray, unpopular
owner -- all combined to make Kuhn a vital ingredient in the growth and
strength of the union. To paraphrase Voltaire on God, if Bowie Kuhn had never
existed, we would have had to invent him.";    For a smile, turn to the
section on Charlie Finley in the "Owners and Other Bosses" chapter. It
includes Miller's reminiscence of a dinner with Finley at a seafood
restaurant.;    "So here we were seated in one of New York's finer fish
houses, and the man is unwrapping and handing to the waiter a slab of snapper
he had just bought at a fish market. (Though now that I think of it, I could
be selling him short; he may have caught it himself.) Finley, we found out,
didn't trust restaurants to serve him fresh fish, so he made special
arrangements with restaurants in different coastal cities. Charlie selected
his own fish at waterfront markets, carried it to the restaurant, and let them
prepare it.";    Some telling passages are very short: the story of how Mickey
Mantle allowed the union to use his name as leverage, even though he had
decided to retire, is one paragraph. Some chapters are concise, but crammed
with insight: Every memorabilia collector should read "Card Wars," which
explains the end of the Topps monopoly.;    Yes, it's important history. But
even better, it's a highly personal, tough-minded and entertaining reflection
on people as well as events.  </TEXT>
