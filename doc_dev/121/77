<DESCRIPT>  SPORT; BRIEF  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  Hank Aaron says the period in 1973 and 1974 when he closed in on Babe Ruth's
career home-run record was a time he'd like to forget.;    "The Ruth chase
should have been the greatest period of my life and it was the worst," Aaron
writes in his new autobiography, "I Had a Hammer."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I couldn't believe there was so much hatred in people. I'm still trying to
get over it.";    Aaron, who finished with a record 755 home runs, needed a
bodyguard as he neared Ruth's record of 714. He received death threats and
hate mail, some of which he printed in his book.;    "I have a contract out on
you," one threat read. "Over 700 and you can consider yourself punctured with
a .22 shell. If by the All-Star Game you have come within 20 homers of Babe,
you will be shot on sight by one of my assassins on July 24, 1973.";    Aaron
said such letters only inspired him.;    "I kept feeling," he wrote, "that I
had to break the record not only for myself and for Jackie Robinson and for
black people, but also to strike back at the vicious little people who wanted
to keep me from doing it.";     Sherrill looks to students for kickoff help;
Now, when Mississippi State football coach Jackie Sherrill says "student body
right," he means it.;    Sherrill is looking for some hard-nosed student
volunteers to play on the Bulldogs' kickoff team.;    Sherrill is borrowing
the "12th Man" idea he used as head coach at Texas A&amp;M.;    "We had 252
students sign up the first year," he said. "The kickoff team turned out to be
one of the main reasons for turning around our program there.";    Sherrill
said a trimmed-down list of 40 hopefuls will join Mississippi State for spring
practice in March.;     Spinks, Round 2; Tommy Spinks was 16 when he was
introduced to the sweet science of boxing by his father, Leon Spinks, at a gym
in Detroit.;    "We started fighting. He hit me. I hit him back. He kind of
got the best of me," said Tommy, 18, who won his debut at the Golden Gloves
preliminaries in Chicago and fights again Tuesday.;    "I wasn't in shape, and
I guess he just wanted me to feel it -- that it's not a joke when somebody
hits you," said Tommy, a 5-11, 215-pound super-heavyweight.;    Leon said he
didn't think his son would be a boxer.;    But, Leon said, "I didn't mind --
if it was something he wanted to do. I didn't make him do it.";     MAY I BE
EXCUSED?; Cincinnati pitcher Randy Myers will be following the bouncing ball
-- not throwing a ball -- during the first few days of the Reds' spring camp
in Plant City, Fla.;    Myers has been excused from camp so that he can coach
women's basketball. Myers is a volunteer assistant coach at Clark Community
College in Vancouver, Wash., where he played college baseball.;  Absolutely,
this is a major risk. Next summer, Benoit can sign with anybody he wants to.
So it's going to make for a challenging summer. ';    -- Sonics President Bob
Whitsitt after acquiring center Benoit Benjamin from the Clippers  </TEXT>
