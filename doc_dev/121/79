<LEADPARA>  Jose Canseco's stance on this whole slump thing is to shrug it off as a stance
thing.;    With a typical Canseco smirk, he says he's not concerned about his
.226 average. A change in his batting stance should take care of things, and
what's the big deal anyway?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Who cares? I mean if you start strong or if you start weak, it just
matters how you end up," Canseco said this week.;    It's not as easy for A's
teammate Mark McGwire to brush aside his own concerns. McGwire is the only
player in baseball to reach 30 homers in each of his first four full seasons.
But now, he has started his fifth hitting .200 with one RBI. And McGwire, who
came into the season with a home-run ratio second only to Babe Ruth, is mired
in the longest homerless stretch of his career.;    "I'm just going to roll
with the punches. I mean, I'd be lying to you if I said I wasn't upset. I'm
going to keep going," McGwire said. "I've felt fine. It's just keeping going.
Maybe I'm pushing too hard. I don't know. Maybe I'm not relaxed enough.";   
Although there were more contributions the last two games, the A's offense has
been pretty much a one-man, Dave Henderson show this season. And the real
letdown has been the lack of production from Canseco and McGwire. They have
been potentially lethal as back-to-back power hitters throughout their career;
now, neither is providing much punch. And McGwire has spent most of the season
hitting sixth, instead of fourth behind Canseco, because left-hander Harold
Baines and Terry Steinbach pose bigger threats.;    Canseco does have more
reason for optimism than McGwire does. He appears closer to his old self. He
hit his second and third homers against the California Angels in Anaheim last
week, then started swinging from his heels when the A's played in Seattle,
then Minnesota. In one stretch from Saturday through Monday, he had eight
strikeouts in 11 at-bats.;    "Right now, I think Jose is over-swinging a
little bit, maybe trying to hit the ball too far," hitting coach Rick Burleson
said. "But I'm not really all that worried about Jose. Things are going to
fall into place for us. He's going to have a very big year for us.;    "He's a
little concerned with some pitches that are being called on him for strikes.
What he has to realize is that they're not out to try to get him or anything,
it's just a matter of him cutting down on his swing a little bit, just trying
to hit line drives and not trying to hit the ball so far every time up.";   
Canseco has returned to a more open stance that he says allows him to move his
hands and the bat through the strike zone more quickly and allows him to see
the ball better. And he is seeing some results. He takes a four-game hitting
streak into tonight's game; he's 5 for his last 15 with a double and three
RBIs.;    He also feels none of the back pain that hobbled him last season, so
he has become a running threat once more. Canseco has four stolen bases this
season and says he's eager to test his legs.;    "My thing right now is if I
get on base, I'm going to steal the base," Canseco said. "I'm going to try to
hurt you somehow. So, maybe that helps in the sense that I'm going to get
better pitches.;    "I'm going to keep my legs real strong. Hopefully, I will
have the green all the time, because right now the way I'm running I can steal
a lot of bases.";    McGwire doesn't have other offensive tools to turn to.
And he doesn't appear close to working out his problems at the plate. Burleson
wants McGwire to use more of the field, but so far McGwire hasn't been
successful. He hasn't homered since Sept. 21 last season. His one RBI this
season came April 14. And he has played in every game.;    "The only thing he
can really hit right now is the ball down and in, so consequently they're
pitching him up, or they're pitching him up and in, or they're pitching him
away," Burleson said. "Until he goes out and covers that plate and keeps his
left shoulder down, he's going to continue to struggle. We're well-aware of
what he's doing and what they're doing to him. He's going to have to just try
to work it out.";    McGwire says he struggles to see the ball.;    "Yeah,
basically, it's just seeing it clearly. I'm not seeing it as clearly as I want
to, and when you're not seeing it clearly, either you're out in front or
you're just behind it," he said.;    McGwire insists he's just worried about
getting hits, but there's also some worry about getting that first homer,
Burleson said.;    And although both McGwire and Canseco deny that they feel a
need to carry this team while so many players are sidelined, Burleson said he
thinks Canseco has felt that pressure.;    "I think Jose does. I think he
feels a lot of weight on his shoulders," Burleson said.; ETC.: The A's will
honor American Indians on May 4 at the Coliseum.;  HOMERLESS; Mark McGwire
took the second-best home-run ratio in baseball history into this season. He
was homering every 13.9 at-bats, second only to Babe Ruth's 11.8. Here's a
