The best team in the major leagues last year calls Oakland home. And the city 
may be home to the nation's top Babe Ruth team as well. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday night in Carson City, Nev., a team from Oakland swept a doubleheader 
from La Crescenta to win the Babe Ruth Western Regional and advance to the 
World Series this week in Jamestown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
The team of 13-year-olds from La Crescenta had entered the contest from the 
winners' bracket and needed just one victory to advance to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland, however, won, 2-0, in the first game and came back with a 7-2 victory 
to claim the title.

Homecoming: Cal Linam, a former cross-country and track standout at Glendale 
College and Cal State Long Beach, has been named cross-country coach and 
assistant track coach at Burbank High.

<P>
Linam, 28, succeeds Dave Kemp, 51, who coached at Burbank from 1974-86 and 
1987-90. Kemp, Linam's father-in-law, will take over the sophomore football 
program and continue to coach golf. 
</P>
<P>
The Western State Conference runner-up in the steeplechase in 1983 for Glendale 
College, Linam has a best of 9 minutes 4.4 seconds in the event. He was also a 
member of the 1981 Vaquero cross-country team that placed third in the state.

Linam, who taught English at Hoover High last year, will teach freshman and 
sophomore English at Burbank.
