<LEADPARA>  Item: Jose Canseco, after a 1990 game in which he hit a ball that had the
audacity not to reach the Oakland Coliseum's left-field bleachers, imparted
this wisdom to sportswriters: "Baseball's entertainment, and the fans like to
see home runs. They should move the fences in.";    Item: Mickey Mantle, in a
national radio interview this season, talked of his rookie year -- Joe
DiMaggio's last -- with the New York Yankees, 1951. "He was supposed to be
sort of washed up, I guess. . . . It just makes me wonder how good he must
have been before." Mantle, an expert witness and, like Canseco, one of the
most powerful hitters ever, discussed the plight of a right-handed hitter such
as DiMaggio playing half his games each season in cavernous Yankee Stadium,
before it was rebuilt and the dimensions were reduced in 1976. "I remember a
Sunday when he hit four balls at least 420 feet. They all got caught. He
probably has four home runs if he's playing somewhere else. Instead he goes 0
for 4."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Mantle is quoted to inform any player who thinks he has it so bad --
Canseco, for example -- that among all the great hitters, no one had a more
unfavorable home park than DiMaggio.;    And make no mistake: DiMaggio was a
great hitter, and not just because of that 56-game hitting streak that has
been celebrated since he strung it together in 1941. Consider that while
hitting 361 home runs in his 13 seasons, DiMaggio struck out only 368 times.
Those numbers separate him from all other hitters -- confirming his ability to
make contact as so-called "singles hitters" do while powering the ball as only
sluggers do. The strikeout, a power hitter's prerogative, was almost
transcended by DiMaggio.;    Consider also: DiMaggio, who along with Ted
Williams will be an honorary American League co-captain at Tuesday's All-Star
Game, hit 30 or more home runs and struck out less than his home run totals in
seven separate seasons -- an unheard of pairing of precision and power. It is
considered excellent contact for a home run hitter if he can hold his
strikeouts to 2 1/2 times his home runs in a season. (Hank Aaron struck out
almost twice for each homer he hit, exceptional; Willie Mays struck out nearly
2 1/2 times per home run; and Mantle more than three times for each homer.);  
 A rare parlay;  Tommy Henrich, DiMaggio teammate and admirer, told author
David Halberstam in the latter's fine book, "Summer of '49," that the two
numbers, 361 and 368, still made him incredulous, all these years later.;   
Such a combination of contact and crunch is a rare parlay indeed. It's Ray
Robinson, choosing to box or slug as he saw fit; Jim Brown, running over or
around a defender; Sandy Koufax, striking out batters without having to pay
his way with walks. Choices of skills that only the greats possess.;    What
makes DiMaggio's power numbers so impressive is that he played at Yankee
Stadium with its dreaded left-center field, Death Valley. Only right down the
line could DiMaggio get away with the kind of home run that today elicits
high-fives and arm-bashes from teammates. From straightaway left to
right-center, DiMaggio's power zone, Yankee Stadium's fences were more than
400 feet away at most angles, with awesome distances of 457 and 461 feet to
left-center and dead (indeed) center field.;    So I get impatient with a
Canseco politicking for an easier home target in Oakland. Making Canseco's
pleas even harder to swallow is his penchant for striking out, in which case
it doesn't matter where the fences are.;    The game has changed;  There has
been much talk about whether today's stars could have played back when, but to
turn the proposition around, wouldn't DiMaggio and Williams like their chances
in today's game?;    Wouldn't they thrive on the various artificial-turf
fields? And forget that argument on behalf of today's pitching staffs as being
deeper and more talented. The only place they go deeper is in the count.
Today's batters are competing against pitchers throwing off 10-inch mounds at
strike zones that give batters the best of it. DiMaggio and Williams swung
against pitchers delivering from 16-inch mounds toward a bigger and more
consistently determined strike zone.;    DiMaggio, whose all-around ability
has served to somewhat obscure his batting skills, accepted as a challenge his
disadvantage at playing in the House That Ruth Built. Had DiMaggio's career --
from 1936-51 -- not been interrupted by three years' Army service, we can
assume fairly that he could have had about 460 lifetime homers, based on his
average of 33 per season in his first five years, giving him 99 or so more.;  
 In his second season, 1937, DiMaggio hit a career-high 46 home runs. Not
surprisingly, 27 came on the road. The trend was set. In 1950, DiMaggio hit 32
home runs, only nine of them at Yankee Stadium; of his 361 lifetime homers,
213 came on the road, only 148 at home.;    DiMaggio, of course, has a
well-documented mystique. He has been part of Americana from the '30s through
World War II, from his marriage to Marilyn Monroe, through his immortalization
in a Paul Simon '60s lyric, through recognition by a generation simply as
television's "Mr. Coffee," so he needs no press agent. Indeed, the number, 56,
is more indelibly carved into the American fabric than are 37 1/2-23-36 --
M.M.'s numbers, of course. In this way J.D. and M.M. were alike: No numbers
could describe their impact or come close to it.;    I wish that all who will
see them Tuesday night could have seen DiMaggio and Williams play. As DiMaggio
said, Williams was "the greatest hitter I ever saw." Williams, in turn, has
many times said DiMaggio was the "greatest player of my time.";    Few,
however, put the two on the same plane as hitters. Meet one of the few.;   
Williams, too, had a tough park to hit homers in as a left-handed batter. But
Fenway was a great park for all-around hitting. And Ted tore it up for
average, hitting over .400 at home in three different full seasons.;    When
Williams hit .406, his home average was .428. In contrast, DiMaggio's best
average was .381, good for the 1939 batting title. The difference: DiMaggio
hit .416 on the road, but Yankee Stadium confined him to a mere .350.;   
Williams once was asked by his son if DiMaggio was as good a hitter as he was.
Ted is supposed to have explained that DiMaggio, as a right-handed hitter, had
a natural disadvantage. There was always farther to run to first base, and
most often longer distances to conquer for home runs. Anyway, it was a classy
response from Williams, and one DiMaggio deserved.;    Baseball analysis has
come a long way since the time of Joe and Ted. For example, it was only a
little over a year ago that I read the road averages of Williams and DiMaggio
for their careers: DiMaggio, .333; Williams, 328. DiMaggio scored more runs
per game, .80 to .78, and had more RBIs per game, .89 to .80, than did
Williams.;    Those statistics were surprising, and they bolstered what I long
had perceived as a most logical argument: that the park he played in shrunk
DiMaggio's productivity more than is apparent from the general statistics.
There are books that attest to that now, books that say DiMaggio, among many
great hitters, had the most negative park to play in statistically. Bill
James, considered by many the guru of the new numbers cult, came out with a
well-received book, "The Historical Baseball Abstract," several seasons ago.
But even it did not have strikeouts listed for batters. That was about as fair
to DiMaggio as it would have been to judge Marilyn on her figure alone.;   
Just a few things I thought you should know. A fanatic rests his case.;   HOME

reduced differences from home plate to the fence.  </TEXT>
