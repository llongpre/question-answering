HISTORY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     (check) Roger Maris' 61 home runs will be recognized without qualification
as the true season record. Previously, Babe Ruth's 60 homers in a 154-game
season were recognized as sort of a co-record.;   (check) No-hitters must be
games of at least nine innings that end with no hits allowed. Tossed out were
50 no-hitters, including games in which hits were allowed after the ninth,
such as Harvey Haddix's 12-inning perfect game in 1959; rain-shortened
no-hitters such as those pitched by Melido and Pascual Perez; and even the
game last season in which Andy Hawkins allowed no hits, but went only eight
innings as the loser in a road game.;   (check) A 1917 game in which Ernie
Shore had been credited with a perfect game is now a shared no-hitter with
Ruth, who was ejected after walking the leadoff hitter.;   (check) Twenty
arbitrary changes in the latest edition of Macmillan's Baseball Encyclopedia
were reversed -- restoring hits to such Hall of Famers as Cap Anson, Honus
Wagner and Nap Lajoie.  </TEXT>
