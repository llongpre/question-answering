<LEADPARA>  IF JOHN Goodman of "Roseanne" hadn't backed out of a deal to play baseball
immortal Babe Ruth in a new TV movie, Stephen Lang might still be toiling in
the minors.;   But Goodman did back out -- to make more money playing Ruth in
"The Babe," a movie coming to theaters early next year -- and Lang was called
in to take his place.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The happy result is a big-league performance from the Broadway-trained Lang
in NBC's "Babe Ruth," a stirring bio-film that premieres tonight at 9 as a
major event of baseball's World Series month.;   Lang's Ruth is an incredibly
vain, headstrong hell-raiser who set as many records in the bedroom and at the
table as he did at the ballpark. Far from the bear-like buffoon William Bendix
played in the sanitized 1948 film "The Babe Ruth Story," Lang's Ruth is a
hot-tempered giant who could look the commissioner of baseball in the eye and
call him a "white-haired old bastard," regardless of the fine and suspension
that guaranteed. He's a man who wanted it all, no matter who got hurt in the
process.;   Yet the new "Babe Ruth" isn't just a myth-busting movie that
rewrites the legend. Lang's Ruth also takes us behind the bluster to see the
vulnerable man whose parents dumped him in a Catholic industrial school for
boys at an early age, then forgot about him.;   "I was too big and ugly for
anybody to come and see," the adult Ruth tells a lonely boy when he returns to
the school many years later.;   More than anything, though, the new "Babe
Ruth" presents a formidable challenge to an actor. Lang not only had to beef
up for the role (gaining 35 pounds) and master Ruth's unorthodox batting
stance and unique base-trotting style, but also had to make a frequently
unpleasant man likable enough to command our attention for two hours.;   Lang
has the tools to meet such a challenge. Schooled at the famed Actors' Studio
and various regional theater companies, he appeared on Broadway with Dustin
Hoffman in "Death of A Salesman" and earned a Tony nomination last season for
"The Speed of Darkness." His films include "Last Exit to Brooklyn" and
"Manhunter." In TV, he's best known for roles in "Crime Story" and the TV
version of Hoffman's "Salesman." Lang is known as an actor who gets deeply
involved with the characters he plays. He approached the role by locating what
he felt was the central metaphor for Ruth's life, which he found in a quote
from Ruth.;   "He said, 'I swing big; I hit big or I miss big; and that's the
way I live my life -- as big as I can,' " Lang explained.;   Lang decided he'd
take a "big bite" of the role and play it the way the real Ruth played ball.
But first the right-handed Lang had to get Ruth's left-handed swing down pat.;
  The producers arranged for him to work with another baseball star -- Hall of
Famer Rod Carew, who retired in 1986 with a lifetime batting average of .328
and seven American League batting titles. After daily batting practice at
Carew's Southern California baseball school, Lang compared videotapes of
himself with films of Ruth until he could match them perfectly.;   "When the
hitting began to fall into place," said Lang, "then playing the role began to
fall into place.";   (Carew claims Ruth had "terrible mechanics" as a hitter
and must have been incredibly strong to hit the ball as hard as he did from
his stance.);   The movie skips over Ruth's days as a pitcher for the Boston
Red Sox and begins in 1920, when the Babe was acquired by the New York
Yankees, primarily as a power hitter. In those days, the 6-foot-2 Ruth weighed
about 215 and was in trim shape. In the twilight of his career in the early
1930s, Ruth was much heavier, with a waistline of about 43 inches. Lang didn't
have time to gain that much weight, so makeup specialist Michael Westmore
fitted him with body padding and some special appliances to make his face and
neck appear fuller.;   For Lang, a lifelong baseball fan who grew up in New
York, the chance to play Ruth was the proverbial dream come true. Lang lives
just three miles from the site in Valhalla, N.Y., where Ruth is buried and has
regarded him as a hero since his earliest childhood.;   "The deeper I got into
him, the closer I felt to him," said Lang. "He was an extremely complex figure
-- and a very vulnerable figure with tremendous needs.";   In Lang's mind,
Ruth altered baseball forever by changing it from "little ball," with the
emphasis on singles, doubles and sacrifices, to "big ball," where the crowd
came to see home run sluggers.;   In his last year with the Red Sox before
joining the Yankees, Ruth hit 29 homers, a then overwhelming feat that Lang
believes made baseball fans "long-ball hungry" for good. In 1927, Ruth hit 60
home runs, more than any other team in the American League. He ended his
career with 714 homers (not counting his 15 in World Series competition), a
record surpassed only by Hank Aaron, who broke Ruth's record 39 years later,
taking many more times at bat to do it.;   "People would rather see Ruth
strike out than see a lot of other fine players hit a single or double," said
Lang.;   Lang's next acting assignment also is an extremely challenging one:
He'll play Hamlet on Broadway in February. But he's aware his portrayal of
Ruth may be a career-making one that people won't soon forget.;   "Maybe I'll
get a role as good as Babe," he said, "but I don't think I'll ever get one
better." (box)  </TEXT>
