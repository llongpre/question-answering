   Frazzled by freeways? Try Zen Buddhism.
   That's the advice two brothers are giving in ``Zen Driving,'' a
book that explores how harried motorists can enjoy life in the
not-so-fast lane.
   No religious conversion is necessary for this ``moving
meditation,'' say Kevin and Todd Berger. In Zen driving, they say,
you simply accept a traffic jam and become one with it.
   A master of the art might even learn to see all the honking and
crowding as a path to enlightenment _ a sort of nirvana on wheels.
   ``Zen driving is a heightened sense of awareness and
mindfulness,'' said Todd Berger, 39, a psychotherapist from Marin
County, in a weekend telephone interview.
   ``If somebody cuts you off, you simply acknowledge your anger
and then let it go,'' he said. ``You're aware of what you
experience, and you experience what you're aware of.''
   Todd and his brother Kevin, the 31-year-old editor of a rock
music magazine in San Francisco, hope anyone whose mind stalls over
that concept will buy their newly released book.
   It represents the culmination of a discovery that Todd, who has
been studying Zen since the late 1960s, made a dozen years ago.
   Spending three hours a day commuting from home to work near Los
Angeles, he found he had little time to do his ``zazen,'' the
technique of sitting meditation that is the core of Zen Buddhism.
So he decided to do it on the road.
   ``Not only did my driving ability improve, but I got to work
feeling a lot less uptight,'' he said.
   Kevin also learned the method _ or ``non-method,'' as his
brother calls it. A car enthusiast, he, too, found it relaxing even
though he is not a practicing Buddhist.
   ``Zen is a philosophy, not a religion,'' said Kevin, who drives
a late-model pickup truck. ``To be a Buddha behind the wheel
doesn't mean you have to take the plastic Jesus off your
dashboard.''
   In the book, the brothers Berger describe exercises on how to
practice the method. They advise letting go of emotions and
focusing on the ``feel'' of the wheel, the car, the road.
   Soon, they promise, the cursing, fist-shaking and heart-pounding
associated with car trips will be only a memory. And you can
converse and meditate at the same time.
   ``Babe Ruth was a colorful personality off the field, but at the
moment the pitcher released the ball you can be assured Babe Ruth
was nothing but experience and awareness,'' they write. ``And
that's how we want to be in traffic.''
   Todd now professes to commute almost effortlessly over the
Golden Gate Bridge to his office in San Francisco.
   In fact, being a practicing Buddhist, he's virtually
unflappable. But it does upset him that some have described ``Zen
Driving'' as esoteric. He hopes the book will be as useful for
Iowans as it is for those cruising L.A. freeways every day.
   ``It chagrins me that this is being labeled as a New Age book in
bookstores,'' he said. ``It was really designed to be a driving
book for the everyday driver. ... I guess most stores don't have a
`driving' section.''
