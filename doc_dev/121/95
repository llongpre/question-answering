<LEADPARA>  He was never a 20-game winner like Ferguson Jenkins or a Cy Young Award winner
like Gaylord Perry. He never batted above .350, as Rod Carew did several
times.;    And instead of being associated with a great team like the 1927 New
York Yankees, as Tony Lazzeri was, he's remembered as being the owner of the
woeful St. Louis Browns.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Bill Veeck may be etched in baseball lore as much as the four others,
whom he joins in baseball's Hall of Fame in ceremonies scheduled today. Also
joining them, in the broadcast wing, is former catcher and longtime NBC
announcer Joe Garagiola.;    Jenkins won 20 games for six consecutive years
from 1967-72 for the Chicago Cubs, the ace pitcher for some of their best
teams since World War II.;    Carew was a seven-time American League batting
champion. By the time he retired in 1985, he had a career batting average of
.328 and 3,053 hits. The Baseball Writers Association of America made Carew
only the 22nd player to gain election in the first year of eligibility. He
received 401 of a possible 443 votes, or 90.5 percent.  Lazzeri, like Veeck,
was selected by the Hall of Fame's veterans committee. He was one of the
hardest-hitting second basemen of all time. He drove in 100 runs or more in
seven seasons, including 1927, when his 18 home runs ranked third on the team,
behind Babe Ruth's 60 and Lou Gehrig's 47.;    But Veeck's contributions were
numerous. A man who wasn't averse to painting designs on his artificial leg or
sending a midget to bat for the Browns also pioneered giveaway days for the
fans, installed the first exploding scoreboard and was the first to put names
on the backs of players' uniforms.;    Chicago White Sox fans shouldn't forget
that the team probably would have moved away in the 1970s had it not been for
the efforts of their owner -- Veeck.;    He died in 1986.;    "The only thing
I regret is that he won't be there to smell the roses," said Rudie Schaffer,
who was Veeck's associate for 50 years. "I'm so happy it's happening. He
should have been in sooner."  </TEXT>
