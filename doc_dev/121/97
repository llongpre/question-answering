<LEADPARA>  We've heard of men selling their souls to gain the world -- but Sacramento?
Gimme a break.;    The guy in the photo at right who acts as if he has a
splitting headache probably does. That's Ben Bennett, the quarterback we all
learned to know and love when he was playing at Peterson High in Sunnyvale
(now even the school is gone) and then at Duke, and then -- blech!  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Well he's trying now to make a name for himself in the World League of
American Football (which, oddly enough, put a team in Sacramento).;    The guy
gesturing at him is Kay Stephenson, coach of the Sacramento Surge.;    Surge?
That name is almost as bad as Kay.;     NOLAN CHOWS DOWN WITH BUSH AND THEM;
Texas Rangers pitcher Nolan Ryan and his wife, Ruth, were guests of George
Bush, another Texas home boy, at a little gathering the other night up there
at the White House, or as they call it down in Harlingen: La Casa Blanca.;   
"I was nervous when I found out Nolan and I were going to be sitting at
separate tables," Ruth said. "But I was sitting between Walter Cronkite and
Secretary of State James Baker, and they both have Texas backgrounds, so it
was really nice.";    Ryan found himself himself seated at the head table with
the president and Queen Margrethe II, the queen of Denmark.;    "It was
boy-girl, boy-girl," Ryan explained. "The queen, the president, Colin Powell's
wife, Alma, me and Katherine Couric of the Today Show.";    Ryan said he and
the queen didn't talk much baseball.;    "She probably knew less about me than
I did her, and I didn't know a whole lot about her.";  TEARDROPS ARE FALLING
TODAY IN COOPERSTOWN; When you think of home-run hitters, you probably think
of Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and Roger Maris. (Some of us think of Wally Moon, but
that is another story.);    Ruth and Aaron and are in the Hall of Fame. Maris,
who broke Ruth's seemingly unbreakable record when he hit 61 homers in 1961,
is not. Again. And won't be.;    Why not? A new Hall of Fame rule: If a
player's career began after 1945, he must have received 60 percent of the vote
in at least one of his 15 years on the baseball writers association ballot or
be excluded from future consideration.;    Among those the rule knocked off
the board: Richie Ashburn (sorry about that, Richie), Harvey Kuenn (poor Harv)
and Maris.;    Maris, like Kuenn, is dead, so he doesn't care about it one way
or the other.;    But for those of us who hung on every pitch those last weeks
and then days of the 1961 season, barring Maris from even being considered for
Cooperstown anymore hurts.;    Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio and Willie Mays got
there for excellence over a career, but Maris can be compared to the first man
to break four minutes in the mile -- or walk on the moon. He was a moment in
time, a bright moment in the history of baseball, a moment, we could add
snippily, that no one else has matched.;    No one in the Hall of Fame ever
hit 61 homers in one season. Roger Maris did.;    So, along with Ashburn and
Kuenn, Roger will have to wander out there as only a memory in our field of
dreams.;    Still eligible for consideration: guys such as Nellie Fox, Leo
Durocher and Phil Rizzuto.;    But not Roger.;    It's a shame.;  ' If I would
have thought about it longer, I would have said they reminded me of something
I used to walk behind when I plowed the fields.  That would have made everyone
think.  'Minnesota Coach Clem Haskins, who called game officials "jackasses."  </TEXT>
