Hall of Fame pitcher Vernon (Lefty) Gomez, who starred with the great New York 
Yankee teams of the 1930s, died today. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez, 80, died at Marin General Hospital of congestive heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
Born Vernon Louis Gomez in the small town of Rodeo, about 30 miles northeast of 
San Francisco, he was signed for $35,000 by the Yankees but went only 2-5 in 
1930, his first season in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
However, he quickly justified New York's confidence, going 21-9 in 1931 and 
24-7 in 1932, two of the four seasons in which he won more than 20 games. 
</P>
<P>
His overall record, including an 0-1 record with Washington in 1943, his final 
year in the major leagues, was 189-102. He had a 6-0 record in seven starts in 
five World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez won four of the five All-Star Games he started, including the first one 
ever played, in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Drove in First Run 
</P>
<P>
Although that team included such legends as Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Al Simmons 
and Joe Cronin, it was Gomez who drove in he first run. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing I did in baseball game me more satisfaction that getting that base 
hit," Gomez said a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
After his career ended, Gomez spent some time managing in the minors, in 
Binghamton, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
Gomez is survived by his wife, June, daughters Gery, Vernona and Sharon and 
seven granchildren.
