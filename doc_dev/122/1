   Mixed in with the ads for trusses and
carousel music in the 199th Old Farmer's Almanac are predictions
for a cold, snowy winter and advice on helping a baby grow: Put
manure in the infant's shoes.
   The 224-page, 199th edition hits newsstands and supermarkets
this week with its traditional weather predictions, planting and
tide tables, anecdotes and folklor.
   It claims 80 percent accuracy in its weather forecasts, but
editor and part-owner Judson Hale says that figure is not cast in
stone.
   ``I can't in seriousness say 80 percent,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his Dublin office. He missed the Midwest
drought in 1988.
   Nevertheless, the almanac is predicting a ``real old-fashioned
winter'' east of the Rockies with below-normal temperatures over
much of the country except Florida, sections of the Ohio and lower
Mississippi valleys and the Northwest.
   Florida, it predicts, will have warmer than normal weather in
February and March.
   The almanac also forecasts a generally warmer spring and summer
than normal, but a cool and wet fall.
   The almanac says its forecasts are based on a combination of a
secret formula devised by its founder and the ``most modern
scientific calculation based on solar activity.''
   Hale also strays into earthquake forecasts, noting that the moon
will be 221,545 miles from the Earth on New Year's Eve, closer than
its average of 251,000 miles.
   ``Some people would believe it would have an influence on an
earthquake if an earthquake was thinking about happening,'' he
said. Believers argue that when the moon is closer and its
gravitational pull is stronger, there is greater stress on rock
layers that might rupture and cause a quake.
   The almanac even offers folklore advice on babies. On
conception, the almanac offers this folk wisdom: If a woman lays
her hat or coat on a strange bed, she will have a child.
   To have a boy, she should hold a nickel in her mouth at the time
of conception. To make the baby grow tall, folksters suggest
putting manure in the child's shoes.
   The yellow-covered Old Farmer's Almanac has changed little since
it was first published in 1792.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is not to be confused with its upstart
rival, the Farmer's Almanac, which is about a third as thick, 23
years younger, and is given away to businesses for advertising
purposes.
   The distinguishing trademark of the Old Farmer's Almanac is a
hole in the corner, put there at great expense and inconvenience,
its publishers say, to preserve the tradition of hanging the book
on a nail in the pantry or outhouse.
   ``It does indicate it is, in a sense, a calendar,'' Hale says.
   Hale spent the summer scouring previous issues for lore to
include in an expanded 200th anniversary edition next year.
   ``I'm up to 1931,'' he said. ``I have 65 pages of notes.''
   Almanac readers will get a chance to contribute. The essay topic
for the 200th edition: How the Old Farmer's Almanac Has Influenced
My Life.
