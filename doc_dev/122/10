<LEADPARA>  ON DEC. 28, 1732, an ad in a Philadelphia newspaper announced the publication
of a new almanac complete with "witty verses, jests, and sayings" supposedly
compiled by one Richard Saunders. This advertisement would have remained quite
unremarkable, given the fact that there were numerous almanacs available to
people at that time.;   But the "Richard Saunders" mentioned in this ad was
really a pseudonym for Benjamin Franklin, and the new almanac, called "Poor
Richard's Almanac," became one of the most popular and influential
publications in all of colonial America.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I recently saw a copy of an old "Poor Richard's Almanac," and I was struck
by how similar it was in its arrangement and style to another almanac that is
only slightly less historic, but is still published today: "The Old Farmer's
Almanac.";   In fact, this new year marks the 200th anniversary of the
beginning of "The Old Farmer's Almanac," and it may also be a good time for us
to consider this wonderful piece of Americana as a worthwhile and inexpensive
addition to our collection of home learning resources.;    THE TYPES of home
resources that I have been promoting as good acquisitions for "family
learning" activities are those that either inspire interest in learning or
confirm various learnings that were stimulated elsewhere, or both. A family
dictionary, for example, can be used to investigate a pronunciation or a word
usage that you heard on television, but that word (perhaps its spelling,
definition, or derivation) can lead you to investigate other words as well,
and you can come back from your trip to the dictionary with much more than you
went looking to find.;   I think "The Old Farmer's Almanac" fits this same
bill because it enables, as well as encourages, its readers to learn from the
world around them. Forget the weather predictions, which were of greater
interest and utility in centuries past, but are now mainly just a curiosity
for most readers, including farmers.;   Look instead at the wealth of
information about topics like astronomy, geography and history that can be
found here and probably not in any other single learning resource. The almanac
gives you the precise times for the rising and setting of the sun and the
moon, the position of each major constellation, the phases of the moon, the
time and place of eclipses and meteor showers during the year.;   But there is
more than astronomy here, for you'll also find the exact longitude and
latitude for hundreds of cities in the United States and Canada, as well as
items of historical interest for each day of the year, and many well-written
essays that can inspire family discussions and activities.;   YOU SEE, this
almanac -- like the family dictionary or a globe or an atlas -- can be a
springboard for all types of learning that can go on around the house. This is
what Franklin's almanac did for our colonial ancestors, but we are more
fortunate in that we can use our almanac in conjunction with other home and
school and library resources to acquire an education that "is both broad and
deep.";   This 1992 "Old Farmer's Almanac" is of special value in family
learning because it is the bicentennial edition, and it includes several
features that focus on the events of the last 200 years, and especially on the
way things were in 1792, when the first edition of the almanac was published,
when George Washington was president, when the average age in the country was
16, and when the almanac sold for sixpence.  </TEXT>
