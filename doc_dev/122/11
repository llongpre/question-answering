   The Old Farmer's Almanac, the folksy,
old-fashioned American tradition, has taken on New York Magazine,
the trendy chronicle of life in the big city.
   The 199-year-old Almanac filed a trademark infringement lawsuit
Wednesday accusing the magazine of imitating the Almanac's
distinctive cover design with the Dec. 3 issue.
   The Almanac's publisher, Yankee Publishing Inc. of Dublin, N.H.,
said the covers were so similar that readers might be led to
believe the Almanac authorized or in some way sponsored its use by
New York Magazine.
   The lawsuit said the magazine, by imitating its trademarked
cover, had ``impaired the value of Yankee's cover design and the
goodwill symbolized by it.''
   Susan Soriano, a spokeswoman for the magazine, said the magazine
had not received the lawsuit and had no immediate comment.
   The disputed cover, titled ``The 1990 Christmas Gifts Almanac,''
promotes a story of gift suggestions for the holidays. It is
illustrated in a similar design as used by the Almanac.
   Yankee accuses the magazine of copying, among other things, the
overall distinctive yellow color, the use of red and green
highlights and a red and white border, and a nearly identical style
of typeface.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeks an
order barring the magazine from using the design in the future. It
also seeks unspecified damages.
   The Almanac has been published annually since 1792.
