   Gary Liubakka is a newcomer to politics,
but he figures he's bound to get a hefty vote in next year's
gubernatorial race.
   That's because he's running as founder of the National Apathetic
Party. With a 60 percent voter turnout expected in the 1990
election, Liubakka can claim the other 40 percent of the electorate
as constituents.
   ``They won't vote, and a `no' vote is a vote for me,'' the
36-year-old contractor said recently.
   The unofficial party _ it's known as NAP _ even has a mascot: a
battered eagle.
   The bird's neck is longer than most eagles' because it's been
stretched a few times. Its left wing is clipped from giving away so
many handouts. Its tail feathers are lost.
   On the rare occasions Liubakka removes his tongue from his
cheek, he'll betray serious worries about the state of the body
politic.
   ``Our intention is to slap everybody in the face with
ignorance,'' the unregistered candidate said, ``and hopefully this
blunt hint will get them out to vote more.''

   The northern third of the country will have
more snow than usual but it'll be a mild winter for most of the
country, says no less an authority than the Old Farmer's Almanac.
   Abe Weatherwise, who claims 80 percent accuracy in ``America's
oldest continuously published periodical,'' predicts a white
Christmas in New England. The 198th edition of the 224-page almanac
hits the newsstands and supermarkets this week with its familiar
planting and tide tables, anecdotes and other tidbits, such as 100
ways how to avoid untimely death. (No. 49, avoid combing hair in
the dark; No. 77, never whistle in a coal mine.)
   Abe, a collective pseudonym, says the almanac's predictions are
``based on state-of-the art analysis of recurring solar cycles.''
   He predicts that a cold, wet and snowy spring in the North will
be balanced by warm, dry spring weather west of the Mississippi.
The summer of 1990, says Abe, will be hot and dry in many areas
east of the Rockies.
   In addition to weather predictions, the almanac has
advertisements for hernia appliances, secrets of winning lotteries
and rules of thumb for rhubarb pie.
   It also advises that cows and pigs bred for leanness will boost
the popularity of red meat and inflation will run at 6 percent.
   Among other predictions: the return of the 4-inch-wide necktie
for men, short hair for women and lower prices for videocassette
recorders.

   Most everyone has heard of killer bees and
killer whales _ but what about killer snails?
   One man is determined to prove that the combative cousins of
common garden snails are the answer to eliminating the slow-moving
but voracious plant munchers. Raymond Harrie, 34, sells a hostile
snail breed that he claims will prey on the garden pests.
   ``It's the tough new snail on the block,'' Harrie said the other
day from his demonstration booth at the Los Angeles County Fair.
   The shell-less critters ambush garden snails, following their
slime trails and attacking them when they lay their eggs, Harrie
said. The bloodthirsty snails, known to scientists as Rumina
decollata, usually leave their victims mortally wounded, rather
than killing them outright, he said.
   Harrie, who sells the attack snails for $20 per 100, claims
they're too slow-moving to move from the garden to the house, and
pose no danger to children and pets.
