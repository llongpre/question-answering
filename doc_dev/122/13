   Punxsutawney Phil, America's premier
groundhog, emerged from his burrow today and indicated in
``unmistakable groundhogese'' that he had failed to spot his
shadow, a sure sign spring is just around the corner, according to
Phil's followers.
   ``He stood proud, tall and confident, surveyed the throng of
loyal followers, peered skyward toward the east and then fixed his
eyes groundward,'' said county judge Edwin Snyder. He is a member
of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's exclusive Inner Circle, which
each year decides in advance whether Phil will ``see'' his shadow.
   Snyder said Phil ``turned to Groundhog President Jim Means and
signaled to him in unmistakable groundhogese, `There is no shadow
today.'''
   The squirming, 10-pound woodchuck was pulled from his man-made
burrow atop Gobbler's Knob at sunrise, 7:27 a.m. Means held the
groundhog up to his ear to hear the once-a-year prediction, then
lifted him toward Snyder.
   The approximately 1,500 people who had gathered under cloudy
skies and in light rain cheered as Phil's forecast was announced.
   ``I've always wanted to come to this event ever since I was a
kid,'' said Peter Teicher, 49, of Los Angeles. ``I'm really
excited. I couldn't sleep last night. It's a real thrill.''
   Other prognasticating groundhogs around the country followed
Phil's lead and also failed to see their shadows.
   Legend has it that if the famous groundhog sees his shadow when
he emerges from his bungalow at sunrise on Feb. 2, there will be
six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring is supposedly just
around the corner.
   ``You know and I know that Feb. 2 is too darn early to expect
spring to come,'' said Tim Clark, executive editor of The Old
Farmer's Almanac.
   But the two-legged variety of weather forecasters are still
curious about what Phil has to say on Groundhog Day.
   ``I definitely do watch to see what he does. I didn't say I
believe it. I say I watch it,'' said Albert Peterlin, a hydrologist
for the National Weather Service in Harrisburg.
   ``This has a little bit of history and fact,'' he said.
``Animals respond to temperature and environment as it occurs.''
   Before today, Phil had predicted an early spring only nine times
since 1887, when German-born farmers initiated the yearly event in
this small western Pennsylvania town.
   The farmers borrowed from the legend of Candlemas, a Christian
holiday celebrating the first time the infant Jesus was taken to
the temple. An old Scottish couplet claims, ``If Candlemas be fair,
there'll be two winters in the year.''
   Groundhogs, part of the rodent family, usually hibernate by
December and stay underground until April or so, but sometimes
venture out early if the weather is mild.
   ``Phil's never been wrong,'' boasted Means, 66.
   The 14 local businessmen who comprise the Inner Circle decide
well in advance what Phil's forecast will be. Group members stages
several rehearsals before Groundhog Day, when they don top hats and
tails for the event.
   Phil's handler, Bud Dunkel, sported a fake fur hat resembling a
groundhog.
   Every other day of the year, Phil lives at his heated,
air-conditioned hutch at the local library with two other
groundhogs, Philomena and Barney.
   As far as The Old Farmer's Almanac is concerned, February _ at
least around Punxsutawney _ will be extremely cold and snowy
followed by similar weather in early March.
   The National Weather Service is calling for a warmer than usual
February, but a colder than usual March and April.
   ``If I were to give you the scientific point of view, I think it
would be cold for the rest of this winter,'' said meteorologist
Victor Nouhan. ``Of course, that's worth a grain of salt.''
   Groundhog Octorara Orphie also saw no shadow in central
Pennsylvania's Quarryville. And neither did West Virginia's Concord
Charlie as he was ``wandering around campus to see if any flowers
are up,'' said Tom Bone, public information director for Concord
College in Athens.
   Ditto for French Creek Freddie at the French Creek Wildlife
Preserve in Upshur County in West Virginia and General Lee at the
Yellow River Game Ranch in Lilburn, Ga.
   The newest addition to the groundhog lineup, Little Hog, made
his debut at the Indianapolis Zoo with fans joining in a rousing
chorus of ``You Are My Sunshine'' on kazoos. But there was no
sunshine and no shadow there.
