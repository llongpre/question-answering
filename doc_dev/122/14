<HEAD>TV Station Surrenders Taped Interview to Police</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CASPER, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A television interview with a man whose wife
has been missing since Dec. 8 was seized by police who got a search
warrant to obtain the tape from KTWO-TV, managing editor Charles
Brown said.
   The woman's husband had complained in the interview that police
were spending too much time treating him like a suspect when they
should be searching for his wife.
   On Dec. 18, police seized the taped interview, saying it
``constitutes evidence.''
   Brown said the station decided not to challenge the warrant, in
part because the husband had approached KTWO on his own.
Additionally, station officials didn't think the interview
contained any comments that the man hadn't already made to police,
he said.
   ``Our position was we take this on a case-by-base basis,'' Brown
said. ``I think it just ought to be on a case-by-case basis. I
don't think you should turn stuff over voluntarily, but responding
to a search warrant is different.''
   According to an affidavit that accompanied the warrant, police
wanted the tape because it contained statements made by the husband
that they believe show he concealed a stolen gun and military
equipment found when officers searched the couple's house after she
disappeared.
   Michael Krampner, a lawyer working with the Wyoming Press
Association, said KTWO already had broadcast a portion of the
interview and so there was little argument for confidentiality of
the tape.
   ``As the law now is in Wyoming, journalists are no different
from any other citizens,'' he said. ``If they receive a subpoena to
come to court and tell what they know, they're just like any other
citizen, they have the obligation to respond to that. If a court
issues a valid search warrant ... obviously they have to stand
aside and let them search for it just like any other citizens.''

<HEAD>Arkansas Court Says Records Open</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Dec.
17 in support of Donrey Media Group in a Freedom of Information
case involving a failed incineration project in the city of
Fayetteville.
   Donrey, owner of The Morning News in Springdale, sued to gain
access to records produced in connection with the incinerator.
   The city said the documents wouldhelp opponents who filed suit
challenging the payout of public funds for the $7 million debt
remaining on the project.
   ``We are grateful the Supreme Court affirmed what we believed
the law to be,'' said David Olive, a Donrey attorney. ``We hope
that this puts this matter at an end and that the City of
Fayetteville promptly complies with the request to turn over the
information.''

<HEAD>Dukakis Signs Bill Easing Secrecy of Criminal Records</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis on Dec. 17 signed
into law a bill to reduce the secrecy of the state's criminal
records, ending a three-year struggle to overhaul the Criminal
Offender Records Information law.
   The revised law is a compromise between those who wanted the
records opened completely and those who wanted the secrecy
maintained. It will keep records open from one to three years,
depending on the crime and prison sentence.
   As passed in 1972, the law kept virtually all criminal records
secret.
   The drive to change it began in the wake of the Willie Horton
case that became a major issue in the presidential campaign between
Dukakis and George Bush.
   The records law was little known to the public until Horton, a
convicted first-degree murderer from Lawrence, escaped from his
10th prison furlough and went on to rape a young Maryland woman and
stab her fiance repeatedly in March 1987.
   Citing the law, state correction officials refused to say why
they gave Horton weekend passes after he had been sentenced to life
in prison without parole for the slaying of a teen-ager.
   Horton's records were released only after the Lawrence
Eagle-Tribune sued.

<HEAD>Almanac Accuses New York Magazine of Stealing its Cover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Old Farmer's Almanac, the folksy,
old-fashioned American tradition, has taken on New York Magazine,
the trendy chronicle of life in the big city.
   The 199-year-old Farmer's Almanac filed a trademark infringement
lawsuit Dec. 19 accusing New York Magazine of imitating the
almanac's distinctive cover design on the cover of its Dec. 3
issue.
   The almanac's publisher, Yankee Publishing Inc. of Dublin, N.H.,
said the covers were so similar that readers might be led to
believe that the almanac authorized or in some way sponsored its
use by New York Magazine.
   The lawsuit further claimed that New York Magazine, by imitating
its trademarked cover, had ``impaired the value of Yankee's cover
design and the goodwill symbolized by it.''
   New York Magazine had no immediate comment.
   The disputed cover in dispute, titled ``The 1990 Christmas Gifts
Almanac,'' promotes a story of gift suggestions for the holidays.
It is illustrated in a similar design as used by the almanac.
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, seeks an
order barring New York Magazine from using the cover design in the
future and unspecified damages.

<HEAD>Charges Refiled Against Former Newspaper Editor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHNSTOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities in Bucks County on Dec. 17
refiled charges of impersonating a public servant and harassment
against Theodore N. Beitchman, former editor-in-chief of The
Tribune-Democrat.
   The same charges were dismissed in November after a judge ruled
that the state had insufficient evidence.
   The charges allege that Beitchman, posing as a state deputy
attorney general, made threatening telephone calls to a couple
whose son had been involved in a traffic accident with Beitchman's
brother.
   Prosecutor Ted Fritsch said more evidence had been uncovered,
but he declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>Report Finds 1990 Unhappy Year for Journalists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The year 1990 was an unhappy one for journalists,
with some of the most serious setbacks coming where hope had been
strongest, the International Press Institute reported.
   The institute's World Press Freedom Review paid particular
attention to press difficulties in Romania, Yugoslavia, South
Africa, Turkey, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, Chile, Colombia and Iraq.
   ``There has been an increase in attacks on the media, and they
most galling aspect of all is that they are occurring in countries
where we had been given good reason to hope for dramatic changes
for the better,'' IPI Director Peter Galliner wrote in the report
released Dec. 14.
   Galliner said one of 1990's most gruesome incidents was the
execution in Iraq of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born journalist
working for The Observer newspaper of London. Bazoft was accused of
spying.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait silenced about 40 Kuwaiti
publications, the report noted.
   ``Ironically, one consequence of Saddam Hussein's move has been
the opening ... of the Saudi media, which have been obliged to tell
the population the truth, at long last, faced with the evidence all
around them,'' Galliner wrote.
   ``But the Arab media, as a whole, remain shackled and
subservient to the political line of their respective
governments.''
