   Uncle Sam's bathroom has been found.
   Archaeologists made the discovery on Ferry Street, site of the
house of 19th century meatpacker Sam Wilson, City Manager Stephen
Dworsky said. During the War of 1812, Wilson stamped his crates
``U.S.,'' leading to the military joke that the meat was provided
by ``Uncle Sam.''
   The archaeologists ``are down six feet, and you can literally
see what was the floor to the bathroom,'' Dworsky said.
   A park is being built on the site by Hannaford Bros., a
supermarket company based in Scarborough, Maine. The company is
building a store next to the park.
   Uncle Sam's house stood on the site from sometime in the 19th
century until 1971, when New York state demolished it to make way
for a road that was never built, Dworsky said. Hannaford bought the
site in 1988 for $277,000.
   When the park is finished, the house's foundation and bathroom
floor will on view to visitors, Dworsky said.

   Forget monthly payments and sky-high
list prices. About 40 bargain hunters camped out on a Westmoreland
County dealer's lot for a chance to buy cars for as little as $1.99.
   ``Obviously at $1.99 you don't make money. But the good will it
creates ... is fantastic,'' Les Dugan, general sales manager at
World Class Motors, said Monday.
   Tonya Stover of Apollo, her father and a friend occupied a 1979
Ford Pinto beginning around 2:30 p.m. Sunday. Their persistence
paid off when Stover bought the car Monday morning for $1.99.
   Raylene Pogoersckey of Arnold arrived at 3 p.m. Sunday but her
first choice, a 1980 Plymouth Volare for $69.99, was already spoken
for. She settled for a 1979 Pontiac Grand Prix priced at $499.99.
   Mike Madison of Plum got the Volare, which he said is probably
worth $1,000.
   ``You can't beat it,'' said Madison, a former used car salesman.
``Believe it or not, I have a Mercedes at home in the garage. This
is my winter ride.''
   Dugan said the prices ``return something to the community to
give people a chance to own a car.''
   The dealership offered 180 cars at prices ranging to $13,000.
Twenty-six were offered for less than $500. They carried no
warranties but Dugan said all of them were driven, not towed, onto
the lot.

   In case you missed the book, now you
can rent the video.
   Portions of ``The Old Farmer's Almanac,'' the outdoor planter's
bible and an institution for 198 years, will be available on
videocassette next month, providing home remedies, gardening tips,
offbeat features and weather forecasts.
   The hour-long tape is narrated by Willard Scott of NBC's
``Today'' and features comedian Jonathan Winters passing on home
remedies for toothaches and unconventional cures for the hiccups.
   There is also a look at how the almanac is put together.
   The program was produced by Brandwon Praxis Media Productions of
South Norwalk, using segments of some of the latest almanacs, said
Tim Clark, executive editor of the book, which is published by
Yankee Publishing Co. of Dublin, N.H.
   Clark was unsure of the financial arrangements between Braxis
and Yankee Publishing. He said almanac publisher John Pierce was in
Alaska and unavailable for comment.
   ``This is a video about the almanac, it's not the almanac,'' he
said.
