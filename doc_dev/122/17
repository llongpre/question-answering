   The nation's welfare system is headed for a
major overhaul with the conclusion of complex negotiations on a
five-year plan aimed at moving welfare recipients into jobs and
helping them collect more child support.
   The initiative agreed on Monday by Senate, House and White House
negotiators had been close to death all summer as negotiators
sought a balance between conservatives favoring mandatory work and
liberals concerned about increasing benefits to the needy and
motivating people to enter the mainstream workplace.
   The $3.34 billion welfare plan comes in above the Senate's own
$2.8 billion measure but would cost less than half of the initial
$7.1 billion plan passed by the House.
   The cornerstone of the compromise is a Job Opportunities and
Basic Skills (JOBS) program offering welfare parents _ including
those with preschool children _ services such as job search help,
education and job training. Child care and transportation aid would
be available to participants.

   Some 4.7 million Americans will have to wait
at least another year for the first raise in the $3.35-an-hour
minimum wage since 1981 as Senate Democrats concede a major
election-year legislative defeat to a Republican filibuster.
   Refusing to bow to GOP demands for a broad-based subminimum
floor under the 50-year-old minimum wage, Democratic leaders on
Monday gave up all hope of raising the pay base by 40 cents to
$3.75 an hour in January.
   ``There is no point in our continuing to pound on their door,''
Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said on the Senate floor.
``I'm now conceding that the Republican filibuster was successful.''

   Michael Dukakis, refining his plan to break
the Republican Electoral College lock, plans to curtail his efforts
in several states that appear out of reach while escalating the
fight for critical swing states and the major battleground of
Texas, according to campaign aides.
   In all, the states in which Dukakis aides concede their chances
of defeating Republican nominee George Bush are slim carry roughly
100 of the 538 possible Electoral College votes, with 270 needed to
win the White House.
   One Dukakis aide, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
campaign would begin ``pulling back budget and pulling back staff''
and saving the resources for states that are closer to Dukakis'
reach.

   President Reagan is telling leaders of
Persian Gulf states that the U.S. decision to stop escorting
individual ships represents ``just a slight difference'' in the
Navy's waterway policing operation.
   Posing for pictures with Sheik Jaber Al-Almed Al-Sabah, the amir
of Kuwait, Reagan said, ``We're not lessening our protection there
at all.''
   On a busy day in which the president made his swan-song visit to
the United Nations, Reagan also heard an upbeat assessment of
Middle East peace prospects and voiced new hope that American
hostages in Lebanon might be set free.

   Environmentalists hailed a call by the
Environmental Protection Agency for a global ban on
ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons and related compounds.
   ``We're glad to see they've come around to our way of
thinking,'' said Liz Cook of Friends of the Earth.
   The announcement Monday by EPA administrator Lee M. Thomas
marked a shift from his view that there was plenty of time to
consider what, if any, steps were needed to tighten the terms of an
existing international treaty on reducing CFC production.
   That treaty, signed by 45 major nations, pledges signatories to
a 50 percent cut by 1998.

   Parliament today named as prime minister a
journalist who represented Communist authorities in 1980-81 talks
with Solidarity, then defended the free trade union movement's
martial-law suppression.
   The choice of party propaganda chief Mieczyslaw Rakowski comes
less than a month before planned talks between the government and
Solidarity on reinstating the labor federation's legal status and
reviving Poland's crippled economy.
   Rakowski became the country's ninth prime minister since World
War II by a 338-5 vote with 35 abstentions in a nationally
televised parliament vote.
   The new prime minister immediately asked for two weeks to form a
new government from people with ``reformist attitudes'' and said he
would seek to broaden the communist-dominated governing coalition.

   A young man accused in a school shooting
spree that left an 8-year-old girl dead and 10 people wounded had
been in and out of a hospital psychiatric ward over the past eight
months, relatives said.
   James William Wilson, who was arrested following Monday's
violence at Oakdale Elementary School, is a hyperactive recluse
fascinated by crime stories, his father and a grandmother said.
   The 19-year-old Greenwood man entered Oakdale shortly after 11
a.m. Monday and opened fire in a classroom and the cafeteria,
killing Shequila Tawonn Bradley and wounding two teachers and eight
pupils, said Police Chief James Coursey.

   The 197th edition of the Old Farmer's
Almanac contains a forecast for a white Christmas in the East, a
prediction of woe for Red Sox fans, and former Sen. Edmund Muskie's
technique for mesmerizing lobsters.
   Published in tiny Dublin, N.H., the oldest continuously
published almanac in the United States hits newsstands today with
its usual, homey brand of ``new, useful and entertaining matter''
for the 9 million readers it claims.
   Started in 1792, the 224-page Almanac also predicts heavy snow
starting around Thanksgiving from Chicago to New England and down
the East Coast, with a frigid December in some sections before
temperatures rise and the weather dries.
   While New England, southern Florida and the desert Southwest
should prepare for below-normal temperatures, the rest of the
country will get a warmer winter than usual.
