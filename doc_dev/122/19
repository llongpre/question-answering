   Iben Browning holds dozens of patents
in several specialties, but it's his earthquake projections that
are stirring up notoriety he says he'd rather do without.
   Browning said at a conference in Missouri last year there was a
high probability of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault this
Dec. 2.
   He was deluged by calls.
   He insists he did not predict an earthquake.
   ``The public always wants everything in black and white,''
Browning said.
   ``No one can tell you there is going to be an earthquake on Dec.
2, no one can know that. ... Everybody knows when he drives a car
that he's taking a risk that it will malfunction or crash. Yet
people do drive cars. They're dealing in probabilities.''
   Browning, 72, a large man with a graying burr haircut, says the
public does not understand _ and the press does not know how to
communicate _ the idea of probability.
   ``The closest you can translate probability into English is
`maybe.' But unless you say `maybe not,' they take it as an
absolute,'' he said.
   Browning is chief scientist for Summa Medical Corp., an
Albuquerque biotechnology research and development company. His
Summa resume says he holds 66 U.S. and foreign patents in optics,
electronics, mechanics, chemistry, electro-optics, hydraulics and
educational toys.
   Summa credits him _ he won't discuss what he does for the
company _ with developing new technology for compressing
electronically transmitted human speech.
   Over the years, he's been a development physicist with American
Optical Co., worked in optics for Bell Aircraft Corp. and was a
scientist for Sandia National Laboratories.
   But gradually his interest in climatology grew, and he now
publishes the Browning Newslettter on world climate. He said he's
been accepted commercially as a climatologist since 1974 when he
became a consultant for Paine Webber Inc.
   His formal training was elsewhere: a bachelor's degree in math
and physics from Southwest Texas State University, and a master's
degree in bacteriology physiology and a doctorate in physiology,
genetics and bacteriology from the University of Texas at Austin.
   ``It turned out that in my observations of climate that all of
the soft tools with which I approached biology were applicable to
climate,'' he said. ``It's a subject that is comparable in
complexity to biology.''
   Business needs climate information because the weather
determines how much food will be produced and where, whether the
transportation industry can get over the roads, whether anything
can be built, he said.
   He provided forecasts for the 1989 edition of the Rocky Mountain
Almanac and ``did as well or better than the Old Farmers' Almanac
predictions,'' said Lee Olson, almanac editor.
   ``He did predict the usual monsoons that come up in Arizona in
late August, that the Colorado Great Plains would receive extra
moisture and store up adequate moisture for the 1990 year,'' Olson
said. ``He had the ski season only partly. He had it right for an
early start, but it got dry around Christmas as I recall and his
timing was a little off on that.''
   Browning said his climatological observations are based on high
tidal forces, produced by four causes: the proximity of the moon to
Earth; the proximity of Earth to the sun; the alignment of the
Earth, moon and sun during the full moon and new moon; and the more
perfect alignment of those bodies during eclipses. The vector sum
would be the total tidal force produced.
   Such forces can trigger earthquakes, he said, and on Dec. 2,
there will be the highest vector sum high tidal force in 60 years
from 30 to 60 degrees north latitude. That area includes the New
Madrid Fault, running roughly from Marked Tree, Ark., through New
Madrid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill.
   Since last year, when Browning raised the possibility of a
December New Madrid quake, the Arkansas National Guard has
scheduled earthquake exercises for around that time, one Arkansas
school district is considering canceling classes and sales of
earthquake insurance have picked up.
   But Browning said whether a given fault is actually triggered
would depend on the pressure built up along it. That information
should come from area seismologists, he said firmly.
   If no earthquake occurs in or around December, Browning said
people will be more inclined to ignore the danger of the New Madrid
Fault.
   ``That's what I fear more than anything else,'' he said.
``People don't trust authorities anymore; they never did trust them
much. Why should they? What have authorities done for them except
tax them to death?''
   Browning's earthquake projections are controversial among
seismologists.
   Klaus Jacob, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty
Geological Observatory of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y.,
said correlating earthquakes to tidal forces doesn't work.
   ``It's more likely that in the next 10 years or 20 years we'll
have something (quake activity), rather than on this particular
day,'' Jacob said. ``You see, earthquakes don't care about
predictions. And people shouldn't worry about predictions. They
should worry about earthquakes.''
   Browning said he told a convention of chief executive officers
in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 1989, that there was a 50-50 chance of
an earthquake registering 7 on the Richter scale on or about Oct.
16 because a high triggering force was expected that date and
geologists had determined there was a strain on the San Andreas
Fault.
   An earthquake registering 7.1 hit Oct. 17, killing 67 people.
   Jacob said: ``He was just lucky. That's the law of large
numbers.''
   Arch Johnston, director of the Center for Earthquake Research
and Information at Memphis State University in Tennessee, said
Browning ``is certainly not justified scientifically.''
   ``The tidal force that Dr. Browning bases his theory on has been
examined thoroughly by seismologists, and there's no evidence that
tidal forces can trigger earthquakes. ... Earthquakes depend on the
internal processes of the Earth, not the external processes of the
sun and moon.''
