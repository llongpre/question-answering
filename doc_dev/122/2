   The 197th edition of the Old Farmer's
Almanac contains a forecast for a white Christmas in the East, a
prediction of woe for Red Sox fans, and former Sen. Edmund Muskie's
technique for mesmerizing lobsters.
   Published in tiny Dublin, N.H., the oldest continuously
published almanac in the United States hits newsstands today with
its usual, homey brand of ``new, useful and entertaining matter''
for the 9 million readers it claims.
   A competing Farmer's Almanac, which is marking its 55th year,
was released earlier this month. That publication is sold to banks,
insurance companies and other businesses for distribution to
customers as a promotion and claims a circulation of more than 5
million.
   Started in 1792, the 224-page Old Farmer's Almanac also contains
its usual fearless extended weather forecast for 1989 for 16 U.S.
regions.
   Editor Judson Hale claims 80 percent accuracy with the secret
formula and the ``most modern scientific calculation based on solar
activity,'' although it failed to predict last summer's devastating
drought.
   Looking ahead, the almanac predicts heavy snow starting around
Thanksgiving from Chicago to New England and down the East Coast,
with a frigid December in some sections before temperatures rise
and the weather dries.
   That means a white Christmas, but ``snow stopping in time for
cork popping'' at New Year's.
   While New England, southern Florida and the desert Southwest
should prepare for below-normal temperatures, the rest of the
country will get a warmer winter than usual.
   For the summer, the almanac calls for cooler, wetter weather
along the East Coast, normal temperatures in New England, Florida
and the Deep South, and drier weather in the Ohio Valley through
Chicago, Texas, Oklahoma and the Pacific Coast.
   But for the often-disappointed fans of Boston's beloved Red Sox,
next September's forecast is the most crucial: It comes with the
warning, ``Sox in first, expect the worst.''
   The familiar black and yellow publication, punctuated this year
with sporty red highlights, again offers predictions for consumers,
who can expect fake caviar, low-calorie tortilla chips, scented
newspaper ads and the ``ultimate indignity'' _ garbage rationing _
in the coming 15 months.
   The casual reader may also be drawn to educational features,
such as the ``straight facts about warts'' and ways to get rid of
them ranging from ``bizarre and complicated'' to ``extremely
disgusting'' and ``downright criminal.''
   Muskie, the former Democratic senator from Maine and U.S.
secretary of state, offered a followup to a 1984 article on
hypnotizing chickens with his own ``foolproof ways to hypnotize a
lobster.''
   By stroking the tail in a downward motion, ``curling it as you
go,'' he said, you can impress friends by getting the lobster to do
a claw stand on its head.
   A vigorous shake should bring the lobster back to its senses,
but if that doesn't work, Muskie wrote, just whisper in its ear,
``Drawn butter, drawn butter.''
