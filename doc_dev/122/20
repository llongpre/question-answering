   Punxsutawney Phil, the country's No. 1
four-footed forecaster, squinted hard but failed to see his shadow
Friday, thus predicting an early spring for only the 10th time in
more than a century.
   The squirming, 10-pound groundhog was pulled from his manmade
burrow atop Gobbler's Knob at 7:27 a.m. The crowd of about 1,500
screamed wildly after Phil's forecast was announced.
   ``He stood proud, tall and confident, surveyed the throng of
loyal followers, peered skyward toward the east and then fixed his
eyes groundward,'' said Edwin Snyder, 64, a county judge and a
member of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club's exclusive Inner Circle.
   ``He turned to Groundhog Club President Jim Means and signaled
to him in unmistakable groundhogese, `There is no shadow today,'''
Snyder said.
   Virtually everyone in the crowd of mostly students, some of whom
had waited in the light rain and mud for hours, seemed stunned by
the woodchuck's prediction. Even the tuxedo-clad members of the
Inner Circle, who decide well in advance what Phil predicts every
Groundhog Day, professed astonishment.
   ``I think he made a good pick,'' said Means, 66, who held Phil
to his ear then informed Snyder of the forecast so the judge could
announce it.
   John Groninger, 24, a college student from Fairbanks, Alaska,
who's traveling around the country, was thrilled with Phil's
prediction even though he doubts it will apply back home.
   ``It will be six more weeks of winter no matter what Phil
says,'' Groninger said, grinning.
   Tradition has it that if a groundhog sees his shadow at sunrise
on Feb. 2, there will be six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't,
spring is just around the corner.
   Phil has predicted an early spring just nine other times since
1887, when German-born farmers initiated the yearly event in this
small western Pennsylvania town. The favorable forecasts were in
1890, 1902, 1934, 1950, 1970, 1975, 1983, 1986 and 1988.
   The farmers borrowed from the legend of Candlemas, a Christian
feast celebrating the first time the infant Jesus was taken to the
temple. An old Scottish couplet claims, ``If Candlemas be fair,
there'll be two winters in the year.''
   As soon as his forecast was announced, Phil was whisked away
from the burrow and returned to his rest-of-the-year home at the
local library, a heated and air-conditioned hutch that he shares
with two other groundhogs, Philomena and Barney.
   Other prognosticating groundhogs around the country followed
Phil's lead.
   Octorara Orphie also saw no shadow in central Pennsylvania's
Quarryville. Neither did West Virginia's Concord Charlie as he was
``wandering around campus to see if any flowers are up,'' said Tom
Bone, public information director for Concord College in Athens.
   Ditto for French Creek Freddie at the French Creek Wildlife
Preserve in Upshur County in West Virginia and General Lee at the
Yellow River Game Ranch in Lilburn, Ga.
   Buckeye Chuck, Ohio's official groundhog, also failed to see his
shadow when he emerged from his burrow in a wooded lot next to the
studios of radio station WMRN in Marion.
   The newest addition to the groundhog lineup, Little Hog, made
his debut at the Indianapolis Zoo with fans joining in a rousing
chorus of ``You Are My Sunshine'' on kazoos. But there was no
sunshine and no shadow there.
   Phil's forecast isn't too far off the National Weather Service's
prediction for the next few months. Meteorologists expect February
to be warmer than usual in western Pennsylvania but colder than
usual in March and April.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac, on the other hand, is predicting an
extremely cold and snowy February around Punxsutawney.
