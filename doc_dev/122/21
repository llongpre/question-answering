Iben Browning holds dozens of patents in several specialties, but it's his 
earthquake projections that are stirring up notoriety he says he'd rather do 
without. 
</P>
<P>
Browning said at a conference in Missouri last year there was a high 
probability of an earthquake along the New Madrid Fault this Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
He was deluged by calls. 
</P>
<P>
He insists that he did not predict an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"The public always wants everything in black and white," Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one can tell you there is going to be an earthquake on Dec. 2, no one can 
know that. . . . Everybody knows when he drives a car that he's taking a risk 
that it will malfunction or crash. Yet people do drive cars. They're dealing in 
probabilities." 
</P>
<P>
Browning, 72, a large man with a graying burr haircut, says the public does not 
understand -- and the press does not know how to communicate -- the idea of 
probability. 
</P>
<P>
"The closest you can translate probability into English is 'maybe.' But unless 
you say 'maybe not,' they take it as an absolute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Browning, who publishes the Browning Newsletter on world climate, said his 
climatological observations are based on high tidal forces produced by four 
causes: the proximity of the moon to Earth; the proximity of Earth to the sun; 
the alignment of the Earth, moon and sun during the full moon and new moon; and 
the more perfect alignment of those bodies during eclipses. These factors 
combine to produce tidal forces. 
</P>
<P>
The same forces can trigger earthquakes, he said, and on Dec. 2, there will be 
the highest combination of such factors in 60 years from 30 degrees to 60 
degrees north latitude. That area includes the New Madrid Fault, running 
roughly from Marked Tree, Ark., through New Madrid, Mo., to Cairo, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
Since last year, when Browning raised the possibility of a December New Madrid 
quake, the Arkansas National Guard has scheduled earthquake exercises for 
around that time, one Arkansas school district is considering canceling classes 
and sales of earthquake insurance have picked up. 
</P>
<P>
But Browning said whether a given fault is actually triggered would depend on 
the pressure built up along it. That information should come from area 
seismologists, he said firmly. 
</P>
<P>
If no earthquake occurs in or around December, Browning said people will be 
more inclined to ignore the danger of the New Madrid Fault. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what I fear more than anything else," he said. "People don't trust 
authorities anymore; they never did trust them much. Why should they? What have 
authorities done for them except tax them to death?" 
</P>
<P>
Browning's earthquake projections are controversial among seismologists. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Jacob, senior research scientist at Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory 
of Columbia University in Palisades, N.Y., said correlating earthquakes to 
tidal forces doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
"It's more likely that in the next 10 years or 20 years we'll have something 
(quake activity), rather than on this particular day," Jacob said. "You see, 
earthquakes don't care about predictions. And people shouldn't worry about 
predictions. They should worry about earthquakes." 
</P>
<P>
Browning said he told a convention of chief executive officers in San Francisco 
on Oct. 10, 1989, that there was a 50-50 chance of an earthquake registering 7 
on the Richter scale on or about Oct. 16 because a high triggering force was 
expected that date and geologists had determined there was a strain on the San 
Andreas Fault. 
</P>
<P>
An earthquake registering 7.1 hit Oct. 17, killing 67 people. 
</P>
<P>
Jacob said: "He was just lucky. That's the law of large numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Arch Johnston, director of the Center for Earthquake Research and Information 
at Memphis State University in Tennessee, said Browning "is certainly not 
justified scientifically." 
</P>
<P>
"The tidal force that Dr. Browning bases his theory on has been examined 
thoroughly by seismologists, and there's no evidence that tidal forces can 
trigger earthquakes. . . . Earthquakes depend on the internal processes of the 
Earth, not the external processes of the sun and moon." 
</P>
<P>
Browning is chief scientist for Summa Medical Corp., an Albuquerque 
biotechnology research and development company. His Summa resume says he holds 
66 U.S. and foreign patents in optics, electronics, mechanics, chemistry, 
electrooptics, hydraulics and educational toys. 
</P>
<P>
Summa credits him -- he won't discuss what he does for the company -- with 
developing new technology for compressing electronically transmitted human 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, he has been a development physicist with American Optical Co., 
worked in optics for Bell Aircraft Corp. and was a scientist for Sandia 
National Laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
But gradually his interest in climatology grew. He said he has been accepted 
commercially as a climatologist since 1974 when he became a consultant for 
Paine Webber Inc. 
</P>
<P>
His formal training was elsewhere: a bachelor's degree in math and physics from 
Southwest Texas State University, and a master's degree in bacteriology 
physiology and a doctorate in physiology, genetics and bacteriology from the 
University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
"It turned out that in my observations of climate that all of the soft tools 
with which I approached biology were applicable to climate," he said. "It's a 
subject that is comparable in complexity to biology." 
</P>
<P>
Business needs climate information because the weather determines how much food 
will be produced and where, whether the transportation industry can get over 
the roads, whether anything can be built, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He provided forecasts for the 1989 edition of the Rocky Mountain Almanac and 
"did as well or better than the Old Farmers' Almanac predictions," said Lee 
Olson, almanac editor. 
</P>
<P>
"He did predict the usual monsoons that come up in Arizona in late August, that 
the Colorado Great Plains would receive extra moisture and store up adequate 
moisture for the 1990 year," Olson said. "He had the ski season only partly. He 
had it right for an early start, but it got dry around Christmas as I recall 
and his timing was a little off on that."
