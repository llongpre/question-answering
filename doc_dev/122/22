   Hurt by slumping sales, Yankee Publishing
Inc., publisher of the Old Farmer's Almanac, plans to lay off a
third of its employees and sell a book division and New England
Business magazine.
   Last year, the 54-year-old company sold two magazines, Texas
Business and ASTA Agency Management.
   President Joseph Meagher said sales dropped from $50 million in
1987 to $40 million last year, but he declined to disclose profit
and loss figures.
   ``It was not a good year,'' Meagher told the Keene Sentinel, but
he added that the company is financially healthy. He said he
expected finances to improve once the company consolidates.
   Besides publishing the Old Farmer's Almanac, with a circulation
of 3 million nationwide, the company publishes Yankee magazine,
which sells 1 million copies each month; Yankee Travel, with an
annual circulation of 200,000; Yankee Homes, 35,000 monthly
circulation, and Alaska, 235,000 monthly circulation.
   Meagher said New England Business, with a free circulation of
90,000 monthly, is a ``break-even'' publication. The book division,
which puts out six mostly non-fiction books a year on topics such
as cooking and photography, is profitable, Meagher said, but the
company wants to focus on regional magazines.
   Starting April 1, 68 employees who handled Yankee subscriptions
will be laid off and the work handled by a subcontractor, and on
July 1, the 16-person graphics department will be closed and the
work done by outside companies at less cost, Meagher said.
