   Doubters beware. Like other weather
lore, Punxsutawney Phil, America's best-known and best-kept
woodchuck, isn't entirely hogwash, according to folklorists.
   ``A great many folk beliefs have a certain logic behind them. It
may not be scientifically verifiable, but they're often not
completely random and I think this is one of them,'' said Erika
Brady, assistant professor in programs in folk studies at Western
Kentucky University.
   ``We're always kind of taking a look at folk wisdom to see if
there is some basis in fact for it,'' agreed Tim Clark, executive
editor of The Old Farmer's Almanac. ``The lasting lesson is not to
underestimate our ancestors. They were not dumb people.''
   Barring calamity, at sunrise Friday, fat, furry Punxsutawney
Phil will be pulled from a manmade burrow atop Gobbler's Knob,
about a mile outside town.
   If the critter sees his shadow, tradition has it there will be
six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring is supposedly
around the corner.
   ``If you're a groundhog or a person and you come out of your
warm, snug haven that you've made for the winter and get fooled by
the sunlight into thinking it's spring, you're going to be in
trouble,'' Clark said. ``So it says the groundhog is not fooled.
   ``I think it's no coincidence the spring equinox comes about six
weeks after Groundhog Day.''
   The legend actually has roots in Christianity. Groundhog Day
falls on Feb. 2, also the Christian holiday of Candlemas, when the
infant Jesus first was taken to the temple. An old Scottish couplet
claims: ``If Candlemas be fair, there'll be two winters in the
year.''
   Punxsutawney's German-born farmers borrowed the legend and on
Feb. 2, 1887, began turning to local woodchucks for a clue to the
upcoming weather.
   Groundhogs, part of the rodent family, usually hibernate by
December and stay underground until April or so, but sometimes
venture out early if the weather is mild.
   The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club heralds Phil as the seer of
seers, sage of sages, weather prophet extraordinare. Phil has
predicted an early spring a scant nine times over the past century.
The last time was in 1988.
   ``Phil's never been wrong,'' boasted Jim Means, 66, the club's
president and member of the group's exclusive Inner Circle.
   Actually, the 14 local businessmen in the Inner Circle decide
the forecast well in advance. The group even holds rehearsals
before Groundhog Day, when members don top hats and tails and join
about 1,500 people gathered in the dark atop Gobbler's Knob.
   And every day except Groundhog Day, Phil lives in town in a
heated, air-conditioned hutch at the library with two other
groundhogs, known to some as Philomena and Barney.
