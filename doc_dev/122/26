   An unusually warm and dry winter is worrying farmers from
Illinois to Michigan who fear a repeat of the 1988 drought.
   ``There's a pervading omen, a feeling of ominous concern. I sense
it with other farmers, I sense it with the salesmen of agricultural
products,'' said Joe Summer, a McLean County corn and soybean farmer
in central Illinois.
   For the first time in 45 years of farming, Summer is taking out
multi-peril insurance on next season's crop.
   ``We're all beginning to get a little paranoid about it,'' the
62-year-old farmer said. ``There is no frost in the ground. This
unusually warm weather is strange. It is a harbinger of some sort, I
think.''
   Forecasters for the National Weather Service say severe to
extreme drought conditions continue in much of the northern Great
Plains, northern Rockies and parts of the Midwest.
   But the most recent 30-day forecast calls for above-normal
precipitation, said meteorologist Edward O'Lenic with the service's
climate analysis offices in Washington, D.C.
   The agency will not release its spring forecast until after the
commodities markets close Monday, but O'Lenic said there is no
reason to expect more of the drought that hit much of the nation
last summer.
   Even so, farmers and their farm bureaus are worried.
   ``If we don't get some snowfall, we could go into the spring
lacking the snowmelt,'' said Michigan Farm Bureau spokesman Al Almy.
``Potentially, we could be on the short side.''
   Farm bureau officials in Minnesota, Indiana, Wisconsin, Illinois
and Iowa say the same.
   ``At this stage, we're hoping for a terribly wet spring,'' said
Gerald Hagaman, administrator of the Minnesota Farm Bureau.
``There's apprehension.''
   Spring rains will quench the top soil, but farmers have lost deep
soil moisture, their one insurance against drought, said Dennis
Vercler with the Illinois Farm Bureau.
   ``They're edgy about it. We're going into the season needing just
the right rain at just the right time,'' Vercler said.
   Lack of precipitation is not the only worry.
   ``If we stay relatively mild, the real problem is that it doesn't
kill a lot of the pests,'' said Don Henderson, vice president of the
Indiana Farm Bureau, where January temperatures have averaged 34.1
degrees.
   Sheets of ice have coated snowless fields in Wisconsin and
southern Michigan off and on for the past three weeks, causing a
different danger for winter crops of wheat and alfalfa _ icing.
   ``If part of an alfalfa field is coated with ice, it can smother
the plants to death,'' said Wisconsin Farm Bureau President Don
Haldeman.
   Cycles of freezing and thawing also have set up a heaving and
uprooting problem for winter wheat, Almy said in Michigan. ``And if
it should suddenly turn cold, the lack of snow cover could expose
the plants,'' he said.
   The one bright spot is that mild weather is making the winter
easier on livestock, farming officials said.
   The National Weather Service's most recent precipitation map
shows extreme drought in Montana, the Dakotas, central Minnesota,
eastern Iowa, northwestern Illinois and much of Wyoming, eastern
Idaho, central Washington and eastern Oregon, said meteorologist
Dave Miskus from the Climate Analysis Center.
   ``It sure does cause concern,'' said Enid Schlipf, another McLean
County farmer in Illinois. ``We don't understand what's happening.''
