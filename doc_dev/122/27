   For the past five years, through milder-than-usual winters across much of the U.S., natural-gas companies have been pining for frigid weather to boost profits. 
A few have been more literal about it than others. 

   At Consolidated Natural Gas Co., for instance, officials use fallen pine cones to help forecast the nation's winter weather -- and the company's first-quarter earnings. 

   Each year about this time, a report arrives from Maryland's Eastern Shore at Consolidated's Pittsburgh headquarters. 
Compiled by a retired lawyer interested in energy matters, the report tells directors how many pine cones have hit the ground and how big they are. 
The theory is: The more cones that have dropped and the hardier they are, the colder the winter is likely to be. 

   This fall's report, in a departure from recent years, says the cones in Maryland are huge and plentiful. 
And the prospect of it being very cold outside is making Consolidated officials feel all warm inside. 
"We're actually accused of being sadistic about this," says Ray Ernest, a vice president. 
"Really we're not." 

   It's just that chilling temperatures are the lifeblood of any gas and pipeline firm. 
Consolidated says its first-half 1987 earnings were $11.1 million lower than they would have been if temperatures during the period had been normal. 
Instead, they were 8.4% warmer than the National Weather Service's 20-year average. 

   The cone report isn't Consolidated's only way of predicting a winter's weather. 
Some executives keep handy the latest edition of the Farmer's Almanac. 
And a spokesman says he's encouraged because woolly-bear caterpillars are sporting especially thick coats this year. 

   Other firms have been known to count acorns, but some people dismiss all such methods. 
"It's old jokes and wives' tales," says Nick Ruvo, general superintendent for Brooklyn Union Gas Co. 
"I don't know if anyone puts wholehearted faith in it." 

   Consolidated spokesmen temper their pine-cone and caterpillar predictions by noting that the company also looks at data from certified meteorologists and respected agencies, including the National Weather Service. 

   When all is said and done, however, company officials leave little doubt as to which harbinger they favor. 
Before the winter of 1976-77, when blizzards and cold waves hit much of the nation, "the pine cones were enormous," Mr. Ernest says. 
"And they're looking real big now."
