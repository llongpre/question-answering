   Romance, clodhopper shoes for men and lullaby
tapes for yuppie babies will be hot in 1989, but it will be a
ho-hum year for fashions and a bad year for fat kids, according to
The American Forecaster 1989.
   Other '89 trends identified by the Forecaster: gutterless
bowling alleys, fighting dogs on steroids and turkey hunting.
   New Age religion channeling will become passe in 1989, along
with teddy bears and soft cookies, said Kim Long, author of the
sixth annual 192-page Forecaster, which went on sale this week.
   Long said 1989 could be a boring year trend-wise.
   The problem, he said, is that baby boomers _ the one-third of
the U.S. population born between the years 1946 and 1964 _ are
concentrating on their careers and families, and college students
have grown serious.
   The rise of romance and a growing de-emphasis on sex in
advertising, movies and television are directly linked to the aging
baby boomers, Long said.
   ``More of them are having their first kids, and that tends to
slow you down and keep you close to home,'' he said.
   Long was surprised by the growing popularity of lullaby tapes
for the babies of baby-boomer moms. ``Baby boomer mothers who don't
have time or don't know how to sing lullabies are buying tapes from
the professionals,'' he said.
   Clothing styles are becoming conservative and utilitarian, Long
said. ``There is nothing in men's or women's fashions that is a
jump ahead _ pretty boring,'' he said.
   In men's footwear, this means the return of big shoes _
expensive, leather wingtips and brogues. ``The big shoe thing has
been building slowly and is part of the gradual return to
traditional clothing,'' Long said.
   Long, a Denver free-lance writer, has been writing The American
Forecaster since 1983. His predictions have gained such
respectability that the Old Farmer's Almanac gave Long space in the
1988 and 1989 editions.
   Long said the New Age practice of channeling, popularized by
actress Shirley MacLain, will fade in 1989 because of skepticism
and ridicule.
   But astrology will remain hot in 1989, Long said, mainly because
of President and Nancy Reagan's reliance on astrological
interpretations and the subsequent efforts by astrologers to
legitimize the practice as a science.
   Out-of-shape youngsters will be put in fitness programs as the
preoccupation with health trickles down from adults to their
offspring, Long predicted.
   Some curiosities among the trends that will take hold in 1989:
steroid use to make fighting dogs meaner and stronger, gutterless
bowling alleys and a surge in turkey hunting, which Long said was
becoming popular because the birds are tough to shoot.
   Gutterless bowling alleys are for novices and the hopelessly
uncoordinated, Long said. Inflatable tubes are placed in the
gutters between the lanes.
   Long said in an interview last week that of his 1988 forecasts,
he is proudest of his prediction that girdle sales would increase
and of his identification of biodegradable plastics as an important
development.
   On the down side, he was off the mark in predicting the end of
the TV shows ``Dallas'' and ``Dynasty'' and in saying that Pee Wee
Herman would go prime time.
   Long wrote in the '89 Forecaster that Michael Dukakis will be
the next president, but last week he hedged. ``According to every
single indicator from the common to the bizarre, it's too close to
call.''
