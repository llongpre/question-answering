   If you've got a big brain, a yen for the indoors
and little love of glamour or rawboned rigor, then America has just
the right job for you, according to the publishers of ``The Jobs
Rated Almanac.''
   Ranked as the best of 250 American jobs is a career few children
are likely to have heard of, much less name: an actuary. Next are
computer programmer, computer systems analyst, mathematician and
statistician.
   Typical, more glamorous children's career choices like being a
dancer, doctor or astronaut also fared poorly in the almanac's
overall listing because they rated at or near the bottom in at
least one of the six ranking criteria.
   According to the almanac, published this month by American
References Inc. of Chicago, the worst job listed in the ranking was
migrant worker, which rated near or at the bottom in all six of the
criteria.
   The second worst _ commercial fishing _ also was ranked low
because of long hours, seasonal work, high government regulation
and tough physical demands. That was followed by construction
worker, roofer, seaman, dairy farmer, roustabout, lumberjack,
cowboy and professional football player.
   Almanac Editor and Publisher Les Krantz identified the criteria
used to judge jobs as salary, stress, work environment, outlook,
security and physical demands.
   ``Most of the best paying jobs are performed in highly
competitive and physically confining environments for long hours,''
Krantz said. ``Don't expect a cushy job if you want to earn more
than $50,000 a year.''
   But ultimately, he added, ``The job best for an individual is
the one the person likes the best, and that depends a lot on
someone's priorities.''
   Astronauts have the worst working environment, with surgeons
second, the book concluded. Firefighters have the longest work
weeks and their jobs are the most stressful and physically
demanding, it said.
   But actuaries _ who interpret statistics to determine expected
personal losses due to sickness or disability and material losses
from disasters _ did well in all six categories.
   A 23-year old actuary in training, Mike Vaughan, said he agreed
with the assessment.
   ``Once the (training) exams are over, I'd say the stress would
be pretty much non-existent, and the job market is so open I could
just walk out and find a new job in a day,'' he said.
   Vaughan, who works for Allstate Insurance Co. in suburban
Northbrook, said his $31,000 annual salary ``was probably 20 to 25
percent higher than any other job I could have gotten, and it goes
up faster.''
   William Hermes, a fisherman for 47 years, said he wasn't
bothered by his job's low ranking and couldn't imagine making a
living any other way.
   ``It's the only job I've ever wanted,'' said Hermes, 62, owner
of Big Bay DeNoc Fisheries in Garden, Mich. ``You're out in the
open, you're your own boss and you don't have to answer to nobody.''
   Krantz said most of the information for the almanac comes from
the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Department of Commerce and
the Census Bureau, but tracking down some statistics, like a
cowboy's wages, took some legwork.
   ``We literally called cattle ranches and they told us: `Well, if
you have a good horse you can make about $150 a week,'' he said.
