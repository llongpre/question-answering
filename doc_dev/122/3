   After watching his half-acre of grass wither
and dry this spring, Witham Smith wrote a letter to the ``Old
Farmer's Almanac.''
   Smith, a regular reader of the almanac, asked whether the
196-year-old publication's forecasters, having missed the Midwest's
drought, could at least predict the dry spell's end.
   He received a pretty dry answer from Judson D. Hale Sr., editor
of the almanac.
   ``We didn't predict that it was coming and we can't predict when
it will end,'' Hale wrote Smith, who lives in suburban Terrace Park.
   The almanac claims to be 80 percent accurate, but Hale
acknowledged that it doesn't predict weather for spring and summer
too well.
   This year, it predicted that it would be warmer and wetter than
normal in the Greater Ohio Valley. Heavy rain was predicted for
June 14 to 17.
   The almanac usually gathers statistics for its predictions six
to 18 months in advance. The predictions are based on such
information as changes in sun spots, the size of polar ice caps,
and the location of warm water currents.
   ``Our 1989 edition will be published in November. It is really
hard to nail down the weather for spring and summer that far in
advance because so many things happen,'' Hale said.
   ``They have been a little off before, but never this far,''
Smith said. ``They said we would be about half an inch off, but not
a drought like this.''
