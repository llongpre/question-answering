   Two cosmonauts landed safely on Earth early today
after guidance system malfunctions twice forced them to abort their
descent, trapping them in orbit as food and oxygen supplies
dwindled, Tass said.
   Twenty-six tense hours after separating from the space station
Mir, Abdul Ahad Mohmand, the first Afghan in space, and Soviet
crewmate Vladimir Lyakhov touched down in Soviet Central Asia, the
official Soviet news agency said.
   ``Both cosmonauts feel fine after the landing,'' Tass said.

   The Drug Enforcement Administration's chief
administrative law judge says marijuana should be legalized as a
prescription drug because smoking it helps cancer patients control
nausea after chemotherapy.
   Francis L. Young recommended reclassifying marijuana as a
Schedule II drug so that it could be prescribed by physicians to
treat the often severe nausea accompanying chemotherapy as well as
muscle spasms caused by multiple sclerosis.
   Young, whose findings are not binding on DEA's head, John Lawn,
acknowledged that ``strong emotions are aroused on both sides of
any discussion concerning the use of marijuana.''

   Government officials said today they
have no way to distribute millions of dollars in foreign aid to the
more than 20 million victims of floods that still cover
three-fourths of this impoverished nation.
   Railroads and highways were washed away, bridges were mangled
and the Dhaka Airport was still partly under water today and unable
to receive large planes.
   The floods have claimed at least 1,267 lives, according to
newspaper reports. The government put the death toll at 412.

   Michael Dukakis spoke of his immigrant
heritage before a backdrop of 22 American flags and the Statue of
Liberty. George Bush led the Republican convention in a recitation
of the Pledge of Allegiance.
   Typical scenes from what is already the most star spangled
presidential campaign in memory.
   The red, white and blue hue of the contest no doubt reflects a
judgment that Americans are in the mood for another dose of
patriotism, the sort of stuff Ronald Reagan promoted in two
landslide election victories.
   But flag-waving also is the refuge of candidates who would
rather not spell out how they plan to balance the budget or create
millions of new, well-paying jobs.

   Three weeks after the Korean War began in
1950, then-Rep. Lloyd Bentsen urged President Truman to threaten an
American atomic attack on ``principal North Korean cities'' if the
invading communist forces did not withdraw from South Korea.
   Bentsen, now the Democratic vice presidential candidate but then
a freshman congressman, was among the first Washington figures to
advocate use of nuclear weapons in Korea. Others were to speak out
in agreement, but neither President Truman nor, later, President
Eisenhower ever voiced their support.
   In an interview Thursday, Bentsen said he is ``older and wiser''
now and would not do the same again.

   Israelis are expressing shock and anger over
reports of draft-dodging in a country where the army is seen as a
sacred institution and soldiers as heroes for defending the tiny
nation against Arab enemies.
   News of a scandal in which some citizens paid up to $10,000 in
bribes to arrange exemptions from military service dominated the
Israeli media Tuesday.
   ``A terrible tragedy has befallen the army,'' the Hadashot
newspaper editorialized. ``A mafia has overtaken one of its most
sensitive nerve centers. These actions are as bad as selling
secrets to the enemy.''

   Jack Keith is no sailor, but he has a job that
many yacht racing types might envy _ one that keeps him close to
the sport's most prestigious trophy as ``keeper of the Cup.''
   The America's Cup, that is: the 8.4-pound, 34-inch-high,
140-year-old silver trophy with elaborate Victorian curves and
flourishes for which millions of dollars are spent and court
battles fought. The Cup is once again at stake as the famed yacht
race gets under way this afternoon.
   Keith, a retired FBI agent, is charged by the defending champion
San Diego Yacht Club with protecting the precious chalice. To do
so, he has traveled first-class around the country on airplanes and
in limousines with the trophy by his side, hidden in a
specially-made leather case with a doeskin liner.

   Changes in adoption laws designed to
curb illegal ``baby trade'' have restricted the ability of
foreigners to adopt Filipino youngsters and may mean that many will
spend their childhood in orphanages.
   New regulations, which took effect Aug. 3, ban adoptions of
Filipino children by foreigners residing in the country unless at
least one prospective parent is related to the child.
   Foreigners living abroad can still adopt Filipino children
through international agencies. But prospective parents living here
will have to return to their own country and file papers there
through an international agency.

   The Farmers' Almanac expects to see a
little less snow and a lot less drought next year, but what the
172-year-old digest of Americana really wants to see less of is
pennies.
   The penny, inspiration for homely expressions that have been a
staple of almanacs since Benjamin Franklin set up shop _ ``A penny
saved is a penny earned'' is one _ has outlived its usefulness,
concludes the 1989 edition of the Farmer's Almanac.
   ``Only tradition explains our stubborn attachment to the penny.
But sometimes traditions get ridiculous,'' the almanac says, living
down its reputation as a defender of long-held values.
