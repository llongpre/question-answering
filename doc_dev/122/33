   He was a lawyer, investment banker, professor and
editor _ and only 32 when the plane he was in crashed in the
mountains of Ethiopia.
   But friends remember Ivan Tillem as a selfless man who overcame a
poor, troubled childhood to use his wealth to help others,
especially the young _ from disadvantaged children in Brooklyn to
starving children in Africa.
   ``When everyone else was talking, he was out there doing,'' said
Neal Schnall, his roommate on a 1986 trip to Ethiopia.
   Tillem was on the plane that crashed Aug. 7 in southwestern
Ethiopia, killing 16, including U.S. Rep. Mickey Leland of Texas.
Tillem, an Orthodox Jew, had worked on behalf of Ethiopians, Jewish
and otherwise, since 1986, helping establish a poultry-farming
enterprise.
   ``You can't save the world, but you can save one corner of it _
and in Ivan's case, several corners,'' said Barbara Ribakove Gordon,
executive director of the North American Conference on Ethiopian
Jews.
   ``It was very typical of him, that helping Ethiopia meant not
just sitting in New York and writing checks, but going there, going
to visit Jewish villages, putting drops in children's eyes.''
   Tillem's resume looked like that of someone twice his age:
chairman of the Pacific Financial Corp.; professor at Stern College
at Yeshiva University, where he was on the board of trustees;
publisher and editor of the Jewish Almanac, which he subsidized to
keep it affordable.
   ``It's hard to believe that one guy could do all these things,''
Schnall said. ``He used to say, `I don't have time to sleep. I've
got things I've got to do.' ''
   Among those things were establishing a scholarship fund for poor
students at Yeshiva University, and a fund for retarded and
disadvantaged children at Ohel Children's Home in Brooklyn.
   ``He had almost an obsession to make a difference,'' said
longtime friend Dennis Rapps, executive director of the National
Jewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs, where Tillem once
practiced civil rights law.
   As Tillem wrote in his preface to the Jewish Almanac, ``hunger,
despair, homelessness, blindness, deprivation, enslavement and
hopelessness'' exist alongside ``tranquility, order and privilege,''
and Jews should work to improve the ratio.
   ``That is `tikkun hoalam' _ repairing the world, for the world
can and should be different than it is,'' he wrote.
   ``He listened to what others had to say and spoke quietly,'' said
Karen Bacon, dean of Stern College for Women. ``But he was so
imaginative in his ideas.
   ``And all of them were directed toward solving problems of
humanity _ social problems, political problems. He had ideas for the
subways, for Ethiopia, for Haiti, for everybody.''
   The money for all this came from canny investments. Pacific
Financial's latest venture is Atlantic Air, a passenger airline out
of Atlantic City, N.J.
   ``He gave away most of his money,'' said Abe Bayer, director for
international affairs for the National Jewish Community Relations
Advisory Council.
   Tillem seldom spoke of his childhood, friends said, though it was
known his parents divorced and that he lived in a series of foster
homes before a rabbi in Queens took him in as a teen-ager. He was
unmarried.
   ``You got the sense that he had a thing for children, that what
happened to him wouldn't happen to anyone else,'' said Rapps.
   ``He was a very strange and enigmatic fellow,'' Bayer said. ``I
don't want to gloss this over. He was a loner, a restless,
imaginative and tortured soul. And it was shaped by a very poor and
traumatic childhood.''
