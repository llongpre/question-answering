<HEAD>World Almanac Says Symington is Governor</HEAD>

   The World Almanac appears to have jumped the gun
regarding the outcome of Arizona's gubernatorial election.
   According to The 1991 World Almanac and Book of Facts, Fife
Symington is the new governor.
   However, after the Nov. 6 general election votes were counted,
neither Republican Symington nor his Democratic opponent, Terry
Goddard, received a majority and a runoff election was declared for
Feb. 26.
   Two million copies of the almanac are hitting the bookstore
shelves this week containing the wrong information.
   ``We go to press practically as soon as the results are in on
Election Day night,'' said Martha Clarke, publicity manager for
Pharos Books, a subsidiary of Scripps Howard, which has published
the almanac since 1986.
   ``The governors of the states, except in your case, apparently,
are correct,'' Ms. Clarke said. ``Literally, the editor in chief is
writing down the results on his way to the printing press.''
   Although there is no mention of a runoff, a section titled ``The
Race for Governor: 1990'' mentions that the results are
``preliminary.''
   The almanac shows Symington with 519,558 votes to Goddard's
515,999.
   After all precincts were counted, official election results show
Symington with 523,984 to Goddard's 519,691 votes out of more than
1.09 million votes cast.
   ``They got it wrong and they'll have to change it in February,''
Goddard said. ``They'll have to buy a lot of white-out.''
   Symington, who has referred to the runoff campaign as a
``re-election'' bid, said, ``I think it's very amusing, and
hopefully, it's a good omen,'' he said.
