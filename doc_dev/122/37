   Back in the last century or thereabouts it was
pretty easy to forecast the weather by how the sky looked or how
birds, caterpillars and other creatures behaved. Anybody could do
it, and many did.
   Everybody talked about the weather, especially farmers and their
neighbors. There was talk about hard times, too, and how it seemed
nobody was doing anything about it.
   If times were good, farmers kept their mouths shut, knowing that
another drought or something bad was right around the corner.
   Not much was heard about economic forecasts, though. Somebody in
the government or a big-shot financier occasionally said something,
but scientifically developed projections did not abound.
   Today's economic forecasting, once as primitive as predicting
the weather from the loops in chicken entrails, has come a long
way, to be sure. But agricultural economists still have their
problems with weather, the greatest single variable confronting
farmers.
   And the agricultural economist's weather map is a lot bigger
these days, global, in fact. Hundreds of people in the Agriculture
Department, for example, look at and analyze world weather
conditions.
   Clark Edwards of the department's Economic Research Service says
weather isn't the only guidepost. Domestic and foreign polices of
other countries, demand trends, population growth and economic
growth are all part of the package.
   Farmers have little defense against ``uncertain events'' that
occur because of government actions or as a result of major
variations in world weaher patterns, he said. That was evident
during the agricultural boom of the 1970s and the bust of the 1980s.
   ``Who could have foretold the devastatingly late and poor
monsoon in Asia and its effect on the 1987 crop and on world
prices?'' Edwards said. ``What farmer could have said in the early
1980s, `I choose to farm in an economy with a larger money supply
and therefore with lower interest rates'?''
   Edwards added: ``Because of the unpredictability of major events
that affect the national and international agricultural economies,
it is getting harder to know how to use economic forecasts.''
   One solution would be to simply accept a forecast and act
accordingly. Farmers often do that when dealing about events and
processes with which they are familiar, he said. The likely
response of corn yields to fertilizer applications, or milk yields
in response to feeding rates are examples.
   And some economic forecasts are hedged by giving users a set of
possible outcomes that illustrate the uncertainties. For example,
the agency's forecast of net cash farm income this year is in a
range of $50 billion to $55 billion.
   ``A farm equipment manufacturer for whom this forecast is
important might determine then consequences if the actual outcome
is at one end of the range or the other, and then attach a degree
of confidence to each of the two outcomes,'' Edwards said. ``Using
this information, a manager can work out the best position to take.
This is one way to allow for known risks.''
   But Edwards acknowledged in an article published in the May
issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine that it is getting harder
for farmers to make decisions when they are increasingly faced by
uncertainties caused by events which they can neither predict nor
control.
   ``Greater exposure to these uncertainties has come along with
U.S. farmers' increasing dependence on world markets,'' he said.
``Two major sources of risk ... are climatic events in other
hemispheres and the policies and actions of governments.''
   A classic example of a global influence on American farmers is
the Soviet Union. Since 1972, when Moscow secretly bought the
equivalent of one-fourth of that year's U.S. wheat crop, weather in
the Soviet Union has been watched almost as intently as it is in
Kansas and Iowa.
   The huge 1972 purchases led to a bilateral agreement several
years later, pledging the Soviet Union to buy U.S. wheat and corn
on a sustained annual basis. That was one attempt to soften some of
the variables connected with the export trade.
   ``United States and Soviet government policy changes can
exacerbate the effect that Russian weather patterns have on U.S.
wheat producers,'' Edwards said. ``There was a time when the
U.S.S.R. tended to tighten its collective belt after a short crop.
Now the Soviets are more likely to seek imports to stabilize their
livestock economy, with larger needs in some years and smaller
needs in others.''
   The Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, is a more recent example
of the U.S. government trying to soften some of the variables for
American farmers by providing subsidies of taxpayer-owned surplus
grain to exporters so they can sell wheat and other designated
commodities to selected foreign buyers, including the Soviet Union,
at bargain prices.
   Other USDA activities, such as the Targeted Export Asssistance
program, or TEA, help promote U.S. commodities in foreign markets.
   It's all part of the forecasting business and must be taken into
consideration when department economists make predictions.
   ``Still, farmers' plans based on forecasts can receive as great
a shock from, say, the weather affecting the soybean crop in South
America this May and June as from the weather on their own farm,''
Edwards said.
