   Do this winter's mild, dry conditions in many parts of the nation
bode ill for the 1989 growing season? Is the unusual weather causing
problems already? It depends on where the questions are asked, and
of whom. Here are the findings of Associated Press reporters who
surveyed each region.

<NOTE>The Corn Belt</NOTE>

   The fear of a second drought looms over pockets of the still
parched Corn Belt, where it's premature to predict another year of
pain, but not too early to worry about whether a mild winter will
bring farmers a harsh spring.
   Though thousands of acres of Midwest farm fields were ravaged by
the drought of '88, much of the eastern Corn Belt _ an area east of
the Mississippi River _ is in moderately good shape because of
abundant rain last fall.
   ``We've come a long way from where we were at the end of the
growing season,'' said Norton Strommen, chief meteorologist for the
U.S. Agriculture Department. ``It will be very important to see what
happens in the next three months filling in holes where it remains
dry.''
   Experts say west-central Illinois, eastern Iowa, northern
Missouri and southern Minnesota have yet to recover from the drought.
   The difference in Corn Belt conditions is reflected in
precipitation since Oct. 1. The western section received 74 percent
of normal precipitation, while the eastern Corn Belt received 119
percent, said Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of the Weather
Services Corporation in Massachusetts.
   Even with above average rains, conditions are so dry it'll take
time for the baked earth to return to rich black prairie soil.
Though Iowa had normal moisture since August, it still had only
21.64 inches of precipitation in 1988, the lowest level since 1910,
said state climatologist Harry Hillaker.
   ``It's going to take six to 12 months of normal rain to get
things back to the way it should be,'' he said.
   Dry weather not only affects corn, but another major Midwest crop
_ soybeans, which in 1988 were at their lowest production level
since 1976: 1.54 billion bushels.
   Beyond crops, the unusually warm, snow-scarce winter has
disappointed Wisconsin snowmobilers, postponed some farm equipment
purchases and led some Iowa towns to dig new wells.
   Still, experts say there's no reason to panic _ now.
   ``It's too early to worry about not having a crop,'' said Neil
Harl, an Iowa State University economics professor. ``But it's not
too early to worry about the consequences if you did.''

<NOTE>The Northeast</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   It's been a hard winter for Virginia Cochran, owner of a
Richmond, Vt., ski area. Not because of winter weather, but because
of the lack of it.
   ``I thought last year was bad in terms of lack of snow,'' she
said, ``but compared to this year, it was pretty good.''
   Scarcity of snow isn't a worry just to small ski operators.
Officials throughout the Northeast are keeping a nervous eye on
half-filled water reservoirs. Farmers fret about soil moisture.
Businesses selling snowmobiles and snowplows are hurting.
   ``This is disastrous,'' said Steve Kitchen, who has sold half the
usual number of snow tires at his Biddeford, Maine, service station.
   The winter of 1988-89 is likely to be remembered as the Winter of
No Snow.
   ``This has been the driest January in 104 years,'' said Richard
Mamrosh, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Burlington, Vt.
Vermont's Champlain Valley has had 19.9 inches of snow compared to
the normal average of 42 inches.
   The story is the same from Maine as far south as Maryland.
``Generally, we have had below normal snowfall,'' said Frank
Lucadamo, a hydrologist with the weather service's Northeast River
Forecast Center. ``If this continues we could see some problems.''
   Problems are already evident. Officials in Massachusetts, New
York and New Jersey have issued warnings about water supplies.
Reservoirs that supply some big Eastern cities are about 30 percent
below normal levels.
   ``Not only are we well below what we normally are, but there is
no snow upstate and you rely on the melt off of that snowpack in the
spring,'' said Tina Casey, a spokeswoman for the New York City
Department of Environmental Protection.
   The lack of a snowpack has had a wide range of effects. The
Finance Authority of Maine plans to provide $1 million in emergency
loans to struggling shopkeepers who can't find buyers for snow
machines. Farmers in New Hampshire fear the lack of snow cover will
kill off alfalfa fields.
   Buffalo, N.Y.'s city boosters are having problems organizing the
city's annual winter festival. ``We might as well call it
``Summerfest,'' said Robert Carr, a spokesman for the Greater
Buffalo Chamber of Commerce.

<NOTE>The Great Plains</NOTE>

   As the drought of 1988 becomes the drought of '89, the nation's
breadbasket is worried about producing half a loaf this year.
   Last year's drought hit hard at the Great Plains states, which
produce most of the hard red winter wheat, the primary grain in
bread.
   Lack of moisture this winter in the heartland has agronomists and
statisticians nervous because another below-average crop could
further deplete America's grain reserves and raise food prices.
   Planted in the fall, winter wheat lies dormant until spring, when
it matures and ripens. It is harvested in the summer.
   Farmers in Kansas, the country's No. 1 wheat-growing state, and
Nebraska, Colorado, Montana, and the Dakotas all say they've been
short-changed on moisture since 1980, with last year's drought the
worst on record for many of them.
   In the past few months rain and snowfall have been sparse and
spotty. Eastern Montana and North Dakota are a little better off
than the last two years, Kansas and Nebraska are a little worse.
Colorado is about even. In South Dakota, which lost 68 percent of
its wheat crop last year, the autumn rains didn't come.
   ``At the end of the year we were about seven inches behind in
annual precipitation,'' said Eldon Thiessen, deputy statistician for
the Kansas Agricultural Statistics office. ``The ground was so dry
this fall the wheat never developed a good root system. The soil is
so loose that if the wind starts to blow the crop will be
destroyed.''
   Sumner County, Kan., annually produces more wheat than any other
county in the nation. Last year its farmers harvested 13.8 million
bushels, but county extension agent Gerald LeValley says an
unusually warm winter, lack of snow and rain and the appearance of
bugs in January all have him worried.
