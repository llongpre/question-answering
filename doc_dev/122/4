   Rest easy America! Abe Weatherwise,
prognosticator of the Old Farmer's Almanac, says it'll be a mild
winter across most of the country. And New Englanders can expect a
white Christmas.
   Abe, who claims 80 percent accuracy in ``America's oldest
continuously published periodical,'' says only the northern third
of the country will have more snow than usual.
   The 198th edition of the 224-page almanac hits the newsstands
and supermarkets this week with its familiar planting and tide
tables, anecdotes and other tidbits, such as 100 ways how to avoid
untimely death. (No. 49. Avoid combing hair in the dark; No. 77.
Never whistle in a coal mine.)
   Abe, a collective pseudonym, says the almanac's predictions are
``based on state-of-the art analysis of recurring solar cycles.''
He predicts that a cold, wet and snowy spring in the North will be
balanced by warm, dry spring weather west of the Mississippi.
   The summer of 1990, says Abe, will be hot and dry in many areas
east of the Rockies.
   In Canada, where 300,000 of the 4 million copies of the
customary yellow-covered almanac will be sold, heavier than average
snow is forecast from Quebec through the prairie provinces.
   ``The more serious the weather, the larger percentage we sell,''
says Executive Editor Tim Clark. ``They count on us more in Alberta
than in Alabama.''
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is the legal document for tides and
sunrises and sunsets in most states. In addition to giving readers
weather predictions, advertisements for hernia appliances, secrets
of winning lotteries and rules of thumb for rhubarb pie, the
almanac advises that cows and pigs bred for leanness will boost the
popularity of red meat and inflation will run at 6 percent.
   The almanac also predicts the return of 4-inch-wide neckties for
men, short hair for women and lower prices for videocassette
recorders.
   The Old Farmer's Almanac is not to be confused with its upstart
rival, the Farmer's Almanac, which is about a third as thick, 23
years younger, and is given away to businesses for advertising
purposes.
   The distinguishing trademark of the Old Farmer's Almanac is a
hole in the corner, put there at great expense and inconvenience,
its publishers say, to preserve the tradition of hanging the book
on a nail in the pantry or outhouse.
