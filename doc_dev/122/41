   Drought across broad patches of the nation is shriveling crops
and pastures, driving up grain prices and leaving some farm workers
jobless. Community water use restrictions are in place in
California, the Midwest and the Southeast.
   ``It's not total destruction for all these crops yet, but
another week or two of dry weather is going to put us near the
point of no return,'' said Richard Grove, agricultural extension
agent for Seneca County, Ohio.
   In addition, low water threatens to disrupt shipping on rivers
in the South and hydroelectricity there and in the Northwest.
   These are the problem areas:
   _Southeast: Parts of the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and
Alabama have had below-normal rainfall for up to four years.
Atlanta and six surrounding counties have water conservation
programs.
   The hardest-hit reservoir is North Carolina's Fontana Lake,
which is 45 feet below normal. Some private wells have gone dry in
North Carolina.
   _Midwest and northern Plains: A hot, dry spring and less than
normal winter snow has left the soil so dry in some places that
seeds didn't germinate. Some farmers in northwestern Ohio have
plowed crops under rather than spend more money on fertilizer.
North Dakota Gov. George Sinner says the drought is the worst since
the 1930s.
   Thunderstorms on Sunday produced much-needed rain over parts of
the Dakotas and northwestern Minnesota. Mobridge, S.D., got 1.47
inches of rain in six hours and Jamestown, N.D., got 0.8 inch, but
the region will need more rain to replace subsoil moisture.
   Areas of Illinois are restricting water use and residents in the
Chicago suburb of Long Grove complain about dry wells, saying they
suspect their neighbors of using all the water. Long Grove
administrator D.M. Doughty said one woman's well ran dry while her
neighbor across the street had three or four sprinklers going.
``It's kind of hard to love your neighbor,'' he said.
   The northern Plains' problem is shared by farmers in Canada,
where Old Wives Lake, a 12-mile-wide expanse south of Moose Jaw,
Saskatchewan, is bone dry for the first time since 1937.
   _West Coast: San Francisco and Los Angeles have imposed
mandatory water rationing in the wake of light winter snow in the
mountains, where the snowpack is a natural reservoir. Growers have
been told that irrigation allotments may be cut.
   That lack of snow also has left hydroelectric reservoirs falling
on the Columbia River in Washington, at the same time water must be
released from those reservoirs to help migrating salmon.
   During the past month, the grain futures market in Chicago has
surged upward as traders bet on smaller and smaller harvests.
Soybean futures rose 25 percent during the past month and last week
broke the $9-a-bushel barrier, highest since late 1983. Oats traded
up by the daily limit _ 10 cents, raised to 15 cents at midweek _
on four of the five trading days last week.
   The market opened sharply lower Wednesday after reports that
parts of west-central Iowa got rain, with 5.2 inches at Coon Rapids
and 1.79 at Des Moines. But other parts of the state stayed dry.
   The price of soybeans for July delivery closed slightly lower
Friday on the strength of forecasts for rain early this week, but
that was a decline of just 2 cents.
   Iowa's statistical bureau said the state's pastures were at
their June 1 driest since 1956.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department cited dry weather on the Plains
in May when it reported that farmers were harvesting an estimated
1.57 billion bushels of winter wheat. That's slightly more than
last year but 3 percent _ 50 million bushels _ less than a
prediction issued a month earlier.
   ``Corn is just lying there. Not enough moisture to germinate it.
Some early corn is barely surviving,'' said Bobby Peek,
agricultural extension agent in Buncombe County, N.C. ``Transplants
of tobacco are dying. They stood there for a few days, and now
they're starting to die. I never have known a spring like this and
nobody you talk to has, either.''
   The situation is acute for dairy farmers because grass to feed
livestock is wilting or not growing as fast as usual, and they also
depend on hay grown at this time of year to feed their animals in
the winter.
   The Agriculture Department is already allowing farmers to cut
hay or let animals graze on land that was set aside for crop
reduction or conservation in struggling counties in Montana, the
Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana
and Ohio.
   Some farmers are selling cattle earlier than usual to avoid
rising feed prices.
   ``Normally, we have two to three cuttings of alfalfa a year. The
yield from the first cutting was way down and there won't be much
of a second cutting,'' said Don Keyes of the Minnesota Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service. Much of the state has had
less than half normal rain this year.
   Hundreds of migrant workers who journey north to the Red River
Valley along the upper Minnesota-North Dakota border every year to
thin and weed sugar beets are finding there's no work waiting for
them.
   Growers replanted 150,000 acres of sugar beet plants after a
killing frost, but the new seedlings can't take root in the dry
soil and are blown about like tumbleweeds.
