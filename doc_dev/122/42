Edward Abbey, the irreverent writer and impassioned environmentalist whose 
popular books perpetuated their author's dream of seeing "the whole American 
West made into a wilderness," has died in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
The man dubbed "the Thoreau of the American West" by "Lonesome Dove" author 
Larry McMurtry died Tuesday at his home at age 62 of internal bleeding caused 
by a circulatory disorder, said Jack Macrae, a friend who also is 
editor-in-chief of Henry Holt &amp; Co., Abbey's publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Abbey recently had completed a draft of "Hayduke Lives," a sequel to his 
best-known book, "The Monkey Wrench Gang," which told of a group of 
environmentalists plotting to blow up Arizona's Glen Canyon Dam. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of paperback copies of "The Monkey Wrench Gang" were sold 
after its publication in 1976, making Abbey a sort of underground hero to the 
burgeoning environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
His writings have been credited by founders of the hard-line environmental 
group Earth First! with providing the underpinnings of their philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
"Hayduke Lives" would be the 20th book by the one-time park ranger, firefighter 
and political radical. 
</P>
<P>
The renegade outdoorsman once said there was nothing wrong with throwing beer 
cans out car windows, since paved roads were abominations and unworthy of 
respect. He had grown to hate the survey stakes, aircraft and golf courses that 
marred his once-pristine desert landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Anthologies refer to him as "irascible," "cantankerous," "iconoclastic" and 
"crusty." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey himself resisted simple summations, even those calling him 
environmentalist or naturalist. "If a label is required," he once wrote, "say 
that I am one who loves the unfenced country." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that he found himself "getting more radical as I get older," 
as he told The Times last year, he was not without a sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago Outside magazine asked Abbey for an almanac of the high and low 
points of the 1975-85 decade. 
</P>
<P>
Under "Low Point" he wrote: "Beef ranchers in Montana and Wyoming harvest 155 
'troublesome' grizzlies." 
</P>
<P>
The "High Point" read: "Grizzlies in Montana and Wyoming harvest 22 
'troublesome' tourists." 
</P>
<P>
In "One Life at a Time Please" he offered essays guaranteed to offend everyone 
he touched. Cattlemen were "nothing more than Western parasites." Recent 
arrivals to the West were "instant rednecks." 
</P>
<P>
But Abbey represented far more than the wise-cracking, one-time farm boy he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
In a review of "Desert Solitaire," Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edwin Way 
Teale noted that Abbey's work as a park ranger had brought him to the 
wilderness before the invasion of "the parked trailers, their windows blue 
tinged at night while the inmates, instead of watching the desert stars, watch 
TV and listen to the canned laughter of Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
He called Abbey "a voice crying in the wilderness, for the wilderness." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey was born on a small farm in Appalachia and, after a stint in the Army, 
hitchhiked West in 1946. He studied English and philosophy at the University of 
New Mexico and turned to writing while supporting himself at odd jobs. 
</P>
<P>
He worked off and on for both the National Park Service and the Forest Service 
as a road inspector, auto assembly line worker and ditch digger. 
</P>
<P>
"I pounded survey stakes before I ever got the notion to pull them out," he 
told The Times in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Although he became a champion of the outdoors, he was not one to rhapsodize its 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
He faulted writers "gushing about finding God in every bush." 
</P>
<P>
"I sat on a rock in New Mexico once," he said, "trying to have a vision. The 
only vision I had was of baked chicken." 
</P>
<P>
Abbey's most recent novel, "The Fool's Progress," was published late last year. 
His other books included "Good News," a futuristic novel about life in America; 
"The Journey Home," "Down the River," "Beyond the Wall" and "Abbey's Road." 
</P>
<P>
For years he had lived in the Sonora desert in a modest home with a chain-link 
fence enclosing a stand of palms. 
</P>
<P>
His writing studio stood out back ringed by the toys that were testament to the 
children who lived there (he and his wife had two while he had three from four 
previous marriages). 
</P>
<P>
Known not at all for his religious beliefs, he wrote what could only be called 
an invocation in his "Desert Solitaire," a 1968 book he said was inspired by 
"two seamless perfect seasons" with the Arches Park Service in Utah: 
</P>
<P>
"May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous, leading to the most 
amazing view. 
</P>
<P>
"May your rivers . . . meander through pastoral valleys tinkling with bells, 
past temples and castles and poets' towers into a dark primeval forest where 
tigers belch and monkeys howl. . . ."
