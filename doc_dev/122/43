   Yankee Publishing Inc. has agreed to sell
New England Business magazine to a group of investors led by
William Koch, president of Oxbow Corp. of Dedham, Mass.
   Terms of the agreement, signed Monday, were not disclosed. The
purchase is expected to be completed early next month.
   The new owners plan to continue publishing the 90,000
circulation monthly, said Oxbow Vice President Richard Bird, who
will be the magazine's chief executive officer.
   The sale ``is part of Yankee Publishing's restructuring to focus
its attention on circulation-driven consumer publications,'' said
Joseph Meagher, Yankee Publishing president.
   Yankee publishes Yankee Magazine, Alaska Magazine, The Old
Farmer's Almanac and Yankee Homes.
