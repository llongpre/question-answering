<CAPTION>  Photo; LEFT OUT -- Alaska Gov. Walter Hickel didn't get into Information
Please this year.  </CAPTION>
<LEADPARA>  One national almanac lists the wrong man as Alaska's governor, and another
lists a lieutenant governor who is out of office.;    In the first case,
somebody goofed. In the second, a rushed deadline was the culprit.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  TRIVIAL PURSUITS IN ALMANACS A HOOT
WHO'S ALASKA'S GOVERNOR IS NOW A TRICK QUESTION  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The 1991 Information Please Almanac Atlas and Yearbook lists Tony Knowles
as governor of the 49th state. Oops!;    Knowles, a former Anchorage mayor,
was the Democratic candidate for governor in November's general election and
had been an early favorite to win. Walter Hickel, a former Alaska governor and
interior secretary in the Nixon cabinet, jumped into the race late in the game
and won as an independent.;    Trouble is, nobody apparently told the folks at
Information Please Almanac in New York.;    "This is baffling," Otto Johnson,
editor of the almanac, said when notified of the mistake Wednesday.;    "I'm
embarrassed," Johnson said. "I don't know what to say. I'm very unhappy about
it.";    A competing desk reference, the World Almanac and Book of Facts for
1991, lists Hickel as governor, but has Stephen McAlpine down as lieutenant
governor, a post McAlpine vacated last month.;    "It's not an error. It's
simply the timing," said World Almanac editor Mark Hoffman, noting that a
footnote explains all officials listed below the status of governor were in
office as of mid-1990.;    In order to hit the bookstores before the Christmas
buying season, the World Almanac began printing three days after the Nov. 6
election. Only some last-minute results could be plugged in, Hoffman said.
Governors made the cut. Lieutenant governors didn't.;    Johnson said entries
also had come down to the wire for his publication, and somebody dropped the
ball on election reporting.;    He said he will write Hickel apologizing for
the slip.;    Hickel spokeswoman Vivian Hamilton said the governor had been
told of the error and was entertained.;    "He though it was pretty funny,"
she said. "This is just a hoot."  </TEXT>
