<LEADPARA>  THE moon's gravitational pull influences the ocean tide, but does it also help
or hinder growth?;    Proponents believe crops are to be planted above ground
when the moon goes from the first to second quarters (new moon to full moon)
and below ground in the third and fourth quarters (full moon to new moon).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Seedsman Ed Hume has been publishing a moon-sign gardening almanac for 26
years, listing the best or worst times to do things such as plant seeds or
fertilize.;    The 1991 almanac includes this challenge: "Plant some of your
crops using this moon guide. Next to those crops, plant a few of the same on
the wrong moon sign." Hume promises a package of seeds for notes on the
results, good or bad.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The 1991 moon almanac, $1.50 from
Ed Hume Seeds, P.O. Box 1450, Kent, Wash., 98035.  </TEXT>
