   An elderly South Texas weather prognosticator
assures George Bush's inaugural planners their worst nightmare _ a
snowstorm _ won't come true to ruin the festivities surrounding
Bush's swearing-in as president on Jan. 20.
   ``This old gentleman from South Texas sent me his almanac, which
said the period from Jan. 19 to Jan. 23 will have sunny, warm and
pleasant weather in Washington, D.C.,'' said Bobby Holt, general
co-chairman of the President-elect's Inaugural Committee.
   Holt, a millionaire oil and gas tycoon and old friend of the vice
president from Midland, Texas, told reporters Wednesday he couldn't
recall the amateur weatherman's name and couldn't vouch for his
accuracy.
   ``I'm scared to call him and ask about his track record,'' Holt
said with a nervous laugh. He admitted the threat of a heavy storm
during the inauguration was ``a constant worry.''
   The National Weather Service said it couldn't predict
Washington's weather that far ahead, except to say that average
temperatures during the five days of inaugural events will range
from 43 degrees to a low of 27.
   One of the worst inaugural snowstorms in modern memory occurred
the night before John F. Kennedy took the presidential oath in 1960.
The storm dumped eight inches of snow on Washington, halting all
traffic and stranding guests trying to reach inaugural events.
   Army troops shoveled Pennsylvania Avenue clear of snowdrifts, and
by noon on Jan. 20 it was clear, sunny and 22 degrees when a hatless
Kennedy took the oath on the East Front steps of the Capitol.
   Because of extreme cold in January 1985, President Reagan moved
his official swearing-in for a second term from the West Front of
the Capitol inside to the Rotunda, and the traditional inaugural
parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House was canceled.
