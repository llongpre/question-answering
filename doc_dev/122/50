   Two years ago, Carl Marriott's farm fields were dusty, his
soybeans were shriveled, his prospects bleak. This spring, he has a
different brown, sickly crop, but there's a different culprit: rain.
   Yes, rain, the manna from heaven Midwest farmers hoped and
prayed for these past few years, has flooded fields, delayed
planting and damaged crops. But survivors of one _ or even two _
consecutive droughts aren't complaining.
   ``We just roll with the punches. We've got options we can pull
out of the bag when it's wet,'' said Marriott, a southern Illinois
farmer who may lose a quarter of his waterlogged wheat crop. ``When
it's dry, there's nothing we can do.''
   ``We've been biting our tongues,'' said Mark White, a Chariton,
Iowa, farmer whose fields were parched in 1988 and '89, then too
muddy to work all last month. ``I'll take a wet year over a dry
year anytime. At least you've got a chance to grow something.''
   After the most devastating decade in half a century, marred by
drought, high interest rates and plummeting land values, many
farmers have entered the 1990s with one of the wettest springs in
recent times and the brightest outlook in 10 years.
   ``The farmer is in the best shape he's been since 1980,'' said
Gregory Hanson, an economist at the U.S. Agriculture Department.
``We've got rising land values ... rising sales, rising investment.
I'm not trying to paint a Pollyanna picture _ on the other hand,
there's the famous rubber ball theory of economics: What bounced
down is now bouncing up.''
   Though an unseasonably cool, wet spring may prevent a bumper
crop, the economic forecast is promising: cash income for the farm
sector, which includes government subsidies, has been projected at
$55 billion to $59 billion for 1990 _ a record if it reaches the
outer limit and better than last year's estimated $54 billion.
   Hog and cattle prices are at or near record levels, corn prices
are up because the surplus is down, farm exports have increased,
land values are expected to rise about 4 percent in 1990 _ about
the same level they did in 1989 _ and machinery sales have jumped
by 50 percent in the last four years.
   ``When I look at the farm economy, I look at a growth sector,''
Hanson said. ``Ten years ago, it was a sector ready to take a
fall.''
   The national farm debt, which peaked in 1983 at $206 billion,
could dip to as low as $145 billion in 1990, he said.
   Farmers who survived the '80s are smarter and more careful about
their purchases, said Neil Harl, an economics professor at Iowa
State University.
   ``Some have been burned, some were singed, some were just close
to the heat,'' he said. At the same time, he added, ``Lenders are
more cautious and conservative.''
   As the new decade begins, some signs of a turnaround are due to
the weather, some to a reversal in economic fortunes. For example:
   _ In Kansas, a record winter wheat crop is forecast for 1990 _
460.2 million bushels, more than double last year's
drought-battered 213.6 million bushels.
   ``They're laughing,'' Jim Shroyer, extension agronomist at
Kansas State University said of the farmers. ``They're really
looking forward to harvest. This really lifts their spirits.''
   Nationally, winter wheat production is expected to reach a
nine-year high of 2 billion bushels, despite some losses from wet
weather.
   _ In Iowa, land values jumped nearly 45 percent from 1986 to
1989, though they're still far below 1981 peak levels. Less than
one in five farmers had significant money troubles last year,
compared with a third in 1986, Harl said.
   _ In Minnesota, state officials say soil moisture is the best it
has been since November 1986.
   Despite such optimistic signs, drought persists in areas,
including Florida and parts of Colorado. In California, in its
fourth straight dry year, reservoirs are low enough that the state
and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation cut in half the amount of this
year's irrigation water to farmers.
   And in the upper Midwest, even though puddles in the fields make
people smile _ a recent wet spell in North Dakota was dubbed the
``million-dollar'' rain _ they haven't convinced anyone the drought
is over.
   ``By no means are we out of the woods,'' said Tim Edman, special
assistant to South Dakota Gov. George Mickelson. ``If we go back to
the 90-degree-plus windy, dry weather conditions, we could be
facing a proble very quickly just as serious as the last two
years.''
   In 1988, all of South Dakota was declared a drought disaster
area; last year, it was two-thirds of the state.
   While many cursed the drought, others now say rainy, cool
weather is no blessing.
   In Michigan, for example, some apple growers say it's reduced
their crop. In Missouri, a fourth of the corn is in poor or very
poor shape, and planting is five weeks behind schedule. And in
Illinois, pastures with water belly-high to the livestock and
fields too muddy to put a tractor in have farmers worried.
   ``It's rained so much our wheat is full of blight,'' said Herman
Krone, who welcomed then-President Reagan to his shriveled southern
Illinois farm fields in 1988. ``Instead of ripening, it's dying in
standing water. ... It's been 43 years since I've seen something
like this.''
   But it's too early to make dire predictions, and dry, sunny days
last week allowed many farmers to get back into the fields. Some
also say as time runs out to plant corn, they may switch to
soybeans, which have a later growing season.
   That's an option for Marriott, a fourth-generation farmer who
normally would have planted all his corn by now but had completed
less than 5 percent by the second week of June, a situation to
which he's resigned.
   ``Farming is hills and valleys,'' he said. ``You have good crops
some years, and some years, good prices _ seldom together.''
   ``It's either feast or famine,'' said Bill Million, agriculture
extension adviser in Adams County, in western Illinois. ``Farmers
are just taking it one day at a time.''
   Not long ago, Million said, they looked to the skies for
salvation _ rain.
   ``Now they're praying for it to stop _ just a bit,'' he said.
``Typical human beings, we're never satisfied.''
