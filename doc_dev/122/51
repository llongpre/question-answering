   Insects Start Resisting
   Safe Type of Pesticide

   PESTS are fighting back against safer pesticides.
   The pesticides are based on Bacillus thuringiensis
bacteria that make toxins fatal to insect pests, such as
caterpillars, but harmless to animals and humans. Sales of Bt
sprays have taken off in recent years as harmful insects have
become resistant to synthetic chemical pesticides and as
farmers have been pressured to cut their use of the
chemicals.
   But now there's a Bt problem: Farmers in Hawaii, Florida,
New York and the Far East have reported that a major pest,
the diamondback moth, has become resistant to it. The moths,
found on cabbages and watercress, aren't hurting growers much
yet. But increasing Bt resistance may blunt a major new
weapon against pests -- plants genetically engineered to
produce Bt's toxins. Within a few years, Monsanto and others
hope to introduce cotton, potato and tomato plants able to
make their own Bt toxins.
   Bt resistance won't necessarily spread to other pests and
places, says Randy Deaton, a Monsanto research manager.
Besides, he adds, plants could be engineered to produce
multiple Bt toxins, making it unlikely pests would evolve
with the right combination of genes to resist all the toxins.
   But over the years, some insects have evolved "multiple"
resistance to different chemical pesticides, notes Cornell
University entomologist Rick Roush. Thus, he says, "managing
insect resistance is a matter of delaying."
                                                                                                       

   Rate of Increase Slows
   For One Greenhouse Gas
                                                                                                       

   THE ATMOSPHERE'S level of methane is rising less rapidly
than it did a decade ago.
   Carbon dioxide, released when things are burned, is the
main greenhouse gas, trapping heat from the sun and possibly
causing global warming. But methane traps heat about 20 times
more effectively than carbon dioxide does. Released by rice
paddies, wetlands, landfills and the digestive processes of
cattle, methane is estimated to contribute about 20% of the
greenhouse effect.
   In the early 1980s, atmospheric methane rose more than 1%
a year, says Aslam Khalil, a climate researcher at the Oregon
Graduate Institute of Science and Technology. Now the rate of
increase has fallen to about 0.8%, perhaps because the growth
of rice and cattle farming has leveled off.
   But that's not necessarily good news. Methane helps
counteract the thinning of the ozone layer caused by the
release of chlorofluorocarbons, and the ozone layer blocks
cancer-causing solar rays. Thus, climate experts proposing
major cuts in methane levels to counteract global warming may
be making a big mistake, Dr. Khalil argues.
   Still, "it's tempting to work on methane" to help ward off
warming, says Ralph Cicerone, a researcher at the University
of California at Irvine. That's mainly because cutting its
emissions would yield much greater gains against the
greenhouse effect than cutting the same amount of carbon
dioxide emissions, he adds.
                                                                                                       

   Refillable Bottles
   Are Slow to Come Back
                                                                                                       

   REFILLABLE beverage containers cut trash and save energy
and money.
   Indeed, refilling bottles is generally cheaper and better
for the environment than breaking them down and recycling
them. But don't count on a big comeback soon for refillables.
The logistics work best for small, local bottlers with
limited distribution areas, and now the bottling industry is
dominated by larger, regional companies, says Scott Chaplin,
a researcher at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a think tank in
Snowmass, Colo.
   In 1990, about 8.7% of U.S. soft drinks came in
refillables, down from 56% in 1975. Despite growing use of
refillable beer bottles in some states, refillables' overall
share of the U.S. packaged beer market fell last year to an
estimated 7.5% from 7.8% in 1989, says Robert S. Weinberg, a
beer-industry expert at Washington University in St. Louis.
   But refillables are becoming more common for some things,
most notably milk. Sales of caps for refillable milk
containers have risen about 15% annually during the past
three years, says Murray Bain, marketing manager at Stanpac,
a Smithville, Ontario, maker of the caps. Beachhurst Farms,
which delivers milk to homes in the New York City area, says
it now carries refillables on 33 routes, up from 13 last
year. Schroeder's Milk, St. Paul, Minn., says sales in
refillables have risen fivefold in the past three years.
   The dairy industry "still has remnants of little
processors that haven't changed much from the 1950s," says
Steven Rasmussen, president of Castle Creamery in Hayward,
Calif. Thus, it has had little trouble expanding the use of
refillables for nostalgic and environmentally aware
consumers.
                                                                                                       

   For Environmentalists,
   A 606-Page Almanac
                                                                                                       

   HOUGHTON MIFFLIN has published a $10 almanac claiming to
have "everything you need to know about the environment."
   That's debatable, of course. But the 606-page
"Environmental Almanac," compiled for Houghton Mifflin by the
World Resources Institute, a Washington think tank, may offer
more environmental data than any other single book.
   Some excerpts: Federal regulators found pesticide residues
in 82% of celery shipments in 1987. Anyone who cuts down a
tree in Vienna must replace it. Jefferson County, La., has
higher emissions of cancer-causing chemicals than any other
U.S. county. In a ranking of 64 U.S. cities by environmental
quality and awareness, the almanac lists Honolulu No. 1 and
Santa Ana, Calif., No. 64.
