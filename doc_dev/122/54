<HEAD>National Wheatgrowers Official Fears Another Season Of Drought</HEAD>

   The new president of the National
Wheatgrowers Association expects another season of drought,
predicting it could ruin some farmers who survived last year's lack
of moisture.
   Reggie Wyckoff of Genoa, a third-generation Colorado farmer who
operates a 6,000-acre farm homesteaded by his grandfather, became
president of the 60,000-member wheatgrowers group last week and
immediately made some pessimistic observations.
   ``Everywhere I've been this fall and winter except in
(southeastern) Washington state, everybody is dry,'' said Wyckoff.
His organization, active in 18 states, represents farmers producing
85 percent of the nation's wheat.
   ``I was in Montana in December, and there was absolutely no snow,
50-degree weather, and they have no reserve moisture in their soil
at all,'' he said. ``Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota are all
dry, and they'll need a lot of moisture to make a good crop.''
   Wyckoff said the winter wheat crop now in the ground is fairly
resilient and still can be saved with timely spring rains and snows.
   Noting that last year's small wheat crop and export demand cut
surplus wheat from 2 billion bushels to 530 million bushels, Wyckoff
said, ``If we had another short crop this year, it could mean some
tremendously high prices for farmers. But what good is that if you
don't have anything to sell?''
   He said even Colorado, which dodged the drought and produced good
crops last year, is far drier this winter on the plains.
   ``If you measure precipitation in October and November compared
to previous years, it's the second-driest in 81 years,'' said Wayne
Shawcroft, a Colorado State University scientist at the Agricultural
Research Station in Akron.
   ``If you measure the last four months of 1988, it's the 10th
driest in 81 years,'' Shawcroft said.
   Mike Gillespie, snow survey supervisor for the U.S. Soil
Conservation Service, said snowpack in the Colorado mountains was 94
percent of normal on Jan. 1. While the snowpack is comforting to
farmers who work Colorado's 900,000 irrigated acres of corn and
wheat, it provides little solace to farmers who grow wheat on 2.3
million acres of non-irrigated land on the eastern plains.
   ``Precipitation on the plains in the Arkansas River Basin has
been only 65 percent of average, and in the South Platte Basin, it's
been only 68 percent of average, so the plains have been dry since
the first of October,'' said Gillespie.
   He said Idaho, Wyoming, Montana and Utah are having another in a
series of ``very dry winters'' with snowpack ranging from 80 percent
to 96 percent of normal.
   ``We're not doing real well in those areas. They could use
above-average snowpacks just to make up the deficits they've had in
their storage reservoirs,'' said Gillespie.
