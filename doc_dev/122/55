<LEADPARA>  Erector sets and push-up bras will be fashionable in 1992, and the lowly hot
dog will become a "haute" dog, "The American Forecaster Almanac 1992"
predicts.;   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will run out of steam, body building
will lose its mainstream following and the commitment to environmentalism will
wane, said the Forecaster's author, Kim Long.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The ninth annual Forecaster arrived at bookstores last week. It said baby
boomers continue to drive virtually every cultural trend in the nation as they
have for 30 years.;   "What are these people doing in their 40s and 50s? One
thing you can count on is something between outrageous and unusual behavior
for fun," Long said. "It won't be necessarily frivolous, because these people
still have social consciences.";   One thing is certain -- the boomers won't
let go of the decade when they came of age, the 1960s, Long said. In 1992,
platform shoes, high-top canvas tennis shoes and long, straight hair for women
-- all fashions from 25 years ago -- will be hot, he predicted.;   "The '60s
is still developing as a trend. It's more than a fad. It's become a permanent
part of the fashion culture. In a year or so, it will be like a type of
clothing, an accepted icon, like Western wear," Long said.;   Also on Long's
"what's hot" list for 1992 are day care for dogs, bottled water with an
alcoholic kick, longer hemlines for women, quieter appliances and powdered
water -- dried vegetable fat that encapsulates water, then releases it when
heat is applied.;   President Bush probably will be re-elected, the
"dress-for-less" trend will gain momentum and men's ties will become blander
and possibly narrower after a period of wild patterns, bright colors and
wideness, Long said.;   Long makes his predictions after consulting hundreds
of sources, including scores of trade publications and interviews with
industry experts.; THE FORECAST; In for 1992:; (box) Long, straight hair;
