<LEADPARA>  Q  Can you find out who performs the version of "Rhapsody in Blue" heard on
the United Airlines TV commercials? I think they use a different version on
radio, but the TV version is wonderful.;    -- S.M., Newark  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A  Your ears didn't deceive you. Different versions of the George Gershwin
classic are used in the radio and television ads. In fact, about a dozen
different recordings have been used in the TV commercials and 50 to 60 in the
radio ads, says Bill Alenson, director of advertising for United Airlines.
Actually, the entire rhapsody isn't even recorded. A local advertising agency
chooses "a naked track" of the song about 30 seconds long as different
advertising themes and copy warrant it, Alenson says. Studio musicians perform
the music. Although the airline has had many requests, United doesn't have any
plans to record the full piece or to make it available to the general public.
You may wish to check your local library or music store for a recording by
other artists.; No medal winners, yet  Q  Several months ago, I sent a
question to the World Almanac and Book of Facts in New York. I wanted to know
why, if I can find out what horse won the Kentucky Derby for any given year in
the almanac, I couldn't find the names of the Medal of Honor winners. I never
received an answer. It would be so easy to list in the index under the heading
"heroes," right next to "horses." Could you find out for me?;    -- Harry C.
Dyson, Santa Clara; A  Sure. "It's basically an arbitrary editorial decision,"
says Donald Wilson, an editorial assistant with the World Almanac. Wilson says
editors include listings based on reader interest in a given subject. "We get
few requests for the Medal of Honor winners," he says. However, readers are
welcome to write the editor, Mark S. Hoffman, at the World Almanac, 200 Park
Ave., New York, N.Y. 10166, with their suggestions. Because of the large
volume of mail received, editors at the almanac can't individually respond to
every piece of mail -- as you discovered. Editors do pay attention to what
readers want to see, Wilson says, and if enough show interest in the Medal of
Honor winners, who knows?; Glare screens no help on Hwy. 17  Q  Does the state
Department of Transportation plan to install light screens on the divider
strip on Highway 17 between Los Gatos and Santa Cruz? Driving at night there
is extremely difficult because many people drive with their high beams on.
It's particularly bad when you're coming around a curve.;    -- Dwight Denno,
San Jose; A  Sorry. Caltrans has looked into the possibility of installing a
headlight glare screen on top of the concrete median barrier along sections of
Highway 17. But investigations have found that such a screen wouldn't be
worthwhile for three reasons, says Caltrans spokesman Preston W. Kelley. The
additional height of the median would decrease visibility. Because of the
alignment of the highway, such a screen wouldn't help in many cases. And a
glare screen could be both a maintenance and safety problem: Passing trucks
could whip the screen loose.; Reaction: S.J. Rep's response  T  his is
regarding Susan Moran's Sound Off (Action Line, Jan. 22). The actors union,
Actors Equity of America, recently requested that actors be permitted to ask
for donations at the end of performances on behalf of its fight against AIDS
and for its members living with AIDS. This happened in theaters all over
America in response to this critical situation. We have watched thousands of
professional actors, designers, directors and choreographers die from AIDS.
While the Rep did not initiate the post-show plea for help, the Rep would not
deny the actors' request for it, nor has any other theater in America.;    --
Jayne Cravens,; Public Relations Manager; San Jose Repertory Theatre; Update:
Untying the knots  I  n the Jan. 4 column, Action Line invited readers to send
self-addressed stamped envelopes to get a copy of an instructional sheet
showing four ways to tie a necktie. More than 600 readers responded and those
requests have been mailed.  </TEXT>
