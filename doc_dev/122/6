<LEADPARA>  Born the same year as the presidential veto, commercially baked crackers and
the New York Stock Exchange, The Old Farmer's Almanac is celebrating its 200th
anniversary as it observed the last 199.;   Again there is no shortage of odd
tales, recipes and weather forecasts for the coming year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Quaint constancy is the endearing feature of the yellow-bound volume that
evolved from a slim booklet created in 1792 by Robert Thomas, a bookseller,
teacher and amateur astronomer from what is now West Boylston, Mass.;   Both
the original and the 1992 anniversary edition, released Monday, contain
"recipes, articles both current and historical, advice, an odd assortment of
useful and rather useless information, gardening hints and, yes, weather
forecasts," reads the forward in the glossy bookstore edition of the newest
almanac.;   Despite the space given to forecasts, editor Judson Hale said, The
Old Farmer's Almanac's claim of 80 percent accuracy is "a tradition, and we
don't take that seriously at all.";   This year's forecast, Farmers' Almanac
prognosticator Caleb Weatherbee said, calls for moderate temperatures this
winter and more rain than snow. The summer of '92 will be stormy and
turbulent, he said.;   Last year's forecast for New England was well off the
mark, predicting thick snow in the winter and heavy rain from May to July;
neither materialized. It forecast near-drought for August, which actually saw
torrential rains and Hurricane Bob.  </TEXT>
