   After suffering an off-year last
season due to poor snow, Colorado ski resorts are hoping to lure
record numbers of skiers with $30 million in lift and lodge
improvements throughout the state.
   ``The forecast predicts a wet winter this year. Even the
Farmer's Almanac is predicting a snowy year,'' said Kathleen Shaw,
a spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA, the industry's lobbying
group.
   The skiing in Colorado is as varied as the state's geography.
Singles and young couples - the people who can party all night and
ski all day - flock to the glitz of Aspen and Vail, provided they
can afford it.
   Families gravitate to the big resorts, too. Steamboat Springs
has grown to rival the terrain of the better-known resorts. Summit
County - with resorts at Keystone, Arapahoe Basin, Breckenridge and
Copper Mountain - has some good deals with a wide choice of where
to ski.
   Others - particularly westerners who think anything other than a
rope tow is a lift of luxury - tend to prefer the small places, the
best-kept secrets of Colorado skiing provided they can survive the
rigorous economic competition.
   Wolf Creek Pass, in southern Colorado, has snowfalls of 400
inches a year. It's unpretentious and never crowded. Ski Sunlight
near Glenwood Springs, the middle-class answer to the Aspen area's
four resorts, doesn't have the highest vertical by any means, but
it's uncrowded, has varied terrain and its lift tickets come with a
pass to the hot springs pool.
   Small areas have it tough. Monarch, between Gunnison and Salida,
has been through bankruptcy reorganization. Powderhorn, near Grand
Junction, has so many lawsuits from angry creditors, and a water
shut-off by fed-up neighbors, that it may not even open this year,
although current company officials say it will.
   Eldora, near Boulder, is managed now by Vail Associates, as is
Ski Broadmoor in Colorado Springs. Shaw says the small resorts
suffer more from high liability insurance rates, uncertain power
bills and lack of skier awareness outside Colorado, so they have a
tough time competing with the big ones.
   As baby boomers age, so is skiing. Telluride, famous for its
steep, narrow bump runs - including the famed Plunge - is grooming
and widening some of them now.
   Boomers who skied bumps all day when they were in college ski
one steep set of bumps a day, mostly to prove they can still do it.
What they prefer is well-groomed advanced intermediate runs, and a
ski school-day care option for their kids.
   At Purgatory, a previously small resort now coming into its own,
locals buy season passes for $75. Visitors get day care, lunch and
a ski lesson for $38. The top adult lift ticket price is $34.
   Colorado Ski Country says Colorado resorts, because of the
amenities they offer - including sleigh-riding and ice skating -
provide better value for the money than resorts in other states
like Utah or Wyoming.
   Aspen is touchy about its prices. Earlier this year, Aspen Ski
Co. commissioned a study that showed a week of skiing for two,
complete with air fare from Chicago and mid-range lodging, was less
than a skier would pay at Deer Valley resort in Utah. Still, the
tab runs $2,900 for the two-person package in Aspen, food and drink
not included.
   At Breckenridge in Summit County, week-long packages without air
fare start at $300. Purgatory, Crested Butte and others have a wide
range of prices.
   The rising cost of oil is likely to increase air fares this
winter, although Shaw says Colorado Ski Country expects the rising
costs to have little impact this coming season. Most travel
packages have been locked in on contract, she says, so skiers this
season won't suffer from higher air fares ``unless they decide at
the last minute to go skiing.''
   Out-of-state travelers to Colorado ski resorts don't have to
hassle with the winter crush at Stapleton International Airport in
Denver any more. In the last 10 years, airports close to major
resorts have undergone runway and navigation improvements to allow
jet traffic to land.
   Skiers going to Crested Butte, for example, can fly direct and
non-stop every day from Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth, and on
weekends from Atlanta and Houston to Gunnison, only a 30-minute
drive to the resort.
   Hayden, a 20-minute drive from Steamboat Springs, has direct
flights coming from Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix,
Minneapolis, San Jose and Newark.
   Choosing a ski resort involves trade-offs. A fast nightlife and
lots of shopping and restaurants generally mean crowds, too.
Conversely, a smaller area with no crowds means little or no
nightlife and little shopping.
   The time of year is important, too. Christmas in a ski resort is
an experience valued by many. Early snowbirds anxious to hit the
slopes put up with blustery cold and varying snow conditions in
November and early December. January has better snow, but it can
get cold.
   During February, March and early April, the snowpack is deep and
solid, the crowds thin after spring break, and it's warm enough
many days to ski in a T-shirt and jeans.
   Travel agents can obtain information on any of Colorado's 25 ski
resorts - lifts, terrain, prices, lodging, amenities and weather.
