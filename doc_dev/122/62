   ``I fall and it is so hard to get up. I feel, `What is the use?'
There are the drought of the land, emotional upheavals and
spiritual droughts. I feel depression and sometimes despair. It
hurts so much. Getting up is too much work. Now I am reminded how
Jesus rose whenever he fell.''_ Floyd and Martha Hohman,
McCutchenville farmers, from ``The Way of the Cross in Rural Life.''

   When Seneca County farmer William Smith gets
up at dawn, he looks out a window at his rich farm land and wonders
about his family's future.
   In recent years, he's seen a soil-parching drought that withered
crops in the field, and rains that left farm land a muddy mess,
delaying planting and cutting yields.
   He has watched friends lose their farms, and helped comfort
their families while their possessions were sold at auction.
   Through such uncertainty, Smith and his family find strength
through Jesus and ``The Way of the Cross for Those in Rural Life,''
a 32-page religious pamphlet written by farmers and others involved
in agriculture.
   ``We make mistakes and we fall. Jesus fell three times on his
way to the cross and every time he fell he got back up. That's the
way we look at trouble we've having on the farm. You have to pick
yourself back up when you fall,'' the 39-year-old father of two
said in an interview.
   This is the second year the pamphlet has been published by the
Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo's Rural Life Ministries, an
organization that helps farmers and migrant farm workers.
   Sister Christine Pratt, ministries' director, said the booklet
is popular with people engaged in agriculture. It is used in many
rural parishes for devotional services.
   ``It is a spiritual walk with Jesus along the traditional
stations of Jesus' trial, sufferings, death and resurrection, but
includes meditations written by growers, dairy people, and others
who are sensitive to the dependence on the growing cycles of
nature,'' Sister Pratt said.
   The idea of publishing the pamphlet came to her in the summer of
1988 when a drought threatened the livelihoods of many farmers.
   Farm couples or individuals involved in food issues and migrant
farm workers were asked to write their feelings, based on Scripture
involving Jesus' walk to his crucifixion.
   The booklet is popular with farmers because the passages are
written by people who understand the pain they go through, she said.
   ``They are written by our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors,
our friends _ people who have been able to help us see how we can
take the passion of Jesus and identify with it in a way that is
close to our own experience,'' she said.
   ``I have given them to individual farmers, whether they be
Catholic or Protestant. Many of them are in the middle of
foreclosures and I give it to them to pray over, so they know that
someone else is sharing what they're going through,'' she said.
   Smith and his wife, Jane, 37, wrote a passage for the booklet,
based on when Jesus starts on his way to Calvary.
   ``Jesus silently accepted the rough wooden cross, though he had
committed no wrong. Consider the farmer and the farm family who
depend on variables out of their control. The weather,
international trade and government policies have all affected the
farmer,'' the Smiths wrote.
   ``As a result, many farmers or their spouses have been forced to
find work off the farm to supplement their income. In dealing with
this stress, some farmers withdraw from family and friends and face
the loneliness that Jesus must have felt when betrayed by Peter.''
   Mrs. Smith, 37, recalls when she and her husband wrote the
passage.
   ``It was during the drought, when farmers were having so much
trouble through a variety of things. I saw several friends
experience anguish. I sat down and prayed about it, and this is
what I thought of and decided to contribute,'' she said.
   Whenever the Smiths feel depressed about problems on their
800-acre dairy farm, they take solace in the pamphlet.
   ``It's beautiful because of the contributions from so many
people. It helps us pray to the Lord. We can all associate with the
sufferings of Christ,'' she said.
   Farmers in the past decade contended with foreclosures, land
depreciation, inflation, low commodity prices, bad weather and
shrinking markets.
   Agricultural experts say conditions should improve in the 1990s,
but more for commercial farmers than the small part time or family
farmer.
   ``It's rough for many farmers,'' Smith said. ``Some don't think
things will get much better. But you always have to have hope. When
you fall, you have to get up.''
