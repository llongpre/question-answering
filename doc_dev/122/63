   A continued drought this year would push crop
prices to record highs, trigger a new round of food price increases
and magnify loan losses for farm lenders, a government economist
warned Wednesday.
   Mark Drabenstott, assistant vice president and economist at the
Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City, Mo., forecast a bleak outlook
for agriculture if dry weather again plagues the nation's Farm Belt
as it did last year.
   In testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, Drabenstott
said the effect of the drought of 1988 on farmers, agribusiness,
farm lenders and consumers ``was not as great as had been expected.''
   He said, however, that ``much of agriculture's adjustment
capacity was depleted in 1988, and the effects of continued drought
in 1989 would be more severe.''
   The Agriculture Department's chief meteorologist, Norton
Strommen, has said a recurrence of last year's severe drought is
unlikely. Drabenstott agreed.
   With grain stocks down in the United States from low production
last year, Drabenstott said a repeat of last summer's drought would
push crop prices to ``record or near-record levels.''
   ``Many crop producers added to their 1988 income by selling grain
inventories built up in earlier years, an option that will not be
available in 1989,'' Drabenstott said in his written testimony.
   ``Thus, despite the very high grain prices that would accompany
continued drought, smaller crops and depleted inventories would
probably mean smaller farm income.''
   Higher crop prices also would deliver a ``severe blow to the
livestock industry'' by driving up feed costs, Drabenstott said.
Consumers, he added, would feel the effects of lower meat production
for some time.
   Despite his grim economic analysis, Drabenstott said the
possibility of a continued drought ``appears unlikely.''
   ``Agricultural records indicate that every year of drought in the
United States since 1950 has been followed by a year of rebounding
production, and in most cases the increase in production has even
led to re-accumulation of grain stocks,'' said Drabenstott.
   However, there are concerns that lingering dry conditions in
portions of the country, such as in the winter wheat state of
Kansas, could keep some crop production from increasing.
   Indeed, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility,
operated by the Agriculture and Commerce departments, said Wednesday
that, while rain and snow had improved conditions for winter wheat
in some growing areas, the Kansas crop was still in need of snow
cover and moisture.
   As for the drought of 1988, Drabenstott said ``financial
reserves'' from recently good farming years and a $3.9 billion
federal assistance program helped producers minimize the effects of
last year's poor harvests.
   But he suggested that lawmakers could improve agriculture's
ability to adjust to drought by providing farmers more flexibility
to plant different crops. Current government programs, he said,
often make it more attractive to plant crops based on the federal
subsidy outlook rather than market conditions.
