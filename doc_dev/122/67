   Drought-stricken areas of the West bracing for a summer of
rationed water, parched crops and forest fires now face another
plague: hordes of hungry beetles, bees, crickets and grasshoppers
that love hot, dry weather.
   California, in its fourth drought year, just finished a winter
rainy season that yielded only 55 percent of normal precipitation.
Water supplies to central California farmers are being cut in half,
and ``drought cops'' patrol coastal cities, citing scofflaws who
defy lawn-watering bans.
   It's weather only a bark beetle could love.
   The insects are thriving on drought-stressed trees across
California. Last year, they killed trees containing 2 billion board
feet of timber, and state Department of Forestry officials predict
a similar toll this summer.
   ``In drought conditions, the trees don't produce the amount of
pitch they usually do, so when the beetles drill into the trees,
they're more successful at getting in and laying their eggs,'' said
Don Perkins, head of the forestry department's pest management
program.
   The eggs hatch into larvae, which eat the trees from the inside
out, then develop into beetles that fly off and lay more eggs.
   ``They can have three or four life cycles if you have a real
warm, dry spring and warm weather in the fall,'' Perkins said.
   Beetle-killed trees and tinder-dry weather have made
California's fire danger the worst in decades.
   ``We have hundreds of thousands of large kindling stands,'' said
Lisa Boyd, forestry department spokeswoman. ``Things are as dry
right now as we would normally see in August and September.''
   It's not beetles but bees that are annoying Northern California
tourist towns around Lake Tahoe, where swarming yellow jackets last
summer forced people from beaches and back porches.
   Even more bees are expected this summer, prompting the South
Lake Tahoe Chamber of Commerce to declare war. The group is
distributing 5,000 bait traps filled with the insecticide diazinon.
   Populations of the ground-nesting yellow jackets surge if hot,
dry weather occurs in spring when the queen bee is starting her
nest, said Roger Akre, a Washington State University entomologist.
By August, a single queen can hatch out 5,000 workers.
   In northern Nevada, officials are battling Mormon crickets,
which can grow to the size of mice by devouring vegetation, bark,
and virtually anything else in their path.
   ``They're just absolutely voracious,'' said Akre. ``They're
eating-machines.''
   State officials hope to fend off the invasion _ Nevada's largest
since the 1930s _ by spreading poison-laced bran and oil on eggs at
the mouth of canyons. The crickets hatch in the mountains, then hop
down into the valleys to feed.
   East of the Rocky Mountains, winter rains have put a green cast
on much of the Great Plains. But drought persists in North Dakota,
where some farmers have not raised a crop in two years and anxious
citizens hold rain dances and prayer meetings to plead for moisture.
   So far, all they've got are grasshoppers. Lots of grasshoppers.
   In eastern North Dakota, researchers last fall counted 1,700
grasshopper eggs per square yard, compared with a normal count of
200, said Dean McBride, a North Dakota State University
entomologist.
   North Dakota has joined South Dakota and Minnesota, also
infested with grasshoppers, to ask Congress for money to spray
pesticide on the insects' eggs. The grasshoppers can devastate
crops.
   If it's any consolation to residents gone buggy, Akre said, the
drought may eventually limit the populations of insects, which
appreciate rain once they start to feed.
   ``Rain makes the vegetation grow,'' he said. ``Otherwise,
they'll eat themselves out of house and home.''
