<LEADPARA>  California's "March miracle" gave way to an abnormally arid April, making it
nearly certain that this will be the driest winter for the state's most
important watershed since the drought began five years ago.;    On the
Sacramento River system, the water source for many farms in the western San
Joaquin Valley and cities in Southern California, predicted runoff is 8.7
million acre-feet, only 46 percent of the historic average.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That figure is 500,000 acre-feet less than last year's runoff, and 400,000
less than runoff in 1987, driest of the four previous drought years.
Statewide, runoff is now expected to be 45 percent of average, equal to last
year's figure and lower than any of the earlier drought years.;    "By any
definition, this is a low amount of water," said David Hart, engineering
associate for the California Cooperative Snow Survey in the state Department
of Water Resources.;    The dismal forecasts emerged from the department's May
1 survey of snowpacks in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges, sources of the
runoff that fills California's State Water Project and Central Valley
Project.;    One month earlier, snow gaugers were talking about the
"impressive amounts" of snow that had fallen during March, putting an emphatic
end to the five-year drought -- or so it seemed.;    Then came April, bringing
precipitation that measured only 56 percent of average in the Sacramento
basin, 45 percent statewide, and even less in the San Joaquin and Tulare Lake
basins of the southern Sierra.;    Most government agencies that operate the
state's dams and canal systems have already announced water delivery plans for
this summer. Those plans are not likely to be changed as a result of the dry
April weather. However, the diminishing runoff may affect how much water can
be stored in the state's major reservoirs for 1992 use, officials said. As of
May 1, those reservoirs held 65 percent of their average for the date.;   
Runoff forecasts for the San Joaquin and Tulare Lake basins were no better
than the rest of the state, although they are higher than totals recorded in
earlier drought years.;    In the San Joaquin basin, which encompasses the
southern Sierra from the Cosumnes River to the San Joaquin, 1991 runoff is
predicted to be 45 percent of normal. Lowest of the prior drought years was 33
percent in 1987.;    Hart said he has no idea whether the dry April weather
means the drought will continue when next winter begins, but he said the
snow-survey team is assuming the worst.;    "It could go on for 20 years," he
said. "People should consider that."  </TEXT>
