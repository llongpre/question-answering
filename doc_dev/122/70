A THOUSAND ACRES by Jane Smiley Flamingo, Pounds 5.99, 384 pages
JANE SMILEY'S remarkable new novel is a grim and utterly enthralling tale of
the poisonous effect long buried secrets can have when unearthed. Set on an
Iowa farm in the late 1970s, A Thousand Acres tells the story of an ageing
farmer, Larry Cole, who decides to divide his land among his three
daughters. The two eldest, Ginny and Rose, have lived their entire lives on
the farm and are all too willing to take control from the old man, while the
youngest, Caroline, a lawyer who has long since moved away, questions
Larry's judgment. She is summarily disowned by him, beginning a family feud
that ends in a harvest of tragedy.
If the story sounds familiar, that's because it is - Smiley has boldly
adapted King Lear into a work that lives and breathes on its own merits.
Like a Shakespearian tragedy, the story begins slowly, with a carefully
drawn portrait of the stifling customs, tedious work and suppressed passions
of a farming clan. From without, the Coles seem to be the salt of the
Midwestern earth, just what Republicans have in mind when they speak about
'family values'. Ginny, who narrates the tale, appears to be a simple,
honest woman whose willingness to take over control of the farm stems from
the most selfless of motives. Likewise with her amiably caustic sister Rose
and their hardworking husbands.
All is not as it seems in Zebulon County, however. It soon becomes apparent
that both of the sisters' marriages are fraught with violence,
misunderstanding and frustration. Their father is anything but the steady
farmer he seems to be, turning out to be an abusive, drunken tyrant. Given
this, it is hardly surprising that what starts out as an amicable
inheritance soon turns sour, the bitterness coming to a head when, true to
Shakespeare, the daughters effectively turn the crazed old man out into a
violent prairie storm. From that moment the plot kicks into high gear, with
adultery, blindness, incest, attempted murder and accidental death following
hard upon one another in a manner which manages to be both shocking and
utterly natural. What began as an almanac of honest American values ends an
epic catalogue of betrayal and loss.
The immense power of the novel stems not just from its grand scale and
pitched emotions, but also from its simple, relentless style, a voice that
reinforces the book's timeless themes and locations. It is refreshing to
read a writer who is not afraid to use such supposedly old fashioned devices
as foreshadowing to move her story along. She also manages to adhere to her
Shakespearian source in a subtle, unobtrusive way, providing the reader with
sparks of recognition without taking her eye off the plot's flow.
Smiley's strongest skill is a keen authorial balance which, perversely,
keeps us off-balance for most of the book. The reader must continually
reassess his view of characters and events. The attractive Jess, a New Age
draft dodger who becomes the love interest of the elder sisters, turns out
to be somewhat less romantic than first pictured, while Rose's husband Jack
winds up far more complex than first thought. This dark irony reaches right
down into the Iowa soil itself, seemingly fertile ground that has in fact
been poisoned by years of chemical treatment, a legacy which may very well
have caused the cancer that eats away at Rose and prevents Ginny from
bringing a pregnancy to term.
The most telling realignment in the novel comes with Ginny herself, a
confused and bitter woman who starts the story something of a saint yet soon
finds herself driven to attempted murder as she faces the most horrific of
demons. Indeed, it is by telling the story from the point of view of one of
Shakespeare's 'bad' sisters that Smiley is able to add a new perspective to
the Lear myth, showing what it must be like to be the daughter of a tyrant,
to live in a household where 'the unbroken surface of the unsaid' hides a
well of corruption and betrayal.
