   With the government projecting sharp rises in grain production this fall, U.S. agriculture appears to have rebounded from last year's devastating drought, despite pockets of severe crop damage. 

   But the Agriculture Department's first field survey of 1989 crop conditions indicates that the recovery will fall short of expectations for some crops, particularly corn. 
The department forecast a corn harvest of 7.35 billion bushels, a 49% jump from last year's drought-stunted harvest of 4.9 billion bushels, while most market analysts had been more optimistic, pegging 1989 production at 7.5 billion bushels. 

   Department economists predicted a 24% jump in soybean production to 1.91 billion bushels, slightly higher than estimates made by private analysts. 

   On the basis of its Aug. 1 survey, the department projected wheat production at 2.04 billion bushels, up 13% from last year, but down 3% from its July 1 estimate. 
The increase, however, isn't expected to be large enough to allow the U.S. to begin rebuilding its wheat stockpiles. 

   From the standpoint of the futures markets, the department's report was decidedly bullish. 
Analysts foresee an initial flurry of trading on the markets this morning. 

   "I expect all grains to start out higher," said Ted Mao, a grain specialist for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., New York. 
Today "should be a pretty exciting day," said Katherina Zimmer, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst in New York. 
"This report is unequivocally very bullish for wheat. 
We will have the lowest wheat stocks in almost two decades." 

   On the farm-export front, the Agriculture Department had additional encouraging news for the Farm Belt. 
Department analysts lowered their estimate of the 1989 Soviet grain crop by 10 million metric tons to 200 million tons, and raised their estimate of Soviet grain imports by three million metric tons to 36 million tons. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. 

   The changes reflect lower estimates of planted acreage and forecasts of reduced yields in some Soviet grain-growing areas because of dry, hot weather. 

   The department expects the Soviets to import 13 million metric tons of wheat and 22 million metric tons of corn and other coarse grains, as well as one million metric tons of rice and other grains in the marketing year that began July 1. 

   Despite lingering drought in the western Corn Belt, the department expects corn yields to average 112.8 bushels an acre, up 28.2 bushels from last year but 6.6 bushels below the record high of 119.4 bushels in 1987. 
Record yields were foreseen for the Southeast. 

   The department lowered its corn-stocks forecast slightly, because of its lower crop estimate and higher expected use of corn as a feed grain, food ingredient and export item. 
The nation is expected to have a corn stockpile of 1.68 billion bushels on Sept. 1, 1990, down 150 million bushels from the July 1 estimate. 
This means that Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter is likely to reduce the so-called land set-aside requirement for corn farmers next year. 

   Soybean yields were projected at 32.3 bushels an acre, which would be the fourth highest on record. 
But some market analysts expect dry weather this month to trim that figure somewhat. 

   Department analysts expect weaker export demand for soybeans to offset a lower crop estimate, enabling the U.S. to start rebuilding its soybean stockpile. 
They predicted a stockpile of 285 million metric tons by Sept. 1, 1990, up from 155 million tons projected for this Sept. 1. 

   Expansion in spring wheat planting was expected to more than make up for frost and drought damage to the winter-wheat crop, which was planted last fall and harvested early this summer. 
The department forecast durum wheat production at 90.7 million bushels, slightly more than double that of last year, and other spring wheat at 487 million bushels, more than double last year's crop. 
But winter-wheat producers were expected to harvest 1.47 billion bushels, 6% less than last year. 

   Because of strong export demand and domestic consumption, the nation's wheat stockpile is expected to total only 474 million bushels on May 31, 1990, the lowest level since the mid-1970s. 

   Ms. Zimmer, the Merrill Lynch analyst, predicted that the tight wheat supply will drive up wheat futures prices by at least 50 cents a bushel over the next three months, and that next fall, farmers "are going to plant wheat wall to wall."
