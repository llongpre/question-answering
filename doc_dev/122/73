   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the drought
and weather picture:
   _U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng met with 10 Midwestern
governors Thursday in Chicago to discuss the drought. The
farm-state governors warned that the drought is seriously affecting
food production.
   _The National Weather Service's six-to-10-day weather outlook
for the Plains and Midwest extended an earlier forecast for hot,
dry weather.
   _Crews dredged the drought-shrunken Mississippi River around the
clock to free hundreds of backed-up barges.
   _The extremely low levels of the Mississippi are allowing a
wedge of saltwater to push upriver from the Gulf of Mexico. It
could affect marshland wildlife, the seafood industry and cities
that draw drinking water from the river.
   _In St. Louis, the medical examiner's office said that a
99-year-old woman whose body was found in a sweltering bedroom
Wednesday had died from heat.
   _South Dakota fire crews near the Montana line contained a
forest fire that burned about 5,300 acres.
   _Eighteen firefighters were injured in Montana when a blaze that
consumed at least 11,000 acres of woodland flared up again Thursday
night.
   _Crews contained a 10,000-acre blaze in Utah that was believed
to have been sparked by weapons tests by the military.
   _Congressional advocates of income guarantees for America's
drought-plagued farmers predicted it would take weeks to fashion a
bill.
   _The worsening drought outlook has prompted an ``alarming''
number of calls from troubled farm families, say congressmen and
mental health officials.
   _In Alabama, state officials warned that unless water use
declines, shortages will force people to rely on water hauled by
the National Guard.
