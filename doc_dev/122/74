   Two astronomers say they have discovered
evidence that may keep Abraham Lincoln's reputation as ``Honest
Abe'' intact.
   They say Lincoln, as a lawyer before he became president, played
fair 133 years ago when he got a murder suspect off the hook by
discrediting a witness who said he saw the crime by the light of a
bright, three-quarters-full moon.
   Lincoln produced an almanac that indicated the moon was setting
and near the horizon at 11 p.m. on Aug. 29, 1857, when Duff
Armstrong supposedly bludgeoned a man to death after a religious
camp meeting in Illinois. Armstrong was acquitted.
   But townspeople remembered there was indeed a full, bright moon
at the camp meeting that night. Some suspected Lincoln of producing
a phony almanac.
   Now it appears that both Lincoln and the townspeople's memories
were correct, said astronomers Donald Olson and Russell Doescher of
Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos.
   Using computers to recreate the sky above central Illinois on
the night of the murder, the astronomers found that what occurred
was an unusual lunar phenomenon that caused the moon to move
quickly from its highest point in the sky to setting.
   The moon on that night was 74 percent full and near a position
it reaches only once every 18.6 years, in which its arc is at its
lowest in the sky as seen by people in the northern hemisphere.
   The astronomers' calculate that just before 8 p.m., during the
camp meeting, the moon was due south and at its highest point for
the night. But by 11 p.m., the moon was already dropping from view
near the southwestern horizon.
   Coincidentally, there will be a somewhat similar event on this
year's anniversary of the slaying. Olson said the moon will be
about three-quarters full and low in the sky, although not in as
extreme a southern declination as it was the last time the
18.6-year cycle came around, in early 1987.
   Olson said it took about six months of research and combing
through libraries in five states to collect the data needed to
re-create the sky.
   ``This is really fun to blend astronomy with something else,''
he said. ``We've made a small contribution to this episode. The
books (on Lincoln) are a little bit confusing on this.''
   He got the idea to investigate the ``almanac trial'' mystery
when he saw a photograph last year of Norman Rockwell's painting of
Lincoln in court.
   ``Being an astronomer this interested me,'' he said. ``I
thought, what the heck is he doing with that almanac?''
