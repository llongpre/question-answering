   The Agriculture Department predicted a 37% plunge in the nation's corn crop, a 23% drop in soybean production and sharper decreases for spring wheat and other grains in the drought-devastated Farm Belt. 

   The predicted losses signal higher food prices for consumers, potential shortages of some commodities for food processors, and shifts in U.S. agriculture policy, economists and food industry officials said yesterday. 

   In its most comprehensive survey of drought damage, the department forecast a corn harvest of 4.48 billion bushels, down from 7.06 billion last year, and below last month's projection. 
Average corn yields are expected to fall 34% to 78.5 bushels per acre in the sharpest decline on record, eclipsing the 28% drop in 1983, another drought year, said Ewen Wilson, assistant agriculture secretary for economics. 

   Soybean production is expected to fall to 1.47 billion bushels, the lowest since 1976, from 1.91 billion bushels last year. 

   The department forecast a 13% drop in overall wheat production, to 1.82 billion bushels, with a projected 53% drop in spring wheat accounting for most of the decrease. 
The total grain crop was projected at 192 million metric tons, down 31% from last year, while grain supplies, including existing stockpiles, were forecast at 368 million metric tons, down 24%. 

   Mr. Wilson said the department doesn't expect food prices to rise more than 3% to 5% in 1988, as forecast a month ago. 
But food inflation is likely to be greater in 1989 than had been expected because of tighter supplies. 

   The crop report is expected to lift grain and soybean futures prices when trading begins today at the Chicago Board of Trade. 
The department's projections, released after the markets closed yesterday, fell about in the middle of the range expected by grain merchants and private forecasters. 
That should relieve traders who had moved to the sidelines this week to avoid surprises. 

   Some analysts expect heavy buying to push soybean futures prices higher by the permissible daily limit. 
Other are more cautious, noting that on recent Fridays many traders have preferred to even up their positions so as to avoid price drops if unexpected weekend rains come. 

   The crop report, based on field surveys begun Aug. 1, came out after President Reagan, as promised, signed a $3.9 billion disaster-relief measure for the thousands of farmers and ranchers hurt by the worst drought in 50 years. 
The bipartisan bill, enacted in less than a month, is the most generous drought-relief package ever. 

   "This bill isn't as good as rain," Mr. Reagan said at a White House ceremony, "but it will tide you over until normal weather (returns)." 

   Yesterday's projections assume normal rainfall and other weather conditions for the rest of the year. 
But with dry weather forecast for the next few weeks, the predictions may be more optimistic than warranted. 
If drought persists, Mr. Wilson cautioned, "we will see further losses in soybeans." 

   The report indicates that soybeans will be the most important crop in short supply next year. 
When this year's crop is added to a stockpile of 280 million bushels, the U.S. is expected to have 1.75 billion bushels next Sept. 1, the lowest supply in 12 years. 
But the carry-over stockpile for Sept. 1, 1989, is projected at only 100 million bushels. 
"Now that's tight," said Keith Collins, a department economist. 
"That's an unusually low level." 

   Some processors said yesterday that they are about to raise their prices for soybean oil, which is used in everything from salad dressing to newspaper ink, and for soybean meal, a major ingredient in livestock feed. 
The drought already has driven some soybean oil prices 50% higher than last summer. 

   Mr. Wilson said he expects rising prices to discourage soybean use, but others disagreed. 
"I don't think prices have gone high enough yet to ration demand," said Thomas L. Harper, president of Estill, S.C.-based Southern Soya Inc., which supplies poultry producers with meal. 
"They may have to pay higher feed costs to keep those chickens happy." 

   The rise in prices is expected to hurt the U.S. role as a major soybean exporter, cutting exports to 560 million bushels from 785 million last year. 
Processors have already said they will consider importing soybeans if the harvest falls below 1.3 billion bushels. 

   The nation's carry-over corn stockpile is projected to fall to 1.57 billion bushels by Sept. 1, 1989, from 4.35 billion bushels this September. 
But the 1989 level would be enough to meet nearly three months of projected use, Mr. Wilson said. 

   Under the 1985 farm law, the Agriculture Department must reduce the acreage set-aside requirement for corn farmers next year to 12.5% or less, from the current 20%, if the so-called carry-over is projected below two billion bushels. 
The department is also likely to stop paying corn farmers to idle 10% of their crop base. 

   In its report, the department projected a 24% drop in sorghum to 561 million bushels; a 45% drop in barley to 288 million bushels; and a 45% drop in oats to 206 million bushels, the smallest oats crop since the Civil War. 
Winter wheat, which accounts for three-quarters of the U.S. wheat crop and is planted in the fall, is expected to slip only 1% to 1.55 billion bushels, while durum wheat and spring wheat were forecast to plunge 41% and 53%, respectively. 

   The department predicted a 19% rise in rice production this year and a 1% rise in cotton production. 
"Cotton was a shocker," said Mr. Collins, because cotton traders had expected this year's crop to be considerably smaller than the projected 14.9 million bales.
