   Soybean futures rocketed to a four-year high in heavy trading amid evidence that some small investors -- disenchanted with the stock market -- are starting to jump into commodity speculation. 

   Fears of possible drought damage to the young U.S. crop, coupled with rising talk of inflation, drove soybean prices as much as 30 cents a bushel higher, the permissible daily limit on the Chicago Board of Trade. 

   It's far too early to tell whether the current dry spell in parts of the Farm Belt will damage the $15 billion U.S. soybean crop, which has barely been planted. 
Nevertheless, yesterday's rally -- the most significant since the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear-plant disaster sent tainted-food fears through world markets -- fed budding inflation fears, economists said. 

   "This is all very ominous for inflation," said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago. 
"Food had been a major restraint" on overall inflation in the past few years, he noted. 
If the farm-commodity rally continues, he said, supermarket prices for some items could rise in the second half of the year. 

   Similar drought fears inspired a rally in corn, wheat and cotton futures as weekend rains failed to materialize as forecast. 

   The buying rush in commodities cast a shadow on other markets, helping depress bond prices and turning such key inflation indicators as the Commodity Research Bureau's futures index significantly higher. 
The index peaked at 243.27 -- its highest level since April 1985 -- before ending at 241.89, up 2.92 points. 

   Brokers cited growing evidence that some small investors, wary of inflation and disenchanted with the mostly dull activity in the stock market since last October's crash, are turning to commodity futures as an alternative. 

   "I'm getting people who haven't been in beans for several years," Randy Hinderaker, a retail broker for R.G. Dickinson &amp; Co., a Des Moines, Iowa full-service brokerage concern, said. 

   The Chicago Board of Trade lifted its margin requirements in soybean and grain futures as a result of yesterday's heavy activity. 
The exchange estimated soybean volume at a brisk 350 million bushels, up about 24% from Friday. 

   Weather normally doesn't drive the grain and soybean futures markets until later in the summer, when rainfall largely determines a crop's ability to yield the seed that is harvested. 
This spring, however, federal farm policy is draining the nation's stockpiles just as unusually dry soil conditions are generating speculation that the recently planted crop doesn't have enough moisture to sprout properly. 

   Before weather worries hit, Steve Freed, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago, had expected nearby soybean futures contracts to rise to $8 a bushel in the next 30 days. 
Yesterday's rally alone, however, drove soybeans for September delivery 30 cents higher to $7.66 a bushel. 
With dry weather looming, "this is uncharted ground," he said. 

   Weather forecasters, such as Peter Leavitt of Weather Services Corp., Bedford, Mass., see little chance for significant rain this week for the corn-growing and soybean-growing regions west of the Mississippi River, where rainfall so far this spring is half of average levels. 
So far this year, Iowa has had the least rainfall since 1958. 

   If rains don't fall soon in the Midwest, farmers may begin to horde their 1987 crop in anticipation of even higher prices. 
Some Iowa elevators already are having difficulty buying soybeans. 
"Everyone who has beans is holding on," said John Murrell, manager of a Bloomfield, Iowa elevator. 
"We're not hardly buying." 

   Normally, rising prices would lead farmers to plant more soybeans. 
But government programs forged in the wake of the farm crisis restrict farmers. 
Grain analyst Bernard Drury of World Perspectives Inc., Washington, estimates soybean farmers will only plant 3% more acres than the 57.4 million acres planted in 1987.
