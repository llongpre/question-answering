   Rep. Edward Madigan of Illinois is known as a
behind-the-scenes operator with a quiet, non-confrontational
approach to accomplishing Republican purposes in the House of
Representatives.
   But his colleagues opted today for another approach, choosing the
brash and outspoken Newt Gingrich of Georgia for the post of House
minority whip.
   Although Madigan doesn't run to the television cameras to condemn
the Democrats at every turn, don't tell him he's not a partisan.
   ``I am damned mad about these suggestions that somebody else
might be more of a Republican than I am,'' he said, and he can
recite party-building credentials spanning two decades. He is, he
says, ``someone who knows how Republicans can become a majority in
the Congress'' even if he's not loud about it.
   His approach to the Democrats isn't to shoot at them, as Gingrich
does, but to set an example of how governing should be done.
   ``They are playing different games,'' said the authors of the
Almanac of American Politics in their 1988 profile of Madigan.
``Newt Gingrich and company want to change opinion in the country,
confident that Congress will come to reflect it; Madigan wants to
change policy in the House, confident that he can improve the way
government serves the people.''
   Madigan ``is the antithesis of the confrontationists of the
Conservative Opportunity Society,'' the group Gingrich leads, said
the almanac.
   While Gingrich puts down Madigan as the choice of Republicans who
want to stay in the minority, Madigan says little about his
opponent. ``I think the Republican party has an excellent choice,''
he said.
   He also turned away speculation that his race for whip was a
prelude to succeeding Bob Michel, R-Ill., as House minority leader.
   ``I'm not a candidate for leader,'' he said. ``I have no ambition
to be leader. I think it's a lousy job.'' Clearly, the back-room
work of the whip, who counts votes and enforces the party positions
on legislation, appeals to his private personality.
   ``I don't want to go to all those damned banquets,'' he said of
the leader's job.
   Madigan, 53, turned from running a taxi business to politics in
1966 when he was elected to the Illinois state legislature. After
chairing the redistricting committee, he was elected to Congress in
1972.
   Through a series of good committee positions, he soon became a
significant force within the House and has paid his dues to the
party.
   He was off the House Agriculture Committee in 1981 and 1982, but
reclaimed his seat instead of pursuing other goals in 1983 as
ranking Republican at the behest of party leadership in order to
prevent Vermont's liberal Republican James Jeffords from getting the
position.
   Madigan, who represents a prosperous farming area, has been an
opponent of farm bill provisions that he considers over-generous and
led the fight against a Democratic proposal for a farmers'
referendum to limit grain production.
   He also serves on the Energy and Commerce Committee which has
been an important forum for economic issues and under the leadership
of chairman John Dingell, D-Mich., is considered the most powerful
committee in the House.
   A specialist on transportation, Madigan advocated sale of the
Conrail freight train system. With interests in health and clean
air, he has pushed for organ transplant legislation and opposed acid
rain bills.
   He's known for having a good sense of humor, but avoids
glad-handing, and is appreciated as a straight-shooter who maintains
orderly, working relationships with Democrats.
