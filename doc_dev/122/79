   Farmers have aged so much in the tough times
of the 1980s that a former Agriculture Department economist says
retirements could force another round of farm consolidations by the
turn of the century.
   Matthew G. Smith, now with the Minnesota Department of Revenue,
says the graying of American farmers was a prominent issue in the
1950s and 1960s. But a boom in exports and farm incomes attracted
more young people in the middle and late 1970s and for a while the
face of agriculture got a bit younger.
   Now, however, ``nearly half of all farm assets are owned by
farmers who will probably retire within 10 years, yet fewer than
one in three younger operators is in a strong position to purchase
those assets,'' Smith said.
   ``With the number of new farmers again declining, with many
middle-aged farmers in financial difficulty, and with a steady rate
of retirement of older farmers, the total number of U.S. farms may
drop rapidly between now and the year 2000.''
   Smith reported his analysis in RDP, or Rural Development
Perspectives, a magazine published by the department's Economic
Research Service, where he formerly worked.
   ``If these trends continued unchecked, the share of farmland
owned by absentee landlords may rise, growth in farm efficiency may
slow, and businesses serving the farm sector will find themselves
competing for slices of a shrinking pie,'' he said.
   The net number of new farmers younger than 35 in 1974 averaged
almost 29,000 a year from 1974 to 1978, he said. From 1978 to 1982,
those who were under 35 in 1978 dropped by nearly 40 percent to
fewer than 18,000 a year.
   A middle group, 35 to 54 years, which grew from 1974 to 1978,
shrank in 1978-82. Thus, in this age group, which normally includes
farmers both entering and leaving farming, more were leaving than
entering by the early 1980s.
   ``Meanwhile rates of net departures among older operators (55
and older) were relatively stable, reflecting the fairly
predictable process of retirement,'' Smith said.
   Looking at the changes in the number of ``commercial-size''
farms, defined in the study as one with annual sales of $20,000 at
1982 prices, Smith said that these units increased from 865,000 in
1974 to about 942,000 in 1978, then declined to about 884,000 in
1982.
   Smith said that if the entry and exit rates remain at the
1978-82 levels, the number of commercial-size farms would decline
18 percent to about 727,000 units by 1998.
   But he said the rates won't be known for certain until next year
when the 1987 census of agriculture becomes available.
   ``Prospects appear dim that a sufficient number of young people
will begin farming to reverse the trend toward fewer
commercial-size farms,'' Smith said. ``With the farm baby boom
approaching 30, the numbers of farm-born youths at the prime entry
ages will now begin to decline.''
   Consequently, he said, the number of new farmers will continue
to drop, unless more farm children choose to remain on the land, or
more people from non-farm backgrounds take up farming.

   The Agriculture Department says drought
continues to put the bite on consumer food dollars, including
higher prices for fresh vegetables this summer and signs that
processed items also will be more costly next year.
   Prices paid to growers for fresh vegetables jumped more than 21
percent from July to August, officials said. And this summer's
prices, overall, could be up 10 percent from the third quarter of
1987, a period when fresh vegetable prices usually decline.
   ``However, this year's extremely dry weather, coupled with
minimum irrigation in the North Central states, reduced supplies
and put upward pressure on prices in midsummer,'' the department
Economic Research Service said Wednesday. ``As local supplies
tighten, consumers likely will be more dependent than usual on
vegetables shipped from more distant areas.''
   The government's Consumer Price Index, or CPI, for fresh
vegetables, including potatoes, rose 4 percent from June to July
and was up 5 percent from July 1987. Potatoes, lettuce and tomatoes
are the most important in the fresh vegetable index.
   Retail potato prices were up seasonally in July and were also
boosted slightly by the drought's impact on the summer crop.
   ``Lettuce prices tend to be seasonally low in July, and were
slightly lower this July due to large California supplies,'' the
report said. ``Tomato prices tend to be down in July, as tomatoes
are the most commonly grown vegetable in home gardens, which
reduces summer demand. However, the drought boosted this July's
prices.''
   The CPI for processing vegetables is generally flat in the
summer, but it rose 1 percent in July, the report said. Prices are
expected to continue rising through 1989 as higher wholesale costs
work through the marketing pipeline.

   Saudi Arabia has decided to cut spending on
domestic production subsidies for the 1989 wheat crop in an effort
to reduce the need for export subsidies, says an Agriculture
Department report.
   ``However, at this point the subsidy reduction will affect only
large farms, which account for about 10 percent of total Saudi
wheat production,'' the department's Foreign Agricultural Service
reported Wednesday.
   The government of Saudi Arabia has been subsidizing exports of
domestic wheat surpluses since 1985-86. As a result, Saudi wheat
has competed against U.S. wheat in China, Indonesia and South
Korea, the report said.
   In addition to the wheat subsidy reduction, the Saudi government
will attempt to reduce the country's reliance on barley imports by
requiring large-scale wheat producers to plant as much barley as
they do wheat.
