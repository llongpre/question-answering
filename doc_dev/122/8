   Not one to tamper lightly with tradition,
the Farmers' Almanac suggests nonetheless that the date designated
for Thanksgiving is a turkey.
   In its 1991 edition, just off the presses, the venerable
publication says Americans should consider celebrating the holiday,
the fourth Thursday in November, earlier in the fall.
   An earlier date would rid Thanksgiving of pre-Christmas
overtones, allow for more favorable travel weather and line it up
more closely with the harvest whose bounty it is meant to
celebrate, the almanac says.
   The almanac says the second Monday in October, the date on which
Canada celebrates Thanksgiving, might be an appropriate
alternative. Almanac editor Ray Geiger invites readers to offer
their own ideas.
   ``We're only suggesting that we examine this thing. We're not
bold enough to say `do it!''' Geiger said in an interview.
   Thanksgiving, commemorating the feast held by members of the
Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts in December 1621 to celebrate that
year's harvest, has been observed at various dates over the years.
It has remained at its current date since 1863, except for a brief
period when President Franklin D. Roosevelt reset it for the third
Thursday in November.
   ``Thanksgiving is a sacred holiday. What makes it sacrosanct is
not that it is observed on a certain date each year, but rather
what it means,'' the almanac says. ``When one ponders the real
reason for Thanksgiving, the date of celebration seems immaterial.''
   Geiger said the principal reason for change would be to separate
Thanksgiving from the overlapping demands posed by the start of the
Christmas season.
   ``You've got football, you've got Christmas pressing and you
don't know whether you're celebrating Thanksgiving or Christmas,''
he said.
   An earlier holiday would reduce the chances that travelers would
encounter ice or snow while heading to family gatherings, Geiger
said. And it would shift the holiday to a time closer to the end of
the harvest, when the woods still are ablaze with colorful foliage,
he said.
   By contrast, fields and orchards are bare in late November and
trees have lost their leaves. ``When we celebrate Thanksgiving
under these conditions, we seem to have lost our sense of timing,''
the almanac said.
   The date change could mark the start of a new crusade by the
174-year-old almanac, which in years past has prodded the
government to restore city names to postmarks and eliminate the
nine-digit ZIP code.
   Geiger's almanac is not to be confused with the Old Farmers
Almanac, the 198-year-old New Hampshire-based publication. Geiger
claims a circulation of about 5 million for the 48-page
publication, sold to banks, insurance companies and other
businesses that distribute it to customers as a promotional tool.
   Last year's campaign promoting the introduction of a coin it
calls the Columbus Dollar as a replacement for the $1 bill is
making progress, Geiger said, and bills introduced in the House and
Senate are enjoying increased support.
   That proposal, along with the shuffling of Thanksgiving, does
not mean that the almanac is abandoning its longstanding profession
of traditional values.
   ``Tradition is a must for us, but we're not blinded by it,''
Geiger said.
   Almanac traditions include calendar data, puzzles, household
hints, inspirational messages, one-line jokes and ``flavorite
recipes.''
   Another tradition is weather data. This year's edition predicts
a harsh winter _ chilling news to households concerned about rising
energy prices brought on by the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   ``It's going to be a rough winter, rougher than last year, with
more snow and more cold weather in January and February,'' Geiger
said.
   ``But it's not going to be a prolonged winter. It's going to
ease off early in March,'' Geiger said. The almanac forecasts a
mild spring and summer that won't be too hot.
   The forecasts are prepared by Caleb Weatherbee, who calculates
them in accordance with a secret formula based on sunspots, the
position of the planets and the tidal action of the moon, Geiger
said.
   ``His track record has been excellent, getting better every
year.''
