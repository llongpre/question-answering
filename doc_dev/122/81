   Western Canada's livestock and crop production are being threatened by a drought that has also hit neighboring western U.S. states. 

   Large areas of Saskatchewan and Alberta have reported scorched pastures, dried-up lakes and drifting soil. 
Hay and winter wheat crops have wilted. 
Some communities have been hit by dust storms. 

   A federal weather office said Friday that there wasn't any relief in sight. 
The office said some scattered showers could occur in the next 10 days, but an official said the ground is so dry even an inch of rain "would do next to nothing." 

   Much of south and western Saskatchewan and southern Alberta have had less than a tenth of an inch of rain in the past five weeks. 

   The provincial governments of Alberta and Saskatchewan have offered a total of 28.5 million Canadian dollars ($23.2 million) to assist in well drilling, water pumping and other relief activities. 

   Old Wives Lake, a 70,000-acre southern Saskatchewan lake that is a major staging area for migrating ducks, is one of several lakes that have dried up. 
Saskatchewan breeds about a quarter of North America's ducks. 
Tim Thiele, a Saskatchewan area manager for Ducks Unlimited, a conservation group, said thousands of small ponds where ducks nest and breed have evaporated. 

   Some livestock farmers are moving their animals to feed lots and areas with water supplies. 
Jim Graham, a southern Alberta farmer, said his cattle would usually be on pasture at this time of year. 
But he said the land is too scorched for grazing. 
He is feeding the animals silage at a feed lot. 
The next step will be to put them out to graze on crops, he said. 

   Seeding is behind schedule for Canada's main grain crops, which are harvested in the fall. 
In Alberta, 16% of the seeding had been done late last week, down from 37% a year earlier. 
Some early-seeded crops that are starting to germinate won't survive because the soil is so dry, said David MacIntyre, a crop analyst with the Alberta Wheat Pool, a farmers' cooperative. 

   Canadian farmers had been planning a big increase in oilseed acreage this year, switching out of wheat to benefit from the comparatively high oilseed prices. 
But now many farmers are expected to move back to wheat because it requires less moisture than canola, a shallowly seeded plant that is Canada's main oilseed. 

   Eugene Bendig, executive director of the Saskatchewan Canola Growers, forecast canola acreage would total about 7.5 million acres, down from the 8.3 million acres predicted in March by Statistics Canada, a federal government agency. 
He said it would take ideal growing conditions for farmers to seed 8.3 million acres of canola. 

   The drought comes at a time when market prospects for grain farmers have been improving. 
Most grain prices have been picking up, inventories have been dropping and export sales have been strong. 

   The Canadian Wheat Board, a government agency that markets Canadian wheat, barley and oats, said export sales of wheat may reach a record in the current crop year ending July 31, providing the board can get supplies from farmers. 
So far this crop year, China has bought a record 4.4 million metric tons of Canadian wheat. 
The current export record for wheat sales to all countries is 21.8 million metric tons for the year ended July 31, 1984. 
A metric ton of wheat equals 36.74 bushels. 

   Some parts of the Prairie provinces including northern Alberta, eastern Saskatchewan and northern Manitoba have had substantial rainfall and farmers in the drought areas say a couple of inches of rain in the next two weeks would transform their 1988 outlook. 
The neighboring states of North and South Dakota and Montana have also been hard hit by the drought.
