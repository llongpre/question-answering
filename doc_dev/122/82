   President Reagan signed a $3.9-billion
drought-relief package today, telling farmers it ``isn't as good as
rain, but it will tide you over'' until normal weather returns.
   At a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden, Reagan said,
``This bill expresses a distinctive American tradition _ that of
lending a helping hand when misfortune strikes.''
   He said the measure was a product of bipartisanship, as members
of both parties in Congress saw that ``the need to help our farmers
rose far above any partisan politics.''
   ``This legislation is helpful and generous, but at the same time
it is not a budget buster,'' the president said.
   ``To ensure the continued success of this important bill, we
must stick to the principles I have outlined, targeting assistance
to the truly needy and emphasizing sound business decisions,'' he
said.
   Addressing the nation's farmers directly, the president said,
``This bill isn't as good as rain, but it will tide you over until
normal weather and your own skills permit you to return to your
accustomed role of being the most productive farmers in the world.''
   The measure provides aid for farmers suffering crop losses of
more than 35 percent of their expected harvest because of the
drought or other calamities such as hail, insect damage or
excessive rain. The payments would be equal to 65 per cent of the
lost income.
   Farmers whose crop losses exceeded 75 per cent of the expected
yield would receive payments equal to 90 per cent of lost income.
   ``It's a good buffer, and it's probably enough to get most
people over the hump this year,'' said Keith Salter, who figures he
will get $12,000 because the drought baked all 420 acres of wheat,
barley and oats on his farm near Menoken, N.D.
   ``It won't be like a crop, but it's better than nothing,'' said
the 53-year-old farmer.
   The White House said Reagan would sign the bill in the White
House Rose Garden today. His signature already had been assured.
   Farm organization leaders said the bill _ the most expensive
disaster relief measure ever enacted for agriculture _ won't be
enough to keep all financially squeezed farmers in business.
   ``If a farmer has been struggling these past few years ... this
will not allow him income to pay down debt and interest,'' said
John Leininger, spokesman for the 33,000-member North Dakota
Farmers Union. ``We are definitely going to see some farmers leave,
I am sure.''
   According to the Farmers Union, a farmer with an average wheat
yield of 30 bushels an acre who harvested nothing this year should
receive at least $42 an acre in disaster aid. The payment would go
up to about $92 an acre if the farmer had federal crop insurance.
   The same farmer harvesting a normal crop would earn about $114
per acre, based on market prices this spring, Leininger said.
   Money for the payments is expected to come from savings that the
government will realize as a result of the drought, since
income-support payments are based in part on how much individual
farmers produce. With crops down because of the drought, the amount
the government-owned Commodity Credit Corp. must put out in such
payments is also down.
   Under the bill, farmers will not have to repay such payments
that they have received already if their payment amount is lowered
because of production losses resulting from the drought. They may
not, however, retain such payments for lost crops and still receive
disaster aid money for the same crops.
   Farmers will have to purchase federal crop insurance for 1989 to
be eligible for disaster payments.
   Livestock owners who have to buy feed because of the drought,
instead of growing it as usual, also would receive assistance.
   The bill places a limit of $100,000 on payments to any one
farmer. It prohibits payments to any producer whose ``qualifying
gross revenues,'' as set by a congressional formula, exceed $2
million.
   Many reports by private forecasters and commodity specialists
indicate a reduction of about 40 percent in this fall's corn
production from last year's 7.06 billion bushels and a 20 percent
to 25 percent decline in soybeans from the 1987 harvest of 1.91
billion bushels.
   The wheat crop also has been reduced, but not as greatly because
most of the wheat came from the winter crop, which was planted last
fall and harvested before the full impact of the drought was felt.
