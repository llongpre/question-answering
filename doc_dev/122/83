   Private economists are raising their predictions of food-price inflation for the second time in three weeks amid mounting evidence of serious drought damage to U.S. crops. 

   Inflation worries drove soybean and wheat futures prices higher yesterday on the Chicago Board of Trade, while corn fell in volatile trading. 
Farm-commodity prices are expected to rise today following a National Weather Service forecast yesterday of more abnormally hot, dry weather in much of the Midwest. 
Earlier this week, the National Weather Service had seen a better chance of rain. 

   Yesterday's surge in soybean and wheat quotes hurt bond prices and sent them skidding. 
And investors' concerns about food-price inflation drove down stocks, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average sliding 28.45 points, to 2130.16. 
Sugar futures, meantime, soared to their highest level in six years. 

   Based on the irreparable damage already done to such major crops as corn, soybeans and wheat, several economists are raising their food-inflation forecasts. 
Georgia State University's economic forecasting center is boosting its forecast of 1989 food inflation to 7% from the 6% rate it projected in mid-June. 
Before the three-month-old drought, many economists had expected food prices to rise roughly 4% this year and in 1989. 

   Ray Daniel, senior vice president of WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., economic consulting concern, also lifted his 1989 food-inflation forecast yesterday to about 7% from the 5%-to-6% rate he forecast last month. 

   A 7% rise in prices would be the highest since food inflation, as measured by the government's consumer price index, jumped 7.8% in 1981. 
Since 1982, food prices have risen only 2% to 4% a year. 

   Food costs make up about one-seventh of household budgets in the U.S. 
As a result, some economists are also raising their estimates of overall inflation in 1989 to about 5.5% from the 5% rate projected just last month. 

   In mid-June, economists began raising their forecasts of 1989 food-price inflation to about 6% from 4% amid the first evidence of irreversible crop damage. 

   Now, crop damage is escalating so rapidly that a third wave of new, reduced estimates of the harvests could come in a matter of weeks. 
Several big farm states, which are widely thought to have already lost roughly one-fifth of their potential corn production, would likely see their harvests halved if the hot and dry weather continues into mid-July, as expected, government and industry analysts and economists said yesterday. 

   "If it comes about, it would be a disaster," said Harry Hillaker, Iowa's acting climatologist. 
"We're talking about 50% yield reductions" in the corn crop. 

   Weather is critical to the corn harvest now because much of the crop is beginning to pollinate, a process that determines the number of kernels on each ear. 
Potential yields have already fallen because the hot and dry weather prevented the full development of the ears. 

   Mr. Daniel said the drought so far has caused as much damage to major crops as the drought of 1983. 
That dry spell, which began much later in the season, ultimately reduced the corn crop about 30% and the soybean harvest 20%. 

   Meanwhile, the Agriculture Department issued an updated report that shows the drought's impact on major crops. 
The corn crop is rated as poor or very poor in Missouri (73% of the crop), Kentucky (68%), Indiana (65%) and Ohio (49%). 
The spring wheat crop is rated as poor or very poor in North Dakota (77%), Montana (69%) and Minnesota (66%). 

   Soybeans are faring better generally in the Midwest than in Mississippi, where 80% of the bean crop is rated poor or very poor, or in Tennessee (62%), Alabama (61%) and Kentucky (58%), according to the report. 
Sixty-five percent of Mississippi's cotton crop is rated as poor or very poor, the worst rating of any cotton-producing state. 

   With several weeks left in the growing season, speculation is growing that the drought could cause the biggest percentage drop in production in some states since the Dust Bowl years. 

   Economists aren't sure how much more food prices will rise if drought damage does escalate. 
On the supply side of the equation, prices could jump if farmers fear shortages next year and hoard whatever crops they have in storage. 
But demand from overseas for U.S. crops is already showing signs of weakening, which could help check rapid price increases. 

   Whatever the case, most of the impact from the drought won't occur until next year, when the fall harvests enter the food pipeline. 

   However, forecasts for higher prices appear to have become a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
A major Midwest supermarket chain said yesterday that some food manufacturers are already boosting prices. 
As a result, its cost of buying grocery items is about 3% higher than last summer, instead of the 2% rise it had projected earlier this year.
