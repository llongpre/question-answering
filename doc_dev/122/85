<LEADPARA>  SOME weather myths -- sometimes used by gardeners to clock their plantings --
may have been true, at least once, but some might now be considered
"myth-takes.";    "If we wait long enough, sometime and somewhere the folklore
may be true again," says Mark Wysocki, a Cornell University meteorologist who
collects predictive sayings and is challenging amateur observers to test
folklore.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     For example, take St. Swithin's Day, July 15. If it rains on that day,
according to folklore, it will rain for 39 more days. That belief, says
Wysocki, dates back to a particularly rainy spell when the body of the Bishop
of Winchester, as St. Swithin had been previously known, was reburied 100
years after his death in 862.;    "Clearly, we don't get 40 days of rain every
time it pours on July 15, Wysocki said. "But it could happen.";    Of other
folklore, Wysocki notes:;    "When squirrels hoard a large store of nuts, the
winter will be a hard one. That one will be tough to test. More nuts compared
to what? You would have to follow a squirrel around for several years.";   
Myth says that a ring around the moon foretells rain.;    "There's a better
than 50-50 chance that is true," says Wysocki, "but you would need more
information, such as wind direction. A halo around the moon or sun is produced
when crystals in high, thin cirrus clouds refract (bend) the light. Cirrus
clouds are usually forerunners, by several hundred miles, of a cold front and
a weather disturbance.";    When hair becomes limp, rain is near. "Hair is an
excellent indicator of humidity. It becomes longer and thicker as air moisture
increases.";    When leaves show their undersides, be sure that rain betides.
"Leaves of some kinds of trees will flip in the wind; that could mean rain is
on the way. Or it could just be a windy day.";    Wet June, dry September.
"That didn't work in 1990, did it?";    Then, there's the woolly bear legend
that the wider the fall band of brown "fur" on this caterpillar, the milder
the winter.;    Wysocki noted that a woolly bear he captured in his Freeville,
N.Y., yard had a broad middle band of brown and a narrower head and tail of
black, while another was a muddled mix of brown blending into black, a sort of
calico caterpillar.;    "It is difficult to know what affects something like
the varying color of an insect," he said. "It could be genetics. It could be
nutrients in the food. Or it could be something more. We like to think that
insects and other animals are in touch with the natural world.";    Wysocki
puts the traditional beliefs into categories: predictions associated with key
dates, such as saints' days; insect and animal behavior; and wind and cloud
observations.;    "There is a higher degree of validity to some of the wind-
and cloud-based predictions," he said. "But you still have to be a good
observer and consider all other available information. Farmers and mariners
were sources of much wind and cloud folklore. Farmers had to be able to
predict the weather for planting and harvesting, and sailors had to be good
observers to avoid storms.";    Wysocki, co-editor of Cornell's 1991 Weather
Calendar, asks observers to report on weather folklore.;    Cornell
meteorologists hope that people, by conducting their own experiments, will
learn more about observing the many factors involved in weather changes.; IF
