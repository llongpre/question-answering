   Rain, ``blessed rain,'' fell across parched fields of Nebraska
and postponed a hay exposition in Iowa on Wednesday, but
meteorologists said it was no drought-breaker.
   The drought that has for weeks dried most of the nation's
midsection and some of the Southeast has affected more than just
crops. Animals are being forced from the woods to populated areas
in search of food and water.
   Vice President George Bush visited a livestock auction in
Marion, Wis., and Michael Dukakis went to Iowa on Wednesday, as the
head of a non-profit farmers' organization accused politicians and
the news media of taking advantage of the trouble.
   ``We do want to help,'' Bush told about 200 people at the
auction during a recess in bidding. ``I dont want to
over-promise.'' Dukakis, the Democratic nominee-to-be, got a
firsthand look at a relatively healthy corn field but stressed
``the importance of pulling together'' to help farmers.
   The National Weather Service Long Range Predictions Group
released a 30-day forecast Wednesday that called for below-normal
rainfall during July for Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Kentucky and most of California.
   But above-normal rainfall was predicted for some drought-plagued
areas, including Montana, Wyoming, southern South Dakota, Nebraska,
Kansas, New Mexico and western portions of Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma
and Texas.
   ``We went out and sat in it,'' said Wendy Hooyboer, a farmer in
Fort Calhoun, Neb., which got an inch and a half of rain overnight.
``When you're looking at your corn curling, that's what you want to
do. It's a nice, slow, blessed rain.''
   In Waterloo, Iowa, the third annual Farm Progress Hay Expo, a
show of farm equipment and techniques, was postponed a day to
Thursday after three-quarters of an inch of rain fell in the area.
   ``You can't bale the hay when it gets too wet and too heavy. And
it won't keep, it will spoil,'' said Frank Holdmeyer, managing
editor of Wallaces Farmer magazine, sponsor of the event.
   ``I think most everybody is grateful for the rain and aren't too
concerned about the hay expo,'' Holdmeyer said. ``It'd be kind of
nice to have the rain tomorrow, too, even if it means canceling the
expo.''
   ``This isn't a drought-breaker, but the most hopeful development
for rain this month,'' weather service meteorologist John Pollack
said of Nebraska's rainfall, which brought up to 3 inches of rain
to eastern parts of the state.
   While the storms rolled in much-needed moisture to Oklahoma,
forecaster Ken Huckabee said some areas may get no relief at all
because of the hit-or-miss pattern of the weather system.
   ``We had people who lived here in Norman got less than a half
inch of rain, whereas the northern half of Oklahoma City had over 4
inches reported,'' said Huckabee.
   ``We're still facing our hottest month of the year _ July,''
cautioned meterologist Ted Stimach in Madison, Wis., where farmers
who hadn't seen rain for eight weeks rejoiced when more than an
inch of rain fell.
   Animals are feeling drought, too.
   Turtles at a University of Michigan reserve near Pickney are
having trouble nesting in the baked earth.
   ``If we don't get some rain in the next two or three weeks,
we're not going to have any baby turtles this year,'' said Justin
Congdon, who for 14 years has studied the 6,000 painted, snapping
and Blanding's turtles that live on the 1,400-acre Edwin S. George
Reserve.
   Kentucky farmers have found their crops invaded by deer who have
been forced from the woods in search of food and water.
   ``They head for soybeans, which they prefer over corn. But if
soybeans aren't available, they'll settle for corn,'' said John
Phillips, a deer specialist with the Kentucky Division of Wildlife.
``None of them are starving but they are running out of natural
vegetation.''
   Cattlemen in southeast North Dakota have moved their herds to
greener pastures in northwest Minnesota to escape the drought.
   ``I don't know what the weight gains will be, but we're hoping
to keep them alive at least,'' said McLeod rancher Larry Woodbury,
president of the Sheyenne Valley Grazing Association, who said he
had moved more than half of his 240 cattle.
   In other developments:
   _The president of the American Farm Bureau accused the media and
politicians of exaggerating the severity of the drought.
   ``The national media never met a disaster they didn't like, and
they're playing it for all it's worth,'' Dean Kleckner said Tuesday
at a news conference at Colorado State University. Politicians are
hoping to take advantage of the drought crisis in an election year,
he claimed.
   _The Agriculture Department said prices paid to farmers for
grain and other raw products rose 3.7 percent in June as drought
and searing heat reduced 1988 harvest prospects over much of the
nation.
   _Trucks were expected to arrive late Wednesday in Charlotte
Court House, Va., to be loaded with hay to send to drought-stricken
farmers in Akron, Ohio. Charlotte County farmers planned to truck
2,000 bales of hay to farmers who had sent hay to Virginia two
years ago. The trucks were expected to leave Friday and arrive in
Ohio's Mercer County on Saturday.
