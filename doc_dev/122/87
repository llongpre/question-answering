   Hay from Southern farmers hoping to repay a debt from their own
1986 dry spell arrived in drought-stricken Indiana, while Alabama's
governor asked federal officials to declare his state a disaster
area due to crop damage.
   Also Friday, an economist estimated the drought could cause $3
billion in damage to North Dakota's economy this year.
   At Cloverdale, Ind., farmer Ed Meek accepted 180 bales of hay
donated by South Carolina farmers and trucked in Friday by
volunteer off-duty Charleston, S.C., police.
   ``Our hay yield is down and what we're using now is what should
be used next winter,'' he said.
   In 1986, Indiana and 40 other states sent about 800,000 bales of
hay to South Carolina when the Southeast was suffering a severe dry
spell.
   At Charlotte Court House, Va., which was spared by the drought,
farmers gathered a shipment of hay Friday to send to Ohio.
   ``Two years ago, I helped load a lot of hay in Ohio that went
South,'' said Ohio's director of agriculture, Steve Maurer,
thanking the Charlotte County farmers. ``Kind of in passing, I said
`Someday we might need a little help ourselves,' and little did I
know it was just two years away.''
   Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste issued an executive order Friday that
he said would speed delivery of hay to drought-stricken farmers and
ban most outdoor burning, and he urged mandatory water use
restrictions statewide.
   Also Friday, Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt asked federal officials to
declare Alabama a disaster area, citing ``widespread damage to
corn, cotton, peanuts, soybeans, grain sorghum, hay and pasture
crops.''
   In a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, Hunt
said it was estimated that 30 percent to 50 percent of the state's
crops were damaged by the drought.
   In Washington, Lyng said the federal government likely will
support financial aid to farmers once losses are more fully known.
   After briefing President Reagan on the findings of an
interagency task force on the drought, the secretary told reporters
that long-range weather forecasts are discouraging.
   Meanwhile, administration officials disclosed that Reagan will
fly to Davenport, Iowa, July 14 to view drought damage.
   Despite up to 2 inches of rain this week, Iowa had its driest
half-year on record, said Harry Hillaker, acting state
climatologist.
   In the Tennessee River Valley, last month turned out to be the
driest June since records began in 1890, said Carl Vines of the
Tennessee Valley Authority.
   Of the TVA's 220 rain monitoring stations, 39 recorded nothing
during June _also a record.
   For today, showers and thunderstorms were predicted from the
lower Missouri Valley through the western parts of the lower
Tennessee Valley and central Gulf Coast into central and southern
Florida.
   The drought has cost North Dakota farmers $530 million in small
grain losses this year, while livestock producers suffered $225
million in losses caused by the drought, said Arlen Leholm, North
Dakota State University agricultural economist.
   North Dakota farmers also stand to lose as much as $473 million
in federal deficiency payments, the result of soaring crop prices,
and must recover some of that if the state is to get through the
drought, Leholm said.
   Leholm estimated North Dakota's total financial loss as $2.4
billion to $3 billion, including the impact of lost farm income
that would have ``turned over'' several times in the state.
   Michigan's crops have suffered as much as $600 million in damage
and that figure will climb higher unless rain soon soothes parched
fields, the state's agriculture director said.
