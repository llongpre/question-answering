SPRING gardening is just on the turn: the first rosebuds are visible; by
next week, wallflowers will be dropping their petals and hyacinths starting
to turn yellow and die down. Meanwhile, nobody can complain about the recent
clear spells in May. Lilac and fruit blossom have been wonderful and, to cap
it all, we now have the best season for bluebells in the past five years.
Do try to visit a wood during the next few days while they are at their
peak. They have revelled in the wet weather since last July and have proved
the gloomy forecasts wrong. Bluebell woods in Britain will be among the
first casualties if the globe ever starts to warm seriously. To judge from
their mood at the moment, the forecasts of warming have a very long way to
go.
We all love bluebells but, officially, we cannot decide what to call them.
The uncertainties surface in this week's most welcome arrival: it is not an
iris, a swallow or a peony but the most indispensable book of all for
gardeners. The year's The Plant Finder is out, just in time to catch the
cuckoo and to set us all on a mad path of hunting, visiting and ordering by
'phone.
The new edition is essential because it is bigger and has so many changes of
address and identity. At Pounds 10.99, it is still superb value. If your
bookshop cannot find it, you should apply to Moorland Publishing, Moor Farm
Rd, Airfield Estate, Ashbourne, Derbyshire.
Chris Philip and Tony Lord have continued to widen their brainchild's scope
and value. It now lists more than 60,000 varieties of plant on sale in the
British nursery trade, together with code names for their sources, maps, and
a check-list of their whereabouts. Each year, it cuts ever more deeply into
my fictional bedtime reading. Not only is it a self-published best-seller -
it is the essential companion for any keen gardener.
At this point, I should perhaps reassure the female reader who wrote to me
last year asking if it was my column which had mentioned a
privately-published Man Finder. There are fewer than 60,000 varieties, not
many of whom can cook or sew; and as most of them carry a health warning,
this volume has yet to finalise its distribution maps.
Meanwhile, in its absence, the new Plant Finder is a chance for a check-list
of personal favourites. How are the national stocks of the yellow-flowered
Onosma tauricum? Where can we still buy a long-flowering dianthus called
Jane Austen? And who lists the rare, ice-blue Hepatica with the biggest and
clearest flowers, Hepatica media Ballardii, which was for long presumed
missing in commerce? My first week of bed-time cross-referencing has sent me
to sleep with a smile.
All these favourites are alive in British circulation. Better still, the
number of stockists continues to increase. I suspect that plant-finding is
the sort of enterprise where growth is broadening the market. As we arm
ourselves with this book and start to hunt more widely, more nurseries begin
to trace and multiply the rarer lines of stock.
Twenty years ago, everyone was predicting the opposite. Big nurseries were
slimming down and packing up; we all began to lament that gardens were
'vanishing' because we simply did not know what a range of varieties was
still on offer in widely-scattered nurseries without a central database. The
Plant Finder has destroyed this myth. The balance might have shifted between
particular families, but I doubt if there were more than 60,000 varieties
from which our grandfathers could choose when making a pre-war garden.
We also have an embarrassment of nurseries - now up to 600 in the maps  -
and plant-finding acronyms, from CAbb to WWye. Random visits are the
pleasure of a plant-finding summer, to places which sell Parma violets among
the peat and goldfish to family nurseries round small-holdings in one of
which, last summer, I found bindweed growing up through the floorboards and
encircling neatly the pan of the visitors' indoor WC.
All manner of eccentricity lurks behind the acronyms, from plants in prams
to gasbags who talk the doors off their plastic tunnels. Plant-finding not
only changes the possible scope of our borders, it also widens our idea of
humanity.
For scent in spring, try the low-spreading meehania, listed here from four
suppliers (although I bought mine recently from a fifth); for a long season,
try the old white Agapanthus Ardernei, now listed by five nurseries where,
formerly, there was but one. The lovely white Helleborus olympicus is now
available from three suppliers, although the Finder adjusts its name
slightly; six sources list the low-growing Jeffersonia with sky-blue flowers
for a shady place.
Last week, I wrote about the brilliant blue Echium webbii at Tresco and I
now find that, in spite of the garden's doubts, two nurseries do list it,
although cuttings are hollow-stemmed and not easy to root. As yet, the
fabulous Paeony Joseph Rock has yet to re-appear in the lists and I am glad
that, three years ago, I bagged a bit of a sky-blue spring Phlox called
Geddington Cross: its one supplier has closed down. Otherwise, almost
anything is there if you want it, and who knows what you might find if you
gamble on the unknown?
The one problem for amateurs is the naming. Rightly, the editors follow
scrupulous standards and set the pace by keeping up with the latest
botanical names. Montbretias, therefore, turn up all over the place and you
cannot rely on a chrysanthemum any more. Here, the bluebells come back into
view: while you admire a wood of them this weekend, what exactly should you
call them in order to be politically correct?
Not long ago, you might have opted for a scilla, as a bluebell sounds
patronising and emotive. Then, it became an endymion, like the gorgeous
Greek boy who was loved in myth by the visiting moon.
Not so nowadays: a bluebell has become a Hyacinthoides, non-scripta being
the blue British form. Was endymion thought to be sexist? I cannot keep up
with botanists, and soon we gardeners will need a Name Finder as well.
