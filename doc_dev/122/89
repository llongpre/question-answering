   The Farm Belt drought appears to be regaining strength at the worst possible time for the nation's weakened soybean crop. 

   Soybean futures prices soared yesterday at the Chicago Board of Trade as some analysts sliced their estimates of the autumn harvest. 
The soybean contract for August delivery jumped 27 cents a bushel to $8.625 a bushel. 
Corn and wheat futures prices also rose. 

   Several meteorologists said yesterday that a ridge of high pressure is rebuilding over the Midwest. 
That in turn is pushing the jet stream, a pathway for storms, to a position unusually far north over Canada, where it was earlier in the summer. 

   The renewed forecasts of unseasonably hot, dry weather come at a critical time for soybeans, the nation's second-most valuable crop with a market value of about $13 billion. 

   Although soybeans are the most drought-resistant of the major crops -- and have suffered the least irreversible damage so far -- the plants are entering their most vulnerable stage. 
According to some estimates, a soybean plant can lose 3% of its potential yield each day when temperatures hit the high 90s in dry conditions. 

   The nation's worst drought since the 1930s weakened in mid-July when a high-pressure ridge over the Great Plains, which had blocked storms from the Farm Belt since spring, suddenly snapped. 
That allowed the jet stream to dip into the Great Lakes, bringing the first widespread rains of the summer and benefiting some crops. 
The last batch of storms is expected to cross the Upper Midwest today and Saturday. 

   But crop-threatening conditions are expected to reassert themselves and continue through the coming week, meteorologists say. 
"The drought never really broke," said Larry Heitkemper of Cropcast, a Chevy Chase, Md., weather forecaster. 
"It relaxed a bit. 
Now it's coming back full force." 

   While most analysts have been anticipating a soybean crop loss of about 14% this year, damage estimates as high as 25% or more circulated at the Board of Trade yesterday. 
Most of the soybean crop has ended the blooming stage, during which it can reproduce blossoms damaged by drought. 
The blossoms form pods, which house the seeds that are harvested in the fall. 
During the pod-setting stage, a weather-stressed soybean plant will abort its pods to save its life. 
Plant experts have been only partially successful at breeding that trait out of the soybean plant. 

   One major crop forecasting firm was rumored to have told its clients privately that it expects a soybean harvest of 1.42 billion bushels instead of the 1.65 billion bushels that most forecasters were predicting as recently as last week. 
A normal harvest would be 1.9 billion bushels. 

   Insects are compounding the crop troubles. 
Several Midwest states are struggling with one of their worst outbreaks ever of spider mites, yield-reducing pests that suck the underside of soybean leaves. 
Left unchecked, spider mites can cause soybean leaves to fall off. 

   The drought is spawning an explosion in the spider mite population by harming a plant fungus that attacks the tiny insects. 
Insecticides designed to kill spider mites are in short supply because infestations are rare. 

   Several states are asking the federal government to permit farmers to use insecticides that aren't approved for use on soybeans, said Ken Holscher, an Iowa State University entomologist. 
Some of these insecticides, however, aren't as effective as chemicals designed for use on spider mites, and are more dangerous to handle as well.
