   The Farmers' Almanac, renewing its crusade
to revamp the nation's coinage and currency, is promoting a $1 coin
to replace the dollar bill to pinch a few pennies for Uncle Sam and
taxpayers.
   The almanac's 1990 edition, just off the presses, also calls for
the elimination of the penny and 50-cent piece. The new $1 coin
could be called the Columbus Dollar, honoring the explorer who
discovered the New World, the publication said.
   The almanac endorses a bill introduced by Rep. Jim Kolbe,
R-Ariz., to direct the Treasury to mint and circulate the Columbus
Dollar and halt production of the $1 bill 18 months after the coin
is placed in circulation.
   Under the new system, the little-used $2 bill likely would become
the most popular piece of currency, says almanac editor Ray Geiger.
   Geiger maintains that the new system would create a coinage and
currency system that reflects contemporary values and lifestyles.
   He quotes the Federal Reserve as saying replacement of the $1
bill by the $1 coin would save the Treasury more than $120 million a
year.
   ``It costs approximately 2.6 cents to print a $1 bill and the
bill lasts about 18 months before it goes to the shredder. It costs
3{ cents to mint a $1 coin, but the coin will last 20 years,'' he
said.
   ``The Farmers' Almanac, 173 years old, has always been a champion
of the common man, and we think the common man is entitled to
protect his right to a coinage that's sensible and realistic,'' he
said in an interview.
   Geiger's publication, not to be confused with the 197-year-old
New Hampshire-based Old Farmers Almanac, has previously prodded the
government to restore city names to postmarks, eliminate the
nine-digit ZIP code and print currency in colors other than green.
   Geiger, who claims a circulation of more than 5 million, said
this year's 48-page almanac contains the usual mix of calendar data,
household hints, one-line jokes and inspirational messages.
   It also has weather predictions by prognosticator Caleb
Weatherbee that are based on ``a secret formula based on sunspots,
the position of the planets and the tidal action of the moon.''
   Weatherbee predicts that the winter of 1989-90 will be milder
than usual with less snow, while next summer will be pleasant with
moderate rainfall.
   The campaign for the $1 coin follows last year's proposal for a
new coin worth 12{ cents _ or one ``bit.'' As Geiger saw it, the bit
would bridge the gap between the dime and quarter. That suggestion
didn't catch on.
   But the almanac remains adamant that the penny has got to go,
saying most of the 200 billion in circulation simply gather dust in
shoe boxes and piggy banks. It suggests that sales be rounded off to
the nearest nickel.
   On the $1 coin, Geiger said the Susan B. Anthony dollar coin
failed to become popular because it was not easily distinguished
from the quarter and because it was introduced as an alternative to
the paper dollar, rather than a replacement.
   The almanac even has a design ready for a new $1 coin. Art
director Ed Greenwood drew a sample coin that features a portrait of
the explorer on one side and two of his ships on the other.
   The almanac suggests that the coin be gold toned, 1[ inches in
diameter, ungrooved or unribbed on the edges, with the thickness of
a quarter. It would also be light _ .015 ounce, or one-quarter the
weight of the old silver dollar.
