   Snows this winter could provide welcome relief
to drought-plagued areas of the Midwest, Northwest and Appalachia,
the National Weather Service projected Monday.
   The Southeast and Gulf Coast, meanwhile, appear likely to bask in
warmer than normal weather for the next three months, according to
the long-range forecast for December through February.
   ``This particular season, we think, is more likely to be warm
than cold, more likely to be wet than dry,'' said Dr. Donald L.
Gilman, the agency's chief long-range forecaster.
   Large areas of the middle of the country, including the northern
plains, remain a major question mark, however, with the forecast too
close to call in those regions, Gilman said.
   A major factor in the prediction is a pattern of cooler than
normal ocean temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, Gilman said. Unlike
years when this area has been warm, the cooler conditions tend to
steer weather systems from the Pacific across Mexico and into the
Southeastern states, pumping warm air into that region.
   But Gilman pointed out that conditions in the northern Pacific
and Gulf of Alaska are unsettled, and changes there could upset the
outlook for California and the Northwest.
   ``This is a zone of great doubt,'' he said.
   The best news is likely that there is little severe cold in the
forecast, Gilman said.
   But, asked if that means that the warmer than normal conditions
of the past summer were continuing, he said no. The above normal
winter temperature forecast is not a continuation of that pattern,
nor is it a result of overall climate warming, he said.
   For some drought-affected regions the outlook for a wet winter is
good news, he said. ``The Midwest outlook is favorable for helping
recharge the soil.''
   The strongest chance for wetter than normal weather is in
Michigan, Indiana and Ohio, Gilman forecast.
   Also anticipating a wet winter should be Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, western Montana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Kentucky, New
York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, western North Carolina, western
Virginia and eastern Tennessee.
   Dry conditions are expected from Southern California eastward
through Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Florida and the
southern portions of Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia.
   The outlook is too close to call in other areas, including the
northern Great Plains states, which have also suffered from drought
this year. But, Gilman noted, in that region the heaviest
precipitation is usually in spring rather than winter, so the
farming outlook could still be good for next year.
   Turning to temperatures, the only region with a below normal
outlook is Minnesota, Wisconsin, northern Iowa and eastern North and
South Dakota.
   Warmer than normal conditions are expected in Utah, Arizona, New
Mexico, most of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, West Virginia,
Virginia, Maryland, Delaware and all states to the south and east of
those.
   The odds of warmer than usual weather increase to the south and
east, the forecast notes.
