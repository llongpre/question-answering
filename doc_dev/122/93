   The drought baked all 420 acres of Keith
Salter's wheat, barley and oats crops. But with an inch of rain
last week and hopes of getting at least $12,000 in federal drought
aid, he sees a much brighter future.
   ``It's a good buffer, and it's probably enough to get most
people over the hump this year,'' the 53-year-old farmer said of
the $3.9 billion drought-relief package passed by Congress. ``It
won't be like a crop, but it's better than nothing.''
   The most expensive disaster relief measure ever enacted for
agriculture was approved by House on Tuesday after passing the
Senate the day before. The White House has said President Reagan
intends to sign the bill.
   Leaders of North Dakota's two largest farm organizations predict
most farmers in the state will qualify for some payments, although
they admit the aid won't be enough to keep all financially squeezed
farmers in business.
   ``If a farmer has been struggling these past few years ... this
will not allow him income to pay down debt and interest,'' said
John Leininger, spokesman for the 33,000-member North Dakota
Farmers Union. ``We are definitely going to see some farmers leave,
I am sure.''
   Leininger said the drought program would pump income, rather
than loans, into farmers' pockets, ``which is what they were
looking for.''
   Monty Burke, president of the 24,000-member North Dakota Farm
Bureau, said many farmers were breathing a collective sigh of
relief over the drought aid. ``It is going to keep some farmers in
business. It will be that simple,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his farm near McKenzie. ``Other farmers were going
to stay in business but were going to be in a weakened financial
position. This will give them the financial ability to go into
another year.''
   Asked whether the package contained enough money for farmers,
the 60-year-old farm leader said, ``Oh yes. ... I think it's all
that really could be expected out of Congress. Some farmers are
awfully hard-pressed for cash flow, and this is what it will
provide.''
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture has labeled North Dakota the
state hardest hit by this summer's drought, which destroyed an
estimated 75 percent of the wheat, oats and barley crops and forced
many livestock producers to sell off cattle as hay crops and
pastures wilted in the unrelenting heat.
   The drought relief kicks in for growers who lost at least 35
percent of their crop, with the USDA providing payments equal to 65
percent of lost income. Farmers with crop losses exceeding 75
percent of expected yield will be eligible for payments equal to 90
percent of income lost as a result of crop losses.
   Exactly how much federal aid will flow to the state is unknown.
But Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., projected it would be something less
than $400 million.
   According to the Farmers Union, a farmer with an average wheat
yield of 30 bushels an acre who harvested nothing this year should
earn at least $42 an acre in disaster aid. The payment would go up
to about $92 an acre if the farmer had federal crop insurance.
   The same farmer harvesting a normal crop would earn about $114
per acre, based on market prices this spring, Leininger said.
   Salter, a farmer since 1954, said crop insurance adjusters
considered his small-grain crops a total loss.
   As near as Salter can figure it, the disaster program should
pump at least $12,000 into his bank account _ enough to pay most of
his bills. He also has federal crop insurance to fall back on.
   Still, Salter said the payments would be about $5,000 short of
what he would have collected had he harvested an average crop.
   Salter also raises cattle at his farm about 10 miles northeast
of Bismarck, and must also figure in the damage to his pastures and
the loss of hay crops for his 100 head of cows. Because of the
losses, he'll have to buy feed elsewhere.
   Projecting into the fall and winter and next year's spring
planting season, there will be other drought-caused expenses, too,
he anticipates. So overall, he figures the drought will set him
back at least $20,000 _ even after disaster payments and crop
insurance.
   ``You never do fully recover from a drought,'' he said,
surveying countryside that was parched brown in June but has turned
green from recent rains. ``It always hurts. ... Your operation
recovers but you never recover what income you lost.''
