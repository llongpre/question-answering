   The Bush administration is threatening to veto
and key senators are promising to slash an ambitious drought relief
package approved by the House that would send more than $900 million
to farmers facing crop losses from severe weather.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter warned he would recommend a
veto of the House plan unless the Senate alters the measure, which
he says is too expensive and covers too many crops.
   The House passed the legislation by voice vote Tuesday, hoping to
speed assistance to winter wheat farmers in Great Plains states
where dry weather is expected to sharply reduce this summer's
harvests and to also bring relief to farmers of other crops.
   Supporters estimate the price tag will be about $975 million and
that the money could be covered by expected savings in federal
commodity subsidies, which should be lower because market prices for
drought-shriveled wheat harvests are expected to rise.
   Yeutter estimated the House bill could cost up to $1.5 billion.
He said the administration would support drought assistance limited
to winter wheat.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said he would work
for a tighter plan, calling the House bill a ``lavish multi-crop,
multi-peril, multi-bucks bailout for over 600 crops.''
   Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate Agriculture
Committee, which is schedule to take up drought relief on July 19,
have said they favor targeting payments to winter wheat growers.
   The drought bill introduced in the Senate would limit relief to
this year's crops planted in 1988 _ primarily winter wheat. The
House would set up assistance for crops planted this year, although
damage to those harvests is not yet known.
   Yeutter said ``an all-inclusive disaster relief program ... very
well might not be necessary'' for spring-planted crops because their
prospects have been improved by recent rains.
   The House legislation is also not restricted to drought problems,
and would make farmers eligible for aid if they have losses this
year for hundreds of other crops because of severe weather.
   ``No crop is covered unless it suffered a natural disaster. If
there is no disaster there is no coverage at all,'' said Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of a House Agriculture subcommittee on
wheat, sybeans and feed grains. ``So for all of those farmers who
are suffering an extraordinary loss let us do the same thing we did
last year. Let us show compassion. Let us show mercy for those
people.''
   Portions of the Great Plains and western Corn Belt have not
recovered from the drought of 1988, despite recent rains in some
areas. Lingering dry conditions early this year particularly hurt
producers in winter wheat-growing states, which range from
Washington to Ohio and Texas to Montana.
   Nationwide, the winter wheat crop is projected to be the smallest
since 1978. In Kansas, traditionally the nation's leading wheat
producer, forecasters say this year's harvest will be more than a
third smaller than last year.
   Key provisions of the House relief package would:
   _Make farmers eligible for assistance if they suffer losses of
more than 35 percent from a weather-related disaster.
   _Cap benefits at $100,000 for each producer, and prohibit
payments to those with $2 million or more in gross farm revenues.
   _Establish a new $75 million grant program for water assistance
to rural communities in drought areas. Money to pay for the program
would have to be provided in separate legislation.
