Catholic population -- A background box accompanying a story in The Times on 
Monday about church closings in Chicago incorrectly stated that Roman Catholic 
Church membership in the United States had plummeted from 73 million to 53 
million in less than a decade. The information, taken from the 1990 World 
Almanac and Book of Facts, was the result of a printing error by the Almanac, 
according to Constant H. Jacquet Jr., editor of the Yearbook of American &amp; 
Canadian Churches, which was cited as the Almanac's source. U.S. Catholic 
population actually grew from 50 million in 1980 to about 55 million last year, 
Jacquet said.
