<LEADPARA>  TWO IMPORTANT celestial events are coming up shortly, on successive days in
fact, and each can provide a great opportunity for us and for our children to
learn more about the wonders of our solar system.;   In the early morning
hours of Saturday, Dec. 21, a small part of our moon will pass through the
shadow of the Earth. This partial eclipse of the moon is not as rare, nor will
it be as impressive, as the solar eclipse we witnessed last July, but it's a
wondrous event just the same. It can also serve as a teaching and learning
vehicle to help prepare us for some more-spectacular eclipses that will occur
during the new year.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     To acquaint your children with the mechanics of a lunar eclipse, it may be
helpful to have a flashlight on hand, along with several common spheres, such
as a marble, a pingpong ball, a tennis ball or a grapefruit, that you can use
to represent the Earth and moon. By placing a marble or pingpong ball on a
table, and holding a lighted flashlight near the table's surface, you can
create a long shadow that extends from the object and narrows like a cone down
to a point. (This shadow is called the "umbra," from the Latin word for
"shadow," which is the root for our word "umbrella.");    THE EARTH casts this
same type of shadow in space -- 24 hours a day -- because the Earth is always
standing in the path of some of the light from the sun. This circular shadow
is widest at the Earth's surface, and when people on the Earth rotate into the
shadow, they refer to it as "night.";   From there, this same shadow stretches
approximately 850,000 miles out into space, but the circle gets smaller and
smaller before it narrows down to nothing. In all that immense distance,
however, there is only one object that the shadow can fall upon. Every once in
a while, our moon, which is whizzing around the Earth at nearly 2,280 mph,
will cross the path of this shadow, and some or all of the sunlight falling on
the moon's surface will be blocked out until the moon emerges from the shadow
once again.;   At 2 a.m. PST on Dec. 21, the very bottom part of the moon will
touch the very top of this shadow, and by 2:33 a.m., almost 10 percent of the
moon will be hidden, while the remainder will be bathed in bright sunlight.;  
By using the flashlight and two of the spherical objects, you can demonstrate
why an eclipse can occur only during the time of a full moon. The moon has to
be in line with the Earth and the sun to enter the Earth's shadow, and so
anyone on the "night" side of the Earth would see the moon fully lighted until
it touches that shadow.;   WHY DON'T we have an eclipse during every full
moon? Well, first of all, that alignment is tremendously precise. Think of
trying to align a grapefruit (the Earth), and a pingpong ball 12 feet away
(the moon), and a large house about a mile down the road (the sun). Even more
critical than this, however, is the fact that the moon doesn't orbit the Earth
on the same plane that the Earth orbits the sun. The moon's orbit is tilted
about 5 degrees, and so the moon usually passes above or below the Earth's
shadow.;   When some ancient Greek thinkers, such as Pythagoras and Aristotle
many centuries ago, saw this phenomenon we call a "partial eclipse," they
noticed that no matter where in the sky the eclipse occurred, the shape of the
shadow on the moon was always curved in the arc of a circle. Through their
reasoning and logic alone, therefore, they concluded that the Earth could not
be flat, and must be a giant sphere.  </TEXT>
