   AL-MATARIYA, Egypt (AP) _ Ancient Heliopolis, where legend says
the phoenix was resurrected from its own ashes, is buried or in
ruins. But like the fabulous bird that brought it fame, the city
itself is emerging from the ashes of time.
   Egyptian archaeologists are discovering remains under farmlands,
in the shadow of apartment high-rises, down alleyways and in
mid-campus at Ein Shams University.
   ``So much is left, but there's so much trouble getting to it,''
said Mohammed Abdel-Galil, chief antiquities inspector for
al-Matariya, a crowded suburb six miles north of downtown Cairo. He
is heading the search for ancient Heliopolis, struggling to keep a
step ahead of a critical need for space to accommodate an exploding
population.
   The isolated temple columns, mud-brick houses, fallen obelisk,
decorated tombs with star-studded ceilings and pieces of mummies
hint of the glory of the lost spiritual center the Greeks named
Heliopolis _ City of the Sun. It honored the sun god Re, whose
temple complex dominated ancient Egypt's history.
   An elegant reminder of Heliopolis' past, an obelisk, stands in
New York's Central Park. Its twin, the misnamed ``Cleopatra's
Needle,'' graces the bank of the Thames River in London.
   The most impressive Heliopolis remnant in its original home is a
solitary obelisk of red Aswan granite, erected almost 4,000 years
ago by Pharaoh Senwosret I. It weighs 121 tons and towers more than
67 feet above a quiet park amid the daily hubbub of modern life.
   Gamal Fares Abu-Fares, a young antiquities inspector, plucked a
blue faience statuette from a desecrated brick tomb more than 2,000
years old.
   ``Grave robbers took the valuable things and tossed relics like
this one aside,'' he said. ``The whole area is one vast cemetery.''
   Nearby, an angry-looking man paced back and forth _ the owner of
the construction site where the tomb was discovered.
   ``Every time we find another relic, he shakes his head,''
Abu-Fares said, explaining that it means the owner can do no work
until the excavators finish.
   By law, construction cannot begin in Egypt without a permit from
the Egyptian Antiquities Organization certifying the site's
historical unimportance.
   In al-Matariya, where the probability is high of archaeological
significance, Abu-Fares spends part of each day riding through new
housing areas checking building permits. His reception can be far
from friendly.
   ``Sometimes, we get into fistfights,'' he said.
   Historians fear for the city whose intellect dazzled early
Mediterraneans. It gave the world the obelisk. Its mathematicians
and astronomers created a solar calendar, 365 days divided into 12
months.
   Ancient Heliopolis' high priests created a think tank that
beckoned the leading brains of the day: the law-giver Solon came, as
did the mathematician Pythagoras. Plato spent years absorbing
Heliopolis' storehouse of knowledge.
   The sprawling modern suburb that Cairenes know as Heliopolis lies
southeast of the ancient city, which covered what is now Al-Matariya
and nearby areas.
   For almost 3,000 years of pharaohs, Heliopolis stood undaunted,
bowing only to a brash young Macedonian, Alexander the Great, who in
331 B.C. founded a rival city 130 miles to the north, Alexandria.
   By the time Christianity took hold more than 400 years later,
Heliopolis _ called ``On'' in the Old Testament _ was a ghost town.
Its remains were slowly covered by sand or they were carted away to
build the medieval city of Cairo.
   In legend, ancient Heliopolis lives side-by-side with the
phoenix. That dying magical bird set fire to itself on the altar in
the great temple of Re, and a new phoenix would fly from the ashes
to heaven, a promise to the ancients of resurrection.
   But two years ago, the city became far more than legend to
construction workers digging the foundation for an engineering
school at Ein Shams University, named for the spring where ancient
Egyptians believed the sun took its daily baths morning and night.
   As they dug, they unearthed evidence of a tomb, the first of an
eventual 15 that archaeologists would find.
   On a recent day at the dig, a tin can sat on the ground, holding
hundreds of colorful mummy beads that once adorned the dead. Skulls,
pieces of mummies hacked by grave robbers searching for jewelry and
layers of mummy wrappings were clearly evident in the
cross-sectioned hillside, frozen in time.
   To the din of nearby construction, excavators gingerly removed
remains with picks and shovels.
   A mile away, inspectors are excavating a large cemetery with
tombs decorated for officials 2,500 years ago. Sarcophagi line
uneven ground where a high-rise had been planned.
   Al-Matariya's Abdel-Galil, a soft-spoken man, constantly tours
such excavation sites, trying to piece together the meaning of
relics saved from steam shovel and pile driver. His work takes him
bumping from one rocky road to another, from modern suburb to remote
village, a 10-minute trip through a time tunnel.
   He said the most important find so far is a mile-long double
mud-brick wall separating a suburb from farming fields. According to
surviving accounts of early travelers to ancient Heliopolis, the
wall stretched for more than three miles, surrounding an enormous
city.
   In a quiet village about a mile from the wall, Abdel-Galil walked
among columns heralding the exploits of pharaohs Ramses III and
Ramses IV.
   ``We think a large temple of Ramses III is near here, maybe under
the fields,'' Abdel-Galil said. ``We have to find out, but we have
problems. The villagers don't have a sense of history.''
