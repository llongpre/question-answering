What to do with a pet while vacationing? It's a sticky question, one that 
Dorothy McCorkle of La Crescenta referred to in a letter last Sunday. We've 
come up with some additional details. The group of sitters she mentioned will 
volunteer to look after your dog/cat while you're away. Or any other animal, 
bird or fish that shares your roof. These are sitters who care for pets at the 
owner's home. Besides the pets, the sitters pick up mail, water plants and even 
house-sit. Fees and services vary. This is an association with dozens of sitter 
groups, from Ventura south to San Diego: Page's Pet Patrol, Animalovers, 
Connie's Pet Sitting, Pets Luv Us, Pampered Pets &amp; Plants, Cat Home 
Companion, Creature Comforts, Allie Cat &amp; Home Care, etc.
