Among mathematicians, Sir Roger Penrose is a caveman. I do not mean he is
some snaggle-toothed evolutionary throwback - even if certain high priests
of brain science would call him that.
He is a caveman because he agrees with Plato, who first used the analogy
that human beings are like prisoners in a cave who can see only the shadows
of reality thrown on to the wall by the firelight.
For Penrose, mathematical truths are part of reality: not human inventions,
but pre-existing 'forms' whose existence we have to discover.
He has reworked Plato's parable for the prologue of his second book, Shadows
of the Mind, which restates and develops the controversial claim of The
Emperor's New Mind that human understanding will never be explained in terms
of computer-like calculations.
Human consciousness cannot even be simulated by a machine. Furthermore, the
scientific explanation for consciousness will depend on discovering new laws
of physics.
The cave of the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at Oxford University is
satisfyingly chaotic. Papers, books and correspondence crammed the room at
the Mathematical Institute, a faded new block on St Giles. Adding to the
jumble were old geometric models made of plaster, metal and wire which had
been retrieved from some forgotten basement. A box of empty coffee jars and
a broken percolator lay on the floor, next to a jigsaw puzzle of special
difficulty based on one of Penrose's own geometric brainteasers. Symbols and
equations ran riot on the blackboard behind his desk.
Mathematics must be wired into the Penrose family. An older brother, Oliver,
has just retired as professor of mathematics at Heriot-Watt University,
Edinburgh. A younger brother, Jonathan, is a chess grandmaster. A nephew
teaches maths at Durham and a son is doing his post-doctorate in the
subject.
Penrose, whose special ability is spatial thinking, began constructing
polyhedra (many-sided shapes) at the age of 10, when he regarded maths as a
kind of game. 'An ability to do maths is not essentially different from
ordinary thinking,' he said. 'One does it for fun, really. So you have to
enjoy it to do it seriously.'
Mathematics was discussed round the family dinner table. Penrose's father, a
specialist in the inheritance of mental defects, would speculate on whether
the brain was some sort of computer. However, he expected his son to become
a doctor. 'I was actually, secretly, going to be a brain surgeon,' Penrose
said.
Another influence was a series of radio broadcasts by Professor Fred Hoyle
(leading proponent of the 'steady state' theory of the universe). Lunching
with his elder brother at Cambridge one day, Penrose impressed Denis Sciama,
a cosmologist, by questioning Hoyle's description of galaxies disappearing
over the horizon of the universe.
'I drew a picture to show it didn't make sense. I think Denis was quite
struck by this and later when I went to Cambridge as a graduate student he
took me under his wing.'
As a student at London and Cambridge, Penrose took up, as sidelines, quantum
theory, particle physics, general relativity and cosmology.
He also studied mathematical logic, where he encountered Kurt Godel's
revolutionary proof that in any logical system, such as that on which
arithmetic is based, there are truths which cannot be derived from the
axioms of the system. An interpretation of Godel's 'incompleteness' theorem
underpins the controversial claims of Shadows.
Penrose wrote these two 'popular' science books partly to convey his own
sense of excitement, he says. To call them popular is misleading, however.
Most of his supporting evidence is indecipherable to non-mathematicians.
Even if the hypothesis is clear, the books are tougher to read than the
best-selling Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, Penrose's opposite
number at Cambridge and former collaborator on Black Holes.
The books were to have been a retirement project. Then Penrose saw a re-run
of a TV programme in which Marvin Minsky and another American pioneer of the
'hard' school of artificial intelligence made 'some very extreme remarks'.
He added: 'From their very particular point of view what they said was
logical. But I just don't believe it. As an undergraduate I had tried to
build up logical systems which would reduce thinking to computation. Even
then, in the middle of doing it, I had a suspicion that something was wrong
and this wouldn't work.'
Most people, I said, had never heard of Godel but would say it was obvious
that consciousness wasn't just computation. Why did you need to demonstrate
it?
'It's very curious. You find people on both sides who regard the other point
of view as ridiculous. People say 'Why bother to write the book?' But what's
not so obvious is that I am saying something stronger: that is, that you
can't even simulate this activity.
'There is a view that a machine can act as though it sees red, feels pain,
etc. My line is different. I'm saying it can't even act as though it has
these qualities. There is something in our understanding which you couldn't
even imitate . . . and, stronger still, you couldn't do it with presently
known physics.
'The argument from obviousness is a good argument, but it doesn't get you
anywhere. It doesn't tell you what to do.' Briefly, what Penrose tells us to
do is look at the 'microtubules' in the neurons, or brain cells, for signs
of quantum brain activity which could, with the missing physics, translate
into non-computable consciousness.
Are you envious of the computer's power?
'People often ask me that one,' Penrose replied. 'There is certainly an
element of pride, I suppose, and not wanting to be outdone by a mere machine
and that sort of thing. If computers get very good at chess I don't like the
idea. But I'm pretty sure it's more than that. I don't think it's correct,
that's all.'
Do mathematicians like you feel left out of the argument?
'Certainly I feel there's an awful lot of very hard work, clever work, very
important work which is almost totally ignored and dismissed, simply because
it's not something that people understand and may not have any immediate
value. Mathematicians tend to be modest. They work away in their corners and
don't go and shout about things.'
So you think computer science is hijacking maths?
'I think to some extent it has hijacked it. There's some interesting stuff,
of course, and I don't want to denigrate it. But I don't think it should
take over in the public's mind.'
The pure mathematician is, of course, a species of philosopher. Whether
Penrose's mathematical brilliance carries over to his philosophical
reasoning is what his critics question.
But in subscribing to a Platonic world of ideas, he is certainly not alone,
even among mathematicians. The concepts, he says, are 'out there' in the
sense of being independent of our perception of them. Does he mean that they
exist like Plato's forms?
'Yes, very much so. But I get into a lot of trouble on that one. People will
often go along with other things I say. But even the most sympathetic I find
sometimes baulk at taking mathematical forms as really existing.
'The trouble is, if you don't take them as existing in some sense then the
other mysteries become even more mysterious. The physical world behaves to
such an extraordinary degree in accordance with highly sophisticated
mathematics. It makes that mystery even more puzzling if the mathematics
somehow isn't there, if it's our creation.
'Einstein's theory of general relativity is a wonderful example why that
can't be the case. Newton's theory of gravity had been around for years and
Einstein didn't need to produce a new theory for which there was anyway not
much evidence at the time.
'But now it's become the most accurate theory known to science. And it was
there all the time] It's not that somehow we've imposed our thinking on the
way that space is constructed. It's out there.'
Then why don't you just say that souls exist, too, and do our thinking?
'Well, I suppose one can say things like that. Certainly if one uses 'soul'
to describe a person's consciousness I have no objection to that. It's just
a word I tend not to like to use because it has unfortunate connotations. I
suppose I don't find it very helpful.'
Are you really a Pythagorean mystic?
'Sometimes people call me that. Labels are things which people put on me.
Pythagorean mystic? I hate to use the word mystic. But I certainly have been
called Pythagorean rather than Platonic as someone who believes in
mathematics underlying everything.'
I asked Penrose whether the controversy excited by his books was drawing him
away from his chief activity, which is mathematical physics  - specifically,
something called twistor theory which he has worked on for 30 years.
'I have other things I really want to get back to,' he said, 'although the
question of the missing physics is something I want to think about more
seriously. In a certain sense I regard all these other things as
distractions from my work. But they're interesting distractions.'
