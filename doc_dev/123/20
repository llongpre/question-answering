Despite centuries of effort, mathematicians have been unable to prove that the
most efficient way to arrange spherical objects is to stagger the layers so
that each object sits in the depression formed by those below. UC Berkeley's
We-Yi Hsiang has shown the validity in a 150-page proof of fJohannes Kepler's
1611 postulate.; To position round objects most efficiently on a flat surfact,
they should be arranged so that each touches six others as in this view from
above.; Greengrocers know that to stack oranges most efficiently, each one
should be placed in the depression formed by the oranges below it.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  A mathematician from the University of California, Berkeley, says he has
proved a theorem that has mystified scientists for 380 years.;    The theorem,
put forth by astronomer Johannes Kepler in 1611, involves the most efficient
way to pack round objects in a square box.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Greengrocers have known intuitively for hundreds of years that the best way
to pack oranges, for example, is to stagger the layers so that each orange
sits in the depression formed by three oranges below it. Kepler theorized that
a denser arrangement is not possible, but mathematicians have never been able
to prove it despite nearly four centuries of strenuous effort.;    In 15
months of work that has resulted in a 150-page printed proof, Wu-Yi Hsiang has
been able to show that Kepler and the greengrocers were right.;    The proof,
however, has implications far beyond packing: The theorem governs a broad
spectrum of the behavior of matter, ranging from why snowflakes have hexagonal
shapes to how metal and other crystals are formed.;     If the proof, now
circulating among other mathematicians, survives scrutiny, "Hsiang will have
achieved one of the most astonishing successes in the entire history of
mathematics," mathematician Ian Stewart of the University of Warwick said.;   
Hsiang, who has been on the campus for 23 years, is a well-respected
topologist, a researcher who studies the mathematics of surfaces. He became
interested in the Kepler problem, he said, when he volunteered to teach an
undergraduate course on classical geometry.;    Kepler, who achieved his fame
for formulating the laws of planetary motion, discovered the problem when he
began thinking about the exquisite six-sided symmetry of snowflakes. In a
pamphlet that was a New Year's present to his sponsor, John Wacker, he reached
the heart of the problem: Is symmetry imposed on snowflakes by something
outside them or is it inherent in the nature of the water molecules from which
it is formed?;    Assuming it was the latter, he began considering the way
that spheres (most simple molecules are roughly spherical) can pack together.;
   Two ways to layer;  To begin with, there are two ways to arrange a layer of
spheres in two dimensions -- such as on a tabletop. In the first, the spheres
are aligned in perpendicular rows so that each sphere touches four neighbors.
In the second, the rows are staggered so that each sphere touches six
neighbors -- which are at the corners of a hexagon. Kepler predicted that the
second arrangement provided the densest possible packing, but even that
seemingly simple idea was not proved mathematically until 1892, 281 years
after Kepler formulated it.;    The problem becomes more difficult when
extended to three dimensions, as when an orange crate is packed. There are
then two ways to add more layers to the first. In one, each new sphere is
placed directly above a sphere in the bottom layer. In the other, each new
sphere is placed in the depression between three spheres in the lower layer.; 
  Kepler calculated that in the first arrangement, only a little more than 60
percent of a box is filled with fruit. The second arrangement, widely used for
packing fruit and other round objects, is visibly denser -- 74.04 percent of
the space is filled with fruit, Kepler found.;    The question then becomes to
prove mathematically that this is the maximum possible density. Is there any
other arrangement of the spheres that increases their density? Kepler said no,
but was unable to prove it. Neither had anyone else until now.;    The problem
that blocked previous proofs, Hsiang said, is that the entire field of
spherical geometry was poorly developed. "Essentially, I had to develop
spherical geometry to the level needed to solve the problem," he said. That
meant developing many new spherical geometry theorems to provide the
intellectual framework necessary to produce the ultimate proof.;    "That's
why the proof is so long," he noted.;    The proof is also unusual in that, at
a time when computers are playing an increasingly important role in
mathematics, Hsiang worked largely without one. "There are still a lot of
mathematical problems that need ideas that don't come from a computer," said
UC-Berkeley mathematician Shiing-Shen Chern. "Computers are very fast, but the
basic ideas must come from humans.";    'Happy enough';  Is Hsiang's proof
correct? No one yet knows for sure, wrote Stewart in a recent issue of New
Scientist magazine, but "The mathematical community seems happy enough to
accept that it probably is.";    And what does the theorem have to do with
snowflakes? Kepler intuited that when large numbers of tiny particles, such as
water molecules or metal atoms, aggregate, they automatically create geometric
regularity. The water molecules that form the core of a snowflake adopt the
same form of dense hexagonal packing used by greengrocers. As the snowflake
grows, the symmetry is retained.;    Now, Hsiang has apparently brought the
problem full circle by providing the first mathematical proof of Kepler's
idea. In the process, he has shown geometricians that there is a lot that they
did not know about spheres.  </TEXT>
