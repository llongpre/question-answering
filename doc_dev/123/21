   A mathematical puzzle that has
fascinated scientists and researchers for hundreds of years may now
be solved, a professor at West Germany's Max-Planck Institute said
today.
   The puzzle has been how to prove Fermat's Last Theorem,
developed by French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, who lived from
1601 to 1665.
   The theorem states: X to the Nth power, plus Y to the Nth power,
equals Z to the Nth power, where X, Y, and Z are nonzero integers,
has no solutions for N when N is an integer _ or whole number _
greater than the number two.
   Fermat, who was also a magistrate, developed his expertise in
mathematics as a hobby, and was one of the founders of modern
Number Theory and Probability.
   ``Many important developments in number theory have resulted
from unsuccessful attempts to prove Fermat's Last Theorem,''
Professor Don Zagier said in a telephone interview.
   Now, Japanese mathematician Yoichi Miyaoka, who also works at
the Max-Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn, may have finally
proven Fermat's Last Theorem, Zagier said.
   ``This whole thing is of course in the preliminary stages, but
Miyaoka, who gave a presentation on his solution 10 days ago,
believes he has proven the theory and it is certainly serious and
very exciting,'' Zagier said.
   Zagier, an American working as a researcher at the Max-Planck
Institute, is also a professor at the University of Maryland.
   He said he jotted down notes at Miyaoka's presentation and sent
them to several experts, including Gerd Faltings at Princeton and
mathemeticians Barry Mazur and Christophe Soule' in Paris.
   ``Of course the notes alone are not sufficient, and Miyaoka has
been preparing and checking his manuscript on the solution for the
past week, and that will also be sent to the experts to check,''
said Zagier.
   Zagier said he hoped some results from the experts would be
forthcoming ``within 10 days, but it could also take several
months.''
   Asked if Miyaoka was available to discuss his solution of
proving Fermat's Last Theorem, Zagier said the Japanese was ``too
busy rechecking his work, because there is always a chance of an
error, and he wants to be sure the manuscript is accurate before it
goes out.''
   ``I've been more or less answering the telephone for him since
word of this leaked out,'' Zagier said.
