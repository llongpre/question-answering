<HEAD>Possible Solution Reported In Math Puzzle From 17th Century</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>

   A professor at West Germany's Max
Planck Institute said Wednesday a Japanese colleague may have
solved a mathematical puzzle that has beguiled scientists and
researchers since the 17th century.
   Professor Don Zagier, an American working as a researcher at the
institute, said in a telephone interview that mathematician Yoichi
Miyaoka may finally have proven Fermat's Last Theorem.
   The theorem was developed by French mathematician and magistrate
Pierre de Fermat, who lived from 1601 to 1665 and was a founder of
modern Number Theory and Probability.
   It states: X to the Nth power, plus Y to the Nth power, equals Z
to the Nth power, where X, Y, and Z are nonzero integers, has no
solutions for N when N is an integer _ or whole number _ greater
than the number two.
   Zagier said Wednesday, ``Many important developments in number
theory have resulted from unsuccessful attempts to prove Fermat's
Last Theorem.''
   He said Miyaoka, who also works at the Max Planck Institute for
Mathematics in Bonn, now may have succeeded.
   Zagier, who is also a professor at the University of Maryland,
said, ``This whole thing is of course in the preliminary stages,
but Miyaoka, who gave a presentation on his solution 10 days ago,
believes he has proven the theory and it is certainly serious and
very exciting.''
   Zagier replied when asked if Miyaoka was available to discuss
his solution that Miyaoka was ``too busy rechecking his work ... he
wants to be sure the manuscript is accurate before it goes out.''
   The American added, ``I've been more or less answering the
telephone for him since word of this leaked out.''
   Zagier said he jotted down notes at Miyaoka's presentation and
sent them to Gerd Faltings at Princeton, mathematicians Barry Mazur
and Christophe Soule in Paris, and other experts.
   ``Of course the notes alone are not sufficient, and Miyaoka has
been preparing and checking his manuscript on the solution for the
past week, and that will also be sent to the experts to check,''
said Zagier.
   Zagier said he hoped results from the experts would come in the
next 10 days, but it could take months.
