CAN THE Secret of the Universe be written on the front of a T-shirt?
Religious belief is in secular decline in the West, its explanations
seemingly exhausted. Now science, having murdered Faith, is accused of
failing us in its turn. The bookshops are bursting with competing answers:
on one rack religion, psychology and philosophy; on another astrology,
mythology and the occult; on a third, particle physics, the human gene,
consciousness, the universe, Everything. We are still desperately looking
for that whatever-it-is.
One of the best guides to the cosmic tour is John Barrow, author of the
T-shirt question. He is a 39-year-old cosmologist, professor of astronomy at
the University of Sussex, who studies the birth of the universe and the
formation of the galaxies. His popular books revolve around questions of the
ultimate. Is there a Theory of Everything, a TOE? Or is the grand unified
theory, so spectacularly marketed by Stephen Hawking, just wishful thinking?
Barrow may not have spectacular answers and his gifts as a scientist I
cannot judge. But as a populariser he is uncommonly successful: eclectic,
fluent, graphic and clear. His latest contribution, Pi in the Sky, discusses
whether mathematics (the form in which the TOE would be revealed) is in some
sense real, or whether it is just an uncannily successful device for
explaining the world to ourselves. The journey is as interesting as the
destination, as Barrow explains why words for 'one' and 'two' so often have
different roots from words for 'first' and 'second', or why ancient
shepherds could not count sheep.
Why should Barrow bother to tell us all this?
'It isn't to spread my name,' he said. 'It's important to get scientific
ideas across. I felt other people wouldn't write the books I wanted to read
 -so I had to write them myself.'
Scientists, he added, were writing their own popularisations these days to
explain their ideas to each other as much as to the public. 'So the public
are participating in a live dialogue, not just being sold a story.'
Is it also because science has become too difficult for non-scientists to
explain?
'In the UK popularisation has meant producing little pictures of what things
are like - for instance, how quarks are confined in nuclei like balls in a
rubber bag. It has come to mean producing analogies. At the turn of the
century continentals such as Poincare criticised us for that. But if you
look at what real scientists are doing you have to say that what they are
producing is analogies - if rather more complex, abstract and high-powered.
You might see mathematics as an analogy - or you might regard it as the real
thing.'
Is physics at a watershed? Is that why there is this desire to produce
ordinary-language explanations?
'For some reason there is enormous public interest. It is almost like a
substitute religion. The traditional view is that people like to have some
transcendent reality, just like they have to have a sense of community in
society. Perhaps this hankering after ideas of ultimate truth fits into that
category.
'But it can't be the whole story because people with conventional beliefs
are interested in these developments in science. One blatantly chauvinistic
attitude would be to say these things just are more interesting than
anything else on offer.'
Barrow is persuasive on a platform but in private is cautious, even
monotonous. He is agile physically as he is mentally; he was an 800 metres
runner, a former junior national indoor champion who once beat Steve Ovett.
It was through athletics that he acquired his unusual fluency and wide
knowledge. His seven A levels included classical Greek, religious studies
and English, which he read for at home with his philosophy-trained running
coach, John Turp, in exchange for instructing Turp in maths and physics.
'So I got used at a very early age to explaining things orally and learning
things by explaining them.'
There was no science in the family: his father worked for a subsidiary of
Joe Lyons, the catering chain.
Why did he choose cosmology?
'I can remember from the age of 16 or so wanting to do astrophysics. I was
not one of these people who wanted to look through telescopes. What
interested me was this issue of mathematics. I remember asking at school:
Why is that when we heat this thing up it does what the maths says it will
do? How does it know? The prospect of being able to understand a star
millions of light years away just by using simple laws of heat and gravity
all seemed very neat.'
When I asked him about those who accuse science of barren ambition, he
replied that specialisation was inevitable: western science had been so
fertile precisely because a monotheistic religion had prompted the search
for natural laws handed down by a divine lawgiver. Oriental science had been
retarded by the application of etiquette and harmony to nature.
Like Stephen Hawking before him, Barrow was summoned to Rome to debate
cosmology with Vatican theologians. God and science are not in opposition,
he said. 'You can think of God as a mathematician or computer programmer, if
you like, as lighting the blue touchpaper and retiring. Theologians prefer
to think of God as sustaining the world from moment to moment.'
It was biologists, not cosmologists, who were most hostile to religion
because of the Darwinians' struggle against the church in the last century.
'Cosmologists, I think, appreciate the uncertainty of their subject. They
are less confident and strident than biologists, with good reason. They have
less data. If you look at their personal views, you will find many more
cosmologists with strong religious beliefs than you would ever find
biologists.'
Are you interested in revealed religion?
'In my Theories of Everything I made the connection with mythological
accounts of the world. These in a sense were the first theories of
everything. They tried to include everything, leave nothing unknown or
inexplicable because it was too frightening. They made huge tapestries into
which to interweave more and more facts.'
Do you believe in resurrection and redemption?
Barrow was evasive. 'There may be a religious perspective that you won't
find in a test tube or in an equation: I'm a strong believer that there are
complementary ways of looking at the world.
'The scientific approach is different. Take a neon sign, for example. You
could explain it in terms of quantum electronics with 100 per cent
completeness but you wouldn't want to write down what the sign was actually
saying as part of that description. To say that the sign said 'Coca Cola'
wouldn't be part of the scientific account.'
I asked him to define the limits of science. Are you running out of
analogies? Is the world untranslateable now in a way that the Newtonian
world of billiard balls was not?
Barrow came back to his conundrum about the reality of mathematics. 'Is the
world really mathematical or is maths just a way of describing the world?
This is the crux of the question.
'Take a computer programme that simulates how galaxies form: load it up with
laws of gravity, run it to simulate billions of years, watch the clusters
occur. Continuing into the far future you would see stars and planets form;
you might see living beings evolve in the computer program which could
transmit messages to each other. Practically speaking, they would be
conscious but they would have no material existence. What are they? They
exist in the programming, in the mathematics. A Platonist would say they
exist in every possible sense of the word.
'There is this extraordinary power of mathematics. It doesn't almost work,
it works precisely and wonderfully and it works best in those areas such as
elementary particle physics that are farthest removed from our everyday
experience. So to say we just developed this capacity sounds wrong. Where
there is no evolutionary advantage, maths works most persuasively.'
Do cosmologists feel they are reaching the limits of what they can assert
and convey?
'They certainly might be reaching the end of the observational and
experimental road. There are two big constraints here. The first is: suppose
a Theory of Everything exists in some form, why should we be able to
understand and unravel it, living in 1992 on a planet in the suburbs of the
Milky Way? It's an extraordinary anti-Copernican presumption that we should
be clever enough to understand this after just a few hundred years of
thinking about it.
'The other telling point is that what we can know is conditioned by the
evolutionary process, by the necessities of surviving in our environment. As
far as we can judge there is no reason why understanding a Theory of
Everything is necessary for our survival.'
Does it matter if there is a TOE or not? Are you able to say if there is
one?
'I'm obviously not in a position to say, but I can speculate. If you look at
what scientists do there is almost a presumption that there is. It's grown
out of the idea that there is a single lawgiver and a set of laws. What's
the alternative, a series of cosmic Berlin walls?'
Would the TOE be boring?
'Well, it could turn out to be a necessary truth. There could be one and
only one possible mathematical theory in which every piece of the jigsaw
puzzle will fit. That's what people hope. The alternative, which to me seems
more likely, is that the theory would allow many different types of
universe, of which ours is one example. Just as the laws of nature allow
many outcomes in which the symmetries of the laws are broken and disguised,
the universe itself may be one of these disguised outcomes.'
Would it be a testable, useful theory.?
'It might be. But suppose there was a theory and we could find it by some
flash of insight, why should we be able to test it or check it? This is a
much more significant point. The problem is that theory races way ahead of
experiment. We don't have the financial means, the practical means, to test
theories about the beginning of the universe. Why should the universe be so
constructed that we should be able to test these theories?' So we could end
up with several consistent theories and no way of distinguishing which was
the right one?
'That's right.'
In The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Douglas Adams makes the computer,
Deep Thought, cough up the answer to the riddle of the universe. It is 42.
Deep Thought cannot, of course, supply the question. So, the day we learn
there really is a TOE, I doubt I shall feel too excited. I shall wait for
John Barrow's book.
