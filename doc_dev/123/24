   As thousands of American teen-agers
struggle with the complexities of basic algebra, a 17-year-old
English girl is being wooed by Harvard and several other
universities to lecture and continue her mathematical research on
such subjects as quantum groups and statistical mechanics.
   Ruth J. Lawrence, of Oxford, England, is manipulating some of the
most complex concepts in mathematics. Her work has taken her to the
outer fringes of theoretical physics and mathematics, such subjects
as knot and string theory, and the connections between the world of
particle physics and mathematics.
   She entered Oxford University six years ago and by age 13 had her
degree. Today she is working on her doctorate and has long since
caught the attention of the world's top mathematicians.
   Lawrence has already taught students at Oxford on a tutorial
basis. If she accepts a position at an American university it will
be mainly to conduct research. But she said she might lead a seminar
or deliver an occasional lecture. In addition to Harvard and
Berkeley, Princeton's Institute for Advance Study is interested in
bringing Lawrence in for a year.
   It all began not in some exclusive British school but in
Lawrence's own home in Oxford, where her father, Harry, a computer
consultant, gave Ruth her entire pre-Oxford education.
   ``I was always dealing with adults so when I got to Oxford I
fitted into the atmosphere. ... He didn't use any textbooks. He
taught me totally himself,'' she said Wednesday while visiting
Harvard with her father.
   Lawrence got top scores on her Oxford entrance exam. It was at
that point, her father said, ``it was obvious to me that she was a
little better than most.''
   Once at Oxford, Lawrence studied under Sir Michael Atiyah, Royal
Society Research Professor at Oxford and ``one of the great
mathematicians of the world,'' according to John Addison, chairman
of the mathematics department at the University of California at
Berkeley, one of the schools recruiting Lawrence.
   Lawrence seems to have taken her rapid rise in stride. She is
much more interested in talking about the vast unknown in the world
of mathematics than dwelling on her accomplishments.
   ``When I was taught mathematics in the beginning I was interested
in it. I just liked it. I didn't think it was anything special,''
Lawrence said.
   Now, Lawrence says, ``The age thing really does not matter for
more than the first two seconds. ... I talk to mathematicians as
mathematicians and I think they talk to me in the same way.''
   Addison, Berkeley's math chairman, has been tracking Lawrence's
career for the past seven years. ``Word was certainly getting around
in the mathematical field that there was this very unusual
prodigy,'' Addison said.
   Lawrence just spent four weeks in California attending a
prestigious mathematics conference at the Mathematical Science
Research Institute, also in Berkeley. The discussion among
scientists and mathematicians from around the world focused on the
relationship between physics and mathematics, Lawrence's area of
concentration.
   Addison interviewed Lawrence for a possible research position at
Berkeley and found her ``a very nice person. Sometimes prodigies end
up being kind of strange or egotistic. I didn't sense that.''
   Harry Lawrence said he taught his daughter at home so she could
reach her highest potential. He is using the same method in teaching
his other daughter, Rebecca, 15, who is something of a piano
prodigy, with one British Broadcasting Corp. concert under her belt.
   To the inevitable question of whether Ruth feels she has missed
out on childhood she answers unequivocally: ``I've had a very
enjoyable childhood. I've had so many opportunities I wouldn't have
had if I'd gone the ordinary route.''
