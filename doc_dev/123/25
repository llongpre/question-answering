<LEADPARA>  Math software has come a long way. Initially, programs for young students
often were little more than automated flashcards, and some programs today
still suffer from that lack of imagination.;    But, new programs are getting
better at using the computer's full potential, not just as a calculating
machine but as a colorful graphics engine that can hold the interest of
television-generation children and allow advanced mathematicians to visualize
complex concepts.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Instead of focusing on the manual labor of doing calculations, these
programs allow students to concentrate on underlying theories and concepts.;  
 To paraphrase Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer Inc. who is now
chairman of Next Inc., math software may be a tool for focusing on the prose
of mathematics without getting lost in the grammar.;    Jobs was referring
specifically to a program called Mathematica, which he includes with each Next
work station he sells.;    Mathematica is a powerful, symbolic math processor
that can automate numerical and symbolic computations and display complex
graphic representations of abstract equations. It is not for math sissies.;   
Besides the Next version, which uses the Unix operating system, Mathematica
also is available on personal computers.;    The Macintosh Mathematica is $495
for the standard version, which does not require a math co-processor chip, and
$795 for an enhanced version that uses the built-in co-processor of Mac II
systems. For 386-based MS-DOS computers, the regular and enhanced versions are
$695 and $995, respectively.;    Mathematica is sold by Wolfram Research Inc.
of Champaign, Ill., (217) 398-0700.;    For those who might not need all the
supercomputer graphics power of Mathematica but who still need a computational
engine that is robust and flexible enough to serve both the rocket scientist
and the high school student, there is MathCAD ($495 for either the Macintosh
or personal computer versions, from Mathsoft Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., (800)
628-4223.;    Mathsoft, which gives "very aggressive educational discounts," a
spokesman said, is working on a new personal computer version for release in
the spring.;    By the time students are ready to use Mathematica or MathCAD,
they probably have a firm grasp of basic math principles.;    For younger
students who need a grounding in the basics, there are many good programs
available.;    The New Math Blaster Plus, for DOS computers, updates one of
the most popular math programs for students in grades 1 to 6 (ages 6 to 12).; 
  The "new" apparently refers to the inclusion of VGA-level graphics and new
sound effects, as well as a new problem-solving game.;    A sticker on the box
refers to "state-of-the-art" graphics, animation and sounds, which is an
exaggeration. The VGA graphics and sound effects are not bad, but they are
nothing extraordinary.;    The program consists of four activities, each of
which covers addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, decimals,
fractions and percents.;    The parent or teacher (or child, for that matter)
may choose the level of difficulty on a scale that corresponds to grade
level.;    The New Math Blaster Plus uses an outer space theme -- the good
guys are Blasternaut and his sidekick Spot (it would be nicer if the main
character were gender-neutral), and the bad guys are the "Evil Trash Aliens"
who litter the galaxy with debris.;    The conservation theme is carried to
some of the other activities. By answering questions correctly in one of the
four activities, for example, the player "recycles" numbers.;    Teachers or
parents may print certificates of achievement and "report cards" for players
who do well. In a test run using an ink-jet printer, the fancier certificates
would not come out because the software does not yet support that type of
printer, but a rather drab, plain-text certificate came out fine.;   
Equations also may be printed in test form, and teachers may add their own
questions to the mix to make customized tests.;    The New Math Blaster Plus
costs $49.95 for the DOS version and $59.95 for the Macintosh version and is
available from Davidson &amp; Associates Inc. of Torrance, (800) 545-7677. As with
all Davidson titles, the program has a 30-day "satisfaction guarantee" that
allows for a full refund or exchange.;    Older students, from ages 10 to
adult, may wish to consider Math Blaster Mystery, which goes beyond Math
Blaster Plus to include word problems and pre-algebra.;    The Macintosh
version was tested on a Macintosh LC ($49.95), although MS-DOS and Apple II
versions also are available. Again, there are four activities.;    One of the
few mysteries in Math Blaster Mystery is why it is called "mystery" in the
first place. The activities are more along the lines of puzzles, such as math
versions of Hangman and the Towers of Hanoi.;    Along the way, the student
learns reasoning skills, negative numbers and factoring. Older students may
find the games boring after a while, but the software generally held the
interest of one pre-algebra lab assistant.  </TEXT>
