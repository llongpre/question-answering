FROM THE UPSTAIRS PORCH window of his split-level house in the Puente Hills, 
Bart Kosko enjoys a view of the largest Buddhist temple in the Western 
Hemisphere. Others can keep their manicured lawns, swimming pools, hot tubs, 
nearby golf courses and sundry suburban amenities. For Kosko, a 30-year-old 
assistant professor of electrical engineering at USC, it is enough to be able 
to gaze at one of the few buildings in the country where his concept of reality 
would not be denounced as scientific heresy, as well as an affront to common 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to have a great belief in the truth of your own statements," says 
Kosko, whose mathematical ideas continue to encounter resistance and outrage 
from the scientific community in this country despite their widespread 
acceptance and application in Asia. "You may have stumbled, humbly, upon a 
universal truth, but if the world, everyone from Aristotle to Bertrand Russell, 
says you're wrong, it takes immense ego not to agree with them." 
</P>
<P>
The universal truth to which he refers is called fuzziness. Developed by Polish 
mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz during the 1920s and expanded (and named) 40 
years later by UC Berkeley computer scientist Lotfi A. Zadeh, fuzziness refutes 
the traditional Aristotelian theory of absolutes, arguing that the world is 
full of things that defy categorization by Western logic, things whose 
definitions are a little fuzzy. Its applications are, among other things, 
revolutionizing the computer world by creating systems of machine intelligence 
that compute in terms of humanlike reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko, a Zadeh protege, is the veritable St. Paul of Fuzziness. The American 
scientific community does not always take kindly to his devotions, however. 
Telling a modern scientist that there can be logic without Aristotelian tenets 
is like telling a Catholic there can be Christianity without Christ -- some 
scientists have apoplectic fits at the mention of Kosko's name. Yet in this 
time of technological competition with the East, Japanese and Chinese 
scientists embrace fuzziness; with its acceptance of universal ambiguity, 
fuzziness is the mathematical equivalent of Taoism and Zen Buddhism. In Japan, 
especially, Kosko is the Carl Sagan of fuzzy technology. Indeed, as many 
Western scientists begin rethinking Kosko, this mathematical doctrine may force 
the first actual confrontation, and eventually a melding, of Eastern and 
Western philosophical and scientific ideology. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko is, in essence, the quintessential scientific cyberpunk -- a hip, 
street-smart prophet of life in the Information Age. He's also a musician, an 
essayist, a screenwriter -- and a pugnacious sort. He just may be able to pull 
it off. 
</P>
<P>
ZADEH EXPERIENCEDhis first flash of fuzzy revelation in a hotel bed; Kosko did 
his mentor one better -- he worked out key facets of the geometry of fuzziness 
while soaking in the hot tub behind his house. 
</P>
<P>
The hot tub is a fitting place for lambasting Aristotle. The baths were an 
ideal setting for ancient Greeks to debate the merits of the philosopher's 
world view. In his hot tub, Kosko contemplates his longstanding frustration 
with the way those theories continue to prejudice Western imagination. 
Aristotle, Kosko says, was just too rigid in his thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"Aristotle was never one to split hairs," he explains. "He believed you were 
either hairy or you weren't. If I were inclined to start plucking my own -- 
which I'm not -- I would eventually pull out the one hair that he would have 
argued separates hairy people from non-hairy people. Say that hair is number 
5,000. With it, I'm hairy. Without it, I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
In science, Kosko says, this absurd yet inviolable rule -- that everything must 
fit one category or another at all times -- is called the Law of the Excluded 
Middle. In it, there can be no shades of gray, no concepts such as "partly" or 
"mostly." 
</P>
<P>
"We've all been conditioned to behave as if this was true," Kosko says. "But it 
isn't -- not in the real world. These binary assumptions offer a handy first 
approximation of reality. But sooner or later they break down." 
</P>
<P>
Computers, symbols of pure logic, offer a good illustration of the difference 
between fuzzy and non-fuzzy thinking. Non-fuzzy computers, the technological 
epitome of Western thought, rely entirely on binary thinking. Everything they 
do is the result of combining ones and zeroes with and, or and not. The only 
thing programmed into the system is yes or no, categories of equality and 
inequality, and that's all that will come out. 
</P>
<P>
A traditional computer would have difficulties accommodating the concept of a 
platypus, for example, because it is an animal that is and is not, in equal 
measure, a mammal. Faced with this peculiar creature, the computer, like 
Western thought, is reduced to spinning its figurative gears. It simply cannot 
grapple with a world in which reality does not come prepackaged in crisp binary 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
Western scientists have tried to account for inherent ambiguities of the 
universe with probability theory -- the mathematical expression of the chance 
that a specific event will or will not occur. It usually takes the form of a 
number between one and zero. In the case of a set of tall people, for instance, 
individuals always would be categorized as tall or short. But a 5-foot-tall 
person might be described as having a 50% probability of belonging to the set, 
a 6-footer 90% and a 7-footer 100%. In other words, probability reflects the 
statistical averages of the population -- 50% are below 5 feet, 90% are shorter 
than 6 feet and 99% are shorter than 7. 
</P>
<P>
Probability works with large statistical populations, Kosko says, but is 
incapable of dealing with most individual situations. 
</P>
<P>
"It assumes the world is black or white," Kosko says, "but it's never sure 
which one. There's uncertainty in fuzziness, too, but it's deterministic 
uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
Fuzziness, he says, measures the degree to which an event occurs. In other 
words, it models reality, basically providing a shortcut that probability 
cannot. A computer programmed with fuzzy chips can deal with degrees. It may, 
for instance, be drizzling slightly outside. A fuzzy computer chip will not try 
to categorize it as raining or not because it relies on a user-defined alphabet 
of functions rather than the usual ones and zeros. It can compute variations of 
measurement from light to heavy, small to large or slow to fast. 
</P>
<P>
An ordinary air conditioner, for instance, kicks in when it senses the 
environment is either too hot or too cold. It either will begin blasting at 
full power or shut down. But this isn't efficient or conducive to maintaining 
maximum levels of comfort. A fuzzy air conditioner, however, would be able to 
identify the more-comfortable temperature ranges. Instead of shutting down, the 
fuzzy air conditioner would taper off its activities as the area being cooled 
became more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
So when a fuzzy computer is charged with control functions such as, say, 
docking a space shuttle with a space station, these translate into a smoothness 
of performance in control systems that cannot be replicated otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of Kosko's theories revolve around computer applications, he has 
dozens of everyday examples to explain the difference between fuzziness and 
probability: Whether or not an article is published, to use one of his 
favorites, is a matter of probability. The degree to which it is published -- 
it may or may not have been heavily edited -- is one of fuzziness. Or suppose, 
he says, there is a 50% chance that there is an apple in your refrigerator. 
That is probability. But what if there is half an apple in the refrigerator? 
That half an apple has a 50% degree of membership in the set of whole apples. 
Numerically, these two situations are equivalent. Physically, however, they are 
distinct. 
</P>
<P>
KOSKO HIMSELF embodies the fuzzy idea of many things concealed in one. A former 
farm boy who escaped the Midwest on a full music scholarship to USC in 1978, 
Kosko straddles the disparate, and often antagonistic, cultures of science and 
art. As a neural networks expert and a fuzzy theorist, he has organized several 
important international conferences and is about to publish the first college 
textbook about neural networks -- computer systems that emulate an organism's 
ability to learn by experience. NASA uses him as a consultant on the space 
shuttle, as did the Strategic Defense Initiative Office. Outside the realm of 
science, Kosko is an accomplished composer who scores his own videotaped 
lectures and a published writer and essayist. Currently, he is collaborating 
with Bill Gray, co-writer of "The Philadelphia Experiment," on a 
science-fiction screenplay. 
</P>
<P>
"I realize that many people within academia frown upon my outside pursuits," 
Kosko says. "I suppose they view it as a dissipation of energy. I see it as a 
stimulant. I have a lot of energy." 
</P>
<P>
Kosko is a "bewildering combination of talents," says Marvin Minsky, an 
artificial intelligence pioneer at MIT. George Klir, editor of the prestigious 
International Journal of General Systems (soon to publish Kosko's latest paper, 
which details the theorems proving fuzziness) calls Kosko's mathematical ideas 
"quite profound." And Zadeh, his mentor, calls him "one of the most unusual and 
most highly gifted individuals I have ever met." 
</P>
<P>
Beneath it all lies obduracy that prevents Kosko from ever backing down from a 
fight. Bart Kosko is cocky and tenacious and driven by the belief that time is 
the enemy of all things. And to keep up with the exponential rate of change 
engulfing the world, he is prepared to do without sleep -- Kosko puts in a mere 
four hours of sack time nightly. Uncharacteristically for one so young, Kosko 
feels the clock ticking deep in his gut. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko grew up in a largely Slavic, working-class Kansas City neighborhood 
called Strawberry Hill. His childhood was an odd mixture of "Little House on 
the Prairie" and the "Lord of the Flies." The woods behind his house were great 
for woodcraft, hunting and trapping and amateur rocketry. But they were also 
the scenes of sometimes vicious B B gun, wrist-rocket and Molotov cocktail 
battles between warring neighborhood kids. Bart, his friends recall, could 
always be found in the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
"Bart was the most passionate person I ever met," recalls childhood friend 
Kevin Helliker, an author and journalist who lived two houses down from him as 
a boy. "Our sense of the Koskos was that they had more fun than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
That changed tragically in Bart's 10th year, when their house burned down 
because of an electrical short. A few months later, Bart's father, a building 
contractor, was killed in a car accident. 
</P>
<P>
"All kids have a keen sense of what's fair and not," Helliker says. "But Bart 
had this tremendous, inborn outrage at injustice. That outrage only increased 
after the death of his father." 
</P>
<P>
The financially strapped Koskos moved to a farm near Lansing, Kan., where Bart 
threw himself into a variety of pastimes to escape his loneliness and anger. He 
gobbled up books on science, philosophy, literature, art and politics. Along 
with improving his karate, he taught himself how to play the mandolin, guitar, 
balalaika and piano. His friends never knew of his musical acumen until they 
read in the newspapers that he had won a national Young Composers Contest. Then 
in 1977, he won a full scholarship to USC, having composed an orchestral 
overture to "The Count of Monte Cristo" in high school. 
</P>
<P>
As an undergraduate at USC, Kosko decided to supplement his income by writing 
for pay. Learning that the men's adventure market was wide open, he placed 
short pieces in magazines such as Oui and Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
What motivates Kosko? "You have to understand that Bart is indignant over the 
ultimate imminence of his own death," says Helliker in an attempt to analyze 
his friend's drive to succeed in so many areas. "Last year, when we spent some 
time together, he advised me almost daily to reflect on the fact that the 
coroner would be cutting out my guts sooner than I imagine. Death was never far 
off -- it should be stared in the face on a daily basis, he said, to remind us 
we don't have time to waste." 
</P>
<P>
Kosko agrees that he views "with dread" the prospect of his own demise. 
Mortality is, in fact, what makes Bart run as if someone -- or something -- 
were chasing him. 
</P>
<P>
KOSKO'S STAY at the USC School of Music was short-lived. Although he had passed 
his graduate placement exams, he and the school differed over what he should be 
studying. "I just hated atonal music," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko kept his scholarship for a year, but he was strongly urged to find 
another major. He chose philosophy and economics, eventually becoming a fan of 
free market economist Milton Friedman and a campus libertarian activist. But he 
soon ran into conceptual difficulties that might not have fazed his fellow 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"In philosophy," he explains, "one does logic. But the Aristotelian theories 
underlying it hadn't changed in 3,000 years. That is never symptomatic of a 
healthy theory. 
</P>
<P>
"I eventually abandoned philosophy because I felt that there was no room in 
academia for philosophers in the classical sense that Kant, Aristotle, Hume and 
Descartes had been. They had done their best to master all the science and 
mathematics of their day. In many cases they actually contributed to it. I 
began checking out math books." Kosko went on, in fact, to secure a master's 
degree in mathematics and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, which he viewed as 
a field in which most of his scientific interests converged. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko's fuzzy road to Damascus ran through Austin, Tex., where he met Zadeh at 
an artificial intelligence conference in 1984. A year before that, he first saw 
the word fuzzy in a scientific paper. Kosko recalls being struck by revelatory 
wonder. "This really seemed to tie together many of my concerns," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Zadeh was fiercely attacked for his ideas. Kosko, a young 
graduate student, without a doctorate much less professional standing, stood in 
front of a room filled with the Pharisees of the scientific community and 
mounted an impassioned defense of a concept of fuzziness, although the 
mathematical questions had not been asked or answered. (Two years later at 
another conference, this same fervor would induce one scientist to bang on a 
table in Kruschevian fury, yelling that "a set is a set is a set.") Zadeh was 
impressed. Immediately afterward, Kosko mailed Zadeh a theorem supporting 
fuzziness. Zadeh eventually became Kosko's thesis adviser. 
</P>
<P>
A year later, Kosko attended another conference at which a well-known 
probabilist insisted publicly, and almost persuasively, that Zadeh was 
violating some inherent law of nature with his theories. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember a chill going through the audience," recounts Kosko. "I suddenly 
had the sinking feeling that maybe there really is no fool like an old fool. At 
that point, I decided I had to know definitively if fuzziness was true. I was 
like a theist impelled to establish the existence of God. If it were so, I'd 
become a priest. If not, I'd be the biggest atheist that ever lived." 
</P>
<P>
After conscientious deliberation and much back-to-the-basics mathematical 
formulation, Kosko eventually decided in favor of fuzziness. His dedication 
marked him as both maverick and dangerous iconoclast. Notoriety came during the 
mid-'80s, when he began to vigorously champion neural networks. Now an accepted 
part of the computer world, they were as scientifically outre then as fuzziness 
is now. 
</P>
<P>
IN ADDITION TO being its prophet, Kosko has made a unique contribution to fuzzy 
set theory. He geometrized fuzziness, gave it concrete form and functionality, 
just as Einstein geometrized space and time. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko pictures the set of fuzzy sets as a Rubik's cube. Each set becomes a 
point in the cube. Conventional sets occupy the corners of the cube with fuzzy 
sets occupying the rest of the cube. Each element in the fuzzy sets belongs to 
the set to a different degree. The farther the set is from the corner, the more 
it resembles its own opposite. At the midpoint, the set equals its own 
opposite. That's where the world's classical paradoxes reside, Kosko says. The 
points within the cube model ambiguity. Once within the cube, he says, we can 
accept and understand the paradoxes and ambiguities of life. 
</P>
<P>
Kosko calls this "the black hole of set theory, where a thing can be its own 
opposite." Here, for instance, you will find the proverbial cup that is half 
empty and half full, the Taoist concept of yin yang, the liar from Crete who 
said all Cretans are liars, Bertrand Russell's set of all sets that are not 
members of themselves, and Russell's barber. 
</P>
<P>
Russell's barber, Kosko explains, is a bewhiskered man who lives in a town and 
who shaves a man if and only if he does not shave himself. So who, one might 
ask, shaves the barber? If he shaves himself, by definition he does not. But if 
he doesn't, he does. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of speculation is enough to drive most Westerners crazy, and 
according to the annals of mathematical history, many have despaired over 
resolving such enigmas. But, Kosko says, despair only sets in if one rigidly 
ascribes to an arbitrary insistence on bivalence. People in the Far East, he 
says, would not likely fall into such a trap. In societies where Buddhism is 
common, such as Japan -- which he visits frequently as consultant, conference 
organizer and general representative of what many Japanese corporations 
consider the future of technology -- the idea of a thing containing its own 
opposite is not hard to accept. It may, in fact, be a characteristic of mature 
civilizations that they are simply more capable of recognizing fundamental 
limits in man's ability to know the real world. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end," he says, "the insistence on either / or interpretations of 
reality, which Western science relies upon, is merely a cultural preference." 
</P>
<P>
Fuzzy proponents believe that fuzzy thinking may hold the key to the 
development of the kind of artificial intelligence suggested by HAL, the 
computer in Stanley Kubrick's film, "2001: A Space Odyssey." Katsushige Mita, 
president of Hitachi Ltd. and chairman of the board of LIFE, Japan's new 
Laboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering Research (which is funded by the 
Ministry of International Trade and Industry and more than 45 of Japan's 
largest high-tech corporations), believes that "fuzzy artificial intelligence 
will play an important role in the future intimate relationship between men and 
computers." 
</P>
<P>
Already, manufacturers in Japan are spinning off a host of applications, from 
air conditioners, camcorders and automobile transmissions to subway trains and 
stock-trading programs. All use fuzzy chips that enables control systems to 
smooth out functions that otherwise might oscillate between minimum and maximum 
values. 
</P>
<P>
Many American scientists insist that probability can do anything fuzziness can, 
and generally with better results. Only one U.S. company, Togai Infralogic of 
Irvine, designs and produces fuzzy chips. Some critics argue that the concept 
of fuzziness has never been articulated in a manner scientists could validate. 
Judea Pearl, a professor of computer science at UCLA, says he is "still waiting 
for a good definition of what a fuzzy system actually is. I haven't yet seen 
one that is divorced from jargon." 
</P>
<P>
"Any problem which fuzzy technique is designed to handle can be solved just as 
well, if not better, within a probabilistic framework," adds Peter C. 
Cheeseman, a researcher at the Research Institute for Advanced Computer Science 
now on contract with NASA Ames Research Center near San Francisco. Scientists 
there are exploring fuzzy control techniques for space-shuttle docking 
maneuvers. Cheeseman is not impressed by these efforts. According to Cheeseman 
and other digital purists, Kosko and other fuzzy advocates have vastly oversold 
the benefits of their reasoning. Fuzziness, by its very nature, may lead to 
unreliable systems. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to be on a spacecraft being docked by fuzzy techniques," he 
says. "It may work well 99% of the time until, whoops, hey, no space station!" 
</P>
<P>
KOSKO'S CRITICS must wonder how long he can remain so brash. Burnouts are no 
rarity in science, and Kosko, who for five years has been passionately 
campaigning for fuzziness, seems to be pushing his luck. Those who know him 
well, however, have few such qualms. 
</P>
<P>
"In Einstein's day," recalls Robert Hecht-Nielsen, a former colleague of 
Kosko's who is now owner and president of a high-tech firm in San Diego, "there 
were a number of great intellects who did amazing things. But they never 
achieved Einstein's prominence, despite their talent, because they had no 
staying power. I'm not comparing Bart to Einstein in any definitive sense, but 
I do think he can hang in there." 
</P>
<P>
So, Kosko believes, can fuzziness. He says that it will ultimately make 
possible genuine reasoning systems in machine intelligence, where artificial 
intelligence and neural network approaches have failed. Working a fundamental 
change in the way people regard the world, however, will take decades, if not 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
To this day, Westerners have not yet faced, in any deep sense, the inherent 
screwiness of the physical universe as demonstrated by physicists during the 
early decades of this century. Eventually, Kosko says, "our physical 
explorations of subatomic reality, antimatter, and the space-time fabric will 
probably lead us to entirely different times and places, different definitions 
of reality." 
</P>
<P>
"There may be no God but the Mathmaker," Kosko has written. "And Science is his 
prophet." Kosko's own prophecies, he prefers to make known in his upcoming 
science-fiction movie. The one thing we can count on, he says, is that 
fuzziness is here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
The question, however, is to what degree.
