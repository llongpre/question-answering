<LEADPARA>  LIKE parents looking on in startled wonder at the works of their children,
knots of mathematicians clustered last week around television sets in the San
Francisco Hilton Hotel to watch the war against Iraq unfold.;    The 4,000
mathematicians were attending joint meetings of the American Mathematical
Society, the Mathematical Association of America and the Society for
Industrial and Applied Mathematics.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  MATHEMATICS AT FOREFRONT OF GULF WAR  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     While the world marveled at films of missiles striking Iraqi targets with
uncanny accuracy, the mathematicians may have been the only watchers who
understood the role they had played in the bombardment.;    The technology
employed in the allied air attack is firmly rooted in complex theorems and
algorithms. If World War I was the chemist's war because of the poisonous
gases used and World War II the physicist's war because of the atomic bomb,
then this war could be justifiably called the mathematician's war.;   
Virtually every mathematical discipline seems to be finding some application
in Operation Desert Storm:;    (check) Control theory, a mathematical
discipline dealing with the control of mechanical systems, used in missile
guidance and targeting systems.;    (check) Coding theory, used in signal and
image processing to understand radar and satellite data.;    (check)
Cryptography and cryptanalysis, used to encode allied communications and
decipher enemy transmissions.;    (check) Statistics, used to plan the
logistics of such a massive deployment of personnel and supplies.;    Dr.
Andre Manitius, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at George
Mason University in Fairfax, Va., was struck by the precision bombing.;   
"Mathematics here could be said to be actually saving lives because of the
precision and accuracy made possible.";    The Patriot system, he said
requires a tremendous amount of mathematical computations to hit an incoming
Scud missile. Trajectory data retrieved from radar and satellites contain many
errors that have to be cleaned up. And the changing positions of the incoming
missile and the intercepting Patriot missile must be calculated forward in
three dimensions. All of this involves the use of complex algorithms, or
mathematical recipes of computation steps that tell the missile's computer
what to do.;    Mathematics and the military are not new acquaintances, and
government funding for math research has grown steadily since World War II.
The National Security Agency is reportedly the largest employer of
mathematicians in the United States. But many of the mathematicians gathered
at the conference challenged their roles in weapons development.;    Dr.
Samuel Anderson, a mathematician at the New School of Social Research in New
York, even suggested that mathematicians involved in Department of Defense
research should "cease and desist that activity.";    For better or for worse,
mathematics appears linked inexorably with military technology. Said Dr.
Samuel Rankin, head of the mathematical sciences department at Worchester
Polytechnic Institute in Worchester, Mass.: "The further you go out into the
scientific and technological frontiers, especially in the kinds of things we
are seeing today, you are going to find mathematics."  </TEXT>
