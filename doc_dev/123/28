SHADOWS OF THE MIND by Roger Penrose Oxford University Press Pounds 19.99,
457 pages
One of the greatest mysteries facing science and philosophy is the
phenomenon of consciousness. How do three-dimensional technicolour pictures
arise inside our skulls? How do we explain the perception of scents and
sounds? How does the excitation of neurons result in belief, memory, reason?
Three centuries ago Rene Descartes declared that the problem was best solved
by being ignored, and there are some philosophers today who agree with him.
They argue that the supreme difficulty of the problem is a result of the
fact that the human mind just is not built to understand its own basis -
rather like the impossibility of an eyeball seeing itself. Fortunately the
pessimists are in the minority, and an exciting worldwide programme of
debate and research continues.
Roger Penrose, who is a professor of mathematics at Oxford, is one of the
leading contributors to that debate. In his previous and much applauded book
The Emperor's New Mind he attacked currently fashionable attempts to explain
consciousness by thinking of the brain as a computer, and argued instead
that something quite new is needed in science to give us the materials for
an explanation. In this book he tells us what that new something might be.
To attack the 'computational model' of mind is a significant matter, because
upon it turn two important related hopes. One is that we will one day build
computers powerful enough to be genuinely intelligent, and the other is that
the way to understand consciousness is to disentangle the enormous
complexity of the brain's billions of internal connections - a task of great
practical difficulty, but not in principle impossible.
Penrose argues that the computational model cannot explain consciousness,
and especially the all-important conscious phenomenon of 'understanding.'
The reason lies in the notion of 'computation' itself. As the term suggests,
computation is what computers do. It consists in the ordered running of
specified procedures, even in the case of 'bottom-up' systems which can
teach themselves and thus modify and evolve as they go along. In Penrose's
view, even the most sophisticated computational models cannot simulate
consciousness for the good reason that the latter has something
fundamentally non-computational about it. In the first part of his book he
explains what this means. In the second he tries to identify
non-computational features of the human brain's activity.
It is crucial for Penrose that 'non-computational' should not be taken to
denote something mystical or non-scientific. He believes that consciousness
can be understood by science - but that it will have to be an extended
science: one which includes new ways of thinking about the 'intermediate
level' between the microscopic world described by quantum physics, and the
everyday world of ordinary objects described by classical physics. This is
the topic of the book's second part, where Penrose explores new ways of
thinking about the connections between brain-cells - the synapses - the
proposal being that they behave in non-computational ways describable only
by laws intermediate between the quantum and classical levels.
There is a great deal of challenging mathematics and science in this book.
Penrose's argument against the computational model of mind turns on a
particular application of the famous theorem discovered in 1930 by the Czech
mathematician Kurt Godel, which proves that no set of rules for proving
propositions in some formal system can ever be sufficient to establish all
the true propositions of that system. Penrose takes Godel to have shown that
no set of proof-rules can ever prove all those propositions of, say,
arithmetic which humans can know to be true. From this it follows that
'there must be more to human thinking than can ever be achieved by a
computer.'
There is such a wealth of scientific, mathematical and philosophical ideas
in Penrose's book - all presented with extraordinary clarity, in a mixture
of straight discussion, fables, dialogues and diagrams - that debate about
the merits of its arguments promises to be extensive. But Penrose is
offering a genuine attempt to advance understanding of the complex questions
which surround consciousness, and even if his colleagues remain unpersuaded
by the more speculative arguments in physics and physiology in the book's
second part, there is much in the first part which those who favour the
computational approach are going to have to think about very hard indeed.
Whether or not one is persuaded by Penrose's arguments, reading them gives
one a highly absorbing education in much contemporary science and philosophy
at their sharpest cutting edges.
