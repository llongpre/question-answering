   Women are beginning to count more in
American mathematics, according to a University of Massachusetts
professor who says they earned nearly a quarter of all the math
doctorates in the last school year.
   ``It should dispel the notion once and for all that mathematics
is a man's game,'' said Professor Edward Connors, who conducts an
annual survey of the doctorates issued in the field for the
American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of
America.
   The new female doctorates, with median starting salaries of
$30,500, even made about $500 a year more than their male
classmates, Connors said.
   In 1987-88, about 21 percent of mathematics Ph.D.s went to
women, he said. In 1989 it was a little over 24 percent, with 313
men and 98 women earning doctorates in math.
   Connors said that the percentage rise was fueled both by
increasing numbers of women going on to graduate work in math and
the declining numbers of American men in the field.
   For the third straight year, U.S. colleges granted more
doctorates in math to foreign students than they did to American
citizens. Out of the 904 doctorates issued in the 1988-89 school
year, 46 percent went to U.S. citizens.
   That was slightly better than in the previous year's figure of
45 percent, but the number of doctorates earned by Americans has
been declining since the 1976-77 school year, when 76 percent of
the 901 issued went to U.S. citizens, according to the survey.
   Although women have made up about half of the bachelor's degrees
awarded in math for more than a decade, traditionally they have not
gone on to advanced degrees, he said.
   ``It's hard to understand, because the world of mathematics
doesn't have the artificial barriers to women and minorities of
some of the other physical sciences where much of the work is done
in research groups,'' Connors said. ``Mathematicians are by and
large a bunch of loners. And the rest of the world regards them all
_ men and women _ as sort of different. ''
   Betty M. Vetter, who conducts surveys on women and minorities in
the sciences for the American Association for the Advancement of
Science, said it's too soon to tell whether the 1989 statistics
signal a trend.
   However, she said the higher salaries that women mathematicians
received most likely were a glitch.
   ``The only field where women have been able to hold a slight
edge in salaries over men has been engineering and that's only at
the starting level,'' Ms. Vetter said. ``The real salary problems
occur later on, because women still do not have the same
opportunities for advancement as men.''
