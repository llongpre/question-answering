   There's a Matisse hanging in a Cambridge
subway station that has nothing to with fauvism, impressionism or
any of the other labels commonly associated with the name.
   Most Matisses appeal to the eye. The subway Matisse _ 16 massive
aluminum chimes and teak-tipped hammers suspended between the
tracks at the Kendall Square stop _ pleases the ear with a majestic
sound that comes when a handle from the platform is pulled.
   Henri Matisse is considered one of the most influential
20th-century artists. His boldy colored canvases that typify the
fauvist movement hang in famous galleries worldwide. Fauvism was a
French expressionist movement that involved such artists as
Matisse, Vlaminck and Derain and utilized strong, bold colors and
distorted forms.
   His grandson, Paul Matisse, is less famous. He doesn't paint,
but since setting up the chimes of ``Pythagoras'' last October, he
is cherished by hundreds of commuters who have left their scribbled
comments on a pad near the handle.
   ``I am getting a Proustian rush: Is this normal?'' reads one. A
less profound comment says simply: ``Radical move, Dude.''
   Others have viewed his functional mobiles at New York's Museum
of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the National
Gallery of Art in Washington; the Musee d`Art Moderne in Paris; the
Bienalle in Vienna; and at other U.S. and foreign galleries.
   Matisse, whose father, Pierre, is a well-known art dealer in New
York, lives and works in a former Baptist church in Groton _ a
sleepy town about 50 miles northwest of Boston _ with his wife,
artist Linda Hoffman, and their two children.
   He talked about himself and his grandfather during a recent
interview in his workshop _ a clutter of drill presses, lathes,
jigsaws and other tools he wields to create works that titillate
the imagination through movement, sight and sound.
   As a boy visiting Paris for summer holidays, Matisse sat
frequently for his grandfather and has recollections of him as ``a
terrifying presence.''
   ``When he looked at you to draw you, you were looked at,'' he
said. ``He was like a 50,000-watt search light.''
   Matisse bears some physical resemblance to his grandfather. He
now does not seem to suffer from the burden of living up to such a
famous heritage.
   It was not always so.
   ``What happens is in a lifetime you go through a whole series of
responses,'' he said with a chuckle. ``So you go through a negative
response. I've gone beyond that, and I feel a very positive
appreciation of the fact that he was back there.''
   But he is at pains to emphasize the obvious _ there is no
similarity between his works and that of his grandfather, who died
in 1954.
   ``When he drew a line, he drew a line he wanted to draw,'' he
said. ``He knew exactly what he wanted to do, and I remember him
telling me that his hand was his servant, and I don't work that way
at all.
   ``I have to draw (while drafting), so I do. But it's not so much
that, it's just that I don't have a great love of color and form,''
the 55-year-old artist said. ``I have a great love of ideas, which
is different entirely, and I think I'm much closer to Duchamp in
respect.''
   Matisse's kinship with Marcel Duchamp, the famed French artist
who began challenging traditional art concepts during the early
years of this century, goes beyond a love for the unusual. Duchamp,
who died in 1968, was Matisse's stepfather.
   Matisse, an acknowledged authority on Duchamp, referred several
times to one of his stepfather's most controversial works _ a
common urinal entitled ``Fountain,'' which shocked the art world of
his time. He hinted at a common bond in describing DuChamp as an
ideas man.
   ``I said Duchamp because Marcel rebelled against `painterly
art,''' he said, commenting on artistic influences. ``He wanted art
with intelligence.
   ``Duchamp said things like `bete comme un peintre' (stupid like
a painter). ``The influence I treasure from him is his point of
view.''
   While mentioning that Duchamp frequently expressed support of
his creations, Matisse emphasized that he is very much an
individual, personally and artistically.
   ``I am delighted that I was as close to him as I was,'' he said.
``But his character was very much his character and in no way does
mine reflect his.
   Although expressing reluctance to characterize his own art,
Matisse alluded to his creative philosophy in comments on
``Pythagoras.''
   ``The important part is to do whatever your spirit wants, and
... when you hang up a bell or tube, you do not get beautiful
sound,'' he said.
   ``I was able to do all that, so why should I be jealous of my
grandfather's ability to draw lines?''
