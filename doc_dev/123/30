   Millions of students interested in mathematics
have dropped out for other careers, a National Research Council
report said Tuesday in calling for renewed commitment to math
education.
   ``The attrition rate for students in the mathematical sciences
is 50 percent per year, the highest among all scientific fields,''
said the report, ``Renewing U.S. Mathematics: Critical Resources
for the Future.''
   ``Bright young people are discouraged from pursuing careers in
the mathematical sciences because they find their career prospects
are dim.''
   The report said there were about 3.6 million ninth grade
mathematics students in 1972. By the time they entered college as
freshmen in 1976, the number had dropped to 294,000. In 1980 11,000
won bachelor's degrees in mathematics; two years later 2,700
master's degrees were awarded and 400 doctorates were bestowed in
1986.
   ``Professors must show students that the mathematical sciences
offer both intellectual excitement and attractive career
prospects,'' said the report. ``Providing intellectual excitement
is the responsibility of the mathematical sciences community.
   ``To perceive attractive career prospects, students must see in
their own mathematics departments active, successful research
enterprises that involve graduate students, young faculty, and
senior researchers, all supported at levels competitive with those
in the other sciences and engineering.''
   A key recommendation of the report is that federal support of
mathematics education increase to $250 million annually from $133
million over the next three years.
   The report is a follow up to a 1984 study which called for $180
million a year. The committee that produced the report said that
inflation had pushed that amount to $225 million.
   The money should be used mostly to increase the numbers of
senior, junior and postdoctoral researchers and graduate research
assistants, the committee said.
   Edward David Jr., chairman of both the 1984 and the present
study committee, said that ``I think we would be much closer'' to
realizing the goal of President Bush and the nation's governors of
becoming first in math and science if all of the 1984 suggestions
had been carried out.
   ``The chances are very good'' that the new report will be fully
supported ``because of the attitude of the president, Congress and
the governors,'' said David. ``We got everybody on our side and
chances are very good.''
