<HEAD>Better Math Education, Plus Career Counseling Equals More Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Better education plus improved career
counseling is necessary to add to the pool of mathematically
skilled workers who will be needed in the United States by 2000,
the government said Tuesday.
   The National Research Council said the demand for scientists,
engineers and technicians by the turn of the century will exceed
the 1986 level by 36 percent _ nearly double the growth in overall
employment demand.
   Meanwhile, the council said, the college-age population is
expected to decrease 22 percent from 1981 to 1995. The number of
white male students, the traditional pool for scientists and
engineers, will shrink 34 percent.
   ``A Challenge of Numbers,'' the second council report on
mathematics, describes the gap between the projected supply and
demand and the challenge facing the nation's education system.
   The first report, ``Everybody Counts,'' studied trends and needs
in math education.
   Other reports later this year will evaluate post secondary math
curriculum; discuss resources available for math instruction; and
make recommendations on how to ``ensure a healthy flow of
mathematical talent'' into an increasingly technological work force.
   Among the statistics reported Tuesday by the council, an arm of
the National Academy of Sciences, were that:
   _By 1995, eight of the 10 fastest growing professions will be
based on science.
   _Skills in mathematics and a post secondary education will be
needed for a majority of the 21 million new jobs created by the
U.S. economy by 2000.
   _Math enrollments have doubled in the past 20 years, but
two-thirds of the enrollees have been in courses lower than
calculus.
   _The number of students receiving mathematics degrees, those who
could teach, was lower in 1986 than in 1966.
   _The percentage of college students studying math may drop as
the proportion of blacks and Hispanics, who have traditionally
studied math at a lower rate than the general population,
increases. The two groups comprised 22 percent of college students
in 1985; they are expected to account for 30 percent by 2010.
   _Women's interest in advanced mathematics has been low. White
women earn 17 percent of math doctorates compared with 70 percent
by their male counterparts.
   _Non-citizens comprise nearly half the graduate mathematics
population, even as the total number of doctorates awarded has
continued to fall.
   _Three-quarters of math graduates work outside academia, but no
one knows much about what they do. The lack of information ``dulls
the appeal of mathematics as a major and as a profession,'' the
study said.
