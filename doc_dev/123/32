   A Japanese mathematician's widely publicized
attempt to solve one of the most famous problems in mathematics
appears to have failed, a prominent American mathematician says.
   ``I think it's wrong,'' said Gerd Faltings of Princeton
University, who has examined a 20-page manuscript prepared by
Yoichi Miyaoka.
   Faltings, who has won the discipline's prestigious Fields Medal
for work related to the problem, said Monday he thought the error
was fundamental enough that the proposed solution would have to be
abandoned.
   The problem is to prove Fermat's Last Theorem, named for the
French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, who lived from 1601 to 1665.
   Fermat's theorum states that if X to the Nth power plus Y to the
Nth power equals Z to the Nth power, there is no solution for which
N is a whole number greater than two.
   ``Nth power'' means the accompanying number is multiplied by
itself N times. The theorem assumes that X, Y and Z are positive
whole numbers.
   Fermat wrote in the margin of a notebook that he had devised a
proof for his theorem, but it was never discovered. Coming up with
a proof has bedeviled mathematicians ever since.
   Miyaoka's proposed proof was widely reported earlier this month
after he presented it at West Germany's Max Planck Institute.
   ``It looked pretty good to start out with (but now) it looks
like the details are probably not going to go through,'' said Peter
Renz, associate director of the Mathematical Association of America.
   Still, ``it's a very good way to go at the problem'' and the
approach, based on geometric work by Soviet mathematician A.
Parshin, may still pay off, Renz said.
   Previous work has proven the theorum for cases in which N is
less than 150,000, he said. For higher values, no proof is yet
available.
   Faltings had expressed doubt about the new work in the March 30
issue of the Chronicle of Higher Education.
