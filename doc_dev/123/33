<TEXT>  By Robert Kanigel; Scribner's, 438 pp., $27.95.;  IT is a magic, tragic
ugly-duckling fable that Robert Kanigel tells in "The Man Who Knew Infinity":
the tale of a greatly gifted man born to a culture that doesn't understand
what the man is about.;    Still, his talent blossoms until news of it spreads
to the other side of the world, where he is eventually summoned by the masters
of his skill. The man goes among them and performs his magic. Skepticism gives
way to wonder. But away from home, the man grows lonely and ill. He returns to
his birthplace, only to die.;    The ugly duckling in question is Srinivasa
Ramanujan (pronounced rah-MAH-na-jun), the Indian clerk who in 1913 at the age
of 25 wrote a 10-page letter to G.H. Hardy, begging the eminent English
mathematician to consider some ideas Ramanujan had about numbers.;    A very
interesting number?;  The best-known anecdote about Ramanujan and Hardy stems
from an incident that happened six years later, long after Hardy, having
recognized the genius of Ramanujan's letter, had arranged for him to come to
England and study at Cambridge.;    One day, Hardy paid a call on Ramanujan
and commented with typical brusqueness that the number of the cab he had
taken, 1729, was "rather a dull number," adding that he hoped it wasn't a bad
omen.;    "No, Hardy," Ramanujan replied without missing a beat. "It is a very
interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two
cubes in two different ways." (The two sums of cubes are 12 to the third power
plus 1 to the third, and 10 to the third plus 9 to the third.) Such was
Ramanujan's intimacy with numbers.;    Kanigel, a journalist specializing in
science writing whose previous book was "Apprentice to Genius: The Making of a
Scientific Dynasty," conscientiously works to fill in all the details
surrounding this anecdote.;    He has apparently read every book that has
touched on Ramanujan and Hardy. He has traveled to England and India, and has
interviewed Ramanujan's widow, a woman in her 90s who married him by
arrangement when she was 9 years old.;    And he has exhaustively described
every building Ramanujan ever occupied, every tradition Ramanujan ever
encountered, every incident in which Ramanujan played even the tiniest role.; 
  Did World War I descend upon England while Ramanujan was there? Kanigel
expatiates on its causes. Did Ramanujan contract tuberculosis as a remotely
indirect result? Kanigel dilates on the bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
One senses that if his hero had worn a wristwatch, the author would have told
the history of Switzerland.;    When this technique works, the results are
enlightening. For instance, the book is as much a biography of Hardy as it is
of Ramanujan, and so we come to understand the revolution Hardy wrought by
insisting that English mathematicians offer formal proofs of theorems instead
of simply accepting them as tools, as was their habit.;    Thus his
collaboration with Hardy was ideal for Ramanujan, who, never having been
forced to develop proofs of his discoveries, was an ideal subject for Hardy's
discipline.;    More often, the results of Kanigel's exhaustiveness are mixed.
For instance, he tries to give the reader a taste of Ramanujan's mathematics,
which focused on such esoteric subjects as infinite series, prime numbers,
partitions (or ways of separating positive whole numbers into sums of positive
whole numbers) and approximations of the ratio pi.;    This is highly
commendable, particularly given the author's contention that Ramanujan's
intuitive gifts as a mathematician were connected to his devout religious
beliefs as a Brahman of the Vaishnava sect.;    But while one does get an
inkling of what Ramanujan was up to from the formulas that fill up some of
Kanigel's pages, they seem mostly impenetrable to an inexpert reader. And
Kanigel does not help matters when in the very first equation he analyzes he
refers to the right side as the left one and vice versa.;    Zeal for
anecdotes;  And too often, his endless amplification strikes one as mere
padding, as if his dramatic story could not speak for itself. He repeats so
many examples of Ramanujan's significance to posterity that he begins to sound
defensive, like certain ambivalent Indians who still take deep pride in their
compatriot's accomplishments yet simultaneously feel ashamed that their
culture did not recognize them.;    When in the heat of his enthusiasm Kanigel
writes such sentences as "In what, in some ways, was his greatest achievement,
then, Hardy brought Ramanujan mathematically up to speed without muzzling his
creativity or damping the fires of his enthusiasm," one is bound to believe
that the author has simply gone out of control.;    All the same, despite such
impediments, Ramanujan's remarkable story does come through, largely thanks to
the many pointed anecdotes Kanigel has swept up in his sometimes
indiscriminate zeal. When Ramanujan attended a lecture on elliptic integrals
shortly after his arrival at Cambridge, the lecturer, Arthur Berry, asked his
guest if he was able to follow. Ramanujan nodded.;    Did he care to add
anything? "At that," Kanigel writes, "Ramanujan stood, went to the blackboard,
took the chalk, and wrote down results Berry had not yet proved and which,
Berry concluded later, he could not have known before.";    This serves only
to confirm what Hardy said he believed in 1913 upon first looking at
Ramanujan's theorems, which, Hardy would write, "defeated me completely.";   
"I had never seen anything in the least like them before," he continued. "A
single look at them is enough to show that they could only be written down by
a mathematician of the highest class." Then in a typical flourish he
concluded, "They must have been true because, if they were not true, no one
would have the imagination to invent them."  </TEXT>
