   Mathematicians gathered here to
celebrate a century of advances that have benefitted fields ranging
from medicine to business and have seen American scientists rise to
the top of the discipline.
   ``When we talk about mathematics generally 100 years ago it was
a thriving enterprise,'' said Ronald Douglas, 49, dean of physical
science and mathematics at the University of New York at Stony
Brook. ``Even so whole new areas have been developed.''
   Douglas was one of about 1,300 mathematicians here for a
weeklong meeting that opened Monday to celebrate the centennial
anniversary of the American Mathematical Society.
   ``Geometricians who lived 100 years ago would not believe how
large the field has become,'' he said. ``It now interacts with all
of the sciences, with biology, with business, with medicine, with
economics. I think this would surprise people.''
   The computer alone has allowed mathematicians to solve problems
today that only existed in theory 20 or 30 years ago, he said.
   Douglas said the advances in mathematics in the United States
have been remarkable.
   ``Mathematics had a small number of American mathematicians _
all of them trained in Europe,'' said Douglas. ``Now American
mathematics is pre-eminent in the world, having the leadership in
many areas of mathematics. People come from all over the world to
study here. Europe is still important but the balance has shifted.''
   Mathematics will continue to move further into medicine and
biology, and new understandings in physics will allow
mathematicians to develop better machines and computers, he said.
   The society, originally named the New York Mathematical Society,
was formed in 1888 by a small group of mathematicians. It moved its
headquarters to Providence in 1951.
   This week's meeting is one of two the society holds each year in
conjunction with the Mathematical Society of America, society
spokeswoman Kathleen Holmay said.
   Speakers will address issues ranging from computer graphics to
the problems of attracting women to the field. Only about 15
percent of the society's 21,000 members are female, Ms. Holmay said.
   Of the 18 speakers at the conference, only one is a woman. Karen
K. Uhlenbeck, 46, a mathematics professor at the University of
Texas in Austin, will speak Friday on ``Instantons and their
Relatives.'' Instantons are geometric objects discovered by
physicists.
