   The United States is a hands-down loser when it
comes to mathematics education and needs major reforms, including
voluntary national standards, to upgrade math achievement, says a
report released Thursday.
   Three out of four U.S. students leave high school without
mastering enough mathematics to cope with either job demands or the
expectations of colleges, said the report by the National Research
Council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences and the National
Academy of Engineering.
   The report, ``Everybody Counts,'' says piecemeal local efforts to
correct the nation's math teaching deficiencies are ``totally
inadequate'' and calls for forward-looking national standards to be
adopted by local school systems.
   A recent surge of studies and books has raised concern over the
nation's mathematical skills, with another major study _ an
international survey of math and science performance _ due next week
from the Educational Testing Service.
   Thursday's report reflects the consensus of 70 teachers,
administrators, researchers, executives, parents and government
officials who spent three years studying math education from
kindergarten through graduate school.
   The council concludes that teaching must move away from
pencil-and-paper techniques and memorization toward realistic
problem-solving and early use of computers and calculators, which
the report said have had ``virtually no impact'' on instruction
despite their great potential to enrich it.
   The group said that teachers should be moderators, not lecturers
and that students should take math every year they are in school.
   The authors point to two approaches they say won't work:
   _The ``back to basics'' movement, favored by those who think of
math as an anchor in a sea of change. ``It isn't sufficient to
simply do better on traditional programs,'' Shirley Hill, chairman
of the Mathematical Sciences Education Board, told a news
conference. ``Math changes. The curriculum must keep up. We must be
contemporary.''
   _The ``top-down'' Japanese approach of enforcing a national,
grade-by-grade curriculum. While nations adopting such an approach
``have beaten us hands-down,'' the report said, the technique would
be impractical in the United States.
   The report sasy that ``new math'' was imposed from the top down
and fell flat because teachers and parents were not involved in the
process. The council suggests, instead, what it calls an augmented
grass roots approach _ voluntary, flexible standards with a broad
base of public support.
   A major step toward that goal is expected next month, when the
National Council of Teachers of Mathematics publishes ``Curriculum
and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics.'' The research
council called the upcoming study `the first effort ever to
establish national expectations for school mathematics'' and said
draft copies are already influencing textbook publishers and testing
organizations.
   In addition to low math achievement and a stagnant math
curriculum, the authors of ``Everybody Counts'' noted a number of
other problems:
   _The shortage of qualified math teachers is more serious than in
any other area of U.S. education and affects all levels from
elementary to graduate school. The shortage of minority math
teachers is particularly acute.
   _The conventional wisdom is that some people are just bad at
math. But in other industrialized nations, all students are expected
to master a level of math attained only by the best U.S. students.
The result is that U.S. firms are at a competitive disadvantage.
   _U.S. industry spends as much annually on remedial math education
as is spent on math education in schools, colleges and universities
combined.
