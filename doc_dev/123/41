   A new magazine published by three teachers'
groups will give American students the chance to puzzle over the
same math and physics problems that confound Soviet high school
students, the organizations announced Tuesday.
   The English-language magazine, called Quantum, is being
published by te National Science Teachers Association, the American
Association of Physics Teachers and the National Council of
Teachers of Mathematics in a joint effort with the Soviet Union's
Academy of Sciences.
   But Bill Aldridge, executive director of the NSTA, cautions that
Quantum is not for the average American student.
   ``It is aimed at students who are curious and want to solve
puzzles in physics and math,'' Aldridge said. ``It's aimed at the
very able student.''
   Most of the material in the first issue is based on articles and
problems that first appeared in Kvant, a popular Soviet magazine
for high school students.
   It includes problems in advanced geometry, algebra and in basic
physics, all presented in a lively, colorful way and applied to
actual objects and observations.
   There are also chess games and profiles of famous Soviet and
American scientists.
   ``The magazine has a little more life and is more connected to
what mathematicians really do,'' said William Thurston, a Princeton
University math professor who is the Quantum editor for
mathematics. He said the magazine will offer advanced problems in
math and physics that students normally would not confront in a
typical high school classroom.
   Aldridge said that Kvant carries articles and problems written
by top Soviet scientists and are designed to challenge Soviet
students.
   ``In the Soviet Union, ambitious parents subscribe for their
children, hoping that they can get them into the university,''
Aldridge said.
   Eventually, he said, it is hoped that American scientists will
contribute articles to Quantum that would later be translated for
use in Kvant.
   Aldridge said a computer and a laser printer, donated by the
Americans, have been installed in the Soviet offices of Kvant so
that articles can be transmitted by satellite to the Quantum
editorial offices in Washington.
   Aldridge said President Bush presented the first copy of Quantum
to Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev when the two met for their
shipboard summit in Malta.
   The first edition carries little advertising, and Aldridge said
it will take about three years for the magazine to reach the
break-even point economically. Until then, it is being supported by
a $366,000 National Science Foundation grant.
   The magazine will be published quarterly and the annual
subscription rate is $9.95.
