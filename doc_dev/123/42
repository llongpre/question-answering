There has been a chorus of warnings that the United States suffers from poor 
math and science teaching. Now America's largest scientific organization has 
come forward with a plan for reform. 
</P>
<P>
Declaring that "America has no more urgent priority," the American Assn. for 
the Advancement of Science envisions "sweeping changes" in the way Americans 
learn science and mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
A report, "Science for All Americans," to be released today in Washington, is 
the first phase of that effort. Prepared by the National Council on Science and 
Technology, which is sponsored by the science association, it lays out the kind 
of education Americans will need, at minimum, to live and work effectively in 
the 21st Century. Three other recent reports have already highlighted the 
education deficit.

"A World of Differences" by the Educational Testing Service assessed 24,000 
13-year-olds in six nations. It showed South Koreans leading in math skills, 
followed in order by Ireland, England, Canada and Spain, with the United States 
trailing. A University of Michigan survey of first- and fifth-graders in 
Chicago and Beijing found Americans doing significantly worse in math than 
Chinese students. 
</P>
<P>
The National Research Council, representing the National Academies of Science 
and Engineering, assessed American math education and found it seriously 
wanting. Its "Everybody Counts" report warned starkly: "Wake up, America! Your 
children are at risk." 
</P>
<P>
The National Council on Science and Technology said, "It will take a shared 
national vision of what Americans want their schools to achieve" to remedy this 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
That is what this new report is all about. In it, the 26 members of the 
National Council recommend a common education core on which to base curriculums 
from kindergarten through high school. They start by defining their educational 
goal of scientific literacy. It includes: 
</P>
<P>
* "Being familiar with the natural world and recognizing both its diversity and 
its unity. 
</P>
<P>
* "Understanding key concepts and principles of science. 
</P>
<P>
* "Being aware of some of the important ways in which science, mathematics and 
technology depend upon one another. 
</P>
<P>
* "Knowing that science, mathematics and technology are human enterprises and 
knowing what that implies about their strengths and limitations. 
</P>
<P>
* "Having a capacity for scientific ways of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
* "Using scientific knowledge and ways of thinking for individual and social 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
The council wants schools to teach old subjects in new ways that emphasize the 
connections rather than the boundaries between different areas of knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"Transformations of energy, for example, occur in physical, biological and 
technological systems, and evolutionary change appears in stars, organisms and 
societies," the report notes. 
</P>
<P>
It says science education should emphasize ideas and thinking skills at the 
expense of specialized vocabulary and memorized procedures. This echoes the 
National Research Council's views on math education. The National Research 
Council also gives priority to thinking skills and to grasping mathematical 
concepts that transcend computation, which is done mostly by machines. 
</P>
<P>
The new goal-defining report is the first phase of a long-term program called 
Project 2061. That's the year Halley's comet returns. The science association 
organized its National Council on Science and Technology in 1985, when the 
comet last appeared, and named the program in its honor. 
</P>
<P>
The program's second phase will develop experimental curriculums in selected 
school districts over the next few years. Project director F. James Rutherford 
said that San Antonio, San Diego and San Francisco districts have already 
agreed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
The final phase will be an effort extended over a decade or more to spread the 
new science and math education throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The American Assn. for the Advancement of Science is an umbrella group to which 
most American scientific and science education societies belong. Its 
geographically and professionally diverse membership is expected to help 
implement this program nationwide.
