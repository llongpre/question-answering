<LEADPARA>  NO WONDER so many people hate math.;    For too long, some educators say, math
teaching has followed a disastrous equation: Lectures plus drills plus
formulas plus meaningless calculations equal alienation, boredom and a deep

<TEXT>     "You could see the terror in peoples' eyes when you were teaching that
class," says Martin Hoffman, a remedial math instructor at Queens College in
New York. One of his students, a successful photographer, said he felt
physically sick whenever he drove past the college and was reminded how he had
flunked.;    "There's a lot of low self-esteem, even among math majors, about
mathematics," says JoAnne Growney, a mathematics professor at Bloomsburg
University in Pennsylvania.;    Real mathematics is full of creative joy
that's often missing from the classroom, says Julian Weissglass of the
Mathematical Sciences Education Board. Instead, lessons emphasize "being able
to reproduce what someone else has done, rather than thinking for yourself. It
disables (students) as thinkers in our society.";    But it doesn't have to be
that way. In a small but growing number of classrooms, from kindergarten to
college, things are changing.;    Teachers lecture less and listen more. They
don't just demand answers; they ask students to explain their reasoning.;   
Students tackle problems in small groups rather than struggling alone. They
learn from each other and discover they're not stupid.;    In these
classrooms, people spend a lot of time writing about math. They keep journals
charting their feelings about the course, explain concepts in their own words,
even critique the text and examinations.;    They read about the lives of
mathematicians and explore the long-neglected connections between math and
poetry, art and music.;    They carry out independent projects: Describing the
aerodynamics of airplanes. Pondering the symmetry of an M.C. Escher print.
Analyzing Bach. Deciphering codes. Figuring the odds in gambling.;    The
problems they solve are firmly linked to everyday life. There are no timed
tests; after all, real mathematicians don't work on deadlines. Speed is less
important than understanding.;    This is math without lectures or
multiple-choice, and it's slowly edging into the mainstream -- where, in some
cases, it is turning student attitudes around.;    "I hated math. My math
classes were boring," said Misty Hernandez, a freshman enrolled in an
experimental math program at Silver Creek High School in San Jose. "But in
this class, I started liking it. We work together -- we don't do everything
alone.";    "They teach you things you'll need in your life, like handling
money," said Joelda Mosqueda, also in the program. "It's fun.";    Silver
Creek is one of four Northern California high schools in the new program,
coordinated by Lawrence Hall of Science and San Francisco State University.;  
 In a typical day last week, students in Barbara Huesca's freshman math class
met in groups of four to figure out probability problems. Then each group
presented its solution to the class.;    The last class exam asked students to
figure out which of two telephone companies offered the cheapest service, and
then to write a letter describing what they'd learned so far.;    It makes for
a noisy, active, sometimes contentious classroom, and it's just the kind of
learning that math reformers are after.;    Their efforts are being
coordinated by the Mathematical Sciences Education Board, part of the
prestigious National Research Council in Washington, D.C. Its 1989 report on
the future of math education stressed that students learn best when they work
in small groups, freely discussing and debating their ideas.;    Taking the
lead;    In California -- considered one of the leading states in math reform
-- the Department of Education has been pushing group learning since 1985. Its
latest guidelines, now being drafted, recommend that students write about
mathematics and explain the thinking behind their solutions.;    These
guidelines are voluntary, and it's hard to determine how fast new ideas are
trickling into the classroom. In some schools, reform efforts are held up by a
lack of money to train teachers, said Joan Akers, a math consultant for the
state education department.;    And teachers at the leading edge of the reform
movement say they're sometimes frustrated. They meet with resistance from
colleagues, who prefer to teach as they were taught, and from students equally
uncomfortable with new approaches. But overall, they're enthused about
students' response.;    To nudge things along, the state is preparing a
powerful incentive in the form of new standardized tests.;    The changes
showed up three years ago in the California Assessment Program, or CAP, which
gauges the performance of the state's schools. For the first time, 12th
graders had to solve "open-ended" problems that require far more critical
thinking than calculation.;    CAP is now field-testing other alternatives to
the traditional multiple-choice, such as giving students problems to solve in
groups and evaluating portfolios of their work.;    Almost everyone agrees
that something has to change.;    Math is a gateway to careers in science and
engineering. Since women and minorities have traditionally done poorly in
mathematics, they have been excluded from those fields. Unless more students
are drawn into math, the country may suffer a critical shortage of scientists
and engineers in the next few decades.;    Math and science education in the
United States has been "disastrous," says Mary Beth Ruskai, a math professor
at the University of Lowell in Massachusetts. "What we have been doing has
simply not been working." The issue has become so important that President
Bush's proposed budget for 1992 includes a 37 percent increase in funds for
math and science education.;    College-level reform;  California State
University, Northridge, has been encouraging the no-lecture, group approach in
its remedial math program since 1978. It now reaches 2,000 students per year.;
   "I think most people think mathematics is a static collection of data, with
no history and no future -- just a bunch of formulas you memorize," said Elena
Marchisotto, an associate professor of mathematics there. "Some people equate
mathematics with balancing your checkbook.";    But after taking these
classes, "Their attitude is different," she said. "It gives the students
confidence where they didn't have it. The evaluations are extremely high,
considering how much the students hate taking these courses.";    And at
Charquin, an alternative elementary school in Hayward, teacher Bob Whitlow has
been having students work in groups, write about mathematics and put together
portfolios for more than 15 years.;    "It's neat. The kids just really like
math," Whitlow said. "There's a big difference between math and arithmetic.
You'll never see a child sitting down, working out problem after problem, like
you and I did when we were in school."  </TEXT>
