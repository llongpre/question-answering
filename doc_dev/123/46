Golden West College has captured its second grant this year from the National 
Science Foundation, bringing to $94,000 the foundation's awards to strengthen 
the mathematics department and the teaching of calculus, college officials said 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
The NSF last month approved $36,000 for a pilot project at the college aimed at 
developing computer programs to simulate complex mathematical concepts that can 
be difficult for students to conceptualize, Golden West spokeswoman Lori Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The mathematics department was awarded a $58,000 matching grant in May to buy 
computer software that will aid calculus and pre-calculus students in the 
classroom. Golden West's grants adviser Kathryn A. Crown said she has raised 
$10,000 in matching funds from the Educational Foundation of America. She is 
seeking another $45,000 in private grants to match the NSF award. 
</P>
<P>
Crown said it is rare for a community college to get any grants from the 
prestigious science agency and that it is a measure of the increasing national 
emphasis on early and higher quality science and mathematics instruction. 
</P>
<P>
"To get two National Science Foundation grants is a rather extraordinary 
event," Crown said. "Before, unless we had a nationally known instructor here, 
we wouldn't have been considered." 
</P>
<P>
But with fewer American students entering the science and mathematics fields, 
especially teachers who can produce the next generation of scientists and 
mathematicians, agencies such as the NSF are putting their funds behind 
programs aimed at increasing the pool of potential science majors. 
</P>
<P>
"(NSF officials) are beginning to realize that the majority of college students 
start in community colleges," Crown said. "Generally, the emphasis has been at 
the other end of the spectrum, in graduate research. Now, the emphasis is on 
getting qualified people to go into the sciences." 
</P>
<P>
The latest grant project to receive NSF funding goes to a team headed by Golden 
West mathematics professor David Horowitz. The team's goal is to use computer 
simulation to deal with such abstract concepts as linear equations and harmonic 
motions. 
</P>
<P>
The earlier grant goes to a team led by mathematics professor Jack Wadhams, who 
said the goal is to better prepare calculus students for mathematics and 
science courses at four-year colleges. KRISTINA LINDGREN
