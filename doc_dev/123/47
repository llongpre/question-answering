   Sen. Edward Kennedy turned actor Monday,
portraying a Harvard Square train station in an algebra lesson that
helped turn a U.S. Senate hearing into a lively variety show for
300 children.
   The young audience also met 4-foot robot, a Harvard scientist
who showed them a telescope that can be made for less than $1 and a
fifth-grade teacher who borrowed a real dinosaur skull for a
make-believe trip to the Western desert to study paleontology.
   The setting was a hearing to take testimony for a Senate bill
aimed at boosting education in math, science and technology.
   In a departure from the customary decorous exchange of testimony
and questions, the hearing was held in a theater at the Museum of
Science and included middle school youngsters from the Boston area.
Teachers with novel methods and program instructors deploying high
technology showed how they inspire enthusiasm among children in
science and math.
   The need for enthusiasm is dire.
   According to figures gathered by the Labor and Human Resources
Committee about the 24,000 U.S. high schools, 7,000 offer no
physics course; 4,000 offer no chemistry and 2,000 offer not a
single biology course.
   Among the nation's elementary and high school science teachers a
full 60,000 are unqualified to teach that subject.
   Half the faculty jobs in U.S. graduate schools of engineering
are held by foreigners because of a dearth of American engineering
teachers.
   Yet it is projected that by the year 2006, America will be short
675,000 scientists and engineers, and by 2000 industry will be
short 2 million technicians.
   Just 10 years from now the country will need 300,000 more
science teachers.
   Kennedy and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Utah, are cosponsors of the
Excellence in Math, Science and Engineering Education Act, which is
now before Kennedy's Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee.
   The bill sets out a 10-year schedule of appropriations, starting
with $125 million for improving and monitoring science and math
education. It would direct more attention as well to technological
training in industry and to bringing more women and minorities into
the field.
   The Labor committee is expected to vote on the bill soon and, if
it passes muster, send it to the Senate floor this summer.
   Among the presentations at the hearing was the algebra lesson
invented by Boston teacher Robert Moses. It translates the
abstractions of A plus B equals C into reality.
   Moses enlisted Kennedy along with nine students to stand in
front of the auditorium to represent train stops on the Red Line
subway route connecting Boston and Cambridge.
   Three children played the train, chug-chugging between the
stations. Such lessons, conducted over time and interspersed with
trips on real trains, are used to teach children the concept that a
variable like ``x'' or ``y'' can, in algebra, stand for a real
number. The also help relate math to real life.
   The problem may go even deeper than the need to make math and
science more relevant, however.
   Jane Holdsworth of The Thames Science Center in New London,
Conn., told Kennedy that while wheeling in her robot to make her
presentation, a little girl asked her if the robot bites.
   ``I hope we're getting to the day when we know that robots don't
bite,'' Holdsworth said. ``And that math and science don't bite.
They're fun.''
