JACK SMITH: DEMOLISHING DECONSTRUCTION BRINGS MORE DEBATE

<TEXT>
<P>
I continue to be chastised for questioning the validity and value of a vogue 
form of literary criticism known as deconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
I do not understand deconstruction, as I admitted; but I infer, from what I 
have read, that it reduces texts to ambiguity or meaninglessness. In the end, 
the word is master of the man. 
</P>
<P>
It was born in France, but now seems to be entrenched in American higher 
education, especially at UC Irvine and Occidental College. 
</P>
<P>
I have already quoted John Rowe, of the Critical Theory Institute at Irvine, 
who complained that as a journalist I am no more able to understand 
deconstruction than to understand atomic physics or perform laser surgery. 
Quite correct. 
</P>
<P>
Similar complaints, though more acerbic, have come from Michael R. Near, 
assistant professor of English, and Daniel D. Fineman, associate professor of 
English and comparative literary studies, both of Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
Having had my say, I owe my critics a hearing. I hope my necessarily brief 
summaries reflect fairly the tone and content of their protests. 
</P>
<P>
Near's is long and detailed. First, he says that my ignorance makes it hard to 
take me seriously. But he notes that I would not scorn an astrophysicist 
because he could not explain his work to me in a few simple words. "I am 
therefore curious that you would feel no compunction about leveling your scorn 
at language specialists who could not reduce to a few simple terms the 
intricacies of deconstruction." 
</P>
<P>
He said my column was "childish, intellectually irresponsible, and 
ideologically dangerous," and perpetuated "the long anti-intellectual tradition 
that values the obvious and eschews the difficult enterprise of critical 
thinking. . . . And you do it in such an engaging style that we can barely 
detect the ideological rot that serves as the foundation for your discussion. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
(That's not as bad as comparing me to Hitler and Stalin, as another critic 
did.) 
</P>
<P>
Prof. Fineman, like Near and Rowe, said that I simply do not have the education 
to understand deconstruction. He notes that he has spent 15 years trying to 
read Jacques Derrida, its high priest. "His work is very difficult because it 
relies on an in-depth knowledge of Western philosophy from Parmenides to 
Husserl, a set of theoretical gambits that are at odds with those implicit in 
this same Western culture, a use of language that is intentionally metaphoric, 
and no desire to lower his rhetorical or discursive 'level' to please an 
audience which has not done its 'homework.' " 
</P>
<P>
As if that were not enough to shut me out, he notes that deconstruction can be 
thought of as "a humanistic replication of Kurt Godel's Incompleteness Theorem 
of 1931." (I admit I am not familiar with that theorem.) 
</P>
<P>
"Now Godel was one of the great mathematicians of the 20th Century, and his 
work in foundations and meta-mathematics is universally respected by those who 
can understand it. Nonetheless, I suspect that if you 'knock at (his) door,' 
you will also find no one who speaks your particularly impoverished version of 
English." 
</P>
<P>
I admit my ignorance. I am even more ignorant than the person who wrote the 
following plaintive letter, asking to remain anonymous: 
</P>
<P>
"Your essay was a shot in the arm. I am a candidate for an M.A. in English. For 
several years now, I have been struggling to understand deconstruction. As of 
today, I still haven't a clue as to what it is about. I have been made to feel 
inadequate by certain . . . professors because I wasn't able to gush over this 
new phenomenon or use its jargon. . . . I am a humble high school English 
teacher. The flatulent, self-conscious and pompous deconstruction essays are 
the very antithesis of what I have been teaching my students about writing. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
And this one, also anonymous, from a graduate student in the humanities at UCI, 
where Derrida is in residence: 
</P>
<P>
"As a rule, the faculty worships the ground (Derrida) walks on. Your article . 
. . only expresses the tip of the iceberg. The real tragedy is the salaries, 
perks, grad student favors, secretarial help and free conference time that 
these tenured 'researchers' receive while 27 million Americans are illiterate. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
Have the deconstructionists improved the writing of one novelist or poet, or 
made literature any more readable? Does anyone outside the rarefied air of 
their ivory towers have the slightest idea what they're talking about? 
</P>
<P>
True, I don't understand the physicists either, but at least they gave us the 
atom bomb.
