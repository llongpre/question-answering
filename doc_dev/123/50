promising playwright

KAREN HOPE'S new play opens with such a burst or repetitive swearing that it
seems like a throwback to the 1980s. That may be an act of deliberate
symbolism, for suddenly a character enters declaring that there are enough
words in the English language to make swearing unnecessary. Then the effing
more or less stops and we may have entered new ground.
Ripping is a cerebral play, full of ambiguities, but it is not
clever-clever. It does not draw on Harold Pinter, nor anyone else who
immediately comes to mind. Like all good plays, it is physical as well as
verbal. It is also almost frighteningly sane.
It stems from a good idea, not far away from facts. Ripping makes an analogy
between mind-building and body-building. A child prodigy goes up to
Cambridge to read advancedmathematics. She is so young that she has to be
accompanied by her father whose maths she is rapidly outstripping.
The pair of them lodge in a place where there is a not dissimilar menage. A
rather older girl has been a champion swimmer: some of her records are still
unbeaten. In her twenties she has moved onto body-building with a coach who
is also her lover.
The play revolves around the interchanges between these two couples. Tom
Stoppard, who has toyed with mathematics and the sciences in Arcadia, ought
to look to his laurels. For Ripping is also about the application of maths
to biology and the other way round, and it is very convincingly done. The
young mathematician is fascinated by the development of the older girl's
muscles and physical movements. The body-builder coach is a scientist of a
kind as well: he has learned a lot from studying mushrooms.
But this is not an abstract piece. The play works on a level of almost total
realism. The dialogue is in the vernacular, loud music occasionally
interspersing the talk. Apart from the mind and body-building analogy, there
is a sub-theme. Both girls have been pushed into their ambitious positions
by their respective fathers. Laura, the mathematician played by Lindsey
Wilson, has her father still around and fussing. Melanie, the athlete, was
encouraged to take body-building drugs by a father now absent but who still
turns up at her contests.
Only four characters appear in the play: the two girls, Laura's father and
Melanie's coach. All become entangled with each other, though how far is
left ambiguous. The one possible character weakness in the writing is
Anthony, the father of Laura. It is not clear how much he responds, or wants
to, to Melanie's sexual advances, nor whether he remotely understands the
maths in which he is driving his daughter.
For the rest, however, this is a remarkably vibrant play, beautifully done
and precisely directed by Jessica Dromgoole. The Cockpit is a good place to
do it because the theatre in the round is exactly right for the various
contests. (The National's Cottesloe Theatre would be another.) As Melanie,
Victoria Harwood looks at times like a graceful female Atlas, and can then
movingly crack up.
The ultimate tribute is to Ms Hope whose Foreign Lands was performed at the
Finborough early this year. If she goes on like this, we may have a
playwright for the 1990s after all.
