<LEADPARA>  LAST WEEK I WITNESSED a chilling example of what U.S. Secretary of Education
Arthur A. Tuberman was referring to in a recent speech when he said that, in
terms of basic mathematics skills, the United States has become, and I quote,
"a nation of stupids.";    This incident occurred when my son and I were
standing in line at Toys "R" Us, which is what we do for father-son bonding
because it involves less screaming than Little League. Our immediate goal was
to purchase an item that my son really needed, called the Intruder Alert. This
is a battery-operated Surveillance Device that can be placed at strategic
locations around the house; it makes an irritating electronic shriek when you,
the intruder, walk past. This important technological breakthrough enables the
child to get on your nerves even when he is not home.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The woman ahead of us wanted to buy four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle
drinks, which come in those little cardboard drink boxes that adults cannot
operate without dribbling on themselves, but which small children can
instinctively transform into either drinking containers or squirt guns. The
Toys "R" Us price was three drinks for 99 cents, but the woman wanted to buy
four drinks. So the mathematical problem was: How much should the cashier
charge for the fourth box?;    Talk about your brain teasers! The cashier
tried staring intently at the fourth box for a while, as if maybe one of the
Ninja Turtles would suddenly blurt out the answer, but that didn't work. Then
she got on the horn and talked to somebody in Management "R" Us, but that
person didn't know the answer, either. So the cashier made another phone call,
and then another. By now I assumed she was talking to somebody in the highest
echelon of the vast Toys "R" Us empire, some wealthy toy executive out on his
giant yacht, which is powered by 176,485 "D" cell batteries (not included).;  
 Finally the cashier got the word: The fourth box should cost -- I am not
making this up -- 29 cents.;    This is of course ridiculous. As anyone with a
basic grasp of mathematics can tell you, if three drinks cost 99 cents, then a
fourth drink would cost, let's see, four boxes, divided by 99 cents, carry
your six over here and put it on the dividend, and your answer is. . . . OK,
your answer is definitely not 29 cents.;    And this is not an isolated
incident of America's mathematical boneheadism. In a recent study done by the
American Association of Recent Studies, 74 percent of U.S. high-school
students -- nearly half -- were unable to solve the following problem:;   
"While traveling to their high-school graduation ceremony, Bill and Bob decide
to fill their undershorts with Cheez Whiz. If Bill wears a size 32 brief and
Bob wears a 40, and Cheez Whiz comes in an eight-ounce jar, how many times do
you think these boys will have to repeat their senior year?";    Here is the
ironic thing: America produces "smart" bombs, while Europe and Japan do not;
yet our young people don't know the answers to test questions that are child's
play for European and Japanese students. What should be done about this? The
American Council of Mathematicians, after a lengthy study of this problem,
recently proposed the following solution: "We tell Europe and Japan to give us
the test answers, and if they don't, we drop the bombs on them.";    Ha ha!
Those mathematicians! Still bitter about not having prom dates! Seriously,
though, this nation is a far cry from the America of the 1950s, when I was a
student and we were No. 1 in math and science, constantly astounding the world
with technical innovations such as color television, crunchy peanut butter and
Sputnik. What was our secret? How did we learn so much?;    The answer is
that, back then, math was taught by what professional educators refer to as:
The Noogie Method. At least this was the method used by Mr. O'Regan, a large
man who taught me the times tables. Mr. O'Regan would stand directly behind
you and yell: "Nine times seven!" And if you didn't state the answer
immediately, Mr. O'Regan would give you a noogie. You can easily identify us
former O'Regan students, because we have dents in our skulls large enough for
chipmunks to nest in. Some of us also have facial tics: These were caused by
algebra, which was taught by Mr. Schofield, using the Thrown Blackboard Eraser
Method. But the point is that these systems worked: To this day, I can
instantly remember that nine times seven is around 50.;    It's good that I
remember my math training, because I can help my son with his homework. He'll
be sitting at the kitchen table, slaving over one of those horrible pages full
of long-division problems, having trouble, and I'll say: "You know, Robert,
this may seem difficult and boring now, but you're learning a skill that
you'll probably never use again." If more parents would take the time to show
this kind of concern, we Americans could "stand tall" again, instead of being
a lazy, sloppy nation where -- prepare to be shocked -- some newspaper
columnists, rather than doing research, will simply make up the name of the
secretary of education.  </TEXT>
