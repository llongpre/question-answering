   He was an architect and a hospital porter, an
aeronautical engineer and a sculptor, a decorated soldier and a
monastery gardener.
   Ludwig Wittgenstein also was one of the century's greatest
philosophers, and today, on the centennial of his birth, his memory
is being celebrated at Cambridge University, where he was professor
of philosophy.
   Wittgenstein conferences are taking place in Austria and other
countries, while in Britain, where Wittgenstein became a
naturalized subject in 1938, the highlight is today's concert at
Trinity College, Cambridge.
   ``We will have some Bruckner, Brahms and Schubert, and also
something by Josef Labor, an obscure composer, but Wittgenstein
liked him,'' said Nicholas Denyer, a teaching fellow in philosophy
at Trinity.
   Wittgenstein's complex theories of language, thought patterns
and logic led to the conclusion that everything that mattered most
could not be put into words.
   ``He is regarded as difficult to understand,'' says Denyer.
``His ideas are of such interest that they have attracted more
commentaries and expository works than most 20th-century
philosophers. He remains a controversial figure, and a lot of
issues he opened up in his later work are still being explored.''
   Wittgenstein was born in Vienna on April 26, 1889, and spent his
last 22 years at Cambridge. Three of his four brothers committed
suicide, and he lived on the edge of madness and suicide until
cancer killed him in 1951, at age 62.
   ``He was extraordinary,'' said Christopher Sykes, a film
producer who explored Wittgenstein's life in a film broadcast by
the BBC last week.
   ``He was a pretty good architect, an aeronautical engineer who
invented a jet system not long after the Wright brothers first
flew, a logician and philosopher of amazing talent, a fearless and
multidecorated soldier in World War I, a village schoolmaster, a
monastery gardener's assistant, a sculptor, hospital porter in
World War II and Cambridge professor,'' Sykes said in an interview.
   ``People who knew Wittgenstein described him as good looking,
striking, not very tall, with deep hyacinth-blue eyes, of military
bearing, aristocratic,'' he said.
   Most of Wittgenstein's only book published during his lifetime,
``Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,'' was written under fire on the
eastern front and completed in an Italian prisoner-of-war camp. It
proposed the idea of a logically perfect or ideal language, the
prototype of which he saw in mathematical logic.
   Seven other works were published after his death.
   His mentor, the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, said that
when he read the first sentence a Wittgenstein essay, ``I became
persuaded that he was a man of genius.''
   Wittgenstein was not really at home in the 20th century.
   ``Wittgenstein never married,'' said Sykes. ``He liked solitude,
in a log cabin he built in Norway, in a hut in Galway on the west
coast of Ireland and on the Gower Peninsula in Wales.''
   ``He liked detective stories and the cinema, especially
Westerns. He always sat in the front row so there would be nothing
in his field of vision except the screen, to try to free his mind
of the philosophical questions that troubled him.''
