   A high school student from Little Rock, Ark.
who analyzed a 1,500-year-old mathematical equation was named the
winner Monday of the national Westinghouse Science Talent Search.
   Christopher McLean Skinner, 16, a student at Hall High School in
Little Rock, was the top award winner in the 48th annual
Westinghouse contest. He won over 1,461 other entrants and will
receive a $20,000, unrestricted science scholarship.
   Skinner's winning project was an analysis of a math equation
named for Diophantus, a fourth century mathematician.
   The second place winner in the Westinghouse competition was
Jordan S. Ellenberg, 17, of Potomac, Md., who also entered a math
project. Richard H. Christie, 15, of Penfield, N.Y. won third place
for a project on the nervous and immune systems.
   Both Ellenberg and Christie will receive $15,000 scholarships.
   The three were selected top winners from among 40 finalists in
the national contest. The finalists came to Washington last week for
a judging that involved displaying their projects and then
undergoing interviews by a panel of eight scientists who evaluated
the creativity and potential of each entrant.
   Other winners and their scholarship awards are:
   4. Stacy E. Benjamin, 16, Cambria Heights, N.Y., $10,000.
   5. S. Celeste Posey, 17, Cary, N.C., $10,000.
   6. Allene M. Whitney, 17, Helena, Mont., $10,000.
   7. Keven N. Heller, 17, Dix Hills, N.Y. $7,500.
   8. Andrew W. Jackson, 18, Medfield, Mass., $7,500.
   9. Andrew J. Gerber, 16, Brooklyn, N.Y., $7,500.
   10. Divya Chander, 17, River Vale, N.J., $7,500.
   Each of the other 30 national finalists will receive scholarship
awards of $1,000.
   The Westinghouse Science Talent Search was started in 1942 and is
the oldest national high school science competition in the U.S.
