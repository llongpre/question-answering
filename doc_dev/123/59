   Charles Sanders Peirce, an irritable
genius who invented the ``I'll-believe-it-when-I-see-it'' philosophy
called pragmatism, was born 150 years ago Sunday. Yet the
appreciation of his wide-ranging mind has only begun, say scholars
who gathered to study his work.
   ``There's a tremendous story to be told,'' said Professor Kenneth
Ketner of Texas Tech University, co-host of the Charles Sanders
Peirce Sesquicentennial International Congress that wound up this
weekend at Harvard University, Peirce's alma mater. ``We're talking
about one of the great geniuses of all time.''
   A prolific writer, inspired scientist and daring philospher,
Peirce didn't stop at pragmatism. He also thought up semiotics,
devised modern symbolic logic _ the mathematical system that
underpins the computer _ and determined, long before this
mechanistic age, that treating people like machines won't work.
   Peirce delved into the history of science, astronomy, physics and
metaphysics. Evolution, psychology and the reality of God all
entertained his roving mind.
   It helps to have a dictionary handy when considering Peirce.
Pragmatism, for example, is the philosophy that determines the
meaning and truth of ideas and tests their validity by their
practical results. In other words, it ties ideas to action. ``Let us
not pretend to doubt in philosophy what we do not doubt in our
hearts,'' he wrote.
   Semiotics is a general theory about signs and symbols and how
they relate to communication.
   Peirce knew how hard he was to understand. He once confided to
his friend, promoter and fellow pragmatist, William James, that he
felt like ``a snarl of twine.''
   In college courses, James usually gets the credit for pragmatism;
Peirce is just a footnote. But Ketner says that even James referred
to his chum as the founder of the philosophy James made famous.
   Ketner was among more than 400 scholars from a dozen countries,
including China, Japan, West Germany and Brazil, who attended the
Harvard congress.
   ``Peirce for a long time was undervalued as the greatest American
philosopher,'' said Umberto Eco, the best-selling Italian novelist
who teaches philosophy at the University of Bologna. He ranks Peirce
among the two or three greatest thinkers of his time.
   ``He was American-born but he was a universal mind,'' said Eco,
who like all Peirce fans correctly pronounces the name ``purse.''
   Harvard was more than Peirce's alma mater. He grew up there.
   The son of the famed Harvard mathematician Benjamin Peirce, he
was raised in a house in Harvard Yard, where he began to study logic
and reasoning at age 12 and was trained in math and science by the
time he entered Harvard at 16.
   The younger Peirce made his living as a mathematical physicist
for the government and was well-known in his day for his scientific
ventures. He devised a way to chart the shape of the Earth and
pioneered the use of light waves to measure lengths. He tried to
measure the Milky Way, went around the world gauging gravity and
explored zoology.
   While he was little known by the public, he was elected to the
American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of
Sciences and the London Mathematical Society.
   Overbearing but overly sensitive, his difficult personality was
forgiven by friends like James. But his efforts to enter academia
failed badly. He was fired from a part-time job teaching logic at
Johns Hopkins University when it was discovered he was living with a
woman while not yet divorced from his first wife.
   Peirce's only outlets then were such publications as The Nation
and obscure scientific journals. But he wrote down his ideas daily,
and after his death at age 75 in 1914 on a farm in Milford, Penn.,
his widow gave his papers to Harvard. The first collection of
Peirce's philosophical writings was published in the 1930s. More is
in the offing, and even now scholars continue to come up with new
intellectual gems.
   Enthusiasm worldwide for Peirce can be attributed to curiosity
about America and American thought, his ideas' ready applicability
to modern technology and contemporary philosophy, and the universal
context in which he worked, said Israel Scheffler, a Harvard
professor of philosophy and education.
   ``The substance of Peirce's thoughts have not been fully
plumbed,'' Scheffler said.
