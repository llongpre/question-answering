FT  30 MAR 92 / Observer: High class
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In essence, Observer has only one thing to say to readers who tackled last
Monday's numeracy-style questions. It is: 'Go to the top of the class]'
After all, any candidate who got 82.8 per cent of the total marks available
in a test would be considered to have done very well. But that was merely
the average score of the 151 of you who entered the quiz.
The questions, with the answers in italics, were:
1 What is the conventional name for the result of dividing the circumference
of a circle by its diameter? Pi.
2 What is 12 1/2 per cent of 60 per cent? 7 1/2 per cent.
3 If 93 folk enter a knock-out singles tournament at tennis, how many
matches are needed before one player emerges as overall winner? 92.
4 In the A1, A2, A3 . . . series of paper-sizes, what mathematical
relationship does the length of each sheet's longer side bear to the length
of its shorter side? When the shorter side is designated as 1, the longer is
the square root of 2.
5 Name the ancient philosopher specifically associated with the theorem that
sheds light on question 4. Pythagoras.
6 What - apart from the fact that no other number is the same as it - is
unique about the number 1,729? It is the smallest number that can be formed
from the sum of two cubes in two different ways (13x123=1,729;
103x93=1,729).
7 Name the unusual mathematician who saw the answer to 6 instantly.
Ramanujan.
As Observer reported last Thursday, 62 of you produced perfect answers
within the time limit, so necessitating a tie-breaker to find the winner of
the bottle of malt whisky.
As threatened, it is a stinker calling for knowledge both of numerate and of
literary culture. It has two parts.
The focus is the ancient problem: Which number when added to one seventh of
itself equals 19? It is easily solved by algebra which allows a
non-numerical 'place-holder', such as x, to stand for the initially unknown
number constituting the answer - for example, x + x/7 = 19.
But algebra is a relatively recent method which was scarcely known in
England, at least, until the mid-16th century. Before then, there was no
facility for using unknown place-holders, and such problems had to be solved
by calculating solely with whole numbers and fractions (as distinct from
decimals), the preferred method being called 'The way of falsehood.' Now to
the question:
A Show how the problem could be worked out by such a pre-algebraic method.
B Which 16th-17th century English poet hinted that he understood the then
new algebra, and in which poem?
All entries welcome, but only the previous 62 timely and all-correct
entrants will be in line for the prize. Answers by fax to Observer on
071-873 3926 or 071-873 3196 by 6pm London time tomorrow, or by mail
postmarked the same day.
