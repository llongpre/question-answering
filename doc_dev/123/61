VISIONS OF THE MODERN by John Golding Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 28,368 pages
What in art is modern now? It is unlikely that in the last decade of the
Quattrocento, with the Italian Renaissance half done, educated Florentines
still spoke in awe of Masaccio, Donatello and Fra Angelico as modern, yet in
the last decade of this century, John Golding, distinguished art historian,
curator of exhibitions and a painter of sorts, offers us as modern, Picasso,
Matisse, Braque, more Picasso, Duchamp, Gorky, Malevitch, Brancusi and more
Picasso still, all firmly rooted in the first decade. Readers hoping for a
helping hand with Damien Hirst and Rachel Whiteread will find none offered
here.
Only with Frank Stella and himself does Golding venture into the present day
 -but Stella he treats exclusively as a fellow lecturer and writer, and of
Golding the painter of flaccid abstracts of footnote inconsequence, we must
ask how it is that, revealing so sharp an eye and such honest judgment in
his discussion of the old masters of this century, he can be so blind to the
poverty of his own paintings, daubs that seem merely private therapy for a
man far better employed in intellectual pursuits.
For 40 years Golding has steeped himself in the study of Picasso. The
obsession began with his doctoral thesis on Cubism, and its present
incarnation is the exhibition at the Tate Gallery; its rich fruit is a
scholarly and intuitive knowledge not only of all the artists involved with
Picasso - Braque, Leger et al - or with whom he was in rivalry - Matisse -
but of the critics and apologists who offered him support, of Tsara, Eluard
and Apollinaire. The first essay in the book is indeed on Apollinaire, the
wise, witty and misguided mountebank and showman of Parisian criticism until
his death in 1918, whom Golding accuses of inventing 'the sort of
pseudo-metaphysical jargon that is found all too frequently in writings
about present day art.'
Golding cannot himself be accused of jargon; he writes with utter clarity,
and only a scholar of transparent honesty could observe of Cubist pictures
after a lifetime's work that 'I have come increasingly to realise that I do
not really understand them, and I am not sure that anyone else does either,'
which tempts the sceptic to quote Sickert - 'Painting that requires literary
explanation stands self-condemned. Here we have the condemnation of Matisse
and Picasso, and even of most of Cezanne's canvases.'
Golding may protest inadequacy, but his commentaries on the parallels
between Braque and Picasso in their Cubist years, on the great 'Demoiselles
d'Avignon', on the flowering of Gris and Leger, are passionate in their
sympathy, and illuminate with such uncanny clarity that ordinary mortals may
well feel that they at last understand, even if their mentor does not.
By far the longest essay is devoted to Duchamp, keyed to his mysterious,
unfinished and shattered work on glass, 'The Bride stripped bare by her
Bachelors', damaged in transit in 1926. Amid dense argument, Golding admits
to unanswerable questions and a labyrinth of ideas from which no thread
leads; 'there is no solution, because there is no problem,' claimed Duchamp
 -but there is a problem, and in failing to arrive at its solution, Golding
surveys the whole work of the old mischief-maker, from Mr Mutt's upturned
urinal to the almost posthumous tableau mort of the naked waxwork woman with
her legs spread wide, seeing a cerebral kinship in the wild diversity of
style.
Golding writes at a still slower pace and with emotion cooled when he treats
of Gorky, Malevitch and Brancusi, as though the material has been prepared
for tutorials and has adapted uneasily into literary prose - even the death
of Brancusi's beloved bitch brings scarcely a spark of life to that essay,
and the plodding art historian swamps the connoisseur. Though they are not
without merit, the inclusion of such lectures and reviews (if these are
indeed what they are) blurs the focus of the book, and at the very end it is
blurred still further by the vain inclusion of himself as painter, keeping
company far too distinguished. Golding's eye is at its brightest and his pen
most passionate when Picasso is his inspiration.
