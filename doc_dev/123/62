<LEADPARA>  Physics is fun. And you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand it.;
  It's this philosophy that Palo Alto High School teacher Andria Erzberger
brings to the classroom and which has won her recognition as a state finalist
in the Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and Mathematics program.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Erzberger and Sunnyvale teacher Wally Crichton were among the dozen
California math and science teachers honored this summer. They're now in the
running for the national-level Presidential Awards, which will be announced
today and go to four teachers in each state.;   The state winners get a
certificate. Presidential winners get $7,500 to be spent in their school
district and materials and other goodies donated by corporations. They also go
to Washington, D.C., for a week, to be feted and to attend workshops.;   The
Presidential Awards, a White House program funded by the National Science
Foundation, aim to "stimulate growth and creativity" in teaching and to
recognize excellent teachers "who are staying in the classroom," said program
coordinator Mary Lynn Ernstthal. Applicants must have taught math or science
for five years and must submit recommendation letters and lesson plans and
answer essay questions.;   Erzberger has written software explaining particle
physics, is helping edit a textbook and helped draft a wall chart on the parts
of the atom, which is marketed commercially. She also advises San Jose State
University students working on laser projects.;   The 25-year veteran teacher,
who has master's degrees in physics and mathematics, also teaches other
teachers. Only about a third of those teaching physics have a background in
physics. The rest are math, biology or other teachers who, in times of slim
school budgets, are drafted to teach physics, she said.;   At Palo Alto High,
95 percent of the students take physics. Nationwide, only 19 percent of high
school students do so, Erzberger said. She said the Palo Alto students are
motivated and college-bound, and the school has physics classes of different
levels. "In many places, physics is kept as kind of a secret thing -- only if
you're really good in math, can you take it," she said.;   Erzberger was
recognized for her ability to relay inertia, Newton's laws, density and other
concepts to students. "(Physics) relates to everyday life, driving a car, the
sports you do," she said. "It's fun.";   Sunnyvale's Crichton, a fifth-grade
teacher, led pupils in launching recycling at Columbia Community School. He
also coordinated the students in lobbying the Sunnyvale School District to ban
polystyrene lunch trays. The campaign has been unsuccessful so far, but the
students are plotting other tactics, he said.;   Crichton, 57, has been
teaching about 35 years -- he says he's not sure, he's lost track.;   As a
mentor teacher in science and technology, Crichton has worked on focusing the
science curriculum on ideas rather than facts. "We don't study flies and
dinosaurs," but "big ideas: energy, drive, matter."  </TEXT>
