   An expedition leader said Friday that
archaeologists in Egypt have dug up what may prove to be the
earliest complete versions of three classical Greek texts, at least
one of them by Aristotle.
   Professor Anthony J. Mills said his Canadian team found two
books dating from the late third century A.D., one literary and one
containing farm accounts, while excavating the remains of the
post-Hellenic town of Isment in the Dakhla Oasis in central Egypt.
   The literary manuscript contains a treatise on politics,
apparently by the philosopher Aristotle; an essay on kingship by
Isocrates, his 4th-century B.C. contemporary; and an unidentified
text that could be one of Aristotle's lost works, Mills said.
   The earliest complete texts of writings by Aristotle and
Isocrates that survive in museums today date from the 10th century,
a British expert said.
   The original works of classical Greek scholars have vanished.
What survives are usually separated from the authors' lifetimes by
hundreds of years of copying and re-copying by scribes.
   The new discoveries could bring scholars more than six centuries
closer to the lost originals and eliminate what the Times of London
described Friday as ``generations of slips of the pen.''
   The books, measuring 4-by-10 inches, each has eight or nine
wooden pages one-eighth of an inch thick, said Mills, 51, an
Egyptologist affiliated with the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.
   Mills, leader of a 25-member museum expedition that travels to
the Dakhla Oasis every winter, said the books were found in
mid-January.
   They are written in ancient Greek with a split-reed pen, bound
on one side and held together with the original strings, he said in
a telephone interview from his home in Bodmin, southwest England.
   ``The books are in excellent condition, the wood is good and
hard and the writing is very clear,'' he said.
   ``The one with literary text is written in a very clear, very
small and very precise hand. I would guess there would be 60 lines
on each page, and writing on both sides of the page.''
   The farm manuscript lists local tenant farmers and their
commodities over a four-year period, he said.
   The expedition of zoologists, botanists, ceramics experts and
others examining the links between human activity and the
environment in Isment were short of a classicist at the time of the
discovery. He said they sent for Guy Wagner, a French specialist in
ancient Greek texts who was working in an expedition at the nearby
Kharga Oasis.
   Wagner and a Danish colleague who accompanied him said the
writing seemed like Aristotle's but could not be sure if it was a
manuscript that was already known, Mills said. He said research was
being conducted.
   ``They were very excited,'' he said. ``It's a marvelous find, a
very rare find. There's so much that's new and incontrovertible in
this work. The information is so clearly stated.''
   The books were found about six feet below the surface and three
feet above the floor of a house and may have been accidentally
dropped, Mills said.
   ``We wondered that perhaps they fell out of somebody's
saddlebags as they were going by'' in the 4th or 5th century, Mills
said. The town had been abandoned and was eventually buried by sand
dunes around the sixth century, he said.
   The unidentified text could be one of Aristotle's lost works,
Mills said. Of abvout 150 named works that Aristotle left, fewer
than 30 survive in more than fragmentary form.
   Thomas Pattie, a papyrologist at the British Library, said few
texts by Aristotle have been found in Egypt and most are written on
papyrus, a water plant used by the ancient Greeks, Egyptians and
Romans to make writing materials.
   ``This is written on wood _ not so many have been found _ and
was possibly for school use,'' Pattie said in an interview.
   The earliest surviving fragmentary manuscript containing an
Aristotle work, ``The Constitution of Athens,'' dates from the
first century A.D. and is written on papyrus.
   ``There are several fragments from the second century and this
is apparently from the third century but it may be more
substantial,'' he said.
   ``It might turn out to be very important indeed. These complete
texts could be about 600 years older that the next oldest full
texts.''
