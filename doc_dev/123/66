   A government-sponsored study concluded Tuesday
that American students are doing miserably in math, and experts laid
some of the blame on the redundant, slow-paced way math is taught in
most schools.
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress reported that
almost half the 17-year-old students tested in 1985-86 proved
incapable of handling math commonly taught in junior high, and
nearly 27 percent of 13-year-olds were stumped by basic computations.
   ``Our ninth graders are taking what other peoples' seventh
graders are taking,'' Chester Finn Jr., the assistant U.S. secretary
of education for research and improvement, told a news conference.
``We've got to get it going faster, repeated less and make sure that
it's learned more.''
   The study was based on exams given to nearly 15,000 students ages
9, 13 and 17 in 1985-86, and to a total of nearly 35,000 students in
grades 3, 7 and 11. It was the fourth national assessment in math
since 1972-73.
   The study, ``The Mathematics Report Card: Are We Measuring Up,''
said all three age groups made modest improvements in recent years,
but mostly on low-order skills. Fewer were capable of advanced work
in 1986 than in 1978.
   ``Despite signs of their progress across time, the 1986
performance of 17-year-old students was dismal,'' the report said.
``Only half the high school students demonstrated an understanding
of even moderately complex mathematical procedures'' usually
introduced in junior high.
   The report said math classes are ``dominated by paper-and-pencil
drills on basic computation. Little evidence appears of any
widespread use of calculators, computers or mathematics projects.''
   More than a quarter of the 17-year-olds reported they usually do
not understand what is talked about in mathematics class.
   Math instruction is ``dominated by teacher explanations,
chalkboard presentations, and reliance on textbooks and workshops.
More innovative forms of instruction, such as ... small group
activities, laboratory work and special projects, remain
disappointingly rare.''
   ``The early emphasis on practicing computations may serve to
divorce mathematics from real-world observations,'' the report said.
``Once students learn to rely on procedures, they tend to give up on
common sense. ... This can lead to preposterous answers.''
   ``We're seeing a lot of drill and practice on obsolete skills,''
said John A. Dossey, an Illinois State University math professor.
   But the students tested in 1986 also reported getting more
homework and tests in math, and more were enrolled in advanced
courses.
   The report said 98 percent of the 9-year-olds and 100 percent of
the older students knew simple arithmetic facts, but virtually none
of the younger students and only 6.4 percent of the oldest could
solve multistep problems and algebra questions.
   Black and Hispanic students, as well as those living in the
Southeast, gained ground, but remain far behind the white majority.
   The National Assessment, administered by Educational Testing
Service, tests a sample of American students in basic subjects every
other year.
   Finn, whose department pays for the testing, said that despite
minority gains, only one black 17-year-old student in 300 and
``barely 1 percent of the Hispanic kids'' scored at the advanced
level, compared with 7.6 percent of the whites.
   Lawmakers decried the study's findings.
   Sen. Lawton Chiles, D-Fla., called it ``tragic'' and said, ``To
the question, `Mathematics: are we measuring up?' the answer is,
simply, no.''
   Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House
Education and Labor Committee, called it ``quite sobering'' and said
it was ``shameful that Japanese companies seeking to open plants
here must use graduate students to do calculations done by high
schoolers in Japan.''
   The tests indicated girls and boys ``had identical average
mathematics proficiency'' at age 9, but boys outscored girls at 13
and 17.
   ``Females tend to outperform males on tasks where there is an
obvious procedural rule to follow, while the reverse seems to be
true when the strategy for solving the problem is less apparent,''
the study said.
   The National Assessment devised its own 0-to-500-point scale to
chart students' proficiency. The percentages of 9-, 13- and
17-year-old students at or above the five proficiency levels in 1986
were:
   _Level 150. Simple Arithmetic Facts. 97.8 percent of 9-year-olds,
100 percent of 13-year-olds, 100 percent of 17-year-olds.
   _Level 200. Beginning Skills and Understanding. 73.9, 98.5, 99.9.
   _Level 250. Basic Operations and Beginning Problem Solving. 20.8,
73.1, 96.0.
   _Level 300. Moderately Complex Procedures and Reasoning. 0.6,
15.9, 51.1.
   _Level 350. Multistep Problem-solving and Algebra. 0.0, 0.4, 6.4.
   The average score for 9-year-olds tested in 1986 was 221.7; for
13-year-olds, 269, and for 17-year-olds, 302.
   For white students, the average scores for the three ages were:
226.9, 273.6 and 307.5. For black students, 201.6, 249.2 and 278.6.
For Hispanics, 205.4, 254.3 and 283.1.
   In separate grade-level scores, Asian-American students trailed
whites in grade 3, but were far ahead in grades 7 and 11. The
Asian-Americans averaged 211.3, 288.6 and 330.6.
