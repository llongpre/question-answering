   National standards are needed to improve
mathematics teaching in the United States, but a uniform curriculum
such as the kind found in Japan and other countries would be
impractical, the National Research Council said in a report issued
today.
   The report, ``Everybody Counts,'' stressed that standards must be
flexible enough to allow for regional differences and that local
teachers and parents must be deeply involved in decision-making.
   The council, an arm of the National Academy of Sciences, studied
U.S. mathematics education from kindergarten to graduate school.
   Countries with ``top-down'' systems in which all children in a
certain grade study the same material the same way ``have beaten us
hands-down'' in teaching math, the report says.
   But imitating Japan and other top-down countries will not work
here because of the long U.S. traditions of local initiatives and
decentralized authority, the report said. The answer is to establish
``appropriate national expectations based upon broad public
support.''
   A major step toward national standards is expected early this
year when the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics publishes
``Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics.''
   The upcoming NCTM report is ``the first effort ever to establish
national expectations for school mathematics,'' the research council
says.
   A recent surge of studies and books has underscored growing
concern over the nation's mathematical prowess. The research council
in its report today noted a number of specific problems in the math
education field. Among them:
   _Too many students leave school without knowing enough math for
productive lives. And on average, U.S. students do not master math
basics at a level sufficient to sustain our present technologically
based society.
   _Courses and instruction at our schools and colleges are ``years
behind the times.'' Undergraduate math is ``intellectually stagnant,
overgrown with stale courses.''
   _U.S. students lag far behind students of other nations in math
achievement. Plus it's socially acceptable here to do badly in math,
encouraging low expectations.
   _The shortage of qualified math teachers is more serious than in
any other area of U.S. education and affects all levels from
elementary to graduate school. The shortage of minority math
teachers is particularly acute.
   _Calculators and computers have had ``virtually no impact'' on
instruction despite great potential to enrich it. And standardized
multiple-choice tests are obstacles to teaching higher-thinking
skills and the use of calculators and computers.
   Governors should demand new standards and provide resources to
encourage improvements in math teaching, the report says. Congress
should reward effective programs, while the president should stress
upgraded math education as crucial to national security.
   Students should study math every year and use math in other
classes, while their parents should support teachers who seek
curricular improvements and ``expect homework to be more than
routine computation.''
   Principals should help teachers work together and support
innovation, while the business community should provide internship
opportunities for teachers. And the authors admonish the private
sector: ``Do not steal good teachers by hiring them away.''
