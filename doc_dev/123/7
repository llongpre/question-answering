Once it was fur coats. Now, since fashion gurus have obscured the difference
between real and ersatz hides, it is woolly jumpers. Shops one thought of as
staid - the Scottish knitwear specialists, with their changeless tartan ties
and avuncular cardigans - have become targets of the Animal Rights Militia.
This is the organisation which gutted the Cambridge store of Edinburgh
Woollen Mills earlier in the month. The local animal rights spokesman
allocated precise credit for the action to a guerrilla sub-group of his
movement, known as the Justice Department. And justice, he said, had been
done on the grounds that 'sheep-shearing leaves sheep susceptible and cold
as a naked human.'
This was not an isolated incident. The Cambridge branch of Boots the
Chemists was set alight, and certain research units around Britain have
received a new sort of home-made bomb: an exploding mousetrap primed with
razor blades. This aims not only to remove the digits of those scientists
suspected of animal abuse, but also makes a statement on behalf of mice, so
often the choice for laboratory tests.
A flurry, then, of animal rights activity. There is nothing new in this. But
the extension of anathema-status to pullovers is new, and it is always
interesting to watch how the British deal with such issues, for the British
make it part of their self-definition that they are kind to animals when
others in Europe, especially southern Europe, are not.
This nationalistic pride was trumpeted during European negotiations about
rules for transporting livestock. Even those of us who like a good steak, it
seems, are concerned that the ox shall travel to his slaughter in decent
comfort.
Gourmets will point out that a well-rested beast tastes better, so this is
not pure charity; still, it is true that the British get angry about the
ill-treatment of animals, and in that sense the animal rights movement is
never entirely marginal.
Whether many wool-wearing people or even woolly liberals will ever feel pity
for chilly sheep is doubtful. But translating kindness towards animals into
justice for animals is something that we ought to take more seriously than
we do, and scientists, with distinguished exceptions, such as James Gaia
Lovelock, are too quiet about it.
Those activists who resort to pyromania are probably not the sort to engage
in rational argument. Yet it is a debate which used to be very much alive in
pagan philosophy. Pythagoras, who first articulated vegetarianism in the
sixth century BC, was only one of many thinkers who addressed animal rights.
But Christian theologians from St Augustine onwards have quelled the issue,
being content to accept the animal kingdom as a part of creation subordinate
to human needs. According to St Augustine, if we took the commandment 'Thou
shalt not kill' as an injunction not to slaughter animals, we should also
have to prohibit ourselves from uprooting parsnips.
This is what logicians call a slide. To say that one move will lead to
another is a familiar method for blocking moral progress. Faced with a man
who believes that sheep should not be shorn, we might then insist that he
abstain from the consumption of honey, milk and eggs - all of which have
been regarded as theft by some legally-minded purists - and, like St
Augustine, challenge him to wrench a happy parsnip from the earth.
The application of human justice to the animal world hinges, as Richard
Sorabji demonstrated recently in Animal Minds and Human Morals (Duckworth),
on how far we consider animals to share in the human capacity for reason.
Charles Darwin believed that there was no human trait which could not be
found reflected in one animal or another; but modern scientists, following
Aristotle, have been forced to use an exclusion zone based on a
technicality. The technicality is that animals have no syntax. It follows
that if a creature cannot construct a sentence, then we are at liberty to do
with it what we will in the slaughterhouse or the research institute.
Consideration of babies, parrots and chimpanzees will immediately generate
worries about the absolute logic of this technicality. Indeed, it is hard to
see what relevance it has in a debate which is primarily about pain and the
capacity of living things to feel it.
Pythagoras stopped a man beating a dog because he recognised in the dog's
yelps the voice of an old friend. Most of us, if we think about it, will
admit unease about testing chemicals on beagles. That does not mean,
necessarily, that we would not wish chemicals to be tried on rats, nor that
we should charitably prefer to wear nylon rather than wool.
What matters is that we give the matter some thought. In that sense, one has
to feel grateful for the occasional arson attack. Crass as they are, such
actions are not unfounded. They rightly make us think.
