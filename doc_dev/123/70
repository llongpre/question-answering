   In the world of mathematics, Gregory and David Chudnovsky are
known for going the extra mile.
   Unsatisfied with their record 600-mile-long calculation of pi in
June, the brothers more than doubled that record, coming up with a
number containing more than a billion digits.
   ``They're starting more calculations, so it goes on from here,''
Denis Arvay, a spokesman for IBM, said Tuesday. ``I don't know when
they're going to stop.''
   Meanwhile, six California scientists extended man's search into
the infinite by determining the world's largest known prime number.
   The find left Joel F. Smith, one of the researchers, groping for
a way to describe the 65,087-digit number.
   ``It's God-awful large,'' Smith said. ``There's nothing in the
real universe that is comparable at all, that you measure in those
numbers.''
   Pi, the ratio between the diameter and circumference of a circle,
begins 3.14159, then continues on indefinitely with no known
duplication or pattern.
   Since pi was first approximated at 3 1@7 in ancient Greece, it
took centuries and the invention of the computer in recent decades
for scientists to calculate the ratio to more than 100,000 decimal
places.
   But in less than three months, the Chudnovskys extended their
record calculation from 480 million decimal places to more than a
billion.
   The Columbia University researchers did their work on two
supercomputers at International Business Machines Corp.'s Thomas J.
Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., the company said.
   The new mark of 1,011,196,691 digits appears to be a record,
Arvay said.
   Peter Renz, associate director of the Mathematical Association of
America, said he had not heard of anybody exceeding the researchers'
mark.
   In June, the Chudnovskys said their 480 million-digit pi would
stretch for 600 miles if printed.
   At the time, David Chudnovsky said calculating pi to such lengths
is useful for testing the performance of computer hardware and
software. He called the task ``the ultimate stress test.''
   In California, the six researchers at computer maker Amdahl Corp.
spent evenings and weekends during the last year using the company's
machines to find the largest prime number.
   The number equals 391,581 multiplied by 2 to the 216,193rd power,
minus one. To put that in perspective, that's 600 times the number
of atoms in the known universe, according to Sergio E. Zarantonello,
one of the researchers.
   ``It's like going to the moon, in a sense. There's not a lot
there, but it's important scientifically to do it because the
technology proves so useful,'' researcher Bodo Parady said.
   A prime number is any number that can be divided evenly only by 1
and itself.
   According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the previous
record was set in 1985 by David Slowinski of Cray Research Inc., the
supercomputer maker. The new number, discovered Aug. 6, has 37 more
digits and is a trillion, trillion, trillion times larger.
   Sunnyvale, Calif.-based Amdahl said Guinness had accepted the
number for entry into the publication.
   The discovery was announced at a meeting this week of the
American Mathematical Society by Sam Wagstaff Jr., a computer
scientist at Purdue University.
   Although the number itself has no known practical application,
the advanced multiplication programs honed by the researchers during
their work already are being used by scientists searching the
universe for pulsars, rotating neutron stars.
   The process also has applications in cryptology and bank
transaction coding, which use large prime numbers.
   The other Amdahl researchers were: John Brown, Landon Curt Noll
and Gene Ward Smith.
