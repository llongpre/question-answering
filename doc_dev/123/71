   If Tammy and Michelle Walsh were stumped
by the Pythagorean theorem or baffled by Ohm's Law when they were
doing their school assignments, help was usually just a call away,
by ship's radio.
   While sailing in the Bahamas, an engineer from Nassau was there
with advice on algebra. A vacationing English professor from the
University of California at Berkeley once offered essay-writing
tips.
   The sisters now are freshmen at Babson College, having completed
elementary, junior high and high school while sailing on the
Atlantic with their parents and two cats on a 45-foot boat called
High Hopes.
   They studied French in Florida and geometry in Georgetown via a
Chicago correspondence school that once a year mailed books and
exams. They completed the tests at their own pace and returned them
for grading.
   ``I think we got a better education,'' Michelle, 21, who took
some time off before going to college, said in an interview at the
1,550-student undergraduate business school outside Boston. ``You
learned much more because you read everything. You had a lot of
responsibility. We ended up more well-rounded and ready to take on
the world.''
   In 1971, when the sisters were pre-schoolers, Mickey and Joyce
Walsh of Oakdale, N.Y., on Long Island's south shore, decided to
take the kids sailing. Mickey gave up his job working on a clam
dredge and the family left for Puerto Rico, where they lived for a
year.
   They returned to Puerto Rico in 1974 for another year, and
Michelle started in correspondence school. The family sold their
house in 1979 and decided to move to the boat.
   ``They always liked sailing and wanted to live on a boat and
travel,'' Tammy, 18, said of her parents. ``They were going to wait
until we grew up.''
   Instead, the family went to sea and the girls learned to
discipline themselves in their studies. Their parents left them on
their own almost from the start, they said.
   ``They felt we were mature and responsible enough to do it and
by doing that we became more mature and responsible,'' said Tammy.
   The Walshes spent summers on New York's Fire Island, then
usually left in October and sailed down the Atlantic Coast. The
trip offered maximum study time, often up to eight hours a day.
   ``Then we'd get to the beach and not (study) for months,''
Michelle said.
   The family spent most winters anchored off Georgetown in the
Exuma Islands in the Bahamas. Books often weren't a priority;
Michelle needed three years to complete algebra.
   Michelle and Tammy admit that while they disciplined themselves
enough to finish the required texts, if the sun was shining and the
water glistening, boardsailing won out over Shakespeare.
   ``We didn't have set hours,'' said Michelle. ``If it was a
beautiful day outside I wasn't going to sit and read.''
   Mary McKeown, principal of the Chicago-based American School of
Correspondence, said Michelle received her high school equivalency
diploma in 1984 and Tammy in 1987. They had to take at least 16
credits under Illinois requirements.
   She said the school is accredited by the North Central
Association of Colleges and Schools and serves a variety of
students, from young people living abroad to adults seeking to
finish high school. Tuition and books cost $679 for four years.
   Science and math courses most frequently sent the sisters
searching for help on the radio or high seas.
   ``People living on boats are very friendly,'' Tammy said. ``You
don't think anything about rowing up to someone's boat, knocking on
the hull and saying `Hi.'''
   The Walshes say they don't regret missing the typical high
school scene. And they offer their Scholastic Aptitude Test scores
in defense of their academic preparation: 1,280 for Tammy and 1,080
for Michelle, compared to the 1987 national average of 906 out of a
possible 1,600.
   ``They gave you a book and you had to read the whole book, no
matter what,'' Tammy said. ``I think that's a big difference. I
know people who say they never finished a textbook.''
