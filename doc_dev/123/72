THE SELECTED LETTERS OF BERTRAND RUSSELL: VOL. 1, 1884-1914 edited by
Nicholas Griffin Allen Lane The Penguin Press Pounds 25, 640 pages
IT IS characteristic of Bertrand Russell that when in 1895 he won his Prize
Fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, he donated his stipend to the
newly-founded London School of Economics. His instinctive generosity did not
only express itself in financial terms; to almost everyone he knew he was
generous in many intellectual and emotional ways. His letters testify
luminously to this trait, as they testify also to his scintillating
intelligence and delightful wit. All these facets of Russell are present to
us in these letters, each of them serving as a record, preserved in
typically sharp, lucid prose, of the freshly-minted responses of a brilliant
yet extraordinarily humane mind.
Nicholas Griffin tells us that there are nearly 50,000 letters in the
Russell archive. For this volume, the first of two, he has chosen 240, all
but one previously unpublished. They cover Russell's first four decades,
taking us to the event which impelled him into his controversial public
career: the outbreak of the First World War. The projected second volume,
still in preparation, covers the remaining six decades of Russell's life,
throughout which he was prominent on the international stage as social
reformer, peace campaigner and philosophical gadfly stinging the body
politic.
Griffin's achievement in this first volume is a splendid augury for its
successor. He has in effect given us a new biography of Russell, skilfully
weaving the letters into an explanatory narrative of notes and commentary.
It is notable that most of Russell's letters are to women, indeed to the
small group of women who were most important to him in this period: his
grandmother, who brought him up; Alys Pearsall Smith, his first wife; and
Lady Ottoline Morrell, with whom Russell had a love-affair which liberated
him from the sexual and social poverties of his earlier life.
To these women Russell wrote intimately of his feelings, hopes, work,
friends and conversations. He wrote almost daily, and at length, in
characteristically fluent style, so that the letters constitute a remarkable
diary, comparable in its autobiographical and literary value to Pepys or to
Rousseau's memoirs, and even more gripping than the epistolary fictions of
Richardson because they convey the genuine personal testimony of a great and
passionate mind. Only to these women did Russell write so fully; to male
friends his letters give less of his inward mind and therefore more that is
inessential.
The volume begins with Russell's boyhood letters to his grandmother, widow
of the reforming Prime Minister Lord John Russell. She brought up the
orphaned Russell at Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park in an atmosphere of
priggish austerity. Hunger for affection remained, Russell later said, one
of the permanent compulsions of his life. Tutors and nannies fostered his
precocious talents, and at 19 he went up at Cambridge to read mathematics
and then philosophy, becoming a Prize Fellow of Trinity at the age of 23.
While still an undergraduate Russell fell in love with a Quaker five years
his senior, Alys Pearsall Smith. Soon after graduating, and against his
family's determined opposition, they married, so beginning a period of
happiness in which Russell produced his greatest work in logic and
philosophy. This was not at Alys's expense; the letters show that Russell
was a 'new man' a century before the expression was invented, for he and
Alys devised a 'complicated mutual-adjustment system' of marriage which
reflected their opposition to traditional views about women's roles. Both
were ardent feminists, and even as Russell was writing (with AN Whitehead)
his great three-volume treatise on the logical foundations of mathematics,
the Principia Mathematica, he stood several times for Parliament as a
woman's suffrage candidate. Later, with Ottoline Morrell, he experienced
again the fruitful ecstasy of love which, paradoxical as it seems, inspired
some of his best technical work.
Russell never believed in academic exclusiveness, and to any interested
correspondent he enjoyed giving lucently pithy accounts of his work. As a
result the volume describes Russell's philosophical progress from student to
internationally famous savant in a series of brilliant vignettes drawn by
Russell himself. But even in these letters the discussion ranges widely,
touching with equal ease on history or politics, music or personal matters.
Concerning these last, Russell was an indefatigable correspondent, entirely
unpretentious and full of affection.
The Russell one meets in these pages is enormously likeable and admirable.
Griffin's choice of letters portrays something very different from a Mr
Apollinax ravishing maidens. It has become fashionable, even among
philosophers, to undervalue Russell's contributions; but both in technical
philosophy, where his influence so pervades that citation of his works is no
longer necessary, and in the social revolution which freed 20th-century
minds from Victorian fetters, Russell is a central figure. He merits
celebration, and this volume marvellously demonstrates why.
