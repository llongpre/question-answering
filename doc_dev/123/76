<LEADPARA>  WHILE panels of scientists, mathematicians and corporate leaders issue grim
reports about the failures of American students to prepare for the high-tech
future, 276 kindergarten through eighth-grade students at Flood School in the
Ravenswood district are proving the experts wrong.;    Ravenswood students are
black and Hispanic, in about equal proportions, and most come from poor or
lower-middle-class families in East Palo Alto and eastern Menlo Park. For
years, they've earned rock-bottom scores on standardized tests. They're not
expected to succeed. Usually, they live down to those expectations.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Three years ago, Superintendent Charlie Mae Knight re-opened Flood as a
science, math and technology magnet. The school was aimed at bright students,
but these weren't geniuses -- just kids with a little more motivation, who
were willing to try a more challenging school.;    Flood's academic and
behavior standards are high. No problem. With the school's stress on
perseverance and self-discipline, almost all students have been able to live
up to those standards.;    The environment is safe, since fighting is not
tolerated. The building has been renovated by volunteers, with the help of
corporate and foundation donations, and is equipped with state-of-the art
computers and science labs.;    The curriculum is organized around a central
theme -- this year, it's the Earth -- and hands-on instruction is emphasized.
In addition, volunteers from local companies and Stanford University teach
special classes during and after school.;    And, of course, Flood is staffed
by a principal and teachers with a high commitment to their school's mission
and high expectations for their students.;    In the 1989-90 California
Assessment Program, Flood third-graders scored in the 98th percentile for
reading, in the 97th percentile for mathematics and in the 95th percentile for
writing. The sixth-graders' scores soared to the 78th percentile in reading,
70th in writing and 63rd in math.;    While the numbers taking the test are
small, which can lead to statistical fluctuations, there seems to be a trend:
The higher the percentage of a student's education obtained at Flood, the
higher the student's score.;    While not all schools can mobilize the special
help Flood has received, it doesn't cost a lot of money to set high standards
for effort and behavior. Everybody knows that students do better when they're
asked to do better.;    It need not cost a lot of money to create schools
energized by an educational vision or focus. Every school can be special in
some way.;    If some students can succeed, they all can. And they will be
needed as the scientists, mathematicians, engineers, physicians,
entrepreneurs, teachers and poets of the future.  </TEXT>
