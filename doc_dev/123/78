   While modern science provides better answers
to why earthquakes occur, the human response to these disasters
differs little from that of centuries past.
   ``Praying to God'' was prominent among the answers set forth by
the writer Galesius following tremors in Italy in 1570, and that
was surely the response of many Californians on Tuesday and since
that tremor.
   Galesius also urged ``coming outside during an earthquake,''
which remains good advice, and ``bearing patiently the troubles
that could not be avoided.''
   Two other recommendations from his pen covered strengthening of
buildings to better resist future quakes, though modern building
materials and practices differ from what he had available.
   His final suggestion was placing statues of Saturn and Mercury
at the four corners of buildings.
   Galesius researched quakes that shook the regions around Naples,
Pozzuoli and Ferrara, producing a book that enumerated different
types of shaking and suggested that earthquakes were portents of
even more disasters in the future.
   In his book, Galesius listed the many theories of why
earthquakes occur, including the then-popular concept that they
resulted from ``exhalations'' from inside the Earth.
   Today, scientists describe the movement of giant plates deep in
the earth, with quakes occurring most often along the borders of
those plates where the rocks bind together for a time and then
suddenly slip past one another when the stress becomes strong
enough.
   Ancient scientists and philosophers, however, produced many
theories in an effort to explain the shaking of the ground beneath
their feet. They were able to record the quakes over thousands of
years, and observed that tremors were more common in some areas
than others.
   One of the earliest theories was produced by the Greek writer
Thales who lived at about 580 B.C. He conceived the Earth as a
great vessel floating on the oceans, and thought that movement of
the water caused earthquakes.
   Competing theories were produced by Anaximenes, who thought
giant rocks colliding in the earth's interior caused the temblors.
   Writing between 500 and 428 B.C., Anaxagoras contended that fire
caused earthquakes. He thought that caverns beneath the land were
filled with vapors and when the vapors collided, lightning-like
fire was produced, shaking the land above. The theory was similar
to the one common then that lightning in the air was produced when
clouds collided.
   Also in the fifth century B.C. Archelaus theorized that air
became compressed in underground caverns and eventually the
pressure caused quakes.
   Perhaps the most important of classical writers on earthquakes
was Seneca, who lived from 4 B.C., to 65 A.D. He believed that the
interior of the earth was filled with cold, clammy air which caused
the quakes.
   That theory was repeated by many later writers including Konrad
von Megenberg in the 1300s, who added the possibility that the
stars stirred up these vapors. He also believed that the earthly
vapors caused the Black Plague then sweeping Europe.
   The Venerable Bede, writing in England about 700 A.D., contended
that earthquakes were caused by a large sea beast in the ocean with
its tail wrapped around the world. Similar beast theories have
abounded in other cultures.
   In the 15th century, the writers Agricola and Cardan expounded
on the theory of fires within the Earth, with Cardan emphasizing
the possibility of sulfur and niter causing explosions beneath the
land.
   That theory remained popular for many years, with Nicholas
Lemery contending in the 18th century that the reaction of iron and
sulfur was responsible not only for earthquakes but also volcanoes
and thunderstorms.
   As science began to learn more about nature, electricity became
a possible candidate, with Jean-Claude Delametherie comparing the
earth's crust to the muscles of a fish reacting to the shock of an
electric eel.
   By the 19th century, scientists were learning more about quakes
with John Mitchell of England's Cambridge University discovering
the movement of waves through the Earth's surface and Domenico
Pignatoro of Italy devising an early scale of intensity for quakes.
