   Sometimes, love reins, especially
when a couple in their finest Western duds exchanges marriage vows
while sitting atop their horses in ``Bonanza'' country.
   Carol Clifford, 47, and B.D. Lapham, 46, said they decided to
tie the knot on horseback Saturday evening in this town near Ben
Cartwright's Ponderosa ranch on the old ``Bonanza'' TV series
because of their love of horses.
   With more than 150 guests watching from hay bales, the couple
said their ``I do's'' in front of a hitching post. But before they
could kiss, the crowd's clapping spooked the horses, causing them
to gallop up a hill. The couple later walked back in with the
horses.
   They originally planned to have a small wedding. ``But then I
said `Let's get married on the horses' and friends started asking
if they could come to the ceremony,'' Lapham said.
   Like their ceremony, their invitations were unusual. They were
designed like an old wanted poster and a friend shot bullets
through all of them.
   They met earlier this year when Clifford, a Reno newspaper
classified ad supervisor, was out walking. She met Lapham outside
the Cowboys &amp; Indians saloon he manages, putting out his flags.
   She stopped and said, ``Oh, you have nice flags,'' and the
romance blossomed from there.

   Densa is not a club for ``elitist
intellectuals,'' but they may join if they can pass the test.
   The Rochester-based club for the less-than-brilliant is a spoof
of Mensa, the international society of geniuses. Mensa members must
score within the top two percent of an IQ test.
   Densa members are required to score in the bottom 98 percent on
a test that asks, ``Who is buried in Grant's tomb?''
   As a bonus question, prospective members are asked ``Why?''
   ``I formed Densa in 1983 for the 4.6 billion people in the world
who couldn't get into Mensa,'' said J.D. Stewart, an employee of
Eastman Kodak Co. who claims 300 people have paid the $5 fee to
join.
   ``They're not elitist intellectuals,'' Stewart said of his
club's members. ``They're down-to-earth people.''

   A get-together with snakes and reptiles, aimed at
dispelling fears about the creatures, met with less than successful
results.
   ``Slimy'' and ``icky'' were the prevailing exclamations after
many of the young visitors touched them.
   They were among 2,000 participants in the sixth annual
Herpetological Weekend, sponsored by the Chicago Herpetological
Society, at the Chicago Academy of Sciences.
   The event gave visitors a chance to pet, prod and probe snakes
like Pythagoras, a 15-foot Burmese python, and about 100 other
serpents, lizards, iguanas and turtles.
   ``That thing feels gross,'' said 7-year-old Alex Vassilopolous,
yanking his hand away after reaching into Pythagoras' cage. ``It
felt like it had no bones inside.''
   ``It kind of feels like this grass,'' said 7-year-old Timothy
Love of Chicago, pointing to the AstroTurf floor of the exhibition
tent. He said he wanted to take a snake like Pythagoras home.
   Some herpetologists cited several reasons people might want to
keep reptiles as pets.
   ``They have no body odor. They smell like the room they're in,''
said Tom Anton. ``It's what makes them such effective predators.''
   But, he added, don't expect ``Fido the snake'' to be waiting for
you with your slippers when you get home.
   ``Snakes are by nature very shy animals,'' he said. ``They can
take or leave people _ mostly leave them.''

   Vice President George Bush and Gov. Michael
Dukakis may be running a tight two-man race for the presidency but
they wouldn't stand a chance against a third party ticket that
barked and purred.
   In a vote taken during Sunday's Third Avenue Festival, the
Humane Party's choice for president, Sandy the Dog _ Little Orphan
Annie's sidekick _ and his running mate, Morris the Cat, trounced
the Republican and Democratic tickets.
   Sandy and Morris garnered 44,500 votes for a landslide victory
over Dukakis and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, who won 8,100 votes, and Bush
and Sen. Dan Quayle, who trailed with 5,700 votes.
   ``I think that's amazing,'' said Ed Kayatt, the publisher of Our
Town Newspaper, a festival sponsor. ``It certainly shows that a lot
of people are disenchanted with both major candidates.''
   Kayatt said the election idea was his: ``We did not do it as a
gag. We did it in an effort to find out the sentiment of the public
on the presidential election.''

   A chili cook-off took on a political flavor
as contestants concocted their chilies in a stand flanked by
cardboard cans, one reading ``Dukakis Greek Style Chili Beans
Seasoned With Bentsen,'' the other proclaiming ``Bush's Best Beans
Flavored With Fresh Quayle.''
   The cook-off, part of a weekend festival, also featured chefs
costumed as big red tomatoes.
   ``We're trying to appeal to the vegetables in the crowd,'' Vicki
Ladegard said.
   Tim and Gina Higgins of Lincoln said their recipe was the king
of all chilies with Elvis Presley record albums decorating their
stand.
   ``It's Elvis' secret recipe,'' Tim Higgins said, pointing to
their pot of chili. ``He called from Wendy's in Kalamazoo.''
