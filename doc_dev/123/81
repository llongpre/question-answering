   In hopes of making Greeks more familiar
with their ancestors' ideas, the education minister has ordered
high school students to start taking daily classes in ancient Greek
in September.
   The decision by Education Minister Antonis Tritsis was reached
after months of public debate by scholars and educators, but some
teachers claim the language used by Homer, Plato and the great
Greek dramatists might confuse young students and be too hard for
them to learn.
   ``Ancient Greek ideas should have a living medium in the world
today,'' Tritsis said in an interview, ``and I think that living
medium is the Greek people who continue to speak the same language
as the ancient Greeks.''
   He added that high school students 13 to 18 years old will be
the first to take compulsory ancient Greek, but that eventually
6-year-olds will start learning the language through word-games.
   ``We want every young Greek to be directly familiar with the
great wealth of his ancestors and those ancient Greek works that
have influenced the world,'' said Tritsis, an American-trained
architect.
   European literature began with Homer's poems about the legendary
Greek heroes of the Trojan War, the ``Iliad'' and the ``Odyssey.''
   Plays by Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides in the 5th century
B.C. are studied and performed in translation all over the world.
Plato's philosophic dialogues and Thucydides' histories contain
ideas that shaped Western thinking for centuries.
   Although Greek classical scholars and university professors say
they welcome Tritsis' project, schoolteachers protest that ancient
Greek is too difficult for all but the most talented linguists.
   While ancient Greek shares an alphabet and a wide range of
vocabulary with the present-day language, its grammar and structure
are much more complex.
   ``It is a fallacy that ancient Greek can be easily grasped by
every schoolchild,'' Christos Doukas, who heads the Athens-based
High School Teachers' Union, said in an interview.
   But Tritsis said Greek is a very conservative language. He
indicated it would be much less difficult for Greek students to
learn ancient Greek than it would be for American high school
students to learn Old English, which was spoken in England from
around 400 to 1100 A.D., or even the English of Chaucer and
Shakespeare.
   ``The difference in language between Shakespeare's English and
modern English or Chaucer and modern English is greater than that
between Homer and Heroditus and the Greek spoken today,'' he said.
``Despite changes in forms ... the vast amount of words and
expressions are the very same language we use today.''
   Junior high students now study ancient Greek literature during
four 45-minute classes a week. But they read texts that have been
translated into modern Greek.
   Tritsis wants students to begin reading the texts in ancient
Greek.
   High school students take a two-year basic course in ancient
Greek and read some of the original literature. However, they are
not examined on the ancient Greek texts. Tritsis wants those
studies continued at a higher level entirely in the original Greek.
   The students will continue their usual studies of modern Greek
and their two classes a week of either French or English.
   The teachers, however, argue that language lessons should focus
on modern Greek, which a difficult language to master but still
easier than ancient Greek.
   ``Learning ancient Greek from original texts will only confuse
schoolchildren,'' said Doukas of the teachers union. ``Instead we
should all spend more time and energy concentrating on the Greek we
speak today, itself a rich and expressive language.''
   In a major reform of the Greek school system in 1976, compulsory
ancient Greek was dropped from the state high school curriculum as
a ``dead'' language, irrelevant to modern educational needs.
   Now 15- and 16-year-old students intending to go to university
usually take a two-year basic course in ancient Greek, but scholars
say that isn't enough to keep the heritage alive.
   ``Ancient Greek has to be introduced at a much earlier stage in
a child's education, when it helps to develop his imagination,
judgment and memory,'' said Constantine Trypanis, a former culture
minister and retired Oxford University professor of Byzantine and
Modern Greek Studies.
   ``The study of ancient Greek language and literature in the
original is of cardinal importance if that tradition of culture is
to survive.''
