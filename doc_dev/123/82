The glitter of modern jewellery, yours for a king's ransom, may have magpie
appeal but it is easy to tire of its insistent brand of glamour. As even
relatively worthless costume jewellery from a fashionable couture house can
run into hundreds - sometimes thousands - of pounds, why not consider
jewellery from the classical world?
Its appeal lies not only in the soft, matt colouring of the gold, the simple
design, the modest use of cabochon rather than facetted stones, but also in
the fact that it is relatively undervalued. For a few hundred pounds you can
buy an ancient Roman ring, inset with a cornelian intaglio or, for a few
thousand, a simple gold torque.
Anna Somers Cocks, editor of The Art Newspaper and former jewellery expert
at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, says that, historically, male collectors
were interested in sculpture, pots and intaglio - jewellery lay forgotten
and uncollected.
But ancient jewellery excites the imagination. Would the Roman senator who
wore an amethyst intaglio ring have been living when the news arrived of the
crucifixion of a prophet called Jesus Christ?
Perhaps I have found the very ring to which Ovid penned these thoughts
before he sent it to his beloved:
'May she receive thee with glad heart, and straightaway slip thee on her
finger; mayst thou fit her as well as she fits me and press her finger with
aptly adjusted circle]'
The pretty lemon-yellow hue of early Greek gold is explained by the fact
that it was only about 75 per cent pure. In the classical period, stones
were seldom used, enamel work was preferred, a feature put down to taste
rather than lack of supply, according to Doctor Dyfri Williams of the
British Museum.
Once Alexander the Great opened up trade with the east, the Middle Eastern
preference for coloured gems such as emeralds, garnets and amethysts,
resulted in more flamboyant, attention-seeking jewellery being made.
Regional tastes, it seems, do not change much down the ages.
In spite of the bold size of some pieces, early Greek jewellery tends to be
remarkably light (and therefore brittle) because it is made from hammered
out sheets of gold, not cast or solid metal.
The eye is struck by the complexity of the handwork. Minuscule round-section
wires, made by hammering and burnishing a thin rod of gold, were twisted and
then rolled between two flat surfaces of wood or metal and then used to
create ornate and delicate filigree work.
Tiny grains of gold were heated, melted and rolled into spheres and then
placed in clusters on a piece of beaten gold. Many can hardly be seen with
the naked eye; only a microscope can reveal the exacting nature of such a
craft.
On Wednesday, Christie's will be auctioning a private collection of ancient
gold jewellery as part of its fine antiquities sale in London. The sale
includes necklaces, earrings, finger rings and pendants from the 8th century
BC to the 12th century AD.
The following day, Sotheby's is offering a smaller array of ancient
jewellery.
For inspiration, the reader may wish to visit the spectacular exhibition of
Greek gold at the British Museum (until October 23), sponsored by Cartier.
There, brought together for the first time, are nearly 200 pieces of the
finest classical Greek jewellery from all parts of the Mediterranean.
If you do decide to buy from other than reputable dealers, be warned - some
collectors believe that up to 50 per cent of the 'ancient' jewellery on the
market is fake. Beginners should be prepared to make mistakes.
Dr Jack Ogden, who authenticated the forthcoming Christie's sale and is a
well- regarded expert who runs the Cambridge Centre for Precious Metal
Research, is the man to verify any serious investment.
'You must ask the right questions because fakes are harder and harder to
detect,' he warns. Clearly, experience counts but, as a rule, he would
suggest that 'there are few fakes produced before 1970 that are really going
to fool someone who takes it seriously'.
Forgery aside, many academics detest the trading of antiquities, arguing
that it encourages grave-robbing and the destruction of archaeological
sites. However, Dr Ogden argues: 'Whenever there's a market in anything it
encourages theft, whether it's a house robbery for an old master, a bike
shed raid for an old bike in Cambridge or a grave for antiquities. The
pieces on the market are not going to be re-buried. I see my job as trying
to record as much information as possible.'
While he admits to wearing a gold bracelet dating back to 700 BC, Dr Ogden
is gradually changing his opinion about whether these ancient pieces should
be worn. 'Wearing a piece does damage it and it also makes it much harder to
authenticate because a lot of the evidence is on the surface; the tool
marks, the deposits and so on. And gold does change slightly with time when
worn. And that rich matt colour begins to dissipate.'
However, he sees little wrong in wearing unimportant pieces and even
encourages the knowing purchase of acknowledged fakes. 'A couple of years
ago there was a gorgeous pair of fake Greek earrings on the market for about
Pounds 2,000. They were absolutely stunning. Even a great piece of fakery,
if you know it's fake, can be a bargain.'
Alessandro Castellani's Victorian fakes, for instance, are highly
sought-after and very collectable. In this growing market, Dr Ogden's
research centre is consulted by costume jewellery dealers. Recently, the
centre was asked to authenticate 1940s Chanel brooches. 'At Dollars 500 or
Dollars 600 a piece, people are bound to try and fake them. It's a joke
really,' says Ogden.
One is left with the view that unless investing serious money (in which case
extensive and costly tests of verification can be sought), then enjoy these
pieces for their refined style and the possibility, however remote, that
Caesar's concubine may have worn your brooch.

Susan Hadida, Rupert Wace and Robin Symes, although operating in the same
street, deal with different areas of the market. Hadida's prices range from
Pounds 50 for a thin bronze Byzantine bracelet to Pounds 15,000 for an early
Byzantine gold, glass and mother of pearl bracelet. The atmosphere at her
premises is informal. Hadida wants to dispel the illusion that 'these things
can't be touched or worn and only belong in museums'.
Rupert Wace can offer a Romano-British bronze and enamel brooch for between
Pounds 50 and Pounds 1,000 or a wearable Roman intaglio ring for about
Pounds 1,000.
The pride of his collection, which he sold to Durham Museum for Pounds
5,000, was an Egyptian amethyst and gold necklace (800 BC) which, in the
early 19th century, had belonged to the Duke of Northumberland.
Robin Symes has been dealing in antiquities since the early 1970s and has,
particularly, interested academic collectors. You may be able to buy Roman
earrings for Pounds 200 but, more typically, a fine Greek gold chain for
Pounds 40,000.
