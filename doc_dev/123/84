   Designing a dog kennel, building a scale model
of the solar system and calculating a statistical profile of the
``average'' student are among the exercises recommended in a new
attempt to upgrade math teaching.
   The 54 curriculum and evaluation standards announced Tuesday by
the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics aim to make sure
America's students can explore and reason as well as add and
subtract.
   In classrooms following the new plan, students would be exposed
to less rote memorization, more computers and calculators, and
cooperative teamwork instead of one-on-one competition. The idea is
to view math as a daily human activity and solve problems related to
real life.
   ``We look at a decade of work ahead of us in making these
changes,'' NCTM president Shirley Frye said at a news conference at
which the council released its 272-page, two-year effort. She said
videotapes, publications and trained leaders will encourage teachers
to put the standards into practice.
   The National Education Association and the American Federation of
Teachers praised the new standards and urged their members to use
them in their classrooms.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos was equally supportive. The
standards are ``valuable guidelines for a revised math curriculum
that captures students' interest and at the same time builds a solid
foundation of knowledge,'' he said in a statement.
   The new math teaching standards build on the premise, borne out
by recent studies, that American children do well in international
comparisons of basic arithmetical skills but poorly when it comes to
applying mathematical principles.
   ``Only about one-half of American 17-year-olds can say whether 87
percent of 10 is less than 10, greater than 10 or equal to 10,''
said John Dossey, chairman of NCTM's standards implementation
commission. Only about half can figure out how much carpet is needed
to cover a floor or calculate the probability of a simple event, he
said.
   Generally, the standards seek to ensure that students value math,
become confident in their abilities, learn to solve problems, and
learn to communicate and to reason mathematically. They set specific
goals and expectations for students _ and not only those headed for
Ph.D.s.
   ``Applied mathematics is not just for a couple of geniuses in the
country,'' said Sally Ride, a Stanford University physicist and
former astronaut who appeared at the news conference.
   In developing the standards, educators and mathematicians kept in
mind that many students find math deadeningly dull. They concluded
that rote practice and drills should not be abandoned, but shouldn't
dominate the classroom either.
   The group recommends that every student at every level have
access to calculators and computers, calling them ``fast pencils''
that allow students to expand on their basic skills. It also calls
for group activities that better reflect the way problems are solved
at work and in the community than the isolation and competition
found in many traditional math classes.
   The guidelines stress that math must be put in the context of
everyday life. Sample problems involve grocery shopping, motorcycle
races, used car purchases, savings accounts, pulse rates and taste
tests, among other things.
   In addition to curriculum guidelines, thegroup outlined
evaluation techniques designed to make sure concepts are understood.
   Frye cited the example of a student asked the perimeter of a
six-sided figure. A student could add the numbers on each side and
get the right answer, 23, without knowing what perimeter means, she
said. But a student told he has 23 yards of fencing to draw a
six-sided fence would have to demonstrate understanding of the
concept in order to solve the problem.
