   ``A Nation at Risk,'' the landmark federal report
that condemned mediocrity in America's schools nearly six years ago,
shocked the nation into a flurry of reform.
   But three new reports describing the sad state of U.S. students'
abilities in mathematics might be even more cause for alarm.
   On the surface, the reports released last week revealed little we
haven't heard before.
   Repeatedly during the last decade, international comparisons have
shown U.S. students lagging behind other youngsters in math.
   ``A World of Differences,'' a report by the Educational Testing
Service assessing 24,000 13-year-olds in six countries, found South
Koreans doing best among students from Ireland, England, Canada, and
Spain.
   U.S. pupils scored dead last.
   A report by the National Research Council, ``Everybody Counts: A
Report to the Nation on the Future of Mathematics Education,''
concluded that the nation desperately needs to agree on how math
should be taught. But it noted that compared with Japan or Korea,
math reform has consistently gotten nowhere in the United States
largely because our decentralized national school structure makes
consensus building so difficult.
   ``The top-down systems have beaten us hands down,'' the report
concluded.
   A survey conducted by the University of Michigan compared math
achievement levels of first- and fifth-graders in the Chicago area
and Beijing, China. It found American youngsters performing
significantly worse than their Chinese counterparts.
   Interestingly, that survey also found that the American parents
would be satisfied if their children scored a 70 on a math test. The
Chinese parents had higher aspirations: Their children would need to
score in the 90s to please them.
   But the larger significance of these latest reports lays in two
other findings: Students scoring highest did the most homework and
watched the least television. Koreans ranked first in math homework,
with 45 percent doing at least one to two hours a week; U.S.
students ranked last, with 28 percent doing that amount.
   If homework is indeed so central to better math scores, and if
mathematical know-how is really as crucial as everyone insists it is
to America's economic competitiveness, America may be in more
trouble than realized.
   It's common sense that students who do the most homework usually
have the strongest belief that hard work pays off. But some U.S.
educators wonder whether these math scores demonstrate that American
youngsters have grown soft on hard work.
   ``I think it's a cultural phenomenon in this country,'' said
Scott Thomson, executive director of the National Association of
Secondary School Principals. ``We don't recognize the importance of
studying math or studying tough subjects.
   ``The countries that are most successful, like Japan or Korea,
say right up front that it takes hard work and long hours and
grinding it out. We as a nation tend to be impatient with
everything, including studying.''
   Put bluntly: With math, as with no other subject, there's simply
no faking it. The answer's right or wrong. You either took the time
at home to memorize and drill and practice, or you didn't.
   But equally important, homework and a wholesome home environment
are inseparable. Merely requiring teachers to assign more is like
pushing on a string. Homework won't get done by the student who is
hungry or unhealthy, or chronically unhappy in single-family home
environments where parents are uninvolved in their youngsters'
education.
   Chronically weak math scores, then, indicate problems not just
with our schools, but our society _ problems that won't be solved
merely by tinkering with curricula or teaching methods, though such
changes may well be in order.
   It means that there is probably no quick fix for low math scores,
and schools can't solve the problem alone.
   Given its exactitude, mathematics is one of the truest
bellwethers of the nation's progress in educating children for the
21st century. In that sense, these reports contain plenty to worry
about.
