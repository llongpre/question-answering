THE MAGUS OF THE NORTH Isaiah Berlin John Murray Pounds 14.99, 144 pages
IN THE words of the Marquis de Condorcet, the Age of Enlightenment dawned
'when the human spirit moved in its chains, loosening all and breaking some;
when old opinions were examined and errors attacked; when customs were
questioned, and all minds took unexpected flight towards liberty.' The key
belief of the Enlightenment was that reason can deliver humanity from the
tyrannies of superstition, ignorance, and outworn convention, replacing them
with science and philosophy as guides.
The Enlightenment began in England and reached its maturity in France. Isaac
Newton showed that nature can be understood in terms of simple universal
laws; John Locke taught that 'the faculty of reasoning never deceives those
who trust in it'. The implication is that human intelligence can understand
the world and improve man's lot within it. Soon a group of French
philosophes was translating an English encyclopaedia, expanding and
transforming it into a revolutionary bible of rationalism, making the 18th
century outstanding as a time of hope for human progress.
The century might belong to reason's champions, but not all shared their
view; de Bachaumont complained that the philosophes 'seem deliberately to
aim at carrying a fatal clarity into men's minds.' But the most bitter of
the Enlightenment's contemporary opponents was the Prussian-born writer
Johann Georg Hamann, the 'Magus of the North' who is the subject of Isaiah
Berlin's new book.
Berlin's aim is to reclaim Hamann from obscurity. Hamann is 'the first
out-and-out opponent' of the Enlightenment, whose sharply uncompromising
hostility to it makes him 'the true founder of a polemical anti-rationalist
tradition which in the course of time has done much, for good and (mostly)
ill, to shape the thought and art and feeling of the West.' Berlin does not
share or approve Hamann's views; he writes about him as a 'witness of a
great deal that is truly revealing in the scattered, unsystematic,
passionate' writings of a man who figures high among 'the important if often
maddening irregulars of civilisation'.
Hamann was intensely religious. He came from the German pietist tradition,
which emphasises personal faith and direct communion with God, and
correspondingly despises 'book learning' and intellectualism. For Hamann
this meant commitment to blind faith and an angry rejection of the claims of
reason. He did not write systematic treatises, because that would conform to
the methods of those he attacked, with their goals of scientific clarity and
logical order. He wrote instead in outbursts and harangues, allowing his
views to emerge from essays that are often incoherent and deliberately
obscure.
The chief of Hamann's doctrines is that knowledge is wholly a matter of
animal faith. It is not the result of ratiocination; it is communicated by
God, spirit to spirit, in direct experience. Hamann hated science, which he
accused of describing the universe as a lifeless abstraction, thus
falsifying its divine, creative, spontaneous nature as the place where God,
who is 'a poet not a mathematician', might make anything happen.
Hamann hated all who were party to the scientific and rationalising ethos of
the time. This included not just philosophers, but everybody from Europe's
Jews to Prussia's Frederick the Great.
His zeal did not make him conventionally moralistic. Like William Blake he
considered sexuality good rather than evil. Flesh and the passions do not
sin, he argued, by existing; they can be misled by cold reason, but if they
are employed according to the instincts in which life itself consists, they
cannot be wrong. 'My coarse imagination,' Hamann wrote to Herder, 'has never
been able to picture a creative spirit without genitalia'. He identified
repression with rationality; children, he points out, have no false sense of
prudery.
Berlin wrote this account of Hamann 30 years ago. It is published only now
because Berlin's editor, Henry Hardy, onlyrecently discovered the manuscript
among Berlin's papers. It was a lucky find, for this is an appropriate
juncture for Hamann's thought to be discussed, if for nothing else as a
powerful example of the anti-rationalism which is again invading the world.
At the time Berlin wrote, it seemed natural to liken Hamann to the
Existentialists in some respects (the emphasis on instinct and feeling) and
to Wittgenstein in others (the obscurantist hostility to science and
theory). These comparisons wear well. If one wishes to see what blind
religious faith and hatred of rationality look like at their most eloquent,
Hamann is exemplary. Even if one is repulsed by unreason and its forces, one
must understand them; again Hamann is exemplary. So Berlin does a profound
service in restoring this philosophical whirlwind to our notice and helping
us, in his characteristically lucid way, to appreciate its content and
power.
