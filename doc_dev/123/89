'It seems that not one of the natural phenomena which sense experience
reveals to us or which are proved to us by the necessary demonstration can
be held in any doubt whatsoever, or rejected, because of some passages in
the Scriptures which in their literal wording seem to be at variance with
it.'
Galileo Galilei; letter to the Grand Duchess Cristina di Lorena, 1614.
(trans: Shmuel Sambursky)
ON A MOUNTAIN peak high above the little town of Thatcher, Arizona, Jesuit
astronomers from the Vatican have taken up station behind two new telescopes
to peer into the atmosphere surrounding the youngest stars in the Milky Way.
'Our purpose is not to look for extraterrestrial life,' said Father George
Coyne, director of the Vatican Observatory and a professor at the University
of Arizona (which has a quarter share in the telescopes). 'But we might
incidentally discover conditions for the birth of new planets.'
The 10,700-ft peak of Mount Graham, home to a rare red squirrel, the pocket
gopher and the white-bellied vole, thus becomes the scientific summit of the
Specola Vaticana, created by Pope Gregory XIII to help his 1582 reform of
the calendar.
That celibates in cassocks should be competing with the world's best
astrophysicists may seem quaintly anachronistic, even ludicrous. For do
science and religion not give rival accounts of the universe? Is not God
simply a device for explaining the parts that science cannot yet reach? To
those who believe that every scientific advance entails a theological
retreat, the Vatican's formal rehabilitation of Galileo at the end of
October came as just one more proof of the archaic cosmogony of the Roman
Catholic Church. If it took 360 years to issue that retraction, how can
Roman Catholic theology hope to keep up? If the church is still wrestling
with the consequences of the two apples - Eve's and Newton's - how can it
hope to accommodate quarks, gluons or the Big Bang?
Yet the antagonism of faith and science is a relatively modern invention.
Even the furore over Darwin's theory of evolution has been exaggerated. Most
of the scientific pioneers were believers, and some were clergymen -
Descartes, Newton, Kepler, Galileo, Bishop Berkeley, Locke and, in this
century, the Jesuit palaeontologist Teilhard de Chardin. Copernicus,
proponent of the heliocentric universe, was canon of Frauenberg cathedral.
As scientific accounts of the sub-atomic and cosmic worlds become ever more
incredible - or counter-intuitive in the jargon - physicists are ever more
careful to distinguish the 'how' questions of science from the 'why'
questions of theology. As theologian Sean P. Kealy has put it: science is
like a photograph of the world, faith like an x-ray. But both are 'real'.
This is the distinction which Pope John Paul II insisted upon when he
commented on the report of the Vatican's commission of inquiry into the
Galileo affair. 'A tragic mutual incomprehension has been interpreted as the
reflection of a fundamental opposition between science and faith,' he said.
'This sad misunderstanding now belongs to the past.'
Cardinal Paul Poupard, former rector of the Catholic Institute of Paris, was
president of the commission. He said from his office in the Vatican this
week: 'This is my very profound conviction too. For the believer, both kinds
of knowledge come from the same fount. As Galileo himself said, there are
two big books, the book of nature and the book of super-nature, the Bible.'
For example, added the cardinal, the Big Bang hypothesis (accepted by the
church as consistent with Revelation) did not prove or disprove anything to
the theologian. 'As Pascal, my favourite author wrote: it is a question of
another order.'
In Galileo's day, questions of two orders were not acknowledged. So, on
February 26 1616, the Pisan astronomer was condemned by the Holy Office for
reinforcing the heliocentric hypothesis of Copernicus. Only 16 years before,
the Dominican philosopher Giordano Bruno had been sent to the stake for a
similar Copernican crime.
Galileo's case was more complex. He was in good odour with Rome but was
stubborn, provocative - and influential. Writing in language that everyone
could understand he had spread his fame throughout Europe. Under pressure
from Cardinal Roberto Bellarmino, chief inquisitor and 'hammer of the
heretics' - and a student of astronomy himself - Galileo agreed to desist.
But in 1632 he published his Dialogo sopra i due massimi sistemi, tolemaico
e copernicano, repeating the alleged libel on the Scriptures. The Florentine
inquisition ordered the book to be seized - too late.
Although he enjoyed the protection of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, Galileo was
summoned to Rome, interrogated and in spite of a vigorous defence in which
he insisted that God spoke to mankind equally through nature and revelation,
was forced to recant on April 30 1633. A sentence of imprisonment was passed
on June 22 but reduced to one of house arrest two days later. He spent the
last nine years of his life confined to his villa in Arcetri, his health,
his sight and his spirit in decline.
Historians have argued that it was the manner as much as the matter of
Galileo's argument that led to his victimisation - that, and the insecurity
of the church under Pope Urban VIII. At all events, the great scientist was
the victim of a judgment which the Vatican commission has now declared to be
wrong, but not aberrant: that is to say, in the then state of knowledge the
Holy Office had no choice but to condemn the heresy.
When scientific proof arrived in the following century Galileo's works were
given the imprimatur and removed from the Vatican's notorious index of
prohibited books. That decision was upheld in the 19th century and
reconfirmed by the papal encyclical Providentissimus Deus, in 1893.
But the story did not end there. The present Pope, Karol Wojtyla, is a
graduate and former theology professor of Krakow University where the
German-Slav Mikolaj Kopernik (to give Copernicus his real name) studied
maths, optics and perspective.
Although regarded as a conservative in other respects, the Polish Pope gave
an early signal of his wish to repair the Vatican's reputation among
scientists by setting up the special commission on the Galileo affair a year
after being elected pontiff, on the 100th anniversary of Albert Einstein's
birth. There is talk of a forthcoming papal encyclical, to be called
Splendor Veritatis, the contents of which are not known but some Vatican
insiders say will reflect the Pope's interest in reconciling the two
branches of inquiry.
Some see the hand of another priestly Pole at work: Michael Heller, a
mathematical physicist and theologian who teaches at Krakow University, is a
confidant of Wojtyla's and an 'adjunct' member of staff of the Vatican
Observatory. He has been involved in a series of science summits at which
non-Catholic, even non-Christian, experts are invited to read papers and
debate with the theologians.
'What impressed me was that it was very hard work,' said Prof John Barrow,
professor of astronomy at Sussex University in England who attended a
seminar last year. 'There were 20 or 30 of us round a big table and we
worked from 9 am to 6.30 in the evening with an hour for lunch. The papers
were circulated six months in advance and took several hours to read. It was
not like the usual science meeting.' This series of meetings, run in
conjunction with the Centre for Theology and Natural Sciences at Berkeley,
California, is in addition to occasional briefings organised for the benefit
of the observatory's ten Jesuit staff.
Prof Stephen Hawking, the cosmologist who holds Newton's chair at Cambridge,
was another of those summoned. In his best-selling Brief History of Time,
Hawking gave an ironic account of his audience with the Pope: 'He told us
that it was all right to study the evolution of the universe after the Big
Bang, but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself because that was
the moment of Creation and therefore the work of God.' He was glad, he
added, that Pope John Paul had not heard him read the paper in which he had
argued that space-time was possibly finite but with no boundary - and
therefore there could be no moment of creation. 'I had no desire to share
the fate of Galileo.'
There is no 'Galileo cloud', said Fr Coyne, the observatory's director. 'In
30 years I have never had any problem with any colleague concerning the
relationship of science and faith.' He did, however, admit to a shortage of
scientifically-trained theologians within the Catholic church. 'We have to
look in every corner to find a Catholic or even Christian expert'.
But can the message of scripture, however judiciously interpreted, and the
hypotheses of modern science, however cautiously advanced, ever be truly
reconciled?
No, says the biologist and writer Richard Dawkins. 'There will always be
conflict between the two. You cannot get away from the fact that religion is
a scientific hypothesis: to say there is a Creator is to make a scientific
claim, and science cannot ignore that. Then you have to explain miracles
like the virgin birth and the resurrection.
'It makes me cross that religion should have this power over people's lives
and education and thought. I think the whole thing is a total illusion. Why
doesn't the Vatican learn the lesson? They were not just wrong about Galileo
 -that bungle was only a detail - but their whole attitude of thinking you
can decide things by appealing to authority is wrong.'
Dawkins concedes that some scientist-theologians make a good fist of
squaring their beliefs. Asked to explain why so many scientists continue to
accept God he suggested the human brain could be infected by something akin
to a self-replicating computer virus.
The radical theologian Don Cupitt, dean of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, sees
religion as another kind of programme, a developing activity rather like
art, which can discover no final or absolute truth.
'For example, to say 'He ascended into Heaven' means nothing to us now,' he
said. 'All dogma is entangled in a medieval world view and has to be
rethought as a whole - you can't do it piece by piece.'
A more charitable view of the Vatican's programme is taken by the Rev Dr
Arthur Peacocke, a physical biochemist and Anglican priest who has also
taken part in the conferences at Castelgandolfo, the Pope's summer
residence. 'Given their inbuilt reactionary system it's to their credit that
they have put the record straight in their own legalistic way,' he said.
Science and theology might be addressing different questions but they
applied similar criteria.
'People put them together in different ways. I say both are part of truth
and reality and you can't put them in separate pigeonholes. Sometimes the
interreaction is puzzling, sometimes it is creative.'
Another Anglican scientist-priest who has been to Castelgandolfo is the Rev
Dr John Polkinghorne, president of Queens' College, Cambridge. His views
carry weight: he is a fellow of the Royal Society and was professor of
mathematical physics at the university before his ordination 10 years ago.
He, too, sees a kinship between science and theology: their use of
induction, of models and metaphors, their search for simplicity of
hypothesis and unified theory. 'But science is asking one sort of question,'
he said, 'and religion another. There are connections between the answers -
there is an uneasy sort of puzzling boundary between the two. People say one
is public, the other private. I don't think that's right - after all, ethics
and ideas of beauty are common concepts. It's not expressing an opinion to
say that torturing children is wrong. A lot of people in the science world
are wistful fellow-travellers who fear that the answers of religion might be
a kind of suicide.'
As he takes off for Arizona to begin work in the Mount Graham observatory,
Father Coyne is unabashed. 'Any advance in science, correctly heard by the
Church, is a help to the Church,' he said. The Pope may have declared a
truce with science but it could be a long time before the world is ready to
believe in Rome's conversion.
