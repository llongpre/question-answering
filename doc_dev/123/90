<LEADPARA>  Just one in seven eighth-grade students nationwide can perform the math
problems expected of their grade level, according to a federal survey released
today.;    "This is an alarm bell that ought to ring all night throughout this
country," said Education Secretary Lamar Alexander. "If our aim is to be first
in the world in math and science by the year 2000, there is an enormous
challenge ahead of us."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Alexander explained that even in the top performing states only one out of
four students could solve problems involving fractions, decimals, percents,
elementary geometry and simple algebra.;    In California, 95 percent of the
students could perform simple problems involving whole numbers and 56 percent
could multiply and solve two-step problems. But only 11 percent could work
problems involving fractions, decimals, percents, elementary algebra and
simple geometry; and none could perform algebraic equations or work with
geometric relationships.;    "The results provide solid evidence that far too
many students take general math, which is way too weak for the 8th grade
level," said Bill Honig, California Superintendent of Public Instruction.
"Across the board, in all skill areas measured, for all ethnic and
socio-economic groups, students who are introduced to algebra and geometry far
outperformed their classmates who take general math.";    The National
Assessment, popularly known as the Nation's Report Card, for the first time
issued state-by-state results for eighth graders in 37 states, the District of
Columbia, Guam and the Virgin Islands.;    The survey showed that nationally
just 14 percent of eighth graders were at the level educators say should be
average proficiency -- able to solve problems involving fractions, decimals,
percentages, elementary geometry and simple algebra.;    At the same time, 98
percent of the students could solve simple problems with whole numbers and 67
percent could multiply and solve two-step problems. Less than 1 percent could
perform algebraic equations or simple geometry.;    Students in North Dakota
outperformed the 39 other states and territories in the educational progress
survey, with 24 percent achieving average proficiency. That means the students
were able to solve problems that involve fractions, decimals, percentages,
elementary geometry and simple algebra. Such material commonly is introduced
in the seventh grade.;    Only one state, Virginia, had eighth-grade students
performing advanced math.;    In the state breakdown, Montana had 23 percent
of its eighth graders with average proficiency, followed by Iowa and Nebraska
with 21 percent, and Minnesota and Wisconsin with 20 percent.;    President
Bush and the nation's state governors have established the goal of making
American students first in the world in mathematics and science by the year
2000.;    The national assessment is likely to further fuel criticism of the
nation's educational system.;    Boyd said the results show that
higher-performing states tend to have fewer students in large city schools and
fewer students living in poverty.;    Mandated by Congress, the National
Assessment of Educational Progress is the only national and continuing
assessment of what America's students know and can do in various subjects.;   
Congress called for the assessment at the state level on a trial basis for
1990 and 1992 when it reauthorized the program.;    About 100 schools and
2,500 students were sampled in each of the participating states in February
1990. The results placed students at level 200 if they performed simple
addition and problem solving with whole numbers and level 250 if they
performed simple multiplication and two-step problem solving.;    Level 300
was being able to solve problems that involve fractions, decimals, percents,
elementary geometry and simple algebra. Level 350 was for students who can
perform algebraic equations, beginning statistics and probability, reasoning
and problem solving involving geometric relationships.;    For the separate
national mathematics assessment, there were 6,473 students in grades four,
eight and 12 in about 400 schools. The testing was done from January to May
1990.;    In both Montana and North Dakota, all of the eighth-grade students
mastered the first level and 88 percent mastered the second level. Iowa had
100 percent at level 200 and 84 percent at level 250. Nebraska and Minnesota
had 99 percent at the first level but 81 percent and 82 percent at level 250.;
   Nationally, 98 percent reached level 200 and 67 percent mastered level
250.;    The percentages of students in other states that reached level 300
were: 19 in New Jersey and Connecticut; 18 in Oregon; 17 New Hampshire; 15 in
Idaho, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wyoming; 14 in Maryland, Colorado and
Indiana; 13 in Delaware and Michigan; 12 in Rhode Island, Illinois, Georgia
and Ohio; 10 in Arizona, Florida, Texas and Oklahoma; 8 in New Mexico and
Kentucky; and 7 in Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina and West Virginia.;    In
other results, the study found:;    (check) 61 percent of the 12th grade
students did not take four years of high school mathematics; 17 percent did
not take algebra at all.;    (check) By 12th grade, 100 percent had mastered
the addition and problem solving of early elementary school math; 91 percent
could handle the multiplication and two-step problem solving of upper
elementary school arithmetic; 46 percent of 12th graders had mastered the more
complex material of Level 300.; Math statistics;  Here is a list of
eighth-grade math achievement levels based on a survey of the National
Assessment by Educational Progress.    The numbers are percentages of students
mastering achievement levels. Not all states took part in the survey.; Place
