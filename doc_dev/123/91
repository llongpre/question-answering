<LEADPARA>  On behalf of European-Americans in San Jose, I want to say thank you for
recognizing that Americans of European origin are having problems with job
skills, education, language and poverty. European-origin Americans make up
approximately 28 percent of the so-called underclass of America, yet almost no
public discourse is dedicated to their plight.;    That is why I particularly
appreciated your story (Mercury News, May 12) about three single-parent
families, one of which was unmistakably about a European-American mother. And
I was glad to see the story pointing out that poverty also afflicts those of
us from European ethnic and racial backgrounds (Mercury News, May 10).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The dirty little secret of us European-Americans is that, contrary to
published images, our ethnic group includes lots of low-income and
no-job-skills people. Let's stop the pretense that if your ancestors are from
Europe that you will automatically be successful in this society.;    -- Dale
Warner; San Jose; MATH STANDARDS JUST DON'T ADD UP; Judging by the examples
given, the proposed national math standards (Mercury News, May 11) are
ridiculously easy and must have given any Japanese, Chinese or European
readers a good laugh.;    For example, the proposed advanced 12th grade
questions meant that the student should know (but not necessarily be able to
prove) the Pythagorean Theorem, an elementary formula in geometry that anyone
can memorize. This would be more appropriate for advanced 8th graders than
12th graders.;    Advanced 12th graders should have a good working knowledge
of algebra, geometry, trigonometry and the beginnings of calculus; if possible
they should have studied a full year of calculus.;    If the National
Assessment Governing Board really believes that advanced 12th graders --
presumably the nation's future engineers and scientists -- only need to
understand simple plane geometry and algebra, they should resign; they are
part of the problem, not part of the solution.;    -- Park Chamberlain;
Cupertino; THE COMICS AREN'T SO COMIC ANYMORE; Many of us use the comics to
dilute the bad news in the rest of the paper. Lately, however, some of the
comics have become political or social commentaries, sex education forums, or
just meaningless scribblings.;    Some years ago you periodically ran surveys
to poll the readers on their comics preferences. Do you dare to again let us
express our opinions?;    -- Audrey Lee Dick; San Jose; WHY EXPECT SCHOOLS TO
TEACH RELIGION?; I am responding to Clement Butt's letter (May 13) and all
those who believe that without prayer in schools we are on our way down the
path to perdition.;    I am in total agreement with the recent state Supreme
Court ruling on this issue. I would ask Butt and all of his ilk, why schools?
Why not prayer in the home instead? Certainly in the close confines of a
loving home, the true values of the parents can be better taught by word and
deed, while not subjecting others to their beliefs.;    Schools should teach
"readin', writin' and 'rithmetic," and not be called upon to be a substitute
for the parents who abrogate their responsibility to teach ethics and moral
values, i.e., religion.;    -- Shirley M. Odom; Santa Clara; SOME DEDUCTIONS
AREN'T 'LOOPHOLES'; Mercury News Staff Writer Gary Webb quotes a study by a
legislative analyst which condemns those taxpayers who use loopholes to reduce
their taxes (Mercury News, May 10).;    A loophole is defined as a means of
evading an obligation. I don't consider taking advantage of lawful statutes
enacted by our Legislature, such as deducting your home mortgage interest, as
an evasion.;    Nor do I believe, from my 18 years as a tax preparer, that
only the rich own their own homes. In my opinion, a large percentage of the
population could not afford their homes if the interest were not deductible.
This deduction promotes home ownership, which is a deeply rooted and desirable
value in our American society.;    The trend in government is to reduce or
eliminate many types of deductions as a back door method of raising taxes.
Printing these distortions only makes it easier for them to continue doing so
with little opposition.;    -- Dean M. Lumbert; San Jose  </TEXT>
