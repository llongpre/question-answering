<LEADPARA>  LOOK AT any of the so-called critical technologies you want -- biotechnology,
new materials, software, etc. -- and the cheapest, most cost-effective and
influential investment America could make in industrial competitiveness
remains in mathematics. Few things are as powerful -- or as profitable -- as
an equation whose time has come.;   The Black-Scholes options pricing formula
-- which lets financial engineers craft new securities and sniff out arbitrage
opportunities between old ones -- has transformed the flow of trillions of
dollars in global capital markets. The Reed-Solomon algorithm determines the
fidelity of music and data in millions of computers and compact disc players.
The emerging non-linear equations of Chaos Theory provide practical insights
into the physics of the heart and the future of the environment.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     As much as the cost of capital or any presidential directive, obscure
equations shape the effectiveness and competitiveness of U.S. industry. While
America has tremendous mathematical talent and resources, you wouldn't know it
from the way they have been applied.;   "We lead the world in this area," says
Louis Auslander, who recently directed mathematical research for the
Pentagon's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. "It's a great advantage
for us, but we're not using it.";   We should be taking that advantage and
using it to create technologies and market opportunities. In the same way that
new mathematics redefined finance, mathematics should be redefining our
competitiveness in engineering and molecular biology. Universities should be
creating departments of "mathematical engineering" to give people tools to
manage the complexity of assembly lines. More companies should be teaming
mathematicians with their engineers and innovators.;   Unfortunately, most
companies simply can't figure out what to do with mathematics -- or they
believe that mathematics is statistics for quality control. They think of
mathematics as a set of cold equations that freezes observations into
unambiguous numbers rather than as a rich language that gives people new ways
to describe reality.;   "Mathematicians have forgotten where their problems
came from," says Avner Friedman, who directs the University of Minnesota's
Institute for Mathematics and its Applications, which is explicitly looking at
how to link mathematics with real-world problems.;   Unfortunately, Friedman
says, "the dominant attitude" in mathematics today is that relevance is more
nice than necessary.;   "Most mathematics departments are very narrow,"
Friedman says. "Only a small percentage of people are seeking collaboration
with the outside world. Integration has not yet taken root.";   That's not to
say that pure mathematics -- that is, mathematics based on mathematics itself,
rather than on real-world problems -- is irrelevant or wasteful. For example,
work in topological "knot theory" -- the computational geometry of knots --
has given a new context for biologists to consider the design of proteins, the
building blocks of life.;   In a tasty irony, the great Victorian
mathematician G.H. Hardy -- who reveled in the irrelevance of his elegant
mathematics -- created equations that have had enormous impact on the
development of control theory, the complex branch of mathematics that yields
the software enabling ultra-sophisticated planes to fly. No matter how
beautiful or elegant, it seems that mathematics can't escape relevance.;  
"One has to wonder whether the mathematical thoughts that our brains are
thinking reflect a certain underlying natural order or pattern that leads to
virtually all our mathematics becoming applicable at some time or another,"
says Howard L. Resnikoff, a former UC-Irvine mathematics department chairman
who runs Aware, a mathematics firm in Cambridge, Mass.;   However, there is
now a gross imbalance between mathematics for the sake of mathematics and
mathematics driven by problems posed by complex realities.;   "I don't think
there's anything preventing a Caltech, a Berkeley, a Stanford or an MIT from
starting a department of mathematical engineering," Resnikoff says. Auslander
asserts that for as little as $5 million, you can launch a new area of
research in multi-disciplinary mathematics. You can lure people into examining
the interesting classes of problems that the reality of a complex assembly
line or a intracellular transport mechanism can offer.;   "We don't need more
mathematicians," says Auslander, a distinguished mathematics professor at City
University of New York. "We need more mathematicians with a different
attitude.";   But we also need more policy-makers and corporate managers who
understand that the numbers that can really make a difference to industrial
innovation and competitiveness aren't just found in the accounting books. The
real power and beauty of mathematics isn't in the way it can describe reality
-- it's in the way it can be used to improve reality.  </TEXT>
