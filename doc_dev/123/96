SCIENTISTS SEEK AN OUT-OF-THIS WORLD 'GREETING CARD' TO COMMUNICATE WITH ALIENS

Scientists have been avidly debating how to communicate with aliens from outer 
space in a city where a long-distance telephone call to fellow earthlings is 
hard enough. 
</P>
<P>
Last month's 41st International Astronautical Congress in Dresden, eastern 
Germany, was dedicated to ensuring that if little green beings ever show up on 
telescopes, or doorsteps, we will be prepared. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to assume two things about them: They have radio technology and can 
count," said Carl DeVito, a mathematics professor from Arizona University. 
</P>
<P>
The latest IAC, which annually reviews progress in space exploration, evaluated 
efforts to invent a new language for communicating with creatures from another 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, the scientists chose a venue where the antiquated telephone system 
of what was formerly East Germany made it difficult to contact families and 
friends by long-distance phone calls, let alone make contact with aliens. 
</P>
<P>
With their smart Western suits and shiny blue name tags, the scientists 
themselves stood out like extraterrestrials among the shabbily dressed locals. 
</P>
<P>
The weeklong congress, which was opened by German Science Minister Heinz 
Riesenhuber, drew thousands of delegates. 
</P>
<P>
Flying saucers may be the stuff of science fiction, but scientists have long 
presumed that someone else is out there somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Voyager space probe spun off into outer space in the 1970s carrying 
pictures depicting life on Earth and a recorded message from then U.N. 
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim. 
</P>
<P>
There has been no response so far. But Jill Tarter, a scientist from the Search 
for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) institute, said Earth should start 
preparing for how to react when we discover we are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nobody who writes international greeting cards, but we have to find 
one for the world," she told a committee reviewing SETI's work, which is 
financed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. 
</P>
<P>
Tarter said the U.N. should adopt guidelines telling humans how to approach 
their first alien. 
</P>
<P>
Her paper admitted that some may think there would be little point to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
"In the absence of compelling evidence of an extraterrestrial intelligence, it 
may be difficult to sustain high-level interest in this issue," the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
NASA launched an $80-million project in 1982 to transmit signals to aliens in 
outer space, but scientists at the congress said more taxpayer money was needed 
to pick up the long-awaited response. 
</P>
<P>
German scientist Sebastien von Hoerner said Earth needs a huge radiotelescope 
in its southern hemisphere, costing millions of dollars, to speed up the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
But the hardest part remains unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to say something but we don't know how," DeVito said. 
</P>
<P>
Previous research on communicating with aliens focused on trying to teach 
extraterrestrials a language. That was the aim of Dutch mathematician Hans 
Freudenthal, who wrote a book on a "language for cosmic intercourse." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the promising subject of this pioneering work of the 1960s, DeVito 
said, its approach was too slow. 
</P>
<P>
It would be quicker to seek common ground with whatever arrived, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The basic problem is how to get out of our brains and into reality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Aliens should be presented with a picture of reality, with captions 
representing the image in a scientific or mathematical language, he said. 
</P>
<P>
His approach is based on the principle of the Rosetta stone, a plaque found in 
the Egyptian desert in 1799 by Napoleonic troops. 
</P>
<P>
The stone had Egyptian hieroglyphics translated into two other languages, 
enabling scholars to decipher the ancient language of the Pharaohs for modern 
man. 
</P>
<P>
DeVito would first like to confront any little green beings with an image 
showing an ocean, then an ice field followed by an iceberg. Each picture has a 
caption.
