   President Bush urged top math and science
teachers Tuesday to ``take children, lift them up, inspire them,
broaden their horizons and aim them'' toward careers as scientists
and engineers.
   ``You discovered how to bring out the fun in science,'' Bush
told 107 elementary teachers who gathered in the Rose Garden after
receiving Presidential Awards for Excellence in Science and
Mathematics Teaching. ``You provide a model and an inspiration for
elementary teachers everywhere.''
   ``You're also helping to meet a crucial national need,'' said
Bush, noting that three of the national education goals involve
boosting student achievement in math and science by the year 2000.
   Statistics show that by 1995, eight of the 10 fastest growing
professions will be based on science. Skills in mathematics and a
college education will be needed for a majority of the 21 million
new jobs created by the U.S. economy by the year 2000, says the
National Research Council.
   By the year 2010, U.S. industry will face a shortage of 560,000
scientists and engineers, other statistics show.
   ``For many students you represent their very first exposure to
science and math, which gives you a vital responsibility,'' Bush
continued. ``Most kids who go on to become scientists or engineers
first became interested in those subjects in elementary school or
junior high. Most often the reason they do is because they become
exposed to a teacher like you.''
   ``You are able to take children and lift them up, inspire them
and broaden their horizons and aim them ...,'' he said.
   The presidential awards program, sponsored by the National
Science Foundation and managed by the National Science Teachers
Association, began eight years ago. Each teacher receives a $7,500
grant.
   Elementary teachers are included for the first time this year in
the program. Middle and senior high school science and mathematics
teachers will be honored in mid-October.
