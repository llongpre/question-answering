FT  08 JAN 92 / Letter: Education: the casualties and the consensus

Sir, Your leader on Kenneth Clarke's plans to change the teacher training
system in the UK ('Education and the election', January 6) rightly refers to
them as 'panicky electioneering'.
In the subject I represent, mathematics, there is little support for yet
more change in the schools and on the cheap. Already Mr Clarke's policies
have guaranteed that we will be short of mathematics teachers for the
foreseeable future. He has ensured that those mathematics teachers who are
still teaching will be so overworked, overburdened with bureaucracy, and
stressed, that they will have little time, energy or enthusiasm left to take
on other responsibilities. His new plans are unlikely to stem the flow of
experienced teachers out of school and will not attract more newcomers into
mathematics teaching.
What these plans will do is change Britain from a country which has many of
the best-trained maths teachers in Europe to one having many of the
worst-trained. Teacher trainers come from all countries to study and learn
from our methods and our professional approaches are admired worldwide.
Some politicians do recognise the complex nature of learning to teach
successfully a subject like mathematics to all children. Mr Clarke clearly
doesn't, and his ideological actions should be questioned by all who
understand the nature of professional responsibility.
