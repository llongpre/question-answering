<LEADPARA>  When Jose Antonio Valdes began teaching math at San Jose's Andrew Hill High
School in 1974, he was told he couldn't have a calculus class because it was
the barrio.;   He was told his students couldn't learn calculus because many
of them couldn't read.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     He made it his life's work to prove that theory wrong.;   Valdes, the man
who taught others diligence, perseverance and faith, died at his home Thursday
after a two-year battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 63.;   "He's always
been a fighter -- he's never given up on anything," said his daughter Sylvia.
"And as sick as he was, he fought it. His two loves have always been education
and his family.";   The first summer, about 500 students graduated; by last
summer, about 800. During graduation, Valdes sat in the back of the auditorium
because he knew he would cry at the sight of all those beaming young faces on
stage. "What was important to him was kids and especially mathematics, which
was his love," said Cari Vaeth, associate principal at Andrew Hill High
School, where Valdes worked until last June. "He took these 6th, 7th and 8th
graders and put them in a seven-week, all-math program so they could build
their skills, so they could enter high school at the level of algebra.";   To
carry on Valdes' legacy, the institute is setting its sights higher, hoping
someday to reach every freshman entering the 21,000-student East Side Union
High School District. Sylvia Valdes said her father's philosophy -- that
teachers must believe every student can learn -- was the secret to his
success.;   "It wasn't based on rhetoric, and he didn't do it for attention,"
she said. "He just spoke the truth and he did it for the sole reason of
helping students.";   Other educators learned from him as well.;   "He
believed there was no such thing as 'blacks can't learn mathematics' or
'Hispanics can't learn mathematics'," Vaeth said. "His belief was, if the kids
developed those study skills and that drive to learn, that would carry them
through the rest of their lives.";   His colleagues described him as a man of
tremendous patience, who always had a smile or a few words of wisdom for his
students. Above all, they described him as a humble man -- and a modest one.; 
 In fact, when the California Association for Bilingual Education named him
Teacher of the Year in 1989, Valdes described the honor as "kind of
embarrassing because I think there are hundreds of good bilingual teachers who
deserve that award. How many are doing a good job every day with those kids
and are never recognized?";   He began his career as a high school calculus
teacher in the Pinar del Rio province of Cuba. After Fidel Castro came to
power, he fled communism, arriving penniless in San Francisco in 1962. After
45 days of walking up and down Market Street looking for work, he got a job
sorting used tickets for Greyhound Bus Lines. He worked his way up to baggage
agent for 11 Western states.;   But unhappiness plagued him because he wasn't
teaching. He went to San Jose State University and earned a teaching
certificate, and landed at Andrew Hill in 1974.;   Soon, he realized he rarely
saw Hispanics or blacks in his trigonometry and calculus classes, something he
said left "an emptiness inside." In 1980, he began spending his summers
teaching at the Mathematics, Engineering and Science Achievement program at
San Jose State University, a precursor to the Valdes Institute for high school
students.;   Valdes resigned as a math teacher at Andrew Hill High School last
June. Last summer was the first he couldn't be a part of the institute he
helped create.;   "I don't think any words can express the impact he had on
(his students)," said Alberto Verduzco, a sophomore at San Jose State who was
a student of Valdes in the summer of 1987. "His impact goes way beyond math --
it goes down to the character of the person. Because of him, many people have
built up determination, courage and the desire to go on and change things.;  
"That's what he did for me.";   Valdes is survived by his wife Silvia, his
children Jose Jr., Sylvia, and Barbara McKinnon, and five grandchildren.;
