   State gaming regulators have fined a
casino $250,000 for removing black and women employees from a table
at the request of a big-stakes player.
   The penalty approved unanimously by the Casino Control
Commission on Wednesday stopped short of the closure suggested by
the state Division of Gaming Enforcement, which did not propose any
length to a shutdown.
   However, it exceeded an administrative law judge's
recommendation that the casino be fined $15,600, the amount lost by
Robert LiButti, the player in question.
   The fine was the second largest in New Jersey's 11-year casino
history. The largest was a $257,000 penalty issued against Caesars
for allowing a patron to play from inside the pit, among other
charges.
   In 1985, the gaming hall became the only casino to be closed for
a day when it allowed a patron to lose more than $7 million without
checking his source of credit.
   ``A suspension of the operation certificate is not warranted in
this instance,'' said commission Chairman Walter N. Read. ``But the
evidence also establishes sufficiently aggravating circumstances to
warrant nothing less than maximum penalties.''
   Read cited ``the inherently abhorrent nature of race- and
sex-based discrimination'' and the gaming hall's catering to high
rollers. The commission decision also requires Caesars to conduct a
training program emphasizing how to deal with high-rollers.
   LiButti, a 57-year-old thoroughbred horse consultant from Saddle
River, has said through his attorney that he never asked for the
removal of dealers.
   He is suing Caesars and the Division of Gaming Enforcement for
making the allegations.
   The gaming division's discrimination complaint against Caesars
charges that on two occasions in May 1988, Caesars removed black
and women craps workers to accommodate LiButti.
   Although the ruling was unanimous, W. David Waters, the lone
black member of the five-person commission, questioned its impact
on Caesars.
   ``It is obvious that organizational or corporate penalties
represent nothing more than the cost of doing business,'' Waters
said. ``If violations of this sort occur in the future, I think
this commission must consider assessing penalties against top
management in order to hold them personally accountable.''
   Caesars attorney Gregory Parliman said he was ``pleased that the
commission decided not to accept the recommendation to suspend the
license.''
   The casino collects about $851,000 a day from patrons before
expenses.
   Joel Respes, the black floorperson who was replaced, also said
he was satisfied by the ruling.
   ``I'm happier with this decision than a $15,000 fine,'' Respes
said.
   Respes, 36, said he still works for Caesars, but added it has
not been easy.
   ``I was vey humiliated,'' he said. ``My pride was hurt. I
couldn't believe the company would do such a thing.''
