   Martin T. Sosnoff said he had discussions with Pratt Hotel Corp. and Southmark Corp. about a possible joint venture to acquire Caesars World Inc. 

   The money manager and investor said that he, Pratt and Southmark may jointly discuss with Caesars World a "friendly" transaction in which the three would "participate on an equal basis" in a joint venture. 

   The discussions among the three parties "are not currently being actively pursued," Mr. Sosnoff said in a news release. 
He added that it was uncertain whether talks would resume in the future. 
While Mr. Sosnoff didn't say when the discussions had occurred, Pratt is understood to have initiated the talks about two weeks ago. 
Southmark, which owns 36% of Pratt, was brought in soon after. 

   Mr. Sosnoff wasn't available to comment, but a source close to him said "these guys (Pratt and Southmark) approached him and he thought it could be a good deal." 

   Dallas-based Pratt is a hotel and casino owner. 
Southmark, also based in Dallas, has interests in real estate and financial services, and is a major hotel franchisee. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff's $28-a-share tender offer for Caesars World, a Los Angeles-based gambling concern, was rejected as "inadequate" last week. 
He is Caesars World's largest shareholder -- with a 13.6% stake. 

   A Caesars World spokesman declined comment on Mr. Sosnoff's statement. 

   Separately, Mr. Sosnoff said he extended the expiration date of his offer for the Caesars World common stock he doesn't already own to 12:01 a.m. 
May 16 EST. 
The offer had been scheduled to expire on April 3. 
So far, Mr. Sosnoff said, "only a negligible number of shares have been tendered" under the offer, which began earlier this month. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World's common closed at $28.75, down 87.5 cents. 
Some Wall Street traders said that any Southmark and Pratt involvement with Mr. Sosnoff would make it less likely that a bidding war for Caesars would erupt. 

   Caesars World's financial adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., is understood to have contacted a number of companies to drum up interest in a friendly purchase of Caesars. 
Southmark was among the companies that Drexel contacted in the past two weeks, sources said. 

   William S. Friedman, vice chairman of Southmark, said that "a prime factor in our getting involved is that we're licensed (to operate casinos) in both New Jersey and Nevada," where Caesars World has hotels. 

   Jack E. Pratt Sr., Pratt chairman, said Pratt and Southmark will say today in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that they are having talks with Mr. Sosnoff on a possible joint venture. 
He said the companies "plan to work with Caesars on a friendly basis." 

   Mr. Sosnoff said that "several preliminary contacts" with Caesars World representatives haven't "resulted in any indication that (Caesars World) wishes to" negotiate with him, Pratt or Southmark. 

   The New York investor's bid had been conditioned on his obtaining approval to control casinos from gaming authorities in New Jersey and Nevada. 
Mr. Sosnoff said yesterday that he hasn't been assured that "the necessary regulatory review would be completed on or prior to the original expiration date" of his tender offer. 
He said if the approval process is delayed, he may have to again extend the expiration date. 

   A source familiar with both Southmark and Pratt said that while Mr. Sosnoff could raise the $725.2 million needed to complete his offer, the investor felt "he needed an experienced hotel operator to convince people he was serious about really" buying Caesars World.
