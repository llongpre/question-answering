   Caesars World Inc.'s decision to drop its $960 million recapitalization plan in favor of a stock buy-back was praised by financial analysts, although the stock market reaction was less sanguine. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World shares closed at $29.50, up 25 cents, on volume of 749,600 shares. 

   Under the original recapitalization, devised to fend off an unwanted takeover bid from New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff, Caesars holders would have received a one-time dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
The tender offer that replaced that plan will be at prices between $29.50 and $34 a share, or a total of between $325 million to $374 million for 11 million of Caesars 35.2 million shares outstanding. 

   "This is probably what Caesars should have done in the beginning," said Harold Vogel, a securities analyst with Merrill Lynch Inc., New York. 
He said the new plan leaves the hotel-casino concern with far less debt and would be more acceptable to New Jersey and Nevada gambling regulators, if regulators need to approve the buy-back at all. 

   The earlier recapitalization plan was rejected by New Jersey gambling regulators Aug. 12 on the grounds that it loaded Caesars with debt while lacking a clear business purpose and serving to "greatly enrich and permanently entrench" current management. 

   Caesars, operator of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., and Caesars Atlantic City in New Jersey, needed both states' approval for the recapitalization. 
After announcing the tender offer, the company said it planned to withdraw an application for the New Jersey Casino Control Commission to rehear the recapitalization case. 
Caesars said it doesn't believe the stock buy-back requires state regulatory approval. 

   New Jersey Casino Control Commission Chairman Walter N. Read said he wasn't sure whether the commission would need to approve the plan. 
He said Caesars "has obviously gotten rid of some of the things we objected to in the recapitalization," but he declined to say whether he favors the buy-back. 
Nevada gambling officials weren't available for comment. 

   Industry observers said that the buy-back leaves Caesars more vulnerable to a takeover attempt than it would have been under a recapitalization. 
The buy-back "provides less of a guarantee" against takeover attempts, said Mr. Vogel of Merrill Lynch. 
He added, however, that "I don't see anyone coming in after these gaming companies now anyhow because of the enormous licensing problems." 

   Mr. Vogel, however, didn't rule out the possibility of Mr. Sosnoff making another pass at Caesars. 
Mr. Sosnoff holds 4.2 million Caesars shares, or about 12% of the total outstanding, and his stake would increase to 17.4% if he didn't tender shares under the company's offer. 

   Mr. Sosnoff hasn't been available for comment since Caesars announced plans for the tender offer Monday. 

   But Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst with Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., said he "can't see Sosnoff jumping in at all." 
Mr. Roffman said he believes Mr. Sosnoff "saw the writing on the wall" when the New Jersey commission rejected the Caesars plan, and thus wouldn't tempt the same fate by renewing his highly leveraged bid. 
Mr. Roffman said the state commission ruling delivered a message that "we don't want someone coming in here and leveraging up a company to take control of it." 

   Under the buy-back, which began yesterday, Caesars will purchase about 31% of its shares outstanding through a so-called Dutch auction tender offer. 
Caesars will accept the shares in the order of the prices that holders have specified, within the stated range, until total shares tendered reach 11 million. 
The highest price required to reach the total will then be paid to holders of all the shares accepted. 
The offer ends at 12:01 a.m. EDT Oct. 6, unless extended. 

   The stock market reaction to the new plan "shows that the arbitragers, who seem to be the dominant holders, are disappointed that Caesars isn't pursuing another recapitalization," said Mark Manson, an analyst with New York-based Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. 
But he said the buy-back leaves Caesars a "fairly attractive" investment, with a much stronger balance sheet and healthier earnings potential than if the company had followed through with the recapitalization.
