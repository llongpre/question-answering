   Caesars World Inc.'s stock price rose sharply yesterday, indicating that investors expect competing bids to follow New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff's $28-a-share offer for the Los Angeles-based gambling concern. 

   Meanwhile, Henry Gluck, chairman of Caesars, said the company's board will study the Sosnoff offer with legal and financial advisers before making a recommendation to holders. 
A spokesman declined to comment further on Mr. Sosnoff's offer, valued at $725.2 million, for the Caesars shares he doesn't already own. 

   Mr. Sosnoff holds a 13.6% stake in Caesars, or about 4.1 million of the 30 million shares outstanding. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars common closed at $27.75 a share, up $3.25, on volume of 3.3 million shares. 

   Some securities analysts who follow the gambling industry suggested that higher bids are likely and that Mr. Sosnoff might have positioned himself to turn a profit on his current Caesars stake. 

   "He hasn't ever bought and run a company, and he probably would accept a higher offer for his shares," Dennis Forst of Los Angeles-based Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. said. 
He said yesterday's trading, in which Caesars shares rose as high as $28.50 before easing slightly, suggests that Wall Street believes "this is the first salvo (in bidding for Caesars), but not the last." 

   Mr. Forst said he believes Caesars management "definitely prefers to remain independent and build the company along current lines." 

   Marvin B. Roffman of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., Philadelphia, said acquiring Caesars at $28 a share would be "a steal." 
He said he believes Mr. Sosnoff's real goal is "to make money buying undervalued situations" rather than by operating casinos. 

   Among parties analysts mentioned as possible competing bidders are Los Angeles investor Kirk Kerkorian's Tracinda Corp. and Las Vegas, Nev.-based Golden Nugget Inc., both of which have experience with the kind of luxury hotel-casino operations that Caesars World represents. 

   A spokesman for Mr. Kerkorian, however, said Tracinda isn't interested in bidding for Caesars, which operates the Caesars Palace casino in Las Vegas among other properties and owns 86.6% of Caesars New Jersey Inc. Golden Nugget officials couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, who made his offer through newly formed MTS Acquisition Corp., continued to insist yesterday that his offer is "for real" and dismissed speculation that it might be an attempt to put Caesars in play in the takeover field. 

   The investor also gave some details of his financing plans, which he said involve loan commitments valid for six months. 
In a letter to Mr. Gluck, he said Marine Midland Bank had agreed to lend $100 million for the acquisition and to use its "best efforts" to syndicate an additional $400 million in loans. 

   Mr. Sosnoff also said in the letter that his financial adviser, PaineWebber Inc., had said in writing that, "subject to market conditions," it is "highly confident" it can arrange commitments for as much as $475 million in financing. 
He said the offer "provides a fair and generous opportunity for all the company's shareholders to maximize the value of their investment." 

   He made the tender offer for Caesars without consulting the company or its board, Mr. Sosnoff said, because his advisers had "repeatedly stressed" the Caesars management's "lack of responsiveness in the past." 

   Caesars World, which last year turned down Mr. Sosnoff's request for a seat on the board, retained Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. to help study the offer. 
Although Drexel traditionally has served as its investment banker, the firm also has represented Mr. Sosnoff before. 
It managed the investor's initial public offering last year of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp., of which Mr. Sosnoff is chairman. 

   Mr. Sosnoff vigorously denied a report that he had tried to sell his Caesars stake to New York real estate developer Donald Trump. 
A source close to Mr. Trump yesterday said he had been offered the Sosnoff stake "within the last month." 
Mr. Sosnoff said: "That's absolutely incorrect. 
I haven't talked to Donald Trump at all about Caesars." 
He said Mr. Trump's attorney called him about two months ago, but said, "I never returned the call." 

   Separately, Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said they were considering downgrading Caesars World debt ratings because of the Sosnoff offer. 

   Moody's said it is reviewing its single-B-1 rating on about $215 million of subordinated debt of Caesars World and its Caesars World Finance Corp. subsidiary. 
S&amp;P said it placed a total of about $231 million of Caesars World and the finance unit's debt on its CreditWatch list with negative implications. 
Ratings under study by S&amp;P are double-B on Caesars World senior debt and single-B-plus on subordinated debt of Caesars World and the unit.
