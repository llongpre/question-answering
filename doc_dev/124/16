   Caesars World Inc. said its shareholders approved the company's proposed $960 million recapitalization plan and payment of a special dividend of $26.25 a share. 

   The hotel and casino operator said 17.5 million shares were voted in favor of both the plan and dividend and 4.6 million were voted against. 
Among the shares voted in dissent were 4.2 million held by Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, a Caesars spokesman said. 
Caesars had 30.5 million common shares outstanding as of April 30. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff last month dropped his sweetened $35-a-share bid for the company, saying he could no longer justify the cost to himself and the company of continuing the $1.11 billion takeover effort. 
A week earlier, a federal judge in Los Angeles enjoined Mr. Sosnoff from continuing his tender offer on the ground that it violated a Federal Reserve Board rule governing the financing of corporate takeovers. 

   Caesars said regulatory officials in New Jersey and Nevada have yet to approve the recapitalization and dividend, which the company designed to fend off Mr. Sosnoff's advances. 
The New Jersey Casino Control Commission is scheduled to review the plan next week, although Caesars said it doesn't expect the commission to reach a decision until the end of the month. 

   The Nevada Gaming Commission is scheduled to consider next Thursday the Nevada Gaming Control Board's recommendation that the plan be approved.
