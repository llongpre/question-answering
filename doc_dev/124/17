   Martin T. Sosnoff, whose sweetened $32-a-share tender offer for Caesars World Inc. was rebuffed, said he is soliciting shareholder consent to remove the company's inside directors. 

   In a letter to Caesars holders, Mr. Sosnoff said he is seeking to remove four of the company's nine directors, "leaving in place a truly independent board that can review my amended offer and any other alternatives available to the company." 

   In the letter, the New York investor and money manager said that the company's inside directors "have demonstrated that they are not principally motivated by the sincere desire to assure that shareholders receive maximum value for their shares." 

   To succeed, Mr. Sosnoff needs votes of consent from a majority of Caesars' 30.2 million shares outstanding. 
As the largest shareholder of the hotel and casino operator, Mr. Sosnoff already owns four million shares, or 13.3% of the common shares outstanding. 
His latest tender offer expires June 19. 
In accordance with Caesars' bylaws, stock of record March 27 is eligible to vote. 

   The directors Mr. Sosnoff seeks to remove are Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer; J. Terrence Lanni, president and chief operating officer; Philip Ball, senior vice president and general counsel; and M. Peter Schweitzer, vice chairman. 

   In Los Angeles, Caesars had no immediate comment on Mr. Sosnoff's letter. 

   Earlier this week, in a petition filed with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, Mr. Sosnoff unveiled plans to cut back some of Caesars' operations if his takeover is successful. 

   Among the suggested cuts, Mr. Sosnoff said he would close Caesars' Los Angeles corporate headquarters because it is "unnecessary in an industry where operational decision-making occurs on-site." 
He indicated, however, that he would encourage "substantially all of the existing management" to remain with the company. 

   Mr. Sosnoff also said he possibly would discontinue the company's operations unrelated to its hotel and casino businesses, including investments in retailing and some limited food service operations. 
He said the cuts could save Caesars between $5 million and $7 million annually. 

   To counter Mr. Sosnoff's original $28-a-share takeover bid, Caesars World proposed a recapitalization that included a one-time cash dividend of $25 a share and the assumption of about $1 billion new debt. 

   In rejecting Mr. Sosnoff's sweetened $932.2 million tender offer bid earlier this month, Caesars said it might sweeten its recapitalization plan, which some Wall Street traders have valued at $30 to $31.50 a share. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars closed unchanged yesterday at $32.25 a share. 

   Consent solicitations are used infrequently as alternatives to proxy battles. 
Only a few states permit such solicitations, including Florida, where Caesars is incorporated. 
The consent process "is an unusual approach with inconsistent results," said John Gavin, executive vice president of D.F. King &amp; Co., a New York proxy solicitation concern. 

   Asher Edelman used a consent solicitation in his successful bid to win control of Datapoint Corp. in 1985. 
Joseph A. Frates, an Oklahoma City investor, failed in his attempt to get shareholder consent to take control of Kaiser Aluminum &amp; Chemical Corp. last year. 
And Irwin Jacobs, the Minneapolis investor, also was unsuccessful in using a solicitation in his abortive bid for Pabst Brewing Co. in 1982.
