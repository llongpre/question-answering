   Caesars World Inc. said investor Martin T. Sosnoff missed the deadline to present written consents from shareholders to remove the company's inside directors. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff, who is making a $32-a-share hostile tender offer for the gambling concern, last month began soliciting shareholder consents to remove from Caesars' nine-member board Henry Gluck, Caesars' chairman and chief executive officer; J. Terrence Lanni, president and chief operating officer; Philip Ball, senior vice president and general counsel; and M. Peter Schweitzer, vice chairman. 

   Mr. Sosnoff also wanted to amend certain provisions of Caesars' articles of incorporation and bylaws. 

   Under Caesars' bylaws, written consents must be presented by the 60th day following the solicitation. 
The record date for the New York investor and money manager's consent solicitation was March 27; the deadline was Tuesday. 

   Consent solicitations are used infrequently as alternatives to proxy battles, and just a handful of states permit them, including Florida, where Caesars is incorporated. 

   Separately, Caesars said a number of meetings had been scheduled that will relate to the company's petition for approval of a nearly $1 billion recapitalization plan. 

   The plan, designed to thwart Mr. Sosnoff's takeover attempt, would require Caesars to incur $960 million of new debt, and would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 

   The New Jersey Casino Control Commission tentatively scheduled a June 16 special meeting to review the petition. 

   The gaming commission also will review Mr. Sosnoff's petition for approval of his tender offer. 

   In addition, the Nevada Gaming Control Board has tenatively scheduled a June 10 special meeting to review Caesars' proposal to reincorporate in Delaware as part of the recapitalization plan, along with certain aspects of the proposed financing. 

   The board will then forward its recommendations to the Nevada Gaming Commission, which is set to review the plan at a June 18 special meeting. 

   Caesars said Nevada gaming authorities will review Mr. Sosnoff's offer concurrently with the company's plan. 

   Caesars cautioned that while it believes it will receive the necessary approvals from New Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities, "There can be no assurance that such meetings will take place as scheduled, and the company is unable to predict with certainty when a determination will be made on these matters, or that such approvals will be forthcoming." 

   Caesars shareholders are to vote on the recapitalization plan at a special meeting June 12 here. 
That meeting is unaffected by the scheduling of the meetings with gaming officials, a spokesman for the company said.
