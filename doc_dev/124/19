   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said Pratt Hotel Corp. and Southmark Corp. dropped their offer to join his $28-a-share bid to acquire Caesars World Inc. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said his tender offer for Caesars World shares was still in effect. 

   In early March Mr. Sosnoff said he made a tender offer to buy the 86.4% of Caesars World common shares outstanding that he doesn't already own, in a transaction valued at $725.2 million. 
In mid-March, Caesars World, the Los Angeles-based owner of casino hotels, rejected Mr. Sosnoff's bid as inadequate. 
Caesars World also sued Mr. Sosnoff in federal court in Los Angeles to block the tender offer, saying the offer was "illusory" and merely designed to increase the price of Caesars World shares so he can sell his shares at a profit. 

   Last week Mr. Sosnoff said he had held discussions with Pratt and Southmark, who were interested in joining him in a friendly transaction. 
But in a statement yesterday, Mr. Sosnoff said Pratt and Southmark furnished a notice terminating the talks. 
Mr. Sosnoff said that he hadn't held discussions with the two companies since March 20, but that under an agreement the Dallas-based companies said they wouldn't make a competing tender offer or bid for Caesars World until they formally terminated their discussions with Mr. Sosnoff. 

   In Dallas, Jack E. Pratt Sr., chairman of Pratt Hotel said Pratt and Southmark ended joint-venture talks with Mr. Sosnoff because "both parties couldn't agree to move forward." 

   Mr. Pratt said he couldn't comment on whether Pratt and Southmark might make an offer for Caesars themselves or propose another joint venture. 
"We want to expand and we're looking at a number of opportunties, but it would be premature to say what we plan to do," he said. 

   Pratt is a hotel and casino owner, and Southmark, which owns 36% of Pratt, has interests in real estate and financial services. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said his tender offer expires May 16 at 12:01 a.m. EDT. 
In Los Angeles, Caesars World declined to comment. 
In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Caesars World closed up 50 cents at $29.
