   The price of Caesars World Inc. stock
rose just hours after the company announced that developer Donald
Trump had invested in the gaming company.
   At the close of the day Wednesday on Wall Street, Caesars World
stock had jumped $4.12{ a share to $29.37{ in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   The activity led at least one gaming analyst to credit Trump with
being a shrewd investor.
   ``I take my hat off to Donald Trump,'' said Marvin Roffman of the
Philadelphia investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. ``It was a
wise investment to buy into Caesars. ... We've always felt Caesars
was one of the best-managed companies in the industry, and we felt
it was worth up to $40 a share.''
   Trump has asked the federal government for a ruling on whether
his investment would violate antitrust laws. He filed notice with
the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission of his
desire to possibly buy more than 50 percent of Caesars World common
stock.
   Although neither Trump nor Caesars World will say how much Trump
already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once
they have acquired at least $15 million worth of stock in a company.
   Caesars World officials refused comment on Trump's notice, ``due
to the confusing content of this notice,'' according to a statement.
Trump also refused to comment Wednesday.
   ``Such filings are very confidential and he's been advised not to
comment,'' said Susan Heilbron, a spokeswoman for Trump.
   Caesars World owns three gaming halls: Caesars Hotel Casino in
Atlantic City, and Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe in Nevada.
   In the notice, Trump said he ``has the good-faith intention,
subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to
acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of 15 percent of
the outstanding voting securities'' of Caesars World.
   Roffman said, however, that Trump would not be successful in a
hostile takeover of Caesars World. In a similar situation last year
involving investor Martin Sosnoff, New Jersey gaming regulators
blocked Sosnoff's highly leveraged takeover proposal.
   In a similar situation involving Trump, New Jersey's Casino
Control Commission would probably also reject a highly leveraged
deal, Roffman suggested.
   ``Donald Trump's style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' the analyst
said. ``He has (accumulated) a debt of $1.235 billion outstanding on
his three Atlantic City properties.''
   Under New Jersey law, Trump can own only three gaming halls in
the state. So far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and Trump
Castle casino hotels. A third, the massive Taj Mahal, is under
construction and expected to be completed in 1990.
   ``I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it doesn't
make sense to market three in Atlantic City,'' Roffman said. ``But
the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that Donald Trump is
interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a
profit.''
   This is not the first time that Trump has invested in a rival
casino company.
   He made a $30 million profit from investing in Holiday Corp.
stock and a $24 million profit on Bally Manufacturing Corp. stock.
He also bought a small amount of stock in Golden Nugget Corp., a
move that his competitor, Golden Nugget Chairman Steve Wynn, called
a ``publicity stunt.''
