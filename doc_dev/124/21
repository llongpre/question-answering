   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, disclosed a bid to acquire the shares of Caesars World Inc. he doesn't own for $28 each, or $725.2 million. 

   Under terms of the offer, which begins today, Mr. Sosnoff would acquire Los Angeles-based Caesars World, a profitable hotel-casino and real estate concern, through MTS Acquisition Corp., a company formed for the proposed purchase. 
The $28-a-share offer is set to expire at 12:01 a.m. EST April 4. 

   Mr. Sosnoff is Caesars World's largest holder with the equivalent of a 13.6% stake, or about 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding. 
The $28 price values all of Caesars World at $840 million. 

   The offer is conditioned on the approval of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, the Nevada Gaming Commission and the State Gaming Control Board of Nevada. 
Those agencies regulate casinos in those states. 
Mr. Sosnoff also must have sufficient financing before the offer can be completed. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Caesars World closed at $24.25 a share, up 25 cents. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said in an interview last night that financing of the offer would be managed by PaineWebber Inc. and Marine Midland Banks Inc., Buffalo, N.Y. 

   Mr. Sosnoff declined to elaborate on why he was bidding for the company, pending a news release, which he said would be issued "shortly." 
He said, however, that he believes that Caesars World's management is "pretty good." 

   In Los Angeles, a Caesars World spokesman said the company hadn't been aware of the offer and that it would need time to study it before making a comment. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, chairman of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp., has held a stake in Caesars World since 1983. 
Last September, Mr. Sosnoff filed for permission under federal antitrust laws to raise his stake in the company to as much as 25%. 
Mr. Sosnoff has asked several times for a seat on the board of Caesars World, a move that the company has rejected. 

   Some industry analysts suggested that Mr. Sosnoff, by bidding for Caesars World, may be hoping to attract the attention of other potential bidders. 

   "Marty has been trying to put the company in play for a long time," said Daniel Lee, analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who follows the gaming industry. 
"I'm not sure he's serious." 

   Mr. Lee said that Mr. Sosnoff had plenty of opportunities in the past to increase his Caesars World stake, and had offered to sell stock to Donald Trump, the New York real estate developer, and others. 
"Why did he wait until the stock was hitting new highs to make a tender offer? 
It's a little puzzling." 
Mr. Trump couldn't be reached for comment. 

   A source close to Mr. Sosnoff said, however, that the offer was a "real" one. 
The source added that "commitments from the bank have been made and PaineWebber will do the subordinated financing." 
The source said that Mr. Sosnoff first retained PaineWebber in December 1986 and that the decision to make a tender offer for Caesars World is one "that he hasn't been planning out for a long time." 

   Caesars World long has been known as a casino that appeals to high rollers, although it recently embarked on a program to attract middle-income and lower-income players, too. 
Its chairman and chief executive officer, Henry Gluck, is credited with having turned around the company. 

   When Mr. Gluck took the helm at Caesars World in 1983, the company posted a loss of more than $21 million. 
For the fiscal year ended July 31, 1986, the company posted net income of $41 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenue of $694.4 million. 

   In the second quarter ended Jan. 31, the company reported net rose 6.8% to $12.6 million, or 41 cents a share, from the year-earlier quarter's $7.5 million, or 25 cents a share. 
Revenue grew 16% to $190.4 million from $163.8 million. 

   Caesars World owns Caesars Palace, its flagship hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev. 
The company also owns a hotel-casino in Lake Tahoe, Nev., and another in Atlantic City, N.J. 
The company's holdings also include four honeymoon resorts in the Poconos and seven acres of undeveloped land along the Atlantic City boardwalk. 

   While industry analysts generally have praised Mr. Gluck and Caesars World's financial performance, some have said recently that the stock market long has undervalued the company's stock. 
Mr. Lee said that "$28 (a share) is getting pretty close to what Caesars is worth." 

   Besides his Caesars World holding, Mr. Sosnoff also has bought large stakes for himself or his firm's clients in recent years in such companies as Triangle Industries Inc., Loews Corp., Chrysler Corp. and New York Times Co. 
In the past, Mr. Sosnoff always has been a passive investor, buying and selling for investment rather than takeover purposes. 

   Last year, Mr. Sosnoff sold a 20% stake in his investment management firm to the public through a $30 million offering of about 1.8 million shares. 
He also sold $30 million of convertible debentures. 
Atalanta/Sosnoff had said it wanted the money to expand and for acquisition of financial companies.
