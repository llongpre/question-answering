   Caesars World Inc. said fiscal second-quarter profit rose 25% to $15.7 million, or 65 cents a share, primarily because of improved operating results at its Nevada casino-hotels. 

   Net income for the year-earlier quarter was $12.6 million, or 41 cents a share. 
Revenue for the latest second quarter, ended Jan. 31, increased 5.4% to $198 million from $187.8 million a year earlier. 

   For the six months, Caesars' net jumped 65% to $45.4 million, or $1.58 a share, from $27.5 million, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue rose 10% to $421.6 million from $383.3 million. 

   Per-share earnings figures for the latest quarter and six months reflected the company's buy-back of 11 million common shares last October, which was offset by the conversion of its subordinated debentures into five million common shares. 

   Profit of Caesars' 86.6%-owned Caesars New Jersey Inc. rose 42% in the latest second quarter to $4.2 million, or 25 cents a share, from $2.9 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Revenue increased 5.4% to $69.6 million from $66 million. 
For the six months, net rose 82% to $16.2 million, or 99 cents a share, from $8.9 million, or 54 cents a share. 
Revenue increased 8.6% to $160.3 million from $147.6 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World stock fell 62.5 cents to close at $24.375 a share, but Caesars New Jersey stock rose 62.5 cents to close at $17 a share in American Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Separately, Caesars World said next month it will introduce its new line of fragrances in all of Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc.'s Broadway department stores in Southern California, and Lazarus department stores in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and West Virginia. 
Lazarus is a unit of Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores Inc. Caesars said it expects the fragrances, which had previously been availble at its resorts, to be marketed in about 500 retail outlets throughout the nation by the end of the year. 

   The company also said it signed agreements with Joan Hansen &amp; Co. of New York and Equity Management Inc. of Palatine, Ill., both licensing agents, to represent the company in national licensing of apparel, home accessories and gift products under Caesars brand labels.
