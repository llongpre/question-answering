   Caesars World Inc. said it filed a petition with the New Jersey Casino Control Commission for a rehearing on its proposed $960 million recapitalization plan. 

   The commission rejected the hotel and gambling concern's recapitalization plan by a 4-1 vote Aug. 12. 
One commissioner argued that the plan, which would give Caesars' shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company, "lacks any clear business purpose" and is designed to "permanently entrench" current management while loading down the company with $960 million of new debt. 

   Caesars, operator of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., and Caesars Atlantic City hotel-casino in New Jersey, said that the timing of the rehearing, which might not be granted by the Casino Commission, is uncertain. 

   Caesars said it is asking permission to cross-examine one of the state's witnesses, H. Peter Gray of Rutgers University, who testified before the commission that the proposed recapitalization would seriously weaken Caesars' capital structure. 
Caesars said it is also requesting permission to present testimony of additional independent financial experts. 

   The company added that it is continuing to explore a variety of alternatives to the proposed plan, but added that it hasn't determined which it would pursue should the plan be rejected. 
As previously reported, industry sources have suggested that the company might restructure its recapitalization plan to include less debt. 
Another action suggested by one Wall Street executive would be for Caesars to sell its Atlantic City property.
