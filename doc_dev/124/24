   Martin T. Sosnoff, who waged an unsuccessful takeover bid for Caesars World Inc. earlier this year, said he won't sell his roughly 12% stake back to the company. 

   The New York financier hadn't previously responded to the Los Angeles-based casino operator's offer, launched this week, to buy 31% of its shares for $29.50 to $34 each, or $325 million to $374 million. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World shares closed at $30, up 37.5 cents. 

   In a statement, Mr. Sosnoff branded the buy-back offer a "pusillanimous" effort to "purge" all arbitragers and "other shortterm professional investors from the ranks of Caesars' shareholders." 

   Officials of the hotel and gambling concern declined to comment on Mr. Sosnoff's announcement. 

   Mr. Sosnoff's response to Caesars World's offer is the latest episode in one of the year's longest-running takeover sagas, which began in March with Mr. Sosnoff's unsolicited $28-a-share bid for the company. 
Mr. Sosnoff later raised his proposal to $35 a share, or $1.11 billion, for the shares he didn't already own. 

   Caesars World's initial defense against Mr. Sosnoff was a proposed $960 million recapitalization plan. 
After New Jersey regulators refused to approve that plan, Caesars replaced it with the buy-back offer.
