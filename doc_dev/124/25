<HEAD>Trump Indicates He May Seek Control Of Caesars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Developer Donald Trump has notified
the federal government that he wants to buy 15 percent or more of
Caesars World Inc. stock and that he may seek controlling interest,
the hotel and casino company says.
   In a statement issued late Tuesday, Caesars officials said they
were notified that Trump has asked the government for a ruling on
whether his investment in Caesars would violate federal antitrust
laws.
   The disclosure sent Caesars' common stock sharply higher today.
In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars was up $4
a share to $29.25.
   But gaming analysts said Trump, who already owns two casinos in
Atlantic City and is building a third, would face regulatory
obstacles to a move on Caesars in both Nevada, where Caesars is
based, and New Jersey, which prohibits single ownership of no more
than three casinos.
   The Los Angeles-based Caesars owns the highly profitable Caesars
Hotel Casino here and the Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe casino
hotels in Nevada.
   Neither Trump's filing nor Caesars' statement indicated how much
Caesars stock Trump may already own. Tuesday's filing was made under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, which requires companies or individuals
to seek such a ruling once they have acquired $15 million worth of
stock in a company.
   At Tuesday's closing price of $25.25 per share, that would
translate to about 590,000 shares, or about 2.4 percent of Caesar's
24.5 million common shares outstanding.
   Susan Heilbron, executive vice president of the Turmp
Organization, said Trump had no comment on the filing other than to
confirm that it was made. She declined to say how much Caesars'
stock, if any, Trump already owns.
   According to the Caesars' statement, Trump indicated he ``has the
good faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary
approvals, if any,'' to acquire 15 percent of Caesar's stock.
   Trump's filing also said he ``may decide to seek control of
(Caesars) through the acquisition of 50 percent (or) more of the
outstanding voting securities.''
   ``Due to the confusing content of this notice, (Caesars) is
unable to ascertain Mr. Trump's plans at this time and has no
further comment,'' the company said in its release.
   One gaming analyst, Marvin Roffman of Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia, said he doubts that Trump is serious about
making a move to acquire Caesars, and said any such move would face
serious regulatory opposition in New Jersey and Nevada.
   ``The gaming board in Nevada has come out and said it does not
particularly relish hostile takeovers, and I can tell you that this
would be a hostile takeover because the company will vigorously
defend its independence,'' he said.
   New Jersey gaming regulators have also strongly opposed hostile
takeovers of casino companies.
   Trump now owns Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino hotels in
Atlantic City and is building the massive Taj Mahal casino hotel,
which should be complete in 15 months.
