   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, sweetened his hostile offer to acquire Caesars World Inc. to $32 a share, or $931.2 million. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, who is Caesars World's largest holder with a 12% stake on a fully diluted basis, last month launched a $28-as-hare tender offer for all of the shares outstanding in the Los Angeles-based owner of casino-hotels. 

   According to an advertisement in today's Wall Street Journal, Mr. Sosnoff's amended offer will expire June 19 at 5 p.m. EDT, unless extended. 

   In New York, Mr. Sosnoff said, "We think our offer is better than the company's because it doesn't put the shareholders at risk and it gives them all cash." 
He added that an attempt by Caesars World to increase its offer "raises questions about whether the remaining shares of Caesars would be worth very much after a recapitalization" because the company would be adding more debt. 
Mr. Sosnoff added that "we're still hopeful of getting a friendly deal" with Caesars World. 

   But Caesars World is unlikely to be any more receptive to Mr. Sosnoff's second offer than it was to his first. 
The latest bid doesn't offer much of a premium to the company's own recapitalization plan announced about a week ago. 
Under that plan, Caesars would pay a one-time cash dividend of $25 a share and incur about $1 billion of new debt. 

   Current shareholders also would retain common stock in a more highly leveraged Caesars. 
Last week, analysts generally valued the common stock after the recapitalization at about $6 to $7 a share, although some said the value could be as much as $10 a share. 

   The stock market has reacted favorably to the Caesars World plan, although in composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars common closed at $32.125 a share, down 12.5 cents. 

   Some traders said last week that the price of the company's stock was bid up sharply after the company's announcement of its recapitalization plan on expectations that Southmark Corp. and Pratt Hotel Corp., both based in Dallas, might make a joint bid for Caesars World. 

   As previously reported, Southmark and Pratt Hotel late last month held talks with Mr. Sosnoff about conducting a joint offer with the investor for Caesars World. 
Those talks proved unsuccessful. 

   Terms of Mr. Sosnoff's latest offer for Caesars World call for purchasing 94%, on a fully diluted basis, the shares that the investor doesn't already own. 
An individual familiar with Mr. Sosnoff's latest offer said that the investor anticipates offering securities for the remaining 6.1 million shares with a value of $32 a share. 

   The individual said that Mr. Sosnoff on Friday received written commitments for $475 million from his investment banker, PaineWebber Inc. Mr. Sosnoff also has received $500 million in commitments from a group of banks led by Marine Midland Banks Inc., and expects an additional $25 million in commitments from those banks. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff had said he was contemplating a new offer for Caesars World. 
In a letter to Henry Gluck, chairman of Caesars World, Mr. Sosnoff said he was "prepared to offer a meaningful increase in price in the context of a friendly, negotiated transaction."
