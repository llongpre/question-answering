   The price of Caesars World Inc. stock
surged Wednesday after developer Donald Trump surprised the gaming
industry by asking the federal government for a ruling on whether he
could buy a controlling interest in the hotel and casino company
without violating antitrust laws.
   Trump filed notice on Tuesday with the U.S. Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Commission of his desire to possibly purchase
more than 50 percent of Caesars World common stock.
   Although neither Trump nor Caesars will say how much Trump
already owns, the filing was made under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act,
which requires companies or individuals to seek such a ruling once
they have acquired at least $15 million worth of stock in a company.
   The filing was disclosed after the markets closed on Tuesday, but
Caesars Wolrld stock rose sharply in active trading on Wednesday.
   In consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading, Caesars World
rose $4.25 to $29.50 a share. At that price, its 24.5 million shares
are worth about $723 million.
   Caesars World officials refused comment on Trump's notice, which
it disclosed in a statement late Tuesday.
   The Los Angeles-based company said in the statement that ``due to
the confusing content of this notice, it is unable to ascertain
Trump's plans ...'
   Trump also declined comment. ``Such filings are very confidential
and he's been advised not to comment,'' said Susan Heilbron, a
spokeswoman for Trump.
   Caesars World owns three gaming halls: Caesars Hotel Casino in
Atlantic City and Caesars Palace and Caesars Tahoe in Nevada.
   In the filing, Trump said he ``has the good faith intention,
subject to price, availability and necessary approvals, if any, to
acquire such number of shares ... to hold in excess of 15 percent of
the outstanding voting securities'' of Caesars World.
   But he went on in the filing to say ``it is possible'' that he
may ``decide to seek control'' of Caesars by buying 50 percent or
more of its stock.
   Gaming analysts spent a good part of Wednesday pondering Trump's
latest move.
   Marvin Roffman of the investment firm Janney Montgomery Scott
Inc. in Philadelphia said Caesars is ``one of the best-managed
companies in the industry, and we felt it was worth up to $40 a
share.''
   But Roffman said New Jersey gaming regulators would probably
block any highly-leveraged hostile effort to acquire Caesars World.
   ``Donald Trump's style is not cash, it's to borrow,'' Roffman
said.
   Under New Jersey law, Trump can own only three gaming halls. So
far, he is licensed for two _ Trump Plaza and Trump Castle casino
hotels. A third, the massive Taj Mahal, is under construction and
expected to be completed in 1990.
   ``I think he'll sell one anyway in the future, because it doesn't
make sense to market three in Atlantic City,'' Roffman said. ``But
the bottom line with this Caesars notice is that Donald Trump is
interested in making money, not owning another casino. He simply
bought into an undervalued situation and will come out with a
profit.''
   This is not the first time that Trump has invested in a rival
casino company.
   He made a $30 million profit in Holiday Corp. stock and a $24
million profit on Bally Manufacturing Corp. stock. He also purchased
a small amount of stock in the Golden Nugget Corp., a move that his
competitor, Golden Nugget chairman Steve Wynn, called a ``publicity
stunt.''
