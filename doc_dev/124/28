   Caesars World Inc. posted a net loss of $4.6 million for its fourth quarter ended July 31, after a pretax charge of $22.4 million related to its proposed $960 million recapitalization and other efforts to fight off an unwanted takeover. 

   In the year-earlier quarter, the gambling concern had net income of $14.6 million, or 48 cents a share. 
Revenue increased 8.9% to $201.6 million from $185 million. 

   Latest fourth-quarter operating net, including the $22.4 million pretax charge, was $2.1 million, or six cents a share. 
The net loss included an after-tax charge of $6.7 million from the redemption and payment of debt. 
As reported earlier, Caesars would incur $960 million of new debt under the recapitalization plan, which it designed earlier this year to fight off an unwanted takeover attempt by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. 

   The recapitalization plan, however, was rejected, 4-1, by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission Aug. 12, a move that blocked Caesars in proceeding with the proposal. 
The commission tentatively has set Sept. 9 to consider a Caesars petition for a rehearing on the matter. 

   As operator of Caesars Atlantic City hotel-casino in New Jersey and Caesars Palace hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev., the company needs clearance by gambling authorities in both states to proceed with its recapitalization. 
Nevada officials delayed their decision on the plan after the New Jersey commission rejected it. 

   In a recent affidavit, the author of a negative study used by the commission in its deliberations indicated that he may soften his objections to the plan. 

   The author, H. Peter Gray, professor emeritus of economics and finance at Rutgers University, said Caesars representatives met with him Aug. 19 and provided him with additional information "which I didn't previously have and wasn't aware of, and which, in some instances, was more recent than information which I had relied upon in writing my report." 

   Mr. Gray said he based his first report, cited extensively by the commission in its rejection of the plan, on information from New Jersey gambling authorities. 

   But securities analysts and others familiar with Caesars' bid for a recapitalization have expressed doubt that the commission will be swayed in any rehearing. 
Caesars declined to comment on its prospects for a rehearing. 
The company has said it is considering a variety of alternatives, including restructuring the recapitalization plan to include less debt.
