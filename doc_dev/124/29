   Caesars World Inc. said it began an offering of $265 million of 13 1/2% subordinated notes due 1997 in connection with its offer to buy back as much as 31% of its common stock outstanding. 

   The hotel and gambling concern will use proceeds to fund a portion of as much as $400 million that it may need to buy back the shares and pay related fees and expenses. 
Caesars said it expects to use bank credit facilities and liquidate short-term investments to raise the additional capital. 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is sole underwriter for the offering. 

   Caesars launched the stock buy-back Sept. 8 after New Jersey gambling authorities in August rejected a proposed $960 million recapitalization of the company. 
That recapitalization plan was designed to fend off an unwanted takeover attempt by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. 

   Under the buy-back, which ends at 12:01 a.m. EDT Oct. 6, Caesars will purchase as many as 11 million common shares through a Dutch auction tender offer. 
It will accept the shares in the order of the prices that holders have specified, within the stated range of $29.50 to $34 a share, until the total shares tendered reach 11 million. 
The highest price required to reach the total will then be paid to holders of all the shares accepted. 
Mr. Sosnoff has said he won't sell his 12% stake back to Caesars.
