   Caesars World Inc. said its board recommended that shareholders reject Martin T. Sosnoff's sweetened $32-a-share tender offer for Caesars, and said it might increase the competing recapitalization plan it proposed earlier this month. 

   The hotel and casino concern, which operates Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., said its recommendation reflects a fairness opinion from its financial advisors and "the lengthy time until shares could be purchased under Sosnoff's offer." 

   Mr. Sosnoff, a New York money manager who is Caesars's largest shareholder with a 12% stake, set a June 19 expiration date for his $931.2 million tender offer. 
He wasn't immediately available to comment on Caesars's rejection of his amended offer. 

   The recapitalization plan Caesars proposed, two weeks after rejecting Mr. Sosnoff's initial bid of $28-a-share, or $725.2 million, calls for a one-time cash dividend of $25 a share for holders. 
Caesars would incur about $1 billion of new debt under the plan. 

   Caesars didn't provide additional information about its recapitalization plan but said details of the plan, including its effect on the company's net worth, will be included in proxy materials to be distributed in late May. 
Caesars has said it would have a negative net worth after the proposed recapitalization. 

   In a statement responding to Mr. Sosnoff's sweetened offer, Caesars said its board "would consider appropriate adjustments to the (recapitalization) plan, including the amount of the cash dividend. 

   It said there weren't any assurances the dividend or other terms of the proposed recapitalization would be changed. 
But a spokesman said Caesars might decide to increase the $25 dividend proposal or otherwise sweeten the recapitalization "in view of the amended Sosnoff offer and the possibility of other developments." 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Caesars shares closed yesterday at $32.25, up 12.5 cents. 

   Separately, in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing this week, Mr. Sosnoff disclosed a list of prospective investors who have committed to help him finance his proposed acquisition of Caesars World by buying preferred shares in the acquired concern. 

   According to the filing, those investors include PaineWebber Inc., which has agreed to put up $44 million in financing. 
The New York investment bank is also advising Mr. Sosnoff. 
Other potential investors include Shenkman Capital Management Inc., T. Rowe Price High Yield Fund Inc., M.D.C. Holdings Inc., Integrated Resources Inc. and Hardrock Investments. 

   As previously reported, PaineWebber has delivered to Mr. Sosnoff commitments for $475 million of financing for the proposed acquisition. 
In addition, Marine Midland Bank has agreed to raise more than $500 million from among a group of banks for the proposed acquisition.
