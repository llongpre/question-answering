   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, further sweetened his hostile offer to acquire Caesars World Inc. to $35 a share, or $1.11 billion. 

   Mr. Sosnoff in March launched a $28-a-share tender offer for all the shares outstanding in the Los Angeles-based owner of casino-hotels. 
In April, after Caesars unveiled a recapitalization plan, Mr. Sosnoff raised his bid for the company to $32 a share, or $1 billion. 
Mr. Sosnoff is Caesars' largest holder, with a 12% stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. 

   A Caesars spokesman declined comment on the sweetened offer. 

   The latest offer, which expires June 19, differs from earlier ones because shareholders would receive a 30% stake in the company if it is acquired. 
The new offer tops by a slight margin Caesars' sweetened recapitalization plan. 
That plan was fashioned to thwart Mr. Sosnoff's takeover attempt. 

   As previously reported, the recapitalization calls for Caesars to incur $960 million of new debt. 
It would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
Analysts have valued the stock portion of the offer, or "stub," at about $8.50 a share, indicating that the plan has a total market value of $34.75 a share. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Caesars stock closed yesterday at $34.25 a share, up 25 cents. 

   Terms of Mr. Sosnoff's latest offer call for the investor to buy 85%, on a fully diluted basis, of the shares that he doesn't already own. 
For the remainder, Mr. Sosnoff would offer securities with a value of $35 a share. 

   Those securities would consist of preferred stock, valued at $87.8 million, or $2.76 a share, on a fully diluted basis. 
The plan also calls for Mr. Sosnoff to provide stockholders with 30% of the equity of the acquired company. 
A market source estimates the stub would be worth between $2.50 and $2.80 a share. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff's earlier $32-a-share offer called for the investor to buy 94% of the shares he doesn't already own on a fully diluted basis, and to offer securities for the remainder. 
That would indicate that the cash portion of the current offer remains about the same as the earlier bid. 

   Caesars World so far has been unreceptive to Mr. Sosnoff, refusing to discuss with him his offer for the company. 
Mr. Sosnoff, for his part, has criticized the company's recapitalization plan because it would leave Caesars highly leveraged.
