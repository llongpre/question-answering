   Caesars World Inc., reeling from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission's Wednesday rejection of a proposed $960 million corporate recapitalization, said it is reviewing alternatives that include an appeal or a petition for a rehearing. 

   Meanwhile, the unexpected negative ruling sparked much speculation about what other courses might be open to the gambling concern in its effort to recapitalize. 

   Among the possibilities suggested by industry sources, securities analysts and others is that the operator of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., and Caesars Atlantic City hotel-casino in New Jersey might restructure the recapitalization plan to include less debt. 
That might make the proposal more palatable to the commission, which has the power to issue and revoke gambling licenses in the state. 

   Another, far more serious action suggested by one Wall Street executive would be for Caesars to sell its Atlantic City property, with proceeds going into a new recapitalization effort. 
Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Hilton Hotels Corp. sold its $300 million Atlantic City hotel to Donald Trump in 1985 after the state commission denied it a gambling license. 
Despite the setback that removed New Jersey gambling from its plans, Hilton has continued to grow in Las Vegas and in its hotel business abroad. 

   One analyst said it is unlikely Caesars would pull out of Atlantic City, given that the New Jersey operations accounted for 40% of the company's revenue of $694.4 million in the fiscal year ended July 31, 1986. 
"Why would Caesars want to sell off one of its two good children?" he asked. 

   Trading in Caesars World shares was delayed until about 3 p.m. EDT yesterday, and the stock opened on volume of 400,000 shares, down $5.125. 
The price rebounded slightly during the final hour of New York Stock Exchange composite trading to close at $30.50, down $4.625, with about 1.3 million shares changing hands. 

   Caesars declined to elaborate on what alternatives it is considering. 
The company said only that it has 10 days to file a petition for a rehearing and 45 days to file an appeal, and that it will make a decision on the matter within the next week. 

   Caesars' recapitalization plan, which calls for shareholders to receive a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company, was designed to block a takeover attempt by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. 
Mr. Sosnoff in June dropped his sweetened $35-a-share bid for the company, saying he could no longer justify the cost of the $1.11 billion effort. 

   The commission rejected the plan on a 4-1 vote, with one commissioner arguing that the recapitalization "lacks any clear business purpose," and that it is designed to "permanently entrench" current management while loading the company with new debt. 

   In April, the commission approved a similar $2.6 billion recapitalization proposed by Memphis, Tenn.-based Holiday Corp., a hotel and gambling concern, after it was rumored to be a takeover target. 
Some gambling industry sources suggested that the commission may have rejected Caesars' proposal in an attempt to discourage other gambling companies from using recapitalizations to thwart or to discourage takeover attempts. 

   One analyst said the commission's action could make Caesars a takeover target once again. 

   "This (ruling) could raise speculative interest, and someone could make another pass at them because of the commission's misjudgment," said Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. Bear Stearns served as an adviser to Caesars on the recapitalization plan. 

   Were Mr. Sosnoff to make another bid for Caesars, he would be likely to encounter resistance from New Jersey's gaming authorities. 
Commission Chairman Walter N. Read noted in his negative opinion on the recapitalization that Mr. Sosnoff "couldn't have taken control of the company" without the commission "finding that he was personally qualified to do so -- which it never has." 
The commission chairman said that under Mr. Sosnoff's plan, the company wouldn't be financially stable because of the "more than $1 billion of debt he proposed to load on it." 

   Mr. Sosnoff hasn't been available for comment since the commission ruling. 

   Nevada gambling authorities, who also have been considering the Caesars recapitalization proposal, said they weren't sure whether they would proceed with a planned Aug. 20 ruling in light of the New Jersey commission's action. 

   In a related move, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. placed its rating on Caesars' proposed $330 million issue of senior notes and $330 million of subordinated debentures on CreditWatch with "developing implications," meaning that a raising or lowering of the S&amp;P rating could be forthcoming.
