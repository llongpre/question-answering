   Caesars World Inc. said it filed suit in federal court here against Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor who began an unsolicited $28-a-share tender offer for the company last week. 

   The gaming concern alleged in its complaint that Mr. Sosnoff's offer, valued at $725.2 million, is "illusory" and "designed to manipulate the market" to allow the investor to sell his current Caesars holdings at a substantial profit. 
Mr. Sosnoff holds a 13.6% stake in Caesars, or 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding. 

   Caesars also said that certain information about the tender offer in Securities and Exchange Commission documents filed by Mr. Sosnoff is "deliberately false and misleading," including some details of Mr. Sosnoff's financing plans. 

   The suit, which also names MTS Acquisition Corp., the company Mr. Sosnoff formed for the acquisition, seeks to enjoin the tender offer and to require Mr. Sosnoff to correct all of the allegedly false statements. 

   In New York, Mr. Sosnoff wasn't available for comment. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff filed suit in a U.S. court last week against Caesars, alleging that the company and its directors breached their fiduciary duty to shareholders by approving anti-takeover measures last year. 
Late last week Caesars rejected Mr. Sosnoff's tender offer as "inadequate" and said it is exploring restructuring or the sale of the company to a friendly suitor. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars closed at $29.50 a share, up 12.5 cents.
