   The easy money has already been made in Atlantic City, traders say. 
But a few speculators are betting on Resorts International, Caesars World and Showboat. 

   Although they've wilted recently, shares of many companies with big stakes in Atlantic City are at lofty levels. 
That's partly because Donald Trump last year showed that gambling concerns had valuable assets that weren't reflected in their stock prices. 

   Mr. Trump, before gaining control of Resorts International, prompted Holiday and Bally Manufacturing to boost their stocks by restructuring their operations. 
Martin Sosnoff's bid for Caesars World could have the same result if nobody tops his offer, money managers say. 

   But many casino stocks now reflect their asset values and profit prospects, analysts say. 
The group trades at about 16 times expected 1987 earnings, compared with a multiple of 12 or 13 last year, says Steve Eisenberg of Bear Stearns. 
With gambling revenue growing slowly while wagering facilities multiply, Atlantic City profit could be disappointing for some casinos in 1987 and 1988, analysts add. 

   Casino buffs think some stocks have above-average odds. 
Resorts and Showboat are trading far below their asset values. 
Both are scheduled to open new casinos in 1987 and should lure novelty-seeking gamblers from Bally and other competitors, money managers say. 
Caesars' Las Vegas operation and its 87%-owned Caesars News Jersey attract upscale gamblers and are expected to do well. 

   Besides their earnings prospects, the stocks are magnets for some rank speculation. 
Some traders hope Mr. Trump might eventually take Resorts private, buying the outstanding shares at a big premium. 
Caesars New Jersey shares might also be bought if the parent goes private or is acquired, traders add. 
Showboat for two years has been 9.8%-owned by Baron Capital, a New York money manager, and is considered a potential restructuring candidate. 

   Mr. Trump says, "I have no interest in buying (the rest of) the Resorts stock." 
Caesars won't comment, saying it's still "looking at the alternatives." 
Ron Baron of Baron Capital says, "I don't expect to do anything hostile with a company." 

   Resorts is everybody's favorite. 
Its giant Taj Mahal casino, due to open in late 1987, should boost profit significantly, analysts say. 
And Mr. Trump's fans think he'll move fast to develop Resorts' huge land holdings in Atlantic City. 

   "Perhaps," says Mr. Trump. 
"The land is just being looked at right now." 

   Speculation that Mr. Trump might take Resorts private hinges on a theory that he won't want to share profit from Resorts' developments -- and he won't like public disclosure. 
Developers hate tipping off competitors about details and timing of their plans, says one casino executive. 
But Mr. Trump says disclosure "isn't a problem." 

   Mr. Trump has agreed to pay $101 million for 585,000 Resorts Class B shares with 73% of the votes, leaving 5.7 million Class A shares outstanding. 
At 58 yesterday, the Class A shares traded at about 58% of their asset value, analysts say. 
But it would cost Resorts $485 million to redeem the Class A shares at $85, a price traders want. 

   Resorts' main concern is to complete its $525 million Taj Mahal, says Andrew Racz, an investment banker at Philips, Appel &amp; Walden. 
Mr. Trump doesn't want the Class A shares because they have almost no voting power, adds an industry executive. 

   Mr. Trump controls four Atlantic City casinos, one more than allowed by New Jersey law, including two Resorts' operations and two of his own. 
There's speculation he'll turn Resorts' older casino into a luxury hotel or convention center. 

   Caesars World, at 29 3/8 yesterday, has assets of $30 to $35 a share, analysts estimate. 
The stock is trading above Mr. Sosnoff's $28-a-share bid but has been weak recently because of fears he might take "greenmail" for his 13.6% stake. 
After rebuffing Mr. Sosnoff, Caesars World sued the investor Tuesday, saying, among other things, that he earlier expressed interest in selling shares to the company at a premium. 

   "We believe the lawsuit to be without merit," Mr. Sosnoff says through a spokesman. 
"I would still like to do a friendly transaction and work with Caesars to maximize values for all shareholders." 

   There are about two million Caesars New Jersey shares in public hands. 
At 15 7/8 yesterday, they might be bought in at prices "in the low 20s," speculates one holder. 
But the parent might not care to do that. 
It already consolidates 87% of the subsidiary's profit and, if it wanted, could get 87% of the cash flow through dividends, accountants say. 

   Showboat, at 28 1/8 yesterday, is "the purest play on Atlantic City," says Mark Manson of Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. 
Most casinos pursue big spenders, but Showboat's Las Vegas site lures "the kind of people who walk the streets of Atlantic City," says one fan. 

   Its Atlantic City operation, slated to open soon, could more than double operating profit to $3 a share in the year ending June 30, 1988, says Ron Baron of Baron Capital. 
Showboat's assets are worth $40 a share, he says, and could be worth much more in the future. 

   But all these stocks are volatile. 
Some of them might languish if Atlantic City doesn't prosper. 
Says Mike Esposito of Oppenheimer: "Digging for gold has got tougher."
