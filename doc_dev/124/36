   New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff, who has offered to buy Caesars World Inc. for $28 a share, said the company has tried "on several occasions" to buy back his 13.6% stake in Caesars World. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that the attempts were made "during the past year." 
He said Caesars World representatives, including Henry Gluck, chairman, proposed "various forms of consideration" for his stake. 

   He also said in the filing that the company representatives asked him to sign a standstill agreement prohibiting further stock purchases and barring him from taking "any action adverse to incumbent management." 

   The investor, who is chairman of Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp., said in the filing that he didn't accept any of the company's proposals. 
As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff began a tender offer Monday for the Caesars World common that he doesn't already own. 
The offer is valued at $725.2 million. 
Mr. Sosnoff currently owns about 4.1 million of the company's 30 million shares outstanding, making him its largest holder. 

   Caesars, a Los Angeles-based hotel and casino concern, declined to comment on Mr. Sosnoff's filing. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars World's common closed at $27.875 a share, down 62.5 cents. 

   Mr. Sosnoff didn't say in the filing whether he had been offered cash or securities for his shares. 
He didn't say exactly when the proposals were made, but sources said he was approached a total of three times last summer and fall. 

   The sources said Mr. Sosnoff was approached twice by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the investment banking firm that represents Caesars. 
"Drexel has been the chief intermediary here," one source said. 
And once, last September, Mr. Sosnoff is understood to have met with Mr. Gluck. 
The filing didn't indicate how much Mr. Sosnoff was offered for his shares. 

   Separately, Mr. Sosnoff sued Caesars World in federal court in Miami, alleging that its directors failed in their fiduciary duty to holders. 
The suit alleges that certain poison-pill provisions adopted by the company last March were designed to "discourage investor interest" and to "entrench existing management." 
Caesars declined to comment."
