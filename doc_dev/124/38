   Caesars World Inc. said that about 13.7 million common shares were tendered at $29.50 each under its previously announced buy-back offer. 

   Caesars' offer to buy back as many as 11 million shares for $29.50 to $34 each expired yesterday. 
The offer was conducted under a so-called Dutch auction procedure, under which shares tendered are accepted in the order of the prices specified by the holders, within the stated range of $29.50 to $34 a share. 
The highest price required to reach the 11 million total will be paid to holders of all the shares accepted. 

   Caesars, a hotel and gambling concern, said it will announce the per-share purchase price "as soon as practicable" after the depositary has confirmed the total number of shares tendered and the prices specified by tendering shareholders. 
However, the per-share price probably won't exceed $29.50, since more than the maximum 11 million shares were tendered at that price. 
Of the 13.7 million shares tendered at $29.50 each, about 9.6 million were submitted on a guarantee delivery basis, which required delivery of the shares to the depositary by yesterday, Caesars said. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars closed at $28 a share, down $1.50. 
Caesars will have about 24.2 million common shares outstanding after it buys back the 11 million shares. 

   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor who earlier this year made an unsuccessful takeover bid for the company and retains a 12% stake, said he didn't tender any shares to Caesars World. 
He said he views his holdings as "a good, long-term investment."
