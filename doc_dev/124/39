   Caesars World Inc. expects to report per-share earnings rose more than 70% in the fiscal 1988 first quarter. 

   The hotel and casino concern said per-share earnings were 85 cents to 92 cents, based on about 33 million common shares outstanding. 
In the first quarter ended Oct. 31, 1986, earnings were 50 cents a share, or $15 million, on 30 million shares outstanding. 
Revenue was $198 million. 

   Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer, attributed the record quarterly earnings to strong performances at all of the company's properties. 
The company's flagship Caesars Palace in Las Vegas did particularly well, he said, while its casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., Lake Tahoe, Nev., and four honeymoon resorts in the Poconos reported improved results "across the board." 

   Costs stemming from an unsolicited takeover bid by the New York investor Martin Sosnoff in fiscal 1987 have mostly been accounted for, Mr. Gluck said in an interview. 
Those costs included an unusual pretax charge of $27.7 million for the year ended July 31 and after-tax charges of $6.7 million in the fourth quarter from the redemption and payment of debt. 

   In the latest quarter, Caesars World bought 11 million, or about 31%, of its shares at $29.50 a share in a tender offer prompted by the Sosnoff bid. 
Although earnings for the quarter will reflect changes in the corporate tax rate, results won't include other major extraordinary or unusual items related to the takeover bid or the buyback, Mr. Gluck said. 

   Mr. Gluck said it didn't appear that the recent stock market crash would have any immediate impact on the company's businesses. 
He noted that Caesars's Atlantic City property continued to lead the city's casinos in gambling winnings in October, which he attributed in part to the company's strategy of a balanced customer mix in all its casinos. 

   Caesars's retail merchandising activities are expected to double this year, he said. 
Introduction of the company's new fragrances, Caesars Man and Caesars Woman, is scheduled for December.
