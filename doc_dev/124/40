   Martin T. Sosnoff, facing a showdown in his $1.11 billion offer for Caesars World Inc., mounted a mail drive to cancel a Friday shareholder meeting that could doom his bid. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, a New York money manager, said Caesars had refused his request to postpone the shareholder session until his tender offer expires a week later. 
In a proxy solicitation, he asked holders to support his move to adjourn the meeting for 12 days. 
In case that fails, he also asked holders to vote down a recapitalization plan designed by the Los Angeles gambling company to thwart Mr. Sosnoff. 

   The two sides have been battling since Mr. Sosnoff launched a $28-per-share, or $725.2 million, tender offer for Caesars in March. 
Mr. Sosnoff is Caesars' largest holder, with a 12% stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. 

   In April, Caesars countered with a plan to give holders a one-time $26.25-a-share cash dividend and leave them with shares valued at an estimated $8.50 each. 
The plan would encumber Caesars with nearly $1 billion in debt. 

   Mr. Sosnoff then raised his offer to $32 a share in mid-April, and again to $35 a share last week. 

   In Los Angeles, a Caesars spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Sosnoff's new proxy solicitation. 
He said the meeting for Caesars holders to vote on the recapitalization is still set for Friday. 

   At that meeting, Caesars will also ask holders to approve a series of new anti-takeover measures. 
Even if Caesars' recapitalization plan isn't approved, the anti-takeover measures could effectively derail Mr. Sosnoff's tender offer. 

   A motion to adjourn the shareholder meeting requires majority approval by those holders attending the meeting. 
Caesars' proposed recapitalization plan requires approval by holders of a majority of the company's shares outstanding. 

   The anti-takeover measures holders will consider at Friday's meeting include amendments to the company's articles of incorporation providing that certain transactions with holders of 15% or more of Caesars stock, changes in the company's bylaws, and attempts to remove directors from office be approved by 80% of the shareholders. 

   The company also is proposing to stagger its directors' terms of office, to reincorporate in Delaware from Florida, to indemnify officers and directors, and to provide increased employment and performance incentives for management. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Caesars shares closed at $34.75, up 12.5 cents.
