   A federal judge here derailed Martin T. Sosnoff's $35-a-share takeover bid for Caesars World Inc. in a ruling that would require the New York investor to start his tender offer over. 

   Judge William Rea late yesterday also ordered Caesars to delay for at least one month a vote on its proposed $960 million recapitalization plan, which the company designed to thwart Mr. Sosnoff's efforts. 

   Caesars said it postponed a Friday meeting at which shareholders were to have voted on the recapitalization plan. 

   The judge's ruling enjoins Mr. Sosnoff from continuing his tender offer on the ground that his financing plan violates a rule by the Federal Reserve Board that a purchaser may not borrow more than 50% of the funds used to purchase stock of a target company if that stock is to be pledged as security to the lender. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said he intends to appeal the judge's decision immediately. 
"I think this decision is absolutely erroneous. 
There is no precedent to support it," he said. 
He said he expects to recommence his tender offer within 30 days. 
Caesars said it is reviewing the ruling and declined further comment. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff had received commitments from PaineWebber Inc. for $475 million in financing, to be offered as "exchangeable preferred stock," and $500 million in loans from a group of banks led by Marine Midland Bank. 
In his opinion, Judge Rea described the $475 million of exchangeable preferred stock as "debt instruments" rather than equity, since the stock would most likely be exchanged for notes upon Mr. Sosnoff's successful completion of the tender offer. 
According to the rules of the Federal Reserve Board, the $475 million of securities would be considered secured by Caesars stock, the judge added. 

   The injunction would allow Mr. Sosnoff to begin a new tender offer, provided that he discloses information about his personal finances, spells out in proxy materials his probable intention to use Caesars' available cash to repay the debt for the acquisition and to sell off certain of the company's assets, including its Los Angeles corporate headquarters and its Lake Tahoe, Nev., facility. 
Mr. Sosnoff also would be required to disclose that regulatory approvals could delay his acquisition of the company as much six months. 

   Judge Rea's order calls for Caesars to circulate a disclaimer to statements it made in proxy materials that "the plan of recapitalization doesn't preclude a third party, including Mr. Sosnoff, from making a more attractive offer to the company's holders, either before or after the recapitalization is effected." 
Caesars also would be required to circulate to holders two memoranda from its investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., about the financial effects of the recapitalization. 
The injunction prevents Caesars from holding a shareholder vote on the plan until 30 days after the disclaimer and memoranda have been circulated. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff last week mounted a mail drive to adjourn the meeting until after the June 19 expiration of his $1.11 billion tender offer, which he had sweetened earlier in the week from the previous $32 a share. 
Caesars directors rejected the sweetened offer and recommended that shareholders adopt the recapitalization plan. 

   Caesars' recapitalization plan would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
Analysts last week valued the stock portion of the plan, or "stub," at about $8.50 a share, indicating a total market value of $34.75. 
But Caesars has valued the recapitalization plan at $35 a share. 

   The judge's ruling was issued after the markets closed yesterday. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Caesars common shares fell 12.5 cents, to close at $34.625. 

   In supplemental proxy material mailed to shareholders Friday, Caesars said it might change its proposed financing for the recapitalization by obtaining a senior floating-rate loan of about $100 million from "certain non-United States financial institutions" that it wouldn't identify. 
The company said that if it obtains the loan, it would reduce a planned offering of senior notes to $330 million from $430 million.
