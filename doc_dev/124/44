   Caesars World Inc. said its board "vigorously opposes" Martin T. Sosnoff's solicitation of holder consent to remove four inside directors. 

   Separately, Caesars plans to build a $150 million shopping complex at its Caesars Palace hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev. 

   In a letter to holders, Caesars Chairman Henry Gluck and President J. Terrence Lanni said the board believes that "Mr. 
Sosnoff's ultimate objective is to buy the company as cheaply as possible. 
In furtherance of this goal, we believe that Mr. Sosnoff's 'consent' proxy fight is intended primarily to cause uncertainty and chaos among our shareholders." 

   Last week, the New York investor said in a letter to holders that he seeks to remove from Caesars's nine-member board Messrs. 
Gluck and Lanni; Philip Ball, senior vice president and general counsel; and M. Peter Schweitzer, vice chairman. 

   As reported previously, Mr. Sosnoff is waging a $32-a-share, or $931.2 million, takeover battle for the operator of casino-hotels. 
To fend off his advances, Caesars earlier this month unveiled a recapitalization plan that offers holders $25 a share and stock in a more highly leveraged Caesars. 
Caesars said it would incur about $950 million of new debt under the recapitalization. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars's shares fell 25 cents, to $31.125. 

   The cost of the Las Vegas project will be borne by Gordon Co. of Los Angeles, a developer of retail properties, Caesars said. 
Gordon will operate the facility and lease the property from Caesars Palace. 

   The complex, which will have a Roman theme, will include 875,000 square feet of retail space, parking facilities for more than 3,000 cars, and a 1 1/2-acre open-air "Roman village bazaar," Caesars said. 
The first phase of the shopping complex is scheduled for completion in August 1990. 

   As part of the new development, Caesars said it plans its own additional $25 million expansion to add 25,000 square feet of casino space, a 125-seat restaurant and various food and beverage outlets. 
Caesars will finance that expansion and expects to complete it in early 1989.
