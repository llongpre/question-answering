   Stock market traders and analysts are giving a higher value to Caesars World Inc.'s recapitalization plan, unveiled over the weekend, than to a hostile, $28-a-share, offer from investor Martin Sosnoff. 

   Caesars proposed to pay holders a one-time, $25-a-share cash dividend and incur about $1 billion of new debt. 
Holders would retain equity in a more highly leveraged Caesars, a Los Angeles-based owner of casino hotels. 
Analysts and investment bankers placed the value of the equity at between $6 and $7 a share. 

   Takeover speculators yesterday pumped up Caesars World stock price well above Mr. Sosnoff's offer for the company, indicating that the market believes the casino company's complex recapitalization plan is considerably richer than Mr. Sosnoff's bid. 
Caesars closed yesterday at $30.625, up $1.375, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Traders said the closing price also reflected a roughly $1 discount to take into account the transaction's uncertainty and time lag, and a roughly 50-cent bonus to reflect the possibility of a higher bid from Mr. Sosnoff. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager who has several times sought a seat on the Caesars board, last month launched a $725.2 million tender offer for the 86.4% of Caesars shares that he doesn't already own. 

   As reported earlier, Mr. Sosnoff has said he is contemplating a new offer for Caesars. 
In a letter last Friday to Caesars Chairman Henry Gluck, Mr. Sosnoff said he was "prepared to offer a meaningful increase in price in the context of a friendly, negotiated transaction." 
Takeover bidders often hold out the possibility of a higher bid in return for a chance to inspect the target company's books. 

   Mr. Sosnoff didn't have any additional comment yesterday. 

   Should Mr. Sosnoff come back with another offer, "he's going to have to make it very sweet," said Marvin Roffman, an industry analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. 
Mr. Roffman said he regarded Caesars' 76-cents-a-share earnings estimate for its fiscal 1988 as based on conservative assumptions. 
Caesars' fiscal year ends July 31. 

   Analysts said that on the negative side, the Caesars proposal would sharply increase the company's leverage. 
The value of the plan could also decrease if interest rates rise before the end of the summer, when analysts expect the plan to receive regulatory approval. 
However, analysts asserted that the company had strong cash flow to pay down its debt and wouldn't have to sell any assets to fend off Mr. Sosnoff's bid. 

   The value of the $25 dividend would be reduced somewhat by taxes, analysts said. 
Mark K. Manson of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York said taxes and other considerations would reduce the dividend by about $1.50. 

   Caesars' $1 billion in new debt would include $200 million in bank borrowings and $800 million of junk bonds, or high-yield debt securities, to be sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., New York. 

   Gary Yalen, chief investment officer of Irving Trust Co., a large New York-based institutional holder in Caesars, said the high leverage could make Caesars' results "volatile and hard to predict." 
However, he said that "if management's earnings estimate is good . . . (the Caesars proposal is worth) more than the previous offer." 

   The heavy debt burden doesn't concern Dennis Forst, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles. 
"They were heavily leveraged five years ago and their strong cash flow was able to alleviate that. 
I'm comfortable that they'll be able to work down the (proposed) leverage over time."
