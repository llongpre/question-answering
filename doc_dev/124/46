   Martin T. Sosnoff said he discontinued his $35-a-share hostile takeover bid for Caesars World Inc., clearing the way for Caesars' $960 million recapitalization plan. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said he could no longer justify the cost to himself and the company of continuing his $1.11 billion takeover effort. 
Mr. Sosnoff is Caesars' largest holder, with a 12% stake in the company on a fully diluted basis. 

   Last week a federal judge in Los Angeles enjoined Mr. Sosnoff from continuing his tender offer on grounds that it violated a Federal Reserve Board rule governing the financing of corporate takeovers. 
The injunction would have allowed Mr. Sosnoff to begin a new tender offer, provided he disclosed certain information about his personal finances and intentions for the company. 

   Mr. Sosnoff said that since making his tender offer for the Los Angeles-based owner of casino-hotels, he has incurred about $30 million in "potential obligations." 
He added, "I have reluctantly concluded that the cost of continuing the tender offer is too high." 

   Some industry analysts said they doubt Mr. Sosnoff's estimate that his costs from the offer could approach $30 million. 
"That figure sounds awfully high to me," said Marvin B. Roffman, a securities analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., Philadelphia. 
"I'd like to see a breakdown." 

   A spokesman for Mr. Sosnoff said simply, "His expenses are what his expenses are." 

   Mr. Roffman said that Mr. Sosnoff "certainly must be thrilled" with the increase in Caesars stock price during the past three months. 
The market value of Mr. Sosnoff's 4.2 million Caesars common shares and common share equivalents has increased to about $142.3 million from about $102.9 million on March 6 -- the last trading date prior to Mr. Sosnoff's offer -- when the shares closed at $24.50. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars shares closed at $33.875 a share, down 37.5 cents. 

   In conceding that the company's share price has risen because of his tender offer, Mr. Sosnoff said that on an after-tax basis his efforts "have produced virtually no financial gain for myself." 
He added, "I want to make it clear that I will not countenance being classed as a corporate raider." 

   Caesars said it is "pleased to be moving forward" with its recapitalization plan. 
Under the plan, Caesars would give shareholders a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and stock in the reconstituted company. 
Analysts have valued the stock portion of the plan, or "stub," at about $8.50 a share, indicating a total market value of $34.75. 
Caesars has valued its plan at $35 a share. 
The company said a special shareholders meeting to vote on the arrangement and on the special cash dividend is scheduled for July 8. 

   In March Mr. Sosnoff launched a $28-a-share tender offer for all shares outstanding of Caesars, which operates Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nev., among other properties. 
After Caesars unveiled its recapitalization plan, Mr. Sosnoff raised his bid for the company to $32 a share. 
Caesars later increased the dividend portion of its recapitalization plan to $26.25 a share from $25 a share, and Mr. Sosnoff sweetened his tender offer to $35 a share. 

   Mr. Roffman, the analyst, said he isn't surprised that Caesars is continuing with the recapitalization, because it would significantly reduce the company's vulnerability to future takeover attempts. 
"If it isn't Mr. Sosnoff, it could be someone else," he said. 

   Mr. Roffman said that while the recapitalization plan would leave Caesars "very leveraged," the company's plan is "the lesser of two evils." 
Caesars plans to issue $330 million of senior notes and $330 million of subordinated debentures, borrow $200 million from a syndicate of banks and obtain a $100 million senior floating rate loan from "certain non-United States financial institutions" to finance the recapitalization. 

   In a parting shot, Mr. Sosnoff criticized the listing for "when issued" trading in Caesars' stub equity security on the New York Stock Exchange. 
He said it didn't provide "a reliable guide for comparing my tender offer to management's recapitalization plan." 

   He said the Big Board should consider in future takover battles whether to list "such nebulous securities as 'when issued' equity stubs." 

   Yesterday, a spokewoman for the New York Stock Exchange said there is nothing wrong with the exchange's listing practices.
