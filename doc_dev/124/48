   Caesars World Inc., buoyed by healthy results at its
Atlantic City, N.J., casino, posted a 63% increase in net
income for its fiscal first quarter.
   The Los Angeles-based casino operator reported net of
$22.9 million, or 95 cents a share, for the quarter ended
Oct. 31, compared with earnings of $14 million, or 60 cents a
share, a year earlier. Revenue was essentially flat at $233.1
million, compared with $235.6 million a year ago.

   Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive, said the New
Jersey property's operating results more than doubled,
boosted by higher table-game win percentages, a 16% rise in
slot revenue and lower expenses stemming from its
cost-control program. "The improvement was pretty much across
the board," he said.
   At Caesars' Nevada resorts, operating profit at Lake Tahoe
fell because of lower table-game win percentages and a drop
in table activity. That offset operating gains at Caesars
Palace in Las Vegas, which also had a drop in table activity.
The Las Vegas resort benefited from higher slot activity and
improved debt collection.
   The earnings sharply exceeded Wall Street's expectations.
Caesars' stock was quoted at $31.25, down $1.25, in late
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, which analysts
attributed to the unsettled market.
