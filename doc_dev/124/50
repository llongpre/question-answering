   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. stands to receive about $36.6 million upon successful completion of a nearly $1 billion recapitalization of Caesars World Inc. 

   But Drexel Burnham "may have actual or potential conflicts of interest" from its role as both the financial adviser and financing agent for the recapitalization plan, Caesars said in a proxy statement. 

   Caesars said Drexel Burnham issued fairness opinions on both a hostile tender offer by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff and Caesars' subsequent recapitalization plan, which Drexel Burnham will help finance. 
The investment banker said the Sosnoff offer is inadequate but that the company's recapitalization plan is fair. 

   Drexel Burnham couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Under the recapitalization plan, Caesars shareholders would receive a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 a share and would retain stock in the company. 
The gambling concern would incur $960 million of new debt to finance the plan, issuing $430 million of senior notes and $330 million of subordinated debentures -- both underwritten by Drexel Burnham -- and borrowing about $200 million from a syndicate of banks. 

   Caesars said that upon completion of the recapitalization, Drexel would receive total fees of about $9.7 million for its role as the investment adviser, about $25.3 million as sole underwriter of the note and debenture offerings, and about $1.6 million as the agent for the bank financing. 

   Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., which Caesars also retained to issue fairness opinions on the recapitalization plan, will receive total fees of about $1 million, Caesars said. 
Those fees aren't contingent upon successful completion of the recapitalization plan, however. 

   Caesars also said it agreed to indemnify both Drexel Burnham and Bear Stearns against "certain liabilities, including liabilities under the federal securities laws." 
The recapitalization would leave Caesars with total long-term debt of about $1.05 billion, including obligations under capital leases and current maturities, and a negative net worth -- or assets minus liabilities -- of about $508.8 million, based on projections for July 31, the end of the current fiscal year. 

   Given the effect of the recapitalization, Caesars said it projects 1988 net income of $20.5 million, or 54 cents a share, on revenue of $821.8 million. 
The company didn't estimate fiscal 1987 results, but in fiscal 1986, Caesars had net income of $41 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenue of $694.4 million. 

   Shareholders are to vote on the recapitalization plan June 12 in Los Angeles. 
As reported previously, Mr. Sosnoff has set a June 19 expiration date for his $32-a-share, or $931.2 million, tender offer.
