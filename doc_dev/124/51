   Caesars World Inc. said Tuesday its profit
rose 18 percent in the latest quarter, largely because of gains at
company's Las Vegas casino-hotels.
   Caesars, which has casinos and hotels in Las Vegas and Atlantic
City and resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains, said it earned
$17.4 million, or 70 cents a share, in the third quarter of its
1989 fiscal year. That was up from $14.7 million, or 60 cents a
share, in the third quarter of last year.
   Sales in the quarter ended April 30 were $221.8 million, up from
$195 million a year earlier.
   Caesars New Jersey Inc. reported third-quarter profit of $7.5
million, or 46 cents a share, up from $6.9 million, or 43 cents a
share, a year earlier. Sales for the subsidiary were $80.3 million,
up from $77.9 million a year earlier.
   The biggest contributor to earnings was from Nevada operations,
which benefited from increased casino gambling and higher win
percentages for the house.
   For the first nine months of the company's 1989 year, profit
declined 16 percent to $50.5 million, or $2.05 a share, from $60
million, or $2.20 a share, a year earlier. Sales in the first three
quarters were $666.4 million, up from $616.6 million a year earlier.
   Caesars earlier blamed the decline on expenses of a prize fight
_ the Sugar Ray Leonard-Donny Lalonde title match in November _ at
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in the second quarter.
