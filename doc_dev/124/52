   Caesars World Inc. said its board designated May 6 as the record date for shareholders eligible to vote on the company's proposed $1 billion recapitalization plan. 

   The operator of hotel-casinos said it hasn't scheduled a meeting date for holders to vote on the plan, which was designed by Caesars to ward off a hostile tender offer by New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. 
After Caesars announced the proposed recapitalization earlier this month, Mr. Sosnoff sweetened his offer to $32 a share, or $931.2 million, from the initial $28 a share. 

   As previously reported, the recapitalization plan calls for holders to receive a one-time cash dividend of $25 a share and stock in a more highly leveraged Caesars. 
The company's $1 billion of new debt would include $200 million of bank borrowings and $800 million of "junk" bonds, or high-yield debt securities, to be sold by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
