   The state gaming commission has
forced billionaire developer Donald Trump into an agreement that
will regulate his purchase of stocks, bonds or other assets of his
casino industry competitors.
   Trump _ who owns two Atlantic City casinos, a third under
construction and has plans for two non-casino hotels _ acceded to
the pact Monday in an attempt to assure renewal of his gaming
license by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission.
   Under the agreement, Trump will have to obtain prior approval
from state regulators before acquiring interests in gaming industry
corporations in Atlantic City.
   A vote on the proposed renewal of Trump's gaming license for the
Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino and Trump Castle Hotel &amp; Casino was
scheduled for May 10.
   Trump went along with the restriction after regulators
questioned his investment in an aborted plan to take over Caesars
World Inc. last year, his major competitor in Atlantic City.
   Trump bought 600,000 _ or 2.5 percent _ of the shares of Caesars
stock despite a warning in 1987 from Casino Control Commission
Chairman Walter N. Read.
   Although Trump is the dominant force in Atlantic City's real
estate and gaming industries, Caesar's Atlantic City Hotel-Casino
was the resort's top money winner in 1988, according to state
figures. The Trump Plaza was second.
   Caesars posted a $307.6 million profit for 1988, a 6.7 percent
increase over 1987. Trump Plaza was next, with $300.9 million, a 23
percent increase over the previous year.
   The agreement on stock purchases was worked out behind closed
doors between chairman Read and Trump.
   At the meeting, Read repeated his displeasure with Trump's
attempted takeover of Caesars World. Read and Commissioner Frank J.
Dodd have made it clear they do not want to see the industry run by
the free-wheeling rules of Monopoly, the board game that made
Atlantic City's street names famous.
   Besides two operating gaming halls, Trump's third casino, the
Taj Mahal, is under construction. The developer says it will be the
world's largest gaming hall when completed next year.
   Last month, Trump purchased the abandoned Penthouse casino
project and announced plans to turn it into a 1,000-room non-casino
hotel. He also has signed an agreement to buy the bankrupt Atlantis
Casino Hotel for $63 million and turn it into a hotel without
gaming.
