   Caesars World Inc. said it increased the cash dividend in its nearly $1 billion recapitalization plan to $26.25 a share from the previous $25 a share. 

   As previously reported, the gambling concern last month unveiled its plan, which calls for shareholders to receive the one-time cash dividend and stock in a more highly leveraged Caesars, in response to an unwanted takeover attempt by Martin T. Sosnoff. 

   Henry Gluck, Caesars' chairman and chief executive officer, said the company made the $44.3 million increase in the dividend because "we thought the recent market price didn't take into full account what the shareholders' values were going to be in the future." 

   Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst with Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., Philadelphia, said Caesars increased the dividend to boost its stock price past the $32-a-share currently being offered by Mr. Sosnoff. 
Mr. Sosnoff sweetened his offer from the original $28 a share last month after Caesars announced the recapitalization. 

   "They're doing it so the arbitragers don't turn in their stock at $32," Mr. Roffman said. 
"A lot of stock has been accumulated by the arbitragers in the last month. . . . 
The further the stock is below $32 a share, the more danger there is of Sosnoff's offer being successful." 

   Mr. Sosnoff said, "We feel we have a better offer on the table and this (dividend) increase by Caesars reflects their concern that this may be so." 
He declined to say whether he planned to sweeten his offer further. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Caesars shares closed at $32.50, up $1. 

   Caesars said it will incur a total of $960 million of debt to finance the revised plan, including about $200 million of borrowings from a syndicate of banks, and offerings of $430 million of senior notes and $330 million of subordinated debentures. 
Under the earlier plan, Caesars was to have offered $400 million of notes and $300 million of debentures. 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the company's investment banker, has said it is "highly confident" that it can arrange the entire financing, Caesars said. 

   The revised plan also calls for the company to reincorporate in Delaware after it makes the dividend payment, and possibly to amend its current articles of incorporation to include indemnification agreements, and increased employment and performance incentives for management. 

   A Caesars spokesman said the company will mail proxy materials related to the recapitalization plan today. 
Shareholders are to vote on the plan at a special meeting June 12 in Los Angeles. 

   Separately, Caesars posted a 42% increase in net income for its third quarter, ended April 30, to $10.7 million, or 35 cents a share, from $7.5 million, or 25 cents a share, in the year-earlier period. 
Included in net income for the latest period was a pre-tax charge of $5.3 million resulting from expenses related to Mr. Sosnoff's offer and the recapitalization plan. 
Revenue increased 20%, to $197.4 million from $164 million.
