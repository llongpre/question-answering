   Caesars World Inc. expects to report that per-share earnings increased about 60% in the second quarter ended Jan. 31, Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer, said. 

   Mr. Gluck said the per-share figure would be "in the range of 40 cents." 
In the year-earlier quarter, the hotel and casino concern had earnings of $7.5 million, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of $163.8 million. 

   The chairman said the company's program to establish a "balanced customer mix" of middle-income and lower-income players in addition to high rollers is "starting to work." 

   Mr. Gluck said the company expects to report improved results at Caesars Palace, the company's flagship hotel-casino in Las Vegas, Nev. 
He cited increased traffic in the casino since the opening of the World of Caesars, a simulated Roman temple with audio/visual and fiber-optic displays. 

   He said the company expects "the first profitable second quarter" in the history of Caesars's hotel-casino at Lake Tahoe, Calif. and improvement in earnings at its Atlantic City, N.J., hotel-casino. 
Mr. Gluck said Caesars's four honeymoon resorts in the Poconos "continue to be performing well." 

   Analysts have forecast fiscal 1987 earnings of $1.55 a share. 
Mr. Gluck declined to comment specifically on the predictions except to say, "if we're in the 40-cent range (for the second quarter), we're ahead of what the expectations are." 
For the first quarter ended Oct. 31, the company reported earnings of $15 million, or 50 cents a share, on revenue of $198 million. 

   For the year ended July 31, 1986, Caesars earned $41 million, or $1.36 a share, on revenue of $694.4 million. 

   Mr. Gluck said the company is "reevaluating on a monthly basis" whether to sell or build on the company's seven acres of undeveloped land along the Atlantic City boardwalk. 

   Mr. Gluck said the impending opening of two new casinos in Atlantic City "won't have a dramatic impact on the high end of the business," Caesars's bread-and-butter clientele. 
"I see this as increasing the size of the market for us to participate in," he said. 

   Caesars shares closed Friday at $23.125, up $1.625, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
