   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said the debt ratings of Caesars World Inc. and its unit will remain on S&amp;P's CreditWatch with negative implications following the company's proposed recapitalization plan. 

   The $230 million of debt issues include Caesars World's double-B senior debt and single-B-plus subordinated debt, and Caesars World Finance Corp.'s single-B-plus subordinated debt. 

   Under the proposed recapitalization plan, the hotel and casino company would incur about $1 billion of new debt to finance a $25-a-share special dividend and payment of about $222.5 million of existing debt. 
Caesars initiated the recapitalization to fight off a takeover bid from New York investor Martin Sosnoff. 
Caesars debt was initially placed on CreditWatch March 9, after Mr. Sosnoff made his bid. 

   S&amp;P said the terms of Caesars' plan would "violate the dividend covenants in the rated debt's indentures and likely force refinancing of the issues." 
The senior debt rating of the company would drop to single-B because of heavy debt, an expected sharp drop in earnings, and a low level of cash flow relative to debt, S&amp;P said. 

   S&amp;P also said that if Mr. Sosnoff should sweeten his bid and it should succeed, it "would markedly raise Caesars World's financial risk and lead to a large drop in net income and cash flow." 

   A spokesman for Caesars World said the company wouldn't comment.
