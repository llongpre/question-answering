   Caesars World Inc., Los Angeles, a hotel and gambling concern, said it extended to 12:01 a.m. EDT Wednesday the deadline on its tender offer for as many as 11 million of its common shares. 

   The company said it extended the deadline to allow it to complete financing for the buy-back. 
As previously reported, Caesars began an offering of $265 million of 13 1/2% subordinated notes due 1997 to fund a portion of the as much as $400 million it may need to buy the shares and pay related fees and expenses. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars was at $30, up 25 cents a share.
