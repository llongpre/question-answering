   The Federal Trade Commission has
allowed billionaire developer Donald Trump to buy more shares of
Caesars World Inc. stock, a Trump official said Friday.
   Trump has already bought a block of Caesars World stock. In
mid-December, he filed a notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act for
a determination whether continued purchases would violate antitrust
laws.
   Susan Heilbron, an executive vice president of the Trump
Organization, said the FTC notified Trump on Monday that he could
buy more stock.
   ``We did not receive any requests for additional information and
they raised no questions about the antitrust implications,'' Ms.
Heilbron said.
   In his request to the FTC, Trump indicated he ``has the
good-faith intention, subject to price, availability and necessary
approvals,'' to acquire 15 percent of the stock. He also indicated
he may ``decide to seek control of (Caesars) through the acquisition
of 50 percent (or) more of the outstanding voting securities.''
   Trump, owner of two casino-hotels in Atlantic City and one under
construction, has not indicated how much stock he purchased in the
rival gaming company. But provisions of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act
require people or companies to file with the trade commission when
they amass $15 million worth of stock in another company.
   The day after Trump officials received the notice from the FTC,
Caesars shareholders adopted a shareholder rights program designed
to prevent unfriendly takeovers.
   Under the new plan, if someone buys 20 percent of Caesars stock,
or if someone with 10 percent appears only interested in forcing the
company to buy back the stock at a premium, or if a person is
unqualified to hold a gaming license, then all other Caesars
shareholders have the right to buy additional stock at half its
market value.
   Trump has not commented on his involvement with Caesars. Ms.
Heilbron also said that even after the FTC ruling, ``Mr. Trump would
not comment on his plans.''
