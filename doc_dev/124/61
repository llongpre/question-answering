   Caesars World Inc. said earnings for its fourth quarter,
ended July 31, more than doubled to $18.5 million, or 77
cents a share, reflecting a change of fortune for the casino
operator despite continuing weakness in the industry.
   A year earlier, Caesars had net income of $7.4 million, or
31 cents a share.

   Revenue rose 9.4% to $244.6 million from $223.7 million a
year earlier. The gains were fueled by strong operating
results at hotel-casinos in Las Vegas and in Atlantic City,
N.J.
   For the fiscal year, net income rose 35% to $49.6 million,
or $2.09 a share, from $36.8 million, or $1.52 a share, a
year earlier. Revenue rose 4.4% to $908.3 million from $870.2
million. Unallocated expenses for the quarter and the year
rose because of costs from employee benefit and incentive
programs, and stock appreciation rights, respectively.
   The unexpectedly good results combined with yesterday's
strong stock market to boost Caesars' stock $2.75 a share to
$27.875 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Caesars had struggled through a tough 1990, with two major
new competitors in Las Vegas and Atlantic City trying to win
away its premium customers and construction at the flagship
Caesars Palace in Las Vegas causing some disruption to its
business as well. More recently, the recession and Persian
Gulf War helped to damp leisure travel and the casino
business.
   Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer, said
the quarterly and yearly improvements arose from marketing
shifts and other changes that should lead to sustainable
growth.
   Operating gains in Nevada reflected increased business.
Table-game activity rose 13% in the quarter, while win
percentages, or amounts retained after paying wagers but
before expenses, also were unusually high.
   Win percentages can fluctuate broadly at casinos that
offer high-stakes table games, and they don't necessarily
reflect operating improvements. The increased competition
also has led to higher bad-debt reserves at Caesars Palace.
Mr. Gluck declined to give a figure for the reserves, but he
said they have been handled in a "realistic, conservative"
manner.
   In Atlantic City, the improvement resulted from major
gains in slot-machine business and lower marketing costs.
Slot revenue rose 16% for the quarter, compared with an 8%
increase in the overall market. Caesars attributed that in
part to its new parking garage and a decrease in subsidized
bus business.
   Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said
Caesars has more than regained business that had been
diverted to its new competitors and isn't likely to report
big increases in bad debt.
