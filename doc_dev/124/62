   Martin T. Sosnoff, a New York investor, said he has contracts to buy 1,544,300 Caesars World Inc. common shares. 

   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Mr. Sosnoff said that from June 16 to last Tuesday, he bought contracts to purchase the Los Angeles-based resort company's common shares for $8.375 to $9.375 each. 
Mr. Sosnoff also said that on June 16 he entered into a contract to sell 600,000 common shares at $8.375 each. 

   Mr. Sosnoff holds 4,217,675 Caesars common shares, or a 13.7% stake in the common shares outstanding, not counting the purchase and sale contracts. 

   The contracts are contingent upon Caesars World's payment of the special one-time dividend of $26.25 a share pursuant to the company's recapitalization plan, the filing said. 

   In New York, Mr. Sosnoff wasn't available to comment. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Sosnoff last month discontinued his $35-a-share hostile takeover bid for Caesars, clearing the way for its $960 million recapitalization plan. 

   In withdrawing his bid, Mr. Sosnoff didn't sign a standstill agreement with Caesars that would prohibit him from buying additional Caesars stock. 
But Wall Street executives say it is unlikely that he will renew his hostile bid. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Caesars stock closed at $35.25, up 12.5 cents.
