   CAESARS WORLD INC., Los Angeles, adjourned until July 13 a special meeting of shareholders to vote on the company's proposed $960 million recapitalization plan. 
The vote, which was to have been taken last Friday, was postponed after a federal judge in Los Angeles ordered the gambling concern to delay the action for at least one month. 
As reported earlier, the judge also enjoined investor Martin T. Sosnoff from continuing his $35-a-share tender offer for the company on the grounds that the offer violates a Federal Reserve Board ruling related to the financing of takeovers.
