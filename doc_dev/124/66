Three casino executives who worked for billionaire real estate developer Donald 
J. Trump were among five people killed Tuesday afternoon in a helicopter crash 
in New Jersey about 40 miles north of Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
The three officials, including Trump's top two gaming industry executives in 
Atlantic City, were returning from New York, where they had been promoting an 
upcoming boxing match between junior welterweights Hector Camacho and Vinny 
Pazienza. 
</P>
<P>
The three casino executives killed were Stephen Hyde, Mark Grossinger Etess and 
Jonathan Benanav. The two remaining victims, who were not immediately 
identified, were believed to be the pilot and co-pilot of the helicopter, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde ran Trump's two operating casinos in Atlantic City, known as Trump Plaza 
and Trump Castle, while Etess was going to run the Taj Mahal, the $1-billion 
casino and hotel that Trump plans to open in Atlantic City next April. Benanav 
was senior vice president of Trump Plaza, where the Camacho-Pazienza fight is 
to be held Feb. 3. 
</P>
<P>
"They were three fabulous young men in the prime of their lives," Trump said in 
a statement issued from his New York office. "No better human beings ever 
existed. We're deeply saddened by this devastating tragedy. Our hearts go out 
to their families." 
</P>
<P>
The leased helicopter crashed in a heavily wooded area on the median strip of 
the Garden State Parkway that runs down the New Jersey coastline. There were no 
survivors, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Murray, of East Providence, R.I., said he was camping nearby when he 
witnessed the helicopter crash to the ground. The "rotor stopped spinning and 
became disconnected from the helicopter and tumbled," Murray told the 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Devoted Family Men 
</P>
<P>
Both Hyde, 43, and Etess, 38, were respected executives who were popular with 
their peers. "Nice is not a word that is often used in this business, but they 
were," said David Gardener, vice president of the Casino Assn. of Atlantic 
City. 
</P>
<P>
Hyde, a devout Mormon with a large family, was a veteran casino executive who 
had worked for gaming companies in both Las Vegas and Atlantic City, including 
Caesars World, Golden Nugget and the Sands. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a certified public accountant, he joined Caesars World after working 
for the company as their outside auditor, according to Michael Rumbolz, who 
works for Trump in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Etess was a fourth-generation hotelier whose family founded the famous 
Grossinger's resort in the Catskills, in the heart of the so-called Borscht 
Belt, that was so popular with generations of New York tourists. 
</P>
<P>
He left the family business in 1983 for Atlantic City, where he went to work as 
the marketing director for the Golden Nugget casino. He joined the Trump 
Organization in 1986 and had since played a major role in bringing big-name 
fights to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
A slick dresser and easy talker, Etess was a combination of canny promoter and 
devoted father who talked about his two children more fervently than he did his 
job to run the Taj. "That's what it's all about," he said in a recent interview 
with The Times, pointing to a picture of his children in his cramped office 
across the street from the Taj. 
</P>
<P>
Though Trump owns a helicopter service that flies between Manhattan and 
Atlantic City, the craft that crashed was identified as an eight-seat Agusta 
109A leased from Paramount Aviation in New Jersey.
