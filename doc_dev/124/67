ITT, the US conglomerate that has been seeking to expand in the leisure
industry, is to buy Caesars World, one of the best-known names in gaming,
for Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.03bn) in cash.
ITT has agreed to buy the company for Dollars 67.50 a share through a tender
offer beginning on Friday. Caesars World had net income of Dollars 78.4m on
revenues of Dollars 1bn in the year to last July. It has three casino and
hotel complexes  - in Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and on the shore of Lake
Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada.
The biggest of the three, Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, occupies an 80-acre
site on the famed Las Vegas Strip. It is based on an ancient Rome theme,
with toga-clad dealers and a massive chariot parked in a corner. Zagat, a US
hotel guide, describes the hotel rooms as 'like a bordello', with circular
beds and overhead mirrors.
ITT's businesses include insurance, communications and information,
automotive sales, fluid technology and defence. Recently, however, it has
been trying to expand in the growth sector of leisure and entertainment,
where it is already active through its ownership of the Sheraton hotel
chain.
Earlier this year ITT began the process of taking over Ciga, the Italian
luxury hotel group, of which it now owns 70 per cent. In August it acquired
the Madison Square Garden sports and entertainment complex in New York for
Dollars 1.1bn in partnership with Cablevision Systems, a US cable television
company.
In September ITT said it was seeking buyers for its financial services
subsidiary, ITT Financial, in a sale that could fetch Dollars 3bn-Dollars
4bn. It wanted to use the funds to expand its leisure interests further.
ITT is already in the gaming industry: it owns the Sheraton Desert Inn hotel
and casino complex in Las Vegas and a riverboat casino in Tunica, Missouri.
In May it said it was going to build a Dollars 750m Desert Kingdom hotel and
casino complex in Las Vegas, but in October it cancelled the plans.
Yesterday's agreement indicated that ITT now plans to buy existing gaming
interests rather than build its own.
