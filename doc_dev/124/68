   Over the past few years, Wall Street has been more
inclined to bury Caesars World Inc. than praise it. But if
its recent performance is any indication, the big casino
operator is recapturing its former glory.
   Caesars has been posting unexpectedly strong earnings in
the wake of a recession and an onslaught of new competition.
The company plans to release today its results for its fiscal
second quarter ended Jan. 31. Caesars expects to report that
earnings soared to between $22.2 million and $23.8 million
from $4 million last year. Per-share net is expected to range
between 92 cents and 99 cents, compared with 17 cents a year
ago.

   High-rolling customers, lured away by glitzy new
properties, have once again begun to throw their fortunes
onto Caesars' tables. Even Caesars' Atlantic City, N.J., slot
business has flourished, thanks in part to a $40 million
garage bedecked by giant statues of Caesar Augustus.
   Granted, Caesars' recent earnings have been helped by
exceptionally good luck at the gambling tables -- meaning
"win," or amounts retained after paying off wagers but before
expenses, has been higher than usual. Laws of probability
demand that win percentages return to normal, so any casino
depending on high rollers will suffer from volatile earnings
swings. But the fact remains that much of Caesars' gains come
from operating improvements, not luck.
   The company's stock, which had been lagging behind the
casino group as a whole, was quoted yesterday in late New
York Stock Exchange trading at a 52-week high of $38.375, up
$1.50 on the day.
   After listening to two years of criticism from competitors
and Wall Street observers, chairman and chief executive
officer Henry Gluck says the payoff is at hand.
   "I've always felt that if we do what we're supposed to in
terms of our own business, we'll gain more business than we
lose," Mr. Gluck says from his glass-walled high-rise office
overlooking Beverly Hills, Calif.
   For years, Caesars Palace reigned in all its kitschy
splendor as the undisputed champ of high-end casino play.
High rollers flocked to lose millions in darkened settings of
ersatz marble columns and cocktail waitresses in low-cut
"Roman" garb, and its championship boxing matches and
big-name entertainers made it famous world-wide. Tourists
streamed in to see how the other half lived, dropping
quarters in the slot machines on the way out.
   But at the peak of a building boom in late 1989, Mirage
Resorts Inc. opened the hugely successful Mirage casino-hotel
right next door to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. And in April
1990, Donald Trump launched the not-so-successful Taj Mahal,
a behemoth that swamped Atlantic City with new casino space
and ended up in bankruptcy court.
   Caesars, unaccustomed to such head-on competition, fought
back by upgrading its casinos in Las Vegas, Lake Tahoe and
Atlantic City rather than building second properties in those
markets. And despite industry criticism, Mr. Gluck resisted
the rush to build more rooms in Las Vegas or to join the pack
of big competitors building slot palaces in Laughlin, Nev., a
small but fast-growing town 90 miles south of Las Vegas.
   Instead, the company invested in the Atlantic City garage
to snare profitable drive-in customers, and in new marketing
programs aimed at high-limit slot players. The Boardwalk
property's slot growth has been double the industry average
for several months, boosting slot machines to 55% of its
business there.
   At its flagship Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, the company
sank more than $150 million into such amenities as 40,000
square feet of new casino space, new suites, facelifts for
its 1,500 rooms and more parking. The company also stepped up
its domestic and international marketing programs to fight
for its share of big-spending customers.
   The strategy appears to have worked. "In their niche,
they've really beaten back the competition," says Harold
Vogel, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "With the Taj and
the Mirage, they've proven they can go up against them very
successfully."
   Now Caesars is about to fire off a new marketing salvo
with the May opening of the Forum, a lavish shopping
center-cum-tourist attraction at the north end of Caesars
Palace. The ritzy 240,000-square-foot complex, built and run
by Melvin Simon &amp; Associates and Gordon Co., will boast
exclusive shops and trendy restaurants in a bid to play off
the city's growing reputation as an entertainment and
vacation spot.
   For those who can't afford to shop at the Forum's Escada
and Gianni Versace or eat at its new Spago restaurant, the
Forum will offer more mainstream stores and plenty of things
to gawk at for free.
   Even with two huge new Las Vegas casinos planned by Mirage
Resorts and MGM Grand Inc., observers say the Forum should
help Caesars remain a big tourist attraction. Aside from the
money spent to upgrade the casino, Caesars has no direct
investment in the Forum.
   Still, some skeptics question whether the center will
siphon money into the casino's coffers as planned. Indeed,
the Forum has five entrances but only one exit, which funnels
shoppers directly by an army of slot machines in the Palace's
new casino area. Mr. Gluck concedes that shoppers may rebel
against the design, but says it's essential to the tie
between the casino and the shops.
   Even if the Forum is a hit, questions loom as Caesars
looks for future growth. The challenge, analysts say, will be
for Caesars to strike the delicate balance of retaining a
high-rolling image without missing out on the lower-end
business that's expected to provide most of the industry
growth over the next decade.
   Even those who think Caesars will fare relatively well say
the company isn't likely to lead the charge into new markets
or innovative projects. "They still have a lot of staying
power," says Margo Vignola, a Salomon Brothers Inc. casino
analyst. "But they're just not on the cutting edge."
   Some voice frustration over Caesars' penchant for dabbling
in businesses such as perfume and logo merchandising that
aren't big moneymakers but demand management time. They also
look somewhat askance at the company's efforts to exploit its
name by plastering it on cruise-ship casinos.
   There's even an Aaron Spelling-produced network television
show set at Caesars Palace, called "Hearts Are Wild."
   Mr. Gluck argues that those ventures are worth the time
and money devoted to them, as they all are designed to push
the Caesars name. He adds that the company is constantly
looking at projects that might expand its franchise
domestically or overseas as new casino markets become
legalized.
   "Our major asset is our name, our image," Mr. Gluck says.
"But we know where our money comes from, and that's the
casino. You have to remember that."
