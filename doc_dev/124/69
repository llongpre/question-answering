   Caesars World Inc. said it expects to report essentially flat earnings for the fiscal-fourth quarter and lower earnings for the fiscal year ended July 31, triggering a drop in its stock despite forecasts of steady gains for fiscal 1990. 

   Caesars estimated its fourth-quarter net income at between 65 and 70 cents a share, or about $16 million to $17.3 million, compared with 69 cents a share or $17 million a year earlier. 
Revenue is expected to have risen about 8% to roughly $234 million. 

   The company said increased business was offset by higher bad-debt expenses and general and administrative costs. 

   For fiscal 1989, the company expects net of between $2.70 and $2.75 a share, or between $66.7 million and $68 million. 
Caesars posted net of $2.90 a share, or $77 million, in fiscal l988. 

   Caesars' dropped $3.625 a share, to close at $39.375 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, erasing part of its gain in recent weeks from analysts' favorable recommendations based on asset values, market share and other factors. 

   Steven Eisenberg, an analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., said the soft earnings don't necessarily signal a weakening of the company's underlying business. 
"If you have a lot of high-end customers, which Caesars does, it's not surprising," he said. 

   Renovations under way at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas are expected to position the company for the onslaught of competition in the Nevada city starting in 1990. 
Caesars has maintained a strong position in the Atlantic City, N.J., market despite slower growth there, which analysts say is likely to continue.
