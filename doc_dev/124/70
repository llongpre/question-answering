   Bally Manufacturing Corp. agreed to buy Golden Nugget Inc.'s Atlantic City, N.J., casino and some land nearby for about $140 million in cash and stock and the assumption of a $299 million mortgage. 

   The move could thwart a threatened takeover of Bally by Donald Trump, and Wall Street sources are speculating that the New York investor now will make a bid for asset-rich Resorts International Inc. 

   Chicago-based Bally said its board on Saturday approved an agreement to pay Las Vegas, Nev.-based Golden Nugget about $60 million in cash and $40 million in preferred stock and to assume a $299 million mortgage on the Golden Nugget casino and hotel. 
Bally also agreed to pay about $40 million in cash for some undeveloped land near the casino. 

   In addition to possibly deterring Mr. Trump from seeking control, Bally would gain a bigger share of the Atlantic City gambling business -- it already owns the Park Place casino and, combined with the Golden Nugget, would have about a 20% share of the market. 
Also, the Golden Nugget has consistently been among the top profit makers among the 11 casinos there. 

   While the Golden Nugget has one of Atlantic City's smallest casinos, it frequently tops other casinos in gross winnings. 
Analysts attribute its success to its ability to lure high rollers and traffic from the boardwalk. 

   Marvin B. Roffman, analyst with the securities firm Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, said the Golden Nugget last year had the second highest gross casino wins with about $249 million. 
He said Caesars, owned by Caesars World Inc., had the highest with about $259 million. 

   The acquisition will give Bally the "highest gross wins in Atlantic City," he said. 

   As previously reported, Mr. Trump, a New York real estate developer and investor, has said he holds a 9.9% stake in Bally and might raise that to more than 25%. 
Bally countered by adopting a so-called poison-pill takeover defense and saying it was considering restructuring. 

   Mr. Trump already owns two Atlantic City casinos, and New Jersey law limits a single investor to three casinos. 

   Mr. Trump couldn't be reached for comment over the weekend. 

   But sources speculated that Mr. Trump would turn his attention to Resorts, an Atlantic City-based operator of casinos and hotels that has been in limbo since its chairman and founder, James M. Crosby, died unexpectedly in April. 
Mr. Crosby left 340,783 Class B shares in trust, representing a 42% voting control in Resorts. 
Although some heirs have indicated a willingness to sell their holdings at the right price, the estate repeatedly has rejected offers by Dallas-based Pratt Hotel Corp. Pratt's latest offer of $135 a share for Class B, in a bid to obtain 51% voting control, has been extended to Feb. 13. 

   Bally said that it has arranged to finance the cash portion of the Golden Nugget purchase with bank borrowings and that the preferred stock would be a new series of 10% nonconvertible shares. 
The company said the purchase wouldn't reduce earnings per share in the near term. 

   Robert E. Mullane, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement that the acquisition was part of his plan to make Bally "the preeminent gaming company in the world." 
Bally owns one casino each in Las Vegas and Reno, Nev., and has interests in theme parks and health clubs and makes gambling and video equipment. 

   The name of the Golden Nugget likely would be changed. 
Completion of the purchase is subject to regulatory approvals. 
Both companies' boards approved the transaction, Bally said in a statement. 
A Golden Nugget official refused any comment, saying the company would issue a statement today. 

   Golden Nugget common shares closed Friday at $11.875, up 37.5 cents, and Bally shares closed at $20.125, down 75 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Resorts Class B shares closed at $120.50, down $2.50, in composite trading on the American Stock Exchange.
