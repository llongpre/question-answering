   Caesars World Inc. is betting it has a nose for upscale fragrances. 

   The hotel and casino operator said its merchandising subsidiary has retained Roth/Horner &amp; Associates, a Beverly Hills, Calif., concern that designed and marketed the successful Giorgio perfume line, to develop a new line of men's and women's fragrances. 

   The scent hasn't been developed yet, said Philip Sobel, president of Caesars World Merchandising Inc. 
But the idea is to come up with a fragrance to "fit in with the general life style of what Caesars is all about -- stimulating, exciting, different, sensual," he said. 

   The fragrance also will be priced for high rollers, with perfume selling for about $150 an ounce, and three ounces of cologne going for about $40. 
Mr. Sobel said these products, to appear on the market in the next eight months, will initially be sold at retail shops at the company's seven resorts, and then by direct mail. 

   Caesars said it hopes eventually to have a complete line of toiletries, including soaps, shampoos and other products.
