   Investor Martin T. Sosnoff, rebuffed in a June attempt to buy Caesars World Inc., sold almost two-thirds of his 16.04% stake in the hotel and gambling concern in last week's plunging stock market. 

   He apparently received $40 million for 2.5 million shares that could have been tendered to Caesars or sold on the open market last month for almost $75 million. 
Caesars held a so-called Dutch auction last month and bought back 11 million shares. 
Mr. Sosnoff said at the time that he didn't tender any shares because he viewed his holding as a "good long-term investment." 

   Yesterday, Mr. Sosnoff declined to comment on last week's sales, or those of a week earlier when he sold 338,975 shares. 

   Currently, Mr. Sosnoff holds 1,374,800 shares, or a 5.68% stake. 
In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, the company's stock rose $1.75 to close at $16.50 a share. 

   When Mr. Sosnoff began selling shares during last Monday's market crash, Caesars was selling at $20 a share, closing that day at $14 and sliding to $10.50 the following day -- the range in which the investor said in a filing that he sold the shares. 
He sold the prior week's shares for $22.50 to $25.25 each. 

   Mr. Sosnoff acquired his stake from May to September of 1986, for $16.51 to $20.38 a share.
