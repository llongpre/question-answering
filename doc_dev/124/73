   Money managers are baffled by the bid for Caesars World by Martin Sosnoff, who runs Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital. 
While the New York investor has made many smart investments for himself and his clients, money managers aren't sure he should be trying to buy an entire company. 

   People such as Mr. Sosnoff who run institutional money management firms don't usually make bids for companies. 
John Neff of Wellington Management says that if he were devoting time to pursuing a takeover target, "My clients would have a right to ask if I was paying attention to the wider range of investment opportunities." 

   Mr. Sosnoff, who yesterday launched a tender offer for the 86.4% of Caesars he doesn't already own, said he has provisional commitments from lenders to finance much of the $725.2 million, $28-a-share bid. 
His current Caesars stake, put at 13.6%, is a personal holding, he notes, so Atalanta/Sosnoff clients aren't involved in the offer. 

   Mr. Sosnoff says that if his bid succeeds, he will retain existing management. 
He said in a letter to Henry Gluck, Caesars' chairman, "I want this to be a friendly transaction." 
But Mr. Sosnoff concedes his offer might not be perceived as friendly: "Many corporate managers feel it's strategically wrong to give up power." 
Caesars said it is studying the bid and urged shareholders to take no action. 

   Some analysts believe Mr. Sosnoff's bid is a device to attract a higher bid for Caesars so he can unload his holdings. 
Mr. Sosnoff could have bid for Caesars six months ago, when the stock was in the teens, says Daniel Lee, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert. 

   Mr. Sosnoff, who has owned Caesars shares for about four years and once tried to get a board seat, says he bid for Caesars now because its earnings are picking up and he believes interest rates might soon move upward. 
Currently, Mr. Sosnoff says, he could issue junk bonds with a 10 3/4% coupon, and Caesars' cash flow would cover total interest 1.6 times. 

   Mr. Sosnoff's bid for Caesars, though, may be "a recognition play," says a former associate. 
Sources say Mr. Sosnoff is personally worth about $200 million, including stakes in Atalanta/Sosnoff and Caesars and his personal art collection. 
He may be seeking greater public awareness of his success as an investor, they say. 

   Mr. Sosnoff's second book, "Silent Investor, Silent Loser," will be launched tomorrow. 
It criticizes company managers, institutional investors and the financial press. 
"I felt I could say something better than anybody else about what goes on in the investment community," he says. 
And beginning Monday, Mr. Sosnoff will write a weekly column for the New York Post on investment subjects. 

   His new book also recounts a telephone conversation about Caesars with Michael Milken, Drexel's junk bond chief. 
Mr. Sosnoff pointed out he was a bigger stockholder than any board member. 
But Mr. Milken said, "In the real world, you wait until they offer you" a board seat. 

   Mr. Sosnoff isn't a typical institutional investor. 
As has Saul Steinberg of Reliance Group Holdings, he's often taken big stakes in companies. 

   Atalanta/Sosnoff in the past has bought several of the same stocks as Reliance, such as Zenith National. 
In the 1970s Mr. Sosnoff made a fortune by buying Reliance shares and selling them when the company went private. 

   Another smart move was selling part of Atalanta/Sosnoff to the public at 14 1/2 last year. 
The stock dived to 9 1/4 before edging up, and Atalanta/Sosnoff started buying back shares at about 11. 
Yesterday, the stock closed at 13 1/2, off 3/8. 

   Mr. Sosnoff sometimes buys stock for himself at a lower price than he buys it for clients. 
Examples are Comdisco, not a very successful investment, and Triangle Industries, a successful one. 
But Mr. Sosnoff says he sometimes buys stock for himself before he's sure it is right for his clients. 

   Instead of buying a gambling concern, Mr. Sosnoff should expand Atalanta/Sosnoff, some say, by making financial acquisitions, as earlier he indicated he might. 
He hasn't spent the money from the public offering because financial acquisitions aren't available "at reasonable prices," he says. 

   Mr. Sosnoff may be simply following Donald Trump's lead. 
The New York developer has made big profits in recent months on gambling investments. 
And if nobody tops Mr. Sosnoff's bid, says Drexel's Mr. Lee, Mr. Sosnoff might just buy Caesars.
