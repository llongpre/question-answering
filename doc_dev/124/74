   The 12 casinos here reported that winnings in September soared 18% from year-earlier levels, marking the fifth consecutive month that the industry reported revenue of more than $200 million. 

   According to the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, winnings last month increased to $222.3 million from $188.5 million in September 1986, when 11 casinos were operating. 
When results from the newest operation, Showboat Inc.'s Showboat Casino, Hotel and Bowling Center, are excluded, winnings are up 9.6% from last year. 
Showboat Casino opened in March. 

   Winnings are analogous to revenue and are calculated after all bets have been paid but before subtracting taxes, operating costs and other expenses. 

   Trump Plaza, owned by Donald Trump, the New York real estate developer, reported that winnings last month rose 32% to $22.4 million from $17 million. 
Trump Plaza had the largest gain of the group. 
Caesars World Inc.'s Caesars casino had the highest winnings for the month at $25.5 million, up 13% from $22.5 million in September 1986. 

   Elsinore Corp.'s Atlantis, operating under federal bankruptcy-law protection, reported the biggest percentage decline, as its winnings fell 45% to $4.4 million from $7.9 million. 
The Atlantis is in the midst of a labor dispute.
