Donald Trump hired former top casino regulator Mike Rumbolz to head his Nevada 
operations, an indication that the financier intends to become an active player 
in that state's gambling industry. Trump, who recently sold a large part of his 
New Jersey gambling empire to Merv Griffin, last month got federal antitrust 
clearance to buy more than 15% of the stock of Caesars World Inc., which owns 
one of the premier Las Vegas hotel-casinos, Caesars World. Rumbolz, whose term 
as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board expired in December, said he had 
been negotiating with Trump since January.
