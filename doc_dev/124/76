Investor Buys Caesars World Stake: San Diego real estate investor M. Larry 
Lawrence has purchased about 400,000 shares of Los Angeles-based Caesars World 
Inc., the casino operator.

The stake, less than 2%, is an investment accumulated over four months, said 
Alan Aiello, investment manager for Lawrence, who owns the Hotel del Coronado 
in San Diego. "We bought it not as a shot at a buyout, but as a core holding," 
Aiello said. There has been speculation that Caesars is a takeover candidate. 
Caesars stock fell 12.5 cents to $15.125 Wednesday.
