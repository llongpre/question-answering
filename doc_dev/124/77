   Rodney Dangerfield was awarded $725,000 on
Thursday by jury that believed the comedian's eye problems were
caused by a steam bath accident at Caesars Palace.
   Dangerfield sued the casino-hotel for $5 million after Caesars
balked at paying him for shows he missed after he claimed he was
burned in a steam bath in March 1988.
   ``We showed Rodney some respect,'' an unidentified juror said
after Dangerfield thanked jurors as they left U.S. District Court.
   The jury deliberated less than a day before awarding Dangerfield
$225,000 for five missed performances and $500,000 for pain and
suffering.
   The jury ruled that Dangerfield's contract obligated Caesars to
pay for the missed shows because the injury should have excused him
from performing. It rejected a $100,000 countersuit filed by
Caesars against its former headliner.
   ``The truth won out,'' said Dangerfield. He decried as
``nonsense and untrue'' Caesars' accusations that he used drugs.
   ``I'm surprised they went to that level to degrade me falsely
like they did,'' Dangerfield said. ``All they did in this entire
trial was to try to degrade my character.
   ``I wasn't concerned with the amount of money,'' he said.
``Money is money. I was concerned about the truth. I was right. I
wouldn't have gone through this unless I was right.''
   Dangerfield said Henry Gluck, chairman of the resort's parent
Caesars World Inc., had refused an offer to settle for $225,000.
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Bruce Aguilera, attorney for
the casino. ``We'll have to have our lawyers look at the case.
   Dangerfield sought $5 million in damages plus $45,000 for each
show he missed the week of the accident, claiming Caesars was
negligent in installing and maintaining a steam bath.
   The hotel, in its countersuit, accused Dangerfield of breaching
his contract and contended during the 2{-week-long trial that the
comedian did not suffer permanent damage.
   The 68-year-old comic testified he was hit in the eyes by a
burst of steam as he opened the door to the steam room on March 16,
1988.
   He skipped four performances, then returned for two shows but
walked off the stage without performing on closing night because he
was angry that Caesars wanted to withhold payment for the missed
shows.
   Caesars claimed Dangerfield went out on the town two nights that
he claimed he was too hurt to perform. A doctor who examined him
after the incident said that Dangerfield could have performed.
Other eye specialists testified for the casino-hotel that symptoms
Dangerfield claimed to suffer only since the accident actually
first appeared in the 1970s.
   However, an eye doctor who has examined Dangerfield three times
in the last year testified that he continues to suffer pain from
the steam injury.
