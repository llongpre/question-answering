   LAS VEGAS -- Caesars World Inc. and Golden Nugget Inc. are
exploring the possibility of operating casinos on the tiny
southern Mariana island of Tinian, both companies said.
   The casino operators, both of which run big resorts
catering to high-end gamblers, are evaluating the island as a
potential site to lure Japanese players. The eight Mariana
islands, the largest of which is Guam, are U.S. trust
territories. Gambling was legalized on Tinian more than a
year ago.

   Jack Leone, a Caesars spokesman, said the company has no
specific plans for such a venture but will seek preliminary
approval of Nevada state gaming regulators to operate a
casino there. If any project is pursued, he added, Caesars
would probably seek an operating agreement with an outside
developer rather than do the building itself.
   Alan Feldman, a Golden Nugget spokesman, said it is
"premature" to say the company is pursuing development there.
"We're very inquisitive, and we look at every place that has
legalized gaming," he said. Most of Golden Nugget's attention
will continue to be focused on Nevada, he added.
   Tinian, which is about 13 miles long and 6 miles wide, is
located about three miles south of Saipan. During World War
II, the island housed the airbase from which the Enola Gay
left for its atomic bombing mission on Hiroshima.
