   CAESARS WORLD Inc.'s subordinated debt ratings were raised
by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. to double-B-plus from
double-B-minus, reflecting the casino operator's improved
performance. The implied senior debt rating is
triple-B-minus, the ratings agency said. About $241 million
of debt is affected. "Caesars is well positioned as a leader
in the gaming industry despite generating the bulk of its
earnings from only two properties," S&amp;P said. Consolidated
debt leverage has moderated to 56% in the year ended July 31
from a peak of 72% in 1987. A further upgrade would depend on
significant additional leverage reduction, S&amp;P added.
