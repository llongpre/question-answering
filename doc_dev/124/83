   The Nevada Gaming Commission granted Hilton Hotels Corp.
and Caesars World the freedom to pursue gambling ventures in
other states and countries without the commission's prior
approval.
   Casino licensees normally must win the regulators'
permission before cementing any major venture, acquisition or
restructuring. The companies argued that the requirement
severely limited their ability to strike deals with
out-of-state entities.

   Hilton has won approval from New Jersey regulators to shop
for a casino there, and is scouting out potential sites for
riverboat gambling in Illinois and Louisiana. Hilton
executives told the Nevada commission that the company is
considering an expansion of its casino empire into Eastern
Europe, New Zealand and Egypt. The Beverly Hills,
Calif.-based hotel and casino company operates a casino in
Australia as part of a joint venture.
   Los Angeles-based Caesars had already secured approval to
scout out a casino site on the tiny Pacific island of Tinian.
Henry Gluck, chairman, told the regulators the company may
consider a number of other locations, including various
cities in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the
Bahamas and Uruguay.
   Operators such as Promus Cos. of Memphis, Tenn., have won
similar permission from the board, while Mirage Resorts Inc.
of Las Vegas has applied for the openended approval.
