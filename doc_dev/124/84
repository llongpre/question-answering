A new fringe theatre in London, The Bridewell, has opened at the St Bride
Institute at Bride Lane, Fleet Street. It deserves to be a roaring success.
The auditorium is built over a disused Victorian swimming pool - around the
walls is a raised wrought-iron gallery, and above, a glazed roof.
The pool was built in 1893, and was closed in 1972.
Last year, Carol Metcalf and her company, Breach of the Piece, staged Much
Ado About Nothing in the shallow end of the pool, and the idea of a theatre
emerged. After five months' work, Pounds 400,000 from the Institute and some
non-invasive design by Lloyd Leroy Architects, the theatre opened.
The pool itself is now the orchestra pit.
The theatre's owners and governors, the St Bride Institute, are planning
exhibitions and conferences in the space; the theatre's artistic director,
the tireless Metcalf, can offer the theatre for a single early-evening
after-work corporate show or a lunch-time revue (imagine how many people fit
into a 25-metre swimming pool).
The schedule includes Sondheim's Pacific Overtures later this year, but the
Bridewell has opened with Shakespeare.
Julius Caesar gave the world the 'most unkindest cut of them all'; this has
nothing to do with the Lorena Bobbitt case in Virginia, and everything to do
with getting Julius Caesar down to two hours on stage with a small cast.
The result is more a recital than a play.
The essentials of Julius Caesar remain, although the actors need to relax
much more and the action of the play needs to quicken.
The modern dress works well, particularly with video links to the battle
scenes and studio speeches from Brutus and Mark Antony.
The shortened version of the play offers itself as Brutus' tragedy, the
dilemma of a man torn between instinct and judgment: the part is well played
by Clive Paget.
Caesar stays alive long enough to show he is worth killing, Cassius lurks
hungrily throughout, and Casca (successfully cast as a woman) is blunt to a
fault.
Elsewhere, the play depends so much on ceremony (this is where 'standing on
ceremony' comes from) and crowd scenes which are all sweaty nightcaps and
foul breath, that a scaled-down version risks missing the scope and reach of
Caesar's ambition.
In action, this theatre has great potential for large scenes and intimate
moments. But in Caesar the actors occasionally traded lines like water-polo
players tossing a long pass across the pool.
The lighting could also be more focused to divide up the big stage, and the
music should be more martial.
Carol Metcalf directs.
But this is a sound start to what should be a fine new career for the
converted swimming pool.
No jokes about Brutus' line: 'Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar
I have not slept' - that would be too shallow a view of this deep play.
