   A former top Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
official said in court papers filed Friday that Michael Milken was
unaware of a 1983 agreement to advise a client central to a
government charge of insider trading.
   John Kissick, ex-head of Drexel's West Coast corporate finance
department, testified for Milken's defense in a bid to exonerate
the former junk-bond financier from insider trading in Caesars
World Inc. bonds.
   The government, in a pre-sentencing hearing that ended Thursday,
offered testimony implying Milken knew Drexel was advising Caesars
on a debt exchange when he ordered his traders to purchase bonds of
the casino company.
   Sentencing of Milken on his guilty plea to six trading-related
felony counts is not expected until after next week, a clerk for
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood said Friday.
   Milken attended a meeting with Caesars and Drexel executives on
June 29, 1983, at which the government claims Milken was a
``leading proponent'' of a debt-for-equity restructuring for
Caesars.
   Former Drexel trader James Dahl testified at the hearing that
Milken at some point ordered him and other traders to purchase
Caesars bonds from customers. But he couldn't when the directive
was given.
   Drexel on July 15 announced it was advising Caesars on a debt
restructuring, which sent the bonds soaring in value. The
government claims Milken ordered the purchases because he had
inside knowledge of Drexel's plans to manage the debt-for-equity
restructuring.
   Prosecutors also claim Milken purchased $2.65 million worth of
Caesars bonds on July 1 for a personal account and sold in late
July at a $553,000 profit.
   Kissick testified the June 29 meeting had no formal agenda and
several proposals for helping the company were discussed.
   ``I cannot recall who proposed what, but I have attended over
100 meetings like this with Michael Milken and it is not Mr.
Milken's style to stress any one option,'' he said.
   Kissick said no decision was made at the meeting about Caesars,
or even whether Drexel would be hired to advise the company.
   Kissick said that Caesars on July 1 told him it was interested
in exchanging debt for equity. He said he assigned an executive in
Drexel's San Francisco office to work with Caesars.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, Michael Milken had no involvement
with our relationship with Caesars'' between June 29 and July 15,
Kissick testified.
   Supporting testimony given Thursday, Kissick said Milken was out
of the country on vacation for much of the period.
   Milken faces up to 28 years in prison. The eight-day
pre-sentencing hearing was on alleged illegal trading beyong the
six counts he has admitted the government said shows Milken
deserves a lengthy prison term.
