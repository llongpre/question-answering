   Your June 23 Shop Talk story "Why Advisers Make the Big Bucks" gives credit to stockbrokers for their imagination in coming up with ingenious code names for takeover operations. 
An analyst is quoted as saying that 99 of 100 people on the street wouldn't know who Calpurnia was. 
He may be right with respect to the man in the street. 
But he should not discount the literary prowess of Journal readers. 
Without looking it up I can tell you that Calpurnia was the beautiful wife of Julius Caesar. 
As you might know, Caesar can do no wrong and Caesar's wife was above suspicion. 
I personally think that the code name "Project Calpurnia" for the recapitalization of Caesars World Inc. is cuter than the "Project Chariot" for the takeover plan.
