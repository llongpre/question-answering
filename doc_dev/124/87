   Pratt Hotel Corp. agreed to buy the unfinished Penthouse Boardwalk hotel and casino in Atlantic City, N.J., from Penthouse International Ltd. for about $61 million. 

   The company said it estimates the cost of completing the 500-room hotel and 50,000-square-foot casino at about $200 million. 
Only the hotel's foundation and a steel frame has been completed at the site, which stands between Trump Plaza and Caesars hotel and casino in the middle of the city's boardwalk. 
Pratt said that it expects to finish construction at the complex in late 1989. 

   Penthouse, which also owns Penthouse magazine, halted construction in 1981 after Robert Guccione, Penthouse chairman, was unable to obtain financing to complete the building. 

   Mr. Guccione sued the U.S. government, alleging that its Abscam corruption investigation had unfairly damaged his reputation and prevented him from getting financing for the casino. 
Last month, a federal judge rejected the suit on technical grounds. 

   Jack E. Pratt Sr., chairman of Pratt, said the company had considered other ways to expand in Atlantic City, including construction of a hotel. 
That was ruled out, however, when Pratt estimated it would cost more than $350 million and would take an extra year to complete. 

   Mr. Pratt estimated the complex will generate $250 million in annual revenue and employ about 3,000 people. 
Pratt's only other Atlantic City holding is the Sands hotel, casino and country club. 
The hotel chain made an unsuccessful bid for control of Resorts International Inc. and its four casinos in the city, but they were bought by New York developer Donald Trump. 

   Pratt then discussed plans to join with investor Martin T. Sosnoff to buy Caesars World Inc., the Los Angeles-based casino operator. 
Pratt and Dallas-based Southmark Corp., which own 36% of Pratt, halted the discussions in a disagreement with Mr. Sosnoff. 

   The agreement with Penthouse is subject to state and local regulatory clearance of the construction plans, as well as to approval by New Jersey's gambling commission.
