    February winnings at the 11
Atlantic City casinos rose 18.2% to $185.5 million from
$156.9 million a year earlier, making the latest period the
biggest revenue-producing winter month in the nine-year
history of casino gambling here.
   However, Marvin B. Roffman, an analyst who follows the gambling industry for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc., Philadelphia, called the February figures "a statistical aberration." 
He said the overall growth rate of casino winnings is slowing down. 
As previously reported, January winnings rose 4.8% from the year-earlier month. 

   Winnings are a casino's revenue before accounting for operating costs, taxes and other expenses. 

   In February, Caesars World Inc. had the largest winnings, $26.8 million. 
Trump's Castle, owned by Donald Trump, a New York real estate developer, posted the biggest percentage gain, 39%, to $20.3 million from $14.6 million a year earlier. 
Trump's Castle had the second-highest winnings for the month. 

   Elsinore Corp.'s Atlantis, operating under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, reported a 19.5% drop in winnings, the only decline in the group. 
Atlantis's winnings totaled $6.5 million. 
Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors while it works out a plan to pay debt.
