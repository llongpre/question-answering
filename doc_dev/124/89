   Caesars World Inc. said it will redeem $80 million of its $100 million outstanding of 14 1/4% subordinated debentures due 1996 at par plus accrued interest June 29. 

   The redemption is being made in connection with the gaming company's nearly $1 billion recapitalization plan designed to fend off a hostile tender offer from New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff. 

   The company said it plans to redeem the remaining $20 million of debentures, to the extent allowed by terms of the debt, before or soon after its recapitalization. 
Holders are to vote on the recapitalization June 12.
