   Caesars World Inc. dropped its $960 million recapitalization plan, which New Jersey gambling regulators refused to approve, and instead launched a tender offer to buy back 31% of its shares at a cost of $325 million to $374 million. 

   The operator of casino hotels began today a so-called Dutch auction tender offer for 11 million of its shares. 
Caesars said shares must be tendered at prices between $29.50 and $34 each. 
Under the Dutch auction procedures, Caesars will accept shares in the order of their specified prices, beginning with the lowest price, until the total reaches 11 million. 
The highest price required to reach the 11 million total will then be paid to all shares accepted. 

   Caesars shares closed Friday at $29.25, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
The offer will expire at 12:01 a.m. EDT Oct. 6 unless extended, Caesars said. 

   Caesars said it has been advised by its lawyers that the tender offer doesn't require approval by New Jersey or Nevada gaming regulators. 
However, the company, which has casinos in both states, said if the regulators rule that their approval is required, Caesars reserves the right to cancel the offer. 

   Caesars also said the offer is conditioned on arranging the necessary financing of as much as $400 million, including expenses of the offer. 
Caesars said the offer would be financed with issuance of subordinated debt and bank borrowings. 
The company said its investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., has advised that it is "highly confident" that the necessary debt securities can be sold. 

   Henry Gluck, Caesars World's chairman and chief executive officer, said, "We believe that the purchase of shares through the offer constitutes an attractive investment for our company at this time because of recent market prices for Caesars World's shares, the company's reduced level of long-term debt and our business and financial prospects." 

   Mr. Gluck said the offer "should help to normalize the Caesars World shareholder base," which he said the company believes includes "a high percentage of short-term investors who purchased or held Caesars World stock in anticipation of receiving a dividend under the recapitalization plan." 

   The recapitalization plan, which was rejected Aug. 12 by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, would have paid a one-time cash dividend of $26.25 to shareholders. 

   Caesars said yesterday it will withdraw its request that the New Jersey commission reconsider its rejection of the recapitalization plan. 
A hearing on the request was scheduled for tomorrow. 

   In rejecting the plan, the New Jersey commission said it "lacks any clear business" purpose and serves to "greatly enrich and permanently entrench" current management. 

   Caesars devised the recapitalization plan to fight off an unwanted takeover bid from New York investor Martin T. Sosnoff, who currently holds about 11%, or 4.2 million shares, of Caesars World. 

   A representative for Mr. Sosnoff said yesterday that Mr. Sosnoff hadn't seen the offering papers and will withhold comment until he does. 

   In explaining its decision to abandon the recapitalization plan, in which the company would have issued $960 million of new debt to pay the dividend, Caesars said it was advised by its lawyers that regulatory approval of the plan was unlikely. 
Caesars also cited "volatility of the financial markets and the effects of delay and uncertainty." 

   Caesars said neither the company nor its directors were expressing an opinion on whether shareholders should tender their shares under the company's offer. 

   Mr. Gluck, however, said in a statement that the offer "provides all shareholders with a means of liquidating a portion and possibly all of their Caesars World shares without the market disruption that might otherwise occur if they were sold in the open market." 

   A Caesars spokesman said all trades of post-dividend Caesars shares, which were made on a when-issued basis, will be canceled because the dividend won't be paid.
