   A federal jury believed a hot burst from a
Caesars Palace steam bath kept Rodney Dangerfield from performing
at the casino-hotel and awarded the comic $725,000.
   ``The truth won out,'' Dangerfield said. ``I wouldn't have gone
through this unless I was right.''
   Dangerfield's bitter legal battle with the Las Vegas resort
culminated Thursday when jurors said Caesars was responsible for a
March 1988 steam bath accident that left him unable to perform
because of eye injuries.
   ``We're very disappointed,'' said Bruce Aguilera, a lawyer for
Caesars Palace. ``We'll have to have our lawyers look at the
case.''
   Jurors awarded Dangerfield $500,000 for pain and suffering and
$225,000 for shows he missed after the March 1988 accident.
Dangerfield sued Caesars for $5 million in damages and $225,000 for
missed performances.
   The bug-eyed comic, who has made a career out of the premise
that he receives no respect, thanked jurors outside a court
elevator.
   ``We showed Rodney some respect,'' an unidentified juror said.
   The jury said Caesars was obligated under a contract to pay
Dangerfield for the missed shows because the injury should have
excused him from performing. Jurors also rejected Caesars' $100,000
countersuit against its former headliner.
   Dangerfield, 68, criticized Caesars for filing papers in court
before the trial accusing him of drug use. He called the
accusations ``nonsense and untrue.''
   ``I'm surprised they went to that level to degrade me falsely
like they did,'' he said. ``All they did in this entire trial was
to try to degrade my character.
   ``I wasn't concerned with the amount of money,'' he said.
``Money is money. I was concerned about the truth.''
   Dangerfield said Henry Gluck, chairman of the resort's parent
Caesars World Inc., had refused to settle for $225,000.
   Dangerfield missed five shows the week of the accident, claiming
Caesars was negligent in installing and maintaining a steam bath he
used immediately after his performances.
   The hotel, in its countersuit, claimed Dangerfield breached his
contract by not performing shows as scheduled and contended during
the 2{-week-long trial that the comedian showed no signs of
permanent injury from the accident.
   Dangerfield testified he was hit in the eyes by a burst of steam
as he opened the door to the steam room.
   Caesars introduced evidence that Dangerfield went out two nights
he was supposed to perform. A doctor who examined Dangerfield after
the steam bath incident said he thought Dangerfield could perform.
   But an ophthalmologist hired by Dangerfield's attorneys said he
examined Dangerfield three times in the last year and concluded he
continues to suffer pain caused by the steam injury.
