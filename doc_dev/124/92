   It's hard to imagine a more miscast version of
``Julius Caesar'' than the all-star revival currently ambushing
audiences at the New York Shakespeare Festival Public Theater.
   Not since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton curdled Noel
Coward's ``Private Lives'' several seasons back has so much star
power been used to so little effect. In this case, the big guns
parading around in white and burgundy togas are Al Pacino, Martin
Sheen, Edward Herrmann and John McMartin.
   Each operates independently on stage, never connecting with the
other performers or the play. A variety of acting styles are adrift
in this endless, exhausting production that seems much longer than
its two hours and 30 minutes.
   This is a ``Julius Caesar'' that doesn't connect on any level _
not as political drama, personal tragedy or even historical
pageantry. Coming right after the Public's spirited and sensual
``Midsummer Night's Dream,'' it is a major disappointment.
   ``Julius Caesar'' is a transition play, bridging the historical
plays and the later great tragedies. The drama requires actors
comfortable in both settings. There are none in this production,
and director Stuart Vaughan is at a loss to impose any sort of
style or unity to the diverse proceedings.
   Pacino, as Mark Antony, gives the evening's most bewildering and
idiosyncratic performance. The actor has a magnetic physical
presence, and it's impossible not to watch him when he is on stage.
His Antony moves like a feral, street-wise gang leader who belongs
more in the Bronx than in ancient Rome. So does his accent.
   To compensate for his blue-collar patois, Pacino speaks in a
slow, deliberate cadence. He spits out each word carefully as if he
were afraid of mispronunciation. What's left is language devoid of
any feeling or emotion.
   Sheen, in the pivotal role of Brutus, has much the same problem
with the play's poetry. He gives an unshaded, monotone performance.
Sheen's Brutus also lacks the patrician bearing that should be the
hallmark of this play's most interesting character. He's a cipher
and that blandness dilutes the tragedy.
   As a result, interest shifts to another of the conspirators,
Cassius, played by the usually reliable Herrmann. A tall,
vulture-like villain, the actor starts out strongly, insinuating
his way into the good graces of Brutus. His explanation of why
Caesar should be killed is chillingly logical and effective. But
once the deed is accomplished, Herrmann falters. His performance
turns petulant, and Cassius becomes a scolding old maid furious
that things have turned out wrong.
   McMartin's Caesar is also problematic. Although he captures the
man's vanity, there's little here to suggest a charismatic leader.
He's laconic rather than a commanding figure whose popularity
threatens the empire.
   The supporting cast is equally unmemorable and all over the
forum in acting ability and accents, although Jerry Mayer has a
nice moment or two as a comic cobbler.
   Vaughan's direction collapses in the second act. Awkward
battlefield tableaux alternate with more intimate scenes that show
the unraveling of the assassins' lives. It's a toss-up as to which
scenes are more chaotic or unmoving. The deaths of Brutus and
Cassius seem to come more as a relief than as the inexorable result
of fate. The tragedy is nowhere to be found.
   The setting, designed by Bob Shaw, doesn't help the drama. The
playing area is all exposed brick _ as are the inevitable columns _
making the stage look like a Soho loft undergoing renovation.
   ``Julius Caesar'' is the second production in the Public
Theater's ambitious marathon to present all of Shakespeare's 36
plays over a six-year period. Next up is ``Romeo and Juliet,''
starring Peter MacNicol and Cynthia Nixon as the star-crossed
lovers. It begins performances April 19. Maybe it can get the
Public's Shakespeare celebration back on track.
