   April winnings at the 12 casinos here rose 5.6% to $199.3 million from $188.8 million a year earlier, the casino industry reported. 

   Winnings are a casino's revenue before accounting for operating costs, taxes and other expenses. 

   The year-earlier figures don't include Showboat Inc.'s Showboat Hotel, Casino &amp; Bowling Center, which opened March 30. 
Without Showboat's winnings, the group's total rose 4.7%. 
Showboat reported winnings of $19.6 million, the second-highest among the group. 

   Caesars Atlantic City, owned by Caesars World Inc., had the highest winnings for the month, $22 million, and the highest year-to-year increase, 17%, from $18.9 million in April 1986. 

   Elsinore Corp.'s Atlantis reported the biggest percentage decline, as its winnings of $6.5 million fell 29% from $9.2 million a year-earlier. 
Trump Plaza, one of two Atlantic City casino properties owned by New York developer Donald Trump, posted a 10% decline to $16.3 million from $18.1 million.
