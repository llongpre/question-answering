The English Shakespeare Company is in the midst of what may be its last tour
in its present form. Since it was founded under Michael Bogdanov in 1986, it
has provided a mixture of the inspired, the perverse and the indifferent.
Its Julius Caesar, currently playing at the Shaw Theatre in London, contains
the same mixture, though perhaps with less emphasis on the inspired.
The women are outstanding: Mandana Jones as Calpurnia, wife of Caesar, and
Caroline Harris as Portia, wife of Brutus. They almost succeed in showing
that if they had been in charge, the tragedy would never have happened. In
the scene where Portia speaks of giving herself a voluntary wound in the
thigh to show her constancy, Ms Harris savagely stabs herself in the upper
leg.
There is also new meaning in Caesar's line: 'Let me have men about me that
are fat.' This Caesar, played by David Sterne, is a paunchy figure,
certainly not obese, but well-made. Dressed in a camel coat, no tie and a
long white evening scarf, he looks a jolly enough fellow, perhaps presiding
over a rugby club rather imperial Rome.
Terry McGinity's Cassius is very impressive, a genuinely worried man,
possibly rightly convinced that Caesar must go. And it is here, as in
several other recent productions of the play, that one notices a change in
sympathies. Tradition had it that Brutus was the noblest Roman of them all.
Cassius was a conspirator with not much to be said for him. Mark Antony was
a chancer who emerged as the hero.
Modern taste has begun to lean more towards Cassius as the most interesting
figure. Certainly in this ESC production, directed by Tim Carroll, Brutus is
a very dull man by contrast. Played by Burt Caesar, he seems neither the
brightest or the noblest.
Alex Hardy's Antony is more of a pop star. When he incites the crowd at
Caesar's funeral, he employs deliberate hysteria from the start. There is no
gradual build-up. And when he makes his final comment on Caesar at the end
of the play, it is almost flip. He tosses off the lines about nature
standing up to all the world and saying 'This was a man' as if they had only
just occurred to him and will be as quickly forgotten.
The production is done effortlessly in modern dress. More puzzling is why
the set, designed by Rae Smith, seems to be vaguely South African. It adds
nothing to the play, but nor does it particularly detract.
The ESC is sponsored by IBM. Next week at the same theatre Bogdanov will
present his version of the Faust legend, designed especially for children.
