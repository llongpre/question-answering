FT  20 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: ITT/Caesars World
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ITT believes casino gambling is potentially more lucrative than financial
services. That much became evident from yesterday's Dollars 1.7bn purchase
of Caesars World, coupled with its proclaimed determination to sell its loan
and mortgage businesses during the coming few weeks. The rationale is not
complicated. The immediate prospects for gaming are better than for ITT's
loans operations; the North American gaming market is currently enjoying
double-digit growth and enviable margins.
The strategy ITT chose to deepen its exposure to gambling through
acquisition must be right. By buying Caesars, ITT gains an internationally
recognised brand-name, acquires first-class management in an area where the
group admits weakness and creates the possibility of synergies between the
casinos and ITT's Sheraton hotels. By deciding to abandon its plans to
construct a new Las Vegas casino, ITT also avoids increasing competition in
an already tight market.
That said, the north American gaming market is evolving rapidly; present
growth looks unsustainable as new capacity is being added at a rapid rate on
river boats and in Indian reservations. ITT's turn at the gaming table will
not be without its risks.
