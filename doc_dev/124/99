SUGAR CANE by Paul Bailey Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 228 pages
CAESAR by Allan Massie Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 14.99, 228 pages
AMONG THE DEAD by Michael Tolkin Faber Pounds 14.99, 229 pages
PAUL BAILEY reaches for big themes of loneliness, fragility and disguise in
his seventh novel, but in spite of his clear, pared-down writing, the result
is a disappointment. Sugar Cane's central figure Stephen, a mixed-race
runaway from Halifax, teases the story along by posing riddles about his
life. The narrator, Esther Potocki, a doctor of venereal disease, rightly
guesses that he is a prostitute. But it is left to her lover Gabriel to
deduce that Stephen's mysterious 'Bish' is the notorious, self-styled
'Bishop of Wandle', jailed years before the book opens for running a ring of
rent boys from a Wandsworth warehouse.
Bailey is good on dialogue - particularly that of Esther's edgy patients -
and on interweaving Esther's memories of her parents with Stephen's
revelations. But although one of his themes is the claustrophobic ties
between children and parents, he gives improbable accounts of how his
characters try to break them. We are to believe that Esther chose
venereology to rebel against her mother's wish that she become a ballerina;
and that Gabriel can get an erection only by putting on his mother's
polka-dot dress and then shedding her memory as he takes it off. The result
of this constricted psychology is to turn the characters into grotesques.
But the greater weakness of the book is that the prolonged suspense is not
warranted by the eventual revelations. Gabriel explains to Esther that
Stephen 'needs to bewilder you. He has to make himself as opaque as he
possibly can, in order to keep you interested in him. He's scared of your
finding him ordinary'. The book takes the same risk, and fails.
Stephen's account of how he was lured into the Bishop's 'palace' is hardly
the 'descent into hell' that Esther claims. He expresses no despair and
little revulsion - or excitement - even at the regular duty of masturbating
the 'Bishop'. Soon after introduction to the punters of Piccadilly Circus,
he concludes 'the funny thing is that after a time the hundreds would all
merge into one'. And his tale - which makes up the second half of the book -
is delivered as a tape recording to Esther and Gabriel because 'I could
never tell you this to your face'. Bailey thus spares himself an exploration
of their disgust or pity, and, because the Bishop is already jailed, of
their responsibility to act.
The ducking of a confrontation between Stephen and Esther leads to a moral
blankness at the heart of the novel, nor does Bailey manage to show why the
reader should share his fascination with Stephen's descent.
The narrator of Allan Massie's Caesar has more substance. This version of
the plot to kill Julius Caesar is told through the eyes of Decimus Brutus,
the protege whom Caesar most trusted and who became one of his assassins.
Given the difficulty of bringing historical figures to life, it is
unexpectedly rich and detailed, particularly on Caesar's manipulation of
loyalty. It carries echoes of Margaret Thatcher's blindness to opposition
and of her eventual fall: 'I have heard Caesar deny the very existence of
society', says the narrator.
But the pace often slows to that of a politician's memoirs, and some
sentences take schoolroom concentration to comprehend: 'So nothing was done
on his (Ptolemy's) behalf, until, as a result of the famous meeting between
Pompey, Caesar and the millionaire booby Marcus Crassus at Lucca, the three
of them formed what Cicero (in private) described as a 'criminal conspiracy
to share sovereignty and dominate the Republic'.' Readers who dare skim over
those passages will be left scrabbling for the six-page chronology and list
of characters at the front.
In contrast, Michael Tolkin's highly amusing second novel is an effortless
read. Like his first, The Player, it will no doubt translate easily into a
satirical film of West Coast life. Frank Gale, a 'loser' by Los Angeles
standards, has been unfaithful to his wife. But he is convinced that with
the right words, and a trip to Mexico, he can repair his marriage. His self
delusion is laid bare in the opening pages as he designs what he believes
will be a more honest life.
When the aeroplane he has missed crashes, however, killing his wife and
child, the inexorable exposure of his fantasies becomes a nightmare. In the
end, the only one who has the right words is the author, who manipulates the
characters' fates with the comic deftness - and cruelty - that he showed in
his first book. Satisfyingly, with immense speed, retribution arrives.
