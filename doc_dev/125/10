   The widow of investor-publisher John Hay Whitney
will offer a Renoir from the couple's collection for sale for an
estimated $40 million to $50 million, Sotheby's auction house said
Tuesday.
   Pierre-Auguste Renoir's 1876 artwork, acclaimed for its light,
shadow and movement, depicts the Moulin de la Galette, a French
outdoor dance hall in Montmartre frequented by avant-garde writers,
painters and actors.
   It shows a model named Estelle siting at a table with three of
Renoir's friends, including biographer Georges Rivere, who later
described the painting as ``a page of history, a precious moment of
Paris life depicted with rigorous examination.''
   The painting was owned for 60 years by Whitney and his wife,
Betsey Cushing Whitney.
   Whitney, who died in 1982, founded J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a
venture-capitalist firm, and was an ambassador to Great Britain and
publisher of The New York Herald Tribune.
   He became a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art in 1930, was
named president in 1941 and was chairman from 1946 to 1956. He was
a trustee of the National Gallery of Art in Washington from 1961 to
1979.
   A larger version of ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' is in the Musee
d'Orsay in Paris. It is believed one was painted at the scene and
the other at Renoir's studio _ but no one knows which is which.
   Sotheby's will take the Whitney version to Paris for a
comparison in February. Then, after exhibits in Tokyo, Zurich,
Paris and London, the Renoir will return to New York for an auction
on May 16.
   After Whitney's death, his wife gave five institutions 20 works
by Edgar Degas, Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, Henri Rousseau,
Georges Seurat, James Abbott McNeill Whistler and other artists.
   Several other Whitneys also are well-known in the art world.
   Whitney's niece, Linda de Roulet, sold Pablo Picasso's ``Au
Lapin Agile,'' a Paris tavern scene, on Nov. 17 for $40.7 million.
   Mrs. de Roulet's brother, John Whitney Payson, sold Vincent van
Gogh's ``Irises'' in 1987 for $53.9 million, the highest price ever
obtained at an art auction.
   Payson got his money, but other parts of the deal went sour. It
turned out Sotheby's had lent Australian tycoon Alan Bond $27
million to help buy ``Irises,'' using the painting itself as
collateral. Bond didn't pay off the loan; the van Gogh is now in a
vault, its ownership cloudy. Last week, Sotheby's announced it was
abandoning its loan policy _ which triggered the quandary and
which, critics charged, inflated art prices in general.
   Both the van Gogh and the Picasso came from the collection of
former New York Mets owner Joan Whitney Payson, Whitney's sister
and the mother of Mrs. de Roulet and John Whitney Payson.
