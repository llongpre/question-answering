What on earth are we to make of the glitzy sales of Impressionist and Modern
works of art in New York this week? Both Christie's and Sotheby's had
assembled their finest auctions for four years, bursting with paintings by
Gauguin, Monet, Picasso, Leger, Mondrian, and there was a quiet confidence
that enthusiastic bidding from art-starved millionaires would announce to
the world the end of the recession.
It did not quite work out like that. There was an audience, around 1,500 of
New York's finest, at each evening sale, but while Sotheby's could crack
open the champagne after its experience on Wednesday, Christie's on Tuesday
was left groping for excuses.
'Pre-sale interest suddenly ebbed on Monday afternoon' says its expert
Michael Findlay. 'There were no new buyers; no real strength in the market'.
In contrast Alexander Apsis of Sotheby's found that 'lots of different
people were bidding, and many of them we had never seen before'.
While half of Christie's 76 lots were unsold, Sotheby's disposed of 50 of
its 69. In terms of totals and the value of the lots sold, the gap was not
so great: Sotheby's brought in Dollars 51.5m (Pounds 34.6m) and was 66 per
cent sold while Christie's managed Dollars 50.7m (Pounds 34m) and 59 per
cent.
As Apsis says 'there is a very fine line between what sells and what
doesn't' He should know. Although Sotheby's secured the highest price paid
at auction for two years when two keen bidders chased each other up to a
record Dollars 11.6m for 'Lady with a fan', a ravishingly decorative
painting by Gustav Klimt (which cost less than Dollars 2m in 1987),
Sotheby's sale just missed being exceptional. Two key works, a painting of
Venice by Monet and a sculpture by Brancusi, failed to sell, even though
bids for each nudged Dollars 6m.
Buyers still have the whip hand, and the museum interested in the Brancusi
and the private collectors salivating over the Monet know that the sellers
will be open to post-auction offers. Michael Findlay of Christie's was also
busy dealing with after-sale enquires.
Sotheby's reckons it was fielding the better paintings. This is debatable.
Perhaps the key factor was that its auction took place 24 hours after that
at Christie's, time to persuade vendors to accept more flexible reserves. In
any case its estimates had seemed more cautious. A Sisley landscape carried
a modest Dollars 300,000-Dollars 400,000, and sold for Dollars 365,500,
while two out of three routine works by Renoir went in the Dollars
450,000-Dollars 600,000 price range.
Christie's in contrast fielded some impressive single owner collections,
including seven top works by Gauguin, Picasso, Vlaminck, Braque, etc, owned
by the Zurich industrialist Jacques Koerfer, plus a group sold by the
financially troubled retail magnate Mershulam Riklis, but after a good
start, with the Koerfer Vlaminck making Dollars 6.8m and his Picasso Dollars
6.27m, the sale fell away to nothing.
Freshness was a factor. The Koerfer paintings did well because they had been
hidden away for over 30 years, while some of the Riklis paintings had been
offered around privately in recent months. There also seems to be price
resistance over the Dollars 3m level and Christie's had more expensive
pictures to dispose of.
This suggests that it will be a long haul to return to the halcyon days of
1989-90. Just four years ago, in a similar week of New York auctions,
Christie's sold Van Gogh's portrait of Dr Gachet for a record Dollars 82.5m
and Sotheby's raised Dollars 286m from a single auction.
This was because the salerooms had persuaded rich businessmen, in particular
the Japanese, that major Impressionist and Modern artists were a good
investment, and provided loans and easy terms for buyers. It was a primrose
path to disaster, and there are many Monets, Renoirs, Van Goghs and Picassos
currently in Tokyo (and Swiss) bank vaults with valuations worryingly below
their acquisition price. One of the more interesting paintings on offer this
week was 'Contraste de formes' by Leger, one of a series of 12 in which he
experimented with 'pure painting'. In 1989 one sold for Dollars 14.7m: the
best bid this week for another was Dollars 2.4m.
No new speculative buyers are coming forward, and while the American economy
has improved there were few European or Asian bidders this week. There are
probably less than 20 collectors in the world prepared to pay Dollars 3m or
more for a painting, and they are being very selective.
