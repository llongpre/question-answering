   A masterpiece from Pablo Picasso's ``blue period''
long thought to have disappeared is expected to become the world's
most expensive painting when sold at auction on Nov. 30, an
auctioneer said Thursday.
   ``Les Noces de Pierrette'' (``Pierrette's Wedding''), executed
in 1904-05 in Montmartre, is expected to bring $46 million to $61
million, said auctioneer Jean-Claude Binoche.
   ``It's going to shatter the world record not only for Picassos,
but for all paintings,'' Binoche said.
   The record paid at an auction for a Picasso was $48.7 million
for a 1901 self-portrait titled ``Yo Picasso,'' sold on May 9.
Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises'' became the most expensive painting in
the world when it sold two years ago for $53.9 million.
   Binoche said he was hopeful Culture Minister Jack Lang would
allow ``Les Noces'' to leave France. The painting is considered
part of France's national heritage and must receive an official
authorization to leave the country.
   With its hauntingly beautiful pink and blue tones, the work
straddles Picasso's best-loved early periods. Six figures _ their
pale pink faces illuminated by an eerie light _ sit around a table
with the newlyweds. The bride wears a Spanish-style mantilla. Her
husband sports a top hat.
   Though experts are familiar with dozens of sketches Picasso drew
for ``Les Noces,'' the final work dropped from sight years ago.
Many thought it was lost in a fire.
   It surfaced in 1988 as part of a Picasso show in Stockholm.
Binoche said the work was long the property of a Swedish family
that does not want to be identified.
   ``The family considered the painting to be a private treasure,
and now it's for sale, that's all,'' he said.
   The sale has been hailed as the major event of the auction
season.
   Sotheby's in New York has said the family of Joan Whitney
Payson, the sellers of van Gogh's ``Irises,'' hope to fetch a
similar price on Nov. 15 for an early Picasso self-portrait titled
``Au Lapin Agile,'' named after a tavern frequented by the artist.
