Christie's and Sotheby's are gearing up for the height of New York's fall 
auction season. They have laid in plentiful supplies of multimillion-dollar 
paintings, mailed catalogues far and wide, sent star artworks on the road and 
lined up prospective buyers. Now comes the public part: a round of auctions, on 
Tuesday through Nov. 15, that is expected to ring up more than $500 million in 
sales of contemporary, modern and Impressionist art. 
</P>
<P>
Art isn't the only thing for sale, however. Prestigious provenance is also on 
the block, as we see from the star-studded list of sellers. Collectors who are 
concerned about who has owned the art they buy should feel secure this season. 
Even those who want or need no validation of their own judgment are likely to 
be impressed by the consignors: 
</P>
<P>
* Lorinda de Roulet, sister of John Whitney Payson -- who sold Vincent van 
Gogh's "Irises" for $53.9 million two years ago -- will sell Pablo Picasso's 
"Au Lapin Agile" at Sotheby's on Nov. 15. De Roulet and Payson inherited the 
paintings from their mother, Joan Whitney Payson, a noted collector, 
philanthropist and owner of the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
Rumors abound that "Au Lapin Agile" may replace "Irises" as the world's most 
expensive painting. Failing that, the Rose Period cabaret scene featuring 
Picasso as a harlequin may still break the artist's record of $47.85 million 
set in May for "Yo Picasso." Sotheby's has announced no firm estimate for "Au 
Lapin Agile," but a press release states that the firm anticipates "the same 
level of interest among collectors" as "Yo Picasso." 
</P>
<P>
* Paul Mellon, a major benefactor of the National Gallery of Art and son of 
museum founder Andrew W. Mellon, is pruning his personal collection to the tune 
of $100 million. Christie's New York on Nov. 14 will offer about $85 million to 
$90 million worth of that cache -- in the form of 15 Impressionist and modern 
works. 
</P>
<P>
Prime among them are Edouard Manet's painting "Rue Mosnier, Paris, Decorated 
With Flags on June 30, 1878," valued at more than $30 million, and "The Tree, 
Arles," a vivid 1888 landscape by Van Gogh, expected to bring at least $25 
million. Picasso's "Death of a Harlequin," a Rose Period painting that Mellon 
bought from W. Somerset Maugham's collection, is expected to sell for more than 
$20 million. Three of Edgar Degas' wax sculptures of ballet dancers, valued at 
$1.5 million to $2 million apiece, are also in the Mellon sale. 
</P>
<P>
* Billy Wilder, a legendary film maker and highly regarded art collector, will 
sell 94 modern and contemporary works at Christie's on Nov. 13. Expected to 
total as much as $30 million, the Wilder collection is among the liveliest 
collections to come up for sale in many years. Exercising a purely personal 
taste that favors literary complexities and emotional punch, Wilder purchased 
exquisitely raunchy nudes by Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele, poetic boxes 
and collages by Joseph Cornell and delightful whimsies by Joan Miro. In the 
Wilder roster of works by 47 artists, Picasso's classical 1921 pastel drawing, 
"Tete de Femme," is expected to bring the sale's top price of $5 million to $7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
* The late Edgar Kaufmann Jr., a Frank Lloyd Wright scholar and heir to a 
Pittsburgh department store fortune, is known for persuading his father to 
commission Wright's masterpiece, a house called "Fallingwater," but he was also 
a distinguished collector of art. Sotheby's Nov. 15 sale of 21 Impressionist 
and modern works from his collection is expected to total up to $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
There's a Monet waterlily painting, valued at $7 million to $9 million, an 
early Mondrian, called "Facade in Tan and Grey" ($6 million to $8 million) and 
a sprightly Miro, "l'Oiseau au Plumage Deploye Vole Vers l'Arbre Argente "($4 
million to $5 million). Another painting from the Kaufmann collection, Willem 
de Kooning's 1955 "Interchange" ($4 million to $6 million) is among top 
offerings in Sotheby's contemporary sale on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
* The late Robert B. Mayer, a Chicago clothing retailer, founding member of the 
Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art and supporter of the Art Institute of 
Chicago, amassed one of the finest private art collections in the country. 
Twenty contemporary pieces from the Mayer collection, for sale at Christie's on 
Tuesday, include Roy Lichtenstein's comic-strip style "Torpedo . . . Los!," 
expected to bring $3 million to $4 million, and Jasper Johns' small gray 
painting of numbers, "O Through 9," valued at $2.5 million to $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
How does such distinguished ownership figure into the auction houses' 
estimates? Not at all, officials from Christie's and Sotheby's insist. If only 
to protect themselves from being overly optimistic in an overheated market, 
they establish estimates that they say reflect market value, based on sales of 
similar works. 
</P>
<P>
But the two houses compete vigorously for big-name collections and promote them 
to the hilt. The selling of collections includes selling the collectors as 
people of prescience and taste. 
</P>
<P>
Prestigious "single-owner" sales -- auctions that include a number of works 
from a single collection -- are fancy dress occasions with admission by ticket 
and reserved seats for favored clients. 
</P>
<P>
These sales have color-illustrated catalogues, often containing essays about 
the collectors, historical notes and photographs of how the artworks were 
installed in the collectors' homes. Really big sales get hard-cover catalogues. 
Really, really big sales of single paintings -- such as "Irises" and "Au Lapin 
Agile" -- get their own hard-cover books. 
</P>
<P>
Artworks in "single-owner" sales are also sent on carefully plotted 
international tours that include private openings and public viewings. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the strategy works. Highly publicized "single-owner" sales often 
surpass, even double, their estimates. That success -- coupled with the fear 
that the bubble will burst -- persuades more collectors to sell. 
</P>
<P>
With art pouring out of closets, new collectors emerging in ever larger numbers 
and European buying reportedly on the rise, this year promises to bring more of 
the same. 
</P>
<P>
The strongest note of skepticism about the perpetually escalating art market 
has been voiced over what some observers call artificial prices, pumped up by 
Sotheby's practice of loaning money to their clients for the purchase of art 
from Sotheby's sales. 
</P>
<P>
The most famous case is that of Australian businessman Alan Bond who reportedly 
borrowed about $27 million from Sotheby's to buy "Irises" in 1987 and 
subsequently suffered financial setbacks. Although he has made regular payments 
-- after renegotiating the loan -- the painting is safely locked in a Sotheby's 
vault, according to the auction house. To help pay off his loan, Bond has 
consigned "La Promenade," an Impressionist painting by Edouard Manet valued at 
$10 million to $14 million, to Sotheby's Nov. 15 sale -- the same auction that 
features "Au Lapin Agile."
