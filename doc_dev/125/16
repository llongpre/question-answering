Photo, Pricey Picasso -- This self-portrait painted by Pablo Picasso may set a 
record for 20th Century art Wednesday in an auction at Sotheby's. The painting, 
"Au Lapin Agile," depicts a melancholy Picasso dressed as a harlequin at a cafe 
in 1905. The sale may break the $53.9 million paid for Vincent van Gogh's 
"Irises," the world's most expensive artwork. (See story A4.) United Press
