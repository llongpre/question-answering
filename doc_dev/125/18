   Pablo Picasso would have gotten a kick out of
seeing his self-portrait sell for $47.85 million to become the
second most expensive art work ever auctioned, his daughter said.
   ``Yo Picasso,'' painted 88 years ago when the artist was 20, was
last sold in 1981 for $5.5 million.
   Its price Tuesday night at Sotheby's was more than twice its
pre-sale estimate and was second only to Vincent Van Gogh's
``Irises,'' which sold for $53.9 million in 1987.
   The Picasso was one of 67 Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and
Modern works that sold for a record total of $204.82 million. The
previous mark for one auction was $117 million at Sotheby's in
London in April.
   The previous record sale for Picasso, who died in 1973, was
$38.45 million paid last year for ``Acrobate et Jeune Arlequin.''
   Paloma Picasso, who attended Tuesday's sale, said she thought
her father ``would get a kick out of it'' if he knew how much his
self-portrait had brought.
   ``It's in another stratosphere, but it's because there's a lot
of cash around,'' she said. ``It's better that these people use
their money for these paintings rather than planes and bombs.''
   Two bidders made their offers by telephone, upping one another
in increments of a million dollars once the price war got past $30
million. The standing-room-only audience oohed as each offer was
announced and applauded the winning figure.
   Neither bidder was identified. The loser also was the
underbidder when the painting was last sold.
   ``Yo Picasso'' was sold by Wendell Cherry of Louisville, Ky.,
who heads Humana Inc., the hospital management corporation.
   Records were set Tuesday for 11 artists besides Picasso.
   Paul Gauguin's ``Mata Mua (In Olden Times),'' a colorful
Tahitian landscape, sold for $24.2 million. That broke a record set
last month when Gauguin's ``The Fare Hymenee'' sold for $10.36
million.
   A record $11.55 million for Paul Cezanne was set by his 1893-94
still life ``Pichet et Fruits sur une Table.'' In 1988, his ``La
Cote du Galet, A Pontoise'' sold for $9.24 million.
   An abstract landscape by Wassily Kandinsky,
``Herbstlandschaft,'' sold for $3.96 million, a record for the
Russian-born artist whose next highest-priced work,
``Murnau-Landschaft Mit Kirsche 1,'' brought $2.4 million in 1987.
   The Gauguin, Cezanne and six other Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist works sold Tuesday were from the collection of
Jaimie Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune.
   All prices include the auction house's 10 percent commission.
   Sotheby's and Christie's, two of the largest auction houses in
the world, hope to ring up $572 million from 4,472 art works over
12 days of sales that began May 2.
   ``What do we do for an encore?'' asked Sotheby's auctioneer John
Marion.
   Then he answered his own question when he noted that the art
collection of the heir to the Campbell Soup Co. fortune, John
Dorrance, who died April 9, will be sold at Sotheby's in October.
   The multi-million dollar collection includes Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist paintings, as well as French 18th-century
furniture and porcelain.
