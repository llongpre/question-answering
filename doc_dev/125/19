   The Getty Museum paid a record $35.2 million for
a 16th-century Florentine portrait of Duke Cosimo de'Medici that
had been displayed in the Frick Collection since 1970.
   The price paid Wednesday was a record for an Old Master, and was
the fifth highest price paid for a painting at the world's two
major auction houses, Christie's and Sotheby's.
   Scholars described the work, sometimes called the Halberdier, as
the finest Italian Renaissance painting to be offered at auction in
more than a decade.
   Christie's said many consider it to be the finest Old Master
painting in private hands in the United States.
   The previous auction record for an Old Master painting was $10.4
million, paid for Andrea Mantegna's ``Adoration of the Magi'' in
London in 1985.
   The presale estimate for the Medici portrait was $20 million.
The price included a 10 percent buyer's premium.
   The painting, circa 1537, is by Jacopo da Carucci, who was known
as Pontormo. Chauncey Devereaux Stillman, a New York investor and
philanthropist who died Jan. 24, had lent it to the Frick in 1970
for its 50th anniversary exhibition.
   Stillman's lawyers said it would be sold for the benefit of the
Homeland Foundation, his charitable organization.
   Charles A. Ryskamp, president of the Frick, said in March that
he was devastated by the painting's removal and expressed concern
that it might leave the country.
   Paintings that have sold for more are: ``Irises'' by Vincent van
Gogh, $53.9 million; ``Yo Picasso'' by Pablo Picasso, $47.85
million; ``Sunflowers'' by van Gogh, $39.9 million, and ``Acrobat
and Young Harlequin'' by Picasso, $38.46 million.
