   The tiny gallery that bought the world's most
expensive painting for an anonymous client in a New York auction
has added another trophy to Japan's growing collection of
masterpieces.
   The Kobayashi Gallery of Tokyo bought ``Portrait of Dr.
Gachet,'' one of Vincent Van Gogh's last paintings, for $82.5
million after a 10-minute auction battle Tuesday with a telephone
bidder at Christie's auction house. The price includes a 10 percent
buyer's premium.
   A staff member of Hideto Kobayashi's one-room gallery in Tokyo's
fashionable Ginza district said the world record purchase, far
surpassing the $53.9 million paid for van Gogh's ``Irises'' at a
Sotheby's auction in November 1987, came as a surprise.
   ``We weren't prepared for the deluge of reporters and
photographers this morning,'' said Kasunori Tanabe. ``The price is
amazing. It's as if we bought a dream.''
   Tanabe said the new owner of ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' is a
company listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
but declined to say more.
   In New York, Kobayashi told Japan's Kyodo News Service that his
client was ``extremely pleased.''
   Kobayashi established an independent gallery in the Ginza, home
to hundreds of similar art dealers, 12 years ago after working for
the nearby Fujii Gallery, Tanabe said.
   Both galleries are active collectors of Impressionist works.
   With Tuesday's purchase, Kobayashi joined a growing list of
record-setting Japanese art buyers.
   The world's third most expensive painting, ``Les Noces de
Pierrette (Pierrette's Wedding)'' by Pablo Picasso, was sold for
$48.9 million in November to Nippon Autopolis Co. The firm said it
planned to make the painting the centerpiece of an auto racing
theme resort.
   Another record smasher, ``Sunflowers,'' by van Gogh, sits in the
corporate headquarters of Yasuda Marine and Fire Insurance Co. in
Tokyo. The $39.9 million purchase in March 1987 was a world record
at the time and marked a high-profile return of Japanese buyers to
the world art market.
   Several others among the world's 10 most expensive paintings
have gone to Japanese buyers.
   Shigeki Kameyama, owner of the Mountain Tortoise Gallery in
Tokyo, owns at least two prize masterpieces: ``The Mirror,'' by
Picasso, bought at Sotheby's for $26.4 million in November, and
``Interchange,'' by Willem de Kooning, also bought from Sotheby's
in November for $20.6 million.
   An anonymous buyer, bidding through a Tokyo department store,
paid $38.46 million for Picasso's ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin''
in a Christie's auction in 1988.
   Japanese dealers and collectors have bought 40 to 50 percent of
Impressionist works at Christies and Sotheby's auctions in the past
few years.
   Lackluster bidding in the most recent auctions indicates that
the meteoric price increases of the mid- to late-1980s have
plateaued, Sotheby's auctioneer Julian Thompson said in Tokyo last
month.
   But active Japanese participation at recent auctions indicates
that demand in Japan for the world's greatest masterpieces remains
strong, he said.
