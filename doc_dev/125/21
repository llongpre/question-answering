   Pamela Harriman, wife of the late Ambassador W.
Averell Harriman, will give Vincent van Gogh's ``Roses'' to the
National Gallery of Art, the gallery director said Tuesday.
   The painting, which Mrs. Harriman valued at $50 million to $60
million, will be the first van Gogh still life to join the National
Gallery's permanent collection.
   Gallery director J. Carter Brown also announced at a National
Press Club luncheon that the gallery had received gifts of three
major 20th century works from the late Rita Schreiber of Los Angeles
in memory of her husband, Taft B. Schreiber, a Republican activist
and MCA Inc. executive who died in 1976.
   The Schreiber gifts include a 1924 painting titled ``Harlequin
Musician'' by Pablo Picasso, ``Woman Seated in an Armchair'' painted
by Henri Matisse in 1940 and a 1927 bronze sculpture by Constantin
Brancusi titled ``Bird in Space.''
   Brown said ``Roses'' would be displayed as part of a three-month
exhibit devoted to anniversary gifts of art beginning March 17,
1991, the 50th anniversary of the opening of the gallery's West
Building.
   ``Our hope is that it will set an example for other patriotic
donors,'' he said.
   The gallery will receive complete title to the painting when Mrs.
Harriman dies.
   Mrs. Harriman said her husband, a former Democratic governor of
New York and heir to a railroad fortune, bought the van Gogh in
Paris in 1930 with his mother.
   A similar van Gogh still life, ``Irises,'' was sold at auction
for a record-breaking $53.9 million in November 1987.
   Another van Gogh, ``Sunflowers,'' sold in London in March 1987
for $39.9 million, making it the third costliest painting on record
after a Picasso self-portrait, ``Yo Picasso,'' which Sotheby's
auctioned May 9 for $47.8 million.
   ``Roses,'' measuring 28 inches by 35.5 inches, was one of four
still lifes van Gogh completed shortly before he left Saint-Remy,
France, in 1890, the year he died.
   Charles S. Moffett, senior curator of paintings at the National
Gallery and a van Gogh authority, said ``Roses'' was
``unquestionably one of van Gogh's most important and most beautiful
paintings.''
   Harriman, a former industrialist, banker, roving U.S. ambassador
and presidential adviser, died in 1986 at age 94. Ambassador to
London and Moscow during World War II, Harriman negotiated the 1963
nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union and was a leader of
the American delegation at the Paris peace talks that ended the
Vietnam War.
   In 1972, the W. Averell Harriman Foundation gave the National
Gallery 22 paintings by such artists as Cezanne, Degas, Gaugin,
Matisse, Picasso and Seurat.
