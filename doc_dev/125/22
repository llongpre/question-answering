A $32.6-million auction of film maker Billy Wilder's collection Monday night at 
Christie's kicked off a heady week of Impressionist and modern art sales. 
</P>
<P>
Enormous prices are on the agenda this week and Christie's and Sotheby's are 
predicting record sales, but the Wilder affair got off to a shaky start. 
Several pieces brought less than their low estimates and a few others failed to 
sell. The auction soon gathered steam, however, and eventually exceeded 
Christie's most optimistic estimate by more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
The 83-year-old collector kept his wit during the fray. "It was less 
nerve-wracking than a film preview," Wilder said, and proclaimed himself 
pleased with the results amid a crowd of friends and fans. 
</P>
<P>
"Head of a Woman," a 1921 classical pastel portrait by Pablo Picasso, brought 
the auction's top price of $4.8 million but less than Christie's low estimate 
of $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
Two works by Joan Miro more than made up for the Picasso. A sprightly 1936 
gouache, "The Farmer and His Wife," valued at $1.5 million to $2 million, 
brought $2.7 million from an unidentified American dealer. "The Star," a 1927 
oil inspired by a dream, commanded $2.6 million -- significantly more than 
Christie's high estimate of $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
Seven works sold for more than $1 million each, including Picasso's "Two Nude 
Women and Head of a Woman" ($1.98 million) and Alberto Giacometti's painted 
bronze sculpture "Standing Woman II" ($1.1 million). 
</P>
<P>
Records were set for 12 artists. Balthus' painting of a teen-age nude, "La 
Toilette," sold to a European dealer for a record $2 million. Ernst Ludwig 
Kirchner's painting "Two Nudes on a Blue Sofa" brought $1.5 million, a high for 
the German Expressionist. 
</P>
<P>
The auction also set records for Joseph Cornell ($495,000), Nicolas de Stael 
($638,000) and Mario Marini ($671,000). 
</P>
<P>
Wilder, who was born in Austria and worked in Berlin as a young man, moved to 
Hollywood in 1934. He acquired most of his modern art in the late '40s, '50s 
and early '60s. Those were his prime film-making years, when he directed the 
Academy Award winners "The Lost Weekend," "Sunset Boulevard" and "The 
Apartment," as well as "The Seven Year Itch" and "Some Like It Hot." 
</P>
<P>
Although Wilder lacked the means to buy major paintings by renowned artists, he 
snapped up high-quality works on paper and small sculptures and developed a 
sharp eye for new talent. 
</P>
<P>
The works sold at Christie's range from figurative to abstract and cover nearly 
100 years, but they reflect a fondness for Expressionist nudes, literary twists 
and spicy wit. 
</P>
<P>
Wilder's modern art covered the walls of his former home in Beverly Hills and 
his present apartment on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
A Los Angeles contingent including his wife, Audrey, actresses Claudette 
Colbert and Angie Dickinson and writer Dominick Dunne watched the auction from 
Christie's boardroom, but Wilder joined the crowd in the sale room. 
</P>
<P>
He has not revealed what he plans to do with his millions. 
</P>
<P>
Impressionist and modern art auctions will continue tonight with a big-ticket 
sale at Christie's, including 14 works from the Paul Mellon collection valued 
at $85.5 million to $90 million. Drawings and watercolors will go on the block 
Wednesday morning at Christie's, followed by relatively low-priced paintings 
and sculptures in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The auction crowd will move to Sotheby's on Wednesday night for the season's 
most highly publicized event -- the sale of Picasso's "Au Lapin Agile." 
Sotheby's officials have predicted that this 1905 cafe scene depicting the 
artist as a harlequin may break Picasso's record of $47.9 million and possibly 
bring more than the $53.9 million paid for Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," the 
world's most expensive artwork.
