   A Japanese department store said today that it
bought Pablo Picasso's ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' for a record
$38.46 million and plans to sell the Rose Period masterpiece to a
buyer in Tokyo.
   The pink-and-rose painting of two circus performers sold Monday
for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work of art created
in this century.
   It also was the third most expensive work of art ever auctioned.
It is surpassed only by two late 19th century paintings by Vincent
van Gogh sold in 1987, ``Irises'' at $53.9 million and
``Sunflowers'' at $41.3 million.
   Yasuhiro Tanaka, a spokesman for Mitsukoshi Department Store,
said in Tokyo that its representative Akio Nishino bought the
Picasso painting at the Christie's auction in London on behalf of
the store.
   ``We bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer
here in Tokyo,'' Tanaka said.
   But he said the store, which is a major importer of art into
Japan, had not decided on specific plans for displaying or selling
the painting.
   Nishino left the crowded saleroom after buying the painting and
slumped in a chair in a private room for 20 minutes.
   He didn't speak to reporters but wore a big smile. A director
said the man was emotionally exhausted.
   ``We offered him a glass of champagne but he didn't like it and
had Coca-Cola instead,'' said Mark Wrey, spokesman for the auction
house.
   ``The buyer told me he had bought a most wonderful masterpiece.
He didn't question the price _ he was very excited.''
   Japan's imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years
as increasingly affluent Japanese turn to collecting as a form of
investment.
   Japan's Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Co. bought Van Gogh's
``Sunflowers'' when it was sold at Christie's in London in March
1987. Dealers estimate that at least 30 percent of worldwide art
sales are to Japanese buyers, often large corporations that buy for
tax-free investment purposes.
   Picasso painted ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' in 1905 in his
Paris attic studio at 13 rue Ravignon using gouache, an opaque
watercolor easier to handle than oil paint.
   After being shown in Paris in 1905, it found its way into a
German museum and was confiscated by the Nazis in 1937 as an example
of decadent art. They sold it at auction in Switzerland to a Belgian
collector, and it had been in private hands since.
   Bidding on Monday opened at $9.2 million, and the painting sold
in 3{ minutes.
   The selling price topped the previous record for a 20th century
painting, $24.75 million paid for Picasso's ``Maternity'' Nov. 14 in
New York.
   Auctioneer Charles Allsopp said the price was not exorbitant.
   ``By any standard, Picasso was the towering figure of art in this
century. This picture was from his Rose Period, which is usually
considered his best, and it's the last great work of that series
likely to come on the market,'' Allsopp said.
   ``In the 27 years I've been here, it has gripped more people and
people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture.
It has had practically no detractors _ even among those who don't
like Picasso.''
   A picture by the French Impressionist Claude Monet, ``The
Railroad Bridge at Argenteuil,'' sold for $12.55 million, also
joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at
auction.
   In June 28, another Monet painting, ``In the Field,'' sold at
Sotheby's in London for $24.90 million.
   Monday's auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought $102.01
million, a record for an Impressionist and modern art sale in
London. Individual records were set for works by Picasso, Paul
Gauguin, Alberto Giacometti, Paul Klee and Paul Signac.
