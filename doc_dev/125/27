   A Picasso self-portrait painted in 1901 sold for
$47.85 million Tuesday, a record for the artist and the
second-highest price ever paid for a single artwork at auction.
   The price paid at Sotheby's for ``Yo Picasso,'' painted when the
artist was 20 years old, was more than twice its pre-sale estimate
and $9.4 million more than the previous record for the Spanish
artist.
   ``It's in another stratosphere, but it's because there's a lot
of cash around,'' Paloma Picasso, the artist's daughter who
attended the auction, said when asked if she thought the bidding
had gotten out of hand.
   ``It's better that these people use their money for these
paintings rather than planes and bombs,'' she said.
   ``Yo Picasso'' last sold in 1981 for $5.5 million.
   The sale of 67 Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and Modern
works brought a total of $204.82 million, a record for a single
auction, topping the previous high of $117 million set in April at
Sotheby's in London.
   Works by Gauguin, Cezanne and Kandinsky also commanded
record-breaking prices at the Tuesday sale as the annual spring
art-buying frenzy continues.
   The winning bid, made by telephone, for the Picasso was followed
by long applause. The identity of the winning bidder was not
disclosed.
   The painting was sold for Wendell Cherry, president and chief
executive officer of Humana Inc., the hospital management
corporation based in Louisville, Ky.
   Another record was broken when Paul Gauguin's ``Mata Mua (In
Olden Times),'' sold for $24.2 million. The 1892 painting is an
idyllic, colorful landscape completed during the artist's first
trip to Tahiti.
   A still life, ``Pichet et Fruits sur une Table,'' painted by
Paul Cezanne in 1893-94, sold for $11.55 million, $2.3 million more
than the previous highest price for a Cezanne.
   An abstract landscape by Wassili Kandinsky,
``Herbstlandschaft,'' sold for $3.96 million, a record for the
Russian-born artist.
   Other works that commanded prices in the millions were:
   _ Two portraits by Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The first, ``Jeune
Fille au Chapeau Garni de Fleurs des Champs,'' was painted in 1880
and brought $13.75 million. The other, ``Couple Lisant,'' painted
in 1877, sold for $3.08 million.
   _ An early Claude Monet, ``Garden House on the Banks of the
Zaan,'' painted in 1871, sold for $11 million.
   A portrait by Monet of his second wife, ``Alice Hoschede au
Jardin,'' brought $8.8 million.
   _ Mary Cassatt's ``Augusta Reading to Her Daughter'' fetched
$3.08 million.
   _ ``Asters et Fruits sur une Table,'' a still life by Henri
Fantin-Latour, brought $1.87 million.
   _ ``Fete de Septembre, Pontoise,'' a city scene by Camille
Pissarro, dated 1872, sold for $1.98 million.
   ``Laveuses au Bord de la Touques,'' a beach scene by Eugene
Boudin, bettered its pre-sale estimate of between $200,000 and
$300,000, selling for $407,000.
   All prices include the auction house's 10 percent commission.
   Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises'' sold for $53.9 million in 1987 _
the most ever paid for an artwork at auction.
   The previous record for a Picasso, who died in 1973, was $38.46
million last year for ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin.''
   The record for a Gauguin was set just last month: $10.36 million
for ``The Fare Hymenee.'' Cezanne's ``La Cote du Galet, A
Pontoise,'' sold in 1988 for $9.24 million.
   The previous record for a Kandinsky was set in 1987 when
``Murnau-Landschaft Mit Kirsche I'' sold for $2.4 million.
   The first eight canvasses on the block at Sotheby's, including
the Gauguin and Renoirs, were from the collection of Jamie
Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune, now living in
Switzerland.
   Sotheby's and Christie's, two of the largest auction houses in
the world, hope to ring up $572 million from 4,472 art works over
12 days of sales that began May 2.
