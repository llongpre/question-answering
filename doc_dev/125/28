   Nearly 140 masterpieces from two formidable
family collections, including a celebrated, $40.7 million
self-portrait by Pablo Picasso, are going on display Sunday at the
National Gallery of Art.
   Opening in the gallery's modernistic East Building is the first
and only U.S. exhibition of 85 old masters, impressionists,
post-impressionists and early modern works from the collection of
the late Swiss industrialist, Emil G. Buehrle.
   Appearing simultaneously in the gallery's West Building is the
entire collection of 54 paintings, watercolors and drawings from
the home of millionaire publisher Walter H. Annenberg in Rancho
Mirage, Calif., shown together for the first time on a national
tour that began last summer in Philadelphia.
   Gallery director J. Carter Brown called the twin exhibitions ``a
fabulous double-header'' and said that ``we may never see in our
lifetime a concentration of art of such quality and importance.''
   First lady Barbara Bush, wearing a white jacket and pearls,
attended a gallery reception in Annenberg's honor Wednesday night
and toured his collection with Brown as her personal guide. She is
said to be an admirer of French impressionist paintings.
   Brown said the Buehrle exhibit was drawn from 321 works _ many
of them rarely seen in public _ that comprise ``one of the greatest
private collections to have been created in the 20th century.''
   The 38 Italian, Dutch, French and Spanish artists represented in
the show range from Frans Hals and Francisco Goya to impressionists
Edouard Manet, Camille Pissarro, Edgar Degas, Paul Cezanne, Claude
Monet, Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh.
   Among the 20th century masters in the exhibit, titled ``The
Passionate Eye: Impressionist and Other Master Paintings from the
Collection of Emil G. Buehrle,'' are Henri Matisse, Georges Braque,
Picasso, Franz Marc and Wassily Kandinsky.
   Brown said Annenberg, a philanthropist, publisher and former
U.S. ambassador to Britain, and his wife, Leonore, had ``assembled
one of the world's greatest private collections of impressionist
and post-impressionist art.''
   The National Gallery show includes three recent Annenberg
acquisitions that did not appear in the Philadelphia exhibit,
Braque's ``The Studio,'' Henri Fantin-Latour's ``Asters and Fruit
on a Table'' and the Picasso self-portrait, ``Au Lapin Agile.''
   Annenberg bought the 1905 Picasso painting at Sotheby's in New
York last November for $40.7 million, the third most expensive
artwork ever sold at auction.
   Since he sold his publishing empire to Rupert Murdoch for $3
billion in 1988, the 82-year-old collector has accelerated his art
purchases amid intense speculation over the eventual fate of his
masterpieces.
   If Annenberg leaves his collection to a museum, the National
Gallery is considered a likely candidate, along with the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Philadelphia Museum of
Art and possibly the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
   
   
   Brown ducked a reporter's question last week about the National
Gallery's chances of acquiring the Annenberg collection, which
includes eight Cezannes, five van Goghs, six Monets and other
paintings by Degas, Gauguin, Matisse and Pierre-Auguste Renoir. The
show also includes an Annenberg portrait by Andrew Wyeth and a
montage by Romare Bearden of the ``Roots'' television miniseries
that Annenberg commissioned for the cover of TV Guide.
   Americans will never have another chance to view the Buehrle
collection after its current world tour, unless they travel to the
family home in Zurich, Switzerland. When the tour ends, the family
says it will retire the collection from international lending.
   The Buehrle show, underwritten by Martin Marietta Corp., will
remain until July 15. It also will appear at the Montreal Museum of
Fine Arts, Aug. 3 through Oct. 14; the Yokohama Museum of Art in
Japan, Nov. 2 to Jan. 13, 1991; and the Royal Academy of Arts in
London, Feb. 1 to April 14.
   ``Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism: The
Annenberg Collection'' will appear at the National Gallery through
Aug. 5, and at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from Aug. 16
through Nov. 11. It will appear at New York's Metropolitan Museum
next summer.
   The exhibition is underwritten by the GTE Corp.
