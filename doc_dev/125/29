   The Japanese again reached into the upper echelons
of the world art market Thursday, outbidding a Parisian dealer to
buy a Picasso masterpiece for $48.9 million _ a record for a work
by the artist.
   ``Pierrette's Wedding,'' a long-disappeared masterpiece from
Picasso's famed blue period, was bought by Nippon Autopolis Co. in
an auction linking bidders in Paris and Tokyo by live satellite TV.
   Action at the Drouot-Montaigne auction house was a tense duel
between an unidentified Japanese bidder in Toyko and Herve
Odermatt, a well-known Paris art dealer.
   When the bidding topped Odermatt's offer of $45.9 million, he
paused for several seconds. The standing-room-only room packed with
celebrities fell silent.
   Odermatt finally shook his gray head, indicating he would go no
higher. Auctioneer Jean-Claude Binoche banged the gavel, and the
painting belonged to the Japanese company.
   ``Of course I'm very disappointed, especially since I was so
close to getting it,'' Odermatt said in an interview. ``During the
few seconds I hesitated _ and I knew everyone was waiting _ I kept
thinking about the condition of the painting. That's what finally
made me decide to let it go.''
   Odermatt said pre-sale estimates that the painting would go for
$50 million to $70 million were not justified.
   ``I spent half an hour last night examining the work, and it was
worn and awfully varnished,'' he said. ``If it had been in perfect
condition, the sky was the limit.''
   The poignant group portrait painted in 1905 will have a new home
in a specially built museum located in an auto-racing theme resort
in the mountains of southern Japan.
   ``We felt we absolutely must have the real thing, a real
masterpiece like this for our museum,'' said Takeshi Inaba, senior
managing director of Nippon Autopolis. ``We're very happy to have
bought the painting.''
   The previous Picasso record was held by ``Yo Picasso,'' which
sold for $47.85 million at Sotheby's in May.
   The record for any work of art _ $53.9 million dollars _ was set
in 1987 for Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises.''
   Thursday's sale also included a series of 26 paintings by
American pop artist Andy Warhol titled ``Ladies and Gentlemen.''
They were sold in Tokyo for prices ranging from between one-half to
two-thirds their pre-sale estimates.
   ``It was a big mistake to auction the Warhols in Tokyo and
Paris,'' said French collector Alain Lesieutre. ``They would have
brought top dollar in the United States.''
   Lesieutre called the price paid for the Picasso ridiculously low.
   ``It's a gift, a giveaway. It's a masterpiece and should have
brought much more, but the French are afraid of big money,'' he
said.
   On hand for the sale was Picasso's daughter, Paloma, who blamed
the lack of excitement and relatively low price on the presence of
TV cameras. ``The atmosphere was cold,'' she said.
   ``Pierrette's Wedding'' is considered one of Picasso's most
important paintings because of its unusually large size, its
hauntingly beautiful blues and pinks, and its harlequin theme.
   The painting shows six figures, probably circus performers,
sitting around a table celebrating with an unsmiling newlywed
couple. The bride, her head draped with a Spanish-style mantilla,
has eyes only for her lover, whom she has abandoned to marry an
older, richer man pictured in a top hat.
   ``It's a transitional painting that announces all the colors and
forms that will dominate Picasso's works for years to come,'' said
Isabelle de Wavrin, art critic for Beaux Arts Magazine.
   The painting was put up for sale by Swedish industrialist
Frederik Roos, who acquired it in 1988. The painting was granted a
visa to leave France only after Roos donated another Picasso from
the blue period, ``La Celestine,'' to the Louvre.
   Although art historians are familiar with the dozens of sketches
Picasso drew in preparation for ``Pierrette's Wedding,'' the final
work disappeared years ago, changing hands many times before
surfacing in 1988 in a Picasso retrospective.
