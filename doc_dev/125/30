The heat of summer is still very much with us, but the sellers and buyers of 
the big-ticket art auction circuit are already looking ahead to a sizzling fall 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Evidence of that development is on view at Sotheby's Beverly Hills, which has 
unveiled a high-end sampling of a $100-million auction upcoming in New York. 
The local preview, continuing through Tuesday, features 24 Impressionist 
paintings from the collection of the late John T. Dorrance Jr., the former 
chairman of the Campbell Soup Co. 
</P>
<P>
A late Vincent van Gogh painting, depicting a woman awaiting the return of her 
sailor husband, and one of Claude Monet's "Haystack" paintings are the most 
expensive works exhibited. The Van Gogh is valued at $10 million to 
</P>
<P>
$15 million; the Monet is expected to bring between $7 million and $9 million. 
Big bucks, but not enough to surpass Van Gogh's record of $53.9 million (for 
"Irises") or Monet's record of $24.5 million (for "In the Prairie"). 
</P>
<P>
The auction itself is billed as a potential record-breaker, however. Sotheby's 
expects the four-day sale (Oct. 18-21) of about 1,000 objects to exceed 
Christie's $85-million auction of 28 Impressionist and modern paintings from 
the William and Edith Mayer Goetz collection. The Goetz sale in 1988 holds the 
record for a single collection sold at auction. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance, who died in April, collected a vast array of fine and decorative arts 
-- from Old Master paintings to European ceramics, French and English 
furniture, silver and Chinese jade. The local exhibition will showcase only the 
most valuable pieces, the Impressionist paintings that form the centerpiece of 
the collection. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a true Impressionist collection. It represents all of the 
Impressionist artists, most of them with very strong work," said Diana D. 
Brooks, president of Sotheby's North America. "You rarely see in one collection 
works by Renoir, Degas, Monet, Gauguin, Fantin-Latour -- the whole gamut -- and 
then continue into the 20th Century with Picasso and Matisse." 
</P>
<P>
Despite its wide range, the collection "fits together well" and shows a 
"consistency of taste," Brooks said. One reason is that many of the works were 
screened by the eye of a single vendor. Dorrance bought most of the paintings 
from Nicholas and William Acquavella, at their Acquavella Galleries in New 
York, Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh, "L'Homme est en Mer," depicts a woman rocking her baby and gazing 
into a fire. The artist painted it in 1889, the year before his death, while 
incarcerated at a mental asylum in Saint-Remy. The 26x20-inch oil was done 
after a reproduction of a painting, probably sent to Van Gogh by his brother 
Theo. Van Gogh often worked from reproductions at Saint-Remy, but he 
interpreted loosely and added his own color. In October, 1989, he wrote to 
Theo, "I have copied that 'Woman With a Child Sitting by a Hearth,' by Mme. 
Dumont-Breton, almost all in violet. I am certainly going on copying, that will 
give me a collection of my own, and when this is large and complete enough, I 
shall give the whole to a school." 
</P>
<P>
"Meules, Effet de Neige, le Matin" is part of Monet's renowned series of 
haystack paintings, depicting stacks of grain near his property at Giverny in 
different seasons and at various times of day. This particular canvas was 
painted on a winter morning in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Among the other top lots in the local exhibition are "Au Moulin Rouge," a 1901 
cabaret scene by Pablo Picasso, and Monet's 1877 landscape, "La Berge a 
Argenteuil" (both valued at $6 million to $8 million). Another Monet landscape 
on view, "Bords de la Seine, un Coin de Berge," is expected to bring between $5 
million and $7 million. Two other paintings are each valued at $4 million to $5 
million: "Danseuses" (circa 1895-1900), one of Edgar Degas' trademark paintings 
of dancers, and Henri Mastisse's "Femme a l'Ombrelle Rouge, Assise de Profil" 
(circa 1919-20), depicting a seated woman on a balcony, seen through the French 
doors of a Nice hotel room.

Dorrance, whose father, John T. Dorrance, invented condensed soup, was chairman 
of Campbell Soup Co. for 22 years before his retirement in 1984. He collected 
art over a period of about 30 years, acquiring most of his Impressionist 
pictures in the '60s and '70s. The collection has been well known in art 
circles. Dorrance was chairman of the Philadelphia Museum of Art at his death 
and he occasionally loaned works to traveling exhibitions. His Picasso, "Au 
Moulin Rouge," was in the Museum of Modern Art's massive Picasso retrospective 
in 1980 and Matisse's "Femme a l'Ombrelle Rouge" appeared at the National 
Gallery's 1986-87 exhibition, "Henri Matisse, the Early Years in Nice." 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance displayed most of his collection at his home in Gladwyne, Pa. He 
donated some works of art to the Philadelphia Museum of Art during his 
lifetime, but gave only a few ceramic pieces to the museum at his death, Brooks 
said. Except for those ceramics and some porcelains kept by family members, his 
entire collection will go on the block in October. 
</P>
<P>
The exhibition at Sotheby's, 308 N. Rodeo Drive, is open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
today through Saturday and Monday and Tuesday; Sunday hours are 1 to 5 p.m. The 
show is the first event in Sotheby's recently doubled exhibition space. The new 
galleries will be used for lectures, luncheons and dinners, as well as 
exhibitions, to more firmly establish Sotheby's presence in Los Angeles, Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
After leaving Beverly Hills, the Dorrance preview will travel to Paris, Zurich, 
Tokyo and Philadelphia. The entire collection will go on view in New York a few 
days before the mid-October auction.
