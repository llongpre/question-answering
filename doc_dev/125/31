   These days, it seems, if you've got something to
sell there's a buyer in Japan, no matter how big the price tag. So
it's hardly surprising that Japanese collectors of Western art are
on a spending spree. But many insiders in the art world, both at
home and abroad, are disturbed by the trend.

   Japanese speculators are scouring the art world for
the best money can buy, catapulting prices upward with a series of
audacious bids at auction houses in New York and London.
   Many museums and smaller galleries are dismayed, saying they
can't compete.
   This new buying spree is being led by real estate speculators
and bootstrap entrepreneurs such as Yasumichi Morishita, a Japanese
moneylender who made his fortune with high-interest loans and has a
reputation as an aggressive and indiscriminate buyer of art.
   Morishita has been the biggest Japanese buyer in recent months,
dealers say, as he fortifies his stock of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist paintings at his gallery, Aska International.
   Morishita and other Japanese investors spent $230 million in a
series of auctions in November alone.
   Along with individuals enriched by the appreciation of the yen
and ballooning stock and land prices, these new Japanese buyers
have become a strong force in many collectors' markets, from
antique musical instruments to vintage wines.
   Nowhere is this as evident as in the market for Impressionist
and modern paintings, where Japanese dealers and collectors are
snapping up about 40 percent to 50 percent of total sales at
London-based Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses, in some
cases, dealers say, with little regard for quality and price.
   The renewed Japanese appetite for Western art became evident in
1987 when Yasuda Marine and Fire Insurance Co. paid $39.9 million
for Vincent van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' _ at the time the world's
most expensive painting.
   Western collectors still are able to set art-market benchmarks,
such as the $53.9 million sale of Vincent van Gogh's 1889
``Irises'' in 1987 to Australian tycoon Alan Bond _ now the world
record. (Sotheby's announced on Jan. 10 that ``Irises'' is now back
on the auction block.) Also, a Picasso self-portrait ``Yo
Picasso,'' sold last May for $47.85 million to Kentucky executive
Wendell Cherry.
   But in a satellite-linked Tokyo-Paris auction on Nov. 30, a
Japanese resort and auto-racing firm, Nippon Autopolis, nudged
aside Cherry as owner of the world's second most costly painting,
with its $48.9 million knockdown of Picasso's ``Les Noces de
Pierrette.''
   Nippon Autopolis is far from the only Japanese winner of recent
art prizes. Shigeki Kameyama, wealthy owner of Mountain Tortoise
Gallery in Tokyo, set a new record for a living artist with his
$20.68 million purchase of Dutch artist Willem de Kooning's
``Interchange'' in November.
   Morishita made the following buys at auctions in New York and
London:
   _$10 million for one of Picasso's most important early works,
``La Maternite (Motherhood),'' on Nov. 27 in London.
   _$6.8 million for Paul Gauguin's 1889 painting of a Breton boy
in a landscape at a Sotheby's auction on Nov. 28.
   _$25 million out of total sales of $131.29 million from the
estate of the late Campbell Soup heir John T. Dorrance in October,
including $7.15 million for van Gogh's ``Man at Sea.''
   The new Japanese corporate buyers ``are entirely different
players from the owners of small- and medium-sized firms who used
to just collect privately,'' says Kazuko Shiomi, president of
Sotheby's in Tokyo.
   ``Corporations that have made their money in real estate or
financing have become professionals, part of the art industry.''
   Traditional dealers haven't exactly welcomed gruff, no-nonsense
Morishita. Police have investigated his Aichi corporate finance
firm several times, and he received a one-year suspended sentence
in 1986 for falsifying documents used in stock transactions.
   Kiyotaka Kori, Aska's gallery manager and a former secretary to
the tycoon, says Morishita wouldn't mind having a better image.
   ``In some reports, we've got a bad reputation, and Mr. Morishita
doesn't like that,'' Kori said as he relaxed on the Italian silk
couch in Aska's gallery, a bright spot of pastels and chrome beside
a grimy freeway in central Tokyo.
   Morishita, who lives in a brick mansion in one of Tokyo's
toniest neighborhoods, wasn't available for an interview. ``He
really doesn't like having his picture taken,'' said the gallery
manager.
