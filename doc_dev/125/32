   Sotheby's auctioned off Vincent van Gogh's painting "Irises" for $53.9 million, a world record at auction. 

   The price far exceeds the previous record of $39.9 million paid for van Gogh's "Sunflowers" last March in London, proving again that art and stock have little in common. 

   The crowd in the packed sale room cheered and applauded wildly as the final price was reached. 
The buyer's name wasn't disclosed and bidding for at least the last $20 million was a contest between two people on the telephone. 

   Sotheby's would say only that the van Gogh was bought by a European agent for an anonymous collector "somewhere in the world." 
The price includes a 10% sales commission. 

   The seller of the painting, John Whitney Payson, said at a news conference after the sale that he was "euphoric." 
Mr. Payson, who said his mother had paid $84,000 for the painting in 1947, said that he is giving most of the proceeds to various charities. 

   Mr. Payson's mother, Maine philanthropist Joan Whitney Payson, owned the New York Mets baseball team until her death in 1975. 
After she died, the painting was displayed at Westbrook College in suburban Portland, Maine, in a gallery that Mr. Payson built in her memory. 

   "Irises," a 28-by-36 5/8-inch oil, depicts a patch of purple irises and one white bloom in a garden. 
The work was painted in 1889 while van Gogh was a voluntary patient at an asylum for the insane in Saint-Remy de Provence, France, where he lived until his suicide in 1890 at 37 years old. 

   Journalists from around the world, including two television crews from Japan, attended the auction. 
Celebrities present included Andy Williams, Bianca Jagger and Jack Nicholson. 

   John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North America, a unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc. of London, said after the sale: "I was telling everybody that this painting ("Irises") would transcend the stock market. 
There is no other opportunity to purchase something like this." 

   After selling the van Gogh, Lot 25 of 100 artworks sold, Mr. Marion, who was the auctioneer, had trouble quieting the crowd. 
"Well, back to earth folks," he said, and indeed it was. 
While the evening's total sale of $110.2 million was an auction record, there were 25 works that didn't sell, including some by Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso. 

   Before the sale, New York art dealer Stephen Hahn said whatever the price it "won't have an effect on the art market, it is one single picture and a far better painting than `Sunflowers.' " Mr Hahn added: "We still had a rather shocking period for the stock market and that has to show up sometime." 

   On his way out, Mr. Nicholson said to a woman seated next to him: "Just say I wouldn't pay a penny over $32 million and let it go at that."
