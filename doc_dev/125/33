   A Japanese department store bought Pablo Picasso's
``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' for $38.46 million Monday night at
Christie's, the highest price ever paid at auction for a 20th
century work of art.
   The painting was purchased by the Mitsukoshi Department Store,
store spokesman Yasuhiro Tanaka said in Tokyo.
   ``We bought the painting expecting to sell it to a private buyer
here in Tokyo,'' Tanaka said. Mitsukoshi, a major importer of art,
has not yet decided on specific plans for the display or sale of the
painting, Tanaka said.
   A picture by the French Impressionist Claude Monet, ``The
Railroad Bridge at Argenteuil,'' sold for $12.55 million, also
joining the list of the 10 most expensive works of art sold at
auction.
   In June 28, another Monet painting, ``In the Field,'' sold at
Sotheby's in London for $24.90 million.
   Spokesmen for the auction house did not disclose the purchaser or
the seller of the Picasso painting. They only identified the seller
as a private owner.
   The 1905 work from the artist's Rose Period was sold in 3{
minutes. Bidding opened at 5 million pounds ($9.2 million) and ended
at 20.9 million pounds ($38.46 million). The price topped the
previous record for a 20th century painting, $24.75 million paid for
Picasso's ``Maternity'' Nov. 14 in New York.
   Monday's auction of 60 works by 40 artists brought 55.44 million
pounds ($102.01 million), a record for an Impressionist and modern
art sale in London. Individual records were set for works by
Picasso, Paul Gauguin, Alberto Giacometti, Paul Klee and Paul Signac.
   Christie's had offered 69 paintings for sale, but nine were
withdrawn or did not reach the minimums set by the owners.
   After being shown in Paris in 1905, ``Acrobat and Young
Harlequin'' found its way into a German museum and was confiscated
by the Nazis in 1937 as an example of decadent art. They sold it at
auction in Switzerland to a Belgian collector and it had been in
private hands since.
   Japan's imports of art and curios have ballooned in recent years
as increasingly affluent Japanese turn to collecting as a form of
investment.
   In March 1987, Vincent Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers,'' painted in
1889, sold for $39.9 million at Christie's in London to Yasuda Fire
and Marine Insurance Co., a Japanese firm.
   Dealers estimate that at least 30 percent of worldwide art sales
are to Japanese buyers _ often large corporations that buy for
tax-free investment purposes.
   Picasso did the painting in 1905 in his Paris attic studio at 13
rue Ravignon using gouache, an opaque watercolor easier to handle
than oil paint.
   Auctioneer Charles Allsopp said the price paid for the painting
was by no means exorbitant.
   ``By any standard, Picasso was the towering figure of art in this
century. This picture was from his Rose Period, which is usually
considered his best, and it's the last great work of that series
likely to come on the market,'' Allsopp said.
   ``In the 27 years I've been here, it has gripped more people and
people with a greater variety of tastes than any previous picture.
It has had practically no detractors _ even among those who don't
like Picasso.''
