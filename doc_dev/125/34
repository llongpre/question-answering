   A private Latin American collector paid nearly
$25 million at auction for an early Pablo Picasso painting of a
mother kissing her son's upturned face, setting a record for a 20th
century work of art.
   ``Maternity,'' from the artist's blue period, sold Monday at
Christie's for twice its estimate, making it the third-highest price
ever paid for a work of art, behind Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises''
and ``Sunflowers.''
   The 1901 oil on canvas was one of 28 post-Impressionist and
modern works on sale from the collection of William Goetz, a
Hollywood motion picture executive, and his wife Edith, the daughter
of film mogul, Louis B. Mayer.
   The 28 lots, all of which sold, fetched $85,024,500 _ a record
for a single owner's sale at auction.
   ``This may well be the sale of the century,'' said Christie's
president Christopher J. Burge, who presided over the auction.
   ``Tonight's auction was ripe for success _ unsurpassingly
beautiful works of art, a fiercely competitive market, and a
renowned provenance,'' he said.
   Earlier, Burge had predicted that the sale would fetch about $50
million.
   The Goetzes built their collection _ generally considered one of
the best of its kind _ during the 1940s and 1950s. Until this
summer, their paintings hung in their Holmby Hills mansion in
California, where the couple once entertained lavishly. He died in
1969; she died in June at the age of 82.
   After intense bidding, ``Maternity'' sold to an unidentified
Latin American collector, whose winning bid was placed by telephone.
The painting was expected to sell for $10 million.
   It depicts a blue-robed mother in a high-backed chair, with a
scissors and sewing basket at her feet. The child, standing next to
her, has a ball in his hands.
   The auction house described the painting as a ``majestic, tender
but unsentimental affirmation of maternal love.''
   ``It's a great, very rare picture,'' Burge said. ``It was a
unique opportunity to buy an early blue period picture'' of
Picasso's, who painted it when he was 20, he added.
   When Burge brought the hammer down on the $24.75 million bid, the
crowd broke into applause.
   ``Irises'' sold for $53.9 million in November 1987. A few months
earlier, Van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million.
   The second-highest priced work sold at Monday's auction was
Claude Monet's ``The Beach at Trouville,'' an 1870 oil on canvas,
which went for $10.78 million.
   The third-highest priced piece was Edgar Degas' ``Little Dancer
At 14 Years,'' a statue that sold for $10,175,000, a new record for
the artist. The statue depicts a dancer in polychromed bronze; she
wears a muslin skirt and her hair is tied with a satin ribbon.
   Eight artist's records were set during the auction; they were for
Picasso, Degas, Pierre Bonnard, Henri Fantin-Latour, Marie
Laurencin, Alfred Sisley, Chaim Soutine and Edouard Vuillard.
   All prices include a 10 percent commission paid by the buyer to
the auction house.
