   Thousands of students bicycled to major media and
government offices today to protest censorship, and officials
announced their first policy change in response to demands made in
nearly a month of pro-democracy protests.
   The Ministry of Supervision said today that it would allow more
open news reporting of corruption cases, saying the move was
``prompted by the recent demands of Beijing university students to
crack down on corruption.''
   Today's protest by more than 5,000 students came a day after a
petition signed by more than 1,000 Chinese journalists seeking
press freedom in this Communist nation was delivered to government
officials.
   ``We're riding bicycles today because we're too tired to walk,''
said a history student who was a veteran of four recent protest
marches along the 10-mile route from the nation's top schools to
Tiananmen Square downtown.

   U.S. automakers say they're working all out to
eliminate an ozone-destroying coolant from car air conditioners,
and a Vermont ban on the substance won't help.
   ``All they're really doing is hindering our progress from a
longer-term point of view,'' says Norm Nielsen, supervisor of
government regulatory programs at Chrysler Corp.
   ``The last thing we need is having separate standards in
states.''
   Vermont's Legislature last week enacted a bill to outlaw the
registration of cars with air conditioners using
chlorofluorocarbons beginning with the 1993 model year. Gov.
Madeleine Kunin has hailed the bill and is expected to sign it
within two weeks.

   Pablo Picasso would have gotten a kick out of
seeing his self-portrait sell for $47.85 million to become the
second most expensive art work ever auctioned, his daughter said.
   ``Yo Picasso,'' painted 88 years ago when the artist was 20, was
last sold in 1981 for $5.5 million.
   Its price Tuesday night at Sotheby's was more than twice its
pre-sale estimate and was second only to Vincent Van Gogh's
``Irises,'' which sold for $53.9 million in 1987.
   The Picasso was one of 67 Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and
Modern works that sold for a record total of $204.82 million. The
previous mark for one auction was $117 million at Sotheby's in
London in April.
   Paloma Picasso, who attended Tuesday's sale, said she thought
her father ``would get a kick out of it'' if he knew how much his
self-portrait had brought.

   A gunman who killed his estranged wife was
captured at Logan International Airport today after commandeering a
plane, firing shots from the air and ``dive-bombing'' the control
tower and the Post Office where he worked, authorities said.
   The man shot his wife to death Tuesday night in her home in
Danvers as their 5-year-old son watched, said state Trooper Mark
Lynch.
   The man, apparently armed with an assault rifle, flew the small
plane for more than three hours up and down the Massachusetts
coastline from Danvers to Duxbury, touching down briefly at Logan
but taking off again, Boston police spokeswoman Jill Reilly said.
   Alfred James Hunter III, 42, was captured shortly after 1 a.m.
when he landed it at the airport, police said. The Cessna 152
Trainer had only five minutes worth of fuel left when it landed,
said Lynch. No weapons were recovered.

   The hopes and dreams of more than 3 million
people seeking to enter the United States now rest with a computer
designed to pluck the winners of a special ``visa lottery'' from
their applications.
   The State Department announced on Tuesday that some 20,000
nominees will be chosen at random by the computer, making them
eligible for visas granting entry into the country in 1991 or 1992.
   ``The so-called `visa lottery' is now over _ 3.2 million people
applied sucessfully'' to enter the pool of potential winners,
spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
   Near-riots were touched off at U.S. embassies and diplomatic
posts around the world after the State Department announced the
special program, under which nearly anyone from 162 countries could
apply.

   Keith Whitley, a rising star of country
music who followed the hard-living lifestyle he sang about in
wrenching tunes chronicling pain and joy, has died of alcohol
abuse. He was 33.
   The body of the bearded, handsome performer was found in bed at
his suburban home Tuesday afternoon.
   An autopsy showed a blood alcohol content of 0.477, medical
examiner Charles Harlan said. That's almost five times the 0.10
considered intoxicated for driving in Tennessee.
   Traces of cocaine and Valium also were found in his system but
alcohol overdose was cited as the direct cause of death, Harlan
said.
