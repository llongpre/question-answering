   Investigators on Thursday recovered $17
million in artworks stolen from Pablo Picasso's granddaughter,
finding them at the home of a restaurateur, who was then arrested,
police said.
   Two other men _ both security guards at Marina Picasso's villa
in Cannes _ also have been arrested in the theft of the 13 works on
Sunday, police said.
   The restaurateur, Fernand Laugier, 47, was arrested in nearby Le
Pradet and charged with fencing stolen goods. The security guards,
Serge Clouzeau and Daniel Jaguin, were charged with serious theft.
All three men remained jailed Thursday night.
   Clouzeau was on vacation when the theft took place Sunday
morning and Jaguin had gone shopping for a loaf of bread, leaving
the villa unguarded for 40 minutes. Ms. Picasso was not home.
   Police identified the missing works only as seven paintings by
Pablo Picasso, a Breughel, an Odilon Redon, three lesser-known 19th
century works and a bust by sculptor August Rodin.
   The works have an estimated value of $17 million. All were
recovered Thursday and transferred to Nice, where the investigation
continues, police said.
   Ms. Picasso was spending the weekend in the Alpine town of
Megeve when the theft occurred at her 1900s-style Pavillon de Flore
in the Basse Californie section of Cannes.
   Ms. Picasso has made no public comment since returning to Cannes
on Monday. She is the daughter of Paul Picasso, the painter's son,
and his first wife, Olga Kokhlova.
   Investigators with the Nice police said early in the case that
all signs pointed to someone with intimate knowledge of the
property.
   There were almost no signs of a break-in, the sophisticated
burglar alarm did not function, and none of the five guard dogs
raised a fuss.
   Three current and former employees at the villa, including
Jaguin's girlfriend, were questioned Tuesday and released.
