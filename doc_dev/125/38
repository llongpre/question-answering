   The sale of Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises'' for a
record $53.9 million two years ago was considered a loud vote of
confidence in an art market still under the cloud of Wall Street's
Black Monday.
   But two years later the world's most expensive painting is
sitting in a vault, and the ``Irises'' deal is looking wilted.
   It turns out that Sotheby's lent Australian tycoon Alan Bond $27
million to buy the 1889 painting; that as collateral Bond posted
the picture he was going to buy; that Bond has not paid off the
loan; that Sotheby's, not Bond, now has the painting; that Bond,
reportedly $5 billion in debt, apparently wants to sell the
painting, or at least his share of it.
   And Sotheby's said Thursday it was abandoning the loan policy
that produced the whole fiasco and, critics complained, inflated
art prices in general.
   In an interview, Michael Ainslie, head of Sotheby's, said buyers
will no longer be allowed to use art objects they intend to
purchase to secure loans from the auction house.
   Since a painting is worth what someone is willing to pay for it,
and since what someone is willing to pay often depends on how much
that someone can borrow, auctioneer's loans have the potential to
stoke the art market.
   An auction house could use such loans to increase bidding and
hike prices _ and the value of its own 10 percent commission. If
the borrower-bidder defaults, notes Time magazine art critic Robert
Hughes, the auctioneer takes back the picture, writes off the loan
and resells the work at its new, possibly inflated, price.
   Since auction houses usually charge several points over the
prime lending rate, some critics have described them as a lender of
last resort. Christie's, Sotheby's rival, does not lend money to
buyers.
   Ainslie said Sotheby's made such loans rarely and carefully, and
that their discontinuation would have no impact on art prices.
   ``It was merely a financial service to our clients,'' he said.
``But our foremost concern is our credibility, so we're making this
change largely to correct the misperception that something was
wrong.''
   Angelo Aponte, the city's Commissioner of Consumer Affairs,
agreed: ``I don't think it's going to reduce prices, but Sotheby's
had to do it to protect its own credibility. That's the biggest
thing an auction house has going for it.''
   Ainslie said Sotheby's had extended such loans only six times on
objects that sold for more than $1 million.
   But one was ``Irises,'' whose sale, according to art dealer
Richard L. Feigen, ``had a real impact on the art market.''
   ``Assume that Bond could not have bid without Sotheby's
financing,'' he said. ``Where would the bidding have stopped?''
   If it stopped short of $40 million, would anyone have paid $47.9
million for ``Yo Picasso'' last May? Would Walter Annenberg have
paid $40.7 million for the same artist's ``Au Lapin Agile'' in
November?
   Ainslie's response: Bond probably would have bought the painting
without the Sotheby's loan. At the time of the sale, he was no
credit risk.
   Ainslie's assessment was supported by Thomas Hoving, former
director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and editor of
Connoisseur magazine, who blamed critics and art dealers for the
controversy.
   Dealers, he said, dislike auction houses for luring away their
business; critics, he said, were trying to make something of
nothing. ``Sotheby's just said, `Let's cut our losses. Who needs
this?''' he said. ``It's a peripheral issue.''
   And what of ``Irises'' _ the painting? Sotheby's took it back
after Bond was forced to extend his loan, but Ainslie wouldn't say
where it is ``because of security considerations.'' It is widely
thought to be in a vault in Switzerland.
   And what is ``Irises'' now worth? About what Bond bid for it in
1987, said Ainslie; $30 million to $40 million, according to
skeptical dealers.
   ``We are having discussions with several parties,'' said Michael
Cross, a Bond associate. ``We have received a great many
approaches, but nothing is conclusive at this stage.''
