   Police said a security guard and three other
people were held in custody Tuesday in connection with the theft of
$17 million of art from the home of Pablo Picasso's granddaughter.
   None was charged and investigators released no names. All are
current or former employees of Marina Picasso and worked at her
French Riviera villa, including the guard who was out shopping for
bread Sunday morning at the time of the heist, police said.
   The four were interrogated Monday and will be questioned further
regarding the robbery of 13 works of art worth at least $17 million,
the officers said.
   Investigators identified the works only as seven paintings by
Pablo Picasso, one Brueghel, an Odilon Redon, three lesser-known
19th-century works and a bust by sculptor August Rodin.
   Ms. Picasso was spending the weekend in Megeve when the theft
occurred in the Basse Californie section of Cannes.
   Police said Tuesday they found a hole made in the fence
surrounding the estate, but no other signs of a break-in.
   The burglar alarm did not go off and none of the five guard dogs
interfered, police said. One guard was on vacation and the other had
gone shopping, leaving the house empty.
   Art experts said the items stolen were too well-known to be sold
on the art market by any serious collector or dealer.
