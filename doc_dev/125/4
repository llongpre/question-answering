   In 1905, Pablo Picasso painted ``Au Lapin
Agile,'' a Parisian tavern scene, for his suppers. In 1989,
philanthropist Walter Annenberg bought it for $40.7 million.
   The painting, in which Picasso depicts himself as a harlequin,
had been described by John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's North
America, as the most important 20th-century picture to come up for
auction.
   Wednesday's price fell within the presale estimate, but left it
behind another famous self-portrait painted four years earlier.
``Yo Picasso'' sold for $47.85 million at Sotheby's in May, a
record for the artist and more than double its presale estimate.
   The record for any work of art _ $53.9 million _ was set in 1987
for Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises.''
   ``We were a little disappointed it didn't pass `Yo Picasso,'''
said John Payson, whose sister, Linda de Roulet, consigned ``Au
Lapin Agile.''
   Payson's and Mrs. de Roulet's mother, art collector and former
New York Mets owner Joan Whitney Payson, acquired the painting in
1952 for $60,000.
   She displayed it in her Long Island home and bequeathed it to
her daughter. ``Irises'' also came from the collection.
   John Payson had said his sister offered the Picasso because the
prices commanded by ``Irises'' and ``Yo Picasso'' made her ``a bit
nervous having the painting in her house.''
   Mrs. de Roulet said she would establish a foundation for medical
research and education with part of the proceeds.
   Annenberg, of Rancho Mirage, Calif., the former U.S. ambassador
to London and friend of former President Reagan, was in the auction
house but bid by phone, said Diana Brooks, president of Sotheby's
North America.
   Marion said Annenberg's collection had ``just about everything
but a great Picasso.''
   While subdued in comparison with other recent auctions,
Wednesday night's sale drew an estimated 1,500 people, totaled
$269.5 million and set records for 12 artists.
   Among other highlights:
   _Picasso's ``The Mirror,'' one of a series of portraits of
sleeping women done in 1932, sold for $26.4 million to Japanese
dealer Shigeki Kameyama.
   _Picasso's ``Mere et Enfant,'' which dates from 1921 when the
artist's son was born, sold for $18.7 million to a private Japanese
collector.
   _Edouard Manet's ``La Promenade'' sold for $14.8 million to a
Japanese dealer.
   _Van Gogh's ``Quarry near Saint-Remy,'' a landscape painted in
1889, was sold for $11.5 million to a Japanese dealer.
   All prices include a 10 percent premium.
   `Young Girls at the Piano,'' a Renoir pastel produced in 1892 on
commission from the French government, failed to sell. The Renoir
had been expected to bring up to $30 million, but the high bid was
$17.5 million.
   ``Au Lapin Agile,'' which means the agile rabbit, was the name
of the tavern frequented by Picasso.
   He painted ``Au Lapin Agile'' when he was 25. It shows him and a
woman _ model Germaine Pichot _ standing at a bar, brooding and
disenchanted with one another. Picasso had blamed Pichot for
causing his best friend's suicide.
   ``The big question in the picture is whether or not at the time
it was painted Picasso was actually having an affair with this
woman,'' Brooks said.
   A photograph from the period shows the painting hanging unframed
in a bar.
   ``I painted it in exchange for free meals and drinks,'' Picasso
once said.
