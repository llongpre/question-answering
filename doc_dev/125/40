   Chanel suits, conversations in French and
exclamations of ``Darling, how are you!'' are as much a part of the
annual spring art auction blitz as multi-million dollar price tags
and Japanese investors.
   Hundreds of paintings by Picasso, Monet, Warhol, Pollack and
others make the sales at Christie's and Sotheby's auction houses an
art-lover's dream. More than a half-billion dollars' worth of art
will be sold during the 12 days of blockbuster sales that began May
2.
   On Wednesday, record prices were paid for Impressionist and
modern paintings as bidders set marks for eight artists at a
Christie's auction. A Claude Monet painting sold for $14.2 million.
   A day earlier, Picasso's 1901 self-portrait ``Yo Picasso'' sold
for $47.85 million at Sotheby's, second only the $53.9 million for
Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises'' in 1987.
   As the rich rub elbows over Degas and Dali, they're not just
ferreting out their personal favorites and the best investments.
They're also offering people-watchers a firsthand look at how the
other half lives.
   At a recent Sotheby's auction, comments like ``How are things in
Berlin?'' and ``I just got back from London'' were almost as common
as pearls and Chanel handbags with leather-and-gold chains.
   A cocktail party at Christie's, where clients previewed art over
asparagus-and-salmon hors d'oeuvres, featured lots of ladies in
black off-the-shoulder dresses pecking each other on the cheek. A
crimson velvet tunic here and a red satin fringed shawl there lit
up the sea of black.
   ``If I fall in love with something, I might buy it,'' said Eva
Kollsman, a silver-haired woman in a gold-and-black spangled tunic.
``But I think a lot of people come here to get free food, free
drink and that's about it. They haven't the vaguest intention of
bidding on anything.''
   Among the non-buyers was Sarah Schulte, who got on the party
guest list through a relative.
   ``I was listening to one man who thought a Renoir was a steal at
$3 million, and I thought, I'm in the same room with this person,''
she said. ``It's very New York, and I love to do things that are
very New York.''
   Berenice Berke Hetkin, wearing a dashing black hat and a
red-and-black polka-dotted top, attended the party as a possible
buyer, but added: ``If you run into somebody you know, it's a
plus.''
   Art collector John Dallas disagreed: ``Sometimes you see people
you know and you don't want to talk to them because they might
influence your bidding.''
   Seats at blockbuster auctions are reserved for collectors, but
anyone can get a free ticket to stand by calling in advance.
Michelle Porcella, a painter from New Jersey, braved the crowded
public section at Sotheby's on Tuesday because, she said: ``It
gives me inspiration to keep going. I know I'm going to be
successful and it's inspiring to know that people will pay so much
for art.''
   Her friend, Gail Miller, said the auction's art and fashions
give her ideas for her work as a jewelry designer. ``I watch what
people wear from the ladies' room on.''
