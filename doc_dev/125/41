   The sale of a van Gogh for a record $82.5
million bodes well for tonight's auction of a renowned Renoir
painting, but collectors aren't spending so freely for less
significant works, art experts said.
   Renoir's depiction of an open-air dance hall in Montmartre, ``Au
Moulin dela Galette,'' is to be auctioned at Sotheby's.
   On Tuesday night, van Gogh's ``Portrait of Dr. Gachet'' was the
highlight of a contemporary art sale at Christie's, drawing a
record bid from a Japanese gallery.
   ``When you have a tremendous painting, like the van Gogh or the
Renoir that's coming up Thursday night, you're going to get
extraordinary prices,'' said Milton Esterow, editor and publisher
of ARTnews.
   Buyers are being selective, however, and only the most highly
prized works inspire frenzied bidding.
   Even with the van Gogh, Christie's entire sale brought a total
of $269.4 million. Although that was only $67,000 under the record
for an art auction held by Sotheby's, 24 of the 81 offerings did
not sell and some that did went for significantly less than their
pre-sale estimate.
   ``I think (Tuesday) night showed that the market is correcting
to a more realistic level,'' Esterow said.
   The Renoir is estimated by Sotheby's to sell for $40 to $50
million, the same presale estimate as the van Gogh. Its owner is
Betsey Cushing Whitney, the widow of John Hay Whitney, the
financier, publisher, sportsman and former ambassador to Britain.
   The large canvas captures an afternoon crowd of revelers beneath
a lush canopy of acacia trees at an open-air dance hall in
Montmartre that was popular in the artist's day.
   ``With the van Gogh taking such an unprecedented leap into $82
million that perhaps the other collectors will have to follow suit
and put their estimates a little bit higher as far as the Whitney
picture is concerned,'' said Harry Brooks, director of the
Wildenstein Gallery in Manhattan.
   The winning bid for ``Dr. Gachet'' was placed by Hideto
Kobayashi of the Gallery of Kobayashi of Tokyo. The gallery won a
heated bidding contest with an unidentified European buyer,
represented by Charles Allsopp, chairman of Christie's in London.
   The Japanese play a major role in the impressionist and
post-impressionist art market and accounted for a third of the
activity in the auction room, said Michael J. Findlay, who heads
the impressionist and modern art sales for Christie's. Americans
and Europeans represented the other two thirds, he said.
   Five of the 11 most expensive paintings sold at auction have
been bought by Japanese collectors, including Pablo Picasso's
``Pierrette's Wedding,'' purchased in 1987 for $51.3 million, and
van Gogh's ``Sunflowers,'' bought in 1987 for $39.9 million.
   The strong Japanese presence is attributed by art experts to the
wealth in Japan, bolstered the yen's rise against the dollar in
recent years. Also, Japan has a tradition since the 1930s of
collecting impressionist art.
   ``Van Gogh was an artist who was unabashedly an admirer of
Japanese art and prints,'' said Findlay. Many of the
impressionists' notions of composition _ like the flattened
perspective _ and color come directly from Japan, he said.
   David Nash, senior vice president in charge of fine arts at
Sotheby's in New York, said Japanese collectors had made inquiries
about ``Au Moulin de la Galette.''
   ``I have no predictions to make about what will happen to the
Renoir,'' Nash said. ``Obviously, it is encouraging to see that a
major 19th century painting can bring such a high price,'' he said
of the van Gogh.
   Renoir paintings have not fetched the top prices that van Gogh's
works have. The highest price paid for a Renoir was $17.7 million
in April 1989 for ``La Promenade''; it was bought by the J. Paul
Getty Museum. Until Tuesday night, the highest price ever paid for
a painting at auction was $53.9 million for van Gogh's ``Irises.''
   Esterow noted that substantially more Renoirs have been on the
market and that their quality is less consistent.
   But Findlay of Christie's said ``Au Moulin de la Galette'' was
special.
   ``There hasn't been a Renoir of that quality so we don't know
what the market will say about it,'' he said.
