   Vincent van Gogh's portrait of his innkeeper's
teen-age daughter, who wrote a vivid account of the artist's death
decades after his suicide, was set to be auctioned Wednesday and
was expected to bring more than $15 million.
   ``Portrait of Adeline Ravoux,'' one of van Gogh's last
paintings, is included in a slate of impressionist and modern
paintings scheduled for sale at Christie's auction house.
   The picture of the 13-year-old girl was made a month before van
Gogh committed suicide in July 1890 in the village of Auvers
outside Paris. In an essay written when she in her 70s, Adeline
Ravoux Carrie described the artist's final hours as he lay in his
room at her father's inn, dying of a gunshot wound.
   Interest in the painting is keen, experts say, in part because
it serves as a link to the artist's last days. Christie's, the
auction house where the sale will take place, estimates the work
may fetch more than $15 million.
   The portrait last changed hands in 1980 when an anonymous buyer
purchased it at a Sotheby's auction for $1.98 million.
   Over the past 14 months, three of paintings by van Gogh _ who
sold almost nothing during his lifetime _ have fetched previously
unheard-of multimillion-dollar prices that shocked the art world.
   In March 1987, van Gogh's ``Sunflowers'' sold for $39.9 million
at Christie's in London to a Japanese insurance company. Three
months later, ``The Trinquetaille Bridge'' went for $20.2 million,
also at Christie's in London. It was bought by an unidentified
collector in Switzerland.
   Then, in November, history was made when van Gogh's ``Irises,''
a composition of purple flowers and green leaves set off by a
single white iris, sold at Sotheby's in New York for $53.9 million
to an anonymous buyer, the highest price paid at auction for a
painting.
   In the painting auctioned Wednesday, Adeline, dressed in blue,
sits in profile on a chair. Her blond hair is tied with a blue
ribbon, her gaze is serene, her posture correct and her hands are
folded demurely in front of her. ``He observed her very deeply, and
when he came to paint her, he painted both the grace and stiff
awkwardness of an adolescent girl,'' said Michael Findlay, senior
vice president of Christie's and an expert on impressionist and
modern painting.
   But Mrs. Carrie, who died in 1965 at the age of 88, said in a
1956 essay that she didn't immediately appreciate the painting.
   ``I admit that I was only moderately satisfied with my portrait;
it was somewhat of a disappointment, for I did not find it was true
to life,'' Mrs. Carrie wrote.
   However, she was quoted in a 1953 interview as saying,
``Monsieur Vincent divined not the young girl I was, but the woman
I was to become.''
   Mrs. Carrie described van Gogh, who lived at her father's inn
during the last 2{ months of his life, as a disciplined artist and
``a soft and calm'' man who enjoyed playing with her baby sister.
   She described how a doctor and police were summoned after he
returned to the inn after shooting himself, and how his brother,
Theo, who was the artist's chief backer, came running from the
train station, his face ``distorted by grief.''
   Among the other artworks set to be auctioned Wednesday night are
works by Pierre Auguste Renoir, Mary Cassatt, Henri de
Toulouse-Lautrec, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque.
