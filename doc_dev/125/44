<LEADPARA>  Pablo Picasso was alternately angelic and cruel, generous and stingy, says
biographer John Richardson, whose first volume on the life of the Spanish-born
artist is being published this month.;    Richardson, an art historian and
Picasso protege, said in an interview in the February issue of Vanity Fair
that the artist was "a strange mixture of exhibitionism and secretiveness."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's so difficult to write about Picasso, because you always have to see
the other side of the coin," Richardson said. "He was an angelic friend but
also demonic and cruel. He was incredibly generous but also unbelievably
stingy.;    "I've tried to demolish the legends, because the real story is so
much more interesting," Richardson said. "Usually people who have these
diametrically opposed qualities are in a loony bin, but somehow Picasso
managed to contain all this within himself and put it to such fantastic use.";
   The four volumes of "A Life of Picasso" are to be published by Random
House. The first volume covers the artist's birth in 1881 through the creation
of "Les Demoiselles d'Avignon," painted in Paris in 1906. Picasso died in 1973
at age 91.  </TEXT>
