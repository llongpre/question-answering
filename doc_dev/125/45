   A drawing by Pablo Picasso sold in London Wednesday
for $1.58 million, which Christie's said they believed was a record
for any drawing by the Spanish-born artist.
   William Hanham, spokesman for the auction house, said it went to
a private buyer who wants to be anonymous.
   The sale came two days after another Picasso work, ``Acrobat and
Young Harlequin,'' in opaque watercolor called gouache, was bought
at Christie's by Japan's Mitsukoshi department store for $38.46
million, the highest price paid at auction for a 20th century work
of art.
   The three-day sale of Impressionist and modern art made a total
of nearly $126 million, Christie's said.
   The Picasso drawing in crayon and pencil depicts a fluted
wineglass, three peaches, playing cards, a cigarette pack and table
napkins.
   Titled ``Still-life with Peaches and Playing Cards,'' it was done
in Avignon, France, in 1914 when Picasso was experimenting with
Cubism in more natural forms.
   The picture was included in a sale of drawings, sculpture, prints
and posters from the collection of the late Douglas Cooper, a
British friend of Picasso and a prolific writer on modern art. The
auction brought $5.68 million, more than three times the presale
estimate.
   ``All the 127 lots were sold and it's been a long time since that
happened,'' Hanham added.
   A brown felt-tip pen drawing by the Russian-born artist Nicolas
de Stael of a vase of flowers, which was little more than a doodle,
was bought by an unidentified telephone bidder for $32,400. Its top
presale estimate was $1,110.
   Other artists represented in the sale included Georges Braque,
Juan Gris, Paul Klee, Fernand Leger and Alberto Giacometti.
   Earlier Wednesday, London art dealer Fred Mulder paid $549,450 at
Christie's for an 1895 lithograph of one of the most famous images
in modern art, ``The Shriek,'' by the Norwegian Edvard Munch and
hand-colored by him.
   The picture, sold anonymously, shows a woman screaming on a
bridge. Its evocation of anguish has become a symbol of the dying
19th century moving toward the new torments of the 20th.
   David Llewellyn, director of the auction firm's print department,
said the price made the work a record for a Munch print and one of
the most expensive prints ever sold.
   In an extraordinary week for London art sales, Christie's rival
Sotheby's on Wednesday sold a collection of 26 small abstract and
human figure bronzes by British sculptor Henry Moore for $1.95
million.
   The collection, sold separately, belonged to Bo Boustedt, a
Swedish architect and photographer.
