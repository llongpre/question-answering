   The Museum of Modern Art agreed to sell two
Picassos, a Monet, a Renoir and three other paintings from its
permanent collection to get Vincent van Gogh's portrait of the
postman Joseph Roulin, The New York Times reported Monday.
   The portrait, painted in 1888-89, arrived at the museum from a
bank vault in Zurich on July 31. Now, details of the deal that
brought it here have been made public.
   For much of this century, the painting was in the B. Mayer
collection in Zurich. It was bought in 1987 by the most recent
owners and placed in the bank vault.
   Christopher Burge, president of Christie's in New York,
estimated recently that ``Roulin'' would be worth roughly the same
at auction as van Gogh's ``Irises,'' which brought $53.9 million in
1987.
   Kirk Varnedoe, director of painting and sculpture at the Modern,
told the Times the museum got ``Roulin'' for substantially less
than that because the unidentified owners wanted it to hang in a
museum. Still, he said, the price was ``not a raging fire-sale
bargain.''
   At first, Varnedoe said, museum officials didn't think they
could afford the van Gogh. But ``because of changes in the art
market, pictures we had available were worth more than we had
thought they were worth, and so it now seemed possible.''
   In August, the museum, in exchange for ``Roulin,'' gave four
paintings and an undisclosed amount of cash to Swiss dealers Thomas
Ammann and Ernst Beyeler, who represented the owners.
   The dealers received a Monet titled ``Corona (Water Lilies),''
from around 1920; Renoir's ``Reclining Nude,'' 1902; Wassily
Kandinsky's ``Autumn Landscape, Murnau,'' 1908; and Picasso's
``Striped Bodice,'' September 1943.
   To reimburse the Modern for the cash it paid _ and, Varnedoe
hopes, provide some extra profits, as well _ three other paintings
will be sold at auction on Nov. 15 at Sotheby's in New York.
   They are Giorgio de Chirico's ``Evangelical Still Life,'' 1916,
which has a presale estimate of $2 million to $3 million; Piet
Mondrian's ``Blue Facade (Composition 9),'' 1913-14, estimated at
$3 million to $4 million; and Picasso's ``Studio in a Painted
Frame,'' April 1956, estimated at $2 million to $3 million.
   The donors of the works granted permission to sell them.
   Varnedoe said the paintings that were relinquished had mostly
languished in storage for years and were not considered crucial
representations of the collection. Even so, he said, the van Gogh
merited a considerable sacrifice.
   ``We feel van Gogh's portraits are the starting point for a
whole vein of 20th-century art,'' said Varnedoe. ``They had
influence on Matisse and many others, the whole concept of
revealing a personality not by appearance but color had a profound
influence, and we were not telling this part of the story of modern
art without the portrait. It was a missing chapter.''
