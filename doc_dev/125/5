   A scene in a Parisian tavern that Pablo Picasso
painted when he was 25 in exchange for free meals and drinks sold
for $40.7 million at auction Wednesday.
   The 1905 painting ``Au Lapin Agile,'' in which Picasso depicts
himself as a harlequin, is ``the most important 20th-century
picture to come up for auction,'' said John L. Marion, chairman of
Sotheby's North America.
   ``It goes to the Annenberg Collection,'' Marion said as he
hammered down the sale. Southeby's had predicted the work would
fetch $35 million to $40 million.
   The auction house said the painting will go to the private
collection of Walter Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., the
philanthropist and former owner of TV Guide magazine, a close
friend of former President Reagan.
   The painting was consigned by Linda de Roulet, daughter of art
collector Joan Whitney Payson, who acquired it in 1952 and hung it
in her Manhasset home. Mrs. de Roulet said in a statement she felt
``Au Lapin Agile'' has become too valuable a painting to keep.
   ``I plan to establish a foundation for medical research and
education with part of the proceeds,'' she added.
   ``Au Lapin Agile'' was painted four years after another famous
self-portrait, ``Yo Picasso,'' which sold for $47.85 million at
Sotheby's in May. That was a record for the artist and more than
double its presale estimate.
   The record for any work of art _ $53.9 million _ was set in 1987
for Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises,'' also from the Payson collection.
   Several other paintings were on the block Wednesday:
   _Picasso's ``The Mirror,'' one of a series of portraits of
sleeping women done in 1932, was expected to bring up to $25
million.
   _``Mere et Enfant,'' which dates from 1921 _ the year of the
birth of Picasso's son _ is estimated at up to $15 million.
   _A Renoir pastel, ``Young Girls at the Piano,'' produced in 1892
on a commission from the French government, did not sell Wednesday.
It had been expected to bring up to $30 million.
   _Van Gogh's ``Quarry near Saint-Remy,'' a landscape painted in
1889, was estimated to bring up to $15 million.
   _Major pieces by Piet Mondrian, Picasso, Paul Klee, Willem de
Kooning, Claude Monet and Joan Miro were being auctioned from the
collection of the late Edgar Kaufmann Jr. The 21 pieces were
expected to bring between $30 million and $40 million.
   Diane Brooks, Sotheby's president, described ``Au Lapin Agile''
as a large, powerful, serious painting, one of the most important
of Picasso's rose period.
   In addition, she said, ``The subject has a story behind it.''
   Done when he was 25, the painting shows Picasso and a woman _
model Germaine Pichot _ standing at a bar, brooding and obviously
disenchanted with one another.
   Picasso blamed Pichot as being the cause of his best friend's
suicide four years earlier.
   ``The big question in the picture is whether or not at the time
it was painted Picasso was actually having an affair with this
woman himself,'' Brooks said.
   In the background is Frederic Gerard, the owner of the tavern
Lapin Agile (Sprightly Rabbit) and the painting's first owner. A
photograph from the period shows the painting hanging unframed in
the bar.
