   A painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir of a man
helping a woman up a wooded path was sold Monday night for $17.6
million, a record auction price for the artist, Sotheby's reported.
   The price paid by London dealers Baskett and Day for the 1870
painting titled ``La Promenade'' was the seventh highest at auction
for any work of art. The previous Renoir record was $8.8 million
for his painting of a woman nursing her child, sold at Sotheby's in
New York last May, the auction house said.
   Only three works by Vincent van Gogh, two by Pablo Picasso and
one by Claude Monet have brought more at auction than ``La
Promenade.''
   It and 24 other paintings, drawings and sculpture by
impressionist and modern artists were sold by the pension fund of
British Rail for a more than $64 million.
   A sale of 70 impressionist and modern works afterward brought
the total for the night to $117 million.
   The Sotheby's auction followed a two-day sale of similar works
by Christie's that realized $55.2 million.
