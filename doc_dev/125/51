   Sotheby's Holdings Inc. reported world-wide auction sales for the 1988-89 season rose 48% to a record $2.3 billion, while rival Christie's International PLC reported sales grew 56% to $1.78 billion. 

   The season for both London houses runs from September to August. 

   Sotheby's said robust art sales in the past year in Europe and the U.S. indicate the "sustained strength of the art market across virtually all levels." 

   Sotheby's season was capped by its record sale of Pablo Picasso's 1901 self-portrait "Yo Picasso," for $47.9 million, the second-highest price paid for any painting at auction. 
On May 9, Sotheby's impressionist and modern sale totaled $205 million, the highest mark reached in a single auction session. 

   Christie's called its season here "outstanding," adding that New York sales jumped 94% to $888 million from a year earlier. 
Among Christie's record sales were Pontormo's "Portrait of Cosimo I de'Medici," marked by a $35.2 million price, setting a world record for an old-master picture. 
Christie's also fetched a record $85 million total for the Goetz collection of 28 impressionist, modern and contemporary art works, the highest total for any single-owner sale.
