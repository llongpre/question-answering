   A European private collector paid more than $4
million for two paintings by Pablo Picasso and Edgar Degas in
London, Sotheby's said.
   The unidentified buyer on Tuesday night paid $2.36 million for
Picasso's 1953 oil painting ``Woman with Dog'' and $1.85 million
for ``Dancer in Mauve,'' a pastel Degas completed in about 1878.
   The Picasso painting of two distorted figures in strong colors
was a favorite of the artist which he kept to his death.
   A record price for a work by the German-American artist Lyonel
Feininger was paid by Japan's Fuji Gallery: $1.46 million for ``The
Cyclists.''
   It was painted in 1910 and was one of 54 early works which the
artist had to leave behind when, fearing Nazi persecution, he left
Germany for good in 1937. He sent for them but they never arrived
and were only recovered in 1984, 28 years after Feininger's death,
after negotiations the East Germany.
