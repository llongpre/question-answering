   A painting of two circus acrobats by Pablo Picasso
sold for 20.9 million pounds ($38.46 million) at auction Monday
night, becoming the most expensive 20th century work of art.
   The buyer was not immediately identified by Christie's auction
house, and the seller was an unidentified private owner.
   The 1905 painting from Picasso's Rose Period called ``Acrobat and
Young Harlequin'' was sold in 3{ minutes, with the bidding starting
at 5 million pounds ($9.2 million).
   The price topped the previous 20th century painting record, also
for a Picasso, set Nov. 14 when his ``Maternity'' sold in New York
for $24.75 million.
   After being shown in Paris in 1905, ``Acrobat and Young
Harlequin'' found its way into a German museum and was confiscated
by the Nazis in 1937 as an example of decadent art.
   They sold it at auction in Switzerland to a Belgian collector and
it had been in private hands since them.
   Christie's sale rooms were crowded for an auction of 69
Impressionist and modern works of art by 40 artists.
