   A painting by Henri Matisse was auctioned for
$12.4 million, a record for the artist, Sotheby's says.
   ``Woman with a Red Umbrella'' was sold to an anonymous buyer,
said Sotheby's spokesman Matthew Weigman.
   The Wednesday night sale of paintings and one Edgar Degas
sculpture was the first installment of the collection of the late
John T. Dorrance Jr., former chairman of Campbell Soup Co. and son
of its founder, Weigman said.
   The first installment alone set a record for a single owner's
collection at auction, bringing $116 million for 44 lots, he said.
   Records also were set for three other artists: Sir Edward Henry
Landseer, Theo van Rysselberghe and Edouard Vuillard, Weigman said.
   Other highlights of the sale included an American private
collector's purchase of Claude Monet ``Grainstacks'' for $8.5
million, and Japanese dealer Aska International's purchase of Pablo
Picasso's ``Au Moulin Rouge'' for $8.3 million and Vincent Van
Gogh's ``Man is at Sea'' for $7.2 million.
   The sale is to continue for the next three days, with 850 more
lots of paintings, furniture, silver and porcelain being offered.
