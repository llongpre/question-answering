The art world is gearing up for what may be the biggest New York auction season 
in history. Beginning next week with the sale of a world renowned Los 
Angeles-based collection of of African art and steaming on through May with 
auctions of multimillion-dollar Impressionist and American paintings, the 
six-week round of auctions is likely to total close to $1 billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
Art on the block ranges from classical Impressionist works by Pierre-Auguste 
Renoir and Claude Monet to Pop paintings by Roy Lichtenstein and photographs by 
Robert Mapplethorpe. Los Angeles will play an unusually prominent role in the 
spring auctions when collections of the late dealer Harry A. Franklin, actor 
Kirk Douglas, pop singer Graham Nash, television producer David Wolper and the 
late Taft and Rita Schreiber are offered for sale. 
</P>
<P>
Christie's is looking forward to its most profitable auction in history, a May 
15 sale of 81 Impressionist and modern works that are expected to total as much 
as $331.4 million. Sixty-two of the pieces are valued at more than $1 million 
each, and five are expected to bring more than $10 million each. 
</P>
<P>
Sotheby's is anticipating nearly as big a success the next night, with a sale 
of 71 Impressionist and modern works, valued at up to $303.5 million. Sixty-one 
are likely to top the $1-million mark, and three are expected to exceed $10 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Two highly revered Impressionist paintings -- Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of 
Dr. Gachet," depicting the physician who treated the troubled artist during the 
last year of his life, and Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette," a shimmering 
painting of an outdoor dance hall scene -- are expected to bring $40 million to 
$50 million apiece and possibly exceed the record $53.9 million paid in 1987 
for Van Gogh's "Irises," now in the collection of the J. Paul Getty Museum. 
</P>
<P>
The Van Gogh portrait, to be offered by Christie's, and the Renoir, from 
Sotheby's, will be the most closely watched sales of the season. But they are 
far from the only big-ticket items. 
</P>
<P>
Edouard Manet's intimate garden scene, "The Bench," for example, is estimated 
at $20 million to $25 million in Christie's May 15 sale. Thomas Eakins' "The 
Swimming Hole," an icon of American art from the Fort Worth Modern Art Museum's 
collection, is valued at $10 million to $15 million in a May 24 auction at 
Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
Major contemporary works are also lining up for spring auctions. In Christie's 
big contemporary sale on May 7, for example, 76 lots are valued at a total of 
$49 million to $71 million, the auction house's highest ever pre-sale estimate 
for contemporary art. Nineteen of the 76 works are likely to fetch more than $1 
million apiece; half of them are Abstract Expressionist paintings by Clyfford 
Still, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Sam Francis. Sotheby's contemporary 
sale on May 8 includes 88 lots, expected to total between $88 million and $115 
million. Fifteen pieces are valued at over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Among pricey contemporary pieces offered by the two auction houses, 
Lichtenstein's classic comic strip-style painting, "Kiss II," and Francis 
Bacon's Expressionistic "Study for Portrait" are each expected to bring between 
$5 million and $7 million. "Woman as Landscape," a 1954-55 Abstract 
Expressionist work by De Kooning, is valued at $9 million to $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
No one can predict the outcome of these glittering auctions. Some critics of 
the highly leveraged sale of "Irises" in 1987 to Australian industrialist Alan 
Bond say that it may be several years before another artwork commands a higher 
price. 
</P>
<P>
But confidence in the art market -- as well as dismay over escalating prices -- 
is widespread among dealers and collectors. While most of them say that buyers 
are becoming more selective and that the fast-rising prices for works by young 
art stars will level off, they expect top-quality pieces to climb even higher. 
Highlights of upcoming sales released so far by the auction houses indicate 
that there will be no shortage of quality for those who can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, the sales include consignments from collectors and museums all across 
the country, including Southern California, but Los Angeles has an unusually 
high profile this spring. Works from at least five important Los Angeles 
collections will go on the block in April and May. 
</P>
<P>
* The Harry A. Franklin Family Collection of African Art comes up first, on 
April 21 at Sotheby's. Billed as the biggest and best single-owner sale of 
African art since the 1966 auction of Helena Rubenstein's collection, the 
Franklin auction of 431 lots is expected to total between $3.8 million and $5.4 
million. The top lot is a Cameroon wood sculpture, called the "Bangwa Queen," 
which is valued at up to $1.8 million and may challenge the $2.08-million 
record for African art, set last July for a Benin bronze head. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin was a pioneering collector of African art who bought his first piece 
in 1938 and maintained a gallery in Beverly Hills until his death in 1983. His 
daughter, Valerie Franklin, who ran the gallery in later years and brought her 
scholarly expertise to the family business, decided to sell the collection so 
that she could launch a new career as a writer. 
</P>
<P>
* Rock singer Graham Nash's celebrated collection of photography will be sold 
on April 25 at Sotheby's, which calls the event "the most important 
single-owner sale of photography ever to come to auction." The sale of about 
475 photographs, including works by Ansel Adams, Diane Arbus, Walker Evans and 
Edward Weston, is expected to bring more than $2 million. Nash will donate half 
the profit to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art for the purchase of 
contemporary photography. The money gift will augment the singer's recent 
donation of 140 contemporary photographs to the museum. 
</P>
<P>
* Actor Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, will sell 52 pieces of Impressionist 
and modern art in Christie's auctions on May 4, 16, 22 and 30. Their collection 
of works by Georges Braque, Marc Chagall, Piet Mondrian and many other artists 
is expected to bring $7.5 million to $10.7 million. The couple plan to put half 
their profit into a family foundation and use the rest to collect contemporary 
art. 
</P>
<P>
* Christie's will sell 17 works from the estate of Taft and Rita Schreiber on 
May 7, 8, 15 and 16 for a projected total of $4.8 million to $7.1 million. The 
most valuable pieces are "Woman With Blue Jewel," a 1937 painting by Henri 
Matisse ($4 million to $6 million) and Henry Moore's bronze "Girl Seated" 
($500,000 to $700,000). The Schreibers bequeathed the bulk of their collection 
to the National Gallery in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 
the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art and the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art. Taft Schreiber was a top official with MCA Inc. His widow died last year. 
Their daughter, Lenore Greenberg, a MOCA board member, said that the items sent 
to auction are those that her parents didn't designate as gifts to museums or 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
* Producer David Wolper will sell seven modern artworks from his collection at 
Christie's auctions on May 1, 15 and 16 and in October. The group of sculptures 
and paintings by Pablo Picasso, Jacques Lipchitz and Joan Miro is expected to 
total between $4.4 million and $6.3 million. An active collector who routinely 
buys and sells, Wolper says he will use the profit from the upcoming auctions 
to purchase more art. 
</P>
<P>
Several other collections are scheduled for sale in May. An unusually rich 
cache of Italian Futurist art, collected by the late Lydia Winston Malbin, the 
eldest daughter of architect Albert Kahn, will be offered by Sotheby's on May 
16 and 17. The sale -- expected to total $57 million to $75 million -- will 
include Giacomo Balla's painting, "Injection of Futurism" ($3 million to $4 
million) and his sculpture, "Boccioni's Fist" ($2 million to $3 million). Among 
other modern works in the Malbin collection are Constantin Brancusi's 
sculpture, "The Blond Negress" ($8 million to $10 million) and Fernand Leger's 
1913 Cubist painting, "Woman in Armchair" ($10 million to $12 million). 
</P>
<P>
Christie's on May 15 will offer five paintings from the estate of Robert 
Lehman, a New York financier and patron of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for 
an estimated total of $40 million to $60 million. The works include a Van Gogh 
self-portrait ($20 million to $30 million) and an Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec 
portrait of a young woman, "Girl With Fur" ($10 million to $15 million). 
</P>
<P>
Paintings continue to command the art market's top prices, but photography will 
be in the spotlight late this month. Christie's will launch a four-day round of 
sales on April 23 with an auction of photographic masterworks, featuring 
vintage works that are expected to set records. Sotheby's will follow its April 
25 auction of the Graham Nash collection with a sale of 473 photographs. The 
auction will close with 36 works by Robert Mapplethorpe valued at up to $50,000 
apiece -- well above his record of $38,500 set only last November.

BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Pre-sale estimates for this spring's round of art auctions indicate that the 
art boom of the 1980s may be carrying over into the '90s. The art market took 
off in the '80s as thousands of new collectors began putting money into art and 
the Japanese spent vast sums on French Impressionist paintings. Skeptics feared 
a collapse after the stock market crash of October, 1987, but a month later 
Sotheby's sale of Vincent Van Gogh's "Irises" commanded $53.9 million, still 
the highest auction price ever paid for an artwork. The revelation that 
Sotheby's had loaned Australian entrepreneur Alan Bond half the purchase price 
led critics to charge that the market was artificially inflated and to predict 
a decline. Subsequent auctions haven't matched that price, but prices have held 
strong and continued to rise steadily in many areas. Sotheby's reported $2.9 
billion in sales for 1989, a 61% increase over 1988. Christie's totalled $2 
billion in sales in 1989, a 70% jump from the previous year. Both auction 
houses expect 1990 to be another record year, but some art market watchers say 
business might be hurt by this year's fall of the Japanese stock market and the 
continuing troubles in the junk bond market.
