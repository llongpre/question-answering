<P>
Vincent van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. Gachet" stunned the art market Tuesday when 
it was auctioned for $82.5 million, shattering the world record price for a 
painting by more than $28 million. 
</P>
<P>
The price was double the estimate by Christie's, a spokeswoman for the auction 
house said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is by far the world's most expensive painting," surpassing the previous 
auction record of $53.9 million bid by Australian businessman Alan Bond for Van 
Gogh's "Irises" in November, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The money for Bond's bid was largely borrowed from Sotheby's, the house that 
handled the auction. The debt-ridden Bond was eventually forced to sell the 
painting for an undisclosed price to the J. Paul Getty Museum of Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
The unidentified Japanese bidder was in the room during the about 10 minutes of 
bidding that opened at $20 million, Britman said. Toward the end of bidding, 
just two people were vying for the painting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Portrait of Dr. Gachet" was painted six weeks before Van Gogh committed 
suicide in 1890. Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet tended Van Gogh in the weeks before 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
The record price quashed all reports of an art market in recession after last 
week's disappointing contemporary sales. More than 35% of the works had gone 
unsold last week. 
</P>
<P>
The crowd gasped when the bidding reached $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
It had been expected to fetch between $40 million and $50 million at a sale of 
major works by Impressionist and Modern artists. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great painting," said Manhattan art dealer Richard Feigen. "It's by a 
rare artist. It's in fine condition. There are practically no paintings like it 
in private hands." 
</P>
<P>
After the bidding, which was tensely conducted between the Japanese dealer and 
a telephone bidder, the jam-packed gallery broke into a standing ovation, 
prompting auctioneer Christopher Burge to pound his gavel to control the house. 
</P>
<P>
The painting was lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1984. It is from the 
collection of Siegfried Kramarsky, a German-born New York banker who died in 
1961. It was put on the block by a trust created under his will. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to artist Paul Gauguin, Van Gogh wrote on June 16 that he had 
painted Gachet "with the heart-broken expression of our time" and that it was 
"not destined to be understood." 
</P>
<P>
Gachet, a practitioner of homeopathic medicine, was Van Gogh's friend and 
physician. He was also close to other Impressionist painters of the time. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh painted a second, slightly larger version of the portrait, which hangs 
in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It lacks the details of the Kramarsky painting 
and its colors are flatter. 
</P>
<P>
Another Van Gogh from the Kramarsky collection was auctioned in 1987 for $20.24 
million. It too had been lent to the Metropolitan. 
</P>
