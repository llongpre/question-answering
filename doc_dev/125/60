   While Pablo Picasso never visited the United
States, the U.S. government kept an extensive secret dossier on him
for 27 years because it considered him a possible subversive, The
New York Times reported in its Sunday editions.
   Both the FBI and the State Department kept track of the
Spanish-born artist, monitoring what he wrote, said and signed, his
whereabouts and his affiliations, the Times reported.
   The newspaper said the FBI still maintains a Picasso file,
although the artist died 17 years ago at the age of 91. Picasso
spent most of his life in France.
   The documents show that U.S. officials worried about the effect
Picasso, who joined the French Communist Party in 1944, might have
on public opinion in the United States, the newspaper said.
   The article was written by author Herbert Mitgang, whose 1989
book, ``Dangerous Dossiers,'' examined the FBI's practice of
maintaining files on leading writers residing in the United States,
including Nobel laureates Sinclair Lewis, Ernest Hemingway, William
Faulkner and John Steinbeck.
   Mitgang said he obtained the Picasso files 2{ years after
requesting them under the Freedom of Information Act. He said some
pages in the files were withheld and others had paragraphs blacked
out.
   The FBI labeled Picasso as a ``Security Matter - C'' (for
Communist) and as a possible ``Subversive,'' the newspaper said.
   It said FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover initially took notice of
Picasso when the artist wrote a statement in 1944 titled ``Why I
became a Communist,'' in which he wrote, ``My joining the Communist
Party is a logical step in my life, my work and gives them
meaning.''
   Additions to the Picasso file grew smaller in the 1960s, but his
name appeared in FBI references up to 1971, the newspaper said.
   Mitgang said that to find out more about Picasso's politics, he
spoke to a friend of the artist, Dominique Desanti, who was active
in the French Resistance.
   Mrs. Desanti, who teaches at New York University, told Mitgang
that Picasso was ``a Communist but not a party-line Communist. He
never attended his cell meetings in Vallauris, the little town (in
France) where he lived - if there was a meeting, they came to
him.''
   ``Had he known the FBI was watching him, he would have laughed
his head off,'' Mrs. Desanti said. ``He might have put on a mask
maker's red nose and made jokes about it. No doubt he would think
such an absurd thing was surrealistic.''
