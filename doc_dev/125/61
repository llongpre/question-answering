<HEAD>Mitterrand Gives Two Picasso Paintings to Spanish Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Francois Mitterrand on Tuesday gave two
paintings by Spanish-born artist Pablo Picasso to President Felipe
Gonzalez of Spain.
   ``This gesture affirms one more time the links of friendship
between our two peoples,'' Mitterrand said.
   The two works, ``The Rooftops of Barcelona'' painted in 1903,
and ``Homage to Spaniards Killed For France,'' finished in 1947,
made up part of the artist's personal collection.
   Picasso, who died in 1973 at age 91, spent most of his life in
France. But he asked his heirs to return the two paintings to his
native country.
   The donation was worked out between Picasso's estate and the
French government to circumvent strict laws forbidding the export
of art works from France.
   ``The Rooftops of Barcelona,'' from the artist's celebrated blue
period, will go on display at the Picasso Museum in Barcelona. The
other painting goes to the Prado in Madrid.
   The donation came at a summit meeting between the two leaders on
their policies on European unity and the Persian Gulf crisis.
