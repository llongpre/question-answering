   Sotheby's, the international auction house,
reported a 27.5 percent increase in auction sales during 1988,
highlighted by the sale of collections belonging to Elton John and
Andy Warhol and paintings by Pablo Picasso and Jasper Johns.
   Worldwide sales totaled $1.814 billion in 1988, compared with
$1.423 billion last year and more than triple the 1984 figure of
$586 million, said a statement released Monday by the 244-year-old
auction house.
   The statement quoted Michael Ainslie, president and chief
executive officer of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., as saying that while
``extraordinary prices'' were being reached at the top end of the
market, the middle and low ranges also were doing well, with about
190,000 lots valued at under 10,000 dollars sold in 1988.
   The statement did not mention Sotheby's annual profit.
   Sotheby's noted the art collection belonging to Warhol, the late
American pop artist, sold for around $25.3 million, and British
singer Elton John's sold for $8.7 million.
   ``False Start'' by Johns, the American artist, fetched $17.05
million, a record for a work by a living artist and for any
contemporary work sold at auction, the Sotheby's statement said.
Picasso's ``La Cage d'Oiseaux'' went for $15.4 million, it said.
   Other notable sales were the original manuscript of Franz Kafka's
novel ``The Trial,'' which brought nearly $2 million, four times the
previous record for a modern literary manuscript, it said.
   A console table made for Marie Antoinette sold for nearly $3
million, and a Cycladic marble head of a goddess fetched $2.09
million, a record for a classical antiquity.
   The typescript of Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast of ``The War
of the Worlds'' was sold for $143,000 and the piano that featured in
the Paris scene from the movie ``Casablanca'' went for $154,000, it
said.
   Sotheby's also said that in 1988 it staged the first
international auction in the United States and was the first Western
auction house to hold a sale in China.
