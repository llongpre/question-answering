<HEAD>Japanese Pay Auction Record for A Chagall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unidentified Japanese bidding by telephone paid
an auction record price of $6.09 million for a work by artist Marc
Chagall.
   The 1949 painting by the Russian-born artist, ``The Bride under
the Canopy,'' was the highest-priced work in Tuesday night's sale
at Sothebys of impressionist and modern art.
   Chagall painted ``The Bride Under the Canopy'' after he returned
to France from the United States.
   It shows a bride and groom under an awning, with a large vase of
leaves and flowers and a violinist, one of Chagall's ``lucky
charms.''
   Another Chagall of a vase of flowers with Russian people and
motifs around the edges, ``The Farmers' Bouquet,'' went for $5.02
million. The buyer also was a Japanese telephone bidder.
   Sotheby's did not say if the two Chagalls went to the same buyer.
   Anonymous Japanese also paid $3.5 million for a 1933 work by
Paul Klee, ``Arrival of the Bridegroom,'' and the same price for a
Pablo Picasso 1904 blue portrait of the Catalan poet Jaime Sabartes.
   Sabartes became Picasso's secretary, and he wrote a biography of
the artist in 1946. He also collaborated with Wilhelm Boeck on a
comprehensive study of Picasso's art published in New York in 1955.
