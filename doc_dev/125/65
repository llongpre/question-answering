   The private art collection of the late Campbell
Soup Co. chairman drew $131 million at auction _ the highest total
for a single owner's collection, Sotheby's said Saturday.
   The collection of John T. Dorrance Jr. was sold over four
sessions this week and included paintings by Pablo Picasso, Claude
Monet, Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Cezanne as well as garden statues,
French furniture and assorted porcelain, said Diana Brooks,
president of Sotheby's, North America.
   Brooks said the Dorrance collection ``possessed strong sense of
character which appealed to a wide spectrum of collectors.''
   At the first session Wednesday, ``Woman With a Red Umbrella,''
by Henri Matisse drew $12.4 million _ a record for the artist. That
first session itself eclipsed the previous record for a single
owner auction.
   The previous record for a single owner collection was set last
year when the collection of William Goetz, a Hollywood executive,
sold for $85 million.
