An anonymous American collector has paid $7.39 million at auction for an early 
cubist painting by Pablo Picasso, "Woman Sitting in an Armchair," Christie's 
London auction house said. The painting, which Picasso started in 1917 and 
completed in 1920, is thought to be modeled on Olga Kokhlova, daughter of a 
Russian general and a dancer whom Picasso met in Rome and married in 1918, 
Christie's said. It was bought by an American collector bidding by telephone 
who wished to remain anonymous. Another Picasso work, "Woman's Head," painted 
in 1921 in the artist's neo-classical style, sold for $5.91 million. A work by 
Paul Klee, "Uplift and Way," painted in 1932, fetched $5.17 million and a work 
by Max Ernst, "Gray Forest," painted in 1927, sold for $1.33 million. ALEENE
