<LEADPARA>  Publisher and philanthropist Walter Annenberg said Monday that he would
bequeath $1 billion worth of paintings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York.;    The gift, which will be the largest single donation in more than
half a century to the museum's department of French impressionist and
post-impressionist paintings, includes Annenberg's entire collection of more
than 50 paintings by Manet, Degas, Monet, Renoir, Toulouse-Lautrec, Cezanne,
van Gogh, Seurat, Gauguin, Bonnard, Vuillard, Matisse, Picasso and Braque.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Among the works included in the gift are Cezanne's "Mont Ste. Victoire,"
Gauguin's "Siesta," van Gogh's "Berceuse," Picasso's "Lapin Agile" and
Renoir's "Daughters of Catulle Mendes.";    The paintings will go to the Met
after the death of Annenberg, who will be 83 Wednesday.;    Annenberg's
decision leaves the Met the clear winner in an informal competition among
several of the nation's leading museums for his collection, which has been on
a national tour that has included stops at many of the institutions that had
hoped to win the collection permanently.;    By coincidence, the tour had been
planned to conclude at the Met, where the paintings temporarily will go on
view from June 4 through Oct. 13.;    "It is my intention," Annenberg said
Monday in a telephone interview, "that all my paintings should go to the
Metropolitan Museum. I love them with a passion, and I want them to stay
together after I'm gone.";    At one time, there was widespread speculation
that a private museum might be set up for the collection on the Annenberg
estate in Palm Springs.;    Last year, when he was approached by
representatives of a Japanese organization offering $1 billion for the
collection, Annenberg recalled Monday, he told them, "I appreciate your offer,
but you are asking me to sell members of my family.";    Asked about the
effect of the intended gift on the museum's collections, Met director Philippe
de Montebello said Monday night: "In one splendid generous gesture, Walter
Annenberg has given a whole new dimension to one of the Met's greatest
existing strengths. This is no mean feat, and we are all of us awed by the
seemingly inexhaustible public spirit behind this gift.";    Annenberg made
his fortune in publishing and communications. He was the founder of Seventeen
magazine in 1944 and went on to build a sprawling empire based on Triangle
Publications, a family holding company established by his father, Moses
Annenberg.;    Annenberg acquired radio and television stations in
Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut and California. But his most successful
venture was TV Guide, which he founded in 1953 and which grew to sell 17
million copies an issue.;    He sold the company in 1988 to Rupert Murdoch's
News Corp. for $3 billion.;    Annenberg and his wife, Leonore, a White House
chief of protocol at the outset of President Ronald Reagan's first term, have
been prominent patrons of the arts and collectors for many years, and their
homes are decorated with many of their works.;    When President Richard M.
Nixon sent Annenberg to London as his ambassador in 1969, the new envoy not
only refurbished the U.S. Embassy extensively at his own expense, but
paintings from the Annenbergs' collection came to grace its walls.; THE BIG
