   The rip-roaring bull market for art continued at Sotheby's last night where 54 works of art sold for $94.4 million. 

   This was the second highest total ever for an art auction. 
The record is $110 million, set at Sotheby's in November. 
But that sale included Vincent van Gogh's "Irises," which sold for $53.9 million. 

   After the sale, dealers left shaking their heads. 
New York dealer Klaus Perls said, "I don't know what's going on. 
It's wild. 
It's beyond me." 

   Chicago dealer Richard Gray said, "I think a lot of fresh money is coming into the art market from the stock market. 
The stock market is dead. 
I find this a little frightening." 

   The record price last night was $10.1 million for a bronze sculpture of a ballerina by Edgar Degas. 
The price wasn't only a record for the artist but far exceeded the most ever paid for a sculpture at auction. 
The same sculpture last sold in 1971 for $380,000. 

   Only three items failed to sell, including a pale, uncharacteristic oil by van Gogh. 

   The international crowd set records for nine artists. 
A Paul Cezanne painting sold for $9.2 million. 

   Among the successful bidders was tennis star John McEnroe who bought a tiny Picasso for $209,000. 

   Sotheby's is a unit of London-based Sotheby's Holdings Inc.
