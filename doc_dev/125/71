   A drawing found behind the wall of an Oklahoma
closet is being auctioned as the work of Pablo Picasso, but art
experts and the woman it supposedly portrays say they doubt its
authenticity.
   The owner of the pen-and-brush piece, jewelry engraver Jim
Montgomery of Norman, Okla., said Friday he had the work checked
out by a forensic document examiner in Oklahoma.
   It is up for sale at a weekend auction here by Kruse
International, an Auburn, Ind., auction house that specializes in
the sale of vintage cars. Kruse art director Jeff Doner said he
hopes for bids as high as $3 million to $5 million.
   Picasso's former mistress, the subject of the drawing, doubts it
is an authentic Picasso, and one expert said even if authentic it
would be worth no more than $250,000.
   Montgomery said he was given the work by a young couple he had
helped financially. The couple found the drawing of a young woman
about 11 years ago, tucked between two walls in the back of a
closet in an apartment they were renovating in Norman, he said.
   Recently, a friend suggested the drawing might be a Picasso, and
Montgomery decided to find out.
   ``It started out being a lot of fun and turned out to be a
tremendous amount of work,'' said Montgomery. ``But I had to know.''
   Montgomery had a scientific analysis done by Ernest Smith, a
forensic document examiner from Oklahoma City. He verified that the
ink of the signature was the same as that of the drawing, and
matched the signature with real Picasso signatures, among other
things.
   Montgomery acknowledged the drawing _ ``Portrait of a Young
Girl,'' isn't listed in Zervos, an extensive catalogue of Picasso
works.
   The drawing is said to be of Francoise Gilot, the mother of
Picasso's two grown children, Claude and Paloma. The late painter
used Ms. Gilot as a model from 1944 to 1953, when they lived
together.
   But the purported model doubts its authenticity.
   ``If they would want to know if it's correct, they would ask my
son or myself or my daughter,'' Ms. Gilot said in a telephone
interview from New York.
   ``The fact that they didn't ask anybody in the family is not a
good sign,'' said Ms. Gilot, a painter in her own right now married
to Jonas Salk, the developer of a polio vaccine.
   Art experts said Friday that scientific analysis is generally
only part of the verification process.
   A check of the Zervos catalogue ought to be the first step in
checking out such a work, said Virgilia Pancoast, of the
International Foundation for Art Research, in a telephone interview
from New York.
   ``The thing we would do beyond that ... the most crucial thing,
would be to go to a Picasso expert for an opinion,'' said Pancoast,
director of the authentication service for the non-profit
organization.
   ``It would seem reasonable to me that anyone attempting to sell
a work for that price would have the documentation to back it up.''
   John Richardson, a friend of Picasso who is writing a biography
of the late artist, also said an expert on the artist should have
been consulted.
   ``It's no good going to a forensic expert in Oklahoma City,'' he
said from New York. ``You have to go to a Picasso expert. They must
be desperate if they go to such a strange source for an opinion.''
   But both Richardson and Pancoast said the drawing could be
genuine.
   Even if authentic, the piece would be unlikely to reach seven
figures, Richardson said.
   ``A very high price would be $250,000,'' he said.
