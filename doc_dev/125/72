   The Picasso Museum, home for the past three years to
nearly 3,500 works by Pablo Picasso, is closing to the public for
two months for repairs, a museum spokesman said.
   The refurbished 17th century mansion, known as the Hotel Sale
after one of its former owners, opened as a museum in 1985 with the
world's largest collection of works by the Spanish master who died
in 1973.
   The 203 paintings, 158 sculptures and 3,000 drawings were taken
by the French government from Picasso's heirs in lieu of death
taxes, along with works by Matisse, Cezanne, Braque and Renoir in
the artist's private collection.
   A spokesman said Wednesday that the repairs involved replacing
the building's stone floors, which had proven ``too porous and
fragile,'' to handle traffic from some 40,000 visitors monthly.
   The museum closes Saturday and reopens March 1.
