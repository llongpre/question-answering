   Bidders at an art auction here on Saturday panned
a pen-and-brush piece purported to be drawn by Pablo Picasso, but
two people expressed interest in buying the work privately, said an
auction spokesman.
   Officials at Kruse International, an Auburn, Ind., auction house
specializing in the sale of vintage cars, said last week that they
expected to fetch bids as high as $3 million to $5 million for the
previously unknown portrayal allegedly by Picasso of his mistress.
   ``The piece went up on the block this morning,'' said Pat
Scanlon, a spokesman for Kruse. ``There were no bids. It is now
being offered for private sale.''
   The owner of the drawing, jewelry engraver Jim Montgomery of
Norman, Okla., said he was given the work 11 years ago by a young
couple he had helped out financially.
   Montgomery said the work's authenticity was verified
scientifically by Ernest Smith, a forensic document examiner from
Oklahoma City, but art experts said the verification process needed
to be much more detailed.
   ``I suppose all the media attention could have scared away
bidders,'' Scanlon said in a telephone interview. The weather,
hovering around 5 degrees as the auction was held at a downtown
hotel, could also have been a factor.
   The portrait of a young woman probably will be sold privately to
one of two people who expressed interest after the auction, Scanlon
said. He refused to comment further on a possible sale price.
   Doubts about the piece's authenticity persist.
   Francoise Gilot, whom the piece is supposed to portray, said
Friday that she was skeptical the work was real because she was
never contacted about it.
   Ms. Gilot, the mother of Picasso's son Claude and daughter
Paloma, modeled for Picasso from 1944 to 1953 when they lived
together.
   ``If they want to know if it's correct, they would ask my son or
myself or my daughter,'' said Ms. Gilot, herself a painter now
married to Dr. Jonas Salk, a medical pioneer in polio.
   ``The fact that they did not ask anybody in the family is not a
good sign,'' she said in a telephone interview from New York.
   But Montgomery defended his decision to verify the work through
a document expert rather than art historians, saying he had heard
the process has been used in the past to verify such pieces. After
months of waiting for the appraisal, he said, he was satisfied that
the work was indeed a Picasso.
