   A portrait of Jacqueline Picasso, whose dark beauty
and intense gaze fascinated Spanish artist Pablo Picasso for nearly
30 years, enchanted Barbara Bush during a tour Tuesday of recently
acquired masterpieces.
   Mrs. Bush was accompanied by Michele Rocard, wife of French
Premier Michel Rocard, and several other wives of government
leaders attending the 34-nation Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   The ladies were divided into four groups for their 45-tour of
the Grand Palais, where more than 400 paintings, lithographs,
drawings, sketch books, sculpture and ceramics are on public
display until Jan. 14.
   ``Jacqueline Aux Mains Croisees'' (Jacqueline With Crossed
Hands), executed in 1954 in the early days of her relationship with
the artist, shows the young dancer sitting on the floor, her hands
hugging her knees.
   The works, which once belonged to Jacqueline, Picasso's second
wife, were donated to the government by her daughter, Catherine, in
partial payment of inheritance taxes. Jacqueline Picasso committed
suicide in 1986, never having recovered from her husband's death.
   Wearing an elegant, bright red dress adorned with waist-high
gold buttons and a flared, pleated skirt designed by Arnold Scaasi,
Mrs. Bush listened attentively to explanations provided by Gerard
Regnier, the head curator of the Picasso Museum.
   ``Is she crying?'' Mrs. Bush asked, looking closely at the
painting.
   ``She's beautiful, with that look of an Egyptian sphinx. I think
she's my favorite,'' she said.
   The portrait is the highlight of the exhibition, the first
portrait of Jacqueline - Picasso painted more than 70 during their
29 years together - to enter France's national collections.
   Asked how she liked Picasso's view of women, Mrs. Bush just
raised her eyebrows.
   The American first lady was also fascinated by the dozens of
sketch books displayed in glass cases under dim light. Picasso's
hands were never idle, and he would draw in accounting books, on
newspaper, cardboard - even tablecloths and napkins.
   ``I can't imagine he kept them all. I wanted to go through them
page by page,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   Raisa Gorbachev, dressed in a mustard suit with black buttons
and black sweater, did not visit the exhibition. She joined the
group for lunch at the Hotel Matignon, the official residence of
the French premier.
   The guests dined on lobster stew in sea urchin sauce, filet of
beef, cheese, fruit and sherbet, washed down with two vintage
wines.
   Mrs. Bush ended the afternoon with a visit to the famed Pasteur
Institute, named for the French scientist Louis Pasteur and now a
respected AIDS research center.
   Mrs. Bush, accompanied by Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the
French president, was not allowed inside the research labs that
contain the deadly virus.
  ``We didn't get within spitting distance,'' she said.
