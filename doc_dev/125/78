   Art collector Paul Mellon and the Yale Center
for British Art said Tuesday they plan to sell 42 masterworks
valued at more than $100 million, including Van Goghs and Picassos,
to fund future purchases.
   Fifteen major Impressionist and Modern works will go on the
block Nov. 14 in New York, Mellon said in a statement issued by
Christie's auction house.
   They include Edouard Manet's ``Rue Mosnier, Paris,'' Vincent van
Gogh's ``The Tree, Arles'' and ``A Ploughman in the Fields Near
Arles,'' and Pablo Picasso's ``The Death of Harlequin'' and ``Self
Portrait, Barcelona.'' The sale also includes an Edgar Degas bronze
and three Degas wax sculptures of ballet dancers.
   On Nov. 17, Christie's in London will offer nine works owned by
Mellon and 18 that he donated to the Yale Center for British Art.
   The selections range from the 1589 British School portrait of
``An Unknown Man, Aged 29,'' to the modern portrait of ``The Sixth
Earl of Winterton'' by Sir Alfred J. Munnings.
   ``By selling a small number of individual works by artists who
are already well represented at the center, we plan to establish an
acquisitions fund which will enrich and expand this important
educational resource,'' said Duncan Robinson, Yale Center director.
   Mellon has given the center more than 1,200 paintings, 20,000
prints and drawings, and 20,000 books since 1977.
   Mellon is a founding benefactor of the National Gallery of Art
in Washington, D.C., which was established by his father, Andrew W.
Mellon, and has given it more than 700 important works. He also has
donated about 1,500 works to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in
Richmond.
   ``I will continue to maintain and possibly enhance my
collection, which is a constant source of satisfaction to me and my
wife, Bunny, whose appreciative eye helped shape the Impressionist
and Modern collection,'' said Mellon. ``Naturally, cultural
institutions in which I am interested can be assured of my
continued support.''
