   The bull market for impressionist art suffered a minor correction at Sotheby's Friday night, when 29% of the works up for auction didn't sell. 

   Several dealers opined that over-eager sellers had set their minimum prices too high for less-than-masterpieces. 

   The 56 works sold brought a total of $79.5 million, including the 10% buyer's commission. 
That figure was below Sotheby's estimates as well as totals for the auction house's last two impressionist auctions here. 
A year ago, Sotheby's sold $110.2 million of impressionist art in one evening -- including the $53.9 million "Irises" by Vincent van Gogh. 
In May, the impressionist sale brought $94.4 million. 

   "There's an awful lot of material like this coming up at auction in the next several weeks in New York and London," said David Nash, head of Sotheby's fine arts division. 
"In certain areas, supply has evened out with demand." 

   But Mr. Nash also said that while some works by Degas, Matisse, Monet, Picasso and others didn't sell, prices for others increased enormously over a short period. 
The highest price for the night was $8.5 million for a portrait of a woman washing her feet by Pierre-August Renoir; the painting sold three years ago at auction for only $1.9 million, said Mr. Nash. 

   Dealers leaving the auction expressed disappointment that the quality of the art for sale wasn't higher, and that minimum prices weren't set lower. 
"Even in this overheated market, you can't get big prices for mediocre pictures," said Richard Gray, a Chicago dealer. 

   Surprisingly, the Japanese weren't heavy buyers, as they have been at impressionist sales in recent years. 
European collectors and dealers dominated, followed by Americans. 

   The biggest shock of the evening was the unprecedented fact that none of the impressionist works topped the record price paid for contemporary art last week: On Thursday night, a painting by Jasper Johns sold for $17.1 million. 
Mr. Nash said the appetite for impressionist art "is still enormous" but that, "There is a shift toward contemporary art because people feel you can buy higher quality contemporary art than you can buy impressionist." 

   Sotheby's is a unit of Sotheby's Holdings Inc., London.
