   A much-mocked investment in art by the pension fund
of Britain's state rail network is expected to make many millions
this spring with the sale of 25 paintings and drawings by
impressionist and modern masters.
   The works by 14 artists such as Paul Cezanne, Pierre-Auguste
Renoir and Claude Monet were bought between 1974 and 1979 for about
$7 million.
   They are expected to make up to $43 million in London April 4.
   The auctioneers of Sotheby's, handling the sale for the British
Rail Pension Fund, are sending the pictures on tour to Paris Feb.
21-22, New York Feb. 27-March 1, Los Angeles March 3-6 and Tokyo
March 10-15.
   ``This is the first big collection of pictures we shall sell this
year, and the prices will indicate the state of the market for the
world's most popular paintings,'' Michel Strauss, the firm's expert
on the period, said in an interview Friday.
   He said the top price could be $7 million to $9 million for
Renoir's ``La Promenade,'' a straw-hatted man helping a woman in a
white dress up a woodland path. It cost $1.2 million in 1976.
   A 1905 blue-period work of Pablo Picasso, ``Young Man in Blue,''
bought privately for an undisclosed sum, could bring up to $7
million.
   There is also an 1888 ink drawing of cottages by Vincent van
Gogh, and portraits of Cezanne by Renoir and Camille Pissarro.
   Strauss said he recommended the pictures to the fund originally
as good investments.
   From the time the program began in 1974 to the time it stopped in
1982, the fund was criticized by financial commentators for going
outside its field of expertise and being advised by Sotheby's on
buying 2,700 works of art _ paintings, antiquities, furniture,
silver, porcelain, books and manuscripts _ for about $9 million.
   That was 1 percent of the value of all its investments for
British Rail pensions at that time.
   The fund exhibited many of the art works in museums. It has sold
1,000 of them for $27 million.
   Strauss said the return on the fund's art investments has been
the same as for real estate, higher than government bonds and lower
than stocks.
   Strauss, 52, who has spent 27 years at Sotheby's, said 10 percent
of the buyers of impressionists and modern artists in London and New
York are American, 25 percent are Japanese and 65 percent are
European or Europe-based.
   ``What's different about this sale is that the pictures belong to
a single institution and are stamped with one person's taste: mine.
I chose them and I still love them,'' Strauss said.
