<LEADPARA>  PALOMA Picasso, born 49 years ago to Pablo Picasso and Francoise Gilot, has
spent the better part of her life trying to be someone other than the artist's
daughter.;   She took several venues, but they all led back to a famous name
and creative genes. So in the past decade Paloma Picasso has moved to center
stage in the field of design.  </LEADPARA>

PALOMA PICASSO EMBRACES THE ART OF DESIGN  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     For kitchen, bed, bath;   New this fall are sterling and silver-plate
flatware for Villeroy &amp; Boch and bed and bath linens for Martex. Coming in a
year or so for Motif Designs will be wall coverings and fabrics.;   If all
this seems removed from what her father did, it's intentional.;   "I want to
make sure I am not doing art," Picasso says. "My father made works of art. I
make things to live with.";   Paloma Picasso's home furnishings products,
which also include china, had an inauspicious start 20 years ago with table
linens for an Italian company. But her latest designs play off of her first
love: jewelry for Tiffany &amp; Co. and accessories for department and specialty
stores.;   Bobbles and lace;   Beads and gold chains and lace are features of
her three new bedding designs. A china pattern for Villeroy &amp; Boch is bordered
in what resembles a fabric ruffle -- the optical illusion heightened by
shading and a gold outline.;   One flatware pattern suggests a fold of fabric
and a tassel. Another takes the familiar teardrop shape of a pearl earring.
Sterling silver coffee and tea service have bracelet-like handles and knobs
shaped like set pearls.;   The language of fine jewelry comes naturally to
Picasso, whose work with jewelry was the first step back into a world of
design she purposely left in her teens.;   "As a child I drew all the time,"
Picasso said in an interview in her New York office. "But I stopped drawing
when I reached adolescence. I thought about becoming an architect, but
considering the name of my father, I decided that doing anything in the arts
would be very dangerous for me.";   She distanced herself from the French art
world by enrolling in an English literature course at the University of
Nanterre. She soon left school and drifted into the theater. Asked to find
jewelry for a costume, she made it instead, from finds at a Paris flea
market.;   Paris Match magazine reported that Paloma Picasso had done the
jewelry, and soon she was designing for Yves St. Laurent.;   Talked to
Tiffany;   During her first trip to the United States in 1968, she talked to
Tiffany &amp; Co. about designing jewelry, but negotiations stagnated, so her
first outlet was Henri Bendel, a trendy New York clothing store. Tiffany and
the French designer finally connected in 1981.;   Picasso launched a perfume
in 1984, and she joined Villeroy &amp; Boch with china in 1988.;   Picasso
products are upscale. The seven china patterns range from $225 to $300 per
place setting. That compares with $140 to $175 for other patterns, according
to Safford Sweatt, president of the U.S. subsidiary of Villeroy &amp; Boch. Martex
quotes retail prices for bed and bath products from $40 for a pair of
pillowcases to $250 for a queen-size comforter.;   Her products reflect one
persona, her home another. For instance, in the New York apartment she shares
with her husband and business partner, Rafael Lopez Sanchez, Picasso says she
mixes the valuable -- her father's paintings being one -- with flea-market
finds she has collected from around the world.;   Her New York office reveals
a strong design sense. It is furnished with a plush purple carpet, ruby velvet
divan, black lacquer furniture and two sets of shimmering silk curtains in
gold and a blue shading to pink. A crushed velvet shawl of her design, in rich
shades of gold through black, is tossed casually across the divan.;   A keen
sense of design and a famous name aren't enough to make a licensing business
work.;   "Drawing is one step," she says, "but design is more of a
partnership. A great deal happens at the factory when I listen to the point of
view of others."  </TEXT>
