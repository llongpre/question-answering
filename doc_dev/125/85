   Unless the United States reverses its
decision to deny Yasser Arafat an entry visa, the U.N. debate on
Palestine will shift to Geneva so the PLO chairman can address the
General Assembly, diplomats said.
   Arab representatives planned to introduce a resolution today in
the United Nations that deplores the U.S. action, postpones debate
on Palestine now scheduled for Thursday until at least next month,
and urges the State Department to grant the visa.
   Saturday's decision by Secretary of State George P. Shultz to bar
Arafat from the country on grounds he was an ``accessory'' to acts
of terrorism against Americans has been widely criticized by dozens
of countries, including the Arab world and such staunch U.S. allies
as Britain, Canada and Australia.
   Only Israel backed the U.S. decision.

   The next Senate's Democratic majority gathered
today to choose a leader from among three politically different men
seeking to guide the chamber through its coming skirmishes with a
Republican White House.
   Sens. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii, Bennett Johnston of Louisiana and
George Mitchell of Maine were lobbying hard to succeed Robert C.
Byrd, D-W.Va., who is retiring as majority leader. Many of their
colleagues said they had met or spoken to all three at least once on
Monday.
   All three camps were voicing optimism, though lawmakers said the
outcome still was uncertain on the eve of the vote. Each of the
contestants was continually polling the 55-member Democratic
majority, but the answers received might be more positive than the
results in today's secret ballot.
   ``It's a very painful thing to work as closely as you do ... and
say to somebody that you have a lot of respect for them but I've
decided to vote the other way,'' said Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C.,
who has publicly endorsed Mitchell.

   Consumers may cut back on big-tag Christmas
presents now that the nation's biggest banks boosted their prime
lending rates to 10.5 percent, the highest level in 3{ years, some
analysts said.
   The increases in the key lending rate by a half percentage point
were announced Monday and were the fourth this year.
   Many economists have been predicting a prime rate hike in recent
weeks because interest rates in the bond markets have been rising
due to inflation speculation and the dollar's weakness in foreign
exchange.
   ``It comes as no surprise. In fact, they (banks) seem to have
held back longer than I expected,'' said Edward Yardeni, chief
economist for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.

   Tornado-shocked victims tried to put their
shattered lives and homes back in order today from a series of
twisters that killed four people, including a couple found with
their arms wrapped around each other.
   At least 17 tornado touch downs were reported early Monday,
covering 200 miles of eastern North Carolina, injuring 151 people
and causing more than $50 million in damage.
   One tornado sent one couple on a flying-mattress ride. Mark and
Vera Cimerro landed on their mattress against a tree across the
street.
   ``I held onto her as tight as I could, and the next thing I know,
we are flying,'' said Cimerro. ``It was like a ride at the fair.''

   George Bush is promising to work with former
rival Bob Dole on forging an early budget accord but says ``we're
not naive'' about the ease of reaching accommodation with
majority-party Democrats in the Senate.
   The president-elect was meeting with Senate Republicans today at
a breakfast in the Capitol after a private lunch Monday with the
Senate minority leader.
   Bush also said he's getting ready to name some new people to his
Cabinet after making a string of holdover appointments, including
Monday's announcement that Marlin Fitzwater would stay on as chief
White House spokesman.
   After Monday's lunch with Dole, also attended by Bush's choice
for budget director, Richard G. Darman, the vice president told
reporters: ``We're going to address the budget deficit early on.''

   A hush-hush countdown continued today
with the space shuttle Atlantis and its five-man crew facing an
unfavorable weather forecast for Thursday's scheduled liftoff for a
secret military mission.
   A 21-member team of launch managers and engineers today was to
take over key decisions leading to the launch, and the preliminary
forecast indicated high winds and clouds.
   Also scheduled today were jet training flights for the five
military astronauts assigned to the mission, equipment checks and
operations reviews.
   The decision-making group is headed by former astronaut Robert
Crippen, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's deputy
director for shuttle operations, who has sole authority to approve
or stop a launch.

   Security forces increased patrols in the
occupied territories today to prevent violence on the 41st
anniversary of a U.N. resolution calling for creation of the Jewish
state.
   Leaders of extremist Palestinian factions called for a general
strike to mark the anniversary, but the mainstream underground
leadership of the Palestinian uprising told followers to ignore the
call.
   In Bethlehem, where Christ was born, Palestinian officials
canceled Christmas celebrations in solidarity with the year-long
revolt against Israeli occupation.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc asked the
Labor Party on Monday to join a new coalition government, offering
the rival party two of the four most powerful Cabinet posts.

   One of the nation's top psychiatrists resigned from
Harvard Medical School's faculty after a student at another school
recognized plagiarized passages in the professor's writings dating
back 22 years.
   Dr. Shervert Frazier, 67, former director of the National
Institute of Mental Health, resigned last week as a Harvard
professor and head of McLean Hospital, a psychiatric hospital
affiliated with the university.
   Frazier did not dispute the findings of a faculty committee that
investigated the allegations, but said the plagiarism was
inadvertent, according to Dr. S. James Adelstein, dean of academic
programs at the medical school.
   ``He has accepted the evidence of the committee,'' Adelstein
said. ``But he has ascribed the events to his method of note-taking
and composing papers.''

   A Japanese department store said today that it
bought Pablo Picasso's ``Acrobat and Young Harlequin'' for a record
$38.46 million and plans to sell the Rose Period masterpiece to a
buyer in Tokyo.
   The pink-and-rose painting of two circus performers sold Monday
for the highest price ever paid at auction for a work of art created
in this century.
   It also was the third most expensive work of art ever auctioned.
It is surpassed only by two late 19th century paintings by Vincent
van Gogh sold in 1987, ``Irises'' at $53.9 million and
``Sunflowers'' at $41.3 million.
   Yasuhiro Tanaka, a spokesman for Mitsukoshi Department Store,
said in Tokyo that its representative Akio Nishino bought the
Picasso painting at the Christie's auction in London on behalf of
the store.
