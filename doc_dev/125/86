   Thieves stole two Picasso works
valued at more than $100,000 from an art gallery in Sao Paulo, it
was reported Saturday.
   Horacio Penteado, director of the Association of Friends of
Modern Art, said an etching and a ceramic figure were stolen early
Friday from the downtown gallery and he valued each at more than
$50,000.
   ``There were no signs of forced entry,'' he said. ``Obviously
someone who had previous access to the gallery did the job.''
   Panteado identified the mising objects as the etching ``Goat's
Head on a Table'' and the ceramic figure ``The Dove.'' He said they
were completed in the 1940s by Pablo Picasso and given to the art
association in the 1950s by Count Francesco Matarazzo, a Brazilian
millionaire.
   The 23-inch by 31-inch black-and-white etching was cut from its
frame, according to Penteado. He said ``The Dove'' was 12 inches
tall.
   Both works were partially insured, he said, and the gallery
``probably would receive just half their value.''
   He said the objects were in the gallery's 80-piece collection of
20th century art.
   The Spanish painter and sculptor, a pioneer in cubism, died in
1973.
