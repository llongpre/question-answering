   Just how Pablo Picasso and his lesser-known
friend Georges Braque invented cubism eight decades ago is the topic
of a major exhibit opening Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art.
   The show, described by the museum as the first attempt to examine
cubism ``through an in-depth concentration on its core,'' deals with
the artists' work between 1907 and 1914.
   ``During the cubist years both artists were at their best when
they were closest to one another,'' exhibition organizer William
Rubin writes in the catalog. ``Cubism as we know it was a vision
that neither artist could have realized alone.''
   A New York Times critic described the exhibit as ``the show of
the decade.''
   The exhibition consists of 390 works, including paintings,
drawings, prints, sculptures and collages. They were borrowed from
museums and collections all over the United States and Europe, and
from the Soviet Union.
   The French-born Braque lived from 1882 to 1963. Picasso, a native
of Spain who spent most of his life in France, lived from 1881 to
1973. They were colleagues in Paris at the time they developed the
abstract style known as cubism in the early years of the century.
