   The Pompidou Center is displaying more than 400
works by the Russian-born painter Marc Chagall that were turned
over to the government in lieu of taxes.
   Many of them have never been seen before in public.
   ``The value of the collection cannot be estimated,'' said
Finance Minister Edouard Balladur. ``The government never could
have afforded to allocate such sums to enrich the national
heritage.''
   Chagall died in 1985 at his home in southern France at the age
of 97. Working steadily until the end, he left behind a vast
private collection of oil paintings, drawings, mosaics, sketches,
book illustrations, set designs, and engravings worth countless
millions of dollars.
   The works, previously owned by the Chagall family, are displayed
in four galleries on the Pompidou Center's fourth floor.
   The works represent the second largest donation ever accepted in
lieu of death duties. The largest one came from Pablo Picasso's
heirs and constitute what is now the permanent collection of the
Picasso Museum, housed in the Hotel Sale in central Paris.
   Government officials have not decided how the Chagall collection
will be dispersed among France's many national museums, but it is
likely that works with biblical themes will go to the National
Museum of Chagall's Biblical Message in Nice.
   Many of the works on show are known to have been among the ones
the artist loved the best. They include ``Bella au Col Blanc,''
(1917), a sensitive portrait of his first wife, Bella, dressed in a
low-cut dark dress, her graceful features and black hair set off by
a wide, white collar.
   Bella died in New York in 1944. Chagall married Valentina
Brodsky in 1952.
   The painting has a cubist touch, and many critics say it is
reminiscent of Picasso's masterpiece ``Les Demoiselles d'Avignon.''
   ``The paintings look fine in Paris, but they weren't bad in my
house either,'' said Chagall's widow, known as Vava, during a tour
of the show.
   The exhibition, which runs until June 5, also features ``Les
Maries de la Tour Eiffel'' (1938-39), set and costume designs
created for Moscow's Jewish Theater including those for Gogol's
``Revizor,'' and several self-portraits.
