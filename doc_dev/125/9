   The family of Joan Whitney Payson, which sold
Vincent van Gogh's ``Irises'' two years ago for $53.9 million, hopes
to fetch a similar price on Nov. 15 for an early Picasso
self-portrait.
   Sotheby's said Thursday that ``Au Lapin Agile,'' named after a
tavern frequented by the artist, has been consigned by Mrs. Payson's
daughter, Linda de Roulet, who kept the Picasso in her home in
Manhasset, on Long Island.
   She inherited it from her mother, a philanthropist, co-owner of a
racing stariod are in museums;
this one appeared briefly in 1980 at the National Museum of Western
Art in Tokyo, said David Nash, senior vice president of fine arts
for Sotheby's New York.
   Picasso, then 25, painted the unsigned work in 1905 as a gift to
Frederic Gerard, the tavern owner, who appears in the background,
strumming a guitar. ``Maybe Picasso gave it in exchange for a few
drinks _ who knows?'' said Nash.
   Mrs. Payson acquired it in 1952. ``This magnificent painting was
in our parents' home in Manhasset for 27 years and, for a time, hung
near van Gogh's `Irises,''' Mrs. de Roulet said in a statement.
   Her brother said in an interview that Mrs. de Roulet also
displayed ``Au Lapin Agile'' prominently. But she became ``a bit
nervous having the painting in her house'' because of the prices
commanded by ``Irises'' and ``Yo Picasso,'' a 1901 self-portrait,
sold for $47.8 million on May 9.
   The real clincher, said Payson, was in December, when Mrs. de
Roulet discovered her grandsons playing with a dartboard near the
Picasso.
   ``That seemed to be some kind of an omen,'' said Payson.
   Nash said it's difficult to set a presale estimate because of the
unpredictable art market.
   ``This is much larger than `Yo Picasso.' It is a much more
complex painting, with considerable psychological tensions,'' he
said. ``In a logical world, it should lead to a higher price.''
   Part of the sale proceeds will be used to establish a foundation
for medical research and education.
