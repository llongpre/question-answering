   NEW YORK -- Federal agents said they have broken an
alleged international art-fraud network that specialized in
selling fake prints and lithographs by 20th century masters.
   The agents, who stood next to a knockoff of a Salvador
Dali print of clocks melting into a barren landscape,
revealed that they seized more than 70,000 counterfeits of
works by Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall and Joan Miro from
Original Artworks Ltd. in Island Park, N.Y., last summer.
Also seized were some fraudulent copies of drawings by actor
Henry Fonda.

   "We believe these actions cut off the single largest
world-wide source and distribution network of counterfeit
prints," said L.R. Heath, the chief postal inspector in New
York.
   The focus of the 18-month federal investigation was the
Amiel family, which operates Original Artworks. Federal
prosecutors charged Hilda Amiel, her daughters Kathryn Amiel
and Joanne Amiel, and her granddaughter Sarina Amiel, with
mail fraud. The Amiel family business was allegedly started
by Hilda Amiel's husband, Leon Amiel, who died in 1988.
   According to John S. Ellis, the postal inspector who led
the investigation into the alleged art fraud, the Amiels
bought the fake prints and lithographs in the U.S. and
Europe. They then allegedly distributed them in the U.S.,
presenting them as actual works by Miro, Chagall, Dali and
Picasso. The works bear forged signatures of the artists and
were sometimes accompanied by certificates of authenticity,
Mr. Ellis said.
   Most of the prints were sold in art galleries catering to
tourists and one-time purchasers of art. The fakes sold for
prices usually ranging from $1,000 to $8,000. The most
expensive print was a copy of "Equinox" by Miro, which was
sold for more than $60,000. Mary W. S. Bartow, vice president
of the prints department at Sotheby's in New York, said that
a real "Equinox" print sold for $150,000 at the height of the
art market.
   Ms. Bartow, who along with other Sotheby's experts
assisted in the investigation, said that no serious art
dealer would have been taken in by the counterfeits. "They're
very obviously fakes," Ms. Bartow said. "The paper's wrong.
The color's all off."
   The Amiels were arraigned yesterday in federal court in
Brooklyn. Earlier this month, a federal judge upheld a
decision seizing $4.5 million in assets from the Amiels under
civil forfeiture laws. Purchasers of the alleged fakes will
be able to seek reimbursement from that fund. The Amiels are
appealing the decision.
   Phone calls to the Amiel residence in Island Park weren't
returned.
   In addition, federal prosecutors said, Thomas Wallace of
Bellmore, N.Y., agreed to plead guilty to fraud charges for
selling alleged fakes bought from the Amiels.
   Federal authorities said that they also have taken civil
and criminal action against dealers in New York and one in
Chicago, and that police in Denmark and Sweden charged
dealers with fraud. Those dealers are alleged to have dealt
in fakes purchased from the Amiels.
   The Federal Trade Commission also said that as a result of
the investigation it was issuing more than 100 subpoenas to
art dealers and brokers who allegedly sold the fakes and that
the investigation into art fraud would continue.
