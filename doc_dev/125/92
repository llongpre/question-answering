<HEAD>Panel Approves Truck Safety Legislation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Commerce Committee has approved
legislation to toughen penalties for drug sales at truck stops and
highway rest areas.
   The legislation also would ban trucking companies from hauling
hazardous materials and bus companies from carrying passengers if
they receive an ``unsatisfactory'' safety rating from the
Transportation Department.
   The measure, sent to the full Senate on Tuesday, provides for
doubling and tripling of existing penalties for crimes involving
drug sales at truck stops and rest areas. It also would establish
minimum jail sentences _ one year for first convictions and three
years for repeat offenders.

<HEAD>Machine for The Blind Obeys Spoken Commands</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developers of a new machine say the device,
although still primitive, is the most promising aid for the blind
since the introduction of Braille 160 years ago.
   The Personal Companion, unveiled at a news conference Tuesday,
was created for the 6.5 million Americans who cannot see well enough
to read or are so handicapped they can't turn a page or punch a
keyboard.
   The machine looks like a computer, but without a keyboard. It is
programmed to respond to the voice of its user.
   Transceptor Technologies Inc., an Ann Arbor, Mich., company
founded in 1986 by people with backgrounds in medicine, visual
rehabilitation, telecommunications, computer design and education,
developed the Personal Companion.

   The National Gallery of Art will receive its
first Vincent Van Gogh painting for its permanent collection with
the donation of his ``Roses'' by Pamela Harriman, wife of the late
Ambassador W. Averell Harriman.
   The painting is valued at $50 million to $60 million.
   Gallery director J. Carter Brown also announced at a National
Press Club luncheon Tuesday that the gallery had received gifts of
three major 20th century works from the late Rita Schreiber of Los
Angeles in memory of her husband, Taft B. Schreiber, a Republican
activist and MCA Inc. executive who died in 1976.
   The Schreiber gifts include a 1924 painting titled ``Harlequin
Musician'' by Pablo Picasso, ``Woman Seated in an Armchair'' painted
by Henri Matisse in 1940 and a 1927 bronze sculpture by Constantin
Brancusi titled ``Bird in Space.''
   Brown said ``Roses'' would be displayed as part of a three-month
exhibit devoted to anniversary gifts of art beginning March 17,
1991, the 50th anniversary of the opening of the gallery's West
Building.
