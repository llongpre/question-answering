   Nineteen paintings worth more than $2
million, including works by Picasso and Renoir, were stolen by
thieves who lowered themselves into a 5th-floor apartment by rope,
police said today.
   Police said there was no burglar alarm system in the studio
apartment in Cannes, owned by a former government official and used
by his 30-year-old son, who works as a night watchman.
   The son, Armand Schwarz-Fuchs, discovered the theft when he
returned from work early Wednesday, police said.
   Among the works reported stolen were paintings by 19th and 20th
century masters Pablo Picasso, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Edgar Degas,
Amedeo Modigliani and Edouard Manet.
   Officials initially estimated the value of the stolen paintings
at nearly $2 million, but police said today that the value was
likely to be much higher.
   French press reports suggested there was uncertainty as to the
origin of the paintings, and police said they wanted to talk with
the apartment's owner, Jacques Schwarz-Fuchs, 62.
   A retired member of the Council of State, Schwarz-Fuchs
reportedly is ill and receiving medical care in the eastern city of
Strasbourg.
   According to police, the thieves broke through a balcony window
of the apartment in Cannes after lowering themselves by rope from
the roof, two floors above.
   There have been several major thefts of privately owned art
works in the past two years in Cannes and nearby Nice.
   In December, eight oil paintings by Henri Matisse, valued at
more than $12 million, were stolen from a Nice apartment. The works
were recovered in January, and a suspect was sentenced to three
years in prison.
