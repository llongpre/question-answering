FT  13 MAY 93 / Survey of Southern France (8): Cote d'Azur, take a
sentimental journey - The region's museums and art galleries embellish its
glamorous image
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLING around the Cote d'Azur conjures images of Brigitte Bardot sunning
herself in Saint Tropez during the 1960s, or the packed pavement cafes of
coastal towns in the 1990s.
But there is another aspect to the Cote d'Azur, the tiny museums and art
galleries tucked away in the Provencal hills, or clinging to the cliffs
along the sea. These are the places that give a glimpse of the south before
the Bardot-boom and of the serene lifestyle that attracted some of Europe's
most famous artists - such as Renoir, Matisse and Picasso - to the region.
Musee Renoir is typical. It is a sturdy stone house perched in the hills
above Cagnes-sur-Mer where the painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, lived with
his wife and three sons from 1909 to 1919. The house and its contents have
been left intact. Renoir's wheelchair is still in the studio, as are his
easels, brushes and frames. The walls are hung with his paintings and those
of friends such as Bonnard and Dufy.
The garden is lovely, with ancient olive trees straggling down the hill and
a view that stretches to the Cape of Antibes. But the real appeal of the
museum, as with all France's musees sentimentaux, is that it is impossible
to visit without imagining what it was like when Renoir himself lived and
worked there. (Musee Renoir, avenue des Collettes, Cagnes-sur-Mer. Tel: 9320
6107.)
If Renoir was content with a simple rustic house, Pablo Picasso's taste was
a little more opulent. Picasso spent a long part of his life in the south,
but one of the best collections of his work is at Musee Grimaldi-Picasso on
the Antibes waterfront, where he lived for the summer and autumn of 1946.
Musee Grimaldi-Picasso is a pretty old stone castle with stunning views onto
the sea. The collection, although not as impressive as in the Musee Picasso
in Paris, has a decent selection of oil paintings, ceramics and sculpture,
most of which were completed while Picasso lived there. (Musee
Grimaldi-Picasso, place Mariejol, Antibes. Tel: 9334 9191.)
A little further along the coast from Antibes in the village of Biot is the
Musee National Fernand Leger, the fruit of a donation by his wife, Nadine,
to the French government, which houses one of the most extensive collections
of Leger's work.
The museum, contains many of Leger's most important paintings. The building,
a modernist edifice set in rolling lawns and embellished with Leger's own
brightly coloured friezes, is spectacular. The collection is illustrated by
sketches and photographs which give a glimpse of the gregarious artist's
life. (Musee National Fernand Leger, chemin du Val de Pome, Biot. Tel: 9365
6349.)
The Cote d'Azur also houses a number of private collections. Fondation
Ephrussi de Rothschild on Cap-Ferrat has an air of the Hollywood hills with
its motley assortment of antique treasures - a Grecian column here, a Gothic
doorway there - and its candy-coloured Italianate facade.
The house was built at the turn of the century as a home for the baroness'
collection of art and furniture, which ran from Tiepolo ceilings to Louis
XIV chairs, Beauvais tapestries, Fragonard paintings and the tiny circular
room on the ground floor where she entertained her lovers. (Fondation
Ephrussi de Rothschild, Cap-Ferrat. Tel: 9301 3309.)
A very different collection is lodged high in the hills near the village of
Saint-Paul-de-Vence at Fondation Maeght. This is the gallery bequeathed by
the Maeghts, a family of Paris art dealers, to house their private
collection and temporary exhibitions which include some of the best-known
names in modern art, including Giacometti, Miro, Arp and Zadkine. (Fondation
Maeght, 06570 Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Tel: 9332 8163.)
The village is also home to La Colombe d'Or, the famous restaurant, where
Picasso, Braque, Calder, Miro and Chagall used to eat, paying for their food
with their work. The restaurant, now run by the fourth generation of the
founding Roux family, has been left with an art collection - a Leger frieze
along the terrace, Braques and Picassos hung between the tables - which
would be the envy of many museums.
French foodies are wont to say that La Colombe d'Or's food is not as good as
it used to be - but they tend to say that about almost every restaurant. Its
tables quake under the weight of hearty Provence fare and it still scores a
respectable 12 out of 20 in the snooty Gault Millau guide. (La Colombe d'Or,
06570 Saint-Paul. Tel: 9332 8002.)
Visitors to Saint-Paul should also look in on the Chapelle du Rosaire in the
neighbouring village of Vence, a tiny church designed by Henri Matisse, who
believed that it included his finest pieces of stained glass. (Chapelle du
Rosaire, Avenue Henri Matisse, Vence.)
