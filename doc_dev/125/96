   Edouard Manet's ``La Rue Mosnier aux Drapeaux''
sold for $26.4 million Tuesday, a world auction record for the
artist, Christie's auction house said.
   The oil painting depicting a Paris street bedecked with flags
commemorating war dead was bought by an anonymous U.S. dealer, said
Starr Collins, a spokeswoman for the auction house.
   The previous auction record for a Manet as $11.08 million, set
in 1986, for another painting of the same street with the same
title, she said.
   Vincent Van Gogh's oil painting ``Le Vieil If,'' or ``The Old
Yew Tree,'' sold for $20.35 million to an anonymous buyer, Collins
said.
   Pablo Picasso's ``Famille de l'arlequin,'' a representation of
the Cirque Medrano acrobats that characterizes the artist's Rose
period, sold for $15.4 million to a U.S. dealer, she said.
   Other highlights included Claude Monet's ``Nympheas,'' an
exploration of the pond at the artist's home at Giverny, which sold
for $11.55 million to an anonymous buyer.
   Constantin Brancusi's ``La Muse en Dormie III,'' a marble
sculpture of a female head in an abstract form, sold for $8.25
million to an Asian dealer.
   Nine artists' records were set at the $232.4 million sale of
Impressionist and modern paintings and sculpture from several
collections including those of Mrs. and Mrs. Paul Mellon and Mr.
and Mrs. George N. Richard.
