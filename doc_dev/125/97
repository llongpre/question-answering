   Edouard Manet's ``La Rue Mosnier aux Drapeaux''
has been sold at auction for $26.4 million, a record for the artist.
   The oil-on-canvas painting of a Paris street bedecked with flags
commemorating the war dead was bought at Christie's auction house
Tuesday by an anonymous American dealer for the J. Paul Getty
Museum in Malibu, Calif.
   Another painting of the same street, with the same title, set
the previous auction record of $11.08 million for a Manet in 1986,
said Christie's spokeswoman Starr Collins.
   The painting that was sold on Tuesday was from the collection of
Paul Mellon.
   ``We are very happy to acquire a major work of the 1870s by
Manet, one which is compositionally inventive, penetrating in its
observation of Parisian street life and painted with a diverse and
brilliant technique,'' said George Golder, the Getty museum's
acting curator.
   Vincent van Gogh's ``Le Vieil If,'' or the old yew tree, also in
oil on canvas, sold for $20.35 million to an anonymous buyer,
Collins said.
   Pablo Picasso's ``Famille de l'arlequin,'' a representation of
acrobats from the artist's Rose period, sold for $15.4 million to
an American dealer, she said.
