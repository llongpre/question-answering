   A record price of $24.8 million for a Picasso painting was paid at Christie's last night. 
The buyer was an unidentified Latin American collector bidding by telephone. 

   The painting, Maternite, which also set a record price for a work of 20th century art, was a rare portrait of a mother and child from 1901, early in Picasso's blue period. 
The previous record for a Picasso of $15.4 million was set only last week at Sotheby's here. 

   The Picasso was one of 28 artworks auctioned last night from the collection of the late William and Edith Mayer Goetz. 
Mr. Goetz was a motion picture executive, and his wife was the daughter of movie mogul Louis B. Mayer. 

   The entire collection of impressionist and modern art sold for $85 million, an auction record for a single-owner sale. 

   Richard Gray, a Chicago art dealer, said after the sale, "In this kind of a market, very good pictures do extremely well. 
This is an extraordinary collection." 

   Records were set for the work of eight artists, including Pierre Bonnard and Henri Fantin-Latour. 
A bronze of a young ballerina by Edgar Degas sold for $10.2 million, a record for a Degas sculpture and slightly higher than the price fetched for a similar sculpture at Sotheby's six months ago. 

   Japanese bidders were active in a packed sale room that included Barbara Walters and Claudette Colbert. 

   Christie's is a unit of Christie's International PLC of London.
