It's been a rough century. Now, here at the end of it, we are enchanted with 
art made in France in the twilight of the last century. Impressionism and 
Post-Impressionism appeared when European life was marked by private anxiety 
and public self-satisfaction, much as the West is today. Their discontinuities 
were more civilized, of course. 
</P>
<P>
The French scorned the art. Supporters had to wage a battle to get the Louvre 
to accept a gift of it. We have come to embrace it with the enthusiasm of a 
mother clasping her first grandchild. Starting Thursday, the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art hosts a traveling exhibition of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Masterpieces of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism: The Annenberg 
Collection" consists of 54 paintings regularly characterized by insiders as the 
very finest compendium of its kind still in private hands. There are six works 
each by Renoir and Monet, eight Cezannes, four Gauguins, five Van Goghs and 
signature masterpieces you thought must surely belong to great museums -- 
Gauguin's "La Siesta" and Van Gogh's "La Berceuse," among others. 
</P>
<P>
Hard to imagine a show with such popular appeal and professional pedigree 
opening with strikes against it, but there are a few. First, there's the danger 
the super-hip will feel obliged to disdain such beloved art on principle. Then, 
there is the problem of current art prices so obscenely escalated that visitors 
might look at, say, Picasso's "Au Lapin Agile" and see nothing but the $40.7 
million that Annenberg paid at auction. Finally, there is the unseemly and 
slightly ghoulish speculation that has dogged the tour, wondering which museum 
is finally going to receive all this loot if Walter Annenberg decides to donate 
this art to a public collection. People used to have better manners. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone anxious that all that will somehow cloud minds and taint enjoyment can 
happily forget it. One look and all secondary considerations just drop away. 
It's a superb show chocked with pleasure, passion and revelation. Undoubtedly 
it will pack in the public until it closes on Nov. 11. The wise are forewarned 
-- one needs a ticket. 
</P>

Philip Conisbee, LACMA curator of European painting and sculpture, has spaced 
the work out leisurely in six capacious galleries. He caused walls to be 
painted in subdued tones that key off the assembled works and make them look 
sumptuous without getting in the way. 
</P>
<P>
Arranged in rough chronological order, the tour begins with such Impressionist 
precursors as Camille Corot, whose "The Curious Little Girl" turns to us from 
peering over a fence. She reveals a face at once innocent and smoldering, like 
that of the child in the graveyard in Thomas Mann's "Tonio Kruger." Corot's 
concentration on depicting weight and roundness keeps his pictures in the past. 
Henri Fantin-Latour's flower still lifes stay there, too, despite wistful 
delicacy. Eugene Boudin influenced Monet, but the loosening brushwork in his 
beach scenes looks more like a formula for simplification than a quest for a 
new way to paint. His pictures remain as quaint as his formally dressed 
subjects, who sit on the beach on stiff wooden chairs. 
</P>
<P>
When we encounter the first Monets and Degases something new happens. Their 
work is on our side of the historical Rubicon. They have followed Baudelaire's 
advice and depicted the modern world in a modern way, making the first art that 
holds up a mirror in which we can still see ourselves today, albeit barely. The 
modernity of Monet's and Degas' work is subtle, as befits the French, but 
unmistakable. So subtle, in fact, that one wonders at the fuss and ostracism 
that greeted this work. What was that all about? Simple enough. The French of 
the fin de siecle were as worried about the arrival of the modern world as we 
are about its departure. They were afraid of progress. Down with the Tour 
Eiffel. We are afraid of grinding o a halt. Up with the Trump Tower. 
</P>
<P>
Folks out for a nice time in the galleries love the Impressionists for their 
worship of the good, simple life -- perfect sparkling Sunday afternoons in the 
country, cafes full of saucy girls and dashing dandies, draped living rooms 
with pianos and pretty children like Renoir's "The Daughters of Catulle 
Mendes." The scene is so seductive you barely notice the tension between 
Renoir's desire to combine the surface of the present with the structure of the 
past, but it shows in the doll-like stiffness of the figures. 
</P>
<P>
Impressionism is pleasant and reassuring of a middle-class beatific vision. 
People don't usually notice the ennui and melancholy that lurk in even the most 
beautiful of these pictures, forecasting urban alienation. Berthe Morisot's 
pearly "The Pink Dress" has deep poignancy that carries right over to Edouard 
Vuillard's "The Album." The seven female figures in the Vuillard nearly 
disappear into the wallpaper until one head firms up like a Vermeer. It's like 
Proust's Swann discovering his love, Odette. 
</P>
<P>
Careful viewers value the Impressionists for the serious way they explored the 
use of paint and visual possibilities behind their dappled facades. Monet and 
later Seurat broke up the color spectrum in a way that was a metaphor for our 
century's scientific vision -- probing until the whole universe is caught being 
made of the same particulate matter. Musical types can scan the six-foot-plus 
swath of Monet's grand water lilies and hear Debussy. Artniks know Jackson 
Pollock would have been impossible without Monet. The Impressionist sensibility 
could be mistaken for ours in the 1950s. The Impressionists were classier, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Every gallery has at least one drop-dead masterpiece and the first is Edgar 
Degas' "At the Milliner's." How could even an egghead resist its drowsy 
three-o'clock afternoon charm and the intimacy of the woman helping her friend 
try on a new straw bonnet? If the scene is nostalgic, the vision is still new. 
With its tipped floor and cropped edges, this is a scene we'll only see for 
seconds out of the corner of an eye. Slow action, fast take. Very timely. 
</P>
<P>
The fact that Impressionism offers satisfaction to such a broad audience 
defines it as one of those breathless moments of harmonic artistic balance that 
genuinely offers something of value to the most and least demanding members of 
the audience. Such instants are rare and never last. Post-Impressionism 
sustained the moment even as it headed to a crossroad that would fraction off 
the popular audience and make art into an insider's game for most of modern 
times. 
</P>
<P>
The Impressionist vision was middle-class and stay-at-home. It flirted with 
japonisme about the same way Gilbert and Sullivan did in "The Mikado." It was 
up to the Post-Impressionists to dig deeper into the exotic, the primitive and 
-- with seeming contradiction -- the purely formal. They set the prototype for 
the modern Bohemian and invented the counterculture. They were the ancestors of 
hippies. Better artists, of course. 
</P>
<P>
If the county museum owned only the pictures in the rooms devoted to Cezanne, 
Gauguin and Van Gogh, it would be transformed into a great repository at a 
stroke. The Cezannes manage to define the artist in just eight pictures. A 
still life and a Mont Sainte-Victoire encapsulate the monumental effort of 
pictorial logic that would lead to Cubism. A picture of a monk captures his 
ascetic dedication and an abandoned house speaks of his isolation. 
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh has become so universally revered it's almost impossible to talk about 
him. Luckily we can still look at him, and the Annenberg pictures find him at 
his gentlest. His "Vase of Roses" was done at the asylum at Saint-Remy in a 
period of calm. White blossoms standing against a pale green background make a 
haiku-like simile of petals that will fall like snow. "La Berceuse" is a 
portrait of the wife of his friend, postman Joseph Roulin. The chunky, 
cloisonne image lives somewhere between the Middle Ages and rural Japan. 
</P>
<P>
These artists combined human and pictorial basics in ways that would lead to 
bottom-line abstraction, gutsy Expressionism and -- in Gauguin -- primitivism. 
Annenberg, however, likes them relaxed. The deep blue gallery devoted to 
Gauguin is dominated by his wonderful, easy Tahitian masterpiece, "La Siesta." 
No artist since Watteau had painted a back so eloquent as that of the central 
figure. We learn all about her from her earthy foot, faux-native sarong, gauzy 
blouse and the perky straw hat that speaks of youthful humor and zing. 
</P>
<P>
The curator says his final gallery is "something of a grab-bag." It bounces 
around from Lautrec's brooding, big-bottomed hooker to Braque's crystalline 
"The Studio" and Matisse's eccentric odalisque, but a kind of theme emerges. 
We're back in sleazy, sophisticated, bewitching Paris. Picasso's 1905 "Au Lapin 
Agile" finds the artist youthfully cynical about the fleshpots after the death 
of his best friend, Carlos Casagemas. Structurally, the painting shows him 
trying out the use of multiple modes of perception. He combines poster flatness 
with carved-out drawing, shifting gears for the 20th Century with its clashing 
angles of view. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe what we really like about this art is an encouragement hidden within it. 
If they could leave such a legacy from the tumultuous end of their century, 
maybe we can survive the end of ours, Saddam Hussein notwithstanding.
