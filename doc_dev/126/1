THE Venezuelan cabinet approved at the weekend a Dollars 1.7bn heavy oil
project to be carried out by Conoco, a subsidiary of EI du Pont, and
Venezuela's national oil company, writes Joseph Mann in Caracas.
The project calls for producing and upgrading very heavy crude oil from
Venezuela's Orinoco oil belt, the world's largest known accumulation of
heavy oil and bitumen.
This is the first time a foreign company will be allowed to participate as a
direct investor in Venezuela's oil production sector since the republic
nationalised its petroleum industry in 1976. It is also the first step
towards opening up large-scale production in the belt.
Conoco and Maraven, a subsidiary of Venezuela's national oil company, PDVSA,
will be equal partners in the project, according to Mr Frank Alcock, PDVSA
vice-president.
The plan, which must be approved by the Venezuelan congress, involves
producing 120,000 barrels a day of extra-heavy crude oil from the Orinoco
belt and converting it into 102,000 barrels a day of lighter gravity oil,
plus 3,000 tonnes of petroleum coke.
The belt, north of the Orinoco river, contains an estimated 1,200bn barrels
of extra-heavy crude oil and bitumen.
