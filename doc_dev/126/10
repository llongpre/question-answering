   The Venezuelan Energy and Ministry on
Friday denied reports that it had ordered the state oil industry to
raise output to cover Iraq and Kuwait's OPEC quotas.
   ``Until this moment, the minister has not ordered any increase
and our production is still limited to our OPEC quota of 1.945
million barrels per day of crude,'' a ministry spokesman told The
Associated Press.
   ``However, a new order could be given later on, depending on
OPEC agreements,'' he added.
   Venezuela will not make any unilateral hikes, and in any case,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is awaiting word
from Arab leaders on the success of their peace efforts before
changing the level of output, the spokesman said.
   Energy Minister Celestino Armas is in ``constant touch'' with
other OPEC ministers. The cartel has yet to make any decision about
making up for Iraq's 3.1 million barrels per day and Kuwait's 1.5
million, the spokesman said.
   ``But depending on what happens in the Arab world, minister
Armas may make an announcement within a day or two,'' he said.
   Reports from New York and elsewhere had indicated that the state
oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) had already
ordered its subsidiaries to raise output by around 500,000 bpd.
   However, by law, the ministry imparts instructions to PDVSA,
which cannot raise production on its own.
   According to a recent nationwide test, Venezuela has the
capacity to produce between 2.6 and 2.7 million barrels of oil per
day, excluding heavy crudes. Its reserves are sixth in the world,
not counting oil in the Orinoco bitumen belt.
   Venezuela's OPEC limitations have led to friction between the
ministry and PDVSA, which has advocated overproduction to finance a
$20 billion program to expand the oil and petrochemical industries
over the next 10 years.
   A main goal is to raise production capacity to 3.5 million
barrels per day by 1995 and to 4 million by 2000.
