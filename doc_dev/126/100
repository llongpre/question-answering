   Seven OPEC nations will meet informally
Sunday to discuss the Persian Gulf crisis that has tightened world
oil supplies and sent crude prices soaring, Venezuela's president
said Thursday.
   Oil ministers from a majority of the 13 nations making up the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to attend the
talks in Vienna, the cartel's headquarters, Venezuelan President
Carlos Andres Perez said in Caracas.
   Perez did not list the nations. He said the meeting would not
require a decision on whether to increase production to make up for
an international embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude because of
Iraq's invasion of its neighbor.
   Boosting production to account for the decline, which amounts to
about 4 million barrels of crude oil daily, has received
insufficient support among OPEC members.
   But in Venezuela's view, the meeting could turn into an
``emergency session'' in which decisions could be made, Venezuelan
Energy and Mines Minister Celestino Armas said.
   An OPEC source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said OPEC
President Sadek Boussena, the Algerian oil minister, will be in the
Austrian capital Sunday, and ``he will consult with anybody who
cares to come.''
   Fears of military escalation in the Mideast and shortages of oil
on Thursday sent futures prices for light, sweet crude up 71 cents
to $31.93 a barrel.
   On Wednesday, crude exceeded $30 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, breaking a threshold that had not been touched
since November 1985.
   In addition to Boussena, ministers from Indonesia, Nigeria and
Iran were expected to show up for the OPEC get-together.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying his trip ``is a positive response to
(Boussena's) call for an exchange of views on the current situation
in the world oil market.''
   One source said Saudi Arabia also was likely to attend, but
there was no official confirmation of the report.
   Boussena made a surprise visit Thursday to Jiddah, Saudi Arabia,
for talks with Hisham Nazer, the kingdom's oil minister, who was
rebuffed earlier in the week in an attempt to call an emergency
session of all 13 nations.
   Nazer, along with Venezuela's Armas, had requested the meeting
to discuss the turbulent situation. But OPEC headquarters issued a
statement Monday saying there was not enough support among the
others to hold a formal meeting.
   It was unclear whether either Saudi Arabia or Venezuela would
attend anything short of a conference of all the members. They were
reportedly backed in their call for an urgent meeting by Qatar, the
United Arab Emirates and Ecuador.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita was quoted by a
local newspaper in Jakarta as saying neither Iraq nor Kuwait would
attend the weekend talks.
   Saudi Arabia and Venezuela would like OPEC's approval to boost
oil production to help meet the shortfall.
   Nazer said last weekend Saudi Arabia, which produces about a
quarter of the cartel's oil, would lift pumping to 2 million
barrels a day, with or without the nod from OPEC.
   Without a formal meeting, the oil ministers could not authorize
some countries to overshoot the supply quotas set last month for
each member.
   Analysts expect Saudi Arabia, which produces about a quarter of
OPEC's oil, to follow up on its pledge to increase production. Its
cartel quota is 5.4 million barrels a day.
   In Caracas, the newspaper El National quoted industry sources as
saying the oil company Petroleos de Venezuela has received orders
to boost crude output soon by at least 300,000 barrels a day.
   Analysts expect the South American nation to add as much as a
half million barrels a day to its OPEC quota of 1.9 million barrels.
   They say the United Arab Emirates, likely producing about 1.7
million barrels a day, could reach up to 2 million barrels.
   Nigeria and Libya could each add about 100,000 to 200,000
barrels a day to their quotas. Nigeria has a cap of 1.6 million
barrels, and Libya, 1.2 million barrels.
   OPEC agreed at its midyear meeting last month in Geneva to limit
output to 22.5 million barrels a day in the final six months of the
year to try to kick crude prices up to $21 a barrel.
   With the gulf crisis, the average price of a basket of crudes
monitored by the group reached $25.29 a barrel last week.
   The next formal meeting of the organization is not scheduled
until December.
