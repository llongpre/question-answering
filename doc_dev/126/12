   The current combination of stagnant world demand for oil and excess production capacity is forcing Venezuela to look beyond its oil sector for growth. 

   The state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, has allocated more than $4.6 billion for 1986-90 to developing other energy resources such as petrochemicals, natural gas, coal and bitumen. 
For the same period, the company budgeted $4.7 billion for domestic oil exploration and development and $1 billion for upgrading oil refineries. 

   "We don't see a big increase coming in oil demand by the end of this decade," Pablo Reimpell, Petroleos' vice president, said in a telephone interview. 
"But we can look to areas like petrochemicals as a place to improve profitability." 

   Venezuela's oil income fell 44% last year to $7.2 billion from $12.86 billion in 1985, according to government figures. 
Its oil exports averaged 1,534,000 barrels a day last year at an average price of $13.90 a barrel. 
In 1985, output was smaller, averaging 1,371,000 barrels a day, but the average price was almost twice as high, at $25.89 a barrel. 

   Oil prices are expected to remain stable this year at higher levels than in 1986. 
But Venezuela's oil production is restricted by an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries quota agreement to 1,495,000 barrels a day. 
At that production rate, the country's oil income couldn't recover to its 1985 level unless prices averaged more than $23 a barrel, and there is no sign of that happening. 

   Among the non-oil sectors, Petroleos has earmarked the largest amount of capital for expansion of its petrochemical industry. 
In contrast to its declining oil revenue, the company's petrochemical sales rose 24% last year to about $559 million. 
Petrochemical export volume jumped 45% last year from 1985, while domestic sales rose 25%. 

   A $1.5 billion investment program for the petrochemicals sector has been approved by the government through 1992, according to Petroleos. 
Combined with private capital infusions, the sector is likely to see investment of more than $2 billion, Jack Tarbes, a Petroleos vice president, said recently. 

   Meanwhile, the state also plans to invest $1.4 billion to expand its natural gas network. 

   Venezuela has 55 trillion cubic feet of proven natural gas reserves, about 11% of the total in the Western Hemisphere. 
Petroleos estimates current demand for natural gas in the country at 1.8 billion cubic feet a day and projects that this could rise to 3.2 billion by the end of the century. 

   To meet demand, Venezuela will expand its gas-pipeline system from the eastern part of the country to Lake Maracaibo, a major oil and gas reserve area in western Venezuela. 

   The pipeline project, scheduled for completion around 1990, would be the first to link the gas reserves in the west with two major power plants in central Venezuela and the industrial facilities in the eastern part of the country. 

   Petroleos also hopes the project will eventually boost exports of liquefied petroleum gas, according to Emma Brossard, a consultant to the company and a director of the Center for Energy Studies at Louisiana State University. 

   Over the next five years, Petroleos also will look for growth opportunities through new energy industries, officials say. 
One example is orimulsion, a low-cost industrial fuel being tested by the company's research affiliate, Intevep. 

   Orimulsion is made by mixing bitumen -- the heavy oil tar sands found in Venezuela's oil-rich Orinoco belt -- with water and additives to make it more easily transportable. 

   Petroleos and U.S. utility officials say that once fully tested, orimulsion could become a competing fuel to coal and residual fuel oil. 
Petroleos has earmarked $180 million for development of the experimental fuel between now and 1992. 

   And while it is working on this potential competitor to coal, Petroleos also plans to invest more than $870 million in domestic coal production by the end of the 1980s. 

   Its coal company, Carbozulia, recently signed a preliminary development agreement with ACC Venezuela Inc., an affiliate of Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co., and Agip Carbone, an affiliate of the Italian energy holding company Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, to develop an open-pit bituminous coal mine in Guasare, 330 miles west of Caracas, Venezuela's capital. 
The Guasare area is believed to hold bituminous coal deposits of 470 million tons. 

   Carbozulia President Luis Urdenata said the initial cost of building the mine and related facilities would be around $455 million. 
He said the foreign joint-venture partners would contribute about 48%. 

   Initial production at the mine is projected to begin in the last quarter of this year, with full production by 1995. 

   Mr. Tarbes of Petroleos says the move into the coal business could assist, rather than conflict with, the fledgling orimulsion program. 

   "By getting into the coal business," he says, "we will be more expert in a market where orimulsion will need to compete."
