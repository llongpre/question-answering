VENEZUELA'S production of crude oil in 1991 averaged 2.488m barrels a day,
the highest level on record since the country's petroleum industry was
nationalised in 1976, official sources said in Caracas.
The 1991 production figure, which includes crude oil and small proportions
of condensates and natural gas liquids, represents an increase of nearly 11
per cent over 1990 production of 2.249m b/d. Exports of crude oil and
refined products in 1991 averaged 2.08m b/d, up more than 10 per cent from
the previous year's average of 1.88m b/d.
Venezuela's proven reserves of crude oil totalled 62.8bn barrels at the end
of 1991, up 5 per cent from a year earlier. This means that Venezuela
continues to hold the largest proved reserves of crude oil in the Western
Hemisphere, even without including the country's very large deposits of
extra heavy oil located in the Orinoco Belt.
