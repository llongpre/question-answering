<F P=106> [Report by Gregorio Salazar] </F>
  [Text] Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez admitted 
yesterday, upon returning from the United States, that a 
significant portion of the funds obtained as a result of 
currency devaluation will be used to pay the foreign debt. As 
Minister Sosa was about to get into his car, which by the way 
has a private license plate, he was approached by a reporter who 
asked: 
  [Unidentified Reporter] What will the government do with the 
additional income obtained from the sale of dollars? 
  [Sosa] Well, there are various aspects. First of all, the 
Central Bank of Venezuela [BCV] is trying to reduce liquidity 
through the zero coupon bond mechanism and is trying to 
establish a more permanent method. On the other hand, you must 
remember that our budgets include foreign debt servicing which 
must be paid in dollars, which means that it will cost us more 
bolivares. So we already know where those bolivares will go. 
  [Reporter] Can those bolivares be used to pay the debt? 
  [Sosa] Obviously ... 
  Previously, Sosa had answered several questions from 
reporters who inquired about the differences between the 
auctioning of dollars and foreign exchange controls. "The 
auctioning of dollars and foreign exchange controls are two 
completely different things. The word auction itself implies 
that there are no controls, because I understand it means that 
you can offer `two,' I can offer `three,' and another person can 
offer `two and a half.' Controls would mean that if I say `two' 
that is it." 
  Sosa said there will be no alternate to the BCV as a source 
of dollars. 
  [Reporter] Is the BCV also trying to control the large 
number 
of dollars being sold? 
  [Sosa] Evidently, it is trying to handle this -- price and 
volume -- step by step. I believe, however, that it is being 
handled beyond the normal needs. 
  He had previously been asked whether the mechanism to 
auction 
foreign exchange would be permanent or temporary. "I think it 
will last for some time. BCV is always trying to establish the 
measures that best fit the circumstances. For instance, the 
system the bank used a little more than a year ago, the 
"crawling peg standard" -- I do not know how to translate that, 
it sounds like a spider climbing a wall -- was different from 
the one used previously. The new mechanism fits reality more 
closely, and I think it will work just fine. 
  Sosa turned philosophical when he was asked what he had 
meant 
when he said the auctioning of U.S. dollars would be permanent. 
"God is the only permanent concept in life. All of the material 
things and man do not last forever, and whoever says the 
opposite is wrong. I meant that the system would last one year, 
maybe longer." 
  Someone told him that, according to National Convergence 
Deputy Jose Miguel Uzcategui, auctioning is the best exchange 
control. "Well, I will ask him to explain that to me when I see 
him." 
  Sosa expressed confidence in the auction mechanism 
established by BCV. He regards the system as convenient because 
financial markets are gradually returning to tranquillity. 
According to the finance minister, the Economic Cabinet 
discussed his trip to Washington and divided the cabinet into 
four sectors: political, social, infrastructure, and economic. 
  He said that in the United States, he met people willing to 
enter joint ventures with CVG [Venezuelan Guayana Corporation] 
in aluminum and steel manufacturing. He also thinks that another 
plant for manufacturing methanol for export could be built in 
Venezuela. Sosa, who is always optimistic, confidently expects 
inflation to decline and interest rates to fall by the end of 
the year. 
  Later, he said flatly that Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc. 
[PDVSA] 
will not be privatized. "There are very good possibilities for 
foreign capital, with technology, resources, and market 
potential, to join PDVSA subsidiaries in certain projects." A 
very large investment is required in the Orinoco Strip, Orinoco 
Delta, eastern Monagas, and the southern Sucre projects, which 
are open for investment. "This does not mean that PDVSA 
subsidiaries or PDVSA itself will be privatized," he said. 
  Asked how international reserves will be affected, he 
answered: "Let us hope that trust will make them increase. I do 
not think this system will affect the reserves. If they are 
affected in any way, it will be for the better."
