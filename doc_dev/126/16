    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 21 June. 
  The Banco de Maracaibo intervention board believes it is 
still possible to rescue this failing financial institution. The 
intervention board has completed a Banco de Maracaibo rescue 
plan that will be presented before the Banking 
Superintendency--the agency responsible for making a final 
decision on the issue. If the intervention board's plan is 
accepted, Banco de Maracaibo could begin operating again some 
time before 29 June--the date when Fogade [Deposit Guarantee and 
Banking Protection Fund] is scheduled to reinstate additional 
losses of 7.2 billion bolivares. According to the intervention 
board, Banco de Maracaibo is in a position to reimburse Fogade 
all of the 120 billion bolivares it has received in financial 
assistance so far. (Caracas Union Radio Network in Spanish 2200 
GMT 20 Jun 94) 
  The banking liquidity coefficient has fallen to 30.6 
percent. 
The coefficient, which measures cash availability in terms of 
total funds deposited in banks, was 30.6 percent in May. This 
means that for every 100 bolivares deposited by the public, the 
banking system is in a position to immediately provide slightly 
more than 30 bolivares. (Caracas Union Radio in Spanish 1245 GMT 
20 Jun 94) 
  According to Charles Roccia, vice president of Banco 
Provincial de Venezuela, a financing agreement was signed on 15 
June with a syndicate of Portuguese banks headed by Banco de 
Fomento de Portugal. The terms of the agreement include a $20 
million line of credit to be used to finance clients of 
Venezuelan banks who wish to import products from Portugal. Mr. 
Roccia pointed out that the agreement is very significant, 
particularly at this time, because it shows Portugal's 
confidence in the Venezuelan banking system. (Caracas EL GLOBO 
in Spanish 16 Jun 94 p 12) 
  In Caracas, state-owned Venezuelan Petroleum (PDVSA) has 
announced that Venezuela will begin selling orimulsion, boiler 
fuel made from heavy oil comprising 70 percent bitumen and 30 
percent water, in the Chinese market as result of a recent 
agreement signed between the North Industries Shenzhen 
Corporation and PDVSA's Bitumenes del Orinoco subsidiary. The 
agreement includes the supply of orimulsion for an electrical 
plant scheduled to begin operations in 1995. The Venezuelan 
company will be responsible to market, sale, and supply the 
orimulsion, as well as providing technical assistance to the 
client. (Paris AFP in Spanish 2018 GMT 20 Jun 94) 
  Recently released figures from the Central Statistics and 
Data Processing Office show that imports totaled $2.649 billion 
in the first quarter of the year, reflecting a 31.9 percent drop 
from the same period in 1993. The report also shows that 46.1 
percent of all imports originated in the United States; 7.1 
percent from Germany; 7.0 percent from Japan; 4.6 percent from 
Colombia; 4.2 percent from Italy; 3.2 percent from Brazil; and 
3.0 percent from France. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 16 Jun
