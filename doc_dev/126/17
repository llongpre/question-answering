   Environmentalists are concerned
that a quest for gold, uranium and other minerals threatens severe
damage to Venezuela's Amazon and the way of life of the territory's
12 Indian tribes.
   The territory of about 70,000 square miles of jungle and granite
is an an extension of Brazil's Amazon, already exploited and damaged
by the clearing of rain forests for development and by wildcat
mining.
   The mighty Orinoco River forms in Venezuela's Federal Amazonas
Territory and makes its way eastward to the Caribbean Sea.
   But the territory also contains precious minerals in its soil and
riverbeds, mainly gold and uranium, and the quest for them and the
riches they bring threatens a fragile ecosystem and the last of the
forest Indians whose way of life goes back millenia.
   Most of the territory is unexplored, and studies of its mineral
riches are mere estimates.
   Venezuela declared the Amazonas region a federal reserve in 1972,
off limits to all economic development projects.
   But, in apparent contradiction of the laws, the Ministry of Mines
in Caracas, the nation's capital, has granted concessions to some
miners operating inside the territory's three national parks and
other concessions to gold buyers.
   At the same time, the Ministry of the Environment has been
accused of catering to ``developmentalists,'' those who would like
to see Venezuela reap economic benefits from its land.
   Environmentalists complained in January when the government of
then-President Jaime Lusinchi gave the Guayana Venezuela Corp. the
rights to begin development projects in mining and other industries
in previously virgin Amazonas.
   The corporation, known by its Spanish initials CVG, is a state
entity that has monopolized iron, aluminum and gold exploitation in
nearby Bolivar state in southeastern Venezuela.
   The Lusinchi government's decree gives CVG power to move Indians
from their villages when deemed necessary and it has even asked
Indian leaders to work with it in cataloguing the region's potential
riches.
   The CVG plans to create extensive mining zones and rubber tapping
plantations, claims Aida Santana, head of Caracas Central
University's ``Amazonas Project.''
   Under the project students travel by river canoe into remote
Indian villages to spend months as part of their training in
medicine, anthropology, biology and other specialties.
   Santana maintains that the CVG's development plans would create
in Amazonas another ``Kilometer 88,'' an infamous strip of
malaria-and vice-ridden gold mines in Bolivar state.
   CVG denies that it plans unbalanced development of the region,
saying it will incorporate environmental impact reports into its
plans.
   However, Santana said: ``Any plans for exploitation of the
Amazonas are not justified. The resources are non-renewable, and
their exploitation is not worth the human sacrifice, and the
extinction of fauna and flora we have not even begun to study.''
   But the concerns of environmentalists may have become known too
late.
   Signs in Puerto Ayacucho, the capital of the territory with a
population of 40,000 along the Orinoco River, already advertise to
buy gold.
   Indians have moved to Puerto Ayacucho from their forest homes and
roam the streets at night after frequenting drinking establishments.
   Much of the mining in the territory's national parks, especially
in Yapacana Park at the confluence of the Orinoco and Ventuari
rivers, is done by Indians, generally of the Piaroa and Guajibo
ethnic groups, said Rafael Garcia of the National Parks Institute.
   ``The Indians usually use rudimentary mining techniques, such as
picks and shovels and sieves,'' he said. ``But the `creoles'
(Venezuelans of mixed blood) who travel down to barter gold usually
rip them off.''
   Garcia added that in addition to exploiting the Indian miners,
outsiders were using mercury to extract gold from riverbeds,
poisoning the water and causing extensive damage to wildlife and the
Indians themselves.
   Roman Catholic missionaries in the southeast of the territory,
home to roughly 9,000 Yanomami Indians who also inhabit areas of
Brazil, recently blamed gold miners for the deaths by mercury
poisoning of some 100 Yanomami children.
   An invasion of about 3,000 Brazilian gold wildcatters into the
Venezuelan Amazon at the headwaters of the Orinoco created a public
outcry in April.
   The Brazilians were eventually airlifted by Venezuelan and
Brazilian military craft back to Brazil, but not before they caused
extensive damage to the headwaters.
   The Brazilians dredged riverbeds and cut down all vegetation
within 600 feet of the river. Scientists estimated the damage would
take hundreds of years to repair.
   The public outrage, not only over the environmental damage but
the assault on national ``sovereignty,'' led for calls for the
creation of a national park along the Sierra de Parima and the
headwaters of the Orinoco, and the use of national guard troops and
student volunteers to man the park system in Amazonas.
