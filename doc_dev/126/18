  [Text] China is a very important client for sales of 
Orimulsion (R) and negotiations with Bitumenes del Orinoco 
(Bitor), PDVSA's [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] marketing 
subsidiary for the fuel, have been concluded with agreement on 
the export to China of 5 million tons a year over the next five 
years, according to Carlos Borregales, the company's director. 
Beginning in 1995, the thermoelectric plant at Daga will use 1.2 
million tons of the fuel. 
  Borregales, together with the president of Intevep 
[Institute 
of Venezuelan Petroleum Technology], Gustavo Inciarte, and the 
manufacturing director of Venezuelan Petroleum, Otto Martinez, 
explained to the Finance Commission of the Senate, chaired by 
Virgilio Avila Vivas, measures taken by Venezuela to prevent 
protectionist treatment against Orimulsion (the United Kingdom) 
and reformulated gasolines (the United States). The Bitor 
executive was optimistic that the fuel's classification as a 
natural bitumen would prevail at the Council on Customs Matters 
that will meet for four weeks beginning 4 April. 
  The classification of Orimulsion (R) as a natural bitumen 
has 
an excellent chance of being approved by the Council on Customs 
Matters, especially as the organization approved the technical 
report last week. The thermoelectric generating fuel, a product 
of Venezuelan technology by Intevep, would thus not be subject 
to taxes. 
  About 100 countries will participate in the meeting, of 
which 
74 have the right to a voice and a vote, Venezuela being one of 
those with the right only to a voice. According to Borregales, 
the report with the technical data to support Orimulsion's 
classification as a natural bitumen is being sent to embassies 
for transmittal to their governments, so that they may have 
advance knowledge of the material prior to the April meeting. 
  Venezuela will request that Orimulsion be addressed during 
the second week of the council's meeting. Classification as a 
natural bitumen has an excellent probability of being approved 
by the 74 members of the council, among them the United States, 
Japan, Korea, and several European countries that gave their 
approval during the technical-scientific phase last week. 
Classification of Orimulsion as a natural bitumen (code 2714) is 
an important step in marketing the fuel in the old continent 
without facing protectionist barriers, halting the United 
Kingdom's offensive. 
  On 31 January 1994, the United Kingdom announced the 
application of a $10 per ton tax on the fuel next June, if the 
council decided to classify Orimulsion as a refined petroleum 
product (code 2715). Great Britain had pressed for the fuel to 
be classified a refined product during 1993, and that position 
halted negotiations for the sale of 3 million additional tons to 
major British electric companies. 
  Pressure from the United Kingdom resulted in Orimulsion's 
production at less than installed capacity (5 million tons) in 
Morichal. This caused losses to Bitor, said Borregales, although 
the firm's cash flow last year closed in balance. 
  Despite British pressure, the natural bitumen classification 
has majority support in the European Community because, of the 
76 votes that the 12 member countries possess, 43 are favorable 
to Venezuela and 33 are opposed. Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, 
Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and Belgium, with five, 
10, eight, five, five, two, five, and three votes, respectively, 
support Venezuela, while Great Britain, Germany, France (10 
votes each), and Ireland (three votes) are opposed. 
  Orimulsion exports have been growing, and while sales 
reached 
721,000 tons in 1992, last year they totalled 2.79 million tons 
with a value of $65,676,600 at a promotional price of $23.54 per 
ton. PDVSA's Business Plan 1993-2002 provides for the export of 
24 million tons of the fuel during the final year, with 
investments of $1.3 billion.
