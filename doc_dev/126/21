Hoping for Larger OPEC Output Quota

   Venezuela has nearly doubled the estimate of its proven oil reserves in the hope of winning a bigger output quota from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 

   But analysts say that the revision, which on paper catapults the South American nation to fourth place from No. 10 in oil reserves world-wide, is unlikely to make much headway in persuading its OPEC partners to give it a bigger share. 

   At the end of 1986, the state-run oil concern Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. recalculated the country's proven reserves at 55 billion barrels, up from the 29.5 billion barrels it claimed in 1985. 

   The greatest part of the increase resulted from the near-quadrupling of the estimated extractable reserves from the Orinoco deposit in Eastern Venezuela, to 18 billion barrels from five billion. 
The remaining eight billion extra barrels were attributed to new finds and improvements in extracting methods at existing fields. 

   Industry sources say the revision was justified and overdue. 
Neverthless, Venezuela clearly hopes the higher figure will give it an edge in talks that have been going on since mid-1985 within OPEC to establish a new, "scientific" formula for setting production quotas under its system of restricting overall output to boost prices. 

   What has emerged in the OPEC discussions so far is a consensus that the size of a country's oil reserves ought to be the main ingredient in determining its production ceiling. (Other countries, such as Nigeria, which has low reserves but a huge population, have argued for taking social and economic factors into consideration.) 

   Thus, Venezuela, like Iraq, which previously boosted its reserve estimates, is believed to be attempting to stake a claim for higher quotas if the oil group ever comes up with a new formula. 

   Bankers also say Venezuela may be hoping to use enlarged reserves as collateral in debt-repayment talks with banks. 
It is renegotiating $21 billion of foreign debt, out of a total $32 billion owed, following last year's 40% plunge in oil income. 

   "The basic thrust of the increase is political," one Caracas oil expert says. 
"By almost doubling reserves they (oil officials) have increased their weight in figuring quotas. 
They are staking an early claim to increased production." 

   Adds Felix Rossi Guerrero, Venezuela's chief representative to OPEC, "If eventually (the cartel) decides to apply a formula which includes proven reserves, the new level of reserves would be helpful to Venezuela." 

   Analysts are skeptical, however, that the maneuver will pay off. 
"It's an exercise in futility," says Alberto Quiros Corradi, former president of Petroleos de Venezuela's Lagoven operating subsidiary and currently director of the Caracas-based newspaper El Nacional. 
"I doubt very much that (OPEC) will arrive at such a formula." 

   At a December OPEC conference, Venezuela accepted a 79,000-barrel cutback in daily output to 1,495,000 barrels for the first half of 1987. 
Since then, it has increased oil prices several times, and hopes to get an average $15.68 dollars a barrel for the year, up from $12.89 in 1986.
