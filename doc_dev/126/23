   Re your May 1 article, "U.S. 
Begins to Take Notice as Venezuela Lifts Its Estimate of Proven Oil Reserves": 

   Not long ago Venezuela was the prime stereotype of an old played-out oil province. 
Reserves were "running out," as all over the world; soon we would be back begging at the Persian Gulf. 

   But the "running out" of reserves reflected only the lack of an inducement to invest. 
There had been no new private concessions since 1956, and nationalization was expected long before it came in 1976. 
Hence exploration went to near-zero, and development to a minimum. 
After a brief post-nationalization euphoria, drilling picked up, with the usual results. 

   "Proved reserves" are ready shelf inventory, oil connected to facilities in place and paid for. 
"Probable" or semi-proved reserves are warehouse inventory, amount and cost to be "guesstimated." 
Behind them lies the unworked quarry, with a large but undefined amount. 

   The Venezuelans started, at nationalization, with 15 billion barrels proved. 
They added another 18 billion in 11 years, offset by eight billion produced. 
They could have added more, if they had invested more. 
The great bulk of reserves added were in old fields, as is normal. 
New-found fields are credited, properly, with only small reserves because not much has been developed. 

   There is much more back in the warehouse (probable or semi-proved reserves), and it should not be lumped in with shelf inventory. 
By year's end, we will have some published unofficial industry estimates of how much is in each class. 

   But the Orinoco Belt is a separate province, with three trillion barrels in place. 
It took a lot of Venezuelan money and brainwork to make some of it a potential asset. 
If, as President Chacin of Petroleos de Venezuela has now revealed, current capacity to produce and -- more important -- to upgrade is about 150,000 barrels daily, the proved reserve probably does not exceed one billion barrels. 
Large amounts of it, perhaps 267 billion barrels, could be profitably developed at perhaps $4 a barrel. 
But very little will be, because Venezuela is part of a cartel that must restrain output in order to keep up the price. 

   Venezuela needs plenty of excess capacity, hence excess reserves, because without it, it gets no respect from its fellow cartelists, and a smaller quota. 
Its purchase of refinery and marketing outlets is a permanent netback agreement, which guarantees that it sells its full quota every month. 
And if the cartel finally disappears, which is far from being the case now, the country is in good condition to save as much as possible from the wreck by being poised to invest to expand production manifold to get higher revenues at lower prices. 

   So both claims are true: Venezuela has many times as much oil as Saudi Arabia, but it has only a fraction of Saudi proved reserves. 
What matters for reserves and capacity is, again, the inducement to invest, which is now very low in both countries because demand for cartel oil will stay low even at current "low" prices. 
And oil supply is insecure from both countries because the world oil market is one great pool. 
Threats to supply in any place make it scarce and high priced in every place. 

   There is, however, a delicious unintended irony in the statement of "U.S. energy officials . . . {not} yet suggesting that Venezuelan oil imports be increased." 
It's time they learned that it's not for them to suggest anything. 
Nobody is listening, and oil exporters will export only enough to maximize their revenues, as best they can guess them.
