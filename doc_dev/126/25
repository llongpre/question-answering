   A military transport plane crashed and
exploded in the hills west of the capital shortly after takeoff
Tuesday morning, killing all 24 people aboard, officials said.
   Investigators said fog and rain was probably to blame for the
crash of the Spanish-built twin-engine Aviocar, which was carrying
13 Venezuelan navy men, eight civilians and three crew.
   Rescue officials said the craft, en route to a port on the
Orinoco River, crashed just outside the hamlet of La Sabaneta
(Little Blanket) 15 miles west of Caracas.
   The pilot apparently was able to maneuver the plane at the last
moment to crash in a deserted area rather than strike houses in the
poor neighborhood, according to preliminary reports by Civil
Defense officials.
   The airplane had just taken off from Caracas's Simon Bolivar
International Airport on a flight to Puerto Ayacucho, on the
Orinoco 400 miles south of Caracas. The military personnel were to
serve at an outpost near the Brazilian border.
   ``With the fog in those hills, it must have been hard for them,
even with radar,'' said Antonio Vargas, an official with civil
defense crews working in the clean-up operation.
   A man living nearby said the plane was ``flying low. ... It
didn't sound like motor trouble.''
   Residents rushed to the scene but the flames and repeated
explosions kept them from approaching the plane. Firefighters
quickly extinguished the blaze.
   So far, 19 bodies have been recovered by rescue workers, most of
them burned beyond recognition, officials said. Among the bodies
were two women and a child, presumably military dependents.
   ``We brought three ambulances up here immediately, but all we've
found are corpses,'' said Mercedes Vivas, a doctor with Caracas
firefighters.
   National guard troops, firefighters and police rescue workers
combed the rubble.
   Military and civilian officials are not expected to determine
the official cause of the accident for several days, said Vargas,
but nearly all speculation points to bad weather as the culprit, he
added.
   The Caracas area has been shrouded in heavy fog and rain the
last three days due to an unusual low pressure system over the
area, according to the Observatorio Cajigal, a local meteorological
station.
