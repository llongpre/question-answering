   WASHINGTON -- Venezuela approved two new aluminum smelter
projects -- Orinoco Holding and Aluyana -- involving about
$2.1 billion in investments and authorized $585 million of
debt-for-equity swaps to help finance both projects.
   The Venezuelan government is aggressively trying to
develop its aluminum production. Earlier this year, it
authorized debt-equity financing to help finance increased
production at two other projects.

   Altogether, the four projects should increase aluminum
production to about 1.6 million metric tons annually by 1995
from a current level of about 630,000 tons, according to the
Venezuelan government.
   The $297 million in debt-for-equity financing for the
Orinoco project will be organized by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
the government said. The $288 million of debt-for-equity
financing in the Aluyana project will be organized by a unit
of BankAmerica Corp., it said.
