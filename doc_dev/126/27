<F P=106> [Article by Maria Helena Tachinardi from La Guaira, </F>
Venezuela] 
  [Text] On 4 March, at the presidential summer residence "La 
Guzmania" near Caracas, Brazilian President Itamar Franco and 
his Venezuelan counterpart Rafael Caldera created a high-level 
binational commission that will be subdivided into various work 
groups to deal with the following issues: 
  -- Conclude the pavement of the BR 174 highway, and expand 
the agreement on land transportation. Brazil will pave 200 km 
of the highway linking Boa Vista with Santa Elena de Uairen. 
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said Venezuela could 
cooperate by supplying the asphalt. 
  -- The electric sector: Brazil will purchase energy from 
Venezuela and will build the transmission lines. Interim Mines 
and Energy Minister Jose Israel Vargas said the idea is to get 
electricity for Manaus from the Guri electric plant. He also 
said discussions are being held for an exchange between Guri and 
the Balbina hydroelectric plant, because the two countries have 
weather problems. 
  -- The hydrographic sector: study the possibility of 
navigation between the Orinoco and Amazon river basins. 
President Franco said during a news conference that he 
discussed with President Caldera the interconnection of the 
Orinoco and Amazon river basins, which have an extension of 
approximately 11,000 km. The studies began in 1943. Franco 
said that what the two governments have in mind is to continue 
the studies with the objective of "reaching the River Plate 
basin." 
  -- The mineral sector: The two governments will study the 
possibility of carrying out compatible joint projects regarding 
sustainable development and the protection of the indigenous 
communities. The cooperation agreement signed in 1991 between 
the Rio Doce Valley Company (CVRD) and the Venezuelan 
Corporation of Guayana (CVG) will be useful for the development 
of such projects. Israel Vargas commented that the two countries 
are studying the possibility of using manganese from Carajas in 
Venezuelan electric furnaces. The objective is to produce iron 
alloys for the Venezuelan steel industry. He also reported that 
studies are being made for joint gold prospecting, to develop 
the border regions and employ gold prospectors in legal and 
orderly activities. 
  -- The environmental sector: joint development of ecological 
tourism, scientific research on biodiversity, and cooperation 
for recovering the deteriorated areas caused by illegal mining. 
The illegal activities in the border regions were mentioned in 
the joint communique signed by the two presidents. It says: 
"The presidents agreed on the need to fight any illegal 
activities on their common border with determination. With that 
objective they commit themselves to the reinforcement of 
appropriate measures for the eradication of illegal mineral 
prospecting in the border zones, and to carry out an effective 
control over the use of equipment and other components used in 
prospecting that contribute to the depredation and contamination 
of the environment." 
  Bolivar State Governor Andres Velasco of the Radical Cause, 
a 
leftist party that came out third in last year's presidential 
elections, said: "The Brazilian Government must reverse its 
position regarding the gold prospectors." He also said the gold 
prospectors are involved in drug trafficking. He added: "It is 
possible they are also being used by the multinationals as 
spearheads for mineral prospecting." 
  -- The Sivam [Amazon Region Surveillance System] project: 
The Venezuelan Government is studying Brazilian participation 
in carrying out ecological-economic zoning. 
  -- The hemispheric summit: The two presidents expressed 
their hopes for the upcoming summit, to be held in the United 
States this year. The two countries will make joint efforts to 
have the agenda reflect an effective hemispheric consensus. 
  -- Economic complementation agreement: The two governments 
will expedite negotiations for reaching an agreement within the 
framework of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI). 
"Such an agreement could also include, in addition to the 
reduction of trade barriers, incentive measures for border 
trade, for promoting investment protection, for facilitating the 
trade of services, for protecting intellectual property, and 
regulations for preventing unfair competition and access to 
public biddings."
