<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM has agreed with Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA to
bring the Pedernales oilfield in the Orinoco delta back into production. The
field has been shut since 1985. BP believes it can bring it back into
production soon with output rising to 20,000 b/d by 1997.
The agreement marks the first upstream involvement of a foreign oil company
in Venezuela since 1976.
