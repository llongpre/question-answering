  [Text] Brazilian President Itamar Franco and Venezuelan 
President Rafael Caldera agreed, during a meeting held at La 
Guzmania presidential residence, to increase bilateral 
cooperation and fully use consultation and political dialogue 
mechanisms. 
  The two presidents decided to create a high-level binational 
commission that will be chaired by their foreign ministers and 
comprised of the ministers in charge of bilateral cooperation 
issues. The presidents also agreed to hold the second meeting 
of the Venezuela-Brazil political consultation mechanism in our 
country. Furthermore, they issued instructions to authorities 
in the foreign trade sector to assess and step up the 
negotiations to reach an economic complementation agreement 
within the ALADI [Latin American Integration Association] 
framework. 
  Even though no agreements were signed in the meeting, it 
helped establish the groundwork for common projects in different 
sectors. In the highway sector they agreed to finish highway 
BR-174 and to broaden a land transportation agreement. In the 
electric sector they reached an agreement for the purchase of 
Venezuelan energy. In the hydrographic sector the topic was 
navigability between the Orinoco and Amazon Rivers. In the 
mining sector they will work jointly to protect Indians at the 
border area. In the ecology sector the issue was ecological 
tourism in a joint action to recover areas degraded by illegal 
miners. In the steel works sector the SIDOR [Orinoco Iron and 
Steel Works] furnaces will manufacture iron and manganese alloys. 
  Later, during a news conference, the Brazilian president 
said 
his government is carefully analyzing border problems with our 
country, adding that neither Venezuela nor Brazil should neglect 
looking into these issues because they might cause an atmosphere 
of uncertainty in the relations between the two nations. 
Moreover, President Rafael Caldera said that following the 
talks with his counterpart he is fully convinced the current 
Brazilian Government is clearly inclined to adopt the necessary 
measures to prevent illegal mining on Venezuelan territory. 
  [Begin recording] [Franco, in Portuguese] It is clear that 
the border problem between Brazil and Venezuela will be 
carefully analyzed. We have a very extensive border with 
Venezuela, a border that was abandoned by our peoples. Now with 
the presence of President Rafael Caldera and with the presence 
of the Brazilian Government, we will be able to study and 
carefully analyze those aspects which today cause problems in 
our relations. 
  [Caldera] I am fully convinced that the current Brazilian 
Government is clearly inclined to adopt all the measures 
possible to prevent the garimpeiros' [Brazilian gold seekers] 
illegal mining activities in Venezuela -- both by watching the 
border and by adopting precautionary measures in the State of 
Roraima and other border states where they may have their 
operations centers and by enforcing legal measures through 
Brazilian courts against those who have perpetrated illegal 
actions in this area. [end recording] 
  Referring to the first meeting held between the heads of 
state of Venezuela and Brazil, Gilberto [as heard] Poletto, 
minister of state and president of the Foreign Trade Institute, 
and Andres Velasquez, governor of Bolivar State, agreed that new 
roads have been opened to strengthen bilateral relations. 
  [Begin recording] [Poletto] There was talk about stepping up 
the negotiations to sign an economic cooperation agreement 
between Venezuela and Brazil because this had been discussed a 
couple of years ago. This will bolster the partial agreement we 
currently have, perhaps by adding more products and including 
some additional norms. The goal is to consolidate and improve 
trade relations between Venezuela and Brazil, which have 
recently increased but are still insufficient compared with the 
immense possibilities we have in different trade sectors. 
  [Velasquez] Specifically referring to the Brazilians' case, 
I have had the opportunity to discuss a specific proposal. All 
the agreements that the Venezuelan Government has to establish 
with the Brazilian Government should include a specific 
agreement with the Roraima State Government, because we believe 
Roraima State has become an excellent supply center, or 
logistics support center, for illegal miners, meaning the 
garimpeiros. In addition, this has to be discussed at length 
because the latest information we have, based on investigations 
that have been conducted, is that the garimpeiros are not just 
involved in illegal gold mining activities. They also act as 
scouts and guard beachheads for drug trafficking activities, and 
the illegal landing strips built by them are later used for drug 
trafficking. [end recording]
