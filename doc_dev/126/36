  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15 
March. 
  Orinoco Iron and Steel Works, Sidor, and Colombian Steel 
Works Corporation, Acesco, signed an agreement allowing Sidor to 
open an office in Bogota. According to Sidor, Colombia is one of 
the corporation's main sheet metal customers, and "having an 
office in Bogota will allow Sidor to compete with similar 
suppliers from Japan and Brazil." Company officials reported 
that "this agreement is part of the overall economic integration 
process." (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 10 Mar 94 p E11) 
  Overall exports dropped 53.2 percent in January compared 
with 
January 1993. The Central Statistics and Data Processing Office, 
OCEI, reports that exports totalled $414 million. Meanwhile, 
imports fell 43.3 percent for the same period. Experts said 
"Venezuela's 1993 economic situation was the worst in recent 
years." Inflation closed at 50 percent for the year, the bolivar 
was devaluated 35 percent, and the deficit hit 3 percent of the 
GNP. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0006 GMT 10 Mar 94) 
  Nontraditional exports to the United States increased 27.6 
percent during 1993 while imports fell 8 percent. The Foreign 
Trade Institute (ICE) and OCEI reported that the United States 
purchased products worth $746.3 million in 1993, which is 23.1 
percent of total Venezuelan nontraditional exports. Imports from 
the United States dropped about $444.3 million, although such 
transactions totalled 12.13 percent of Venezuelan exports in 
general. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in Spanish 11 Mar 94 p 
15] 
  Fedecamaras, Venezuelan Federation of Associations and 
Chambers of Commerce and Industry, has issued its monthly 
inflation report. The study shows that inflation dropped in 
February to 1.9 percent, a 55.8 percent decrease from January 
1994 and 26.9 percent less than February 1993. The main 
contributors were home expenditures, clothing, and food and 
drink. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 12 Mar 94 p E10) 
  Following congressional approval of the Emergency Banking 
Law, the finance commission approved the Public Credit Bill, 
which will fund the former. Acting Finance Minister Luis 
Grisanti said the bill "will not have inflationary effects and 
will not force the Central Bank of Venezuela to print money 
without appropriate reserve funds." He stressed the need to 
restore financial equilibrium, as "solving the financial 
difficulties of several Venezuelan banks is closely related to 
the process of restoring trust." He added that "this will in 
fact bring down inflation, reduce the exchange rate, and cut 
interest rates." (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network in 
Spanish 0000 GMT 13 Mar 94) 
  Nonpetroleum product exports to Andean countries increased 
in 
the last five years from $190 million to $862 million. ICE said 
"this figure is unprecedented in the trade relations among the 
region's countries." Sales to the Andean countries totaled 10.5 
percent of Venezuela's total exports in 1988 and rose to 26.3 
percent in 1993. The main items exported to the region are 
aluminum, urea, cane sugar, polyesters, coal, antibiotics, and 
other medicines. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2241 GMT 14 Mar 94)
