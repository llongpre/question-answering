  [Excerpt] The two major projects to modernize and expand 
the production capacity of the Amuay and Cardon refineries, 
which will make it possible to increase production of 
reformulated gasoline by 100,000 barrels per day, call for 
investment of 130 billion bolivars this year, according to a 
PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum, Inc.] report which includes 
additional information about other aspects of this industry in 
Venezuela. 
  The report says: "The dynamics of the market for 
hydrocarbons, the new environmental regulations of the 
industrialized countries, and the premise that we will continue 
to be a top oil-producing country lead PDVSA to continue to plan 
considerable investments in the medium and long term to upgrade 
its national refineries in order to adapt the variety of refined 
products Venezuela sells to the changing demands of the world 
market." 
  In most industrialized countries, the governments have 
established deadlines for compliance with environmental 
protection standards without reducing gasoline octane ratings. 
In view of these standards, PDVSA's operating subsidiaries are 
carrying out an investment plan to ensure the quality required 
on our markets. Among their projects are the El Palito 
oxigenates plant, which came into operation in 1993, and the 
plant that is being built in Cardon. These plants will permit 
exports of reformulated gasoline to the United States beginning 
in 1995. 
  The investments, which are around 130 billion bolivars in 
Venezuela in 1994, are focused mainly on the Cardon Upgrading 
Project (PARC) and the Amuay Delayed Coker (CRAY). These 
projects will contribute to increasing the processing capacity 
for heavy crudes in Venezuela's current refineries by 100,000 
barrels per day by 1995, while at the same time reducing 
residual fuel production by about 25,000 barrels per day in 
comparison with 1994 production. [passage omitted]
