    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 19 
April. 
  A study by oil specialist Leonardo Montiel Ortega indicates 
Venezuelan refineries overseas, far from being profit makers, 
produce net losses of more than $96.3 million. These losses are 
due to the $.86 price differential at which Venezuela sells its 
crude to the refinery Citgo in the United States. Venezuela 
dispatched to that refinery 305,000 barrels during 1993, at an 
average price of $13.01 a barrel, while the average price for 
Venezuelan crude was $13.87. In addition, this refinery does not 
process heavy oils, resulting in diminished Venezuelan sale 
possibilities. Montiel recommends these loss makers be sold. 
(Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 11 April 1994 p 1-21] 
  Mexico is backing Venezuela' efforts to get the 
Brussels-based Customs Affairs Council to accept its Oremulsion 
as a bituminous oil and thus avoid tariff difficulties in world 
markets. Venezuela has no vote or veto power in the council and 
has enlisted Mexico's assistance. Venezuelan Petroleum President 
Luis Giusti estimates Venezuelan oil will fetch $10.50 a barrel, 
but he did not rule out the possibility of reaching $11.50, the 
budgeted amount for 1994. A recent decision by the European 
Union Nomenclature Committee classified Oremulsion as a bitumen 
(Code 2714), which increases the possibility of placing greater 
volumes of oil on the world market. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in 
Spanish 14 April 94 E-8) 
  The Council of Ministers approved an initiative on 13 April 
to raise urban minimum wages to 15,000 bolivares, 12,500 
bolivares in rural areas. Observers believe, considering the 
state of the Venezuelan economy and the constant protests by the 
public and private sector, this increase in the minimum wage 
will be well received. An important aspect of this decree, which 
was not disclosed to the media because certain adjustments were 
still pending at the time of approval, is that only 30 percent 
of the increase will be used as a base rate to estimate 
contributions to social security, a possibility already 
anticipated in Articles 138 and 171 of the Labor Code. (Caracas 
ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 14 April 94 p. 3)
