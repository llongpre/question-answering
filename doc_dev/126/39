   A South Carolina newsprint manufacturer
is planning a joint venture with a Canadian company to build and
manage a $350 million newsprint plant in northeast Venezuela,
officials say.
   Bowater Inc., whose pulp and paper group is headquartered in
Greenville, is working on an agreement with Abitibi-Price Corp. of
Toronto that should be completed this month.
   Bowater and Abitibi-Price each will control 24.25 percent of the
plant, and the Venezuelan government will control the rest, said
Bowater spokesman Arthur King.
   ``This is a project that the Venezuelan government has been
looking at for years,'' King said. ``By making newsprint there,
they can take the wood and power that they have in profusion and
are currently not using, and turn it into another export product _
something besides oil _ which they need desperately for foreign
exchange in Venezuela.''
   The new plant will be in Ciudad Guyana, on the Orinoco River in
northeast Venezuela, which is surrounded by acres of Caribbean
pine, and close to Guri Dam, one of the world's largest generators
of hydroelectric power.
   Plaza said after the one-machine mill begins operating sometime
in 1992, it will produce about 200,000 tons of newsprint per year
and employ about 350 people.
   All but about 40,000 tons of the newsprint will be exported to
customers worldwide, Plaza said, and though Bowater's share will be
nominal, it is expected to significantly boost the company's
exports, which have fallen off in recent years.
   ``They used to be a fairly good-sized exporter, but more
recently they've downsized their export exposure,'' said Mark
Diverio, a pulp and paper analyst who follows Bowater for Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc.
   The biggest reason for the drop in exports was the 1984 sale of
Bowater Newfoundland Ltd., a wholly owned plant in Canada that
produced much of the company's newsprint for export, Diverio said.
