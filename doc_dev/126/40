   Venezuela ordered the state-owned oil
monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) to start placing extra
petroleum on the market, company president Arturo Sosa Pietri said
Thursday.
   He said PDVSA was ordered Wednesday afternoon by the government
to begin selling additional oil above the country's OPEC quota of
1.94 million barrels per day.
   At a ceremony to celebrate the oil monopoly's 15th anniversary,
he also hinted that Venezuela's oil supply should be considered as
an energy alternative to oil from the Middle East.
   ``Industrialized nations will not tolerate again a growing
dependence on Middle East oil,'' he said.
   Also Thursday, Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez called
for foreign investment in Venezuelan oil, and said he would call a
congressional session to review nationalization laws that keep oil
firmly under government control.
   ``We must think of the capacity of foreign and domestic capital
to expand these petroleum industries, especially in petrochemicals
and oil refining,'' Perez said in a speech.
   The order to sell more petroleum coincided with a decision by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to place more oil
on the market to offset the loss caused by the embargo against oil
from Iraq and Kuwait. About 4 million barrels per day were lost
after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Sosa Pietri told The Associated Press that Brazil and Spain will
each receive 50,000 barrels per day of Venezuela's additional
crude, while India would receive 10,000 barrels per day and the
United States would receive 200,000 barrels.
   Industry analysts estimate Venezuela is now producing 100,000 to
150,000 barrels above its quota. Authorities have said the country
plans to sell up to 500,000 barrels above its quota by the end of
the year.
   In an address, he said the company plans to export nearly 2.5
million barrels per day by 1993. That would bring Venezuela oil
income to $15 billion per year, up from $11 billion estimated for
this year.
   ``The ongoing situation ... affirms Venezuela as a sure and
trustworthy oil supplier for industrial nations,'' he said in a
speech that presented Venezuela as a possible energy alternative to
Middle East oil.
   ``Our clients will prefer our crudes or our refined products
despite the fact that our oil is of a quality inferior to that of
the Middle East,'' he said.
