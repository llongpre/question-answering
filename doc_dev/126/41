   The Kruegers of Michigan, having
paddled their own canoes through Arctic ice and past Amazon
alligators, pushed off Monday on the homestretch of their
21,000-mile journey to the tip of South America.
   Verlen Krueger, 66, and his wife Valerie, 37, began their
``two-continent canoe expedition'' on June 8, 1986, about 200 miles
north of the Arctic Circle and hope to finish in February at Punta
Arenas, Chile.
   ``I've always had this in me, wanting to be an explorer like
Christopher Columbus or Daniel Boone,'' said Verlen Krueger, a
former farmer and plumber who built the two 17-foot canoes in his
garage at Lansing.
   Michigan is paying some expenses of the 2{-year trip as part of
the celebration of its 150th birthday. The Kruegers agreed to
collect rain and river water for research by two chemical
companies, and another company provided freeze-dried food.
   The two have paddled the icy waters of Canada's MacKenzie River
and through the Great Lakes, ridden the currents of the Maumee,
Wabash and Tennessee rivers and coasted down the Tom Bigbee
Waterway into the Gulf of Mexico at Mobile, Ala.
   ``There were no precedents for us at all,'' said Krueger, who
has covered much of the United States on canoe trips.
   He and his wife rigged their two canoes into a catamaran and
paddled 2,300 miles across the Caribbean, island-hopping from the
Bahamas to the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the West Indies.
They entered South America in Venezuela's Orinoco River.
   In the Bahamas, the canoes were surrounded by 3-foot-long
iguanas, fierce-looking but harmless.
   Alligators and howler monkeys abounded in the Amazon. ``We saw
hundreds of alligators,'' Verlen said. ``They have a disconcerting
way of entering the water to get away and it looks like they are
coming right at you.''
   The Kruegers said they do not speak Spanish but managed to get
along by using a dictionary, hand signals and ``smiling a lot.''
   One high navy official in Venezuela issued an order ``that if
anyone should see us, they should take care of us and feed us,''
said Valerie Krueger, a former technical assistant to a geologist.
   ``Our secret is that with a woman and a man with a gray beard,
nobody feels threatened by us,'' she said. As for illnesses, ``We
don't have time to get sick,'' she said, and added: ``The only
thing that really became a problem other than our sanity and legs
was that our soap bars kept falling overboard.''
   During a brief portage in Brazil between the Orinoco and an
Amazon tributary, an army captain was so impressed by the voyage
that he played them a tune on an instrument resembling a ukelele.
   They had to paddle 200 miles upstream on the Paraguay River in
Brazil because high winds had blown water plants into a solid mass
that blocked their path, and later spent 17 days without touching
shore on the same river because of floods.
   From the Arctic Circle to Asuncion they logged more than 17,000
miles, leaving about 4,000 miles to go around Cape Horn to Punta
Arenas. It was sunny, but chilly, on Monday when about 100
well-wishers saw them off.
   Their planned route is down the Paraguay, south on the Parana to
Buenos Aires, then down Argentina's Atlantic Coast to the Straits
of Magellan and around the cape to Punta Arenas.
