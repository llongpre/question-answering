<F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F>
  [Text] The failure of shareholders to make the capital 
investments required to undertake new projects and expand 
others, and the management's inability to make the necessary 
corrections to adapt to new market conditions are the main 
causes of the deep crisis that has the basic enterprises in the 
Venezuelan Corporation of Guayana (CVG) holding company on the 
verge of collapse. 
  This assessment can be deduced from the report by an ad hoc 
congressional committee that looked into the financial 
statements of the enterprises from 1987 to 1992. The committee 
was chaired by Deputy Ramon Jose Medina, who was accompanied by 
Abdon Vivas Teran (the current minister president of the FIV 
[Venezuelan Investment Fund]), Gustavo Marquez, Freddy Lepage, 
Rafael Rodriguez Acosta, Amarilis Valor, Ildemaro Martinez, and 
Margot Siso. 
  The study, which focused on the aluminum and iron and steel 
industries, concluded that the CVG enterprises are in critical 
condition, some of them technically bankrupt, such as Alcasa, 
with liabilities more than double their assets. 
<H5>  Properly Planned Privatization </H5>
  The drafters of the report evaluate each of the six 
enterprises in the aluminum and iron and steel industries 
separately but offer overall conclusions and recommendations 
that are valid for them all. 
  They blame the CVG, as the agency that promotes the region's 
industrial development and as a major shareholder in the 
enterprises, for having spurred new projects and expanded 
existing ones without the capital investments by shareholders 
needed to complete them. 
  Most of the time these funds were not forthcoming, according 
to one of the conclusions, and other times they arrived 
belatedly. As a result, the enterprises had to resort urgently 
to short- and long-term borrowing, which in turn has meant huge 
financial costs for them, with the resulting damage to the 
industries' capital resources. 
<H5>  Aluminum Sector in Danger </H5>
  The report notes that the enterprises in the aluminum sector 
are in a critical, perilous condition owing to the steady 
decline in international prices, which has seriously disrupted 
their operations. This, along with the failure to recognize the 
industries' external debts and the sharp rise in international 
interest rates, explains the magnitude of the crisis. 
  Maintaining operating efficiency until 1989 and closing down 
inefficient, obsolete production lines were necessary steps. 
Today they are indispensable. 
  In another regard, the report says that now that the 
government has capitalized 60 percent of the SIDOR [Orinoco Iron 
and Steelworks] debt, the iron and steel sector is in less 
danger and its financial indices reflect reasonably good 
performance; as a result, its problems are altogether manageable. 
  In conclusion, it states that privatization should not be 
viewed dogmatically, arguing that although it is not a panacea 
for the problems of the CVG enterprises, it should not be 
regarded as harmful to the national interest either. 
<H5>  Alcasa [Caroni Aluminum, Inc.] </H5>
  This enterprise has structural problems, as reflected in the 
fact that its manufacturing costs stand at some 18.06 billion 
bolivars while its sales are around 17.6 billion. 
  It also faces a serious insolvency problem, as it has a 
working capital deficit of 21.1 billion bolivars, which is 
equivalent to more than 14 months of sales. 
  This enterprise, the report finds, is technically bankrupt 
unless shareholders give it fresh infusions of investment 
capital. In practice, Alcasa's creditors own it, and unless an 
estimated $300 million in investments is forthcoming, the best 
option is to close it down. 
<H5>  Venalum [Aluminum Company of Venezuela, Inc.] </H5>
  Venalum also has structural problems, as its manufacturing 
costs stand at 97.3 bolivars for every 100 in sales. 
  Its debt amounts to 44.6 billion bolivars, with assets of 
63.9 billion, a ratio of 0.7 to 1, which can be regarded as very 
sound financially. 
<H5>  Interalumina </H5>
  Its manufacturing costs were equivalent to 83 percent of 
costs in 1992, a very high ratio (it should not be more than 70 
percent). 
  The enterprise is reasonably solvent, with working capital 
of 
around 7.7 billion bolivars, although the reducers have a 15 
billion bolivar debt that they would seem unable to pay back in 
the short run. 
<H5>  Bauxiven [Venezuelan Bauxite, Inc.] </H5>
  As of December 1992 this project required 23 billion in 
investments, and only 4.5 billion was forthcoming. As a result, 
it is beginning operations with a heavy financial burden and a 
high indebtedness index. 
  It is failing to comply with the IDB and FIV financing 
agreements. 
<H5>  SIDOR </H5>
  Its manufacturing costs have remained very high, reaching 90 
percent of sales in 1992. 
  Its current ratio during the years under study can be 
considered reasonable, and its working capital as of the end of 
1992 was 27.5 billion bolivars. 
  The government's capitalization of its debt obviously 
improved its debt ratio. 
<H5>  Ferrominera </H5>
  Its manufacturing costs rose from 50 to 60 percent of sales. 
This means that cutbacks have to be made in order to reverse the 
trend back to 40 percent, which would be acceptable for this 
mining firm. 
  Its debt ratio stood at 2.69 in 1992, and the enterprise's 
current ratio is slightly worse.
