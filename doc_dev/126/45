   Alarmed over falling oil prices, Venezuela officially called for a meeting of the pricing committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 

   The request for such a meeting, which had been expected, came amid growing concern over weakening oil markets and, in some cases, outright resentment of OPEC. Mexico, which isn't a member but has supported OPEC policies in the past, turned sharply critical. 
"OPEC has demonstrated, once again, its inability to stabilize the market and maintain prices," Notimex, the official news agency of Mexico, said yesterday. 

   In Caracas, oil officials confirmed that Venezuela, a member of the pricing group, sent messages requesting the meeting to the four others on the committee: Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Algeria and Indonesia. 
"We are making this call because we consider that the market situation has characteristics of alarm," Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, Venezuela's oil minister, said. 
He said a date for the meeting of the five-minister pricing committee wouldn't be set until the others responded to the Venezuelan request. 

   The pricing committee is charged by OPEC with monitoring world oil prices. 
It cannot take official action on its own, but it is authorized to call a special meeting of all 13 ministers of OPEC for possible changes in the exporters' official pricing structure and production quotas. 

   Some OPEC sources are skeptical that a full ministerial meeting will be held before a previously scheduled July conference even if the pricing group calls for one -- largely because of Saudi Arabia's opposition to any special session. 
But some sources said the Saudis might drop their opposition if prices stayed below $15. 

   Currently, world oil prices generally range between $14 and $15 a barrel. 
Some prices have plunged as much as $4 a barrel since mid-December, when officials at OPEC's winter meeting seemed unable to come to grips with excess production by member nations in the face of high oil inventories. 

   Some crude oil traders said that a possible meeting of OPEC's pricing committee could have a firming effect on the market. 
But prices on spot and futures markets softened further yesterday. 
On the U.S. futures market, West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $15.35 a barrel, down 25 cents. 

   Also, according to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, Petroleos de Venezuela notified U.S. customers that export prices of its heavy crudes, which are excluded from OPEC's pricing system, have been reduced between 68 cents and $1.90 a barrel. 
Venezuela's export price of its benchmark heavy crude, Bachaquero 17, was cut $1 to $11.20 a barrel.
