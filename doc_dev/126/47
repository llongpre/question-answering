   Abitibi-Price Inc. said it tentatively agreed with Bowater Inc. and Venezuelan investors to build and operate a newsprint mill in Venezuela. 

   Abitibi said the proposed mill on the Orinoco River near Ciudad Guayana would be about 49%-owned by Abitibi and Darien, Conn.-based Bowater, both major producers of newsprint; 36% by the Venezuelan government; and 15% by Gruprensa, a group of Venezuelan publishers. 

   A spokeswoman for Abitibi said the mill is expected to cost $350 million to $450 million, depending on exchange rates and inflation. 
She said financing is still under negotiation. 

   Abitibi said the proposed mill would have capacity of 200,000 metric tons annually from one machine, and be designed so a second machine could be added at a later date. 
It said Bowater and Abitibi would oversee construction and operate the mill. 
It said most of the newsprint would be exported and marketed by Bowater and Abitibi. 

   Abitibi said a letter of intent was signed by the participants yesterday. 
It said the agreement is subject to various conditions, including financing and approval by the boards of the participating companies. 

   The mill would be Abitibi's first venture outside North America, the spokeswoman said. 

   Bowater confirmed that Venezuela requested it and Abitibi to become joint technical partners in the project.
