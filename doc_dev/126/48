  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored by Panama 
Bureau through 17 January; source follows in parentheses after 
each item. 
  Health and Development Ministry sources reported on 11 
January that medicine prices will be controlled. Prices 
skyrocketed--some increased by 200 percent in certain 
cases--after the announcement of implementation of the value 
added tax. Prices will be set at December 1993 levels, 
following an agreement with pharmaceutical industry 
representatives. The government also placed 10 staple items 
under price control to prevent further speculation. (Paris AFP

  Venezuelan Petroleum, Petroven, plans to invest 140 billion 
bolivares in the refining field. The budget includes 120 
million bolivares, which will be channeled to the Amuay and 
Cardon Refineries. Gustavo Roosen, Petroven president, has 
announced that Venezuelan refineries have processed an average 
of 949,000 barrels per day. Amuay has 440,000 barrels, and 
Cardon processed 265,000 barrels per day. Investments in 
refining installations totaled 80 billion bolivares in 1993. 
(Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 14) 
  The Energy and Mines Ministry has reported that the mining 
industry has extracted products worth 74.8 billion bolivares, 
including gold, steel, diamonds, coal, bauxite, granite, marble, 
phosphate and other minerals. Steel topped the list with 33.4 
billion bolivares for its 20.5 million metric tons. Gold and 
diamonds each produced 9.1 billion bolivares; coal produced 
10.65 billion bolivares, and bauxite registered 5.83 billion 
bolivares. Foreign currency influx totaled $1.3 billion, while 
expenditures totaled $930 million. The difference, $384 
million, is a considerable increase over 1992's $93 million. 
(Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 14) 
  The government has reported paying 116 billion bolivares to 
the national debt. Finance Ministry officials have issued a 
report stating that 88.6 billion bolivares went to capital 
payment and the remainder went to interest and service payments. 
Despite the payment, the national debt grew by 84 million 
bolivares, however, to 219.579 billion bolivares. (Caracas EL 
GLOBO in Spanish 13 Jan 94 p 10) 
  Maraven, a subsidiary of Petroven, reported shipping 256.7 
million barrels of crude oil during 1993, of which 152 million 
barrels were shipped abroad, and 100 million barrels were sent 
to the Cardon Refinery. Despite repair and remodeling work at 
its Miranda Port facilities, the corporation has stated that it 
met its storage and shipping goals for the year. According to 
management spokespersons, this volume sets a record in the 
corporation's 34 years of operations. (Caracas EL GLOBO in 
Spanish 14 Jan 94 p 14) 
  Despite the weakening international oil market, the 
Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation has reported income of $2.5 
billion during 1993. Corpoven listed exports of 653,000 barrels 
per day of crude oil and refined products. Corpoven has 
announced that it had successfully managed to sell oxygenated 
gasolines to the demanding U.S. market, which made 1993 an 
especially productive year. (Caracas Venezolana de Television 
Network in Spanish 1550 GMT 14 Jan 94)
