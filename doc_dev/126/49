As the world struggles to resolve the gulf crisis, Venezuela's big new problem 
is what to do with a windfall of petrodollars. 
</P>
<P>
And Venezuelans are debating what to do with the money -- whether to pay off 
their debt or invest in social programs to ease the heavy burden of the 
country's austerity measures. 
</P>
<P>
Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the Western world. Within 
three weeks of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, oil platforms in Lake Maracaibo were 
pumping 350,000 more barrels a day. By year's end, output will rise to 500,000 
barrels a day above the country's previous quota of 1.9 million barrels a day, 
as set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
</P>
<P>
"We will gain an extra $1.2 billion to $2.4 billion in oil revenues this year," 
said Celestino Armas, Venezuela's oil minister. Venezuela stands to gain $1 
billion a year for every $1 a barrel rise in wholesale prices, say officials of 
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state-run oil company. 
</P>
<P>
This privileged situation has raised the expectations of the average 
Venezuelan, whose pocketbook has been hit by government austerity measures and 
unemployment. Last year, Venezuela's economy shrank 8%, overall unemployment 
reached 10%, and inflation was cut to 30% from 85% a year ago, the Ministry of 
Finance said. Union leaders say 500,000 people have lost jobs. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, the standoff in the gulf is a blessing," said Pedro Ibarra, a Caracas 
shoe store owner. "The question we are all asking ourselves is: What is the 
government going to do with the oil bonus?" 
</P>
<P>
The government is "debating what to do with the extra funds," said Marcos 
Morales, who leads an economic policy team. "We don't want to count our eggs 
before they hatch. We remain cautious. You never know what the price of oil 
will be tomorrow." Morales, however, thinks the windfall will wipe out the $1 
billion 1990 budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
In street markets, government offices and newspapers, three options are talked 
about: paying off debt to stabilize the economy; reinvesting in the state-run 
oil company to expand oil production; or investing in social programs to ease 
the burden of austerity. Advocates of paying off Venezuela's foreign debt 
include businessmen and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
"The debt is the heaviest burden we have ever suffered in our history," said 
Sen. Pedro Paris Montesinos. In mid-August, private banks cut Venezuela's 
foreign debt by 20% to $18 billion, and debt payments were cut by 50%. In 
return, the government will continue austerity rules that help it pay. Still, 
Venezuela faces annual payments of up to $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"The gulf crisis is a bonanza," said businessman Jose Marquez. "But in the long 
haul, paying off the debt will guarantee that, no matter what happens to the 
price of the barrel, our economy will be at last stabilized." 
</P>
<P>
Others believe improving the state-run oil company is as important as fixing 
the economy. "We have a very ambitious plan," said PDVSA's Paul Reimpell. "We 
are going to operate at full capacity in the coming year and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
From the wellhead to the gas pump, improvement efforts are under way, oil 
company officials say. But money is needed to reactivate 13,000 idle wells to 
meet demand. About 80% of company earnings goes to the government, with 20% 
reinvested, Reimpell said. Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez has said 
some oil bonus money may be used to expand production, some of it for a 
rainy-day fund. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, however, say Perez wants to overexpand production to satisfy Third 
World countries and boost his image as a spokesman for the developing world -- 
a role he played as president in the 1970s. Under a 10-year deal between 
Venezuela, Mexico and others, Venezuela has been selling oil at $17 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
But some at home wonder why Perez does not solve their many problems. "We 
demand water, electricity, a better health system, and an end to the rise in 
prices," said Marcos Fiel Loaiza, a social activist. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Perez's new austerity measures sparked riots that killed 300 and 
injured 1,000. The Perez free-market plan abolished price controls, reduced 
government subsidies, freed exchange rates and moved to privatize state-run 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered street protests have erupted over plans to raise gas prices from 26 
to 28 cents a gallon. In slums in the city, water shortages have led to 
demonstrations. Simmering discontent was evident in a recent poll. Sixty-five 
percent of 1,500 respondents thought the economy would worsen, and 53% 
disapproved of Perez's leadership. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same old story," said Fiel Loaiza. "We live in a country rich in oil 
and natural resources and somehow the benefits of our national wealth never 
trickled down to the people."
