The Venezuelan government announced a single exchange rate of 170 bolivars
to the US dollar late on Tuesday, following more than a week of
deliberations on new foreign exchange controls.
On June 23, the last day of trading, the bolivar stood at about 200:Dollars
1, down from 106 at the end of 1993.
The imposition of exchange controls came after months of heavy pressure on
Venezuela's international reserves, caused by a crisis in the banking
system, much rumour and a marked deterioration in the economy.
Announcing the controls, Mr Julio Sosa, finance minister, said he hoped they
would be temporary. They would be accompanied by a series of macroeconomic
measures aimed to balance the 1994 and 1995 budgets, he said, giving no
details.
The government had rejected the idea of a parallel free market in foreign
exchange, he said, because it feared 'destabilising agents' would create an
unacceptable gap between the official rate and the parallel rate. Any
foreign exchange trading outside the official system would be illegal and
subject to penalties, he warned.
The controls will cover imports, expenses of Venezuelan students abroad,
external debt payments for the public and the private sector, spending by
travellers, and 'small remittances' by foreigners in Venezuela to relatives
abroad.
Officials stressed that the government would meet all international
commitments and provide foreign exchange to international investors, to
allow for profit remittances. Mr Sosa also argued that the new exchange rate
would help international investors, by removing the penalty of the
'speculative' exchange rates seen in recent months.
He said the system of assigning foreign exchange would be 'highly automated
and transparent', and would be set up with the help of PDVSA, Venezuela's
national oil company.
However, foreign exchange trading at the new rate was not to resume
yesterday, as planned, due to 'technical questions' at the central bank.
Commercial banks said yesterday that they expected trading to resume on
Monday.
The new programme is Venezuela's fourth foreign exchange system since
President Rafael Caldera took office in February. The first was a
crawling-peg system used by the central bank until its president, Mrs Ruth
de Krivoy, resigned at the end of April over disagreements with the Caldera
administration. This was followed briefly by a limited auction system at the
central bank, then by a modified version of a Dutch auction, in effect until
June 23.
Mr Sosa stressed that the government has enough monetary reserves to meet
Venezuela's import and foreign debt obligations, but not enough to finance
capital flight. Officials estimate 'normal' foreign exchange sales to be
about Dollars 30m (Pounds 19.5m) each business day. PDVSA supplies the
central bank with about Dollars 40m a day from oil exports.
The central bank has not issued figures on monetary reserves since April,
when the bolivar began to slip, but a Caracas daily, citing figures from the
government planning office, reported that gross international reserves at
the end of May stood at Dollars 9.9bn, down 21 per cent from Dollars 12.6bn
at the end of 1993.
