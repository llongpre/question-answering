VENEZUELA is aiming to increase its crude oil production capacity to 3.3m.
barrels a day by 1996, compared with 2.83m b/d at the end of 1991, a rise of
16 per cent.
Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of the national oil corporation PDVSA, said in
Caracas that the higher potential should be reached despite cuts in capital
investment. It should enable PDVSA to more or less eliminate dependence on
other suppliers for its US refining and marketing operations.
Mr Roosen also forecast 'abundant crude production' worldwide next year
predicting that international crude prices would 'remain constant, or
slightly lower, than in 1992 in real terms.'
PDVSA is reducing its capital investments this year by USDollars 530m, to
Dollars 4.5bn.
To meet its substantial market commitment in the US the company,which has a
large oil refining and marketing system there, currently has to buy an
average of about 600,000 b/d of crude on the US market.
By steadily raising crude output capacity - and production - over the next
few years, the company hopes to sharply reduce its dependence on crude
purchases from other parties.
Venezuela's crude oil production has risen steadily in recent years.
In 1991 average output of crude, condensates and natural gas liquids was
2.49m b/d, the highest level on record since the Venezuelan oil industry was
nationalised in 1976. It compared with 2.25m b/d in 1990.
Crude production averaged about 2.39m b/d for the first quarter of 1992.
