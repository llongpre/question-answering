PETROLEOS de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's national oil company, recorded
net earnings of Dollars 1.86bn in 1991, an increase of 45 per cent over the
Dollars 1.3bn recorded in 1990, according to official estimates.
Mr Andres Sosa Pietri, president, said the company was able to post strong
financial results, even though the average per barrel price of Venezuela's
petroleum exports fell by 22 per cent last year to Dollars 15.92.
He said PDVSA compensated for lower oil prices in 1991 by maintaining strict
cost controls, and by increasing oil production, refining and exports.
The company's worldwide gross sales were Dollars 22.3bn in 1991, down 3 per
cent on the previous year, while operating profits were Dollars 8.08bn,
about the same as the previous year.
PDVSA, one of the world's largest petroleum companies, last year produced an
average of 2.48m barrels per day of crude oil, condensates and natural gas
liquids. This was the highest production level since 1976, when the company
began operations.
