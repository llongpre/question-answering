<F P=106> [Report by Miriam Ortiz from the "24 Hours" newscast] </F>
  [Text] A report by the "24 Hours" newscast more than a 
week ago has assumed unexpected proportions. First, a member of 
the ELN [Army of National Liberation] guerrilla group had 
reported that the Venezuelan National Guard was selling weapons 
to guerrilla groups in our country. The report was confirmed by 
Army Commander General Hernan Jose Guzman, and it has been fully 
confirmed by authorities on the border zone. 
  Three of the six departments located along the Venezuelan 
border--Norte de Santader, Arauca, and Vichada--have become the 
most vulnerable points for the trafficking of drugs and tons of 
weapons. Army forces in Arauca have just prevented the arrival 
of a weapons shipment intended for Colombian guerrilla groups. 
  [Begin General Alvaro Velandia, 16th Brigade commander,

neighboring country. [end recording] 
  The weapons confiscated by the Army from the guerrilla 
forces 
during a sting operation included three Venezuelan-made 
revolvers. 
  [Begin recording] [Velandia] As you can see, here is a logo. 
  [Unidentified reporter] Yes, of the Venezuelan weapons 
factory.

Industries]. [end recording] 
  Arauca Governor Alfredo Colmenares also referred to the hard 
evidence against the Venezuelan military in connection with the 
gunrunning operations. 
  [Begin Colmenares recording] They are conniving and 
associating with Colombian guerrillas. They are seriously 
implicated, and there is evidence confirming this. [end 
recording] 
  According to Vichada Governor Rafael Celis, his department 
has become a haven for guerrillas, and the lack of controls at 
each side of the border facilitates gunrunning. 
  [Begin Celis recording] This is a major problem, considering 
that the Arauca River flows into the Orinoco River. [end 
recording] 
  The Army must control 2,220 km at the border not only to 
prevent arms trafficking, but because, according to reports, 
more than 20 Venezuelan citizens have arrived in Colombia to be 
trained by the ELN and FARC [Revolutionary Armed Forces of 
Colombia]. Authorities are also investigating reports that an 
ELN cell is operating in the Venezuelan States of Apure and El 
Amparo.
