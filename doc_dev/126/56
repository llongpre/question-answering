   PITTSBURGH -- Aluminum Co. of America said Venezuela
accepted its $1.2 billion bid to build an aluminum smelter
that will increase the country's aluminum output by 50%.
   Alcoa plans to build a smelter with an annual capacity of
300,000 metric tons. The aluminum giant expects to build the
facility in two phases, with an initial investment of $800
million. Alcoa will supply technology and alumina chemical
from other countries.

   The company stressed, however, that the $1.2 billion
figure is "very soft." Alcoa said it will now enter into
definitive negotiations with the Venezuelan government over
such issues as energy costs and exchange rates.
   The Venezuelan government rated Alcoa the top bidder for
the project, over Orinoco Holding Ltd., Aluyana, and Vexxal
Aluminio, S.A. Venezuela had said it planned to select two
proposals but Alcoa's bid was the only one accepted so far.
Richmond, Va.-based Reynolds Metals Co., one of a host of
other bidders for various projects in Venezuela, said it had
not heard about its proposal.
   The smelter project will vastly expand Alcoa's presence in
the region. Alcoa and other aluminum companies had been
cautious about investments in South America in recent years
because of concerns over financing.
