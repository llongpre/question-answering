  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 8 
March. 
  A study by Fogade (Deposit Guarantee Fund) indicates that it 
provides an average of 11 to 12 billion bolivares every day to 
the Construccion, Maracaibo, Latino, La Guaira, Metropolitano, 
and Sociedad Financiera Fiveca banking institutions. Already, 
Fogade has provided these banks sums in excess of 300 billion 
bolivares. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 2 Mar 94 p E-11) 
  The Venezuelan Central Bank (BCV) was able to sell all its 
zero-coupon bonds, worth 25 billion (no currency specified), 
thereby, revealing the liquidity level of the market. The fact 
that all the bonds were sold shows that the country is beginning 
to solve the national financial crisis. Only the seven banks 
that have asked for financial assistance continue to have 
liquidity problems. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 3 Mar 94 p 16) 
  In February, BCV international reserves dropped to $11.249 
billion and the consumer price index went up 1.9 percent, 
official news agency VENPRES reported. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 
1610 GMT 3 Mar 94) 
  Swedish Ambassador in Venezuela Peter Landelius has stated 
that bilateral trade between his country and Venezuela totals 
over $200 million a year. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 4 Mar 94

  Venezuelan petroleum expenses increased 56.669 billion 
bolivares as a result of the currency being devaluated. The 
foreign exchange rate, which was 69.29 bolivares per dollar in 
1992, increased to 92 bolivares per dollar in 1993. In its 
annual report, the Energy and Mines Ministry reported that oil 
export revenues in 1993 totaled 1,027,947,000,000 bolivares, 
which represents an increase of 257.36 billion bolivares over 
1992, which totaled 770.911 billion bolivares. The report also 
states that the total amount of oil exports in 1993 reached 2.14 
million barrels per day, of which 69.59 percent represents crude 
oil and 30.41 percent, oil by-products. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA 
ECONOMIA in Spanish 4 Mar 94) 
  Carlos Garcia, executive director of the 
Colombian-Venezuelan 
Integration Chamber, has reported that trade exchanges between 
the two countries reached $1.6 billion in 1993. This increase of 
about 62 percent over 1992 favored Venezuela's trade balance by 
$197 million. The trade balance favored Colombia in 1992 by $126 
million. Private Venezuelan investments in Colombia totaled $27 
million and private Colombian investments in Venezuela totaled 
$6 million. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 7 Mar 94 p 24)
