Soldiers raided illegal gold mines in the Amazon jungle and arrested more than 
300 people, mostly foreigners, Venezuelan Foreign Affairs Minister Reinaldo 
Figueredo said. Most of the illegal miners apprehended were taken to Puerto 
Ayacucho, a jungle outpost on the Orinoco River, where they are to be tried on 
charges of damaging the environment, authorities said. Since last year, 
officials have made more than 1,000 arrests in attempting to staunch an 
invasion of miners crossing the unmarked jungle border between Brazil and 
Venezuela.
