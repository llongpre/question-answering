  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 29 
March. 
  The possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve may tighten 
its 
monetary policies and increase interest rates in the short term 
once again made the prices of Venezuelan foreign debt bonds 
decrease to the same level reached on 27 November 1992, a coup 
day. Chemical Bank reports indicate that the price of foreign 
debt bonds fell by four points and closed at 53.50 points. There 
is also a possibility that U.S. T-bills, whose profitability 
registered 6.97 percent, will continue to decrease. On 21 March, 
all these scenarios combined made the Caracas Stock Exchange 
index lose 3.6 percent and close at 24,654.82 points, which is a 
level similar to that reached on 16 August 1992. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 22 Mar 94 p E-1) 
  The Central Bank of Venezuela, BCV, is offering a record 
amount of 50 billion bolivares worth of zero-coupon bonds. About 
40 billion bolivares will mature in 90 days, and the remaining 
10 billion bolivares will mature in 182 days. The 
90-day-zero-coupon bonds registered a 52.13 percent 
return-on-equity, ROE, rate, which in turn will make fluctuating 
interest rates increase. (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 23 Mar 94 p 9) 
  Ferrominera Orinoco and Edelca, subsidiaries of the 
Venezuelan Guayana Corporation, CVG, will not be included in the 
privatization process that the Executive Branch is promoting. 
CVG President Francisco Layrisse said Caroni Aluminum Inc. is 
the only subsidiary that in six months, at the latest, will sell 
55 percent of its stock to private companies. As for Ferrominera 
Orinoco, the private sector will only have access to invest in 
the iron transformation process. Ferrominera Orinoco President 
Andres Caleca said the law stipulates that only the state has 
the right to tap iron. (Caracas Venezolana de Television Network 
in Spanish 1550 GMT 23 Mar 94) 
  The BCV's Board of Directors has decided to modify the 
mechanisms that control interest rates on loans. For instance, 
it decreased the ceiling rate that banks can charge with 
fluctuating interest rates from 20 to 15 points above the ROE 
rate on zero-coupon bonds. It is worth mentioning that the six 
largest banks currently charge an average fluctuating interest 
rate of 63.8 percent. (Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 24 Mar 
94 p 1-1) 
  The European Union's Nomenclature Committee recently decided 
to categorize Orimulsion as a bituminous substance. This 
decision opens new opportunities to sell larger amounts of this 
type of fuel to world markets. Frank Alcock, Venezuela 
Petroleum, Petroven, acting president, appeared before the 
Senate's Energy and Mines Commission and said that this new 
category for Orimulsion will prevent a reduction of its 
competitive edge in the Old Continent. The Council on Customs 
Affairs will issue its final ruling on Orimulsion on 4 April. 
Orimulsion exports amounted to 721,000 tons in 1992 and 2.79 
million tons in 1993. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 24 Mar 94 
p E-6) 
  On 23 March, Petroven Acting President Fred Alcock said 
Petroven will reduce expenses in 1994 by an additional 6 billion 
bolivares. He added that this reduction will bring to the 
treasury additional revenues amounting to 26 billion bolivares. 
Alcock appeared before the Senate's Energy and Mines Commission 
to explain Petroven's business plan. He also said that Venezuela 
will continue to sell gasoline to the United States. (Caracas EL 
DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 16) 
  The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to increase interest 
rates has landed a heavy blow on the already vulnerable 
Venezuelan economy because the price of its foreign debt bonds 
will drop. This means, however, that the risk to investment 
could fall, which in turn could attract more capital to the 
country. In short, the loss generated by lower prices on foreign 
debt bonds could be compensated by reinvesting said bonds on 
securities with higher interest rates as long as the bonds 
mature in the short term. (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 24 Mar 94 p 8) 
  Carlos Pulido Salvatierra, Association of Venezuelan 
Exporters president, said nontraditional Venezuelan exports to 
Colombia amounted to $500 million during the first quarter of 
1994. He added that it is expected that said exports will amount 
to almost $2 billion in 1994, which is 40 percent higher than in 
1993. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 2038 GMT 25 Mar 94) 
  The Finance Ministry estimates that the 1995 budget will 
amount to 1.7 trillion bolivares and that gasoline prices will 
increase in 1995. Finance Minister Julio Sosa Rodriguez said the 
mass transit system may receive additional subsidies in 1995. 
Jorge Serrano, vice president of the Venezuelan Federation of 
Associations and Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Fedecamaras, 
underscored that gasoline prices must drastically change because 
gasoline receives 40 billion bolivares worth of subsidies 
annually. The Fedecamaras believes that the price of high-octane 
gasoline must increase. (Caracas Venezolana de Television 
Network in Spanish 2350 GMT 25 Mar 94) 
  New Petroven Director Luis Giusti has said Petroven reduced 
its investment costs by $4 billion due to drops in hydrocarbon 
prices. He added that Petroven reduced other expenses by $3 
billion. Giusti pointed out that there is an international 
consensus on the opening of the national oil industry to private 
capital and that oil prices will not recover soon. (Mexico City 
NOTIMEX in Spanish 0118 GMT 29 Mar 94)
