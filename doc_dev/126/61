  [Text] Recognition of about 240,000 hectares of land 
located south of Caicara del Orinoco as Piaroa territory is 
currently being requested by the representatives of that 
indigenous community, as they fear that concessions covering 
that area will be granted. This would threaten the ecology and 
the development plans they have been undertaking in recent years. 
  This is according to statements by Jose Gregorio Rodriguez, 
Miguel Gonzalez, and Guillermo Tovar, representatives of the 
Piaroa community and members of the civic association called 
Original Peoples of the Chivapure Forest Reserve, Porfochi. 
  "We want the different governmental agencies to recognize 
the 
Piaroa people of the Suapure, Parguaza, and Guaniamo River 
basins as the legitimate inhabitants of these lands. Our future 
is uncertain in this region because there are plans to exploit 
the lumber on these lands." 
  They add that they cannot agree with this possibility 
because 
it would mean the end of the organization that the Piaroas have 
achieved there. So far, to prevent the exploitation of lumber, 
they have approached the National Agrarian Institute, the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock, and the agrarian court, 
which are the agencies that oversee matters concerning 
landholding among the indigenous people. 
  "We need an opportunity to continue our self-managed 
development project, which includes the rational use of natural 
resources, such as extracting seje [a kind of palm tree] oil, a 
medicinal product that can be used to cure different types of 
illnesses; producing honey; and raising buffalo. We have done 
all this through cooperatives." 
  They add that they know of the plans to grant concessions in 
these areas, and they have been denouncing this situation for 
the last four years. On several occasions they have submitted 
documents requesting that their territory in the Suapure area be 
recognized. 
  "Legally we are basing ourselves on Article 77 of the 
National Constitution, on the rights of the indigenous peoples; 
Article 2 of the Agrarian Reform, which establishes the 
recognition of the indigenous peoples' right to land; and 
Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization. This not 
only establishes our right to the land, but also our cultural 
right to conserve our language and customs."
