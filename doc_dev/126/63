  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 25 
January. Source is cited in parentheses following each item: 
  Lagoven, a subsidiary of Petroven, announced that output at 
the Bachaquero Sur-Oeste oil field increased to 3,100 barrels 
per day after four new wells were opened in the Lake Maracaibo 
area, Zulia Department. The Lagoven engineering department 
disclosed that the new wells had increased production by 2,300 
barrels per day in 1993. In 1992, Lagoven discovered crude oil 
that rated 45 API, which in its test phase incorporated 18 
million barrels of reserve petroleum. The company intends to 
drill seven new wells this year. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 
23 Jan 94 p 11) 
  Petroven announced a $0.50-per barrel increase in export 
crude as well as other products, thus raising the price of 
export crude to $12.20 per barrel. Petroven management 
explained that the price increase was due to an increase in 
demand brought about by colder weather in the United States and 
Europe. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 18 Jan 94 p E-5) 
  The Finance Ministry Public Finances Department reported 
that 
Venezuela canceled $2.685 billion in foreign debt service during 
fiscal year 1993. Of the total amount paid as part of the 
country's foreign debt services, $2.11130 billion, or 78.62 
percent, corresponds to unstructured debt, while $1.05868 
billion, or 39.42 percent, corresponds to restructured debt. 
The report also discloses that capital payments totalled $1.176 
billion, while interest payments amounted to $1.508 billion. 
Foreign debt balances during 1993 totaled $27.296 billion as 
opposed to $27.08290 billion during 1992. (Caracas EL GLOBO in 
Spanish 17 Jan 94 p 13) 
  Lagoven announced that crude oil and by-product exports 
increased to 797,000 barrels per day in 1993. According to 
Daniel Ramirez, manager of Lagoven Commerce and Supply 
Department, the company was able to increase its exports by 
37,000 barrels per day compared to 1992 exports. On the other 
hand, export revenues fell during 1993 due to excess supply as a 
result of OPEC and North Sea overproduction and greater than 
expected exports to Russia. (Hamburg DPA in Spanish 0029 GMT 18 
Jan 94)
