   Venezuela said Wednesday that it will
obtain a $1 billion loan secured by oil sales of two U.S. oil
refining companies it partly owns.
   The loan through Bank of America and Salomon Brothers Inc. is the
first in Venezuela to link oil revenues directly to repayment, said
Finance Minister Hector Hurtado Navarro.
   ``This operation will not affect the income of our oil company,
it will not affect oil prices and it will not generate additional
fiscal income. It is so we don't keep eating up our international
reserves,'' Hurtado told a news conference.
   The operation was approved in Wednesday's regular cabinet
meeting, he said.
   According to Hurtado, a New York trust fund will be established
for the Central Bank of Venezuela, which will receive payments from
Champlin Oil Refining Co. and Citgo Petroleum Co. under seven-year
crude oil contracts the refiners have with the state oil company
Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).
   PDVSA owns half of both refining firms, and recently announced it
will exercise an option to buy the other half of Champlin for around
$70 million.
   Combined the companies purchase around 200,000 barrels per day of
crude oil from PDVSA, or around 6 million barrels a month, Hurtado
said. The monthly payments on the oil currently amount to around $78
million, based on oil prices of around $13 per barrel, he said.
