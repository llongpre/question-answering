    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 12 
April. 
  Data collected by the Foreign Investment Superintendency, 
Siex, and the National Committee for the Promotion of Foreign 
Investments indicate German companies made $43.6 million in 
direct investments in Venezuela in 1993. Sven Heldt, president 
of the Venezuelan-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has 
said most investments focused on the chemical and pharmaceutical 
areas. The main investors were Hoechst ($24.9 million), Bayer 
($7.5 million), Siemens ($4.6 million), Schering ($3.5 million), 
Wella ($ .8 million), Fichtel and Sachs ($ .6 million), and Viex 
Anstalt ($ .6 million) (Caracas EL REPORTE DE LA ECONOMIA in 
Spanish 5 April 94 p 22) 
  The most recent Siex figures indicate foreign investments 
reached $3.03 million in March 1994 compared to $30 million in 
March 1993, a 90-percent drop. The accumulated investment for 
1994 is $21.867 million compared to $33 million for the first 
three months of 1993, a 30-percent drop. The major contributors 
of foreign capital are Denmark, the United States, the 
Netherlands, Switzerland, and Saint Martin. The manufacturing 
sector, with $13.5 million, was the main recipient of foreign 
capital in the first three months of 1994. Transportation, 
storage, and communications also received major investments. 
(Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 7 April 94 p E-8) 
  The Venezuelan Petroleum Corporation on 5 April announced a 
price increase of its crudes and other products as of 6 April. 
Heavy crudes increased by 50 cents, light crudes by $1 per 
barrel. Other products increased by 2 to 3 cents per gallon. 
Gasoline increased by $2.50, jet fuel by 3 cents, and distilled 
products by 2 cents. The decision stems from an increase in 
international petroleum prices and an adjustment in the price of 
Venezuelan petroleum to the price established by the 
international market. This increase established the price of 
Venezuelan export petroleum at $12.05 per barrel. (Caracas EL 
DIARIO DE CARACAS in Spanish 7 April 94 p 15) 
  The Central Bank has reported Venezuela paid $783.5 million 
of its foreign debt during the second half of 1993. Of that 
figure, 5.4 percent was used to pay capital, the rest to pay 
interest. Aggregate domestic demand dropped by 5.6 percent in 
real terms during the second semester of 1993 due to a 
1.2-percent drop in private consumption and 4.1-percent drop in 
government consumption. 
  Investment dropped by 3.3 percent in real terms due to a 
12.5-percent drop in public investment. In contrast, private 
investment grew by 13.4 percent, fueled by demand from the 
construction sector. Hotels and restaurants, commerce, 
agriculture, construction, and manufacturing were the most 
affected areas. The Central Bank has reported the domestic 
public debt amounted to $223.641 million bolivares during the 
second half of 1993 in comparison to $156.546 million over the 
first half. Treasury bills totaled 30.7 million bolivares during 
the first half of 1993 compared to 66.08 million in 1993 over 
the second half. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 10 April 94 p 
E-8) 
  Banco Latino spokesmen have reported this bank increased its 
cash savings and deposits by 6.19 percent between 4 to 7 April, 
the first week following its reopening. Deposits and savings 
amounted to 84.961 million bolivares as of 7 April. (Caracas
