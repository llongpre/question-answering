   National oil companies dominate new rankings of the
world's top oil companies with Petroleos de Venezuela moving
ahead of Exxon Corp. on at least one list.
   In its annual ranking of the 50 largest oil companies,
Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, or PIW, will report in its
issue out today that Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, is
third from the top.

   In this position, up from fifth place last year,
Venezuela's aggressive government-owned company has jumped
ahead of both the U.S.-based Exxon and Mexico's state-owned
Petroleos Mexicanos, or Pemex. But Saudi Arabia's
government-owned company, or Saudi Aramco, and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group maintained their rankings by the oil
industry publication as the largest and the No. 2 companies.
   "Exxon's fall from the No. 1 to No. 4 slot over a few
years is indicative of the difficulties encountered by
privately-owned companies in obtaining secure sources of
crude oil following the nationalizations of oil and gas
reserves" by producer governments more than a decade ago, PIW
reported.
   PIW bases its ranking of the top 50 on the basis of
operational data from nearly 100 firms. Its focus on
operations differs from most financially-oriented corporate
rankings but allows "meaningful comparisons" of all types of
companies, the publication maintains.
   The rankings are based on the most recent operating data
available, PIW said. Given the lag in publishing information,
its latest rankings are for 1990, it added. Government-owned
Kuwait Petroleum Co. dropped completely from the top 10 firms
in the PIW rankings and is now No. 14, reflecting the United
Nations embargo imposed after the Iraqi invasion of the
country in August 1990.
   The criteria used by PIW in its rankings are oil and gas
reserves, oil and gas production, refining capacity and
petroleum product sales. "Financial data are not used because
of the difficulties imposed in comparing state-owned firms
with private sector firms," PIW said.
   The oil industry newsletter said several of the
state-owned firms in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries are making significant headway in refining and
marketing endeavors even as they grow "upstream" in crude oil
production. Venezuela's PDVSA is setting the pace, the
publication added.
   According to PIW, the Venezuelan company added 400,000
barrels a day of refining capacity in 1990 while increasing
crude production by 7.5% to more than 2.1 million barrels a
day. In contrast to PDVSA's success, the reserves and
production performance of the major international oil
companies declined, PIW noted.
   As previously reported, PDVSA has an ambitious $48 billion
energy expansion plan that includes an increase in its oil
production capacity to 3.5 million barrels a day by 1995. It
is seeking foreign partners among the international oil
companies for their financial and technological assistance.
Several major oil companies already have signed preliminary
agreements with PDVSA that could lead to joint ventures in
the development of Venezuela's oil, including the heavy
Orinoco crudes.
   Mobil Corp. is the latest to link up with PDVSA. Mobil
announced Friday that it and PDVSA had signed a letter of
intent to study development and upgrading of heavy oil from
the Orinoco belt and other exploration and production
opportunities in Venezuela.
