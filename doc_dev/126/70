recession

CELLULAR telephones were recently banned from one fashionable restaurant in
Caracas; there were so many, and they were being used to talk from one table
to another.
Venezuelans conscious of status symbols once again are unafraid to display
their wealth. The shopping malls of Caracas, the richest in Latin America,
are fully stocked and heavily patronised. Talk of hard times is over, and
the country is looking forward to another oil-based boom. Growth this year
could be as high as 8 per cent.
This is all very different from a year ago, when the country was gripped by
recession and still traumatised by the aftermath of the violent rioting in
February 1989, which led to more than 350 deaths.
'It hasn't been easy, but we have regained confidence and recovered our
morale, which took a beating after the riots,' said a local businessman.
The recession was brief but painful. To come to terms with the burden of its
Dollars 31bn foreign debt and gross overspending in the public sector, the
government of President Carlos Andres Perez imposed a tough economic
adjustment programme two years ago. Per capita incomes fell by an
unprecedented 9 per cent.
The government can claim credit for introducing the correct macro-economic
policies. Damaging exchange rate distortions have been removed, the foreign
debt has been rescheduled, trade liberalised, public spending cut, subsidies
have been largely removed and prices freed.
So inflation has been trimmed from an annual 90 per cent to 35 per cent, and
is still falling. The public sector has swung from an inherited deficit of
nearly 9 per cent of GDP to a 1.2 per cent surplus predicted for this year.
Venezuela was the great beneficiary of the Gulf crisis. Each dollar rise in
the price of oil per barrel added Dollars 55m a month to the country's oil
earnings. The rise in crude prices thus increased those earnings by Dollars
2.5bn last year, with a further Dollars 1.2bn coming from increased
production. With the oil sector accounting for almost 90 per cent of
exports, total export earnings increased 39 per cent to Dollars 17.6bn.
According to Dr Pedro Rosas, deputy planning minister, the budget this year
is being based on an oil price of Dollars 19 per barrel with exports seen
conservatively at 1.9m barrels a day. A Dollars 1.2bn stabilisation fund has
been created to accommodate any fluctuations, with a further buffer from
reserves expected to reach Dollars 13bn by year-end.
Events in the Gulf highlighted Venezuela's position as the only large-volume
oil producer outside the Middle East with sustained long-term export
capacity - and the Gulf conflict erupted just as the Venezuelan economy was
pulling out of recession.
However, the windfall oil profits threatened to undermine inflation targets
and relax fiscal discipline. Plans for privatisation slowed, as did the
promise of fiscal reform.
Dr Rosas insists the government will restructure taxes this year. Corporate
and income taxes will be cut to stimulate investment and savings, while the
Treasury's take will be made up by an increase in value-added tax.
Privatisation seems to be picking up momentum. The government has stated
conditions for the sale of 60 per cent of the international airline, Viasa.
Another airline, Aeropostal, with two banks (Italo Venezolano and
Republica), the telecommunications group CANTV, tourist hotels, sugar mills
and an energy company are also lined up. Some foreign investment will be
allowed.
Having introduced more liberal foreign investment laws, President Perez is
beginning to live down his reputation for being against foreign capital,
this gained from his nationalisation of the oil industry in the 1970s. Parts
of the oil industry are now being opened to foreign capital. Nine
petrochemical 'megaprojects', totalling Dollars 3bn, are to go to tender
this year, with debt conversion financial packages encouraged. Foreign
companies will also be allowed to develop the country's large gas reserves
and explore for oil in new areas or exploit marginal fields.
The lion's share will remain with PVDSA, the state oil concern, which plans
to invest a staggering Dollars 34bn in Venezuela by 1996. PVDSA finds itself
increasingly limited by its membership of the Organisation of
Petroleum-Exporting Countries, but Mr Perez remains firmly attached to the
ideals of this cartel, which Venezuela helped to found.
Despite a sustained growth projection of more than 6 per cent for the
foreseeable future, and the many opportunites developing, foreign investors
are still exceptionally wary. Too much bureauracy and too much opportunity
for corruption surround investment procedures.
Foreign investors mistrust the private sector, which mouths support for a
free market economy but seeks to keep its cartels and cosy relationship with
the state apparatus.
While well thought of, the economic team lacks depth and political weight.
This makes it harder to resist the multiple calls on the state purse. It
will also require the full authority of Mr Perez to hold down the unions'
current pay demands, prompted by the need of large segments of society to
return to their income levels of the mid-eighties.
The unions are struggling to retain their influence, which is being
undermined by the liberalisation. Their main strategy is to arrange to
support one or both of the two main political parties, the Christian
democratic COPEI and the ruling social democratic Democratic Action (AD).
Both are desperately trying, meanwhile, to preserve their role as those
which how the national cake is divided.
A subtler challenge comes from the need to raise the educational level of
the workforce and resolve potential staff shortages.
Renewed high growth will create a tight labour market in country with a
population of only 11m. Unemployment is down to 8 per cent, despite some 2m
Colombians working legally and illegally in the country, mainly in
agricultural and domestic employment.
Senior Venezuelan officials are also looking to eastern Europe. Indeed, if
the boom does become consolidated, Venezuela may witness a wave of
immigration, as in the 1950s.
VENEZUELA'S national oil company, PDVSA, plans to raise Dollars 300m via
international bond issues, according to a press report in Caracas, reports
Joe Mann in Caracas. The business newspaper, Economia Hoy, reported that the
company would obtain Dollars 100m from bonds to be issued by the Republic of
Venezuela, and another Dollars 200m from bonds to be issued by itself. The
state-owned company has not directly borrowed money on international markets
since it was established in 1975.
