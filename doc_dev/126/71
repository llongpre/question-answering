VENEZUELA, in announcing the conditions under which it will privatise its
Viasa international airline, says foreign airlines will be able to buy
around 35 per cent of the airline's shares.
The government stipulates that although it plans to sell up to 60 per cent
of Viasa, it will keep at least 51 per cent in the Venezuelan hands. It also
says airline employees can own up to 20 per cent of Viasa under stock
purchase plans.
Viasa, which flies to Europe, the US, Latin America and the Caribbean, made
a loss last year. Profits in previous years were due mainly to government
export bonuses.
Viasa operates five DC-10 jets (four are owned by the airline, one is
leased) and three leased Airbus 300-B4s.
Officials say they plan to complete the privatisation of Viasa by July of
this year. Potential bidders must set up consortia that will be able to
operate the airline, the government said.
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) plans capital investments of Dollars 48bn for
domestic and international projects by 1996, including direct capital
outlays of Dollars 34bn by PDVSA itself.
In addition, Dollars 14bn is to be invested by overseas subsidiaries,
partners in existing joint ventures and private companies which are
developing new projects with PDVSA.
PDVSA is one of the world's largest petroleum companies and has oil refining
and distribution assets in the US, Germany, Sweden and Belgium. The Dollars
34bn in direct investments programmed by PDVSA represents an increase of 36
per cent - or Dollars 9bn - over the Dollars 25bn investment programme for
1991-96 announced at the end of last year.
In 1990, PDVSA's total turnover topped Dollars 23bn. The company has over
60bn barrels in proven reserves of crude oil, the largest in the western
hemisphere.
