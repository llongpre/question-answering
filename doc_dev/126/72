VENEZUELA'S Congress has given final approval to a Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds
3.75bn) natural gas project that involves the first foreign equity
investment in the country's oil and gas sectors since the oil industry was
nationalised in 1976.
The decision is expected to open the door to other big international
investments in Venezuela's petroleum sector.
The partners in this joint venture, the largest single project ever
undertaken by the Venezuelan oil industry, are Lagoven, a subsidiary of the
national oil company PDVSA, which will have 33 per cent of the equity; Royal
Dutch/Shell (30 per cent); Exxon (29 per cent) and Mitsubishi (8 per cent).
The project calls for producing natural gas from offshore fields in the
Caribbean, transporting it to land by pipeline, and building a large gas
liquefaction plant, port facilities and other infrastructure on the Paria
Peninsula in eastern Venezuela.
The promoters plan to export the final product, liquefied natural gas or
LNG, to meet growing demand for 'clean energy' in markets on the east coast
of the US and in Europe.
Liquefaction capacity is projected at 6m tonnes a year, and the partners
will buy or lease six 50,000 dwt LNG carriers.
Under Venezuela's Oil Industry Nationalisation Law of 1975, joint ventures
in oil and gas between the national oil company and any private investors
can be carried out only when the project represents 'the national interest'
and receives approval by both houses of the Venezuelan legislature.
This week's congressional approval came with the votes of the country's two
largest political parties, Democratic Action and the Christian Democrat
Copei party.
Political parties on the left mounted a last-minute campaign to block the
project, saying it would be contrary to national interests.
The project, called Christopher Columbus to honour the explorer's landing on
the Paria Peninsula in 1498, has been under discussion by the partners for
around four years. It was delayed earlier by questions about future demand
for LNG imports and by concerns over the protection of technology to be
used, applicable tax rates and whether legal disputes would be settled by
Venezuelan or foreign courts. (The latter will have the final word.)
The change in attitude towards foreign investment in Venezuela's oil
industry was forced on many Venezuelan politicians by economic reality.
PDVSA and the Venezuelan government have been seeking foreign capital for
big projects in oil and gas for some time. PDVSA executives and government
officials including Mr Alirio Parra, minister of energy and mines, have
stressed that PDVSA by itself cannot finance some important projects.
