<HEAD>Venezuelan Oil Monopoly Doesn't Deny Reports It Wants To Leave
OPEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state oil monopoly Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A. said Friday it was obeying OPEC quotas, but did not
explicitly deny reports that it was pressing the government to take
Venezuela out of OPEC.
   ``PDVSA complies, and will continue to comply at all times, with
the guidelines of oil policy laid down, or that will be laid down,
by the national government,'' said a five-line statement faxed to
The Associated Press.
   The daily El Nacional newspaper reported Friday that PDVSA wants
Venezuela to leave the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries.
   Officials of the government party, Democratic Action, confirmed
to the AP that PDVSA President Andres Sosa Pietri met with the
party's excutive national committee Tuesday and told them that OPEC
quotas were ``against Venezuela's best interests.''
   At the meeting, Sosa Pietri said there was no reason why
Venezuela should continue to follow OPEC since other cartel members
were flouting them openly, according to the sources, who asked to
remain anonymous.
   So far, there have been no comments from the Energy and Mines
Ministry.
   Both Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez and Energy
Minister Celestino Armas are staunch OPEC supporters.
   But PDVSA executives have been chafing under OPEC quotas for
months, complaining that they hamper the Venezuelan oil industry's
expansion. Increasingly, PDVSA executives have said, sometimes not
so privately, that Venezuela should not respect quotas if other
OPEC members are openly violating them.
