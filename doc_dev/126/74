  [Text] Luis Eduardo Giusti Lopez has been appointed the new 
president of Venezuela Petroleum Inc. [Petroven] to replace 
Gustavo Roosen, who will continue to head the intervention 
committee at Banco Latino. 
  Giusti entered the oil industry in 1966 through Shell of 
Venezuela, which preceded Maraven, S.A. He has held numerous 
positions in the areas of production, oil bed engineering, and 
planning both in Shell and Maraven. 
  In the announcement about Giusti's appointment, it was 
reported that 2,170,000 barrels of crude oil per day, at an 
average price of $13.34 a barrel, were exported from Venezuela 
in 1993. In other words, the volume exported in 1993 exceeded 
1992 exports by 116,000 barrels daily. It was also said that the 
sales of gasoline produced by the subsidiary (?Cyclop) Petroleum 
in the United States increased by 7 percent. 
  In the refineries located on Venezuelan territory, 950,000 
barrels of oil were processed daily. The Amuay refinery 
processed 440,000 barrels daily; the Cardon refinery, 265,000; 
the Palito refinery, 100,000; and the Puerto la Cruz refinery, 
141,000 barrels daily. The production of diesel with 0.05 
percent sulfur began in the Amuay refinery during this period. 
In addition, the Palito refinery started producing oxygenated 
gasoline to meet the new environmental demands stipulated by the 
U.S. market. 
  In addition, Rossen, head of the Banco Latino intervention 
board, said that a plan to refloat the bank is under way. He 
asked the bank's depositors to keep calm. 
  [Madrid EFE in Spanish at 2340 GMT on 18 March reports that, 
according to Energy and Mines Minister Erwin Arrieta, President 
Caldera on 18 March removed the entire Petroven board of 
directors and appointed Giusti].
