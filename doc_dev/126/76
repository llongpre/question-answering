   Malaria, the killer disease once
believed to have been largely eradicated in Latin America, is making
a comeback in Venezuela.
   Experts attribute the resurgence to declining standards of living
due to scarce resources and a booming population.
   They estimate that malaria cases in Venezuela reached some 40,000
in 1988, up from 11,127 in 1984, the last year of accurate records
kept by the World Health Organization for the country.
   Recent Venezuelan press accounts have warned of an imminent
epidemic of malaria sweeping the remote southeast Orinoco River
basin, inhabited mainly by Indians and gold miners. In that area
alone at least 50 people have died of the disease in recent months,
officials say.
   Until 1945, malaria was the leading killer in Venezuela.
   It is transmitted by the bite of a female mosquito of the genus
anopheles, prevalent in tropical regions. The mosquito bites only
between sunset and dawn.
   The disease is caused by parasites injected during the mosquito's
bite. The most serious form of malaria causes fever, chills,
headache and sometimes shock, kidney and liver failure, and coma.
   There is no known vaccine against malaria, although researchers
are still searching for one.
   Francisco Montbrun, Venezuela's health minister, has made several
tours to the malaria-ridden areas and says the nation is facing a
severe crisis.
   He blames the comeback mainly on an influx of gold miners to
areas in southeastern Venezuela that previously were scarcely
inhabited.
   ``Before there was nobody there so we had the disease
controlled,'' he said. ``Now with all the people moving in from who
knows where, they're getting malaria and there are no controls.
   ``The gold miners leave holes in the ground that are breeding
places for the mosquito. They live in shacks without walls. It is
very hard to carry out control programs.''
   Dr. Arnaldo Gabaldon, who is credited with largely eradicating
the disease in Venezuela by 1961, maintained that the resurgence of
the disease resulted because the government halted DDT spraying
programs in malaria-prone areas in the last decade and failed to
train personnel in control programs.
   ``They've gotten lazy. The bureacrats would rather sit in their
air-conditioned offices than go out in the field and see what is
going on under the sun,'' said Gabaldon, who was given the
``Outstanding Alumnus'' award in November by the Johns Hopkins
School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore for his lifetime
fight against malaria.
   The Venezuelan government, strapped for funds due to falling oil
prices and payments of the foreign debt, has cut back on public
services.
   The Health Ministry will run a deficit for 1988 of $55 million,
said Health Minister Montbrun, meaning that money for DDT spraying
and for paying workers in the field has been short.
   Although banned in the United States and other areas of the
world, DDT still is used in tropical regions to fight malaria.
   Doctors in the field also blame declining government services for
the malaria comeback of recent years.
   A World Health Organization report says DDT spraying campaigns
across Latin America have declined drastically, falling from 13.5
million houses sprayed in 1975 to 5.5 million in 1982.
   It blames ``recession, economic policies of contraction, and an
asymmetrical and non-equitative renegotiation of regional debt'' as
causes of a decline in malaria-control programs.
   Other causes listed in the report are ``massive migrations into
the Amazon basin,'' and ``resistance of vectors, (anopheles
mosquitoes) to DDT.''
   Malaria cases in neighboring Brazil have risen from 51,800 in
1970 to 378,257 in 1984, according to the World Health Organization.
   Tourism officials maintain travelers to such popular places as
Venezuela's Angel Falls would not be in danger.
   ``It's not necessary to fear malaria,'' says Jose Haua of Haua
Turismo. ``Perhaps there is a focus in the gold-mining area, but
where we go there is no danger. If you want, we can give you a pill
here in the office before the trip.''
   Doctors say that taking certain quinine-based and other
medications during and after trips to malaria-ridden areas can
lessen the severity of the disease if it is contracted but not
prevent it.
   Other precautionary measures such as the use of repellents and
mosquito-nets at night are usually sufficient, they say.
