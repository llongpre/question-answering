   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto said Wednesday
he expects a slight cut in oil output when Iraq returns to the
cartel's production ceiling after a cease-fire takes effect in its
war with Iran.
   For oil prices to stabilize, it ``would be desirable for Iran
and Iraq to have a daily production of 2.3 million barrels,'' a cut
of between 6,000 and 7,000 barrels a day, Subroto said in a news
conference on arrival here.
   ``By adjusting production, in addition to remedying the
situation, the prices of the fuel will be higher,'' said Subroto.
   The cease-fire that is to take effect Saturday in the 8-year-old
Persian Gulf war has raised speculation that the fractious cartel
could make progress in its attempts to meet production limits aimed
at boosting world oil prices.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has a
production ceiling of 15.06 million barrels per day in an attempt
to support its benchmark price of $18 a barrel, but Iraqi
production has not been counted under the ceiling.
   Actual world market prices currently are $2 to $3 a barrel lower
than the benchmark.
   Subroto, who plans to visit Iran and Iraq after leaving Mexico,
also said crude oil prices next winter may be as high as $15 a
barrel.
   ``In the decade of the 90s, the prediction is that oil prices
will be strengthened,'' he said.
   Since he was elected secretary-general of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries last June, Subroto has been seeking a
consensus over the means to stabilize oil prices. As part of the
effort, he has visited the United Arab Emirates, Ecuador and
Venezuela and plans to visit all OPEC members and independent
producers.
   Mexico the world's sixth-largest producer of crude, is not an
OPEC member but follows the cartel's pricing and production
policies when it believes they contribute to stability in the
market.
   Subroto said he would meet here with President Miguel de la
Madrid and Energy Secretary Fernando Hiriart.
   Mexico produces about 2.5 million barrels of crude a day and
exported 1.35 million barrels a day in July. About half the exports
go to the United States.
   Separately, in Caracas former Venezuela oil minister Humberto
Calderon Berti said Wednesday that the OPEC price monitoring
committee tentatively was scheduled to meet Sept. 20 in Jakarta,
Indonesia.
   The date and place of the committee's meeting will be confirmed
within the next few days, according to Calderon Berti, who said he
consulted with Subroto privately Tuesday in Caracas.
   Members of the price committee are Venezuela, Indonesia,
Algeria, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia. The committee monitors factors,
especially crude output, which affect OPEC's to meet its benchmark
price.
   Calderon Berti also said Subroto said he supported raising
OPEC's production ceiling to between 17.5 million and 18 million
barrels per day in a new production accord to be hammered out at
the cartel's regular conference in November.
   The new ceiling would allow OPEC to incorporate Iraq's output,
currently around 2.5 million barrels a day, into a new accord
without cutting the production of other member countries.
