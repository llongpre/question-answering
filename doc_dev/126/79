Mr Antonio Casas Gonzalez, who has had extensive experience as chief
financial officer in Venezuela's oil industry, was appointed last night by
President Rafael Caldera to be the president of the country's central bank.
Mr Casas, who is currently representing Venezuela's national oil company
PDVSA in London, takes over the bank during a crisis of confidence. Mrs Ruth
de Krivoy quit as chief executive last Tuesday as she felt the executive
branch was trying to compromise its autonomous status.
Meanwhile, the Venezuelan government has proposed cutting its bloated state
payroll by giving shares in state-owned companies to government employees
who leave their jobs voluntarily or are made redundant.
Under the plan, the government would pay for employees' severance benefits
with shares in PDVSA, and the CVG heavy industry group, which includes
steel, aluminium, iron ore and hydroelectric power interests.
Mr Asdrubal Baptista, state minister for reform of the economy, in a speech
on Wednesday reaffirmed the Caldera administration's intention of 'opening
up new spaces for private investment,' especially in the petroleum sector
and in CVG. Mr Baptista touched on a previously taboo topic, saying domestic
prices for petrol and refined products must rise.
Under Venezuelan law, both the government and private companies are obliged
to set aside financial reserves for employees' severance benefits.
In the government's case, revenues will never be sufficient to cover these
reserves, so far thwarting plans to make big reductions in Venezuela's 1.1m
government workers.
Private businessmen said the plan to offer shares as a severance benefit
could resolve a sizeable government problem, but would also reward employees
who are generally considered less efficient than private sector workers.
