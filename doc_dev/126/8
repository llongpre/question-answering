friends - Venezuela is using foreign investment to develop the nation's
petroleum industry

Venezuela has announced a Dollars 45.8bn investment programme for its
petroleum industry over the next 10 years that stresses a substantial
increase in crude oil production capacity and the upgrading of oil
refineries to produce higher-quality products.
The plan, which was announced by Mr Gustavo Roosen, president of national
oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), assigns a key role to foreign
investment in Venezuela's oil and gas sectors for the first time since the
country nationalised all private oil companies in 1976.
Of the Dollars 48.5bn in projected capital spending, PDVSA plans to invest
Dollars 29.1bn or 60 per cent of the total directly, while private companies
 -mainly foreign investors - are expected to supply the remainder of about
Dollars 19.4bn. Groups such as Royal Dutch/Shell, Exxon, Conoco, Mitsubishi
and Total are already planning large joint-venture projects with PDVSA in
natural gas and heavy oil. And the Venezuelan oil company is actively
seeking new partners for a variety of other projects in oil exploration and
production, refining, petrochemicals and coal.
PDVSA ranks as one of the world's biggest oil companies; at the 1992
year-end it had 63.3bn barrels of crude oil reserves, the largest outside
the Middle East.
One of the main thrusts of the company's investment programme is to develop
crude oil production potential of 4m barrels per day (b/d) by 2002, up 1.1m
b/d from the current capacity of approximately 2.9m b/d.
New exploration work will be carried out in traditional oil production zones
and other areas, and PDVSA's goal is to raise proved reserves of crude oil
to 65bn barrels over the next decade, up 3 per cent from the current level.
International investors are becoming involved in PDVSA's plans through
operating agreements, production sharing and strategic associations.
Under operating agreements, private companies invest to develop production
of crude oil and natural gas in so-called 'marginal fields', or areas with
relatively small volumes of production that PDVSA does not wish to operate
directly. Investors do not own the oil and gas they produce but are
compensated according to production volume.
The first operating agreements were signed in 1992, and earlier this year
British Petroleum agreed to invest around Dollars 60m over the next three
years in a marginal oil field under a 20-year operating agreement.
Using a BP study, PDVSA has also identified sectors in eastern Venezuela
with strong prospects for large discoveries of light and medium-weight
crudes, which Venezuela needs to balance out its existing reserves, now
dominated by heavy crudes.
Next year, PDVSA plans to look for international partners who will assume
all the risks to develop these zones. If commercial quantities of oil are
discovered, PDVSA will share future production with the foreign partner.
Last August, PDVSA received congressional approval to move ahead with two
multi-billion dollar projects to produce and upgrade heavy oil. Conoco,
Total, Itochu and Marubeni are the international partners. The investors
plan to produce heavy and extra-heavy crude from Venezuela's Orinoco Belt (a
large reserve of heavy oil), and use delayed coking to convert it into
lighter-weight, higher-value crude for export. In addition, PDVSA, Shell,
Exxon and Mitsubishi are developing a Dollars 5.6bn project to produce
liquefied natural gas (LNG) for export.
In refining, PDVSA will complete upgrading projects at three of its home
refineries and raise crude processing capacity at these plants and Curacao -
where it leases a former Shell refinery from the government - from the
current level of 1.1m b/d to 1.2m b/d by 2002. That increase will be quite
small in volume terms but the company is investing heavily to upgrade and
modernise the refineries so that they can turn out high-quality,
increased-value, refined products, meeting tougher environmental standards
in the US and other markets.
PDVSA, which already owns, either wholly or jointly, large oil refining
operations in the US and Europe, plans to expand its overseas network
through the acquisition of new refining capacity. The company would not
comment on its acquisition plans, but executives said future marketing
efforts would focus on Latin America and Asia, as well as on expanding
market share in the Caribbean.
In developing their 10-year programme, PDVSA planners are assuming 2 per
cent annual growth in world energy demand during 1992-2002, with projected
demand for hydrocarbons reaching 76m b/d by 2002, up from consumption of 66m
b/d in 1990.
They also assume that potential demand for Venezuelan crude oil on
international markets will rise to about 3.6m b/d in 2002, and to 4.5m b/d
in 2010. Home demand for refined oil products is expected to grow at 2 per
cent a year.
Venezuela's crude oil production last year averaged 2.33m b/d, while exports
of crude and refined products averaged 2.1m b/d, with crude accounting for
1.43m b/d of the total.
A large share of the country's crude oil exports is processed at PDVSA
refineries in the US and Europe.
