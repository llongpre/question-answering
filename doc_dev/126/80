  [Text] Upon leaving Miraflores, Finance Minister Julio Sosa 
Rodriguez asserted that his office estimates the country will 
earn additional income of approximately 6 billion bolivares from 
PDVSA [Venezuelan Petroleum] thanks to an increase in oil prices 
in May. 
  According to the minister, this income will help efforts to 
balance the budget deficit. "But I don't have too many hopes. I 
believe we will earn enough foreign exchange to be able to meet 
the country's needs--I mean, all its exports and the debt 
servicing. I should point out that the increase in the price of 
oil is due to an increase in demand for oil and the improving 
U.S. economic situation." 
  The minister reported the government has collected 3.1 
billion bolivares in bank debit taxes. "We have not had any 
problems in collecting those revenues. The system has worked 
satisfactorily, and the banking sector has not had any computer 
problems." 
  Regarding the concession law approved by the Council of 
Ministers, Sosa Rodriguez said the legal mechanism for 
construction of public works will attract foreign investors to 
the country and will provide economic compensation for the 
budget cuts made to several national interest projects. 
  Referring to the sales tax law, the finance minister 
affirmed 
that this law will be approved by the executive on Wednesday. 
When he was asked if they planned to extend the tax on banking 
debits, he replied: "I don't think it's right to extend this 
tax." 
  The IMF visit to Venezuela has triggered public expectations 
regarding the economic conditions and programs it plans to 
suggest to the government. In this respect, Sosa stated: "From a 
psychological point of view, it would be good for the IMF to 
officially prop up the level of our reserves and make a public 
statement on the situation. This would have a positive impact on 
our economy and deter the negative influence of speculators and 
rumors about our currency. In conclusion, it would make it more 
difficult for speculators who work in our markets." 
  Likewise, he added that the only point the IMF could 
question 
is the suspension of the value-added tax (VAT). "Everyone knows 
this tax had to be lifted because the country was neither 
prepared nor organized to collect this kind of revenue. The 
methodology was used for commercial speculation to the detriment 
of the citizens." 
  On the same subject, the minister said: "Another thing the 
IMF could ask is why we have not increased the price of 
gasoline. On this point, I have always said we are going through 
an economic crisis, an inherited chaos, and to straighten things 
out we need to grant several administration subsidies to the 
collective transportation sector." 
  On another topic, Sosa Rodriguez asserted that he is still 
studying the possibility of requesting support or other types of 
help from the IMF. "For the time being, however, both the IMF 
and the government, as had been planned, will work together for 
two weeks to study the economic situation and come up with a 
joint assessment." 
  Another international financial organization that recently 
visited Venezuela was the World Bank. Julio Sosa Rodriguez said 
that the World Bank officials met with President Caldera. "They 
came to help us with the subsidized banks, and I believe their 
observations have been very positive. They offered to send us 
this week, a group of technicians to help Fogade [Deposit 
Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] and the Banking 
Superintendent's Office in solving management and financial aid 
problems." 
  Sosa reported the executive had requested credits, which are 
fully justified, for 156 billion bolivares from Congress. This 
money includes the resources for paying all government 
employees, including those in the Judiciary Council. "The only 
observation the Congress's Finance Commission had on my request 
was that I had not included allotments for corresponding social 
benefits."
