GROWTH IN world oil demand is expected to be sluggish this year, according
to the International Energy Agency's latest monthly oil market report. The
western monitoring body expects an increase in demand of 500,000 barrels a
day to 66.8m b/d - 1 per cent above last year's level, which was depressed
by the effects of the Gulf war and the recession.
Most of the growth in oil consumption by members of the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development is expected to come from North America
following a pick-up in economic activity. Demand from the former Soviet
Union is expected to fall 7 per cent to 7.7m b/d.
The IEA noted that production of oil in the former Soviet Union dropped to
9.5m b/d in November - the latest month for which figures are available -
leading to an estimate of a decline in output of 1.1m b/d for last year.
Output by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries edged up in
December to 24.2m b/d, the IEA said.
Venezuela's production of crude oil last year averaged 2.488m b/d, the
highest recorded since the petroleum industry was nationalised in 1976,
officials said, Joe Mann reports from Caracas.
The figure, which includes crude oil and small proportions of condensates
and natural gas liquids, represents an increase of nearly 11 per cent on
1990. Exports of crude oil and refined products in 1991 averaged 2.08m b/d,
up more than 10 per cent.
Venezuela's proven reserves of crude oil totalled 62.8bn barrels at the end
of 1991, up 5 per cent from a year earlier.
