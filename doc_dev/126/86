  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15 
February. 
  Convergence Deputy Leonardo Montiel reports the Central Bank 
of Venezuela used approximately $1 billion to assist banks 
experiencing difficulties due to "very probable irregular 
management." The Central Bank president will be summoned 
tomorrow before the Finance Commission to explain why funds were 
used to help certain banks instead of depositors. (Madrid EFE in 
Spanish 2049 GMT 8 Feb 94) 
  Venzuelan Petroleum subsidiary Lagoven Inc. dispatched a 
total of 119 million barrels during 1993 from its La Salina 
Terminal, on the eastern coast of Lake Maracaibo, to export 
markets and local petrochemical- and petroleum-processing 
centers. A total of 237 oil tankers were used, of which 168 
went to the United States, 35 to Germany, 12 to Canada, eight to 
Jamaica, six to Chile, three to Africa, two to Norway, and three 
to the Amuay Refinery in Falcon State. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA 
ECONOMIA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 17) 
  The National Venezuelan Telephone Company grossed 120 
billion 
bolivares during 1993, twice the amount for 1992. The company 
president said that at the end of the month the company will pay 
the National Treasury 6 billion bolivares for concessions 
granted by the government. (Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 9 
Feb 94 p 12) 
  Venezuelan Petroleum subsidiary Maraven increased its level 
of production and generated significant savings of 10 billion 
bolivares in 1993, in addition to increasing services for 
customers via its quality management program. (Caracas EL DIARIO 
DE CARACAS in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 19) 
  The state group Venezuelan Petroleum, via its president, 
Gustavo Roosen, explains that the fall in petroleum prices on 
the international markets has forced a review of the 1994 budget 
and the implementation of appropriate adjustments. As a result, 
the government will have a much lower tax revenue. 
Conservatives place the national deficit at approximately $3.5 
billion, while pessimists estimate the same at approximately $6 
billion, 50 percent of the budget. (Madrid EFE in Spanish 0041
