   OPEC's new oil accord alone will not be
sufficient to raise petroleum prices to the cartel's $18 per barrel
benchmark, Venezuela's oil minister said Wednesday.
   Energy Minister Julio Cesar Gil said that non-OPEC oil exporters
also must reduce their output to help push prices up by roughly $6
from current crude levels.
   ``We cannot arrive at $18 only with the accord. It is essential
to count on the non-OPEC countries,'' Gil said.
   Gil said Venezuela, one of the founding members of the 13-nation
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, will begin contacting
nine independent nations which have indicated a willingness to work
with OPEC to reduce the glut of world oil that has kept prices weak.
   The nations include Mexico, Colombia, Malaysia, Oman, Egypt,
China, Norway, Angola and the Soviet Union, he said.
   OPEC concluded its thorny winter session on Sunday by agreeing to
reduce oil production from an estimated 22 million barrels a day to
18.5 million barrels. The cartel hopes the new agreement will lift
prices to the $18 level in the first half of 1989.
   Gil said he spoke with Mexican oil minister Fernando Yriart
Valderrama Monday and that contacts would be renewed following that
country's change of government on Thursday.
   The minister said his country also was satisfied with the
definition of condensates adopted at the conference, which includes
an American Petroleum Institute weight as one of five defining
elements.
   Condensates are petroleum gases which condense into liquids at
normal atmospheric pressure. Venezuela produces about 180,000
barrels a day of condensates, which are not included in OPEC oil
output quotas.
   He said the conference approved a ``scientific, technical
definition which is in agreement with the elements proposed by our
experts.'' The new definition prevents the reclassification of
crudes as condensates, he said.
   But he said an API grade ranging between 45 and 50 degrees is one
of five factors OPEC experts will take into account when defining a
condensate. Earlier, Venezuela had insisted on a definition that did
not include an API grade.
   He said the definition also allowed for an ``intermediate''
product which would be a ``temporary crude'' or a ``temporary
condensate.'' Other elements include gas@liquid ratios and octane
ratings, he said.
   Gil praised OPEC's new 18.5 million barrel production agreement
as ``giving OPEC again the credibility that it is capable of
organizing the world oil market.''
   He said the conference decided that oil loans between OPEC
members would be credited to the quota of the receiving nation.
   Gil said Venezuela hoped to increase its oil export revenue next
year by between $1.5 and $2 billion as a result of higher oil prices
and its new 1.64 million barrel-a-day quota.
   The new quota represents a 65,000 barrel increase over the old
one but a reduction in Venezuela's share of total OPEC production to
8.8 percent, from 9.5 percent.
   Venezuela's income from oil, petrochemicals and coal this year is
expected to be around $7.1 billion, assuming an average price of
about $13.50 per barrel, which does not include Tuesday's price hike
of one dollar per barrel for some of Venezuela's exports, he said.
