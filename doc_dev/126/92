   Linford Schultz and four companions
are taking a walk _ 30,000 miles across the world. They figure
it'll take them about four years.
   They've been under way since May, starting out from Georgetown,
Guyana, home of their Continent-to-Continent Adventure Club.
   ``We've had a bit of activity,'' said Lawrence Renville, the
27-year-old second in command after Schultz and the walk's chief
diarist.
   The purpose is manifold: to commemorate the 500th anniversary in
1992 of Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New World; the 400th
anniversary of the arrival of African slaves in the Western
Hemisphere, and the 23rd anniversary of the independence of Guyana,
their homeland.
   Their route will take them across the northern tip of South
America, through Central America and Mexico, across Texas and the
Gulf States and up the East Coast to Halifax, Nova Scotia, in
Canada. From there the group will cross the Atlantic by ship to
Ireland and cross Europe to Greece. They'll sail across the
Mediterannean to the Middle East and walk to Pakistan and India.
Then it will be by boat across the Indian Ocean to Africa.
   Their goal to reach is Goree Island near Dakar, Senegal, in
northwest Africa by 1992, the anniversary of Columbus' discovery of
America.
   But Goree was the transhipment point for most of the slave trade
that reached what now is Guyana, formerly British Guiana, on the
northern shoulder of South America.
   ``We might stay awhile and do some exploring before we come
home,'' said the 48-year-old Schultz, explaining why the group
might not be back to Guyana until 1993.
   Long walks are not new to Schultz _ he walked from Central
America to New York City in 1968 _ but for others in his group, the
four years away from loved ones was not an easy choice.
   ``My girlfriend was sad, but there's some things a man's got to
do,'' said 24-year-old Gerald Gonsalves.
   The walking party already has had a brush with trouble.
   After setting out from Georgetown on May 26, the 23rd
anniversary of Guyana's independence, the group hiked 300 miles to
the town of Wauna, on the Venezuelan border. There they arranged
with Warao Indians to use two shallow canoes to paddle up the
Cuyubini River to Curiapa at the mouth of te Orinoco River in
Venezuela.
   But the canoe in Schultz's command capsized in the wake of a
passing motorboat, pitching the occupants into the
crocodile-infested river and sending some $2,000 worth of
photographic and camping equipment to the bottom.
   The group continued on, however, and made it to Caracas, where
they have started a fund-raising effort to finance the next leg of
the trip _ up Central America to the United States.
   ``We've attracted some interest from private individuals and
charitable organizations,'' said Renville, a former insurance
salesman who said he had to quit his job because his boss refused
to give him four years off.
   The YMCA in Caracas is providing the group accommodations in
exchange for voluntary work, such as talking about their
experiences with schoolchildren, and cleaning up the grounds.
   ``By the time we reach the States we hope to have a camper,''
Schultz said.
   The idea is to send the camper ahead with the group's equipment
while they hike during the day with local organizations, promoting
friendship and motivating others to seek adventure.
   ``In the past there was a great demand for adventure,'' said
Schultz. ``In fact, it was the basis for settling the New World.
Today we have trips to the moon. But what we are doing is exploring
the minds of our neighbors. This is the most exciting thing we can
do.''
   The group was assembled from the different ethnic groups that
make up society Guyana _ white, black, Asian, Amerindian and
mulatto.
   The other two in the group are Compton Ferguson, 48, a former
merchant seaman, and Troy Dasraph, 24.
   Schultz and Ferguson started out together for the walk to New
York in 1968, but Ferguson dropped out after going part of the way.
Schultz wrote a book _ ``Continent to Continent'' _ about that walk.
   ``We didn't see each other for 18 years,'' Schultz said of
Ferguson. ``Now we are back on the road with these new guys. They
are green but someday they will be able to look back with pride on
the journey.''
   Schultz added: ``When you embark on a mission like this, it's
always like finding your way in the dark, but there are always
helping hands out there that make it worthwhile. But we have to be
careful in some countries in Latin America where the political
situation is dangerous.''
   The group plans on crossing into the United States sometime in
the late fall and wintering over before continuing up the East
Coast to Canada and on into Europe.
   Once back home in Guyana, the group plans to write a book.
