VENEZUELA'S national oil company, PDVSA, is investing more than USDollars
3.8bn to upgrade its two largest oil refineries. The investments are among
the largest in the world oil refining industry.
The company has placed a high priority on the investments and they are not
likely to be affected by budget cuts - anticipated this year because of
lower-than-expected world oil prices.
Upgradings are planned for the Cardon refinery, operated by PDVSA subsidiary
Maraven, and at the Amuay refinery, operated by Lagoven, another PDVSA
division.
The investments are intended to enhance product quality to meet future
environmental standards (especially those of the Clean Air Act in the US).
They are also designed to increase processing of heavy crude oils and to
raise profitability.
The two refineries, connected by a system of pipelines last year, have
combined crude oil processing capacity of 935,000 barrels per day. Viewed as
a single complex, that makes Amuay and Cardon the largest complex in the
world.
Cardon, with 300,000 b/d of processing capacity, is receiving investments of
Dollars 3bn. Outlays for a delayed coker, catalytic platformer,
isomerisation unit, and other projects will radically alter the refinery's
product slate. The facility now produces about 70 per cent distillates and
30 per cent high sulphur fuel oil. By 1994, the refinery is expected to
produce 90-95 per cent distillates and only 5-10 per cent fuel oil.
Investments at Amuay, which has a capacity of 635,000 b/d, will total
Dollars 818m. They cover a delayed coking facility and other units to raise
the quality of refined products and reduce emissions.
Both refineries are building plants to produce MTBE and TAME, oxygenates
used to replace lead in car petrol. International companies, including Fluor
Daniels and Foster Wheeler, are involved in the projects.
