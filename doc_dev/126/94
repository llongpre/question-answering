   Fearful of losing market share in a world awash with crude oil, more members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries are trying to move into oil refining in the U.S. and elsewhere. 

   Nigeria is the latest OPEC member to express serious interest in buying foreign refineries. 
Reports that Nigeria had been seeking "downstream," or refining and marketing, investments in the U.S. and Europe were confirmed Friday by Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister who also is president of OPEC. 

   Some others among OPEC's 13 member nations -- including Libya, Iran and the United Arab Emirates -- already hold niches in refining and product marketing in the oil-importing countries. 
And Saudi Arabia, the OPEC kingpin that has built huge export refineries at home, now has a team looking for similar investments in the U.S. and Europe. 
"The emphasis is downstream," said one Saudi official. 

   Kuwait and Venezuela clearly are the leaders of the new OPEC strategy. 
Kuwait's Q8 logo, for example, is becoming increasingly familiar across Europe, where it owns and operates refineries and thousands of service stations. 

   Unlike Kuwait, Petroleos de Venezuela prefers joint ventures. 
Going this route, it has secured outlets for some 500,000 barrels a day of its crude at refineries in West Germany, Sweden and the U.S. 
"Our present target is to increase this participation to some 700,000 barrels a day in the near future," Juan Chacin, president of Venezuela's national oil company, last week told a conference in Houston sponsored by Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 

   Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela have all had contact with Texaco Inc., according to a company source; Texaco has announced plans to take on joint-venture partners at some of its facilities. 
But Venezuela rules out entering into joint ventures with Coastal Corp., which said last week it was discussing the sale of a half-interest in its U.S. refining operations to certain foreign producers. 
"We have never talked to Coastal," Mr. Chacin said in an interview. 

   Traditionally, the oil industry was dominated by big international oil companies that were vertically integrated: They produced the crude, transported it to their own refineries, processed it and then marketed the petroleum products through their own outlets. 
The companies still dominate refining and marketing of petroleum products world-wide, but the OPEC countries now control much of the crude production. 

   For OPEC's members, downstream integration with the oil companies can ensure captive markets for crude exports. 
As an example, with today's abundance of oil in world markets, both Kuwait and Venezuela continue to produce as much crude as their OPEC quotas permit, while most of the other exporters are having to sharply reduce output. 

   For the refiners, a link with a crude-producing country can provide stable supplies at a competitive cost. 
W. Dennis Eklof, an official of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, cites this "commonality of interest" between crude exporters and refiners as "the essence of the drive toward industry reintegration.' 

   Oil experts say it's unclear how the U.S. and European governments may react when they find OPEC gaining an increasing share of the world's refining industry. 
But J. Robinson West, president of Petroleum Finance Co., sees positive implications for the U.S. from downstream integration by the producers. 
"It links their (crude) reserves with our markets," he says.
