    [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 
reports on economic developments monitored through 10 May. 
  The Venezuelan Central Bank issued a communique the night of 
2 May indicating that the Consumer Price Index registered a 3.3 
percent increase in April. This increase, added to the figures 
accumulated through March, reveals a 12.6 percent inflation rate 
for the first quarter of 1994. (Caracas EL GLOBO in Spanish 3 
May 94 p 11) 
  Today, Venezuelan Central Bank sources revealed that the 
drop 
in international reserves for April was estimated at $900 
million. According to these sources, the drop in reserves during 
the first quarter of 1994 was due to falling oil revenues, 
mistrust unleashed by the Banco Latino scandal, and huge foreign 
debt payments. (Paris AFP in Spanish 1604 GMT 5 May 94) 
  During the first quarter of 1994, Citgo Petroleum 
Corporation, a subsidiary of Venezuelan Petroleum in the United 
States, registered net profits of $43.300 million, which 
represents a 133 percent increase over profits registered during 
the same period in 1993. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 5 May 
94 p E-7) 
  Berend Roosen, president of the National Council of Commerce 
and Services, pointed out that his organization is not 
responsible for the recent outbreak of price increases resulting 
from the devaluation of the bolivar. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in 
Spanish 5 May 94 p E-8) 
  In light of the fiscal crisis, the government is considering 
selling between 10 and 20 percent of the shares of the National 
Telephone Company of Venezuela for the second half of 1994 as a 
last resort. (Caracas EL NACIONAL in Spanish 5 May 94 p E-8) 
  It has been unofficially reported that international 
reserves 
dropped $900 million in April. The sources added that the 
largest drop was reported between 25 and 29 April when it was 
announced that the president of the Central Bank of Venezuela 
would be resigning and an interest rate drop was possible. 
Central Bank of Venezuela authorities said the bank will not 
release official figures for the month of April. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 5 May 94 p E-1) 
  Financial sources have reported that between January and 
April, the eight banks for whom the state has intervened have 
had to pay $550 billion bolivars. The run on the banks forced 
the institutions to turn to the government. According to recent 
studies conducted by the Banks Superintendency, overall losses 
amount to approximately 359 billion bolivars. (Caracas EL 
NACIONAL in Spanish 7 May 94 p E- 1) 
  Between 1 January and 6 May, the bolivar has been devaluated 
22.8 percent. A marketing research firm reported that this will 
represent reduced purchasing power and greater unemployment. 
(Caracas EL UNIVERSAL in Spanish 8 May 94 p 2-1) 
  The Foreign Trade Institute has reported that Colombia has 
replaced the United States as the main market for Venezuelan 
nonpetroleum products. In 1993, Venezuela exported $808.237 
million in nonpetroleum products to Colombia. (Paris AFP in 
Spanish 2114 GMT 9 May 94)
