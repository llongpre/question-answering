   NEW YORK -- Venezuela's state oil company, Petroleos de
Venezuela S.A., plans shortly to invite U.S. and some other
foreign companies to invest in its refining sector, company
officials said.
   Any agreements would probably result in supply guarantees
to companies taking equity stakes in Venezuelan refineries,
the officials said.

   "It is clear that if somebody has a venture with us, that
would involve long-term supply contracts," Antonio Cassela,
the oil company's director of planning, said in a telephone
interview.
   The move appears to mark a significant policy shift for
the company, which since its nationalization in 1976 hasn't
allowed foreign investment in the petroleum sector.
   Recent projects aimed at producing and exporting liquefied
natural gas and gasoline additives have, however, seemed to
many to open cracks in Venezuela's policy of state ownership
of hydrocarbon resources -- though Petroleos de Venezuela
officials note that foreign capital in the chemicals sector
has never been completely barred.
   The outbreak of the Persian Gulf crisis last August and
oil consumers' increasing desire for politically secure
supplies have given new impetus to Venezuelan plans to seek a
bigger share of the U.S. market, company officials said.
   Venezuela, which holds the world's fifth largest oil
reserves, is seeking to lock in buyers for its oil with an
eye to a future in which Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries production quotas aren't any longer in force,
analysts said.
   Officials at the oil company concede it will be years
before foreign companies become significant refiners in
Venezuela. But they say there is little time to lose, with
oil prices apparently heading lower and oil accounting for
more than 70% of the nation's revenue.
   "Yes, it will be years, but it's quite possible that the
whole OPEC quota system will be obsolete by then," agreed
John Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation Inc., a consulting group.
   The Caribbean is another obvious potential oil source for
the U.S. But, Mr. Lichtblau said, "we are already getting a
lot of product from there." He and others say part of
Venezuela's longer-term strategy may be to divert U.S.
refiners' interest away from building plants in that region.
   Last November, Coastal Corp. began processing at a
revamped 100,000-barrel-a-day capacity refinery at San
Nicolas in Aruba. The company has plans to boost its capacity
there to 150,000 barrels a day by year's end.
   Details of Petroleos de Venezuela's proposals to foreign
refiners aren't yet available. But Enzio D'Angelo, the
company's director for new ventures and strategic issues,
said, "this time we aren't afraid to go to the {Venezuelan}
Congress," which must approve any foreign ventures with
state-owned companies.
   "Congress understands now that we can't go by ourselves,"
he said. Venezuela's Oil Ministry is said to endorse the
plan.
   "We have been told by the ministry and the president that
we must now take advantage of our reserves," said the oil
company's Mr. Cassela.
   Cyrus Tahmassebi, Ashland Oil Inc.'s chief economist,
says: "Given the current glut of crude on the world market,
the long-term trend line for prices is below pre-Gulf war
projections, and stronger long-term refining margins will be
the result, prompting aggressive moves to boost refining
capacity. A lot of people see the {oil} glut coming, and you
will see more of this happening."
