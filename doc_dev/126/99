THE GREGOS
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court):
Mr Justice Evans:
January 31 1992
THE ILLEGITIMACY of a last voyage ordered by time charterers is established
at or before the time for compliance, and not when the order is given, in
that the breach of charter lies in the failure to give a lawful order; and
accordingly, shipowners are entitled to treat the charterparty as repudiated
if, before compliance is due, the order, though reasonable when given, is
rendered unreasonable by unforeseen circumstances and is not replaced by a
further order for a legitimate voyage.
Mr Justice Evans so held when dismissing an appeal by Arni Torvald Klaveness
A/S Maritime Corporation, time charterers of the Gregos, from an arbitration
award by Mr Mark Hamsher that they were liable to the owners, Arni Maritime
Corporation, for breach of charter arising out of overrun of the charter
period.
HIS LORDSHIP said that a time charter on the New York Produce Exchange form
dated December 30 1987, provided for delivery off Antwerp, and for the
vessel to be employed as charterers should direct for 'about 50 to maximum
70 days'.
Redelivery was to take place at a port in the Gibraltar/Hamburg range.
The vessel was delivered on January 8 1988. The arbitrator held that
redelivery became due at expiry of 70 days, on March 18, with no further
tolerance or margin. Both parties accepted that finding.
After proceeding to South America in ballast, the vessel performed two
voyages from Trombetas in Brazil, carrying bauxite cargoes to Matansaz on
the River Orinoco in Venezuela. She completed discharge of the second voyage
on February 25.
The charterers had instructed the master to proceed from Matansaz to Palua,
another port on the Orinoco nearer the river mouth, and to load a cargo of
iron ore for delivery at Fos in Italy.
On February 9 when the instructions were given they were reasonable. They
allowed for discharge at Fos and redelivery off Gibraltar on or before March
18.
But by February 25 when the vessel completed discharge at Matansaz, the
timetable had become unworkable, because another vessel had grounded in the
river and was obstructing the navigable channel between Palua and the river
mouth.
The vessel proceeded to Palua and gave notice of readiness to load there on
February 25. But the owners were unwilling to proceed with the laden voyage
to Fos.
The charterers insisted that the orders were legitimate. The owners said
that unless legitimate orders were given they would treat the charterers as
being in repudiatory breach of charter and withdraw the vessel.
A without-prejudice agreement was made on February 29. The vessel then
performed the voyage under reserve of rights and was redelivered eight days
late on March 26.
On the present appeal, the first issue was as to the date on which the
legitimacy of the voyage had to be established. The charterers contended it
was the date when the order was given. The owners contended, and the
arbitrator awarded, that it was the date when the order became effective and
the vessel was required to comply with it.
The owners' alternative submission was that if a voyage which was legitimate
when the order was given became illegitimate due to change of circumstances
before the time for compliance arrived, then the charterers were under a
secondary obligation to replace it with a further order for legitimate
voyage which the owner was bound to perform.
The arbitrator held that the Court of Appeal decision in The Democritos
(1976) 2 Lloyd's Rep 149 was binding authority that the time for evaluation
of the charterers' orders was when the vessel was about to commence her last
full voyage, that being the time when she became free of her previous
commitments.
In The Democritos, the principal issue was whether a charter for the period
of a trip should be treated as a time or voyage charter.
Mr Justice Kerr held it was subject to the same redelivery rules as a time
charter, and as to whether the charterers were in breach, he said it was
clear that when sending or ordering the vessel on her last voyage 'there
could be no expectation' that she would be redelivered in time.
In the Court of Appeal, with regard to application of the 'legitimate
voyage' test, Lord Denning doubted that it was correct to look to see
whether the charterer had been planning the ship's voyages reasonably,
instead of at the last voyage itself.
He said 'the right way . . . is to look at the last full voyage and see
whether it is a legitimate last voyage or not'.
Mr Young submitted that that comment was obiter and the case did not involve
a decision whether the date of the order or of the last voyage was the
correct time for applying the legitimacy test.
That submission was technically correct. But the judgments of both Mr
Justice Kerr and the Court of Appeal carried much weight in their own right.
Moreover, the clearest statement of the law in any of the authorities came
from the case where the issue most nearly arose for decision.
The charterers' contention must be rejected. It would mean, if correct, that
a charterer could choose a time well in advance of the last voyage and the
instructions, if reasonable at that time, would remain binding on the vessel
regardless of subsequent events, unless he chose to issue further
instructions at any time until shortly before the last voyage began.
The weight of authority and the balance of practical considerations
supported that conclusion.
Mr Young's submission that a reasonable estimate could not be made until the
time for the last voyage was close seemed fallacious. A reasonable estimate
could often be made a very long time in advance. Its firmness would depend
on the circumstances and tend to increase as the time approached, but no way
of measuring firmness was suggested.
Nor was the court persuaded that the owners' primary submission was correct,
namely that the lawfulness of the order could never be determined until, or
shortly before, the time for performance arrived.
The charterers' obligation was to give a lawful order before the last voyage
began.
Whenever the order was given its lawfulness could be tested, and then the
shipowner might accept it in circumstances where he could not subsequently
refuse to perform it when the time for performance came.
Subject to such advance acceptance the owner's obligation was to perform
whatever orders the charterers gave or had given, when the time for
performance arrived.
That view of the law was closer to the owners' alternative submission than
to their first.
It also meant that charterers' obligation to give voyage instructions was
similar to their obligation to order the vessel only to safe ports. If a
port, safe when ordered, became unsafe, then a secondary obligation to
change the order arose. There was no distinction in principle between the
two cases, save that the charterer remained at risk of a port becoming
unsafe after the vessel had proceeded to it.
The second issue was whether the charterers committed a repudiatory breach.
Mr Young submitted they did not, because the arbitrator found that the
estimated overrun was not repudiatory in nature from a commercial point of
view.
The charterers contended that their obligation to give legitimate orders
must be distinguished from their obligation to redeliver at the end of the
charter period; and that the owners might refuse to obey an illegitimate
order, but could only refuse further performance if there was an
anticipatory and therefore repudiatory breach.
The court accepted that there were two separate obligations. But the
charterers' breach, when an illegitimate voyage was ordered and insisted on,
was in failing to give a lawful order with which the vessel could comply.
The legitimate voyage test did not permit of any overrun once the last date
for redelivery had been determined, and if the charterer persisted in
ordering a non-contractual last voyage, then the owner was entitled to
accept that as a repudiatory breach.
The owners succeeded on both issues. The appeal was dismissed.
For the charterers: Timothy Young (Sinclair Roche &amp; Temperley).
For the shipowners: Peter Gross (Ince &amp; Co).
