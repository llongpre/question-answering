<HEAD>Head Of Government Inquiry Into Aboriginal Deaths Resigns</HEAD>

   The head of a government probe on the
deaths of 104 aborigines in police custody has resigned, and
indigenous activists today called the decision a devastating blow to
the inquiry.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said James Muirhead, federal court judge
since 1977, resigned late Thursday to become administrator of the
Northern Territory.
   Aboriginal groups called the decision a blow to their cause and
expressed concern that the inquiry, set up in 1987 to investigate 44
aboriginal deaths in police custody since 1980, could be downgraded.
   Since the inquiry began, the number of aboriginal deaths in
police custody has grown to 104, and Muirhead had said the increased
number would extend his work _ expected to be completed last month _
two years minimum.
   Aboriginal activists have charged police brutality as the cause.
   An interim report issued last month recommended aboriginal
recruits replace white police officers suspected of racism and that
drunkenness be abolished as a crime for aborigines.
   Most aborigines have died in police cells by hanging after being
picked up on charges of being drunk and disorderly.
   Hawke said Muirhead, who also was the judge in the Lindy
Chamberlain trial, would continue in his job until April. The
Chamberlain trial was the basis for the recent U.S. movie starring
Meryl Streep entitled ``A Cry in the Dark.''
   The Black Action Group and the Committee to Defend Black Rights,
which represents many of the families of aborigines who have died in
custody, urged the federal government ensure that justice is not
denied the country's indigenous population following Muirhead's
resignation.
   Aborigines, Australia's original inhabitants, number about
160,000, or 1 percent of the 16 million population. Government
figures statistics show aborigines are socially and economically
deprived.
   Aboriginal activists declared last year's Bicentennial marking
European settlement a year of mourning.
   Muirhead, 63, said aborigines should not fear the probe will wind
down.
   ``I think the commission is well established,'' he said.
   No replacement was immediately named.
