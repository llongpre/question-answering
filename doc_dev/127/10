THE AUSTRALIAN govern-ment yesterday proposed a sweeping package to protect
private mining and pastoral leases from aboriginal land claims. The 33-point
package includes legislation that would validate land titles issued between
1975 and the end of this month.
The move came on the eve of the first anniversary of a high court decision
which, for the first time, acknowledged that indigenous people had occupied
Australia before European settlement and still had rights to the land under
common law. Since that decision, aboriginal land councils have been
preparing to present claims in various courts around Australia.
One aboriginal tribe in the state of New South Wales recently lodged a writ
calling for the commonwealth and state governments to give up almost a
quarter of the state.
The government package also proposes to establish a formula under which
federal and state governments would share compensation payments to
aboriginal groups that might incur losses when leases are granted to private
holders. It also calls for the setting up of a special tribunal to deal with
aboriginal land claims.
Aboriginal land council officials have called the package a 'slimy and
useless piece of paper'. Meanwhile, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Commission insists on veto power over land development, and on
mining royalties for development on land with native titles.
Mr Robert Tickner, the minister for aboriginal affairs, said the package was
on the table for discussion. 'It is not set in concrete,' he said.
The government has already attempted legislation to protect a large
development project in the Northern Territory. Last week it supported a
local government bill that would override native titles covering leases to a
ADollars 300m (Pounds 134m) lead-zinc mining project.
The McArthur river project, proposed to be developed by the Australian
mining group MIM and its Japanese partners, is expected to earn ADollars
200m a year in exports.
Australia's foreign debt as at the end of the March quarter stood at
ADollars 160.6bn (Pounds 72bn), a fall of 3.9 per cent from the figure at
the end of the previous December quarter.
This was the first quarterly fall in almost three years and was attributed
to debt repayments made by both the public and private sectors taking
advantage of lower interest rates.
The figure is, however, 7.9 per cent higher than at the end of the March
quarter last year.
Of the net foreign debt, the private sector accounted for 65 per cent or
ADollars 104.6m.
The ratio of the net foreign debt to GDP was 40.6 per cent, down 1.9 per
cent at the end of the previous quarter.
A permanent reduction in Australia's foreign debt is unlikely in the
foreseeable future because of the continuing high current account deficit.
