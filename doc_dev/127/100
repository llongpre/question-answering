FT  11 MAY 92 / Australian states join forces against reform: Hopes of
agreement with PM Keating at talks today are slim

MR Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, will meet the eight state
and territory leaders in Canberra today in an attempt to revive moribund
talks on reform of federal/state relations.
However, the signals from state capitals suggest that agreement on fiscal
and administrative reforms remains as elusive as when the talks broke down
last year.
Mr Ray Groom, the Tasmanian Liberal premier, probably spoke for most of the
state leaders when he accused Mr Keating yesterday of taking a 'financially
homicidal' approach to the talks. 'He is really strangling the states to
death,' Mr Groom said.
The gloomy prognosis contrasts with the rapid progress achieved after Mr Bob
Hawke, the former prime minister, announced his vision of a 'new federalism'
in the wake of Labor's election victory in March 1990. Among other
achievements, Mr Hawke persuaded the states to reduce barriers to interstate
trade, co-operate on transport reforms, and move towards mutual recognition
of trade and professional qualifications.
But the reform process broke down last year after Mr Keating attacked a deal
to correct the imbalance between the states' narrow tax-raising powers and
their growing responsibility for delivering government services.
The solution proposed by Mr Hawke was to give the states a guaranteed share
of federal personal and corporate income tax receipts to supplement the
property and stamp taxes on which they rely for revenue. But that proved too
much for Mr Keating and other Labor centralists, who saw it as a threat to
the party's historical use of federal control of the national purse strings
to determine social policy.
Mr Keating has made some conciliatory overtures to the states since
replacing Mr Hawke in December. But although he has won praise for his
willingness to reopen negotiations, the two sides appear to have sharply
differing agendas for today's talks.
The federal government's priority will be to secure state co-operation for a
series of economic and administrative initiatives announced by Mr Keating in
February.
Most of Mr Keating's energy is likely to focus on plans for the creation of
national rail and electricity networks, and transfer of the states' ADollars
2bn (Pounds 800m) technical and further education programmes to the federal
government.
The prime minister also wants guarantees that the states will implement
costly recommendations by a royal commission by investigating the deaths of
nearly 100 aborigines in police custody.
The state leaders will accept much of what Mr Keating has to say. But for
perhaps the first time in the history of federal-state negotiations, they
are presenting a united front on the need for urgent fiscal reform.
The state leaders agreed at a planning meeting in Melbourne last month to
continue pressing for a greater share of federal tax revenues, and claimed
the states' ADollars 7bn debt could grow to ADollars 12bn by 1997 if nothing
was done.
Mr Keating will do his best to avoid starting an outright battle with the
states in the run-up to the next federal election, due by mid-1993. But
several federal ministers have indicated recently that the government is
likely to tell the states to balance their books by cutting costs.
The federal government may also try to divide the states by proposing
changes to the fiscal equalisation formula, which attempts to maintain a
consistent level of government services by transferring revenue from the
bigger states to the smaller states and territories.
