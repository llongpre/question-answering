   A group of Aborigines declared a
provisional government today, claiming they have been neglected for
decades by state and federal governments and see little prospect
for change.
   Michael Mansell, secretary of the Aboriginal Provisional
Government, said it would be autonomous, raise its own funds, have
its own passports and seek recognition by foreign governments.
   ``It is a political body set up to provide leadership to the
aspirations of Aboriginal people,'' the Aboriginal activist told a
news conference. ``All we are asking is the right to control
ourselves on our own land. We don't want to interfere with you
people, but just leave us alone as well.''
   It was not immediately clear what effect, if any, the
declaration would have. The 1981 census said Australia had about
160,000 Aborigines, comprising less than 1 percent of the
population at the time.
   Estimates indicate the country had 300,000 or more Aborigines,
the indigenous people, when European settlers arrived.
   ``We would set ourselves a stage that in 20 to 30 years from
now, we would actually have enough land in this country so that
Aboriginal people could raise their own economy, legal system and
run their own government on it,'' Mansell said.
   The new government received an early rebuff when Federal
Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner canceled a meeting set
for Thursday with Mansell and other Aboriginal representatives to
discuss the return of ancestoral Aboriginal skeletal remains from
overseas.
   A spokesman for Tickner said the minister would not meet any
representatives of a provisional Aboriginal government.
   Mansell said the provisional government would encourage local
Aboriginal communities to take back what they consider their land
by squatting on it and would provide them with financial and
``people'' support to resist police and government attempts to
remove them.
   However, Mansell said the provisional government was purely a
political body and would not compete with any government bodies
that provide services to Aboriginal people.
   He said the provisional government's main aims were obtaining
land rights, gaining control over Aboriginal culture and heritage,
and pursuing the return of the Aboriginal skeletal remains from
overseas.
   Mansell denied the new government would cause greater division
between Aborigines and whites.
   ``There will always be divisions in this country because there
are two distinct peoples and there is nothing wrong with being
different,'' he said. ``The only thing that's wrong with people
being different is where one group imposes its will upon another.''
   Funding for the new government would be provided by a system of
rent payments, the sale of Aboriginal passports and donations.
   Under the rent-payment system, already in operation in Victoria
state, sympathetic whites who believe in Aboriginal sovereignty
over the continent pay nominal rent to the black community.
