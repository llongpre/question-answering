INVESTORS in the Australian mining, pastoral and timber industries were
yesterday thrown into confusion by a deadlock in talks between federal and
state governments on how to deal with aboriginal land claims.
And while the officials grappled with a definition of 'native land title'
the Australian High Court has been flooded with aboriginal claims covering
vast tracts of land, including the whole of the Canberra region. Large areas
in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland are also being claimed.
The meeting between Mr Paul Keating, prime minister, and state premiers was
to have drawn up a national procedure to deal with aboriginal land claims
triggered by the so-called Mabo decision handed down by the High Court a
year ago. The court recognised that native titles existed before European
occupation of Australia.
The decision abolished the accepted doctrine that Australia was no one's
land when the Europeans arrived. As a result of the decision, aboriginal
groups able to demonstrate a continuing link with an area of land are now
able to claim native titles.
Mr Keating's Labor government has accepted the principle of native titles,
and has tried to get agreement from state governments to establish tribunals
to hear and resolve claims to them. And in a move to protect mining and
business leases that might be covered by aboriginal claims, Mr Keating has
proposed to introduce legislation validating leases granted between 1975 and
the time of the Mabo decision in 1992. He has also proposed compensation be
paid to Aborigines suffering losses from such leases.
While the state governments agreed to legislate and validate leases, two of
the most resource-rich states, Victoria and Western Australia, have rejected
the Mabo decision, arguing that state parliaments could legislate to
extinguish native titles.
Mr Keating has now threatened to introduce federal legislation to force
state governments to come into line.
