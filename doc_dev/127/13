FT  11 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Government supports mine over
aborigine land claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S federal government, under pressure from miners and state
governments, yesterday gave its support to a Queensland aluminium and
bauxite project that promises 2,000 jobs but is under threat from an
aboriginal land claim.
Mr Michael Lavarch, the attorney general, said legislation protecting
Comalco's Weipa project, the first working mine to be hit by a native title
claim, may be introduced in September. 'The mining leases which Comalco hold
will be validated,' he said in a radio interview.
The Weipa bauxite mine leases are included in a claim by the aboriginal Wik
people for more than 35,000 sq km of land on the western side of Cape York
peninsula.
A landmark 1992 high court case, known as the Mabo case after one of the
aboriginal litigants, established aboriginal native title. It ruled that
where aborigines could prove a continuing relationship with their
traditional lands, their native title might not have been extinguished by
white settlement.
Comalco, 67 per cent owned by CRA, had said the aboriginal claim would scare
off lenders from a planned ADollars 1.83bn (Pounds 830m) expansion of its
smelter and electricity generating operations at the port of Gladstone.
It declined to comment on Mr Lavarch's remarks. But Mr Lauchlan McIntosh,
executive director of the Australian Mining Industry Council, praised the
move. 'Mr Lavarch has seen the value of the project to Australia,' he said.
