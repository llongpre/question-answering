FT  14 DEC 93 / Land bill leaves Australians unclear where they stand: An
Aborigine rights law that pleases few

Noel Pearson, a 28-year-old lawyer, tells a group of Australian senators why
he, and fellow Aborigines, negotiated a milestone land rights deal with the
government: 'It was a salvage exercise - a desperate salvage exercise.'
Michael Mansell, speaking for the more radical Aboriginal Alliance
Committee, tells the senators that the proposed legislation which has come
out of those negotiations and could be passed into law this week, would do
little to help his people. Worse, it could impede their rights in some
areas.
Both men are presenting their views in a Canberra committee room which, with
its air-conditioning and wood-panelling, is far from the scorched red earth
at the centre of this fight. There, everyone agrees, Aborigine communities
with rudimentary education and limited access to information, have little
hope of grasping the complex legal tussle that is going on.
'I can't say that half of Aborigines have any understanding of this bill,'
says Mr Mansell.
The Australian government's native title bill is also perplexing the
business community. Lawyers for the nation's mining and resource-based
companies have spent weeks scouring the wording and wondering whether money
poured into project development would now be secure from lengthy legal
battles.
'Let's put it like this. The lawyers haven't found any problems - yet,' says
one mining executive, when asked about the likely go-ahead for a stalled
multi-million-dollar deal. Summing up the general concern, Mr John Prescott,
head of BHP, Australia's largest industrial company, has likened the
legislation to 'reading porridge'.
For all the confusion, its significance is difficult to understate. In
simple economic terms, land-related industries are crucial to the nation's
prosperity. Mining and agriculture, for example, account for about 7.5 per
cent of gross domestic product and provide more than 60 per cent of
merchandise exports.
The native title bill represents an attempt by today's Australia to come to
terms with a less than glorious aspect of its past. When European settlers
first arrived in Botany Bay in the late 18th century, they worked on the
premise that land was uninhabited. This was despite an evident indigenous
population who were simply 'dispossessed'. This was compounded by decades of
shoddy treatment meted out to the Aboriginal community. A law prohibiting
racial discrimination came into force only in 1975.
Unemployment is high among indigenous people and social conditions are poor.
Tensions lurk close to the surface. The death recently of Daniel Yock, a
young Aborigine dancer who had been arrested in a Brisbane street brawl,
prompted riotous demonstrations, allegations of police brutality, and a
public inquiry.
The immediate catalyst for some form of native title legislation has been
legal rather than moral, however. Last year, the Australian high court
decreed that native title could exist where Aborigines had maintained a
close and continuing relationship with the land, although it added that land
titles acquired under accepted law since European settlement should not be
disturbed. The bill is an attempt to marry these two pronouncements.
In essence it provides for a system of 'validating' existing land titles.
Where this happened, and except in the case of mining leases, native title
claims would be extinguished. In the case of mining leases, native title
would be allowed to stand alongside an existing lease, then take over when
that lease expired.
However, where a genuine native title claim was extinguished, compensation
would be paid by state or federal government. A system of tribunals would be
set up to handle claims and adjudicate on compensation matters. Native title
holders or claimants would have negotiating rights over the land in question
but no veto right.
The compromise nature of the legislation means that its likely practical
implications please no one. On the Aborigine side, it is estimated that no
more than 10 per cent of the indigenous population would have any chance of
successfully asserting native title claims. In most cases, victorious claims
would be levelled against vacant Crown land, the largest amounts of which
lie in western Australia.
This makes all important the federal government's promise of a land fund to
help the majority of Aborigines who did not gain from the bill. 'The only
way my people in Cape York are going to benefit is via the land fund,' says
Mr Pearson, for example. But the dollar amount has yet to be spelt out.
Moreover, as more radical voices such as Mr Mansell's point out, even where
Aborigines do establish native title they would not get back everything
which the land holds. Mineral rights, for instance, would remain with the
Crown.
While the mining and pastoral industries know that government would pick up
compensation costs, this would not prevent long hearings to establish native
title rights. In theory, the private sector should be no more than a
bystander in this process; in practice, it would probably incur legal and
other costs.
Meanwhile, the ability of native title claimants or holders to negotiate
over developments may lead to unwanted delays. Such uncertainties - and
there are others - could affect the availability and cost of project
finance, it is argued. The nation's biggest mining companies warned this
month that the need to establish the native title position before beginning
exploration would divert the industry's investment abroad. 'You'll see the
exploration dollar vote with its feet,' says one executive.
And for the general public, there is the big unanswered question of how much
the compensation claims would cost, but the government refuses to be drawn.
One Treasury official has hinted that higher taxes may be down the road.
Opposition leaders have warned that the sums, including the land fund, could
be considerable; the government says it is impossible to assess, although it
expects that the number of successful native title claims would be limited.
Judging by opinion polls, this leaves the public as wary as everyone else
about the legislation's merits.
