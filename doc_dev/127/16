Australian miners - A judgment named after an obscure aborigine is
threatening the industry

IN MINING circles, the best known name in Australia is not Paul Keating, the
prime minister, but Eddie Mabo, an obscure aboriginal activist who lived all
his life on an isolated island off the tropical north coast. Mr Mabo, who
died last year, gave his name to a historic judgment by Australia's High
Court which many mining companies claim is a threat to the future of the
resources industry.
Both the Labor government and the conservative opposition have played down
the implications of the Mabo case, partly in order to avoid a damaging row
with aboriginal activists. However, Australia's approaching federal election
has focussed attention on the multitude of questions raised by the case that
will face whichever is in government after polling day, March 13.
The uncertainty flows from a High Court ruling that Mr Mabo's Meriam
aboriginal group owns Murray Island, which lies in the Torres Strait between
Australia and New Guinea. The significance of this is the court's
recognition that a form of 'native title' may exist where ownership of land
has not been explicitly transferred to private hands - for example, by
freehold sale.
The judgment was greeted with jubilation by aboriginal activists because it
extinguishes the constitutional doctrine that Australia was terra nullius,
or unoccupied, when European settlement began in 1788.
In the long-term, the judgment will help to legitimise aboriginal claims
that Australia's indigenous inhabitants were disposessed by British settlers
and may increase pressure on the government to negotiate a treaty. More
immediately, however, it has prompted claims from aborigines and mining
groups alike that other areas, many of which include mines or mining
prospects, may be open to similar land claims.
Already, aboriginal groups have indicated that ownership claims will be made
on much of the Kimberleys region of Western Australia and the Nabalco
bauxite mine at Gove in the Northern Territory. Other claims have been
discussed, though not yet filed, on MIM Holdings' McArthur River
lead/zinc/silver project in the territory and most of central Brisbane, the
state capital of Queensland. More claims are likely according to Mr Mick
Dodson, director of the Northern Land Council, an aboriginal advisory group,
who says 'blanket land claims' across Australia are likely to prove a 'gold
mine' for aborigines.
The ruling was the last straw for many people in the mining industry, which
was already concerned about the federal government's decision to block a
gold project at Coronation Hill because of Aboriginal religious objections.
Sir Arvi Parbo, chairman of Western Mining Corporation, says the ruling
raises doubts about the legality of existing mines and warns that new
projects may be delayed or cancelled.
Ironically, the federal government has made determined efforts over the last
year to overcome unease about the Coronation Hill decision by establishing a
'fast tracking' approval mechanism for major projects. The accelerated
approval procedure is likely to be undermined, however, if projects are made
the subject of land claims relying on the precedent of the Mabo decision.
MIM, for example, received approval within nine months for the ADollars 250m
(Pounds 120m) McArthur River project. It believes it holds legal title to
the area and intends to press on with development.
It is not clear, however, how the title granted under existing legislation
would be affected if the Northern Land Council went ahead with its threat to
file a land claim. This is because the High Court judgment says that native
title exists only where aboriginal groups can prove continuous occupation or
close association with the land being claimed. In addition, the extent of
the native title would depend on the traditional rights of the aborigines
concerned, which might vary from full ownership to hunting or fishing
rights. A further complication is that native title is likely to have been
extinguished by mining titles issued before 1975, most of which effectively
transferred the land to private ownership. However, most mining titles
issued since 1975 would not extinguish native title because of the
provisions of the federal Racial Discrimination Act, which prevents the
abolition of land claim rights without compensation.
Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC's managing director, has called on the federal
government to ease the problem by repealing the Race Discrimination Act.
However, such a step is unlikely because it would breach Australia's
international treaty obligations.
An alternative approach would be for mining companies to reach specific
agreements with local aboriginal groups under which they would trade
compensation for a binding agreement that no land claim would be made.
Zapopan, a small mining company, recently reached such an agreement with the
Jawoyn aborigines which will allow the development of a gold mine at Mount
Todd, about 300 km (180 miles) south of Darwin. Other mining groups say,
however, that this strategy is fraught with danger because of the fragmented
nature of aboriginal society.
'It is impossible to know whether the people signing have the authority to
sign on behalf of all the groups which may have an association with the
area,' says an executive involved in land claims negotiations.
Faced with this uncertainty both the government and the Liberal/National
Party coalition have promised consultations with aboriginal and mining
groups to try to find an agreed solution. The coalition has said it would
legislate 'if necessary', but has not explained how the legislation would
work. Nor has it supported threats by the conservative Northern Territory
government to block land claims by legislation.
Mr Gregory McIntyre, the Perth lawyer who represented Mr Mabo, says it may
be possible to resolve some of the claims by negotiation, or by legislation
that clarifies aboriginal rights. But the complexity of the judgment means
that many cases will have to be decided by the courts, prolonging the
uncertainty for miners and aborigines alike.
'The only alternative would be for the High Court to rule in the next test
case that mining rights extinguish native title (in all cases),' Mr McIntyre
says. 'That would put an ened to all the uncertainty. But if the court rules
favourably for the Aboriginal people then there would be a drawn out process
of claims being made.'
