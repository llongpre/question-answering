MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, is to present draft
legislation to his cabinet on Monday setting out a system for deciding land
claims lodged by Aborigine groups.
The legislation could then be delivered to parliament in a matter of weeks.
In Canberra yesterday, Mr Keating said the proposed legislation would allow
Aborigine groups to choose either federal or state jurisdictions, recognised
by the Commonwealth, for the hearing of native title claims.
Some states had argued that all native title decisions should lie in their
hands. However, Mr Keating added that decisions over the economic use of
native title land would remain exclusively with Commonwealth-approved state
tribunals.
'Existing grants of interest will be validated and be secure, and the states
and territories will continue to have the capacity to manage land if they
meet the standards of the Commonwealth bill,' he said.
Mr Keating indicated that native title could, under the government's
legislation, co-exist with some existing leasehold titles, but he did not
detail which leases would come under this category. Aborigine groups have
been pushing to extend an earlier proposal that mining leases should be the
only significant class of leases not to extinguish native title. They have
been seeking to ensure that native title could sit alongside pastoral,
tourism or forestry leases, and revive once these expired.
The issue of Aborigine land rights has been contentious for the past 18
months. In May 1992, the High Court quashed the notion that Australia had
been unoccupied before European settlement and indicated that native title
could apply where Aborigines had maintained close association with the land.
This prompted an outcry from the mining industry, generated concerns among
international investors and pitted some state governments against the
Commonwealth.
