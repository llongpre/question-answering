MIM HOLDINGS, the Australian resources group, is considering a potential
claim by an aboriginal group for ownership of the site of its McArthur River
lead/zinc/silver project in the Northern Territory.
MIM has received a letter from the Northern Land Council, an aboriginal
advisory group, seeking consultations about the project on behalf of
aborigines in the territory and in northern Queensland. This follows
suggestions by the council that a legal claim for ownership of the land
might be filed unless MIM agreed to provide jobs and compensation to
aborigines claiming connection with the area.
MIM and a group of Japanese joint venturers received permission to develop
the mine last year after complying with the environmental and planning
regulations of the federal and territorial governments.
However, the status of some mining rights has been thrown into doubt by a
High Court decision last year that overthrew the legal doctrine that
Australia was terra nullius, or unoccupied, when European settlement began
in 1788. The decision created a form of 'native title' applying to
government-owned land where aboriginal groups can prove uninterrupted
occupation or a continuous close relationship.
A legal claim for ownership of McArthur River could delay development of the
mine, which is 70 per cent owned by MIM. Nippon Mining and Metals owns 15
per cent, and Mitsui, Mitsubishi Materials and Marubeni 5 per cent each.
The land council's action angered the territory's government, which claimed
that aboriginal and environmental opposition to mining has reduced
investment proposals.
Mr Shane Stone, mines and energy minister, said the threat of a land claim
against McArthur River was 'beyond the pale'. He said the project was 'too
important to become another Coronation Hill' - a gold project in the
Northern Territory that was blocked in 1991 after the federal government
accepted aboriginal claims that the site was sacred.
The territory government did not make clear how it planned to overcome the
provisions of federal race discrimination legislation.
The federal Labor government and the conservative opposition have said that
land claims should be resolved by negotiation.
