<HEAD>Probe Into Aborigine Deaths Looks At Why More Go To Jail</HEAD>

   The government Tuesday broadened a
probe into the deaths of aborigines in police custody to discover
why proportionately more of the native people than other
Australians end up in jail.
   The Royal Commission of Inquiry said it was concerned by
government statistics that show aborigines, about 1 percent of the
16 million population, are six times more likely to go to jail than
white Australians.
   ``While investigation of aboriginal deaths in custody is
important, so too is learning the lessons of the past and acting to
prevent further deaths,'' said Elliott Johnston, who is heading the
inquiry.
   Johnston, a lawyer, this week replaced judge James Muirhead on
the commission, which was established by Prime Minister Bob Hawke
in mid-1987.
   Muirhead, in an interim report issued in December, urged states
to abolish drunkenness as a criminal offense, indicating this was
perhaps a chief reason aborigines were arrested. In February, the
government pledged the equivalent of $8 million to set up
drying-out facilities as an alternative to jail for people arrested
on drinking charges.
   The commission is investigating the deaths while in police
custody of 104 aborigines between 1980 and May 31, 1987. Some
activists blame police brutality, and others have said the jailing
causes despair, which often leads to suicide, Johnston said.
   Conclusions will be reached by year's end, he said.
   In Adelaide, a spokeswoman for the South Australian Aboriginal
Deaths in Custody Watch Committee criticized the commission's May
31 cutoff date.
   ``The cut-off date must be when there are no more deaths so
justice can be seen to have happened,'' said Mrs. Alice Dixon,
whose 19-year-old aboriginal son died in custody in 1987.
   Aborigines are Australia's original inhabitants, settling the
continent 40,000 years ago.
