   Queen Elizabeth II presided Monday at
the opening of Australia's new Parliament House, which took nearly
$1 billion and eight years to build. About 2,000 aborigines
protested outside.
   The British queen called the building a crowning expression of
Australian faith in parliamentary democracy and noted that it
replaces a provisional Parliament building opened 61 years earlier
by her father, King George VI.
   Aboriginal activists and sympathizers began gathering at dawn to
protest the proceedings and their number grew to about 2,000 by the
time the queen arrived.
   Chants of ``Shame, shame, shame!'' and ``We want land rights
now!'' virtually drowned out the national anthem ``Advance
Australia Fair'' during welcoming ceremonies attended by Prime
Minister Bob Hawke and other dignitaries.
   Robyn Dass, an aboriginal activist, said the new building is on
a site sacred to the aborigines.
   Police said cables of the outdoor public address system were cut
before the queen arrived but were restored about 10 minutes into
the ceremony.
   The opening of Parliament House is a highlight of year-long
celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the European settlement of
Australia.
   At a final cost of $1.1 billion ($836 million U.S.), it also is
the nation's most expensive building. There is enough concrete in
it to build 25 replicas of Sydney's landmark Opera House.
   Opening it was Elizabeth's last official function of a
three-week tour that was her 11th visit to the country as queen.
   Huge crowds welcomed her and her husband, Prince Philip. The
aborigines turned their backs on the royal couple and sat down en
masse.
   During the queen's inspection of an honor guard, a 3-year-old
aboriginal girl left the crowd and thrust a bouquet of flowers into
her hands.
   She accepted the flowers, wrapped in aboriginal ribbons of
black, red and gold, but did not speak to the girl, Zena Wickes.
   In dedicating the bulding, the queen said: ``I rather doubt that
the founding fathers of the Australian federation could have
foreseen that their work would be crowned by such a confident
expression of Australia's faith in parliamentary democracy.''
   Hawke paid tribute to Australia's indigenous people in his
speech, noting that they had lived in the area for 21,000 years.
The aboriginal word ``canberra'' means meeting place.
   The new Parliament House has 4,500 rooms, public galleries
seating 1,000 people, kitchens capable of producing 8,000 meals a
day and parking space for more than 2,000 vehicles.
   The old building, half a mile away, is to become a museum.
