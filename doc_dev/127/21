dried on the Native Title act when problems started surfacing

Less than a year since Australia made a kind of peace with its indigenous
population, the question of Aboriginal rights threatens to become
politically contentious again.
In December last year, the federal parliament passed a law allowing
Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders to assert native title claims over
the country's large land mass. If claims were valid and land had since been
put to other uses, compensation would be paid. This was the first formal
acknowledgment - other than a 1992 High Court ruling - that the country was
inhabited before European settlement.
But, with the implementation of that package caught in a tussle between
federal and state authorities, the focus is turning to a ADollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 700m) land fund, designed to help those indigenous people who have
little chance of benefiting from the Native Title act itself.
In theory, the land fund is a good idea. The problem with last December's
law was that it required an indigenous community to demonstrate a 'close and
continuing' association with the land it was claiming. Many Aborigines,
however, have moved from their original homelands.
To some extent, this drift has been voluntary. But it has also been due in
part to the behaviour of white settlers. Aboriginal leaders estimate that no
more than 10 per cent of their people have any chance of benefiting directly
from the new law.
So, in the lengthy negotiations leading up to Native Title Act's passage,
they wrung a promise from the government that a fund would be set up to
acquire land on behalf of the remaining 90 per cent - a concession some saw
as of more practical significance than the main legislation. The government
published details earlier this year, and the necessary legislation is
working its way through parliament in Canberra.
The problem is that interested parties on all sides have reservations about
the scheme's design. Some Aboriginal representatives say the fund is too
small to be viable, and that the administrative framework is offensively
paternalistic.
Opposition politicians, by contrast, have argued the money could be better
spent on Aborginal health and housing. They have offered a raft of
amendments, saying they will only support the legislation if these are
accepted. It took the government only hours to reject this proposition.
But perhaps the most critical views, from a political standpoint, are those
of the minor parties who hold the balance of power in the senate,
parliament's upper house, through which any legislation must pass. Already,
the two Green party senators, who hail from Western Australia and hence have
an important Aboriginal constituency, have expressed serious concerns about
the fund's parameters.
'The question is whether this becomes yet another Native Title debate,' said
one official at the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Commission
(ATSIC), which represents Aboriginal interests. He was referring to the
mammoth parliamentary effort which was needed to ensure the original bill's
passage. 'The Greens are playing the same role - trying to extract more
(from the federal government),' he added.
The objectors have a point. The fund is less generous than it originally
appeared. The ADollars 1.5bn figure mentioned in the last budget is made up
of a ADollars 200m contribution from federal coffers in 1994/5, and ADollars
121m a year for the next nine years.
The bulk of this money, moreover, will be invested to ensure the fund is
self-sustaining after the first decade. Only ADollars 45m out of each annual
payment will go to acquire land, or to fund land management. Moreover, funds
ATSIC already devotes to this purpose from its own budget - ADollars 21m a
year - will be incorporated in the ADollars 45m figure.
ATSIC has taken the view that any increase is better than none, and that,
having done its best in negotiations, it will support the bill as it stands.
But it is not overjoyed. As David Ross, ATSIC commissioner, has put it: 'I
think the fund is adequate . . . I am certainly not saying that it is
over-generous.'
Other Aboriginal representatives are more critical. Mr Aden Ridgeway,
director of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, who represents the
interests of indigenous people in that state, has pointed out that the
annual funding works out at ADollars 5.5m per state or territory, and that
this low level will force the land fund to spread its money around
second-grade properties.
'You will not get really viable land when you do not have much money to
spend,' he warned. 'You will end up with land in the low rainfall area which
obviously will not be productive and viable.'
Equally thorny are the questions of how land purchases will be organised and
prioritised. The legislation is thin on operational details, but it does
provide for the formation of a new body, the Indigenous Land Corporation, to
handle purchases and management. After some compromise, the ILC's
prospective board has been extended to seven, and the chairperson plus at
least four other directors must be Aborigines or Torres Strait Islanders.
Even so, the fact that these appointments are to be made by a federal
minister and that the federal finance minister has ultimate power over the
land fund's investment touches a nerve. It smacks, in some eyes, of
condescension, even racism.
Moreover, in the first three years, the ADollars 45m will be divided between
ATSIC and the ILC, with the latter taking on full responsibility after this
interim period. Sorting out how these bodies weigh up the mass of
applications which will almost certainly be presented,and perform
complementary investment roles, is no easy task. As one ATSIC adminstrator
points out, it is not a question of maximising financial returns. Outback
land of spiritual significance, for example, might have to be weighed
against the desire of an urban group to build a local community centre.
There is a fair amount of goodwill surrounding the land fund discussions.
There is also considerable reluctance to repeat the trauma of the main
legislation. Nevertheless, as Australia found last year, the road to
reconciliation is long and bumpy.
