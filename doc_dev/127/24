Efforts to increase significantly the money available to a federally
constituted Aboriginal land fund were defeated yesterday in the Senate, the
Australian parliament's upper house. The fund is designed to acquire land on
behalf of the vast majority of Aborigines who will see no practical benefit
from the country's Native Title legislation, which was passed with much
difficulty last year. The Native Title act was the first piece of
legislation to acknowledge that Australia was inhabited before European
settlement.
At that stage the government promised to set up a land fund to make
acquisitions on behalf of dispossessed Aborigines. However, when details of
the scheme were released, critics said it was too small to be viable, and
poorly structured. Amendments put forward, but defeated in the Senate
yesterday, would have increased funds flowing into the land fund to ADollars
15bn (Pounds 7bn) over a 10-year period. The current government plan is for
just ADollars 1.4bn, over the same decade - with much of this money being
invested to ensure that the fund is self-sustaining in 10 years.
