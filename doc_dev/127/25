   An Australian aborigine at the center
of a manhunt that sparked a public uproar was arrested with a
hostage on the Queensland Gold Coast after a 10-day sweep across
three states, police said Thursday.
   John Porter, captured late Wednesday, was the key suspect in the
shooting and wounding of two Sydney policemen during an attempted
car theft on April 24.
   One of the policemen allegedly shot by Porter, 26-year-old Alan
McQueen, died Friday morning despite emergency surgery in which
doctors removed a lung, a kidney and most of his liver.
   The manhunt for Porter led to a dawn raid on a surburban Sydney
home last week in which an unarmed aborigine was fatally shot,
sparking an outcry among Australians over the rough treatment of
aborigines.
   Aboriginal activists responded to the killing of David Gundy by
putting posters up around the city calling for the murder of Ted
Pickering, police minister of New South Wales state.
   They also demanded a royal commission _ the highest form of
inquiry available _ into police conduct.
   Aborigines, who number about 160,000 or 1 per cent of the 16
million population, also are angered by the slow progress of a
government inquiry into more than 100 aboriginal deaths in police
custody since 1980.
   Police conduct during the manhunt for Porter captured front-page
headlines after authorities admitted that Queensland police faked
an arrest, watched it reported on the evening television news and
then told the media it was a hoax.
   Police said Thursday that Porter, 27, recently was released from
jail on parole and said he had six other criminal convictions on
drugs and assault charges.
   Police said Porter tried Wednesday to kidnap a woman, but she
escaped and alerted police.
   They said Porter, who was armed with a .32-calber pistol,
surrendered quietly when surrounded outside an apartment block on
the famed coastal strip of northeast Australia.
   Police said he apparently took a man hostage after driving north
from Sydney. The hostage was not injured.
   Porter was charged at the Brisbane Magistrate's court with
kidnapping, grievous bodily harm and use of an unlicensed firearm.
