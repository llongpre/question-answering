package satisfies most farmers, mining interests and Aborigines

PAUL Keating, the Australian prime minister, has not enjoyed too many
political successes in recent months. But yesterday he was finally able to
declare that the issue of Aborigine land rights, which has provoked a storm
of controversy in the mining and farming sectors, was a big step closer to
resolution.
A compromise package, which clears the way for legislation later this year,
was carved out in a long cabinet meeting on Monday night. As the details
became clearer during the day, cautious support from many of the interested
parties - including the mining and farming lobbies - began to emerge.
All this was the result of some hairy, last-minute bargaining. On Monday
afternoon, for example, Mr Keating told parliament that land which was held
under pastoral leases could be subject to native title claims - a statement
which reversed an earlier government commitment to farmers.
Yet by the time the cabinet meeting broke up in the small hours of Tuesday
morning, this concession to the Aborigine contingent had been dropped.
Instead, Aboriginal representatives agreed to an alternative proposal - that
they be allowed to convert their own pastoral leases into native title, thus
giving them permanent security on such land.
For the past 16 months, it has been touch-and-go whether the government
could broker a solution to a High Court decision which makes land rights
legislation imperative. This ruling was handed down in June 1992, when the
court determined that the Meriam people in the Torres Strait were holders of
native title on about nine square kilometres of land. The judgment became
known as the 'Mabo' decision, after Eddie Mabo, leader of the Meriam people
who had begun the court action a decade earlier.
The land involved in Mabo may have been modest, but the implications were
huge. Australian law had always operated on the assumption that the land was
unoccupied before European settlement - the principle of 'terra nullius'.
The High Court, by contrast, ruled that native title claims could be
successful where the indigenous people had maintained a close connection
with the land, although it also said that land titles acquired under
accepted law since European settlement should not be disturbed.
To complicate matters further, the Mabo decision determined that states and
territories could extinguish native title - but only in accordance with the
country's constitution and laws, notably the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act.
In short, compensation could be required.
Unfortunately, the High Court ruling was made in the narrow context of one
claim, and gave little guidance on the practical application of these
principles. From the outset, the federal government was forced to tread a
fine line between meeting Aboriginal demands, now backed up by the Mabo
ruling, and delivering a degree of reassurance to existing land users, such
as the mining companies and farmers, so that economic stability was not
threatened. To make the task harder, it also had to juggle a delicate
relationship with Australia's states and territories, traditionally
responsible for land management.
The final package, as agreed by the cabinet this week, is complex.
Essentially, it will allow indigenous people to pursue claims for native
title either through the federal court or through state jurisdiction.
Decisions on the economic use of land, however, will remain the domain of
the states, provided they comply with the 'spirit and principles' of the
Commonwealth legislation.
All existing leases can be 'validated', and native title will then be
extinguished for all categories other than mining leases. Governments will
pick up any compensation costs resulting from validation of existing grants
and 'there will be further discussions with states and territories on
cost-sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and complying states'.
Where land is subject to native title, the indigenous holders will not have
a veto on development, but they will have a 'right to negotiation'. Mr
Keating's statement suggested that the time limits for negotiation would be
set at four months in the case of exploration licences, and six months for
mining leases. There would also be four- and six-month arbitration periods
for the two respective categories.
Will the package fly? On the political front, the Australian Democrats, one
of the two minority parties whose parliamentary support is essential,
welcomed the package. State premiers in New South Wales and South Australia
and the chief minister in the Northern Territory reserved judgment, but
Queensland and Victoria came out in support.
National Federation of Farmers supported the deal. Even the Australian
Mining Industry Council, an umbrella group for the large mining companies,
gave lukewarm endorsement. It noted that the package would at least provide
certainty by validating existing leases. But the AMIC still quarrelled with
the lack of parity between mining and pastoral leases; claimed that native
title claimants' right to choose between federal and state jurisdictions
would prove unwieldy; and maintained that all states would need to be
supportive for the package to work.
This may be the sticking point. Western Australia - a key natural resources
state - has taken the hardest line against the federal proposals to date.
Yesterday, Mr Richard Court, the Liberal premier, said the legislation could
lead to long court battles, and pointed out that up to 40 per cent of the
state may be subject to native title claim. He is due to hold talks with Mr
Keating's legal advisers in Melbourne today.
The Aborigines' response, meanwhile, was mixed. Although Aboriginal
representatives were closely involved in the final negotiations, more
radical elements within the indigenous community were far from impressed.
'It's the coming of the second invasion,' said Mr Bob Weatherall, a
Brisbane-based activist and chairman of the Aboriginal Provisional
Government.
It was up to Aboriginal people to prove that native title existed rather
than the other way round, he commented. 'The High Court made it plain that
it was wrong for governments and commercial groups to collude in taking away
Aboriginal land interests in the past without accounting to Aboriginal
people. It must be equally wrong for the federal parliament, and the states
and territories, in 1993 to repeat the dose by 'validating'.'
