THE Australian government yesterday announced plans to spend ADollars 150m
(Pounds 66m) over five years to try to improve living conditions for the
country's Aboriginal minority, and combat discrimination by white
Australians.
The spending forms the first government response to the report of a Royal
Commission into the deaths of 99 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders in
police custody. The Commission found that the prisoners, most of whom
committed suicide, were victims of 'entrenched and institutionalised racism
and discrimination'.
Mr Robert Tickner, Aboriginal affairs minister, said their deaths were 'the
tragic consequence of two centuries of dispossession, dispersal and
appalling disadvantage'.
