AUSTRALIA, one of the strongest supporters of sanctions against apartheid in
South Africa, is embroiled in a debate over the extent of institutionalised
racism against its Aboriginal minority, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney.
Race relations have rarely been smooth since the first white settlers
arrived in Sydney 204 years ago. But two incidents in recent weeks suggest
that official prejudice against blacks remains widespread.
The most striking was an amateur video broadcast on ABC television which
showed policemen at a charity function cavorting for the camera with blacked
faces and nooses around their necks.
The officers identified themselves as David Gundy and Lloyd Boney, both
Aborigines who died in police custody. Mr Gundy was shot dead in Sydney in
1989; Mr Boney hanged himself in a police cell in 1987.
The screening of the video followed a documentary in which police in the
Sydney suburb of Redfern were filmed harassing Aborigines, some of whom were
arrested for using 'offensive' language which also formed a prominent part
of the police vocabulary.
Both incidents have been condemned by political leaders of all parties. Mr
Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the video was 'a national disgrace'.
He urged Australians to 'expunge racism from every corner of this country'.
The officers, who belong to the New South Wales (NSW) state police, have
been placed on restricted duties, and are being investigated by the force's
internal affairs department. A separate inquiry is taking place into the
events in Redfern.
Aborigines reacted to the video with outrage. Mr Paul Coe, chairman of the
Aboriginal Legal Service in Redfern said the video was indicative of racism
'in all institutions throughout the states and the Commonwealth (federal
government) of Australia.' Ms Irene Moss, the federal Race Discriminations
Commissioner, said the 'outrageous' behaviour exposed in the broadcasts
reflected 'widespread involvement of police in acts of racist violence,
intimidation and harassment of Aboriginal people'.
Police officers appeared to be less concerned. Mr Tony Day, president of the
NSW Police Association, said it was a disgrace the video had been
sensationalised.
