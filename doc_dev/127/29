  [Text] Sydney, Dec 11 (AFP) -- Britain has closed the door 
on a controversial part of its relationship with Australia by 
agreeing to pay a 45 million dollar [Australian dollars] (30 
million U.S.) settlement over sites it once used for nuclear 
tests, Aboriginal Affairs Minister Robert Tickner said Saturday. 
  The ex-gratia payment ends a long-running dispute over the 
clean-up of British test sites at Maralinga, Monte Bello Islands 
and Emu Field in the southern Australian outback. 
  Australia has long argued that it was Britain's 
responsibility to clean up the nuclear contamination which it 
claims still affects the lives of local Aborigines. 
  "The British decision is welcomed, it will allow Britain and 
Australia to put behind us one of the saddest aspects of our 
relationship," Tickner told AFP from Canberra. 
  "It is almost impossible to conceive now that atomic weapons 
were actually tested in Australia, they will leave a legacy of 
contamination for many thousands of years to come." 
  The indigenous Aborigine population was driven off its 
traditional lands to make way for the British nuclear tests and 
returned in the 1980s only to learn the area had been exposed to 
high levels of toxic contamination. 
  "As a result of the testing, Aboriginal people lost the use 
of their traditional lands, but the compensation will allow a 
clean-up and fencing where appropriate and will allow us to have 
a much more mature relationship between Britain and Australia," 
Tickner said. 
  The Aborigines filed a formal complaint to Britain in 1991, 
leading Australia to press Britain to share rehabilitation and 
compensation costs of the Maralinga nuclear testing range, 
abandoned by Britain in 1967. 
  The settlement, to be paid to Australia in installments over 
the next six years, removed a "major irritant" to the 
relationship between Australia and Britain, British Foreign 
Office Minister Alastair Goodlad said in London Friday. 
  Australia had agreed in turn to abandon all further claims, 
he said. 
  Australian Primary Industries and Energy Minister Simon 
Crean 
and Foreign Affairs Minister Gareth Evans said in a joint 
statement from Canberra that resolution of the issue had 
vindicated Australia's stance about the condition of the sites 
left by Britain. 
  "Australia has never accepted Britain's denial of legal or 
moral responsibility for this issue," the ministers said. The 
condition of the sites left by Britain "was unacceptable even by 
the standards that then applied." 
  A study by Australian, British and U.S. scientists, 
completed 
in 1990, traced the full extent of plutonium on Aborginial land 
and found that the Aborgines' outdoor lifestyle made them highly 
vulnerable to the threat of plutonium, a carcinogen.
