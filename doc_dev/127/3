   To stem a rash of aborigine deaths in
police custody, a government report today urged that drunkenness be
abolished as an offense and racist police officers be replaced by
aboriginal recruits.
   The preliminary report calls for widespread changes in
Australia's legal, police, prison and medical systems to tackle the
problem and warns that a failure to institute such changes would
damage Australia's reputation abroad.
   It was issued by James Muirhead, a lawyer who Prime Minister Bob
Hawke appointed last year as head of a royal commission formed to
investigate the deaths of 44 aborigines in police custody since 1980.
   The commission was to have concluded its probe this week, but the
number of aborigine deaths in police custody has more than doubled
to 100 since it began work. Most aborigines have died in police
cells by hanging after being picked up on charges of being drunk and
disorderly.
   Aboriginal activists charge police brutality.
   Muirhead said the increase in his workload means the final report
will be delayed by two years. In the meantime, he issued 56
recommendations to prevent more aborigines from dying in custody.
   In the report, Muirhead also criticizes attempts that have been
made to hamper his investigation.
   ``It will be unfortunate if the work of this commission is
impeded by narrow, selfish or political considerations,'' he says.
``Our performance is being assessed not only in this country but in
overseas forums and I fear that our country's reputation will suffer
if expediency rather than honesty prevails.
   ``Australia must know the truth behind the deaths or else we must
forever live with the knowledge that our fear of the truth or our
misguided sense of priorities caused us to abandon an essential and
momentous decision to examine a little of our national character and
the behavior of people in authority.'' In Western Australia, the
state where there the most deaths have occurred, police and prison
officers' unions, backed by the state government, have launched a
federal court challenge to some of the commission's powers.
   A royal commission has wider powers than any judicial body in the
country, but is not empowered to pass legal judgment. Its findings,
however, can result in legal action at the state and federal level.
   Aborigines, the country's original inhabitants, number about
160,000, or 1 percent of Australia's 16 million people.
   The inquiry comes at a particularly sensitive time with ongoing
bicentennial celebrations marking European settlement. Aboriginal
activitists have declared 1988 a year of mourning.
   Muirhead, says in his report that governments at the state and
federal level should legislate to ensure that jail is used only as a
last resort for drunkenness.
   Justice Minister Michael Tate said the federal government
generally agrees with the thrust of the report.
   Muirhead refused comment beyond his recommendations, which
included:
   _ That drunkenness be abolished as an offense, accompanied by
programs to treat alcohol abuse and changes to the law to force
police to consider alternatives to jail for drunk people; that a
national task force be set up to examine social and health problems
among aborigines caused by alcohol abuse;
   _ That people found unconscious by police should be taken to a
hospital or a qualified health worker and not to jail. He encouraged
the recruitment of aboriginal police and prison officers, and
screening to prevent racist police and prison officers from being
retained.
   Federal statistics show that aboriginal life expectancy is 20
years less than for other Australians, while infant mortality among
aborigines is almost three times higher than among non-aborigines.
   Aborigines, according to government figures, also have a far
higher rate of diseases like trachoma while imprisonment rates for
aborigines are 16 times higher than the national average.
   Aboriginal unemployment is some six times the national average.
There are virtually no aborigines in professions such as law,
education and medicine despite millions of dollars each year in
federal funds for aborigines.
