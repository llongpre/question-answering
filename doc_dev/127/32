   CANBERRA, Australia -- The Australian government, bowing
to aboriginal wishes, will not allow mining at Coronation
Hill -- a move the industry says may jeopardize investment in
the country.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke said his cabinet decided that the
fact that the site is sacred to the Jawoyn aborigines
outweighed the economic benefit of mining gold, platinum and
palladium there.

   The Australian Mining Industry Council said the decision
will hurt investors' confidence in Australia.
   "Australia is proving to have the added risk of government
interference on top of the . . . risk of exploration," said
Murray McMillan, assistant director of the council. "People
will feel less sure about investing in Australia and will
take their funds abroad, where the sovereign risk is less."
   Prime Minister Hawke countered the criticism, saying the
Coronation Hill decision has "no implications for proposals
to mine elsewhere," and that the site "represents a special
set of circumstances not existing elsewhere in Australia."
   Political commentators see the ruling as a victory for Mr.
Hawke, who two weeks ago survived a leadership challenge from
former Treasurer Paul Keating.
   There had been rumors in Canberra and in financial markets
that Mr. Hawke would step down as leader if the cabinet gave
the go-ahead to the mine. John Kerin, Australia's new
treasurer, favored mining the site.
   Coronation Hill is in a conservation zone of Kakadu
National Park, in the Northern Territory. The government now
will incorporate the conservation zone into the national
park.
   The aboriginal custodians of the area are against mining
Coronation Hill on religious grounds. They fear the spirit
Bula, which they believe resides in the hill, will bring
sickness and destruction if it is disturbed. Newcrest Mining
Ltd. and Plutonic Resources Ltd. each have 45% interests in
the Coronation Hill deposit. North Broken Hill Peko Ltd. has
a 10% stake. Newmont Mining Corp. of the U.S. owns 14% of
Newcrest; Broken Hill Proprietary Co. owns another 23% of
Newcrest; and Poseidon Gold Ltd. has an 11.5% stake. The
biggest shareholder in Plutonic Resources Ltd. is Malaysian
government-controlled Malaysia Mining Corp.
   Coronation Hill was registered as a sacred site in October
1985, a few months after the mining consortium disclosed that
it had struck gold. The consortium said the deposit contains
at least 1.2 million ounces of gold and enough platinum and
palladium to make it the biggest source of the latter two
minerals in Australia. It estimated the mine's life at nine
years and said it might last 20 years.
   A government inquiry into the proposed mine calculated the
net current value of production to the Australian economy at
about 82 million Australian dollars (US$62.5 million), while
the consortium argued that if indirect benefits are taken
into account, that figure rises to A$200 million.
   Newcrest managing director John Quinn called the decision
"a low-water mark in the government's attitude towards
investment and economic recovery in Australia."
   Robert Tickner, minister for aboriginal affairs, said that
aboriginal people generally, and the Jawoyn people in
particular, aren't opposed to mining.
   Indeed, he said the Jawoyn people have signed an agreement
with Normandy Poseidon Ltd., an Australian mining company, to
explore for diamonds, gold and base metals over 1,000 square
miles of land adjacent to Coronation Hill, but not on the
sacred site.
