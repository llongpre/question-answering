THE AUSTRALIAN federal government has removed one of the major barriers to
the ADollars 500m (USDollars 375m) iron ore project of the CRA subsidiary,
Hamersley Iron, at Marandoo, in Western Australia.
The government has rejected an application by the Karinji aboriginal tribe
to block the project under the federal Aboriginal Heritage Protection Act.
Mr Robert Tickner, the federal minister for aboriginal affairs, said he was
not satisfied that the mining project was a serious threat to aboriginal
heritage, as required by the Act.
Hamersley Iron will now have to pass the state environmental regulations of
Western Australia before the project can finally proceed. A company official
yesterday said the decision was due in 20 weeks and that he was optimistic
that the project would get the state government's approval.
Mr Tickner's decision is the latest in a series of recent moves that seem to
indicate the government's desire to offset the negative effects of its
blocking of the Coronation Hill gold and platinum mine in June last year.
Late last year Mr Tickner declined to use the Aboriginal Heritage Act to
block Dominion Mining's ADollars 350m nickel project at Yakabindie, also in
Western Australia. However, the project is still delayed by an appeal
against the state government's approval lodged by aboriginal groups with the
Western Australian Supreme Court.
The Coronation Hill ban had reduced industry confidence in Australian mining
investments, with local companies threatening to shift substantial
exploration budgets overseas.
Last week, the Coronation Hill joint venturers, led by New Crest Mining,
filed a High Court action challenging the validity of the government plan.
