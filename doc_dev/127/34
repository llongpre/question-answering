   About 300 aborigines marched through
downtown Sydney on Saturday to protest the deaths of aborigines in
custody.
   Warren Martens, spokesman for the Committee to Defend Black
Rights, said the march commemorated the death of aborigine John
Pat, who died in police custody five years ago.
   ``And it's also for all the others,'' Martens said, referring to
more than 100 aboriginal deaths in police cells and prisons over
the past decade.
   The deaths are being studied by the government-funded Muirhead
Royal Commission, headed by Justice James Muirhead.
   ``The royal commission is underfunded and the deaths are still
happening,'' Martens said.
   The demonstrators shouted: ``Black deaths, white hands, stop the
killings now!''
