THE GOVERNMENT of Australia yesterday moved to protect MIM Group's ADollars
300m (USDollars 210m) lead and zinc mine in the Northern Territory from
possible Aboriginal land claims.
The move came amid fears in Australia of an avalanche of land claims after a
high court decision recognising the existence of land titles before the
Europeans came in 1788.
The Northern Territory government has filed a bill to override native titles
that might be presented against MIM's titles covering its leases for the
McArthur River project. The bill, backed by Canberra, was filed after
Aboriginal groups in the area threatened to lay claims on the land unless
given infrastructure and compensation packages. The MIM leases reputedly
hold one of the world's largest reserves of lead, zinc and silver.
