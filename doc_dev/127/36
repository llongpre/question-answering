   Aboriginal leaders in Melbourne
boycotted Nelson Mandela's visit to the city today, saying the
black South African leader should voice more support for their
cause.
   The African National Congress leader, on the third day of a
four-day visit to Australia, attended a fund-raising rally today
and met with state and federal government officials.
   Marjorie Thorpe, chairperson of the Aborigines Advancement
League, said aborigines felt that Mandela could have given their
cause a boost.
   ``We would have liked him to make some statement about
aborigines in this country,'' she said. ``But he has really
disappointed a lot of people in this city.''
   Mandela said earlier he would prefer not to comment on the
plight of Australia's aborigines, or native people, because he did
not want to interfere in another country's internal affairs.
   There were several reports that Mandela may use a planned rest
day in Sydney on Friday to visit with several aboriginal leaders,
but ANC officials would not comment.
   Australia is the fourth stop of a six-nation tour by Mandela,
72. The trip has already taken him to India, Brunei and Indonesia,
and he will travel to Japan and Malaysia before returning home.
