   Archaeologists on Friday reported
finding a huge Stone Age ``factory'' in the Outback where aborigines
crafted stone blades and cutting tools for barter some 2,000 years
ago.
   Scattered among weathered stone outcrops were hundreds of
thousands of remains of stone tools and implements that point to a
sophisticated aboriginal enterprise long before Europeans set foot
on the continent.
   The site at Tiboobura, 530 miles northwest of Sydney, is so large
that archaeologists believe its output may have formed the basis for
a local export industry.
   ``Almost certainly, these people operated the workshop to
exchange goods,'' said Dan Witter, archaeologist for the
government's National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales.
   He said Tiboobura is an aboriginal word, meaning pile of rocks, a
reference to granite hills in the area. The cutting tools were made
from a silica-based rock.
   Witter told The Associated Press the Stone Age toolmakers most
likely traded for a mildly hallucinogenic drug, Pituri. The
Australian newspaper, in a report on the quarry, said Pituri was
used by nomadic aborigines to counteract hunger pains during the
long treks between hunting grounds.
   The find follows the recent discovery of a fragment of human bone
in central Australia that has been dated at 60,000 years old,
pushing back the date of human occupation of Australia by 20,000
years.
   Indigenous aborigines number about 160,000, almost one percent of
Australia's 16.5 million population.
   Witter, of Cody, Wyo., said the site consisted of fragments of
stone artifacts. No stone implements were found, but the discards
indicate blades up to 12 inches long that have only been found
hundreds of miles away in northern Queensland and the Northern
Territory.
   ``Because the site is so big, it appears aboriginal toolmakers
produced implements mainly for trade and export to other areas of
Australia,'' Witter said.
   Tiboobura is a parched area bordered by three states _ New South
Wales, Queensland and South Australia.
   The remains suggest the inhabitants crafted spear heads and
knives not only to hunt wildlife such as kangaroos, lizards and
dingoes, a native Australian wild dog, but as a form of industry.
   ``It takes a great deal of skill to make these things,'' Witter
said. ``We have only really scratched the surface of the material
that is lying around. There is clearly a great deal more under the
ground and that material may prove to be even more important.''
   Stone Age tool factories exist elsewhere, but Witter said the
Tiboobura site was significant because it is the first one found
where tools were made but not used locally.
   ``There's no other site like this,'' he said.
   Paul Jennings, local ranger for the National Parks and Wildlife
Service, said the tools were designed for lightness and versatility
because nomadic aborigines had to minimise the equipment they
carried.
