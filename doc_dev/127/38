Mr Malcolm Douglas wants to build a crocodile farm in Broome, 2,000km north
of Perth. He already operates a crocodile park in the remote coastal town,
but said it had become overcrowded to the point where the crocodiles were
maiming each other. The business as it stands is too small to be viable. If
the new project were to go ahead, about 20 jobs, in an area with limited
employment prospects, could be created.
The problem for Mr Douglas is that the local Yawuru Aboriginal people
believe the proposed 21-hectare plot lies on land of spiritual significance,
and that the development could interfere with their ceremonial rites. So
under legislation that came into force on January 1, they have lodged a
claim with Australia's Native Title Tribunal, a new federal organisation to
arbitrate on indigenous peoples' land rights.
It is one of the first demands to be submitted to the tribunal. The process
will be complex. First, the veracity of the tribe's anthropological history
must be established. Next, the claim must be registered and advertised in
local papers. Finally, hearings to determine the claim's merits may take
place.
Meanwhile, Mr Robert Tickner, federal minister for Aboriginal affairs, has
ordered a 30-day halt to work on the site. 'At last it has been recognised
that our cultural heritage is threatened,' said Mr Francis Djaigween, a
Yawuru elder.
Elsewhere, other cases are beginning to be brought under Australia's native
title legislation, which was passed by parliament just before Christmas. The
first claim - from the Wiradjuri people over land in New South Wales -
passed the anthropological test yesterday.
Today debate over the degree to which the act impinges on state rights is
expected to dominate a meeting in Hobart, Tasmania, between the prime
minister, Mr Paul Keating, and Australia's state premiers.
The law stems from a 1992 High Court ruling that said, for the first time,
native title rights could exist in Australia if the indigenous inhabitants
had maintained a 'close and continuing' association with a piece of land.
With that single ruling, the doctrine of terra nullius - the notion that
Australia was unoccupied prior to European settlement  - was overturned.
Until then, Australia had been the only former British colony not to
recognise land ownership by the indigenous peoples - lagging Canada by 200
years and New Zealand by a century and a half.
The High Court ruling, however, was a mixed blessing for Australia's 265,000
Aborigines, who account for 1.6 per cent of the population. While
acknowledging native title rights, the court also declared that existing
leasehold or freehold titles, which had been granted lawfully, should not be
disturbed.
Faced with squaring these two seemingly conflicting requirements, the
government drew up the Native Title Bill. This set out a system for
'validating' most existing land titles and formally cancelling competing
native title rights. Compensation for genuine Aboriginal claims would be
paid by either the state or federal government.
The law also made an exception of mining leases. For these, it said, native
titles could coexist with an existing lease and 'revive' when that lease
expired.
When the Native Title Act was passed on December 21, Mr Keating said it
offered 'a modicum of justice to indigenous Australians'. He added: 'Today,
we move closer to a united Australia which respects this land of ours.'
But as the legislation comes into operation and claims, such as that from
the Yawuru people, start to arrive at the tribunal, the effects are proving
more complicated. The legislation was a political compromise between
conflicting interest groups and, like most compromise deals, it extracted a
price all round.
Those affected fall into four broad groups. The first comprises the
Aborigines and the indigenous inhabitants of the Torres Strait islands.
Widely dispersed across Australia's vast land mass, they entered the native
title debate with disparate views. For some, the act is a failure because it
eliminates native title rights on large tranches of Australia which had been
theirs.
Others have been more pragmatic, arguing that any chance to claw back some
rights should be seized. 'The land was ours and taken away from us,' said Mr
Peter Costello, a Cape York elder, during the negotiations in Canberra. 'The
European people are going to lead this country, and I won't be coming here
again. But we never said that we were going to take everything . . . We just
want some vacant crown land.'
This may be a realistic assessment of what Aborigines can hope to achieve.
Over the past 200 years, many have moved - or been moved - off their
forebears' land, so the 'close and continuing' land association requirement
will not be readily met. More than a quarter of the Aboriginal population
lives in Australia's eight state/territory capitals.
Using such residence patterns, Aboriginal leaders estimate that only about
10 per cent of their peoples stand a realistic chance of benefiting directly
from the native title legislation.
Because land association is most likely to have been broken when freehold or
leasehold title has been granted to white settlers, the best chances of a
successful claim will be against unused land owned by the nation. Most of
this lies in west Australia. Here a bruising battle between the state and
federal governments is under way, casting a cloud of uncertainty over the
short-term progress of any claims.
While Mr Keating's Labor government was battling to get its land rights
legislation passed in Canberra, the conservative Western Australian
government enacted different native title legislation in Perth. That removed
native title rights altogether, replacing them with much weaker 'rights to
traditional usage' of the land (for ceremonial purposes, for instance).
The Western Australia legislation is already under assault. Aboriginal
groups have mounted a legal challenge, claiming that it breaches federal
racial discrimination legislation.
Mr Keating has suggested that only those states and territories that support
the federal act will get federal help with compensation payments. Mr Richard
Court, premier of Western Australia, said that amounted to 'blackmail'. He
has some backing from other states and territories, which have yet to
introduce their own legislation on the subject.
Even if the federal regime eventually prevails - as seems likely -
short-term confusion is inevitable, further complicating procedures for
processing Aboriginal claims. No sooner had Mr Tickner issued his order over
Broome's proposed crocodile farm, for example, than the Western Australian
authorities announced they would challenge it.
As for the 90 per cent of Aborigines who may gain little directly from the
legislation, the Native Title Act promises a new land fund to assist
Aboriginal land purchases and management 'in a way that provides economic,
environmental, social or cultural benefits'. The fund will form part of a
broader 'social justice' package designed to address the disadvantages faced
by the Aboriginal population.
For many Aborigines, this is every bit as important as the act itself. But
they will have to wait for the details: Canberra has yet to set a budget for
the fund and has said the package would not be finalised until 1995.
The second group affected by the legislation is the mining industry, which
believes it has lost heavily under the new law. It complains that the costs
of doing business in Australia will go up, forcing many companies to look
abroad for new projects.
To some extent, however, the complaints of the mining industry are
exaggerated. Existing leases are 'validated' by the new act, and if a lease
granted before 1994 contained a specific right to renew, that too is
enforceable.
But future exploration, say the mining companies, is another matter. The
Australian Mining Industry Council estimated that the new tribunal might
delay the development of a project by up to two years, and said its members
were already reassessing their exploration plans.
'Title problems are getting worse,' said Mr Hugh Morgan, head of Western
Mining and one of the Native Title Act's most outspoken critics. 'Most
exploration programmes are studying their navels at present for 1994-95.
They (the implications of the Act) are only slowly permeating down.'
The AMIC points to a report by the Centre of International Economics on the
impact of an Aboriginal land rights law that operated in the Northern
Territory since 1976, and the degree to which it has restricted mining
activity. The report estimates that the law has cost the Northern Territory
about ADollars 2.39bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in income over the period.
Defenders of the federal act, however, point out that Northern Territory law
differs significantly from the new legislation - giving Aborigines a right
of veto over mining exploration, for example. At the same time, they say,
the CIE study used figures based on numbers of exploration licences. That
gives a distorted picture, because exploration on Aboriginal land tends be
large scale. Four-fifths of the minerals produced in the Northern Territory
come from Aboriginal land, according to the Central Land Council, which
represents local Aboriginal landholders and claimants.
Nevertheless, the need to resolve native title issues will inevitably add
something to a mining company's costs. How much, and the extent to which it
makes offshore alternatives more attractive, will depend on a variety of
factors - ranging from the efficiency of the Native Title Tribunal and the
attitude of individual Aboriginal groups to external factors such as
Australia's exchange rate.
The mining industry admits that it will take time for the impact of the new
law to be felt. 'In fact, the exploration dollar spent over the next couple
of years will probably go up,' said Mr Geoffrey Ewing, assistant director of
the AMIC, pointing to the long-term nature of the mining business. But
eventually, he warned, 'it's just one of those things which will tip the
balance for some companies'.
Other land-based industries, ranging from Australia's farming community to
the large tourism sector, are the third group affected by the act. In
general, thanks to deft lobbying by the National Farmers Federation, these
are relatively well protected under the legislation because land titles will
be validated.
Any new businesses, however, and those looking to expand or relocate will in
future have to bear in mind the possibility of an Aboriginal challenge - as
the Malcolm Douglas case demonstrates.
The fourth principal effect of the new legislation is on Australian
identity. Most sea-hugging, city-dwelling Australians learn about the
problems of the Aboriginal population second-hand, but their reaction to the
legislation nonetheless has been mostly favourable. As Mr Keating said, no
one's home would be seized, taxes had not risen, jobs were not affected. For
little obvious cost, Australians had gained a sense of having righted old
wrongs.
Whether this mood would persist if an economic price became apparent is more
debatable. There have been suggestions that the costs of the native title
legislation, plus the accompanying Aboriginal social justice package, could
lead to a tax rise at a later date. But even if federal finances taxes do
increase, Australia's long-term unemployment problem is more likely to be
blamed than the Aborigines.
All along, realpolitik has been at the centre of the Australian native title
debate. The country has tried to find a method of melding its original
culture, with its spiritual values and its belief that land is integral to a
way of life, with a more commercial, western approach. While the solution
may lack elegance, Australia is at least offering something to its
indigenous peoples - albeit 200 years too late.
As one Perth-based judge, commenting on the Yawuru case, remarked: 'On one
view, this is a classic clash between God and mammon. The economic interests
of a commercial enterprise are set against the spiritual and cultural life
of a section of the community.
'Of course,' he continued, 'it is not that simple. Both sets of interests
are entirely legitimate.'
