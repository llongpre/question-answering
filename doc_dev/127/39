MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, yesterday delivered a blow
to the nation's farmers when he hinted that proposed native land rights
legislation would allow claims against land held under pastoral leases.
The government had previously indicated that only mining leases would fail
to extinguish native title, which, in turn, could 'co-exist' with the mining
lease and revive once the latter expired.
During parliamentary question time yesterday, Mr Keating said he expected
only about 11 pastoral leases issued between the implementation of the 1975
Racial Discrimination Act and 1993 to be affected by the government's
legislation.
But he said native title claimants could make claims under common law on all
of the thousands of pastoral leases issued before 1975.
The government has been battling to draw up a system for deciding Aborigine
land claims, in the wake of a High Court decision last year. This ruling,
known as the 'Mabo' decision, threw out the notion that Australia was
essentially unoccupied before European settlement, and suggested the
Aborigine claims could be valid where there had been close and continuing
association with the land in question.
The National Farmers' Federation campaigned strongly for a ban on native
title rights on all pastoral leases. Aboriginal groups, by contrast, argued
that pastoral leases should be among the leases which did not extinguish
native title rights.
Mr Keating said yesterday the legislation would allow states to validate all
pastoral leases without the lessees having to disprove the existence of
residual native title. Holders of pastoral leases on land covered by native
title would have primacy, with no question of co-ownership.
'The only question then at issue is whether in validating these leases, we
should go so far as to extinguish native title completely and forever, or
whether we should leave the relationship between lease rights and native
title to the common law,' he said.
Under the envisaged legislation, native title claimants would still be able
to claim residual rights through claims in the courts.
Mr Keating added he believed such cases had little chance. The Australian
cabinet was meeting to discuss the draft 'Mabo' legislation yesterday, and
there have been suggestions it could be presented to parliament in a matter
of weeks.
