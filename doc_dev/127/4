   A leading aboriginal artist and four
members of his family were shot and killed at their camp in a
remote reservation, police said Wednesday.
   Police in the aboriginal area of Arnhem Land in the Northern
Territory said the bodies of tribal elder Dick Ngueli Ngueli, also
known as Muru Muru, and his wife, daughter and two young grandsons
were found Tuesday.
   Police said relatives found the five victims lying face down in
a creek at a remote camp in Arnhem Land, 180 miles east of Darwin.
   Police said a sixth victim, apparently Ngueli's brother, was
also found dead, but gave no details.
   Superintendant Terry O'Brien of the Darwin police said the five
family members were killed with a shotgun and that used cartridges
were found near the bodies.
   Police said they plan to question tribal aborigines in the area
and were searching for Ngueli's son-in-law, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
   Ngueli, about 60 years old and a member of the Namok tribe, is
an internationally acclaimed bark painter whose works are on
display at the National Gallery in Canberra, the federal capital.
   The slayings followed media reports that aboriginal elders in
Arnhem Land had started ``singing to death'' _ a ritual death curse
_ another aboriginal artist for presenting a bark painting
depicting legends of creation to Prime Minister Bob Hawke.
   The reports said Galarrwuy Yunupingu, chairman of the Northern
Territory Land Council, was condemned in June for revealing secret
tribal lore to a white man.
   Police did not link the two incidents.
   Rituals practiced by aborigines, while seldom reported, are
still common in Australia.
   During a re-enactment Jan. 26 of the arrival of the first fleet
of ships that bought convict settlers to Australia, aborigines
stood on the foreshore of Sydney Harbor pointing sharpened bones _
a symbol of imminent death _ at the incoming ships.
   Aborigines, Australia's first settlers, number about 160,000, or
1 percent of the country's 16 million population. They are believed
to have arrived at least 40,000 years ago.
