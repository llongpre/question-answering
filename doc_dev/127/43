   Political disorders, ethnic tensions,
poverty and international disputes are churning up the South Seas
in an arc curving sharply northward from New Zealand and back down
to Australia.
   Vanuatu, New Caledonia, Fiji, Tahiti, Papua New Guinea, Tonga,
Western Samoa, even New Zealand and Australia themselves, have had
a taste of trouble in the past year.
   Most recently it was rioting in Vanuatu over land claims, and in
the French territory of New Caledonia 19 native Kanaks were killed
in a shootout with French troops in ethnic and political disorders.
   Fiji has seen two coups in the past year, and the former British
island remains unstable in the aftermath.
   Australia is concerned about what it sees as the speading
influence of Libya's Col. Moammar Gadhafi in the area and the
inroads made by the Soviet Union in what long has been seen as an
``American lake.''
   A commentator in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper said the
image of a South Seas paradise may have been permanently tarnished.
   The past year also has seen riots in Tahiti and political
upheaval in Papua New Guinea over the alleged corruption of Cabinet
ministers.
   New Zealand faces racial unrest as indigenous Maoris press the
Labor Party government of Prime Minister David Lange with a battery
of land and fisheries claims.
   In Australia, aborigines are using this year's bicentennial
celebrations to highlight grievances they say grew out of European
settlement 200 years ago.
   In early May, bloody violence erupted over territorial and
French presidential elections in New Caledonia, culminating in the
rescue of French hostages held in caves by Melanesian separatists;
21 people were killed.
   On May 16, a drunken mob ran riot through Vanuatu's capital,
Port Vila, looting shops and smashing office windows. One man died,
nine others were injured and police arrested 30 people in the
rioting over land claims.
   Australia and New Zealand responded to the crisis by airlifting
riot-control gear to Vanuatu at Prime Minister Walter Lini's
request.
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke of Australia linked Libya to the
rioting and said Australia could not stand by as a friendly
country's government is undermined by what he called a
non-democratic process.
   ``There is no doubt about a Libyan connection in Vanuatu,''
Hawke said. ``In a city with a population of less than 20,000 it is
clear that these disturbances have been on a very serious scale.''
   Vanuatu, formerly the British-French New Hebrides, shocked the
generally pro-Western South Pacific with its decision in 1986 to
establish diplomatic relations with Libya and the Soviet Union.
   Since then, the Soviet Union has sought fishing agreements with
Papua New Guinea and impoverished Kiribati, creating concern in
Australia as well as Washington about Soviet inroads in the region.
   More recently, the Soviet Union has approached Australia for
fishing access to Australian ports for refueling purposes and to
Australian airports for fishing crews in transit. Hawke said he
would treat the request with caution.
   Elsewhere in the South Pacific, such nations as Tonga and
Western Samoa face poverty, overcrowding and unemployment. Many of
the islanders have migrated to Australia and New Zealand in search
of jobs.
   ``All these are turning the once tranquil South Pacific into an
increasingly complex set of real and potential troublespots,'' the
Sydney Morning Herald said.
   The Sydney Daily Telegraph echoed that concern, calling the
situation a powderkeg.
   ``The multiple problems of these islands has led to a rising
discontent,'' the Telegraph said. ``Moscow has been making big
efforts to gain a stronger foothold in every island group through
fishery deals and aid.''
   Racial and ethnic divisions remain a major underlying problem of
many Pacific islands, where populations are mainly Melanesian. Fiji
and New Caledonia are examples.
   Australia is the major power in the region and its largest aid
donor.
   Foreign Minister Bill Hayden has expressed concern about Libyan
activities, going as far as to close down Libya's diplomatic
mission in Canberra last year after an incident involving the
aboriginal activist Michael Mansell.
   Mansell had returned from Libya saying Gadhafi was prepared to
bankroll a black revolution in Australia.
   The scattered violence in the South Seas has no single
connective thread, although in New Caledonia and French Polynesia
the crises erupted after France refused to follow the regional
pattern of decolonization and independence.
   France already suffers a major image problem in the South Seas
with the bombing of the Greenpeace vessel Rainbow Warrior in New
Zealand in 1985 and its continued underground nuclear testing on
the Mururoa atoll over the objections of almost every island state
in the region.
   The island states, supported by Australia and New Zealand, have
declared the South Pacific a nuclear-free zone.
   In a major turnaround, the United States in 1986 designated the
South Pacific an area of concern because of a buildup of the Soviet
Pacific fleet.
   U.S. officials believe the Soviet fleet consists of 755 ships
and patrol craft, including 141 submarines.
