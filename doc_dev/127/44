<HEAD>Aborigines Demand Return Of Ancestral Land</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 1,500 Taiwanese aborigines marched
Thursday to demand that the government return their ancestral lands.
   The demonstrators, some in aboriginal costumes and wearing
yellow headbands that proclaimed ``Return my land,'' ended their
march at the office of the Executive Yuan, or cabinet, where they
presented a petition.
   It urged the government to expand aboriginal land reservations
and pass a law to protect them. Taiwan has 10 aborigine tribes who
account for 1.6 percent of this island's 20 million people.
   The demonstrators say many of them have to pay rent to live on
ancestral land occupied by the state-run Taiwan Sugar Corp., or
administered by the government's Forestry Agency.
   The Interior Ministry said about 593,000 acres of land have been
reserved for aborigines. The demonstrators said their ancestors had
8 million acres in the 1940s when Japan ruled Taiwan.
   ``The land policy does not make sense,'' said Liu Wen-hsiung, a
leader of the demonstration, ``Why should I rent or buy from the
government land that my family has lived on for generations?''
