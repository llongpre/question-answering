THE last time Paul Keating met the Queen, there was a small furore when the
Australian prime minister, only two months into the job, put his arm round
the British monarch's waist. 'Mocking Her Majesty,' screamed one British
tabloid. 'Hands orf Cobber,' yelled another.
So, sitting in the Canberra's modernist Parliament House, without a silver
salver in sight, the Australian premier is trying to inject a little
gravitas to their next meeting, at Balmoral in a week's time. Questions
about his potential reception in Britain are parried with sober poise. Even
mention of the tabloid press generates sarcasm, not the colourful epithets
which Keating bandies so adroitly in local political brawls.
But if the Prime Minister's demeanour is muted, his message is not.
Republicanism - that is, Australia's right to appoint its own head of state,
rather than have the British monarch wished on it - has been Australian
Labor party policy for a decade. Mr Keating has become its most forceful
advocate.
'The republic is a constitutional, historical and political necessity for
Australia,' he declares. 'Australia cannot represent itself to the world as
a multicultural society, engage in Asia, make that link and make it
persuasively, while, in some way, at least in constitutional terms,
remaining a derivative society.'
In the Keating school of argument, the need for constitutional change
follows an economic drift. Today, Asia-Pacific accounts for more than 60 per
cent of Australia's trade while half of new immigrants come from that
region.
Twenty years ago, notes Mr Keating, Australia had a 'White Australia' policy
which mitigated against Asian migrants and was only abandoned by the
government of Gough Whitlam in the early 1970s. 'That's not a long time
ago,' he says. 'In the event, we were very lucky not to be marginalised by
Asia. 'Countries in this part of the world have long memories.'
Economic expediency, however, is only one aspect of the Republicanism
debate. Much more fundamental is Australia's search for a national identity.
This is a complex issue for a country that has increasingly significant
financial ties to its neighbours, a weight of cultural bonds with Europe,
and must somehow also find a place for its Aboriginal population, whose
rights have suddenly become big news.
This is largely because of a High Court ruling last year which found that a
group of Aboriginal people were holders of native land title. The previous
concept of 'terra nullius' - that Australia was not occupied before European
settlement - was quashed.
The Mabo ruling, named after Eddie Mabo, the leader of the Meriam people who
began the High Court case in 1982, generated a frenzied backlash from other
interested parties, notably mining companies.
A touch of fervour creeps into Mr Keating's voice when conversation turns to
Mabo. 'The stain of dispossession still affects our society and our
relationship with the indigenes,' he says. 'Mabo is part of a broader agenda
of reconciliation.
'The highest court in Australia has declared that Aboriginal custom and
title is a source of Australian common law, and that native title exists in
common law. But there is no body of administrative law to express that
native title. What the government has been developing is a body of
administrative law to hear, award and protect native title, and to see that
the dual aims of justice for aboriginal and islander people, and the
economic imperatives of the country go together.'
Some of these matters, he is sure, will surface at Balmoral, although he
does not believe he will either surprise the British monarch, or chill the
atmosphere. 'I think she will have read the things I've said in public to
date ..She has absorbed the cultures of umpteen prime ministers over the
years. I'm sure she can cope with me adequately.'
In truth, even if the atmosphere in Scotland did drop a few degrees, it
would probably be a good deal warmer than the political climate back home.
Less than six months after his unexpected election victory, Mr Keating is
being jostled on all sides.
The new government's first budget, unveiled last month, has been stymied in
parliment, and concessions wrung by both the opposition parties and the
Labor party caucus. Uncertainty surrounding passage of this package has
contributed to a plunge in the Australian dollar, now at a seven-year low.
On the crucial issue of labour market reform, Mr Keating appears to have
bowed to the powerful union lobby, and seems likely to temper government
plans. Recent polls, meanwhile, have shown a significant drop in Mr
Keating's personal approval rating.
All this has prompted some commentators to suggest that the Prime Minister -
often seen as a distant figure, who ploughs his own furrow without excessive
consultation - may have to adjust his approach. So what lessons has Mr
Keating learnt from his rough ride during the past few weeks? 'Just that
politics is rough riding,' he retorts tartly, as the diplomatic demeanour
eases briefly.
