FT  02 JUL 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mining chief accused over
aborigine claim
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS Minister Mr Robert Tickner yesterday accused Hugh Morgan,
managing director of Australia's Western Mining Corporation Holdings, of
waging a hate campaign over a court decision granting aborigines land title.
Mr Morgan, head of one of Australia's biggest mining groups, said a landmark
1992 High Court ruling on native land title, known as the Mabo ruling after
one of the original plaintiffs, would create racial tension and economic
stagnation.
'You've got a representative of one of Australia's mining giants waging this
campaign of hate and bitterness against aboriginal people and it's just got
to stop,' Mr Tickner said in a radio interview.
'It's so far over the top, so divisive, and for any of us to give it any
credibility. . . is, I think, profoundly un-Australian.'
