   Native and civil rights groups demand
the state police minister resign because of a manhunt for an
aborigine suspect in which an innocent man was fatally shot and
officers staged a fake arrest.
   An aboriginal activist group even put up posters Monday saying
the New South Wales police minister, Ted Pickering, should be shot.
   The way police conducted their search for a John Porter,
suspected of wounding two officers in Sydney a week ago, has
angered the state ombudsman and political opposition as well as
aboriginal and civil rights organizations.
   Aborigines, already chafing at the slow pace of a government
inquiry into more than 100 black deaths in police custody, accused
authorities of conducting a witch hunt in the search for Porter.
Aboriginal activists claim most of the deaths since 1980 have been
due to police brutality.
   Police Commissioner John Avery urged the suspect to surrender to
avert further bloodshed. He said investigating officers were
``abundantly aware that every move they make will come under
microscopic scrutiny.''
   ``I don't want the suspect to feel too harried or pursued or
he's going to react violently, and that means more lives will be
lost,'' Avery said. ``What we want is to resolve this peacefully
without any more people being killed.''
   Porter's family said he should not surrender.
   Jenny Davies, 28, common-law wife of the suspect's brother,
said: ``If he showed his face, police would shoot him dead. They
wouldn't give him a chance. They would shoot him on sight for sure.
One innocent man has already been shot dead by police over this.''
   Police say Porter emptied an automatic pistol at two policemen
who thought he was trying to steal a car in Sydney a week ago, then
eluded pursuit in the city and is being hunted on a national scale.
   One of the policemen, Alan McQueen, 26, was in critical
condition Monday after surgeons removed a lung, a kidney and part
of his liver. The other wounded man, 19-year Jason Donnelly, was
discharged after treatment for a stomach wound.
   When the hunt began in earnest, ``it was a bad week in Sydney
for colored men with dreadlock hair,'' the Morning Herald said.
Blacks with Rastafarian hairstyles complained of police harassment.
   Officers rounded up dozens of people for questioning, in one
case stopping a car carrying three men from Tonga. One was found to
be in Australia illegally and was deported.
   On Thursday, police stormed the home of David Gundy and fatally
shot the unarmed aborigine. Police initially said Gundy, who was in
bed, lunged at them and went for a gun, but then contradicted the
original statement.
   Richard McDonald, a neighbor, said he overheard a detective
saying: ``I was sure it was him (Porter). He was around the same
size.''
   Another neighbor, Brian Walsh, was awakened by the sound of
police kicking in Gundy's door.
   That same day, police raided six houses in Sydney and Brisbane,
in Queensland state. They fired five stun grenades into the empty
home of Porter's brother and faked an arrest that was filmed for
the evening television news, then told the media it was a hoax.
   The Gundy shooting brought calls for Pickering's resignation and
demands for a Royal Commission of Inquiry, the highest
investigation available, into police conduct.
   On Monday, an aboriginal group calling itself the Coalition
Against Legalized Murder, or CALM, distributed posters in Sydney
that showed Pickering's head framed in a gunsight and said someone
should ``upgrade'' Premier Nick Greiner's government ``with a
bullet.''
   Pickering said he was considering legal action.
