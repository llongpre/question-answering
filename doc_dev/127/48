   Aboriginal elders today invoked tribal
laws to protect a crocodile that killed a member of their tribe,
telling police to stop hunting the reptile because it is sacred.
   Police reported that aboriginal clans were holding a tribal
meeting to decide what to do after a 25-year-old aborigine of the
Gumatj tribe in the Northern Territory was found bitten in half at
a pond.
   The victim was not identified but was believed to have been
snatched while camping alone 10 miles from the mouth of the Cato
River. An autopsy was to be carried out in Darwin after the upper
half of his body was found Sunday.
   Police wanted to search for the rest of his body by shooting
saltwater crocodiles that inhabit the Cato River of Arnhem Land,
near where the attack took place.
   But aboriginal elders today gave police strict instructions not
to shoot or even approach any crocodile they suspect is responsible
until a decision is made.
   Saltwater crocodiles are found across northern Australia. The
reptiles were declared a protected species in 1974 when they were
threatened with extinction because of indiscriminate hunting for
their skins. Conservationists now note that crocodiles, which have
no natural predators, have grown in size and have lost their fear
of man.
   At least 11 people have been killed by crocodiles in the past
two years.
   Brian Walsh, the Northern Territory Conservation Commission's
chief wildlife officer, said local aborigines regard crocodiles as
sacred.
   ``You have to realize that in East Arnhem Land the crocodile is
of totemic significance and is very important to the culture ... so
they won't make any decision until they have all sat down and had a
meeting about it,'' he said.
