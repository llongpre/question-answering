   About 300 aborigines smashed windows,
damaged cars and fought with police late Monday following the
funeral of an aboriginal man who died in a jail cell.
   Police reported seven people were arrested during the violence
in Geraldton, a town in Western Australia state 360 miles north of
Perth.
   Geraldton police superintendent Adrian Barnes said no one was
seriously injured in the rioting.
   Mayor Faye Campbell estimated the damage at $80,000.
   Some of the aborigines had attended the funeral Monday of Edward
Charles Cameron, 23, who was found hanged in a cell at the town
jail on July 8. He had been charged with breaking into a store and
was awaiting trial.
   After the service the aborigines marched to a building in
central Geraldton where the Western Australia state Cabinet was
meeting and a delegation met with Premier Peter Dowding and Police
Minister Ian Taylor.
   The delegation, led by Cameron's father and aboriginal elder
Leedham Cameron, called for the removal of the policeman in charge
of the inquiry into the jail death.
   Cameron said important information relating to his son's death
had been withheld by the investigating officer, inspector Eric
Cousins, but he did not elaborate. Taylor refused the delegation's
demand that he remove Cousins from the inquiry.
