AUSTRALIAN aborigines yesterday threatened an avalanche of land claims,
after a High Court judgment had recognised the existence of land titles
pre-dating European settlement in 1788.
The High Court ruled that the Miriam people of the Murray Islands, part of
the Torres Strait islands group off the north coast of mainland Australia,
had retained ownership of their land under common law.
The court restricted its judgment to the Murrays, and ruled that the concept
of 'native title' could exist only where such rights had not been
extinguished by the government.
However, aboriginal leaders said the judgment challenged the legal status of
the Australian government, which relies for its legitimacy on the claim that
the country was terra nullius when annexed by Britain.
This signifies that the land was effectively unoccupied, or occupied by
people who lacked a system of land tenure which would have inhibited
annexation and settlement.
The concept is regarded as a significant obstacle to land rights claims by
aborigines, who account for less than 1 per cent of Australia's 17m
population, but claim ownership of much of the country.
Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu, chairman of the aboriginal Northern Lands Council,
said the federal government would face 'a barrage of litigation' unless it
moved quickly to negotiate a treaty with aborigines. 'The pathetic excuse of
terra nullius is now dead,' Mr Yunupingu said.
The court decision was 'a turning point in the history of this country, and
it kills off all the nonsense that Aboriginal people don't exist. It sets a
whole new precedent for aboriginal people,' he added.
Mr David Allen, the Lands Council's senior legal adviser, said 'significant
numbers' of aboriginal people would have a 'reasonable prospect' of
succeeding in land claims based on the decision.
