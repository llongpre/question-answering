   A protest over Aboriginal land rights
turned violent today as a group of about 400 demonstrators ripped
down the state Parliament's front gate and clashed with police.
   A police spokesman said 11 protesters were arrested and charged
with offenses ranging from assaulting police to malicious damage.
   The violence broke out after several protesters scaled the iron
gates of the New South Wales Parliament House and members of the
increasingly irate crowd managed to rip out two sections of the
gate.
   Protesters poured toward Parliament's front door and were met by
police reinforcements. Scuffles broke out as police battled to
remove the protesters.
   Police kept the protesters from entering the building. They
managed to force the crowd back onto the street and formed a human
chain to cover the six-meter-wide hole in the fence.
   The demonstrators took away a section of the cast-iron front
gate and dumped it in the street. Chanting and waving signs, they
also began throwing beer cans and rocks at police.
   The march was organized to protest an alleged lack of
consultation over changes that the state government plans in the
Aboriginal Land Rights Act. The amended act is expected to be
passed by the state Parliament's Upper House this week.
   Last month, the Aboriginal Land Council and the state government
reached an agreement that both said would guarantee land council
autonomy.
   Land Council chairman David Clark described it as a ``historic''
agreement because it was the first time Aborigines, Australia's
indigenous people, were consulted in forming policies that affect
them.
   The amendments give the Land Council automony at a grass-roots
level and provide for the election of a 13-member, state-level
body.
   But there is dissatisfaction in some quarters because the
amendments are shifting power away from the middle tier of the
power structure.
   State Premier Nick Greiner expressed disappointment at the
protest.
   ``This is a minority group that feels its power base has been
eroded - they're probably right about that and they are entitled to
their view,'' he said. ``They're not entitled to express it in a
ratbag way.''
   Land councils in New South Wales were established in 1983 as a
three-tiered, democratically elected system to administer
Aboriginal land.
   The councils invest their allotment of a land tax in property
and businesses. Some Aborigines, but far from all, live on rural
land that is purchased by the councils. Many of those who hold jobs
work for businesses bought by the land councils.
