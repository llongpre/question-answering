   An aborigine on Tuesday asked Ireland to return
the 128-year-old preserved head of an aborigine warrior to
Australia for burial.
   Aborigine Rikki Shields said he has written to Ireland's
President Patrick Hillery to help in the campaign to move the head
from the Dublin headquarters of the Royal College of Surgeons in
Ireland to Australia.
   The head is said to be that of Pemulwoy, who once led an
aborigine guerrilla campaign against the British in Australia. He
was captured and killed in 1862.
   ``His head was sent to London, but his memory lives in the minds
of the aboriginal people,'' said Shields, who is visiting Ireland.
   A spokesman for the Royal College of Surgeons said the head,
which is not on public display because of the controversy, was left
to them in a bequest a century ago and they had to honor it.
   ``I challenge the college's right to the head,'' Shields said.
``I also want the return of other aboriginal objects which might be
in Ireland.
   ``The British stole them, but the Irish are perpetuating the
crime,'' Shields said.
