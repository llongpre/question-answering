   A quarrel over batteries for a portable
radio led to the Outback shooting deaths of a famed aboriginal bark
painter and five members of his family, police said today.
   Police said their prime suspect was the artist's son-in-law,
whose wife was among the victims, and that an extensive search by
air and with aboriginal trackers was under way for him in remote
Arnhem Land of the Northern Territory.
   Detective Superintendent Terry O'Brien of Darwin police said
several members of painter Dick Ngielu's family survived the
massacre and found help on Tuesday.
   They told police that Ngielu's son-in-law was angry because
there were no batteries for the family radio. He also had a fight
with his wife, Cecelia, over the sale of some bark pictures for
$160, arguing she should have given the money to her father and not
spent it, O'Brien said.
   He said the son-law was aged 22, but did not identify him.
   The family, according to eyewitnesses, was shot to death at
close range with a 12-gauge shotgun.
   Also killed was Ngielu's wife, Dolly, and Cecelia's two sons,
aged two and four. Another man, believed to be Ngielu's brother,
was also slain.
   The Australian National Gallery in Canberra owns two of Ngielu's
bark paintings and said it would seek permission from his tribe to
exhibit them. It is taboo under aboriginal tribal law to mention
the named of a deceased until 12 months after his death.
   Arts Curator Wally Caruana said the gallery was seeking
permission to display the two bark works. One depicts two women and
a man and the other two men on a python.
   O'Brien said the family members trekked about 30 miles before
they were found by geologists, who had just arrived on a field trip.
