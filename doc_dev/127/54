   The remains of eight Aborigines have
been returned to their communities after years on display in
British, French and Belgian museums.
   Aboriginal activist Michael Mansell and Aborigine Karno Walker
were met by elders and community representatives from around
Australia when they arrived with the remains at Sydney Airport on
Wednesday night.
   Mansell said the remains, which included parts of eight bodies,
would be given to their original communities and ``finally laid to
rest'' in burial ceremonies.
   He said lobbying for other remains still in overseas museums
would continue.
   ``Some institutions need prompting from the Australian
government. It has to step behind us to stop our moves being
frustrated,'' he said.
   Mansell and the Federation of Aboriginal Land Councils had
fought for five years to have the remains returned to communities
around Australia, and not to museums here.
