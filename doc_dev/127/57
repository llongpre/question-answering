<TEXT>     "The picture emerged that these particular aboriginal young people had been
subjected to violence at the hands of state officials on many occasions," said
the report written by Chris Cunneen, a criminologist from New South Wales
state.;    The report, part of a two-year study by the National Inquiry into
Racist Violence, says 85 percent of youths interviewed reported being hit,
punched, kicked or slapped by police.;    The inquiry cited incidents of
violence, harassment and intimidation of people of non-English speaking
backgrounds, including Muslims and other members of the Arab and Middle
Eastern community, Asians, Latin Americans and Jews.  </TEXT>
