Aborigines demanding the return of traditional tribal lands fought hand to hand 
with police Wednesday in front of Taiwan's Parliament.

Witnesses said the scuffle broke out when aborigines tried to force their way 
into the building to meet the Speaker of Parliament. One aborigine was led away 
with a gaping head wound. No other injuries were reported.

The fight occurred as more than 1,000 aborigines, many dressed in the feathered 
headdresses and beaded vests of their mountain-dwelling ancestors, staged a 
march through Taipei to demand land rights.
