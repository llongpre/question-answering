A native title bill, which sets up a system for deciding land claims by
Australia's Aborigines and Torres Strait islanders, was approved by the
Senate yesterday.
The legislation, passed after a marathon parliamentary debate that began on
Friday, will come into effect on January 1. Mr Paul Keating, the Australian
prime minister who took a personal role in negotiating the bill with
Aboriginal leaders, described it as 'a turning point for all Australians'.
'This has been the longest continuing problem that Australia has faced for
200 years, recognising that indigenous people, that native people, had the
right to their own soil,' he said.
For two centuries Australia's land management system has operated on the
principle that the land was uninhabited before European settlement. This
concept was overturned in a High Court ruling last year, which said native
title could exist where there had been 'close and continuing' association
with the land in question. However, the court added that land titles
acquired under accepted law since European settlement should not be
disturbed. The native title bill tries to marry these two rulings.
The bill has been highly controversial. Mining companies argue it will mean
that exploration becomes more costly and unpredictable. But the government
and Aboriginal groups say the number of successful land claims will be
small, benefiting perhaps 10 per cent of the Aboriginal population and
mainly involving vacant crown land.
Over one-seventh of Australia's 1m square miles has already been set aside,
in one way or another, for the country's 265,000 aboriginal and Torres
Strait islander people.
The bill, debate over which had threatened to continue over the holiday
period, passed the Senate 34-30 just after midnight. The lower House of
Representatives, where the government holds a majority, is scheduled to
approve the bill this morning.
