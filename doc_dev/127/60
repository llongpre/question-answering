   Seven Aborigines _ four children and
three adults _ died of thirst on a desert road after their truck
broke down in 120-degree heat in the Australian Outback, police
said Friday.
   As each victim perished, those remaining in the group of 11
buried them along the road, officials said. Police found three
survivors in the Great Australian Sandy Desert on Thursday, which
led to the recovery of four of the bodies in shallow graves.
   Police officers and the Royal Flying Doctor Service searched the
harsh Outback in helicopters, light planes and four-wheel drives in
hopes of finding another man who left the band to get help. He was
feared dead.
   ``I think it just reinforces our constant warnings to people
traveling in the Outback to be careful out there,'' said police
spokesman John Skeffington. ``These people are well versed in
bushcraft and survival techniques and yet they perished.''
   The survivors were picked up by a passing motorist and were
reported in stable condition in Port Hedland Regional Hospital.
   A police spokesman said the group left Port Hedland in far
Western Australia state last Friday to return to their remote
aboriginal home at Punma, 680 miles to the east.
   Police said the flat-top vehicle was stranded about 75 miles
from the settlement in Rudall River National Park of Western
Australia.
