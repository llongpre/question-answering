   A real-life ```Crocodile' Dundee'' is
heading for America. Meet the Bush Tucker Man, Australia's newest
folk hero.
   But unlike the character made famous by Paul Hogan in two hit
movies, Les Hiddins is for real, and his TV show on how to survive
on food found in the bush is one of the most popular programs around.
   A major in the Australian army, Hiddins has spent 10 years in the
bush showing soldiers how to survive on tucker, Australian slang for
food. Bush tucker is food that abounds in the bush, such as ``crocky
apples,'' ``mangrove worms,'' ``matchbox beans,'' ``supple jack'' (a
kind of celery) and ``witchety grubs'' which resemble giant worms
and taste like cashew nuts.
   Snakes and lizards also get the thumbs up from Hiddins.
   He says he never gets ill, but a typical Hiddins bush menu might
make the less adventurous slightly queasy.
   Supper to him might be ``devil's guts'' with fruit from a plant
he calls ``dog's vomit tree'' because it tastes so awful, washed
down with water from a billabong, the aboriginal word for pond.
   ``When I can, I eat steak and eggs like all Australians,'' he
said. ``But it doesn't always work out right. That's when you start
scratching for food.''
   Napoleon Bonaparte, who said an army marches on its stomach, may
have had second thoughts if he had seen Hiddins' menu. But to the
Australian army Hiddins is a hero who deserves a medal.
   Thanks to the hidden things he finds, and talks about on his
show, the army is mapping entire northern Australia from the
Kimberleys in the West to Cape York in the East _ with photographs
of what's edible in each area _ just in case Australian soldiers are
ever forced to live off the land in the Outback.
   ``The army is indebted to him,'' said Lt. Col. Ian Edwardeson.
``If Australians ever find themselves at war in those areas, the
army would know how to survive. You can't put a price on that.''
   Hiddins is not easy to reach. He has covered 31,000 miles in his
quest for undiscovered bush foods. He spends eight months of the
year in the bush, and in a recent interview attributed ``99.9
percent'' of his bush tucker knowledge to aborigines. He has listed
600 kinds of foods.
   ``When I was a kid I used to eat bush tucker,'' he said. ``I used
to eat the odd green ant.''
   His hobby developed after reading about Australian explorers who
perished in the interior for lack of food in areas indigenous
aborigines regard as a pantry.
   In one episode of ``Bush Tucker Man,'' Hiddins stood in the wreck
of an American B-24 bomber, Little Eva, which had crashed in
northern Queensland in 1942 during World War II. Three American crew
members perished because they didn't know what to eat in the bush.
   ``The whole area in which they perished is loaded with food; it's
like a supermarket,'' Hiddins said.
   The army has published 400 different maps of Hiddins'
gastronomical guide to the Outback and several hundred more are to
be printed, Edwardeson said.
   The swarthy 42-year-old bushman is to quit the army next year to
become a civilian consultant to the army.
   According to Australian Broadcasting Corp. production manager
Anne Chivas, ``Bush Tucker Man'' is one of the network's most
popular programs. She said it has been offered to the United States
and a second series may be in the making.
   ``Bush Tucker Man'' is the latest television series in which
Australians are rediscovering the Outback. The ```Crocodile'
Dundee'' movies were smash hits here and in America. ``The Nature of
Australia,'' a PBS series celebrating Australia's bicentennial, won
rave reviews here.
   Aborigines, Australia's indigenous inhabitants, have always known
the bush was a supermarket, as well as a giant drugstore. For
centuries, they used plants, leaves and barks to solve ailments
ranging from arthritis and stomach problems to flu, skin sores and
itching.
   ``I used to think (aboriginal remedies) were hocus pocus,'' said
Andy Barr, a pharmacist with the Northern Territory Health
Department. ``Not anymore.''
