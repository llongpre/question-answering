   Since releasing its first album in 1978, the
Australian rock group Midnight Oil has taken on a wide range of
issues: the environment, human rights, the arms race, unemployment.
   ``Diesel and Dust,'' their latest LP, is no exception. Songs
such as ``Beds Are Burning'' and ``Dreamworld'' warn about coming
to terms with a changing world. ``The Dead Heart'' attacks
exploitation of aborigines in Australia. ``Warakurna'' is a demand
for a better life.
   The group's lead singer, Peter Garrett, is not the type of
person who keeps his opinions to himself.
   ``I am prepared to debate anybody,'' said Garrett, who is
recuperating from a leg injury suffered during a recent show. ``I
grew up in a household where politics was not a dirty word.
   ``I have a great interest in what's going on. I have opinions
but I also want to be able to back it up.''
   Garrett's interest in the affairs of his country go beyond
making records. He has written newspaper columns on current issues,
taken an active role in trying to rewrite the Australian
Constitution and, most prominently, ran for the Senate in 1984 as a
candidate for the Nuclear Disarmament Party.
   ``The major politicians tried to make fun of the issue. They
said it was simplistic, emotional, single-issue, naive politics,''
said Garrett, who was narrowly defeated. ``They alienated everybody
who liked rock music. It changed people's attitudes.
   ``I was surprised that the leading politicians were lying. We
were trying to tell the truth.''
   Midnight Oil was formed in the 1970s and released its first
album, ``Midnight Oil,'' in 1978. While they have yet to achieve
major popularity in the United States, their records have
consistently sold well in Australia. In 1982, the LP
``10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1'' reached No. 1 and went triple platinum.
``Red Sails in the Sunset,'' released in 1984, also topped the
Australian charts.
   Midnight Oil contributed royalties from 1985's ``Species
Diseases'' to a trust fund for peace and disarmament. They have
performed at countless benefit concerts.
   ``We're making our people understand we've got a part in their
lives,'' Garrett said. ``We care about the price of the T-shirts.
We're not pop stars on a guided tour. The band's not that kind of
band.''
   Besides Garrett, the band features drummer Rob Hirdt, guitarist
Martin Rotsey, guitarist and keyboardist Jim Moginie and bassist
Peter Gifford. All the songs on ``Diesel and Dust'' are credited to
Midnight Oil. And all the songs are about Australia.
   ``We find so much going on in Australia,'' Garrett said. ``We're
never without something to write about.''
   Midnight Oil has spent considerable time helping aborigines, an
ancient tribe whose plight has been similar to American Indians.
They have toured aboriginal communities and on ``Diesel and Dust''
included the song ``Bullroarer,'' which refers to an aboriginal
musical instrument.
   ``The bullroarer is used to provide warnings when sacred
ceremonies are being undertaken by aboriginal people,'' Garrett
said. ``Having gone into the desert and spent time with them has
given us a shot in the arm about trying to write about these
things.''
   Because Australia is still a member of the United Kingdom and
has extensive relations with the United States, Garrett is
especially conscious of the impact those countries have on his
native land.
   On ``The Dead Heart,'' Garrett sings of Britain: ``We don't
serve your country, don't serve your king.''
   ``The Queen is still head of Australia,'' said Garrett. ``Our
constitution is in England.''
   Garrett also has been critical of the United States, especially
of its policy of bringing nuclear armed warships to Australia. He
acknowledges, however, the enormous influence the United States has
had on his country.
   ``You're very conscious of the headmaster, the bully. That whole
thing of size and power and strength and vitality. Awesomeness that
can't be escaped,'' Garrett said. ``You're eating it; you're
consuming it as entertainment. It affects your standard of living.
It's always there. It's like the sun.''
   Garrett also believes that being an Australian as opposed to an
American band has helped Midnight Oil stay in touch with its fans.
   ``In America, it's quite natural to have stars,'' he said. ``In
Australia, we tend to view each other as just people.''
   Garrett insists, however, that he is not anti-American. ``I've
said some terrible things about America but there are parts of it
which I think are terrific.''
   Although Garrett spends a great deal of time focusing on the
problems of his country and the world, he is far from pessimistic
about the future.
   The last song on ``Diesel and Dust'' is called ``Sometimes.''
The last words of ``Sometimes'' are: ``You don't give in.''
   ``This is not end of the world music,'' Garrett said. ``There's
always hope _ that's what it's all about.''
