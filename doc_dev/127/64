   A woman who said a wild dog snatched
and ate her newborn child has been found innocent of murder.
   The court decision closes the book on an 8-year-old case that
divided Australia and captured headlines worldwide.
   The Northern Territory Court of Criminal Appeal in Darwin on
Thursday overturned Lindy Chamberlain's sentence of life
imprisonment with hard labor. She spent about four years in jail.
   It also quashed the conviction of her husband, Michael, a pastor
for the Seventh Day Adventist Church, on charges of being an
accessory to murder.
   Mrs. Chamberlain, who was born in New Zealand, became a
household name in 1980 when she said a dingo, or native Australian
dog, carried off her 6-week-old daughter Azaria while the family
camped in the Outback near Ayers Rock, a sacred aboriginal site.
   Replete with rumors of black magic and a suicide that led to a
break in the case, the Chamberlain story made Page 1 in newspapers
across Australia and elsewhere. All Australians seem to have an
opinion on the woman's story.
   In 1987, she was pardoned but her conviction was not overturned.
Thursday's innocent verdict finally sealed the case shut.
   Gasps filled the courtroom when the decision was announced.
Michael Chamberlain clasped his hands to his head and wept. His
wife, who had been staring at the judges, slumped in her seat.
   ``The law of the land holds the Chamberlains to be innocent,''
said the ruling.
   The Chamberlains' defense attorney had accused the Northern
Territory government, which originally prosecuted the pair, of
waging a ``modern-day witchunt.''
   The lawyer, Stuart Tipple, said the Chamberlains were waiting to
see whether the government would pay the couple compensation before
deciding on any civil action. Earlier, he said the couple was
seeking about $750,000.
   After the verdict, Mrs. Chamberlain, a tiny woman in high-heeled
red shoes, was thronged by curious onlookers as she strode with
straightened shoulders from the courthouse.
   The crowd clamored for a closer look as the couple made their
way through the large crowd to their car. Construction workers
nearby downed tools and whistled while others jeered.
   The Chamberlain drama began on a cold night in August 1980 when
Mrs. Chamberlain cried out at the family camp side at Ayers Rock,
central Australia, ``A dingo's got my baby!''
   At first, the Chamberlains' story was believed. But when the
couple went to court, Mrs. Chamberlain was accused of slitting her
baby's throat.
   The baby's body was never found, but bloodstains were found in
the couple's tent.
   On Oct. 29, 1982, the Chamberlains were found guilty and Mrs.
Chamberlain was sentenced to life in prison, where she to gave
birth to a second daughter, Kahlia. Her husband was sentenced to a
suspended 18-month sentence.
   The couple has two other sons, Aiden and Reagan. Although the
prosecution never alleged black magic as a motive, many Australians
have linked the death of baby Azaria to witchcraft and satanic
rites, believing the children have mystical names.
   The family denied rumors that the name Azaria meant ``sacrifice
in the wilderness.'' Many Australians also thought it significant
that the death occurred at Ayers Rock, sacred to aborigines in one
of the most remote parts of Australia.
   In February 1986, a remarkable breakthrough in the case came
when a British tourist jumped off the huge monolith to his death.
   Aboriginal trackers investigating the suicide found the tattered
remains of Azaria's jacket, which Mrs. Chamberlain swore the baby
was wearing the night she vanished.
   The discovery of the jacket proved that Mrs. Chamberlain had not
been lying about at least one aspect of her baby's death and
prompted officials to reopen the case.
   Five days after the jacket was found, Mrs. Chamberlain was
released from prison. On June 2, 1987, a federal judge pardoned her
and said Mrs. Chamberlain may have told the truth when she said the
dingo snatched and ate the baby.
   ``Indeed, the evidence affords the view that a dingo may have
taken her,'' federal Judge Trevor Morling wrote in his opinion.
   But under Australian law, the pardon was as far as Trevor could
go and the Chamberlains returned to court to overturn the
conviction.
   ``There is no satisfaction, no joy, knowing they still believe
you are guilty,'' Mrs. Chamberlain said at the time.
   Although the court case is over, the Chamberlain story will
continue.
   American movie star Meryl Streep recently finished filming a
movie on the case based on a book titled ``Evil Angels.'' The
American release is provisionally called ``A Cry In The Darkness.''
