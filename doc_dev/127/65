MINING investment is likely to be diverted from Australia to other countries
if the government bans mining at the disputed Coronation Hill site in the
Northern Territory, the mining industry warned yesterday.
'International miners and Australian miners are saying we might as well go
to other places where the government is interested in further development,'
said Mr Lauchlan McIntosh, director of the Australian Mining Industry
Council.
His comments followed the release of a report into Coronation Hill by the
Resource Assessment Commission (RAC), a government advisory body set up to
investigate the competing claims of miners, aboriginal landowners and
environmental groups.
The government initially indicated that mining at Coronation Hill would be
allowed, but imposed a temporary ban in 1989 after environmental groups
claimed it would threaten the Kakadu national park, a wilderness area
adjacent to the site.
Significant gold reserves have been identified at the site by the Coronation
Hill Joint Venture, which comprises Newcrest Mining (formerly BHP Gold
Mines), Norgold, and Plutonic Resources (formerly Pioneer Minerals (Gold).
The RAC report says mining would have only minor environmental consequences,
but would infringe the religious beliefs of the Jaowyn tribe, the
traditional aboriginal owners of the land.
It also hints that a ban on mining would not have serious economic
consequences if the government explained carefully to mining companies that
the site was regarded as a special case.
The report makes no recommendations, but sets out a series of seven options
ranging from a ban on mining, through limited development in consultation
with the Jaowyn, to full development as proposed by the joint venture.
However, Mr McIntosh said Coronation Hill was seen as a 'litmus test' by the
mining industry, and warned that limits on mining would be regarded as
confirmation that the government was prepared to break its own rules.
'It has clearly become an emotional issue because of the way the government
has handled the whole crisis,' he said. 'The country is going broke, and it
would be disappointing to think that we cannot get to the stage where we can
have some more pragmatic decisions.'
Mr McIntosh said Australia would be regarded as 'elitist and preservationist
if we continue with this nonsense of saying every tiny area in the country
has some special significance to small groups of people.'
Mr Bob Hawke, the prime minister, said the RAC report presented the
government with a difficult decision, but refused to comment further. Mr
Hawke has previously argued that Coronation Hill is a special case
'involving a combination of complex and sensitive issues which would only
rarely occur.'
The federal cabinet is expected to discuss the report shortly, and a
decision is expected early next month.
