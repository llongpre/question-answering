capture of the 2000 Olympics Games is helping to keep Australians smiling
during a bout of painful restructuring

BY A curious quirk of fate, Australia secured the 2000 Olympic Games exactly
10 years after Alan Bond, the Perth-based businessman, won the America's
Cup. Was this, local commentators wondered, a favourable omen?
For many Australians, the America's Cup triumph is still a glorious memory.
Not only did a nation prone to viewing itself as an appendage on the edge of
the world take on the best and win, but the yachting victory against the
Yanks seemed to usher in an era when Australian businessmen strode the world
stage and prosperity rained down.
True, this golden age ended - less than a decade later - in overstretched
balance sheets and a rash of bankruptcies. But already there is speculation
that Australia's latest sporting prize could mark a similar uprush of
confidence and herald a second economic renaissance.
In reality, this seems too optimistic. Many changes are being wrought in
Australia at present, both on the cultural and economic fronts, but they are
of a far more fundamental nature than a lot of easy bank lending. As a
result, they are also more complex and contentious. A very different nation
may emerge at the end of the day - probably more competitive, and certainly
more diverse. But there is no sign that the transformation process is about
to become easy.
Australia's trade relations are a case in point. Australia started to throw
its lot in with the Asia-Pacific region almost two decades ago, but the
strategy has accelerated in recent years, first under Bob Hawke's Labor
government, and then under his successor, Paul Keating. Today, the pro-Asia
policy cuts across party political lines and, given the growth potential of
that region, is generally judged astute. But the pace and manner in which
the 'new order' is blended with the older, Euro-centric ties still prompts
debate.
Australia's decision to 'opt into Asia' was always a hard-headed one, driven
more by economic necessity than philosophical ruminations.
When established trading partners - Britain, in particular - started to
concentrate on their internal European market, and the US began moving
towards a North American 'free trade' block, Australia was forced to think
long and hard about its own position.
As Mr Keating has pointed out, his country was fortunate to find the Asian
doors still open. 'Twenty years ago, Australia had a White Australia policy
(discriminating against Asian immigrants),' he has noted. 'In the event, we
were very lucky not to be marginalised in the Asia-Pacific region.'
Today, politicians and trade mission leaders like to recall that 60 per cent
of Australia's trade is conducted in Asia-Pacific, compared with about
one-quarter 30 years ago, and that eight of the country's top dozen export
markets lie in this area. This is true, although it is should be added that
Japan still dominates the picture. In the year to end-June, the Japanese
took a hefty 25 per cent of Australia's total exports, almost double that of
the Asean nations (Singapore, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Brunei and
Indonesia).
Australia's salesmen have to work harder to dispel the notion that their
country acts as the region's 'farm and quarry', supplying raw agricultural
and commodity products which neighbours with cheaper labour then convert
into manufactured items.
In reality, about 61 per cent of the ADollars 60bn annual exports take the
form of manufactured goods. Of this, perhaps one-third are 'higher-valued
added' items. That is a marked improvement on the 11.5 per cent share taken
by more sophisticated manufactures back in 1986-87, although no one seems
keen to predict how much further the trend may go. 'People are loath to nail
a number to the mast,' says Steve Prytz, at the Australian Manufacturing
Council.
But glance at the nation's investment inflows, and a very different picture
emerges. Here, Australia's 'old partners' - the US and the UK - still
dominate, supplying over 60 per cent of new foreign capital ploughed into
Australia in the 12 months to end-June. Japan, until it fell on hard times,
was also prominent. Asean countries, by contrast, accounted for less than
two per cent of total foreign investment in Australia at mid-1993.
So, when it comes to pleading for investment dollars, state government
agencies suddenly remember their former heritage - and sing the virtues of
Australia's clement environment, Western-style facilities, trained labour
force, and so on.
The worry, then, for some Australians is that emphasis on Asian links could
risk demoting older ties, which still have a good deal to offer.
'East Asia is extremely important, but so also are Europe and North
America,' remarked Professor Robert O'Neill, the Australian-born director of
London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, in a recent public
lecture.
HE said: 'The economic prospects offered by East Asia are indeed impressive,
but it remains a politically weak area. Even in terms of economic relations,
Australia may find that it is increasingly on a playing field which slopes
uphill.'
If foreign relations are a delicate balancing act, moves to loosen the
historically-protected Australian economy have produced more acute tensions.
Steady privatisation of government-owned enterprises and the use of
competition to promote efficiency have been keystones in recent government
policy. In a country where one person in four still works for the public
sector, this, too, is broadly applauded.
But dogma has sometimes ridden roughshod over common sense and the
limitations of a small population base. Attempts to deregulate Australia's
domestic airline industry, for example, prompted only one new carrier to
take to the skies. It subsequently collapsed, twice, within three years.
In the media sector, an auction system which was supposed to distribute
licences to operate satellite pay-TV led to high but speculative bids from a
couple of start-up companies. They were duly declared winners - only for the
authorities to discover that cash, at the promised levels, was not
forthcoming.
More seriously, the quest for efficiency has created social hurdles. On the
one hand, recession and the need to restore balance sheets has prompted many
companies to streamline activities by asset disposals, plant closures and
the like. There is nothing uniquely Australian about this; a similar
response has occurred in most Western economies in the face of sluggish
demand. And, as in the US, there is every sign that corporate profitability
is beginning to benefit from the catharsis.
But Australia is also committed to a big reduction in its tariff barriers by
the year 2000, which is essential if the country is to join the Asian party.
This, in turn, has prompted some multinationals to rethink the economics of
manufacturing locally. Last July, for example, Isuzu Motors announced that
it would stop making trucks in Australia in about three years. By that
stage, the tariff on trucks should have dropped to five per cent, compared
with 12 per cent at present.
For the working population, the combined effect of these two trends has been
devastating. The unemployment rate remains stuck in double-digit figures
and, as the structural upheavals continue, few economists are willing to
predict any significant reduction in the foreseeable future. That, in turn,
has done nothing to ease relations between the government and the labour
movement. These have already been strained as Australia tries to develop a
devolved, enterprise-based wage-bargaining system - essential to freeing up
a labour market which has been among the most heavily-regulated in the OECD.
Culturally, some of the challenges are just as tough. 1993 was named the
year of the indigenous people and Aboriginal music is selling in high street
record stores.
But the fight over land rights remains heated, and the High Court's 1992
'Mabo' ruling - which overthrew the notion that Australia was uninhabited
before European settlement and declared that native title could exist where
Aborigines had retained a close association with the land - has yet to be
translated into a viable system for deciding native title claims.
On this score, a political compromise, which wins a modicum of backing from
many of the interested parties, is finally on the table, although the
all-important details have yet to be fleshed out. Even then, it is unlikely
that the Aboriginal community will see this as a final settlement of past
wrongs: 'a native title bill is just a first step,' comments one moderate
representative. 'We're going to have to do this piecemeal.'
Mr Keating has indicated that the discordant strains could be better
harmonised under a 'Republican' flag. To some observers, this is cheap
politicking - an attempt to divert people from real underlying issues, with
a largely symbolic rallying cry. But that, perhaps, misses the point. When a
country goes through a fundamental and painful adjustment, a little
attention to the symbols may be no bad thing.
