<TEXT>     The officers, who also were pelted with rocks, suffered cuts and bruises
but were not injured seriously, Coffey said Friday.;    Six men were arrested
and charged with assault.;    But a police spokesman said the kangaroo tails
won't be introduced as evidence because it is believed that they were eaten by
the aborigines after the alleged attack.;    Kangaroo tails are considered a
dietary staple for many of Australia's native people in the Outback.;   
Coffey said police believe the attack stemmed from an earlier attempt by
police to move a man sitting in the middle of a highway in an apparent suicide
bid. The man refused to move, and a fight developed, Coffey said.  </TEXT>
