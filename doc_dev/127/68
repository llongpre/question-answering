The resurgence of aboriginal art throughout Australia over the past 20 years
is nothing short of a triumph for a people who until as late as the 1960s
were believed to have been driven to the verge of extinction. The surviving
Koori, Murri, Nyungar, Nunga, Yolngu and Anangu people with their 300
languages and culture rooted in the religious significance of the land, are
now making considerable progress in their political and cultural endeavours.
The survival of aboriginal art, and, most importantly, the development by
the artists and their communities of ways of making it available to a
non-aboriginal audience both inside and increasingly beyond Australia, have
been crucial in this regeneration. Aratjara, now at the Hayward Gallery, is
the largest exhibition of aboriginal art ever to be seen in Europe.
Approaching such unfamiliar work always presents difficulties. Does one read
lots of books beforehand and go in armed with theory or just plunge ahead
and hope for the best? I opted for the latter, making my first circuit
guided only by my own eyes. Just looking, several features were immediately
obvious - the stylistic differences between various regions, and a much
wider range of subjects and styles than expected. It also ensured that
initial 'judgment' of the work was, as in any other gallery context, made on
the basis of contemplating its form, composition and colour.
There were surprises - the large, brightly coloured canvas 'My Country',
1992, by Ginger Riley Munduwalawala outstanding in a room full of ochre and
brown cross hatched bark paintings by his fellow artists from Arnhem land,
or the politically charged paintings, screen prints and photographs from the
urban south east, stylistically familiar icons of an unfamiliar struggle.
In the rooms devoted to the art of the central and western desert, stylistic
progression began to become evident, as images obviously still based on
religious or ceremonial markings were painted first on composition board and
then on canvas. The last room is filled with enormous paintings which
although composed of signs and symbols 'readable' to those who know their
language also operate as superb examples of what we would term abstract art.
Although study is needed to appreciate the full meaning of the images or the
techniques used to create them, works such as the superb 'Jardiwarnpa
Jukurrpa' or 'Fire Dreaming' make a powerful impact even before the full
significance of the various elements of their composition is elucidated.
'Fire Dreaming', a communal work created by 21 women and seven men of the
Yuendumu community, was specially commissioned for the exhibition,and
presents a 'picture' of the community and its location, including its sacred
sites, painted in the brightly coloured dotted patterns now identified as
'western desert art'. By its use of carefully selected images from the
traditional ground or body paintings presented as a wall hung canvas, the
piece demonstrates the developments aboriginal artists have made both
formally in their work and in its mediation to the rest of the world.
What is most striking about the 'Fire Dreaming,' or about the work of Ginger
Riley or that of Rover Thomas Julama, one of two aboriginal artists who
represented Australia at the Venice Biennale of 1990, is the confidence and
strength of purpose of the artists. Using the expanded palette that acrylic
paints have made available to them, they have reinterpreted their
traditional themes specifically in order that they may be seen by
non-aboriginal eyes; the concept of 'outsiders' seeing the paintings is thus
inherent in their composition and execution.
Those who worry about 'authenticity' or that the artists somehow lose out by
showing in western style galleries or selling in the western style art
market which flourishes in Australia should calm their fears. It is just for
that market that these works have been adapted and created. And this is a
good thing; it means that the aboriginal artists are in control. The images
which they trade have been created for that purpose, passed by their elders
and ritual guardians as appropriate for strangers' eyes. Other, secret,
images continue to be used for traditional religious purposes.
These works designed for us still offer a glimpse into another world, where
artists and their communities share a dynamic relation to their creation
myths, the representation and observance of which gives purpose and meaning
to their lives, and now also provides a useful tool to help redress the
balance against the incoming society which has been dominant for 200 years.
The creation of 'Fire Dreaming' was accompanied by 'Big dancing ceremony,
men, women, girls . . . really big business,' according to Dolly Daniels,
one of the artists who worked on it.
These remarkable pictures command respect, both for their beauty and
sophisticated combination of the assumptions of our opposing cultures,
permitting a glimpse of an ancient way of life our own ancestors tried so
hard, but thankfully so unsuccessfully, to destroy.
