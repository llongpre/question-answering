MR Paul Keating, the Australian prime minister, has rejected calls by
Comalco and the Queensland government to protect the aluminium producer from
aboriginal claims to its bauxite leases in the state, Reuter reports from
Melbourne.
Comalco, 67 per cent owned by the CRA resources group, said last month it
had been served with a native land claim by the aboriginal Wik people over
more than 35,000 sq km of land covering its Weipa bauxite leases.
The company's share price fell by more more than 4 per cent in response to
concern about the claims, which ANZ McCaughan analyst Mr Ray Chantry said
put ADollars 1.83bn (Pounds 820m) of investment by Comalco in doubt. Mr
Keating's decision has 'dramatic ramifications in the mining industry', Mr
Chantry said.
The investment concerned covered an ADollars 750m planned purchase of the
Gladstone power station from the Queensland government, a ADollars 200m
upgrade of the power station and an Dollars 880m expansion of the Boyne
Island aluminium smelter in Gladstone. Mr John Ralph, Comalco's chairman,
has warned that lenders will not fund the expansion if they cannot be
guaranteed they will not suffer a loss.
Queensland's premier, Mr Wayne Goss, said that the Australian government had
to take action to protect Comalco's proposed investment.
Mr Chantry said it was hard to quantify the effect of the land claim on the
aluminium producer's earnings, adding that the stock was expensive in view
of the weak metal price.
He said Comalco shares had risen from ADollars 3.75 last week in response to
upgrades of European economic growth forecasts, which lifted most metal
producers' share prices.
Another analyst said he believed Comalco was reasonably priced in view of
the concern over the leases. 'The capitalisation of Comalco is at stake,' he
said, adding that the company's future was based on the Weipa bauxite
leases.
He said he believed Mr Ralph was serious in his warnings about the dangers
that the claim posed to the company's planned investment. 'There would be no
international financier willing to lend money when there's some concern
about the leases at Weipa,' the analyst said.
If the company lost access to the Weipa leases, it would have to find
another mineral source to supply its smelters, he said.
