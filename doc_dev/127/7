   Families of four aborigines who died in
police custody today denounced a government report on the deaths
that criticized police but stopped short of recommending criminal
charges.
   The report, issued Thursday, found no evidence of foul play in
the four deaths but said they probably could have been avoided.
   Judge James Muirhead was ordered by the government of Prime
Minister Bob Hawke in 1987 to investigate 44 aboriginal deaths
nationwide since 1980. Since the inquiry began, the number of deaths
has jumped to 107.
   Most of the offenders were arrested on minor charges such as
being drunk and disorderly.
   Alice Dixon, whose son, Kingsley, was found hanging in his cell
in Adelaide jail in 1987, wept when she heard the report.
   ``I expected some retribution. They're murdering our people, our
boys, and they're getting away with it,'' she said. ``My son is
dead, other sons are dead and other mothers are grieving and this is
the result we are going to get.''
   Leila Murray, whose 21-year-old son Eddie was found hanged in
1981, said: ``I've never believed police.'' She said the finding her
son took his own life ``shatters my faith in white justice.''
   Muirhead said police fabricated evidence and withheld evidence
during the inquiry's investigation of Murray's death.
   The judge concluded that proper custodial care and observance of
prison regulations could have prevented Dixon's death, and that the
death by heart attack of Charles Sidney Michael, 31, in 1984 might
have been avoided.
   Muirhead said the fourth death, that of John Clarence Highfold,
37, at Adelaide Jail in 1983 was from natural causes.
   Muirhead didn't say when another report on more deaths would be
released.
   The National Aboriginal and Islander Legal Service, which helped
pressure the government to investigate, criticized the inquiry.
   ``There is no message in there that says to police, `Stop if you
are killing people or if you all allowing aboriginals to die,'''
said service director Peter Coe.
   Australia's indigenous aborigines number about 160,000, or about
1 percent of the 16 million population.
