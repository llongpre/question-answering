THE SOUTHERN Cross hung between two gum trees just above my feet and
appeared so close that it looked more like part of a seafront illumination
than a distant constellation of stars. The feathery tops of the gums waved
darkly against the lighter sky but the skin-like bark of their trunks
gleamed silvery in the moonlight.
Bats fluttered overhead but there was no other sound along the dry bed of
Arkaba creek bed where I was swagging - sleeping under the stars in my swag,
a sleeping bag, pillow and mattress on a sheet of thick canvas. Rolled up,
the swag is the bushman's suitcase, indeed his home, and all his possessions
are packed inside and tightly strapped to keep out the dust.
Creek beds can be dangerous places. A flash flood will bring a wall of water
several feet high and carrying great logs and other debris thundering down
the water course. In January and February, though, the Flinders are very hot
and dry, so the danger comes from fire, not water. At this, the quiet time
of year, cooking fires are forbidden. Although a camp without a fire is a
featureless place the lack of other visitors more than made up for it, for
even in the national parks we hardly saw a soul.
The Flinders Ranges, a series of parallel rocky mountain ridges, lie to the
north of Adelaide, in South Australia, starting just below Wilmington and
running up to Arkaroola, becoming drier and more rugged as they go. About
halfway up is Wilpena Pound, South Australia's equivalent - for stunning
scenery - to Ayers Rock, in the Northern Territory, and located in the
200,000-acre Flinders Ranges National Park.
The Pound is remarkable - an enormous oval bowl surrounded by a high
sandstone ridge, precipitous on the outside but sloping gently down to a
level floor on the inside. The wall of rock is pierced in only one place, by
Wilpena Creek. When rainfall is high, the pound acts as a funnel. The amount
of water that hurtles down the creek is enormous, as the tumbled heaps of
great tree trunks confirmed.
We walked into the bowl and climbed the side past a deserted settlement
where a farmer once struggled to survive by growing wheat and raising stock.
He was forced to abandon the attempt. Part way up the rocky path, at Wangara
Lookout, we stopped. With the magnificent expanse of Wilpena Pound spread
below us, Cliff Coulthard, our Aboriginal guide, whose tribal lands cover
this area, shared with us the dreaming of his people, which explains the
formation of the northern ranges and the pound.
In a nutshell, two giant serpents, male and female, trapped and ate 600 of
his people who were gathered to carry out initiation rites. In surrounding
them, the snakes' bodies shifted the Earth's surface to form the walls of
the pound, which finally came to rest with the female's head raised as the
highest point, St Mary's Peak, and the male's head lowered, creating Arkaroo
Rock.
Sitting in the evening sunshine, with the emptiness of the bush around us,
it was not difficult to imagine the two huge snakes slithering round the
pound and looking over the rim at their captives.
These were not the only victims claimed by the pound. In more recent years a
local child was lost here and, in spite of intensive searches, only
discovered two years later after fire had cleared part of the area. His
bones, and the pathetic remains of his shirt tied vainly to a stick, were
all that were left. Fred Teague, a man of many parts and the coroner at the
time, told us the story when we stopped for a 'yack' (natter) at his Mobil
garage in Hawker.
In his adjoining shop Fred keeps a small but worthwhile collection of rocks,
illustrating the geology of the area, and of Aboriginal artefacts and those
of the white settlers who followed. At 80 Fred is a mine of information and
has done much to preserve the local Aboriginal rock art, which is
particularly rich.
The most dramatic is in a small cave at Arkaroo Rock to which we climbed in
the cool of an early morning. Cliff explained the symbols drawn by ancient
fingers in charcoal and red, yellow and white ochre mixed with emu fat to
preserve them.
The whole of the Flinders area has a distinctively harsh beauty, dry and
rocky with pale yellow grass and scattered trees, native pines and eucalypts
in various shades of green. The outcropping rocks give frowns to the rounded
buff hillocks while the outer ramparts of the pound appear towering and
precipitous. Occasional gorges, such as Bunyeroo, contain gently running
streams which are a welcome contrast to the aridity of the surrounding land.
The sparkling water and the thriving gums which grow there make these gorges
attractive places in which to linger.
During the uncomfortably hot time of the day the wildlife sensibly remains
in the shade of trees and rocks. Grey kangaroos sit in the semi-gloom and
emus flounce off at a reluctant long-limbed trot if disturbed from water,
their beaks partly open for the heat, the delicate feathers on their backs
bouncing airily at every step.
Morning and evening brought more activity - a pair of kangaroos boxing in
silhouette against the falling sun; a wedge-tailed eagle perched at the top
of Sliding Rock; bats hunting insects in the company of swallows as the
night shift took over from the day. A fox crossed the road in front of us.
Although the same size as British foxes, it looked much too small and
vulnerable to survive in this uncompromising land.
Cultural tours, such as Mick Irwin's Beyond Tours (1 Pony Ridge Road,
Belair, South Australia 5052, tel: 08-278-1264), with whom Michael Woods
travelled to the Flinders Ranges, are comparatively new and enable clients
to experience Outback life and obtain a much clearer appreciation of
Aboriginal lifestyles than was formerly possible.
