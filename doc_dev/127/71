   He has two families, two identities and
two homelands. He's also an ex-convict charged with the murder of
an interior decorator last Thanksgiving Eve.
   James Hudson Savage, or Russell Thomas Moore, 26, is from
Australia's bush country. He was taken from his teen-age mother
shortly after birth and adopted by a missionary couple who brought
him to the United States.
   Prosecutors allege that he robbed, raped and strangled Barbara
Ann Barber outside her Melbourne, Fla., shop Nov. 23, just 33 days
after his release from Florida's maximum-security state prison and
11 years after the first of his many brushes with the law.
   Savage-Moore's trial on charges of first-degree murder, sexual
battery and robbery was scheduled to begin today in circuit court
in Rockledge. Jury selection was expected to take about two days,
and opening arguments were expected to begin Wednesday.
   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty, while a defense
attorney, his biological mother and his adoptive parents all want
him returned to Australia, regardless of the trial's outcome.
   Beverley Moore Whyman, the defendant's mother, contends her son
was illegally taken from her 26 years ago under an Australian
program that allowed aborigine children to be removed from their
families and tribal homelands for adoption by whites.
   That government policy, which continued until the late 1960s,
resulted in a high rate of mortality, suicide, unemployment,
truancy, alcoholism, welfare-dependency and crime, aboriginal
activists contend.
   The baby called Russell Thomas Moore was adopted by a white
missionary couple, Graeme and Nesta Savage, in 1963 when he was 4
months old. His name was changed to James Hudson Savage, and at the
age of 7 he accompanied his adoptive parents when they came to
Melbourne, Fla.
   In his teens, James Hudson Savage turned to crime and became a
heavy user of drugs and alcohol and had explosions of violence and
sexually deviant behavior, according to police records.
   He served four prison sentences _ for car theft, burglary and
violent behavior in prison, including trying to kill a fellow
inmate and a guard.
   He tried to commit suicide and was committed to a psychiatric
facility at Florida State Prison. But he was freed under the
state's early-release program.
   A little over a month later, he was charged with raping and
strangling the interior designer in an alleyway outside her
showroom.
   The Savages said they were unable to find him in 1983 when they
moved back to Australia to continue their missionary work. His
biological mother heard nothing of him after he was taken from her
for adoption _ until after he was charged with murder.
   Money was raised by aboriginal activists in Australia so she
could come here and be reunited with her son. She and others have
been trying to persuade authorities to send him back to Australia,
even if he is convicted, so he won't have to face the death penalty.
   Savage's lawyer, George Turner, has refused comment on that
aspect of the case.
   Before the trial, Turner won approval from Circuit Judge
Lawrence Johnston to refer to his client as Russell Thomas Moore,
rather than Savage, because his last name might cause the jury to
think of him as ``an uncivilized primitive.''
   The judge ruled he would allow prosecutors to refer to him as
``Mr. Savage.''
   ``We are not going to mock his name,'' asserted Assistant State
Attorney Russ Bausch at a hearing on the issue last week.
