   An Australian who was adopted by
missionaries was convicted of murdering an interior decorator in a
case whose notoriety enabled him to be reunited with his biological
mother.
   James Hudson Savage, convicted Monday of first-degree murder,
robbery and sexual battery, could be sentenced to die in the
electric chair when the jury returns Dec. 11 for the penalty phase.
   Savage, 26, was adopted in Australia when he was 4 months old
and brought to America at age 7.
   His biological mother, Beverley Moore Whyman, who learned of his
whereabouts because of the case, contended he was wrongly taken
from her under a discontinued government program to turn aborigine
children over to white adoptive parents.
   ``They took my son away from me 26 years ago, and they just
killed me tonight,'' said the weeping Ms. Whyman. ``My son is
paying for his own mistakes and for the Australian government's
mistakes.''
   Two benches behind Ms. Whyman, Savage's adoptive mother, Nesta
Savage, wiped tears from her eyes and clung to her husband, Graeme,
as the verdict was read. The couple, who returned from missionary
work in Australia to attend the trial, refused comment.
   The Brevard County Circuit Court jury, which deliberated for
eight hours before announcing the verdicts, has the option of
recommending life in prison or death.
   Savage, who has a long criminal record in this country, was
accused of sexually assaulting and strangling Barbara Ann Barber of
Melbourne in an alley behind her interior design showroom on Nov.
23, 1988.
   His attorney, George Turner, acknowledged that Savage killed Ms.
Barber, but argued the charge should be reduced to second-degree
murder, which carries a maximum term of life imprisonment. Savage's
heavy use of crack reduced his culpability, argued Turner, who also
denied the defendant raped Ms. Barber.
   But Assistant State Attorney Russ Bausch said the murder
couldn't be blamed on drugs.
   ``I don't care if you are black, white, an American, an
Australian or an aborigine,'' Bausch said. ``No one has the right
to perform or commit the criminal actions James Savage committed on
Barbara Ann Barber last year.''
   Aboriginal activists in Australia _ who raised money to send Ms.
Savage to the trial _ want him returned to his homeland, where he
wouldn't face the death penalty.
   The Australian government hasn't decided if it will seek a role
in the penalty phase of the trial, said Australian Consul Ira
Lindeman, who attended the week-long trial.
   Before the trial, Judge Lawrence Johnston allowed a defense
motion that Savage be referred to as Russell Thomas Moore, his
birth name. Turner contended the name Savage might cause the jury
to think of ``an uncivilized primitive.''
   Savage has served four prison sentences for car theft, burglary
and violent behavior in prison, including trying to kill a fellow
inmate and a guard.
   Mrs. Barber's son, Bill, said the family was pleased by Monday's
verdict.
   ``Yes, I want him to get the electric chair,'' Barber said.
