THE Australian Labor party, in power for a decade, had expected defeat at
the March national election. But prime minister Paul Keating's surprise
victory gave Labor the chance to start a new era for both the party and
country.
Eight months after that startling comeback there are early signs that
Labour's new era will be a uninspiring period, in which government appears
bereft of fresh ideas and looks decidedly weary. It may also be a period in
which Mr Keating's forceful political persona and blustery performance in
parliament are tempered by forced compromises with opposition parties,
especially those which hold the balance of power in the senate.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, has already been forced into
humiliating horse-trading with minor Green and Democrat parties who hold the
balance of power in the Senate, and who were threatening to block
legislation needed to implement the federal government's budget, announced
in August. He was forced to back down on some of the budget measures after
the Labor Party caucus threatened to revolt and vote against the measures in
parliament.
Mr Dawkins, a driving force in the government's active reform programme
during the 1980s, vividly captured the party mood when he slumped at a press
conference announcing the third step of amendments to his budget, and
speculated openly about the attraction of political retirement.
Eventually, Mr Keating intervened, negotiating a deal with the minor parties
 -which offered them further concessions in exchange for passing the
revenue-raising bills. In the course of this messy process, the Labor party
was left trailing in popularity stakes, and Mr Keating suffered an all-time
low in leadership ratings.
One of the key problems for the Keating government is how to fix a stubborn
economy. A mild recovery has been underway during the last 12 months, but
the shaky foundation of world demand precludes a stronger trend.
Occasional sparks of economic good news have provided the much required
psychological boost. The annual rate of inflation was 2.2 per cent in the
three months to September, maintaining Australia's low inflation regime. The
September current account deficit of ADollars 1.1bn, seasonally adjusted,
was below market expectations, giving hopes that the Australian ADollars
18bn forecast in the budget might come in lower.
And there are a few bright spots such as the rapid growth in manufactured
exports, which have bolstered an impressive 19 per cent growth rate over the
past five years. But commodity prices remain depressed and the rural sector
remains stuck in the doldrums; domestic demand is still weak; and business
investment is at low ebb.
The government has attempted a mild fiscal stimulus by reversing its hard
won budget surpluses of the 1980s and running up budget deficits in the last
two years. The government's fiscal hand is constrained, however, by
continuing balance of payments deficits and external debts of more than
ADollars 160bn (Dollars 108bn), or over 40 per cent of GDP.
The 1993-94 budget debacle illustrated how tightly Mr Dawkins' hands were
tied by both fiscal and political constraints. While it was Mr Dawkins who
framed the document, he had to work within some untouchable parameters set
by Mr Keating, including the non-inclusion of tax measures that might be
construed as de facto goods and services tax, and the delivery of election
promises, especially income tax cuts. The personal tax cuts will cost the
government around ADollars 8.6bn between 1994 and 1996.
The budget was widely seen by the markets as fiscally responsible. It
allowed for a deficit of ADollars 16bn but included a programme to reduce
the deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1995-6.
But because it paid the price of election promises, it turned out to be
politically inept. It included several measures that raised small amounts of
revenue but at a high political cost - for example, a plan to remove public
health benefits for eye care which would have saved the government only
ADollars 48m, but received a massive outcry for its potential effect on low
income earners who might not be able to afford adequate care.
Other unpopular measures included a three cent excise on leaded petrol which
hit low income earners hardest, and a wine tax.
The events leading to Mr Dawkins' budget backdown also revealed a Labor
Party in serious disarray, with several members disillusioned by Mr
Keating's one-up-manship. When it looked like the minority Democrat and
Green parties were going to succeed in ramming through some budget changes,
the party's parliamentary caucus angrily demanded a meeting with Mr Keating
and Mr Dawkins. This overflowed with anger over the Treasurer's and the
prime minister's failure to consult on the budget in other major policy
issues.
After threatening a revolt in parliament against the budget the caucus
extracted an undertaking that Mr Keating in future would canvas opinion more
widely on major policies.
It was the first time that caucus and cabinet had asserted themselves since
Mr Keating wrested power from the previous Labor leader, Mr Bob Hawke, in
December 1991. Mr Keating had mesmerised the party with his uncanny ability
to pull a rabbit from the hat whenever the government's political fortunes
ran perilously low. This magic became even more powerful after his stunning
election victory in March. Caucus had accepted his unprecedented authority
while Cabinet largely stood by while he tackled policies only with his
closest personal advisers.
But morale sank significantly when the government's dramatic slide in the
popularity polls began. Shortly after the budget was handed down, support
for the goverment fell to 42.5 per cent on a two-party preferred basis,
compared with the opposition support of 57.5 per cent. The Morgan poll also
showed Mr Keating reaching an all-time leadership rating low of 24 per cent,
down two per cent.
In recent weeks, some ground has been regained. This has been partly due to
the resolution of the budget fiasco. But recovery in Keating's rating was
also helped by a breakthrough in the vexed issue of Aboriginal land rights.
Until last month, the goverment suffered the ire of several interested
parties for failing to produce satisfactory measures to protect their land
leases from possible Aboriginal claims.
After months of agonising and emotional debates, Mr Keating delivered,
literally overnight, a compromise package that, for the first time, seemed
to impress the Aborigines, mining companies and pastoralists, and state
governments.
The new proposals include a mechanism that would decide claims to native
title, another mechanism that would decide whether mining should proceed on
native-title land, and an option for Aboriginal groups to convert their
pastoral leases to another form of native title.
The land rights issue blew out last year after a High Court decision
recognising Aboriginal land title and overturning the doctrine of Terra
Nullius, which essentially held that the land was empty before British
settlement in 1778.
But even the land rights problem was marked by some clumsy handling at
first. Mr Keating had to back down from an earlier refusal to help Comalco,
the aluminium-producing subsidiary of the CRA Group, from Aboriginal claim
to its bauxite leases in the state of Queensland. The claim had jeopardised
Comalco's proposed ADollars 1.75bn aluminium smelter project.
Mr Keating had initially rejected the Queensland government's call for a
complementary federal-state government legislation to validate Comalco's
leases. A complementary federal legislation was required because the state
legislation alone might breach federal racial discrimination laws.
Mr Keating appeared to have refused to help only because the Queensland
government had placed the onus of responsibility on the federal government.
But after the threat of a another caucus revolt, Mr Keating turned around
and struck a deal with the state government to validate the company's
leases.
While the land rights issue has been handled adroitly in its latter stages,
the government has been far less convincing in its industrial relations
policy, one of the few areas where it could act to boost employment in the
medium term. The Labor party had earlier introduced enterprise bargaining
and begun to shift from centralised wage fixing. Both are essential to
breaking down the labour markets' rigidities and removing restrictive work
practices that have dogged productivity gains in Australian industry.
The industrial relations minister, Mr Laurie Brereton, however, faced
intense pressure from the powerful Australian Council of Trade Unions
(ACTU), when he proposed to open up enterprise bargaining to non unionists.
The ACTU's support for the Labor Party's economic programme was central to
its successful reforms during the 1980s and its political support was one of
the keys to the party's victory in the March election. The government has
since bowed to the ACTU's opposition, and scrapped plans to open enterprise
agreements to non-unionists. A bill introduced last week provides that
unions will be able to scrutinise but not veto non-union 'flexibility
agreements'. This has, however, angered employer groups who have called the
government backdown 'pathetic'.
There have been some lesser debacles, too. The government has mishandled the
introduction of subscription television and some seemingly pointless reforms
of its scientific and industrial research policies. All have compounded the
image of a government adrift and tinkering at the edges.
For some Australians, the debate over whether the country should become a
republic epitomises the paucity of real policies. Mr Keating has held aloft
the idea of breaking ties with the British crown and forging a future for
Australia enmeshed in the booming economies of Asia - essentially a 'vision'
of a new Australia.
This has certainly captured a great deal of attention. Mr Keating hopes to
declare a republic at the centenary of Australian federation in 2001. There
is a strong pro-monarchy opposition to his plan but he has found unexpected
support from some conservatives in the Liberal Party. Even the opposition
leader, John Hewson, refuses to oppose the republic outright.
But with unemployment still high at 10.9 per cent, many see the republic as
a diversion and the general electorate is desperately seeking economic
leadership. The government's failure to provide it has, at least
temporarily, enabled Dr Hewson to bounce back from the brink of political
ruin. But the danger now for Mr Hewson is that his coalition of conservative
parties may be sidelined as the main opposition group, with Mr Keating
preferring to court the minor parties in the crucial senate chamber.
The prime minister himself has been conspicuously absent during many of the
domestic debates. He has had several overseas trips, where he has
successfully shifted the focus to Australia's leading role in liberalised
trading in the Asia Pacific region.
While overseas, he has taken every opportunity to focus attention on the
republican issue. In his final speech to the International Olympic Committee
at Monte Carlo, Mr Keating linked the Sydney bid to Australia's push for a
new identity. 'Australia's transformation as a nation is marching side by
side with a transformation of the region of Asia, Oceania and the Pacific
Basin,' he told the Olympic Committee.
But in the political climate at home, Mr Keating's push seems rather hollow.
While he may well be on track to get popular support for a republic, it will
only happen if the Labor government remains in power long enough during the
1990s to set the nation on an irreversible path to a repub lic. His
government's current performance may make that unlikely.
