Thigh-deep in sea water, Harry struggled to hold his spear, which bucked in
his hands. Tracy heard him call and sprinted back to help, sand spurting as
he pounded along the beach.
Splashing into the sea, he plunged his three-pronged spear into the
underwater object and together, avoiding its flailing tail, the two
Aboriginals lifted the heavy, flapping stingray clear of the surface and
carried it to the beach where Harry disarmed it.
A graceful ripple ran round both sides of its flattened, kite-shaped body. A
second followed and then the fish lay still. It was left to collect when we
returned with a sack of grey-green mud crabs, each with its claws
unceremoniously torn off to stop it grabbing an unwary hand. This was good
bush tucker - wild food - for these Aboriginals, who have little regard for
the final moments of their quarry.
Harry and Tracy are Tiwi people who live on Bathurst and Melville,
neighbouring islands no more than 30 minutes by light aircraft to the north
of Darwin, in Australia's Northern Territory. Melville is the second largest
island off the Australian coast.
The Tiwis differ considerably from mainland Aboriginals, lacking their
shyness but also their didgeridoos and boomerangs. I spent a day learning
about their culture when I visited Nguiu, one of three main Tiwi
settlements.
The Tiwis have embraced Roman Catholicism only to the extent to which it
suits them. Their graves are surrounded by decorated totem poles, simply
carved and painted with patterns - spots, lines and dashes - in the
traditional red, white, ochre and black of Australian Aboriginal art.
To the disappointment of many visitors, few of the carved shapes and painted
patterns have any significance beyond a few simple details such as the sex
of the deceased. Most owe their shape and colours to the whim of the carver
and painter; the number of totems around the grave is an indication of the
status of the departed.
Michael, another Aboriginal, has lived on Bathurst Island for five years and
is now considered sufficiently part of the community to be asked to decorate
a pole for a burial. The Tiwis hedge their bets these days and have a mass
as well as a tribal burial ceremony. In addition to the collection of totem
poles, a white cross adorns each grave.
After a morning visiting church and museum, adult education centre and
screen printing works, we crossed the milky channel to Melville Island.
Michael drove me through an open forest of tall gums whose feathery foliage
cast little shade on the bright green ferny heads of primitive cycads
growing beneath. We were heading for Taracumbie Falls and lunch.
Later in the afternoon I flew to Garden Point, on the northernmost tip of
Melville, where I stayed in the closest thing to a safari camp I have found
outside Africa. While the surrounding bush may be benign, any thoughts of a
romantic stroll along a tropical beach at night were quickly banished for
fear of attack by salties - northern Australia's dreaded giant saltwater
crocodiles.
I was lulled to sleep by waves lapping the beach and woken before sunrise by
the vintage car-horn parp-parp calls of red-tailed cockatoos. I walked along
both the beach and the sandy access track before breakfast. The latter was
full of stories of the night. A dingo had come through the camp; lizards and
small mammals had hopped, skipped and trotted across the road; in two
places, sand swept into delicate swerves and curls and thrown into relief by
the low sun told where snakes had woven their way across. How I yearned for
an interpreter to read the signs for me.
Our Tiwi guides turned up after breakfast, knowing just what bush tucker
we'd be going after that day. While the ladies took half the group to
collect mussels in the mud, Tracy led a few of us foraging for meat in the
bush. Armed with a felling axe, a box of matches, a mirror and plenty of
water, we set off through the trees into areas previously burned by the
Tiwis. Like all Aboriginals, they use fire as a tool. It is estimated that
95 per cent of the Northern Territory is burned every year.
They have been firing the woods for so long - many thousands of years - that
the trees seem able to cope. Some grow special bark for protection, but only
as high as they need to; others require fire to germinate their seeds.
The bush is fired so often that there is no build-up of dead matter on the
ground and fires burn coolly and gently. Only when they catch a fallen log
do they smoulder for days, until a line of grey ash is all that remains.
Tracy used the mirror to direct the light of the sun into hollow logs to
look for animals inside. With the axe he broke into the bottom of a hollow
olibud trunk, cutting a hole which he filled with tinder-dry stringy bark.
Smoke curled out of several holes above our heads but no possum made a run
for it. He set fire to the dead lower branches of a pandannis palm in order
to drive out lurking snakes, but without effect. Finally he even felled a
hollow trunk, but it was empty. The shelves of the bush supermarket were
fresh out of tucker.
Had this been our only source of food we would have gone hungry but,
fortunately, the mussel-gatherers were a generous lot and shared their catch
with us. They were good - but no match for the crab of the previous day
which had had everyone, locals and visitors alike, crouched round the fire
picking delicious flesh from pink shells.
Michael Woods flew to Darwin with Qantas (tel: 0345-747 767) and was looked
after by the Australian Tourism Commission, which can provide details of
this and other tours (081-780 1424 for the free Travellers' Guide; 780 2227
