MR PAUL KEATING, the Australian prime minister, yesterday promoted six
backbenchers to the cabinet in a reshuffle designed to keep the Labor party
in government for the rest of the decade.
Mr Keating also moved several senior public servants and restructured a
number of departments in an attempt to distance the government from the
nine-year administration of Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister.
He said the reshuffle represented a 'generational change' which would renew
Labor's capacity to govern and prepare the party for the next election, due
by mid-1996.
In an unexpected move, Mr Keating took personal responsibility for
Aboriginal affairs at cabinet level, one of several non-economic portfolios
he has identified as priorities following Labor's election victory last
week.
The decision suggests that the government plans to accelerate attempts to
achieve reconciliation with Aborigines and to negotiate a compromise on
controversial land rights claims.
The other big surprise was the appointment of Senator Peter Cook, the former
industrial relations minister, as trade minister within the cabinet. Mr John
Kerin, the sacked former trade minister, was not a member of the cabinet.
Senator Gareth Evans remains foreign minister, with the added post of
government leader in the Senate.
The economic ministries are unchanged. Mr John Dawkins stays on as treasurer
and Mr Ralph Willis remains as finance minister.
In other moves, Mr Keating doubled cabinet representation of the health and
housing department, and created separate ministries for Pacific Island
affairs, schools and training, and regional affairs (within Australia). He
also streamlined the cabinet committee system, drawing criticism from
environmental groups angry about the abolition of the sustainable
development committee, which co-ordinated big development projects.
In the public service, Mr Ted Evans, Australia's chief representative at the
International Monetary Fund, becomes head of the Treasury, replacing Mr Tony
Cole, who is thought to have clashed with Mr Dawkins.
Mr Cole and four other department heads will move to other departments or to
overseas posts.
The most senior of the new members of the cabinet is Senator Graham
Richardson, a long-serving former minister who resigned last year after
allegations about his relationship with a businessman facing fraud charges.
The other new cabinet members are Mr Alan Griffiths, industry; Senator Bob
McMullan, arts; Mr Laurie Brereton, industrial relations; Mr Michael Lee,
tourism and resources; Mr Peter Baldwin, social security; Mr Duncan Kerr,
justice; and Mr Michael Lavarch, attorney-general.
Mr Baldwin and Mr Griffiths were formerly junior ministers.
