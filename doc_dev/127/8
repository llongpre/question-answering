THE AUSTRALIAN federal government has moved to dampen a heated national
debate over native land claims, granting some rights to aborigines over
mining leases but overriding claims to residential and pastoral land,
reports Reuter from Canberra.
Special minister of state Mr Frank Walker, leading negotiations on the
issue, said the cabinet decision should allay aborigines' concerns over
mining on native lands.
'The government has decided that we will give aboriginal people the same
rights as everyone else in the community, a right to negotiate and then if
that doesn't work a tribunal who'll arbitrate,' Mr Walker said in a radio
interview.
The issue has flared up in the past few months following land claims by
aborigines on the basis of a landmark 1992 high court ruling that their
native title to Australia had not been extinguished by white settlement in
1788. As a result aborigines theoretically can lay claim to vast parts of
Australia, including prospective mining areas.
Mining industry leaders criticised the ruling and warned that it threatened
foreign investment.
The Australian Bankers' Association yesterday called for an end to
uncertainty over land title, saying its members were reluctant to lend to
businesses in areas subject to claims.
The compromise does not give aborigines a veto over mining on native lands
but the right to negotiate and refer disputes to a new tribunal, government
officials confirmed. But the government could still override a tribunal
decision if it was not regarded to be in the public interest, they added.
Mr Walker said that mining companies whose leases on native land expired
would also have to negotiate with aborigines to renew them.
