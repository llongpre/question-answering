   A federal appeals court has cleared the way
for native Alaskans to sue the government in their bid to stop the
offshore oil drilling they contend is destroying traditional hunting
grounds.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday ruled that the
``aboriginal'' rights the natives held in the submerged land, part
of the Bering Sea, were not destroyed by the 1971 Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act, which provided money to resolve all natives'
pre-statehood claims of rights in Alaska land.
   The 3-0 ruling means several hundred natives from the villages of
Gambell and Stebbins can try to prove that drilling in the federally
approved Lease Sale 57, made up of 2.4 million acres off Norton
Sound off Alaska's western coast, would hurt their ability to fish
and hunt for survival needs.
   However, the judges left open the question of whether a 1953
federal law that authorized offshore oil and gas leases had affected
the natives' offshore claims. That issue was returned to a lower
court.
   The natives have sued the Interior Department, contending that
its sale of leases violated their legal rights of subsistence
hunting and fishing on undersea federal land, between Alaska's
three-mile offshore boundary and the 200-mile federal limit.
   Carol Daniel of Alaska Legal Services Corp. said the natives have
hunted and fished on the ice ``since time immemorial,'' building
roads and making camps on the ice several miles offshore to catch
fish, walrus and whales.
   ``The drilling is so dangerous to resources and my clients are so
dependent on the resources,'' said Daniel, attorney for the
villagers. ``They don't have access to the same grocery stores (most
people do). The sea is their market.''
   E. Edward Bruce, attorney for five oil companies that hold leases
in the area, said no decision has been made on whether to appeal the
ruling.
   He said oil companies paid over $300 million for leases in March
1983 and completed exploratory drilling several years ago, but had
not done any drilling for oil production.
   Bruce said he had not been told the results of the exploratory
drilling, but he observed that ``the results were not sufficiently
promising to cause further exploratory drilling in the area.''
   The federal government in other cases has recognized native
Americans' aboriginal rights to follow age-old practices of hunting
and fishing for necessities on government land.
