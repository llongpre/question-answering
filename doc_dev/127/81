WHILE Australia's politicians have been haggling about taxation on
Chardonnay wine, the din has all but drowned out an issue of far greater
national significance, writes Bruce Jacques.
The index of commodity prices to Australian producers, measured in Special
Drawing Rights terms, fell to its lowest level for at least seven years,
dragging the Australian currency briefly to its lowest point for six years.
The commodities slump, now entering its second half decade, has further
highlighted the vulnerability of the Australian economy to external forces.
As a world export leader in many key commodities including coal, iron ore,
gold, alumina, copper, lead and zinc, Australia has sensitive antennae to
world recession.
Yet the mining industry has again comfortably held its place as the
country's largest export earner. It has done so, however, only by producing
more for less, thus playing a big part in chasing world prices down.
The pattern was clearly indicated in a recent analysis from ABARE, the
Australian Government's commodity analysis body. ABARE calculated that the
weighted basket of Australia's commodity prices fell by 8 per cent in
1992-93 and predicted a further 3 per cent fall in the current year.
Yet the agency is also predicting that the value of Australian commodity
exports will rise by about 3 per cent to ADollars 49bn in the current year.
This is forecast to reflect a 2 per cent fall in rural exports, easily
offset by a 7 per cent lift to ADollars 31.8bn in mineral exports.
Australia's export growth in mining goes against all the world's leading
economic trends. Its counter-cyclical nature is perhaps most strikingly
demonstrated in relation to steel, still the pivotal metal for economic
growth.
ABARE forecasts that, in spite of the lower steel production in leading
economies, Australia's two best export performers this year will be in
steel's key raw materials, coal and iron ore. Coal exports are forecast to
rise 3.5 per cent to almost 133m tonnes, with revenue up 4 per cent to
ADollars 7.8bn. Iron ore exports are predicted to rise 2 per cent to 110m
tonnes, but earnings would fall 3 per cent to ADollars 2.9bn.
The incongruity of this export position has been the catalyst for a lively
debate on Australia's economic direction. The Federal Government is
championing a push to increase exports of manufactured products where world
prices are less influenced by consumer countries. Recent growth has been
impressive, especially in technology related areas.
According to figures from the Bureau of Industry Economics, manufactured
exports grew at an average annual rate of 12.5 per cent in the decade to
1992, or from ADollars 10.3bn to ADollars 33.4bn. This slightly exceeded
average annual growth in mining exports of 11.5 per cent and dwarfed
agricultural export growth of just 2.8 per cent. Even with manufactured
exports growing quickly, Australia will continue to be a price taker for a
large part of its total exports, but there are two strong pluses to the
scenario.
The first is the country's fortunate geographic location, affording natural
access to some of the world's big growth economies in Asia. Emerging Asian
economies account for the bulk of growth projected for Australian mining
products this decade.
The second, perhaps paradoxically, is the corrective effect of the world
commodity price slump on the value of the Australian currency. After
averaging around ADollars 1.43 against its US counterpart for 1992-93, the
Australian dollar was trading in late October at ADollars 1.50 against the
US dollar.
While this devaluation is causing problems in some areas of the economy, it
has been a handy cushion for Australian mining company earnings. Although
performances were mixed, and often marred by hefty write-offs, 1992-93 was a
year of overall recovery in Australian mining results. But much of it came
through cost-cutting.
Having thus battled hard to weather the commodity recession, Australian
mining companies moved towards 1994 facing another challenge. The industry
is in the thick of the controversy over native title brought on by the High
Court decision in mid-1992 in the so-called Mabo case.
As a major user of non-urban regions, the mining industry stands to be
heavily affected by Mabo, which could give Australia's Aboriginal people
title to large tracts of land. Confusion ruled late in 1993 on the likely
full effects of the Mabo decision as Federal and State governments moved to
pass competing legislation.
The main fallout for the mining industry is a new wave of uncertainty on
access to exploration and extractive sites. Some companies have reacted by
taking a hard line, few harder than the CRA subsidiary, Comalco. Late in
1993, the company threatened to ditch almost ADollars 2bn worth of expansion
if an Aboriginal claim over its bauxite leases at Weipa in northern
Queensland was not quickly settled.
The immediate impasse was resolved through Federal Government intervention
to validate Comalco's leases. But the piecemeal nature of the resolution to
what is a pervasive national problem has given mining companies little
reason for confidence.
