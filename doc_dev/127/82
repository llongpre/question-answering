For the Australian mining industry the much feared 'era of Mabo' has begun
without interrupting the long-standing trend of steadily increased
production and export revenue.
Mabo is the popular tag given to a watershed High Court decision given
legislative effect late in 1993 through the Native Title Bill. The Bill,
which broadly gives Australia's Aboriginal people title to large tracts of
the country, had drawn dire predictions from the mining lobby, mainly
reflecting concerns about exploration and development access.
However, in 1993-4, the industry has again overcome weak world demand,
historically low prices for many key commodities and unfavourable exchange
rate movements marginally to lift export revenue to almost ADollars 30bn,
accounting for better than 35 per cent of the country's total export
receipts.
Figures from ABARE, the Federal Government's commodities research arm, show
that Australia's mineral exports have risen in all but one year of the past
decade. The latest total represents more than double the country's then
record ADollars 14.9bn mineral exports in 1986.
While this performance justifies the industry's world leader status,
demonstrating its inherent strength and diversity, closer inspection reveals
some weak spots which threaten to reduce momentum later this decade.
The industry acknowledges that the effects on production and revenues may
not be felt for some years, given the lead times involved in major projects.
But mining executives see Mabo as part of a long term pattern of adversity
which includes the rise of environmental issues, compensation claims from
landowners, unfavourable tax treatment and vexatious litigation.
Mr Geoffrey Ewing, of the Australian Mining Industry Council (AMIC), says
the mining industry has long been a leader in negotiating with Aboriginal
communities. 'Our argument is not with the concept of native title, but with
the way the Bill produces an unwieldy system for exploration and development
access,' Mr Ewing said.
'Any real influence on production and exports is obviously some years off.
In fact, our annual financial survey, due out later this year, will probably
show a lift in exploration spending in the latest year. But our information
is that the spending is mainly on what could be described as 'brownfields',
sites which are free of any native title claims.'
The Australian mineral industry's overall performance in the latest year was
also distorted by near boom conditions in one commodity - gold - where
export value rose by more than 26 per cent to ADollars 5.42bn, masking some
serious declines in other commodities.
Gold's resurgence echoes its historical position as one of the main
populators of fledgling antipodean colonies more than a century ago. The
metal's more recent Australian history is scarcely less important to
national fortunes.
From a position of decline in the 1970s, when many of the country's biggest
mines faced closure and annual output ran at less than three tonnes,
Australian gold production has rallied close to 250 tonnes in the current
year, ranking it third in the world after South Africa and the US.
And new projects already under way mean that production will keep rising
strongly, barring a collapse in the all-too-volatile gold price. Mr Robin
Widdup, gold analyst with J. B. Were &amp; Son, the Australian stockbrokers,
told the Financial Times World Gold Conference in June that Australia's
annual gold production was likely to top 300 tonnes by the turn of the
century.
Vigorous exploration and new mine development has transformed the gold
industry from the 1980s picture of short life, shallow oxide open pits, to
large long life mines in the 1990s,' Mr Widdup said. 'The 1990s Australian
gold rush has seen geologists, armed with new geochemical and geophysical
techniques, unearth a series of large new gold discoveries beneath sand
cover.
'This breakthrough in technology has lifted exploration expenditure  .. and
the rate of success shows no sign of slowing. A group of 10 to 15 new mines
should lift Australian production by 40 to 50 tonnes over the next five
years.'
If gold fulfils these expectations, it could replace coal as Australia's
number one export earner around the turn of the century. Gold's export jump
in the latest year compared with a corresponding 5 per cent fall to just
under ADollars 7.2bn for coal.
Several other major Australian minerals recorded solid export revenue gains
in 1993-94, including aluminium, up 5 per cent to ADollars 1.82bn and iron,
steel and ferroalloys, up 22 per cent to ADollars 1.4bn. But zinc exports
fell 22 per cent to ADollars 795m.
Sticking to a familiar pattern, Australia's higher overall export receipts
were achieved despite markedly lower average commodity prices received.
ABARE's mineral export price index slumped from 99.7 to 91.9 over the year
while the index of mine production rose from 105.2 to 107.
Australia is, quite simply, continuing to sell more minerals for less money.
The financial performance of its leading commodities companies remains
volatile. It's a habit that will prove hard to kick while the industry
remains a price taker, hostage to a small local market and heavily exposed
to the vagaries of international trade.
