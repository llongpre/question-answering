Paul Keating, Australia's acid-tongued prime minister, was in fine fettle
yesterday as he took parliamentary questions on his plans to remove the
Union Jack from the Australian flag. Facing a sea of Australian flags
patriotically planted on opposition MPs' desks, Keating labelled his critics
'lickspittlers, crawlers, and snivellers to forces abroad'  - an
uncharacteristically elliptical reference to Britain.
The exchanges marked a new phase in Keating's nationalist campaign, which is
intended to present the opposition conservatives as latter-day colonials.
For the first time, Keating promised to produce detailed proposals for a
replacement flag, although there is no agreement, even within the governing
Labor Party, on what it should look like.
Strangely, there seems to be little support for the most obvious choice  -
replacing the Union Jack with the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag.
That would imply recognition of 50,000 years of Aborigine history, and might
help Labor in its stated aim of reaching an accord with the descendants of
the continent's original inhabitants.
But perhaps Keating thinks it might not win many votes.
