THE AUSTRALIAN mining industry, which last week expressed qualified backing
for the federal government's 'Mabo' Aboriginal land rights legislation,
yesterday sounded a less optimistic note, saying that the package could
discourage investment and might fail to validate all previous land titles as
the commonwealth had promised.
Mr Geoff Ewing, the Australian Mining Industry Council's assistant director,
said yesterday it was 'not apparent from the details so far available that
all past titles will be fully secured, and therefore not affected by native
title as the prime minister stated'.
'The proposals for the approval of future grants still leave open the
possibility of both the commonwealth and states each being involved in the
process, and the time limits for completion of the process have been
significantly extended,' he added.
'It also appears at this stage that consideration of native title, which
could take as long as 20 months, will have to precede other approval
processes which themselves take a considerable time.'
The draft legislation has yet to be unveiled and all commentators are at
present basing opinions on the public statements made by Mr Paul Keating,
the prime minister, and other government officials. Last week, it appeared
that Mr Keating had scored a political triumph by hammering out a land
rights package that had at least qualified support from most interested
parties.
The need for legislation has been pressing in the wake of a high court
decision last year that did away with the notion that Australia was
uninhabited before European settlement. It said that native title claims
could succeed where there had been close and continuing association with the
land in question.
