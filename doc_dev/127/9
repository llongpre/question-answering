<HEAD>Aborigines Attack Report Saying Prison No Deterrent For Them</HEAD>

   An Aborigine group today branded as
racist and ridiculous an official report saying their people
receive better care in prison than at home and do not see
incarceration as a deterrent.
   The Queensland Corrective Services Commission said in a report
Tuesday night to the state parliament that prison provided better
housing, education, medical and recreational facilities than most
aborigine prisoners experience outside.
   ``Tragically they do not see it as a deterrent,'' State Justice
Minister Glenn Milliner said.
   The report said aborigines and another group of Australia
natives, the Torres Strait Islanders, comprise 20 percent of prison
inmates in Queensland state, but only 2.6 percent of the population.
   The Queensland Aboriginal Legal Service called the findings
racist and ridiculous. The legal service's vice-chairman, Steve
Mam, said the vast majority of Aborigines and Islanders would be
``horrified'' if charged with a criminal offense, let alone sent to
prison.
   ``Most prisoners come out of jail having learned only about
violence and brutality,'' he said in a statement.
   Aborigines have been living in Australia for at least 40,000
years and today number about 160,000, or less than 1 percent of the
total population.
   Keith Hamburger, director general of the Corrective Services
Commission, said Australian society has to confront the social
crisis facing Aborigines and Islanders.
   ``There is no doubt that if the community as a whole would face
up to its responsibility to solve the awful social crisis facing
this much-maligned and disadvantaged, yet potentially talented
ethnic minority, there would be immense social benefits to our
society as a whole,'' he said.
   The Department of Aboriginal Affairs said Aborigines have a life
expectancy 20 years less than other Australians and an unemployment
rate six times the national average.
   The government has said that 100 aborigines have died in police
custody since 1980.
