uranium debate back to the surface - The issue could be raised from the
floor at the ruling Labor Party's conference in Hobart next week

Could Australia be about to relax its constraint on uranium mining, which
limits production to three mine sites?
The question has arisen with the approach of the ruling Australian Labor
Party's impending national conference in Hobart, Tasmania, next week.
Uranium policy is not on the formal agenda but there is a real possibility
that uranium supporters will raise the issue from the floor, to urge
modifications.
Over recent weeks, intense background lobbying has been under way. On the
mining side, the Uranium Producers Group has commissioned Access Economics,
a forecasting and consultancy organisation, to assess the implications of
expanding the industry. Environmentalists, by contrast, have taken to the
streets, demonstrating outside state ALP headquarters and warning of voter
defections to minor parties if the rules do shift. Aboriginal
representatives have also been voicing their case, both in the Northern
Territory and in Canberra.
Australia's current uranium policy dates back to the early 1980s, when the
ALP moved away from its stated aim of banning uranium mining altogether and
endorsed a new mine at Roxby Downs, in South Australia, where uranium was to
be produced alongside copper and other metals. The party came to power the
following year.
After some internal battles, the 'three mines policy' evolved. Essentially,
this limits uranium production to the Ranger mine in the Northern Territory,
operated by Energy Resources of Australia (which, in turn, is controlled by
North Broken Hill Peko); Roxby Downs/Olympic Dam, which is now wholly-owned
by Western Mining Corporation; and at Nabarlek, in Queensland.
However, Nabarlek has been worked out, and finished the processing and
exporting of stockpiled ore in 1990. This, advocates of a more permissive
approach argue, means that the 'three mines' policy has become a nonsense.
Australia, they point out, has about 30 per cent of the western world's
low-cost uranium reserves, yet produces only about 10 per cent of western
output. This contrasts sharply with Canada's share of 40 per cent, derived
from only about 18 per cent of reserves.
In its study, Access Economics estimates that output from known deposits
could almost double the country's production during the next 10 years if the
'three mines policy' were abandoned. Australia, it predicts, could come to
account for 30 per cent of western output by 2004.
Such expansion would have two favourable consequences. Firstly, export
earnings would rise significantly, from ADollars 120.2m (56m) - excluding
government stockpile sales - in 1994, to ADollars 752.6m - in 1994 price
terms - in a decade's time. Secondly, the economic benefits would accrue
mainly to Western Australia and the Northern Territory. (The deposits most
likely to be assessed in the event of a change in ALP policy are North
Ranger/Jabiluka in the NT; WMC's Yeelirrie in WA; Kintyre, also in WA and
owned by CRA; and Koongarra in the NT.)
'The value of NT uranium exports in 1994 prices would be over ADollars 450m
in 2004, or equal to more than 10 per cent of the current total output of
the NT,' the Access report suggests.
Anti-nuclear campaigners see things very differently. Greenpeace, the
environmental group, has countered with its own report, which argues that
Australia's bilateral trade agreements give 'advance generic consent' for
plutonium to be separated from Australian-sourced uranium and used or
stockpiled in pre-approved facilities, and that government assurances that
Australian-sourced uranium and plutonium will be used for peaceful purposes
cannot be guaranteed. Accident risks, it adds, may not be so far away.
The report raises the possibility that Australian uranium may eventually be
sold to Indonesia, which despite its considerable coal reserves, seems
anxious to build a number of nuclear power reactors.
Expanding trade and diplomatic relations with Indonesia is a key element in
the Keating government's effort to forge a meaningful role in the
Asia-Pacific region. But Greenpeace argues: 'The site of the first of these
proposed reactors is in an area of high seismic activity, increasing the
risk of an accident that could spread radioactive contamination over much of
South-east Asia, including Australia.'
Meanwhile, Australia's indigenous community appears to be divided on the
issue. Any development of large Koongarra deposit in the Northern Territory
 -jointly owned by Canada's Denison and Cogema, the French nuclear fuels
agency - would allow the 'traditional owners' of the mine site to earn a
significant economic interest in the project.
Accordingly, some members of the Northern Land Council, which represents
aboriginal interests in the region, have urged a relaxation of the current
three mines policy. But it is unclear whether this stance is representative
of opinion within the broader indigenous community: 'The majority of people
have not been given the opportunity or the information to make an informed
opinion on whether we do or do not want uranium mining,' Mr John
Christopherson, an executive member of the NLC from West Arnham Land, said
in Canberra this week.
In the midst of the ideological debate, the commercial considerations are
sometimes overlooked. There is currently an oversupply situation in the
uranium market, and spot prices, which stood at more than USDollars 40 a
pound in the late 1970s, have fallen to a quarter of that level. The Access
report suggests that excess commercial inventories will disappear by the end
of this decade, although it admits that estimates of when this might happen
differ, and that western governments will be loathe to become too dependant
on non-western supplies.
Other analysts tend to agree - although they also warn that the timing is
hard to predict. 'If you're asking will it be economic to expand production,
the answer is probably yes,' comments one analyst at Sydney-based AME
Mineral Economics, for example. 'If the three-mines policy was removed, it
wouldn't be 'open-go', but there are two or three ore bodies which would be
reviewed, with companies looking to long-term contracts.'
Finally, there is the question of whether the issue will be raised at all.
Any debate would come towards the end of next week's conference, and in the
factional wheeling and dealing that goes on, uranium policy could yet fall
by the wayside. Public opinion polls suggest that Australians tend to
support the retention of a 'three mines' policy - although not by a vast
margin - so the domestic political advantage in unleashing the issue may not
be high.
