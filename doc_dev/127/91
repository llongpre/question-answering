SO FAR FROM SKYE by Judith O'Neill Hamish Hamilton Pounds 8.99, 204 pages
THE GUYANESE poet John Agard once called the interior of his own country 'a
hinterland of wonder'. What he was trying to express by that evocative turn
of phrase was the imaginative implications of having been born in a place
that consists of a narrow coastal littoral, relatively easily and quickly
tamed by all the marvellous resources that human beings seem to have at
their disposal and, at its back, an untamed and inhospitable interior -
rainforest, mountains, impenetrable jungle.
Agard would argue that such contrasting physical features are an imaginative
resource whose value and importance to the writer are inestimable. All he or
she knows is that it is there, within and without, that other world at one's
back, just as surely as those forces of unreason that make war upon our own
sense of order and propriety, just as certainly as the id is locked in
perpetual combat with the superego.
Australia is such another place, a world where the sophisticated society of
Sydney rubs shoulders with a timeless Aboriginal heritage, and that friction
has helped to nurture a crop of remarkable children's novelists over the
past 30 years.
These include Ivan Southall, known for his compelling and often
intellectually demanding adventure stories set in the Australian outback;
Patricia Wrightson, whose books have included successful experiments in
science fiction and fantasy; and, among a younger generation of authors,
Judith O'Neill, whose novels for older readers have included Deepwater, the
story of a young girl growing up in a small, tightly-knit community that is
riven by jealousy.
All these writers show an awareness of that fruitful imaginative tension
between outback and coast; between the claims of the Aboriginal and the
often rapacious demands of the civilising settler.
In Judith O'Neill's case, the story is given an extra twist by the fact that
her great-great-grandfather, a shepherd and crofter, originally came from
the Isle of Skye, and emigrated with his family to the new Colony of
Victoria in 1852. This is the seed from which her new historical novel, So
Far From Skye, a fictional account of the dispossession of the hundreds of
Gaelic-speaking families that were obliged to emigrate to Australia in the
1850s, has grown.
To the people themselves, the terrible sequence of calamities in those years
must have seemed like a re-enactment of the Book of Job itself: the blight
(which destroyed the potato crop); famine; cholera; and then the Highland
clearances themselves.
The book centres on the fate of the crofter Donald MacDonald (the name of
Judith O'Neill's own relative) from Taliskar, an upright, God-fearing man of
the Free Church, and his young family, but we experience it mainly through
the eyes of Morag, his courageous and resourceful 13-year-old daughter.
First comes the terrible walk to Portree, with the father carrying his
beloved foot-plough and, at his waist, a pouch of black earth from his
native village as a talisman. The ship itself, the Georgiana, is to sail
from Greenock, and it is there that the family comes upon and adopts the
ailing baby of a long-lost cousin who is dying of consumption.
On board ship, they are presented with gifts from the Emigration Society - a
suit of warm clothes, a Gaelic song book and, most important of all, a large
pair of black scissors for shearing off waist-long beards and tangled mops
of filthy hair. The message is simple: the savages are to be humanised,
first by the crudest of physical means, and later by teaching them the
Queen's own English.
The three-month voyage is a terrible experience: days of unbearable sickness
in which the families lie curled in their cramped berths, gripped by the
twin miseries of leaving home and fear of the sea. The captain, a relatively
enlightened man, recommends dancing as a cure for melancholia. Towards the
journeys' end the mood is lightened by an all-night ceilidh in which the old
tales are retold and Alec Matheson rouses the party to a frenzy by scraping
on his fiddle.
Morag is astonished to arrive on a balmy October spring day, with the air
full of the scent of eucalyptus. This is not the soft, misty beauty of her
own beloved Skye but a starker beauty, all brilliant colours and strong
light. The final tragedy occurs when the families are divided up as if they
were the spoils of war, but at the novel's close the Donald MacDonalds are
beginning to refind a sense of themselves in their new home, and Morag
discovers in Kal-Kal an Aboriginal friend with whom she has much in common -
a strange language; old, compelling stories; and a terrible tale of
dispossession . . .
The historical novel, whether written for adults or children, has a poor
reputation for improbable dialogue, stuffed with ridiculously anachronistic
speech, inauthentic details, an unacceptable level of violence done to
historical truth. Judith O'Neill has made no attempt to reproduce the quaint
speech of her forebears. She has researched her material thoroughly and
shaped it into a plain, convincing narrative that all good readers of ten
and above will find both absorbing and highly enjoyable.
