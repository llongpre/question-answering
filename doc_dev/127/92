There will be no immediate relaxation of Australia's constraints on uranium
mining, and the issue has been referred to the ruling Australian Labour
Party's national executive for consideration in three years' time.
The sidestep, which was agreed yesterday at the ALP's national conference in
Hobart, follows a week of uncertainly as advocates of a more liberal uranium
policy sought to secure support for the opening of new mines.
The ALP has a long-standing policy of restricting uranium mining to three
sites. However, one of these mines is now worked out, and a second is
approaching exhaustion. This situation, coupled with the desire of some
Aborigine representatives to see uranium mining expanded in the Northern
Territory, led to serious speculation that a change in policy could be
agreed.
Throughout the week, it had been touch-and-go whether pro-mining supporters
could raise enough votes from delegates to the conference. On Wednesday
night, many political commentators thought they had achieved the objective,
although any new mine would have been bound to employ union labour - a
condition designed to penalise CRA, the Australian mining group, which has
been seeking to employ workers on individual staff contracts.
Yesterday morning, however, a number of Victorian and Queensland delegates
shifted in favour of the status quo. Last night, Mr Brian Ede, the Northern
Territory opposition leader who had pushing hard for a change, estimated
that - had the matter gone to a vote - 48 delegates would have been in
favour of a change, compared with 54 against.
Australia is reckoned to have about 30 per cent of the western world's
low-cost uranium reserves but produces only about 10 per cent of the western
world's supply. The two projects that are operating under the three-mines
policy are Olympic Dam, owned by Western Mining Corporation, and Ranger,
belonging to Energy Resources of Australia.
Had policy been relaxed, projects most likely to go ahead would have
included Koongarra and North Ranger/Jabiluka, both in Northern Territory.
However, given the current low level of uranium prices, analysts believed
that most mining companies would have been in no rush to open up new mines,
although they added that there was a fair chance that additional projects
would have come on stream over the next decade.
Last night, ERA said it was extremely disappointed at the ALP's decision to
retain the status quo. It said that, in conjunction with Aborigine owners,
it would approach the government between conferences and continue to push
for the development of new ore bodies.
'In the interim, ERA will continue to develop its existing deposits on the
Ranger lease as the market recovers. However, this may mean that we will
have to supplement our production with overseas purchases if we experience
production limits in a buoyant market,' it commented.
