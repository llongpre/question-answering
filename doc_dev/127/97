WESTERN AUSTRALIA'S new coalition government would act quickly to clear-up
the issue of security of land title which was becoming a growing problem for
the mining industry following a series of federal legal court decisions,
including the so-called Mabo high court decision, said Mr Richard Court, the
state's prime minister, yesterday, writes Kenneth Gooding in Kalgoorlie.
During an unscheduled visit to the Australian Gold Conference here Mr Court
said the Mabo case resulted in the high court identifying for the first time
aboriginal native title in Australia.
'The decision has suddenly raised questions of ownership over large
stretches of Crown land, particularly in the Northern Territory, South
Australia and here in Western Australia. In industries that thrive on
certainty, it has created some uncertainties.'
Mr Court said it might be claimed that proper compensation had not been paid
for land on which title had been given since 1975. 'We could end up with
decades of legal disputes which would drive investors away.'
He had set-up a top-level cabinet sub-committee of ministers directly
affected to investigate every aspect of the Mabo case and to liaise with the
federal government and other states.
It might be necessary to legislate to protect landowners but this should be
done at federal level - 'we want one law for all of Australia'.
Mr Court suggested that, as a last resort, if the uncertainty continued too
long, it might be necessary to resort to a referendum to amend the federal
constitution.
