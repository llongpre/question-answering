"Touring New Zealand" (Questar Video, 70 minutes, 1989) is best suited for the 
armchair traveler, although it's helpful for early travel planning. 
</P>
<P>
Russell, in the Bay of Islands on the northern tip of North Island, was the 
first capital of New Zealand. Here the film visits the Treaty House in 
Waitangi, where the 1840 treaty between the British and Maoris was signed; the 
shipwreck museum, Kemp House, Rewa's Maori Village and the Cape Reinga 
Lighthouse. Side trips are to the Waipoua Kauri Forest and a drive along 
90-Mile Beach. 
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, is known as the "city of sails" because 
one in every four households owns a yacht. Shown are views of the city skyline, 
the aquarium and activities along New Zealand's longest river, the Waikato. 
</P>
<P>
In the central area of North Island, the camera shows Cambridge, a town that 
mirrors the British influence, and the Waitomo Caves, with their glowworm 
grotto. 
</P>
<P>
Viewers also are shown the thermal area of Rotorua, with its spewing geysers 
and boiling mud pools, the Maori Arts and Crafts Institute and the buried 
village, which was destroyed by lava from the Tarawera volcano in 1886. 
</P>
<P>
Sheep shearing and trout fishing in the Lake Taupo area are part of the film, 
as are Tongariro National Park; Gisborne, where Capt. Cook landed; Napier, 
which was destroyed by a 1931 earthquake; Hawke's Bay wineries, and Mt. Egmont. 
</P>
<P>
Wellington, which is similar to San Francisco with its charming old buildings, 
hills and harbor, lies at the southern tip of North Island and is the country's 
capital. From Wellington, the ferry travels across Cook Strait to Picton on 
South Island. 
</P>
<P>
Between Picton and Christchurch, there's a visit to the old mining towns of 
Shantytown and Mitchell's Gully; Hikitika, a small town noted for its jade, and 
Kaikoura, an old whaling center. 
</P>
<P>
A Christchurch tour includes Cathedral Square, many of the beautiful gardens 
and the Canterbury Museum. Brief visits to Akaroa, an early French settlement, 
Mt. Cook National Park and the Tasman Glacier, and Westland National Park, with 
its unusual ice sculptures, also are included. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to Queenstown includes 54-mile Lake Wakatipu, the ghost town of 
Arrowtown and Lake Hayes, in addition to Haast Pass, Mt. Aspiring National Park 
and Lake Wanaka. 
</P>
<P>
Magnificent fiordland and the spectacular scenery of Lake Te Anau, the Milford 
Track, Milford Sound and Sutherland Falls is shown at the end. 
</P>

"Australia" (Rand McNally VideoTrips, Best Films and Video Corp., 50 minutes, 
1988) is a well-photographed whirlwind tour of five Australian cities, along 
with brief scenes of the Outback and Tasmania. 
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, the camera hits such landmarks as the harbor bridge and opera house 
and also visits St. James Church, the Australian Museum of Aboriginal Art, Hyde 
Park, the Argyle Arts Center and the Queen Victoria Building mall. 
</P>
<P>
Stops are made at shops in the restored Rocks area; in the King's Cross 
district with its restaurants, discos and strip joints, and in Paddington, an 
upscale neighborhood for Sydney yuppies. 
</P>
<P>
Circular Quay and the Taronga Park Zoo, plus views of the Bondi and Manly 
beaches, also are included. 
</P>
<P>
The British influence is apparent in Melbourne, a center of finance, fashion 
and theater. Stops include the city's Golden Mile, stock exchange, jail museum 
and railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
Chinatown, the Victoria outdoor market and the cultural complex at the Victoria 
Arts Center on the Yarra River are shown, as are the Royal Botanic, Queen 
Victoria and Fitzroy gardens.

the city center, the South Australian Museum of Aboriginal Art, the botanical 
gardens and festival center.

center along St. George's Terrace, the London Court shopping arcade and King's 
Park. In Fremantle, the video pauses at the Fremantle and Maritime museums.

In the Queensland area, the video visits Cairns for game fishing, the Great 
Barrier Reef, and the resort facilities on Hamilton Island.

look at Tasmania, and a roundup of travel information on car rentals, weather, 
visas, currency and some hotel hints.
