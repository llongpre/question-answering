Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, said yesterday Australia's
federal parliament would continue to sit for as long as necessary to debate
the highly-contentious 'native title' bill, which sets up a system for
dealing with land claims by aborigines and Torres Strait islanders.
The Australian parliament was meant to rise last week but recovened
yesterday in an effort to debate the legislation and deal with over 200
proposed amendments before Christmas.
Opposition leaders and interest groups such as the mining industry, which
are fighting the legislation, have urged either that it be scrapped or that
the matter at least be reconsidered in the new year.
Mr Keating said yesterday that 'If we have to sit here until Christmas Eve
and come back on Boxing Day and keep going, we will, because we're going to
see the senate vote on this bill'.
He added that the government was justified in seeking to have the bill
passed this year, in the light of the extensive consultation process that
had already taken place.
