   The Suzuki Samurai, a popular sport utility
vehicle, tends to roll over in sudden turns and should be banned,
the publishers of Consumer Reports magazine said Thursday.
   ``That car literally trips over its own feet, and I wouldn't
want to be in it,'' said R. David Pittle, technical director of the
non-profit Consumers Union, which publishes the monthly magazine.
   In an article scheduled to appear in its July issue, Consumer
Reports labels the Japanese-made Samurai ``not acceptable'' _ the
first time it has given such a rating to a car in 10 years.
   American Suzuki Motor Corp., based in Brea, Calif., defended its
vehicle.
   ``The Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety, including
stability and handling, prior to its introduction into the United
States,'' said Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of
American Suzuki Motor Corp.
   ``We have absolute confidence that we are selling a safe and
stable vehicle,'' he said Thursday.
   Consumers Union filed a petition with the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration asking that the agency change its
regulations to ban the Samurai, which the petition called ``wholly
unsuitable for consumer use.''
   A similar petition alleging the Samurai's rollover problem was
filed in February by the Center for Auto Safety, a non-profit,
Washington-based consumer group. The government has yet to act on
that petition.
   Both petitions demand that a stability standard for vehicles
that would let the government ban any car that has an undue
propensity to roll over.
   Consumers Union said the Samurai is the first car out of 349
tested in the last decade to roll over during a routine
accident-avoidance test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid
an obstacle in the road.
   At a news conference, Consumers Union officials showed a
videotape in which the Samurai lurched onto two wheels and began to
roll over when it suddenly changed lanes at just under 40 mph.
   The car did not roll onto its side because it had been equipped
with arm-like extensions to avoid a rollover. Pittle said the
extensions actually improved the car's stability by lowering its
center of gravity.
   The Samurai's major competitors, the Jeep Wrangler, the Jeep
Cherokee and the Isuzu Trooper, were shown making the same maneuver
without losing stability at speeds over 40 mph.
   ``We are not surprised that professional drivers can cause the
Samurai or other motor vehicles to roll over,'' Mazza said. ``But
the real results of the Samurai safety is proven on American roads
everyday.''
   Between November 1985, when the Samurai was introduced, and the
end of April 1988 there have been 154,675 Samurais sold in the
United States. The cars have a suggested retail price of about
$8,500.
   According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
there have been 44 reported Samurai rollovers involving 53 injuries
and 16 deaths.
   NHTSA spokesman Ron DeFore said he could not comment on whether
the Suzuki has a higher rollover rate than its competitors, but
said utility vehicles generally have a fatality rate three times
that of light-duty vehicles, such as small pickups, and that
rollovers account for two-thirds of the fatalities in utility
vehicles.
   DeFore said drivers of utility vehicles such as the Samurai tend
to be younger and more adventurous than the average driver of a
passenger car, and therefore are more prone to accidents.
   In its statement, Suzuki said that in all of the accidental
deaths involving the car, police found that serious driver errors
led to the accidents.
   The company also said it believes the attacks on the Samurai may
have been triggered in part by trial lawyers seeking to foster
public opinion against Suzuki and perhaps the entire sport vehicle
industry.
   Suzuki also said it believes it has been targeted because the
Samurai is the leading imported sport utility vehicle from Japan
and has gained tremendous media attention because of its uniqueness
and affordability.
   The company said it would continue trying to determine the
original source of allegations against the vehicle and why the
company is being singled out. It will then consider legal action,
it said.
   The most famous vehicle rollovers involved the Jeep CJ5 and CJ7,
which the Wrangler superseded in 1986. Chrysler Corp., which bought
American Motors Corp. in August, inherited liability for lawsuits
seeking nearly $1.1 billion in damages caused by Jeep rollovers.
