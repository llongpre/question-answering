   Struggling Suzuki Motor Co. is trying to rebound by introducing two new vehicles this fall, including a new Jeep-like model aimed at keeping the young buyers the company is in danger of losing. 

   The new Suzuki Swift subcompact car and Suzuki Sidekick sport utility vehicle will leave the Japanese manufacturer far less dependent on the four-wheel-drive Samurai model. 
That sport utility vehicle has been Suzuki's sole model since entering the U.S. in 1985, and its sales plunged in June following charges that the Samurai is unsafe and tends to roll over in sharp turns. 

   Suzuki's U.S. sales and marketing arm will continue to sell the Samurai in the U.S. during the 1989 model year. 
But company officials say Samurai supplies will be far lower, with just 2,000 Samurais a month coming from Japan at least through April. 
Suzuki used to sell 6,000 to 7,000 Samurais a month last year, and sold a record 12,208 in August. 
That was after Suzuki instituted deep discounts and aggressive advertising to counter critics and bring buyers back to showrooms. 
Earlier this month, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration refused to order a recall of the Samurai, saying it is no more unsafe than any Jeep-like vehicle. 

   But now the company's marketing attention is shifting completely away from the Samurai in favor of the two new vehicles. 
Suzuki officials say they will spend $11 million in advertising by year end to launch the Swift and the Sidekick. 
By April, Suzuki expects to ship 20,000 of the cars and 30,000 of the sport-utility vehicles to the U.S. 

   Versions of both vehicles will be imported by General Motors Corp. for its new Geo line. 
But Suzuki limited GM's version of the Swift to a three-cylinder engine while giving its own models a more-powerful four-cylinder engine. 
Also, availability of GM's version of the Sidekick will be limited to a few states. 

   The looks of the Sidekick and Samurai are similar, although Suzuki increased the wheelbase of the Sidekick by nearly seven inches -- a move that's expected to add stability. 
The pricing of the two vehicles also will be close. 
The Sidekick's base price is $8,995, compared with the Samurai's $8,495 base price. 

   Suzuki officials insist the two will attract different buyers. 
"There are still people out there that want a Samurai and not a Sidekick," said Jim Weber, communications director for American Suzuki Motor Corp. "I've got to think a lot of that is utilitarian, or for uniqueness."
