   A consumer group's accusation that the sporty
Suzuki Samurai is prone to roll over was denounced Thursday by the
Japanese automaker as ``inaccurate and defamatory.''
   Test results announced last week by Consumers Union, the New
York publisher of Consumer Reports Magazine, unfairly suggest the
popular four-wheel drive vehicle is unsafe under normal driving
conditions, said Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of
American Suzuki Motor Corp.
   ``If the magazine had acted responsibly and reviewed the
available information it would have been aware that the Samurai has
one of the best records on file,'' Mazza said.
   Last week the influential consumer organization condemned the
Samurai as being so prone to roll over that it cannot be modified
to be safe. Consumers Union recommended a omplete recall of the
120,000 or more Samurais sold in America and a complete refund to
owners.
   Responding to the accusations made by Suzuki in news conferences
in Los Angeles, New York and Detroit, Consumers Union spokesman
David Berliner defended the organization's tests as valid. He said
similar vehicles made by competitors passed the same tests that
caused the Samurai to tip over.
   Government accident statistics and tests conducted by an
independent automotive safety consultant showed the Samurai was as
safe or safer than other sport-utility vehicles, Mazza said. That
industry term refers to four-wheel drive cars and light pick-up
trucks.
   Samurai is considering legal action against Consumers Union,
Mazza said. He suggested the consumer group made its accusations as
part of a calculated campaign to persuade the government to adopt
stricter rollover standards.
   ``For years the Consumers Union has been pressing the government
for an unrealistic rollover standard,'' Mazza said. ``What better
way than pressing the smallest Japanese automaker with the No. 1
selling sport-utility vehicle?''
