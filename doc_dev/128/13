<HEAD>Samurai Sales Hit Record In August Despite Rollover Concerns</HEAD>

   Boosted by rebates that could cut the sticker
price by almost 25 percent, U.S. sales of the Suzuki Samurai set a
record in August despite concerns about the four-wheel-drive
vehicle's safety.
   Official sales figures will not be reported until Tuesday, but
Douglas Mazza, general manager of Suzuki's automotive division,
said Friday he hoped the total would exceed 10,000 for the month.
   The surprising turnaround appears to be the result of the
generous dealer incentive program by the Japanese carmaker and
fading public concern about the rollover issue raised by Consumers
Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine.
   ``It will clearly be a record for our company, which is
impressive for 80 to 90 days from when our accuser first came at
us,'' Mazza said.
   Sales plummeted 70.6 percent in June to 2,199 after the June 2
report by Consumers Union. The group said the Suzuki Samurai's
center of gravity was too high, making it too likely to tip over
when the driver swerved sharply.
   American Suzuki produced its own tests and statistical evidence
to back its claim the Samurai was safe, and on July 13 announced
$2,000 incentives to dealers that made it possible for them to cut
a quarter of the Samurai's $7,995 base price.
   Samurai sales rose to 6,327 in July, about average.
   Sales from Aug. 1 through Friday, which is the end of the latest
reporting period, will smash the record of 8,365 set in July 1987,
said Laura Segall, of the public relations firm Rogers &amp;
Associates, Suzuki's public relations agency.
   The dealer incentive program ended Friday, and the company and
its competitors will be watching closely to see whether the sales
momentum continues.
   Suzuki had been counting on a rebound in Samurai sales to create
a good atmosphere for the introduction this fall of two new
vehicles: a bigger, more powerful, more expensive sport-utility
vehicle named the Sidekick, and a passenger car named the Swift.
   The Sidekick is scheduled to be introduced this month. The Swift
will be introduced in October in a two-door hatchback version and
in November in a four-door hatchback model.
   The Samurai received a boost Thursday when the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration turned down petitions to investigate
and recall the vehicle. The agency said the Samurai is no more
dangerous than similar vehicles made by other companies.
   The agency did grant a Consumers Union request to start a
rule-making procedure to establish a minimum standard for vehicles
to protect against rollovers.
   The Transportation Department agency said it had found 113
reported rollovers involving the Samurai and related vehicles made
by Suzuki, which resulted in 25 deaths and 120 injuries. But the
agency attributed many of the rollovers to unsafe driving, drinking
and unfamiliarity with the vehicles.
   American Suzuki, based in Brea, Calif., is the U.S. arm of
Japan's Suzuki Motor Co.
