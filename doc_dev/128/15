   The Suzuki Samurai is so unstable it ``literally
trips over its own feet'' and rolls over, says the publisher of
Consumer Reports, which gave the popular sport vehicle its first
``not acceptable'' rating in 10 years.
   But the American Suzuki Motor Corp. defended the Japanese-built
Samurai as safe and said there was no justification for the
magazine publisher's claim that it should be banned because it
tends to turn over in sudden turns.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said Thursday
the Samurai is too short, too narrow, too light and has too high a
center of gravity to be safe. It asked federal regulators to recall
the more than 150,000 Samurais sold in this country and provide
refunds to owners.
   Consumers Union called the four-wheel-drive sport utility
vehicle ``wholly unsuitable for consumer use'' in a petition filed
with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
   ``That car literally trips over its own feet, and I wouldn't
want to be in it,'' said R. David Pittle, technical director of
Consumers Union, at a news conference. ``They're promoted as safe,
fun vehicles, when the fact of the matter is, they're not.''
   Consumers Union said the $8,500 Samurai was the first car out of
349 tested in the last decade to roll over during a routine
accident-avoidance test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid
an obstacle in the road.
   Consumers Union officials showed a videotape in which the
Samurai lurched onto two wheels and began to roll over when it
suddenly changed lanes at just under 40 mph. Arm-like extensions
installed to protect the test drivers prevented the car from
rolling onto its side.
   The Samurai's major competitors, the Jeep Wrangler, the Jeep
Cherokee and the Isuzu Trooper, were shown making the same maneuver
without losing stability at speeds higher than 40 mph.
   It was 10 years ago that Consumer Reports labeled the Dodge
Omni-Plymouth Horizon models ``not acceptable,'' saying they had a
dangerous steering problem. The problem was corrected the next
model year, the magazine said.
   ``We were thinking of turning it over to our older son. Now we
won't do that,'' said Edward Taylor, 41, of Cleveland Heights,
Ohio, who owns a convertible Samurai.
   ``You're driving down the road at 65 mph and a cat or dog jumps
out in front of you, you have to find out how good a driver you
are. It's something I'm not looking forward to,'' he said.
   Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of American
Suzuki, said, ``We have absolute confidence that we are selling a
safe and stable vehicle.''
   The company said the Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety,
stability and handling before it was introduced in the United
States in November 1985. Suzuki sold 154,675 of them through April.
   ``We are not surprised that professional drivers can cause the
Samurai or other motor vehicles to roll over,'' Mazza said. ``But
the real results of the Samurai safety is proven on American roads
every day.''
   The petition from Consumers Union asked that the government
require similar vehicles to pass driving tests rather than just
meet design standards.
   The Center for Auto Safety filed a similar petition in February,
citing the Samurai's rollover problem. The center said the Samurai
had been involved in at least 32 rollover accidents, resulting in
eight deaths and 35 injuries.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said there
have been 44 reported incidents of Samurais rolling over, involving
53 injuries and 16 deaths. A spokesman for the agency, Ron DeFore,
would not comment on the Consumers Union petition. The agency has
120 days to respond.
   The company says police found serious driver error in all of the
fatal accidents.
   DeFore said he could not comment on whether the Suzuki has a
higher rollover rate than its competitors. He said utility vehicles
in general have a fatality rate that is three times that of
light-duty vehicles, such as small pickups, and that rollovers
account for two-thirds of the fatalities in utility vehicles.
   DeFore said drivers of utility vehicles tend to be younger and
more adventurous than the average driver, and are more prone to
accidents.
   Details of the tests are in a report to be published in the July
issue of Consumer Reports.
