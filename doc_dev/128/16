   Suzuki of America Automotive Corp. said it increased by 7% the price of its 1987 Samurai sport utility vehicles, the company's only automotive product in the U.S. 

   The unit of Suzuki Motor Co. of Japan said the new suggested retail price for hardtop and convertible Samurai models is $7,495, up from $6,995, effective immediately. 
"We have worked very hard to hold down the cost of the Samurai during the severe period of dollar devaluation," said N. Douglas Mazza, Suzuki's vice president and general manager. 
"We find now we have reached a point where a price increase is unavoidable." 

   Despite the increase, Suzuki said it still had the lowest-price offering in the increasingly competitive sport-utility vehicle market. 

   Several other Japanese auto makers -- including Honda Motor Co., Mazda Motors Corp. and Mitsubishi Motor Corp. -- have announced price increases this year because the of sharp rise in the yen's value.
