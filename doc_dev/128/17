   The U.S. Customs Service will continue to allow Japanese-made sport utility vehicles without back seats and passenger "amenities" to enter this country as trucks. 

   The decision resolves, for the time being, a controversy that began last fall, when Los Angeles customs officials proposed reclassifying as cars the popular Jeep-like models, which include Suzuki Samurai, Mitsubishi Montero and Isuzu Trooper. 
This would have restricted their importation because a Japanese government quota limits U.S. car shipments to about 2.3 million a year. 

   The move represents at least a temporary setback for Rep. John D. Dingell (D. 
Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who initiated the debate. 
Concerned because manufacturers and dealers often installed back seats and other passenger-related equipment after the vehicles cleared customs as trucks, Mr. Dingell asked the Customs Service to determine whether the Japanese companies were intentionally circumventing the quota. 
Truck shipments aren't restricted, but face a 25% U.S. duty compared with the 2.5% duty on cars. 

   Customs Commissioner William von Raab acknowledged that the decision "seems illogical . . . when people see how these vehicles are being used." 
Their versatility and the availability of such carlike features as stereo radio, air conditioning, plush seats and carpeting boosted sales to nearly 200,000 last year. 

   But Mr. von Raab said in a statement that current law "provides very little room for discretion. . . . 
Customs must classify vehicles in their condition as imported." 

   He said in order to "clear up the confusion over classification criteria, the Customs Service will be asking for public comment in the near future" on how to "simplify" the classification process. 
Possible solutions could include a new category for sport utility vehicles, or changes in the existing criteria to emphasize the way the vehicles are used rather than their condition as imported. 
Such changes could take months as the Customs Service collects and considers the comments. 

   Mr. Dingell's response was sharp and immediate. 
"We don't like illogical decisions any more than Commissioner von Raab . . . but the Customs Service announcement makes it look like they are bowing to the Japanese firms who are trying to circumvent the Voluntary Restraint Agreement's requirements." 

   Not surprisingly, the U.S. sales arms of Mitsubishi Motors Corp., Suzuki Motor Co., and Isuzu Motors Ltd. disagreed. 
All had asked the Customs Service to reconsider the Los Angeles district office's proposal to reclassify the vehicles. 

   "We're very happy with the way this came out," said Munford Page Hall II, an attorney with Dorsey &amp; Whitney in Washington, D.C., representing Suzuki of America Automotive Corp. 
"It's what we expected," added Richard D. Recchia, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America Inc. 
"We know we did not incorporate any substantial changes into the (current) vehicles" that would have made them different from the models customs officials originally agreed were trucks. 

   As for the prospect that the classification might change in the future, the companies all said they will have to wait and see what the Customs Service decides. 
In the meantime, "our position is that we're just going to continue as is," said E.F. Kern, vice president of marketing for American Isuzu Motors Inc.
