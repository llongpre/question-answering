   Sales of Suzuki Motor Co.'s Samurai plunged 70.5% in June, following charges by Consumers Union that the four-wheel-drive sport-utility vehicle is unsafe. 

   The whopping monthly sales decline was the worst that Suzuki has posted since it first introduced the Samurai to the U.S. in November 1985. 
The poor sales also left many Suzuki dealers uncertain about the vehicle's future, even though several said sales improved somewhat in recent days. 

   Suzuki, which sells only the Samurai in the U.S., reported June sales dropped to 2,199 vehicles from the 7,479 it sold a year earlier. 
Suzuki sold 6,074 Samurai vehicles in May, before Consumers Union published in its Consumer Reports magazine an article saying the Samurai has a "dangerous propensity" to roll over when its driver attempts to make a sharp turn. 

   Suzuki's U.S. officials offered little comment yesterday on the steep sales decline, in an apparent attempt to play down the bad news. 
In a news release, the company said it "was not surprised by the drop in sales . . . because of the widespread negative publicity on the Samurai." 

   Suzuki dealers said they hope the company moves quickly to attract buyers back into showrooms. 
"This whole situation is frustrating because I have no control over it," said Tom Lilly, general manager of George Ballas Suzuki in Toledo, Ohio. 
"Whatever Suzuki comes out with couldn't hurt at this point." 

   Some dealers may take matters into their own hands. 
Mr. Lilly's dealership, for example, is weighing giving Samurai buyers free life-insurance policies. 
Others are flooding their local television broadcasts with press releases and advertising that stresses the quality and safety of the vehicles. 

   Dealers also are trying to talk upbeat. 
Although Dick Smith Suzuki in Kansas City, Mo., sold only 17 Samurais in June, general manager Phil Smith expects to sell about 30 in July and 40 in August. 
"As time progresses, the furor tends to get out of people's minds," Mr. Smith said. 
"People may be more inquisitive now, but at least they're coming in the doors again." 

   Since the appearance of the Consumer Reports article, Suzuki officials have hinted that the company may sue its critics. 
But company officials and dealers said they needed to wait and assess the damage to sales. 

   Such damage was evident yesterday, but a Suzuki spokesman said the company still hasn't made any decision about legal action or any other moves, such as increased advertising or buyer incentives. 
Suzuki did increase its advertising immediately after Consumer Reports published its article in its July issue and changed its theme to safety from fun. 
Attorneys general from several states have begun investigations to determine whether that advertising is deceptive.
