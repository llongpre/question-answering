  [Text] Washington, 22 Apr (XINHUA) -- Former U.S. 
President Richard Nixon died of a major stroke at 2108 (EST) 
today at New York Hospital Cornell Medical Center at the age of 
81, reports reaching here said. 
  Nixon suffered a major stroke at his New Jersey home at 
around supper time on April 18, and he was soon rushed to the 
hospital. 
  Beginning Thursday [21 April] afternoon, Nixon lapsed into a 
very deep coma. 
  The life-long Republican was born in California on 9 January 
1913 and was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives 
in 1946 and to the U.S. Senate in 1950. He was elected vice 
president as running-mate to Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 
re-elected vice president in 1956. 
  In 1968, Nixon was elected president of the United States 
over Democrat Hubert Humphrey and independent George Wallace and 
on 20 January 1969, he was sworn in as the 37th president of the 
country. 
  In November 1972 he was re-elected U.S. president until 9 
August 1974, when he was forced to resign in culmination of the 
Watergate scandal, thus becoming the only president in U.S. 
history to resign to avoid impeachment. 
  The former U.S. leader visited China in February 1972 and at 
the end of his visit, the Chinese and U.S. Governments issued 
the famous "Shanghai Communique," opening the door to Sino-U.S. 
exchanges. He later visited China five more times as an old 
friend of the Chinese people. 
  Beginning this evening, flags in the capital Washington and 
the rest of the United States will fly at half-mast for 30 days 
to mourn Nixon's death.
