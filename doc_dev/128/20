   Christian Dior-New York said its president, Colombe Nicholas, resigned "for personal reasons." 

   No successor was named. 
Ms. Nicholas couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Ms. Nicholas, an attorney who has 10 years of retail experience and speaks fluent French, made headlines in 1980 when she beat out other male candidates to become the head of U.S. operations for the French design company. 
Under her reign, Christian Dior expanded its U.S. licenses to 48 from 32 and tripled annual revenue to about $420 million. 

   The 43-year-old Ms. Nicholas was credited with helping to jazz up Dior's staid image, notably with the help of the racy "three Diors" -- a woman and two men -- print ads in the early 1980s. 
She was currently involved in getting Dior's first U.S. boutique launched on New York's Upper East Side by the end of the year. 

   In leaving Dior, Ms. Nicholas also resigned from her management responsibilities for French designer Christian Lacroix in the U.S. 
Both Dior and Lacroix are controlled by a French-based conglomerate, Financiere Agache.
