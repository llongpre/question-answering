   Congress should reinstate the president's power
to impound appropriated money as a way of bringing the federal
budget deficit under control, former President Gerald Ford said
Monday.
   ``The budget process is in total shambles,'' Ford said in a
speech at the National Press Club.
   The power of impoundment was ended in 1974, when Congress moved
to streamline the budget process.
   Using impoundment, a president could sign an appropriations bill
yet refuse to spend part of the money in what Ford called ``an
important tool of fiscal responsibility.''
   ``The anti-impoundment provisions in my opinion have been a
disaster,'' Ford said. The present system is ``no substitute for
strong action by the president of the United States,'' he said.
   ``If we are irresponsible, if we blow it, there is no doubt in my
mind that we are gambling with the health and security of the United
States,'' he said.
   Allowing presidents to impound money would be a quick solution to
the present budget difficulties, since reinstating the process would
require only legislation rather than a constitutional amendment,
Ford said.
   Ford on Monday unveiled his portrait at the Smithsonian
Institution's Hall of the Presidents, the first presidential
portrait painted explicitly for the collection.
   The portrait shows Ford dressed in a dark, pin-striped suit,
standing in a half-length pose, his right hand on his hip. It was
painted by Everett Raymond Kinstler.
   It will be on permanent exhibit in the Hall of the Presidents,
which shows likenesses of every president from George Washington to
Ronald Reagan.
   Ford was the House Republican leader when he was appointed vice
president in 1973 after Spiro Agnew resigned from the office.
   Ford became president the next year with the resignation of
Richard Nixon, thus becoming the first U.S. president that had never
won a national election.
   The portrait was painted after Ford left office in 1980. It was a
gift of the Gerald R. Ford Foundation of Grand Rapids, Mich., which
operates a museum and library dedicated to Ford's term in office.
   Kinstler painted the official White House portraits of both Nixon
and Ford.
