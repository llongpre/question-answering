   Micron Technology Inc. said Juan Benitez, president, chief operating officer and a director, and Leslie Gill, chief financial officer, resigned for personal reasons. 

   But though both executives of the Boise, Idaho-based microchip maker insisted it's just time to move on, their departures raised several questions among observers of the closely watched company, questions Micron officials refused to answer yesterday. 

   For example, it remains unclear why the two officers quit simultaneously. 
Ms. Gill called it a "coincidence." 
It also remains a mystery why the pair decided to resign just when Micron has returned to healthy profitability after two years of heavy losses. 
And nobody could say what the two executives will do next, including Mr. Benitez and Ms. Gill, who said they don't have new jobs but don't plan to retire. 

   "I prefer not to make any further comments at this particular time because I want the focus to be on the transition" to Micron's next president, said Mr. Benitez, 39 years old, who declined to answer questions about his departure. 

   Micron named Randal Chance, 37, executive vice president and a director, to succeed Mr. Benitez as president and chief operating officer. 
The company named Reid Langrill, 28, to Ms. Gill's posts as chief financial officer, treasurer and vice president, finance. 
Mr. Langrill had been controller. 

   Micron named James Garrett to succeed Mr. Chance as executive vice president. 
Mr. Garrett had been vice president, sales and marketing. 

   When asked if Micron had requested her resignation, Ms. Gill, 33, responded: "This may sound arrogant, but Micron has been called a lot of things and one of them isn't dumb." 

   Both resigning officers joined Micron at its infancy in 1980, and rose to senior positions within a year. 
They resigned their posts effective yesterday, but will remain with the company through the fall to assist their successors. 

   The timing of the two executives' departures surprised some observers, given Micron's robust turnaround of late. 
The company, which specializes in commodity memory chips, has been a major beneficiary of the U.S.-Japan semiconductor trade agreement signed in 1986. 
That agreement, meant to stop alleged dumping of Japanese chips, imposed floor prices on certain Japanese memory chips sold in the U.S. market. 

   In fiscal 1988's first nine months, ended June 2, Micron had net income of $54.7 million, or $1.88 a share, compared with a loss of $24.4 million a year earlier. 
Revenue tripled to $187 million from $61.7 million.
