<HEAD>Carmaker Settles Dispute With 7 States, Will Have Safety Messages</HEAD>

   American Suzuki Motor Corp. said today it has
agreed to put safety warnings in advertising for its
four-wheel-drive Samurai to settle a dispute with the attorneys
general of seven states.
   The company said the messages _ which warn against abrupt
maneuvers in the so-called ``sport utility vehicles'' _ are to be
included in all ads and promotional material.
   The dispute with the top law enforcement officials of California,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Texas and Washington
stems from a controversy that erupted in June over a consumer
group's allegation the sporty cars were likely to roll over.
   The attorneys general had accused the company of violating laws
against false and deceptive advertising.
   Suzuki has heatedly disputed the allegations by Consumers Union,
the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, and the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration in September denied a petition to
order a safety recall.
   The agreement requires the Japanese carmaker to include in its
ads the following statement: ``This vehicle handles differently from
ordinary passenger cars. Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns
and abrupt maneuvers. Always wear your seat belt. For specific
details, please read your owner's manual.''
   The company also agreed to reimburse the states $200,000 for
legal costs.
   American Suzuki, the U.S. arm of the Japanese automaker, noted
the company hadn't acknowledged any safety problems with the cars.
   ``For Suzuki and Samurai owners, this agreement with the
attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false
allegations about the Samurai,'' N. Douglas Mazza, the company's
vice president and general manager, said in a news release from
American Suzuki's Brea, Calif. offices.
   Consumers Union tests found that because of its short wheelbase
and high center of gravity, the Samurai is dangerously prone to roll
over under what the consumer group maintained are normal driving
conditions.
   Suzuki officials have said the car, classified for import as a
``sport utility vehicle,'' handles no differently than other
four-wheel-drive cars made in the United States and elsewhere.
