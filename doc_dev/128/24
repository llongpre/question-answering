   Suzuki Motor Co. has resurrected stark advertisements emphasizing the safety of its Samurai sport utility vehicle in the wake of criticism from Consumer Reports magazine that the Samurai is unsafe. 

   Suzuki hopes the ads, which started running on television Thursday night, will quell consumer concerns about the Samurai. 
However, Suzuki dealers said it is too soon for them to judge the effect on consumers of the magazine's criticism, disclosed in a Thursday morning news conference. 

   Saturday customer traffic at Earnhardt Suzuki in Tempe, Ariz., for example, was off about 60% from normal, said Dave Steinbrook, sales manager. 
He said some of that could be due to other factors, but there wasn't any question that the Consumer Reports criticism "took its toll . . . 
Today, I can do business one-handed and I usually need four arms." 

   Suzuki of America Automotive Corp., Suzuki's U.S. sales arm, first developed its somber ads in March after the Center for Auto Safety in Washington, D.C., claimed that the vehicle's high center of gravity makes it prone to rolling over. 
But Suzuki dropped the ads, which featured laudatory quotes from car-enthusiast magazines, about a month ago in favor of the light, fun approach of its original ad campaign. 

   The fun disappeared a few hours after Consumer Reports said its driving tests showed the Samurai has a "hazardous propensity" to roll over in emergency driving situations. 
Consumers Union of U.S. Inc., which publishes the magazine, said it supports a recall of the 150,000 Samurai models currently on the road and also called on Suzuki to buy them back from owners. 

   The magazine's news conference caught Suzuki by surprise. 
Ron Rogers, a Suzuki spokesman, said the company learned about the event only 12 hours in advance. 
Suzuki dashed off a mailgram warning dealers about the expected negative publicity and telling them "that we stand behind this vehicle 100%," Mr. Rogers said. 

   Suzuki officials reiterated an earlier promise to aggressively refute critics, and possibly sue them. 
But Mr. Rogers declined to say specifically if legal action is likely against Consumer Reports. 
"We think the Consumer Reports study was unfair and inconsistent," he said. 
"We are going to take a very aggressive stance on this through any means available to us." 

   Defending Samurai's reputation is crucial to Suzuki because Samurai and Suzuki motorcycles are the mainstays of the Japanese company's U.S. business. 
Samurai sales through late May were down about 19% from last year's levels, partly because of concerns about the possible rollover problem. 

   Dealers say they're worried that the latest round of criticism will damp sales further, but they add that it's too soon to tell by how much. 
"We had five people scheduled to pick up the vehicles they had purchased" last week, said Tom Lilly, general manager of George Ballas Suzuki in Toledo, Ohio. 
"All picked their vehicles up; no one said anything about the report." 

   But dealers say some prospective customers clearly are worried about the safety issue. 
Some past customers also are concerned. 
Dick Brahs, general manager of Stillman Suzuki in Englewood, N.J., said he had received "quite a few calls" from owners on Friday, wondering whether Suzuki will recall the Samurai or buy the vehicles back. 
"There's just some long-term concern there."
