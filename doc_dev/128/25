Suzuki has hit the road for a new advertising agency. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese auto maker, which has still not recovered from year-old safety 
concerns over its Samurai sport utility vehicles, said on Thursday that it was 
placing its estimated $15 million to $30 million advertising business up for 
grabs. 
</P>
<P>
Suzuki sales have nose-dived since last June when Consumer Reports harshly 
condemned the Samurai as being prone to roll-overs and asked for a recall of 
all Samurai vehicles. The federal government later found that the Samurai was 
no worse than the average utility vehicle in its class. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of recalling its vehicles, however, the Japanese importer is recalling 
its Los Angeles ad agency, Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. The agency has created Suzuki 
ads -- such as billboards with the headline, "A Cure for the Car Sick" -- since 
Brea-based American Suzuki Motor Corp. began importing the vehicles into the 
United States four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"When Suzuki first entered the U.S, it looked for an ad firm without automotive 
experience so they could bring a fresh perspective," said Laura Segal, a 
spokeswoman for Suzuki. "But Suzuki is changing and expanding its product line, 
and that may require something different." 
</P>
<P>
Although Keye/Donna was asked to participate in the review, the agency has not 
responded to that request. "We want to take a few days to think about it," said 
Leonard Pearlstein, president of Keye/Donna/Pearlstein. "I can tell you, we 
were surprised by their decision." 
</P>
<P>
It is not all that unusual, however, for troubled businesses to blame their ad 
agencies for their problems. And Suzuki has plenty of them. Sales of its 
Samurai dropped nearly 89% in the first quarter of 1989, compared to the first 
quarter 1988. That's 1,914 Samurais sold during the period this year, compared 
to 16,783 during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
Several ad industry executives said they now expect that beleaguered Suzuki 
will name a new agency by mid-summer. 
</P>
<P>
"Suzuki's problems are much larger than their ad agency," said Peter Stranger, 
president of the Los Angeles office of Della Femina, McNamee WCRS, which 
creates the "Joe Isuzu" ads for American Isuzu Motors Corp. "To punish the ad 
agency for this is ludicrous."
