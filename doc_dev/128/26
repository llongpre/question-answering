   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration turned down petitions to investigate and recall the Suzuki Samurai, contending that the four-wheel-drive sports vehicle isn't any more dangerous than similar vehicles made by other manufacturers. 

   The Suzuki Motor Co. vehicle has been mired in controversy since Consumer Reports magazine this spring called the vehicle unsafe and urged it be recalled. 
The Transportation Department agency said it had found 113 reported rollovers involving the Samurai and related vehicles made by Suzuki, which involved 25 deaths and 120 injuries. 
But the agency attributed many of rollovers to risky driving habits, drinking and unfamiliarity with the vehicles. 

   Suzuki officials said the NHTSA ruling was a major victory and should "put to rest the inaccurate and misleading attacks on the vehicle." 

   A statement prepared by the company's outside public relations firm said "the company is particularly pleased that the unfounded and inaccurate accusations about the Samurai made by so-called consumer groups did not color NHTSA's judgment on this matter." 

   The agency said the Samurai was involved in about six rollovers per 100,000 cars in which the rollovers weren't caused by crashes. 
That was about one-third the rollover rate of the Ford Motor Co. Bronco II, the agency said. 
The Samurai also had the same rollover rate as General Motors Corp.'s Chevy S10 Blazer, the agency reported. 
Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep Cherokee had a rollover rate about half that of the Samurai, according to the agency. 

   The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer group, filed one of the petitions to recall the Samurai. 
A spokeswoman for the group said it would appeal the agency's ruling. 

   The agency did grant a petition by Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, requesting that the agency start a rule-making procedure to establish a "minimum standard" to protect against rollover. 
In a letter to Consumers Union, the agency cited a number of research projects it already has started concerning the rollover problem. 

   A Consumers Union spokeswoman applauded the action on the rule-making petition but criticized the agency for not launching an investigation into whether the Samurai was defective. 
She said the group still considered the vehicle "dangerous when doing maneuvers that any driver could be called upon to perform." 
For instance, she said tests by Consumers Union showed the Samurai could roll when a driver going less than 40 miles per hour swerved to avoid a child running into the street. 

   In a short report explaining why it turned down the recall request, the agency criticized rollover tests conducted by Consumers Union and NBC News on the Samurai, contending they "do not have a scientific basis and cannot be linked to real-world crash avoidance needs." 
The Consumers Union spokeswoman defended the group's tests, saying they were meant to replicate typical driving situations. 

   The agency, however, approvingly cited Suzuki's tests of the Samurai, saying they demonstrated that the vehicle "satisfactorily completed industry accepted tests which might be used to assess a vehicle's rollover propensity." 
The agency concluded that because crash data didn't show that the Samurai has been involved in more frequent rollovers than comparable vehicles, it wouldn't investigate whether the vehicle was defective or should be recalled. 

   Suzuki sales dropped greatly immediately after the negative reports on the Samurai's safety. 
But sales quickly rebounded when Suzuki gave dealers $2,000 incentives on each Samurai sale. 
If the dealers passed along all of the incentive to consumers, the move cut a whopping 25% off the vehicle's base price. 

   Apparently the tactic worked. 
Suzuki vice president and general manager Doug Mazza said Samurai sales in August will exceed 9,000 vehicles, topping the monthly record of 8,365 set in July 1987. 

   "I don't know what more we can do," Mr. Mazza said. 
"We've gone to the government and they've decided against pursuing an investigation, we've gone to our buyers and they've come back. 
We'd like to get back to business."
