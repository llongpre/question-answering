   The publisher of Consumer Reports magazine called on Suzuki Motor Co. to buy back its Samurai sports-utility vehicles, saying the model has a "hazardous propensity" to roll over when a driver attempts to avoid an accident. 

   In the July issue of the magazine, Consumers Union of U.S. Inc. will rate the Samurai "not acceptable," the first time in 10 years it has so classified a vehicle. 

   At a news conference here, the nonprofit testing group called the vehicle's design inherently dangerous and said it can't be modified to rectify the problems. 

   After testing three competing utility vehicles -- the Jeep Wrangler and Cherokee and the Isuzu Trooper -- as well as two versions of the Samurai, Consumers Union said it supported a recall of the 150,000 Samurais on the road. 

   Consumers Union, based in Mount Vernon, N.Y., also petitioned federal regulators to set performance standards requiring such sports-utility vehicles to pass a test measuring vehicle stability. 

   The Samurai "trips over its own feet," said R. David Pittle, technical director for Consumers Union. 

   In a stinging and angry retort, Suzuki asserted that "the Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety, including stability and handling, prior to its introduction" into the U.S. 
"We have absolute confidence that we are selling a safe and stable vehicle." 

   Late in February, Suzuki said it began investigating companies and organizations "making erroneous and inaccurate claims" about Suzuki and the Samurai. 
Suzuki yesterday reiterated a threat to sue the sources of unfounded allegations about the company. 

   Also yesterday, Suzuki cited some positive press that the Samurai has received regarding its design and handling. 
Earlier, the company had redesigned its ads away from a light approach of young and attractive people having fun with the Samurai. 
The new ads confront the safety issue directly and starkly in an attempt to counter critics' charges. 

   For years federal officials have been looking into the safety of these mixed-use vehicles. 
And Consumers Union isn't the first to demand that Suzuki recall the Samurai: The Center for Auto Safety, a Washington watchdog group, has petitioned the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to order such a move. 

   NHTSA, which declines to comment on Consumers Union's petition, in December turned down a petition filed by Sen. Timothy Wirth (D., Colo.) seeking a stability standard. 
NHTSA said, among other things, that addressing a rollover problem "solely on the basis of a stability factor is too narrow and inappropriate an approach." 

   NHTSA has 120 days to respond to Consumers Union's petition. 

   These utility vehicles are strong sellers right now, with about 6% of the market, up from less than 2% a decade ago. 
About five million currently are on the road. 

   Utility vehicles have a high center of gravity because they need extra ground clearance for off-road use. 
They also are exempt from the standards passenger cars must meet in resisting a crushed roof and absorbing side impacts, the group said. 

   But the Samurai also is narrower and lighter than its rivals, and Consumers Union said the Samurai "presents an unreasonable risk of harm to the consumer." 

   In its testing, the group attempted to simulate a routine situation in which a driver would have to swerve sharply to avoid an obstacle and then re-enter the driving lane. 

   The two smaller vehicles, the Samurai and the Jeep Wrangler, carried outriggers in the tests to prevent the vehicles from either falling over to the side or rolling because of a swerve or sharp turn. 

   During the tests, Consumers Union's drivers veered to the left 50 feet before an obstacle and moved back into the driving lane no more than 60 feet beyond the obstacle. 
Moving at about 40 miles an hour, the two Jeep models, made by Chrysler Corp.'s American Motors unit, and the Trooper, made by Isuzu Motors Ltd., remained stable, Consumers Union said. 
But both Samurai models, including a so-called 1988 1/2 model with a softer suspension, went over on the outriggers and would have rolled, the group said. 

   Consumers Union last gave a "not acceptable" rating when it criticized Chrysler's Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon for their steering performance during emergencies. 
Chrysler denied that a problem existed, and federal authorities didn't order a recall.
