   Most U.S. companies are ignoring President
Reagan's order to pay taxes owed Panama into a Treasury Department
escrow account established to pressure strongman Manuel Noriega to
resign, U.S. officials say.
   Reagan last April ordered U.S. companies with offices in Panama
to withhold taxes they owe its government and instead pay them into
the U.S. escrow account. The idea was that the money would be
turned over to Panama once Noriega has resigned or been forced from
office.
   Six months later, that Treasury Department account remains
nearly empty as U.S. companies routinely ignore the order to pay
into it, according to a member of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee.
   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., said senior State Department
officials told him they estimate that the escrow account is $65
million short of what it should be at this point.
   Gejdenson gave no figures on how much money is in the account.
But other congressional sources, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said it contained only $3.9 million, a figure that one
administration official described as ``in the ballpark.''
   Some U.S. businesses have told the administration they did not
want to pay into the account out of fears there were insufficient
accounting controls to keep track of how much each company paid,
said Peter Secor, a Panamanian specialist at the State Department.
   Secor said the Treasury Department, not the State Department,
keeps records on who pays and how much. Gejdenson said Treasury
Department officials have refused his repeated requests for that
information.
   Reagan's order was in two parts: the first that U.S. companies
do not pay the Noriega government and, second, that the money be
placed in the Treasury Department fund.
   ``Regardless of the second part, most if not all are complying
with the first,'' Secord said, adding that the administration had
put the most priority on keeping the money out of the Noriega
regime's hands.
   That explanation has been greeted with skepticism on Capitol
Hill, partly because the Panamanian government is allowing U.S.
companies to continue operating there.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if (the companies) continue to pay''
taxes to Panama, said Kathleen M. Bertelsen, a Gejdenson foreign
policy adviser. ``I just doubt Noriega lets them stay there without
paying.''
   But Secor said Noriega simply cannot afford, politically or
economically, to throw American corporations out.
   ``They don't want business confidence to erode anymore,'' he
said. ``It's important for the Noriega government to create the
impression of normalcy.''
   Secor also rejected the notion that Noriega is not applying
pressure on the American firms, saying that Panamanian officials
have used legal, financial and physical threats to try to get the
tax money.
   U.S. businessmen have reported threats such as ```You're going
to be in trouble,' or even `You're family is going to be in trouble
if you don't pay you're company's taxes','' Secor said.
   Gejdenson, in an interview Friday, said administration officials
have refused repeated invitations to testify at subcommittee
hearings to discuss the escrow account because the revelations
would be an embarrassment to Vice President George Bush and his
presidential campaign.
   ``It's one more demonstration that they've blown it,'' the
Democratic lawmaker said.
