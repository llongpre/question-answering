PEOPLE: SAMURAI SALES PLUNGE SPARKS SHUFFLE AT AMERICAN SUZUKI 
</P>

<P>
American Suzuki Motor Corp., staggered by a catastrophic decline in Samurai 
sales and weakness in its other automotive lines, said Monday that its 
president has been reassigned to corporate headquarters in Japan, and the three 
top officials of the auto division have resigned. 
</P>
<P>
Kenji Shimizu, chairman of Brea-based American Suzuki since July and a longtime 
executive and managing director of the Suzuki Motor Co. conglomerate in Japan, 
will replace Toshiyuki Arai as president of American Suzuki. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshi Fujii, another longtime Suzuki executive from corporate headquarters in 
Hamamatsu, Japan, has been named to the new position of executive vice 
president of the American Suzuki automotive division, which markets cars and 
sports vehicles. Other American Suzuki divisions market motorcycles and such 
miscellaneous products as outboard motors and snowmobiles. 
</P>
<P>
A company spokeswoman said no replacements have been named for the three U.S. 
automotive division executives who resigned Monday: Doug Mazza, vice president; 
John Dorsey, sales director, and Larry Messelt, national sales manager. 
</P>
<P>
Mazza and Dorsey were hired in 1985 to create American Suzuki's auto division, 
the same year Suzuki introduced the Samurai. 
</P>
<P>
The Samurai quickly caught on with younger drivers interested in low-cost 
sports vehicles, and sales soared to 81,349 cars in 1987. But in June, 1988, 
Consumer Reports magazine criticized the Samurai as being susceptible to 
rolling over, and sales began to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
Even though a federal study has since concluded that the Samurai is no more 
prone to rolling over than are similar vehicles, sales slumped to about 50,000 
in the first eight months of 1988, and in the first eight months of this year, 
just 3,399 Samurais have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of Suzuki's other vehicles -- a line of subcompacts and another sports 
vehicle introduced within the last year -- have also been hurt by the 
publicity. As of Sept. 1, Suzuki had sold just 21,389 cars and sports utility 
vehicles in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
In American Samurai's only statement about the management changes, spokeswoman 
Laura Segall said the company "has undergone significant changes in the past 
year." 
</P>
<P>
"When Mazza and Arai started in 1985, they had only one automobile product, the 
Samurai, and the goal was to establish a following for and generate sales of 
the Samurai, which they did," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"But now Suzuki is in a situation where we have a full line, including the 
Sidekick and the Swift passenger cars. The complexion of the company has 
changed, and there are different goals and philosophies on how best to run what 
essentially is a new company." 
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, American Suzuki announced its 1990 automobile lineup. The Samurai 
is being de-emphasized, with fewer models and options being offered. Meanwhile, 
the Sidekick -- a squat version of the Samurai with a lower center of gravity, 
is being offered in several new configurations. As last year, there will be 
three models of the Swift. 
</P>
