   The U.S. sales arm of Suzuki Motor Co. doesn't want to hear any complaints that its Suzuki Samurai sport vehicle may be unsafe, and is threatening legal action to squelch them. 

   The Japanese auto maker's announcement, issued by its Brea, Calif.-based U.S. arm Sunday and again yesterday, came in reaction to a complaint filed with little fanfare last week by the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington D.C.-based consumer group. 

   The group said it has evidence of 11 accidents in which a Samurai rolled over after a skid or a sharp turn. 
The accidents resulted in three deaths and injuries to eight other people, the group said in a petition filed last week with the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration. 

   But Suzuki, in an unusually combative response, said the consumer group's charges that the Samurai's high center of gravity made it too easy to tip over were "instigated in part by trial lawyers seeking to foster public opinion against Suzuki and perhaps the entire sport utility industry." 
The company said the Samurai is safe, and added that it will conduct an investigation to determine the source of the charges and "utilize every available means of halting the allegations, including any appropriate legal action." 

   Among the complaints lodged with the consumer group was one from John Moschetto, a retired New York City motorcycle patrol officer. 
Mr. Moschetto said in an interview yesterday that a Samurai he rented on a vacation in Aruba last July tipped over on its side after he skidded on wet pavement and hit the curb in a traffic circle. 
Mr. Moschetto said that he was traveling at less than 25 miles an hour when the accident occurred, and that he hadn't been drinking. 
"I couldn't believe what was happening," he said. 
Mr. Moschetto's daughter and another passenger were injured in the crash. 

   Complaints about rollovers aren't new to the sport utility vehicle industry. 
A number of lawsuits filed in the early 1980s charged that the Jeep CJ-5 vehicle was prone to rollovers because of its high center of gravity. 
American Motors Corp. ultimately stopped producing the CJ series at the end of 1984. 

   Suzuki and its public relations agency, Rogers &amp; Associates of Los Angeles, put "quite a bit of thought" into the pros and cons of reacting to the consumer group's petition, a spokeswoman for Rogers &amp; Associates said. 
"It was important for the company to make sure its point was well made, (and) I think it was," the spokeswoman said. 

   Suzuki said its investigation will seek to "determine the original source of the allegations and why the company is being singled out."
