   General Motors Corp. announced Sunday it had
reached a tentative agreement with a Hungarian government-owned
automaker to jointly build cars and engines at a plant under
construction in the Eastern European nation.
   The deal makes GM the first U.S. automaker to invest in Eastern
Europe, which has undergone tremendous political and economic
liberalization in recent months, said R.L. Theis, GM's
Detroit-based international spokesman. The company is to invest
$150 million in the dea.
   The agreement between General Motors Europe and RABA, Hungary's
state-owned manufacturer of trucks, diesel engines and axles, could
lead to a joint venture to build engines and cars at a plant in
Szentgotthard, near the Austrian border, beginning in 1992, Theis
said.
   ``The tentative agreement spells out the full intent of the
joint venture. Now, both parties have to finalize all the details
and actually form the joint venture,'' Theis said.
   Although GM is the first U.S. automaker to announce an
agreement, Japan's Suzuki Motor Co. announced Tuesday it would
build a $138.9 million assembly plant near Budapest, Hungary's
capital, to make Suzuki Swift subcompact cars beginning in 1992.
   GM Europe President Robert J. Eaton and RABA Managing Director
Ferenc Romvari signed the protocol Saturday in Budapest before
Hungarian Deputy Prime Minister Peter Medgyessy.
   ``As these markets continue to open up, investing in plants
there is becoming a more attractive business proposition,'' Eaton
said in a statement. ``This new strategic partnership would provide
us with better access to the growing car market in Hungary and
elsewhere in Eastern Europe.''
   Under the tentative agreement, GM would have a 67 percent
interest in the Szentgotthard plant and would be allowed to appoint
management staff. The plant would create about 880 jobs in the
western Hungarian town, Theis said.
   The world's largest automaker said about 200,000 engines would
be turned out yearly, most of which would be exported for use in
GM's Opel and Vauxhall cars. The rest would go into the Opel Kadett
model to be built at the Hungarian plant.
   Theis said current plans call for only one car-assembly shift
and an annual production of 15,000 vehicles for sale in Hungary and
other Eastern European markets.
   ``Market conditions will dictate whether an additional shift is
required,'' he said. Last year, Opel sold 6,600 cars in Hungary.
   The profitable European branches of both GM and Ford Motor Co.
have been bolstering sagging U.S. operations recently. Chrysler
Corp. also sells cars in Europe but does not run independent
manufacturing plants there.
   Last month, GM agreed to acquire half of the car business of
Sweden's Saab-Scania AB for about $600 million. That announcement
came on the heels of rival Ford's acquisition of Great Britain's
Jaguar PLC for $2.5 billion. Of the Big Three, Ford has the largest
presence in Europe.
   On Thursday, Ford spokeswoman Lin Cummins said the world's
second-largest automaker had no negotiations in the works involving
Eastern Europe, but was watching the market carefully.
   ``There would seem to be a good chance that multinational
companies will find opportunities for major business deals there in
the course of the next several years,'' Cummins said.
