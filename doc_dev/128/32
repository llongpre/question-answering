<HL> Suzuki Takes Extraordinary Measures To Halt Sales Plunge of Samurai Model </HL>

   Suzuki Motor Co. and some of its dealers are resorting to extraordinary measures -- including huge discounts and free life insurance -- to reverse the Samurai model's sales plunge. 

   This week, Suzuki started giving dealers $2,000 incentives on sales of the sport-utility vehicle. 
The company isn't requiring dealers to cut the Samurai's prices with the incentive, but many dealers say they'll immediately lop a whopping 25% off the Samurai's $7,995 base price. 

   The 12 Suzuki dealers in Ohio are taking matters a step further by giving Samurai buyers a free $1 million life-insurance policy. 

   "If something as drastic as this doesn't sell the Samurais, then maybe I'll run a bowling alley next week," said Robert Reichert, president of Kings Suzuki Inc. of Cincinnati, Ohio. 
"We have to do something to get people back in the showrooms again." 

   Samurai sales plunged 70.6% in June to 2,199 vehicles in the worst decline since their 1985 U.S. introduction. 
The severe drop followed charges by Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, that the Samurai is unsafe and tends to roll over while taking sharp turns. 

   The $2,000 Samurai dealer-incentive plan ranks as one of the deepest discounts ever offered on a vehicle sold in the U.S. Last month, Yugo America Inc. cut 17% off the base prices of its slow-selling subcompact cars imported from Yugoslavia. 

   Also, Audi of America Inc. is offering its former customers an 18% rebate on the purchase of a new Audi 5000 model, whose sales have plunged after allegations that the cars suddenly accelerate without the driver intending it. 
The 5000 model is being phased out. 

   Dealers who have watched showroom traffic dwindle away in the past month praised Suzuki's incentive plan. 
"We had to get something that grabbed attention," said Phil Smith, general manager of Dick Smith Suzuki in Kansas City, Mo. 
"If they would have come out with a $300 rebate it would have been lost in the clutter of all the other incentive offers, but $2,000 makes these vehicles so incredibly inexpensive." 

   Suzuki officials confirmed the existence of a dealer-incentive program but wouldn't confirm the amount being offered on each vehicle. 
The program began Wednesday and will last until Sept. 2. 
Company officials also declined to say whether they are considering other steps to spur Samurai sales. 

   But Suzuki dealers in Ohio said the company is thinking about using their free life-insurance offer nationwide. 
The Ohio dealers are offering the insurance, underwritten by American International Group, until the end of August. 
But Mr. Reichert said they may extend the offer if demand picks up. 

   "We can't run enough ads to convince the public that our cars are safe," Mr. Reichert said. 
"But with the insurance we can draw attention by saying we're willing to pay $1 million to back up the Samurai's safety." 
The insurance policy lasts for one year after the vehicle is purchased and covers only the death of the driver in a rollover accident.
