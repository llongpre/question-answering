   The U.S. Customs Service ruled Thursday that the
tiny Suzuki Samurai sport-utility vehicle will continue to be
counted as a truck since it enters the country without back seats,
which are added later.
   Suzuki Motor Co.'s Samurais are imported into the United States
as trucks because Suzuki doesn't have a large enough allocation
under the Japanese government's voluntary export restraints to ship
them as cars or sport-utility vehicles.
   ``This decision doesn't make any sense when people see how these
vehicles are being used in the United States, but in this case the
Customs Service has no choice,'' said Customs Commissioner William
von Raab.
   ``These are `trucks' under the law when they enter this
country,'' he said.
   Instead of paying a 2.5 percent car tariff, Suzuki pays a 25
percent truck tariff on each of the vehicles, which are shipped
without back seats to qualify as trucks.
   Rear seats are added either at the port of entry or at
dealerships. Few, if any of the small sport vehicles actually are
sold without rear seats. Suzuki sold 81,349 Samurais in this
country in 1987 and said it plans to sell 100,000 in 1988.
   Michigan Democrat John Dingell, chairman of the U.S. House
Energy and Commerce Committee, criticized von Raab's decision.
   ``It appears that Customs is still winking at the fact that the
Japanese are shipping seats into the U.S. separately, then
installing them here to evade both Customs laws and the (voluntary
export restraints),'' he said.
   ``We don't like illogical decisions any more than Commissioner
von Raab,'' Dingell said in a statement.
   Von Raab said Customs soon will seek public comment on the
creation of additional criteria that would simplify the
classification process.
   Last year, Customs and Commerce Department officials said the
U.S. government had little interest in helping the Japanese
government enforce its export limits, particularly since the U.S.
government takes in more money when foreign carmakers opt to pay
the 25 percent tariff instead of the lower fee.
   Other Japanese companies following Suzuki's practice include
Nissan Motor Corp., Isuzu Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and
Toyota Motor Corp., the companies said last year.
   The U.S. government has safety and fuel economy standards, among
other criteria, used to classify a vehicle as a car or truck for
those purposes.
   For example, trucks are not yet subject to the same roof-crush,
side-strength and high-mounted brake-light standards as cars.
   But those criteria are not used by the Customs Service, which
instead looks at features such as number of seats to determine a
vehicle's apparent purpose when it is imported.
   The Japanese government voluntarily limits exports of Japanese
cars to this country to 2.3 million per year.
   Under a less-publicized quota that was designed to cover station
wagons, which are considered trucks in Japan but cars in the United
States, the Japanese government also limits exports of
sport-utility vehicles and minivans shipped to this country to
113,000 to 115,000 a year.
   Suzuki, which gives nearly all its car allocation to General
Motors Corp. for the imported Chevrolet Sprint, built by Suzuki in
Japan, also has no sport-utility vehicle allocation.
   Earlier this year, Suzuki told the Customs Service it would be
forced to close its U.S. dealerships if the Samurai were classified
as a car.
   But when that information became public, Suzuki denied it had
any intention of closing dealerships and said it instead was
aggressively expanding its U.S. dealer network.
