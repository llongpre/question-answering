   Today is Monday, Aug. 22, the 235th day of 1988. There are 131
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Aug. 22, 1787, inventor John Fitch demonstrated his steamboat
on the Delaware River to delegates of the Continental Congress.
(Although Fitch deserves credit for inventing the first practical
steamboat, it was Robert Fulton who developed the first
commercially successful one. Fitch died in poverty in 1798.)
   On this date:
   In 1485, England's King Richard III was killed in the Battle of
Bosworth Field, ending the War of the Roses. Richard was succeeded
to the throne by Henry VII.
   In 1762, Ann Franklin became the first female editor for an
American newspaper, the Newport, R.I., Mercury.
   In 1775, England's King George III proclaimed the American
colonies to be in a state of open rebellion.
   In 1846, the United States annexed New Mexico.
   In 1851, the schooner America outraced the Aurora off the
English coast to win a silver trophy that came to be known as the
America's Cup.
   In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt became the first U.S.
chief executive to ride in an automobile, in Hartford, Conn.
   In 1911, it was announced in Paris that Leonardo da Vinci's
``Mona Lisa'' had been stolen from the Louvre Museum sometime
during the night. (The painting turned up two years later in Italy.)
   In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Vice President
Richard M. Nixon were nominated for second terms in office by the
Republican national convention in San Francisco.
   In 1968, Pope Paul VI arrived in Bogota, Colombia, for the start
of the first papal visit to Latin America.
   In 1984, the Republican national convention in Dallas nominated
President Reagan and Vice President Bush for a second term in
office. (In a break with tradition, both renominations were
approved in a single roll-call vote.)
   Ten years ago: President Jomo Kenyatta, a leading figure in
Kenya's struggle for independence, died in the city of Mombasa;
Vice President Daniel Arap Moi was sworn in as acting president. In
Nicaragua, leftist guerrillas seized the National Palace in Managua.
   Five years ago: In a move applauded by feminists, Justice
Department employee Barbara Honegger resigned her post, charging
that President Reagan's program to end sex discrimination in
federal laws and regulations was a ``sham.''
   One year ago: The supertanker Bridgeton and three other
reflagged Kuwaiti tankers left Kuwait under U.S. escort and safely
cleared Persian Gulf waters where the Bridgeton had hit a mine the
month before.
