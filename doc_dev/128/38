   Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger is expected to resign soon and be succeeded by National Security Adviser Frank Carlucci, according to sources close to the White House. 

   Mr. Weinberger's resignation had been rumored for weeks, amid reports that he was unhappy with the administration's pending arms control treaty with the Soviet Union. 
In addition, Mr. Weinberger is believed to be concerned about the continued poor health of his wife, Jane. 

   Mr. Carlucci, who served as Mr. Weinberger's deputy defense secretary for the first two years of the Reagan administration, is expected to be succeeded at the National Security Council by his assistant, Lt. Gen. Colin Powell. 

   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to comment on NBC and CBS news broadcasts last night that Mr. Weinberger was going to resign. 
"We have not received any letter of resignation," Mr. Fitzwater said. 

   Mr. Weinberger, who is attending a NATO meeting in Monterey, Calif., declined to comment. 
However, sources close to the White House confirmed that the defense secretary had indicated his plan to leave and his preference to be succeeded by Mr. Carlucci would be followed. 

   The Associated Press reported that sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said President Reagan approved the appointment in recent days, and it will be announced Thursday. 
The AP said Mr. Carlucci declined comment. 

   Mr. Weinberger, 70 years old, is one of the longest-serving cabinet officers in the Reagan administration and has maintained a hard-liner stance supporting Mr. Reagan's more than $1 trillion military buildup despite pressures to compromise with Congress. 
While the defense secretary endorsed the U.S. naval activities in the Persian Gulf, he lost an earlier battle in which he opposed sending U.S. Marines to Beirut, Lebanon, in 1982. 

   Mr. Weinberger was appointed secretary of health, education and welfare by President Nixon in 1973, a position he held until 1975. 
He then joined Bechtel Corp., a major international engineering concern, where he became a vice president, director and general counsel and worked with George Shultz, now secretary of state. 

   The resignation of Mr. Weinberger would be the latest of recent departures from the Reagan cabinet. 
In the past few weeks, Elizabeth Dole and William Brock resigned as transportation secretary and labor secretary to help with Sen. Robert Dole's presidential campaign.
