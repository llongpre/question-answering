   Suzuki Motor Co., already battling consumer groups critical of its Samurai sport utility vehicles, now faces a class action suit demanding that Samurai owners get their money back. 

   The suit, filed Friday in Illinois state court here, contends that all 150,000 U.S. Samurai owners should get refunds in the wake of charges that the vehicles are dangerously unstable. 
The suit also charges that Suzuki fraudulently withheld information about alleged design defects that give the Samurai a propensity to roll over in certain abrupt maneuvers. 
Robert Holstein, attorney for the three named plaintiffs, couldn't be reached for comment. 

   A spokeswoman for the Japanese company's U.S. sales arm said Monday that the company is aware of the suit, but had no comment on it. 
Suzuki has denied charges that the Samurai is unsafe, and has threatened to launch a legal counterattack against critics. 

   The battle over the Samurai intensified last week when Consumer Reports magazine announced that its tests showed the Samurai rolled over during sharp turns even at relatively low speeds. 
Consumers Union of U.S. Inc., the magazine's publishers, said Suzuki should buy back all models sold in the U.S. 
In March, the Washington, D.C.-based Center for Auto Safety made similar charges, and says now that it knows of 29 Samurai roll-over accidents that left eight people dead and 29 injured.
