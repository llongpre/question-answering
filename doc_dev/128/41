   Sales of the Suzuki Samurai broke a monthly
sales record by 45.9 percent in August as sharp price cuts helped
it stage a comeback from the damage done by allegations that it was
an unsafe vehicle.
   Samurai sales plunged by 70.6 percent in June after Consumers
Union charged that the small, boxy, four-wheel-drive vehicle was
dangerously top-heavy and prone to rolling over.
   August sales totaled 12,208, up from the 2,199 sold in June. The
sales were 54.4 percent ahead of the 7,905 sold in August 1987 and
45.9 percent ahead of the previous-record 8,365 sold in July 1987.
   ``Certainly consumer confidence is back in the Samurai,'' said
Douglas Mazza, general manager of the automotive division of
American Suzuki Motor Corp.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, stood by its
criticism of the Samurai, which it has rated `not acceptable.'
   ``In essence, deep discounts and advertisements for fun and
excitement do not make this a safe car,'' Marnie Goodman, a
spokeswoman, said Tuesday.
   The swift turnaround restored Suzuki's winning image just in
time for the fall introduction of two new vehicles, a bigger
four-wheel-drive vehicle named the Sidekick and a small hatchback
named the Swift.
   Suzuki is predicting Samurai sales will drop off now that the
dealer incentives have ended, but it is counting on the Sidekick
and Swift to more than pick up the slack.
   Analysts said American Suzuki _ the U.S. arm of Japan's Suzuki
Motor Co. _ is in a much better position than it was three months
ago.
   ``Momentum tends to feed on itself,'' said Scott Merlis, an
analyst for Morgan, Stanley &amp; Co.
   Merlis said he could not comment on the Samurai's safety, but
said it was obvious that customers were willing to shed any
lingering doubts raised by television news clips of the Samurai
tipping over while zigzagging on a Consumers Union test course.
   ``It's sometimes quite ironic how cash rebates can be the
antidote to safety concerns,'' Merlis said. ``Occasionally you see
sales incentives work like magic.''
   On July 13, Suzuki announced $2,000 incentives to dealers that
made it possible for them to slash 25 percent from the Samurai's
$7,995 base price. That helped July sales to rebound somehwat, to
6,327.
   Suzuki had piqued curiosity about its August results by saying
they would be a record, but kept its estimates low to enhance the
surprise.
   Mazza told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday that August sales
would top 9,000. He told the Associated Press on Friday he hoped
sales would exceed 10,000, but did not want to predict they would
be as high as 11,000. ``It was better than even we forecast, and
we're pretty optimistic,'' he said Tuesday.
   Suzuki steadfastly has defended the Samurai's safety, and its
contentions were supported last Thursday when the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration turned down petitions to investigate
and recall the vehicle. The agency said the Samurai was no more
dangerous than similar vehicles made by other companies.
   The Samurai's success was mirrored by the success of Chrysler
Corp.'s Jeep Wrangler, a competitor, whose sales rose 12 percent to
2,465 from 2,114. The Jeep line as a whole had record sales in
August.
   In another sense, the Samurai's experience is similar to the
rebound experienced by Chrysler's Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon,
which were rated not acceptable by Consumer Reports in June 1978.
Their sales fell by a third, but began to rebound after the United
States and Canadian governments said the charges of unsafe handling
could not be substantiated. Both cars are still on the market.
