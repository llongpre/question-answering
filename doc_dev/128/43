   General Motors Corp. says it is in the final leg
of talks with Hungary to establish a joint venture, possibly making
it the first U.S. carmaker to enter the recently liberalized
markets of Eastern Europe.
   If GM completes the deal, which company spokesman John Pekarek
said Thursday was in ``advanced stages,'' it could represent one of
the largest U.S. projects in the Eastern bloc.
   Pekarek declined to give details of the talks, other than to say
a decision about the project should be reached soon. He would not
confirm or deny a report from London in Thursday's Wall Street
Journal saying the negotiations centered on a $180-million project
to build cars and engines in Hungary.
   Pekarek said GM had no other negotiations under way involving
any other Eastern European project.
   GM would not be the first automaker to announce a deal with
Hungary. Suzuki Motor Co. of Japan said Tuesday it would build a
$138.9.million assembly plant near Budapest, the Hungarian capital,
to make Suzuki Swift subcompact cars beginning in 1992.
   A potential GM-Hungarian deal was news to auto analyst Kathleen
Heaney of Nikko Securities Co. International Inc. of New York.
   ``I'm just surprised at how quickly they (GM) moved because of
their nature,'' she said. ``Europe is a whole 'nother world for
them. Their (European) products look good and they're profitable.''
   However, she said, establishing a factory in Hungary would be
good for GM by giving it needed capacity.
   GM and Ford Motor Co. each have profitable businesses in Europe,
which recently have been bolstering sagging U.S. operations.
Chrysler Corp. markets some of its cars on the Continent, but has
no independent manufacturing plants there.
   Last month, GM agreed to acquire half of the car business of
Sweden's Saab-Scania AB for about $600 million. That announcement
came on the heels of Ford's acquisition of the British luxury
carmaker Jaguar PLC for $2.5 billion.
   GM already makes and sells Opel and Vauxhall vehicles in Europe.
It also owns all of Britain's Group Lotus PLC. Ford, which has the
largest European presence of any U.S. automaker, makes cars and
vans there carrying the Ford nameplate.
   Ford has no active negotiations involving Eastern European
production, said spokeswoman Lin Cummins. She said, however, that
the world's second-largest automaker behind GM is watching
developments closely.
   ``There would seem to be a good chance that multinational
companies will find opportunities for major business deals there in
the course of the next several years,'' she said.
   Chrysler officials also have said they have been surprised at
the speed of change in Eastern Europe and that later it would
provide a large market for vehicles.
   Heaney speculated it would be five years before any U.S.
automaker could begin making cars in Eastern Europe, partly because
of difficulties in converting the communist nations' currency into
dollars and partly because of the lack of personal wealth in
Eastern Europe.
   ``The consumers just don't have the money,'' she said.
   Other U.S. corporations also have moved to take advantage of the
rapid changes in Eastern Europe. General Electric Co. in November
agreed to pay $150 million for a majority stake in Tungsram,
Hungary's state-owned lighting manufacturer.
