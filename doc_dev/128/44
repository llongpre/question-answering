   Suzuki Motor Co. may continue to import its tiny
Samurai sport-utility vehicle as a truck rather than a car because
it enters the country without back seats, the U.S. Customs Service
has ruled.
   ``I don't like making any decision which seems illogical. This
decision doesn't make any sense when people see how these vehicles
are being used in the United States, but in this case the Customs
Service has no choice,'' said Customs Commissioner William von Raab.
   ``These are `trucks' under the law when they enter this
country,'' he said in announcing the decision Friday.
   Suzuki's Samurais are imported into the United States as trucks
because Suzuki doesn't have a large enough allocation under the
Japanese government's voluntary export restraints to ship them as
cars or sport-utility vehicles.
   Instead of paying a 2.5 percent car tariff, Suzuki pays a 25
percent truck tariff on each of the vehicles, which are shipped
without back seats to qualify as trucks.
   Rear seats are added either at the port of entry or at
dealerships. Few of the small, Jeep-like vehicles are sold without
rear seats. Suzuki sold 81,349 Samurais in this country in 1987 and
said it plans to sell 100,000 this year.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the U.S. House Energy
and Commerce Committee, criticized von Raab's decision.
   ``It appears that Customs is still winking at the fact that the
Japanese are shipping seats into the U.S. separately, then
installing them here to evade both Customs laws and the (voluntary
export restraints),'' he said.
   Last year, Customs and Commerce Department officials said the
U.S. government had little interest in helping the Japanese
government enforce its export limits, particularly since federal
government takes in more money when a maker opts to pay the 25
percent tariff instead of the lower fee.
   Other Japanese companies that follow Suzuki's practice include
Nissan Motor Corp., Isuzu Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and
Toyota Motor Corp., the companies said last year.
