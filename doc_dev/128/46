   A lawsuit filed Tuesday accused Suzuki
Motors Co. of violating federal racketeering laws by fraudulently
promoting its sporty Samurai vehicles as safe.
   The class-action suit alleged Suzuki and the firms handling the
company's public relations and advertising routinely committed mail
and wire fraud and conspiracy to conceal the Samurai's dangers,
violating the federal Racketeering Influenced, Corrupt
Organizations Act.
   The suit filed by Dr. Harold Kay, of Wynnewood, Pa., on behalf
of all Samurai owners not employed by Suzuki seeks unspecified
punitive and compensatory damages from the defendants.
   Suzuki has been defending itself vehemently against a call by
Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, for a ban
of the vehicles on the grounds that they tend to roll over in
sudden turns.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, contended the defendants
were ``aware the vehicles were not safe but instead were by design
and construction dangerous and unsuitable for on- or off-road use
and that advertising and other sales representations were false and
misleading.''
   Laura Segall, a spokeswoman for Suzuki and an employee of the
defendant public relations firm Rogers and Associates, would not
comment on the suit because she had not seen it.
   ``The bottom line we've said for the last 10 days is that it's
safe and stable,'' Ms. Segall said Tuesday.
   Consumers Union said June 2 that the $8,500 Samurai was the
first car out of 349 it had tested in the last decade to roll over
during a routine accident-avoidance test, in which cars swerve to
avoid a road obstacle.
   Suzuki said 300-pound outriggers attached to the trucks to
prevent them from rolling over completely during the tests had
contributed to the results. The company also partially blamed the
driver's actions for causing the vehicle to tip up on two wheels
during the test.
   Suzuki says the Samurai was tested thoroughly for safety,
stability and handling before it was introduced in the United
States in November 1985. Suzuki sold 154,675 Samurais through April.
   The lawsuit cites National Traffic Highway Safety Administration
figures indicating at least 44 Samurai rollover accidents resulted
in at least 53 injuries and 16 deaths.
   In addition to the Consumers Union claims, the suit cites the
Center for Auto Safety's February petition to the federal
government to order a Samurai recall.
   Suzuki Motors Co. Ltd. of Japan; U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp, of
Brea, Calif; Rogers and Associates, of Los Angeles; and
Keye-Donna-Pearlstein, a Los Angeles advertising firm, are named as
defendants.
