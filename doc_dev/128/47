4539 1795): "Nixon: A Statesman With Strategic Insight"] 
  [Text] At 2108 on 22 April 1994, Richard Nixon, a 
contemporary U.S. statesman with deep strategic insight and a 
former U.S. President, passed away at New York Hospital--Cornell 
Medical Center, after suffering a stroke. President Clinton 
announced the news in person at the White House Rose Garden two 
hours later, and ordered that flags over the whole country 
should fly at half-mast for 30 days to express mourning. 
  Richard Nixon was born on 9 January 1913 in Yorba Linda, a 
small town near Los Angeles, California. He graduated from Duke 
University Law School in 1937. During World War II, he served 
in the U.S. Navy and was sent on missions in the South Pacific 
region. 
  From 1946 onward, Nixon held the office of representative 
and 
senator, ran for governor, and was twice nominated Republican 
presidential candidate. For eight years, from 1952 to 1960, 
Nixon held the post of vice president under Eisenhower. He ran 
for president in 1960, but was narrowly defeated by the Democrat 
candidate Kennedy. 
  In 1968, he was elected 37th U.S. president. He was 
reelected president in 1972, but was forced to resign and leave 
the White House in 1974 because of his involvement in the 
"Watergate Affair." 
  During his six-year presidency, Nixon fully displayed his 
deep insight as an international strategist and his courage and 
resourcefulness as a statesman. His historic visit to China in 
1972 must be the most eye-catching event. In February 1972, he 
and Premier Zhou Enlai signed a joint communique in Shanghai, 
thus opening the door to U.S.-Chinese relations. 
  Nixon had great respect for Mao Zedong. Addressing a banquet 
during his first visit to China, he said: "Chairman Mao once 
wrote: `So many deeds brook no delay! The globe spins on, and 
time will not stay. Ten thousand years would be too long; let 
us seize the hour, and seize the day.' Now it is time for us to 
seize the hour, and it is time for our peoples to scale new 
heights." 
  After that, Nixon visited China many times. In the last book 
he wrote, he said: "Today, China's economic power makes U.S. 
lectures about human rights imprudent. Within a decade, it will 
make them rude [wu li 2477 4409] [Nixon's original wording is 
"irrelevant"]. Within two decades, it will make them laughable. 
By then the Chinese may threaten to withhold MFN status from the 
United States." 
  The "Watergate Affair" occurred in the United States when 
Nixon was playing an influential role in the international 
arena. So he became the first incumbent president in history to 
resign during his term of office. This was no doubt a 
formidable blow to Nixon. 
  However, step by step he finally returned to the political 
arena. In February 1976, he revisited China as an ordinary 
citizen. In 1977, he was interviewed by television reporters. 
In 1978, he started writing his memoirs. In 1981, he attended 
the funeral of assassinated Egyptian President Sadat, in the 
capacity of a member of the U.S. delegation. This was the first 
time he had attended an international function in an official 
capacity since leaving the White House. In the last few years, 
he paid special attention to international developments. Less 
than a month before his death, he braved severe cold to visit 
Moscow. 
  Several days before he was hospitalized, he received a copy 
of his last work, "After Peace," and he planned to read it over 
once again. Even before he fell ill, he was writing a speech 
which he was to deliver to raise funds for the Republican Party. 
  Nixon's death has shocked the world. Many national leaders, 
including Chinese leaders, have sent messages of condolence, 
praising this statesman's strategic insight and political 
courage. 
  Four living former U.S. presidents were highly appreciative 
of Nixon's political life. Gerald Ford said: "Nixon was, if 
not the best, at least one of the best presidents in terms of 
foreign policy." Ronald Reagan said: "His accomplishments in 
foreign policy will reserve him a high standing in history." 
Jimmy Carter said: "His historic visits to China and the 
Soviet Union paved the way for Deng Xiaoping's visit in person 
to the United States; and for the normalization of 
Sino-U.S.-USSR relations as well." George Bush said: "The 
difficulties he was faced with during his presidency may have 
shortened his term of office. But what we must remember are the 
many outstanding achievements he scored in both domestic and 
foreign affairs." 
  Former U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger had the following 
comments: Nixon was in fact an idealist, but at the same time 
he was also a realist. He believed that idealism does not 
hinder, but rather, indeed, needs an understanding of the world 
with its true face. The analysis that lets ideals serve the 
world rendered him a man always full of vitality. 
  From 27 April, Nixon will forever rest at his place of 
birth, 
Yorba Linda. Four years ago, in the same place, when attending 
the inaugural ceremony for a library named after him, he 
summarized his philosophy of life as follows: "Failure is 
certainly sorrowful, but the greatest sorrow is the absence of 
both victory and failure in one's life."
