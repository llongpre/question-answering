   Critics of the Suzuki Samurai have failed to
demonstrate the sport-utility vehicle has an excessive tendency to
roll over, federal regulators said Thursday in denying a recall
petition.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did, however,
begin proceedings to establish standards to protect drivers of all
light-duty vehicles ``against unreasonable risk of rollover.''
   Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine,
called for a ban on the Samurai in June, saying the vehicle
``literally trips over its own feet.''
   More than 150,000 of the vehicles have been sold in th United
States.
   NHTSA rejected a petition by the Center for Auto Safety, a
public-interest group often at odds with the auto industry and its
regulators, asking for a safety recall of the Samurai.
   ``The rollover crash involvement of the Samurai appears to be
within the range of most other light utility vehicles,'' the agency
said. ``Rollovers where they have occurred often appear to have
been influenced by adverse driver and environmental factors, such
as high-risk driving maneuvers, drinking, low ambient light and
lack of driver familiarity (with) either the vehicle or the road.''
   The Samurai's rollover rate, based on a study of 1986- and
1987-model vehicles, was six per 100,000 vehicles, NHTSA said. The
Ford Bronco II, by comparison, had a rollover rate of about 19 per
100,000 vehicles. The General Motors S-10 Blazer and S-15 Jimmy had
a rollover rate identical to the Samurai's.
   American Suzuki Motor Corp., the Japanese automaker's U.S.
subsidiary, said it ``claimed victory in its defense of the
4-wheel-drive Suzuki Samurai.''
   NHTSA's decision ``supports claims the Samurai is safe and
should put to rest the inaccurate and misleading attacks on the
vehicle,'' Suzuki said in Brea, Calif. It said it was pleased
``that the unfounded and inaccurate accusations about the Samurai
made by so-called consumer groups did not color NHTSA's judgement
on this matter.''
   The Center for Auto Safety said it would file a petition asking
NHTSA to reconsider its decision.
   ``Despite 113 rollovers, 120 injuries and 25 deaths, NHTSA
refuses to order a recall because it finds other utility vehicles
... are also hazardous,'' the center said. ``If this were the law,
then the Justice Department would refuse to prosecute one mass
murderer because there are other mass murderers.''
   A telephone recording said Consumer Union's offices in Mount
Vernon, N.Y., were closed.
   The highway safety agency granted a petition by the Consumers
Union to start research aimed at drafting regulations to guard
against rollovers.
   The petition ``does not purport to isolate a single cause of
rollover,'' NHTSA said. ``In fact, it acknowledges that there are
`factors other than a vehicle's stability factor (which) play a
role in rollover causation.'''
   The agency listed 10 research projects into vehicle stability it
had completed or planned to complete.
   NHTSA cautioned that granting the Consumers Union's petition
``does not necessarily mean that a rule will be issued.''
