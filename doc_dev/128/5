   With sales of its Samurai sport utility vehicle slumping, Suzuki Motor Co. blasted Consumer Reports magazine for using "distorted" testing to reach the "inaccurate" and "defamatory" conclusion that Samurai is unsafe because it tends to roll over in sharp turns. 

   At a 90-minute news conference beamed by satellite from Los Angeles to reporters in Detroit and New York, the company escalated its war on Consumers Union of U.S. Inc., the magazine's publisher, accusing it of "biased" and "seriously flawed" testing. 
Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of American Suzuki Motor Corp.'s automotive division, said Suzuki, a "small Japanese company" is being unfairly singled out for criticism. 

   Mr. Mazza conceded that Suzuki hadn't asked the consumer group for more detailed information about exactly how it had conducted its road tests. 
But he insisted: "We do not have a rollover problem." 

   R. David Pittle, technical director for Consumers Union, asserted yesterday that the group's testing was fair. 
He added that Consumers Union hasn't heard from Suzuki since he sent the company a copy of the Consumer Reports article, a videotape of a road test, and a copy of the test protocol. 
That was one day before the June 2 news conference at which Consumers Union pronounced the Samurai "unacceptable" and urged that all 150,000 Samurai vehicles sold in the U.S. be recalled, he said. 
The group's findings came two months after similar charges by the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety. 

   Mr. Pittle called Suzuki's suggestion that it is the victim of a conspiracy "bizarre." 
He added: "Let's keep our eye on the ball. 
The car rolls over when it shouldn't." 

   As part of its effort to counter the safety critics, Suzuki spent an extra $1.5 million just for television advertising during the past week, Mr. Mazza said. 
The company also has supplied its dealers with a videotape detailing the company's case that the Samurai is stable. 

   Suzuki's immediate, combative stance -- complete with broad hints of possible legal action -- is a sharp contrast to the silent treatment some other auto makers have used in the face of similar attacks. 

   Samurai sales were slumping even before the safety questions came to the fore in March. 
But they fell 22.5% that month, and 26% in April, from the year-earlier periods. 
They appeared to rebound in May, but Suzuki dealers contacted since the Consumers Union made its report say showroom traffic is off again. 

   Suzuki's troubles have been a source of glee for Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep-Eagle dealers. 
The Samurai had cut heavily into sales of Jeep's Wrangler models, but one Jeep dealer in Florida said questions about Samurai safety appear to be changing that. 

   "We had 30 Wranglers in, and in two weeks time they're gone," said Bill Gill, manager of the sales department for Royal Jeep-Eagle in Fern Park, Fla. 
Nationwide, Wrangler sales through May 31 were up 43% from a year earlier. 
Samurai and Wrangler appeal to the same young audience, but now "their parents are bringing them here instead of there," Mr. Gill said. 

   A few miles away, Jeff Nanton, an owner of Seminole Suzuki, said his sales are soft, but he blamed that on a "depressed" regional market. 
"What we're fighting is an allegation rather than a fact," he said. 
"We've had many customers call in total support of the vehicle."
