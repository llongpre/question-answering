   Japanese consumer leaders contend lax government
enforcement of auto safety standards has allowed the sale of
thousands of unsafe vehicles in Japan _ including the Suzuki
Samurai, which also has come under fire in the United States.
   Consumer leaders here say Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd. continued
selling the sport-utility vehicle even though it knew for at least
a year that the car was prone to roll over.
   Similar contentions about the rollover danger _ vehemently
denied by Suzuki _ have been leveled by the Consumers Union, a U.S.
private consumer product testing group that has called for the
banning of the vehicle.
   In Japan, ``The Transport Ministry almost entirely relies on
each manufacturer's voluntary compliance with the safety
standard,'' said Fumio Matsuda, a consumer activist who heads the
Japan Automobile Users' Union.
   ``The Japanese companies usually adhere to the ministry's
requirements faithfully. But if an unsafe car gets sold by mistake
or negligence, Japan has no way to control it because the Transport
Ministry has no adequate regulatory system,'' Matsuda said.
   Matsuda blamed the interdependent relationship between the
government and corporations, which often is perceived as an
advantage for Japanese companies over foreign competitors, for
leading to dangerous conditions.
   Matsuda said Suzuki ignored his complaints for more than a year
after he contended the cars were vulnerable to rolling over during
sudden turns.
   ``I pointed out to company officials last year that the car's
high center of gravity and the narrow width can make the car
unstable,'' Matsuda said. ``But they told me they were aware of the
problem. Apparently they were not taking the matter seriously.''
   Although the Japanese government does not keep statistics, a
number of accidents involving the car have been reported in Japan
since manufacturing began in 1970, according to newspaper reports.
Since 1981, when production of the current model began, the company
has sold 120,000 of the vehicles in Japan.
   The Samurai _ sold in Japan as the Jimny _ originally was
designed for a 360 cubic-centimeter engine. The model exported to
the United States has a 1,300 cubic-centimeter engine, an upgraded
version which the company started producing in 1984.
   ``Upgrading the size of an engine requires larger tires, which
will inevitably lift the center of gravity of the car,'' said
Matsuda, who is a mechanical engineering specialist. ``And with a
stronger horsepower, the upgraded model requires a more stable
structure. They should have gone back to the designing stage and
restructured the car from scratch. But the 1,300cc model is only a
enlarged model of the smaller one.''
   American Suzuki Motor Corp., Suzuki's U.S. subsidiary,
vigorously has defended the safety of the Samurai and attacked the
credibility of the Consumers Union testing. The Samurai has a lower
rate of rollovers than several other sport-utility vehicles, the
company says.
   Analysts and engineers have asked the Transport Ministry to
review its safety regulations and enforcement before the Japanese
auto industry suffers severe damage to its reputation in overseas
markets.
   ``If the Transport Ministry does not change its loose attitide,
there will be more cases similar to the Suzuki overseas,'' said
Yoshiro Hoshino, a professor at Teikyo University, who follows
automobile safety issues. ``Unlike in Japan, traffic accidents are
strictly investigated in the United States and any safety defects
will be a target of legal action.''
   The Transport Ministry recently said it would recall the vehicle
in Japan only if Suzuki decided to recall it in the United States.
   ``Japanese automobile companies have been so image-conscious in
the past decade that the Transport Ministry really did not need to
worry about the quality or safety standards of automobiles made by
Japanese manufacturers,'' said Hoshino, who specializes in
mechanical engineering.
   ``But as a result, the Transport Ministry failed to develop an
adequate checking function for the safety of automobiles.''
   But Transport Ministry officials say the current system works
well.
   ``Japanese manufacturers are fully aware of our safety standards
and strictly comply with them. I don't think Japan's safety
standard is at all inferior to that of the United States and
European countries,'' said the ministry's Masayuki Shima.
   Hoshino and Matsuda said the core of the problem lies in
enforcement, not in the standards. Shima acknowledged the ministry
did not conduct a maneuvering safety test with the Samurai because,
based on data submitted by the company, it did not believe the test
was necessary.
   Hoshino said an excessive confidence in quality may be making
Japanese manufacturers arrogant.
   ``I am beginning to sense that Japanese makers often think their
products could not be defective because they are so confident in
their quality control,'' he said. ``And it is resulting in their
unwillingness to check the vehicle's safety.''
