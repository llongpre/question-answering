   NEW YORK -- Michael Berman, one of the highest-ranking
American executives at the U.S. subsidiary of Japan's Nomura
Securities Co., has resigned.
   Mr. Berman, a senior vice president in charge of the
unit's U.S. government trading and sales operations, said he
was leaving primarily for personal reasons, although he
conceded that a rigid, risk-averse management style at
Nomura's headquarters in Tokyo also frustrated him at times.
Similar complaints have been cited by other U.S. employees of
the giant Japanese brokerage firm.

   Mr. Berman's resignation took effect yesterday. His
responsibilities will be assumed temporarily by Makoto
Takahashi, an executive vice president of the U.S. unit.
   An expert in derivative products, such as futures and
options, Mr. Berman joined Nomura from Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in
January 1990. He was the first person hired by Max C. Chapman
Jr. after Mr. Chapman joined Nomura as co-chairman of the
giant Japanese broker's U.S. unit in October 1989. Mr.
Chapman's goal has been to build Nomura's ability to trade in
sophisticated financial products and make better use of the
firm's capital.
   Mr. Berman initially was brought in to start up a
derivative products unit in New York. But Nomura executives
in the U.S. said that roadblocks thrown up by parent-company
executives in Japan thwarted the U.S. subsidiary's ability to
expand in areas such as swaps -- in which two or more parties
exchange financial obligations -- and other sophisticated
financial products.
   Explaining his motives for resigning, Mr. Berman said:
"I've been doing this stuff for a while. I'd like to get some
distance between myself and Wall Street, and I'd like to
spend a little time with my family."
   He added: "I've enjoyed some responsibilities I wouldn't
have had at other places and had a unique cross-cultural
experience." Nonetheless, the 40-year-old executive admitted
to being frustrated.
   "I was brought on to do derivative business," he said.
"While the capital requirements haven't been lacking, there
are credit and risk-management issues on which it has been
very difficult to come to mutual agreement with Tokyo." For
instance, he noted that the parent company wouldn't let the
U.S. subsidiary use its triple-A rating in backing
commitments, which significantly hindered the U.S. unit's
ability to trade swaps.
   A spokesman for Nomura's U.S. subsidiary declined to
comment on the issues raised by Mr. Berman. Nomura executives
said, however, that Mr. Berman's departure was in no way
related to recent scandals that are rocking Japan's
securities industry.
   Two weeks ago, the parent company's president, Yoshihisa
Tabuchi, resigned after the firm admitted that it had paid
millions of dollars to selected clients to compensate them
for losses suffered when Tokyo stock prices plunged in 1990.
Nomura also allegedly helped to finance the business dealings
of a reputed Japanese gangster.
   While other areas of financial services, such as money
management, still interest Mr. Berman, he said he had "no
great desire to work for another Wall Street firm right
away."
   He added: "I'm not new to this thing, figuring out what to
do. I spent eight years as a musician."
