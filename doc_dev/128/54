In a bid to capture a piece of the growing market for so-called fun trucks, 
Mazda Motor of America said Thursday that it will begin selling its version of 
Ford Motor Co.'s new Explorer sport-utility vehicle this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda's announcement marked the first time a Japanese auto maker will buy an 
American manufacturer's vehicles and then sell them under its name in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, U.S. car makers buy Japanese- or Korean-built cars for sale under 
their names. 
</P>
<P>
The deal underscored the global melding by auto makers as they forge 
partnerships to cut costs and remain competitive into the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
It also marked another association between Ford and Mazda Motor Corp. The two 
have been financial partners since 1979 when Ford bought 25% of Mazda. The two 
recently began collaboration on new vehicles. Mazda produces the chassis shared 
by the Mazda MX-6 and the Ford Probe and builds the Probe for Ford at its plant 
in Flat Rock, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Ford's all-new Escort and Tracer subcompact cars, which will debut later this 
year, are heavily based on Mazda subcompacts already on sale. 
</P>
<P>
The new Mazda sports utility vehicle, to be called the Navajo, was shown 
Thursday at a preview for the Chicago Auto Show that starts a nine-day run 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The truck essentially is the same vehicle as the Ford Explorer that will go on 
sale this spring as a 1991 model to replace the Ford Bronco II. 
</P>
<P>
Fred Aikins, a spokesman for Mazda Motor of America, the auto maker's 
Irvine-based U.S. marketing and distribution company, said the Navajo's front 
end and interior will be different from the Explorer's, however. 
</P>
<P>
Aikins said the Navajo will sell in the $13,000-$18,000 price range -- about 
the same as Mazda's wildly successful two-seat convertible, the Miata. 
</P>
<P>
He said the company expects Navajo sales to hit only 15,000 to 18,000 units a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda decided to use a Ford-designed and built sports utility vehicle rather 
than developing its own, Aikins said, "because developing any kind of vehicle 
was quite expensive and Ford had a vehicle that was ready. We've been looking 
into a sport utility truck design for several years now." 
</P>
<P>
Auto industry analysts say that the fun-truck market for Jeep-like sports 
utility trucks and for small pickup trucks is about the only one that is doing 
well in the current depressed auto market. 
</P>
<P>
The vehicles often are priced less than comparably equipped sedans and have a 
definite identity in a market that increasingly is offering consumers 
look-alike vehicles, said Jim Hillson, senior analyst with Phase One, an 
advertising research firm in Los Angeles that specializes in automobile 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Mazda is in particular need of a new truck model because its truck sales have 
been falling since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
One potential problem Mazda faces with the Navajo, several analysts said, is 
that it will market only a two-door version, while the Ford Explorer will come 
in both two-door and four-door models. 
</P>
<P>
Two other Japanese auto makers, both headquartered in Orange County, already 
sell two-door sports-utility vehicles in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Daihatsu America, headquartered in Los Alamitos, markets the Rocky, while 
American Suzuki Motor Corp. of Brea sells the Samurai and Sidekick models. 
</P>
<P>
The market for four-door sports utility vehicles is generally considered to be 
the healthiest. 
</P>
<P>
Ford and General Motors are introducing four-door trucks to compete with 
Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep Cherokee and with import models like the Toyota 4Runner. 
</P>
<P>
But selling the Navajo allows Mazda to sidestep the 25% import tariff imposed 
on two-door trucks while putting the auto maker into a new market segment. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to be a full-line marketer," said Yoshi Taura, president of Mazda 
Motor of America.
