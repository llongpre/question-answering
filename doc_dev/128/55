ALMANAC: ASIAN MOTOR COMPANIES IN COUNTY; 
</P>
<P>
FIRMS SETTLE IN 'PACIFIC MOTOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Japanese motorcycle makers were the first Asian motor companies to open 
distribution and marketing headquarters in Orange County when they came here in 
the 1960s. Since then, several Asian car companies have made Orange County 
their American home. Although no cars are made here, one industry analyst 
describes the county as "Motown on the Pacific." 
</P>
<P>
The largest Japanese motor companies -- Toyota, Nissan and Honda -- are in Los 
Angeles County, where they settled more than 25 years ago. But most of those 
arriving from Asia in the 1980s have chosen Orange County, citing the 
availability of land, the attractiveness of the area, the increase of ethnic 
diversity.

"I'm living where tastes are being set. It's the perfect place to do my work," 
said Hideaki Yoshizawa, executive vice president and general manager of design 
at Mitsubishi's Cypress Design Studio.
