   H.R. Haldeman, a former Nixon aide who went to
jail because of the Watergate scandal, is among the business and
agricultural leaders who will meet with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Sunday.
   Haldeman recently helped the Minneapolis-based Radisson Hotels
International chain get approval to start a hotel in Moscow. It will
be the first U.S.-managed hotel in the Soviet Union.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich's administration said Friday after the guest
list of 145 names was made public that Haldeman was not one of the
suggested names it submitted to the Soviets but was added by them.
The meeting will be at the Radisson Hotel in Minneapolis.
   Haldeman was in Moscow last month to take part in a signing
ceremony during a meeting of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic
Council. He and former astronaut Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin were
representing Americom International Corp., an office technology
concern in Irvine, Calif., which will operate the hotel along with
Radisson.
   Haldeman was convicted of obstruction of justice and conspiracy
in the Watergate burglary and coverup and served 18 months in
prison. The scandal forced Richard Nixon to resign the presidency.
   While in Moscow, Haldeman expressed his admiration for Gorbachev,
making an implied comparison to his former boss.
   ``I can only say having observed one politician very closely with
a remarkable ability for survival and recovery, and watching
Gorbachev, I have utmost admiration for his political skills,'' he
said.
