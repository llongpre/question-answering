   National Bank of Canada appointed D. Nicholas Radford senior vice president and treasurer of its U.S. division in the second shuffle of executives since the bank's New York office reported a big bond trading loss earlier this year. 

   Mr. Radford succeeds John Kocab as treasurer of the U.S. operation. 
Mr. Kocab remains with the bank as vice president of treasury and exchange for the U.S. division. 
The post of senior vice president is new. 

   Jean Turmel, the parent bank's executive vice president and treasurer, said the relinquishing of Mr. Kocab's duties as treasurer of U.S. operations "isn't directly connected" to the bond trading losses. 
But he did say that Mr. Kocab will now report to Mr. Radford. 

   National Bank, Canada's sixth largest chartered bank, reported a charge of 26.5 million Canadian dollars (US$21.9 million) in its first quarter ended Jan. 31. 
The charge resulted from unauthorized transactions made by one of its New York bond traders. 

   Mr. Radford, 53 years old, was vice president and treasurer of National Bank's U.S. division from 1983 to 1986, when he left for a similar position at the New York office of Credit Lyonnais, the large French bank. 

   Mr. Radford's appointment follows the earlier resignation of Edward Lyssan as the executive vice president, finance and control of the parent bank. 
Mr. Turmel said "there are various reasons why Mr. Lyssan left," but wouldn't elaborate. 

   Mr. Lyssan, who still has an office at the bank, said his departure wasn't linked to the New York losses and said he wasn't asked to resign. 
Asked whether he has another job, he responded "I don't want to describe my future plans to journalists." 

   A spokeswoman for the bank said no successor to Mr. Lyssan was named. 
"The position was abolished," she said. 
"Mr. 
Lyssan's mandate was filled and he won't be replaced." 
She said Mr. Lyssan had accomplished his job of solving the problems that stemmed from the bank's formation in 1979 from a merger of Banque Canadienne Nationale and Provincial Bank of Canada. 

   The spokeswoman also said Mr. Lyssan's departure has nothing to do with the losses at the New York office.
