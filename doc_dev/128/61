   Consumers Union, a consumer advocacy group, has called an unusual news conference for tomorrow to declare Suzuki Motor Co.'s Samurai sport-utility vehicle a safety hazard, according to people close to the group's study of the vehicle. 

   The organization, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, rates cars regularly. 
But the last time it branded a vehicle "unacceptable" was 10 years ago, when it criticized Chrysler Corp.'s Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon for steering performance during emergencies. 

   Consumers Union officials refused to confirm the subject of the press conference, or provide additional details. 
The Samurai, however, has come under public scrutiny recently for allegations that the vehicle rolls over too easily. 

   A Suzuki spokesman said he wasn't aware of the group's assessment and couldn't respond. 
But he said that the Samurai "came out very good" in recent government accident reports. 
The Samurai was an instant success when it started selling in the U.S. in 1985. 
But its sales declined 21% in the first four months of this year compared with the year-earlier period. 

   Although Consumers Union received substantial publicity for its allegations against the Omni/Horizon a decade ago, Chrysler strongly denied that a problem existed, and federal authorities didn't issue a recall over the charges. 
The models are still among Chrysler's most popular.
