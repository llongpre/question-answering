  [Text] The president-in-exile has not given an official 
answer on the new plan proposed by the United States for an end 
to the crisis. The president-in-exile's spokesman specified that 
the government's position will be known this week. Reacting to 
the initiatives undertaken in Port-au-Prince attempting to apply 
Article 149 of the Constitution, spokesman Jean-Claude Martineau 
stated that the problem of democracy is not a question of 
applying some article of the Constitution, but to neutralize 
those who constitute an obstacle to democracy. Mr. Martineau 
also rejected the calls for resignation by some opponents and 
even some supporters of the president-in-exile. He answered 
Clarence Renois' questions: 
  [Begin recording in Creole] [Martineau] The U.S. plan to 
solve the crisis is still being studied. Before long, I suppose 
that President Aristide will give an answer, his opinion on this 
plan. 
  Concerning the people who are in Haiti -- the political 
parties that want to refer to Article 149 -- there is one thing 
we would like to point out to them and I believe they already 
know: Article 148, 149, 250 or 3000, will not solve the crisis 
in Haiti because the crisis in Haiti does not lie there. The 
president's absence is not voluntary. It is an absence which 
came after a coup d'etat. That is the first thing they should 
know. I believe they know that. The second point to consider is 
that no matter the article they refer to, and no matter how they 
try to replace the president -- the unconstitutional way they 
would like to do it -- it will still not solve the crisis. 
Because the crisis is simply because Haiti, instead of being a 
country, a republic, has become a drug warehouse where people 
are killing people, manhandling people as they please. This 
crisis cannot be solved with articles. Haitians who favor 
democracy must stand up to change things so the country then has 
peace and with peace, it can rebuild itself. 
  [Renois] Mr. Martineau, some supporters and opponents of 
President Aristide asked the president to resign in order to 
allow a solution to the crisis. Does President Aristide take 
into account those considerations? Does he take into account 
those positions. What does he intend to do? 
  [Martineau] No. I suppose those people should know who 
should resign under these conditions. I think the people who 
are killing people should resign. I think if those people can 
ask President Aristide to resign, they should first ask the 
Haitian people if they have changed their vote. Are they giving 
the Haitian people the right to say yes or no, whether they 
changed their 16 December vote? That is what they ought to do 
if they have the courage. I think there is a sort of cowardice 
when President Aristide is asked to resign and at the same time 
one kowtows to the military who are murdering people. I think 
those people know exactly who should resign under these 
circumstances -- people who are killing, who are selling drugs 
and who are manhandling people -- those are the people who 
should resign. In Haiti there should not be a resignation of 
peace, but rather a resignation of the pressure tactics of sorts. 
  [Renois] Mr. Martineau, it appears then that there is a bit 
of Indian wrestling going on between President Aristide's 
legitimacy and the authority of the current government or the 
military who overthrew him. In the end, it harms the Haitian 
people, since sanctions have been imposed. What is now being 
done by the government-in-exile to effect an improvement of the 
situation? Are there some steps being taken at that level? 
  [Martineau] Certainly some steps are being taken at that 
level. Meanwhile, do not forget that a president in any country 
is an advocate of the Constitution. Do we have a Constitution 
or do we not? No matter the compromise that can be reached, 
should those compromises violate the Constitution? In Haiti, 
everyone violates the Constitution, except one group, the group 
that favors democracy. The most stupid thing is that they are 
asking this group to resign. In this case, what is the future of 
elections, of the Constitution in Haiti? Every time a president 
is elected, if the military does not want him, they overthrow 
him and they assert that everything must change. Well! Some 
things must change in Haiti. But, it is not the Constitution, 
it is not the law. It is force, selfishness, and thievery that 
must change in Haiti. 
  [Renois] A final question Mr. Martineau. Does the 
government-in-exile hope the situation will change in favor of 
President Aristide so he can return to power? 
  [Martineau] It is not something that should change in favor 
of President Aristide. It must be in favor of the Haitian 
people. Yes, we hope that things will change and we hope that no 
matter what happens, the Haitian people will win. [end
