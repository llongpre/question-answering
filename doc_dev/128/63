   Quaker Oats Co. said a senior executive at its U.S. and Canadian grocery products operation resigned and that the unit, Quaker's largest, will be reorganized. 

   The food and consumer products concern said Hedric E. Rhodes, a 19-year Quaker veteran, resigned from his post as executive vice president, U.S. foods. 
The U.S. and Canadian grocery products unit will be divided into three operational areas, each to be headed by a separate vice president. 
Previously, the unit had two operational areas and a support group, Quaker said. 

   A Quaker spokeswoman declined to provide details of Mr. Rhodes's resignation, but said it had come as a surprise to some company officials. 
Another Quaker executive involved in the reshuffle, who asked not to be identified, said Mr. Rhodes did not appear upset when he told colleagues of his resignation. 
He couldn't be reached for comment. 

   The Quaker spokeswoman said the reorganization has been under consideration by Quaker's management for several weeks. 
Part of the reason for the shake-up, she said, is that the U.S. and Canadian grocery products unit has grown considerably recently. 
Last August, Quaker acquired San Leandro, Calif.-based Golden Grain Macaroni Co. for $275 million. 
In September, it purchased Anderson, Clayton &amp; Co., a Houston-based food maker for $805 million. 
In the fiscal year ended June 30, the U.S. and Canadian grocery products unit's sales were $2.82 billion, or 63% of Quaker's total sales of $4.42 billion. 

   "When someone resigns, you take a look at the businesses you have and decide whether to reorganize," the spokeswoman said. 
"The smaller the unit, the more flexible and aggressive you can be." 

   Under the reorganization, James R. Tindall, currently president of Quaker's cereals division, will succeed Mr. Rhodes as executive vice president, U.S. foods. 
Philip A. Marineau, currently president of the company's grocery specialties division, was named to the new post of executive vice president, grocery specialties and market development. 
Lawrence K. Hathaway, currently president of the convenience foods division, was named to succeed Mr. Tindall as president of the cereals division. 
Kenneth J. Fedor, currently managing director, Germany, was named president, convenience foods division, succeeding Mr. Hathaway. 

   Quaker said the reorganization takes effect Sept. 1.
