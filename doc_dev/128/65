   Suzuki Samurai dealers say sales of the popular sport vehicle
are showing early signs of a comeback from the damage done by
assertions that it rolls over too easily.
   In an Associated Press survey, the nation's top 10 dealers
predicted their June sales would be off by as little as a tenth to
more than half because of the critical June 2 report by Consumers
Union.
   ``For the first three or four days we had just literally no
traffic,'' said John Alexander, general sales manager of McDavid
Suzuki in Houston, the nation's No.10 dealer. ``But time is
helping. Time is the big healer.''
   Separately, Consumers Union said Monday that it received a June
11 letter from American Suzuki Motor Corp. demanding a retraction
of its report, but rejected it, writing back that its report was
``wholly fair and accurate, and based upon properly conducted
tests.''
   Dealers contend the people who still are buying Samurais are
skeptical of the Consumers Union report and are confident the
sport-utility vehicle is safe as long as it is driven sensibly.
   ``Believe it or not, it's beginning to turn around already,''
said Mickey Rhines, a salesman for the nation's No.1 Suzuki
dealership, Earnhardt Suzuki in Tempe, Ariz.
   Consumers Union gave the Samurai its first ``not acceptable''
rating for a vehicle in 10 years after concluding the Samurai's
high center of gravity and light weight gave the vehicle a
hazardous propensity to roll over if a driver swerved to avoid an
accident.
   American Suzuki claims Consumers Union, the Mount Vernon,
N.Y.-based publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, used ``biased
and completely inaccurate'' procedures in its tests, which were
widely publicized.
   Dealer estimates of the publicity's damage ranged widely, and it
was not possible to verify their statements independently.
   The top 10 accounted for 12 percent of all sales this year
through May by the company's 206 U.S. dealers.
   American Suzuki Motor says it would have no statement until July
6 about its June sales of the Samurai, its only car sold in the
United States.
   The dealers' response has ranged from the cautious _ some cut
back on advertising _ to the lighthearted.
   In the Atlanta suburb of Marietta, Ga., Mark Singleton Suzuki
put up a sign saying, ``Stop By, You'll Flip Over Our Deals.'' The
word ``flip'' was upside down.
   The Georgia dealership, ranked No.5, also went ahead with plans
made before the Consumers Union report for a bikini beach party
featuring swimsuit-clad women and a pair of Suzukis parked on top
of a huge sandpile.
   Crabtree Suzuki of New Rochelle, N.Y., not one of the top 10,
ran full-page newspaper ads featuring contented customers saying
why they liked the Samurai. An example: ``It's so easy to handle,
just like my monthly payments.''
   American Suzuki provided dealers with video cassettes of
Samurais successfully handling obstacle courses at high speeds as
well as information about the vehicle's safety record.
   Dealers said customers who came to the showrooms were willing to
be convinced.
   ``People are getting tired of Consumers Union telling them they
can't ride three-wheelers and they can't ride quad-runners,'' said
Mark Muller, the general manager of ninth-ranked John Chezik Suzuki
in the St. Louis suburb of St. Charles, Mo.
   ``We tell them, `Hey, you don't drive it like a sports car,'''
said Richard McGhee, general manager of Suzuki Northeast in
Columbus, Ohio, the No.3 dealer.
   ``If you go out and drive the vehicle like an idiot, well then
of course you're going to have idiotic results,'' said Earnhardt's
Rhines.
   Three-wheelers and quad-runners are all-terrain vehicles that
have been criticized for their instability, and Consumers Union has
said consumers should be offered full refunds on returns of them.
   Muller said he may have a near-record month for profit in June
because he saved thousands of dollars by halting advertising.
   ``The people that would be the most concerned with this would be
uneducated. That's not our market to start with,'' said Jim
Hardison, assistant sales manager of Beaman Suzuki in Nashville,
Tenn., the No.6 dealer.
   ``The educated buyer will not only read the Consumers Union
report, but they'll read other reports as well,'' such as favorable
reviews in the auto magazines, said Keith Hugger, sales manager of
Bell Suzuki in Rahway, N.J., the No.4 dealer.
   ``I don't have any second thoughts at all about selling this
vehicle,'' Hugger said.
