   Martin F.C. Emmett, in his first major appointments since becoming chairman and chief executive officer of Tambrands Inc., hired two executives with experience at consumer products maker RJR Nabisco Inc., his employer until 1983. 

   Charles J. Chapman was named executive vice president of Tambrands and president of its feminine protection division in the U.S. and Canada. 
Raymond F. Wright joined as senior vice president and chief financial officer. 

   Most recently Mr. Chapman, 50 years old, was a principal in Spectrum Group, an investment firm. 
He resigned as president of Nabisco Brands North America in an October 1987 realignment of the division. 
RJR Nabisco was taken private in a leveraged buy-out led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. earlier this year. 

   Mr. Wright, also 50, succeeds Peter J. Perkinson, who resigned. 
Mr. Perkinson couldn't be reached for comment. 
Mr. Wright had been senior vice president of finance at Nabisco's international division. 

   Before his Nabisco posts, Mr. Chapman was a group vice president of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc., heading various divisions including health and beauty products and packaged foods. 
At Pond's, "He was very highly regarded. 
Despite the onslaught of competition, he expanded the product line and did very well," says Deepak Raj, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst. 

   Mr. Wright's appointment signals a push toward tighter cost controls at the company, analysts said. 
One person close to the company said overhead could be reduced 20% at Tambrands. 

   Mr. Emmett became chairman and chief executive officer of Tambrands in April after Edwin H. Shutt Jr. resigned, amid criticism that the company wasn't successful in expanding much beyond its mainstay product, tampons. 
Russell Sprague, the retired chairman, returned to the top post on an interim basis about two months. 
Mr. Emmett most recently worked as an investment banker, heading a unit of Security Pacific Corp.
