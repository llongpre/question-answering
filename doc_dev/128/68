   Brian Bowler, president and chief executive officer of
Porsche AG's struggling U.S. operations, resigned Friday
because of "differences over the direction of the company's
future efforts in the U.S. market."
   Mr. Bowler declined to specify the nature of the
differences.

   Immediately following Mr. Bowler's resignation, Porsche
Cars North America Inc., Reno, Nev., named Frederick J.
Schwab, 52 years old and formerly senior executive vice
president of Porsche's U.S. operations, to succeed Mr.
Bowler.
   Mr. Bowler's abrupt resignation may be fallout from the
full-blown battle being waged on Porsche's home front in
Frankfurt, Germany. The Porsche family wants Porsche to
remain a maker of upscale, highly exclusive cars, while Arno
Bohn, Porsche's chairman, wants to broaden the product line
to include lower-priced luxury cars, according to reports in
Automotive News, a trade publication.
   "Porsche is at a point where it must make a strategic
decision," said auto analyst Susan Jacobs of Jacobs
Automotive, a car consulting concern in Little Falls, N.J.
"But either direction carries a lot of risk."
   In the mid-1980s, Porsche bailed out of the higher-volume,
lower end of the luxury-car segment. In 1984, the price of a
Porsche ranged between $21,440 and $44,000. But last year,
$44,000 was the starting price for a Porsche, and the prices
range up to $95,000.
   Partly as a result, Porsche's sales in the U.S. have
skidded 85% since the 1986 peak of 30,471 cars. In 1991 it
sold 4,388 cars in the U.S. -- about half of the 9,122 sold
in 1990.
   But returning to the under-$40,000 market won't be easy.
That end of the luxury turf is now crowded with new
contenders, such as Toyota Motor Corp.'s Lexus division,
Nissan Motor Co.'s Infiniti models and Honda Motor Co.'s
Acura car line.
   Still, it's unclear which side of the dispute Mr. Bowler
is on. "I don't think it would be appropriate to discuss" the
reasons for leaving, said Mr. Bowler, 51, who was reached at
his home Friday.
   Porsche officials also are silent about the specific
nature of the dispute with Mr. Bowler. But a Porsche
spokesman denied rumors that the company is considering
abandoning the U.S. market as France's Peugeot S.A. and
Britain's Rover Group PLC's Sterling Motor Cars did late last
year. "There is no question that the parent company is
committed to the U.S. market," the spokesman said. "Porsche
is remaining in the U.S."
   Mr. Bowler declined to discuss his future plans. He began
his automotive career in 1967 at Germany's Volkswagen AG. He
left Volkswagen in the mid-1980s, to head DDB Needham
Worldwide Inc.'s Troy, Mich., office. At the advertising
agency, he oversaw the Volkswagen and Audi ad accounts. In
1988, he left DDB to join Porsche.
   Mr. Schwab left Fruehauf Corp., a truck trailer maker, as
executive vice president of international operations in 1985
to become executive vice president of Porsche Cars North
America.
