   Lotus Development Corp. said that Irfan Salim resigned as a vice president, raising questions about management stability and the progress of the spreadsheet marketing operation he headed. 

   The company's stock fell as investors worried that Mr. Salim's departure might indicate a further delay in the updating of Lotus 1-2-3, the product that accounts for about two-thirds of Lotus's revenue. 
Lotus closed at $20.50, down 75 cents, in heavy national over-the-counter trading. 

   Lotus said Mr. Salim, 35 years old, resigned for personal reasons and that his departure didn't reflect any operational problems at the company. 
A spokesman said Lotus still expects to introduce 1-2-3 Release 3.0, the updated version of its popular spreadsheet, in the fourth quarter. 

   Mr. Salim is the fifth Lotus vice president to leave since last March. 
The first was Charles Digate, a senior vice president and one of the company's highest ranking executives. 
He resigned over "differences in operating philosophies" with Lotus's domineering chairman, Jim P. Manzi. 
Lotus has 17 vice presidents. 

   At the time of Mr. Digate's resignation, Lotus said it hadn't changed plans for a midyear introduction of the updated 1-2-3, but a week later it delayed the product to the fourth quarter, causing its stock to plummet 11% in a day. 
Lotus hired Frank King III, 48, who had been vice president for development at International Business Machines Corp.'s personal computer group, to succeed Mr. Digate as head of the software products group. 

   Mr. Salim, who had been hired to head international operations by Mr. Digate, was brought to the U.S. from Britain last November to head spreadsheet marketing. 
Mr. Salim couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Michelle Preston, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, said, "I don't think it should be all that surprising. 
Salim was a Digate guy." 
She added, "Frank King is probably making a lot of changes." 
Lotus said that spreadsheet marketing operations will report directly to Mr. King until the new version of 1-2-3 is shipped. 

   Analysts say that Lotus appears to have done a good job maintaining 1-2-3's dominant market position despite the delayed update which some feared would cause customer defections. 
"We haven't seen any precipitous decline in their revenues," said Ms. Preston. 

   Most corporate customers have said they are willing to wait for Lotus to upgrade the product in order to ensure compatibility with the millions of 1-2-3 spreadsheets already installed. 
However, it isn't clear how long they will wait before considering other recently introduced spreadsheets such as Microsoft Corp.'s Excel or Borland International Inc.'s Quattro. 

   Lotus insiders and some of those who have left said the pattern of resignations isn't unusual as fast-growing high technology companies reach the $500 million sales level, which analysts expect Lotus to reach this year. 
"It's natural for a company like Lotus to have this kind of transition," Mr. Digate said in an interview. 
"People who are entrepreneurial in nature are going to do it again." 

   In addition, Lotus employees are vested in certain benefit plans after four years with the company. 
Those benefits become effective at the end of July and the end of February, one source said, contributing to the clustering of resignations. 

   In recent weeks, Palmer True, vice president of manufacturing, retired and Donald McLagen, vice president of information services, resigned. 
Other recent resignations included Gregory Jarboe, director of corporate communications; Randall Wise, director of in-house PC services; and John Shagoury, director of sales and distribution. 
All went to smaller, newer companies. 

   Moreover, employees outside the spreadsheet operations worry that for the next 18 months Lotus will focus its attention on maintaining 1-2-3 and keeping users happy when it is upgraded. 
Michael Kolowich, who resigned as a vice president in April to head PC Computing magazine, a new Ziff Communications Co. publication, said "you have to question how much energy is left for business diversification and products that don't involve spreadsheets." 

   Nevertheless, analysts say it is important for Lotus to find additional sources of revenue and become less reliant on 1-2-3.
