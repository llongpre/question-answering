   A former top aide to impeached Gov. Evan
Mecham testified today that she called a newspaper after she was
told a state official had threatened her life in hopes that she
would be safe if the matter were public.
   Donna Carlson, former special assistant to the first-term
Republican governor, also said that shortly after Mecham took
office in January 1987 he asked her to keep notes on conversations
with legislators ``so that it might be used against them in the
elections if he chose to use it.''
   She said she did not do so because she thought it would be
improper, and said her job at times was ``like a three-ring
circus.''
   Director of Public Safety Ralph Milstead has accused Mecham of
ordering him not to cooperate with an investigation of the alleged
Nov. 12 threat against Ms. Carlson by Lee Watkins, former head of
state prison construction.
   At the time, Ms. Carlson had resigned from the governor's staff
and was about to testify before a state grand jury that was
investigating Mecham's failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Mecham is accused of trying to thwart an investigation of the
alleged death threat.
   Watkins refused to testify last week, citing his Fifth Amendment
right against self-incrimination, but has previously denied
threatening Ms. Carlson's life.
   Ms. Carlson spoke softly today as she described how Milstead
told her on Nov. 14 that Watkins had threatened her.
   Ms. Carlson testified that Milstead telephoned and ``told me
that there had been a threat made against me by Lee Watkins ... and
it was something to the effect that if I didn't stop talking I
would end up in the bottom of a river.''
   ``I didn't say anything; I was taken aback,'' she said. ``It's
kind of a shock.''
   Ms. Carlson testified that she was upset and called a newspaper
reporter and told him about the alleged threat after a friend
advised her that the best thing for her safety might be to make the
matter public.
   Ms. Carlson said she had previously expressed doubts about
Watkins to both Mecham and then-chief of staff Jim Colter when she
learned that Watkins had a criminal record.
   She said Colter told her, ``We have to take care of Lee. He
raised a lot of money for the campaign.''
   On Tuesday Watkins' attorney, Dale Anderson, testified that a
top Mecham aide helped craft a lie-detector test so Watkins could
pass it.
   Also Tuesday, Arizona Supreme Court Chief Justice Frank X.
Gordon Jr., presiding over the Senate trial, decided to bar further
testimony challenging Milstead's credibility.
   Mecham appointed Max Hawkins, then director of the state
Department of Administration and Watkins' boss, to investigate the
alleged death threat.
   Anderson testified that after his client failed four polygraphs,
Hawkins suggested having the polygraph operator ``figure out what
kind of questions could be asked so my client could answer these
questions and get his job back.''
   Anderson said it was not unusual to choreograph a lie detector
test.
   ``You shop for polygraphers and you shop for questions,'' he
said.
   The trial was scheduled to continue today with testimony from
Donna Carlson, target of the alleged threat. At the time, Ms.
Carlson was preparing to testify before the state grand jury about
Mecham's failure to report a $350,000 campaign loan.
   Prosecutor Paul Eckstein said the polygrapher, Manuel
Valenzuela, also may be called to testify before the prosecution
closes its case on the first of three charges against the
first-term Republican governor.
   In addition to the alleged death threat and loan matters, Mecham
is accused of misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund by
loaning it to his auto dealership.
   Watkins was placed on administrative leave last November after
he was accused of telling another state official that if Ms.
Carlson didn't keep her mouth shut about the $350,000 loan she
``could take a long boat ride.''
   A transcript of a tape-recorded Nov. 12 conversation between
Anderson and Hawkins was released Tuesday and quotes Hawkins as
saying he wanted polygraph test results that would allow him to
reinstate Watkins.
   ``I love Lee and I want to save his ass,'' the transcript quotes
Hawkins as saying. ``I believe he is getting railroaded.''
   The transcript quotes Hawkins as suggesting the polygraph
operator ask, ``What did Lee say he said? And then he just writes
that down. ... Then the polygraph (operator) says he (Watkins) made
this statement. Is it true?''
   On Nov. 20, Hawkins announced Watkins would be reinstated but
refused to release the polygraph results. At the time, Hawkins said
he knew little beyond the fact that Anderson told him that Watkins
had passed the test.
   Watkins resigned his state job, and Hawkins was fired last week
by acting Gov. Rose Mofford, a Democrat who took over when the
House impeached Mecham on Feb. 5.
   Much of Tuesday's questioning by defense lawyer Fred Craft
centered on use of state vehicles by Milstead, Arizona's
highest-ranking lawman, and his relationship with a woman who
claimed she had an affair with him.
   After Milstead's testimony, Gordon said he would allow no more
testimony about these matters.
   ``You have made your point,'' Gordon told Craft. ``You have
established that Director Milstead had a motive for testifying
against the governor,'' including the knowledge that Mecham wanted
to fire him.
   Under questioning by Craft, Milstead denied paying for the
woman's meals or staying overnight at her home after driving there
in a state vehicle. Prosecutor William French contended the
questioning was ``cross-examination by innuendo'' and was improper.
   Mecham is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in six decades
and the first ever in Arizona. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member
Senate is required to remove him, and lawmakers also could vote to
bar him from future public office.
   Mecham also faces a March 22 criminal trial on charges of
concealing the $350,000 loan and a May 17 recall election.
