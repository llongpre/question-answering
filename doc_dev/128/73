   A former aide to Gov. Evan Mecham
testified Wednesday at Mecham's impeachment trial that an official
accused of threatening her enjoyed special status because of his
fund-raising for Mecham.
   Donna Carlson, Mecham's former special assistant for legislative
affairs, said that when she once complained about Lee Watkins'
position in the governor's inner circle, she was told by Mecham's
then chief of staff: ``We have to take care of Lee. He raised a lot
of money for the campaign.''
   The former chief of staff, Jim Colter, did not immediately
return a telephone message left by The Associated Press.
   Mecham is accused of obstructing the state attorney general's
investigation of the alleged threat by Watkins on Ms. Carlson's
life in November as she was about to testify before a grand jury
investigating Mecham's campaign finances.
   After Ms. Carlson's testimony Wednesdsay and the showing of
videotaped comments by Mecham, the prosecution rested its case on
the obstruction charge, and the Senate voted down, 25-4, a defense
motion to dismiss the count.
   The presiding officer directed the defense to begin presenting
its case.
   The governor also is accused concealing a $350,000 campaign loan
and misusing $80,000 in state money by loaning it to his car
dealership.
   Mecham has not attended the proceedings, but senators Wednesday
were shown a Nov. 16 TV interview in which Mecham denied knowledge
of the alleged death threat.
   Prosecution witnesses have testified that Mecham had been told
of the alleged threat and had directed an aide to investigate
several days before the interview.
   Mecham, a 63-year-old first-term Republican, is the first U.S.
governor to be impeached in six decades.
   It would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate to convict him.
The senators could then take another vote to bar him from holding
state office again.
   Mecham also faces a criminal trial on charges of concealing the
$350,000 loan and a recall election May 17. On Wednesday the trial
was rescheduled, from March 22 to April 21.
   Ms. Carlson, who said she took the reported threat on her life
seriously because Watkins has a criminal record, told the Senate
that neither Mecham nor any of his close aides ever called to
inquire about her safety in light of the threat.
   ``I felt very alone,'' she said.
   She said she believed her only protection then was to go to the
news media with word of the threat and ``let the world know about
it.'' She said she was the source of an Arizona Republic story that
first reported the alleged threat on her life.
   Watkins, who previously denied threatening Ms. Carlson, last
week refused to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment rights against
self-incrimination. The former chief of prison construction
resigned in January after it was disclosed that he did not report a
1966 assault conviction to the state.
   On Friday, Corrections Director Sam Lewis testified that Watkins
told him in June 1987 the Mecham administration owed Watkins a job
because ``the more that you raise for the campaign, the higher
level job you received in state government.''
   Lewis also testified Watkins told him ``he had enough
(information) that he could bring the entire administration down.''
   Ms. Carlson worked for Mecham's election and became one of his
closest advisers before resigning in a dispute over official
policies and appointments.
   She said her emnity with Watkins dated back to the early days of
Mecham's administration when she warned the governor to ``be very
careful'' of associating himself with Watkins, who had been the
subject of negative newspaper articles.
   However, she said she didn't learn until last September of
Watkins' criminal record. In 1959, he was convicted at age 19 of
the robbery of a post office and served time in a federal youth
offender correctional facility. He was convicted of assault in 1966.
   She said she was upset that the information had come to the
governor's staff so late and complained to Department of Public
Safety Director Ralph Milstead.
   ``He said the information had been sent to the governor in
January or February,'' she testified.
   Ms. Carlson said it was Milstead who informed her of the threat
on her life three days after it allegedly was made in November.
