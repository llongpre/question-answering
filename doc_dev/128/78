   The Bush administration flunked its first world
trade test by caving in to pressure from abroad and cutting back on
duty levels for imported sport utility vehicles and vans, critics
say.
   At issue was a decision Thursday in which the Treasury Department
scaled back a Customs Service ruling and said only some foreign-made
sport utility vehicles and vans will be reclassified as trucks.
   The Customs Service in January had said it would classify all the
vehicles as trucks, upon which a 25 percent duty is imposed, rather
than as cars, subject to a 2.5 percent duty.
   After Thursday's reversal, U.S. carmakers and members of Congress
from auto-making states said the Bush administration let itself be
swayed by foreign lobbyists.
   ``The Bush administration clearly caved in to pressure from the
Japanese,'' said Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich. ``This decision hurts
America _ it costs us money and jobs.''
   Michigan's other senator, Democrat Carl Levin, saw it the same
way: ``In its first major action on trade, the Bush administration
has put the wrong foot forward.''
   The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association, which represents
domestic carmakers, said the original ruling to boost duties had
been the correct one.
   ``The Customs Service ought to decide U.S. trade practices, not
foreign manufacturers,'' the association said.
   Foreign automakers were more conciliatory, but said none of the
affected vehicles should be subject to 25 percent duties, which they
characterized as a new tax by the ``no-new-taxes'' president.
   They also raised the specter of higher sticker prices on both
imported and domestic sport utility vehicles and vans.
   Toyota Motor Sales USA congratulated Treasury ``for courage in
the face of massive political pressure from Detroit'' but said none
of the vehicles should be classified as trucks.
   Curt Bartsch, a spokesman for Nissan Motor Corp. in USA, said the
Treasury ruling ``reduces but does not eliminate the economic harm
brought by the tax.''
   Laura Segall, speaking for American Suzuki Motor Corp., said the
ruling ``probably will mean overall more expensive sport-utility
vehicles being imported, which will be followed by more expensive
domestic sport-utility vehicles.''
   The Treasury Department, meanwhile, characterized its decision as
a technical matter based on ``legal classification issues'' rather
than a reflection of U.S. trade policy.
   Under past policy, the vehicles sometimes were considered cars
and sometimes were classified as trucks, depending on whether they
were fitted with back seats and other amenities. Forty-four percent
of the 239,000 affected vehicles imported last year were classified
as trucks.
   Under the plan announced Thursday, four-door sport-utility
vehicles will be classified as cars and two-door models will be
considered trucks. Vans will be considered cars if they feature rear
seats, rear windows and rear doors.
   Treasury officials said that had the same policy been in effect
last year, 66 percent of affected vehicles would have been
classified as trucks, bringing in another $83 million in duties.
