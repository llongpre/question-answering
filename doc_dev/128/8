   The maker of the Suzuki Samurai took the
offense in a battle over the vehicle's safety, disputing the
validity of tests by Consumer Reports magazine that found the
Samurai dangerously prone to roll over.
   The tests by Consumers Union, the magazine's publisher,
apparently were intended to persuade the government to adopt new
stability standards for sport-utility vehicles like the Samurai,
Suzuki executive Doug Mazza said Thursday.
   ``The Suzuki Samurai has been falsely accused, and it does not
have a design error,'' Mazza said. ``We have absolute confidence in
its safety record and road-worthiness in the United States.''
   Calling the test results ``inaccurate and defamatory,'' Mazza,
vice president of Brea-based American Suzuki Motor Corp., said the
company was considering a lawsuit against Consumers Union.
   Consumers Union stands by its tests, said David Berliner,
assistant director of the non-profit organization based in Mount
Vernon, N.Y. He denied the tests were intended to influence federal
regulations.
   Consumers Union said last week the Samurai rolled over in abrupt
maneuvers because it is too tall for its small wheelbase. Similar
vehicles passed the test. The group called for the immediate recall
of all 160,000 Samurais on U.S. roads and reimbursement of their
owners.
   But Mazza said government accident statistics, along with tests
conducted by an automotive engineering consultant for Suzuki, show
the four-wheel-drive vehicle is safe under typical driving
conditions, safer than some other vehicles of its type.
   At simultaneous news conferences in New York, Detroit and Los
Angeles, Mazza showed films of Samurais passing a number of what
were described as rigorous tests of the car's ability to stay
upright.
   ``For years the Consumers Union has been pressing the government
for an unrealistic rollover standard,'' Mazza said. ``What better
way than pressing the smallest Japanese automaker with the No. 1
selling sport-utility vehicle?''
   Publicity about the Consumers Union tests is expected to cut
Samurai sales, Mazza said, adding that the company has boosted its
advertising budget by $1.5 million a week to counter consumer fears
raised by the tests. The $8,500 vehicle is promoted as a fun car
for the youth market.
   Suzuki's auto engineering consultant, Jon McKibben of Irvine,
said it appeared the Consumers Union test driver deliberately
turned the Samurai more sharply than other sport-utility vehicles
in the obstacle-avoidance test. Sport-utility vehicles are
Jeep-like light trucks.
   McKibben acknowledged that he knew of the test only by watching
a videotape of it.
   Berliner of the Consumers Union responded: ``We never suggested
that the Samurai will turn over every time a driver swerves to
avoid an obstacle in the road. We said that its design creates
enough chance of that happening to the typical driver that it poses
an unacceptable risk.''
   The Samurais in the Consumers Union tests may have been made
unstable by 300-pound ``outriggers'' bolted to the cars to keep
them from rolling over completely, McKibben said.
   However, Consumers Union contends the outriggers actually should
make the vehicles more stable.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said there
have been 44 reported incidents of Samurais rolling over, involving
53 injuries and 16 deaths.
   Consumers Union filed a petition with the NHTSA seeking rules
requiring that sport-utility vehicles be put through road tests for
safety, rather than just requiring them to meet design standards.
   Suzuki said its study of federal statistics on fatal accidents
found that in the last two years, there were three fatal accidents
in which a Samurai may have rolled over on a relatively flat
surface. In two of those cases, the drivers had been drinking and
none of the victims wore seat belts, McKibben said.
