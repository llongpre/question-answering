   Ian Diery, executive vice president of troubled Wang Laboratories Inc., and once the company's most powerful executive outside the Wang family, resigned. 

   Mr. Diery had been expected to quit since Wang reported a record $424.3 million net loss for the year ended June 30 and Wang president Frederick A. Wang was forced to resign by his father, chairman and chief executive officer An Wang. 

   Mr. Diery, 39 years old, was blamed by Frederick Wang and other Wang insiders for making the optimistic sales forecasts that led the company to maintain its huge and costly sales and administrative staffs in the face of declining sales. 
Wang sharply expanded its short-term debt, expecting to repay it with the higher sales that Mr. Diery forecast. 
Instead, sales turned down, leading to Wang's current problems, which include being in default on its debt and at loggerheads with its banks as it tries to negotiate a new borrowing agreement. 

   Mr. Diery, a bluff, dynamic Australian, had led Wang's highly successful European sales operations. 
He was brought to the U.S. in 1986 and put in charge of U.S. sales in Frederick Wang's first action after he became president. 
Mr. Diery steadily expanded his role and Wang's 1988 proxy statement shows he was paid $431,986, only $1,000 less than Frederick Wang. 

   An Wang, 69, remains chairman and chief executive of Wang and the key decision maker. 
He has been working half days as he recovers from a July operation for cancer of the esophagus, which is often fatal. 

   As previously reported, Harry H.S. Chou, 66-year-old vice chairman, is acting president while the board of directors searches for a new president. 
The three sales vice presidents who had reported to Mr. Diery will report to Mr. Chou. 
Marketing executives who once reported to Mr. Diery had recently been shifted to report to Horace Tsiang, executive vice president and chief development officer. 

   Mr. Diery couldn't be reached for comment. 
In a prepared statement, An Wang said Mr. Diery "contributed substantially to the growth and success of Wang Laboratories." 
Apparently trying to focus attention away from Mr. Diery, Wang headlined its announcement of his departure: "Wang Laboratories reorganizes sales and marketing operations."
