<BYLINE>Nixon: Quayle No `Intellectual Midget'

   Dan Quayle is not the ``intellectual midget''
portrayed by the news media, says former President Richard M. Nixon.
   When the vice president-elect and the man who also was vice
president for eight years talked for the first time on Monday, they
discussed U.S.-Soviet relations, arms control negotiations between
the two superpowers and the role of the vice presidency.
   After the meeting, Nixon pronounced Quayle a man of intelligence
and dedication and said he'll be ``an excellent vice president.''
   ``I was very surprised. He is a very different man from the
intellectual midget who has been portrayed among the media,'' Nixon
told reporters at an impromptu news conference.
   He said the two had met before but ``this is the first time I had
a chance to have a talk with Senator Quayle.''
   ``This is a man who has strong views. He's highly intelligent.
He's highly dedicated,'' Nixon said.
   During their meeting, which lasted just over 90 minutes, Nixon
advised Quayle on the vice presidency, a post Nixon held from 1953
to 1961 under former President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
   Nixon was elected president in 1968, serving until his
resignation in August 1974 in the wake of the Watergate scandal.
   ``The important thing for the vice president is to recognize that
his responsibility is to serve the interest of the country _ and
that means to serve the interest of the president,'' Nixon said.
   The advice he gave to Quayle was to ``follow the example of
George Bush. He's been a very successful vice president and it's
important that you follow his example in your handling of the
position.''
   Nixon refused to provide details of their foreign policy
discussion but said he and Quayle ``happen to share views ... that
are frankly a little inconsistent with some of the conventional
wisdom with regard to Soviet-American relations.''
   In September, Quayle questioned recent Soviet reforms, saying
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev wasn't very different from former
Kremlin leader Leonid Brezhnev and suggested that perestroika is
``nothing more than refined Stalinism.''
   Nixon, who chose not to define his views, did urge the new
administration to ``develop a diplomatic offensive to counter the
diplomatic offensive of Gorbachev.''
   The former president said he was confident that Bush would
succeed in arms control negotiations with the Soviets and also had
praise for Quayle in that area.
   ``At the present time I cannot think of six other senators who
know as much about the complexities of arms control as Senator Dan
Quayle,'' Nixon said. ``He will be a great asset to the
administration on this very important subject when it is considered
during the next administration.''
   Nixon also applauded Bush's recent administration appointments,
including the selection of New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu as White
House chief of staff.
   ``As I look at him, he's highly intelligent. He's very tough,''
Nixon said of Sununu. ``I think he's going to break some china but
he's a shrewd enough politician that he'll know how to put the china
together again.''
