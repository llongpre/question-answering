   Sales of the Suzuki Samurai plunged 70.6 percent
in June from a year earlier, the automaker said Wednesday in its
first sales report since Consumers Union charged that the vehicle
tips over too easily.
   American Suzuki Motor Corp. said it sold 2,199 Samurais in June,
down from 7,479 in June 1987.
   June's sales were the lowest since December 1985, the month
after the car's U.S. introduction. Sales had been running at more
than 6,000 a month from March through May.
   The dramatic decline demonstrated the influence of Consumers
Union as well as the impact of television news, which showed clips
of the Samurai tipping over onto its outriggers in test runs.
   Suzuki said it was not surprised by the decline and expected
sales to increase in coming months. A spokesman said ``Suzuki
continued to express absolute confidence in the safety of the
Samurai.''
   Asked for comment, Consumers Union spokesman David Berliner
said, ``If it is a reflection in any way of the public giving
credence to our findings, then I think that is a good sign.''
   Consumers Union, the non-profit publisher of Consumer Reports
magazine based in Mount Vernon, has said Suzuki should recall the
vehicle and give refunds to owners.
   Consumers Union said June 2 that the Samurai tends to roll over
when the driver swerves to avoid an accident. It gave the vehicle
its first ``not acceptable'' rating in 10 years.
   Suzuki said Consumers Union's testing procedures ``biased and
completely inaccurate.''
   Suzuki is ``not at this time planning on withdrawing'' the
Samurai from the market in response to the poor June sales, said
Rob Cahn, a representative of the company's public relations
agency, Rogers &amp; Associates. He said that had been the company's
position from the beginning.
   The Samurai passed the ordinary Consumers Union test. It flunked
only when the obstacle course was made more challenging.
   The four-wheel-drive Samurai has a high center of gravity, a
narrow tread width, a short wheelbase and light weight. Consumers
Union said that combination made the vehicle inherently flawed, but
Suzuki said the design was sound and cited statistics showing the
Samurai had a good safety record.
   Suzuki said almost any vehicle can be made to tip over, but
television highlights of the Samurai test runs apparently unnerved
many potential customers.
   For the first six months of 1988, Samurai sales were down to
31,221 from 42,912 a year earlier, according to American Suzuki,
the Brea, Calif.-based subsidiary of Japan's Suzuki Motor Co. Ltd.
   The boxy Samurai became a best-seller almost immediately after
its introduction in the United States in November 1985, taking some
business away from larger and more expensive cousins, such as the
Jeep Wrangler, Jeep Cherokee and Isuzu Trooper II.
   Sales had already begun to slow down from their torrid 1987 pace
earlier this year, in part because of allegations by the Center for
Auto Safety about the Samurai's propensity to roll over.
