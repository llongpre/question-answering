   Former Gov. Evan Mecham says his
impeachment conviction was unfair and he'll go to court in a bid to
get his job back.
   ``We think that it's important to challenge this,'' Mecham said
Friday.
   Leaving the conviction unchallenged would open all public
officials to impeachment, Mecham said, adding, ``Who knows? You may
see me back on the ninth floor (the governor's office) before the
next election.''
   The former governor on Friday also delivered a harsh attack on
Arizona Sen. John McCain, saying he is dishonest and is not
qualified to be vice president.
   McCain, a first-term senator who called for Mecham's resignation
in January, has been among those mentioned as a possible running
mate for Vice President George Bush, the certain GOP nominee.
   ``No, John isn't qualified to be vice president,'' Mecham said
in an interview with KTSP-TV. ``He doesn't have the intellect, he
doesn't have the stature, he doesn't have the honesty, he doesn't
have the character that it takes, and he certainly doesn't have the
political foundation.''
   McCain, who was speaking Friday night in Watertown, S.D., on
Bush's behalf, said, ``Former Governor Mecham is entitled to his
opinion. ... Nothing surprises me.''
   McCain said he was not seeking the vice presidential nomination,
noting that other qualified candidates come from states with more
electoral votes. The senator has said he backs Sen. Nancy
Kassebaum, R-Kan., for the GOP second spot.
   Both Mecham and McCain are members of the Arizona delegation to
the national GOP convention in New Orleans Aug. 15-18.
   Mecham was convicted April 4 by the Senate on impeachment
charges of misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocol fund and
trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat. He
was acquitted June 16 on criminal charges of concealing a $350,000
campaign loan.
   Mecham was the first U.S. governor to be impeached and removed
from office in 59 years.
   The former governor said he probably would take his challenge to
to federal court, although the decision will be up to his lawyers.
He also said it was uncertain how soon it will be filed.
