   Scor U.S. Corp. said Pierre D. Croizat, president, and Francois M. Chavel, executive vice president, resigned from the French-controlled reinsurance company. 

   Separately, the company posted a 17% drop in third-quarter net income, compared with strong year-earlier results. 

   Succeeding Mr. Croizat is Jacques P. Blondeau, who recently joined the French parent, SCOR Paris, from Pechiney Group, a French company where he was chairman and president of Australian operations. 

   Also, Francois Negrier, vice chairman of the U.S. unit and president of the parent, was named interim president of Scor Re, the operating reinsurance subsidiary of the U.S. unit. 
The post had been held by Mr. Croizat. 
No successor was immediately named for the executive vice president post. 

   "Those were genuine resignations," not firings, Michael Smith, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., said. 
There was a "personality mismatch" between New York and Paris, the analyst said. 

   "I have sensed a certain amount of friction between the New York office and the Paris office," about different markets that Scor U.S. might enter, he said. 

   A spokesman for Scor U.S. said the departure was a "very amiable arrangement." 
He added, "I have no idea what these two gentlemen plan to do." 
Messrs. 
Croizat and Chavel couldn't be reached. 

   Third-quarter net fell to $4.6 million, or 37 cents a share, from $5.5 million, or 43 cents a share. 
Revenue rose 26% to $32.4 million from $25.8 million. 

   Scor Paris, which owns two-thirds of the company, took it public in 1986 and has seen disappointing results from the unit's stock since the offering. 

   Scor U.S., which closed at $8.25 a share, up 12.5 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, has traded at only about 80% of book value, according to Mr. Smith. 

   The analyst took the stock off his own "recommended" list after yesterday's announcement because of the uncertainty that comes with new management. 
Right now, he noted, the company "seems to be on track in terms of underwriting."
