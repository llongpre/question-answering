<TEXT>     Agnew, who resigned in disgrace in 1973 after pleading no contest to tax
evasion, is the only former vice president missing from the gallery of carved
figures that represents the men who toiled a heartbeat away from being chief
executive. Even the bust of the most recent former vice president -- George
Bush -- waits in storage for its pedestal.;    Across from Mondale's bust is
the visage of his predecessor, Nelson Rockefeller, on a brown marble stand
next to the likeness of Gerald Ford, Agnew's successor. But on the other side
of the tiled hallway sits the bust of Theodore Roosevelt. And next to the
Mondale bust is an antique wooden clock.;    The likeness of the former
Maryland governor, the first vice president to resign under legal fire, is
nowhere to be found on two floors of statuary decorating the place where vice
presidents have served as presidents of the Senate.;    In "The Capitol," a
picture book published by the Government Printing Office, page after page
shows marble busts. For Agnew's entry, there is a snapshot and the caption,
"pending.";    UNDER a Senate resolution passed in 1898, the architect of the
Capitol or the chairman of the Senate Rules Committee contacts the vice
president -- or his family -- after he leaves office for the commission of a
formal bust.;    "I don't know what the reason is. I guess we're waiting for
the family or the committee," said William F. Raines Jr., a spokesman for the
architect of the Capitol, acknowledging that Agnew is the only one among the
43 former vice presidents whose bust has not been commissioned.;    "It's
generally handled by the architect's office," said Jim King, a spokesman for
the Senate Rules Committee.;    The subject of an Agnew bust comes up "from
time to time, when something might happen on that," Raines said. "We don't
have anything in the Agnew file." He added quickly, "We don't even have a file
on that.";    George M. White, architect of the Capitol since 1971, said the
staff or family of the last several vice presidents called his office to start
the process.;    "It's probably as much my neglect as theirs," said White, who
blamed his lack of initiative on other Capitol chores.;    Agnew, a
businessman now living in Southern California, could not be reached for
comment, but Rep. Helen Delich Bentley, R-Md., believes that the former vice
president has been snubbed.;    'H E hasn't been treated fairly," said
Bentley, a former U.S. maritime commissioner. "He did step down, true, and he
was under pressure. We need to look at the whole picture. Others who have been
in that position have been under fire.";    Not only under fire but fired
upon. The nation's third vice president, Aaron Burr, was charged by New Jersey
and New York for shooting Alexander Hamilton in a duel but was never brought
to trial. He also was tried on treason charges but was acquitted.;    Schuyler
Colfax, vice president from 1869 to 1873, was deeply implicated in a bribery
scandal but remained in office after the House of Representatives declined to
start impeachment proceedings.;    Both men are memorialized by marble busts,
as is former Vice President Richard Nixon, whose bust was completed in 1965 --
long before Watergate -- and is prominently displayed outside a Senate chamber
door.;    White denied that there was any deliberate effort to block the
commissioning of an Agnew bust. "Not on my part, and I'm the one who's
supposed to do it," he said.;    When White was asked whether he would contact
the former vice president about a bust, he said, "Now that you mention it, I
probably should."  </TEXT>
