   NEW YORK -- The dollar declined late yesterday, as the
currency market reacted to the resignation of White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu by pulling the dollar to its
intraday low against the mark.
   Late in New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.6090 marks,
down from 1.6135 marks late Monday in New York. The U.S.
currency also was trading at 129.35 yen, down from 130.16
yen, while sterling was at $1.7750, up from $1.7725.

   Early Wednesday in Tokyo, the dollar was trading at 129.10
yen, down a bit from Tokyo's close Tuesday of 129.30 yen, and
at 1.6085 marks, down from 1.6126 marks at Tuesday's close.
   The dollar spent a quiet day yesterday in a modest
downtrend until the White House announced that President Bush
had accepted Mr. Sununu's resignation, effective Dec. 15. The
resignation, while not unexpected, could signal that Bush is
shaking up his domestic advisory staff ahead of next year's
presidential election campaign.
   The announcement pushed the dollar from levels just above
1.6100 marks to its low of the session. A currency trader at
the Bank of Boston in Boston described the market as "fairly
bored" before the Sununu news hit traders' screens.
   "The whole market appears to have slipped into this
holiday mood," said Betsy Reetz, an assistant vice president
at Union Bank of Switzerland.
   Traders indicated the market is likely to be slow until
Friday's release of the November U.S. employment report.
"There doesn't seem to be any interest," said Bill Bertha,
vice president and manager of foreign exchange at Mellon Bank
N.A. in Pittsburgh.
   "It's deathly dull ahead of the non-farm payroll report
Friday," said Alan Ruskin, an economist at IDEA, an
analytical service in New York.
   Larry Ryan, senior vice president and foreign exchange
manager at Creditanstalt Bankverein in New York, said the
market appears to be holding onto whatever gains it has made
this year and isn't likely to react sharply to the employment
numbers.
   "Except for a brief flurry, I don't think it's going to
move a whole lot," Mr. Ryan said.
   The dollar started to soften late in the North American
day on comments by Bundesbank President Helmut Schlesinger,
who told a Swiss newspaper that Germany can't afford lower
interest rates now because of high money-supply growth.
   The interview, a German-language version of one that
appeared Sunday in an Italian paper, is to be published today
in the Swiss paper Finanz &amp; Wirtschaft.
   Ms. Reetz at Union Bank called the Schlesinger report "the
most important news all day."
   "It's interesting that he's even thinking about lower
interest rates," IDEA's Mr. Ruskin said. Traders have been
suggesting that the Bundesbank's policy-making Central Bank
Council might even tighten rates at its bi-weekly meeting
tomorrow.
   Mr. Ruskin said there is a chance the Bundesbank might
review its targets for money-supply growth. Such growth is
currently 4.8%, at the upper end of the Bundesbank's 3% to 5%
range.
   U.S. economic data released yesterday were generally
positive, and the dollar drew some support from the October
index of leading economic indicators, which posted a gain of
0.1%, compared with a 0.1% drop in September.
   In addition, U.S. single-family home sales were up 2.2% to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 513,000. Both reports
were "bang on market expectations," Mr. Ruskin said, with the
result that the market remained more or less flat.
   But comments by Michael Boskin, chairman of the
President's Council of Economic Advisors, later nudged the
dollar lower.
   Mr. Boskin said he expects the economy to remain sluggish
for the next few months and that the U.S. Federal Reserve had
"ample room" to act to stimulate the economy without
prompting a return to inflation.
