<HEAD>House Favors Normal U.S.-Czech Relations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has moved to normalize U.S.
relations with Czechoslovakia for the first time since World War II
and to dramatically reduce tariffs on that nation's exports to the
United States.
   The House, by a voice vote Wednesday night, approved a trade
agreement signed last April by the Bush administration and the
newly elected Prague government under which each country would
grant the other most-favored-nation trade status.
   That status would qualify the exporting country for the lowest
tariffs in effect on the goods it ships to the buying country.
   The agreement is the first U.S. bilateral trade accord with a
former Eastern Bloc country since the Warsaw Pact began collapsing
more than a year ago.
   The Senate also must approve the pact before barriers to trade
with the formerly communist-ruled Czechs are removed.
   President Bush signed the agreement in April but did not send it
to Capitol Hill for congressional approval until last month.
   The accord will effectively reduce by 90 percent the tariffs
paid on some $82 million in Czech exports to the United States last
year and open the way for increased business ties between the two
countries.
   The effect will be to give Czechoslovakia a much broader U.S.
market for its exports by cutting their prices to wholesalers,
retailers and ultimately American consumers by as much as up to 40
percent.
   It also will open the Czech economy to more U.S. exports while
also protecting American companies' patents and copyrights.

<HEAD>Consumer Groups Urge Boycott of Cars Without Air Bags</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three consumer groups want American car buyers
to refuse to buy automobiles not equipped with air bags.
   Motor Voters, the Center for Auto Safety, and the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group staged news conferences and demonstrations
in 12 cities to propose the boycott, focusing their ire on Japanese
economy models.
   Rosemary Dunlap, president of Motor Voters, noted that many
automakers equip only luxury vehicles with air bags, claiming the
$320 devices would drive away bargain hunters.
   She noted that Chrysler has several economy models with driver
air bags as standard equipment. ``If Chrysler can put air bags in a
car for under $8,000, what's Honda's excuse for leaving them out of
the Civic CRX, which costs over $11,000?'' she asked.
   But the groups faulted even Chrysler for not equipping its
popular minivans with air bags, and for not moving more quickly to
make them standard equipment for front-seat passengers in cars.
Chrysler is providing driver-side air bags in virtually all of its
1991 cars.
   Honda has announced it will make air bags standard equipment in
all cars in 1994. Currently, the only Honda-built car sold in the
United States with an air bag is the top-of-the-line Acura Legend.
   According to industry projections for the current model year, 45
percent of Ford's cars and 33 percent of General Motors' cars will
be sold with at least a driver air bag. Six companies, BMW, Isuzu,
Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Saab, and Volvo, equip all their U.S. cars
with air bags, while five others - Hyundai, Peugeot, Suzuki,
Sterling and Yugo - have no such models.
   The figure for Toyota is 27 percent, for Nissan 20 percent, for
Mazda 15 percent, and for Mitsubishi, 1 percent.

<HEAD>Senate Passes Bill To Pay Reparations to Seneca Indians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seneca Indians would receive millions of
dollars in back rents on leased lands under a bill approved by the
Senate.
   The bill directs the federal government to pay $35 million to
the Senecas, admitting that Congress wrongly forced the tribe to
lease its land for 115 years to the city of Salamanca, N.Y.
   ``We took advantage of the Seneca Nation and now we ought to
correct this injustice,'' said Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., one
of the Senate sponsors.
   The bill was adopted on a voice vote late Tuesday. It passed the
House on Oct. 10.
   The Bush administration has said the government is not
financially liable for the low rents paid to the Senecas and
opposes the measure because of its cost. President Bush has 10 days
in which to sign it, veto it or simply allow it to pass into law
unsigned.
   The bill would ratify an agreement reached by Salamanca, three
nearby villages and the Seneca Nation to replace a 99-year lease
accord expiring Feb. 19, 1991.
   Under the agreements, about 85 percent of the city of Salamanca
is leased from the Senecas at rents that were frozen as low as $1
per year.
   The state of New York must also pay $25 million, which will
require state legislation.
