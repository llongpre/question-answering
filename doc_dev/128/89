   SANTA MONICA, Calif. -- Wilshire Associates Inc. said two
senior vice presidents have left the investment services
firm, which has had a string of departures in recent months.
   Lawrence E. Davanzo, who built Wilshire's consulting arm
for U.S. pension funds into one of the country's biggest,
said he plans to set up his own consulting firm for foreign
pension funds and other financial institutions investing in
the U.S. Since 1989, Mr. Davanzo had headed Wilshire's
international consulting business.

   Robert L. Garvy, head of marketing for Wilshire's
asset-management services, resigned to become president of
Investment Index Technologies Inc., a money-management unit
of Prudential Insurance Co. of America. A Prudential
spokesman said Mr. Garvy will be based in Atlanta, where he
had worked for Wilshire.
   Mr. Davanzo said there was no connection between his
departure and those of Mr. Garvy and several other executives
leaving Wilshire. Last November, Douglas LeBon, who evaluated
private partnerships for Wilshire clients, resigned to set up
his own firm. Also last year, Dale Stevens, another longtime
Wilshire official, left to join a money-management firm.
   Wilshire said it was looking for a successor to Mr. Garvy;
Mr. Davanzo's duties will shift to others within the firm.
   Wilshire also said it hired William G. Bensur, formerly
head of Mellon Bank's consulting services, to open Wilshire's
first Eastern U.S. consulting office, to be located in
Pittsburgh.
