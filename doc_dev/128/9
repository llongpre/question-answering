<HEAD>Attorneys General: Suzuki Agrees to Include Warning in Samurai Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Suzuki Motor Corp. has agreed to pay
$200,000 to seven states and to include in future advertisements a
warning that its Samurai sport vehicle may roll over if turned too
sharply.
   The agreement announced Thursday settles lawsuits filed by New
York, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, Texas and
Washington accusing the car manufacturer _ the U.S. arm of Japanese
automaker Suzuki _ of false and deceptive advertising. It was
effective Tuesday.
   American Suzuki, based in Brea, Calif., entered the agreement
without admitting any guilt or safety problems. The $200,000 is to
cover the states' costs in preparing the cases.
   The states began investigating the Samurai's safety last June
after Consumer Reports magazine gave the popular, four-wheel-drive
sport utility vehicle its first ``not acceptable'' rating in 10
years.
   Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports, said the $8,500
Samurai is too short, too narrow, too light and its center of
gravity is too high to be safe. It was the first car of 349 tested
in the last decade to roll over during a routine accident-avoidance
test, in which cars are made to swerve to avoid an obstacle in the
road, the group reported.
   ``This agreement strongly affirms that the Samurai is a safe
vehicle and strongly supports the federal government decision that
there is no reason to investigate the safety of the Samurai,'' N.
Douglas Mazza, American Suzuki's vice president, said in a statement.
   Consumers Union, of Mount Vernon, had asked the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration to recall the more than 150,000
Japanese-built Samurais sold in this country since its introduction
in November 1985.
   The agency denied the recall petition in September, saying the
Samurai had a rollover rate ``within the range of most other light
utility vehicles.'' It also said most rollovers were influenced by
``drinking, low ambient light and lack or driver familiarity (with)
either the vehicle or the road.''
   New York Attorney general Robert Abrams said Thursday that the
states took action because ``the federal government has, once again,
failed to act to protect the consumers of this country.''
   Samurai print ads now must include the following statement:
``This vehicle handles differently from ordinary passenger cars.
Federal law cautions to avoid sharp turns and abrupt maneuvers which
can cause vehicles of this type to roll over. Always wear your
seatbelt. For specific details, please read your owner's manual.''
   A shorter version of the statement is required for television and
radio ads, Abrams said.
   Abrams said his investigation indicated previous Suzuki ads
``deceived the public by promoting the Samurai as a safe, fun
passenger vehicle while knowing it...can present considerable
dangers to young, inexperienced, first-time purchasers who were
Suzuki's target buyers.''
   Suzuki contended its advertising did not violate state laws but
decided to agree to a settlement to avoid possible legal action by
the states.
   ``For Suzuki and Samurai owners, this agreement with the
attorneys general is the final chapter in a long story of false
allegations about the Samurai,'' Mazza said.
