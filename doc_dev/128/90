   TOKYO -- Honda Motor Co.'s year-old effort to revamp its
management structure took an unexpected turn as the company's
No. 2 executive, Shoichiro Irimajiri, abruptly announced his
resignation.
   A Honda press release cited health reasons for Mr.
Irimajiri's departure, but gave no details of the nature of
his illness. However, Honda board members were informed at a
special meeting that Mr. Irimajiri had decided to step down
because of a heart condition, according to Shinichi Tanaka, a
company spokesman.

   Mr. Irimajiri, 52 years old, served as executive vice
president of Honda and president of Honda R&amp;D Co., the auto
maker's research and development affiliate. He occupied a
pivotal position at Honda and is widely regarded as one of
Japan's ablest auto executives.
   He also spent a key portion of his career, from May 1984
until June 1989, as president of Honda's U.S. manufacturing
operations. During that time, he oversaw the rapid expansion
that made Honda the premier Japanese auto manufacturer in the
U.S.
   Under a series of broad organizational reforms introduced
early last spring, Mr. Irimajiri had assumed direct
responsibility for Honda's manufacturing and product
development operations in Japan. The changes ushered in a
more top-down management style at Honda, a company renowned
for its collegial approach to decision-making.
   The reforms also significantly strengthened the authority
of Mr. Irimajiri, Honda President Nobuhiko Kawamoto, and
Yoshihide Munekuni, executive vice president for marketing.
Mr. Kawamoto won a twoman race for Honda's top job in 1990.
   Mr. Irimajiri, who will retain his posts as a board member
at Honda and at the research subsidiary, wasn't available for
comment. Mr. Tanaka, the Honda spokesman, said Mr. Irimajiri
had been admitted to a hospital.
   The suddenness of Mr. Irimajiri's exit prompted a few
executives at rival Japanese auto makers to speculate about
dissent within Honda's upper ranks. At other Japanese auto
companies, it isn't uncommon to allow stricken top executives
to keep formal titles well after they've lost the capacity to
fulfill their duties.
   But other industry observers expressed doubt that
corporate infighting was behind the resignation. "That would
be very unusual for Honda," said Peter Boardman, an auto
industry analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities Ltd. in Tokyo.
"They just don't have that kind of environment."
   Mr. Irimajiri's management duties will be divided between
Messrs. Kawamoto and Munekuni. Mr. Kawamoto will assume the
presidency of Honda R&amp;D, a position he held before becoming
president of the parent. Mr. Munekuni will take on Mr.
Irimajiri's manufacturing responsibilities.
   Mr. Irimajiri's absence "won't make a radical difference"
at Honda, said Neil Doying, an analyst with Baring Securities
(Japan) Ltd.
   Noriyuki Matsushima, an analyst at the research affiliate
of Nikko Securities Co., said Mr. Irimajiri's departure may
even have a positive effect by consolidating the authority of
Messrs. Kawamoto and Munekuni. "Two heads are better than
three," he said.
   Mr. Irimajiri, who joined Honda as an engineer in March
1963, was crucial to the company's U.S. manufacturing
expansion. He headed the auto maker's U.S. facilities when
Honda began producing engines for the Civic subcompact in
Anna, Ohio, in 1986.
   The move made Honda the first Japanese company to build a
car's engine in the U.S. "Our philosophy is to produce our
products where we sell them," Mr. Irimajiri said at the time.
   Messrs. Kawamoto and Munekuni will have their work cut out
for them. Honda's stock has performed relatively well in
recent months -- it closed Wednesday at 1,490 yen ($11.22),
up 90 yen. But the company has been losing domestic market
share, and last year ceded its No. 3 ranking for car sales
inside Japan to Mitsubishi Motors Corp. Honda expects to post
pretax profit of 63 billion yen for the year ending March 31,
down from 85 billion yen a year earlier.
