   SmithKline Beckman Corp. said the head of its troubled U.S. pharmaceutical unit resigned. 

   The resignation of James H. Cavanaugh, who had been president of the Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories-U.S. unit for three years, comes as SmithKline starts to restructure its pharmaceutical operations. 
The company named Frederick W. Kyle, formerly senior vice president of the unit, as the unit's new president. 

   A company spokesman said neither Mr. Cavanaugh nor Mr. Kyle was available for comment yesterday. 

   As previously reported, George W. Ebright, president and chief operating officer of SmithKline, last month took direct management control of SmithKline's pharmaceutical business for what the company called an "interim period." 
He has said the company will eliminate overlapping functions within its Smith Kline &amp; French Laboratories division, which includes an international and a research and development unit as well as the U.S. unit. 

   SmithKline hasn't indicated who might succeed Mr. Ebright in his role at the division, if in fact top management responsibilities there remain consolidated in a single position. 

   SmithKline has been hurt by slumping U.S. sales of its two leading prescription drugs, Tagamet, an anti-ulcer drug, and Dyazide, an anti-hypertensive drug. 
This week, the company, which also has interests in eye- and skin-care products, clinical laboratory services and scientific instruments, reported that second-quarter earnings fell 25% from a year earlier to $98.7 million, or 79 cents a share, on sales of $1.14 billion.
