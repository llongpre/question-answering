   Chrysler Corp. said it raised prices on six of its pickup trucks, including two that were introduced in December as so-called price leader models. 

   The company said the new prices -- which took effect yesterday -- will "help offset increasing costs, yet keep our pricing highly competitive." 
The move comes at a time when Chrysler is offering incentives on many of its car and truck models -- including the six trucks on which it has boosted prices. 

   The new prices won't affect those vehicles already ordered, or already on dealer lots. 

   Separately, American Motors Corp. said it is introducing a new, lower-priced version of its Jeep Wrangler sport utility vehicles to compete with Japan-based Suzuki Motor Co.'s popular Samurai. 
The new Wrangler S model, which goes on sale this week, has a base price of $8,795, compared with $10,295 for the regular Wrangler. 

   Competition in the U.S. truck market has been fierce for the past few years, with many new manufacturers and models vying for customers. 
So far this year, sales for imported and domestic trucks are up about 4%. 
The increase is partly the result of a broad range of incentives that cover many truck models. 
Trucks, vans and sport utility vehicles also have become more popular among consumers who once bought only cars. 
In contrast, car sales are down almost 9%, despite incentives on a number of models. 

   The auto maker increased base prices on four models of its standard Ram pickup and two models of its Dakota compact pickup. 
The company didn't change the base price of the lowest-priced Dakota model -- the Dakota S -- which starts at $6,590. 

   Chrysler introduced the Dakota S and two of the Ram pickup models, the D-100 and W-100, in December as variations on the "America" strategy it used when it slashed the base prices of its Omni and Horizon subcompact cars, while adding equipment. 
Sales of the cars more than doubled as a result of the change. 

   The D-100 originally was priced at $7,653. 
The new base price is $8,089, an increase of 5.7%. 
The base price of the two-wheel-drive, short-bed Dakota rose 2.9% to $7,748 from $7,529, while the base price of the D150 short-bed pickup rose 3.5% to $9,136 from $8,823. 

   American Motors said its new Wrangler S model is designed to appeal mainly to college-educated males between 25 and 35 years old, who currently buy Suzuki Samurai sport utility vehicles. 
Suzuki has sold more than 29,000 of the Samurai models this year, partly because of base prices that start at $7,495. 
Sales of Wrangler models for the first four months of this year totaled about 9,000. 

   AMC said it anticipates that about 25% of the Wrangler models it builds will be S models. 
It said it was able to cut the price on Wrangler S by limiting the number and types of colors and equipment, compared with the regular Wrangler.
