   SMOKE: The U.S. boomerang team said it rejected a deal for TV coverage and $15,000 from tobacco concern Philip Morris Inc. in favor of sponsorship from a doctors' anti-smoking group. 
But a company spokesman said differently: "We rejected them." 
Said Peter Sawyer, the agent who tried to arrange the deal: "I think they (team members) shot themselves in the foot. 
If Philip Morris wanted to get behind the sport, you're talking about making boomerangs into Frisbees."
