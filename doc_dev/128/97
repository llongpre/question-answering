   Three owners of Suzuki Samurais have filed a
class action contending the vehicles have design flaws that make
them unsafe.
   The lawsuit, filed Friday in Circuit Court against American
Suzuki Corp. of Brea, Calif., seeks full refunds as well as an
unspecified amount of damages for all Suzuki Samurai owners.
   The plaintiffs were identified in the lawsuit only as Steven and
Linda Newmark of Missouri and Lynn Romanek of Illinois.
   Citing an article in Consumer Reports magazine, attorneys for
the plaintiffs contend the Suzuki Samurai vehicles are unstable and
can roll over at speeds as low as 40 mph. The company has defended
the vehicles as safe.
   ``Basically, the suit contends Suzuki had the knowledge of the
problem but did not notify the owners or rectify it,'' said Aron
Robinson, an attorney for the law firm of Holstein, Mack &amp; Dupree,
which is working on the suit.
   Suzuki offices in Brea were closed late Friday, and officials
could not be reached for comment on the lawsuit.
   However, Doug Mazza, vice president and general manager of
American Suzuki, said, said earlier, in response to the Consumer
Reports article, ``We have absolute confidence that we are selling
a safe and stable vehicle.''
   The company said the Samurai was thoroughly tested for safety,
stability and handling before it was introduced in the United
States in November 1985.
