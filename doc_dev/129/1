FT  28 MAY 94 / Scrabble takeover bid on the board
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hasbro, the biggest US toy and games group, yesterday made a surprise move
to become the world's undisputed Scrabble champion. It launched a Pounds
46.9m unsolicited bid for JW Spear, the British company which owns rights to
the board game outside North America.
Scrabble, which ranks alongside Monopoly as a board game known throughout
the world, is produced in more than 20 languages and accounts for about 30
per cent of Spear's Pounds 38.7m turnover. This year the company is planning
to introduce versions in Turkish and Hungarian.
Hasbro had sales of Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) in 1993. It has owned
Scrabble in Canada and the US, where the game was invented more than 50
years ago, since 1989.
It has been the UK company's biggest shareholder outside the Spear family
interests for the past four years, with 26.7 per cent. The trustees of some
Spear family trusts have given undertakings to accept the Hasbro bid in
respect of a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings become irrevocable next
Friday if a higher offer is not received.
Hasbro is offering 900p a share, a premium of more than 21 per cent to the
last reported dealing price of 740p on May 12.
The Spear board will meet this morning to consider the bid. The company,
which in March raised its final dividend by 36 per cent on the back of a 22
per cent rise in profits to Pounds 4.51m, is expected to find the offer
inadequate.
Mr Francis Spear, chairman, would make no comment last night, although he
dismissed any idea of a family row. Mr Paul Lipscomb, finance director, said
the bid had come like a bolt from the blue.
Spear's other products include Atmosfear, a board game linked to a video,
and more traditional pastimes such as Snakes and Ladders.
Mr Alan Hassenfeld, chairman of Hasbro, said the acquisition would be 'a
logical extension of Hasbro's strategy to develop and expand its core
operations around the world'.
The origins of Scrabble lie in the 1930s when it was developed as a
crossword game by Alfred Butts, a New York architect whose practice was in
trouble after the Wall Street crash.
It was launched as Scrabble in 1949 after almost two decades of rejection by
leading games players as too highbrow. The game took off in the 1950s after
the chairman of Macy's department store in New York became hooked and placed
a large order.
Mr Butts, a poor speller, earned only a 5 cent royalty on each set.
Nevertheless, at the peak sales levels in the late 1950s and 1960s, he was
getting about Dollars 50,000 a year.
