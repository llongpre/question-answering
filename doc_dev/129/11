Mattel yesterday snatched victory from rival US toy group Hasbro in the
battle for JW Spear, the British company which owns the rights to the
Scrabble board game outside North America.
Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, raised its offer for shares in Spear from
Pounds 10 to Pounds 11.50, valuing the company at Pounds 62m. Last Friday,
Hasbro increased its offer from Pounds 9 to Pounds 11.
Spear's directors and family trustees have irrevocably pledged 2,695,000
shares, or 51.2 per cent of the company, to Mattel. Last night, Mr Francis
Spear, chairman said: 'We at Spear are happy with the revised offer. We
believe it reflects a fair and reasonable value for the company.'
Mattel entered the battle for Spear as a white knight after Hasbro launched
a surprise bid in late May. It wanted a more secure foothold in the market
for board games.
Hasbro already owns the North American rights for Scrabble, as well as a
26.7 per cent stake in Spear. The company said last night that it was
considering its position and would be making a statement today. However, it
said it considered Pounds 11 a 'a very full offer'. It appears likely that
Hasbro will now sell its stake.
Hasbro's original offer was made after it received undertakings from the
trustees of some Spear family trusts to sell their 24.9 per cent stake
unless a higher offer was received within three working days.
Mattel launched its counter attack at five minutes to midnight on the last
day. Hasbro went to the High Court, claiming Mattel's offer had not been
properly announced. But the judge released the trustees from any obligation
to sell their shares.
The Spear board, which was split by the original offer, was not recommending
either bidder. Hasbro raised the stakes last Friday after Spear allowed it
to take a closer look at the company and its forecasts.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Mattel's
offer represents an exit multiple of 21.1 times the company's earnings last
year.
Richard Tomkins in New York adds: Mr John Amerman, Mattel chairman and chief
executive, said he was 'delighted' at the victory. 'This is an excellent
outcome not only for the shareholders but also for Spear's employees and
customers,' he said.
