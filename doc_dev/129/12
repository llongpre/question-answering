<TEXT>     A longtime Scrabble expert, she continued to play in regional tournaments
despite failing health, and won a tourney in Riverside four years ago.;    At
age 84, Ms. Sherard published The Double List Word Book, a reference work of
100,000 words for use by Scrabble and crossword puzzle fans. The book lists
words by size and common first and last letters.;    "The book might seem like
a lot of work to some people, but it didn't seem like work to me," Ms. Sherard
said earlier this year. "I've always liked word games and taking big words and
finding small words in them.";    Ms. Sherard started playing Scrabble in the
1930s, when it was known as Criss-Cross. The title changed to Scrabble in
1948. The game's premise is to form interlocking words in crossword fashion
across a 225-square grid and score points.;    "She bought it for us as a
Christmas gift one year and the family began playing it," her daughter said.
"We started buying all kinds of dictionaries so we could have more words.
Everything went from there.";    Ms. Sherard frequently served as a word judge
at national Scrabble tournaments. She celebrated her 95th birthday in January
playing in a Scrabble contest at Pasadena City College.;    Born in La Grange,
Ga., in 1896, Ms. Sherard graduated from Atlanta University. She operated a
grocery store in Chicago and worked as a clerk with the federal government.;  
 She later moved to California and was a resident of the Eagle Rock area of
Los Angeles when she died. Her husband, Benjamin Sherard, died five years
ago.;    In addition to daughter, Gwendolyn, of Los Angeles, Ms. Sherard is
survived by a son, Edgar Sherard, of Gary, Ind.; eight grandchildren; and 13
great-grandchildren.;    Funeral services were scheduled today at Cedar Park
Cemetery in Chicago.  </TEXT>
