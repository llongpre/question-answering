FT  10 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Judge to rule over Scrabble squabble

A High Court judge will next Tuesday be asked to decide on the squabble over
Scrabble, the board game which is the main target for two US toy groups
battling for control of JW Spear.
Hasbro, the biggest US toy company and maker of Action Man, is proceeding
against trustees controlling 24.9 per cent of the family-run group. It will
argue that the trustees are still bound by agreements to sell the stake, in
spite of an eleventh hour bid by Mattel, Hasbro's US rival.
Mattel, maker of Barbie dolls, yesterday noted news of the court case 'with
regret.' The group said its offer of Pounds 10 a share - Pounds 1 above the
Hasbro offer - was made at Spear's invitation.
Hasbro, which launched its Pounds 46.9m unsolicited bid on May 27, has been
the biggest shareholder outside the Spear family for the past four years,
with 26.7 per cent. The trustees had given irrevocable undertakings to
accept unless a better offer was made within three business days.
Mattel's offer, valuing Spear at Pounds 52m, was made at just five minutes
to midnight on the final day.
The announcement was lodged with the Stock Exchange, while the Takeover
Panel and both sets of advisers were informed of the offer.
Hasbro claims that this was not a public announcement, and so the
undertakings remain valid.
Mattel has been advised that the announcement of its bid was 'sufficient to
release the trustees from their undertakings to Hasbro.' It understood that
the trustees had received identical advice.
If Hasbro wins on Tuesday, it will be able to declare its offer
unconditional. If it loses it could, under the terms of its original bid,
increase its offer.
The Spear board - apart from Mr Francis Spear, chairman - yesterday
reiterated its description of the Hasbro offer as 'wholly inadequate.'
