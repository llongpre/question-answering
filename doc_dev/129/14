Spear

Hasbro yesterday turned up the heat in its battle for control of JW Spear,
the games group, with a veiled threat of legal action against trustees
controlling 24.9 per cent of the family-run group.
The US toy maker said the trustees were still bound by agreements to sell
the stake, in spite of an eleventh hour bid by Mattel, the rival toys group.
Hasbro launched its Pounds 9 a share bid for Spear, maker of the word game
Scrabble, 10 days ago, valuing the group at Pounds 47m. The trustees had
agreed to sell their shares to Hasbro, as long as Spear did not publicly
announce an alternative, higher bid in three working days.
On the last day, at just five minutes to midnight, Mattel jumped in with a
Pounds 10 a share offer valuing Spear at Pounds 52m. The announcement was
lodged with the Stock Exchange, while the Takeover Panel and both sets of
advisers were informed of the offer.
Hasbro now claims this was not a public announcement and so the undertakings
are valid. 'All the steps were taken of getting ready to make a public
announcement, but no public announcement was ever made,' said Mr Francis
Jackson of J Henry Schroder Wagg, its advisers and merchant bank.
Hasbro said it was considering its options regarding legal action if the
trustees did not adhere to the undertakings. No response had yet been
received from the trustees.
Spear rejected Hasbro's claim and said it had received professional advice
that the Mattel offer had been validly announced. The board, with the
exception of Mr Francis Spear, the chairman, was recommending Mattel's
offer. Mr Spear originally backed Hasbro's offer, but has been silent since
the Mattel bid.
The regulatory authorities appear to be divided on the issue raised by
Hasbro. Under Stock Exchange guidelines, a public announcement is made by
notifying the Stock Exchange and at least two national newspapers and two
news wires.
However, Spear's advisers, the merchant bank Barings, are understood to have
consulted the Takeover Panel on their interpretation of a public
announcement. While the Panel would not comment on the contract signed by
the trustees, it is believed to have defined a public announcement as
notification to itself, the Stock Exchange, the company, Hasbro and both
sets of advisers.
