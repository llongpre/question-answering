The battle for control of JW Spear, the maker of the 'Scrabble' board game,
was thrown open again yesterday when a High Court judge released the
company's trustees from any obligation to sell their shares to Hasbro, the
US toy group.
The judge ruled that Mattel, a rival US toy company, had acted properly in
announcing an improved offer five minutes before the deadline for the
operation of a clause allowing the trustees to be released from an
irrevocable undertaking to sell a controlling interest to Hasbro.
The court's decision now leaves the Spear trustees - who own 24.9 per cent
of the company - free to accept the Mattel bid or any higher one.
Hasbro was last night considering its options: to mount an appeal against
the ruling, out-bid Mattel, or walk away. The company is certain to reach
its decision before Thursday, after which an undertaking given yesterday by
the trustees not to sell their shares to anyone else will expire.
The dispute arose after the Spear trustees gave irrevocable undertakings on
May 27 to accept a Pounds 46.9m bid from Hasbro which, with 26.7 per cent,
has been the largest shareholder outside the Spear family for the past four
years. However, Mattel responded with a Pounds 52m bid. This was announced
at five minutes to midnight on June 2, the final day when the escape clause
applied to allow the trustees to accept higher bids.
The legal action centred on whether Mattel had fulfilled its obligations to
make a public announcement of its offer. Mattel had informed the Stock
Exchange and the Takeover Panel in the minutes leading up to the final
deadline, but not the national press.
Lawyers for Hasbro argued that the offer should also have been announced to
at least two national newspapers and two UK wire services.
Giving judgment, Mr Justice Chadwick said that when the escape clause was
agreed between Hasbro and the trustees, it was likely that their intention
was to guarantee the commitment of third-party bidders rather than informing
the investing public.
Spear, its trustees and Mattel welcomed yesterday's outcome.
