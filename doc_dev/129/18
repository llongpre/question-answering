How many bona fide two-letter words are there in English? Anyone knowing the
answer off pat will probably be an addict of Scrabble (in which short words
can be decisive in end-play) and so have cause to lament the death of the
game's US inventor Alfred Butts.
As old as the century and an architect by training, he devised the
word-based board game in the 1930s only to have it turned down by
manufacturers in the field. It was not until the early 1950s that the Macy's
retail chain began selling Scrabble, paving the way for an estimated total
sale in various languages which still seems low at 100m. He said he earned
only a few cents on each.
As for the two-letter words, according to Chambers English Dictionary, the
number is 106. The three-letter variety are far more plentiful, with 1,087.
