Correction (published 14th July 1994) appended to this article.
Hasbro yesterday threw in its hand in the battle for JW Spear, the maker of
Scrabble, and said it would accept the Pounds 11.50 a share bid from US toy
rival Mattel.
It described the Pounds 62m offer as 'very generous and above a level which
we could justify in business terms'.
The decision ends a fierce scrap over Spear, which started when Hasbro
launched a 900p a share bid for the company at the end of May. It had held a
26.7 per cent stake since 1990 and had received undertakings from the
trustees of some Spear family trusts to sell their 24.9 per cent stake
unless a higher offer was received within three working days.
After a frantic search for a white knight, Hambro, Spear's merchant bank,
persuaded Mattel to launch a rival bid at Pounds 10 a share five minutes
before the deadline. Hasbro came back with an Pounds 11 a share offer last
Friday, which was topped by Mattel on Monday night.
Mr Norman Walker, president of Hasbro International, said: 'Our offer at
Pounds 11 per share was a very full one which we are not prepared to
increase. We are very pleased at the outcome for all shareholders and will
of course realise a substantial gain on our own investment which we made in
1990.' Hasbro bought its original stake at under Pounds 3 a share.
The outcome leaves the rights to Scrabble divided between Mattel and Hasbro,
which are fierce rivals in the doll market. Hasbro, maker of Sindy, retains
the rights to Scrabble in North America, leaving Barbie's creator, Mattel,
with the rest of the world.
Mattel's victory is particularly sweet for Robert Fleming, the merchant
bank. It was appointed by Mattel just six hours before the initial offer had
to be launched and completed the task with a few minutes to spare.
CORRECTION
JW Spear's merchant bank, which handled its successful sale to Mattel,
was Barings not Hambros as stated yesterday.
