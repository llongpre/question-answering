FT  21 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Reduced deficit at JW Spear
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JW Spear, the Enfield-based toys and games manufacturer, reported sharply
reduced losses in its seasonally unfavourable first half.
Losses before tax were Pounds 315,000 for the six months to June 30, down
from Pounds 638,000 at the same stage of 1991. The group, famed for its
Scrabble game, achieved profits of Pounds 2.53m pre-tax in the full 1991
year.
The outcome reflected lower interest payable of Pounds 5,000 (Pounds
125,000). Turnover was marginally lower at Pounds 8.28m as France proved a
'lacklustre' market following the impact of video games, said Mr Francis
Spear, chairman.
Losses per share were cut to 5.78p (8.19p) and the interim dividend goes up
to 2.5p (2p).
