   Coleco Industries Inc. agreed Thursday to
be bought by Hasbro Inc. for $85 million, marking the likely end of
the company that made the hottest-selling toy in U.S. history, the
Cabbage Patch Kids doll.
   Hasbro, the largest American toymaker, will receive all of
Coleco's product line, which includes Scrabble and Parcheesi board
games, as part of the all-cash deal, Coleco Chairman Morton Handel
said.
   The deal still must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New
York, where Coleco, swamped with $540.3 million in debt, sought
protection from creditors a year ago. A hearing on the sale is
expected next week or in early July, Handel said.
   Avon-based Coleco is to receive warrants to purchase 1 million
shares of Hasbro stock as part of the deal. Hasbro, based in
Pawtucket, R.I., will get inventory, equipment to make products and
some accounts receivable.
   Appalachian Artworks Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, and
Coleco directors also must approve the deal, which must be completed
by July 17.
   If the deal is approved, most of Coleco's 250 employees are
expected to be laid off, although some may be hired by Hasbro,
Handel said.
   Coleco has about 75 salaried workers in Avon, 75 in Mayfield,
N.Y., and a total of about 100 assembly line workers at both
locations.
   ``Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take
risks,'' said Paul Valentine, a toy analyst with Standard &amp; Poors
Corp. in New York. ``The industry is poorer because of their
demise.''
   Russian immigrant Maurice Greenberg founded the Connecticut
Leather Co. in 1932. The company expanded its leather and shoe
products line to toys in 1954 and its name was changed to Coleco in
1961.
   Analysts said Coleco ran into trouble after the phenomenal
success of the Cabbage Patch doll, which became the best-selling toy
of all-time with more than $600 million in sales in 1985.
   David Leibowitz, senior vice president of American Securities
Corp., said Coleco borrowed money to expand after the Cabbage Patch
success.
   But when Cabbage Patch Kids sales tumbled and new products,
including Adams home computer and toys based on the Rambo movies,
did not sell, Coleco couldn't pay off the new debts, he said.
   ``They managed their company for a sales revival that never
came,'' Valentine said.
   Hasbro, which makes GI Joe, Mr. Potato Head, My Little Pony and
Transformers, had sales of $1.34 billion last year, up from just
$104.3 million in 1980. Hasbro in the last decade has bought
big-name companies including Milton Bradley Co. and introduced a
steady stream of new products.
   Hasbro Executive Vice President Barry Alperin said of the Coleco
deal: ``It means the acquisition of good, stable game products, like
Scrabble, Parcheesi and Aggravation ... and it's a good chance to
add to our toy division.''
   After the transaction, Coleco will have as much as $150 million
in cash, $85 million from Hasbro and about $65 million it had in
banks in mid-March, Handel said. The cash will be used to pay off
the company's debts, he said.
   Coleco also said it would retain some real estate assets, which
will be converted to cash.
   The companies also agreed that Hasbro will participate in Coleco
business operations up to the close of the transaction as part of a
management consulting agreement.
