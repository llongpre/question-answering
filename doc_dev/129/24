FT  07 JUN 94 / Observer: Scrabbling in Toytown
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Who will finally bag J W Spear, the UK owner of Scrabble? Will it be mighty
Mattel, manufacturer of Barbie, aged 35? Or will Hasbro, handler of Sindy,
33, finally win through? Hasbro was first, valuing Spear at almost Pounds
47m, but Mattel squeezed in last Friday, valuing it at Pounds 52m.
Observer understands the matter has already passed into the hands of two top
executives, charged with thrashing out a compromise. Here's an excerpt of a
crucial weekend phone call.
S: Whaddya mean by this, tryin' to upstage ma show? Old man Spear has
already said he's happy with us.
B: Off your high horse, gal. All's fair in love, war and business. The other
Scrabble guys go for me.
S: Cheapskate] Flashing your legs ain't gonna make no difference.
B: At least I got legs worth flashing - punters paid more than Dollars 1bn
for me last year. And I got 55 per cent of the fashion doll market. You only
got 32 per cent, honey.
S: You ain't got a decent pedigree, sweetie pie. Ah'm British, through and
through.
B: British? Don't crease me up. You ain't been British since 1986.
S: I jest know that Spear likes my looks better than yours.
B: Butt out, kiddo - your looks were a damn sight better before you got a
nose job in '92.
S: That was only 'cos you bitched so loudly that I was better-looking than
you.
B: Lighten up, loser. You ain't gotta hope in hell.
S: (Sounds of sniffles).
