FT  04 JUN 94 / Markets: Barbie and Sindy v Ken and Eddie - London

As double acts go, Barbie and Sindy may be less edifying than Ken and Eddie,
but more electrifying to investors. A rally of the dolls is underway with
their respective parents, Mattel and Hasbro, battling each other for control
of JW Spear &amp; Sons, the British toy maker. Spear's stock is already up 58
per cent from its January low to 750p with every last Scrabble tile still to
fight for.
But is the stock market's uplift this week - achieved without assistance
from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke or Governor Eddy George - anything more than
a cosmetic correction?
After the dreadful drubbing stocks and bonds suffered the previous week, the
tide turned on Thursday in the futures markets. The cash markets too saw
some genuine buyers attracted by near 9 per cent long gilt yields and 4 per
cent dividend yields.
The upturn proved fragile yesterday. No sooner did the latest US payroll
figures hit screens at lunchtime, than stocks and bonds headed south again.
Only when US bonds rebounded on some comforting words from the White House
did UK markets recover their poise. The FT-SE 100 index finished with a 31.4
point gain on the week at 2,997.8.
Few investors doubt there is genuine value in equities and gilts at these
levels but none are in a hurry to buy. 'We feel slightly spoiled for
choice,' says David Manning, director of UK equities at Legal &amp; General, a
large institutional investor. But there is no need to rush to invest in
either market. 'They will still be here in two or three months' time at the
same sort of levels.'
One factor holding him back is the high yield on index linked gilts. Not
only is the 4 per cent return virtually the same as the stock market's
average dividend yield but it is also risk-free.
As the first of the accompanying charts show, the index linked yield is high
by historic standards apart from the period 1990-92 when it was boosted by
sterling's membership of the ERM. It is hard to envisage yields rising much
further. But even if the bond market fails to rally and achieves only
stability, equities could still gradually recover.
'If indexed linked yields do stabilise and one looks out through 1994 and
1995 one can see an equity yield premium re-emerging fairly rapidly,' say
strategists at SG Warburg Securities, thanks to rapid dividend growth.
As the second chart shows, the dividend yield has rarely been so close to
the index linked gilt yield apart from the run up to the 1987 crash. At
current levels, equities are expensive but will become more attractive as
dividends grow and the yield ratio rises.
Such a modest stock market improvement later this year, led by expanding
earnings and dividends, seems much more likely than one led by a bond market
rally and falling interest rates. Even though a long gilt yield of around 9
per cent is discounting more inflation than most people expect, there are
too many economic uncertainties at home and abroad for investors to chase
bond prices higher.
A parallel can be drawn with the market in mid-1985, says Vivian Bazalgette,
managing director of Gartmore Pension Fund Managers. 'This is a mid-cycle
reaction when the market is switching from being interest rate to earnings
driven. We see scope for the market to rise to its former peak or even a
little higher by the end of the year.' Gartmore has remained slightly
overweight in UK equities throughout the market's 15 per cent correction
from its February peak.
Most other UK institutional investors are also well represented in domestic
equities so they may not be a source of particularly heavy buying when the
market begins to recover. However, there are stocks to cherry pick. Legal
and General, for example, likes those big international stocks in the
Footsie which offer above average dividend yield and exposure to the US
economy.
No companies reporting this week fit the profile although Siebe fails only
on the dividend count. The controls maker reported a 20 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits for the year to Pounds 217.2m and an 11.6 per cent increase
in full-year dividend to 11p for a gross yield of 2.4 per cent. Its
underlying profit margins held up through the recession and it is now
enjoying some growth in demand in the Americas and elsewhere.
The most pleasant results surprise came from Boots. Reporting pre-tax
profits for the year up 19 per cent to Pounds 484.4m and the dividend up 12
per cent to 15p, it shook off some of the investor doubts which have dogged
it for the past 18 months. It has yet to work out what to do with its
struggling drugs business or to show it can make money in the do-it-yourself
sector, but there is no doubting the strength of its core retailing
business.
In contrast, elsewhere in the retail sector, Kingfisher delivered a rather
downbeat annual general meeting statement. First quarter sales volume was
lower than a year earlier and its 'every day low-pricing' policy is still
not paying off convincingly. Its shares lost more ground and are now down 33
per cent from their high for the year of 778p.
Granada Group offered the most sparkling performance of the week. Its
interim pre-tax profits were up 51 per cent to Pounds 103m and its dividend
up 10 per cent at 3.33p. Acquisitions in catering and textile rental were
big contributors while LWT, the television franchise, chipped in only
one-month so far.
Although Granada's results attest in part to the profitable audience for
glamorous game shows, Barbie and Sindy are fighting on a higher intellectual
plane. Not for them the fripperies of outfits, accessories and hairstyle
they normally crave. This time they are each after Spear's Scrabble
franchise. Sadly, there would be little contest if they challenged Ken and
Eddie to a game.
