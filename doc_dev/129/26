   Fourteen-year-old Adam Logan says he doesn't
remember when he first learned to play Scrabble or how he got so
good at it.
   ``I just know that it's fun,'' he said during a break after
Sunday's first game of the 1989 National Scrabble Championship.
   Logan, a high school student from Ottawa, is the youngest of the
151 expert players competing in a five-day tournament for the
$5,000 top prize. Another 72 recreation-level players also are
competing at the New York Penta hotel in midtown Manhattan.
   The competitors are from 30 states and eight other countries.
   The 1987 champion, Rita Norr of New York City, is the only woman
to win the 7-year-old tournament.
   ``Some people feel that the women don't have the killer
instinct,'' she said. ``I'm not sure that that's really it. Men
maybe have the freedom to concentrate more on the game.''
   Norr, a freelance mathematics textbook writer with a computer
science background, said the game is more than knowledge of words.
   ``It's very mathematical,'' she said. ``A lot of it's even
spatial relationships and decisions about when to challenge, when
not to challenge, when to close the board, when to open it,
constantly keeping track of where you are in the game and how many
tiles are left.''
   But Loera Thompson, a 75-year-old Mississippi native, doesn't
take it so seriously.
   ``I don't care that much about it,'' she said _ as long as she
isn't outpointed. ``I like to win, of course.''

   He's been laughed at for using Jimminy
Cricket's droppings for fertilizer, but Bill Bricker gets the last
laugh when he hoists his three-pound tomatoes to promote his
Kricket Krap.
   The retired Army colonel invents organic fertilizers like
Kricket Krap, which he sells from his 10-acre farm along the
Savannah River near Augusta.
   ``It's what the name says _ cricket droppings,'' Bricker said.
``I don't know why people never thought of it before. Crickets eat
25 percent protein _ that's better than you or I eat.''
   Once a month, Bricker buys about six tons of droppings from two
local cricket farms, where the insects are raised as bait and their
droppings collected with a huge vacuum cleaner.
   He bags the droppings and sells them around the country via his
mail order service.
   Bricker said he also wants to educate the South about the values
of organic farming. But it's also a million-dollar business, and he
goes to great lengths for a sale.
   His first fertilizer was a combination of leaves, hay and old
vegetables baked in the sun. When it sold poorly, he televised an
ad that showed an egg cooking in a plastic bag in the middle of the
compost pile.
   Then, he ate the egg.
