   Chieftain Products Inc. said it is suing West Hartford, Conn.-based Coleco Industries Inc. in the Supreme Court of Ontario for alleged violation of a contractual agreement to market Scrabble and other game products in Canada. 

   Chieftain, based in Downsview, Ontario, said it seeks an injunction to prevent Coleco's Coleco (Canada) Ltd. unit from selling Scrabble in Canada, beginning in April. 
Chieftain has been selling Scrabble in Canada since 1980, and claims that it signed an agreement with Coleco in 1986 that provided for extension of the marketing arrangement beyond April. 

   A spokesman for Coleco said that a letter of intent to extend the original agreement was signed in September 1986, but that the letter was subject to a full agreement, which Coleco says never took place. 
The spokesman further said that Coleco informed Chieftain in December 1986 that Coleco intended to market Scrabble on its own. 
Coleco "will vigorously contest" the suit, the spokesman said. 

   Closely held Chieftain is seeking $15 million in damages related to the alleged breach of contract.
