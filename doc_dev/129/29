JW SPEAR, the maker of Scrabble and other games, yesterday announced profits
up by more than 46 per cent to Pounds 3.71m for the year to December 31,
compared with Pounds 2.53m.
The group switched pension fund managers from Scottish Amicable to Scottish
Widows at the beginning of 1992 following 'lacklustre performance', Mr Paul
Lipscombe, finance director, said.
Last July the routine actuarial revaluation had revealed a further charge to
the profit and loss reserve bringing the total to about Pounds 700,000 over
the last two years.
The charge was partly due to a shortfall between the fund's performance and
its projected liabilities.
The advance in profits came on turnover up 20 per cent, from Pounds 27.3m to
Pounds 32.8m.
Margins improved to more than 12 per cent (10.5 per cent).
Distribution costs rose some 40 per cent to Pounds 9.77m against Pounds
7.99m for the preceding year, mainly because of royalties paid under a
licensing arrangement for Atmosfear, the interactive video game.
A proposed final dividend of 11.5p (8p) brings the total distribution for
the year to 14p (10p) payable from earnings per share ahead from 32.3p to
47.3p.
