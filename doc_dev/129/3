scrap over Scrabble gathers pace

The battle between America's two leading toy makers moved to the Scrabble
board yesterday after Mattel trumped Hasbro's bid for JW Spear, the word
game's UK maker.
In the corporate finance equivalent of getting all seven letters out on a
triple word score, Spear's advisers solicited a Pounds 52m bid from Mattel
which was launched just five minutes before Thursday night's deadline.
The offer of Pounds 10 a share beats the 900p bid from Hasbro and was
immediately welcomed by Spear's board. However, Action Man maker Hasbro,
which has the rights to Scrabble in North America, is widely expected to
return with a higher offer.
'There must be a pretty good chance,' admitted a member of the Mattel team.
The scrap over Scrabble continues a rivalry which spilled over into the law
courts 18 months ago when Mattel claimed Hasbro's Sindy doll looked too
similar to its own Barbie. Mattel dropped its lawsuit after Hasbro agreed to
give Sindy a facelift.
Hasbro, which has held a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear since 1990, launched
its bid after it received undertakings to accept the offer from Spear family
trusts which control a further 24.9 per cent. The undertakings were to
become irrevocable if a higher offer was not received by midnight on
Thursday. The trusts have little option but to accept the highest bid.
The original bid split Spear's boardroom with Mr Francis Spear, chairman,
saying it was 'fair and reasonable' and the other directors dismissing it as
'totally inadequate'.
Although welcoming the new offer Mr Spear has yet to join the other
directors in advising shareholders that the Mattel offer 'represents a
better prospect for the future development of the business of Spear'.
Mr Spear is close to the Hassenfeld family which founded Hasbro but the rest
of the management are understood to be worried that Spear would disappear
within Hasbro's international games business.
In contrast, Spear would be the first sizeable move into board games for
Mattel, which has previously expressed interest in the area. This made it a
natural target for Barings, Spear's advisers, when searching for a rival
bidder. Mattel finally responded at 5pm and Robert Fleming, its swiftly
appointed merchant bank, launched the bid six hours later.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Mattel's
offer represents 18.4 times Spear's earnings last year.
