FT  03 JUN 94 / UK Company News: J W Spear search for white knight
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Advisers to Scrabble maker J W Spear were last night still searching for a
white knight to top the Pounds 47m bid for the company from US toy giant
Hasbro.
But it looked increasingly unlikely that their efforts would be successful
ahead of this morning's deadline when acceptances from Spear family trusts
owning 24.9 per cent of the shares become irrevocable.
Hasbro already has a 26.7 per cent stake in Spear acquired four years ago.
Barings has asked the Spear trustees to forward a letter to the
beneficiaries which questions why the bid should be accepted, given that all
the Spear board, barring the chairman Francis Spear, believe it is
inadequate.
