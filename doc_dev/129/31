   Toy company Hasbro Inc. on Thursday said
better profit margins and improved performances by its Milton
Bradley and Playskool units helped third-quarter earnings rise 73
percent.
   The company reported earnings of $31.3 million, or 53 cents per
share, compared with $18.08 million, or 31 cents a share, in 1988's
third quarter. Revenue rose 9.4 percent to $403 million in the
quarter ended Sept. 30 from $368.4 million a year earlier.
   ``As anticipated, our third quarter gross profit margin improved
from that of the second quarter,'' said Alan G. Hassenfeld,
chairman and chief executive.
   Along with better revenue by Milton Bradley and Playskool, which
concentrates on toys for infants and young children, international
operations showed improvement, despite being hurt by a strong
dollar, Hassenfeld said.
   Analysts had said the Milton Bradley unit's board games could
take a beating from video games.
   Hasbro recently bought many of the products formerly
manufactured by Coleco Industries Inc., including Cabbage Patch
dolls, Scrabble and Parcheesi.
   These additions plus a new line of battery powered racing cars
called Record Breakers places Hasbro in a good position to enter
the Christmas buying season, Hassenfeld said.
   For the first nine months of this year, Hasbro earned $68.2
million, or $1.15 a share, up nearly 33 percent from $51.3 million,
or 88 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue totaled $992.7
million, about 3 percent higher than $962.9 million in 1988.
