Good sales in the run up to Christmas helped Hasbro, the biggest US toy
maker, report a 12 per cent increase in fourth-quarter turnover to Dollars
932.2m. But a charge to cover the cost of closing its factory in the
Netherlands, announced last month, limited profits growth to 8 per cent.
Net income was Dollars 70.7m compared with Dollars 65.6m last time, while
earnings per share were 7 per cent ahead at 78 cents. Hasbro said if it had
not been for the Dollars 15m charge it took against pre-tax profits for the
plant closure, net income would have risen by 22 per cent.
Hasbro said some of its biggest domestic successes came from its Kenner
division, which handles its Littlest Pet Shop and Jurassic Park lines.
Hasbro Toy, after difficulties earlier in the year, saw good sales of
Tonka's Talk 'n Play Fire Truck and The Real Power Tool Shop.
The Playskool operation was buoyed by successes with Talking Barney and
traditional products like Play-Doh and Tinkertoy. The games division saw
good sales of new products like Don't Wake Daddy, Ask Zandar and Jenga, and
traditional games like Monopoly, Scrabble and The Game of Life.
Internationally, the company saw strong performances from its operations in
Canada, Mexico, Britain and Germany, but suffered the currency translation
effects of the rising US dollar.
For the full year, revenues rose by 8 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn, net income
rose by 12 per cent to Dollars 200m, and earnings per share rose by 10 per
cent to Dollars 2.22.
Hasbro will join other US toy manufacturers in unveiling its new products
for 1994 at the American International Toy Fair in New York next week.
