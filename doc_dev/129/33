   Hasbro Inc. announced Monday it has
agreed to purchase certain assets of the indoor-outdoor children's
furniture and ride-on divisions of financially troubled Coleco
Industries Inc. for $21 million.
   Under the agreement, Hasbro officials said it will purchase
specific assets, including inventory and tooling, machinery and
equipment and some property rights.
   Hasbro will also buy two manufacturing facilities in Amsterdam,
N.Y., officials said, where the acquired product lines are produced.
   The lines include plastic wading and splashing pools, pool
filers, children's outdoor furniture and clubhouses, and pedal- and
battery-operated cycles.
   Those lines, which helped launched Coleco in the toy business in
1956, had sales last year of $77 million. The toymaker is based in
West Hartford, Conn.
   ``The addition of these products will provide additional balance
and stability to our overall line,'' said Hasbro chairman Stephen
Hassenfeld in a printed release.
   The agreement is subject to approval by the board of directors
of both companies.
   The deal has been a topic of speculation for more than a month.
   Coleco has been trying since March without success to
restructure its massive debt.
   The company had proposed exchanging $335 million of bonds for a
combination of new bonds and stock, saying the exchange would save
it millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cash
for the business.
   When that plan collapsed, Coleco received short-term financing
from a group of 12 foreign and domestic lenders, to which it owes
$103 million.
   The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls and Scrabble board games. It lost $47.4 million in the first
quarter that ended April 2. It has lost money in four of the past
five years, including $215 million in the last two years.
