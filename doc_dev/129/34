   Hasbro Inc. plans to begin producing
popular Cabbage Patch Kids dolls immediately now that it has
completed the purchase of most product lines from financially
troubled Coleco Industries Inc., the company says.
   Hasbro, the nation's largest toymaker, completed its purchase of
Coleco's major assets on Wednesday for $85 million cash and an
option for Coleco to purchase 1 million shares of Hasbro at $28.85
after its bankruptcy plan was confirmed, said Barry Alperin,
Hasbro's executive vice president.
   Hasbro closed at $20 on the American Exchange Wednesday, down 25
cents.
   The Pawtucket-based company said it had reached agreement with
Original Appalachian Artworks, owner and creator of Cabbage Patch
Kids, to begin manufacturing the dolls immediately, in time to
advertise them for Christmas.
   The dolls would be made overseas and packaged at Hasbro's Milton
Bradley division in East Longmeadow, Mass., Alperin said. Most of
Coleco's other lines, including Scrabble, Parcheesi, Perfection and
Aggravation, also would be produced in Massachusetts.
   ``Milton Bradley ... has the capacity there and they've handled
things like this before,'' Alperin said.
   Hasbro also bought the right to use Coleco's name and would
discontinue some of its products, including Alf and Wrinkles,
Alperin said.
   Chairman Alan G. Hassenfeld said the acquisition would add ``some
time-tested products which will enrich Hasbro's three divisions
without material additions to our cost structure.''
   Hasbro's third division is Playskool.
   ``We will be putting on some people to handle Cabbage Patch, but
we're talking tens or twentys,'' Alperin said. ``These are short
term decisions and we'll deal with this on a long term basis as we
get into it.''
   Alperin said the Cabbage Patch line, which was the largest
selling toy of all time in 1985, ``has not had the attention it
deserved over the past couple of years.''
   Sales of Cabbage Patch peaked at more than $600 million in 1985,
compared with $58 million last year.
   But the transaction's success does not rest solely on Cabbage
Patch products, Alperin said. Some of the board games, for example,
``are tried and true names in the games field,'' he said.
   Alperin would not release internal figures estimating projected
revenues for the new products.
   Coleco is far from Hasbro's most ambitious purchase. It aqcuired
Milton Bradley in 1984 for more than $350 million, Alperin said.
   The Connecticut-based Coleco filed for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act a year ago,
citing debts of $540.3 million.
