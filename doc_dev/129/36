   Nina Rust rode an elephant and an airplane
on previous birthdays, but this year she took it easy. It was,
after all, her 109th year.
   The Roseburg woman went to the Wildlife Safari animal park in
Winston for her birthday Monday and had lunch at the White Rhino
restaurant overlooking a pond and an island providing habitat for
white gibbon apes.
   On her 99th birthday, she went to the animal park to take her
first elephant ride. She decided the ride was a bit bumpy and has
never duplicated the feat. On her 100th, she had her first airplane
flight
   In 1982, at age 101, she drove back to Lincoln, Neb., with her
daughter, Phyllis McMeekin of Roseburg, for a family gathering.
They then flew to Philadelphia and toured several Eastern states.
   When she turned 103, ``Dear Reader,'' a book about Rust's life
was published. It was written by McMeekin, with whom Rust has lived
for the past 35 years. Also in 1984, Rust's first
great-great-great-grandchild was born.
   Although not a first, Rust danced with her son-in-law and
another man on her 105th birthday during a party at the Senior
Center. Later in the year, McMeekin caught Rust crocheting and
reading at the same time. When she commented on it, Rust said, ``I
can't waste any time.''
   Her 106th year brought her first ride on a motorcycle. Her
grandson took her on the ride around the trailer park where Rust
lives. Upon dismounting the motorcycle, Rust announced, ```There,
I've done one more thing I'd never done in my life,''' McMeekin
recalled.
   While Rust was 107 years old, she had a lens implant in her
right eye, which improved her vision so she could continue
crocheting granny squares. During the 2{ years that ended June
1989, Rust crocheted nearly 1,900 granny squares.
   During the past year, a book titled ``One Hundred over 100,''
was published and included an article about Rust. The author, Jim
Heynen, interviewed Rust when she was 106 years old.
   In the interview, she and Heynen played Scrabble and Rust won by
about 20 points. In the book, Heynen describes her as the kind of
person who will hoard the ``U'' letter squares when she knows her
opponent has the ``Q.''
   Scrabble, Anagrams and Aggravation have long been Rust's
favorite games. She also enjoys word puzzles and reading.
   Her hearing has deteriorated in the last few years, so she
doesn't visit with people as much as she used to. In past years,
McMeekin said Rust and her oldest daughter would reminisce for
hours.
   Rust was born June 18, 1881, in a sod house in Hainesville, Neb.
She and her husband were married in Butte, Neb., and they had 12
children. All but one are still living.
   Daughter Emma Nelson, of Norfolk, Neb., died in 1989 at age 77.
The other children range from age 87 to 65.
   Rust has 211 descendants. Besides her children, there are 36
grandchildren, 86 great-grandchildren, 74 great-great-grandchildren
and four great-great-great-grandchildren.
