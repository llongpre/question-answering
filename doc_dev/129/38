   Coleco Industries Inc., which soared
to the top of the toy industry in the mid-1980s with its Cabbage
Patch Kids and then skidded into debt as the dolls' popularity
waned, announced today it filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   Coleco said the filing, which did not include its Canadian and
other foreign subsidiaries, was made Monday evening in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.
   The toymaker said the filing followed the refusal of its
short-term bank lenders to agree to provide the company with an
adequate working capital credit line.
   Coleco also announced that Morton E. Handel, who is recovering
from recent open-heart surgery, has submitted his resignation as
chief executive officer, citing the company's need for a full-time
CEO during this period. He will continue as chairman of the company.
   The board of directors appointed J. Brian Clarke, currently
president and chief operating officer, as president and chief
executive officer.
   The bankruptcy filing had been expected after Coleco was unable
to persuade its bondholders to agree to a $335 million debt
restructuring. The company lost $47.4 million in the quarter that
ended April 2 and has suffered losses in four of the past five
years, including $215 over the last two years.
   Coleco owes more than $100 million to a group of foreign and
domestic lenders.
   In recent weeks, the company has tried to raise cash by selling
off some of its product lines. On Monday, Hasbro Inc., the nation's
largest toymaker, said it had agreed to purchase some of Coleco's
assets and lines for $21 million, including the plastic wading and
splashing pools and children's outdoor furniture lines.
   Those lines, which helped launched Coleco in the toy business in
1956, had sales last year of $77 million.
   Coleco also has slashed its work force in an effort to cut
costs. It currently has fewer than 600 employees in the United
States, down from an average of 2,500 last year.
   Besides Cabbage Patch Kids, Coleco manufactures Alf dolls, Big
Wheels plastic tricycles and board games, such as Scrabble.
Industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the
nation's toy market.
   Analysts said the same aggressive management style that helped
Coleco hit the jackpot with the gamble on Cabbage Patch Kids in
1983 helped bring on its troubles.
   The dolls, introduced in 1983 after a number of other toy
companies rejected the product, helped Coleco end 1985 in its
strongest financial condition ever, with sales of $776 million and
record earnings of $64 million.
   But the Cabbage Patch fad abated and analysts said the company
did not pare its costs soon enough. When the toy industry suffered
a slump in 1987, the company was hit particularly hard.
   Coleco has faced tough times before. It entered the snowmobile
business in 1972, but snowfalls were light for the next three
years, the economy was depressed and losses were heavy.
   The company posted a $22 million loss in 1978, threatening its
survival. In 1980 the Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Coleco with misstating its financial results to mask troubles.
   In 1982 the company began a move toward prosperity with the
introduction of its ColecoVision home video game system. The
company saw its future in electronics, and in 1983 unveiled its
$600 Adam home computer.
   Adam was a monumental flop, while sales of ColecoVision cooled.
The company lost $79.8 million in 1984 despite $540 million in
sales of Cabbage Patch Kids.
