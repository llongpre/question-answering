<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Sale of Coleco to Hasbro</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy judge has approved the sale
of financially troubled Coleco Industries Inc.'s major product lines
to the nation's largest toymaker, Hasbro Inc.
   Under the terms of the deal, Hasbro will pay $85 million in cash
for most of Coleco's products, including such widely known toys as
the Cabbage Patch Kids and the Scrabble and Parcheesi board games.
   Approval of the sale Friday signaled the end of the nearly
yearlong bankruptcy case of the Avon, Conn.-based toymaker.
   Judge Prudence B. Abram, who approved the sale, predicted that
the complex case, which has involved a frequently acrimonious battle
between creditors, could be wrapped up by the fall.
   Coleco filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11
of the Federal Bankruptcy Act on July 11, 1988, citing debts of
$540.3 million.
   Barry Alperin, Hasbro's executive vice president, testified
Friday that the Pawtucket, R.I., company wants to complete the
purchase by next week so it can begin advertising and producing the
Coleco products before the Christmas sales season begins.
   Once the sale is completed, most of the remaining 80 employees at
Coleco's headquarters will be laid off in phases as the business is
closed and the court case completed, said J. Brian Clark, Coleco's
president and chief executive officer.
   After the sale, Coleco will retain a few minor toy products, some
real estate and more than $135 million in cash _ the $85 million
from Hasbro plus $50 million in the bank.
   Coleco plans to sell its remaining products and real estate and
reorganize as a new company. Most of the new company's stock will be
owned by Coleco's creditors, with current stockholders owning a
minority interest.
   Coleco's largest creditors, New York businessmen Isaac Perlmutter
and Bernard Marden, will receive a total of $65 million of the cash
gained through the reorganization.
   The payment is $26 million less than the total owed to them, but
the two agreed to the reduced amount to settle a lawsuit filed
against them by the unsecured creditors' committee in the bankruptcy
case.
   The committee's suit charged that Perlmutter and Marden cheated
Coleco out of $71 million through separate business dealings with
the company from 1986 to 1988.
   When Coleco reorganizes, it will have to come up with a new name
because Hasbro is buying the right to use the Coleco name on toys.
   Handel joked during testimony Thursday that executives had
considered but rejected the name ``Toys Were Us.''
