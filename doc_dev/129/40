JOHN CASSAVETES SEASON ICA
Do we need the sight of a great modern film-maker jumping out at us from
behind a camera and saying 'Boo]'? This in essence is the experience
provided by Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear. There are more gratuitous coups de
cinema per minute than there are quills per inch upon a fretful porcupine.
Remaking the 1962 hoodlum-at-large thriller that starred Gregory Peck and
Robert Mitchum, Scorsese provides a lexicon of visual ingenuities. Jump
cuts, painted skies, zoom-in-track-outs, rearing crane shots (even in
intimate conversation scenes), colour mutating to monochrome . . . Yet that
is all the film sometimes seems like: a lexicon. One is reminded of Bruce
Willis's breathless aside in The Last Boy Scout when he and his chum are
attacked by a loquaciously abusive baddie: 'Feels like we're being beaten up
by the inventor of Scrabble.'
Scorsese's game is Movie Scrabble. You win a double-quote-score for wryly
invoking the original Cape Fear, as when an ageing Peck and Mitchum stroll
into cameo roles as sleazy lawyer and Southern sheriff respectively. And you
win a triple-quote-score if, like Robert De Niro as the vengeful ex-convict
who pursues and psychologically torments the defence lawyer who failed him
(Nick Nolte) plus his wife (Jessica Lange) and nubile daughter (Juliette
Lewis), you can pay tribute to as many roles and actors as possible.
De Niro's Max Cady is one part Mitchum - more The Night Of The Hunter than
Cape Fear - to several large parts of Lionel Barrymore and GD Spradlin. With
his Hawaian shirt, airport sun-glasses and loony ebullience, he also
suggests Fred Flintstone on a works outing to Florida. (The nominal setting
is North Carolina but the film was shot, and looks like it, around Fort
Lauderdale). The movie is fun, but is it art? Like any good game of Scrabble
it is at least for a while diverting. From the first image in the titles
sequence - the camera rising from primeval waters to cue jagged letters
against a riverswept background - Scorsese is determined to go Gothic.
Hammer-horror cloudscapes lower over Nolte and Lange's handsome mansion;
deep-focus effects pay homage to Citizen Kane; and fairy-tale ghoulishness
is invoked in the queasy scene where De Niro, luring Miss Lewis's pubescent
teenager to the school basement cum makeshift theatre, plays Big Bad Wolf to
her Red Riding Hood with a mock-up gingerbread cottage behind him. This duel
of innuendo between a shyly ripening girl and a slippery psychopath - we
have already seen him brutalise a woman and bite a chunk from her cheek -
has a quietly hypnotic power.
But typically of this cleverer-than-thou thriller Miss Lewis, unlike her
1962 predecessor, is no innocent. Coming 30 years on to the same story
(based on John D MacDonald's novel The Executioners), Scorsese and
screenwriter Wesley Strick feel they must muddy the Manichean waters of good
guys versus bad. But in doing so, they also muddy its dramatic clarity of
purpose.
Nolte and Lange are an overwritten problem couple with an over-telegraphed
problem daughter. He is a he-man repressed by small-town life, his small
eyes penned in behind wire-rim specs. She is a designer with a Lange-ian
line in tremulous hysteria.
They are clearly in such deep domestic turmoil already - with his
infidelities and her keening reproaches - that the arrival of Mr Madman from
the Slammer would seem a minor addition to their problems. Possibly even a
welcome diversion. As a result the violent finale aboard a drifting,
waveswept houseboat - where De Niro keeps bobbing back to life in the best
ghoul-can't-help-it tradition - has the frivolous excitement of a fairground
ride rather than the visceral horror of a face-to-face with death.
With no sense of emotional hazard there is no sense of suspense. Instead of
a horrified 'Ah no]' in response to scenes, we keep mouthing an admiring 'Ah
yes]' The director who crafted Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and GoodFellas is
here aided by a good cameraman (Freddie Francis) and a great production
designer (Henry Bumstead of Vertigo). But all that results is that the
tunnel-vision intensity the tale requires is ousted by decorative overkill.
This even extends to the star player. De Niro lolls across the CinemaScope
screen as if determined to colonise every inch of it. He snarls and croons
and teases; he savours his Southern accent like fine wine. He is a
vaudeville charmer in a vaudeville thriller. His only saving grace is that,
unlike everyone else in the film, he seems to know it is a deep dark joke
and not to be taken seriously as a spinechiller-turned-psychodrama.
Worse, far worse, is the Euro-comedy Once Upon A Crime. What a title. They
probably came up with it after rejecting Sweet Sistine and Abandon Pope for
this Rome-set plot about a murder, a valuable dachshund and six
second-magnitude stars hurtling about delivering dead dialogue. They include
Cybill Shepherd, James Belushi, Sean Young, John Candy and an
embarrassed-looking George Hamilton wearing boot polish as a tanned,
over-age toyboy.
Did I say Rome? Well, it begins there, then moves to Monte Carlo. But by
this stage the Press show audience was being examined by a doctor for signs
of rigor mortis. Startlingly, or perhaps not, three writers are credited
with having struggled over the script. The best dialogue exchange - 'Are you
finished?", 'No, I'm Swedish' - will give you a measure of the rest. Eugene
Levy directed.
Men Of Respect is Macbeth remade as a Mafia thriller. Dr Jonathan Miller is
to blame for all this. Dear me, the cultural cost of that Rigoletto. Here we
have Rod Steiger and Peter Boyle among the Cosa Nostra bigwigs, John 'Barton
Fink' Turturro as the modern Macbeth ('No man born of woman can do shit to
me') and Katherine Borowitz as a Mafiosa Lady M given to scouring the
bathroom with bleach. Meanwhile Banquo is called Banky, MacDuff Duffy and
Malcolm Mal. When they do Hamlet it will no doubt be Hammy, Ophie and Gert.
William Reilly wrote and directed.
Far better to visit the ICA's John Cassavetes season, running for one more
week. The wild man of American cinema, who died last year, made films that
were like the fearless, flailing revelations of a patient under truth serum.
He wrote his own stories - of marital break-up and nervous breakdown, of
high and low living on the Bohemian fringes - and had them improvised into
life by his handpicked repertory of actor-friends. Ben Gazzara, Peter Falk,
Gena Rowlands, himself: his favourite stars kept being recycled in plots
that were as untidy as Columbo's mac and as challengingly, endearingly
human. Shadows, Faces, A Woman Under The Influence, The Killing Of A Chinese
Bookie. The best is here. Catch it while you can.
