   Troubled Coleco Industries Inc. has agreed
to sell most of its assets to Hasbro Inc. for $85 million in cash, a
deal analysts said means the demise of the toymaker that introduced
the hottest-selling toy in U.S. history, the Cabbage Patch doll.
   ``Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take
risks,'' said Paul Valentine, a toy analyst with New York-based
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. ``The industry is poorer because of their
demise.''
   Under the agreement announced Thursday, Avon-based Coleco, now
operating under Bankruptcy Court protection, also will receive
warrants to purchase 1 million shares of Hasbro stock.
   Pawtucket, R.I.-based Hasbro, the largest U.S. toymaker, will
receive Coleco's product line, which includes the Scrabble and
Parcheesi board games as well as the Cabbage Patch dolls, Coleco
Chairman Morton Handel said.
   In addition to buying inventory and the equipment to make the
products, Hasbro will buy certain accounts receivable, Handel said.
   Coleco will retain all of its cash assets and certain real estate
that it will convert to cash, Handel said. At the completion of the
transaction, Coleco will have as much as $150 million in cash _ the
$85 million from Hasbro and about $65 million Coleco had in the
banks in mid-March, Handel said.
   The cash will be used to pay off the company's debt, he said.
When Coleco filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago, it listed
debt of $540.3 million.
   The agreement still must be approved by the Bankruptcy Court,
Handel said. The deal is also subject to the approval of Original
Appalachian Artworks Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, and Coleco
directors.
   If the deal is approved, most of Coleco's remaining 250 employees
are expected to be laid off, although some may be hired by Hasbro,
Handel said.
   ``Coleco was pretty much the victim of its own success,'' said
David Leibowitz, senior vice president of New York-based American
Securities Corp. ``Cabbage Patch in 1985 was the largest single
selling toy of all time, selling $600 million-plus at wholesale.''
   The success of the homely Cabbage Patch dolls forced Coleco to
expand, borrowing money to do so, he said. When Cabbage Patch Kids
sales tumbled and new products _ including the Adam home computer
and toys based on Rambo movies _ did not sell, the company could not
pay off the new debts, he said.
   Valentine said Arnold Greenberg, the former Coleco chairman,
managed the company too aggressively without focusing on cost
controls.
   ``They managed their company for a sales revival that never
came,'' Valentine said. But, he added, it was Greenberg who
transformed Coleco into a major company.
   Greenberg's Russian immigrant father, Maurice Greenberg, founded
the company as the Connecticut Leather Co. in Hartford in 1932,
selling leather and shoe heels and soles. The company expanded into
toys in 1954.
   Arnold Greenberg joined Coleco full time in 1966. He bought the
license to the Cabbage Patch Kids in 1982 after several major toy
companies turned down the dolls, which were designed with their own
set of adoption papers.
   For growing Hasbro, which in the last decade has bought such
big-name toymakers as Milton Bradley Co. and introduced a steady
stream of new products, the deal means yet another line of toys.
   Hasbro, which makes GI Joe, Mr. Potato Head, My Little Pony and
the Transformers, had sales of $1.34 billion last year, up from just
$104.3 million in 1980.
   ``Under Hasbro, I think Cabbage Patch will grow substantially
over the next few years,'' Valentine said. ``Even Barbie has her ups
and downs. The Cabbage Patch Kids won't wilt forever.''
