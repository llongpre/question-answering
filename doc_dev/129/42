<LEADPARA>  Shareware programs are available from computer bulletin boards and clubs.
Users try them, then pay a fee to register them if they decide to use them
regularly.;    SUPER SEARCH -- My hard disk is organized about as well as the
rest of my life. I can't remember where I put my brown socks, so I wear my
suede wingtips with white socks. My string ties, which I wear to users'
meetings, are hopelessly tangled next to my plastic pencil holders. While
there isn't much hope for my wardrobe, and many have tried to bring order, if
not fashion, into my life, there is hope for my hard disk. You could spend
hundreds of dollars for commercial file-exploring utilities.  </LEADPARA>

Box 262, Dedham, Mass., 02026.;    SCRAMBLE -- If you're looking for a dandy
word game that uses a tilelike format, this is one that is easy to learn, fun
to use and educational. When I tired of forming words I'd never heard of, I
let the computer play, then I played against the computer. Then I let the
computer compete with itself.;    Scramble is for computers that have EGA or
VGA video cards and monitors only. It works best with a mouse, but folks with
just a keyboard may play, too. Players may add to its dictionary, and in
general you get all the features of Scrabble without having to hunt down the
tiles. Scramble may be registered for $15 from Tud Gruber Software, P.O. Box
13408, Las Vegas, Nev., 89112.;    TIKLER -- If you're as tired as I am of
sticking yellow reminders on your phone, your PC and your cat, here's a very
nice little reminder and appointment program.;    Tikler lets you specify how
many days in advance you want to be reminded about anything from birthdays to
job interviews. You may edit entries, delete them, see past appointments and
even look into the future. Even if you're not familiar with how these programs
work, you'll be up and running shortly after you copy the files. Tikler gives
you password security, and it allows you to print your appointments. If you
know you have an appointment tomorrow with your boss, but you've forgotten
when, simply search for "boss" and your appointment will pop up on the
screen.;    You can put Tikler in your autoexec.bat so that it's the first
thing to pop up when you boot up in the morning. It will work with monochrome
or color monitors and it will work fine on floppy or hard disk. To register,
send $15 to Olsen Outdoors, 68 Hartwell Ave., Littleton, Mass., 01460.  </TEXT>
