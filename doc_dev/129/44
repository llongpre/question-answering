   Hasbro Inc. officials declined comment
Tuesday on published reports that Hasbro, the world's biggest
toymaker, would buy most of Coleco Industries Inc. under a plan to
be presented in bankruptcy court.
   The Hartford Courant said Tuesday that sources close to
Avon-based Coleco's 10-month-old bankruptcy case told the newspaper
that details of the plan still were being negotiated.
   Barry Alperin, executive vice president of Hasbro Inc., declined
to comment on the report, saying the companies were forbidden from
discussing the case in public by an order last month from U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   A secretary for Coleco's chairman, Morton Handel, said he would
be away from his office all day. She declined to say where he could
be contacted.
   Representatives of Hasbro, Coleco and Coleco's creditors are
scheduled to appear Wednesday in bankruptcy court in New York to
discuss the plan.
   The deal expected to be announced Wednesday would strengthen
Hasbro's position in the toy business by adding such well-known
Coleco items as Cabbage Patch Kids and Scrabble and Parcheesi board
games to its product lines.
   While many details are unknown, sources told The Courant that
the deal would provide that:
   _Much of Coleco would be sold to Hasbro, but it could not be
determined whether Pawtucket, R.I.-based company would buy all of
Coleco or just most of its assets. If Coleco is sold, it would end
57 years as an independent company.
   _Coleco's committee of unsecured creditors would drop its $71
million lawsuit against the company's largest creditors, New York
businessmen Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard Marden.
   _Perlmutter and Marden, in turn, would reduce their $80 million
claim against Coleco by an undetermined amount.
   The lawsuit contends that Perlmutter and Marden, who are secured
creditors, cheated Coleco out of millions of dollars through a
complex scheme of trading television advertising time for products.
   The deal would be a victory for Coleco's unsecured creditors,
because a reduced claim by Perlmutter and Marden means more money
would be available to repay them, the newspaper said. Coleco had
debts of $540.3 million when it filed for protection from its
creditors under the bankruptcy laws in July.
   Coleco grew to be one of the nation's largest toy companies
during the past decade, propelled in large part by its Cabbage
Patch Kids dolls.
   But demand for the dolls dropped beginning in 1986 and Coleco
was not successful at introducing new products to make up for the
lost sales. The company sought Bankruptcy Court protection last
year.
   Coleco filed its first reorganization plan in late January,
detailing how it planned to repay creditors. But that proposal
immediately was rejected by the creditors' committee, which said it
provided inadequate payment and appeared to favor Perlmutter and
Marden's interests over the committee's.
   The plan would have given Perlmutter and Marden 55 percent of
the stock of a reorganized Coleco and a note for $40 million in
cash. Creditors would have received about 36 percent of Coleco
stock and no cash, a plan they valued at about 5 cents for every $1
they are owed.
   In March, Coleco said it was considering selling the company
outright to resolve its financial problems.
   A few weeks later, however, the company reversed itself and said
it would instead propose a new reorganization plan offering a
larger repayment to creditors, consisting of about 10 cents for
every $1 of debt, plus 37 percent of Coleco's stock.
   Coleco had not yet filed that new plan with the Bankruptcy Court
when creditors announced April 19 that they had negotiated a deal
to sell most of Coleco to Hasbro for more than $85 million in cash.
