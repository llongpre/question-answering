   Coleco Industries Inc. creditors say they have
agreed to settle lawsuits stemming from the troubled toymaker's
11-month bankruptcy case.
   The settlement, announced Wednesday during a hearing in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, must be approved by the court.
   Meanwhile, no details were released about a proposal by Hasbro
Inc., the nation's largest toy manufacturer, to purchase most of
Coleco. But Daniel Golden, an attorney for Coleco, said
negotiations concerning the sale of most Coleco assets continued.
   Richard Tilton, a lawyer for Hasbro, said he expected a joint
statement on the proposed sale would be issued next week. He
declined to discuss details of the plan, saying it still was
``subject to a number of conditions that need to be discussed.''
   The creditors' settlement announced Wednesday calls for Coleco's
largest creditors, Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard Marden, to receive
$61 million of their $87 million claim against Coleco.
   Unsecured creditors of the company based in Avon, Conn., would
drop their $71 million lawsuit against Perlmutter and Marden, under
the settlement.
   The unsecured creditors had claimed that Perlmutter and Marden,
secured creditors, cheated Coleco out of millions of dollars
through a complex scheme of trading television advertising time for
products.
   Tilton said the settlement would mean that Perlmutter could not
finance Coleco's reorganization plan as originally intended. But
Tilton said alternative sources of funding could be found. He did
not elaborate.
   Coleco, which grew to be one of the nation's largest toymakers
during the past decade, suffered a change in fortune in 1986, when
demand for its Cabbage Patch dolls dropped.
   New lines introduced by the company failed to make up for lost
sales, and Coleco sought Bankruptcy Court protection last July,
citing debts of $540.3 million.
   A first reorganization plan filed by Coleco in January was
rejected immediately by the creditors' committee.
   The plan would have given Perlmutter and Marden 55 percent of
the stock of a reorganized Coleco and a note for $40 million in
cash. Creditors would have received about 36 percent of Coleco
stock and no cash, a plan they valued at about 5 cents for every $1
they are owed.
   In March, Coleco said it was considering a sale of the company,
but reversed itself a few weeks later, filing a new reorganization
plan it hoped would satisfy creditors.
   The new plan offered a larger repayment, including about 10
cents for every $1 of debt, plus 37 percent of Coleco's stock.
   On April 19, before the second plan was filed with the
Bankruptcy Court, creditors announced they had negotiated a deal to
sell most of Coleco to Hasbro for more than $85 million in cash.
   The deal would add well-known Coleco items such as the Cabbage
Patch Kids and Scrabble and Parcheesi board games to Hasbro's
product lines, it has been reported.
   Coleco officials, upset by the Hasbro proposal, asked U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Prudence B. Abram on April 20 to issue a
restraining order prohibiting creditors from pursuing the plan with
Hasbro.
   Instead, Abram urged the two sides to strike a compromise.
