   PAWTUCKET, R.I. -- Hasbro Inc. said net income rose 61% in
the fourth quarter, reflecting a 54% increase in revenue
buoyed by healthy Christmas sales and contributions from its
acquisition last year of Tonka Corp.
   Hasbro, the nation's largest toy and game maker, posted
net of $44.8 million, or 76 cents a share, compared with
$27.9 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier.

   Fourth-quarter revenue of $761.2 million, up from $492.8
million in the 1990 fourth quarter, included $202 million
from Tonka; excluding Tonka, revenue still grew a healthy
13%.
   "Hasbro finished up for the year in strong fashion, and
its results are right in line with expectations," said
analyst Gary M. Jacobson of Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. He pointed
out that the company's earnings were depressed in the 1990
fourth quarter because of write-offs from several toy
retailers -- including Child World Inc. -- that were having
difficulties.
   "The integration of {Tonka} operations is now
substantially complete, and we expect they will be a positive
contributing factor to the combined operations in 1992," said
Alan G. Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive officer.
   Hasbro was helped by the Christmas sales successes of
Go-Go My Walking Pup, Scrabble, Electronic Hotshot Basketball
and the revitalized G.I. Joe line.
   Net for the year was $81.7 million, or $1.41 a share, on
revenue of $2.14 billion after a pretax restructuring charge
of $59 million recorded in the second quarter for the Tonka
purchase. In 1990, the company had net of $89.2 million, or
$1.54 a share, on revenue of $1.52 billion.
   The company's growth is increasingly coming from its
international business, which now accounts for about 40% of
revenue. While domestic revenue rose about 40% in the fourth
quarter from a year earlier, international revenue was about
70% higher, said John O'Neill, Hasbro's chief financial
officer.
