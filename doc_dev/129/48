   The head of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the top federal prosecutor of insider trading have
endorsed legislation that would make brokerage firms liable when
employees violate securities laws.
   However, SEC Chairman David S. Ruder and U.S. Attorney Rudolph
W. Giuliani cautioned Monday that the law should exempt firms and
supervisors that make a good-faith effort to prevent their
employees from using non-public information to profit from trading
in securities.
   They said a draft bill offered by Rep. Edward J. Markey,
D-Mass., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce finance
subcommittee, should more carefully spell out when brokerage firms
would be subject to fines for the violations of their employees.

   An Omaha, Neb. business executive accused of
passing inside corporate information to a friend who later used it
to buy stock gas settled civil charges by agreeing to pay the
government more than $282,000.
   Donald L. Sturm, 56, signed a consent agreement without
admitting guilt Monday, settling a civil insider trading lawsuit
filed the same day by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   The SEC accused Sturm, a bank owner who also is vice chairman of
Omaha-based Peter Kiewit Sons Inc., a construction and
manufacturing company, of getting non-public information from a
relative about the corporate takeover of a North Carolina air cargo
service.
   Sturm allegedly passed the information to a friend who bought
30,000 shares of stock with money loaned by Sturm and made $128,412
in trading profits, the SEC contended.

   Eastern Airlines has reported a 15.7 percent
decline in June passenger traffic in what the company called a
reflection of the continued ``downsizing'' of the financially
pressed carrier.
   Revenue passenger miles _ the amount of miles flown by paying
passengers _ were down 18.6 percent for the first six months of
1988 compared with the first half of 1987.
   An Eastern spokeswoman noted Monday that available seat miles in
June dropped 14.1 percent, while capacity from January through June
was down 13.5 percent from last year.
