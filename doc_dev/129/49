   Hasbro Inc. said Wednesday it had
completed the purchase of most of the product lines of financially
troubled Coleco Industries Inc., and would immediately begin
producing the popular Cabbage Patch Kids dolls.
   Hasbro, the nation's largest toymaker, agreed last week to
purchase Coleco's major assets for $85 million cash and an option
for Coleco to purchase 1 million shares of Pawtucket-based Hasbro at
$28.85 each after its bankruptcy reorganization plan was confirmed,
said Barry Alperin, Hasbro's executive vice president.
   Conneticut-based Coleco filed for protection from its creditors
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy act a year ago, citing
debts of $540.3 million.
   Hasbro stock closed at $20 Wednesday on the American Stock
Exchange, down 25 cents a share.
   Hasbro said it had reached agreement with Appalachian Artworks
Inc., creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, to begin manufacturing the
dolls immediately, in time to advertise them for Christmas.
   The dolls would be made overseas and packaged at Hasbro's Milton
Bradley division in East Longmeadow, Mass., Alperin said. Most of
Coleco's other lines, including the Scrabble and Parcheesi games
also would be produced in Massachusetts.
   Hasbro, which also bought the right to use Coleco's name, would
discontinue some of its products, including Alf and Wrinkles,
Alperin said.
   Chairman Alan G. Hassenfeld said the acquisition would add ``some
time-tested products which will enrich Hasbro's three divisions
without material additions to our cost structure.''
   Hasbro's third division is Playskool.
   Alperin said the Cabbage Patch line, which was the largest
selling toy of all time in 1985, ``has not had the attention it
deserved over the past couple of years.''
   Sales of Cabbage Patch peaked at more than $600 million in 1985
but slipped to $58 million by last year.
