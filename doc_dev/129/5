Under rows of harsh fluorescent lights, they sit at folding tables, hunched 
over boards covered with small, square tiles. 
</P>
<P>
The room is silent as 10 pairs of players sweat it out in a battle of wits, 
probing their minds for obscure words and letter combinations. 
</P>
<P>
They're playing Scrabble, but this is not exactly the game that many people 
remember playing with their grandmothers over pound cake and iced tea on Sunday 
afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
These are hard-core Scrabble players, many of whom also play chess, who enjoy 
the game for its challenge, discipline and mental stimulation. 
</P>
<P>
And they take their games seriously, memorizing hundreds of obscure words and 
mastering strategies and lingo. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Rock Scrabble Club was started in July by George Heussenstamm, a 
classical composer who teaches music composition and theory at Cal State Los 
Angeles and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
300 U.S. Clubs 
</P>
<P>
The club, one of more than 300 in the United States, meets from 7 to 10 p.m. 
the second and fourth Wednesday of the month in the Yosemite Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
Members pay $1 for admission, which covers Heussenstamm's mailings and the 
cookies and coffee provided at the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
When Heussenstamm, a veteran Scrabble aficionado, started the club, there were 
only a handful of players. 
</P>
<P>
Now the group averages 17, and he expects it to grow, following a national 
trend of increasing interest in the game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's something of an obsession," Heussenstamm said. "It's the kind of thing 
that once you start, it's hard to stop." 
</P>
<P>
The club is an eclectic mix of people. At one table, a thin, dark man is 
listening through earphones to a portable tape player, moving his head slightly 
as his eyes flicker back and forth across his tiles. 
</P>
<P>
His opponent is an unemployed Vietnam veteran who is also an avid chess player. 
</P>
<P>
At another table, a 22-year-old physics major from Occidental College is 
battling a heavyset woman who is an administrator with the Los Angeles school 
district. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Highly Organized 
</P>
<P>
Scrabble clubs are highly organized and strictly follow a set of Scrabble rules 
promulgated by Scrabble Crossword Game Players Inc., a national organization. 
</P>
<P>
Games are timed using chess clocks, and each player is allowed three minutes 
per move. And the players are serious about their games and strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Like chess, Scrabble entails strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
Players learn rack management, a method of keeping a balance of vowels and 
consonants. Good players also have to know when to pass their turn, and how to 
work toward bingos -- a move in which all seven letters are used in one turn. 
But the most important strategy is building vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
True Scrabble aficionados fervently study their Official Scrabble Players 
Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
They pore over lists of words, memorizing thousands of two- and three-letter 
words and their possible prefixes and suffixes to help them in their 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the word lists are so obscure that they almost look like random pages 
from a beginning Latin handbook. 
</P>
<P>
Scrabble players learn such oddities as "os," meaning orifice; "ta," an 
expression of gratitude, and "ho," an exclamation of surprise. 
</P>
<P>
"The key is in knowing your words," Heussenstamm said. "You have to build a big 
vocabulary if you want to be good at this game. It involves more than just 
slapping letters on a board." 
</P>
<P>
Someone bellows "challenge" from the far corner of the room, and Heussenstamm 
scurries away to settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Heussenstamm started the club in Eagle Rock because he wanted to be able to 
play in a group close to his La Crescenta home. 
</P>
<P>
But as director, he has duties to fulfill. 
</P>
<P>
If an even number of players show up, Heussenstamm doesn't play, and he must 
act as referee in the case of disputed words. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been somewhat sacrificial for me," Heussenstamm said. "I don't get to 
play much any more."
