   Terry Anderson, the longest held of the 16
Western hostages, helped fellow prisoners make Scrabble and
Monopoly games to amuse themselves, according to a newly freed
captive.
   His guards are giving him and other hostages plenty of
diversions, according to an account given by former hostage Frank
Reed to Anderson's sister, Peggy Say.
   ``They have a lot of things which was encouraging to me; at
least they did at the time Frank was there,'' Mrs. Say said. These
included boxes of books, writing materials and dominoes.
   Although Anderson, 42, the chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press, is in good physical condition from plenty of
exercise, he is tired and needs dental care, Mrs. Say said. She
said the hostages are blindfolded and chained in line with their
preference.
   ``Frank preferred a chain on his wrist,'' she said. ``Terry
preferred a chain on his ankle so that his arms are free to write
and play cards.''
   The closest she and Reed were able to calculate that he last saw
Anderson was somewhere between a year and 18 months ago. Reed spent
20 months with Anderson and Thomas Sutherland in Lebanon. For a
period of time, the three American hostages were together with two
others, John McCarthy and Brian Keenan.
   Reed, the director of the private Lebanon International School,
was freed April 30 after being held for 44 months. He is undergoing
medical checkups at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland and
met with Mrs. Say Monday night.
   Anderson is in his sixth year of captivity. Sutherland was a
dean at the American University of Beirut. McCarthy is a British
television journalist. Keenan, who is Irish, taught English at
American University.
   ``He is still a vindictive hearts player,'' Mrs. Say said of her
brother. Reed told her Anderson also reads voraciously, a book a
day.
   Reed said Anderson could pick up some things in Arabic from the
radio and have at least some idea of what he thought was going on
in the world. But his guards have made a concerted effort to keep
from him news of the deaths of his father and brother, both from
cancer, within four months of each other in 1986. Mrs. Say said she
believes that he still does not know.
   ``That's very difficult,'' she said. ``Part of you wants him to
have known and dealt with it and part of you believes it might be
too much for him if he found out in captivity.''
   But with his mind still sharp, he thinks of new birthdays
painfully uncelebrated for the two daughters he cares for so deeply.
   He is wracked with anguish at missing more than five years with
them, unable to savor the passage of Gabrielle from child to woman.
In Anderson's sixth year of captivity, Gabrielle turned 14 on April
26.
   He has never held Sulome, who was born three months after he was
kidnapped in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985, by Islamic
Jihad, a group loyal to Iran. She will be 5 on June 7.
   ``He was very verbal about his love of them and that was what he
wanted when he got out, to see his daughters,'' Mrs. Say said.
   Unlike Reed, who said he was brutally beaten by his kidnappers
for trying to escape twice, Anderson was left alone. Mrs. Say said
Reed told her Anderson was not beaten.
   Reed told Mrs. Say that her brother was aware of her tireless
campaign to free him and the other hostages.
   Mrs. Say, 49, shuttles between Washington and her home in
Kentucky. She has made several trips to the Middle East seeking his
release. She has met with President Bush, Pope John Paul II, the
archbishop of Canterbury and PLO leader Yasser Arafat. She fields
phone calls all hours of the day and night.
   ``The guards told him (Anderson) everytime I did something of
major import,'' Mrs. Say said. ``Because it has been a criticism
that I've heard, I said to him (Reed), `Does Terry think what I'm
doing is making him be held longer?' And he said, `Absolutely not.
That only gives him hope.'''
