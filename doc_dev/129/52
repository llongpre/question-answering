   Coleco Industries Inc. said it is dismissing 100 employees and closing two plants operated by its Selchow &amp; Righter Co. subsidiary and moving their operations to other plants. 

   The toy maker said the moves will let it sell the real estate and reduce overhead. 
Coleco declined to estimate potential savings from the move. 

   The company, which makes Cabbage Patch dolls, the Rambo action figure and other toys, acquired Selchow, maker of such board games as Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble, in May. 
A Coleco spokesman said sales of Selchow's products have been satisfactory. 

   Selchow facilities in Bay Shore and Holbrook, New York, will be closed. 
Coleco said it hopes to sell the real estate for $13 million. 
It declined to disclose whether the actions will result in any write-offs. 

   For the nine months ended Sept. 27, Coleco posted a net loss of $677,000 on sales of $426.9 million. 
Analysts have said they expect Coleco to report a loss for the year, reflecting the sharp decline in Cabbage Patch sales and the failure of diversification moves, such as the Selchow acquisition, to make up for the doll's decline.
