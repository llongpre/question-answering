   Michael Milken, whose financial wizardry helped
reshape 1980s corporate America but also led to his indictment for
fraud and racketeering, has resigned from Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. to form his own business.
   It was unclear what the impact of Milken's departure, disclosed
Thursday, would have on the government's case or on Drexel, where
Milken still commands tremendous loyalty.
   During his 19-year career at Drexel, Milken widely was credited
with creating a $175 billion-a-year market in the high-risk,
high-yield securities called junk bonds that turned Drexel from a
Wall Street also-ran into an investment powerhouse.

   Paramount Communications Corp. intensified
pressure on Time Inc., complaining of no response to its unsolicited
$10.7 billion bid and indicating the possibility of a sweetened
offer for the media giant.
   But Time's stock slumped $3.62{ to $171.50 a share Thursday on
the New York Stock Exchange on reports the Time board was leaning
toward making a cash tender offer for Warner Communications Inc. as
a way to foil Paramount's $175-a-share bid. Time and Warner
previously had agreed to merge in an all-stock deal.

   The U.S trade deficit narrowed dramatically to
$8.26 billion in April, its lowest level in nine months, but the
Bush administration is concerned that the strong dollar could stunt
future progress.
   April's deficit was down 13.4 percent from a revised March trade
gap of $9.54 billion, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.
   The improvement reflected a 0.8 percent increase in exports, to a
record $30.57 billion, and a 2.6 percent drop in imports, to $38.84
billion, despite rising prices for foreign oil.

   The operating rate for U.S. factories continued
to ease last month, and economists said the slower pace so far this
year should continue to cool inflationary pressures.
   The Federal Reserve said Thursday the operating rate in May was
83.8 percent, 0.3 percentage point below April's 84.1 percent. The
May rate matched the rate in March, which had declined 0.1
percentage point from February. Rates peaked in December and January
at 84.3 percent, a 10-year high.

   Coleco Industries Inc. agreed to sell most
of its assets to Hasbro Inc. for $85 million, marking the end of the
company that made the hottest-selling toy in U.S. history, the
Cabbage Patch Kid doll.
   Hasbro, the largest U.S. toymaker, will receive most of Coleco's
product line, which includes the Scrabble and Parcheesi board games,
as part of the all-cash deal, Coleco Chairman Morton Handel said
Thursday.
   The deal still must be approved by U.S. Bankruptcy Court, where
Coleco sought protection from its creditors one year ago. A hearing
on the sale is expected next week or in early July, Handel said.

   Meanwhile, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 on Thursday that states
may be required through private lawsuits to help pay for cleaning up
hazardous waste sites targeted under the Superfund law.

   The House overwhelmingly defeated an effort led
by Illinois lawmakers to weaken the chief reform measure in a $157
billion taxpayer bailout of the savings and loan industry.

that could have allowed 241 S&amp;Ls to escape a requirement calling for
the industry to come up with $6 billion in new capital by 1995 to
hedge against loan losses.
