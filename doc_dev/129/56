is like thinking aloud at Scrabble

Do not make the mistake of reading Caryl Churchill's new play before you see
it. The live performance of The Skriker is infinitely better than the text
suggests. And if I still do not like it, that may be due to a distaste for
fairies, spirits and the underworld, whether they come from the ancient
Greeks or a contemporary British writer. Possibly sheer prejudice on my
part.
The play is a mixture of old myth and modern madness. Two girls, one
pregnant, the other having aborted, become embroiled with spirits. A pagan
underworld, whether real or imagined, is all about them.
Chief among the spirits is the skriker, defined as 'a shapeshifter and death
portent, ancient and damaged'. As skrikers go, this one is relatively
modest: she describes herself as 'one of many, not a major spirit, but a
spirit'.
She has been around 'through all that stuff that you would call history,
Cavaliers and Roundheads, Henry VIII, 1066 and before'.
What she is doing in 1994 is less clear. Anyway, the skriker torments the
two girls with a variety of charms and threats. She is magnificently played
by Kathryn Hunter in one of the most physically and vocally versatile
performances I have seen.
An act of contortion at the start almost takes the breath away. Ms Hunter
keeps it up to the end, having been through several guises, young, old,
male, female. The style may be borrowed from Robert Lepage; the admiration
for the execution must be total.
Alongside the skriker is a large number of presumably lesser spirits. They
include the Kelpie, half-man and half-horse on a huge pair of stilts,
Rawheadandbloodybones, Yallery Brown, Jennie Greenteeth and Black Annis.
Apart from the spectacle and filling up the stage - Philippe Giraudeau on
stilts takes up a lot - their contribution is limited.
True, The Skriker contains an element of dance, especially when the
underworld hots up for dinner, but there is not very much of it. Perhaps
there should be more. There is only one song, when the spirits sing 'Drink,
drank, drunk'. The Skriker is not really a new departure into multi-art
forms; it remains essentially a play.
Easily the most fascinating part of it is the language. Churchill has
steeped herself, consciously or otherwise, in Gerard Manly Hopkins.
There are other allusions. The witches in Macbeth crop up repeatedly, there
is perhaps the Fool in King Lear, and references to nursery rhymes abound.
But it is Hopkins who dominates. The Skriker is studded with multiple
alliterations and playing with sounds and words - almost like thinking aloud
at Scrabble.
Hunter's opening speech lasts 14 minutes, which is another reason for
admiring her performance. It is not much shorter than Hopkins's Wreck of the
Deutschland. And when she says 'a bit a bite a bitter bread and he was
crumbs crumbling to dust panic. Better forget them, not always be talking
stalking walking working them over and understand still' the debt is plain.
Ms Churchill adds some engaging flourishes. There are also comic touches.
One of the girls after kissing the skriker spews out pound coins, the other
 -less friendly - live toads. But it is the linguistics that catch the
memory.
The two girls, Jacqueline Defferary, as the pregnant Lily, and Sandy McDade,
as Josie, are excellent. A curate's egg, The Skriker is worth seeing out of
curiosity. Les Waters directs and the music is by Judith Weir.
