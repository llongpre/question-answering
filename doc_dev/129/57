   Coleco Industries Inc. said it will, as expected, report "a very large loss" for both the fourth quarter and full year, primarily because of the rapidly fading popularity of its Cabbage Patch dolls. 

   A Coleco spokesman said the fourth-quarter loss would be greater than the $7.5 million loss reported in the third quarter, but wouldn't be more specific. 

   For the past month, analysts for PaineWebber Inc. and William Blair &amp; Co. have estimated that the fourth-quarter loss will exceed $50 million before taxes. 
These analysts said yesterday that they can't estimate the net loss because they aren't sure how Coleco will treat the tax consequences of the loss. 

   In the fourth quarter of 1985, West Hartford, Conn.-based Coleco earned $4.1 million, or 21 cents a share, after taking a $5 million charge to cover settlement of a shareholder lawsuit. 

   The toy company said 1986 sales exceeded $500 million, about 35% below 1985 sales of $776 million. 
Sales of Cabbage Patch products declined 58% to $250 million in 1986 from $600 million in 1985. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Coleco shares closed at $9, down 50 cents. 

   In a letter to shareholders, the company said gross profit margins fell because of lower prices for most Cabbage Patch products and "higher selling costs associated with advertising, promotion and consumer rebate programs." 

   Coleco is trying to reduce its reliance on Cabbage Patch dolls by acquiring other toy companies. 
As a result, the company said, "Coleco is well-positioned to return to profitability during 1987." 
William J. Kirchberger, the PaineWebber analyst, said he projects 1987 earnings of about $20 million, or 90 cents a share, far below Coleco's earnings in 1985, the peak year for Cabbage Patch products. 

   For 1985, Coleco posted net income of $82.9 million, or $5 a share, after an $18.7 million tax credit on previous losses and the $5 million charge from settling a lawsuit. 

   Results for 1986 were hurt by the costs of consolidating operations of the newly acquired companies, Coleco said. 
The new acquisitions include Selchow &amp; Righter Co., maker of board games such as Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble and Leisure Dynamics Inc., maker of "Wrinkles," a stuffed animal.
