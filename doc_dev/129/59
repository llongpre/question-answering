   Coleco Industries Inc., the
financially troubled toy company, announced Friday that it was
extending until Wednesday an exchange offer made to the holders of
$335 million of its bonds in an effort to restructure its debt.
   The company, maker of Cabbage Patch Kids dolls, has proposed
that investors exchange those securities for 6 million shares of
Coleco stock and new bonds worth $119 million. The company is in
default on that $335 million debt.
   Coleco Chairman Morton E. Handel has said the company might have
to seek protection from its creditors unless it can restructure the
debt and raise working capital.
   The company said in a statement it expected to improve the
exchange offer before the new deadline of 5 p.m. EDT Wednesday ``to
respond to discussions held between the company and
debentureholders over the past few weeks.
   ``The modified offers will substantially preserve the face
amount of the outstanding debentures, sharply reduce the company's
annual interest cost and provide debentureholders with a more
substantial interest in the company,'' the statement said.
   The company has extended the exchange offer twice before.
   Coleco also said it had terminated its agreement with Hallwood
Group Inc., the Cleveland company Coleco had hired to help it
restructure and avoid bankruptcy proceedings.
   Coleco also said it has cancelled its May 25 stockholders
meeting, which will be rescheduled.
   Coleco's other products include ALF dolls, Big Wheels plastic
tricycles and board games such as Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit.
Industry souces say the company holds about 5 percent of the
nation's toy market.
