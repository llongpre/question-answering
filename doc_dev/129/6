Virgin Mastertronics' "The Deluxe Computer Edition of Scrabble" trades away 
much of the familiar appeal of the classic board game for some intriguing bells 
and whistles. Serious players looking to exercise their skills and stretch 
their vocabularies probably will embrace the new features. 
</P>
<P>
But traditionalists will long for the competition, surprise and camaraderie 
possible only between human players. 
</P>
<P>
In its most basic form, this computer version of Scrabble -- actually a totally 
redesigned update of an earlier electronic version of the game -- closely 
resembles the actual board game. After fellow players -- human or computer -- 
and difficultly levels are chosen, random letters are assigned to each player. 
</P>
<P>
Words are formed and placed on the board in the same way you would with actual 
tiles. A very welcome calculating feature keeps track of the point values for 
all levels of scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, however, the computer version doesn't do a very good job of 
hiding tiles. Whether playing the computer or another human, it is all but 
impossible not to know what your opponent has in his/her/its rack. Using the 
hide feature doesn't help much either. 
</P>
<P>
We also found a lot to be desired with the huge (2.5 megabytes) dictionary 
program that comes with the game: golfer and offer for two. The game makers 
promised the entire "Official Scrabble Player's Dictionary," but our trusty 
1979 paperback edition turned out to be a bit more complete than the 1990 
electronic one. 
</P>
<P>
"Deluxe Computer Scrabble" has enough pluses to make it as a good solitaire 
game, but it is definitely not a substitute for an evening with the original 
board game and a couple of good friends.
