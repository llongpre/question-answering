<LEADPARA>  Q How do I get my 7-year-old son to stop spending so much time with his
Nintendo? He comes home and does his chores, and it's straight to that game
until 9 o'clock, when he's ready to go to bed.; -- Steve White, Phoenix  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>  A The answer is simple, many parents insist: Just say no to Nintendo.;   "Ask
the parent who is the parent in the house," says Bonnie Game of Menifee. "The
Nintendo is used only once a week at our house, and if the child is not
willing to abide by what the parent says, then the Nintendo is put away for
the next week.";   Nintendo in and of itself is not evil or corruptive of a
child, says Jim Trelease, who lectures on how to win children back from
television and video games.;   "In excess, Nintendo is harmful," he says. "You
have to consider what wasn't being done during that time. The child wasn't
talking to his friends, he wasn't playing sports, finishing his homework or
doing chores.";   Trelease feels an hour of Nintendo a day is plenty.;   But
weaning a child away from video games may be more difficult than simply laying
down the law.;   "You have to state what the rules are first, but taking away
video games also requires parents to be more involved," Trelease says. "You're
going to have to read to your child, and draw, and color and play chess and
Scrabble.";   Many parents love computer games because the children aren't
bugging them, Trelease says.;   "But parents have got to start raising their
children and stop watching them grow up," he says.;   Here are some other
ideas:;   (check) "Have your child buy Nintendo time," says P.T. Goodman of
Rocky Mount, N.C. "For the time spent playing outside, the child earns equal
time on the Nintendo. No time can be carried over to another day.";   (check)
"I made a Nintendo credit card for each of my children," says Aleta Adler of
Waldwick, N.J. "Each card lasted a week with 12 boxes, each box worth 15
minutes. I gave them a timer and each time the timer went off, they marked off
a box.;   Can you help; Out of work: "My husband has lost his job, and I'd
like to know how to explain it to our children," says Freida Cid of Miami,
Fla. "How do you talk about what this means for the family, and how much do
they need to know?"  </TEXT>
