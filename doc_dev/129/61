<LEADPARA>  Superintendent Al Aguayo would like to see a computer in every classroom in
Alum Rock Union Elementary School District.;    Getting the money, of course,
is a challenge. Winning teachers over is another. In this matter, Aguayo and
the district have decided on a soft sell.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Last week, Alum Rock opened a computer lab for its teachers at its district
headquarters. In the lab are 17 personal computers, each loaded with
educational software that can serve as a teacher's helper.;    The computers
in the lab can flash sexy graphics on the screen, play music, simulate the
building of a city, teach 5-year-olds to read and write, and re-enact the
westward journeys of the pioneers.;    The computers are just waiting to be
test-driven.;    The idea, district staff said, is to give teachers -- many of
whom view computers as mysterious, capricious objects -- an opportunity to
experiment and play.;    "Many of our teachers are technophobes," said Ted
Waldo, Alum Rock's director of data processing. "They are afraid they will
hurt something if they turn the computer on. This lab gives them a sheltered
place to learn.";    The computers and software in Alum Rock's new lab were
donated by IBM Corp. and Apple Computers Inc. at a cost of $200,000. Jim
Lynch, an IBM marketing representative, hopes teachers will see the equipment
as a way to provide individual attention in an era of large class-sizes and
diverse student needs.;    "Our educational system is geared to speak to the
middle of the class," Lynch said. "When you're dealing with 30 or 32 students,
you can't stay up with the really sharp kids and you can't hold everybody back
to teach the slow kids.";    But for Joanna Linden, a teacher at William
Rogers School, her motivation for visiting the lab was much simpler. She says
computers are the ticket to capturing the interest of the Nintendo
generation.;    "My kids always ask whether they can bring in their Nintendo
games," said Linden. "When I mention the word computer, they jump. I want to
channel that interest.";    In her classroom, she already has a computer that
runs word and knowledge games like Scrabble and Jeopardy. She parcels out time
on the computer as a reward for kids who finish their work. While the kids see
their computer activity as free time, she figures they're also learning
something without realizing it.;    The computer in Linden's classroom is the
exception rather than the rule in the district, said James Lovelace, a teacher
at Ocala School.;    "I don't have a thing in my classroom," Lovelace said.
"I'm fairly typical.";    Aguayo believes computers need to be more ubiquitous
than that.;    "We need them in every classroom."  </TEXT>
