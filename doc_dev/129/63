   Franklin Computer has emerged as a mega-winner in the fickle game of electronic gadgetry, but nagging questions are arising whether the astronomical growth can continue. 

   The company is setting the over-the-counter market on fire. 
Franklin shares were the third-best performer on the Nasdaq in 1987, rocketing from 2 1/8 to 10 3/4; the run has continued unabated this year, and the stock closed Friday at 19. 

   Franklin's growth was fueled by stunning sales of what it refers to as "a new form of software publishing" -- computerized dictionaries and thesauruses. 
In the fiscal year ended in March, some 450,000 consumers decided they just couldn't live without a small electronic product from Franklin that helps them spell, find the meaning of words, look up synonyms and cheat at Scrabble. 
And the company got them to pay as much as $300 apiece. 

   That's heady stuff for a company that has spent time in the bankruptcy courts. 
Franklin filed for Chapter 11 protection in 1984 after a prolonged legal battle with Apple Computer over a Franklin clone. 
It has since left the computer business, and now produces solely linguistic products. 

   But Franklin's success has started to spawn competitors -- including at least one high-powered Japanese electronics maker -- and the price/earnings multiple over 30 on trailing earnings is starting to look shaky to some. 
The company, in fact, alluded to that in its 1987 annual report. 
"It is expected . . . that if these products are successful, competition will emerge rapidly," the report says. 

   Here it comes. 
Seiko Instruments U.S.A., the U.S. unit of the Japanese consumer-electronics giant Hattori Seiko Inc., plans to unveil its versions of the electronic dictionary and thesaurus this summer. 
And the unit's president, Hiroshi Fukino, expects waves of other competitors to move into the market. 

   Several other companies also are planning to introduce spelling checkers and dictionary products this summer. 
SelecTronics Inc., a Minneapolis maker of electronic products, unveiled a $125 model at the beginning of the year that Walt Rapacz, the company's national sales manager, contends is selling at twice the rate the company had expected. 

   Aurora, a Taiwanese company, is expected to release its spelling checker at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago next month. 
Video Technology, a Northbrook, Ill., concern, is expected to introduce a similar product in the fall. 

   Franklin officials and investors argue that the company has some attributes that make head-to-head competition impossible. 
"The key is the data bases," asserts Paul Elliot, a portfolio manager at Cowen &amp; Co. in New York. 
"It will be very difficult for the Japanese to come in on an assault basis and knock them out of the box." 

   Franklin has exclusive rights to the Merriam-Webster dictionaries, one of only three or four data bases available for the software dictionary function, Mr. Elliot argues. 

   The company's chairman and chief executive officer, Morton E. David, stresses that the Franklin data bases work through phonetics so that users don't have to know how to spell the word properly to get a definition or synonym. 
"Our product has the information and the intelligence to bring the information back in an intelligent manner," Mr. David adds. 

   That may be an advantage, says Dick Drewry, a San Diego investor who is short the stock, but it isn't enough. 
"I don't think competition is going to destroy the company," argues Mr. Drewry, an independent broker. 
"I just don't think this is a $19 or $20 stock." 

   Seiko's Mr. Fukino contends that "the game plan is not to compete head to head," adding that he expects both Seiko and Franklin to sell two million products a year. 

   "A person may buy one from Franklin for the desk-size version and one from Seiko in a hand-size version," Mr. Fukino says, arguing that he believes Seiko has an advantage in the smaller version. 
Seiko created its data base from scratch, rather than buying an existing dictionary. 

   Franklin's Mr. David counters that his company will introduce pocket-size versions in July, and that retailers are loath to "switch from a winner" to an untested product such as Seiko's. 

   But Mr. Drewry, the San Diego broker, contends that Seiko and other lower-cost producers will eventually gain the advantage as buyers shy away from the highercost products. 
"I don't think the top end has a lot of market. 
I think the lower end is where the market is," he argues. 

   Taking that theory one step further, he says: "If people are looking at them in the store and they do essentially the same thing, I think they'll buy the cheaper one."
