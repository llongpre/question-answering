   Coleco Industries Inc., the
toy-making giant that is reorganizing under bankruptcy protection,
reported a $193.3 million second quarter loss on Thursday, due
largely to one-time restructuring costs.
   The loss compared with a profit of $752,000, or 4 cents per
share, in the year-earlier quarter.
   Second quarter sales plunged to $15.4 million from $146.1
million a year earlier.
   Company officials said the net loss included about $105 million
related to restructuring costs and expenses associated with current
plans to downsize the business.
   These costs reflect the company's decision to dispose of its
outdoor product lines and various operating facilities, company
officials said. Also included in the costs are the renegotiation of
certain product distribution and royalty agreements, company
officials said.
   Of the remaining $88 million of the loss, the company attributed
about half to virtual elimination of sales activity due to a lack
of funds to acquire and ship products, company officials said. The
rest of the loss came largely from the discontinuance of certain
products, company officials said.
   The closing date for the second quarter was extended to July 11,
when the company filed a Chapter 11 petition seeking protection
from creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws.
   In the six months ended July 11, Coeco lost $240.7 million,
compared with an $8.1 million loss in the year-earlier period.
Sales fell to $89.2 million from $270.5 million.
   The company has slashed its work force in an effort to cut
costs. It has fewer than 600 employees in the United States, down
from an average of 2,500 a year ago.
   The company produces Cabbage Patch Kids, Alf dolls, Big Wheels
palstic tricycles and board games, such as Scrabble. Industry
sources say the company controls about 5 percent of the nation's
toy market.
