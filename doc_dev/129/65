   Financially troubled Coleco
Industries Inc. says it plans to offer to make its debtholders
majority owners of the company if they agree to a restructuring of
the company's debt.
   The ailing West Hartford toy maker made the announcement
Wednesday as it extended a debt-exchange proposal a fourth time,
this time until June 30.
   Coleco has pinned its hopes for recovery on a plan to exchange
$335 million of debt for $119 million of new debt and 6 million
shares of common stock.
   But that offer, launched March 23, was rejected by debtholders
because it reduced the value of their investment in the company by
about 65 percent.
   Debtholders also complained that the plan did not require
similar sacrifices from Coleco stockholders, who would have seen
only a 34 percent reduction in the value of their investment if 6
million more shares of stock were issued.
   In a short statement, Coleco said it is preparing a revised
offer that would respond to the concerns of debt holders. Without
giving specifics, Coleco said the new plan would offer more bonds,
nearly as much as the $335 million of original securities that
would be replacing.
   In addition, Coleco said the new offer would include enough new
shares of common stock to give bondholders ``more than a majority
equity interest'' in the restructured company. With 17.8 million
shares of stock outstanding currently, that indicates that 18
million new shares of stock would have to be issued under the new
plan.
   Coleco officials have said the company might have to seek
protection from its creditors under federal bankruptcy laws unless
it can restructure the debt and raise working capital.
   Coleco's other products include ALF dolls, Big Wheels plastic
tricycles, and board games such as Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit.
   Industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the
nation's toy market.
