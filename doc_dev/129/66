   Coleco Industries Inc., the company
that rocketed to super-stardom with its Cabbage Patch Kids dolls,
may need another miracle to recover from its current financial
problems.
   Unless it can restructure its $335 million debt and raise
working capital, Coleco could soon wind up in bankruptcy court
seeking protection from its creditors, said Morton E. Handel, who
was named this week to replace Arnold C. Greenberg as chairman and
chief executive officer.
   ``I see myself under a very tight time deadline, measured in
days or weeks, in order to be able to resolve the problems
currently facing us,'' said Handel, 53, a 14-year Coleco veteran
and most recently the head of finances and investor relations.
   ``We're zealously trying to find some sources of working capital
in order to give us the opportunity to run the company and bring it
back to the point of profitability and viability,'' he said in an
interview.
   The company has proposed that investors who own its bonds
exchange those securities for 6 million shares of Coleco stock and
new bonds worth $119 million.
   The company is in default on the interest payments on its $335
million in debt and has set a deadline of May 13 for the exchange.
Coleco has also hired Cleveland-based Hallwood Group Inc. to help
it restructure its finances.
   ``Somebody obviously has a great sense of black humor since it's
Friday the 13th,'' David Leibowitz, senior vice president of
American Securities Corp. in New York, said Friday.
   In an effort to cut costs, Coleco this week laid off 475 workers
_ 45 percent of its total U.S. work force _ mostly at its three
manufacturing plants in the Albany, N.Y., area. That left it with
about 580 employees in the United States, compared with an average
of 2,500 in 1987.
   Coleco's other products include ALF dolls, Big Wheels plastic
tricycles and board games, such as Scrabble and Trivial Pursuit.
Industry sources say the company holds about 5 percent of the
nation's toy market.
   Leibowitz and other analysts said the same aggressive management
style that helped Coleco hit the jackpot with the gamble on Cabbage
Patch Kids dolls in 1983 helped bring on the current woes.
   The dolls, which were introduced in 1983 after a number of other
toy companies rejected the product, helped Coleco end 1985 in its
strongest financial condition ever, with sales of $776 million and
record earnings of $64 million.
   ``What went wrong? The company was just too aggressively run,''
said Paul Valentine, an analyst with Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. ``They
bet the ranch basically and lost. They waited until it was too late
to address their inflated costs and shore up their finances.''
   Valentine said he didn't blame Greenberg or any particular
product line, such as the toys based on the Rambo movie character
or the troubled Adam home computer. Rather, Coleco's woes stem from
a financial approach common in the toy industry, he said.
   ``They didn't cut their costs quickly enough after sales of the
Cabbage Patch dolls fell off sharply,'' he said. ``Like many toy
companies, Coleco had a cost structure which assumed only the
greatest success for the company's products.''
   The company, which became Coleco Industries in 1961, has faced
tough times before. It entered the snowmobile business in 1972, but
snowfalls were light for the next three years, the economy was
depressed and losses were heavy.
   The company posted a $22 million loss in 1978, threatening its
survival. In 1980 the Securities and Exchange Commission charged
Coleco with misstating its financial results to mask troubles.
   In 1982 the company began a move toward prosperity with the
introduction of its ColecoVision home video game system. The
company saw its future in electronics, and in 1983 unveiled its
$600 Adam home computer.
   Adam was a monumental flop, while sales of ColecoVision cooled.
The company lost $79.8 million in 1984 despite $540 million in
sales of Cabbage Patch Kids.
   Valentine said he doesn't believe Coleco will have to file under
Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, saying investors have
appeared more willing in recent weeks to consummate the exchange.
He also predicted Coleco may sell off a toy line to raise some cash.
   If it can weather the current storm, Leibowitz said Coleco has a
strong enough product line to remain an industry leader.
   ``This is a company that has a strong pedigree in the business
and one is not going to write them off as a meaningful player in
the trade,'' he said. ``What we are saying is the overwhelming
consideration and the major concern right now is simply the ability
to keep the doors open and work out an accommodation.''
