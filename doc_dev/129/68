   For the second consecutive year, the television
ratings leader in prime time is taking on a partner in a promotion
designed to drum up viewers for its new fall season.
   The National Broadcasting Co.'s NBC television network and
McDonald's Corp., the king of fast food, said Monday they would
team up on a game-like promotion this fall that they said would be
the most extensive ever for TV, reaching a potential 60 million
people daily.
   The companies declined to provide details of the effort, saying
they didn't want to give competitors a chance to copy it.
   NBC and CBS each had joint promotions with major retailers last
fall. The networks say they have had to become more aggressive in
getting people to look at their shows because of the growing
competition from independent stations, cable television and
programs and films on videocassettes.
   Last fall, NBC had a joint promotion with Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.,
the nation's largest retailer, that gave viewers a chance to win
trips to Hollywood to be on NBC programs plus other assorted prizes.
   CBS had a joint promotion with K mart Corp. last fall, and may
offer another promotion with the Michigan-based retailer this year,
according to CBS senior vice president George Schweitzer.
   Some advertising executies have questioned the value of such
promotions, but CBS and NBC executives say last year's efforts
boosted awareness of their programs and encouraged more people to
tune in at least once.
   ``Last year's promotion was highly successful for CBS and for K
mart,'' Schweitzer said. He said CBS's ratings for season premieres
last fall were up 28 percent from the previous year, when the start
of the season was delayed by a writer's strike, and 10 percent from
1987, when the season started on time.
   Schweitzer said the promotion also helped K mart post its
biggest sales gain of the year during the three-week period.
   Mary Jean Houde, a spokeswoman for Chicago-based Sears, said
Sears felt its promotion with NBC last year brought more customers
into the store even though sales in stores open at least a year
fell 1.8 percent last September compared with the previous year.
   She said the decline in so-called comparable store sales, the
indicator many analysts use to gauge how a retailer is doing,
reflected weakness in appliance and furniture sales rather than any
problem with the promotion.
   She declined to comment on Sears' plans for promotions this
year, but said, ``We don't often repeat a specific promotional
event.''
   NBC and McDonald's said their effort has the potential to reach
many more people every day than either the NBC-Sears or CBS-K mart
promotions did.
   With 209 affiliates, NBC said its schedule of shows can reach 42
million viewers nightly while McDonald's serves 17 million
customers a day at its 8,400 U.S. restaurants.
   John Miller, executive vice president for marketing at NBC-TV,
said last year's promotion with Sears ``did increase sampling
somewhat although not as much as we would have liked.''
   Nonetheless, he said, NBC gained valuable experience that it
hopes to use this year.
   He said about 3 million people entered last year's promotion and
that this year it was hoped ``considerably more, maybe a million a
day'' would enter.
   McDonald's has conducted a number of promotions itself in recent
years, including games based on the board games Monopoly and
Scrabble and giveaways linked to the movies ``The Little Mermaid''
and ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids.''
