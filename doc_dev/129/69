   Coleco Industries Inc., which has
enough funds to carry on business through next Thursday only, could
file for protection from its creditors next week, company chairman
Morton E. Handel said Friday.
   Handel would not confirm that his struggling company would
indeed file for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law, but he said in a telephone interview that if
anything is to happen, it would be next week.
   ``There really is nothing happening today,'' Handel said.
   Handel, recuperating at home from open-heart surgery, said 12
foreign and domestic lenders, whom Coleco owes $103 million, agreed
to provide money to the company through next Thursday.
   On Thursday, the West Hartford toy company gave up on its plan
to restructure its debts after having repeatedly extended a
deadline for a securities swap by its bondholders.
   Coleco has tried to restructure its finances since March, when
it proposed exchanging $335 million of bonds for a combination of
new bonds and stock. The company said the exchange would save it
millions of dollars a year in interest payments and supply cash for
the business.
   The original exchange terms were rejected by some of the
bondholders, who contended the swap would have reduced the value of
their investment without requiring similar sacrifices from Coleco's
stockholders and bankers.
   ``Unless they can pull a takeover of the company in the next few
days, this sounds like the end,'' said Sean McGowan, an analyst
with the investment firm Balis Zorn Gerard Inc. in New York.
   Handel said Coleco had not received any offers to buy the
company and was not approached by any prospective buyers. He said
other banks are willing to lend Coleco money if it can work out
arrangements with existing lenders.
   The company's current banks have provided short-term financing
to keep Coleco afloat since June 1. But the shortage of money
forced the company to virtually halt production.
   If it survives, Coleco will have few products for store shelves
at Christmas, the crucial season for toy manufacturers.
   The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids
and Scrabble board games.
   Coleco lost $47.4 million in the quarter that ended April 2. It
has lost money in four of the past five years, including $215
million the last two years.
