Hasbro, the largest US toy and games group, yesterday raised its bid for JW
Spear, the UK company which owns the rights to the Scrabble board game
outside North America.
The US group, which already owns the North American rights for Scrabble as
well as 26.7 per cent of Spear, increased its offer to Pounds 11 a share,
valuing Spear at Pounds 57.3m. It is also offering a loan note alternative.
The new terms are 100p above an offer from Mattel, the rival US toy company,
and 200p ahead of its original offer, made at the end of May.
Mr Norman Walker, a director of Hasbro UK, said the increased offer
represented 'significant enhanced value for shareholders' and reflected
Spear's past performance and future prospects.
Mr Paul Lipscombe, Spear's finance director, said the board would meet next
week 'to consider all aspects of the situation'. The latest offer closes on
August 5. Mattel, whose offer closes on Monday, said it had noted the new
bid and was considering its options.
Hasbro received no acceptances for its original offer, which was launched
after trustees of some Spear family trusts had given undertakings to sell
their 24.9 per cent stake unless a higher offer was received in three
working days.
The Spear board sought a white knight and found Mattel, which launched its
bid at five minutes to midnight on the last day.
Hasbro went to the High Court, claiming that Mattel's late offer had not
been properly announced; but the judge released the trustees from any
obligation to sell their shares to Hasbro.
The Spear board, which was not recommending either offer, has since allowed
Hasbro to take a more detailed look at the company and its forecasts.
The trustees have given no further undertakings to Hasbro. Hasbro argues
that its offer gives the trusts and families that own a large part of Spear
an opportunity to escape from the limited liquidity of the shares.
The last recorded trade in Spear shares was at 740p on May 12. Hasbro's
latest offer represents 20 times Spear's earnings last year.
