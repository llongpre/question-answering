INCONSISTENCIES are creeping into the Accounting Standards Board's new
requirements and their implementation, an academic warned yesterday.
Speaking at the launch of the latest annual survey of company accounts from
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Mr Len Skerratt
of the University of Manchester said 'cracks' were appearing in the new
regime.
'The Accounting Standards Board has done a really good job,' he said. 'But
it's a bit like a game of Scrabble. The first words are easy to fit in. The
real problem is getting the last ones to be compatible.'
From a sample of 300 companies, the survey shows wide variations in those
choosing to allocate items such as foreign currency differences, goodwill
and revaluations between extraordinary items, exceptional items and reserve
movements.
Mr Skerratt highlighted an inconsistency in the way the ASB requires
companies to pass goodwill through the profit and loss account, while
passing the effect of revaluations through reserves.
He said its decision to require companies to classify all convertible
capital instruments as debt rather than shareholders' funds until they were
converted was inconsistent with its statement of principles, which says the
substance of a transaction should take precedence over its legal form.
He also pointed to variations in the way companies and their auditors had
interpreted the ASB's urgent issues task force ruling on the treatment of
goodwill on disposal of acquisitions.
The survey highlighted the growing use of 'pro-forma accounts', which do not
need to be audited but are included in the accounts because of significant
events after the balance sheet was approved.
It also showed that just 4 per cent of the companies had qualified reports
from their auditors, down from 6 per cent last year.
The proportion of companies showing intangible assets, such as brands and
patents, on their balance sheets jumped considerably from 59 per cent to 67
per cent. That comes in advance of an ASB discussion document on
intangibles.
