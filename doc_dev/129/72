<HEAD>Coleco Shuts New York Plants Until July 11, Newspaper Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Struggling Coleco Industries Inc.
has closed its upstate New York production facilitied until July
11, a published report said.
   Security guards at the plants in Amsterdam and Mayfield, N.Y.,
near Albany, said workers were given Friday off as a paid holiday,
The Hartford Courant reported Saturday.
   The guards said the plants also would be closed this week, but
employees would not be paid for that time off.
   About 110 people work at the Coleco plants.
   The company's ability to make this week's payroll was questioned
after a New York court issued a restraining order Wednesday,
freezing Coleco bank accounts in Albany at the request of Coleco
suppliers who had not been paid.
   Officials from the International Leatherworkers Union, which
represents Coleco's production workers at the New York plants,
could not be reached for comment Friday.
   The company's West Hartford headquarters were closed for the
long holiday weekend, but a security guard said the offices would
reopen Tuesday.
   Company Chairman Morton E. Handel said Friday his company has
enough funds to carry it through another week. He said a group of
12 foreign and domestic lenders to which Coleco owes $103 million
agreed to provide money to the company through Thursday.
   Handel, recuperating at home from open-heart surgery, said no
steps had been taking toward a bankruptcy filing. If anything is to
happen, it would be this week, he said.
   On Thursday, the West Hartford toy company gave up on its plan
to restructure its debts after it had repeatedly extended a
deadline for agreement by debtholders.
   Coleco had proposed exchanging $335 million of bonds for a
combination of new bonds and stock. The company said the exchange
would save it millions of dollars a year in interest payments and
supply cash for the business.
   The original exchange terms were rejected by some of the
bondholders, who contended the exchange would have reduced the
value of their investment without requiring similar sacrifices from
Coleco's stockholders and bankers.
   The company produces such well-known toys as Cabbage Patch Kids
dolls and Scrabble board games.
   Coleco has been trying since January to cut costs and
restructure its finances. It lost $47.4 million in the quarter that
ended April 2. It has lost money in four of the past five years,
including $215 million in the last two years.
