   Coleco Industries Inc., squeezed by lower sales and higher debt, reported a fourth-quarter loss of $98.8 million and said it would miss an interest payment unless its debenture holders accept a financial-restructuring plan. 

   In the year-earlier period, Coleco reported a loss of $110.6 million. 
Coleco said the latest period's loss, bigger than most analysts expected, resulted from rising promotion costs and disappointing fourth-quarter sales of $69 million, compared with year-earlier sales of $73.7 million. 

   For the year, Coleco reported a net loss of $105.4 million, compared with a $111.2 million loss in 1986. 
It had sales of $504.5 million, compared with $500.7 million a year before. 
Coleco makes toys including Cabbage Patch and Alf dolls and Trivial Pursuit and Scrabble board games. 

   Coleco said that in the next several days it would propose to swap new Coleco equity for high-interest-rate debentures that have substantially boosted its interest costs. 

   "The company does not intend to make the subordinated-debenture interest payments and urges the debenture holders to accept the exchange offer," said Chief Executive Officer Arnold C. Greenberg in a letter to shareholders. 

   Terms of the equity-for-debt swap weren't disclosed. 
Coleco's total debentures outstanding have a face value of $335 million. 
Interest payments of $10 million are due on the debentures on April 1, with an additional $4 million payment due May 1. 

   A Coleco spokesman said all of the debentures would be included in the proposed swap. 
He said the debt had a current market value of about $80 million. 

   Coleco said it needed the swap to "return to a level of acceptable profitability." 
The company didn't break out operating results for the quarter or the year, but attributed 40% of its fourth-quarter loss to reserves and charges related to layoffs and other cost controls. 

   Coleco also said it was negotiating with a group of foreign banks to seek a renewal of a $150 million line of credit. 
Since no agreement on the credit line was yet in place, Coleco said its accounting firm intends to qualify the company's 1987 financial statements. 

   The spokesman said Coleco was attempting to roll over $135 million of the $150 million credit line. 
He said the credit line expires April 15. 
An additional $30 million line from domestic banks, coming due on May 1, is also under negotiation. 
The spokesman declined to name the lenders. 

   The negotiations were "progressing in a manner that will lead to a successful resolution," he said. 

   Coleco's troubles are indicative of the sagging fortunes of the U.S. toy industry, which has recently failed to come up with a new big-hit attraction like Cabbage Patch. 
In addition, analysts say, Coleco has been hurting since 1984 from big losses related to its Adam personal computer, which created a big stir in the electronics industry but was discontinued after disappointing sales. 

   The company has reported losses in three of the past four years. 

   "Coleco has been over-leveraged ever since Adam," said Laurie Lively, an analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., New York. 
"It's an extreme example of the boom and bust cycle in the toy industry." 
Ms. Lively had been looking for Coleco to report a $50 million loss. 

   Coleco reported its earnings after the market closed yesterday. 
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Coleco closed at $2.625 a share, down 25 cents.
