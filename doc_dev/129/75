  [Text] Zimbabwe's ruling party, ZANU-PF [Zimbabwe African 
National Union-Patriotic Front], has begun a nationwide 
restructuring exercise in the run-up to the election of 
provincial officials and the full national party congress later 
this year. But the exercise has uncovered divisions and 
personality clashes and rivalries within the party at the local 
level. One of the worst scrabbles has been in Masvingo 
Province, where rival government ministers and their followers 
have been involved in a good two months of mudslinging, but now 
the party top brass is stepping in to heal the rift, as Rachel 
Rawlings reports from Harare: 
  [Begin Rawlings recording] The vice president, Simon 
Muzenda, 
has called for an end to what he called this nonsense about 
factions and ordered the two sides to sit down and thrash out 
their differences. The bickering is between Minister of Mines 
Eddison Zvobgo and Provincial Governor Josiah Hungwe, supported 
by Minister of Higher Education Stanislaus Mudenge. They and 
their followers have been battling for control of ZANU in 
Masvingo since October, accusing each other of being political 
(?upstarts) bent on hijacking the party. 
  Mr. Muzenda's peace effort didn't appear to get off to a 
good 
start. At yesterday's meeting governor Hungwe's supporters 
turned up in force, but only managed to [words indistinct] 
faction. There are rumors in the Mashonaland West. A false rape 
charge brought against the local party candidate could have been 
politically motivated, while Manicaland Provincial congress had 
to be postponed because some delegates claimed local party 
elections had been rigged. In the eastern town of Mutare, the 
party restructuring exercise was postponed because of apathy 
amongst eligible delegates, and there have also been problems in 
Matabeleland. 
  Despite the widespread local bickering, the party's 
hierarchy 
has until recently made little comment. It appears Mr. Muzenda 
who comes from Masvingo, had intervened in a row there to 
prevent a coordinated attack from provincial level against the 
national hierarchy. There were reports of a secret meeting 
between one of the Masvingo factions and a local politician from 
Matabeleland, where they discussed lack of development in the 
two provinces, and the formation of a common front to push the 
government to provide more resources. Mr. Muzenda criticized 
such talk as very dangerous, saying what it really means is the 
government, which you are part of, has done nothing and, 
therefore, should be removed. It appears the party doesn't mind 
local scrabbles, but when dissents threaten those at the top, 
something has to be done. [end recording]
