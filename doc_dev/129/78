<TEXT>     If you said, "What are game shows?" you're correct.;   Next month, NBC will
bid farewell to "Wheel of Fortune" and "Classic Concentration," its last two
game shows. Earlier this summer, ABC cashed in its remaining game show, "The
Match Game." That leaves just two survivors for next season: "The Price Is
Right" and "Family Feud," both on CBS.;   "In the 35 years that I have been on
television, I have seen game shows behave just like the stock market," said
Bob Barker, longtime "Price Is Right" host. "Right now the market is down, way
down.";   Morning network schedules, once filled with buzzers, bells, whistles
and lights, are fast becoming the territory of talk shows, news and
information. "It's like a hurricane came and wiped them all away," said Mark
Goodson, whose company produces "The Price Is Right" and "Family Feud.";  
Looking for young audiences; "Part of this is the attitude networks have
toward game shows, and part of it is economics," said Bob Lloyd, senior vice
president of sales and marketing for Reg Grundy Productions, which produced
"Scrabble" and "Sale of the Century.";   "The attitude is that game shows skew
old, and networks are looking for younger audiences," he said. "The economics
is that networks can do reality shows in-house, with their own production
staffs and do them cheaper than they can buy game shows.";   The trend toward
reality programming does not, however, signal the end of game shows. They are
still popular in syndication, and new ones are being developed for cable-TV
audiences.;   In fact, the few game shows still on the air are among the most
successful programs on television. "The Price Is Right," the longest-running
game show in TV history after 19 years, is currently the No. 2 program on
daytime television, behind "The Young and the Restless." And the two top
syndicated shows for the 1990-91 season were "Jeopardy!" and "Wheel of
Fortune," both from Merv Griffin Productions.;   "I can't look at the success
of 'Price Is Right,' and the audience it continues to draw, and say the form
is dead," said Lucy Johnson, vice president of daytime programming for CBS.
"Program forms go in cycles, and they fall in fashion and out of fashion.";  
Personality-driven shows; In dropping their game shows, ABC and NBC claim they
are merely following the trend toward reality programming. ABC dropped "Match
Game" to extend the magazine-style "Home" show from 60 to 90 minutes. On NBC
fewer than 75 percent of the network's affiliate stations air "Fortune" and
"Concentration," choosing instead to broadcast syndicated talk shows.;   "You
have to look at what's working in the syndicated market," said John Miller,
NBC's executive vice president of daytime programming. "Those sort of
personality-driven shows that deal with reality or talk or information are
what seem to be working. And no one wants to create a glut of them, but they
do seem to be attracting the salable audience right now. So that's where we're
headed.";   To that end, NBC has hired "Entertainment Tonight's" John Tesh to
host a new morning interview show, "One on One," beginning Sept. 9. "The hope
is, over time, to find our own Donahue or Oprah, and have a franchise for some
time to come," Miller said.;   One area in which game shows have enjoyed
increasing popularity is on cable. MTV enjoyed success with "Remote Control"
and is planning two more game shows. The children's channel Nickelodeon pits
kids against parents in "Family Double Dare." USA Network runs an afternoon
block of game show reruns. And Lifetime, the cable channel for women, revived
"Supermarket Sweep" and developed a companion game show, "Shop Till You Drop."  </TEXT>
