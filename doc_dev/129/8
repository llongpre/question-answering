JW Spear

Hasbro, the biggest US toy and games group, yesterday did not rule out
raising its bid in the battle for JW Spear, the British company which owns
the rights to the Scrabble board game outside North America.
So far Hasbro, which owns Scrabble in the US and Canada, has received no
acceptances for its 900p a share bid, launched at the end of last month.
Yesterday it extended its offer, which values Spear at Pounds 46.9m, to July
11.
Mattel, the rival US toy group which made a last minute bid for Spear,
yesterday posted its offer document to Spear shareholders, offering Pounds
10 a share in cash or loan notes.
Mr Nigel Hutton of Hasbro UK said the group was still considering all its
options, and would be looking at both the Spear defence document and the
Mattel offer document closely.
The Spear defence document is expected later this week. The board is not
expected to find either offer fair and reasonable, although the higher
Mattel bid will be preferred.
Hasbro, which already owns more than 26 per cent of Spear, launched its bid
after trustees of some Spear family trusts had given undertakings to sell a
further 24.9 per cent unless a higher offer was received in three working
days.
The Mattel bid was launched at five minutes to midnight on the last day.
Last week a High Court judge released the trustees from any obligation to
sell their shares to Hasbro, who had claimed that Mattel's late offer had
not been properly announced.
