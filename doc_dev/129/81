   Will there be joy in toyland this year? 

   For the past couple of years, toy sales haven't been ringing up the cash register as often as toy makers would like. 
Last year's sales, at $12.5 billion, were the same as in 1986. 
Many high-priced, high-tech toys failed to sell well. 
Boys' action figures weren't very active. 
And the industry again lacked a megahit. 

   But 1988 is another year, and toy companies aren't giving up. 
They are displaying 5,000 new toys, in addition to the estimated 150,000 already on the market, to 17,000 buyers at the American International Toy Fair this week and next. 

   A visit to the fair gives a peek at what children may be nagging their parents to buy in coming months.

   Toy makers talk about going "back to basics." 
Translation: Nobody's counting on a megahit this year. 

   "We're not going out to try to hit home runs," says Stephen Hassenfeld, chairman and chief executive of Hasbro Inc., the nation's largest toy maker. 
"We're a singles and doubles team. 
If one goes out of the park, that's fine." 
Mattel, whose high-priced, talking doll Heather fared poorly last year, is introducing Little Miss Makeup, a $20 doll whose face "makeup" appears with the application of cold water and disappears with warm water. 

   From Coleco Industries Inc. comes Clay the Word; it's like charades, with clues sculpted instead of acted out. 
Tonka Corp.'s Kenner Products unit, in a variation on baseball cards, offers Starting Lineup, 3 3/4-inch-tall figures of real players along with statistic cards, for about $5 each. 
Hasbro's Milton Bradley unit reintroduces two board games from the 1960s, Crossfire and Hands Down, for about $12.

   Still, pricey toys aren't totally out. 

   Worlds of Wonder Inc. brings out a GT Super Screamers model race car for about $150 that can go 35 miles an hour on a special track. 
Tyco Toys Inc., for up to $125, offers radio-controlled cars that reach speeds of up to 25 miles an hour. 
In the fall, Mattel will introduce TV Play Along Wheel of Fortune, a $75 console game that will allow fans to "compete" against on-the-air players on the television program. 

   Parker Bros. this summer will introduce Starting Lineup Talking Baseball, a $100 electronic baseball game. 
It pits teams of All Stars against each other, with individual strengths and weaknesses taken into account to determine the outcome. 
Atari Corp. has a Flight Simulator game that mimics real flying conditions; the game works only on a new $149 Atari video-game player. 

   Still, Hasbro and Worlds of Wonder are delaying for at least a year the introduction of expensive new interactive television games, in part to work out any bugs in the technology.

   Who are the next Garbage Pail Kids? 

   Worlds of Wonder offers Germs, $5 plastic creatures that "cause" everyday ailments such as hiccups and burps; they're "grosser-looking" than real germs under a microscope, the company boasts. 
Lego Systems, demonstrating the versatility of its plastic building blocks, tells of a 13-year-old Danish boy who put together a two-foot-tall robot; the robot can eat, break up and eliminate bits of pasta. 
When it's full, its eyes turn green. 

   How about Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 4 1/2-inch action figures that are said to have been disfigured by radioactive slime, from Playmates for $4 to $5 each?

   Here's one for child philosophers. 

   Milton Bradley scored with Scruples, its adult board game that poses ethical questions. 
So it's introducing Scruples for Kids. 
An example: "You've just had a fight with your sister and you see a caterpillar crawling in her salad. 
Do you tell her?"

   As at any party, who's not here can be as interesting as who is here. 

   Rambo has been discharged from further duty. 
After disappointing sales, Coleco has discontinued the movie-based action figure. 
Jem, Hasbro's answer to Mattel's Barbie, has been given the pink slip, too. (Still, Hasbro launches a new assault on Barbie with another doll, Maxie, a highschooler whose claim to fame is waist-length beautiful hair.) 

   Lewis Galoob Toys Inc.'s talking Smarty Bear and Tonka's talking Barkers stuffed dog have been sent to the animal kingdom in the sky.
