THE TURNIP goes back in the pressure cooker next week. Graham Taylor, the
England manager and the Fleet Street tabloids' favourite vegetable, is this
weekend coaching his squad in the nuances of the long-ball game in
preparation for his date with destiny in Rotterdam on Wednesday.
Victory would, more or less, ensure a place in the World Cup finals in the
United States next year; defeat could mean the end of the world. A nation's
fans will be glued to their television sets as Taylor stews in Feyenoord's
stadium, the Tub.
Taylor and the England fans will not be alone. Only eight of the 24 places
in the finals are decided. The 500-game qualification process started 19
months ago in Santo Domingo where Puerto Rico beat the Dominican Republic
2-1.
Around 450 games have been played since - give or take a few annulled or
twice-played matches in Africa - but 33 teams are still competing for the
remaining 16 places. Algeria and Nigeria met in Algiers last night in
African Group A to decide whether Nigeria or Ivory Coast goes to the US. All
but three of the othersplay in the next 10 days.
Taylor has one advantage over his rival on Wednesday. Win or lose, Dick
Advocaat, the Dutch coach, will not take his team to the US. If the
Netherlands qualifies, Johann Cruyff will return from Barcelona to manage it
in the finals.
If England makes it, Taylor is safe in his job for five years. The 1996
European championships will be held in England, so his team is excused
qualifying.
Failure to reach the final stages has, traditionally, cost England managers
their jobs although failures in the finals have been forgiven. A win in
Rotterdam, though, and Taylor could watch his side lose every big game until
the end of the qualifying tournament for the 1998 World Cup before having to
find a new job.
A draw would leave matters balanced finely. England has a worse goal
difference than the Dutch. Both play their last matches on November 17,
England away to hapless San Marino and the Dutch in Poland. England would be
giving the Dutch a four-goal start, a handicap which favours England
slightly.
Taylor does not fancy a night of such calculations: 'When you start to think
that way, it will drive you crazy.' He said England would go for a win on
Wednesday.
This is a bluff. Taylor knows the Dutch must attack, and a counter-punching
strategy would suit him. He has not added a creative player to his squad to
replace Paul Gascoigne, who is suspended, and will select a defensive
midfield. England's main attacking strategy will be Taylor's preferred
long-ball game: a vague boot from defence towards the strikers.
Taylor must envy Egil Olsen, Norway's manager. His team leads England's
group and needs to win just one of its last two games to be sure of going to
the US. Switzerland, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland, France and Sweden
also need just one win in two to qualify. All are placed perfectly for an
attack of the jitters.
England and the Netherlands are not the only traditional soccer powers
struggling to qualify. Below Switzerland, Italy and Portugal scrabble for a
place. Behind the Irish, Denmark, the European champion, could qualify if
results go well on Wednesday but, otherwise, faces a showdown in Seville
against Spain. The US organisers will be praying France does not slip and
that Spain, Italy, England and the Netherlands right themselves.
But if the European groups have made the marketing people nervous, the start
of the South American qualifying tournament in July must have terrified
them. Brazil had been in wonderfully creative form in the Copa America and
the US '93 tournament earlier in the summer, but won neither. Then, it
opened its qualifying group with a draw in Ecuador and a loss in Bolivia.
But Brazil, cannily, had scheduled all its home games for the end; it won
the lot and went through.
The three other Latin American teams assured of a final place - Mexico,
Bolivia and Colombia - all are crowd-pleasers. Argentina, the pantomime
villain of world soccer, must win a two-leg play-off against Australia,
starting in Sydney on October 31.
In July, Argentina again showed its big-match resilience, grinding through
matches in the Copa America as it did on its way to the final of the 1990
World Cup. It beat Brazil and then Colombia on penalties; but, in the final,
Gabriel Batistuta scored two superb goals in a 2-1 win over Mexico to
suggest Argentina has added a scoring edge it lacked in Italy. It should be
too tough for the Australians.
Emotions will run high in Casablanca tomorrow where Morocco must beat Zambia
to qualify. Morocco, which lost out on hosting the 1998 World Cup, is the
only north African nation with a chance of reaching the finals and pride is
at stake. The Zambian team, meanwhile, has been patched up from youngsters
and returning European stars to replace the squad wiped out in an air crash
in April.
If they qualify, the indomitable Lions of Cameroon know they will be the
first African nation seeded in the finals. Cameroon needs only to avoid
defeat at home to Zimbabwe tomorrow, but the team has started wrangling over
cash. On the other hand, Zimbabwe must overcome a passionate home crowd in
Yaounde and the ground's reputation for strong witchcraft.
The organisers of Asia's final qualifying group, starting in in Qatar on
Friday, have implored the press to concentrate on soccer, not politics. The
six contenders include North and South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran.
The chief question is whether the J-League has made the sixth team, Japan, a
soccer power.
Franz Beckenbauer, the former German manager, said the champion will be
handicapped because it is excused the qualifying tournament which toughens
teams. The problem, as Taylor could point out, is that it can also eliminate
them.
