Now They Can Work on 'Nasdaq'

   It's easy for a little over-the-counter company with a forgettable name to get lost in the vast Nasdaq trading system. 

   But some small companies on the Nasdaq, home to more than three times as many companies as trade on the New York Stock Exchange, have found a solution: a trading symbol that nobody who learns it is apt to forget. 

   Thus, Occupational-Urgent Care Health Systems Inc. trades as OUCH; Roadrunner Enterprises Inc., a flat-bed trucking company, is BEEP, and Adtec Inc., which makes bars and detention equipment for prisons, is JAIL. (It seems that JAIL is in, these days, on Wall Street. 
The stock, which began trading at $9.875 Feb. 24, has risen to $11.625.) 

   Kevin E. Moyles, the research director at JAIL's underwriter, Underwood Neuhaus &amp; Co. in Houston, says Underwood urged the snappy symbol for Adtec "because the high visibility would help if it did well." 
He adds, however, "Of course, if a company weren't doing well, a memorable symbol would make it worse." 

   Most Nasdaq symbols have four letters, turning the exchange into a virtual Scrabble Game. 
There are such mnemonics as PAIN, CURE, CARE and HEAL for health companies; BUGS and PEST for biological- and pesticide-research concerns, and WORM for a farm-equipment company. 
Pioneer Communications Network Inc., which is developing books based on soap operas, chose SOAP. 

   Even words with a potentially negative connotation are used. 
For example, BANG might seem an impolitic choice for a power-plant owner, but it nonetheless was chosen as the symbol for Bangor Hydroelectric Co. 
And when Bangor America Inc., a fabric maker, went public last year, it selected BAMM. 

   "What you want is to make an immediate power of association related to what a company does," explained Mr. Moyles. 
Fertility and Genetics Research Inc. selected BABY; National Reference Publishing Inc. has ZIPP; and Cooper LaserSonics Inc., ZAPS. 

   Some symbols, however, become unintentionally prophetic. 
American Equine Products Inc., which picked WHOA for its symbol, has been reined in of late -- with its shares trading at about 62.5 cents each, down from $1.50 last August.
