<LEADPARA>  THE FIRST World Scrabble Championship will be next week in London, with
competitors from 20 countries vying for the $10,000 first prize. It should be
fun to hear or read the news reports about this championship because they are
certain to feature the most obscure, obsolete, and lengthy words played during
the final game.;   Most Scrabble players realize, however, that it is not the
very long words, but the very short words instead that are the keys to victory
in this game. There are 86 two-letter words, for example, that are considered
acceptable for Scrabble play, but many (such as "jo," "li," and "od") are just
as obscure as their sesquipedalian counterparts. (Let's see, that's 1 for the
"s," 2, 3, plus 10 for the "q," plus 1, plus 1, and 3 for the "p" . . . )  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     So, if this most-popular word game (27 percent of American homes have at
least one Scrabble set) hinges on words that aren't a common part of any
adult's speaking or writing vocabulary, can it possibly be a good teaching or
learning tool for parents to use with their children?;   THE answer is yes,
but not if it is played the way it is in championships or in most competitions
among adults. The game of Scrabble was designed to put a premium on knowledge
and skill during the course of play. There is a measure of luck involved (as
in the drawing of letters, for example), but Scrabble is a very scary game to
those who feel less than confident in their own vocabulary or spelling
ability.;   And so when children, even teen-age children, are asked to join a
Scrabble game with their parents, they are intimidated by the likelihood that
their comparative ignorance of words and spellings will be exposed during the
play, and they will not only lose, but be embarrassed at the same time.;   One
way to include people of varying abilities in a single game of Scrabble is to
give all players a pencil and note pad, so that they can write down various
words and letter combinations before having to display their selection on the
board. This levels the playing field somewhat by reducing the advantage of
those who can "see" various words in their mind without having to write them
out.;   You can also make a dictionary available for players to use during the
game -- not just for challenges. This practice not only encourages and builds
dictionary skills, but it also helps the entire family become more familiar
with the "family dictionary." (This is yet another reason not to select a
bigger-than-a-breadbox version for your home.);   A THIRD technique for
encouraging "family Scrabble" is to play in teams rather than as individuals.
The weakest and strongest players can be paired as a team (on opposite sides
of the table), and their scores combined. In this way, children can
concentrate on contributing some points, even just a few, at each turn, rather
than being solely responsible for their total score at the end of the game.;  
All three techniques can, of course, be employed at the same time, and other
adaptations are possible as well.;   There are many language benefits that can
come from playing Scrabble, including a knowledge of letter frequencies,
common word endings, and letter combinations. But there are even more benefits
that can come from "family Scrabble," if we will just tune ourselves to our
children's abilities and fears, and adapt this game, like all family games, in
ways that will make everyone eager to participate.  </TEXT>
