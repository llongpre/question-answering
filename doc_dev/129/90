   The annual American International Toy Fair that
opened Monday provides an opportunity for manufacturers to showcase
their latest creations and classics. Here are brief sketches of
some of the dolls, toys and games being introduced this year:
   _Dolls:
   My Pretty Ballerina is a battery-powered doll that dances. The
doll, from Tyco Toys, performs on her toes and executes moves on
one leg with the help of someone guiding her arm.
   New Kids on the Block dolls based on the five-member singing
group from Hasbro Inc. are expected to be a rage with teeny-boppers.
   _Plush Toys:
   Peeper Pals is a line of stuffed animals that also function as
night lights. When pressed on their bellies, the battery-powered
pals from Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. open their eyes, which light up.
   Zoo Tunes are high-tech hand puppets made by Worlds of Wonder
Inc. Three animals _ a lion, hippo and alligator _ sing children's
songs. The pupeteer controls the tempo by opening and closing the
puppet's mouth.
   Guard dogs from Nasta Industries are electronically activated
dogs that bark but look like soft, cuddly stuffed animals. They
have special pouches to stash valuables. If someone tries to unlock
the combination or pick up the dog, it barks.
   _Games:

   Gorbachev, named for the Soviet leader, is a family game in
which players must acquire Western-style consumer and luxury goods.
Special Gorbachev cards help players cut through red tape in their
buying binge as they advance around a board. The player with the
most goods at the end wins. It is made by the Milton Bradley
division of Hasbro Inc.
   Taboo is another family game from Milton Bradley. Players must
guess words via one-word clues from their teammates but five
obvious clues cannot be used. For instance, the clues ``space,''
``shuttle,'' ``moon,'' ``John Glenn'' or ``NASA'' can't be given
for the word ``astronaut.''
   Motor Mouth, from Tiger Electronics Inc., is a family game
co-designed by John Moschitta, known for his fast-talking
deliveries in radio and television commercials. The object of the
game is to successfully move around a board by correctly reading a
series of tongue twisters.
   Two samples: In Huron, a hewer, Hugh Hughs, hewed yews of
unusual hues; Classy Karla clumsily crammed clunky clams into
cluttered clothes closets clammering clearly and clicking castenets.
