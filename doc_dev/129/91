Creating a game that is fun to play is serious business for Brian Hersch. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an underlying presumption that since game playing is frivolous, then 
game making is frivolous," said Hersch, the creator of such adult board games 
as "Outburst" and "Taboo." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's frivolous at all. I damn well better (take it seriously) or 
I won't be successful. It's my business." 
</P>
<P>
This no-nonsense approach has made Hersch one of the rare winners in the 
competitive contest to create a hot-selling adult board game. Six years after 
Trivial Pursuit mania swept the nation and unleashed a flood of adult board 
games, the category is now stagnant, leaving board game makers hard at work to 
come up with the next hit that will end up on thousands of holiday gift lists 
year after year. Many industry players also see the current economic slump as a 
way of boosting sales. 
</P>
<P>
"There hasn't been anything hot and sexy for adults since Pictionary," said 
Larry Carlat, editor of Toy &amp; Hobby World, a New York-based trade magazine, 
referring to the 5 1/2-year-old game based on charades. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure the category is going great guns," said Carlat. "The stuff with 
board games is that there is only one really hot and sexy one that drives the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
Most entries in the adult board game category have not even come close to 
reaching the 100,000 sales mark, which qualifies them as successes and help 
ensure a spot on crowded store shelves. Even those who have created a hit game 
have trouble matching their success with a new and different item. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing," said game maker Robert Angel, who has not 
come up with a successful new game since creating Pictionary, which has sold 20 
million sets in various versions -- including Bible Pictionary. "We know we 
have gotten lucky." 
</P>
<P>
The adult board game category had long been a backwater of the toy industry, 
and was dominated by strategy games such as Othello and Risk. But 
question-and-answer games such as Trivial Pursuit -- which has sold more than 
40 million sets in its different versions -- were less intimidating and 
appealed to a broader group, with a minimum amount of strategy and a heavy 
reliance on common knowledge and popular culture. Shipments of adult board 
games totaled $158 million in 1989, according to the Toy Manufacturers of 
America. 
</P>
<P>
With strategic games, "you are into the game itself, into winning," said Chris 
Hixson, a veteran game player who was browsing through the Glendale outlet of 
the Game Keeper, which stocks more than 30 adult board games. "But with Trivial 
Pursuit and Pictionary, you are into having fun with people and enjoying 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
"The game becomes the vehicle for (social) interaction -- it's no longer the 
focal point," said Phil Orbanes, a toy and game industry consultant and former 
chief of research and development at Parker Bros. "These new games do not put 
too much of an emphasis on the feat of winning. It's more on the experience" of 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
Trivial Pursuit "was a very important step forward for the board game," said 
David Leibowitz, a toy industry analyst at American Securities in New York. 
But, "if we eliminate Trivial Pursuit from the discussion, you will discover 
that there has not been an overwhelming increase" in adult board game sales. 
</P>
<P>
The games also exploit the common experiences and knowledge of the nation's 
baby boom generation, which grew up with a plethora of toys. "They were the 
most coddled generation in history when it came to. . .play things," said 
Orbanes. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Hersch, the Century City-based real estate developer turned board game 
maker, says that television game shows have also played a role in addicting 
baby boomers such as himself to board games. 
</P>
<P>
"Playing games was just part of life," said Hersch, who grew up playing Risk 
and Clue and watching "To Tell The Truth" on television. 
</P>
<P>
Hersch's biggest hit -- Outburst, a free-association word game that has sold 3 
million copies -- weaves in all the traits that have made for successful board 
games. In Outburst, competing players, for example, are given a minute to come 
up with as many responses to such statements as "Commands You Give a Dog" 
listed on playing cards. 
</P>
<P>
"It takes in everybody's common knowledge," said Hersch. "This is not an 
intellectual experience, playing a game. We know this isn't brain surgery." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, games linked to technical or obscure subjects -- such as high finance 
in Trump the Game -- turn most players off. These games "were too heavily 
involved with what appeared to be high-level finance," said Orbanes. "That's 
too intimidating to most people." 
</P>
<P>
Rules are a crucial concern to board game designers since adult players of 
today have little patience. "I have to have you understand the game in three 
minutes," said Hersch. "I can kill the game if the rules are too complicated. 
It's critically important to keep a steady pace, an enlivened pace. If you have 
to keep going back to the rules, people say 'who needs this?' " 
</P>
<P>
Game boards and score-keeping devices, which are not essential to playing many 
of the games, help define the limits of the game and lend it a competitive 
zeal. "You don't have to have a board to play," said Hersch. "But a lot of 
people won't play unless its competitive." 
</P>
<P>
With skimpy advertising budgets, board game makers rely heavily on word of 
mouth to boost sales. "If you get the game to play well, then they you have the 
start of word-of-mouth," said Bob Reiss, a New Jersey-based businessman who 
created a trivia game based on TV Guide magazine and is now working on a 
project with a love-and-marriage theme. "If it doesn't play well, they don't 
come back. You get one chance." 
</P>
<P>
Despite a weakening economy, adult board games might appeal to a growing number 
of budget-conscious consumers, despite price tags of $30 and up. "Some people 
will have to give up their vacation or going to the theater," said Reiss. 
"People who are watching their money will want to play games" instead. 
</P>
<P>
Many game players would agree. Davern Kroncke, a Pictionary and Trivial Pursuit 
fan from Santa Rosa, Calif., says she invites friends to dinner at her house 
and then plays games after her children go to bed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a time for us to get together, to laugh, unwind and have a lot of fun," 
said Kroncke, a 39-year-old dental hygienist. And "it's economical," she said.
