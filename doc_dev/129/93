   The shenanigans of television evangelists
have spawned another player in America's multimillion-dollar board
game industry, this one irreverently named ``Fleece the Flock.''
   The game, developed by a writer, an inventor and an illustrator,
is based loosely on ``Monopoly,'' but instead of real-estate
tycoons, players assume the roles of greedy evangelists.
   ``I came up with the idea when Jimmy Swaggart was caught in the
motel,'' said Elizabeth Fuller, author of ``My Search for the Ghost
of Flight 401'' and other books. ``I thought, `These guys belong on
a board game.'''
   Equipped with collection plates, players toss the dice and pursue
ownership of theme parks, television stations and record companies
while trying to bankrupt their unholy competitors and keep their own
sexual escapades secret.
   Fuller collaborated on the game with inventor Stanley Mason,
whose 30 patents include Masonware microwave cookware, and Roy Doty,
a humorous illustrator.
   The three formed Tongue-in-Cheek Productions and sold the rights
to market the game to Regent Continental, a Philadelphia-based
company that produces board games for some of the nation's largest
toy makers.
   The company plans to have a pilot run of 10,000 games, selling at
$25 retail, available mostly in the Northeast by April 1, said Cindy
Levinson, an account executive for Regent.
   ``Fleece the Flock'' is only the latest board game to capitalize
on people in the news. Milton Bradley, maker of the some of the
country's most popular games, last month unveiled ``Trump _ The
Game,'' based on the wheeling and dealing of billionaire real estate
mogul Donald Trump.
   Analysts say any new entry into the $760 million-a-year
board-game industry faces an uphill battle.
   ``More than half the new toys introduced in any given year do not
make it past that year's Christmas,'' said David S. Leibowitz, a toy
industry analyst with American Securities Corp. in New York. ``The
success of any new toy item is pretty tough.''
   But Fuller and her collaborators say they are confident that
Americans' seemingly endless fascination with the foibles of
television evangelists will create a niche for their game.
   During five months of testing, the inventors were dumbfounded to
discover one common trait among test players: They all were cheating
by the end of the game. That prompted the inclusion of one rule
assumed in most games: ``Thou shalt not cheat (unless thou canst get
away with it).''
   No real-life evangelist is named and the inventors insist they
are not attacking religion itself. Fuller is a Unitarian; Doty and
Mason are both Methodists.
   ``It's a comment on humanity,'' Mason said. ``It's aimed at the
human foibles we have, when we'll support people like this when we
know ... they are evil.''
