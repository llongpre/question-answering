   ``Bimbo,'' a word much in vogue in the
scandal-ridden '80s, was first used as a relatively sexless term
for lackluster males of the Roaring Twenties. The slightly stuffy
word ``academy'' has a much racier past _ a daring exploit
involving a youthful Helen of Troy.
   From ``bunk,'' the unfortunate legacy of a longwinded
congressman, to ``zany,'' derived from the word for a 16th-century
Italian clown, a new book by dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster
Inc. examines the strange stories and forgotten figures lurking
behind everyday words.
   ``This book was a little bit more fun to work on than the usual
things we do here,'' said Frederick C. Mish, editorial director of
Merriam-Webster.
   ``Webster's Word Histories,'' touted as a companion for
``armchair etymologists,'' is a departure from the dictionary
publisher's generally sedate product, filled with lively prose and
complete with an eyecatching ``bikini'' entry on the jacket.
   ``That was probably picked because it would be of some
interest,'' Mish said dryly, hastily pointing out the selection was
an advertising _ not editorial _ decision.
   Scholarly tomes about the origins of words already exist, most
notably the Oxford English Dictionary, which exhaustively defines
hundreds of thousands of words and gives their sources.
   But Word Histories, published in September and priced at $14.95,
is aimed more at the kinds of people who contact Merriam-Webster
regularly, asking where words or phrases come from, Mish said.
   ``I make no bones about that, this is intended to be a popular
book,'' he said. ``We have not targeted linguists or historians or
any particular group of people of advanced educations or highly
specialized interests.''
   Audrey Duckert, a lexicographer at the University of
Massachusetts who has contributed to Merriam-Webster dictionaries
and to the last supplement of the Oxford English Dictionary, said
there are surprising numbers of non-scholars who are interested in
word origins.
   ``One of my jobs (at Merriam-Webster) was to answer all the
`Dear Mr. Webster' letters. I settled more Scrabble arguments than
you can shake a stick at,'' she said.
   ``Sometimes they're intimidated by scholarly things. Scholars
are very often put off by cutesy things. If this goes that middle
line between being cute and scholarly, I think it would be a good
thing,'' she said.
   Some of the derivations described are classical, such as
``academy,'' which stems from the abduction of the 12-year-old
Helen of Troy. A man named Akademos showed her brothers, Castor and
Pollux, where she was hidden. Athens later named a park and
gymnasium after him _ Akademeia. There, the philosopher Plato set
up his school, the prototype prep.
   Others put their stamp on less erudite words. ``Bunk,'' or
nonsense, is the unfortunate legacy of a long-winded early
19th-century congressman, Felix Walker, who represented the
district in which Buncombe County, N.C., is located.
   ``Bimbo,'' now used to describe attractive but foolish females,
is found as early as 1919 to describe ``a fellow who was
unimportant or undistinguished,'' according to Word Histories. The
word is believed to have derived from an Italian term for baby. Use
of the word to describe a sexually promiscuous woman did not catch
on until the advent of 1930s detective novels peopled by beautiful
but dumb blondes.
   ``Zany'' is believed to derive from an Italian dialect name for
a stock comedy character, Zanni, in improvised comedies of the 16th
century. The word first appeared in English in Shakespeare's
``Love's Labour Lost,'' with a reference to ``some slight Zanie.''
   Some words refuse to be neatly explained, and editors note in
the introduction to the book that etymology is not an exact science.
   For example, the entry for ``bikini,'' describes 1946 atomic
bomb tests on the atoll of Bikini in the Marshall Islands. ``In the
summer of 1947, another bombshell hit the beaches of the French
Riviera, the bikini,'' the entry continues.
   Editors confess they do not know how one led to the other,
although they offer the theories that the effect of a bikini-clad
woman compares to an atomic blast, or the ground-stripping effect
of an atomic blast compares to a bikini. A third theory, that the
shape of the atoll looks like a bikinied figure, is dismissed as
unlikely even to the ``most perfervid imagination.''
   By the way, ``perfervid,'' means extremely or excessively
fervent.
