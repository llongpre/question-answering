<TEXT>     1. In the average American home, students pass time reading, pounding on
siblings and watching television at a ratio of 5:10:50. If 1 hour is spent
smacking each other around, how much time is left for television?;   (A) Only
2 hours.;   (B) Only 3 hours.;   (C) Only 4 hours.;   (D) Only 5 hours.;   2.
Across America, 10,000 school districts have signed up for Channel One news, a
10-minute cable tutor that uses televisions as teachers and includes
advertising for candy bars. In return, the schools receive free electronic
equipment.;   Please choose the word grouping that expresses a relationship
similar to the one between: TV executives, educators, students.;   (A) Rich,
grateful, lucky.;   (B) Bookies, bag men, pawns.;   (C) Pimps, whores,
witnesses.;   (D) Surgeons, anesthesiologists, lobotomy patients.;   3.
Nationwide SAT averages have dropped to a 20-year low, with verbal skills
taking the biggest slide and landing, for the first time, below the national
average for three games of bowling. Coincidentally, roughly 2 percent of all
Americans got this news from newspapers (x), 5 percent from radio (y) and 93
percent from television (z), meaning the chance for improved scores next year
is:;   (A) y minus x times z.;   (B) 2x divided by yz cubed.;   (C) x minus pi
r squared.;   (D) Ahhhh, forget it.;   4. In the Reagan era of smiling and
waving, spending on education, health care and nutrition fell 21 percent
(counting inflation), and the nation's schools became an international
embarrassment, not that anyone turned red or, more importantly, gave a damn.
George Bush, however, as Education President, has taken a leadership role. He
has urged states to do something about it.;   Choose the words that best
express a relationship similar to the one in this lovely trio: Reagan,
education, Bush.;   (A) Iceberg, Titanic, squid.;   (B) Gasoline, fire, squirt
gun.;   (C) Tarot, Scrabble, Ouija.;   (D) Wonder Bread, Velveeta, Wonder
Bread.;   BONUS QUESTION:;   5. Choose the tandem of words that expresses a
relationship similar to this sample tandem: Donald -- Ivana.;   (A) Donald --
Marla.;   (B) Iron Mike -- Robin.;   (C) Keifer -- Julia.;   (D) Madonna.;  
6. Chief of Staff John Sununu leaves Washington in a limousine headed to a
stamp show in New York. Vice President Dan Quayle flies on Air Force One to a
golf tournament in California. President Bush ends a vacation in Washington by
boarding a helicopter to Kennebunkport, where he will manage another world
crisis in casual slacks.;   Sununu travels 180 miles at 60 mph, but stops in
the Poconos for three hours of skiing. Quayle goes 3,000 miles at 600 mph, but
finds out the country club bans blacks, so he drives two hours to one that
bans only women. Bush covers 1,000 miles at 200 mph aboard Chopper One.;   Who
arrives first?;   (A) Sununu, but he forgets why he went.;   (B) Quayle, but
he forgets his golf clubs.;   (C) Bush, but he forgets Barbara.;   (D) Who
cares, it was fun just writing out the question.;   7. Unfortunately, the
United States government can't be given full blame for the fact that the
country has smart bombs and dumb students. How about the kids themselves? Some
of them have the motivation of slugs. And evidence suggests that many of
tomorrow's leaders perform pathetically because their parents are,
scientifically speaking, major-league boobs themselves. In fact, in 90 percent
of homes surveyed, Mom and Dad's idea of getting involved in Junior's
education consisted of helping him solve the puzzle on "Wheel of Fortune.";  
The moral of this tale is probably:;   (A) Genetics are tough to work around.;
  (B) God works in mysterious ways.;   (C) Generally speaking, people should
buy more newspapers, because we're dying in this business, Do You Hear Me,
We're Dying in Here! while you're watching "Evening Magazine" and "Hard Copy"
and the country's going to the dogs.;   (D) From couch potatoes you get tater
tots.;   ANSWERS:;   1. (D); 2. (B, C or D); 3. (D); 4. (D); 5. (B); 6. (D);
7. (D).  </TEXT>
