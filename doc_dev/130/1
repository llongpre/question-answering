   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said that its proposed merger with three affiliates and a large Royex holder would be implemented through an exchange of shares and that the new company will be called Corona Corp. 

   Royex has proposed to merge with affiliates International Corona Resources Ltd., Lacana Mining Corp., Mascot Gold Mines Ltd. and Royex's second-largest holder, Galveston Resources Ltd. 
If approved at planned shareholder meetings in June, the resulting company would be one of North America's largest and lowest-cost gold producers. 

   Under terms of the proposed merger, Royex said Corona Corp.'s share capital would consist mainly of Class A shares, with one vote each, and Class B shares, with 100 votes each. 
Royex Chairman Ned Goodman said certain Royex executives and directors would receive Class B shares with a combined voting stake of more than 50% in Corona Corp. 

   Royex said the merger plan, approved by the directors of each company Tuesday, provides that Royex holders would receive 0.61 Class A share of Corona Corp. for each Royex common share; International Corona holders would receive one Corona Corp. Class A share for each of their common shares; Lacana holders would receive 1.32 Class A shares of the new company for each Lacana share; and Mascot holders would receive 1.11 Class A shares for each Mascot share. 

   Galveston holders would receive 0.43 Class A share for each Galveston Class A share, and 0.43 Class B share in the new company for each Galveston Class B share. 

   The shares of the five companies are expected to resume trading today on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
They were halted prior to the opening Wednesday. 

   Royex closed Tuesday at 6.125 Canadian dollars ($4.94), Corona closed at 9.75 dollars, Lacana at 13.125 dollars, Mascot at 11.25 dollars, and Galveston's Class A and B shares each closed at 4.60 dollars. 
The share values give the concerns a combined indicated market capitalization of about 2.52 billion dollars ($2.03 billion). 

   The merger plan also specifies that all intercompany holdings between Royex, its affiliates and Galveston be canceled. 
Royex currently holds a 49% stake in Corona and 45% of Lacana, which in turn owns 50% of Mascot. 
Corona and Galveston are Royex's largest holders, with interests of about 41% and 21%, respectively. 
All companies are based in Toronto but Galveston, based in Vancouver. 

   Royex's Mr. Goodman will be chairman of the new concern, and Peter Steen, Royex president and chief executive officer, would retain his posts. 
Corona Corp. is expected to have 1988 gold output of about 465,000 ounces, annual cash flow of about 200 million dollars, and interests in industrial minerals and oil and gas as well as gold. 
Four new gold mines are expected to be added by the end of 1989 to the five concerns' present eight mines. 

   Royex, International Corona, and Galveston would also issue warrants to purchase new Corona Corp. shares, and Royex said holders of its preferred shares and all warrants, options and convertible securities of the merging companies would be issued securities of Corona Corp. at the proposed merger ratios.
