   A unit of Western Mining Corp. Holdings Ltd., said it plans a cash offer of 92 million Canadian dollars ($70.4 million) for all of Seabright Resources Inc. Class A shares and warrants. 

   Western Mining said it will offer 8.50 Canadian dollars ($6.50) for each of Seabright's 10.4 million Class A shares and 3 dollars for each of its warrants. 
The Class A shares and warrants represent practically all of Seabright's issued equity. 
The purchase would be made through WMC Acquisition (Canada) Corp., a Toronto-based unit of Western Mining, Australia's biggest gold producer. 

   A spokesman for Western Mining said the company expects to make the offer next week. 
Terence Coughlan, president and chief executive officer of Seabright, a small gold producer based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, declined comment on the proposed bid. 

   Western Mining said it currently holds about 6% of Seabright's outstanding Class A shares. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Seabright closed at 8 dollars a share, up 2.125 dollars.
