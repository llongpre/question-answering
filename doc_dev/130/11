   A gold mine developed by LAC Minerals Ltd. that is expected to become Canada's biggest producer belongs to International Corona Resources Ltd., an Ontario Court of Appeal ruled. 

   In a long-awaited decision, a panel of four judges unanimously upheld a 1986 ruling by the Supreme Court of Ontario and dismissed LAC's appeal to overturn it. 
LAC declined to say whether it would seek a further appeal. 

   Peter Steen, International Corona's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said "Naturally, we're delighted. 
We feel that justice has been done." 
As a result of the added production from the disputed mine, International Corona expects to more than double its gold output this year and Royex Gold Mining Corp., which holds a 49% interest in International Corona, expects its gold output to increase about 40%. 

   Mr. Steen said he will soon meet with Vancouver-based Teck Corp. to discuss their plans to jointly operate the mine and one next to it at Ontario's Hemlo gold district. 
Together, the two mines are expected to produce about 700,000 ounces of gold annually by 1990. 

   David Thompson, Teck's vice president, finance, said Teck is "very pleased." 
Teck acquired half of Page-Williams in 1986 and its share of the mine output is expected to double Teck's gold production this year. 

   LAC must hand over the mine once International Corona pays it 154 million Canadian dollars ($117.8 million) to help cover the mine's development costs, unless LAC can obtain a court order deferring the transfer. 
An International Corona lawyer said he expected International Corona to pay LAC the funds this week. 

   In return, LAC must pay International Corona an amount equal to the mine's earnings since it opened in January 1986. 
The mine, which was expected to provide about 40% of LAC's gold production in 1987, earned about 24.3 million dollars during the 18 months ended June 30. 

   In their 126-page ruling, delayed because of the death in June of one of their members, the appeal court judges said they found "ample evidence" to support the conclusions of Ontario Supreme Court Justice R.E. Holland, who heard the original court trial. 

   The appeal court upheld the conclusions of Justice Holland. 
It cited LAC for breaching a trust with International Corona when the two talked about a joint venture in 1981. 
The panel agreed LAC used confidential information given to it by International Corona, then a tiny exploration company, to acquire the property where the PageWilliams mine now operates. 

   Analysts say they expect the ruling to have a positive effect on International Corona, Royex and Teck share prices. 

   Paul Esquivel, an analyst with Davidson Partners Ltd., Toronto, said he believes Corona's shares are valued at about 60 dollars if one includes the Page-Williams mine. 

   In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, International Corona closed at 47.50 dollars, up 25 cents. 
Royex shares closed at 5.50 dollars, up 12.5 cents; Teck closed at 33.75 dollars, down 25 cents. 

   Amy Gassman, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New York, said she expects a "moderately negative" short-term impact on LAC's share price. 
In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, LAC closed at 18 dollars, up 12.5 cents.
