   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said it is offering a package of securities and cash with an indicated value of about $234.4 million (Canadian) under its previously reported plan to raise its stake in International Corona Resources Ltd., a gold mining affiliate based here. 

   Under the offer, mailed yesterday to shareholders of International Corona, Royex said it is offering to purchase four million International Corona common shares for $4 each in cash and $47.50 of new Royex preference shares and warrants. 
Royex currently holds about 8.2 million, or 38% of International Corona's 21.6 million issued common shares. 

   Royex said it is also offering one Royex preference share and one Royex warrant, with a combined indicated value of $42.50, for each of 711,053 International Corona warrants that expire Aug. 31. 

   Royex said the offer, if successful, would effectively raise its interest in International Corona to 58% from 38% on an undiluted basis, or to 44% from 24% on a fully diluted basis. 
Royex said its voting interest in International Corona would be raised to 50%. 

   Under the offer, which is scheduled to expire April 22, Royex said its two new series of Royex preference shares will initially be convertible into 3.33 Royex common shares, subject to a one-time adjustment to reflect the outcome of litigation between International Corona and Lac Minerals Ltd. 
The adjustment will be made after the litigation is resolved, or not later than April 30, 1990, Royex said. 

   The litigation relates to a dispute between International Corona and Lac over a large northern Ontario gold mine. 

   Royex said its offer for International Corona common shares isn't conditional on any minimum acceptance level, but if fewer than 2.7 million International Corona common are deposited, International Corona's share and warrant holders will be entitled to withdraw from the offer within two days after its expiration. 
If more than four million International Corona shares are tendered, Royex said it will pay for the shares on a pro-rata basis. 

   Trading in International Corona and Royex shares was halted yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
In trading Monday, Corona closed at $43.125, up 62.5 cents, and Royex common closed at $6.125, down 25 cents.
