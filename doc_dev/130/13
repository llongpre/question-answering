   International Corona Resources Ltd. said its board decided to make no recommendation to holders concerning Royex Gold Mining Corp.'s offer for Corona shares and warrants because a pending court ruling could affect Corona's share price. 

   Corona said its financial adviser, Dean Witter Reynolds (Canada) Inc., determined that the Royex offer had a market value of $52.625 per Corona share, and $40.875 per Corona warrant, based on market prices before the March 31 offer was made. 
But it said Dean Witter also determined that a ruling in Corona's dispute with LAC Minerals Ltd. over ownership of a gold mine could drive the price of Corona's common to as low as $25 or as high as $92. 

   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Corona, a mining and exploration company, closed at $54.50, up $2.50; Royex closed at $7.75, up 50 cents. 

   Royex -- which is Corona's largest shareholder, controlling about 40% -- made the offer to strengthen its hand against Murray Pezim, a dissident Corona director who has filed suit seeking to replace five of Corona's 10 directors. 

   In a dissenting opinion, Mr. Pezim rejected the Royex offer. 

   Both Royex and Corona are based in Toronto.
