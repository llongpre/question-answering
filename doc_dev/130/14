   The Supreme Court of Canada agreed to let LAC Minerals Ltd. appeal a decision that would have forced it to hand over a big Ontario gold mine to International Corona Resources Ltd. 

   The court didn't offer its reasons for the decision. 
A LAC spokesman said the appeal might not be heard until 1989. 

   Corona's president and chief executive officer, Peter Steen, said he was "disappointed" by the ruling. 
It followed a decision in October by an Ontario Court of Appeal to award the Page-Williams mine, in Ontario's Hemlo district, to Corona, upholding a 1986 court ruling. 
The appeals court agreed that LAC used confidential information given to it by Corona to acquire the property where the Page-Williams mine now operates. 

   Corona said it plans a cross-appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada regarding the company's claim that it shouldn't have to pay LAC 154 million Canadian dollars ($117.8 million) to help compensate it for developing the Page-Williams property. 

   The outcome of the legal battle will significantly affect both Toronto-based companies and their affiliates. 
Page-Williams is expected to become Canada's biggest gold mine. 
It would have accounted for more than half of Corona's gold output and about 40% of LAC's gold output this year. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, LAC closed at 14 Canadian dollars ($10.71), up 87.5 cents, and Corona closed at 49.875 dollars, down 12.5 dollars. 
Royex Gold Mining Corp., which holds a 49% stake in Corona, closed at 6.50 dollars, down 1.375 dollars. 

   Vancouver-based Teck Corp. had agreed with Corona to jointly operate the Page-Williams mine and one next to it. 
Teck's Class B shares closed at 35.25 dollars, down 5.75 dollars.
