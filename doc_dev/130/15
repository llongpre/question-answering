   Corona Corp. said it agreed to sell its oil and gas assets to a unit of Calgary, Alberta-based Poco Petroleums Ltd. for Poco stock with an indicated market value of 72.6 million Canadian dollars (US$59.9 million). 

   The planned sale to Poco's 89%-owned Central Explorers Inc. unit would result in Corona becoming Poco's largest holder, with a 25.4% fully diluted stake. 

   Poco is a fast-growing oil and gas producer. 
Toronto-based Corona, formed last week through the merger of five affiliated mining concerns, is among North America's top five gold producers. 

   Under the proposed transaction's terms, the companies said Central will acquire Corona's Lacana Petroleum unit's oil and gas assets, which are mainly in Canada. 
They include about 6.4 million barrels of oil reserves, 56.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, 78,000 acres of undeveloped land and related working capital of more than C$20 million. 

   Central will incur a debt to Poco for the assets and Poco will issue to Corona five million new common shares and two million new preferred shares that would be convertible to an equal number of Poco common shares. 

   In Toronto Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Poco's common shares closed at $10.375, up 37.5 cents. 
The company currently has about 20.5 million common shares outstanding. 

   Corona, which will have three nominees on Poco's board, said it currently doesn't plan to raise its stake in Poco. 
A Corona official said the Poco investment would assign a market value to Corona's oil and gas assets, which the company believed weren't recognized previously by investors. 

   The transaction is expected to close this summer, subject to regulatory approvals.
