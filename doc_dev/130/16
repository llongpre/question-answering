   A Royex Gold Mining Corp. management group intends to strengthen its long-term control of Corona Corp., a proposed new gold mining company, by restricting the sale of members' multiple-voting shares in the new concern. 

   Peter Steen, president and chief executive officer of Toronto-based Royex, said management group members would be required under a planned agreement to offer to one another any Corona Class B multiple-voting shares they intend to sell. 
If the shares aren't sold, they would be converted to Royex Class A shares and sold on the open market, he said. 

   Shareholders of Royex and four other mining companies are scheduled to vote tomorrow on a proposed merger that would result in the creation of Corona. 
If approved, the company would rank among North America's biggest gold producers. 

   Under the planned merger's terms, Royex's management group would emerge with a 55.6% voting stake and 8% equity interest in Corona. 
Royex said Corona would have outstanding about 116.3 million Class A shares, with one vote each, and 8.7 million Class B shares, with 100 votes each.
