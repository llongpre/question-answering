   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said it plans to begin gold production at its 30%-owned Jolu property in Saskatchewan before year end. 

   Royex projected annual gold output at Jolu of about 50,000 ounces, beginning in 1989. 
The property is 70%-owned by Vancouver-based Mahogany Minerals Resources Inc., a gold exploration concern. 

   Royex said it expects to spend about 20 million Canadian dollars ($16.2 million) to complete construction of a mine and mill at the site. 
Financing will be arranged through a gold loan, the company said. 

   Royex said the mine would be operated by Corona Corp., pending the result of Royex's merger with four other Canadian gold mining concerns. 
Corona is the name of the company that would result from the planned merger, which Royex said it expects to complete early in July.
