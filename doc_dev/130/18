   ROYEX GOLD MINING CORP., Toronto, lifted its interest in International Corona Resources Ltd. to 50% from 38% under an offer. 
Royex also settled its differences with a dissident Corona holder, Murray Pezim. 
Mr. Pezim agreed to drop a legal action that sought to replace five of Corona's 10 directors, and he agreed to place the Corona shares he owns or controls in a voting trust that Royex controls. 
Royex received right of first refusal to buy Mr. Pezim's Corona shares or securities convertible into Corona shares. 
Mr. Pezim, who remains a Corona director, confirmed the details of the agreement.
