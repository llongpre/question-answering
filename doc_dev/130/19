   Peter Steen, president and chief executive officer of Corona Corp., said the company remains "receptive to examining an out-of-court settlement" with LAC Minerals Ltd. regarding the disputed Williams mine at Hemlo, Ontario. 

   Still, the sides haven't discussed the issue since a meeting earlier this year, he said. 

   "That's the only meeting that I have had, and that's the only meeting that Corona has had" with LAC, Mr. Steen said in an interview. 
Asked if Corona is willing to reopen talks, he said: "I think we're waiting for {LAC's president and chief executive, Peter Allen} to make his move." 

   A LAC spokesman said "nothing substantial was discussed" at the spring meeting, and that LAC doesn't plan to resume talks. 

   International Corona Resources Ltd., one of five affiliated companies that agreed earlier this month to merge to form Corona Corp., was awarded ownership of the Williams mine in 1986 by the Supreme Court of Ontario. 
The decision was upheld on appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada will hear a final appeal Oct. 11. 

   Mr. Steen said Corona, whose merger takes effect Friday, doesn't believe its case will be affected by other litigation in progress involving the Hemlo claims. 

   Neither Mr. Steen nor Corona Vice President and Treasurer Tony Walsh would offer specific earnings or revenue projections. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Walsh described as "reasonable" an analyst's forecast that Corona will earn about 77 million Canadian dollars (US$63.8 million), or 53 cents a share, on revenue of C$264 million for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30, and C$111 million, or 75 cents a share, on revenue of C$376 million for fiscal 1989. 

   The forecast is based on gold output of 466,000 ounces this year and 630,000 ounces for fiscal 1989 and an average gold price of $450 an ounce. 
Corona previously forecast output of 465,000 ounces for 1988 and 650,000 ounces for 1989 at an average cash production cost of $170 an ounce. 

   Igor Levental, Corona's newly appointed director, acquisitions and evaluations, said Corona "could take on a C$400-$500 million company" with its current financial resources. 
Mr. Steen said the company is considering an offer for Toronto-based Franco-Nevada Mining Corp., in which Corona holds a 15% stake. 
"It's on the market, and we are taking a look at it," he said.
