   Royex Gold Mining Corp., three of its affiliates and Royex's second-largest holder proposed a merger that would create one of North America's biggest gold producers. 

   Peter Steen, Royex's president and chief executive officer, said directors of Royex, International Corona Resources Ltd., Lacana Mining Corp., Mascot Gold Mines Ltd. and Galveston Resources Ltd. were to vote yesterday on the proposed merger. 
He said he expected the boards to approve the plan. 

   Mr. Steen wouldn't disclose terms of the proposed merger or the name of the company that would result from it. 
He said further details would be provided today. 

   Royex holds a 49% stake in Corona and a 44% interest in Lacana, which in turn owns 50% of Mascot. 
Corona and Galveston are Royex's largest holders, with interests of about 41% and 14%, respectively. 
All the companies are based in Toronto except Galveston, which is based in Vancouver. 

   Mr. Steen said the merger would simplify Royex's complex corporate structure and result in the formation of a "significant" gold mining concern. 
He said the proposed company would have gold output of 450,000 ounces in 1988 and 650,000 ounces in 1989, at an average cash operating cost of $170 an ounce. 
This would make the company the fifth-largest North American producer and one of the continent's lowest-cost gold mining concerns, according to Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., New York. 

   Trading in the companies' shares was halted prior to the opening yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

   Royex closed Tuesday at 6.125 Canadian dollars ($4.93), up 12.5 cents. 
Corona closed at 9.75 dollars, down 37.5 cents; Lacana at 13.125 dollars, down 25 cents, and Mascot at 11.25 dollars, unchanged. 
Galveston's Class A shares closed Tuesday at 4.60 dollars, up five cents, and its Class B shares closed unchanged at 4.60 dollars. 

   Based on Tuesday's share values, the concerns have a combined indicated market capitalization of about 2.52 billion dollars ($2.03 billion). 

   Mr. Steen said his gold production estimates for the proposed company include output from the disputed Page-Williams mine, ownership of which is being contested by LAC Minerals Ltd. 
The Supreme Court of Canada is expected to end the lengthy legal battle after it hears an appeal by LAC, scheduled for October. 
An Ontario court previously awarded the mine to Corona.
