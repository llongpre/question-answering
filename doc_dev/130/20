   The Supreme Court of Canada awarded the country's richest gold mine to Corona Corp., ending an acrimonious eight-year legal battle between Corona and the mine's developer, LAC Minerals Ltd. 

   The court ruled that Toronto-based LAC must hand over the Page-Williams mine in northern Ontario and that Corona must pay LAC 154 million Canadian dollars (US$131.6 million) for past development costs. 
With interest, the payment would amount to more than C$210 million. 

   Corona, also based in Toronto, said the payment is to come equally from it and from Teck Corp., Vancouver, British Columbia, which plans to operate the mine in an equal partnership with Corona. 
The two companies also will split about C$80 million in profit from the mine that has been held in a trust account since 1986. 

   The ruling upholds the findings of the Ontario Supreme Court in 1986 and the Ontario Court of Appeals a year later, saying that LAC had "breached a duty of confidence" with Corona's predecessor company when it talked with LAC about a possible joint venture in 1981. 
The high court said LAC used confidential information given to it by Corona's predecessor to acquire the property where the Page-Williams mine operates. 

   The Page-Williams mine, which last year produced 379,000 ounces of gold, should produce 490,000 ounces this year, said Peter Steen, Corona's president and chief executive officer. 
He said Corona's half-share of the output would boost the company's production this year by 64% to an expected 625,000 ounces, advancing the company's transformation from a small exploration outfit in the early 1980s to one of Canada's top gold producers. 

   Mr. Steen said the companies plan to accelerate the exploration of little-known areas of the mine. 
The reserves already discovered contain nearly seven million ounces of gold, he said. 
Teck said its operations, without Page-Williams, are expected to produce about 150,000 ounces of gold this year. 

   LAC's chief financial officer, Rolly Francisco, said he was disappointed with the court's ruling but said LAC will abide by the decision and work closely with Corona and Teck to ensure an orderly handover of the mine. 
LAC hasn't included earnings from the Page-Williams mine in its own accounts since 1986. 

   LAC's defeat in court could leave the company vulnerable to a takeover attempt, analysts said. 

   With the company currently holding cash of about C$250 million plus the payment due for the Page-Williams mine, "I think it becomes a real attractive takeover candidate if the share price dropped. 
You would be able to finance much of the takeover cost with the company's own cash," said Julian Baldry, a senior mining analyst at Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc. 

   Before the court decision was announced, LAC shares closed Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $11.375 each, down 12.5 cents. 
Mr. Baldry estimated the company could become vulnerable to takeover if its stock falls below C$10 ($8.54) a share. 

   In composite trading on the American Stock Exchange, Corona Class A shares closed at $7.375 each, down 50 cents. 
Teck Class B shares closed at C$22.625, down C$1.375, on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
