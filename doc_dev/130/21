   Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd. said it offered to buy 19.99% of Dome Mines Ltd. for 417.1 million Canadian dollars ($313.1 million). 

   The transaction could thwart Dome Mines' plan to form North America's biggest gold mining company through a merger with two other concerns. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it offered 21.50 dollars a share to Dome Petroleum Ltd. for about 19.4 million of the 20.9 million Dome Mines shares that the oil and gas company owns. 
If the sale goes through, Giant Yellowknife said it would vote the shares against a proposal to combine Dome Mines with Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd. and Placer Development Ltd. 

   Shareholders of the three companies are to vote on the merger proposal Aug. 12. 
In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dome Mines closed at 21 dollars, up one dollar. 

   David Emery, president of Giant Yellowknife, declined to say why his company would oppose the merger. 
But a Giant Yellowknife insider said the company prefers a major stake in Dome Mines to a smaller one in the combined company, since the two concerns could benefit from "synergies" in their gold mining operations. 
The companies operate several gold mines and mills near Timmins, Ontario. 

   The insider said Giant Yellowknife is also interested in Dome Mines' 21.4% stake in Toronto-based Falconbridge Ltd., which has zinc, copper and gold mines in the area. 
Giant Yellowknife is a gold producer, but it is indirectly controlled by Ariadne Australia Ltd., of Australia, which has interests in other metals. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it would offer to buy Dome Petroleum's remaining 1.5 million shares in Dome Mines if certain regulatory approvals can be obtained or waived. 
Under Ontario securities regulations, such approval is usually required if a buyer wishes to purchase 20% or more of a company without extending the offer to all shareholders. 
Dome Petroleum's shares represent about 21.5% of Dome Mines. 

   Calgary, Alberta-based Dome Petroleum said it expects to respond to the offer by Friday, which is when it expires. 
The sale would need approval from creditors whose loans to Dome Petroleum are secured by its Dome Mines shares. 
The creditors would receive about 75% of the proceeds if the offer were accepted, Dome Petroleum said. 

   Dome Mines, Toronto-based Campbell and Vancouver-based Placer said they still intend to proceed with the proposed merger. 

   Analysts were generally negative toward Giant Yellowknife's offer. 
John Lydall, of First Marathon Securities Ltd., Toronto, said the price offered to Dome Petroleum for its Dome Mines shares is no higher than the price Dome Petroleum would receive in the form of stock from the merger of the three companies. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it plans no follow-up offer to Dome Mines' remaining holders. 
It said that if its offer is accepted by Dome Petroleum and the gold company merger is approved, it will consider exercising certain rights under Canadian law that could force Dome Mines to buy back Giant Yellowknife's holdings in the company. 
The merger plan requires approval by two-thirds of Dome Mines' holders. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it would finance purchase of the Dome Mines stake by borrowing from Giant Resources Ltd., a unit of Ariadne Australia. 
It said it planned to retire the debt through a rights issue to its shareholders. 
It also said it has arranged, subject to regulatory approval, for a private placement of 1.4 million Giant Yellowknife shares with Giant Resources at 28.25 dollars each. 

   Giant Yellowknife currently has 6.9 million shares outstanding. 
Its shares closed at 27.25 dollars, down 75 cents, in trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

   Giant Yellowknife, which expects to produce about 200,000 ounces of gold from five mines this year, was indirectly acquired by Ariadne earlier this year. 
Ariadne, through Giant Resources, since has acquired a zinc and lead mine in Canada's Yukon. 

   Dome Mines, Campbell and Placer had 1986 combined gold production of 825,000 ounces, more than any single producer outside South Africa and the Soviet Union. 
Analysts estimate output of the amalgamated company would rise to 1.1 million ounces by 1989. 
Placer also has copper, silver and oil and gas interests.
