   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- International Corona Corp.
announced a plan that would split Corona into two companies
and loosen mining financier Ned Goodman's control over its
gold assets.
   Under terms of the plan, Corona would keep the gold
assets, but its two classes of stock would be replaced with a
single class of shares with equal voting rights. Holders also
would get shares in Dundee Bancorp Inc., a Corona subsidiary
based in Toronto. Corona would spin off Dundee, and transfer
to the subsidiary its interests in oil and gas, industrial
minerals and merchant banking.

   Corona put a value of 281.4 million Canadian dollars
(US$244.8 million) on its non-gold assets.
   Analysts said the restructuring likely would bolster the
market valuation of Corona's gold assets, making it easier
for the company to raise equity financing to develop its next
big gold project, the Eskay Creek deposit in northern British
Columbia. They said the improved investor opinion would
reflect in part the company's plans to abandon its
much-criticized multiple-share structure, which gives Mr.
Goodman and a few associates control of 70% of the votes in
Corona with less than 4% of the equity.
   Shares in Dundee Bancorp, however, likely would suffer, as
the subsidiary would maintain a two-tiered share structure
that keeps Mr. Goodman and others firmly in control of voting
rights, analysts said. Mr. Goodman would serve as chairman
and chief executive officer of Dundee Bancorp, whose assets
would include a one-third stake in Poco Petroleums Ltd., a
Canadian oil and gas concern. Dundee also would be the
biggest shareholder in Corona, with a 30% stake.
   In late trading on the American Stock Exchange yesterday,
Corona Class A shares were quoted at $7.50, down 50 cents a
share. The Class B multiple voting shares finished on the
Toronto Stock Exchange at C$9.375, down 87.5 Canadian cents.
   The restructuring will allow investors to choose between
Corona's gold assets and Mr. Goodman's enterprising style,
said Barry Allan, an analyst at Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Ltd. "You can either play gold or you can play Ned, who has
demonstrated that he can put deals together," he said.
   Mr. Goodman, with little cash but a knack for creative
financing, helped build Corona from a hodgepodge of small
mining outfits into a major concern that produces about 700
ounces of gold annually.
   Under terms of the plan, which is subject to regulatory
and shareholder approvals, shareholders would exchange 100
Corona shares of either class for 70 new Corona shares and 30
shares and 25 warrants of Dundee Bancorp. Dundee would pay
Corona C$100 million in cash, which the company said it would
use to pay off debt. The transaction is expected to be
completed in October, Corona said.
   Separately, Peter Steen, Corona's president and chief
executive officer, said the company had resumed talks with
Placer Dome Inc. of Vancouver about jointly developing the
Eskay Creek deposit, which contains an estimated 3.2 million
ounces of gold. The two concerns have been at loggerheads
since last year when they launched competing bids to acquire
the companies that own the property.
   "I think we're getting to the point where we feel we'll
have a suitable arrangement" with Placer Dome, Mr. Steen
said.
   Although Corona has the dominant ownership position at
Eskay Creek, it has large debts and little cash. Placer
Dome's deep pockets could be invaluable in financing the
development of the mine, which analysts estimate will cost
some C$200 million.
