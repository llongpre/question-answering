   CALGARY, Alberta -- Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. said it was
again seeking a buyer for its 92% stake in Asamera Minerals
Inc., a precious-metal concern, as part of an effort to
reduce debt.
   Gulf Canada, controlled by Toronto's Reichmann family,
pulled the Asamera stake off the market last spring because
of low gold prices. The gold price has barely changed since
then, but a Gulf spokesman said the company recently has been
contacted by parties wondering if the stake still was for
sale. He said there aren't any formal discussions currently
taking place.

   The spokesman said that Asamera doesn't fit with Gulf
Canada's strategy of concentrating on its principal business
of oil and gas production and development. He said Gulf
Canada wants to reduce its long-term debt to about 500
million Canadian dollars ($431.2 million) by the end of this
year from C$902 million at Dec. 31, 1990.
   Asamera's main asset is a 51% stake in the Cannon gold and
silver mine at Wenatchee, Wash., which last year produced
149,330 ounces of gold. Analysts estimate Gulf Canada's
holding in Asamera could fetch between C$50 million and C$75
million.
   Vancouver, British Columbia-based Corona Corp., a big gold
producer that indirectly holds an interest in the Cannon mine
through an affiliate, Breakwater Resources Ltd., said it
would "take another look" at the Asamera stake. Corona last
year ended a pact to purchase the stake for about C$100
million in stock.
   Vancouver-based Breakwater, in which Corona holds a 27%
interest, owns 49% of the Cannon mine.
   Separately, Asamera reported a loss for 1990 of C$5.2
million, or 21 Canadian cents a share, after writing down
C$6.9 million in deferred exploration costs. A year earlier,
Asamera had net income of C$2 million, or eight Canadian
cents a share. Revenue rose to C$37.6 million from C$37
million.
