   Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd. said Newmont Mining Corp. is seeking a buyer for its 33.5% stake in Sherritt Gordon. 

   The approximately 7.5 million Sherritt Gordon shares held by Newmont have a current market value of about 39.2 million Canadian dollars ($30.7 million). 
In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Sherritt Gordon shares closed at 5.25 dollars ($4.11), down 25 cents. 

   Sherritt Gordon said the possible sale of the stake is one of several steps Newmont is taking to reduce debt. 
Officials at Newmont, a New York-based mining concern, couldn't be reached for comment. 
Newmont is Sherritt Gordon's biggest holder. 

   Separately, Sherritt Gordon said it agreed to sell its 58% interest in SherrGold Inc. to Hayes Resources Inc. for about 23.2 million Canadian dollars ($18.2 million) in cash and stock. 

   SherrGold's chief asset is the MacLellan gold mine in Lynn Lake, Manitoba, which produced about 40,000 ounces of gold last year. 

   Under the agreement, Hayes will pay Sherritt Gordon 17 million dollars in cash and 2.4 million new Hayes shares. 
The shares would represent an 8% interest in Hayes, a small Toronto-based exploration concern controlled by a group that includes American Barrick Resources Corp., a major gold producer also based in Toronto. 

   Sherritt Gordon, a mining, metal refining, fabricating and fertilizer concern, said the proposed sale of the SherrGold interest would improve its balance sheet and reduce consolidated debt about 14 million dollars. 

   In trading Friday on the Toronto exchange, SherrGold shares closed at 1.75 dollars, down 14 cents, and Hayes shares closed at 2.20 dollars, unchanged.
