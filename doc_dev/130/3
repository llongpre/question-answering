   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said it intends to raise its stake in its affiliate International Corona Resources Ltd. to 51% from 40%. 

   Royex, a Toronto-based gold mining concern, said it also has agreed to sell its 51% stake in Mascot Gold Mines Ltd. to an affiliate for a total of $150 million in cash, notes and preferred shares. 

   Peter Steen, president and chief executive officer of Royex, said it wants to increase its investment in International Corona "to make it abundantly clear that we control the company." 
International Corona is being sued by a director, Murray Pezim, who is seeking to replace five of the company's 10 directors. 
Mr. Steen is also chairman, president and chief executive of International Corona, which has a 49% stake in Royex. 

   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, International Corona closed at $39.50 (Canadian), down $1.50. 
Royex would have to buy about 2.4 million International Corona shares to raise its stake to 51%, and yesterday's closing price gives the additional shares an indicated value of $94.8 million. 

   Mr. Steen said Royex is in discussions with investment advisers to arrange financing for the International Corona stock purchase. 
He said Royex hasn't decided whom it will buy the shares from. 

   Royex is selling the stake in Mascot Gold Mines to Lacana Mining Corp. in order to reduce Royex's bank debt and to help finance the purchase of International Corona shares. 

   Lacana Mining, which is 36% owned by Royex, has agreed to buy the Mascot Gold Mining shares for $65 million cash, a $25 million promissory note and $60 million in preferred shares of a Lacana subsidiary. 
Lacana and Mascot are gold mining concerns based in Toronto. 

   International Corona is a Toronto mining concern.
