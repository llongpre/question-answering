   Shareholders of Dome Mines Ltd., its Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd. unit and Placer Development Ltd. approved a previously reported agreement to merge, creating North America's biggest gold mining concern. 

   The new company, Placer Dome Inc., expects to produce more than 800,000 ounces of gold this year, more than any gold producer outside South Africa and the Soviet Union, but only a small portion of world-wide gold production, which totaled 50.2 million ounces in 1986. 

   Placer Dome's shares were to be listed for trading today on stock exchanges in Toronto, Montreal and New York. 
The company has applied to list its shares on the Paris stock exchange and on exchanges in Vancouver, British Columbia, and Sydney, Australia. 

   Under terms of the merger, shareholders of the three concerns exchanged their holdings for Placer Dome shares at varying conversion rates, with one Placer Dome share equal to one share of Vancouver, British Columbia-based Placer Development. 
In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Placer Development closed at 26.125 Canadian dollars ($19.65), down 12.5 cents. 

   Placer Dome will have about 219.2 million shares outstanding and a market capitalization of about 5.7 billion dollars ($4.3 billion). 

   The merger gives Dome Mines substantial gold production outside of Canada and largely reduces the potential impact of a loan guarantee extended by Dome Mines to debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd. 
The merger also reduces the large oil and gas concern's 21.5% stake in Dome Mines to about 8% of Placer Dome. 

   Placer Development gains significant North American gold production to complement its holdings in Australia and New Guinea. 
Placer also gains a connection with Falconbridge Ltd., a large Toronto-based mining concern with interests in nickel, zinc and copper, in which Dome Mines held a 24.9% interest on a fully diluted basis. 

   Analysts generally approved of the merger. 
"It's the first of the new generation of gold mining companies to be a true multinational," said John Lydall of First Marathon Securities Ltd., Toronto. 

   Placer Dome has two head offices, in Toronto and Vancouver. 
Dome Mines Chairman Fraser Fell will continue as chairman of the new company. 
John Walton, president and chief executive officer of Placer, will retain the same posts at Placer Dome. 

   The merger ends efforts by another Toronto gold producer, Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd., to gain control of Dome Mines. 
Last week, Dome Petroleum rejected an offer by Giant Yellowknife to acquire its block of Dome Mines shares. 

   Giant Yellowknife said it "wouldn't rule out" the possibility that it may try to acquire a sizable position in Placer Dome.
