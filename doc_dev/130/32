   Scintilore Explorations Ltd., a Montreal-based mineral exploration firm, launched an action in the Supreme Court of Ontario against several prospectors and companies involved in developing the province's Hemlo gold camp. 

   In its filing, Scintilore said it seeks an order that would give it assets and royalties currently received by the prospectors, John Larche and Donald McKinnon. 
Under terms of their agreements with the owners of two of Hemlo's three large gold mines, Messrs. 
Larche and McKinnon hold shares and cash and receive royalties on the mines' production. 

   Scintilore said that Mr. Larche, while indirectly employed by Scintilore in 1979 to stake properties in the then-undeveloped Hemlo area, "failed or refused" to do so, instead staking claims "for himself and for his own benefit." 
Scintilore alleged that Mr. McKinnon, who also was prospecting in the area, pooled his claims with Mr. Larche for "their joint benefit." 

   The prospectors subsequently sold some of the claims to Teck Corp. of Vancouver, International Corona Resources Ltd. of Toronto and Hemlo Gold Mines Inc. 

   Scintilore said it didn't become aware of "the material facts" until November of last year. 
Theodore Polisuk, president of Scintilore, declined to elaborate on the court filing. 

   Messrs. 
Larche and McKinnon couldn't immediately be reached for comment. 

   Teck jointly operates Hemlo's David Bell mine with International Corona. 
Hemlo Gold Mines is owner of the Golden Giant mine. 
Hemlo Gold is 50%-owned by Noranda Inc., Toronto. 

   Proceeds to the prospectors include 3% royalties on the mines' gold production. 
Messrs. 
Larche and McKinnon also hold 400,000 shares of Corona, about 2,660,000 shares of Hemlo Gold, and "substantial" cash, Scintilore said. 

   How much revenue accrues from the royalties wasn't clear. 
At the close of trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the shares had a combined market value of $89.3 million (Canadian). 

   Teck's president and chief executive officer, Norman Keevil Jr., said he hadn't been advised of the action and declined comment. 
Executives at Noranda and Corona weren't immediately available for comment.
