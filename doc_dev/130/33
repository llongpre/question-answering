   Australia's Western Mining Corp. Holdings Ltd. agreed to acquire the Canadian gold mining assets of Northgate Exploration Ltd. and plans to launch tender offers for two small Canadian gold concerns. 

   The transactions have a total indicated value of 259.7 million Canadian dollars ($198.7 million) and follow by four days Western Mining's proposed offer to acquire Seabright Resources Inc., another Canadian gold producer, for 92 million dollars. 

   Western Mining, Australia's largest gold mining concern, said the moves are part of its plan to form "a significant Canadian mining and exploration company." 
Hugh Morgan, Western Mining's managing director, said the proposed acquisitions would make up "the base" for future growth in Canada. 
He wouldn't say whether additional Canadian acquisitions are planned. 

   In addition to its agreement to acquire Northgate's mining unit for 160 million dollars, Western Mining said it plans to launch tender offers to acquire Norbeau Mines Inc. and Vancouver-based Grandview Resources Inc. Norbeau is 35%-owned by Northgate, which has agreed to tender its shares under the planned offer. 

   Through separate units, Western Mining said it would offer 22 cents a share, or a total 4.7 million dollars, for Norbeau, and 9.55 dollars a share, or a total 95 million dollars, for Grandview. 

   Western Mining said it reached agreement with certain Grandview directors and holders to tender their combined 15.5% fully diluted interest under the planned offer, which the company expects to make by Jan. 1. 
Western Mining currently holds 3.5% of Grandview's common shares. 

   The planned purchase of the Northgate unit, which comprises two Quebec mines that produce gold as well as silver and copper, is expected to close in late January. 
Northgate said the planned sale is an opportunity for it to "realize the intrinsic value" of the mines, which it purchased in 1981. 

   Northgate declined to estimate the size of an expected gain on the sale. 
The company said net proceeds of about 130 million dollars will be mainly used to finance gold mining acquisitions. 
Northgate said it will seek pure gold mines only. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Northgate closed at 8.375 dollars, up 1.00 dollar, and Norbeau closed at 15 cents, unchanged. 
Grandview closed on the Vancouver Stock Exchange at 8.50 dollars, up 1.50 dollars. 

   If successfully concluded, the proposed Canadian acquisitions would in 1988 give Western Mining additional gold output of at least 120,000 ounces, including about 80,000 ounces from Northgate's mines. 
James Capel &amp; Co., a London-based securities dealer, projects gold output of 471,000 ounces from Western Mining's current properties for the current fiscal year. 

   Western Mining's Mr. Morgan said additional gold production in Canada would most likely come from Seabright, which has large land holdings in Nova Scotia. 
He said it "has yet to be determined" whether Western Mining would merge the Canadian companies into one, once the proposed transactions are concluded.
