   The Ontario Supreme Court dismissed a bid by LAC Minerals Ltd. for a new trial to determine ownership of the disputed Page-Williams gold mine, which the court awarded in 1986 to a predecessor of Corona Corp. 

   Ontario Supreme Court Justice Coulter Osborne isn't expected to release his reasons for the ruling until Friday, officials said. 
Justice Osborne disclosed his decision privately to attorneys yesterday, following a hearing that ended last week. 

   The ruling leaves LAC with one remaining avenue of legal recourse in its long battle with Corona, namely, an appeal before the Supreme Court of Canada. 
LAC's appeal before the nation's highest court is due to conclude today, but a decision may not be rendered for months, company officials said. 

   "We're certainly pleased with the (Ontario court's) decision, but this is one heat only. 
The final is taking place in the Supreme Court of Canada," a Corona spokesman said. 
"So while this decision is positive, it's not conclusive." 

   Roland Francisco, LAC's senior vice president and treasurer, said Justice Osborne's ruling "doesn't change the complexion" of LAC, which excluded Page-Williams from its results after an appeals court last year upheld the 1986 Supreme Court of Ontario ruling. 

   In upholding the ruling, the appeals court agreed that LAC had in 1981 breached a trust with Corona's predecessor, International Corona Resources Ltd., regarding a joint exploration venture. 
The court said LAC used confidential information given by International Corona to acquire the property where the Page-Williams mine now operates. 

   Toronto-based Corona, one of North America's biggest gold producers, was formed in July through the merger of International Corona and four affiliated companies. 

   In requesting a new trial, LAC said in its court filing that the initial decision in 1986 "was obtained by fraud consisting of perjured or intentionally misleading evidence" from Donald McKinnon, a prospector and agent of Corona's predecessor, International Corona. 
Mr. McKinnon testified at the original trial and also at the hearing that led to yesterday's ruling. 

   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Corona's Class A shares closed at 9.625 Canadian dollars (US$9.97), up 25 Canadian cents. 
LAC closed at C$12.25, off 25 Canadian cents.
