   The over-the-counter market sank a bit yesterday. 
In fact, prices of most OTC stocks, and nearly every industry group, slumped about 2%. 

   That's unusual, because the OTC market is usually driven by its large technology sector, which makes volatile twists and turns; or by its huge complement of bank stocks. 
Not yesterday. 

   Computer stocks fell a little less in price than most industry groups, down slightly less than 2%. 
Apple Computer, the biggest OTC computer manufacturer, was off 1/2 at 37 1/4; Microsoft, the biggest OTC-traded software concern, was down 1/2 at 47. 
Bank stocks were also off about 2%. 

   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 5.96 points to 320.43, a 1.8% decline. 
Similar declines cut across such industry groups as insurance, telecommunications, biotechnology, industrial service, utility, paper, consumer product and retail stocks. 
Declining issues led advancers by about 2 1/3 to one on both Nasdaq and Nasdaq's National Market System, where most of the larger stocks trade. 

   That suggests the Monday gloom spread evenly through most sizes of stocks, including the small and medium issues, where bargain hunters have been sifting. 
Nasdaq volume slowed to 115.5 million shares yesterday, the lowest since Nasdaq trading hours were reduced to help brokers cope with post-crash volume. 
Traders said most bargain hunting went on hold yesterday, apparently to give investors time to assess the impact of the renewed weakness in the dollar on various stocks and industries. 

   Scattered groups with some immediate vulnerability to the dollar's problems were hit slightly harder than the rest of the market. 
The 31 Nasdaq-listed trucking companies, for example, slipped 4% yesterday. 
Roadway Services, the largest, dropped 1 1/2 to 30 1/4, a 4.7% decline; Yellow Freight Delivery was off 2 3/8 to 27 1/4, an 8% slide. 
Among the smaller truckers, Viking Freight fell 3/4 to 12 3/4; Circle Express was down 1/2 to 6; Marten Transport fell 3/4 to 6 1/4; Chemical Leaman was off 1 1/4 at 23 1/2; Freymiller Trucking fell 3/4 to 7 and Courier Dispatch slipped 1/4 to 3 1/2. 

   Even the usual beneficiaries of doom -- the gold stocks -- were hurt yesterday. 
Such stocks blossom with the threat of rising inflation that comes with increases in interest rates, the blow that usually sends U.S. stock prices reeling. 
But the weakening dollar brings recession fears, rather than inflationary ones, analysts say. 

   Thus, prices of the 67 Nasdaq gold stocks, on average, declined nearly 2% with the rest of the market yesterday, but the losers were all U.S. and Canadian-based mining companies. 
Among the larger U.S. gold mining stocks, Coeur d'Alene fell 1/4 to 16 1/4; U.S. Mineral Exploration was unchanged at 3 9/16, and Royal Gold fell 1/4 to 5 7/8. 
Among the biggest Canadian-based Nasdaq issues, Pegasus Gold fell 1/8 to 13 1/4; Galactic Resources was off 3/8 to 6 1/8 and Lacana Mining fell 3/8 to 8 3/8. 

   South African gold stocks, on the other hand, were up a bit yesterday. 
These issues are largely bought by non-U.S. investors on the London or Johannesburg stock exchanges, but some shares trade in the U.S. on Nasdaq. 
In U.S. trading yesterday, Free State Consolidated Gold Mining rose 1/4 to 12; Blyvooruitzicht Gold Mining rose 1/8 to 5 1/2, and Gold Fields of South Africa was up 1/8 to 15.
