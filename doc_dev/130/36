   International Corona Corp. and Homestake Mining Co. said
they are discussing a possible merger.
   The companies wouldn't disclose the terms of the proposed
transaction. They said in a brief statement that they expect
to announce the outcome of the negotiations early next week.
Corona and Homestake officials declined further comment.

   For Homestake, which operates the oldest gold mine in the
U.S., a link with Corona would provide additional gold
reserves that are relatively cheap to mine, analysts say. At
the same time, a merger would help Corona clean up its
debt-heavy balance sheet and give it the financial muscle to
develop its rich Eskay Creek gold prospect in British
Columbia.
   Corona, a young company that has scrambled its way to the
top ranks of gold producers, bears little resemblance to the
more traditionally run Homestake. Corona, for instance, is a
proponent of gold loans as a means of raising cash. Homestake
shuns financing techniques that would prevent its stock from
serving as a proxy for buying bullion.
   "A merger makes a lot of sense to me as a very attractive
situation for both Homestake and Corona," said Vahid Fathi,
an analyst at Kemper Securities Group. Mr. Fathi said
concerns about cultural differences is a "luxury that they
can't afford."
   San Francisco's Homestake is one of the biggest gold
producers in the U.S., with output topping one million
ounces. Still, the company has had losses in the past two
years, largely because of the high cost of its mining
operations. Last year, Homestake had cash production costs of
about $300 an ounce of gold, more than $100 an ounce higher
than Corona's costs. A merged company would average out those
production costs.
   Corona, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, last year
produced about 700,000 ounces of gold. It owns some of the
richest gold properties in North America but is bogged down
by debt of some 320 million Canadian dollars (US$267.1
million). "Homestake certainly brings cash to the table,"
said John Phizackerley, an analyst at Lehman Bros. Homestake
had $160 million in cash at year end.
   Also involved in the merger discussions is Dundee Bancorp
Inc., a Toronto merchant bank that holds about 30% of
Corona's stock. A Corona spokesman said the companies made
the announcement at the request of the Toronto Stock Exchange
following a strong rise in Corona's share price. Trading in
Corona's shares was halted at C$4.50, up 30 cents.
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Homestake shares were
quoted late yesterday at US$15, down 25 cents.
