   Dome Petroleum Ltd. rejected an offer by Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd. to purchase its 21.5% stake in Dome Mines Ltd. for 448.6 million Canadian dollars ($339 million). 

   Dome Petroleum declined to comment on its reasons for rejecting the offer, but said it would vote its shares in favor of a previously reported plan to merge Dome Mines with two other gold mining concerns. 
Giant Yellowknife had planned to vote against the merger if it acquired the shares. 

   Shareholders of Toronto-based Dome Mines, its Campbell Red Lake Mines Ltd. subsidiary and Vancouver, British Columbia-based Placer Development Ltd. are scheduled to vote on the merger Wednesday. 
The combined concern would be North America's biggest gold mining company. 

   Dome Mines said it is "pleased that (Dome Petroleum) is supportive" of the merger plan. 
Placer said it is "pleased that the amalgamation can proceed as planned." 

   Giant Yellowknife, a Toronto-based gold mining company, had offered 21.50 Canadian dollars a share for the Dome Mines stake. 
Dome Mines closed Friday at 21 dollars, down 37.5 cents, in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 

   Clifford Frame, chairman and chief executive officer of Giant Yellowknife, said he remains "convinced the merger is not in the interests of shareholders" of Dome Mines. 
He said Placer is a more "risk oriented" investment than Dome Mines, because much of its future gold production will come from mines in Papua New Guinea. 
All of Dome Mines' production is in Canada. 

   But Mr. Frame said Giant Yellowknife will drop plans to organize opposition to the merger and "wouldn't rule out" the possibility that Giant Yellowknife might seek to acquire a significant stake in the new company, if the merger plan goes through. 
He said Giant Yellowknife, whose offer would have been financed through a loan from a unit of its Australian parent, Ariadne Australia Ltd., will continue to seek "sizable acquisitions." 

   Dome Petroleum, as Dome Mines' largest holder, would wind up as the biggest shareholder in Placer Dome Inc., as the amalgamated company would be named, with a stake of about 8%.
