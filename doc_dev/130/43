   John Kachmar, president and chief executive officer of Dickenson Mines Ltd., said the company expects to combine, through a share exchange, with 33%-owned Wharf Resources Ltd. 

   Terms will be disclosed at a later date. 
Dickenson expects to complete the planned transaction within 60 to 90 days. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Dickenson closed at 7.75 Canadian dollars ($6.31) a share, down 25 cents; Wharf was unchanged at 6.125 dollars a share. 

   Mr. Kachmar said at the mining concern's annual meeting that the proposed transaction would create a gold-mining company with annual output of 135,000 ounces at a cash operating cost of $235 an ounce. 
Dickenson has a 65% stake in an underground mine at Red Lake, Ontario, from which it expects to produce 80,000 ounces of gold this year. 
Dickenson also produces silver, lead, zinc and lime. 

   Wharf, Calgary, Alberta, owns an open-pit gold mine in South Dakota. 
Mr. Kachmar, named president and chief executive of Wharf in January after Dickenson acquired its stake, said he expects Wharf's mine to produce 70,000 ounces of gold annually once an expansion program is completed in the fourth quarter. 

   Mr. Kachmar said he is "confident" the proposed amalgamation will win shareholder approvals. 
He said Dickenson would likely offer less for the remaining Wharf shares than the price it previously paid. 
It paid an average 7.32 dollars a Wharf share for its current stake. 

   Separately, Mr. Kachmar said Dickenson is seeking additional acquisitions of gold companies or reserves in the U.S. comparable in size to Wharf. 
He said he is "optimistic" that an acquisition would be concluded in 1988. 

   Mr. Kachmar said he expects Dickenson's 1988 net income to be "in the ballpark" of 1987 net, which reached 6.4 million dollars ($5.2 million), or 44 cents a share, on revenue of 44.1 million dollars. 
Dickenson reported first-quarter 1988 net of 508,000 dollars, or four cents a share, down from net of 1.2 million dollars, or nine cents a share, in the prior-year period.
