   Consolidated TVX Mining Corp. shareholders voted to
approve merging the company with the gold-mining subsidiary
of Inco Ltd.
   The combined company, to be called TVX Gold Corp., will be
62%-owned by Inco, a major nickel producer. Shareholders of
Consolidated TVX, which has interests in gold and silver
mines in Brazil and Chile, will own the remaining 38%.
Consolidated TVX and Inco are based in Toronto.

   Under terms of the agreement, Consolidated TVX will issue
83 million new shares to Inco. The deal has an indicated
value of about $415 million Canadian dollars (US$360
million), based on Consolidated TVX shares' closing price of
C$5, up 15 Canadian cents, on the Toronto Stock Exchange
yesterday. The transaction was closed late yesterday.
   TVX Gold is expected to have 1991 production of about
350,000 ounces of gold and equivalent ore reserves containing
about seven million ounces, under a conversion ratio of 80
ounces of silver equal to one ounce of gold equivalent.
