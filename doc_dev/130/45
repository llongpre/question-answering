   CALGARY, Alberta -- Poco Petroleums Ltd. said it acquired
a 32% stake in Voyager Energy Inc. for 43 million Canadian
dollars (US$37.1 million) and said it intends to pursue a
second attempt to merge with Voyager.
   Poco acquired 32% of Voyager's common and a further 29% of
its common purchase warrants outstanding from CanCapital
Corp., an investment and merchant banking concern.

   Combining Poco and Voyager would create one of the top 12
Canadian oil and gas production concerns, analysts said, and
one of the largest independent producers. Together, the two
companies would have an indicated market value of about
C$425.4 million. They also would have a production capacity
of 150 million to 160 million feet of natural gas and 18,000
barrels of oil and liquids a day, Poco executives said.
   The first merger attempt was called off last year after
directors of the companies failed to reach agreement on
terms.
   "The current relative market and underlying values of the
companies should provide a basis for the successful
completion of a merger at this time," said Don Barkwell,
president of Poco. Voyager executives couldn't be reached for
comment.
   Vancouver-based Corona Corp., which has a 47% stake in
Poco, said it is pursuing plans to sell its Poco holdings to
reduce debt related to its Eskay Creek gold mining
operations. The proposed merger of Voyager and Poco "makes
the sale of the controlling block of Poco even more
attractive" to potential buyers, said Peter Steen, president
and chief executive of Corona. Corona executives said that
the sale process for its Poco interest is "well under way"
and that they hope to complete it "as soon as possible." They
declined to identify any potential buyers.
   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Poco
Petroleum closed at C$7.50 a share, unchanged. Shares of
Voyager Energy closed at C$4.80, up 45 Canadian cents.
