   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Galactic Resources Ltd.
said it is considering acquiring DCC Equities Ltd., a
Toronto-based merchant bank, in a move that would give mining
financier Ned Goodman a major stake in Galactic.
   Terms of the transaction haven't been set, but the deal
likely will involve Galactic's issuing shares for "all or
substantially all" of the assets of DCC Equities, said Peter
Guest, president and chief executive officer of Galactic, a
gold mining concern based here.

   Closely held DCC is 52% owned by Dundee Capital Inc. of
Toronto with the rest held by a few institutions. Dundee, in
turn, is controlled by Mr. Goodman, its chairman and chief
executive, through direct shareholdings and through his
controlling stake in Corona Corp., a Vancouver-based gold
producer.
   "I believe he'll be a very good partner," Mr. Guest said
of Mr. Goodman, adding that Galactic's current management
would remain in place. "We needed to do something to really
get the company jump-started during these hard times."
   Low gold prices have sent Galactic seeking cash for
operations from outside sources. The company hit a snag in
its attempt to raise $10 million through a private placement
of shares, but Mr. Guest said he expects to complete the
offering in coming weeks.
   Although a share-exchange ratio hasn't been set, it
appears that DCC shareholders would hold a significant
portion of Galactic's share capital following the proposed
acquisition. With 46.9 million shares outstanding, Galactic
has a market capitalization of about $41 million, based on
yesterday's unchanged closing share price on the American
Stock Exchange of 87.5 cents.
   DCC holds equity investments with a current market value
of 140 million Canadian dollars (US$122.3 milion), the
company said.
