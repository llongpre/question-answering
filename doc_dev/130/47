   A Western Mining Corp. Holdings unit plans to offer 11.25 Canadian dollars a share, or about 95.2 million dollars ($73.8 million), to acquire Toronto-based Western Goldfields Inc. 

   The two companies said in a statement that the unit, WMC Acquisition Inc., holds 1.7% of Western Goldfields' 8.5 million common shares outstanding. 
They said a group that holds a combined stake of 41% in Western Goldfields has agreed to tender its shares under the planned offer. 

   Western Mining said it hopes to proceed with the offer within two weeks. 
If successful, the transaction would close by the end of February. 

   Western Goldfields officials weren't available for comment. 
In trading Friday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, the company's shares closed at 10.75 dollars, up 2 dollars. 

   Western Mining's proposed acquisition would be its fifth in Canada since mid-December, when it announced bids for three other small Canadian gold mining and exploration concerns, and an agreement to buy gold assets of another company in a private transaction. 
These transactions are expected to close by Feb. 1. 

   Including the proposed Western Goldfields acquisition, the transactions have a combined value of about 446.9 million dollars ($346.6 million). 

   Western Mining, Australia's biggest gold producer, has said the moves are part of its plan to build "a significant Canadian mining and exploration company." 
The proposed acquisition of Western Goldfields, which operates a small open-pit mine in Nevada, would raise to about 250,000 ounces the expected output of its combined North American properties in 1988, a Western Mining spokesman said. 

   Separately, Western Goldfields said it agreed to sell its 18.4% stake in Vancouver-based Delaware Resources Corp. to a group of Western Goldfields shareholders for 8.25 dollars a share, or 13 million dollars. 
Delaware Resources has several gold properties in western Canada.
