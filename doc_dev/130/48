   Golden Shield Resources Ltd. said it agreed to acquire Kerr Addison Mines Ltd.'s Virginiatown, Ontario, gold mine and its interest in two gold mining properties for $38 million (Canadian) in cash and securities. 

   Golden Shield, a mining concern, said the purchase price includes $15 million in cash. 
Kerr Addison also will receive debentures and common shares of Golden Shield equal to a 25% interest. 
Kerr Addison said it will receive an option to purchase additional Golden Shield common shares that could boost its stake to 40%. 

   Consolidated TVX Mining Corp., Brazil, is currently Golden Shield's largest shareholder, with a 25% interest. 
Kerr Addison is 49.4%-owned by Toronto-based Noranda Inc., a forest products, mining and manufacturing concern. 

   Ian Bayer, president and chief executive officer of Kerr Addison, said the transaction will "enhance the value" of the Virginiatown mine to Kerr Addison, which has interests in precious and base metals mining and oil and gas. 
Proceeds from the transaction will be used for general purposes, he said. 

   Mr. Bayer said the transaction, scheduled to close June 30, would reduce Kerr Addison's expected 1987 gold output to 100,000 ounces from 140,000 ounces.
