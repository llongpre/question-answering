   Shareholders of Royex Gold Mining Corp. and four affiliates approved a merger to create Corona Corp., North America's fifth-largest gold producer. 

   Peter Steen, Corona's president and chief executive officer, said the new company expects gold output of 650,000 ounces next year, up from a previously forecast 465,000 ounces for 1988. 
He said Corona's average cash operating cost is about $170 an ounce, ranking it among the world's lowest-cost gold producers. 

   In addition to Royex, companies involved in the merger are Galveston Resources Ltd., International Corona Resources Ltd., Lacana Mining Corp. and Mascot Gold Mines Ltd. 
All but Vancouver, British Columbia-based Galveston are based in Toronto. 

   The merger was carried out through an exchange of securities of the five concerns, which have a combined indicated market capitalization of about $2 billion. 

   Ned Goodman, chairman of Corona, said its shares would begin trading July 4 on Canadian exchanges. 
The merging companies will continue to trade under their own listings until July 1, he said.
