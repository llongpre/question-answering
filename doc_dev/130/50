   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc. said it
backed out of a plan to jointly develop a rich British
Columbia gold deposit, leaving debt-burdened International
Corona to seek other means of raising the 210 million
Canadian dollars (US$183.8 million) needed to finance the
project.
   Fears that Corona could be stuck with all of the bill for
Eskay Creek hurt the company's share price. Yesterday, in
trading on the American Stock Exchange, the shares closed at
$4.625, down 37.5 cents. Placer Dome shares closed in
composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $10.50,
off 50 cents.

   Corona, which already has invested about C$300 million in
Eskay Creek, has total debt of about C$380 million.
   But Peter Steen, Corona's president and chief executive
officer, said, "I don't think we'll have any trouble
financing the project." He said that currently the company is
talking with two other gold-mining concerns about putting
money into Eskay Creek, which is expected to begin production
in early 1994. Corona also will seek bank financing after
completing an economic-feasibility study next year, he said.
   Exploration so far has outlined an estimated three million
ounces of gold at Eskay Creek, valued at about $1.08 billion
at current market prices. Production costs are projected to
be less than $150 an ounce, one of the lowest cost structures
in the industry.
   Placer Dome agreed that the deposit could become a
profitable gold mine. However, the company said it objected
to the proposed joint-venture agreement, which would have
saddled Placer with repaying all the capital costs while
receiving just 50% of the mine's cash flow. Placer spokesman
Hugh Leggatt said the company estimated that it wouldn't
begin to see a profit from the mine until after six years.
The mine is expected to have a relatively short lifespan of
eight years.
   Under the now-defunct plan, cash-rich Placer had agreed to
build the mine in exchange for increasing its stake in the
deposit to 50% from the current 22%. Corona's interest would
have dropped to about 25% from 45%.
   But Corona's Mr. Steen estimated the mine's capital costs
could be repaid in two years using 100% of the cash flow. He
forecast that the mine would produce 250,000 ounces of gold a
year, ranking it among the 10 biggest gold mines in North
America.
   Placer Dome said Corona has the right for the next 90 days
to buy Placer's stake in Eskay Creek for C$105 million.
Failing that, Placer said it could swap its Eskay Creek
interest for shares in Corona or sell it to another party. A
Corona spokesman said it's unlikely Corona would buy Placer's
holding at that price.
