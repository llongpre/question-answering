   Corona Corp., Toronto, said it holds about 2.8 million, or 9.2%, of Vancouver, British Columbia-based Breakwater Resources Ltd.'s common shares outstanding. 
Both are gold mining concerns. 

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Corona said its stake includes 1,617,800 Breakwater shares purchased between July 18 and July 21, for a total of about 8.5 million Canadian dollars (US$7 million). 

   A Corona spokesman said the shares were acquired for investment purposes. 
He said that additional purchases aren't planned and that Corona doesn't plan to sell any of its Breakwater shares. 

   The spokesman said Corona Chairman Ned Goodman is expected to be appointed to the Breakwater board.
