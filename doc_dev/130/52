   Dickenson Mines Ltd. and 33%-owned Wharf Resources Ltd. said they agreed to merge through a share exchange with an indicated value of about 210 million Canadian dollars (US$173.7 million). 

   If approved by regulators and holders, the previously proposed merger would create a gold mining company with annual output of 160,000 ounces from two mines located in Ontario and South Dakota. 

   Under terms of the merger, holders of Wharf's 17.4 million common shares would receive for each share 0.9 Class A shares of the new company; holders of Dickenson's 9.9 million Class A shares would swap their stock for an equal number of Class A shares of the merged concern. 

   Holders of Dickenson's 5.2 million Class B shares, who would control the new company through its Class B multiple voting stock, would receive an equal number of the new company's Class B shares. 
Dickenson's Class B holders would also receive for each of their shares 0.15 Class A share of the new concern. 

   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Dickenson Class A closed at C$6.625, down 12.5 cents, and the company's Class B shares closed at C$8.50, up 25 cents. 
The common shares of Calgary, Alberta-based Wharf closed at C$5.75, unchanged. 

   Based on the companies' indicated share exchange values, the new concern would initially have outstanding about 26.3 million Class A and about 5.2 million Class B shares. 
Wharf's preferred shares would continue as preferred shares of the new company. 

   Dickenson and Wharf shareholders are expected to vote on the proposed merger during the fourth quarter.
