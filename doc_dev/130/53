   American Barrick Resources Corp., a gold mining concern, said it has acquired 9.7 million shares, or 4.9%, of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a large, international mining company based in London. 

   Consolidated Gold Fields, alleging that Barrick "flouted" certain regulations in acquiring the stock, said Britain's Department of Trade and Industry has agreed to begin an investigation of the purchase. 

   Barrick said it has been advised by its legal counsel that it has complied fully with all disclosure requirements under British law. 
It didn't elaborate on when it bought the stock, the price it paid, the reason for the purchase, or whether it intends to buy more of the British concern's shares. 
The 9.7 million Consolidated Gold Field shares have a market value of the equivalent of $89.7 million, based on the closing stock price Friday in London. 

   A Consolidated Gold Fields official said that before American Barrick was identified as the owner of the shares, there had been "difficulties experienced in establishing their ownership." 
He didn't elaborate. 
He declined to comment on whether he thought American Barrick was contemplating a takeover. 

   Barrick, which several years ago was a relatively small concern, has grown aggressively through acquisitions and now is among North America's largest gold mining companies. 

   Separately, a group of Barrick holders agreed to acquire 92% of United Siscoe Mines Ltd. in exchange for their 29% of Barrick's shares, valued for purposes of the transaction at $20.40 (Canadian) a share, or about $131 million. 
United Siscoe is a small, Toronto-based holding company with interests in real estate and oil and gas. 
Most of the shares are being sold by closely held Horsham Securities Ltd., controlled by Peter Munk, Barrick's chairman and chief executive officer. 

   United Siscoe will issue to the Barrick holders 41.6 million new shares valued at $3.15 a share, or $131 million. 
About 4.8 million of the shares are to be given 15 votes each and issued to Mr. Munk, giving him control of the company. 
The remaining shares will have one vote each. 
In addition, one of the Barrick holders who is selling his shares to United Siscoe has agreed to acquire an additional 1.8 million United Siscoe shares for $4 million (U.S.). 

   United Siscoe holders will be asked to approve the transactions at a meeting Dec. 30. 
They also will be asked to approve changing the company's name to Horsham Corp., and to approve a 1-for-3 consolidation of the company's shares. 

   In Toronto Stock Exchange trading Friday, American Barrick closed at $19.375 (Canadian) a share, up 37.5 cents, and United Siscoe closed at $3.25, up 20 cents.
