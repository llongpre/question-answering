   LAC Minerals Ltd. said it wants a new trial to determine ownership of a major North American gold mine, alleging that an Ontario court ruling awarding the mine to rival Corona Corp. was based on false and misleading testimony. 

   LAC's filing yesterday with the Ontario Supreme Court is the latest twist in the protracted legal battle with Corona over the Page-Williams mine, in Hemlo, Ontario, one of North America's largest producing mines. 
The court scheduled a hearing Oct. 27 on LAC's motion to set aside its 1986 ruling that gave the mine to a predecessor of Corona. 

   LAC, in its filing, said the 1986 ruling "was obtained by fraud consisting of perjured or intentionally misleading evidence" from Donald McKinnon, a prospector and agent for Corona who testified at the trial. 
The ruling was upheld last October by the Ontario Court of Appeal. 

   Neither Mr. McKinnon nor his lawyer could be reached for comment. 

   Corona called the motion by LAC "an 11th-hour move." 
As previously reported, the Supreme Court of Canada is scheduled Oct. 11 to hear LAC's final appeal of the lower-court ruling. 
An attorney for LAC said the appeal will proceed regardless of the outcome of its motion for a new trial. 

   In upholding the lower-court ruling, the Ontario appeals court agreed that LAC had breached a trust with International Corona Resources Ltd. in 1981 regarding a joint exploration venture. 
The court said LAC used confidential information given by International Corona to acquire the property where the disputed mine now operates. 

   Last month, International Corona and four affiliated companies completed a merger that resulted in Corona, one of Canada's largest gold producers. 

   Corona also said LAC's new motion actually isn't related to the mine dispute, but is tied to a separate lawsuit launched in April 1987 by Montreal-based Scintilore Explorations Ltd. against Mr. McKinnon and a second prospector, John Larche. 

   Scintilore alleged that Mr. Larche had agreed to stake claims for the company in the Hemlo area, but instead staked claims for himself. 
It said Mr. McKinnon, separately prospecting, pooled his claims with Mr. Larche's. 
The two subsequently sold some of their claims to companies including International Corona. 
Scintilore, in its suit, seeks certain assets and royalty payments made to Messrs. 
McKinnon and Larche by the companies, including International Corona.
