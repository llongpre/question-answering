   International Corona Corp. said it plans to offer
preferred shares, with an indicated value of about 37.8
million Canadian dollars (US$32.6 million), to holders of
about 15% of Stikine Resources Ltd.
   The Vancouver, British Columbia, gold mining company said
the offer -- C$70 of preferred shares for each Stikine share
-- is part of its previously reported plan to merge Stikine
with Prime Resources Inc.

   Stikine and Prime each own 50% of the Eskay Creek gold
prospect in British Columbia. Corona currently owns about 41%
of Stikine and 50% of Prime.
   Placer Dome Inc. owns another 44% of Stikine. A spokesman
for Placer Dome said it has no objection to Corona's plan.
All of the companies are Vancouver gold mining concerns.
   Corona said its offer will be made next month, after
various regulatory approvals have been received. It said the
new issue of preferred will pay an 8% annual dividend and
have a term of five years plus one day.
