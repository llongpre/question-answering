   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Placer Dome Inc. said it
agreed to spend 240 million Canadian dollars (US$211 million)
to raise its stake to 50% in a rich British Columbia gold
deposit, currently controlled by debt-laden International
Corona Corp.
   The agreement finally reconciles the two gold-mining
concerns, which have been at loggerheads since last year when
they launched competing bids to acquire the companies that
own the gold prospect. Although Corona has had the dominant
interest, Placer Dome, which currently controls 22% of the
deposit, said it has now used its strong cash holdings to
achieve an equal role.

   Under terms of the agreement, Placer Dome would spend the
money to continue exploration work at the Eskay Creek
property and to develop a mine at the site. Corona would then
operate the mine, which is expected to begin production in
early 1994. Exploration so far has outlined an estimated 3.5
million ounces of gold at Eskay Creek.
   The property is jointly owned by two small Vancouver
concerns, Prime Resources Group Inc. and Stikine Resources
Ltd. Corona owns 49.8% of Prime and 40.9% of Stikine, while
Placer Dome holds 44% of Stikine. After spending the C$240
million, Placer Dome would end up with a 50% in Eskay Creek.
Placer's current Stikine shares would be retired. The balance
of the property would be owned 32% by Prime Resources and 18%
by Stikine. Corona said it intends to bid for the balance of
the Stikine shares it doesn't already own, giving it a
combined interest of 34% in Eskay Creek. Analysts expect
Corona also will bid for the rest of Prime Resources, but
Corona said it hasn't made up its mind about this.
   Because of the richness of its ore, there has been little
doubt that Eskay Creek would be mined. The agreement,
however, clears up some doubts about how and when. Placer
Dome is well regarded for its mine-development expertise,
which will be needed because of Eskay Creek's remote location
and difficult metallurgical conditions. And Placer's deep
pockets -- some C$700 million in cash -- ensure that the
financing for the project is secure.
   For Corona, which already has invested roughly C$300
million in the project, the agreement removes much of the
risk of investing further. The company has been seeking ways
to reduce its C$450 million debt, including the sale of
assets and the separation of Corona's gold assets and its
non-gold holdings into two companies.
   Corona said it signed a separate agreement that gives it
the option to sell to Placer Dome C$100 million in Corona
convertible preference shares.
