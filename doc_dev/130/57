   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- After 18 months of rebuffs
and anxiety, Margaret Witte expects to complete Monday a
merger of five companies that will make her the head of a
mining concern producing 200,000 ounces of gold a year.
   As a rising figure in North American mining, Mrs. Witte,
37 years old, is breaking new ground in the traditionally
male-dominated industry. Her role as president and chief
executive officer of Royal Oak Resources Ltd. also marks a
coming of age for women, trained in the sciences, who have
worked their way up through the corporate hierarchy of mining
engineers and geologists to the executive offices.

   "She's a pioneer. It hasn't been very long that women have
been pursuing aggressively careers in the mining industry.
You just didn't move up through the ranks," says Maureen
Jensen, president of Noble Peak Resources Ltd., a small
exploration outfit based in Toronto.
   Mrs. Witte established herself by taking chances on
gold-mining assets that nobody else wanted. She confounded
skeptics by raising 33 million Canadian dollars (US$28.8
million) to pay for them. She then slashed 25% from the cost
of producing gold by trimming the companies' work force and
changing mining techniques. This helped turn earnings around
at Giant Yellowknife Mines Ltd., the largest of the five
companies, to C$4.5 million in this year's first quarter from
a loss of C$610,000 a year earlier.
   Now Mrs. Witte believes that merging her acquisitions will
make it easier to sell stock in the combined company to
institutions, whose backing will be critical to her goal of
building a major gold company.
   Royal Oak Resources, a shell company that Mrs. Witte
bought for C$1 million in 1989, acquired controlling stakes
in four affiliated Canadian mining companies -- Giant
Yellowknife Mines, Pamour Inc., Pamorex Minerals Inc. and
Akaitcho Yellowknife Gold Mines Ltd. On the face of it she
got a bargain. The seller, Giant Resources Ltd. of Australia,
which is currently in receivership, had paid roughly C$200
million for the same assets.
   Still, Mrs. Witte has had to scramble to make her bargain
pay off. To raise C$17 million in equity, Mrs. Witte held
more than 100 meetings with European investors in a two-week
period last fall. But on the day the deal was scheduled to
close, Sharps Pixley Inc., which she had expected to back the
deal with a gold loan, walked out the door. That also meant
the equity issue was off.
   "Within 20 minutes after Sharps Pixley walked, Peggy was
negotiating a loan with Westpac {Banking Corp.} and the Bank
of New Zealand," the receivers for the Giant Resources
assets, says Duncan Shirreff, who served at the time as
director of capital markets for ScotiaMcLeod Inc., Royal
Oak's financial adviser. Mrs. Witte got the loan, for C$19.6
million, and most of the equity issue was resold. The deal
finally closed in November.
   Mrs. Witte seems confident that the new company, to be
called Royal Oak Mines Inc., will generate enough cash flow
to service debt and fund future growth. Her aim is to produce
as many as 500,000 ounces annually by acquiring and turning
around other aging gold properties that perhaps have been
abandoned as uneconomic. Her idea of a vacation, once the
deal is approved: a backpack trip to size up gold prospects
in Canada's Arctic region.
   "There's not a lot of meat on the bone at Giant
Yellowknife and Pamour. Really what she's establishing is a
beachhead {for further acquisitions}. Her specialty is
lowgrade assets. That's where she feels she has an edge,"
says Barry Allen, a gold analyst at Deacon Barclays de Zoete
Wedd Ltd.
   Mrs. Witte wasn't born with a miner's pick in hand. Raised
on a farm in Nevada, she began studying music but soon turned
to chemistry, a subject more suited to someone she describes
as "strait-laced" as herself. A summer job as an assayer led
to graduate studies in metallurgy. After working around the
Southwest, Mrs. Witte was hired to do research for the
Canadian government and later went into business with her
husband as an independent consultant.
   Bitten by the gold bug, Mrs. Witte acquired the Colomac
deposit in the Northwest Territories in 1986. Many thought
she was asking for trouble. After all, a number of
established gold companies already had rejected Colomac
because of its remote location and low grade of ore. Still,
she managed to raise the C$150 million needed to develop a
mine at the site. With the mine partially completed in 1989,
however, Mrs. Witte's major equity backer contested her
controlling position and ultimately bought her out. It was a
bitter blow, Mrs. Witte says. Under the new management,
Colomac recently was closed down, but it had already
established Mrs. Witte's reputation as a mine financier.
   The new company, Royal Oak Mines, would be about 7% owned
by Teck Corp., a Vancouver-based mining concern.
   Mrs. Witte says being a woman in mining makes it more
difficult to get started because "you have to prove yourself.
But once you do, being a woman in this industry has been a
big plus. Everybody remembers you."
