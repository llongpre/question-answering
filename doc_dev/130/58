   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Galactic Resources Ltd.
said it agreed to acquire a number of mining and energy
investments from DCC Equities Ltd. in a move that would give
the Toronto-based merchant bank a 47% stake in Galactic.
   Galactic, which valued the transaction at about 47 million
Canadian dollars (US$40.8 million), said it will remain
primarily a gold mining concern. But it said the acquisition
of base-metal and oil and gas assets would provide a "hedge"
against weak gold prices. Galactic, based in Vancouver,
British Columbia, had a loss of C$36.7 million last year
after writing down several of its gold properties.

   DCC is 52%-owned by Dundee Capital Inc. of Toronto, with
the rest held by a few institutions. Dundee, in turn, is
controlled by mining financier Ned Goodman, its chairman and
chief executive, through direct shareholdings and through his
controlling stake in International Corona Corp., a
Vancouver-based gold producer.
   Under terms of the transaction, Galactic would issue about
50 million new shares to DCC. DCC also would invest up to C$3
million in cash in Galactic. Peter Guest, Galactic's
president and chief executive, said Galactic management would
remain in place but DCC would be invited to nominate members
to the Galactic board.
   The assets to be acquired include controlling stakes in
seven mining firms and four oil and gas producers, all in
Canada, Galactic said. It said the transaction, expected to
close in the fall, is subject to reviews by both parties and
approvals from regulators and Galactic shareholders.
   Galactic's biggest shareholder, Homestake Mining Co.,
would see its stake cut roughly in half to about 13% as a
result of the transaction, Mr. Guest said.
