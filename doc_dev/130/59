   Asamera Minerals Inc. said it discovered a gold deposit in Washington that could equal or even exceed the size of its nearby Cannon gold mine. 

   Asamera Minerals is 90%-owned by Asamera Inc., an oil and gas and mining company that recently rejected as inadequate a 456 million Canadian dollar, or 10.50 dollar-a-share ($362.8 million, or $8.35-a-share) takeover offer from Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.; Asamera said it is seeking higher bids. 

   Asamera Minerals' president, Bruce Kennedy, said the new deposit is located about two miles south of the 51%-owned Cannon mine, at Wenatchee, Wash. 
The mine is 49%-owned by Vancouver-based Breakwater Resources Ltd., which also has an interest in the new deposit. 
He said Asamera Minerals and Breakwater plan to spend $3 million over the next year to tunnel into the deposit area for additional information about reserves. 

   He said it is too early to estimate reserves at the new deposit. 

   The Cannon mine has reserves of about 4.5 million tons of ore with a grade of 0.26 ounces of gold in each ton. 
It began production in 1986 and is expected to produce about 130,000 to 140,000 ounces of gold annually for eight years. 
Asamera Minerals said it has drilled 60 holes around the new deposit, of which 42 encountered gold and silver. 

   After the announcement, Asamera Inc. closed yesterday on the American Stock Exchange at $9.50, unchanged, while Breakwater Resources closed on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 6.125 Canadian dollars, up 50 cents.
