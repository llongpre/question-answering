   Noranda Inc. said it agreed to acquire a 49% stake in North Canadian Oils Ltd. and a 38% stake in Norcen Energy Resources Ltd. from an affiliate in exchange for 34.8 million new shares. 

   Noranda is purchasing the stakes from Hees International Corp., a Toronto financial services concern. 
A Noranda spokesman said the exchange would give Hees a 20% interest in Noranda, a Toronto mining, forest products, oil and natural gas and manufacturing concern. 
Noranda currently has 146 million shares outstanding. 

   Hees and Noranda are indirectly controlled by Edper Enterprises Ltd., the holding company of Toronto financiers Edward and Peter Bronfman. 
Hees said it also agreed to sell the 20% stake in Noranda at cost to affiliate Brascan Ltd. in exchange for cash and common and preferred shares of Brascan. 
Brascan is an Edper holding company that through its 70% interest in Brascade Resources Inc. currently owns 44% of Noranda. 

   In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday Noranda closed at 22.50 Canadian dollars, down 1.25 dollars, giving the proposed transaction an indicated value of 783 million dollars ($598 million). 

   North Canadian Oils closed at 17.625 dollars, down 37.5 cents and Norcen closed at 17.625, down 25 cents, in trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
Both are Calgary, Alberta-based oil and gas concerns. 

   Noranda said it retained Wood Gundy Inc., a Toronto securities dealer, to confirm that the purchase is fair for its shareholders. 

   A Noranda spokesman said it is buying the shares in North Canadian and Norcen because it wants to expand its oil and gas interests.
