FT  21 MAY 94 / As They Say in Europe: Morality on a tight leash
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A British journalist rarely questions his or her moral framework. The chap
who sits at a table in a smart restaurant listening to a tart extracting
confessions of lust and infidelity from a leading public servant does not
spend much time pondering ethics.
In France things are different. A new three-part book - the title translates
as 'The Journalists - Stars, Scribes and Scribblers,' * - delves deep into
questions of journalistic morality.
The first part is called 'Diary of a Dog'. That is taken from the eulogy
delivered by President Mitterrand at the funeral of his one-time prime
minister, Pierre Beregovoy, who shot himself a year ago. Mitterrand spoke of
the 'dogs' who had driven Beregovoy to his death. He meant the journalists
who had investigated his interest-free loan from a leading businessman.
The writer is Jean-Francois Lacan who was once media and communications
editor at Le Monde. He has followed a professional code of such rigour that
it has led him from one disaster to another and vilification from
intellectuals and fellow hacks.
He left Le Monde in characteristic circumstances, after his investigation
into the share scandal associated with the Pechiney aluminium company, in
which Lacan had implicated Patrice Pelat. Pelat died soon after of a heart
attack and Lacan was pilloried.
Le Monde apparently thought he had behaved badly - partly because he had
smuggled his report into the paper when his editor had not been around. The
fact that Lacan was entirely right hardly mattered.
He then founded a daily called La Truffe. This consisted of short news items
exposing evil. It folded after two months, so Lacan went into television
where he worked on a programme called Bas les masques which specialised in
risque exposes.
It perished after an attack on what the French call 'Reality shows' by an
academic. It had a memorable opening: 'It is time for a political reflection
on this televisual style, instead of contenting oneself with routine sermons
on the sly tricks of the producers, the obscenity of the broadcasts and the
imbecility of the public.'
Lacan supports British ways. He tells of a conversation with a minister who
was contemplating tightening up already strict laws on privacy. The minister
himself had been under attack by the satirical weekly, Le Canard enchaine.
He told Lacan: 'I count on you to explain that I am not an enemy of the
press, but this time Le Canard has overstepped the mark.'
Some weeks later Lacan witnessed a debate between the minister and the then
chairman of the British Press Council, Lord MacGregor. 'Sure of finding an
ally in the person of the noble Lord, the minister pressed him to exhort
French journalists to respect privacy.'
'I can't help you,' said MacGregor. Smiling, he noted it was always liberals
who wanted to muzzle the press in the name of privacy. 'The difficulty, you
see, is that each press investigation into a public figure, his misdeeds,
his corruption, more or less obliges the journalist to stick his nose into
his private life.'
It may seem that French journalists are a stiff-necked lot who refuse to
dive into everyday merde. But for Lacan they are moral pygmies.
He worries about an ancient income tax benefit - a 30 per cent allowance for
so-called representational expenses - but other concerns are more important.
'Every newsroom throws up stories of motoring correspondents who have never
paid for a car, the financial reporters who benefit from insiders' networks
on the bourse, the political reporter who is compensated by the minister's
kind gift of a necklace for his wife. Spend a few days before Christmas in
editors' offices and see the accumulation of cases of fine wines,
televisions, watches or other business gifts from grateful advertisers.'
An account of a lunch with a corporate PR boss, 'Sylvie', was fascinating.
She explained how she had stitched up most of the press prior to the
announcement of some poor results. An article planted here, an interview
there and a strategic lunch would ensure there would be no 'disobliging
commentaries' once the results appeared.
All this seems somewhat overdrawn but Lacan's world is unusually dramatic.
This may be because the reputation of French journalists is no better than
that of the British among their public. But in France it may be for the
wrong reasons.
