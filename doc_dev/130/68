   Homestake Mining Co. said it agreed in principle to
acquire International Corona Corp. for shares, in a move that
would create one of North America's biggest goldmining
companies.
   Under terms of the proposal, Homestake would issue 0.35
share for each Corona share, giving the transaction an
indicated value of $395 million. Toronto's Dundee Bancorp
Inc., Corona's largest shareholder with a 30% stake, said it
agreed to accept the offer.

   The news set off frenzied activity on stock markets.
Homestake shares dropped 10%, closing Friday in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading at $13.50 each, down $1.50.
Corona shares, meanwhile, soared on the American Stock
Exchange to $4.25, up 75 cents, or 21%.
   Homestake shares were hurt by concerns about the San
Francisco company issuing new stock equal to 29.5% of its
existing share capital, analysts said. Some analysts, citing
Corona's big debt and short-term liquidity problems, thought
the Homestake bid was too high. "Homestake is trying to buy a
sizable growth in production very quickly. I don't think it's
that bad a deal. I just think they overpaid," said Marc
Cohen, of Kidder Peabody.
   Homestake has posted losses for the past two years, mainly
because of its high cost of producing gold. The company was
attracted to Corona's low-cost production and its fairly
long-life reserves, including its controlling interest in the
rich Eskay Creek gold discovery in British Columbia, said
Jonathan Williams, Homestake's secretary-treasurer. He
expects the companies' combined gold output this year will be
about 1.8 million ounces.
   Vahid Fathi, an analyst at Kemper Securities Group, said
the merger would benefit shareholders in the long term.
   Homestake, with proven and probable reserves of 13.2
million ounces of gold, would acquire 5.4 million ounces in
reserves from Corona, of Vancouver, British Columbia. Eskay
Creek, slated to begin production in 1994, is estimated to
contain an additional three million ounces.
   John Phizackerley, a Lehman Brothers analyst, said he
doesn't believe Homestake is overpaying. He values the
company's offer at $81 for each ounce of gold Corona has in
the ground, not including Eskay Creek. Even after allowing
for Corona's debt, "It's not a high price. Anything less than
$100 is a win," he said. Corona had net debt at Dec. 31 of
315 million Canadian dollars (US$263 million).
   Peter Steen, Corona president and chief executive officer,
said Corona's debt would easily be absorbed in the larger and
more conservatively financed Homestake, whose expertise with
hard-to-process ores would help in developing Eskay Creek.
