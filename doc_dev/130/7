   Royex Gold Mining Corp. said it agreed to buy about 1.1 million warrants in a Royex affiliate from Galveston Resources Ltd. for 10 million new Royex common shares and 3 million Canadian dollars ($2.3 million). 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Royex closed at 5.50 dollars, unchanged. 

   Royex said each warrant entitles it to acquire for 7 dollars one common share of International Corona Resources Ltd., in which Royex is currently a holder. 
On the Toronto exchange, Corona closed yesterday at 47.25 dollars, down 1.25 dollars. 

   Royex said the purchase would raise its stake in Corona to 42.4% from 38%, on a fully diluted basis. 
Royex and Corona, both based in Toronto, are gold mining concerns. 

   Royex said the proposed transaction is subject to approval by shareholders of Galveston, a Vancouver, British Columbia-based gold exploration concern.
