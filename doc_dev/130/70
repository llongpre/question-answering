   Placer Dome Inc. plans to sell its 24.8% fully diluted stake in Falconbridge Ltd., effectively putting Falconbridge, a big Toronto-based mining concern, into play. 

   Placer Dome's Falconbridge stake has an indicated market value of about 487.2 million Canadian dollars ($393.3 million). 
It includes about 15.6 million Falconbridge common shares held by Placer Dome and its 52.9%-owned McIntyre Mines Ltd. unit, and debentures that are convertible into about 6.2 million additional Falconbridge shares. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Falconbridge shares closed at 22.375 dollars, up 37.5 cents. 

   Fraser Fell, Placer Dome's chairman, said after the company's annual meeting yesterday that the company decided to sell its holding because it can better use proceeds to help finance its large gold mining projects, including three underway in the South Pacific. 

   Mr. Fell said that Placer Dome is "looking for one buyer" for its stake and that it has retained RBC-Dominion Securities Inc., Toronto, to advise it. 

   Mr. Fell said Placer Dome previously received one "proposal" to buy its Falconbridge block but that negotiations aren't currently taking place. 
He said Placer Dome doesn't have a deadline for selling its stake. 

   William James, president, chairman and chief executive officer of Falconbridge and a Placer Dome director, said he wasn't surprised by the decision and he doesn't expect it to affect his company's operations. 
Falconbridge, the non-communist world's second-largest nickel producer, also produces zinc, copper and precious metals. 

   Placer Dome, North America's second-largest gold producer, said after its formation through a merger last year that it expected to decide in 1988 whether it would sell the Falconbridge stake. 

   Neither Mr. Fell nor Mr. James would speculate on potential buyers of the Falconbridge shares. 
However, analysts named Vancouver, British Columbia-based Teck Corp. and Cominco Ltd., Toronto-based Noranda Inc. and Metall Mining Corp., and Outokumpu Oy of Finland as potential purchasers. 
All produce base metals such as copper, zinc or nickel. 

   "You would have to come down to a handful of (mining) companies on a world-wide basis" who are capable of buying the block, said Julian Baldry, analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Inc., Toronto. 

   Mr. Fell said he is confident the shares will be sold as a block. 
He wouldn't speculate on the possibility of a follow-up offer for the remaining Falconbridge shares. 

   Mr. Baldry said he believes the Falconbridge block won't command a premium of more than 10% to the current market price. 
Under Ontario's takeover bid regulations, this wouldn't require a follow-up offer to other holders. 

   Placer Dome is the only Falconbridge holder with more than a 5% stake.
