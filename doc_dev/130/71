   International Corona Resources Ltd. said the Supreme Court of Canada will hear an appeal Oct. 11 by LAC Minerals Ltd. that is expected finally to resolve a long court battle over ownership of a big Ontario gold mine. 

   The court decided last December to hear LAC's appeal, but until yesterday hadn't set a date. 
LAC's planned appeal follows a decision in October by the Ontario Court of Appeal to uphold a 1986 ruling that gave Corona ownership of the Page-Williams mine. 

   In its October decision, the Ontario court agreed that LAC used confidential information given to it by Corona to acquire the property where the disputed mine now operates. 
LAC developed the mine, in Hemlo, Ontario. 

   The outcome of the legal fight will significantly alter the gold output of both Toronto-based gold producers and their affiliates. 
Page-Williams is expected to become Canada's biggest gold mine.
