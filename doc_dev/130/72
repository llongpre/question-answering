   VANCOUVER, British Columbia -- Bowing to investor
concerns, International Corona Corp. amended its plan to
split into two companies.
   Separately, the company posted a second-quarter loss of
19.5 million Canadian dollars (US$17 million), or 25 Canadian
cents a share. The results were below analysts' expectations.

   The changes in its organization plan do away for the most
part with a proposed shareholder rights plan, or poison pill,
and further loosen mining financier Ned Goodman's hold on
Corona's core gold assets.
   Under terms of its previously reported restructuring
proposal, Corona would keep the gold assets, but its two
classes of stock would be replaced with a single class of
shares with equal voting rights. Holders also would get
shares in Dundee Bancorp Inc., a Corona subsidiary based in
Toronto. Corona would spin off Dundee and transfer to the
subsidiary its remaining interests in oil and gas, industrial
minerals and merchant banking.
   Dundee, which would be Corona's biggest shareholder, with
a 30% stake, would maintain a two-tier share structure that
keeps Mr. Goodman and others firmly in control of voting
rights. Given the controlling block held by Dundee, investors
had objected to Corona also enacting a poison pill, a Corona
spokesman said.
   Under the amended terms, Corona would put a poison pill
into place but only for a transition period ending next
April. The poison pill would be reinstated if Dundee or
another major shareholder failed to maintain at least a 20%
equity stake.
   Corona's second-quarter loss followed year-earlier profit
of C$4.6 million, or four Canadian cents a share. The company
had a one-time pretax charge of C$23.3 million in the latest
quarter from the write-down of its investment in Breakwater
Resources Ltd.
   Corona shares closed at $7.50, unchanged, on the American
Stock Exchange.
