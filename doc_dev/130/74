   Corona Corp. said it ended negotiations to acquire a controlling interest in Bond International Gold Inc. and exercised its right to sell a recently acquired 7% interest in the company. 

   Corona, a major Toronto gold producer, acquired the interest in June for about $30 million, with an option to increase its stake by a further 20% under an agreement with Dallhold Investments Pty. 
Ltd. Dallhold, Bond International's controlling shareholder, is the family holding company of Australian financier Allan Bond, who is also Bond International's chairman. 

   Corona said the companies couldn't agree on a price for a controlling interest in the company. 
In a statement, Peter Steen, Corona's president and chief executive, said: "After not being able to reach an amicable and mutually acceptable price agreement on purchase of control, Corona decided to eliminate its position." 
He said "a minority share investment in Bond International Gold was never in our plans." 

   Corona and Bond International officials declined to comment on the price Bond was seeking for the interest. 

   Under terms of the agreement, Corona said it will sell its 7% stake to Bell Resources Ltd. of Australia, a company associated with Mr. Bond. 
The holdings consist of about four million Bond International ordinary shares and 800,000 ordinary-share purchase warrants, which will be sold at the acquisition price of $7.25 per share and $1 per warrant plus carrying charges. 

   Bond International, which has interests in 11 mines in several countries, produced about 500,000 ounces of gold in its fiscal year ended June 30. 
Corona forecast 1989 gold production at about 635,000 ounces.
