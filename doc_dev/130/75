   Total Resources (Canada) Ltd., a unit of the oil concern Total Cie. Francaise des Petroles of Paris, said it has raised to 148.5 million Canadian dollars ($115.5 million), or 11 dollars a share, its bid for Getty Resources Ltd. 

   As previously reported, Total Resources had been offering 10 dollars a share for Getty, a gold-mine development company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. 

   Total Resources said it will conduct the offer through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange on a date still to be decided. 
Its 10-dollar-a-share offer was to have taken place yesterday. 

   Getty directors, officers and shareholders have agreed to tender a total of 3,655,080 shares, Total Resources said. 
Getty's board has also recommended that shareholders accept the amended offer, Total Resources said. 

   Getty has about 9.5 million shares outstanding and warrants that could be exercised to create a further four million shares. 
After the disclosure of the higher bid, Getty's stock closed yesterday on the Toronto exchange at 10.875 dollars, up 62.5 cents. 

   Total Resources said the offer is only being made in Canada and isn't being made to U.S. residents or citizens. 
It said its 55%-owned mining and oil and gas subsidiary, Total Erickson Resources Ltd. of Vancouver, held 11.6% of Getty's stock as of Dec. 23.
