   Noranda Inc. and its partners in a big Ontario gold mine sold $235.4 (Canadian) million of shares in the mine to underwriters for resale to the public in Canada and Europe. 

   Alf Powis, chairman and chief executive officer of Noranda, said the 12,226,666 shares made up 14% of the shares in Hemlo Gold Mines Inc., a recently formed company that owns the Golden Giant Mine near Hemlo, Ontario. 

   The sale leaves Noranda with 50.1% of Hemlo Gold Mines. 
Other holders are Goliath Gold Mines Ltd., Golden Sceptre Resources Ltd. and the principals Hemglo Resources Ltd. 

   Golden Giant is one of the largest and lowest cost gold mines in North America. 
Mr. Powis projected this year's output at about 300,000 ounces of gold. 

   Noranda is a resources and manufacturing company. 
Goliath and Golden Sceptre are Vancouver-based companies whose main assets are their stakes in the mine. 
Hemglo is owned by the families of some of the prospectors and investors who helped explore the Hemlo deposit. 

   Shares of Hemlo Gold Mines were approved for trading yesterday by securities commissions of Ontario and Quebec, and Mr. Powis said approval is expected soon in British Columbia. 

   The shares were sold to underwriters for resale at $19.25 each. 
After commissions, Mr. Powis said, Noranda would receive $197.5 million, which it will use to reduce debt. 
The other partners will receive about $26.1 million. 

   The four underwriters are led by Burns Fry Ltd. in Canada and S.G. Warburg &amp; Co. in Europe. 

   Mr. Powis said Hemlo Gold Mines has 87.6 million shares outstanding. 
At $19.25 a share, the company has an indicated value of $1.69 billion.
