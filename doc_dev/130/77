   Corona Corp. restated its second-quarter earnings to include profits from the Page-Williams gold mine, which was awarded to Corona earlier this month after an eight-year legal battle. 

   Corona said it is in the process of restating earnings from previous years to reflect the 40.5 million Canadian dollars ($34.4 million) in profit from the mine that has been held in trust pending the court decision. 
The entire amount will be reflected on the company's 1989 balance sheet as retained earnings, Corona said. 

   As part of the legal settlement, Corona must pay LAC Minerals Ltd. C$107 million for past development costs. 
The company said the C$40.5 million, which it received Wednesday, will be used toward paying that amount. 

   For the latest second quarter, the company had restated net income of C$13.9 million, or nine Canadian cents a share, on revenue of C$80 million, up from C$9.2 million, or six cents a share, on revenue of C$51.6 million before the restatement. 

   Toronto-based Corona is a gold producer. 
The Page-Williams mine, in Hemlo, Ontario, is considered Canada's richest gold mine.
