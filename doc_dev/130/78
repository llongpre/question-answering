   Total Resources (Canada) Ltd., a unit of Total Cie. Francaise des Petroles of Paris, launched a bid it valued at 135 million Canadian dollars ($103.3 million) for Getty Resources Ltd., a gold mine development company based in Vancouver, British Columbia. 

   Richard Atkinson, president of Getty Resources, termed the offer a "surprise." 
He said the company expects to decide by Jan. 5 whether to recommend acceptance or rejection of the bid. 

   Total Resources, an oil and gas concern, said it will pay 10 dollars a share for Getty's stock through the facilities of the Toronto Stock Exchange on Jan. 11. 
Mr. Atkinson said Getty has about 9.5 million shares outstanding and warrants that could be exercised to create an additional four million shares. 
On Thursday, after the offer was announced, Getty shares closed on the Toronto exchange at 9.875 dollars, up 2.25 dollars. 

   Total Canada said the offer is only being made in Canada and isn't being made to residents, nationals or citizens of the U.S. 
The company said its 55%-owned mining and oil-and-gas subsidiary, Total Erickson Resources Ltd. of Vancouver, already holds 11.6% of Getty's stock. 

   Total Erickson has been granted an option to acquire from Total Canada at 10 dollars a share all the common shares of Getty that Total Canada obtains under its offer. 
Total Canada said the option, which ends on May 31, 1988, would require Total Erickson to repay Total Canada for all costs and expenses involved in the offer.
