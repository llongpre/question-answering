   Rayrock Yellowknife Resources Inc. said it plans to build a gold mine at its 23.3%-owned Marigold property in Nevada at a cost of at least 30 million Canadian dollars ($24.1 million). 

   The Toronto gold mining and energy concern said it expects the mine to begin production in early 1989. 
It forecasts annual output of 55,000 to 60,000 ounces, and it said reserves are adequate to support production for 10 years. 

   Rayrock's partners include Santa Fe Pacific Mining Inc., which holds a 30% interest, Lacana Mining Corp., with 23.3%, and a unit of Placer Dome Inc., with 23.3%. 
Lacana and Placer Dome are Toronto goldmining concerns. 
Santa Fe Pacific is a unit of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., Chicago, a railroad and energy concern. 

   In trading yesterday on the Toronto Stock Exchange, Rayrock closed at 9.625 dollars, unchanged.
