HOMESTAKE Mining of San Francisco is to merge with Canada's International
Corona to create one of the biggest gold producers outside South Africa.
The two companies said yesterday that they had agreed in principle to a
'business combination' in which Homestake would offer Corona shareholders
0.35 of a Homestake share for each of Corona's 83m common shares.
The merger values Corona at about USDollars 400m, with Homestake shares
trading yesterday at USDollars 14 (down Dollars 1) on the New York Stock
Exchange following the announcement of the deal. Corona's shares jumped 85
cents to CDollars 5 (USDollars 4.23) on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Dundee Bancorp, Corona's controlling shareholder, has agreed to tender its
shares to Homestake.
The combined company expects to produce 1.8m ounces of gold this year from
mines in the US, Canada and Australia. Its reserves will total about 20m
ounces.
Corona's main assets are its low-cost mines in the Hemlo gold field in
north-western Ontario and the recently discovered Eskay Creek deposit in
British Columbia.
In spite of its valuable properties, Corona has been strained in recent
years by the sliding gold price and its heavy debt. It suffered a loss of
CDollars 13.3m in the first nine months of last year.
Corona also requires financing to develop the Eskay Creek property. In
addition, Homestake has gained both technical and environmental experience
at its operations in California which will be useful in the Eskay Creek
project.
On the other hand, Homestake has lacked the long-life, low-cost mines which
Corona will bring to the deal.
Prior to the deal with Homestake, Corona was in the midst of plans to
restructure its CDollars 323m debt, including proposals for a share issue.
