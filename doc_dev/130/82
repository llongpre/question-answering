   A group including Noranda Inc. bought a 9.8% stake in Granges Exploration Ltd. 

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the group said it bought 2,239,000 Granges common shares in the open market Sept. 16 for about 9.1 million Canadian dollars (US$7.4 million). 

   The group said it bought the stake "as an equity investment to enhance its position in the gold-mining industry," and may raise or reduce its interest in the Vancouver, British Columbia, gold producer. 

   The group includes Hemlo Gold Mines Inc., which is 50.1%-owned by Noranda, and Edper Enterprises Inc., a closely held investment concern controlled by Toronto financiers Edward and Peter Bronfman. 
Edper controls Noranda, a large resource and manufacturing concern. 

   Alfred Powis, Noranda's chairman and chief executive officer, said the group sees Granges as an attractively priced gold stock. 
Hemlo Gold officials weren't immediately available for comment. 

   On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Granges closed at C$3.85, up five cents for the day and 50 cents above its 12-month low of C$3.35.
