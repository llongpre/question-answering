   Hanson PLC, Britain's largest industrial conglomerate, posted a robust 19% advance in fiscal third-quarter pretax profit and announced its first asset sale of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC since acquiring control of the mining group last week. 

   Chairman Lord Hanson said the company reported "good progress" in both its British and U.S. operations. 
"This augurs well for the balance of the year and indeed, for the future," he said. 

   For the three months ended June 30, profit before tax rose to #295 million ($466.4 million) from #249 million a year earlier. 
Singled out for their strong performances were Hanson's chemicals and cranes businesses in the U.S. 

   For the nine months, pretax profit rose 23% to #742 million from #605 million a year ago. 

   Hanson also announced that a 30% stake in Gold Fields South Africa held by Consolidated Gold was sold for #368 million to Rembrandt Group Ltd. and Asteroid Pty Ltd., a company jointly owned by Gold Fields South Africa and Driefontein Consolidated Ltd. 
The transaction leaves Consolidated Gold with an 8% share in Gold Fields South Africa. 

   Hanson shares yesterday closed at 241 ($3.81), up half a penny, on the London Stock Exchange. 
Volume amounted to nearly four million shares. 

   Hanson's #3.5 billion ($5.53 billion) offer for Consolidated Gold was the largest takeover bid to succeed in the United Kingdom. 
The Hanson victory brought to an end a nearly yearlong struggle for control of the mining house. 

   Hanson, famous for trans-Atlantic acquisitions and breakups, is expected to recoup its purchase price by dismembering much of Consolidated Gold, the biggest gold-mining concern outside South Africa. 
Hanson likely will sell nearly all the company's far-flung mining operations and at least the U.S. half of ARC, a building-materials business that is Consolidated Gold's biggest moneymaker. 

   As a result, Minorco S.A. may acquire the operations it coveted during its unsuccessful, eight-month fight for Consolidated Gold. 
A person close to Hanson suggested the conglomerate might sell to Minorco both the U.S. operations of ARC and Gold Fields Mining Corp., a U.S. unit. 

   Minorco, controlled by a South African industrial empire, is receiving $1.6 billion from the sale of its 29.9% stake to Hanson. 
"In due course, we will do some acquisitions" with the money, Sir Michael Edwardes, Minorco's chief executive, said in a phone interview yesterday. 
Minorco and Hanson probably will begin negotiations within 10 days, others close to the companies said. 

   Several major buildings-materials concerns also might bid for the U.S. gravel and pebble business, analysts said. 
Among them: Vulcan Materials Co., based in Birmingham, Ala.; and Beazer PLC and Tarmac PLC of Britain. 
Last year, Beazer took over U.S.-based Koppers Co. after a fierce battle. 

   American Barrick Resources Corp. of Canada has expressed interest in both Gold Fields Mining and Consolidated Gold's 49.3% stake in Newmont Mining Corp., the biggest U.S. gold-mining company. 
Placer Dome Inc. of Canada also has told Hanson that it would make a bid for Consolidated Gold's North American gold assets if they became available, a person close to Placer Dome said last month.
