   American Barrick Resources Corp. and Newmont Mining Corp.
said they are discussing a possible merger, a move that would
create North America's largest gold producer and resolve some
of each company's lingering production problems.
   Under terms of the proposal, which has an indicated value
of $2.48 billion, Toronto-based American Barrick would
exchange 1.8 of its shares for each share in Denver-based
Newmont Mining, which has as its main asset a 90.1% stake in
Newmont Gold Co. of Denver. The companies said "a number of
substantive issues" need to be worked out before the merger
could be completed.

   Under the terms outlined, Sir James Goldsmith's 49% stake
in Newmont Mining would become a 23% stake in the combined
company. Sir James acquired his Newmont shares from Hanson
PLC last year for $1.3 billion, or $39.15 a share. The merger
ratio indicates a price of $36.68 for each Newmont Mining
share, leaving Sir James with a loss on his position. Some
traders believe, however, that the greater market
capitalization of the combined company would make it easier
for the Anglo-French financier to sell his stake on the open
market.
   Meanwhile, Horsham Corp., controlled by Toronto financier
Peter Munk, would see its 21% stake in American Barrick
reduced to 11%.
   American Barrick and Newmont are considered among the
healthiest of North American gold companies. Both companies
have grown rapidly in the past decade based on significant
gold reserves they hold in Nevada's Carlin Trend, thought to
be the world's largest gold deposit outside of South Africa.
   The two companies mine gold on adjacent properties and so
share water, wastemanagement and other environmental
problems. They also share the undeveloped Post deposit in the
Carlin trend but have been unable to agree on how to develop
a mine at the site.
   "The area can be better developed if it can be done
jointly by both companies," said Gregory Wilkins, chief
financial officer for American Barrick. He said the companies
disclosed the merger discussions, which have been going on
for months, after a report about the talks appeared in a
British newspaper.
   In a merger, both companies also could benefit from each
other's technologies for treating refractory ores, or ores
from which gold can't be recovered by today's cyanide
heap-leaching processes.
   Newmont has developed bio-leaching, using bacterial
agents, for treating lowgrade refractory ores. American
Barrick, meanwhile, has pioneered the use of an autoclave for
high-grade ores. Similar to a large pressure cooker,
autoclaving has some environmental advantages over
conventional ore-roasting techniques.
   "After years of being each other's next-door neighbors,
they've realized certain things are more advantageous if done
together," said Marc Cohen, an analyst at Kidder Peabody in
New York. "It's sort of like marrying the girl next door."
   Analysts said it wasn't clear who would run the merged
company. Both companies' management are well-regarded.
American Barrick wouldn't comment on a new management
structure and a Newmont official declined to elaborate on the
company's news release.
   The companies said in a statement that the merger also
could include Newmont Gold. In this case, Newmont Mining said
it would want American Barrick to acquire the 9.9% stake in
Newmont Gold held by the public.
   Newmont Gold produced 1.7 million ounces of gold last
year, compared with American Barrick's output of 353,000
ounces. But an expansion plan at Barrick's Goldstrike mine in
Nevada promises to boost the company's production to above 1
million ounces by 1992.
   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
American Barrick shares closed yesterday at $20.375, up $1;
Newmont Mining shares finished at $36.125, up $2.75; and
Newmont Gold shares closed at $37.375, up $3.25.
