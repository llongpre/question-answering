   Hemlo Gold Mines Inc. of Toronto said it agreed to acquire
all the gold assets of Noranda Inc. in exchange for 8,611,410
Hemlo common shares, which the companies valued at 80 million
Canadian dollars (US$70 million), or C$9.29 (US$8.13) a
share.
   Hemlo also agreed to pay to Noranda a royalty of up to
C$10 million, to be based on additional reserves at the gold
properties and changes in the price of gold.

   The gold assets include Noranda's joint venture interest
in the Holloway property in Ontario, its equity interests in
Freewest Resources Inc. and Crown Butte Resources Ltd., and
about 290 gold exploration properties.
   Noranda, based in Toronto, also has interests in forest
products and oil and gas. It is Hemlo's largest shareholder,
with a 51% interest. This transaction would increase its
holding to about 61%. On the Toronto Stock Exchange Friday,
Hemlo stock closed unchanged at C$10 a share. Noranda closed
at C$19.875 a share, off 12.5 Canadian cents.
   The transaction is expected to be completed by early July.
