   American Barrick Resources Corp. and Newmont Mining Corp.
have called off a proposed $2.8 billion merger, driving down
shares in the two gold mining concerns.
   Neither side would say exactly what scuttled the talks.
Toronto-based American Barrick said the companies weren't
able to resolve certain "substantive" issues between them.
Newmont Mining, based in Denver, said the deal fell apart
when it became apparent that most of the advantages of
merging could come instead from "mutual cooperation" in their
adjacent mining operations.

   American Barrick and Newmont share ownership of the Post
ore deposit, located in Nevada's rich Carlin trend, but they
haven't been able to agree on a plan to develop the zone. The
companies said they will continue to hold talks about forming
a joint venture to develop the orebody.
   In late trading on the New York Stock Exchange, American
Barrick shares were quoted yesterday at $22.375, down $1.125;
Newmont Mining shares were quoted at $39.625, down $2.25.
Shares in Newmont Gold Co. of Denver, which is 90.1% owned by
Newmont Mining, were quoted at $39.625, down $2.25.
   Analysts generally were surprised by the collapse of the
merger talks. "The market was saying the deal made sense,"
said Barry Allan of Deacon Barclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd. in
Toronto.
   In particular, analysts widely believed that Sir James
Goldsmith, who owns 49% of Newmont Mining, was enthusiastic
about merging with American Barrick, which has more
aggressively expanded its reserves and hedged its risk to
future gold prices. American Barrick Chairman Peter Munk, who
indirectly controls 21% of the company, also was thought to
support the deal.
   In a related matter, Newmont said that Sir James will join
the company's board and, if other directors approve, will
head a proposed Corporate Strategy Committee. The
responsibilities of the committee weren't disclosed, but
Newmont said its purpose would be "to enhance further the
company's growth." Newmont said it had extended a
"longstanding invitation" to the Anglo-French financier to
join its board. Sir James couldn't be reached to comment.
   Alan Gaines, president of Gaines, Berland, a New York
investment firm, said that the merger proposal didn't please
directors at Newmont. Under terms of the deal, American
Barrick would have issued 1.8 of its shares for every Newmont
Mining share. According to Mr. Gaines, Newmont directors
didn't feel this provided any premium for their shares. "I
would assume the board of directors of Newmont balked at
selling out at no premium to the company that had always been
regarded by Newmont as an upstart," he said.
   Meanwhile, as the development of the Post deposit remains
uncertain, American Barrick executives have begun to downplay
the importance of the 10 million-ounce deposit to the
company's future growth. Robert Smith, president and chief
operating officer, suggested in a recent interview that
American Barrick's vast Goldstrike mine in Nevada, which is
rapidly being expanded, could contain as much as 25% more
gold than originally believed. Because of higher ore grade
and greater efficiencies, he said, American Barrick now
expects to produce "well above" 700,000 ounces of gold this
year, compared with its previous forecast of 625,000 ounces.
Last year, the company produced 596,000 ounces.
   Mr. Smith also revealed that American Barrick plans to
bring its high-grade Purple Vein deposit into production by
1995. The deposit, in which the company so far has outlined
five million ounces of indicated gold reserves, will add some
400,000 ounces a year to the company's total output, he said.
