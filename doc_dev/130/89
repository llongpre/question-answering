   Galactic Resources Ltd. said it plans two financings to raise as much as $55 million (Canadian). 
It also plans to combine with another mining company, with the amalgamated concern to be called Galactic Gold Corp. 

   Robert Friedland, chairman of Galactic Resources, said one financing involves an issue of convertible, subordinated debentures in Switzerland, to raise 50 million Swiss francs, equivalent to $43 million (Canadian). 

   The other financing involves a private placement of as many as 1.5 million common shares at $8 each, to raise $12 million. 
Included with each share would be a non-transferrable warrant entitling the holder to purchase an additional share for $8.80 within one year. 
Galactic Resources currently has about 22.5 million shares outstanding. 

   Proceeds of the Swiss offering would be used to finance a gold mine in South Carolina, to pay down bank debt on a mine in Colorado, and for general corporate purposes, Mr. Friedland said. 
The private placement proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes. 

   Mr. Friedland said Galactic Resources has reached an agreement with a "major French and Swiss banking group" regarding the Swiss offering. 
Members of the group weren't disclosed. 
Final details of the offering are expected by April 28. 

   The private placement involves an agreement with Vancouver-based Majendie Securities Ltd., which will offer the stock to Canadian and European financial institutions, Mr. Friedland said. 
The financings are both subject to regulatory approval. 

   Mr. Friedland said Galactic Resources has concluded a letter of agreement with Quartz Mountain Gold Corp. under which shareholders of each company would swap stock for a stake in Galactic Gold. 
Each Galactic Resources share would be exchangeable for one Galactic Gold share and each Quartz share would be exchangeable for 0.45 of a Galactic Gold share. 
Quartz, which owns a gold deposit in Oregon, has about 14 million shares outstanding.
