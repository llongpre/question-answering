   Galveston Resources Ltd., a gold exploration concern, plans a $40 million (Canadian) bond offering and a $20 million equity offering, Murray Pezim, chairman, said. 

   Proceeds will be used for general purposes, "possibly including the purchase of securities of certain gold mining companies," Mr. Pezim said. 

   He declined to say if he would use the funds to purchase stock of International Corona Resources Ltd., a Toronto-based gold mining concern. 
As previously reported, Mr. Pezim is seeking to replace Corona's board. 

   Interest on the bonds will be paid semi-annually in shares of Corona from Galveston's holdings of the stock, Mr. Pezim said. 
Based on a price of $40 a Corona share, the interest payment would be 10%, he said. 
On the Toronto Stock Exchange, Corona closed yesterday at $41, down 75 cents. 

   Mr. Pezim said the payout of Corona shares wouldn't hurt his corporate fight because he expects the battle to be completed within six months. 
He declined to disclose the number of Corona shares held by Galveston, but said it was sufficient to cover the interest payments. 

   The Galveston bonds will have a three-year maturity and will be convertible into Galveston common shares at $40 a share, the company said. 
The offer is subject to regulatory approval. 
Agents are Midland Doherty Ltd. and Maison Placements Canada Inc. 

   The equity issue involves one million shares and one million warrants, to be offered in units of one share and one warrant at $20 each, Galveston said. 
Each warrant allows the holder to purchase an additional share for $22 within two years. 

   Galveston currently has about 7.7 million shares outstanding, of which about 1.6 million are held by Mr. Pezim. 
The shares closed yesterday at $25 on the Toronto Stock Exchange, down 12.5 cents. 
Corona, which has about 21.5 million shares outstanding, is 38%-owned by Royex Gold Mining Corp., Toronto.
