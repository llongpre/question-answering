   Murray Pezim sure knows how to wake up a shareholders meeting. 

   The flamboyant Vancouver stock promoter stalked out of the annual meeting of International Corona Resources Ltd. yesterday, summoned reporters and television cameramen, and declared that he planned to take over the company, of which he is vice chairman. 

   Mr. Pezim helped found the gold mining concern, but his stake has dwindled. 
He called the company "my baby" and said he wanted it back. 
He said he and associates controlled about six million of the company's 21.5 million common shares and would buy more on the open market. 

   Mr. Pezim later telephoned the Toronto Stock Exchange to say he really wasn't planning a takeover bid. 
He told a reporter he had spoken in a fit of anger brought on by the failure of two associates to win reelection to the International Corona board. 

   International Corona rose to $38.25 (Canadian) immediately after Mr. Pezim's first encounter with reporters, but closed at $36.25, up 75 cents, in trading on the Toronto exchange.
