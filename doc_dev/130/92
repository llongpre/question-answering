Amid the Latest Surge in Investor Interest

   Some mutual fund experts are concerned about what will happen when the latest gold rush fades away. 

   About $12.2 billion was invested in gold-stock funds as of June 30, and the total has probably grown even larger since then, aided by gold funds' average return of more than 19% this past quarter. 
But both gold funds -- and their investors -- are a notoriously volatile lot. 

   "Gold fund shareholders come in two groups: the policy investors and the performance junkies," says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc. 
He and others worry that the "junkies" could stampede if the market turns against them. 

   The long-term record shows that erratic performance is the norm for gold funds. 
They're "very biblical," muses George A. Roche, president of T. Rowe Price Associates' New Era Fund. 
"The first shall be last and the last shall be first. 
They don't go to the middle." 

   Mr. Roche says his fund is a "a very nervous holder" of gold-mining stocks, with 15% of New Era's assets in such issues. 

   One of the things that has Mr. Roche -- and others -- on edge is the fat premium that gold stocks have in excess of the metal's price. 
Run-ups in gold-mining shares often precede bullion price gains, but the current gap is unusually large. 

   During the third quarter, bullion itself rose only 0.7% while an index of gold-mining stocks compiled by Morgan Stanley Capital International jumped nearly 13%. 
For the nine months, the index out-shined the metal's gain by nearly 70%. 

   The magnitude of that discrepancy "is one of the things that bothers me," says Andre Sharon, managing director of Simms Capital Management Ltd. and a long-time gold follower. 

   Mr. Sharon, who calls the sector shots for the Blanchard Strategic Growth Fund, recently trimmed the precious-metals component of that asset allocation fund to 18% from 23%. 

   But Mr. Roche is holding tight to the gold tinge on the $1 billion New Era Fund, which specializes in natural resource issues. 
While nervous, he ties his holdings largely to his expectations for the dollar. 
He figures "the dollar is weak and will continue to be weak." 
That should be bullish for gold, he argues. 

   Concern over the gap between the gold and gold-mining stock prices caused Peter C. Cavelti to recently increase holdings in gold bullion for the precious-metals funds run by Cavelti Capital Management Ltd., Toronto. 
His funds recently increased their average holding of physical gold to 30% of assets. 
That's up from 10% in mid-1985, when they moved aggressively into the mining shares. 

   Now Mr. Cavelti believes the mining stocks have already appreciated to a level that takes into account a gold price of $550 to $600 an ounce. 
But in Friday's trading on the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold closed at just $454.50 an ounce. 
Mr. Cavelti holds that the stock prices are way ahead of themselves and will retreat, but should then rise again. 

   If he's right, gold funds may be in for some rocky times ahead, particularly if they don't hold much physical metal as ballast. 
The average range of bullion holdings among the funds that can actually buy the metal is thought to be 5% to 30%. 

   Many of the funds that are limited to just stocks often tie their fortunes to one of the three major geographic gold areas: Canada, North America and Australia. 
The Australian shares were helped along by currency factors this year; U.S. and Canadian shares remained strong, and South African issues have been gaining strength after about two years of lagging the competing issues. 

   The gold funds have had more than their share of volatility this year, both in terms of price and shareholder movement. 
Consider the ebb and flow of Fidelity Investment's gold sector funds. 

   Fidelity Select Precious Metals, with a heavy weighting in South African and Australian gold-mining issues ended the quarter with about $591 million in assets and a gain of 21%. 
Fidelity Select American Gold, which is weighted in U.S. and Canadian stocks, finished the period with about $400 million in assets and a gain of 22%. 
Like several of the gold funds, Fidelity Select American Gold got an extra kick from Newmont Mining Corp., which zoomed on takeover activity. 
But both Fidelity sector funds saw assets run up sharply from March to April when bullion jumped. 
It fell back sharply in June when the metal slumped and then recovered again on the metal's rise. 

   The Fidelity gold funds are thought to be used often by people with a trader's bent. 

   Yet even the more traditional gold funds have a volatile history and a variety of portfolio mixes. 
Keeping track of them isn't easy. 
In the past five years, the number of gold funds has more than tripled to 24 and their assets have ebbed and flowed along with gold prices. 
The funds ended 1982 with some $868 million in assets. 
They grew to $12.2 billion at June 30 -- but not before several ups and downs in between. 

   Still, for investors with the stomach for sharp periodic swings or the mindset that some gold holdings are a safe haven against economic wastelands, the gold funds have paid off handsomely. 
For the 10 years ended last Wednesday, the gold funds gained 718%, markedly outpacing the nearest rival group, global funds.
