   Total Erickson Resources Ltd., 52%-owned by Total Resources (Canada) Ltd., said it has tentatively agreed to merge with Getty Resources Ltd., a wholly owned unit of Total Resources. 

   Total Resources Canada, itself a unit of Paris-based Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles, would own 71% of the stock of the merged company. 

   The transaction has a value of about $89.7 million, based on yesterday's bid price of $2.5625 a share in over-the-counter trading of Total Erickson, which has about 35 million shares outstanding. 

   Under the merger accord, Getty Resources would issue one share from its treasury for each 2.8 shares of Total Erickson. 
After the transaction Getty would have about 26 million shares outstanding, of which about 12.5 million would have been issued to holders of Total Erickson, a gold mining and oil and gas concern. 

   The merged company would change its name to Totalcorp to reflect its affiliation with the Total Group of companies. 
Getty Resources' main asset is a 49% stake in the Tundra gold prospect in Canada's Northwest Territories. 

   Separately, Total Petroleum Ltd. of Denver said it hired Chemical Bank to help it sell its U.S. oil and gas properties. 

   The oil and gas concern, 51%-owned by Total Compagnie Francaise, said it will sell the properties to concentrate on its Canadian oil and gas operations and its U.S. refining and marketing business. 

   The company has about 22 million barrels of oil equivalent in proven reserves in the U.S., or about 23% of its total North American proven reserves.
