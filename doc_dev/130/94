   TORONTO -- While other big gold miners face flat
production for several years to come, American Barrick
Resources Corp. said a new mine will ensure the company's
gold output will continue to grow for the next decade.
   Meanwhile, American Barrick reported net income rose 59%
in the fourth quarter to US$24.1 million, or 18 cents a
share, from $15.1 million, or 12 cents a share, a year
earlier. Revenue of $89.1 million was up 24%. The company
said its improved results mainly were due to increased
production and lower operating costs.

   American Barrick said its Miekle mine, which contains some
$1.6 billion in gold, will produce about 400,000 ounces of
gold a year beginning in late 1995, ranking it among North
America's top five gold mines. The mine, previously known as
the Purple Vein deposit, also will have one of the industry's
lowest cost structures, partly because it can use the
existing processing plant at American Barrick's nearby
Goldstrike mine in Nevada.
   News of the Miekle mine plan follows American Barrick's
agreement last week with Newmont Gold Co., a subsidiary of
Denver's Newmont Mining Corp., to jointly mine the Post
deposit, a big orebody that straddles both companies'
properties in Nevada. American Barrick said production from
the Miekle and Post deposits should boost the Toronto
company's total annual production to about 2 million ounces
of gold by the end of the decade from an estimated 1.2
million ounces this year. Last year, the company produced
790,000 ounces of gold.
   Investors bid up American Barrick stock following the news
that production will continue to grow. On the New York Stock
Exchange the shares were quoted late yesterday at $28.75, up
$1.25.
   In contrast to American Barrick's expectations of sharply
higher gold production, most other North American gold mining
companies are expected to have flat or declining output in
coming years. For one thing, many of the mines that fueled
the gold production boom of the 1980s are almost depleted
now, and new deposits are frequently more expensive to
exploit.
   "The significant growth for the industry as a whole is
behind us. There are very few {companies} besides American
Barrick that are expected to show continued growth in the
coming decade," said Vahid Fathi, an analyst at Kemper
Securities Group in Cleveland.
   The industry slowdown has intensified the competition for
good mining assets and has resulted in some missteps. This
week, for instance, Placer Dome Inc. said it will write off
its big Mount Milligan coppergold property in British
Columbia because the deposit wasn't economic to develop.
Placer Dome, a mining concern based in Vancouver, British
Columbia, said it hadn't had enough time to properly evaluate
the deposit before buying it for some 250 million Canadian
dollars (US$211.7 million) last year.
   American Barrick also is sensitive to the limits of
finding new gold in the ground and said it expects to further
build up its reserves through acquisitions. "With our
financial strength, we can take advantage of the
opportunities that we believe will develop through
consolidation in the gold industry," said Gregory Wilkins,
American Barrick's chief financial officer.
   The company's reserves of gold at the end of last year
were 24.4 million ounces, up sharply from 19.5 million a year
earlier, mainly because of including reserves at the planned
Miekle mine. At expected rates of production, it would take
American Barrick some 15 years to deplete its reserves. Only
Newmont Gold, North America's biggest gold producer, has a
similarly long reserve life, Mr. Fathi said.
