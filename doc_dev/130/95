   Galactic Resources Ltd. said Mesa Limited Partnership agreed to lend one of its units as much as $30 million. 

   The gold mining concern's Galactic Holdings Inc. unit has been granted an option by Mesa to acquire 10% of Ivanhoe Partners, which is 45%-owned by Mesa, an Amarillo, Texas-based oil and gas partnership led by T. Boone Pickens Jr. 

   As previously reported, Ivanhoe Partners recently disclosed that it acquired a 9.1% interest in Newmont Mining Corp., a New York-based concern with interests in gold, coal, and oil and gas. 

   Galactic also has agreed to sell Mesa three-year warrants to acquire as many as 500,000 of Galactic's common shares at an initial price of $11.32 a share. 
Galactic currently has 18.2 million common shares outstanding. 
In trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, its stock closed at 15.25 Canadian dollars ($11.48), up 37.5 cents.
