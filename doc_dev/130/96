   LAC Minerals Ltd., Toronto, said it plans to seek permission to appeal for the second time a court ruling that requires LAC to hand over its biggest gold mine to International Corona Resources Ltd. 

   An Ontario Court of Appeal last week dismissed LAC's first appeal and upheld a March 1986 finding of the Supreme Court of Ontario that awarded the disputed Page-Williams mine to International Corona Resources. 
Both companies are Toronto-based mining concerns. 

   LAC said it told its lawyers to seek a further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. 
The company didn't elaborate. 

   Corona said it had expected LAC to seek another appeal. 
It also said it expects this week to pay LAC 154 million Canadian dollars ($117.8 million), as required by the court, to help LAC cover costs incurred in developing the mine. 

   As previously reported, LAC must hand over the mine after receiving the funds, unless it can obtain a court order deferring the transfer.
