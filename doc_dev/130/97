   Noranda Inc. said it may offer to acquire Placer Dome Inc.'s stake in Falconbridge Ltd., joining Falconbridge itself as a possible bidder for the shares. 

   "We're interested in buying, but it's a question of price," said Alan Thomas, Noranda's senior vice president, finance. 
Placer Dome, a Toronto-based gold-mining concern, controls a 24.7% fully diluted stake in Falconbridge, a large copper, nickel and zinc producer here. 
The block, which Placer Dome put up for sale last month, has an indicated market value of about 591.3 million Canadian dollars (US$488.4 million) and is expected to attract several bidders. 

   In active Toronto Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Falconbridge closed at C$26.25 a share, down 25 cents. 

   Mr. Thomas wouldn't say whether Noranda, a forest products, oil and gas, mining and manufacturing concern in Toronto, would seek control of Falconbridge. 
Noranda filed a request with the Ontario Securities Commission for an exemption from certain takeover-bid regulations that could require it to make a follow-up offer to Falconbridge's minority shareholders. 

   The OSC scheduled hearings on Noranda's application and a similar request by Falconbridge for next Tuesday, a day before Placer Dome's deadline for bids. 
Placer Dome extended its deadline for offers from yesterday to allow time for the hearings. 

   Falconbridge announced Tuesday some details of its proposed bid, which would require OSC approval to proceed. 
As reported, Falconbridge said its offer would include a special dividend to holders other than Placer Dome and would ensure that minority holders receive value for their shares equal to that received by Placer Dome. 

   A Placer Dome official said the company is concerned that the OSC hearings and delay of the bidding deadline could dissuade other would-be bidders from proceeding. 
He didn't offer specifics. 

   Neither Falconbridge nor Noranda disclosed specific monetary terms of their proposed bids. 

   Separately, Vancouver-based Cominco Ltd., a lead and zinc producer, said it won't bid for the Falconbridge block. 
It had been rumored that Cominco might consider a joint offer, possibly with Toronto-based Metall Mining Corp., Vancouver's Teck Corp. or Australia's M.I.M. Holdings Ltd.
