   Galactic Resources Ltd. said it agreed to sell its 48%
stake in a South Carolina gold mine to Placer Dome Inc. for
US$18 million.
   Under terms of the agreement, Galactic said Placer also
would assume $21 million in mine-related debt. The cash
proceeds would be used to eliminate Galactic's corporate
long-term debt, said Peter Guest, Galactic's president and
chief executive officer. The two gold-mining concerns are
based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

   The Ridgeway mine is Galactic's main asset. The company's
share of output from the mine represented nearly
three-fourths of Galactic's total production last year of
115,000 ounces of gold.
   The other 52% of the Ridgeway mine is owned by Kennecott
Corp. of Salt Lake City, which has a right of first refusal
on Galactic's interest. Mr. Guest said Kennecott, a
subsidiary of Britain's RTZ Corp. PLC, was considering
whether to exercise its right. Kennecott officials couldn't
be reached for comment.
   Galactic also said it has delayed an acquisition agreement
with DCC Equities Ltd., a Toronto merchant bank, until the
sale of the Ridgeway stake is completed. Galactic had agreed
to acquire a number of mining and energy investments from
DCC, which in turn would have taken a 47% equity stake in
Galactic.
