   Former Democratic vice presidential nominee
Geraldine Ferraro says both Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush did well in Sunday night's debate, but Bush's success
came ``probably because I taught him how to do it.''
   Ms. Ferraro, who debated Bush during the 1984 campaign, also
said her unsuccessful campaign would continue to be significant
until a woman is elected to the White House.
   ``I have a place in history,'' she said Monday night before a
speech at Emory University. ``And I'll have that place in history
until a woman runs and wins. Then I'll fade into the woodwork.''
   Ms. Ferraro, a former New York congresswoman, was the running
mate chosen by Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale,
making her the only woman ever nominated for president or vice
president by a major political party.
   The 1984 Democratic ticket suffered one of the worst defeats
ever in a presidential race.
