   The 80-year-old mother-in-law of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro was mugged by a man who
snatched her purse and pushed her to the ground, police said.
   Rose Zaccaro was treated for a cut lip and a bruised cheek and
forehead after the attack, which occurred Sunday afternoon near her
home in Queens. She was released from St. John's Hospital after
X-rays showed no broken bones.
   Police said Mrs. Zaccaro's assailant snuck up from behind as she
was walking. Detectives reported no suspects in the attack.
   Mrs. Zaccaro is the mother of Ms. Ferraro's husband, John
Zaccaro.
