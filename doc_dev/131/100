<HEAD>NOW Releases List of Women for Convention Posts, Vice Presidency</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Organization for Women has a list
of 47 prominent Democratic women it says the Democratic Party
should consider for key convention roles and for the vice
presidential nomination.
   NOW President Molly Yard released the list Monday as she also
called on the Democrats to continue official support of the Equal
Rights Amendment, abortion rights and gay rights, and to add a new
platform plank promoting women candidates.
   ``We think it would be a very serious mistake'' to eliminate all
potentially controversial issues from the platform, Yard said at a
news conference.
   NOW's list of Democratic women includes 1984 vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro, Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado,
Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, Rep. Barbara Kennelly of
Connecticut, Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire, former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.
   Former NOW chief Eleanor Smeal said at the press conference that
she would introduce a new platform plank requiring equal
representation of women candidates in primaries. She said she
intends to press it at the Republican convention as well.

<HEAD>New Jersey Governor Visits With Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean met privately
for two hours with Vice President George Bush and said he offered
advice on a ``range of issues'' for Bush's presidential campaign.
   Kean, in town Monday to promote his recently published
autobiography, said he was invited by the vice president to attend
the meeting in Bush's White House office.
   They did not discuss politics or the possibility that Kean might
be a vice presidential candidate, Kean said.
   ``It was all issues,'' the governor said.
   Kean has been in the forefront among governors in implementing
educational reforms and has been praised by President Reagan for
some of his programs.
   Bush has vowed to make reform of the nation's schools a top
priority of his presidency.
   The meeting was scheduled to last one hour, but Kean said he was
invited by Bush to remain for a second hour to talk about
environmental issues.
