   President Reagan said Monday the United States
inevitably will have a woman president, and ``I welcome it.''
   But during a question-and-answer session with a group of school
children in the State Dining Room of the White House, Reagan also
said he thought a woman would likely get to the Oval Office only by
serving first as vice president.
   Asked whether there would ever be a woman chief executive, he
replied, ``I don't know. Believe, I'm certainly not against it. ...''
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have
met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of England,
Margaret Thatcher, and she's done a remarkable job for England,''
the president said.
   Reagan will play host to Mrs. Thatcher for an official visit and
state dinner at the White House later this week. The British prime
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the Western
Alliance during his nearly eight years in office.
   As for a women president, Reagan said the idea would take ``a
little getting used to on the part of some people. But I think it's
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president
because they've come up in so many different fields.''
   He added: ``It's just my feeling that probably, rather than one
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with,
that maybe it would probably start with one of them, as we did in
the election in 1984, ... running for vice president. She didn't
make it, but that might be the start of it, and I welcome it.''
   Reagan was referring to then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., who
had the second spot on the Democratic ticket headed by then-Vice
President Walter F. Mondale.
   Reagan swept to a 49-state landslide over the ticket, with the
Mondale-Ferraro team carrying only Mondale's home state of Minnesota
and the District of Columbia.
   Reagan's appearance before students from five Washington-area
junior and senior high schools was the first of four such talks the
president plans to give before leaving office on Jan. 20.
   Before taking questions from the pupils, Reagan told his audience
that he would look to young people to carry forth the message of the
American revolution to the rest of the world. But as the world goes
through rapid technological and social change, he said, ``the
permanent truths which give meaning to our lives don't change.''
