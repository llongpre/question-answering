   A potential juror in the cocaine trial of
John Zaccaro Jr. said she thought the press picked on his family
during the 1984 vice presidential candidacy of his mother,
Geraldine Ferraro.
   The woman was one of 15 candidates selected after painstaking
questioning of 25 people during jury selection, which resumed this
morning for a third day.
   Opening arguments were expected later today or Thursday. Twelve
jurors and two alternates are needed for the trial.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said the selection of
a jury was slowed by the publicity given the case and the fact
Ferraro is so well-known.
   ``Selecting a jury is probably the most important part of the
case,'' he said. Quinn said if even one juror bore a grudge, it
could influence the jury's verdict.
   Most of those questioned said they had read newspaper accounts
of the case since Zaccaro, 24, was charged in 1986 with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent.
   One potential juror said today that he would discount anything
he read in the newspapers though because of a basic distrust of the
press. ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just
because they have been charged,'' said Donald Cioffi.
   Only one person has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Zaccaro's mother could affect his view of the case.
   Jury pool member Joanne Cillo said Tuesday that she felt that
press treatment of Ferraro during the 1984 campaign carried over to
Zaccaro.
   ``I can't say I don't feel the press picked on these people,''
Cillo said when asked if she was pleased with how Ferraro has been
treated.
   She said her views would not interfere with her judgment if she
is chosen to hear the case. ``The press is not trying this case,''
she said. ``The issue is, did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   ``I don't believe it's up to me to make restitution for what the
press may or may not have done,'' she added.
   Zaccaro, then a senior at Middlebury College, pleaded innocent
to the charge. He has been accompanied to court each day by his
mother and father, John Zaccaro Sr.
   Ferraro, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers, taking
notes intently, but stopping when Cillo spoke about her family. At
that point she rested her head in her hand and looked down.
   She later declined to comment on the case, telling one reporter,
``It's nothing against you personally. We're just not answering
anything for anybody.''
   The start of Monday's trial came two years after her son was
arrested outside the Middlebury restaurant where he worked.
   Six reporters were allowed to watch the questioning, which was
briefly interrupted Monday when Judge Francis McCaffrey imposed and
then lifted a gag order on reporters covering jury selection.
   Defense lawyers sought the gag order for fear too many reporters
could intimidate potential jurors. But McCaffrey lifted it
following a challenge from reporters and an agreement to limit
their number in the courtroom.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the courts. Zaccaro's
attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and claimed
unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution because
of his mother.
   The Vermont Supreme Court refused to dismiss the case.
