   Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to win a
slot on a major party's presidential ticket, says she's considering
a political comeback.
   Ferraro, Walter Mondale's running mate on the 1984 Democratic
ticket, is weighing a challenge to New York Republican Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato.
   The former three-term congresswoman says she isn't worried that
a political campaign would resurrect hurtful stories about her or
her family.
   ``I don't think there's very much that the people of this state
or this nation don't know about me or about my family,'' Ferraro
said Wednesday in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ferraro was hounded by questions about her family's finances
during the 1984 campaign. She later complained that her political
fame hurt her family and led to harsher court treatment of her
husband and son.
   Her husband, John Zaccaro, pleaded guilty in 1985 to a
misdemeanor charge in a real estate deal. Her son, John Zaccaro
Jr., later was convicted of selling a quarter-gram of cocaine while
at Middlebury College in Vermont.
   ``I would love to back in Washington, I would love to be part of
the decision-making process with reference to what's going on in
this country,'' said Ferraro, 54, who lives in the New York City
borough of Queens.
   A race against Rep. Thomas Manton, who holds Ferraro's former
seat, is out of the question, she said.
   ``I endorsed him and he is a Democrat who represents my district
very, very well.''
   D'Amato's second term ends in 1992. Recent polls show his
popularity is slipping, primarily because of reports that he used
his influence to steer money from the Department of Housing and
Urban Development to friends nd political supporters.
   The Senate ethics committee has hired an outside counsel to
decide whether it should launch a full-scale investigation of
D'Amato.
   Ferraro flirted with the idea of taking on D'Amato in 1986, but
pulled back, citing personal reasons.
   Wednesday, Ferraro said she ruled out that Senate race because
she feared the power of Attorney General Edwin Meese III. The
Justice Department was investigating complaints that she had failed
to fully disclose her husband's finances while she was in Congress.
   ``That investigation continued well past the campaign, nursed by
people within the Justice Department, and I found out later that Ed
Meese had personal interest in it and was tying it to my political
decisions,'' she said.
   ``I did not doubt for one minute that he would use it
politically against me.''
   The 22-month investigation ended with the department deciding
there was no basis for a criminal or civil action.
