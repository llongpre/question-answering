   The National Organization for Women plans
to urge likely Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis to select rival
Jesse Jackson or a ``non-white'' woman as his running mate, the
group's president said Tuesday.
   Molly Yard said it would take the selection of Jackson, who is
very sensitive to women's issues, or ``a woman from Jackson's
constituency'' to smooth relations between the women's movement and
the Democratic Party.
   ``The whole stance of the party since 1984 has been to blame us
for the defeat of Mondale and Ferraro,'' she said.
   NOW, the nation's largest women's rights organization, has been
a major influence in Democratic politics and was a factor in the
selection of Geraldine Ferraro as Walter Mondale's running mate in
the 1984 presidential race. The ticket later was defeated by the
largest margin in the history of U.S. presidential races.
   Ms. Yard said the group plans to introduce a resolution calling
on Dukakis to heed their advice on the vice presidential choice.
The NOW president did not provide a date for the resolution, but
the group is holding its national conference in Buffalo this week.
   Dukakis is currently considering potential running mates.
Jackson, runner-up to the Massachusetts governor in the delegate
race, has said he has earned the right to be offered the No. 2
spot, but Dukakis has not made any commitment.
   Yard also charged that Democratic leaders have tried to keep NOW
out of the 1988 election.
   ``They say they don't want the party captive to special
interests,'' she said. ``I don't know how they can call the
nation's largest group of voters a special interest.''
   There are 10 million more women registered to vote than men, she
said.
   The NOW president also said the Democratic Party could lose the
women's vote and the 1988 presidential election if it doesn't pay
more attention to women's issues.
   Yard warned that millions of women would vote Republican if the
GOP is perceived as caring more than the Democrats about women.
   ``Even though their platform is a disaster, they'll get votes
because they're seriously considering a woman as a vice
presidential candidate,'' Yard said of the Republicans.
   ``Everything depends on who you showcase at the convention,''
she said.
   Elizabeth Dole, the former transportation secretary, is
considered a candidate for the No. 2 spot on the GOP ticket that
will be headed by all-but-certain nominee George Bush.
   Selection of Mrs. Dole as a running mate could hand Bush the
presidency, Yard said. Mrs. Dole is the wife of Kansas Sen. Bob
Dole who battled Bush unsuccessfully for the GOP presidential
nomination.
   NOW calculates that Dukakis's apparent early lead over Bush
could disappear if he loses a significant portion of the women's
vote. National polls indicate Bush is running significantly behind
Dukakis among women while running about even among men.
   ``It's not the time for the Democrats to send signals that they
will in any way deny the importance of women's issues,'' she said.
