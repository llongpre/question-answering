   Geraldine Ferraro, who four years ago became
the first woman on a major party's national ticket, said today she
was ``delighted'' with Michael Dukakis' plans to name Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen as his Democratic running mate.
   She said that had there been enough women in political office to
provide Dukakis with a good choice for a female running mate she
would have been disappointed at his choice of a man.
   ``But because we don't have a woman in that spot, I am not
(disappointed),'' she said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ms. Ferraro, part of the losing Democratic ticket with Walter
Mondale in 1984, said Bentsen ``has been fine on issues that I and
many women care about and in addition to that he's going to be a
very strong help to the ticket, rounding it out beautifully so that
with a Democrat in the White House it's going to make a difference
for the women in this country.''
   ``I'm delighted. I think it's an indication that Governor
Dukakis intends to run a strong national campaign. I think he's
going to go down South and seriously battle the Republicans for
those votes that should be ours based upon the conditions facing
this country,'' she said.
   Earlier, Ms. Ferraro told USA Today that there were not enough
women in positions from which national offices are traditionally
chosen _ the U.S. Senate, Congress and statehouses _ to provide
Dukakis with a good choice. She said no women currently in elected
office meet Dukakis' need of a candidate strong on foreign policy
experience who will also give him geographic balance.
   She said Jesse Jackson ``does not have those credentials that,
politically, Michael Dukakis needs in his vice president.''
   ``Had I not been a woman _ and I'm the first one to say it _ I
probably would not have been chosen,'' she told the newspaper. ``In
1984 ... it was time to remove this final barrier from women's
achieving political power.''
   She said her candidacy in 1984 and Jackson's campaigns are
expanding participation in the political process.
   ``Between Jackson's campaign this year and 1984, we as a nation
said, `Enough already, we're going to let everybody have a chance
to participate.' That's a big thing nobody can take away,'' she
said.
   Ms. Ferraro, 52, said she also has no bitterness over a national
profile that brought harsh scrutiny of her family and criminal
investigations of her husband. Her son was convicted of a drug
charge this year.
   ``1984 was an incredible opportunity for me. That doesn't lead
one to be bitter. I genuinely feel my husband and son were singled
out. That doesn't make us bitter,'' she said. ``I'm not going to
let that happen to me.''
