   Gov. Mario Cuomo was nominated Monday to run
for a third term, but some at the state Democratic convention
wondered if he'd serve out the term if re-elected or take a run at
the White House.
   With the convention band breaking into ``I Love New York,'' the
57-year-old governor was nominated by acclamation.
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 Democratic presidential
candidate was scheduled to address the delegates Tuesday.
   Last week, New York Republicans chose Manhattan economist and
businessman Pierre Rinfret, a political unknown, to challenge Cuomo.
   Making appearances at the convention were New York Mayor David
Dinkins, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro, who spoke out for abortion rights.
   The former Queens congresswoman who ran on the 1984 Democratic
presidential ticket with Walter Mondale is considering a 1992 run
for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Alfonse
D'Amato.
   Another speaker was actor Christopher Reeve, who pressed for
greater efforts to clean up the environment.
   Most speakers stressed the party's goal of claiming majority
control of the Republican-dominated state Senate.
   Delegates nominated Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine to run again with
Cuomo. If re-elected, it would be Lundine's second term as
lieutenant governor.
   The governor, refusing to rule out a possible bid for the
presidency in 1992, announced his re-election plans Sunday. He
considered a presidential campaign in 1988, but ultimately bowed out.
   Ms. Ferraro said Democrats nationwide favor Cuomo.
   ``They believe that he can be the person who can carry the
Democrats to the White House in 1992,'' she said of party followers
she's met across the country.
