<HEAD>Geraldine Ferraro's Son Seeks Remainder of Probation Dismissed</HEAD>

   John Zaccaro Jr. has been a model
probationer and should be released early from probation on a
cocaine-selling conviction, his lawyer argued today.
   The son of 1984 vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
was convicted two years ago of selling one-quarter gram of cocaine
for $25 to an undercover officer while a student at Middlebury
College in Vermont in 1986.
   Zaccaro's attorney, Charles Tetzlaff argued that Zaccaro should
be released from probation early because he is beginning his first
semester as a law student at Catholic University in Washington,
D.C., and would have to return monthly to New York state, which is
supervising his probation.
   The District of Columbia won't accept any probation cases unless
there is less than a year in the term.
   Zaccaro has been serving a sentence of one to five years on
probation. But Tetzlaff said that under New York state regulations,
Zaccaro would be eligible for release from probation in December.
   Addison County States Attorney John Quinn argued that Zaccaro
should be supervised for at least another semester because he was
arrested while in a college atmosphere and now he is back in that
atmosphere.
   Vermont District Judge Francis McCaffery made no immediate
decision on the request to dismiss Zaccaro from probation.
   Zaccaro served three months of his sentence under house arrest
at a Burlington luxury apartment whose amenities were ridiculed by
some who argued the former congresswoman's son received special
treatment from the courts.
