   As Michael Dukakis begins the process of
selecting a Democratic vice presidential nominee, the surest bet in
politics is that his choice will be a man.
   Not even the women who worked so hard four years ago to get
Geraldine Ferraro on the Democratic ticket expect Dukakis to follow
Walter F. Mondale's history-making example.
   ``It certainly isn't the top-of-line discussion it was in
1984,'' said Joanne Howes, a political consultant and director of
the non-partisan Women's Vote Project.
   ``Is that a priority in his campaign this year, or in the
party?'' said Irene Natividad, director of the National Women's
Political Caucus. ``It doesn't seem like it.''
   So when Paul Brountas, the Boston lawyer who is heading the
Dukakis search for a running mate came to Washington to talk vice
presidential politics, the big names on his calling list were all
male, names like John Glenn, Sam Nunn, and Bill Bradley.
   He did pay a call on Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland. But now
in her second year as a senator, she is on no one's list of vice
presidential prospects.
   Missing from Brountas' list was Rep. Pat Schroeder of Colorado,
who came close to running for president and is the most credible
vice presidential prospect among Democratic women.
   Three women often are mentioned as potential running mates for
Republican George Bush _ former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth
Dole, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and former U.N. Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick. This is the party that turned its back on the
Equal Rights Amendment and demands that its national candidates
take strong stands against abortion.
   Analysts talk of a ``gender gap'' that favors Democrats, the
fact that a far higher percentage of women than men support
Democratic candidates.
   Yet, this election year, the likely women vice presidential
candidates are Republicans, not Democrats.
   ``I think the major reason is obvious,'' said Celinda Lake, a
senior associated with The Analysis Group, a Democratic polling
organization. ``There are lots of ways in which the Democrats are
turning away from the '84 experience.
   ``And one of the ways, which I think is incorrect, is they think
they would not benefit from nominating a woman as the vice
president.''
   The ``'84 experience,'' of course, was the fact the
Mondale-Ferraro ticket was beaten in 49 of 50 states as President
Reagan received an estimated 55 percent of the women's vote.
   ``I also think,'' said Lake ``there is somewhat of a shortage of
women who are both ready and willing. ... Because the Democrats
have been out of office for eight years, we don't have the women in
the administrative pipeline.''
   That view was echoed by others, including Joanne Symons, a
political consultant who worked on Rep. Richard Gephardt's
presidential campaign.
   ``There are not enough (Democratic) women in the pool,'' she
said, because a Republican president has been filling Cabinet
positions the past seven and a half years.
   Lake also cited an ambition factor.
   She listed Gov. Madeleine Kunin of Vermont, along with Schroeder
and Mikulski as Democratic women who have the stature to be vice
presidential candidates and said, ``I don't think they want it.
They want to be No. 1, not No. 2.''
   Howes said, ``The real goal is to be prepared in the 1990s for a
woman to be ready to be president of the United States and to run
for president of the United States and to win.''
