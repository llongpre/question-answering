EVERYONE knows that New York politics can be among the roughest and meanest
in the US. But even by New York standards the four-way Democratic Senate
primary race - culminating in today's vote - will go down as one of the most
vitriolic campaigns in many years.
The winner of this melee will challenge Mr Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a
right-wing politician from suburban Long Island, who has thus far tramped
about the US citing the fact that he has been rebuked rather than censured
by the Senate ethics committee as proof that he has been exonerated of past
influence-peddling charges.
Mr D'Amato is considered vulnerable this year, not least because of his
chequered record. But the Democrats have engaged in so much mud-slinging
that there is unlikely to be much high ground left to be gained by his
opponent.
Although her substantial early lead has nearly evaporated, the front-runner
among the Democrats is 56-year-old Ms Geraldine Ferraro, the former
congresswomen from the Queens who in the 1984 presidential election served
as Mr Walter Mondale's controversial running mate.
Ms Ferraro's troubles first began during the 1984 campaign when allegations
were made about the legality of her husband's business dealings. He pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanour after the campaign.
An unabashed supporter of capital punishment, Ms Ferraro styles herself as a
no-nonsense feminist with a working-class background.
It is the negative campaigning of her rivals that has raised the possibility
that she may not make it after all. Advertisments by rivals have accused Ms
Ferraro's landlord husband of ties to the Mafia and have repeatedly alleged
he rented a house to a child pornographer.
Ms Ferraro's keenest challenger, New York State attorney-general Mr Robert
Abrams, has not been hesitant to make use of the controversy. Neither has Ms
Elizabeth Holtzman, a former congresswomen and New York's current
comptroller.
Oddly enough the only candidate who has not attacked Ms Ferraro over ethics
is the normally demagogic Rev Al Sharpton. He arrived at a televised debate
last week with a symbolic bucket of mud for his colleagues. The debate among
the Senate Democratic primary candidates became so heated that the moderator
kept intervening to say: 'Ladies, ladies, ladies, Ms Holtzman, Ms Ferraro. .
.'
Issues have thus taken a back seat to insults, which means that even if Ms
Ferraro does win today, she is unlikely to be the unblemished sort of
challenger who can make much of the various investigations of Mr D'Amato.
The seediness of this year's New York Senate race looks set to continue.
Jurek Martin adds from Washington; Another race of interest concerns
Congressman Stephen Solarz, the Democratic foreign policy expert.
His old safe House of Representatives seat in Brooklyn has been redrawn  -
with the purpose of promoting Hispanic representation in Congress - and he
may be vulnerable to the challenge of Ms Elizabeth Colon, an advocate of
Puerto Rican interests.
