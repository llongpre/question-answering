<HEAD>Reagan Says Woman President `Inevitable'</HEAD>

   President Reagan told a group of schoolchildren
that he believes it's ``inevitable'' that a woman will one day be
president, most likely after first serving as vice president.
   The president's comments came during a question-and-answer
session with junior and senior high school students from four
Washington-area schools.
   ``As a matter of fact, the statesman in the world that I have
met, that I respect the most, is the prime minister of England,
Margaret Thatcher, and she's done a remarkable job for England,''
the president said.
   Reagan will play host to Mrs. Thatcher for an official visit and
state dinner at the White House later this week. The British prime
minister has been his closest friend and ally in the Western
Alliance during his nearly eight years in office.
   Reagan said the idea of a woman president would take ``a little
getting used to on the part of some people. But I think it's
inevitable that in this country there will be a woman president
because they've come up in so many different fields.''
   He added: ``It's just my feeling that probably, rather than one
of them just entering the fray to run for president to begin with,
that maybe it would probably start with one of them, as we did in
the election in 1984, ... running for vice president. She didn't
make it, but that might be the start of it, and I welcome it.''
   Reagan was referring to then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro, D-N.Y., who
had the second spot on the Democratic ticket headed by former Vice
President Walter F. Mondale.
