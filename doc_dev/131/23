<HEAD>Ferraro Won't Apologize For Son's Luxury Digs</HEAD>

   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro said Tuesday her son is not living a life of luxury _
despite his $1,500-a-month apartment _ while serving a four-month
sentence for cocaine possession.
   John Zaccaro is staying in a Burlington, Vt., hotel-style
apartment, which has room service and cable TV, as part of a
``house arrest'' program, aimed at easing prison overcrowding.
   ``I go up for weekends and come home and I'm crazy,'' Ferraro
said. ``It's better than being in jail, but ... he's by himself, he
does his own cooking.''
   Ferraro, who was the Democratic vice-presidential candidate in
1984, denied reports that Zaccaro has a servant.
   ``It's not true,'' she said. ``They give you clean linens once a
week and they vacuum.''
   ``We can't apologize for it _ we had to get him housing,''
Ferraro told the New York Post. ``I won't apologize for it.''
   Zaccaro was convicted in April of selling a quarter-gram of
cocaine to an undercover officer while a student at Middlebury
College in 1986. He was sentenced to one to five years in prison,
with all but four months suspended.
