<LEADPARA>  Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential candidate, said she
will seek the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican New York Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato next year. For months, Ferraro has been testing the waters for
a potential bid with a series of "focus groups" in New York to weigh her
chances of winning a crowded Democratic primary and then beating D'Amato. But
her brief comments Tuesday night at a political reception in Washington were
the first time she has publicly declared that she will run. "Oh, yes, I'm
going to run," Ferraro said. "But I won't announce formally until this fall."  </LEADPARA>
