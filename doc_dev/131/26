   The Justice Department said it dropped the idea of possible court action against former New York Rep. Geraldine Ferraro or her husband, John Zaccaro, in connection with federal financial-disclosure statements. 

   Ms. Ferraro was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 1984. 

   Last May, department officials announced the close of a lengthy criminal investigation of the matter, which began in summer 1984, without prosecuting Ms. Ferraro or her spouse. 
But at the time, government attorneys held open the possibility of filing a civil suit over Ms. Ferraro's failure to disclose her husband's finances on annual federal financial reports while she served in Congress. 

   Over the weekend, a Justice Department spokeswoman said the decision came after government attorneys concluded that they didn't have sufficient evidence to show that the former Democratic lawmaker knowingly or willfully violated federal disclosure laws.
