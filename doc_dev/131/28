   Scores of jostling and shouting
photographers besieged Princess Elena of Spain at Exeter
University, where she is studying on a teaching fellowship.
   Students and staff watched with a mixture of amusement and alarm
Friday as photographers and TV crews closed in on the 24-year-old
daughter of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophia.
   But the princess appeared unruffled and even shook hands with
some of the photographers who had converged on the campus in
southwestern England.
   Elena, a teacher and friend of Princess Diana, is on a six-month
teaching fellowship, working with children with special learning
needs.

   Newspaper columnist Ann Landers said
Friday about one-third of the more than 1,000 pieces of mail she
receives daily come from men, most of whom are seeking advice about
personal relationships.
   ``Usually, the man who writes to Ann Landers is writing about
his wife of long standing or his girlfriend of short standing, or a
deadly combination (of both),'' she said.
   Miss Landers said she has used her syndicated column to educate
and credited her readers' wisdom with helping her.
   ``If I could give just one piece of advice to everyone in the
world, it would be just two words: Be kind,'' she said. ``It is the
greatest gift you can give, and it costs you nothing.''
   Miss Landers, whose real name is Eppie Lederer, spoke at a
breakfast meeting sponsored by the Ohio Newspaper Association.

   James Meredith, who broke the
color barrier at the University of Mississippi 26 years ago, said
education remains the best vehicle to break the cycle of poverty
and oppression.
   Meredith, 54, was the first black student to attend the
University of Mississippi in 1962. Violence broke out on the Ole
Miss campus, and President John F. Kennedy called in federal troops
to maintain order.
   Meredith graduated from the university and went on to earn a law
degree at Columbia University.
   In a speech to Air Force Academy cadets Thursday, Meredith said
American blacks need to take more advantage of their citzenship
rights to improve their economic and political opportunities. By
seeking a state-funded education at Ole Miss, Meredith said he
chose to challenge white supremacy.

   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro says life at her Fire Island summer home is no day at the
beach _ in fact, she can't even go to the beach because she's so
recognizable.
   That's why Ms. Ferraro and husband John Zaccaro are asking for a
variance to build a swimming pool on their property and provide
them with some privacy.
   ``Because of the burden of celebrity, we are unable to take
advantage of the beach except for early morning or late evening,''
Ms. Ferraro told an unusual Manhattan meeting of the Saltaire
Village Board of Zoning Appeals on Thursday.
   Under village laws, an owner must have at least 10 lots to build
a pool; the former congresswoman and her husband own nine. The
board has reserved decision on the request, but it was not met
enthusiastically by some members.
   ``When we give variances it's usually because of hardship, and I
don't see the hardship here,'' said board member Hilliard Farr, a
summer softball teammate of Zaccaro and his wife.
   Ms. Ferraro ran unsuccessfully in 1984 on the Democratic ticket
headed by Walter Mondale.
