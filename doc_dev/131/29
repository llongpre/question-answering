   The son of former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro was sentenced Thursday to four months
in jail for selling $25 worth of cocaine to an undercover police
officer.
   John Zaccaro Jr., 24, also was ordered to pay a $1,500 fine and
perform 300 hours of community service.
   ``We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the
sentence,'' Ferraro said, noting that other defendants in Vermont
drug cases have received lighter penalties. She said the conviction
would be appealled.
   During his sentencing hearing, Zaccaro told Vermont District
Judge Francis McCaffrey in a shaky voice that he has sworn off
drugs.
   ``I'd like to make a personal pledge to you and my family that I
will never again be involved in drugs or any illegality,'' he said.
   Zaccaro's attorney, Charles Tetzlaff, asked McCaffrey to accept
a probation officer's recommendation of a suspended sentence,
probation and community service.
   But McCaffrey told Zaccaro, ``I can't in good conscience
sentence you without any time to serve.'' Zaccaro faced a maximum
of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said he was pleased
with the sentence. He denied treating the case differently.
   ``This was a case in which we caught someone red-handed, and I
mean red-handed,'' Quinn said. ``I felt that it was important for
the court to say it doesn't matter who you are. If you commit a
drug offense in the state of Vermont, you'll be treated with great
severity.''
   McCaffrey suggested the jail time be served through the
Chittenden Community Correctional Center in Burlington so that
Zaccaro could participate in a special corrections program that
allows him to be kept under house arrest.
   Quinn said Zaccaro would have to be accepted into the program.
   During the sentencing, Zaccaro stood stoically beside his
father, John Zaccaro, and his mother, who was Walter Mondale's
running mate on the Democratic ticket in 1984.
   Zaccaro was arrested in February 1986 and convicted by a
District Court jury last April. He was arrested after selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to undercover agent Laura Manning while
he was attending Middlebury College, about 30 miles north of
Rutland.
   Manning testified that she went to Zaccaro's off-campus home,
where Zaccaro produced a tray of cocaine packets from underneath
the living room sofa. Zaccaro was arrested that night outside the
restaurant where he worked.
   Tetzlaff argued that police used Manning as bait to snare him
during a college party weekend. The prosecution denied the charge.
   At the sentencing hearing, a tearful Ferraro had asked McCaffrey
not to treat her son differently than any other person convicted of
selling $25 worth of cocaine. She also said Zaccaro's arrest and
conviction have taken a heavy toll on her family and son.
   ``He doesn't go to church with us,'' she said. ``He doesn't want
to be seen with us. It's not because he's ashamed of us. It's
because he's ashamed of what he's done.''
   Also testifying at the sentencing hearing was the Rev. Bruce
Ritter, the founder of a New York City shelter for runaways called
Covenant House where Zaccaro works as a volunteer.
   Ritter said Zaccaro has learned his lesson.
   ``You can't try and reach these kids ... without coming into a
far better and deeper understanding of your own value system,'' he
said. ``Probably the most important things we learn are from our
mistakes. John has learned them.''
   McCaffrey also received 30 letters written on behalf of Zaccaro,
including one from his mother and one from Mondale.
   ``I saw him as a very fine young man who quickly became good
friends with our children and who campaigned in a spirited and
strong way around our nation,'' Mondale wrote.
