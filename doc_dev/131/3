<HEAD>VP Debate, Playoff Starting Times Adjusted to Avoid Conflict</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Oct. 5 starting times for the
vice-presidential debate and the major league baseball playoffs
have been juggled to avoid a conflict, officials involved said.
   The 90-minute debate between Democrat Lloyd Bentsen and
Republican Dan Quayle was moved from a 9 p.m. EDT starting time to
8:30 p.m., officials said Tuesday.
   The start of the first game of the American League playoffs,
scheduled for the home of the East Division winner, was moved from
8:28 p.m. to 1:20 p.m., and the first pitch of game two in the
National League playoffs at Los Angeles was pushed back from 3:07
p.m. to 10:08 p.m.
   ABC will televise the baseball games. All the major networks
will televise the debate.

<HEAD>Geraldine Ferraro Says She Taught George Bush To Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Democratic vice presidential nominee
Geraldine Ferraro says both Democrat Michael Dukakis and Republican
George Bush did well in Sunday night's debate, but Bush's success
came ``probably because I taught him how to do it.''
   Ms. Ferraro, who debated Bush during the 1984 campaign, also
said her unsuccessful campaign would continue to be significant
until a woman is elected to the White House.
   ``I have a place in history,'' she said Monday night before a
speech at Emory University. ``And I'll have that place in history
until a woman runs and wins. Then I'll fade into the woodwork.''
   Ms. Ferraro, a former New York congresswoman, was the running
mate chosen by Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale,
making her the only woman ever nominated for president or vice
president by a major political party.

<HEAD>Heavy Metal Adds Heavy Cost To VP Debate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor's office has added $200,000 to the
city's potential tab for hosting the Oct. 5 vice presidential
debate, bringing the estimated cost to $900,000.
   The cost includes about $43,000 the city will pay to buy out a
heavy metal rock concert by the ``Scorpions'' that had been
scheduled for the City Auditorium, mayoral aide Kevin Collison said
Tuesday.
   The cost of staging the debate between Sens. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, and Dan Quayle, R-Ind., increased largely because the city
was forced to switch the debate site from the Orpheum Theater to
the City Auditorium, Collison said.
   The auditorium was the second choice of city officials who said
they could not afford the $200,000 needed to buy out three shows of
the musical ``Cats'' that were scheduled over two days at the
Orpheum.
   Collison said other costs _ including new chairs and a new
lighting system _ have driven the price tag for the auditorium
higher than had been forecast.
