   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen is ``more a plus than he is
a minus'' on women's issues, but his stance on Contra aid and
defense spending could alienate women voters in November, women's
groups said Tuesday.
   The Texas senator, Democrat Michael Dukakis' running mate
choice, offers a mixed record that could turn some women voters to
Republican George Bush, especially if Bush picks a female running
mate, said Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for
Women.
   ``If you're a Democrat it's very worrisome,'' she said.
   Polls have shown that Bush is troubled by a ``gender gap'' that
has many women leaning toward the Democratic candidate in the
presidential race. But the choice of Bentsen doesn't solidify the
women's vote in the Democratic column, the groups said.
   NOW and the bipartisan National Women's Political Caucus rated
Bentsen's record as generally good, based on his support during the
100th Congress of civil rights legislation, Medicaid funding for
abortion in the District of Columbia and his opposition to the
Supreme Court nomination of Robert Bork. Bentsen has also supported
the Equal Rights Amendment.
   ``Basically, he's more a plus than he is a minus,'' said Ms.
Yard. ``I think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he
is very much a hawk. He was pro-Contra aid, and for all the money
spent on defense. He is really business as usual and that's why the
voters want change.''
   Women are more strongly opposed to defense spending and to
Contra aid, she said, because they ``want this world to turn into a
world of negotiation and stop this nonsense about fighting.''
   Irene Natividad, chairman of the National Women's Political
Caucus, said women's groups had not expected this year that
Democrats would name a woman vice president candidate because ``the
sense was that the Democratic Party felt they had already done a
women on the ticket.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who was Walter Mondale's running mate on the
losing Democratic ticket in 1984, said she was ``delighted'' by the
choice of Bentsen.
   She said she was not disappointed a man had been chosen, since
there were not enough women in national political office to provide
Dukakis with a good choice for a female running mate.
   ``If we had a woman in that Senate seat or in the statehouse
that had the credentials that Senator Bentsen has, I, of course,
would be disappointed. But because we don't have a woman in that
spot, I am not,'' she said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Ms. Ferraro said Bentsen ``has been fine on issues that I and
many women care about and in addition to that he's going to be a
very strong help to the ticket, rounding it out beautifully so that
with a Democrat in the White House it's going to make a difference
for the women in this country.''
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., who explored the possibility of
running for president in 1988, said that problems with the economy
are more likely to make women vote Democratic and that Bentsen, as
head of the Senate Finance Committee, offered strong credentials on
that issue.
   ``All the gender gap polling is showing that women are truly
understanding what's wrong with the economy because they're the
ones out there trying to juggle two jobs. They're going to be very
pleased with Bentsen,'' she said.
   ``The real gender gap is generated from women struggling to meet
the family budget every month. Somehow I don't think they're going
to see Bush as identifying with that problem,'' she said.
