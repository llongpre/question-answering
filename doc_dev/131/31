   A state jury here acquitted the husband of 1984 Democratic vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro of extortion charges. 

   John A. Zaccaro, a 54-year-old New York real estate broker, was on trial in his home borough of Queens on charges that he conspired with the borough's then-president in 1981 to solicit a bribe, never paid, from a local cable television concern that was seeking a franchise. 
The innocent verdict, which came after the jury deliberated six hours, wasn't a surprise, because the district attorney's key witness from the cable company had unexpectedly denied Mr. Zaccaro tried to extort money. 

   The former borough president who allegedly conspired with Mr. Zaccaro, Donald Manes, last year committed suicide as he was being drawn into the city's then-emerging corruption scandal. 

   The allegations against Mr. Zaccaro hadn't yet been made when his wife, herself a former Queens prosecutor, was making her vice presidential bid. 
Mr. Zaccaro's attorney, Robert G. Morvillo, borrowed her former running mate's line "Where's the beef?" -- itself borrowed from a Wendy's hamburger ad -- in criticizing the state's case. 

   Standing with his family outside court yesterday, Mr. Zaccaro told a group of reporters that "I'm glad it's over." 
Ms. Ferraro added that she might return to politics.
