   Two hundred years after a group of men gathered
to write the Constitution, women and minorities are closing in on
equal status but still have many hurdles to cross, Coretta Scott
King told a national symposium.
   Mrs. King, wife of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King
Jr., said Friday that criticism of the Constitution as it was
adopted in 1787 is justified.
   Her speech came in the closing day of a symposium on women and
the Constitution convened by former first ladies Rosalynn Carter
and Lady Bird Johnson. About 1,500 women from all 50 states and 10
foreign countries attended.
   ``Some people apparently feel that blacks and women should join
in an uncritical celebration of a document that protected the slave
trade and denied women their democratic rights,'' Mrs. King said.
``We still have a way to go before we can say that the Constitution
is working for all Americans.''
   Mrs. King echoed another speaker at the symposium, 1984 vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, in calling for more
political activism on the part of women.
   ``If America is to fulfill the promise of the Constitution, we
will need many more women of all races holding elective office,''
Mrs. King said. ``We have a strength and tenacity and a gift for
nurturing and compassion which has been finely honed and tempered
in our struggle to raise families in a sexist society.''
   ``We just might save this nation from its pending apointment
with Armageddon,'' she said.
   Mrs. King said the civil rights struggles of the 1950s and 1960s
laid the groundwork for the women's rights movements of the years
that followed. She said the kind of organized, non-violent dissent
championed by her late husband is still an effective form of
protest.
   ``The (civil rights) movement showed millions of Americans that
you can, indeed you must, defy authority when that authority is in
the wrong,'' Mrs. King said.
   Earlier Friday, Ms. Ferraro said that while no women are among
the candidates for president in either party, women have reached
higher levels in the campaign organizations than ever before.
   ``The women who hold positions of responsibility in presidential
campaigns, whether or not their candidate is ultimately successful,
will forge contacts and gain credibility that will endure beyond
this election cycle,'' she said.
   ``Many of them will be back, with higher ambitions and sharper
skills, in 1992,'' Ms. Ferraro said.
   Ms. Ferraro, whose presence on the 1984 Democratic ticket with
Walter Mondale was a high point for the women's movement, said the
women in some of the 1988 campaigns will go on to be advisers to
the next president.
   ``And that's important, too,'' she said. ``The current
administration has widely been regarded as hostile to women's
issues. That is in part because this president's inner circle of
advisers ... have except for his wife been men.''
