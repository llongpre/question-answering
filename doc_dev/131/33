MR Robert Abrams, attorney-general for New York state, yesterday claimed a
razor-thin win over Ms Geraldine Ferraro, former vice-presidential
candidate, in the hotly contested primary battle to become the Democratic
candidate for the New York Senate seat at stake in November.
Ms Ferraro, who was on the receiving end of a vitriolic television
advertising campaign in which Mr Abrams accused her of numerous ethics
violations, was refusing yesterday to concede defeat.
With 99 per cent of precincts having reported, Mr Abrams had 410,402 votes
(37 per cent), while Ms Ferraro had 399,410 votes (36 per cent). Two other
candidates split the rest.
Ms Ferraro, although clearly disheartened after she had spent millions of
dollars on the contest, argued that she might yet win when absentee votes
were counted.
The Democratic victor will run against Senator Alfonse 'Al' D'Amato, a
right-wing Republican who has himself been the target of ethics probes and
has been rebuked by the Senate Ethics Committee. Mr Abrams, a liberal, has
argued that he is better placed than Ms Ferraro to challenge the senator
over ethics.
In a primary for a Manhattan seat in the House of Representatives, Democrats
elected the late Mr Ted Weiss, although the liberal incumbent had died on
Monday. Now Democratic party leaders will select a candidate to contest the
November election.
