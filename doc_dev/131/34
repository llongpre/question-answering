   More potential jurors were questioned today
in the cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr., with attorneys asking
panelists about the defendant's mother, former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Questioning resumed after a judge lifted a gag order Monday that
restricted media coverage of jury selection. News organizations
protested, and it was rescinded when all sides agreed to permit a
pool of six reporters.
   All three panelists questioned this morning said they had read
newspaper accounts of the case since Zaccaro was charged in 1986
with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police
agent. Zaccaro was a senior at Middlebury College.
   One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' Ferraro's family while the former congresswoman was
the Democratic nominee in 1984, and she thought the attacks had
carried over to the son after his arrest.
   However, the unidentified woman said her views would not
interfere with her judgment if she is chosen to hear the case.
   ``The press is not trying this case,'' she said. ``The issue is,
did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   Zaccaro faces a maximum prison term of five years if convicted.
   The long-delayed trial began Monday. Questioning of potential
panelists centered on their political beliefs and their views on
the impact of drugs on society.
   Zaccaro, 24, was accompanied in court by his parents, Ferraro
and John Zaccaro Sr.
   Judge Francis McCaffery imposed the gag order at the request of
defense attorneys, who were concerned that too many reporters in
the room could intimidate potential jurors. But he lifted it after
a challenge from media representatives and an agreement among
lawyers to allow six reporters to observe the proceedings.
   Robert Hemley, a lawyer representing media organizations,
including The Associated Press, told the judge there would be
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was
public.
   Lawyers on Monday completed initial questioning of at least
seven potential jurors of a pool of more than 20. More than 150
people could be interviewed.
   Several in the jury pool expressed strong feelings about the
role of drugs in society. One man who was dismissed said, ``I'd
probably be the one going to jail if I catch someone selling drugs
to my kid.''
   None of those questioned said Ferraro's place on the 1984
Democratic Party ticket would affect their judgment of her son.
   The trial comes more than two years after Zaccaro was arrested
outside the Middlebury restaurant where he worked.
   The charge involves allegations that Zaccaro sold cocaine to
undercover agent Laura Manning after she came to his off-campus
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the Vermont courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution
because of his mother.
   But the Vermont Supreme Court refused to dismiss the case.
