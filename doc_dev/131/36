<HEAD>Mondale Urges Dukakis To Use Different Strategy Than His For
Picking Veep</HEAD>

   Walter F. Mondale says the interviews he held
four years ago with prospective running mates proved a ``damaged
strategy'' and he thinks Michael Dukakis ought to find a different
way of selecting the Democratic vice presidential nominee this year.
   Four years ago, Mondale interviewed a succession of candidates
before he chose Geraldine Ferraro, then a congresswoman from New
York, as the first woman on a major party's national ticket. One by
one, the vice presidential hopefuls visited Mondale at his home in
Minnesota.
   In retrospect, ``I don't think it built confidence,'' Mondale
said of the process. The 1984 Democratic presidential nominee's
comments came in a telephone interview from his Minneapolis law
office on Monday.
   ``I don't think the way that process played out reassured
Americans,'' he said. ``It's a damaged strategy even though it was
not a bad idea.''
   He suggested that Dukakis ``pursue a different way of looking at
vice presidential candidates.''
   Asked if he thought Dukakis, who now appears likely to lock up
the Democratic presidential nomination before the July convention,
should choose a Southerner for his running mate, Mondale said, ``I
wouldn't say he has to. But what I can't figure out is how you get
the numbers if you don't run strong in the South.''
   Mondale was optimistic about the Democrats' chances of winning a
presidential election for only the second time in the last six.
   ``We've got a shot at this deal,'' he said.
   Republican Vice President George Bush ``is a troubled
candidate,'' he said. ``I think he gets off in an uncertain way. I
think there are going to be vulnerabilities on both sides. But
Dukakis looks strong as a person and I don't think Bush does.''
   Mondale said there is a need to ``constantly reassure Americans
that you possess that special presidential strength of character
and independence and resolve to serve the public interest.''
   In recent campaign appearances, Bush often has seemed to be
campaigning against Jimmy Carter, under whom Mondale served as vice
president.
   ``I believe that's a sign of weakness,'' said Mondale. ``Here's
a guy who ought to be filling in the blanks where people are
worried about him, which is character and vision and direction and
presidential status.
   ``Instead, he's out there hacking around against a president
who's been out of office for eight years.''
   Mondale also suggested that Dukakis avoid following his example
of declaring that if elected president he would raise taxes to
reduce the federal deficit.
   ``I think it's too bad ...that we can't talk about our real
problems,'' he said, but ``I think the verdict is in on that.''
