   With jury selection almost completed,
opening arguments were scheduled Thursday in the cocaine trial of
John Zaccaro Jr.
   After three days of closely questioning 30 potential jurors,
prosecutors and defense lawyers prepared to narrow the group to the
12 people who will decide whether Zaccaro is guilty of illegally
selling a regulated drug.
   The state maintains that Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury
College, sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover police
officer two years ago.
   The two sides have closely questioned the potential jurors,
trying to determine any biases stemming from the publicity given
the case and from the fact that Zaccaro, now 24, is the son of
former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Ferraro could affect his view of the case.
   Many of the potential jurors said they discounted what they had
read, because of a distrust of the press.
   ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just because
they have been charged,'' said Donald Cioffi on Wednesday.
   Warren Taylor of Chittenden said he was ``not a firm believer in
what the media prints.''
   Another potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' Ferraro's family while she was a candidate in 1984,
and she thought the attacks had carried over to Zaccaro after his
arrest.
   Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., have been present for
the three days of questioning in the cramped chambers of the
presiding judge.
   Police said they began their investigation of Zaccaro after
hearing he was dealing drugs. He is charged with selling the
cocaine to an undercover police officer.
   Defense lawyer Charles Tetzlaff has asked potential jurors if
they would be willing to find someone innocent based on a technical
defect in the state's case. The defense is expected to try to prove
that Zaccaro was entrapped by the police, and that the police
singled him out because of his famous mother.
