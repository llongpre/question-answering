<HEAD>Bush Won't Elaborate on Advice for Running Against Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he's got some
opinions about running against women candidates, but he won't say
what they are.
   Bush called himself an ``expert in the field,'' referring to his
1984 vice presidential race against then Rep. Geraldine Ferraro.
   He was asked at a news conference if he had any advice for
Clayton Williams, the Republican gubernatorial candidate in Texas
whose opponent will be decided in a runoff between Democratic state
Treasurer Ann Richards and Attorney Gen. Jim Mattox.
   Williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against
a woman.
   As for presidential advice, Bush retorted:
   ``I have none at all, but I know exactly what he means and I
refuse to elaborate on it,'' because it could end up ``complicating
his life,'' he said.
   ``Remember 1984. I can't forget it.''
   Williams, he said, is, ``entitled to his opinion. Maybe he's
drawing on my experience.''
   Bush had a hard time competing with the wave of positive feeling
Ferraro's candidacy initially generated among women.
   When at last he felt he had made a strong showing against her in
a televised debate, Bush stated he had ``kicked a little ass'' with
his performance.
