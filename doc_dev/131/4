   Antonetta Ferraro, mother of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, has died. She was 84.
   Mrs. Ferraro died Friday at her daughter's Forest Hills home of
emphysema and cancer.
   ``I always said I had two role models in life,'' Ms. Ferraro
told New York Newsday. ``One was Eleanor Roosevelt and one was
Antonetta Ferraro. She worked all her life. She worked in
sweatshops when they were really sweatshops. She learned a trade at
13 that put me through law school.''
   Mrs. Ferraro, whose husband, Dominick, died in 1943, had left
the hospital two months ago to be with her daughter and her family.
   The family has set up the Antonetta Ferraro Scholarship Fund at
Marymount Manhattan College in Manhattan, where Ms. Ferraro
graduated.
   ``It's a scholarship fund for girls who have been raised
(solely) by their mothers,'' said Ms. Ferraro, the Democrat nominee
for vice-president in 1984. ``My mother felt she never had an
education, but I always told her she did pretty well by me.''
   In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Ferraro is survived by a son,
Carl, and six grandchildren.
   The funeral was set for Tuesday in the New York City borough of
Queens.
