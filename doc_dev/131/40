   A judge bowed to objections from news
organizations and lifted an order barring reporting on jury
selection Monday at the cocaine-sale trial of John Zaccaro Jr., son
of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   The 24-year-old Zaccaro is charged with selling a quarter gram
of the drug to an undercover officer two years ago while a senior
at Middlebury College. The offense carries a penalty of up to five
years in prison and a $10,000 fine.
   Zaccaro on Monday entered the courtroom separately from his
parents, Ferraro and John Zaccaro Sr., as the long-delayed trial
began. But they sat immediately behind their son.
   In questioning of at least seven potential jurors Monday, none
said Ferraro's candidacy would have any affect on how they would
judge her son.
   Several panelists expressed strong sentiments about drugs. One
juror, who was dismissed, said, ``I'd probably be the one going to
jail if I catch someone selling drugs to my kid.''
   Judge Francis McCaffrey, after a meeting with attorneys, had
imposed an gag order and said only six reporters could attend jury
selection. He said that he expects the process to last three days
and that any information published could prejudice the jury pool.
   ``It is important that we get an impartial jury. That is where
you persons have become an issue,'' McCaffrey told the 11 reporters
in the courtroom. ``Clearly, segregated voir dire is appropriate in
this case.''
   However, after an afternoon hearing on a challenge from several
news organizations, McCaffery lifted the order. But he said only
six reporters would be allowed in the room during the proceedings
and they would have to share their information.
   Robert Hemley, a lawyer representing media organizations,
including The Associated Press, had told the judge there would be
publicity regardless of whether the questioning of jurors was
public.
   ``The issue, then, is, what is happening in the voir dire
process that is different or more damaging (than previous pre-trial
publicity)?'' Hemley said.
   Zaccaro's lawyers, Charles Tetzlaff and Thomas Sherrer, had
requested the order and Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn
did not object. Quinn said he also was concerned about the jury
pool, noting that the case has received widespread publicity
because of Ferraro's prominence.
   Zaccaro is charged with sale of a regulated drug for allegedly
selling cocaine to undercover agent Laura Manning after she came to
his off-campus apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   Zaccaro also had been charged with possession of cocaine with
intent to sell, based on evidence police had found in Zaccaro's
car, including eight grams of cocaine and documents described as
records of drug transactions.
   But the charge was dismissed because of problems with the search
warrant and the lack of other evidence to prove the charge.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the Vermont courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution
because of his famous mother, who ran on the Democratic ticket in
1984 with Walter Mondale.
   Tetzlaff and Sherrer were unsuccessful in having the case thrown
out altogether. The Vermont Supreme Court refused to dismiss the
charges.
