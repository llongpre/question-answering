<HEAD>Ferraro Offers `Hints' to Dukakis, Warning on Bush</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geraldine Ferraro says she has some
``hints'' for Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis on who should
be his running mate.
   ``If he called me up I might give him a hint or two,'' said the
former congresswoman from Queens, N.Y. and 1984 Democratic vice
presidential candidate.
   Ferraro, 52, also issued a warning about Vice President George
Bush.
   She reminded the 350 people at Thursday's fundraiser for Lt.
Gov. Richard A. Licht about Bush's behavior during their 1984
debate.
   After the contest Bush said he had ``kicked ass.''
   ``You remember how George Bush acted that night,'' Ferraro told
the predominantly female crowd. ``He was so upset. He was serious
one minute and giddy the next ... up down, up down. Talk about mood
swings ... you've got to be careful when you put a man in a
position like that.''

<HEAD>Iowa Democrats Falling in Line as Race Progresses</HEAD>

   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis was
poised to solidify his lead among Democratic activists gathering
Saturday for congressional district conventions.
   Dukakis has picked up the endorsement of Iowa Democratic
Chairwoman Bonnie Campbell and all five statewide Democratic
elected officials, has landed two of the state's nine ``super
delegates'' and is scheduled to collect a third on Monday.
   Party leaders predicted he would pick up most of the 34
delegates to be picked at the six conventions.
   ``I think we're likely to see more movement toward Dukakis,''
said Democratic Party spokesman Phil Roeder.
   ``Most people now concede that Mike Dukakis is the
front-runner,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``I am expecting he will get the
lion's share of the delegates.''
   Their comments came on the eve of the district conventions, the
third step in the Democrats' complex method of picking delegates
and hammering out a state platform.

<HEAD>State Democrats Collect Funds On New Credit Card Purchases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Democratic Party has mailed 65,000
applications for Indiana's first political affinity credit card.
   The VISA card issued by Indiana National Bank could raise as
much as $200,000 a year for the state Democratic party, said state
chairman John B. Livengood.
   The Democratic Party will make a profit off the card by taking a
cut of the fees, typically 5 percent per purchase charged to
merchants and paid to credit card companies.
   The Indiana Democrats will take one-half of 1 percent, said
party treasurer Larry Cummings.
   The card which has a 16.8 percent interest rate and a $3,000
credit line, features a silhouette of a bucking donkey, the party's
symbol.
   Republicans in the state had considered the affinity card idea
but dropped it after deciding too many such cards were already on
the market, said party chairman Gordon K. Durnil.
