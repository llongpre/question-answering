   Ronald Reagan didn't choose his vice
presidential running mate until almost the last minute, Jimmy
Carter conducted a long, boring search, and Adlai Stevenson
declined to choose at all. They all did it their way and so did
George Bush.
   Bush's decision to keep everybody guessing _ until Tuesday
afternoon _ was the No. 2 topic at the Republican National
Convention, which had little else to talk about. No. 1, of course,
was the choice itself.
   Bush brought all that speculation to an abrupt end Tuesday
afternoon with his announcement that he had selected Sen. Dan
Quayle of Indiana as his running mate.
   In holding his cards close to his vest, Bush was only doing unto
others what Reagan did to him. All evening, on Wednesday of 1980
Republican Convention week in Detroit, it looked as if former
President Gerald Ford would be Reagan's choice for vice president.
The way Ford saw it, if they won they would have sort of a shared
presidency.
   But at 11:15 p.m. Reagan and Ford agreed not to be a team and
Bush received a telephone call. As Bush recalls in his
autobiography, the conversation went like this:
   ``Hello, George, this is Ron Reagan. I'd like to go over to the
convention and announce that you're my choice for vice president if
that's all right with you.''
   ``I'd be honored, Governor.''
   ``George is there anything at all ... about the platform or
anything else, anything that might make you uncomfortable down the
road.''
   Bush could think of nothing. A few minutes after midnight,
Reagan made an unusual trip to convention hall to announced his
choice, a dramatic end to a dramatic night of speculation and rumor.
   Despite the long list of vice presidential hopefuls that came to
be interviewed in Plains, Ga. in 1976, Carter didn't announce his
choice of Walter Mondale until Thursday, the day the vice
presidential nomination went before the delegates.
   The fact that both tickets with last minute running mate choices
won probably hadn't escaped Bush. The fact that Walter Mondale
picked Geraldine Ferraro in advance in 1984 _ and they lost the
election _ might also have made an impression.
   The choice of a running mate is probably the most important
early decision a presidential candidate makes. Thirteen vice
presidents have become president, eight on the death of a president.
   In 1956, Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson startled the
convention in Chicago by leaving the choice of his running mate to
the delegates. As a result, votes were distributed among 13
candidates after the first ballot.
   Sen. Estes Kefauver of Tennessee had 483{ votes, followed by
Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts with 304 and Sen. Albert Gore
of Tennessee with 178.
   On the second ballot, Kennedy had the lead after the roll call,
but before the chair recognized vote changes. Gore pulled out,
began a bandwagon for Kefauver, and Kennedy moved that Kefauver's
nomination be made unanimous. The ticket lost.
   With that exception, every vice presidential nominee in modern
times has been the presidential nominee's choice _ albeit an uneasy
choice, sometimes. In 1944, Franklin D. Roosevelt didn't want to
run with Vice President Henry Wallace but had no other favorite. He
was persuaded to accept Harry S. Truman, who then succeeded him 82
days after the inauguration when Roosevelt died.
   In 1960, Kennedy offered the No. 2 spot to Lyndon B. Johnson,
thinking that his chief opponent for the presidential nomination
would not accept. Johnson did, helped Kennedy win by bringing in
Southern states, and became president when JFK was assassinated in
1963.
   When Johnson ran for president in 1964, Republican nominee Barry
Goldwater picked Rep. William E. Miller as a teammate, saying ``one
of the reasons I chose Miller is that he drives Johnson nuts.''
