   Former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro says she partly blames herself and her candidacy for her
son's cocaine conviction because it made him ``a target,'' and says
the family will appeal the verdict to the Vermont Supreme Court.
   ``We still believe he was set up,'' said Ferraro of her
24-year-old son, John Zaccaro Jr. But she acknowledged that he had
possessed cocaine, and said his legal troubles showed him ``the
horrors of drugs.''
   A Vermont District Court jury deliberated for slightly more than
two hours Saturday before finding Zaccaro guilty of selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police officer while
he was a senior at Middlebury College two years ago.
   No sentencing date was set, and an appeal could take two years.
The felony conviction carries a maximum sentence of five years in
jail and a $10,000 fine.
   In a statement after the verdict, Ferraro blamed her son for
possessing cocaine, as well as herself ``and my candidacy for
making my son a target.'' Ferraro ran on the Democratic ticket with
Walter Mondale in 1984.
   ``We are a concerned family who has lived through a very
difficult two years,'' she said. ``We love our son. We do not
minimize in any way his use of drugs at Middlebury College or the
fact that Middlebury College is the place where drugs was available
to so many students and continues to be so. It was wrong.''
   ``There are four people who are guilty in this whole episode,''
Ferraro said. ``John for possession. We are grateful that God has
chosen this way to show him the horrors of drugs. Me and my
candidacy for making my son a target.''
   Ferraro's statement went on to name former Middlebury police
Sgt. David Wemette ``for setting my son up'' and Addison County
State's Attorney John Quinn for ``prolonging the agony for two
years'' by rejecting a plea bargain.
   ``We, as his parents, would not allow him to plead guilty'' to
the felony charge of selling cocaine, Ferraro said. The family had
asked prosecutors to allow Zaccaro to plead guilty to a lesser
charge of possession of cocaine.
   But Quinn would not accept a plea for less than a felony.
   ``If she wants to be angry at me for not reducing the charge,
that's her prerogative. I didn't feel there was any justification
for reducing the charge,'' Quinn said. ``There was plenty of
evidence he was selling. I never considered a possession case and
they know that,'' he added.
   Ferraro pointed to several drug cases recently heard in Vermont
in which plea bargains were arranged easily and light sentences
were given to defendants accused of selling larger quantities of
drugs.
   ``That may or may not be true. I know there are some cases like
that. It depends on the particular prosecutor. It depends on the
particular circumstances of the case,'' Quinn said.
   ``I recently prosecuted a guy on a felony charge for 37
marijuana plants. Perhaps in some counties they might have reduced
that. But as time goes on, I feel more strongly about drug cases. I
just think it's becoming more of a problem in the country and we
need to deter that,'' Quinn said.
   The defense also had raised the argument that Zaccaro was
unfairly singled out because of the publicity surrounding his
mother, but the Vermont Supreme Court refused to overturn the
charges on that basis.
   Jury selection lasted four days, prolonged by wide publicity the
case had gained, but the verdict came only one day after the trial
itself began.
   Opening arguments and testimony began Friday, with the defense
claiming Zaccaro was entrapped by a young, inexperienced,
attractive undercover police officer. ``This is a case of improper
and overzealous police conduct,'' Zaccaro's lawyer, Charles
Tetzlaff, argued.
   He called no witnesses, instead basing his defense on attacks on
the prosecution witnesses and attempting to show the police
investigation was based purely on rumor and that the undercover buy
was poorly executed.
   But Quinn said Zaccaro was a well-organized drug dealer. He
described the deal with undercover officer Laura Manning as just
another sale.
   ``When he takes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the
good merchant that he is, ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives
it to Manning, Quinn said.
   Manning's drug buy came Feb. 20, 1986. Quinn said it was
arranged after an anonymous note was left on Wemette's desk in the
fall of 1985 with Zaccaro's name, address, car registration and the
words: ``The Pharmacist.'' Police and prosecutors said Zaccaro had
earned the nickname because of his reputation as a drug dealer.
   Wemette testified he first heard rumors of Zaccaro's drug
dealing in 1984, but did not pursue them because Zaccaro left
college to help his mother's campaign.
   Most Middlebury students questioned about the case said the
outcome did not concern them. ``My sophomore year it was more
interesting. But now, half the people on campus weren't even
here,'' said Bob Woithe, a senior from Palm Island, Fla.
   The college had reacted to the arrest by forming a task force
that made 20 recommendations to address student drug abuse, most of
which have been adopted. They include the hiring of a health
educator, publication of a drug brochure, additional security
staff, and improved relations with the Middlebury police.
