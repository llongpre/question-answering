   Potential jurors questioned Tuesday in the
cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr. said their judgment would not be
influenced by the fact that the defendant's mother is former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   One potential juror told attorneys she thought the press had
``picked on'' Ferraro's family while she was a candidate in 1984,
and she thought the attacks had carried over to Zaccaro after his
arrest.
   The questioning was watched by six reporters one day after Judge
Francis McCaffrey imposed and then lifted a gag order.
   Most of the jurors questioned said they had read newspaper
accounts of the case since Zaccaro was charged in 1986 with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover police agent. Zaccaro,
24, was then a senior at Middlebury College.
   The offense carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and
a $10,000 fine.
   ``I can't say I don't feel the press picked on these people,''
said Joanne Cillo said when asked if she was pleased with how
Ferraro has been treated.
   But she said her views would not interfere with her judgment if
she is chosen to hear the case.
   ``The press is not trying this case,'' she said. ``The issue is,
did this gentleman sell drugs?''
   Ferraro, a lawyer, sat behind her son and his lawyers taking
notes intently. But she stopped when Cillo spoke about the
treatment her family received, rested her head in her hands and
looked down.
   John Zaccaro Sr. accompanied his wife and son on the second day
of questioning.
   None of the other jurors questioned so far have said they would
be influenced by the fact Ferraro is Zaccaro's mother. ``It
wouldn't matter one way or another who she was,'' Ellen Daly of
Rutland said.
   At the noon break, Ferraro declined to comment, telling one
reporter, ``It's nothing against you personally. We're just not
answering anything for anybody.''
   McCaffery had imposed the gag order Monday in response to
complaints by defense attorneys that the presence of too many
reporters could intimidate potential jurors. News organizations
protested, and it was rescinded later that day when all sides
agreed to permit a pool of six reporters.
   Prosecutor John Quinn said he was not sure how long it would
take to pick a jury.
   Pre-trial publicity seemed less of a problem than the jurors'
opinions about drug use.
   One man who was dismissed said, ``I'd probably be the one going
to jail if I catch someone selling drugs to my kid.''
   The trial comes more than two years after Zaccaro was arrested
outside the Middlebury restaurant where he worked.
   The charge involves allegations that Zaccaro sold cocaine to
undercover agent Laura Manning after she came to his off-campus
apartment and said she heard he could sell her drugs.
   The case has wound its way slowly through the Vermont courts.
Zaccaro's attorneys challenged several aspects of the case and
claimed unsuccessfully that Zaccaro was singled out for prosecution
because of his mother, but the Vermont Supreme Court refused to
dismiss the case.
