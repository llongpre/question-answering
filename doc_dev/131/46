   A judge has sentenced John Zaccaro Jr. to
four months in prison for selling cocaine to an undercover police
officer, rejecting Geraldine Ferraro's plea that ``my son has been
punished enough.''
   Vermont District Court Judge Francis McCaffrey also ordered
Zaccaro to pay $1,500 and perform 300 hours of community service
during his sentencing Thursday. Zaccaro, 24, could have faced up to
five years and a $10,000 fine for selling one-quarter gram of
cocaine in 1986.
   Zaccaro is free during the 30 days he has to appeal the
sentence. His mother, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential
nominee, said after the hearing that her son had been treated
differently than the average defendant.
   ``We are obviously very disappointed by the harshness of the
sentence,'' Ferraro said, noting that other defendants in Vermont
drug cases have received lighter penalties. Zaccaro's attorney,
Charles Tetzlaff, had requested a suspended sentence with probation
and community service.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn, who had requested a
jail term, denied that he had treated the case differently.
   ``This was a case where we caught a person red-handed, and I
mean red-handed,'' Quinn said. ``I felt that it was important for
this court to say it doesn't matter who you are, you're not going
to escape the consequences of selling cocaine in this state.''
   McCaffrey said he was at a loss to understand why Zaccaro sold
drugs, saying the only explanation he could think of was greed and
a desire for acceptance by his peers.
   ``I can't in good conscience sentence you without any time to
serve,'' the judge said. McCaffrey said that Zaccaro had grown up
with every advantage, including a good education and family support.
   McCaffrey suggested that the jail time be spent in special
Vermont corrections program that allows convicts to be kept under
house arrest with supervision by a probation officer. But Quinn
said later that Zaccaro must still be accepted into the program.
   Zaccaro's parents sat quietly and leaned forward as McCaffrey
passed sentence.
   In a hearing before McCaffrey's decision, Ferraro broke down in
tears on the stand as she described her reaction to her son's
February 1986 arrest. She was in Hawaii giving a lecture that day
and had to watch the event on television.
   ``When I got home from Hawaii, I went home and my son put his
arms around me and he cried and he said he was sorry,'' Ferraro
recalled. ``He was sorry for what he had done to us.''
   Zaccaro held his head in his hands as his mother described the
impact the case had on the family.
   Ferraro, a former New York prosecutor, criticized Quinn for
failing to allow a plea bargain.
   ``I have never had a case where people weren't interested in
discussing any sort of disposition,'' Ferraro said, adding that the
defense had ``begged and pleaded'' for an agreement.
   ``If it had been anyone else ... we would not be sitting here,''
she said. ``My son has been punished enough. I want him back. I
want him back so that we can start our lives all over again.''
