   Mindful of Geraldine Ferraro's ill-fated vice
presidential quest in 1984, Michael Dukakis had aides accompany
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen on his first campaign solo flight.
   The 67-year-old Bentsen is no stranger to campaign work, and the
silver-haired senator took several of his own aides with him on the
campaign foray to California, Nevada, New Mexico and Texas last
week.
   Officials in both the Dukakis and Bentsen camps remember how
Ferraro, Walter F. Mondale's running mate four years ago, hit the
campaign trail unprepared, and want to closely coordinate campaign
activities.
   Mrs. Ferraro badly mishandled the controversy surrounding her
husband's finances, and the issue quickly destroyed any momentum
the Democrats had following their nominating convention in San
Francisco. The ticket went on to lose 49 of the 50 states to Ronald
Reagan.
   ``They put her out, basically without any senior help from the
Mondale campaign,'' said Francis O'Brien, who had been called in to
help rescue the Ferraro campaign, and was on the Bentsen plane last
week.
   Four years ago, ``there was a lack of communication between the
two campaigns,'' he said. ``People who went through that experience
learned from that experience.''
   O'Brien led a cadre of Dukakis people on the Bentsen plane,
including Tad Devine, the Dukakis chief delegate-counter before the
convention, who will coordinate and direct the senator's campaign
from the Dukakis headquarters in Boston. Devine also worked for
Mondale four years ago.
   But Bentsen also will keep a group of his long-time advisers
with him to handle day-to-day issues.
   ``We've done a very good job of integrating the Dukakis staff,''
said Joseph O'Neill, a former Bentsen aide on Capitol Hill, who
will become his top traveling campaign staffer.
   A formal announcement of the campaign staff is planned later
this week, said Jack DeVore, Bentsen's spokesman.
   Bentsen's campaigning was kept at a deliberate pace last week
with careful staging of each event.
   His speeches were cautious, citing his Senate record on issues
of interest to each audience and working in some digs at the Reagan
administration _ but avoiding harsh attacks.
   Care was also taken to emphasize areas where he and Dukakis
agree.
   While the Bentsen choice is certainly a lot less daring than
Mondale's Ferraro decision, Bentsen and Dukakis probably have more
disagreements on policy. Bentsen is much more conservative on some
issues, including his opposition to gun control, support for aid to
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels and school prayer.
   The political message for the trip was found mostly in the
locations, which were designed to highlight the Dukakis campaign
theme of aggressively going after electoral votes that the
Republicans have controlled for years. The Democrats last won Texas
in 1976, and haven't won New Mexico, Nevada or California since
1964.
   Bentsen, a supporter of the Equal Rights Amendment, found a
friendly audience with a businesswomen's group in Albuquerque. He
played a ``come home to the Democratic Party'' theme to a union
audience in San Francisco, in Nevada and at his Texas stop in
Amarillo _ a Republican area that's home to his opponent in this
year's Senate race, Rep. Beau Boulter.
   As permitted by Texas law, Bentsen is running for the vice
presidency and the Senate at the same time.
   The trip hit two areas a day, instead of the three-a-day planned
for later in the campaign.
   As a state-wide campaigner in Texas, the national campaign isn't
as big a step up for Bentsen as it was for Ferraro, a member of the
House from Queens, N.Y. Bentsen also has the experience of his
unsuccessful 1976 campaign for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
   The senator said that from his viewpoint ``it's gone very
well,'' and he was surprised he didn't face a sea of Bush signs at
his rally in Amarillo.
   ``I think we could have done a few more things,'' he said. ``But
we wanted some time in there in case things weren't working out.''
   The trip was cut short by a day when the campaign canceled a
planned visit to Mississippi because of a conflict with Dukakis'
schedule.
   Bentsen returned to Washington, where he plans to immerse
himself in a heavy Senate schedule including action on the trade
and plant-closing notification bills.
   Dukakis aides said Bentsen's congressional schedule was a plus
even though it will cut into his campaign time. One aide said it
provides ``meat and potatoes'' for the Democratic effort.
   Bentsen says he expects to campaign in Texas, the South and
Southwest. But aides say it's still to be decided how the
candidate's time will be apportioned.
   ``That's going to be a part of the discussion'' as the campaign
begins to nail down staffing and strategy in the next few days,
O'Neill said Friday.
   On the road, Bentsen said he was encouraged by the large number
of local officials who want to appear on the dais with him and
Dukakis when they hit town.
   Aides said that kind of reaction is a good indication of the
level of local support.
