<DESCRIPT>  LETTER  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  As a woman and a journalist, I was offended by the Los Angeles Times story
"Ferraro in the running again," in the Nov. 20 Mercury News.;   Why did Josh
Getlin feel it pertinent to his story to include evidence of Ferraro's
appearance in his lead? Why do I need to know that her face is "more deeply
lined" or that her hair, once "frosted blond," has now "gone gray"?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This is classic evidence of the societal prejudice against older women, if
not women in general. Appearance over substance. Aging men are
"distinguished," while older women get "dumpy" or "matronly.";   Our
male-dominated society has it all figured out: Men always improve -- they get
wiser; women always decay, losing their appearances and thus their value.;  
Ferraro deserves better, especially in light of the fact she fights these
stereotypes for a living and furthered the women's movement immeasurably when
she became the first woman vice presidential candidate in 1984.;   Now she is
striving to wrest the power from the sexist legislators who apparently feel
comfortable allowing a lying, sexual vigilante to sit on the highest court in
America.;   Getlin should have recognized that Ferraro's substance is all that
matters and besides, she still looks damn good to me.;   But then, if we use
his logic, maybe Getlin is just too adorable (i.e., lacks the gray matter) to
get the big picture.;   -- Brooke Shelby Biggs;   Executive Editor;   Spartan
Daily, SJSU; Josh Getlin's characterization of Geraldine Ferraro is another
example of media sexism.;   Why is it that a woman's appearance always
requires comment. I don't see journalists describing male political candidates
as having "blond hair gone gray" and having "more deeply lined" faces. I would
think that journalists today would have greater professionalism.;   --
Margaret Flores;   San Jose; Josh Golin states that "On a hot summer night
seven years ago, Ferraro became the first woman in history to be nominated for
the vice presidency.";   That statement is not correct. Not only was Ferraro
not the first woman to run for the vice presidency, she wasn't even the third
or fourth. Many third parties have nominated women for vice president and
president. Nor was she the first woman to receive an electoral college vote.
That piece of history belongs to Tonia Nathan. She received an electoral
college vote in 1972. She ran on the Libertarian Party ticket.;   If you're
interested in new ideas, such as running a woman for president or vice
president, you can be sure America's third parties will be the first to try
it. Next year if you want to vote for a woman for the vice presidential spot,
one option will be Dr. Nancy Lord, the Libertarian Party's nominee. I doubt
you'll have that option on the Demo-Republican ticket.;   -- Mark Hinkle;
