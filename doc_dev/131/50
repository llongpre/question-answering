   Before his first debate with Susan Molinari,
House candidate Bob Gigante received an unusual warning from his
consultants: ``Whatever you do, don't make her cry.''
   Running against a woman can be a delicate business. Just ask
George Bush.
   ``Remember 1984? I can't forget it,'' Bush said recently of his
vice presidential race against Democrat Geraldine Ferraro.
   The subject arose after Clayton Williams, the Republican nominee
for Texas governor, said he'd rather run against state Attorney
General Jim Mattox than state Treasurer Ann Richards. The two
Democrats are in a runoff April 10.
   ``I wouldn't be as comfortable in battling with a woman,''
Williams said.
   ``I know exactly what he means and I refuse to elaborate on
it,'' Bush sympathized.
   And no wonder. The political landscape is strewn with faux pas
by men _ mostly older ones _ more accustomed to thinking of women
in the kitchen than on the campaign trail.
   ``The men are nervous,'' says Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.
``Women running is just plain different and men sense it.''
   ``They are very confused,'' adds Republican pollster Ann Stone.
``The rules have changed very quickly over the last 10 to 15 years.
You've got to kind of feel sorry for them. ... Maybe their heart's
now in the right place but their mouth's not there yet.''
   Bush got himself in trouble six years ago when he boasted that
he had ``kicked a little ass'' in a debate against Ferraro. The
same race featured Mississippi agriculture commissioner Jim Buck
Ross asking Ferraro if she could bake blueberry muffins. ``Yes. Can
you?'' she replied.
   A few years later, men told women in Wisconsin and New Hampshire
that they shouldn't be running for Congress because they had young
children. One of the candidates, Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.,
later apologized and called his statement ``just plain stupid.''
   ``There are some things you just don't do. I think you have to
be a little bit more chivalric, if that's the right word,'' said
California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who is vying with
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein for the Democratic
gubernatorial nomination.
   Van de Kamp offered only one specific: he wouldn't punch his
opponent in the nose. But he still is taking a few swings at
Feinstein, including an attack ad that ends, ``Dianne Feinstein _
if she couldn't manage a city, how could she manage California?''
   In contrast, Martha Layne Collins was elected governor of
Kentucky in 1983 ``in part because her opponents never could figure
out how to run against her. They never did point out anything wrong
with her,'' said Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman.
   ``Lesson No. 1 about running against a woman is if it walks like
a candidate and talks like a candidate, you treat it like a
candidate,'' added Hickman, whose clients include Van de Kamp and
Sen. Paul Simon, an Illinois Democrat trying to fend off a
challenge by GOP Rep. Lynn Martin.
   Women like Martin and Richards, who have hired two of the
hardest-hitting media consultants in the business, are making it
easier for men to attack by proving that they can be as aggressive
as the next guy.
   They also are coming up with some deft responses to
gender-related missteps.
   Ferraro's good-natured comeback to Ross's blueberry muffin
question was considered ideal. Richards came up with a good
one-liner after Williams _ a self-styled symbol of the
free-wheeling, boot-wearing Texan _ confessed he wouldn't relish
running against her. ``Even cowboys get the blues,'' she said.
   Williams, 58, has been even bluer since he compared the bad
weather at his ranch last month to a rape. ``If it's inevitable,
just relax and enjoy it,'' he said. The incident created a furor
and Williams eventually apologized ``from the bottom of my heart.''
   Stone attributes Williams' remarks, both on rape and running
against women, to his generation and upbringing in Texas. ``His
lexicon hasn't caught up with the times yet,'' she said.
   But while men of Williams' age may not be used to competing with
women, many younger candidates like Gigante, 41, consider it
routine. The New York Democrat, who has four children and a working
wife, was surprised by his coaches' advice to be tough on Molinari
without making her cry.
   ``Why would she cry?'' Gigante asked. ``She's a mature woman.
She's held office. She wasn't going to cry when I attacked her on
an issue just like I wasn't going to cry if she attacked me.''
   For the record, Molinari did not cry. She won the election and
was sworn in last week as a Republican congresswoman from Staten
Island.
