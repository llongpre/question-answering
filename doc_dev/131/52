   Wimp-baiting has been a factor in American
politics since early in the republic's history, and the result has
been a ``compulsive masculinity'' among recent presidents, says a
professor who has studied the wimp factor in history.
   The wimp theme has persisted since Thomas Jefferson, who was
called ``womanish,'' through Martin Van Buren, who was accused of
wearing corsets and taking too many baths, and George Bush, who had
to battle what Newsweek magazine called ``The Wimp Factor'' in a
1988 cover story that asked if he could overcome it.
   Adlai Stevenson, the Democrats' candidate against war hero
Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956, was called ``Adelade'' and
Walter F. Mondale, who ran against Ronald Reagan in 1984, had to
confront bumper stickers that said ``Mondale Eats Quiche.'' Quiche
is considered wimp food, unsuitable for manly presidential palates.
Ask Bush, who made a campaign point of eating manly pork rinds,
their cholesterol count be damned.
   Bruce Curtis, who teaches American thought and language at
Michigan State University, says in an age that's less muscular than
the past, presidents have felt obliged to reveal themselves as
tough and their opponents as sissies.
   ``Now that the ideal masculine man is farther removed from
reality than ever, many nostalgic men,and not a few nostalgic
women, demand that our public leaders appear more masculine than
ever,'' he says in an article in the November issue of American
Heritage.
   The result, he says, is for politicians to assert their virility.
   Thus, he says, no president has been more ``earthily vulgar''
than Lyndon Johnson, who ridiculed opponents of his Vietnam
policies as ``nervous Nellies.''
   Richard Nixon reached for a pugilistic methaphor to describe his
``kitchen debate'' with Nikita Khrushchev, saying he felt he had
been ``up against a bare-knuckle slugger who had goughed, kneed and
kicked.''
   ``Even Jimmy Carter, among recent presidents seemingly the least
driven by machismo, revealed during the 1988 campaign his
susceptibility to its public demands by remarking that Bush seemed
rather `effeminate,''' notes Curtis.
   In his day, Carter, too, was accused of acting like a wimp. In a
famous mistake, the Boston Globe went to press in 1980 with an
editorial bearing a prankish headline that had not been intended to
see the light of day: ``More Mush from the Wimp.''
   To offset perceived wimpishness, candidates often talk tough.
   Bush bragged, the day after his 1984 vice presidential debate
with Geraldine Ferraro, that he had ``kicked a little ass.''
   Teddy Roosevelt, outraged that Woodrow Wilson initially shied
away from plunging America into World War I, said what Wilson had
done was ``to emasculate American manhood.'' Ronald Reagan,
threatening to veto a bill if Congress sent it to him, borrowed a
line from movie strongman Clint Eastwood: ``Make my day.''
   In the 19th century, reformers were ridiculed as ``namby-pamby,
goody-goody gentlemen'' who ``sip cold tea.'' Andrew Jackson, the
war hero and Indian fighter, described another politician as ``Miss
Nancy.'' Jefferson was called ``womanish'' because he ``took
counsel of his feelings and imagination.''
   Stevenson was ``Adelade'' to the New York Daily News, which also
said he ``used teacup words'' and had the support of ``Harvard
lace-liberals'' and ``lace-panty diplomats.''
   The need to prove himself tough sent Michael Dukakis, the
Democrats' presidential candidate last year, into a tank turret for
the filming of a campaign commercial which backfired; Dukakis
didn't look like he belonged there.
   Bush fought to overcome ``the wimp factor'' although there was
an occasional lapse. Once he was overheard saying he'd have ``just
another splash'' of coffee.
   Women in politics, like Ms. Ferraro, or Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., who shed tears when she withdrew as a candidate for the
Democratic presidential nomination in 1988, ``are condemned no
matter what they do,'' Curtis wrote.
   ``If gentle, they are womanish; if tough, they are not womanly.
By tradition a female cannot be a courageous, charismatic, wise,
effective leader as a woman.''
   ``The point,'' concludes Curtis, ``is not that the `manly'
characteristics of the myth _ courage, assertiveness in the face of
aggression, righteous defense of the weak _ are undesirable or
dangerous in themselves. The cinematic myth is dangerous because it
is labeled `for men only' and because it may be distorted and
debased by actors on the public scene.''
