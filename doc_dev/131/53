<HEAD>Bush's Southern Strategists To Meet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Staffers from Vice President George
Bush's presidential campaign and party chairmen from 13 states will
gather in Charleston this week to plan Bush's strategy in the
South, officials said.
   ``We'll go down the line state-by-state to see what needs to be
done to win,'' said Van Hipp Jr., Republican state party chairman
who is hosting the meeting Wednesday and Thursday.
   Among those participating will be South Carolina Gov. Carroll
Campbell, who is the vice president's Southern campaign chairman,
and Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater.
   Michael Dukakis, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, has
shown some strength in polls in southern states and Hipp said GOP
strategists will try to forestall any inroads the Massachusetts
governor may make in the region.
   ``Bush has got to carry the South. This is where his base has to
be, along with the West,'' Hipp said.

<HEAD>Cuomo Sees No Role For Himself At National Convention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, whose keynote
address to the 1984 Democratic National Convention propelled him to
national prominence, says he expects to have no formal role at this
year's gathering.
   ``I don't see any role at the convention for a very good
reason,'' Cuomo said Tuesday. ``I don't think Mike Dukakis (the
expected nominee) needs another northeastern liberal, so-called,
governor at the convention.''
   Cuomo said Delaware Sen. Joseph Biden was his top choice to be
keynote speaker to the convention ``if he were in shape to do it.''
Biden underwent brain surgery this year.
   Cuomo, who was once considered a potential 1988 Democratic
presidential candidate, said he met with Dukakis aides Tuesday in
New York City to plan strategy for the New York campaign.

<HEAD>Ferraro Says White Male, Senator Likely Veep Choice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic
vice presidential candidate, says Michael Dukakis, this year's
likely Democratic presidential nominee, will probably choose a
white male as a running mate.
   ``What undoubtedly will be done is that he will reach out to
someone who has Washington experience ... most likely in the
Senate,'' Ferraro said at a news conference Tuesday of fund-raisers
for Connecticut Democratic Senate candidate Joseph I. Lieberman.
   ``Where do our white males come from for national office? They
come from either a statehouse or the United States Senate.''
   ``Unfortunately for this country, blacks and women and Hispanics
and Orientals and Asians are under represented in our statehouses
and in our Senate,'' she said.
   Ferraro indicated that Sen. John Glenn of Ohio would be a good
choice as a running mate.
   ``I would not be unhappy with John Glenn. He is certainly a
centrist,'' Ferraro said.

<HEAD>Bush Aides Work to Put Best Face on Poor Poll Showings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President George Bush's Iowa
campaign manager, working to put the best face on sagging poll
numbers and reassure nervous activists, says Republican activists
will soon begin an assault on likely Democratic nominee Michael
Dukakis.
   ``Most Iowans haven't begun to focus seriously at the moment,''
said Cherokee lawyer George Wittgraf. ``I don't think voters are
that locked in. The reality is this race hasn't begun and it won't
begin in Iowa until after Labor Day.''
   Wittgraf met with reporters in the wake of a new poll published
Sunday showing Bush trailing Dukakis in the state by a 60-28 margin
and increased nervousness among GOP activists that Bush will be a
liability in the fall elections.
   Dukakis, Wittgraf said, is little known in Iowa, despite months
of campaigning prior to the Feb. 8 precinct caucuses and Bush
backers will work to ``give definition'' to the Massachusetts
governor.
