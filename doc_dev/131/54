   defense and foreign policy and Washington experience,'' all
considered crucial to a Democratic victory in Florida.
   Even backers of Jesse Jackson, who came in second to Dukakis in
the race for the presidential nomination and who had been one of
those the Massachusetts governor had considered for the second
spot, seemed satisfied with Bentsen.
   Florida state Rep. James Burke, who was the state campaign
coordinator for Jackson, said, ``We would have preferred to have
had Jesse.'' He added, though, that ``Bentsen is a better choice
than some of the others he could have picked.''
   John White, a former Democratic national chairman who has been
advising Jackson, said he was ``excited'' about the choice of
Bentsen and said it would ``make Texas a hell of a battlefield.''
   Union activists also praised Bentsen, saying that the Texas
senator had recently shored up his poor record on labor issues with
his deft handling of the trade bill and mandatory plant closing and
layoff notices _ some of labor's top legislative priorities this
year.
   ``Bentsen was extremely helpful in recognizing that the two _
plant closing notices and the trade bill _ were compatible,'' said
Robert McGlotten, legislative director for the AFL-CIO. ``And he
let his colleagues know how he felt.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who four years ago was picked as Democrat
Walter Mondale's running mate, said she was ``delighted'' at the
choice of Bentsen.
   ``I think it's an indication that Governor Dukakis intends to
run a strong national campaign,'' Ms. Ferraro said.
   On the Republican side, Senate Minority leader Bob Dole of
Kansas, frequently mentioned as a possible vice president on Bush's
ticket, said he thought Dukakis ``couldn't have picked a better
man.''
   Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., who is national co-chairwoman of
Bush's presidential campaign, called Bentsen ``a nice man who's
able'' but said she still anticipated that Bush would be able to
carry Texas.
   On the similarity to the Kennedy-Johnson ticket of 1960, she
said: ``I'm sure we're going to hear 1960 ad nauseum. There's a
slight difference of course. He (Bentsen) was not selected by his
peers to be in leadership (as Lyndon Johnson, the Senate majority
leader, had been); nor is Dukakis John Kennedy.''
