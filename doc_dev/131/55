   The National Organization for Women on Monday
released a list of prominent Democratic women and said the
Democratic Party should consider them for key convention roles as
well as for the vice presidential nomination.
   NOW also urged the Democrats to continue official support of the
Equal Rights Amendment, abortion rights and gay rights, and to add
a new platform plank promoting women candidates.
   ``We think it would be a very serious mistake'' to eliminate all
potentially controversial issues from the platform, NOW President
Molly Yard said at a news conference a day before she was scheduled
to testify before the party's platform committee.
   Yard distributed a list of 47 prominent Democratic women, saying
she wants the party to consider them as national convention
speakers and officers as well as potential running mates.
   On the list are current and former office-holders from Congress
down to city council, including former New York Rep. Geraldine
Ferraro, who was chosen by Walter F. Mondale as his running mate in
1984. Women's groups, including NOW, heavily lobbied Mondale to put
a woman on the ticket.
   Others on the list include Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado,
Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, Rep. Barbara Kennelly of
Connecticut, Houston Mayor Kathy Whitmire, former San Francisco
Mayor Dianne Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Mikulski of Maryland.
   Asked which vice presidential nominees would be acceptable or
unacceptable to NOW this year, former NOW chief Eleanor Smeal named
Sen. Sam Nunn as a negative example.
   Citing the Georgia senator's support for banning abortion and
for an ERA only with amendments, she said, ``His position on
women's issues would not be called exemplary.''
   ``We want both parties to consider a woman vice presidential
candidate,'' Smeal said. ``There are plenty of prospective
candidates out there who are women and we think they should be
considered seriously.''
   Smeal and Yard said they are confident ERA, abortion and gay
rights, as well as others supporting child care, family leave, pay
equity and a minimum wage hike, will remain in the platform.
   ``They don't have the votes to delete these planks. They're just
not there,'' Smeal said. She said there would be a strong feminist
contingent at the Atlanta convention in July.
   Smeal said she would introduce a new platform plank requiring
equal representation of women candidates in primaries. She noted
the Democrats already have a rule requiring equal numbers of men
and women on committees and at conventions.
   Under her proposal, endorsements by Democratic organizations
would have to be split 50-50 between male and female candidates.
She said she intends to press it at the Republican convention as
well.
   Smeal said the current system amounts to ``incumbent protection
clubs'' that give people ``30 years of job security whether they're
doing the job or not. ... This is just suicide to have a policy
that is keeping their decisionmakers virtually all white men.''
   Democratic leaders, including party chairman Paul Kirk, have
said they may try to win a brief platform acceptable to all
Democrats that excludes specific mention of controversial topics.
