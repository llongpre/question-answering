<HEAD>Vermont Supreme Court Upholds Drug Conviction Of Ferraro's Son</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court upheld the drug
conviction of John Zaccaro Jr., son of 1984 vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Zaccaro's attorney, Kathleen Sullivan, said the court's decision
Friday showed it didn't realize the importance of protecting the
home from undercover searches.
   Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury College, was arrested Feb.
20, 1986, at his Middlebury home after selling $25 worth of cocaine
to an undercover state police officer.
   Police searched Zaccaro's home and car before making the arrest.
   In a unanimous decision, the court rejected defense arguments
that the undercover operation was illegal or that Zaccaro was the
victim of selective prosecution because of his mother's fame.
   Zaccaro, convicted in 1988, was sentenced to one to five years
in prison, but was permitted to serve three months under house
arrest.
   The program he was sentenced under came under fire when it was
learned that he served his time in a $1,500-a-month Burlington
apartment with maid service.
   Zaccaro also completed more than 500 hours of community service
by working at the King Street Youth Center, in a program for
troubled youths.
