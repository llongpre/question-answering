   Former President Richard Nixon told the
nation's newspaper editors Vice President George Bush will beat
Democrat Michael Dukakis in a squeaker in November's presidential
election.
   One of only two men to have run five times for national office,
Nixon told the annual convention of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors on Friday that Bush will carry the South and put
together enough electoral votes through the farm belt and mountain
states to carry him to the White House.
   Nixon ran successfully twice for president and twice for vice
president and lost the presidential race in 1960. The other
five-time national candidate was Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won the
presidency four times but lost as a vice presidential candiate in
1920.
   Before the same group of editors in 1984, Nixon correctly
predicted that Walter Mondale would be the Democratic nominee but
incorrectly foresaw that Mondale would choose then-Colorado Sen.
Gary Hart or Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, as his running mate.
Mondale ran with Geraldine Ferraro, then a New York congresswoman.
   On Friday, he gave a state-by-state rundown of this year's race
to a packed room at the convention.
   ``First, on the East Coast, Dukakis will win Massachusetts, New
York, Pennsylvania,'' said Nixon, speaking rapidly, without notes.
``Bush will win Florida, South Carolina, Virginia. Dukakis will win
Maryland.
   ``North Carolina, I would call virtually a tossup, a slight edge
to Bush.''
   Nixon said the Midwest is tough to call. ``Dukakis will win
Michigan. Bush will win Indiana. Ohio and Illinois ... they could
go either way.''
   But he said Bush should beat Dukakis in the South.
   ``The farm states, unless you have (Kansas Sen. Bob) Dole on the
ticket, or someone else with appeal in the agricultural areas,
we're going to find a situation where Dukakis is going to win in
Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota and Iowa. Bush will hold
Kansas and Nebraska and Oklahoma. Missouri is a tossup, always is.
   ``The mountain states,'' Nixon continued, ``Bush will win all of
them except Montana and possibly New Mexico.
   ``The West Coast _ Washington, Dukakis; Oregon, about even.
California, the big enchilada, you pay your money and take your
choice.''
   And finally, said Nixon, ``in the end I believe Bush will win in
a very close election.''
