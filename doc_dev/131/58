   When Geraldine Ferraro strode to the podium at
the Democratic National Convention four years ago, there was
rejoicing that a woman had finally demolished a historic barrier
and joined the ticket of a major U.S. political party.
   But that was then and this was now.
   Women are insiders _ not outsiders _ at the 1988 convention.
   They're no longer toasting their triumphs and spoiling for new
battles. They're down in the political trenches alongside men,
taking quiet satisfaction at the thought that the Democrats are
about to nominate a presidential candidate _ Michael Dukakis _ who
supports them on most issues.
   ``Gerry was the pioneer,'' said Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio.
``I listened to her speech again at 2 o'clock this morning and it
still brought tears to my eyes.''
   Women activists agree there's little taste for making history in
Atlanta.
   ``We don't see the focus, because we don't have the ticket. Even
if we did have a woman on the ticket, there wouldn't be the same
emotion.
   ``We're now into the nuts and bolts of things,'' said Ms. Oakar,
who is co-chairman of the Atlanta convention's platform committee.
``What women did was the smart thing.''
   Although there is disagreement over Ms. Ferraro's impact on the
outcome of the 1984 election, there is no doubt that she galvanized
women and spurred others to run for public office.
   Women are seen speaking from the podium, cheering from the
convention floor as delegates and running convention committees.
Most polls indicate that women are contributing heavily to Dukakis'
strong showing against Republican candidate George Bush.
   ``People keep acting like we're banished,'' says Rep. Pat
Schroeder, D-Colo. ``We're not banished. We're under the tent.''
   ``These guys are hard to break through,'' says New York delegate
Bella Abzug, a former congresswoman. ``It doesn't come overnight.''
   ``The gender gap has proven once and for all they need to appeal
to women,'' said Celinda Lake, a Washington-based pollster who
researches women's issues. ``They may not know how to do it, but
they know they're supposed to.''
   Democratic women seem determined to eliminate disputes and
present a united front. ``There's no reason to be on the streets at
this convention,'' Ms. Lake said.
   ``There's a lot to be said for jumping up and down and those of
us on the inside love to do it,'' said Iowa Democratic Chairwoman
Bonnie Campbell. ``Is it as much fun? It will be the night of Nov.
8.''
   She added: ``I think it's directly attributable to the sense of
pragmatism that seems to be permeating everything this year. I
think now there's a sense of being on good behavior. It is part of
the evolution of the movement.''
   Veteran feminist Gloria Steinem says there's no reason for women
to fight when Dukakis is on their side.
   ``He's great on all our issues,'' she said. ``We don't need to
kick up our heels.''
   ``Movements go through stages,'' she added.
   ``The movement is still at the stage of developing a
consensus,'' said Monica McFadden, head of governmental relations
for the National Federation of Business and Professional Women.
   Gesturing toward a meeting of women activists, she said: ``You
ask this group what the most important item on the agenda is and
you'll get 74 different answers.''
