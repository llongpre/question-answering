   The Vermont Supreme Court has upheld the
1988 drug conviction of John Zaccaro Jr., the son of former vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   In a unanimous decision released Friday, the court rejected
claims by Zaccaro's attorneys that his conviction for possessing
and selling cocaine should be reversed. The justices rejected
arguments that, among other things, the 1986 undercover police
operation was conducted illegally and Zaccaro was the victim of
selective prosecution because of his mother's fame.
   ``While the officers involved acknowledged awareness of the fact
that defendant is the son of a public figure, there is no
indication that this was a motivating factor in the state's
decision to prosecute defendant,'' Associate Justice Ernest W.
Gibson wrote in the decision.
   Vermont Attorney General Jeffrey Amestoy said he was pleased
with the court's decision.
   ``What you had here was somebody intending to sell drugs who got
caught,'' Amestoy said. ``It's clear from the court's opinion that
the legal arguments of the defendant were without bearing.''
   Kathleen Sullivan, a Harvard Law School professor who
represented Zaccaro during the appeal, said the main issue in the
appeal was the entry into Zaccaro's home by an undercover state
trooper.
   ``We're very disappointed that the Vermont Supreme Court didn't
realize the importance of protecting the home from undercover
searches,'' Sullivan said. ``This is something that affects all the
citizens of the state of Vermont.''
   Sullivan also disagreed with the court's ruling on the selective
prosecution issue.
   ``We all know that John Zaccaro would have been in less trouble
if he had not been the son of a famous lady,'' Sullivan said.
   Sullivan said the family had not yet determined whether further
legal action will be taken.
   Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury College, was arrested Feb.
20, 1986, at his Middlebury home after selling $25 worth of cocaine
to an undercover Vermont State Trooper. The trooper, a woman, had
been invited into Zaccaro's home by his roommate.
   Zaccaro was convicted of possession and sale of a regulated drug
in April 1988 and sentenced to one-to-five years in prison.
   In claiming that he was the victim of selective prosecution,
Zaccaro said other Middlebury College students had been caught
using cocaine but had not been prosecuted. Testimony revealed that
those students had been caught by Middlebury College authorities
who did not release the information to police.
   ``Defendant here has failed to meet his burden of showing that
others who were similarly situated were not prosecuted,'' the
justices said.
   The court also denied Zaccaro's claims that his right to a fair
trial was violated when the district court allowed testimony based
on suppressed evidence, and that the judge's instructions to the
jury on entrapment were erroneous.
   Zaccaro actually served three months under house arrest. The
sentence was criticized when it became known Zaccaro was serving
the sentence in a $1,500-a-month Burlington apartment with maid
service.
   Zaccaro also completed more than 500 hours of community service
by working at the King Street Youth Center for troubled youth.
   His mother was the 1984 Democratic vice-presidential nominee.
