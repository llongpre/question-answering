<LEADPARA>  THE FROSTED blond hair has gone to gray, her face is more deeply lined and
there's a subtle barrier, a distance, between Geraldine Ferraro and the
well-wishers who crowd around her these days.;   But when it comes to letting
the old boys have it, especially the Republicans who tormented Ferraro during
her 1984 run for the vice presidency, the homemaker from Queens who made
history is remarkably unchanged.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Lemme tell ya, there's a vicious rumor about me going around," she tells a
group of business and professional women on a blustery morning. "They say I
have my eyes on Sen. Al D'Amato's seat.";   Pause.;   "I don't have my eyes on
his seat. It's his job that I want.";   The cheering crowd in a hotel banquet
room rises to its feet, and Ferraro is rolling once again. A hero and role
model to many women present, she's attempting a political comeback from the
ashes of her disastrous national campaign. And nobody is counting her out.;  
On a hot summer night seven years ago, Ferraro became the first woman in
history to be nominated for the vice presidency. Based largely on that
memorable event, she continues to enjoy a political celebrity few can match.
Although the New York Senate election is almost a year away, her battle to
unseat D'Amato, a two-term GOP incumbent, is drawing enthusiastic crowds.;  
So far, however, Ferraro has been preaching to the choir. The people begging
for autographs these days don't seem too concerned about questions of ethical
impropriety that dogged her vice presidential campaign, even though they are
likely to be raised in 1992. She has yet to face an ugly crowd -- the kind
that derided her support for abortion rights and insulted members of her
family.;   Those scars have not yet healed, and the 1991 Ferraro is a warier
political creature. She is less trusting of the press this time around and can
be impatient with slow questioners at political events. Determined to protect
her privacy, she has nonetheless put herself under the microscope again.;   
AT SOME point, Ferraro agrees, she will have to face the past: old questions
about her husband's real estate deals, whispered allegations of his mob ties,
her son's conviction for attempted sale of cocaine and charges that she
mishandled her finances as a three-term congresswoman. But for now, there is
no mistaking the excitement and feeling of rebirth surrounding her senatorial
race, especially when she speaks to women's groups.;   "I was thinking about
the unemployment bill that President Bush vetoed (this summer)," Ferraro told
the Syracuse crowd. "And then I realized, he probably thinks that if Clarence
Thomas can get a job, anybody can get a job.";   The audience applauds,
cheering her digs at the all-white, all-male Senate Judiciary Committee that
debated Thomas' nomination for the U.S. Supreme Court. But the biggest
applause comes for a line she uses in every speech.;   "Women in this country
have a feeling they've been had," she said. "And I'll be damned if I'm going
to let the '90s go down as the decade in which the Soviets won their rights
and American women lost theirs.";   "You have to understand, this woman
changed my life," said Virginia Hundt, a businesswoman who is running for a
local office next year and who has been waiting 30 minutes to have her picture
taken with Ferraro.;   "She showed women that they could make a difference on
the national political level, and she's a tremendous inspiration to us all."; 
 Others are more skeptical. Across the room, Mary Carswell, a deputy airport
manager, agrees that Ferraro is a historic figure and not just another
political big shot. Still, Carswell wonders why the candidate would again put
herself through the torture of public examination: "I wouldn't change places
with her for the world. Who needs the punishment? Why do it again?";   Indeed,
some critics dismiss Ferraro's campaign as an exercise in nostalgia,
predicting that she cannot win a hotly contested Democratic primary next year
against three other candidates. The formidable field includes New York
Attorney General Robert Abrams, New York City Comptroller Elizabeth Holzman
and Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y.;   But a recent Buffalo News poll had good news
for Ferraro. Taken after the Thomas hearings, it showed her leading Abrams 40
percent to 38 percent, with Holzman and Mrazek far behind.;    YET EVEN if she
wins the primary, critics say, D'Amato could make mincemeat of her. They
believe Ferraro, weighted by her own baggage, is the only Democratic candidate
who could not credibly attack D'Amato for political corruption.;   The senator
has been stung by charges of malfeasance over the allocation of federal
housing funds in his district and is plummeting in the polls. Although he was
exonerated by the Senate ethics committee, D'Amato is believed vulnerable in
1992, especially to a squeaky-clean candidate.;   "The point is, Ferraro's
vulnerable too," said a veteran Republican campaign consultant who asked not
to be identified. "Voters will remember her problems, and if they don't
remember, they'll certainly be reminded.";   If she is bothered by the
conventional wisdom, however, Ferraro doesn't show it. Do the fellas want to
play rough? She'll play rough.;   "I won't let anyone get away with attacking
me," she said, settling in for a long drive from Syracuse to her next
political event, in Albany, N.Y. "If somebody hits me, my response (in a TV
spot) will be in the can. I don't run away from a fight. I'm a fighter."  </TEXT>
