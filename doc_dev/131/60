   John Sasso, who resigned as Michael Dukakis' top
aide after embarrassing his boss with an ``attack video'' aimed at
a rival candidate, is still in contact with the Democratic
front-runner, and some predict he would have a top job in a Dukakis
White House.
   ``Mike and I are good friends, and, as he has said, we still
talk from time to time, discuss things,'' Sasso said in a brief
telephone conversation this week. ``But I have no active role with
the campaign.''
   He wouldn't say what he and Dukakis discuss, except that their
talks include campaign-related issues. He said the two have not
discussed potential running mates for Dukakis, the Democratic
front-runner.
   Aides say Sasso is in weekly contact with the candidate. Sasso,
however, has no formal role in the campaign.
   ``This is the way it has to be,'' Sasso said.
   Now working at a Boston advertising and public relations firm,
Sasso declined further comment, saying he is not granting
interviews about the campaign.
   He resigned his job as manager of the Dukakis campaign after
admitting he gave reporters a videotape that showed Democratic
rival Joseph Biden giving a speech patterned on one by British
politician Neil Kinnock, without giving Kinnock credit.
   That _ along with revelations that Biden had exaggerated his
academic record _ eventually drove the Delaware senator to drop out
of the race.
   The incident caused a furor, and became an issue in the primary
campaign. Former Democratic candidate Richard Gephardt, in a
last-ditch drive before the Super Tuesday contacts, put an ad on
the air that said, in part, ``Mike Dukakis smeared Joe Biden ...
and now he's attempting to smear Dick Gephardt.''
   Dukakis is known for his caution and aides say there has been no
discussion of bringing Sasso back into the campaign.
   If Dukakis were the Democratic nominee running against George
Bush, Sasso's presence in the campaign could hamper any Dukakis
effort to bring up the so-called ``sleaze factor'' _ the long list
of Reagan administration officials accused of wrongdoing.
   But some Dukakis aides say privately that they would not be
surprised to see Sasso back at Dukakis' side if he won the November
election, perhaps as White House chief of staff.
   Dukakis and Sasso have a long history together, and Sasso has
helped see Dukakis through some dark days. Sasso helped Dukakis
return from political exile four years after he was voted out of
the governor's office in 1978.
   Dukakis met Sasso a few days after that 1978 loss, keeping a
promise he had made to assist a referendum drive that Sasso
managed. Sasso, impressed that Dukakis had kept his word despite
the crushing defeat, offered to help Dukakis if he ever ran for
office again.
   He managed Dukakis' successful 1982 gubernatorial campaign and
became Dukakis' chief aide at the statehouse, where he was credited
with helping the governor mend fences with legislators and interest
groups alienated in his first term.
   Sasso, who took a leave from his statehouse post to manage
Geraldine Ferraro's unsuccessful 1984 vice presidential campaign,
was among the first to urge Dukakis to run for president. He
brought in veterans from Ferraro's staff and that of former Vice
President Walter Mondale when he assembled the Dukakis campaign.
   The ``attack video'' incident was particularly embarrassing
because it came at a time when Dukakis was urging rivals in the
then-crowded Democratic field to wage positive campaigns.
   To compound the problem, Sasso acknowledged his role in the
episide only after Dukakis said publicly he did not believe his
campaign was responsible for distributing the tapes.
   And Dukakis appeared indecisive after Sasso's admission, at
first saying he did not want to fire him. Finally, though, he
acknowledged that ``John has to go.''
   Sasso's assistant, Susan Estrich, was promoted to campaign
manager.
   Estrich, who worked with Sasso in 1984 and is a member of the
Democratic National Committee, also consults periodically with her
friend and former boss.
   ``I chat with him occassionally about how things are going,''
Estrich said. ``But I think John realizes that the strength of this
campaign is the candidate.''
