   The Sun, Bremerton, Wash., on the resignation of Attorney
General Meese:
   The last crony is leaving. Months, even years after propriety
demanded it, Ed Meese says he'll resign _ sometime.
   Whatever conservative legacy he left the Justice Department and
the courts is overshadowed by his cheapening of the office of
attorney general and the chaos now paralyzing Justice. ...
   Meese has managed to slip through the net in four
investigations, because the evidence against him always was
circumstantial. It just happened that cronies who did favors for
Meese soon ended up with lucrative government contracts, or federal
jobs or other special favors.
   The best Meese's investigators could find was impropriety, not
illegality. Yet the attorney general took the lack of charges as a
ringing endorsement of his innocence. ...
   Meese is a deal-maker, a hustler. He never understood that the
attorney general can't use his office to create a personal pork
barrel. ...
   Does Meese leave any legacy except sleaze? ...
   He tried to weaken the Miranda Rule and abortion rights before a
Supreme Court that was prepared to do neither. He embarked on an
anti-pornography crusade, an odd priority for someone whose mission
also includes fighting organized crime. He botched the early stages
of the Iran-Contra probe, perhaps deliberately.
   Yet, Meese has shown one thing. An attorney general's politics
are not as important as his credibility, his honesty and his
ability to lead. After three years with a laughingstock for a
leader, Justice needs an attorney general of high personal
reputation. But the department must wait for the next
administration to provide one.

   Kennebec Journal, Augusta, Maine, on the resignation of Attorney
General Meese III:
   The remarks by outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese III prove
once again that he and others in the Reagan administration have
completely missed the point.
   Meese announced his resigtation ..., not in Washington but at a
news conference on the West Coast. That followed the filing of an
830-page report from Indpendent Counsel James McKay which will
apparently not bring any indictments against the 56-year-old Meese.
   That, says the nation's highest law enforcement officer, is a
vindication that will allow him to leave office with allegations of
wrongdoing behind him.
   Baloney. This is the same idiotic assertion we've heard all
along, that it somehow would be morally wrong to quit the office
until justice had run its course. ...
   By staying as long as he did, Meese placed himself above the
interests of the agency he managed and above the interests of
national law enforcement.
   His departure is great news for the nation, which at least now
has the chance to get a fully functional Justice Department. That
wasn't going to happen with Ed Meese aboard.

   The Weirton (W.Va.) Daily Times on the drug sentencing of John
Zaccaro Jr., son of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro:
   John Zaccaro Jr., the son of former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferrarro, was surprised when he was sentenced to four
months for selling cocaine.
   However, and obviously to the surprise of no one, Zaccaro gained
approval to serve his sentence under house arrest. And, hardly a
ripple of a protest from the prosecutor!
   It's obvious that who you know or who you are remain deciding
factors in our society.

   The Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tenn., on the federal proposal
for notice of plant closings:
   Polls show that most Americans favor laws requiring companies to
give advance notice before they close plants _ such as the bill
passed by Congress but vetoed by President Reagan.
   Those Americans should consider what one executive calls ``the
industry with the most elaborate federally imposed
advance-notification requirements:'' the railroads.
   Under the Interstate Commerce Act, a railroad has to inform
union officials months before it closes a line, get their consent
to an ``implementing agreement'' and guarantee generous severance
payments to any employees laid off.
   But from 1947 to the present, railroad employment has dropped
from 1.3 million to 230,000. During that same period, total U.S.
employment has soared.
   One can hardly ask for a clearer demonstration: It is not
government regulation that keeps workers on the job, but vigorous
competition in the private sector.

   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on congressional pay raises:
   How much is your congressman or senator worth? Opinions vary,
but each year Congress has a battle over whether to raise its
salary.
   Recently the House voted a 4 percent increase for federal
employees but exempted members of Congress and other top officials.
   Now Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., has come up with a plan that
seems daffy but could be valuable. Members of Congress would be
able to choose a salary between the current $89,500 and the
$135,000 last recommended by the federal pay commission, but could
not keep any honoraria for speeches to trade associations and other
groups.
   Voters would decide in the next election whether the congressman
is worth it. Rep. Rostenkowski thinks the plan would eliminate much
of the hypocrisy that accompanies the annual debate over salaries,
especially when votes are called on pay increases.
   Some congressmen are underpaid and others are overpaid. The
Rostenkowski plan would let members judge the value of their
service and then, a few months thereafter, allow constituents to
cast the judgment that really counts. Makes sense to us.
