   A jury was selected Thursday in the trial of
John Zaccaro Jr. after four days of questions about attitudes
towards drugs and the prominence of the defendant's mother, former
vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro.
   Zaccaro, 24, is charged with selling one-quarter gram of cocaine
to an undercover agent. Opening arguments in the case are scheduled
for Friday morning, and attorneys said the trial could last three
days.
   The 12 jurors and two alternates were selected from more than 60
Rutland area residents, who were also questioned about their
attitudes toward undercover police work.
   Among those dismissed was a man who described people interested
in police work as fascist.
   District Court Judge Francis McCaffrey had initially refused to
dismiss the potential juror, Christopher Mayka, on Wednesday,
despite objections from the prosecutor.
   Under questioning, Mayka had said, ``I have often felt that some
people who get into police work have sort of a fascist background.
They like to have power.''
   On Thursday, Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn renewed
the argument, telling the judge that Mayka ``has preconceived
notions about police officers. He feels police officers generally
are on power trips.''
   The feelings about police are important in the case because the
defense wants to show that Zaccaro was entrapped by an undercover
police officer acting only on a rumor that Zaccaro might be selling
drugs.
   Jury selection was prolonged by the wide publicity given the
case. Most potential jurors said they were aware of the case,
prompting lawyers to repeatedly ask whether this knowledge would
affect their deliberations.
   Only one juror was dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Ferraro could affect his view.
   Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., were present for the
questioning.
