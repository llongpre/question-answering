<HEAD>League of Women Voters Campaigning for Debates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The League of Women Voters has started a
postcard-writing campaign to try to get the 1988 presidential
candidates to debate under its sponsorship.
   Two postcards, one addressed to Republican George Bush and one
to Democrat Michael Dukakis, are being sent to league members with
an accompanying letter from Nancy Neuman, chairwoman of the group's
education fund.
   ``The shameless attempt by the two parties to `steal' the
debates threatens more than the league,'' the letter said. ``It
threatens the voters.''
   The group has sponsored presidential debates since 1976, but
this year has been fighting with the Democratic and Republican
parties which are holding their own debates.
   Dan Schnur, a Bush spokesman, said, ``We will wait and see what
the two parties decide. We are not closing any options.''
   ``I know we are committed to the Democratic National Committee
and Republican National Committee debates,'' said Steve Akey, a
Dukakis spokesman. ``At this point that is all we have committed
to.''

<HEAD>Former Candidate Shirley Chisholm Says Gender Gap Could Disappear</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Even though polls show most women favoring
Democrat Michael Dukakis over Republican George Bush in the
presidential race, former candidate for president Shirley Chisholm
says female voters should not be taken for granted.
   ``We're not as monolithic as led to believe,'' the former
Brooklyn congresswoman told a National Organization for Women
conference this weekend.
   ``You constantly talk about being 53 percent of the vote, but if
you are unable to deliver that, you will be ignored,'' she said.
   Chisholm said there was similar talk of a gender gap in 1984
when the Republican ticket of Ronald Reagan and George Bush handed
the Democratic ticket of Walter Mondale and Geraldine Ferraro a
disastrous defeat.
   ``Many women, particularly southern women, couldn't identify
with Ferraro,'' she said. ``We've got ask why and learn from our
mistakes.''
   She warned against single-issue ``litmus tests'' such as
abortion.
   ``You can't use one issue as a litmus test,'' she said. ``You
can't be that emotional about politics.''

<HEAD>Democrats Confront Problems As Clock Toward Convention Winds Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although problems remain in setting up the
Democratic National Convention, those who will be covering next
month's event say the snags probably won't be seen by the millions
of voters who will be watching on television.
   ``The fact is we have to be ready for the event because they
aren't going to delay it for us,'' said Jane Maxwell, the Cable
News Network's vice president for special events.
   Ms. Maxwell and her counterpart at CBS, David Buksbaum, gave
convention organizers good marks for helping with television
coverage. The complaints from news organizations center on
off-the-floor matters, especially housing.
   ``Hotel rooms are really a problem,'' said NBC producer Phil
Alongi, who said the network has received only a few rooms in
downtown hotels.
   ``I just can't find enough words to describe how much trouble
they're going to be in,'' said Mary Pat Clark, the office manager
of the Los Angeles Times' Washington bureau, who said housing
arrangements started much later in Atlanta than in previous
convention cities.
