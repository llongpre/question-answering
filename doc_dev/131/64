   An attractive, inexperienced undercover
police officer entrapped John Zaccaro Jr. into selling her cocaine,
Zaccaro's lawyer told jurors today.
   Zaccaro, the son of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro, is on trial in Vermont District Court on allegations he
illegally sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to the officer two years
ago. Zaccaro was a senior at Middlebury College at the time.
   Charles Tetzlaff, Zaccaro's lawyer, told jurors in his opening
statement this morning that the defense doesn't dispute the sale,
but does challenge the police actions.
   ``The defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a
regulated drug,'' Tetzlaff said. ``This is a case of improper and
overzealous police conduct.''
   Tetzlaff said ``an attractive female police officer'' who had
never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped Zaccaro
into making the sale.
   John Quinn, the prosecutor, conceded in his opening arguments
that the undercover agent was inexperienced, but he asked jurors to
keep in mind that the Middlebury Police Department is a low-budget,
small-town operation.
   Quinn also urged jurors not to be swayed by Tetzlaff's attacks
on the police. ``I'd ask you to focus on what the charge is,'' he
said. ``Don't let anybody put anybody else on trial other than the
defendant.''
   Opening arguments came after four days of jury selection, a task
slowed by the wide publicity given the case and the celebrity
status of Ferraro.
   The jurors are being sequestered to help ensure they avoid press
accounts of the trial.
   The trial could last into Tuesday, said Quinn, adding that the
four days of jury selection was unusual for Vermont.
   ``Until this week, the longest I ever took to draw a jury was an
hour and a half,'' he said Thursday. ``It's unusual for a case to
get this kind of publicity.''
   Lawyers for both sides have questioned jurors on their feelings
about drugs, undercover police work and the prominence of Ferraro.
   Police said they began their investigation of Zaccaro, now 24,
after hearing he was dealing drugs. He is charged with selling
one-quarter gram of cocaine to the undercover police officer in his
off-campus apartment.
   Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., have sat together
behind their son during the proceedings.
   Ferraro, a lawyer, took an active role during the questioning of
jurors. She has held in her lap the jurors' questionnaires and has
repeatedly written suggestions on index cards, which she tossed in
front of Tetzlaff during the questioning.
