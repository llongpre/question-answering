   American and Soviet women have made gains in
the workplace but remain concentrated in lower-paying jobs as they
struggle to balance family and career, speakers at a U.S.-Soviet
conference said Tuesday.
   ``We really have differences in the status of women in our
societies, but all in all, I think we have more problems in common
than differences,'' said former vice presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro.
   Ms. Ferraro, actress Marlo Thomas and a Soviet expert spoke on
women's issues at the Fifth General Chautauqua Conference on
U.S.-Soviet Relations.
   Ms. Thomas said American women once were relegated to keeping
house or holding low-paying jobs.
   ```Ah, those were the days,' sigh certain Americans,'' she said.
``Unfortunately some of them are in the Congress or the Capitol.''
   Soviet women comprise about 52 percent of the work force in that
country, said Alevtina V. Fedulova, first deputy chairman of the
Committee of Soviet Women, a non-governmental group of women's
councils.
   Women comprise 44 percent of the American work force, Ms.
Ferraro said.
   Mrs. Fedulova said many Soviet women make less than men because
they tend to hold jobs requiring less skill and, even in more
skilled professions, advance more slowly than men.
   ``Men get better wages because given ... the same educational
background men have a higher professional status,'' she said.
   Mrs. Fedulova said women have made strides in the fields of
medicine, education and electronics. Sixty-seven percent of the
Soviet's physicians are women, she said.
   On another subject, Mrs. Fedulova said access to sex education
and contraceptives must improve in the Soviet Union, where abortion
is the main means of birth control.
   ``The situation with contraceptives in the U.S.S.R is as bad as
the situation with computers ... that is very bad,'' said Fedulova.
``Contraceptives are not widely available.''
   Western experts have estimated the average Soviet woman has nine
abortions during her childbearing years.
   ``We have to educate people,'' Mrs. Fedulova said in an
interview through an interpreter. ``What we really need to make the
woman understand is the need to preserve her health, and at the
same time she should have the resources to do that.''
   ``Abortion is not a benefit to any woman because it is a blow to
her health,'' Mrs. Fedulova said. ``A woman should be taught to
avoid abortion.''
   About 200 Soviet delegates, including 20 Soviet journalists, are
attending the conference, which is sponsored by the University of
Pittsburgh and Chautauqua Institution in western New York.
   In another conference session Tuesday, a Soviet scientist and
American official called for increased cooperation between the two
countries to fight global warming, depletion of the Earth's ozone
layer and other environmental problems.
   ``The world has no time left to solve these problems,'' said
Boris N. Laskorin, deputy director of the All-Union Scientific
Research Institute of Chemical Technology.
   Alan Hecht, deputy assistant administrator of the Environmental
Protection Agency's Office of International Activities, said
improved relations between the two countries already has resulted
in joint projects.
