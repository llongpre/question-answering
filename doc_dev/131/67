   Prominent women from Gloria Steinem to Martina
Navratilova to Geraldine Ferraro say they are worried about a
backlash against Hedda Nussbaum from those who believe she shares
the blame for the death of Lisa Steinberg.
   ``Blaming victims will not save their lives,'' says a statement
they signed along with actresses Roseanne Barr and Colleen Dewhurst,
singer Judy Collins, writer Joyce Carol Oates and some 300 others.
   Organizers planned to present the statement Friday when Joel
Steinberg is sentenced for first-degree manslaughter in the death of
6-year-old Lisa, the girl he raised with his battered companion, Ms.
Nussbaum.
   Lisa, who was illegally obtained at birth by Steinberg from an
unwed teen-ager, was removed comatose from the couple's apartment on
Nov. 2, 1987, and died of a brain injury three days later.
   Prosecutors originally charged both Steinberg and Ms. Nussbaum in
the death, but later dropped charges against the woman when they
concluded she was too badly battered herself to have saved the
child. Ms. Nussbaum has been hospitalized for physical and mental
problems for most of the time since Lisa's death, and she became a
key witness against Steinberg at his trial.
   ``We're concerned about the rising backlash ... which says Hedda
Nussbaum got away with something,'' said novelist Lois Gould, who
drafted the statement in the face of controversy over Ms. Nussbaum's
role.
   Ms. magazine carried a a variety of views on the dispute in its
April edition, including an essay by author Susan Brownmiller, who
said, ``Many of us old-warrior feminists who followed the case from
the beginning thought that Nussbaum should have been standing trial
as well, for reckless endangerment of a child, at least.''
   Those who signed the statement argued that whether or not Ms.
Nussbaum was culpable, the controversy could divert attention from
battered women who genuinely need help.
   ``I got into an argument with a woman defense lawyer and two
female judges about this. Even these people, who should know better,
don't understand that Hedda Nussbaum was a victim,'' said Ms.
Ferraro, the former congresswoman and vice presidential candidate.
   ``We don't know how to deal with these women yet,'' said Ms.
Ferraro, who prosecuted both child abusers and wife-beaters when she
was an assistant district attorney. ``They are all people who have
been preyed upon and who find themselves in a situation they cannot
get out of; they are generally misunderstood.''
   The statement says the Steinberg case ``has forced open the door
between family violence and our conscience as a civilized society.''
   It calls for help for women to escape family violence; methods to
stop men from beating women and children; and acknowledgement of the
``enormous social and economic toll'' of domestic violence. It said
women and children fleeing violence account for 40 percent of the
city's homeless.
   ``This letter is done to remind people there are very few escape
hatches for women who try to flee: no funding, few services,'' said
Phyllis Chesler, a psychologist and author.
   ``Rather than blame one woman because we may disagree with her,
(the letter) reaffirms the larger point: Our duty is to protect
women and children from being battered and help them escape, rather
than to discuss, `In what ways is she really to blame?'' Ms. Chesler
said.
