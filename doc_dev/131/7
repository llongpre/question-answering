<HEADLINE>  DAUGHTER SAYS FERRARO WILL RUN FOR U.S. SENATE  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     State Democratic Chairman John Marino said Ferraro told him Wednesday of
her plan.;    Ferraro is the only woman ever to run on a major party's
national ticket. The losing slate was led by former Vice President Walter
Mondale.;    Zaccaro said Ferraro wouldn't make a formal announcement for the
Democratic nomination until later this year.;    D'Amato said he was confident
he would win a third six-year Senate term in the 1992 election.;    D'Amato is
under investigation on allegations that relatives, friends and major campaign
contributors received special treatment in seeking federal development
grants.;    Ferraro is expected to face a tough fight for the Democratic
nomination. State Attorney General Robert Abrams already has announced he will
run, and Rep. Robert Mrazek of Long Island also has expressed an interest.;   
Other potential Democratic candidates include Elizabeth Holtzman, the New York
City comptroller who lost a three-way race to D'Amato in 1980; and Mark Green,
the New York City consumer affairs commissioner who lost to D'Amato in 1986.  </TEXT>
