   Michael Dukakis has a passion for order, but
choosing a vice presidential candidate is proving anything but an
orderly process he can carry out with a minimum of public scrutiny.
   Not until he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination on
June 7 would Dukakis even discuss the process by which he would
choose a running mate and then it was only to say it would be ``a
good, thoughtful, deliberative process.''
   But with interviews in Boston on Tuesday and Wednesday of three
prospective running mates, the Dukakis search began to resemble the
parade to North Oaks, Minn., four years ago when Walter F. Mondale
was looking for someone to complete the Democratic ticket.
   Looking back on his experience, Mondale conceded that ``I don't
think it built confidence.''
   The 1984 Democratic nominee suggested that Dukakis ``pursue a
different way of looking at vice presidential candidates.'' And
Dukakis started out determined to take Mondale's advice. Campaign
aides were forbidden to talk about the process.
   Dukakis did avoid the biggest Mondale mistake _ his
determination to make it clear he was considering women as well as
men, blacks as well as whites. The Mondale list included three
women, among them the final choice, Rep. Geraldine Ferraro of New
York, two blacks and a Hispanic and one white male.
   While it was, as Mondale would say ``not a bad idea,'' it
reinforced the perception that he was too eager to cater to various
special interest groups.
   Ironically, Mondale's history-making choice all but guaranteed
that the Democratic vice presidential candidate this year would be
a white male.
   ``I'm going to cast my net far and wide,'' said the
Massachusetts governor. ``Nobody's ruled in, nobody's ruled out,''
was a favorite response to questions about whether this or that
individual was under consideration.
   The first major leak was that Dukakis had all but settled on
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey for the No. 2 spot on the ticket.
   Dukakis quashed that report with a statement saying that only he
and confidant Paul Brountas, the lawyer in charge of the search,
could speak with any authority about who might be in or out of
contention.
   But if Dukakis seriously believed he could control the
information about how he was going about choosing a running mate,
he underestimated the intensity of the scrutiny it would undergo as
well as the impossibility of muzzling Jesse Jackson.
   The first indication of who were the serious contenders for the
No. 2 spot came when Brountas began asking individuals for detailed
personal and financial information.
   Inevitably, names began to come out. Among the first were Sens.
Bob Graham of Florida and John Glenn of Ohio.
   The Dukakis campaign must have known that those names would come
out.
   Less predictable and more embarrassing was that at the same time
there were leaks of the names of prospects who had turned him down
_ Bradley and Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia and House Majority Leader
Tom Foley of Washington.
   When Dukakis visited the Capitol last week for a day of meetings
with members of Congress, he eluded reporters most of the day but
then told them he had met individually with Graham, Glenn, Nunn and
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas. Nunn later said he had told the
governor he was not interested.
   But those amounted to the first of the interviews.
   Traveling to Boston this week were Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of
Tennessee and Reps. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Lee Hamilton
of Indiana. Gephardt and Hamilton told reporters they would happily
accept an offer to run with Dukakis. Gore ducked all questions.
   The entire process has been played out to background music
provided by Jackson who has insisted he deserves consideration for
the vice presidential nomination.
   He called the other contenders ``unknown quantities'' and
suggested that his qualifications were far more impressive.
   At the same time, Jackson wouldn't say if he'd accept the job if
offered. At one point he said he'd made up his mind but had told no
one, including Dukakis of his decision.
