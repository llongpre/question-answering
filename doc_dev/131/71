   The son of former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro will begin a four-month sentence for
selling a quarter-gram of cocaine Friday after gaining preliminary
approval to serve it under house arrest.
   John Zaccaro Jr. was sentenced two weeks ago, but the sentence
was stayed 30 days pending appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court. If
an appeal had been granted, it may have been a year or more before
the court decided the case.
   But in a surprise move, Zaccaro's lawyers dropped the request
for the stay and asked that Zaccaro, 24, begin serving his sentence
Friday. Judge Francis McCaffrey agreed, deputy court clerk Kathy
Moore said Thursday.
   Zaccaro probably will spend his first 24 hours in maximum
security at Chittenden Community Correctional Center in South
Burlington, standard procedure for new inmates, said Addison County
State's Attorney John Quinn.
   McCaffrey, in sentencing Zaccaro to four months in jail, had
suggested he be allowed to participate in a new state program under
which he would live in a Corrections Department-approved apartment
and could leave only with permission.
   Corrections Department spokesman John Perry said Zaccaro had
gained preliminary approval for the program. Ordinarily, people
accepted into the program check in at the jail and then begin their
sentence, Perry said.
   The program is open to non-violent offenders sentenced to four
months in jail in less. To be accepted, they must be screened by
parole and probation officials, who make the decision along with
the Corrections Department.
   Under the program, Zaccaro could begin the 300 hours of
community service his sentence entails. The judge fined Zaccaro
$1,500 as well.
   Zaccaro was arrested two years ago on charges of selling $25
worth of cocaine to an undercover officer at Middlebury College,
where he was a student. Trooper Laura Manning testified she went to
Zaccaro's off-campus home and inquired about buying cocaine. She
said Zaccaro produced a tray of cocaine packets from underneath a
sofa. Zaccaro was arrested later that night.
   Defense attorney Charles Tetzlaff claimed Zaccaro had been
entrapped by a pretty woman. The defense also had contended Zaccaro
was singled out for prosecution because of his famous mother.
