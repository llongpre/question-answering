   In bringing John Sasso back to his campaign
Michael Dukakis, locked in an increasingly tough fight for the
presidency with George Bush, turned to his trusted corner man, the
alter-ego with whom he has fought _ and won _ many a battle before.
   The most telling remark about their relationship came from
Dukakis himself last year at their worst moment, when the governor
and then-longshot presidential candidate described his departing
campaign manager as ``like a brother.''
   Last week's announcement of his return as campaign vice chairman
immediately energized a campaign headquarters full of staffers
reading reports their effort was moribund.
   ``Now we've got the A-team,'' said Dukakis campaign issues
adviser Thomas Herman, a former Dukakis state aide brought into
that job by Sasso. ``There's no question that John is as close to
Michael Dukakis as anyone else is.''
   Dukakis and Sasso met on a train platform in 1978 shortly after
Dukakis suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of Edward J.
King in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. Sasso, so impressed
that Dukakis kept a commitment to attend an event he had organized,
offered his assistance should Dukakis decide to venture back into
politics.
   Mindful of that promise, Dukakis in 1980 asked Sasso to manage
his 1982 comeback effort against King, a bruising campaign that
included an incident not unlike the ``attack video'' episode that
drove Delware Sen. Joseph Biden from the presidential race and
Sasso from the Dukakis presidential campaign.
   Sasso played for reporters what became known as the ``sex tape''
_ a parody that made fun of the King's wife's struggle against
polio. That same campaign included a Dukakis television ad in which
a supporter was shown cheering on Dukakis and referring to King as
a ``son of a bitch.''
   Dukakis won the nasty primary battle and coasted to victory in
the fall. Back in office, he installed Sasso as his chief secretary
_ his top liason with legislators who wanted little to do with
Dukakis in his first term.
   ``He's the hit man,'' said former House Minority Leader Royall
Switzler. ``John is the guy behind the scenes for Dukakis and has
proven himself to be the master of dirty tricks,'' said Switzler,
adding that it was Sasso who would negotiate legislative deals for
Dukakis by threatening votoes of pet projects to win votes for
controversial matters backed by the governor.
   Dukakis loyalists disputed Switzler's characterizations.
   ``He believes in playing the game with vigor but with fairness
as well,'' said John DeVillars, Sasso's former deputy who remains
at his Statehouse post.
   Sasso, 41, also assumed a role he came to relish: handling the
governor's media relations. Dukakis never goes off the record with
a reporter; Sasso would do so frequently, steering reporters to
what he considered stories.
   It was in that role that he distributed to reporters videotapes
showing Biden borrowing without attribution the rhetoric of a
British politician, a story that began a flurry of negative reports
that forced Biden from the race.
   That Sasso, described by one Dukakis aide as ``the man with the
best instincts in the business,'' targeted Biden was no surprise.
Only Biden was rivaling Dukakis in early fund-raising among the
Democratic presidential candidates and was about to get major
publicity in his role as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
during hearings on President Reagan's nomination of Robert Bork to
the Supreme Court.
   Sasso's role with the Dukakis campaign was not his first venture
into presidential politics. He had been a field organizer for Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., in 1980 and also took a leave from
Dukakis' staff to manage Geraldine Ferraro's 1984 vice presidential
campaign.
   It was after the Walter Mondale-Ferraro ticket was defeated by
President Reagan that Sasso began promoting Dukakis as a 1988
presidential contender. Dukakis at first discouraged such talk,
asking Sasso and other aides to focus on his 1986 gubernatorial
re-election.
   In the midst of that campaign Sasso began drafting a memo
encouraging Dukakis to run, arguing that his record of achievement
in Massachusetts and optimistic approach was a winning combination
four years after charges of ``gloom and doom'' doomed Mondale.
   When Dukakis decided to run, he quickly installed Sasso as
campaign manager. Since his resignation last year, Sasso has spoken
to Dukakis frequently but has had no formal campaign role. He shied
away from reporters, and was described by friends as sullen,
unhappy on the sidelines.
   ``I'm delighted to be back as part of the general election
team,'' a beaming Sasso said Friday, ``because I've always been
committed to Michael Dukakis.''
