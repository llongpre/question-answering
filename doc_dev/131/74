   John Zaccaro Jr., convicted of selling a
quarter-gram of cocaine to an undercover officer, has won
preliminary approval to serve his four-month sentence beginning
today under house arrest.
   The son of former vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro
was to begin the sentence by 5 p.m.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn said Zaccaro might
spend his first 24 hours in a high security holding cell at the
Chittenden Community Correctional Center in South Burlington, a
standard procedure to keep new prisoners under observation.
   Zaccaro, 24, was sentenced two weeks ago, but the sentence was
stayed 30 days pending appeal to the Vermont Supreme Court. If an
appeal had been granted, it might have been a year or more before
the court decided the case.
   But Zaccaro's lawyers dropped the request for the stay and asked
that Zaccaro start serving his sentence today. Judge Francis
McCaffrey agreed, deputy court clerk Kathy Moore said Thursday.
   Corrections Department spokesman John Perry said Zaccaro had
gained preliminary approval for a new state program under which he
would live in a department-approved apartment and could leave only
with permission.
   Under the program, Zaccaro could begin the 300 hours of
community service his sentence entails. The judge fined Zaccaro
$1,500 as well.
