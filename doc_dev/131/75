   Fat briefing books are ready and surrogates
are primed, as Michael Dukakis and George Bush settle into four
days of intensive preparation for their first presidential campaign
debate.
   Between now and 8 p.m., EDT, Sunday, when they square off at
Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., Dukakis and Bush
will cram like college students.
   Each will field questions on a wide range of issues, their
answers weighed by political and media advisers.
   Richard G. Darman, former deputy treasury secretary, and Robert
Barnett, a Washington lawyer, were geared to assume their roles as
the opposition candidates in debate rehearsals.
   Darman, a protege of Bush campaign chairman James A. Baker III,
will play the role of Dukakis in mock debates that will probably
take place at the vice president's residence.
   Barnett has experience portraying Bush in debate rehearsals. He
helped prepare Geraldine Ferraro for her debate with the vice
president in October 1984.
   Thomas Donilon, a top official of Walter F. Mondale's campaign
four years ago, was coordinating debate preparation for Dukakis.
   Dukakis aides reviewed tapes of the Massachusetts governor's
debates with his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination,
as well as Bush's Republican debates and his confrontation in 1984
with Ferraro.
   A key element of the preparation for the first debate is the
effort to lower expectations.
   ``Dukakis is a good debater,'' Bush told reporters recently on
his campaign plane. ``He is a professional college debater and I'm
not.''
   Bush campaign manager Lee Atwater said, ``After all, he
(Dukakis) made a living debating on television professionally for a
couple of years ... Facts are facts. Dukakis' strongest suit is
debate format.''
   ``Remember, Bush has the experience of these debates, the '84
debate, which is the only relevant experience,'' said Leslie Dach,
a Dukakis campaign spokesman.
   During the Democratic and Republican primary season, both men
debated and for the most part came out ahead of their opponents.
   Bush was back in Washington. Except for a trip to Houston for a
$5 million fund-raising dinner on Thursday, the vice president
planned no other campaigning before the debate.
   Dukakis was in Boston also concentrating on debate preparation.
   Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey was flying to Boston on Thursday
to join the Dukakis debate preparation. The senator also was
expected to take part in sessions with Dukakis on Friday.
   ``He's being asked to input on substance and on strategy,'' said
Bradley spokesman Nick Donatiello.
   Dukakis has consulted Bradley frequently in recent months on
foreign policy and financial affairs.
   Bush was conferring with domestic affairs adviser Deborah
Steelman and foreign policy adviser Dennis Ross.
   While the candidates concentrated on the issues, their
representatives still argued over last minutes details such as the
makeup of the panel of questioners and the height of the podiums.
   Bush aides want the podiums to be 46 inches minimum; the Dukakis
camp was demanding a maximum height of 44 inches. The argument
reflected the fact that Bush is 6-foot-1, while Dukakis is
5-foot-8. Today's decision: Bush's podium will be 48 inches,
Dukakis' 41.
   As for the panel, the Dukakis staff proposed that television
anchors from ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN serve as the moderator and three
questioners for the first debate, with a panel of print journalists
filling those roles for either the vice presidential or the second
presidential debate.
   All sides agree that the first debate is the critical one, the
one that gives voters their first impression of the two candidates.
   ``The largest national audience of the campaign will focus on
and take the measure of these two people,'' said Paul Kirk Jr.,
Democratic Party chairman.
   ``Tens of millions of people are going to watch and they're
going to form their opinions by themselves,'' said Dach. ``In the
primary debates very few people watched and opinions were formed by
the next day's headlines.''
   Rich Bond, a senior Bush aide, said: ``You want to avoid costly
mistakes. And you want to come across as presidential.''
   In recent weeks, Bush has surged in the polls. Months earlier,
Dukakis had a big lead in the same surveys.
   If those fluctuating numbers are a sign of the volatility of the
electorate, the debate could be crucial.
