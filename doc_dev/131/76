   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   April 10
   The El Paso (Texas) Times on the income tax deadline:
   Why is midnight, April 15, the deadline for all income tax
returns?
   Remember the waits for state driver's licenses and vehicle
plates when every driver was required to get them by the same date.
Then someone proposed renewing licenses in the month of the
driver's birthday and plates in the month of the vehicle's original
purchase.
   Why can't that be done for income tax returns? Congress and the
Internal Revenue Service have made April 15 into National Trauma
Day. ...
   The U.S. Postal Service is overloaded, and overtime must be paid
to handle the crush of last-minute returns.
   Then, too, because of the single deadline, the IRS has hired
thousands of temporary workers, many of whom are giving faulty
answers to taxpayers. ...
   April 15 is a day dreaded by millions of people in this country.
It should not be. It would not be if the IRS and Congress would
figure out how to divide the taxpayers by 12 and make it a
year-round operation.

   Evening Express, Portland, Maine, on John Zaccaro Jr.'s cocaine
conviction:
   It was, perhaps, a typical mother's response to a son's
conviction on drug charges. She blamed herself, the police and
prosecutors.
   But this ``typical mother'' just happened to be a former
assistant district attorney, member of Congress and vice
presidential nominee: Geraldine Ferraro.
   At a news conference outside the Vermont District Court in
Rutland following her son John Zaccaro Jr.'s conviction for cocaine
peddling, Ferraro did fault her son for drug ``possession,'' but at
the same time blamed ``my candidacy for making my son a target.''
   She hinted that Vermont police ``set up'' her son because of her
role as the Democratic vice presidential nominee in 1984.
   Finally, Ferraro aimed her bitterest remarks at state prosecutor
John Quinn for rejecting a plea bargain arrangement. ...
   Ferraro's defensiveness about her son's drug-pushing may be
understandable in a loyal parent.
   But for someone who has served both as a lawmaker and a law
enforcer her attempts to pin the blame on others had a hollow and
self-serving ring.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon on Richard Nixon:
   Richard Nixon is at least consistent _ he still believes that
the presidency is an elected monarchy and all the president's
vassals should be pardoned from any crimes committed in service to
him.
   If President Reagan pardons (John M.) Poindexter and (Oliver L.)
North, he says to the country: ``I am the president. I am above the
law, and these men _ acting on what they thought were my directives
_ are above the law also.''
   It's unfortunate that Nixon learned so little from his forced
resignation in 1974. ...
   Almost 14 years after his departure from the Oval Office, Nixon
should understand by now the reason behind his fall from grace.

   The Baltimore Sun on trade trade-offs:
   The trade bill sluicing through Congress can be fairly compared
to raw sewage passing through a water treatment plant.
   At mid-stage in the process it is a good deal cleaner than when
it went in. But unless it is subjected to a lot more filtration, it
will not be fit for the law books.
   What President Reagan must guard against is the natural
inclination of Republican lawmakers to ``do something'' about
massive trade deficits lest they be clobbered by Democrats
preaching economic nationalism. ...
   As it stands now, Reagan should veto the trade bill. It dilutes
presidential authority by passing critical decisions affecting
relations with other nations to a cabinet-level trade
representative who could be badgered by Congress.
   And its disclosure provisions could scare off foreign investors
whose funds are needed to finance huge Reagan-era federal debts and
deficits.

   The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, Wash., on drugs:
   There's an important lesson for Americans traveling abroad in
the story of a 23-year-old Virginia free-lance photographer who was
sentenced in Spain ... to six years and one day in prison, plus an
$18,083 fine, on a drug-trafficking charge.
   The photographer, who has been held without bail since he was
arrested a year ago, says he is innocent, that he thought the
suitcase he was transporting for a Washington, D.C., travel agency
on a four-day assignment requiring a flight from Chile to Spain was
filled with travel brochures, not cocaine.
   Even if he were only an unwitting drug courier, the
free-lancer's story underscores a message that the U.S. State
Department says American tourists should take to heart: Travel
abroad warrants caution. ...
   In many countries, people caught with drugs in their possession,
no matter how small the amount, can be assured of one thing: hefty
penalties that will make them think two or three times before
trying that again _ when they finally get out, that is.
   That is something this country should be emulating.
