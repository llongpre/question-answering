   A man who believes some police officers have
a ``fascist'' background was dismissed today as a juror in the
cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr.
   Zaccaro, son of former Democratic vice-presidential nominee
Geraldine Ferraro, is charged with selling a small amount of
cocaine to an undercover police officer two years ago.
   On Wednesday, District Court Judge Francis McCaffrey had refused
to dismiss Christopher Mayka from the jury, despite objections from
the prosecutor about Mayka's comments on police.
   Under questioning, Mayka had said, ``I have often felt that some
people who get into police work have sort of a fascist background.
They like to have power.''
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn renewed the argument
today, telling the judge that Mayka ``has preconceived notions
about police officers.'' McCaffrey then agreed to dismiss Mayka.
   The feelings about police are important in the case because the
defense wants to show that Zaccaro, then a student at Middlebury
College, was entrapped by an undercover police officer acting only
on rumor.
   Lawyers had hoped to start opening arguments today, but the
dismissal of Mayka and slow questioning of replacements may delay
those arguments until Friday. Jury selection began Monday.
   Only one juror has been dismissed for acknowleging that the
prominence of Ferraro could affect his view of the case.
   But most said they were aware of the case, prompting the two
sides to repeatedly ask whether the jurors' deliberations would be
affected by what they know.
   Although both the state and the defense have said they were
fearful of the effect of the pre-trial publicity, many of the
potential jurors said they discounted what they had read, because
of a distrust of the press.
   ``They have a tendency to present people as guilty just because
they have been charged,'' said Donald Cioffi on Wednesday.
   Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., have attended the
questioning, which is taking place in the cramped chambers of the
presiding judge to put the potential jurors at ease.
   The process has shed some light on the strategies lawyers may
take in the trial.
   Addison County State's Attorney John Quinn has asked potential
jurors if they have any objections to police acting on rumors and
to the use of undercover police officers.
   Police said they began their investigation of Zaccaro after
hearing he was dealing drugs.
   Defense lawyer Charles Tetzlaff has asked jurors if they would
be willing to acquit someone based on a technical defect in the
state's case.
   The defense is expected to try to prove that Zaccaro was
entrapped by the police, and that the police singled him out
because of his famous mother.
