   Something about George Bush drives his
political opponents to wage class warfare against him.
   Democrat Geraldine Ferraro tried it in 1984 and Republican Bob
Dole used that approach during the 1988 GOP primaries.
   Now it's Michael Dukakis' turn.
   Here is how the Democratic presidential candidate describes the
difference between Bush and himself on education:
   ``Between those who believe that good education ought to be the
property of a few and those who believe it is the birthright of
every American, no matter who they are or where they come from or
what the color of their skin.''
   In a text of that speech distributed to reporters, the words
``property'' and ``few'' are underlined.
   Bush took note of the Dukakis approach when he accused his
Democratic opponent of pursuing ``a strategy of emphasizing
differences between rich and poor, between one region of the
country and another.''
   By now, Bush should be accustomed to that kind of attack.
   A product of privilege who grew up in the moneyed confines of
Greenwich, Conn., the son of a banker and U.S. senator, Bush became
the butt of jibes about his gee-whiz preppiness during the 1980
campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, a contest in
which his very Eastern image didn't stand up well against Westerner
Ronald Reagan.
   So often during the past eight years, Bush was seen publicly
struggling to shuck that image.
   ``This is the real me,'' he told reporters at Cuzzin Richie's
truckstop in Greenland, N.H., as he climbed into the cab of an
18-wheeler. ``This is my home turf.''
   Moments earlier, inside the wood-frame, single-story restaurant,
this patrician trucker had prepared to hit the road by ordering ``a
splash of tea.''
   Bush was in political trouble back then. The New Hampshire
primary was fast approaching and the vice president had just been
soundly whipped in Iowa by Republican rival Dole who relished
reminding crowds that ``I'm from Russell, Kan., and proud of it.''
   Then the senator would say, ``Getting where I've gotten wasn't
because of any wealth in my family or because I had a powerful
father or mother.''
   Ferraro also liked to cite her humble beginnings, her Italian
immigrant parents, and going to law school at night.
   Not long before she would debate Bush, the Democratic vice
presidential nominee joked that she'd seen his briefing book and
found the following lines: ``Gosh, gee whiz, zippidy doo dah, and
let's win, win, win.''
   Of course, Bush often provided the best material for his
opponents.
   He explained his defeat in a GOP straw poll one Saturday in
October 1987, this way:
   ``A lot of people that support me, they were off at the air
show, they were off at their daughter's coming-out party, or they
were off teeing up on the golf course.''
   Democratic strategists are convinced the Bush preppy image is a
good point of attack.
   ``The more he is viewed as this guy from a privileged background
from Yale, the better off we are,'' said Kam Kawata, a Democratic
consultant in California.
   ``Keep pounding away,'' was his advice.
   But so far, those who have attacked Bush on class grounds have
not had much success.
   Reagan whipped Bush in the GOP primaries in 1980, and to a
degree that was a contest between the dying Eastern Establishment
wing of the party and the conservative populists, personified first
by Barry Goldwater and then by Reagan.
   But once Reagan hit his stride in New Hampshire, that contest
was never in doubt. Reagan's hold on the hearts of Republican
rank-and-file voters was too strong for Bush to break. The issue
wasn't class, it was heartstrings.
   Ferraro, of course, was on the losing end of a 49-state
landslide.
   Dole hammered away at Bush's background to the very end of the
GOP campaign, but to no avail.
   It worked in Iowa, but not in New Hampshire, nor in the South,
where Bush swept the Super Tuesday primaries.
