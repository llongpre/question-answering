   A lawyer for John Zaccaro Jr. admitted
Friday that his client sold cocaine, but said the son of former
vice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro was tricked into
making the sale by an attractive female officer.
   Zaccaro is on trial in Vermont District Court on allegations he
illegally sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to the undercover officer
two years ago. The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years
in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   ``The defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold a
regulated drug,'' said Charles Tetzlaff in his opening statement
Friday. ``This is a case of improper and overzealous police
conduct.''
   Tetzlaff said ``an attractive female police officer'' who had
never before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped Zaccaro
into making the sale. He said it was the woman, not Zaccaro, who
brought up the subject of buying drugs.
   When she took the stand Friday, the officer, Laura Manning, was
asked what she said to Zaccaro when she came to his off-campus
apartment in February 1986. ``I said, `A couple of people told me
that you could sell me some coke.'''
   ``And what did he say?'' asked Addison County Prosecutor John
Quinn.
   ``Sure,'' Manning quoted Zaccaro as responding. She added, ``He
pulled a tray from under the couch.''
   Manning testified that the tray had on it about 15 packets of
cocaine in a plastic bag, with the packets marked by weight.
   When questioned by Tetzlaff on her apparel that day, Manning
said she was told to dress like a college student, and was wearing
an open jean jacket, a yellow V-neck sweater and jeans.
   She said she was hesitant to take the assignment because she had
never done an undercover job. She said she was given instructions
on what to wear and what to say.
   ``Did they tell you to ask for cocaine?'' Tetzlaff asked her.
   ``Yes,'' replied Manning.
   After Manning's testimony, the trial was adjourned until
Saturday.
   Quinn conceded in his opening argument that Manning was
inexperienced, but asked jurors to keep in mind that the Middlebury
Police Department is a low-budget, small-town operation.
   ``We don't have huge resources in the state,'' he said, adding
it was even difficult for police to come up with $30 for the
purchase.
   The prosecutor painted a picture of Zaccaro as a well-organized
drug dealer.
   He said that when Manning asked to buy cocaine, Zaccaro pulled a
tray from under his couch with 15 packets of the drug. ``When he
takes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the good
merchant that he is ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives it to
Manning, Quinn said.
   Quinn also said a detective began investigating Zaccaro after a
note was left on his desk with Zaccaro's name, address, car
registration and the words ``The Pharmacist.''
   Prosecutors and police have said Zaccaro was known at Middlebury
College as ``the pharmacist'' because of his reputation as a drug
dealer.
   The detective, David Wemette, was the first witness. He
testified he had first heard rumors of Zaccaro's drug dealing in
1984, but that he did not pursue them because Zaccaro left to help
his mother's campaign.
   Manning's drug buy came Feb. 20, 1986, at Zaccaro's off-campus
apartment. Zaccaro was arrested a few days later after police
searched his car and apartment.
   Opening arguments followed four days of jury selection, a task
slowed by wide publicity. Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro
Sr., have been sitting side by side behind their son in court.
   The jury is being sequestered to help ensure they avoid press
accounts of the trial.
