<HEAD>Ferraro: Jackson Won't Be Democratic Nominee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Democratic vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro says Jesse Jackson won't be the party's
presidential nominee and wouldn't be in the race if he were white.
   Speaking Wednesday at the State University of New York at
Buffalo, Ferraro credited Jackson for ``grabbing the imagination of
the public'' and said he is ``telling people the things we want to
hear, but he won't be able to deliver what he is promising.''
   A Jackson supporter attending the speech took quick exception to
Ferraro's remarks.
   ``I think your comments here today are extremely, extremely
dangerous and I abhor you for saying something like that,'' said
Samuel Herbert, a former candidate for Erie County Executive.
   ``I will not let you get away with that,'' Ferraro responded.
``You may abhor what I've said, but I have spoken the truth. ...
looking at the numbers, he will not have enough delegates. He will
not even have a majority of delegates that are chosen.''
   Ferraro, now a resident fellow at Harvard University, lauded the
Jackson campaign as ``worthwhile for this nation.'' But, she said,
if the civil rights leader ``were not black, he wouldn't be in the
race.''

<HEAD>Socialist Candidate Says Police Assaulted Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Socialist presidential candidate Ed Winn
says two Pontiac police officers assaulted him during a campaign
stop in the city last week.
   Winn, presidential candidate of the Workers League Party, said
Wednesday he was subjected to an ``unprovoked police assault''
while passing out leaflets last week outside a General Motors
plant. The two officers ``made abusive threats, threw Ed Winn up
against their squad car and manhandled him,'' added his campaign
director, Helen Halyard.
   Winn said he left after the officers threatened to put him in
jail.
   Pontiac police chief Reginald Turner, declining comment on the
allegations, said he has turned the matter over to a police
internal investigation division.

<HEAD>Former Governor, Wife, Endorse Dukakis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Scott Matheson endorsed
Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis for president Thursday, calling
him ``an Eastern governor who hasn't forgotten about the West.''
   ``We need a trained decision-maker in the White Hose,'' Matheson
told reporters. ``We need someone with personal integrity ... that
does not have the sleaze factor attached to it.''
   Matheson, who served two terms as Utah's governor before
stepping down in 1984, said he became acquainted with Dukakis
through the National Governors Association. The Massachusetts
governor consistently supported Western concerns in the
association, Matheson said.
