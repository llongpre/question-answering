   E. Robert Wallach, who has been indicted in the
Wedtech scandal, says reporters were corrupted by ambitious
prosecutors who leaked information to them.
   ``By the time I was indicted I was already convicted,'' said
Wallach, who is accused of taking payoffs from Wedtech officials in
exchange for influencing the awarding of government contracts.
   ``I am an innocent man caught in this system,'' Wallach told the
Associated Press Managing Editors convention Friday. ``And you,
every one of you, no matter how well-intentioned, played a part in
it.''
   Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer who goes to trial Jan. 3 in New
York on federal racketeering and conspiracy charges, also accused
reporters of slanting their articles by overlooking his record as a
respected litigator.
   Also speaking at the convention were former Democratic vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro and Wendell Phillippi,
retired managing editor of The Indianapolis News.
   Ferraro told the newspaper editors they crossed the line between
the public's right to know and an invasion of privacy in covering
her bid for the vice presidency in 1984.
   When reporters were finished interviewing everyone they could
find, including a janitor in a school where she once taught, ``they
found nothing newsworthy,'' she said. ``I was what I said I was ...
so they had to go after my family,'' she said, referring to her
husband's business dealings.
   Phillippi was the one who made a telephone call on behalf of
Republican vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle when Quayle
wanted to join the National Guard years ago. Phillippi assailed his
peers Friday for letting what he called an editor's mistake stick.
   ``I'm here as a defendant after being tried in the kangaroo
court in which some of you participated,'' the former APME
president said.
   He said he was belittled, maligned, misquoted and harrassed
after the AP picked up a story from The Indianapolis News that
suggested Phillippi made many calls on Quayle's behalf.
   ``I made one call to one person,'' Phillippi said.
   The AP corrected the story, but Phillippi said he was hounded
for weeks by newspaper reporters from around the country who
continued to base their reports on the erroneous information.
   ``How much are editors responsible for the pushiness of their
reporters?'' he said.
   ``Ours is an honorable profession,'' Phillippi said. ``Please
let's keep it that way.''
