   As Dan Quayle and Lloyd Bentsen turn their
attention to debate briefing books, experts predict their showdown
next week could be the most important ever between two men vying
for the vice presidency.
   The pressure is on both candidates next Wednesday night in
Omaha, largely because of the controversy surrounding Quayle's
National Guard stint at the height of the Vietnam War and his
admission to law school.
   ``This debate could be decisive in the election. And never
before could you say that about a vice presidential debate,'' said
Joel L. Swerdlow, who edited a volume on presidential debates and
has written extensively on the subject.
   ``This is the first time in modern history that a vice
presidential candidate may fail to pass the threshold of
acceptability,'' said Kathleen Jamieson of the University of Texas,
an expert on politics and the media.
   Quayle spent Thursday in briefings here and looked ahead to a
weekend of tutelage from Roger Ailes, the Bush campaign's media
guru. Bentsen snatched time to study during a light campaign
schedule before returning here late Friday for two days with top
Democratic advisers.
   The nation has seen only two vice presidential debates:
Republican Bob Dole vs. Democrat Walter Mondale in 1976 and
Republican George Bush vs. Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.
   Although Mondale and Bush were considered victors in those
contests, ``Dole passed the threshold of acceptability and for most
people so did Ferraro,'' said Jamieson. Quayle, however, is a
question mark to a large number of voters, she said.
   ``The stakes are very high for Quayle,'' she said.
   Both Jamieson and Swerdlow said Quayle's performance is
particularly important because his choice has been linked so
closely to Bush's judgment.
   ``He could cost Bush a close election,'' Jamieson said.
   Much has been said and written about the low expectations for
Quayle, and how that might be an advantage for him in the debate.
   ``If he can appear the equal of Lloyd Bentsen, he'll score an
overwhelming victory,'' said Jamieson.
   But low expectations can also hurt.
   ``People will be disposed to hear errors as errors,'' unlike
minor flubs forgiven in last Sunday's debate between Bush and
Michael Dukakis, Jamieson said. Debates tend to reinforce views of
a candidate that people already have, and in Quayle's case ``a
stumbling performance will not be forgiven,'' she said.
   Bentsen, on the other hand, has the burden of showing himself of
presidential timber while not talking down to Quayle, and at the
same time trying to score hits against Bush.
   ``You can't make fun of someone'' and the standard Bentsen
one-liners from the campaign trail won't work in a debate, said
Swerdlow.
   With an eye toward the debate, the Bush campaign tried this week
to display confidence in Quayle, including a joint appearance by
the two Republicans.
   ``He's been accused of lacking in every skill, social and
otherwise. But he's a good campaigner and we expect him to do well
in the debate,'' said Sheila Tate, Bush's spokeswoman. Bentsen
``has to defend Quayle's position because most of them are his own.
I think he will squirm,'' she said, a reference to Bentsen's many
differences with Dukakis on the issues.
   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said Quayle will pursue the
Republican argument that Bentsen is more attuned to GOP attitudes
than those of Dukakis.
   ``Quayle is going to go after the top of the ticket. The fact
that Bentsen is more closely aligned with our ticket doesn't
hurt,'' he said.
   The Texas senator this week unleashed his harshest attacks yet
on his junior colleague from Indiana. ``I'll tell you, if they were
elected, I'd pray for the good health of George Bush every night,''
Bentsen said Wednesday.
   Bentsen's chief of staff, Joseph O'Neill, said Bentsen will try
to tie Quayle closely to Bush to show ``that our team is better
than their team.''
   Privately, Bentsen's aides say they're worried Bentsen, 67, will
look and sound old when put next to Quayle, who is 26 years younger.
   Both sides have viewed tapes of an April 22 broadcast of public
television's MacNeil@Lehrer NewsHour, on which Bentsen and Quayle
debated the issue of giving workers 60 days' notice before a plant
could be closed.
   Quayle eventually lost the battle on the Senate floor, but on
television he presented his case attractively while Bentsen looked
gray.
   While Quayle plans to work this weekend with Ailes, Bentsen has
been working with Michael Sheehan, a consultant who specializes in
making candidates look good on television.
   Bentsen returns to Washington Friday for two days of meetings
and briefings. He travels Sunday back to Texas for final
preparations, including mock debates with Democratic Rep. Dennis
Eckart of Ohio playing Quayle.
   Top Republicans including Labor Secretary Ann McLaughlin and
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger have already briefed
Quayle, who will remain in Washington until debate day except for a
Friday fund-raiser in Pennsylvania.
   In mock debates, Quayle is using Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon, a
long-time colleague of Bentsen's on the Senate Finance Committee.
