   Former Miss America Bess Myerson asked
for a delay in prosecution of shoplifting charges against her until
after her federal trial this fall in New York City.
   Lycoming County Judge Thomas C. Raup scheduled a hearing July 6
on the motion, filed Thursday. Miss Myerson's trial, scheduled to
begin Monday, will be temporarily postponed at least until the
hearing.
   Her lawyer argues that publicity about the shoplifting trial
could keep her from getting an unbiased jury in the federal trial.
But District Attorney Brett O. Feese opposed the delay, saying,
``It's just another shoplifting case.''
   Miss Myerson, 63, was charged with shoplifting May 27 after she
allegedly tried to leave a department store with six bottles of
nail polish, five pairs of earrings, a pair of shoes and flashlight
batteries.
   The former New York City cultural affairs commissioner contends
she planned to go back to the store to pay for the items after
locking her car.
   Miss Myerson is scheduled to stand trial in New York in
September on charges of mail fraud, racketeering, conspiracy and
influencing a judge. The indictment, returned last October, accuses
her of trying to influence the divorce case of her reported lover,
millionaire Carl Capasso.

   Former vice-presidential candidate Geraldine
Ferraro will be at the Democratic National Convention in Atlanta
next month as an analyst for a local television station.
   At a news conference Thursday announcing her plans to work for
the ABC affiliate WCVB-TV, Ferraro said she doesn't ``feel the same
obligation the station does to be objective'' but is confident she
will be able to discuss the issues without promoting her personal
political agenda.
   ``I'm not walking away from being a Democrat. I'm proud of it,''
she said. ``Perhaps because of it I can give an inside view. You've
seen it from the outside. I've been on the inside.''
   She said she was raising funds for Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis, the probable Democratic nominee. A former congresswoman,
she ran on the ticket in 1984 as Walter Mondale's running mate.

   Actress Rebecca DeMornay, reprising Judy
Holliday's Oscar-winning role in the 1946 comedy-drama ``Born
Yesterday,'' says she's amazed the story on Washington corruption
is so relevant today.
   Miss DeMornay, who starred in the films ``Risky Business'' and
``The Trip to Bountiful,'' plays a woman who learns her boyfriend
is involved in government corruption in a stage production
beginning Sunday at the Pasadena Playhouse.
   ``It's amazingly reflective of our times,'' Miss DeMornay said.
``I'm going to rehearsals and I see huge headlines in the
newspapers, `Bribery Exceeds All Limits.' That's what this play is
about!''
   She calls her character ``an innocent who is apolitical and, for
all intents and purposes, pretty dumb, who awakens intellectually
and politically.''
   ``She sees the (hypocrisy) within the system and calls everybody
on it. I thought that was very inspirational, particularly this
year,'' she said.

   Patty Hearst, who once handled automatic weapons
as a kidnapped soldier in the Symbionese Liberation Army, says she
now keeps a gun by her suburban bedside.
   ``There are guns all over the house,'' she says, including a
handgun ``a little more substantial than a Magnum'' kept by the
bed, she said in an interview in Vogue magazine.
   The 34-year-old publishing heiress recalled that during her time
with the SLA, she ``really began to notice I was no longer in
control when, without a thought, I just did what I had been trained
to do _ fire the machine gun and the other guns in sequence.''
   A few weeks after she was kidnapped by the SLA in 1974 in
Berkeley, Calif., the radical leftist band released a taped message
from her declaring that she had decided to join the group. She
subsequently took part in a bank robbery and spent more than a year
on the run before being arrested.
   At her trial, her lawyers argued that she had been mistreated
and did not freely join the SLA. Though she was convicted and spent
time in prison, her sentence was eventually commuted.
   Hearst married her former bodyguard and now lives in Westport,
Conn.

   Former President Constantine Caramanlis
underwent emergency surgery Friday to remove a gallstone, a
hospital official said.
   A doctor at the Hygea hospital, who requsted anonymity, said the
81-year-old statesman was ``well and resting comfortably'' after
the operation. The former president was airlifted to the hospital
aboard a helicopter from Revmatonisi, a small private island in the
Aegean where he was vacationing.
   Caramanlis was president from 1980 to 1985, when he retired
after Premier Andreas Papandreou's ruling Panhellenic Socialist
Movement decided not to back him for another term.

   Convicted bank robber turned
businessman Delbert Dunmire donated $300,000 worth of high-powered
assault rifles Friday to the Highway Patrol.
   Saying he thought the weapons would deter criminals, Dunmire
presented police officials with the first 100 of his planned gift
of 300 semiautomatic .223 rifles.
   Dunmire is the millionaire chairman of Growth Industries Inc.,
an airplane parts manufacturing company he founded in 1967 after
serving two years in prison for robbing a bank to pay off gambling
debts.
   ``The criminal element will hit the soft spot, not the hard,''
Dunmire said as he presented the weapons. ``I want this patrol to
be a coconut, not a banana.''
   Dunmire made headlines last August when he treated nearly 200
classmates from the Punxsutawney (Pa.) High School class of 1952 to
an expense-paid trip to the Bahamas for their 35th reunion.
