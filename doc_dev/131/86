   The debate between vice presidential
candidates will go a long way toward determining whether George
Bush was wise when he picked Dan Quayle for a running mate _ and
whether Michael Dukakis was wise to make a major issue of it.
   Not that Democratic vice presidential candidate Lloyd Bentsen
isn't sharing top billing in the 90-minute encounter in Omaha, with
all the potential political profits and perils that go with it.
   But after a campaign of controversy and criticism, Quayle is the
man in the spotlight.
   A positive performance by the 41-year-old Indiana senator, and
Bush's bid to spice his ticket with a handsome representative of a
younger generation will seem vindicated. Bentsen could seem every
bit of the 26 years older that he is.
   Republicans would then breathe a sigh of relief and hope nothing
happens before Election Day to reverse their seeming edge in the
campaign for the White House.
   A poor performance by Quayle, and the post-debate debate will
turn on whether Bush can somehow contain the resultant damage.
   Dukakis would step up the steady drumbeat of criticism that Bush
had picked a man not fit to be a heartbeat away from the White
House and trumpet the steady, mature experience of his man Bentsen.
   Bush took his lumps earlier in the campaign for picking Quayle.
His senior aides went to pains to tell reporters that the vice
president made his choice without their approval _ a sure sign that
he wouldn't have gotten it. The controversy over Quayle's
Vietnam-era service in the National Guard, his mediocre academic
record and the general furor produced a few suggestions that he
should consider leaving the ticket.
   He didn't and Bush stood by his man.
   Dukakis hasn't let up, though, in a less-noticed but still risky
campaign gamble.
   Traditional political tactics dictate that a candidate avoid
public disputes with a staff aide to a rival and that the man at
the top of the ticket not be drawn into a dispute with someone
further down.
   The reason is obvious _ as Walter F. Mondale found out in 1984
when he sought to brutalize Bush for offering blind loyalty to
Ronald Reagan. Bush, then the understudy on the GOP ticket, was
delighted to maintain a public quarrel with the leading Democrat,
leaving Reagan free to remain above the fray.
   Dukakis' aides insist that Quayle's selection gives them an
excellent issue, a window on the type of decision Bush would make
as president. But if Quayle performs well in the debate it could
well be that they missed their issue all along.
   Televised vice presidential debates are a relatively new
phenomenon in presidential campaigning. The first one was in 1976,
when Republican Bob Dole, trying to deflect a question about the
Watergate scandal, blurted out that World War I, World War II and
Korea were ``Democrat wars.''
   Democrat Walter F. Mondale replied that Dole had richly earned
his reputation as a hatchet-man, and the controversy that followed
was blamed by some Republicans for contributing to the narrow GOP
defeat that fall.''
   Four years ago a vice president named Bush debated his rival,
Democrat Geraldine Ferraro. The session is best remembered for
Bush's morning-after boast that he'd ``kicked a little ass.''
   Bush and the Republicans would be quite happy if this year's
debate produced nothing particularly memorable _ and if Quayle
avoided the temptation to brag about it afterwards.
