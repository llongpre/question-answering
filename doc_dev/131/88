   Barbara Bush is loyal to a fault but she says
she won't ``turn into a glamorous princess'' just because her
husband in running for president.
   ``What you see with me is what you get. I'm not running for
president _ George Bush is,'' says the snowy-haired wife of the
certain Republican nominee.
   Mrs. Bush says she is eager to get out on the campaign trail for
the man she ``absolutely adores'' and that she intends to tell
voters about his strength, courage and ability to get things done.
   But her loyalty to her husband of 43 years has its price.
   Calling herself the ``world's worst secret keeper,'' Mrs. Bush
said she has asked her husband not tell her about his choice for a
running mate. ``I've kept secrets, but it's agony,'' she said.
``This time, I want to be surprised.''
   At ease with reporters _ and lauded by many for her kindnesses
to them _ staffers on the Bush campaign refer to Mrs. Bush as their
``secret weapon.''
   But her quick wit and eagerness to chat got her into trouble
four years ago _ when she was quoted by reporters as saying of
Geraldine Ferraro, the 1984 Democratic vice presidential nominee,
``that $4 million _ I can't say it, but it rhymes with rich.''
   ``It was dumb of me, I shouldn't have said it,'' Mrs. Bush says
now, insisting she holds no grudge against the reporters. ``I blame
Barbara Bush. It was not attractive and I've been very shamed. I
apologized to Mrs. Ferraro and I would apologize again.''
   But unable to resist another quip, she adds, ``I'm not making
poems anymore.''
   Mrs. Bush admits feeling a bit envious of Kitty Dukakis, the
wife of Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis.
   ``She's so attractive,'' the vice president's wife confides,
dropping her voice to a near-conspiratorial whisper. ``I'd love to
look like her if you want to know the truth.''
   At 63, Mrs. Bush is a year younger than her husband George and
two years younger than the perfectly coiffed and designer-dressed
Nancy Reagan.
   But there will be no apologies here, thank you very much, for
the creamy complexion adorned with multiple ``laugh lines'' or the
curved figure that's more at home in silky afternoon dresses _ or
well-worn jeans _ than state dinner decolletage.
   ``I'm not going to turn into a glamorous princess,'' she says of
her campaign role.
   Well aware of the criticism heaped on Mrs. Reagan for her
high-priced tastes, Mrs. Bush says there's more to the race than
hair styles or designer frocks.
   ``I'm not going to worry about it. I have plenty of
self-confidence, not in how I look but in how I feel, and I feel
good about my husband, my children and my life,'' she said.
   That security has been gleaned during a life begun in what many
would consider affluence, as the daughter of the publisher of
McCall's magazine. But it has been tested during the years by the
ups and downs of her husband's career, and such personal loss as
the death of a daughter to leukemia.
   Mrs. Bush exudes serenity as she, Bush and their five children
enter the formal campaign to replace the Reagans at 1600
Pennsylvania Ave.
   It could well be their 29th residence.
   Since the 19-year-old sophomore from Smith College married the
tall and lanky Navy flier on Jan. 6, 1945, in her hometown of Rye,
N.Y., they've moved more than two dozen times. Virginia,
Connecticut, Texas, Washington, D.C., New York City and China have
been called home _ all during Bush's odyssey from military man to
Yale graduate to oil man to politician.
   Although her speech is marked by the well-mannered tones of the
blueblood background she shares with husband, she can be imperious
when he is criticized.
   Asked about the ``wimp'' image that's plagued her husband, she
sniffs, ``That's just what the Democrats say.''
   And when queried about the fact that polls indicate that fewer
women prefer her husband to Dukakis, she retorts:
   ``I'm slightly offended as a woman when I hear George has this
enormous gender gap,'' she said. She puts the onus on the party,
not her man.
   ``I think the Republicans have a gender gap, not George Bush,''
she says.
   Over the coming months, she'll campaign about 60 percent of the
time on her own, the rest with her husband, talking about the
things she ``knows best'' _ George Bush and her years-long fight to
battle illiteracy.
   She contends her husband is ``perfectly willing'' to let others
take the credit for things he's done. ``George Bush is a fellow who
believes in quiet leadership. You don't have to blow you own
horn,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   ``That's probably why our relationship is so good _ he lets me
think I think all the good things up.''
