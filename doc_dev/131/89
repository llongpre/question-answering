   The cocaine trial of John Zaccaro Jr. opened
today with the judge barring all but six reporters from the jury
selection process and ordering that no information be publicly
disclosed until a jury is chosen.
   Judge Francis McCaffrey said he expected jury selection to last
three days, adding that any published information could unduly
influence the jury pool.
   Zaccaro, the son of former presidential vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro, is accused of selling one-quarter gram
of cocaine to an undercover policewoman. The charge, to which
Zaccaro pleaded innocent, carries a five-year prison term.
   He arrived in Vermont District Court in Rutland flanked by his
attorneys, while Ferraro and her husband, John Zaccaro Sr., arrived
in a separate car and followed their son into court.
   Zaccaro's parents pulled up swivel chairs immediately behind the
defense table. Ferraro, a lawyer, wrote last-minute notes and
reviewed court paperwork.
   Attorneys met with McCaffrey for more than an hour before the
judge's decision was announced.
   McCaffrey said six of 11 reporters in the courtroom could attend
jury selection, but said they would not be able to publish the
information until the jury was empaneled.
   ``It is important that we get an impartial jury. That is where
you persons have become an issue,'' McCaffrey told the reporters.
His decision, he said, ``essentially provides a compromise.''
   The trial opened more than two years after Zaccaro, a former
Middlebury College student, was arrested.
   The case has progressed slowly because of appeals to the Vermont
Supreme Court, including a claim that Zaccaro was singled out for
prosecution because of his famous mother.
   Two weeks ago, one of the challenges paid off, when Vermont
District Judge Francis McCaffrey dismissed one of the two original
charges against Zaccaro.
   But Zaccaro's attorneys, Charles Tetzlaff and Thomas Sherrer,
lost their bid to have the case thrown out altogether; the Vermont
Supreme Court refused to dismiss the charges last year.
   Zaccaro, 24, was a senior at Middlebury College when he was
arrested Feb. 20, 1986, outside a Middlebury restaurant where he
worked.
   The prosecution alleges the undercover agent, Laura Manning,
bought one-quarter gram of cocaine from Zaccaro at his off-campus
apartment earlier that day.
   Police searched Zaccaro's car and said they found eight grams of
cocaine, $1,600 in cash and checks, and documents described as
records of drug transactions.
   The arrest came in the wake of rumors that Zaccaro allegedly was
selling drugs on campus and had earned the nickname ``the
pharmacist,'' Middlebury Police Sgt. David Wemette said at the time.
   Zaccaro also was charged with possession of cocaine with intent
to sell, the charge thrown out because it hinged on the evidence in
Zaccaro's car.
   In 1986, McCaffrey said there was insufficient evidence for the
search warrant used to obtain the items. In throwing out the charge
two weeks ago, he rejected the contention of Addison County State's
Attorney John Quinn that the charge could be proven based solely on
Manning's observations.
   No more motions or requests were expected before or at the start
of the trial, Quinn said Friday. Tetzlaff declined to comment.
   The case will be followed closely by students at the liberal
arts college, even though Zaccaro dropped out in the fall of 1986,
said Sharon Harper, the editor of the college newspaper, The
Middlebury Campus.
   ``The case of John Zaccaro opened up the administration to drug
problems in Middlebury,'' Harper said. ``I think it's important
that people see how this case follows through so they know that
there's (a penalty) for drug abuse.''
