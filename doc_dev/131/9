   President Bush said Thursday that he's an
expert when it comes to running a political campaign against women,
but at least one female politician took exception to the contention.
   ``I don't know how he'd call himself an expert,'' former Rep.
Geraldine Ferraro said from New York. ``Only in politics does one
little meeting an expert make.''
   Ferraro was Walter Mondale's vice presidential running mate in
the 1984 race against incumbent President Reagan and Vice President
Bush.
   Bush's comments at a news conference were prompted by a question
about the Texas gubernatorial race that may pit Democrat Ann
Richards against Republican Clayton Williams.
   Williams has said he would feel less comfortable running against
Richards than Attorney General Jim Mattox. Richards, the state
treasurer, and Mattox will battle for the Democratic nomination in
an April 10 run-off election.
   Bush said he had some opinions about running against women,
calling himself ``an expert in the field'' because of his contest
against Ferraro.
   But Ferraro said Bush's memory of the race is flawed, and that
the only time they went head-to-head was in one televised debate.
   ``We did not run against each other. It was Fritz Mondale and
Ronald Reagan who were running against each other,'' Ferraro said.
``If we were both running against each other, if we were both at
the top of the ticket, then I think his comment about being an
expert would be valid.''
   Bush was asked if he had any advice for Williams.
   ``I have none at all, but I know exactly what he means and I
refuse to elaborate on it,'' Bush said.
   Ferraro, meanwhile, said Richards didn't need any advice from
her.
   ``Ann has run against men before. I'm sure she's not
uncomfortable with it,'' Ferraro said, suggesting Williams' problem
may be a common male ailment.
   ``The only way I can see it, being uncomfortable, is when you
lose to a man it's humiliating enough,'' she said. ``But if you're
a macho guy and you lose to a woman, it has to be devastating.''
