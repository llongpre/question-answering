   John Zaccaro Jr. got up early Wednesday,
packed up the family Oldsmobile with his father's help, and drove
away from Vermont and a cocaine dealing conviction that led to
three months under house arrest.
   The son of former Democratic Vice Presidential candidate
Geraldine Ferraro was freed a month early, for good behavior, from
his four-month term of house arrest, a sentence that created an
uproar because Zaccaro spent it in a $1,500-a-month apartment in
Burlington.
   Zaccaro, 24, and his father, John Sr., packed up Zaccaro's
belongings at 7:30 a.m. and drove away. Their destination was not
made public, and Ferraro's office in New York said no information
would be released about their whereabouts.
   The family's telephone number in New York City is unlisted.
   Soon after Zaccaro started serving his sentence in July, the
revelation of his living conditions prompted Gov. Madeleine Kunin
to change the house arrest program so no drug dealer could
participate in it in the future.
   Zaccaro, a former Middlebury College student, was convicted of
selling one-quarter gram of cocaine to an undercover Vermont state
trooper in February 1986.
   Under house arrest, defendants pay for their own housing while
living under close state supervision. Zaccaro spent less than 30
minutes in a Vermont correctional center _ the time it took to
process his application for house arrest, authorities said.
   While under house arrest, Zaccaro worked at a youth center,
taking disadvantaged youths fishing, roller skating and swimming.
   Roxane Leopold, executive director of the King Street Area Youth
Program, said Zaccaro also distinguished himself as a cook,
preparing pasta salad, chocolate mousse and a variety of other
dishes for several social events.
   ``We miss him,'' Leopold said. ``We all wish him well.''
   Leopold said Zaccaro taught the young people he worked with a
great deal about substance abuse.
   Zaccaro was sentenced to one to five years, with all but four
months suspended. Probation officials have not determined the
length of his probation, which could last the remainder of his
original term.
   Officials said Zaccaro received 10 days off his sentence for
every 30 days he served with good behavior, reducing it by about a
month.
   Perry also said Zaccaro had performed 530 hours of community
service, 230 hours more than required in Judge Francis McCaffrey's
sentence.
