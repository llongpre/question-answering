<HEAD>Bentsen Draws Mixed Reviews From Women's Groups</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women's groups say Sen. Lloyd Bentsen offers a
mixed record on women's issues, but his stance on Contra aid and
defense spending could turn some female voters away from the
Democratic ticket in November.
   ``Basically, he's more a plus than he is a minus,'' Molly Yard,
president of the National Organization for Women, said after the
Texas senator was announced as Michael Dukakis running mate choice
Tuesday.
   ``I think the one thing that disturbs us about him is that he is
very much a hawk. He was pro-Contra aid, and for all the money
spent on defense. He is really business as usual and that's why the
voters want change,'' she said.
   Irene Natividad, chairman of the National Women's Political
Caucus, said women's groups had not expected this year that
Democrats would name a woman vice president candidate because ``the
sense was that the Democratic Party felt they had already done a
women on the ticket.''
   Geraldine Ferraro, who was Walter Mondale's running mate on the
losing Democratic ticket in 1984, said she was ``delighted'' by the
choice of Bentsen.

<HEAD>Democrats Release Proposed Platform As Jackson Continues</HEAD>

   Negotiations

   Aides to Jesse Jackson say they are still
negotiating over minority planks in the Democratic Party platform,
but expect to bring some issues to the floor of next week's
Democratic National Convention.
   The Democratic Platform Committee released a 4,700-word proposed
platform Tuesday without the minority planks the Jackson campaign
has been pushing.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jesse Jackson's chief platform
negotiator, said, ``Our minority reports are not in there because
we're still negotiating.''
   Jackson has said he may press floor fights in Atlanta next
Tuesday on a dozen or more issues, including his call for higher
taxes on the wealthy, a Pentagon freeze, more spending on education
and Head Start, no-first-use of nuclear weapons and Palestinian
self-determination.
   With 1,135 delegates, Jackson can force debates on any issue,
but Dukakis's majority of 2,426 is large enough to leave no doubt
as to who will win the fights.
   The proposed platform avoids any mention of tax increases and
does not say how Dukakis and the Democrats would deal with the huge
federal deficits.

<HEAD>Mayor Says New Orleans Will Be Ready For GOP _ Even If Police</HEAD>

   Strike

   The mayor of New Orleans says a work stoppage
of the sort staged this week by city police won't disrupt security
for next month's Republican National Convention.
   ``We have an alternative plan to deal with any problem,'' Mayor
Sidney Barthelemy said Tuesday at a news conference called in
response to Monday's 24-hour sick-out by almost one-fourth of the
1,350-member police force.
   The Police Association of New Orleans disclaimed any connection
with the sick-out, although PANO president Ron Cannatella said
Barthelemy's refusal to negotiate with the union and raise salaries
distressed many officers.
   Cannatella refused to rule out a job action during the
convention.
   Barthelemy refused to say how the city would deal with a police
job action during the convention Aug. 15-18, although about 60
Louisiana State Police troopers were brought in to work alongside
city police who worked Monday.
   State police are already planning to send about 130 troopers and
investigators to New Orleans for the convention.
