   For Michael Dukakis and George Bush, picking a
vice presidential nominee is a key step in putting together the
pieces of the Electoral College puzzle, as strategists try to fit
the person to the political geography.
   Should Dukakis pick a Southern senator as his running mate to
help the Democrats win in the region this fall?
   ``It just doesn't work when we go with two Northerners on the
ticket,'' says Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
   Should Bush name California Gov. George Deukmejian to the No. 2
spot on the GOP ticket to grab the biggest state's votes on Nov. 8?
   ``The Democrats must beat us in California to have a chance,''
said Republican consultant Vincent Breglio.
   The pieces of the Electoral College puzzle are states, each
offering a prize of electoral votes toward the goal of 270, the
majority needed to win the White House.
   The choice of a running mate _ always a tough decision _ is
complicated in 1988 because Ronald Reagan has helped redraw the
political contours of the country:
   _ The once solidly Democratic South is now viewed as one of
Bush's two strongholds _ along with the Mountain states of the West.
   _ With Reagan not on the ticket, California will be very
competitive with a prize of 47 electoral votes.
   _ The farm states of the Midwest, long GOP bastions, are ripe
for Democratic appeals after years of Reagan agriculture policies
that have left the region feeling battered.
   _ The big industrial states of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio,
Michigan and the like are shaping up as very close battles.
   Dukakis, the odds-on favorite for the Democratic presidential
nomination, must put his piece of the puzzle down first, when the
Democratic National Convention meets in Atlanta in July. Then Bush
can look over the full opposition ticket before making a decision
at the GOP convention in New Orleans in August.
   Historically, vice presidential candidates aren't the most
important factor in an election win, but they do count.
   ``I think it gets you the state where the running mate is from,
but not much more,'' said Elaine Kamarck, a Democratic activist and
political scientist, citing various studies.
   ``Nobody is going to carry a region as a vice presidential
nominee,'' argues Robert Beckel, who managed Walter Mondale's 1984
campaign.
   But that much wider impact is the keystone of the argument from
those who are pushing a Southerner for Dukakis's running mate.
Democrats making this argument say that the only times the party
has won the White House since 1952 was with a Southerner on board
and a good showing in the region, which sports 182 electoral votes.
   ``Dukakis needs a Southern senator as a running mate, not
another governor,'' said Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton on Friday in
saying he should not be the running mate.
   Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia is the prime candidate under this
scenario, since he is a conservative Democrat and chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee. But others mentioned as well are
former presidential hopeful Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee, Sen.
Dale Bumpers of Arkansas, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida and Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas.
   ``Is Sam Nunn going to bring us the rest of the South?'' asked
Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. ``He's not very well known
outside of Georgia. Of course, he will make an appeal ... but he
will be overshadowed by the top of the ticket.''
   A non-Southerner who could have appeal in the South is Sen. John
Glenn of Ohio, whose military background, ex-astronaut status and
moderate views would have appeal in the region. And perhaps as
importantly, Glenn is popular in his home state with its 23
electoral votes.
   While the South is important, almost everyone agrees that the
West Coast is critical.
   ``California is the key,'' said Democratic consultant John
Russonello.
   ``California is not a Republican anchor. It's very much up for
grabs,'' said GOP pollster Richard Wirthlin.
   The state's 47 electoral votes are the biggest prize in the
general election, almost one-fifth of the majority needed.
   Deukmejian, the state's popular governor and a Bush backer, has
always been high on the lists of possible GOP nominees. But there
is a major drawback: if Deukmejian won the vice presidency, he
would have to turn the governor's chair over to a Democrat.
   ``It is impossible,'' said GOP consultant Lance Tarrance,
``because of his sincere and intense interest in running the state
of California.''
   But the GOP choice will also be shaped by the Democratic moves.
   A Southern choice by the Democrats would ``open up the
opportunity to do some cherry-picking in the Midwest,'' explains
Wirthlin. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Dick Thornburgh and Illinois
Gov. Jim Thompson are two names mentioned.
   In contrast, a Midwestern choice by the opposition might send
the GOP rushing to Deukmejian.
   But then there is Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, the former GOP
presidential hopeful with strong California ties and a message of
economic optimism that Tarrance said would be appealing in the
Midwest.
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander is the most often
mentioned southerner among the Republicans, if Bush decided to
shore up his base there. Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming gets
mentioned as a possible Western candidate.
   A completely different approach for the Republicans would be to
choose a woman for the No. 2 spot, as the Democrats did with
Geraldine Ferraro in 1984.
   While choosing former Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole,
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas or former United Nations Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick would have impact in their home states, the
larger goal would be to narrow the ``gender gap'' of negative
women's opinions that has hurt the GOP since 1980.
