   John Zaccaro Jr., who was arrested on drug
charges about a year after his mother's vice presidential bid, says
working with runaways has shown him that everyone deserves a second
chance.
   ``I've learned that everyone deserves a second chance, or a
third and fourth chance, however many it may take,'' Zaccaro, son
of Geraldine Ferraro, wrote in the March 29 issue of Woman's Day
magazine about his volunteer work with Covenant House.
   ``My problems are nothing compared to the kids I see on the
streets; when I ran into trouble, my family was there,'' said
Zaccaro, 23, who was arrested for sale and possession of drugs in
February 1984, while a student at Middlebury College in Vermont.
The case is still pending.
   Zaccaro said two other colleges refused to admit him because of
the drug charge and he couldn't get a job.
   ``My mom, who had helped so many college kids get jobs, was
devastated by her inability to help me. `They don't want the
notoriety of John Zaccaro working for them,' she told me.'''
   So he volunteered at Covenant House, riding around in a van all
night to offer food, emotional support and other help to teen-age
runaways, many of them involved in drugs and prostitution.
   ``I'm just John, a friendly face in a blue van. Many of these
kids pick up newspapers out of the trash cans. If they read the
stories about me and my family, they don't make the connection. And
I'm glad of that,'' he wrote.
   ``I'm proud of my family _ my mom for taking on a tough fight
and my dad, well, for going through a lot of grief in a gentle way
that gives me a lot to imitate.''
