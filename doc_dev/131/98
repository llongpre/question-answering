   Democratic front-runner Michael Dukakis
today denounced Reagan administration economic policies and said
progress will require greater educational efforts. He promised to
do more than talk about education for political gain.
   Dukakis' likely November Republican opponent, Vice President
George Bush, declares in almost every campaign speech that he wants
to be ``the education president.''
   However, Dukakis said, ``The next president must be this
nation's No. 1 advocate for educational opportunity and good
schools, not just during election years but every day and every
week and every month.''
   ``In a Dukakis administration, we're going to make the same kind
of commitment to excellence and high standards that launched an
explosion in scientific and economic progress under John Kennedy a
generation ago,'' Dukakis said at the University of Charleston.
   ``We're going to invest in our people; we'e going to invest in
new technology; we're going to invest in research,'' Dukakis said.
   On Reagan-Bush economic policies, Dukakis said the
administration has ignored regional development while allowing
corporate raiders to orchestrate mergers that have brought them
millions in profits while costing jobs.
   Dukakis also was touring a West Virginia coal mine before headng
to Nebraska to campaign. Both states have presidential primaries
Tuesday.
   In Boston, meanwhile, income tax reports made public today
showed Dukakis and his wife Kitty made $108,957 in total income
last year and paid just under 24 percent of that amount in federal
taxes.
   Upon arriving in West Virginia early today, Dukakis wooed voters
with a promise to help the state's coal industry.
   Dukakis said he would encourage the construction of electricity
plants near the state's coal mines, with the power to be sold to
the energy-dependent Northeast.
   ``We now are buying power from Canada,'' he said. ``I'm willing
to pay a little more and I think most Americans are, too,'' to rely
on U.S. suppliers.
   In Boston, before heading to West Virginia, he said he welcomed
continued competition from Democratic rival Jesse Jackson.
   Dukakis said he had a friendly discussion with Jackson on
Wednesday morning, the day after Dukakis' big wins in Ohio and
Indiana.
   At the same time, Dukakis campaign aides said privately that
Jackson should tone done his recent criticism of Dukakis.
   On Tuesday, the day that his Ohio and Indiana primary victories
pushed him closer to the nomination, Dukakis named Marcia Hale, a
veteran Democratic political operative, as his manager for the
Democratic National Convention.
   The Dukakis campaign also has brought in Richard Moe, Kirk
O'Donnell, Anne Wexler and Charles Campion as campaign advisers and
likely will add more veterans of national campaigns in coming weeks.
   Moe was Vice President Walter Mondale's chief of staff and
informally advised Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt's presidential
campaign. O'Donnell is a former aide to ex-House Speaker Thomas P.
``Tip'' O'Neil. Wexler worked for Geraldine Ferraro's 1984 vice
presidential campaign and Campion is a Boston political consultant
who will serve as the campaign's national political coordinator.
   Just a month ago, it appeared Dukakis would head into the
convention short of the 2,081 delegates needed for nomination. Now
that it appears more likely he will have that number or close to
it, more advisers are being brought in to help prepare for
convention platform discussions and the general election.
