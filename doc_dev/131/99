<LEADPARA>  THE Palm Beach-Kennedy rape scandal has prompted a revival of Kennedy sex
lore. Who did what to whom, when and where?;    So addicted are we to this
sordid, prurient history that the average American -- myself included -- knows
more about John Kennedy's skinny-dipping parties than about the Bay of Pigs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     And, why not? Sex has always been more interesting than war. Or are they
the same thing? I always get confused.;    Accompanying the recitations of the
various escapades is a sort of patronizing cap-doffing to the stoic Kennedy
women. A recent issue of People magazine traced the history of this tradition
of silent suffering from Rose to Joan.;    Rose's husband, Joseph, we are
told, was a notorious womanizer who brazenly took his lover, Gloria Swanson,
on a European cruise with the married couple. His sons, Jack and Bobby,
apparently arranged liaisons when Daddy was visiting them in Washington.;   
The senior Kennedy also reportedly told his sons to have sex as often as
possible. Jack apparently took his father's advice to heart. He reportedly
couldn't go without sex for a single day. It gave him a headache.;    Or was
it that he couldn't have sex unless he had a headache? Or was it Jackie who
had a headache? I always get confused.;    The People story went on to talk
about how Jackie held her head high and ignored her husband's philandering.
About how Joan learned early to find solace in the bottle rather than worry
where her husband, Ted, was dropping his trousers.;    About how Ethel, who
had to be pregnant her entire married life in order to produce 11 children
before Bobby was assassinated, merely swallowed her pride as her husband
followed in his big brother's footsteps.;    What is striking is that despite
the well-documented dalliances by Kennedy men, we as a nation still hold them
in such high regard. We would never, ever tolerate such behavior from our
women.;    A woman who publicly humiliated her husband, no matter what her
relative station in life, would be run out of town on a rail. A woman who
cuckolded her husband would be admired by neither men nor women. A woman who
had multiple lovers -- on an annual basis much less a daily basis -- would not
be glamorized as a sensual woman with understandably extraordinary needs.
She'd be a slut.;    Imagine if Geraldine Ferraro's ticket had made it to the
White House. Suppose she were eventually elected president. Imagine her secret
service women sneaking in Richard Gere or Mel Gibson for a little nude splash
around the White House pool.;    Just pretend for a minute that no one knew
about it except the parties involved. Well, her husband knew, but he
understood the extraordinary pressures his wife faced every day and merely
turned his cheek.;    Then things got a little messy when Richard Gere turned
up dead of an overdose and the inevitable rumors surfaced about his being an
"inconvenient man." Then truth struck a home run one terrible day when Ferraro
was assassinated and her sexual shenanigans came to light.;    Do we forgive
her now that she's dead? Was she really a great lady in spite of it all, a
fine leader who propelled her country to greatness?;    Nah. She was a common
strumpet. Got what she deserved. Her poor husband, how did he stand it?;   
Jack Kennedy could be a hero. But our fictional Ferraro, or whoever she might
be, would be the hasty victim of a national hand-washing. Good riddance. We
always knew a woman couldn't handle the job.;    Of course, this is an
exaggerated scenario. But it does help to visualize how completely different
our standards are for men and women. Men are excused from boys-will-be-boys
behavior. Women are dismissed as tramps.;    Stoicism is no more a female
trait than debauchery is a male's. By glamorizing the Kennedy libido, we
undermine the values of leadership the Kennedys purported to embody.;    It is
time we re-examine our standards, both for leadership and for men and women in
general. As a start, we might consider putting the Kennedy men to rest once
and for all. The Kennedy women, meanwhile, have the sort of leadership
qualities we sorely need: courage, loyalty, wisdom and, of course, stoicism.  </TEXT>
