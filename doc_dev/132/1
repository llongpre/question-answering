<TEXT>     The baby, Azaria, vanished from the couple's campsite near Ayers Rock in
central Australia in August 1980. Her body was never found.;    In 1982, Lindy
Chamberlain was convicted of murder. Her husband was found guilty of being an
accessory after the fact.;    Many people said they believed Lindy Chamberlain
was guilty simply because she showed little emotion during the trial.;    She
was sentenced to life in prison but was released in 1986 after the infant's
jacket, missing since the disappearance, was found near Ayers Rock. In 1988,
the Northern Territory government threw out the convictions.;    Northern
Territory Attorney General Daryl Manzie said $306,000 of the award would go to
the Seventh Day Adventist Church. The church, where Michael Chamberlain once
served as a minister, covered the couple's legal expenses.;    The remaining
$14,725 was being paid to the Chamberlains for the loss of their car and
personal effects.;    The Chamberlains are also seeking an additional $3.1
million in damages. The claim has not yet been heard by the Northern Territory
government.  </TEXT>
