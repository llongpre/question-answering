   The advertising agency NW Ayer Inc. agreed to buy most of C&amp;W Group Inc., an agency that accounts for about 30% of the revenue of C&amp;W's parent holding company, Mickelberry Corp. 

   Ayer said it agreed, as expected, to purchase C&amp;W, which is the parent of Cunningham &amp; Walsh Inc. and two other ad agencies, except for the group's Chicago office. 

   C&amp;W's clients include American Home Products Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Ayer's clients include American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., Avon Products Inc. and Gillette Co. 

   A price wasn't disclosed, but industry sources said it was between $25 million and $30 million. 

   The merged agency's combined billings would have placed it as the nation's 15th-largest agency in 1985. 

   Ad agencies in the past have typically received as commissions 15% of an advertiser's billings, the total cost of placing ads. 
The purchased units had 1985 billings of $275 million. 
Ayer had 1985 billings of $826.4 million. 

   Mickelberry, a holding company for advertising and marketing concerns, decided to sell C&amp;W because "we got a very good offer," said John Morton, assistant treasurer. 
He added that Mickelberry will probably reinvest the proceeds of the sale in other marketing acquisitions. 
"We will undoubtedly continue to specialize in market service specialty companies, and that may or may not include advertising agencies," he said. 

   Mickelberry in the past hasn't been a strong performer: While revenue increased every year from 1983 to 1985, net income dropped steadily, and the company had a $1.8 million loss last year. 
Mr. Morton said that C&amp;W has been a "prime" cause of that lackluster performance. 
He added that Mickelberry's remaining units "are healthy, profitable, and growing." 

   The C&amp;W units Mickelberry agreed to sell account for about 30% of its revenue, according to Mr. Morton. 
Mickelberry is keeping the Chicago office "to maintain a presence in the Midwest" and because of a client conflict with Ayer. 

   Ayer has relatively few accounts in the consumer packaged goods area, while P&amp;G, a C&amp;W client, is one of the most prestigious clients in that field. 
Moreover, C&amp;W's strong West Coast operations will allow Ayer to double its size there while becoming more involved in the region's high-technology businesses, Ayer said. 

   The acquisition, which is expected to close in the next few weeks, comes at a good time for Ayer. 
It currently faces the possibility of losing the lucrative U.S. Army account, for which it created the "Be All You Can Be" campaign. 
The Army has put its account up for bid on the heels of charges of impropriety by an Ayer executive dealing with the account. 
The service will choose an agency in January. 

   Ayer said its "eventual goal" is to combine the two advertising companies under the Ayer name. 
Louis T. Hagopian, Ayer's chairman, added that "if there are going to be consolidations of jobs, they are down the way, and we expect that economies of scale will come through attrition rather than layoffs." 
The combined agencies have 3,030 employees. 

   Three senior officers of Cunningham &amp; Walsh, New York, are expected to become directors of Ayer, which is closely held.
