   New American Bar Association resolutions
passed over Justice Department objections would restrict the
ability of federal investigators to subpoena lawyers or talk to
their clients.
   The resolutions dealing with the sensitive area of
attorney-client privilege were passed on voice votes Monday at the
ABA's midyear meeting in Los Angeles.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh dispatched Deputy Attorney
General Donald B. Ayer to appeal to the delegates to vote down the
resolution. But ABA officials said the 11th-hour lobbying came only
after the Justice Department refused for more than a year to
discuss the issues.
   The resolutions were the result of increased concern among the
nation's lawyers that federal prosecutors and criminal
investigators are violating the confidential relationship between
attorneys and clients.
   One resolution called for the Justice Department to obtain court
approval before issuing grand jury subpoenas for attorneys.
   Such subpoenas must be authorized by senior Justice Department
officials and have become more frequent over the last decade with
the increased investigation of white-collar crime and drug
trafficking.
   A second resolution criticized a memorandum issued last June by
Thornburgh that says federal prosecutors and agents investigating a
case may talk to people represented by counsel without getting the
permission of the lawyer.
   The ABA says this practice violates its Model Code of
Professional Responsibility as well as many state and local bar
ethics codes.
   The attorney general disputed that and said the Justice
Department would resist attempts by state and local bar groups to
impose ethics regulations ``to curb legitimate federal law
enforcement techniques.''
   Thornburgh argued that the ABA's restrictive interpretation of
the code of conduct could hamper legitimate law enforcement
efforts, such as contacts by Justice Department lawyers
investigating procurement fraud and employees of defense
contractors.
   ``A restrictive application of these local bar rules would
enable company counsel to control the government's access to the
company's employees,'' the attorney general wrote.
   The ABA report adopted along with the resolution said
Thornburgh's policy ``presents a substantive and substantial threat
to the administration of justice.''
   ``Suffice it to say, I don't agree with that characterization,''
Thornburgh told reporters in Washington before the ABA vote.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the resolutions
would ``have no immediate impact, and our views hold.''
   The Justice Department would wage a state-by-state fight against
any changes in the ethics code to inhibit federal prosecutors.
   On the issue of attorney subpoenas, Ayer told delegates in a
letter the resolution ``would substantially impede criminal
investigations.''
   ``The more difficult we make it to obtain unprivileged
information from attorneys, the more criminal enterprises will seek
out and hide behind unwitting or unscrupulous lawyers,'' Ayer wrote.
   Michael Ross, chairman of the ABA's grand jury section, said the
Justice Department sought a last-minute meeting to discuss the
issue after refusing to do so for 18 months.
   ``The war on drugs has convinced the government that the only
constituency it has to answer to is the man on the street,'' said
Ross, a former federal prosecutor who practices criminal defense
law in New York City.
   ``The man on the street doesn't care about individual rights but
cares about, understandably, the horrors that drugs bring with
it,'' he said.
   ``Clearly, attorney subpoenas will not solve the drug problem,''
Ross said. ``Clearly, ethics rules won't solve the drug problem.
But the guy on the street feels this is a get-tough policy.''
