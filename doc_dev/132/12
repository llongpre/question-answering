   NW Ayer Inc., an advertising agency, will likely agree to buy another agency, C&amp;W Group Inc., within the week, according to sources close to the negotiations. 

   The sources said that, barring unforeseen difficulties, an announcement will be made by the end of this week or early next week. 
Although it isn't clear how much closely held Ayer would pay, industry sources value C&amp;W in the $30 million range. 

   C&amp;W, parent of Cunningham &amp; Walsh Inc., creates advertising for clients such as American Home Products Corp. and Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Ayer clients include American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., Avon Products Inc. and Gillette Co. 

   C&amp;W is the largest unit of Mickelberry Corp., an advertising agency holding company. 
Mickelberry historically hasn't been a star advertising performer; while its revenue increased every year from 1983 to 1985, net income dropped steadily, and the company posted a $1.8 million loss last year. 
"You can't turn (a company) around on short notice," said Alan Gottesman, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin. 
"But they've had the time. 
If they were going to do something, they would have done it by now." 

   Mickelberry and Ayer officials declined to comment on the reports of the impending purchase. 

   Analysts and industry executives speculated that if Mickelberry sells C&amp;W it might use the proceeds to diversify into other businesses or liquidate itself. 
Without C&amp;W, it would only have a few relatively small advertising and marketing units. 
Mickelberry, which was founded in 1893, was a food-processing company before branching into communications more than a decade ago. 

   For Ayer, a purchase of C&amp;W couldn't come at a better time. 
Ayer is currently facing the possibility of losing the lucrative U.S. Army account, for which it created the "Be all you can be" campaign. 
The Army has put its account up for bid on the heels of charges of impropriety by an Ayer executive dealing with the account. 
It will choose an ad agency next month. 
If Ayer doesn't win the account, it would lose revenue while its overhead costs would remain the same, said Mr. Gottesman. 
It might need an acquisition "to fill that void." 

   C&amp;W billed $399.9 million in 1985 and was the 24th-largest ad agency. 
Ayer, with billings of $826.4 million, was ranked as the 18th-largest agency by Advertising Age, a trade publication.
