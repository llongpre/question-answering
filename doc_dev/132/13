To N.W. Ayer From J. Walter Thompson

   Burger King Corp. ended a five-month advertising agency review by awarding its $200 million domestic account to N.W. Ayer Inc., snubbing incumbent J. Walter Thompson Co. 

   The account move is believed to be the largest such switch in history. 
It deals a powerful blow to Thompson, Burger King's ad agency for 11 years. 
Miami-based Burger King had been Thompson's second-largest account, after Ford Motor Co., and contributed $15 million to $20 million a year in revenue, industry executives said. 

   "We're very disappointed. 
It's a big emotional loss and a large revenue loss," said Stephen G. Bowen Jr., president of U.S. operations for Thompson, a unit of London-based WPP Group PLC. 
"But we've known, even though we refused to quit," Mr. Bowen said, adding that "we've done our 1988 planning with the assumption that we wouldn't retain it." 
He said there will be layoffs, but declined to speculate on how many. 
More than 100 people worked on the Burger King account, with varying degrees of involvement. 

   Officials of Burger King and closely held Ayer didn't unveil a new ad campaign, and Charles S. Olcott, president of Burger King U.S.A., said Ayer commercials wouldn't appear until early 1988. 
But the new campaign likely will take a different tack from the current "The Best Food for Fast Times" campaign, which has been criticized in the industry as inconsistent and unfocused. 

   Burger King, a unit of Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co., could use a boost from advertising. 
Average unit sales were slightly above $1 million for the 12 months ended May 31, about flat with the previous year, Mr. Olcott said. 

   "What you're going to see is a consistent brand identity and less switching around," Mr. Olcott said in an interview after a press conference at a Burger King here. 
He said the new ads would emphasize the personal contact customers get at Burger King restaurants, as well as three selling points: "flame-broiling, 'Have it your way,' and quality food." 
He also said that Burger King and Ayer would step up local and regional marketing efforts. 

   The account switch is a setback for WPP Group, which purchased Thompson and its parent, JWT Group Inc., during the summer. 
JWT had been saddled with management turmoil and high turnover during the past year. 
After buying JWT, WPP Group was lauded for bringing back several highly respected former JWT officers, including Burton J. Manning, now Thompson's chairman and chief executive officer. 
Burger King is the first major client loss since WPP Group took over. 

   Although the account loss will hurt the ad agency, analysts said they aren't lowering earnings estimates for WPP Group. 
"There's probably going to be some minor setback to the earnings turnaround (at Thompson), but I don't know if it will be demonstrable," said Greg Ostroff, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. 

   Alan Gottesman, an analyst with L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg, Towbin, added that the Burger King account apparently wasn't highly profitable for Thompson, in part because it was on a fee basis that generated less revenue than the traditional 15% commission would have produced. 
Ayer will also operate on a fee rather than on a commission basis. 

   For Ayer, which was the nation's 15th-largest ad agency in 1986 according to Advertising Age, the account helps make up for a recent setback. 
In January, Ayer lost the $100 million U.S. Army account after 19 years of creating its advertising, including the slogan "Be All You Can Be." 

   Ayer was one of three finalists in the competition, along with Thompson and D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles Inc., a closely held agency here. 
At Ayer, some 50 to 70 employees have worked since early summer preparing the pitch, culminating last week in a polished presentation to Burger King that included finished commercials. 
"Last week," said Jerry J. Siano, Ayer's vice chairman, "was a constant all-nighter." 

   Ayer's competitors estimated that the agency spent in excess of $1 million to prepare its pitch. 
Mr. Siano declined to comment on the amount.
