   Continental Airlines said Friday it had
dismissed N.W. Ayer as its advertising agency, ending an
association that began in 1986.
   The Houston-based carrier, a unit of Texas Air Corp., notified
the agency late Thursday that it was placing its advertising
assignment up for review, the agency said.
   ``Ayer is no longer Continental's agency as of today,''
Continental spokesman Art Kent confirmed by telephone from Houston.
``We just felt it was time for a change.''
   He said he could not elaborate and did not know what steps were
being taken to get another agency.
   Ayer had been using the theme ``Working to be your choice'' in
Continental's advertising. Recent ads touting service to
warm-weather destinations used the line, ``We've got your place in
the sun.''
   Continental planned to spend an estimated $35 million to $40
million on its advertising this year, executives familiar with the
account said. Kent said he did not know the actual figure.
   Ayer, a privately-held agency based in New York, handles $1.3
billion in advertising billings worldwide and counts among its
clients American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., Procter &amp; Gamble Co.
and General Motors Corp.
   The decision came as a surprise to Ayer executives, said Vice
Chairman Thomas F. Maxey. ``We had no indication this was coming,''
he said.
   Ayer opened an office in Houston after it was awarded the
account in 1986, and the office currently employs about 30 people.
Ten to 15 more employees work on the Continental account in New
York.
   Maxey said it was likely that the Houston office would be closed
after an orderly transition. Ayer expects to continue servicing the
account for up to 90 days. In addition to the Continental account,
the Houston office handles only a few small public service
assignments at no charge.
   John Walsh, an executive vice president who oversees the
Continental account, said he understood that Continental's business
was improving although the industry has been troubled by declining
traffic and rising fuel costs.
   ``They said they felt they needed a change. In our estimation of
the situation, the situation was good and our work was good,'' he
said.
   Kent confirmed Continental's business was improving. He said the
airline earned $59.1 million for the first nine months of 1989, in
contrast to a loss of $215.9 million a year earlier.
   Texas Air also owns Eastern Airlines, which has been operating
since March under protection of federal bankruptcy laws and has
been losing millions of dollars.
   Airline accounts are particularly labor-intensive, industry
executives say, because of frequent price changes within the
industry and the need to develop different print ads for each
market.
   But Maxey said Ayer would be interested in going after another
airline account anyway. He said the agency handles advertising
assignments for Iberia Airlines, Air France and Scandanavian
Airline System.
   He said the agency is one of the finalists for four different
advertising assignments, which he declined to identify.
   In 1989, Ayer was fired by Burger King Corp. after working as
its ad agency for 18 months and producing the campaign, ``We do it
like you'd do it.'' The fast-food chain was spending $150 million a
year on its advertising then.
   Among Ayer's recent notable ads have been its commercials for
AT&amp;T long-distance service that featured people near the Berlin
Wall and a commercial for Phillip's Milk of Magnesia that used a
roll of toilet paper to illustrate the powers of the laxative.
