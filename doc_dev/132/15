   Burger King Corp. said Friday it is looking for
a new agency to handle its national advertising after just 18
months with N.W. Ayer Inc., the firm that created the slogan, ``We
Do It Like You'd Do It.''
   The Miami-based fast-food restaurant operator said it had
already selected three agencies to compete for the assignment and
expected to decide by summer.
   The decision was not entirely unexpected because the nation's
second largest fast-food chain has undergone extensive managerial
changes since its parent, Pillsbury Co., was acquired earlier this
year by Grand Metropolitan PLC of Great Britain.
   Burger King's sales have been sluggish and it has been unable to
increase its share of the fast-food market, now estimated at about
17 percent.
   One of the three finalists is the Chicago office of J. Walter
Thompson, whose New York office was Burger King's agency for 11
years until it was dumped in favor of Ayer in September 1987.
   The other two finalists, Burger King said, are D'Arcy Masius
Benton &amp; Bowles, New York, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, New
York.
   D'Arcy formerly worked for the Hardee's Food Systems fast-food
chain and its Los Angeles office currently is the agency for
Denny's restaurants.
   Saatchi created the ``Where's the Beef'' advertising campaign
for Wendy's International Inc. in the mid-1980s.
   Barry Gibbons, Burger King's chief executive, said he was
looking for a national agency ``with global capabilities, solid
industry experience, bold creative and media expertise and sound
strategic thinking _ and then have the determination to stick with
that agency.''
   He said the company had informally reviewed potential agencies
since January. The three finalists are expected to present
proposals to Burger King in three to four weeks after which a
decision will be announced.
   Gary Langstaff, Burger King's new marketing chief, said the
search for a new national agency ``does not apply to our regional
agency structure,'' which apparently means Ayer will continue
producing local advertising.
   Joyce Meyers, a Burger King spokeswoman, said Burger King's
marketing budget for 1989 is about $215 million including spending
on national and local advertising and promotions. She said no
decision has been made on how much of that figure will be spent on
national advertising alone this year.
   Officials at the New York-based Ayer said they handled about
$150 million in billings for Burger King last year, split fairly
evenly between national and local advertising.
   ``We are disappointed, surprised, but not unprepared,'' Louis T.
Hagopian, Ayer's chairman and chief executive, said in a memo
distributed to employees.
   He noted that in the time Ayer held the account, Pillsbury had
four different chief executives while Burger King had four chief
executives and four heads of marketing.
   ``It is just a shame the agency has to take the rap for the
errors and inconsistencies of so many others who have come and gone
and come and gone,'' he wrote.
   Hagopian said that while there may be some layoffs, the agency
would do so ``as considerately as is humanly possible.'' About 100
Ayer people work on the account.
   He said the account represents about 10 percent of the agency's
$1.5 billion in billings and that the agency's finances were strong.
   ``This is a blow, but it isn't even touching the foundations,''
he said.
   Ayer launched the ``We Do It Like You'd Do It'' campaign in
February 1988. The company has relied less heavily on the theme in
recent months, however, focusing on individual product promotion
instead.
   Burger King's Myers said the decision to select a new national
agency was not as much a reflection on Ayers's work as a desire by
the company's new management ``to start with clean sheet and signal
this is a new Burger King.''
