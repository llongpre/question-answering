   Burger King's new management moved Thursday to turn
around years of erratic advertising results by selecting two new
agencies to handle the major portion of its $215 million
advertising and marketing account.
   ``This is a non-traditional approach, but for us it is far more
important to be right, rather than conventional,'' said Barry J.
Gibbons, Burger King Corp.'s chief executive.
   D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles of New York will concentrate on
reinforcing brand identity, while Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising of
New York will concentrate on day-to-day brand retailing, Burger
King said.
   The agencies replace N.W. Ayer, the New York-based ad agency
hired 20 months ago that created the ``We do it like you'd do it''
theme Burger King began using in January 1988.
   The British-based conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC acquired
Burger King as part of its buyout of the Pillsbury Co., based in
Minneapolis, in January. The Miami-based Burger King is a
subsidiary of Pillsbury.
   Burger King, which had systemwide sales of $5.4 billion in 5,800
restaurants during fiscal year 1988, has had little or no sales
growth over the past four years although it has held on to its
second-place position in the fast-food market behind industry
leader McDonald's Corp.
   Average sales per restaurant slipped 1 percent last year, but
finished above $1 million for the fourth consecutive year, Burger
King said.
   The company estimates its market share has held fairly steady
over that period at about 17 percent.
   Gary L. Langstaff, hired in April as Burger King's executive
vice president of marketing after three years with Hardee's, said
the dual-agency approach is part of an overall effort to improve
the focus of Burger King advertising.
   ``There are two keys for us _ day-to-day and long-term branding.
Our goal is to make both of those work in tandem,'' Langstaff said.
   He said no decision had been made yet on how ad spending would
be split between the two new agencies. He also declined to estimate
when advertising from the new agencies may start running.
   Langstaff said Burger King will continue to work on a
project-by-project basis with both its national promotion agencies,
Einson-Freeman Inc., and August, Bishop and Meier. Burger King's
relationships are unchanged with other advertising agencies,
UniWorld Group Inc. and Castor Spanish International. UniWorld and
Castor create ads for Burger King aimed at minority markets.
   Burger King disclosed last month that it planned to replace Ayer
on the national portion of its advertising business, but said Ayer
would continue to produce regional advertising.
   With Thursday's announcement, Burger King indicated it would
sever all ties with Ayer after a brief transition period.
   Ayer was selected in September 1987 as Burger King's ad agency,
ending the fast-food company's 11-year association with J. Walter
Thompson of New York.
   Thompson's work for Burger King included a roundly criticized
1986 campaign that featured a search for the nerdy Herb, who had
never been to a Burger King.
   Subsequent campaigns from Thompson that used the themes ``This
is a Burger King Town'' and ``The Best Food for Fast Times'' failed
to spark sales.
   But Ayer's ``We do it'' campaign also failed to boost sales.
Burger King also underwent a series of unsettling management
changes during Ayer's tenure.
   ``It has been said many times that timing is everything,'' Jerry
Siano, the head of Ayer said Thursday in a memo to his employees.
``We were a year and a half early.''
   He said Grand Met has indicated ``a commitment to management
stability and marketing focus that will become the vital
ingredients to Burger King's future success. We wish them much
success.''
   A jubilant Edward J. Wax, chief executive officer of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, said he and other executives would travel soon to Miami to
begin defining roles and working up strategies.
   ``Obviously, we think they're a tremendous company,'' Wax said
from New York. ``There's a lot to be done, there's been a lot of
negative stuff written. It's a big challenge. But we're excited.''
   Wax called the two-agency approach fascinating and innovative
and said his earlier study of Burger King found strong management
commitment to improvement.
   His agency in the past has handled assignments for the fast food
operators Krystal, Wendy's, and Arby's, Wax said, and experienced
executives from those accounts will work on Burger King.
