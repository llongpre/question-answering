   N W Ayer Inc. agreed to pay the government $750,000 to settle overcharge claims involving advertising work for the Army stretching back to 1978. 

   The settlement documents contend that the New York-based advertising company knowingly mischarged the government by using inaccurate time cards and record keeping for the Army ad campaign that popularized the slogan "Be All You Can Be." 
The documents also contend that Ayer failed to obtain competitive bids for subcontracts. 

   In New York, officials of N W Ayer weren't available to comment on the matter. 

   The company was suspended in November 1986 from bidding on government contracts after Defense Department investigators asserted that N W Ayer overcharged the government. 

   Under terms of the settlement, the government agreed to lift the suspension. 
The company didn't admit any wrongdoing, but agreed to drop a civil suit against the U.S. seeking at least $525,000 in damages, and to tighten internal accounting and time-keeping procedures.
