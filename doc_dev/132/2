<LEADPARA>  The government Tuesday awarded $320,000 in damages to a couple whose trial and
wrongful convictions in the death of their infant daughter inspired the movie
"A Cry in the Dark.";    Lindy and Michael Chamberlain said their daughter was
carried away by a wild dog, or dingo. Their convictions were overturned after
a lengthy legal battle, and almost all of the damage award will go to legal
fees.  </LEADPARA>

WOMAN HAD BEEN SENT TO PRISON AFTER SAYING
DINGO KILLED BABY  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     The baby, Azaria, vanished from the couple's campsite near Ayers Rock in
central Australia in August 1980. Her body was never found.;    In 1982, Lindy
Chamberlain was convicted of murder and was sentenced to life in prison. Her
husband was found guilty of being an accessory after the fact.;    Many people
said they believed Lindy Chamberlain was guilty simply because she showed
little emotion during the trial.;    Lindy Chamberlain was freed in 1986 after
the infant's jacket, missing since the disappearance, was found near Ayers
Rock. In 1988, the Northern Territory government threw out the convictions.;  
 Northern Territory Attorney General Daryl Manzie said $306,000 of the award
would go to the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The church, which Michael
Chamberlain once served as a minister, covered the couple's legal expenses.;  
 The remaining money was being paid to the Chamberlains for the loss of their
car and personal effects.;    In a separate claim, the Chamberlains are
seeking $3.1 million in damages. That claim has not yet been heard by the
Northern Territory government.  </TEXT>
