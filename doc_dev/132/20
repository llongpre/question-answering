   N.W. Ayer Inc. lost its bid for a temporary restraining order to prevent the Army from awarding its advertising contract to another company. 

   N.W. Ayer, a New York-based advertising agency, sought the order in federal District Court here after the Army last week decided, as previously reported, to uphold the company's suspension from bidding on Army contracts. 

   Ayer, which was the Army's advertising agency for 19 years and created the successful "Be all that you can be" campaign, was suspended by the Army last November because of various allegations of irregularities in timekeeping and subcontracting. 
The Army's 1987 contract is expected to be decided soon. 

   Stephen Lawrence, a partner in the law firm Pepper, Hamilton &amp; Sheetz, which represents Ayer, said the company will continue to try to prevent a competitor from winning the Army contract. 
A spokesman for the Army couldn't be reached for comment.
