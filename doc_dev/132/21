   General Motors Corp.'s Saturn Corp. subsidiary has narrowed to three the number of agencies it will consider for its advertising account, the largest up for grabs in the ad industry. 

   New York-based N W Ayer Inc., Boston-based Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc. and San Francisco-based Hal Riney &amp; Partners Inc. were told earlier this week that they had been selected as the finalists in the Saturn competition, according to advertising industry executives. 

   Troy, Mich.-based Saturn is expected to decide by the end of May which agency will handle the car account. 
Saturn's annual billings are expected to total about $100 million, making it one of the largest accounts by ad industry standards. 

   Saturn officials declined to comment on the selection of ad agency finalists. 
Officials of N W Ayer, Hill Holliday, and Riney all acknowledged they had been contacted by Saturn this week, but declined to elaborate. 

   Late last year, Saturn had been contacted by some 50 agencies that expressed interest in getting the account. 
Saturn earlier this year narrowed its list to a handful of agencies, which also included D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles Inc.; TBWA Advertising Inc.; Jordan, McGrath, Case &amp; Taylor Inc.; and McCann-Erickson Worldwide &amp; Dailey &amp; Associates, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos. 

   There have been previous reports that N W Ayer and Hill Holliday were being considered for the Saturn account, but that Hal Riney was also being considered came as a surprise to many in the industry, including several who were competing for the Saturn account. 

   Riney grabbed headlines late last year when it resigned as the advertising agency for Modesto, Calif.-based E.&amp; J. Gallo Winery, after a brush with the Gallos. 
Riney was the creator of Gallo's Bartles &amp; Jaymes wine-cooler campaign. 
Other clients include Campbell Soup Co., Good Housekeeping Magazine and the California Prune Board. 

   But Riney also is the agency for Austin Rover Cars of North America's Sterling cars. 
Austin Rover is the U.S. sales arm of Rover Group PLC of Britain. 
Some ad executives said that could pose a potential conflict if Riney wins the Saturn competition. 

   However, Riney president Jim Travis yesterday said, "There's no problem with Sterling." 
Officials of both Sterling and Saturn "don't consider it a conflict" because "They're in entirely different markets," he said. 

   Hill Holliday, however, would likely have to resign from one of its advertising accounts if it succeeds in getting Saturn as a client. 
The agency represents Ford Motor Co.'s New England and New Jersey dealer groups. 
Hill Holliday also creates ads for Wang Laboratories, John Hancock Cos. and Revlon Group Inc. 

   N W Ayer's only automobile client is G.M., Saturn's parent. 
The agency does corporate advertising for the auto maker.
