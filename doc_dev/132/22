A Newport Beach woman who attempted suicide in her Santa Ana jail cell by 
hanging herself from a shower rod died Thursday night from related injuries, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Pauline Ayers, 45, had been held since Aug. 12 in the women's jail as a 
suspect in the fatal shooting of prominent Los Angeles attorney Gerald 
Goldfarb, a 49-year-old appellate lawyer and columnist for the Whole Life 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies conducting a routine check Thursday discovered the woman hanging from 
a bedsheet tied to a shower rod. Ayers, a former interior decorator, was alone 
in her cell when the attempted suicide occurred, Orange County Sheriff's Lt. 
Bob Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb died of multiple wounds to the head and body, and Ayers underwent 
surgery for a self-inflicted wound to the abdomen shortly after the shooting 
outside her Newport Beach condominium. 
</P>
<P>
Police alleged that Ayers fired 10 shots from a 12-gauge shotgun that she had 
bought just hours before the slaying. Investigators also allege that Goldfarb 
and Ayers had argued shortly before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers' attorney has said the woman mistook Goldfarb's friendship and legal 
counsel for a love relationship. Ayers' daughter, Christina Irwin, 27, said the 
two were romantically involved and were trying to have a child until Ayers 
suffered a mental breakdown early last year. WENDY PAULSON
