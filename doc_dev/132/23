   The Army said that, after reviewing an appeal by N.W. Ayer Inc., it has decided to uphold the advertising agency's suspension from bidding on government contracts. 

   Ayer, which was the Army's advertising agency for 19 years and created the successful "Be all that you can be" campaign, was suspended by the Army last November because of various allegations of improper timekeeping and subcontracting. 

   The continued suspension eliminates the company from competing for the Army's 1987 advertising contract, which is expected to be decided this week. 

   Ayer said that it plans to seek a temporary restraining order today to bar the Army from awarding the 1987 contract until the company can make a full appeal. 
The Army said it plans to oppose any such attempt.
