<HEAD>Fast-Food Giant Hires Two New York Ad Agencies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Burger King Corp., in an attempt to boost sluggish
sales and improve the focus of its advertising, has awarded most of
its $215 million account to two New York agencies.
   ``The concept of a dual-agency partnership allows for
synergizing some of the best minds in the advertising business,''
said Gary Langstaff, Burger King's executive vice president of
marketing.
   The fast-food giant's new management Thursday hailed the
unorthodox strategy, although some analysts speculated the two
agencies _ D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi _
could end up grappling for control of the account.
   ``I'm skeptical as to whether two agencies can put Burger King's
interest first over their own individual interests,'' said John
McMillin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York.
   D'Arcy will focus on Burger King's image, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
will concentrate on promotions and products, according to
restaurant executives.
   The agencies are expected to devise a marketing plan by Jan. 1,
Langstaff said. He said he won't know how the account will be
divided until they submit their plans.
   ``There's a lot to be done. There's been a lot of negative stuff
written,'' said Edward J. Wax, chief executive officer of Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi, who called the two-agency approach fascinating. ``It's a
big challenge. But we're excited.''
   His agency in the past has handled Wendy's and Arby's, Wax said,
and experienced executives from those accounts will work on Burger
King.
   Miami-based Burger King, taken over as part of Britain-based
conglomerate Grand Metropolitan's January acquisition of Pillsbury
Co., will continue working with several other advertising and
promotional agencies on special projects.
   The Pillsbury subsidiary had sales of $5.4 billion from 5,800
restaurants during fiscal 1988.
   Burger King fired N.W. Ayer Inc., which came up with the ``We do
it like you'd do it'' theme, as its national ad agency last month
after the campaign was criticized as ineffective. Ayer will stay on
through mid-August.
   Ayer was hired in September 1987 as Burger King ended an 11-year
association with J. Walter Thompson of New York. Thompson created
the highly criticized campaign featuring a search for Herb, a nerd
who had never been to a Burger King.
   Subsequent campaigns from Thompson that used the themes ``This
is a Burger King Town'' and ``The Best Food for Fast Times'' failed
to make a significant impression with fast-food customers.
   Langstaff, hired in April after three years with Hardee's, said
Burger King must carve out its own niche and develop its own image
to differentiate itself ``from the big boys,'' meaning McDonald's.
