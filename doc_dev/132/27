   An advertising executive, known as one of the
industry's authorities on print media, charged in a $7.5 million
lawsuit Wednesday that a Manhattan ad agency fired him because he
stutters.
   David C. Lehmkuhl, 42, was fired in March from his
$125,000-a-year position at Ammirati &amp; Puris Inc. after four months
on the job, according to the suit, which was filed in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan.
   During an afternoon meeting in his office, Edward Vick, the
firm's president, told Lehmkuhl he was being fired because, ``We
can't have you getting any closer to the clients,'' the suit said.
   Lehmkuhl is seeking $5 million in compensatory damages from
Ammirati &amp; Puris and $2.5 million in punitive damages.
   The plaintiff's attorney, Barry R. Fischer, said, ``I think this
will be a test case in the sense that this is a fairly high-ranking,
high executive in an industry, a well-known person and
well-compensated person who has been discriminated against in an
obvious way.''
   Vick said in a telephone interview that Lehmkuhl ``was fired for
not performing.'' He would not comment on Lehmkuhl's stuttering.
   ``The whole case is so far off base and so without merit, there
is almost no point in getting into a discussion of the specifics,''
he said, adding that his company intended to ``vigorously defend the
case.''
   Lehmkuhl is described in a December 1987 issue of Marketing &amp;
Media Decisions, a media trade journal, as one of the ad industry's
``most influential authorities on print media.''
   He worked for 18 years at the advertising firm N W Ayer Inc.
before being recruited by Ammirati &amp; Puris, the suit said. As senior
vice president at Ayer, he earned $90,000 plus a $10,000 bonus in
1988 and had 35 to 40 people reporting to him, the suit said.
   He was assigned to many of the agency's most prestigious
accounts, including AT&amp;T, Procter &amp; Gamble, Gillette and Ralston
Purina, it said.
   Jean Connolly, a member of Lehmkuhl's media staff at Ayer, was
quoted by Marketing &amp; Media Decisions as saying: ``He is brilliant.
He has a hard time communicating his ideas verbally, but he still
has this incredible reputation behind the scenes. Talk about unsung
heroes.''
   Fischer said in a telephone interview that his client ``tended to
have top subordinates do presentation type work. But there was no
evidence that it held him back in any way. His career speaks for
itself, that he has come a tremendous way despite his disability.''
   According to the suit, Lehmkuhl decided to leave Ayer when
Ammirati Puris offered him a $125,000-a-year position as senior vice
president and director of media services, as well free use of a BMW,
a $10,000 bonus and eligibility to participate in the executive
bonus pool beginning in 1989.
   The suit says Vick had met with Lehmkuhl more than once prior to
hiring him and was aware that he stuttered.
   During his first week on the job, Vick invited him to lunch; it
proved to be the turning point in their relationship, according to
the suit.
   ``Under the stress of the new job, Mr. Lehmkuhl's stutter was
more readily apparent,'' it said.
   ``The moment his disability manifested itself, Vick immediately
shunned Mr. Lehmkuhl and refused to offer even a modicum of
cooperation in trying to reasonably accommodate Mr. Lehmkuhl's
disability.''
   Lehmkuhl took steps to improve his speech. He signed up for
speech therapy classes and a public-speaking course, the suit said.
On March 15, he was fired.
   Fischer said his client is currently a ``self-employed consultant
in the media business,'' making a fraction of what he used to earn.
