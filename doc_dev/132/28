   Pillsbury Co., conceding a series of failed corporate strategies, promised major changes at its Burger King unit following the resignation of J. Jeffrey Campbell, head of its ailing restaurant business. 

   Pillsbury executives also criticized Burger King's advertising agency, N W Ayer Inc., at a conference for institutional investors yesterday. 
"They need to strengthen their copy," Roger L. Headrick, Pillsbury's chief financial officer, said of Ayer, which is responsible for Burger King's disappointing new ad campaign, "We do it like you'd do it." 

   While Mr. Headrick said Pillsbury was "pleased" with Ayer, he said Burger King's promotions must become more focused and effective. 
"We need to bring the customer back," he said. 

   Jack Rayher, Ayer's supervisor on the Burger King account, said the New York-based agency was aware of the criticism. 
"Reaction by consumers wasn't as great on certain attributes (of the campaign) as we hoped it would be, but we know now how to fix it," he said. 
New commercials will appear this fall, he said. 

   Burger King dropped WPP Group PLC unit J. Walter Thompson Co. in favor of Ayer last September, when the chain's sales failed to pick up. 
Thompson had some early successes with the fast-food giant's advertising before running into trouble with the disastrous "Herb the Nerd" and the unpopular "The Best Food for Fast Times" campaigns. 

   Ayer itself came under criticism almost from the start as industry executives derided its campaign and said that Ayer, a much smaller agency than Thompson, didn't have the network of offices needed to support regional and local marketing efforts. 
Industry sources earlier this year said Burger King was pouring $200 million into Ayer's new ad campaign. 

   Mr. Headrick said Burger King also needs to reduce employee turnover and to improve training, cleanliness and service. 
He said the world's second-largest restaurant chain -- behind McDonald's Corp. -- already is adding managers to stores and installing computer equipment "so that managers spend more time serving their customers and less on paperwork." 

   Mr. Campbell, who resigned last week as chairman of Pillsbury's restaurant group, was to have shared the podium at the conference. 
The company is dividing his duties between two other Pillsbury officials. 

   Pillsbury also said that while it expects to report record operating earnings for the year ended May 31, massive restructuring charges already taken will reduce net per-share earnings to the 80-cent to 85-cent range. 
In fiscal 1987, Pillsbury earned $2.10 a share. 
The 1988 per-share estimate would indicate fourth-quarter earnings of between 55 cents and 60 cents, compared with 37 cents a year ago. 
Revenue for the food processor and restaurant concern rose slightly to about $6.20 billion in the latest fiscal year from $6.13 billion a year earlier, Pillsbury said. 

   In a review of the company, Pillsbury's interim chairman, William H. Spoor, admitted to "the failures of past strategies." 
Mr. Spoor said directors recently approved a new strategic plan "that will restore our position as a premier corporation." 

   To regain momentum in its consumer foods business, he said the company would make fewer new grocery items, bucking an industry trend toward creating an avalanche of look-alike offerings. 

   While volume for the consumer foods group was up 1% last year, profit declined because of $66 million in pretax restructuring charges required to drop five product lines, consolidate plants and cut overhead, said John L. Morrison, chairman of the packaged-foods business. 
Refrigerated dough, the group's largest business, posted good profit gains, but dessert mixes and seafoods encountered stiff competition. 
Mr. Morrison also said a disastrous effort to crack the deluxe frozen pizza market has been abandoned. 

   Most of Pillsbury's charge-offs came on the restaurant side, where new concepts such as takeout Chinese food were abandoned and dozens of Burger Kings, Steak &amp; Ales and Bennigan's units were closed or remodeled. 
Company restaurant revenue declined 4% to $2.6 billion in fiscal 1988, the company said, due to lower per-store sales and a major profit shortfall at Distron, the company's restaurant supply house. 
Pillsbury expects to release its final results for 1988 next week. 

   In what is expected to be his last appearance before investors, Mr. Spoor said he hopes a new chief executive officer being sought by the company would preside at Pillsbury's annual meeting in September. 
Mr. Spoor came out of retirement after his hand-picked heir, John M. Stafford, resigned under pressure last February. 

   Pillsbury common stock closed at $36, down 75 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
