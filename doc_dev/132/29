   A 25-year-old man who was put behind bars
eight years ago for rape and robbery went free after someone who
looks like him confessed, attorneys said.
   Randall Lynn Ayers _ who was sent to prison for 14 to 50 years
in 1982 in the rape, robbery and shooting of a 15-year-old girl _
was ordered released Friday by Common Pleas Judge Thomas Crush
after police said another man had confessed.
   ``It was a long wait,'' Ayers said. ``I didn't believe this
would happen. I had given up.''
   Ayers' attorney, Elizabeth Agar, said her client looks like the
other man. ``Basically the only evidence in the case was eyewitness
testimony,'' Ms. Agar said. ``You can see how a witness could make
a mistake.''
   Prosecutors would not identify the man who confessed.
   However, sources in the police department speaking on condition
of anonymity told The Cincinnati Post the man who confessed was
Robert Minton, 29, charged earlier this week in the slaying of two
Cincinnati women.
   Senior Assistant Prosecutor Mark Piepmeier asked Crush to set
aside Ayers' conviction. According to Piepmeier, a police
investigator said the man who confessed offered details of the
crime that ``fit all the way down the line.''
   The victim of the 1981 attack looked at Ayers and the man who
confessed and could not identify which was her assailant, Piepmeier
said.
   Ayers was a 17-year-old high school senior when he was charged.
The girl was robbed of $1 and shot in the neck. Friends testified
at his trial that he was with them at the time.
   ``A jury convicted Randy Ayers,'' said Judge Crush. ``I
expressed the opinion at the time that I would not have convicted
him had it been tried to me.''
