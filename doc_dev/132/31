   Discovery lost six
heat-shield tiles and sustained some ``dings'' during its four-day
mission, one of the most successful flights in the shuttle program,
NASA officials said.
   Work on the shuttle continued today in a round-the-clock effort
to prepare the orbiter for its return to Cape Canaveral, Fla., and
its next trip into space. The piggyback ride home aboard a modified
Boeing 747 is scheduled for Saturday.
   Discovery landed Monday morning on the hard clay bed of Rogers
Dry Lake at this Mojave Desert air base, capping a nearly flawless
flight that was America's first manned space mission since the
Challenger tragedy in 1986.
   ``Six tiles on the right wing are missing. They were no problem
_ not critical,'' said Ted Ayers, deputy site manager for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Dryden Flight
Research Facility here.
   ``Everything's great'' because lost tiles only pose a danger if
they are in an area that undergoes intense heating during re-entry,
Ayers said.
   ``We've got some normal dings in the tile under the vehicle,''
he added. ``These are nicks from dirt particles on the lakebed.''
   Preliminary inspection showed no damage to the shuttle's landing
gear, tires or brakes, which were improved because of brake and
tire damage during previous missions, he said.
   Ayers said the shuttle took 7,451 feet to roll to a stop when it
landed at 9:37 a.m. Monday.
   After hours of initial work on the lakebed, a vehicle towed the
Discovery to the area where NASA workers began preparing it for its
return to Florida.
   Some of the first efforts included removing experiments from the
shuttle and shipping them to researchers around the nation, Ayers
said.
   NASA shuttle boss Richard Truly said earlier Monday that he
walked around the shuttle after it landed.
   ``It looks beautiful,'' he said. ``There is not a lot of tile
work to be done.''
   Discovery Commander Rick Hauck said that during the flight, the
shuttle ``was like a well-oiled machine.''
   Tasks to prepare Discovery for the trip home include
deactivating fuel cells, photographing tile damage and replacing
missing tiles, purging main engines and orbital maneuvering
engines, attaching locks to prevent control flaps from fluttering,
and lifting the orbiter 60 feet in a ``mate-demate'' device that
places it atop the Boeing jet.
