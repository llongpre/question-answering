   After a few years of relative calm, Burger King is about to start a new advertising campaign that attacks the way McDonald's cooks. 
And McDonald's Corp., taking advantage of its heavyweight status, has lured General Motors Corp. and Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. into what will be one of the biggest giveaways in marketing history. 
Oldsmobile alone is offering 600 cars as prizes. 

   At stake is both companies' share of the $25 billion fast-food hamburger market. 
For the past few years, McDonald's has been eating Burger King's lunch, raising its share to 36% while Burger King's has slipped slightly to below 17%. 

   Burger King's nervous franchisees, still upset over the disastrous Herb the Nerd promotion that bombed two years ago, are wondering whether the chain also has forgotten how to pitch hamburgers. 
Some analysts say that if Burger King fails to turn around soon, heads will roll at the top. 

   "I view it as the key to getting this company's earnings up and running again," says L. Craig Carver, a securities analyst at Dain Bosworth &amp; Co., Minneapolis. 
"Burger King has had virtually no advertising for the better part of a year now." 

   Neither chain, nor their ad agencies, will talk about the pending promotional blitzes. 
But industry sources say Burger King USA, a unit of Pillsbury Co., is pouring $200 million into the new ad campaign by N.W. Ayer &amp; Co., which touts broiling burgers over frying them. 
In 1982, the last time Burger King tried that approach, hamburger sales improved. 
McDonald's also sued, claiming misleading advertising, but later settled out of court. 

   The campaign won't be aired for another two weeks. 
Franchisees who have seen the ads say one TV commercial mentions the competition. 
Noting the grill char marks on his hamburger, one youngster remarks to a buddy, "Gee, I can't get those at McDonald's." 

   McDonald's isn't saying what its response might be. 
But it, too, is planning to recycle the successful Monopoly advertising pitch it used last spring. 

   On April 1, it will roll out Monopoly II, a $50 million promotion that sources say will offer several $1 million cash prizes as well as 600 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes and merchandise from Sears. 

   The McDonald's campaign makes generous use of "tie-ins," a popular advertising strategy that combines several companies in a single promotion. 
Industry sources say General Motors will spend a hefty $25 million promoting the contest and on the Oldsmobile giveaways. 
Sears wouldn't say what merchandise it would contribute or how much it would spend. 

   For Burger King, the campaign is a big test of Ayer, its new ad agency. 
Unhappy at its inability to dent McDonald's, Burger King last year dumped J. Walter Thompson Co., a JWT Group Inc. unit, in one of the biggest agency switches ever. 
McDonald's ad agency is Leo Burnett Co. 

   While declining to discuss the coming campaign, Ayer USA Chairman Jerry Siano said the agency would "refocus on a burger. 
That's key to whatever we're going to try." 

   Outsiders say that is the best bet. 
"Over the last five years, broiling has been the only successful strategy they've ever used," says Al Ries, a New York-based marketing strategist who has worked for Burger King. 

   Still, there is some skepticism that the approach will work this time. 
Mr. Reis says research suggests most people think Burger King hamburgers taste better, but they still show up at McDonald's. 

   "It's going to be critical to Burger King that they execute once the customer is inside the door," says Richard E. Pyle, who tracks restaurants for the Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood brokerage house in Minneapolis. 
"The experience has to deliver the promise in the ad. 
Delivery is where the questions have been raised in the past." 

   McDonald's is practically in a no-lose situation, analysts say. 
The contest is sure to increase the number of times customers visit, says George Rice, a Chicago-based restaurant consultant. 
Last year, says Mr. Pyle, McDonald's improved profit with currency gains at overseas outlets and by introducing salads. 

   "We don't anticipate either will have as much impact this year, so they'll have to bring in the traffic through some sort of promotion," he says.
