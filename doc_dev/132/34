   Mr. Ayer, as executive vice president, has been
responsible for domestic property-casualty operations since
May 1990. With the new title, Mr. Ayer will also assume
responsibility for the unit's international insurance
operations. The two operations account for about 76% of the
profit for the insurance subsidiary, which reported
fourth-quarter net income of $67 million after taking a
charge of $33 million.
