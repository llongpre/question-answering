<HEAD>British Philosopher A. J. Ayer Dies</HEAD>

   Sir Alfred J. Ayer, the British philosopher who
helped popularize the notion that all philosophy can be reduced to
linguistic analysis, died Tuesday night. He was 78.
   Ayer died after a lengthy respiratory illness in University
College Hospital, said journalist Nigella Lawson, whose late mother,
Vanessa, was Ayer's third wife.
   Ayer was known to generations as A. J. Ayer and to friends as
``Freddie.''
   His first book, ``Language, Truth and Logic,'' in 1936 was the
first exposition of logical positivism in the English language.
   The movement, which Ayer helped to develop in Britain, expounds
the view that philosophical problems of the past can be reduced to
linguistic analysis, and that any idea that cannot in principle be
verified by sensory observation is nonsensical.
   Ranging widely between the ideas of linguistic philosophers
Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein, it accepts that language
must be strictly analyzed and redefined if there is any possibility
of using it as an intelligible means of logical argument.
   The philosophical school of linguistic analysts now dominates
many British and American universities.
   ``Language, Truth and Logic,'' which jolted the metaphysicians by
its assault on ``much of what has passed for philosophy,'' owed a
debt to empiricists such as Russell and Rudolph Carnap. It brought
the term ``logical positivist'' to the attention of British
academics.
   ``I maintain that there is nothing in the nature of philosophy to
warrant the existence of conflicting philosophical `schools,''' he
wrote. ``And I attempt to substantiate this by providing a
definitive solution of the problems which have been the chief
sources of controversy between philosophers in the past.''
   ``The principles of logic and metaphysics are true simply because
we never allow them to be anything else,'' he added.
   Ayer wrote ``The Foundations of Empirical Knowledge'' in 1940 and
``The Problem of Knowledge'' in 1956, as well as volumes of
philosophical essays and histories of modern philosophy in which he
extended the traditions of British empiricism.
   Born Oct. 29, 1910, Ayer was the only child of a French-Swiss
father and a Dutch-Jewish mother. His father, Jules, a timber
merchant, became a naturalized British subject before the birth of
his son.
   Educated at Eton and at Oxford University, he was a philosophy
lecturer and research student at Christ Church, Oxford, from 1932 to
1944, and dean of Wadham College, Oxford in 1945-1946. He served as
an intelligence officer in France during World War II.
   Ayer was professor of mind and logic at University College London
from 1946 to 1959, then professor of logic at the University of
Oxford and fellow of New College, Oxford, until 1978.
   He was a visiting professor at New York University in 1948-1949,
at City College, New York, in 1961-1962, and at Bard College in New
York State, from 1987.
   Ayer earned a first-class literary humanities degree at Oxford
University in 1932, then spent several months in Vienna where he
came under the lasting influence of the Werner Kreis, a school of
Austrian philosophers dominated by Wittgenstein and Carnap.
   In the 1930s, he introduced and popularized at Oxford University
severe Viennese philosophical attitudes when Oxford philosophy was
considered vague and explanatory rather than opinionated.
   Ayer married Grace Lees in 1932, and they had two children. His
second marriage, to American journalist Dee Wells, ended in divorce
23 years later in 1983. He then married Vanessa Lawson, former wife
of Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, Nigel Lawson. She died two
years later.
