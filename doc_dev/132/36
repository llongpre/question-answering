After a nationwide search, Ohio State promoted from within today when Randy 
Ayers was named to succeed Gary Williams as the Buckeyes' head basketball 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
The selection of Ayers, Williams' top assistant, was announced at a news 
conference by Athletic Director Jim Jones. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe we've conducted a very thorough national search," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
1st Black in Job 
</P>
<P>
Ayers, the Buckeyes' 11th basketball coach and the first black to hold the job, 
said he hopes to maintain "the honesty and integrity" of the school's program. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a deep sense of gratification . . . for the high honor," Ayers said. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment must be approved by the university board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement ended a three-week search for a replacement after Williams 
resigned to take over at Maryland, his alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Although Ayers, 33, has never been a head coach, he was Williams' top assistant 
after being elevated to full-time status in May, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson had been a front-runner for the job after two 
other candidates -- Jim Crews of Evansville and Lon Kruger of Kansas State -- 
withdrew from contention Friday. 
</P>
<P>
But Richardson announced Sunday that he had withdrawn his name from 
consideration, saying he made his decision when he compared the comforts of 
Fayetteville, Ark., to the big-city living that would come with a job in 
Columbus.
