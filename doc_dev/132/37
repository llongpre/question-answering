   The advertising agency Lord Geller Federico
Einstein Inc., in turmoil since a number of top-level executives
quit to form their own agency in mid-March, said Wednesday it has
added two senior executives from other advertising agencies to its
management team.
   The agency, a unit of WPP Group PLC, named Agi Clark, a 19-year
veteran of the agency N.W. Ayer, and Tim Elliott, formerly of
Ogilvy &amp; Mather, to senior management.
   Clark was named executive vice president and managing director
for creative services at Lord Geller. She had been with Ayer for 19
years, most recently overseeing creative work on the AT&amp;T
Communications, Gillette and J.C. Penney accounts, Lord Geller
announced.
   Elliott was named Lord Geller's chief operating officer. At
Ogilvy &amp; Mather, he had worked on the American Express Co. account.
   They join the current management group which includes Norman
Geller as chairman, Gene Federico as vice chairman and J. William
Wardell as president.
   The agency has been in tumult since March 18 when six top
executives, including Lord Geller founders Richard Lord and Arthur
Einstein Jr., walked off the job. The executives said they felt
unduly constrained by the management of WPP Group, the British
marketing concern that acquired the agency as part of its purchase
last summer of the JWT Group Inc.
   They have formed their own agency, Lord, Einstein, O'Neill &amp;
Partners.
   WPP Group has sued departing executives, accusing them of
breaching their fiduciary duties in leaving the firm and conspiring
to take away Lord Geller's business.
   The suit is pending in New York state court.
