   Burger King Corp. on Wednesday unveiled an
advertising campaign featuring a new slogan and original songs by
well-known artists, less than six months after a marketing overhaul
at the nation's second-largest fast-food chain.
   The eight television and 10 radio spots, many featuring the
slogan ``Sometimes you've gotta break the rules,'' are scheduled to
air next month across the country.
   Burger King, which budgeted nearly $215 million for advertising
this year, replaced N.W. Ayer Inc. with two New York-based
advertising agencies in April and hired an executive from rival
Hardee's to help remold the company's image after several marketing
flops and sluggish sales.
   ``There will be a lot less emphasis on the product itself and
more of a focus on how people will perceive the company as a
whole,'' said Gary Langstaff, executive vice president for
marketing, who left No.3 Hardee's in April.
   Ayer, which held the Burger King account for about a year,
created the ``We Do It Like You'd Do It'' campaign. Analysts blamed
lackluster advertising, frequent management changes and
inconsistent quality for Burger King's recent failure to keep pace
with No. 1 McDonald's.
   Miami-based Burger King has average annual store sales of about
$1 million, compared with McDonald's nearly $1.6 million per store.
   The new television ads, designed by D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp;
Bowles and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, will premier Oct. 4. They
feature light-hearted sketches, including an aircraft carrier crew
anxiously awaiting its ``orders'' of hamburgers and a teen-age boy
fantasizing about a date in one of the restaurants.
   For the radio ads, top performers such as Mel Torme, blues
singer John Lee Hooker and rapper Tone-Loc wrote original songs
incorporating the new slogan. During a two-week period beginning
Oct. 1, the ads will be run about 1,000 times nationwide, said
Burger King spokeswoman Cori Zywotow.
   Spanish-language songs will be aired in several major Hispanic
markets, such as Miami, Los Angeles and San Antonio, Texas.
   Burger King, which laid off about a third of its 1,500
non-restaurant employees in April, also announced several new
programs for workers in conjunction with the new ad campaign.
   Employees selected by management for extraordinary customer
service will be featured in upcoming television commercials and
paid actors' wages. Also, employee ideas will be used in a redesign
of restaurant staff uniforms.
   The company plans to establish a toll-free customer complaint
and information line next year.
   ``A year from now, we will look much different,'' said Barry
Gibbons, chief executive officer of the Miami-based chain.
   Food and beverage giant Grand Metropolitan PLC of Great Britain
acquired Burger King from Pillsbury Co. in January. Burger King
operates about 5,900 restaurants worldwide and reported sales last
year of more than $5.4 billion.
