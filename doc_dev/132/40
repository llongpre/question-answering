   ``A Cry in the Dark'' (Warner Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.95.
Rated PG-13)
   
   Another movie with Meryl Streep showing off a foreign accent.
That was the joke last fall when the prodigious actress starred in
``A Cry in the Dark'' as an Australian mother wrongfully accused of
murdering her infant daughter.
   But this grim tale, based on a true story, is a lot more than a
vehicle for Streep to astonish with her facility for the cadences
of an exotic dialect. It's a gripping account of how press, police
and prosecutors unwittingly conspired to send an innocent woman to
jail for several years.
   Streep plays Lindy Chamberlain, wife of a Seventh-day Adventist
minister and mother of three young children, who goes on a camping
trip with her family to mammoth Ayers Rock. One night a dingo, a
wild dog of the outback, steals into the tent where 9-week-old
Azaria is sleeping, kills the baby and runs off with her into the
wilderness.
   The film leaves no doubt this is what happened, and at first
witnesses, police and the media seem sympathetic to the family's
tragedy. But as time goes by and no body is found _ only some
bloodstained clothes _ gossip and speculation begin to arise in the
tabloid press and on television talk shows that Mrs. Chamberlain
may have killed the child herself.
   Various forensic ``experts'' add credence to this theory from
studying the blood and rips on the baby's garments, and soon Mrs.
Chamberlain is on trial for murder and her husband as an accessory.
Both are convicted, and she is sentenced to life imprisonment at
hard labor, while pregnant with her fourth child.
   Streep's performance is impressive, especially her refusal to
soften the mother's aloof, at times hard-bitten personality, which
prevents the jury from sympathizing with her. Sam Neill does well
in the less-interesting role of her husband, who suffers a crisis
of faith and even turns on his wife when the pressure becomes too
much for him.
   Director Fred Schepisi maintains a claustrophobic atmosphere
that keeps our attention riveted on the seemingly unbelievable
nightmare into which the Chamberlains are dragged. He and Robert
Caswell adapted their screenplay from John Bryson's book ``Evil
Angels.''
   The moviemakers' timing was better than they could have
anticipated. Last September, just as the film was about to be
released, Mrs. Chamberlain was formally cleared of all charges.
   Not a movie for a casual night's light entertainment, but a
strong, provocative piece of work that documents with chilling
realism one of the more amazing criminal justice stories of our
time.

   ``Midnight Cop'' (Vidmark. VHS, $79.95. Rated R)
   
   ``Midnight Cop'' is not a bad little mystery, with its blend of
blackmail, murder and mayhem in the German underworld. And to add a
little spice, a little pornography and incest are thrown in.
   The movie clearly deserves its R rating, with a good bit of
nudity, sexual situations and bloody violence. But star Morgan
Fairchild doesn't shed very much beyond her undies.
   One could ask what she's doing in this movie, which also stars
Michael York and Frank Stallone. They just don't fit in with the
teutonic tone of the flick. And the movie is actually carried by
German actor Armin Mueller-Stahl, who plays a burned-out, woman
chasing, hard drinking detective named Alex Conrad. He's the type
usually found in the LAPD or NYPD, rather than with the stiff
discipline styled Prussian cops.
   The movie also has a continuity problem with some characters
speaking English while others speak German. There's also a bit of
dubbing. These incongruities tend to throw off the pace of the
story, an exploration of the classic outlaw side of society.
   While investigating the death of a young dancer, Alex hooks up
with Lisa (Fairchild), and battles a vicious drug dealer
(Stallone). York plays a district attorney who is obviously not
quite what he seems to be.
   The video also has some truly comic moments, mostly involving
Mueller-Stahl.

   ``Rocket Gibralter'' (RCA-Columbia Home Video. VHS-Beta, $89.98.
Rated PG)
   
   No one is more fun to watch than Burt Lancaster as an eccentric.
That gentle face is so forgiveable, though his antics in ``Rocket
Gibralter'' _ as in ``Atlantic City'' and ``Local Hero'' _ can
annoy those around him.
   And Lancaster does not disappoint as Levi Rockwell in Daniel
Petrie's endearing tale of a man who knows he is soon to die.
Rockwell is about to turn 77 and his four children and eight
grandchildren have gathered to celebrate at his gracious spread on
New York's Long Island.
   The family is close and caring, although perhaps a little too
pretty, well-off and hip to engender complete sympathy. Their
problems are sometimes hard to relate to, such as a son-in-law who
is a professional pitcher having trouble with his curve ball.
   Rockwell, a widower who says he has come to live 90 percent in
the past, seems to communicate best with his young grandchildren,
who accept his ideas about the proper way to die without the
emotional turmoil the adults display. And it is the grandchildren's
acceptance of Rockwell's wish for a Viking funeral that makes for a
sweet and moving conclusion to the 1988 film.
   Well-acted and well-written, ``Rocket Gibralter'' would make a
good introduction to a discussion with older children about death.
It also has a lovely soundtrack of original Billie Holiday songs.
