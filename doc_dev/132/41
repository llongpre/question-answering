   WPP Group PLC named two senior executives from competing advertising agencies to fill top spots at its Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein ad agency unit. 

   Tim Elliott, 40, a former senior vice president and group director at Ogilvy &amp; Mather, was named chief operating officer. 
Agi Clark, 46, a senior vice president and managing director of creative services at N.W. Ayer, was named executive vice president and managing director of creative services. 

   The two were brought in by WPP's chief executive officer, Martin Sorrell, to fill a management gap caused by the walkout of the agency's six top executives last month. 
The new managers join the agency's three remaining top executives: J. William Wardell, president; Norman Geller, chairman; and Gene Federico, who yesterday was named vice chairman, relinquishing the title of director of creative services he assumed after the exodus. 

   "I hope it's going to be a partnership between the five of us. 
We'll each exert our strengths rather than it being hierarchical," Mr. Elliott said yesterday. 
Mr. Wardell added that Lord Geller doesn't plan to hire any other top managers soon, but will concentrate on bringing in "next tier" operating people. 
More than 30 people have quit since the top executives walked out to form a new agency last month; most of them have joined the new agency. 

   Ms. Clark succeeds Kevin O'Neill, one of the departed executives. 
At Ayer, she was the top creative executive on the AT&amp;T Communications business, including its "Reach Out and Touch Someone" campaign. 

   The 19-year Ayer veteran said that when she first met with Mr. Sorrell almost two weeks ago at the suggestion of a headhunter, "I expected this ogre with 20 horns. 
But I liked him. 
I think he's a straight-talking man." 
She said that a first step when she starts Monday will be to bring in new people, perhaps drawing on employees from Lord Geller's sister agency J. Walter Thompson Co., and on free-lancers. 

   Mr. Elliott was the lead account manager on Ogilvy's largest account, American Express Co. 
At Lord Geller, he succeeds Edward D. Yaconetti, one of the six departed executives. 
He said that Mr. Sorrell made it clear that "he doesn't want to interfere in the operation." 

   Neither executive would comment on pay, but industry executives say Mr. Sorrell offered generous compensation packages, including some guarantees if the agency runs into problems. 
The executives' positions at their previous agencies haven't yet been filled.
