   WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, W.Va. -- The ad industry's top
executives meet today to tackle their biggest marketing
challenge: persuading their clients to spend money.
   As the annual conference of the American Association of
Advertising Agencies convenes, recession-weary advertisers
are cutting ad spending at an alarming rate. Times are so
tough for ad agencies that conference attendance at the
Greenbrier, a genteel golf-and-tennis resort where rooms can
top $500 a day, is at its lowest ebb in more than a decade.

   Fewer than 450 executives are expected, down from more
than 600 last year and a far cry from the 1981 high of more
than 800. "The economy in general is bad -- and the
advertising economy is very bad," says John O'Toole, the
trade association's president. The title of his keynote
speech today: "Remembering a Year Best Forgotten."
   Trying desperately to reverse the ad-spending trend,
executives here have armed themselves with piles of studies,
which all come to the same conclusion: Advertisers that
continue to spend or even increase ad spending during a
recession gain market share at the expense of rivals. The ad
executives are mounting their own ad campaigns to try to get
that message across.
   The association itself is about to unveil a series of ads
featuring top executives, including Ira C. Herbert, president
of Coca-Cola Co.'s North American operations, saying things
like, "The surest, swiftest way to achieve corporate
anonymity is to stop advertising." The media has joined in
the act with similar ads. The Newspaper Advertising Bureau
this week announced a campaign suggesting that "trimming
newspaper from your ad budget" will lead to "a cut in sales."
The Wall Street Journal has run an ad summarizing recession
research and saying, "recessionary advertising works."
   The ad industry, though, may be talking to itself -- and
clients may not be listening. The ad agency association, for
example, has distributed more than 4,000 booklets capsulizing
research showing the benefits of advertising during economic
downturns titled, "Advertising in a Recession: The Best
Defense is a Good Offense."
   "Can I tell you a lot of advertisers have changed their
minds because of this?" asks Keith Reinhard, chairman of
Omnicom Group's DDB Needham ad agency and outgoing chairman
of the association. "Not yet."
   The association's booklet cites the case of Chevrolet,
which increased ad spending for its fuel-saving economy
models during the 1975 recession, even as Ford cut
advertising by 14%. Chevrolet gained market share at the
expense of its rival. A McGraw-Hill study of 468 companies
during that recession found the same pattern: Those that
maintained or increased ad spending showed better sales
growth than those that cut spending, the booklet says.
   Ad agencies, including Ayer and DDB Needham, have weighed
in with new research papers of their own. Ayer suggests
tailoring ad programs to poorer, harsher realities, citing
previous recession campaigns like the "A-1 Steak Sauce isn't
just for sirloin anymore" ads showing people slopping the
sauce on humble hamburger rather than steak. Counsels the
Ayer report: "Top executives should cash in on the
opportunity that rival companies {with lower ad spending} are
creating for them."
   The most ambitious of the new studies comes from WPP
Group's Center for Research &amp; Development. The study analyzed
749 businesses over a four-year period and found that
"advertisers who increase spending -- whether modestly or
aggressively -- achieve greater market-share gains than those
who cut their advertising investment." The study would have
seemed like a good marketing tool for WPP units Ogilvy &amp;
Mather and J. Walter Thompson, except that WPP didn't take
its own advice: Immediately after the study was issued last
fall, WPP closed the center's doors in a cost-cutting move.
   Ad executives are well aware that they are preaching to
the converted as they tell each other how important it is for
clients to continue spending. But like the annoying chant of
Wisk's "Ring around the collar," they won't be silenced.
"We've got to keep it up and wear away to show advertisers
that it is in their interest to advertise during a
recession," says the association's Mr. O'Toole. "It doesn't
necessarily work overnight."

   Ayer Loses Citibank
                                                                                                       

   Citicorp pulled its estimated $10 million New York branch
Citibank account from Ayer and awarded it to Foote, Cone &amp;
Belding, the Chicago-based agency that handles the bulk of
Citicorp's account.
   "We're continuing to develop a global communications
strategy to make sure that there's consistency among our
businesses world-wide, particularly on the advertising side,"
a spokesman explained the consolidation. The account is
expected to be serviced at Foote Cone's New York agency,
FCB/Leber Katz Partners.
   Ayer told its employees that this won't affect the
agency's role on Citicorp's corporate account, but officials
at both Ayer and Citicorp said that account isn't active.
"Conflicts and consolidations are a world-wide reality of
this business," said Dom Rossi, president of Ayer's New York
office. "We wish Citibank well." Ayer's direct marketing unit
will continue to do work for Citicorp bank cards.
   Foote Cone handles bank advertising for branches in
California, Florida, and a number of other states, and
Citicorp advertising in more than 10 countries. In late 1989,
Citicorp awarded the Citicorp Savings Illinois account, which
had been handled at Ayer's Chicago office, to Foote Cone.

   EVEREADY UPDATE: Following a judge's decision yesterday,
Adolph Coors said it plans to immediately begin airing a
Coors Light commercial parodying the Energizer bunny ads.
Judge Charles R. Nogle Sr. in federal court in Chicago denied
Eveready Battery Co.'s motion that sought to block Coors from
airing the spot. The commercial shows actor Leslie Nielsen
decked in bunny ears and banging a big drum. Coors's
"imitation of the Energizer bunny is far from excessive," the
judge wrote. "Mr. Nielsen is not a toy {mechanical or
otherwise}, does not run on batteries, is not 15 inches tall,
is not predominantly pink, {and} does not wear sunglasses or
beach thongs." Eveready, a unit of Ralston Purina, said it
will continue its suit in federal court if Coors airs the
spot.
                                                                                                       

   AGENCY SWITCH: Newmark &amp; Lewis, Hicksville, N.Y., named
Partners &amp; Shevack, New York, to handle its estimated $18
million account. New York-based Ayer was assigned the account
just three weeks ago, but the consumer-electronics chain
changed its mind and decided the campaign Partners &amp; Shevack
pitched would better serve the company, said Dick Lewis,
co-chairman.
                                                                                                       

   FINALISTS: Subaru of America named six finalists for its
$60 million ad account: Warwick Baker & Fiore; W.B. Doner &amp;
Co.; Jordan, McGrath, Case & Taylor; DCA; Wieden & Kennedy;
and the incumbent, Levine, Huntley, Vick &amp; Beaver. Subaru is
a unit of Fuji Heavy Industries.
                                                                                                       

   SINGAPORE: D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles extended its
equity partnership with Tokyu Agency International, the
agency's partner agency in Japan, to include DMB&amp;B Singapore.
The Singapore agency will now be known as DMB&amp;B Tokyu. Terms
weren't disclosed.
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S NEWS: James D. Patterson was named managing director
of Leo Burnett's office in Singapore.
