<HEAD>Burger King's New Ad Agency Debuts 99-Cent Promotion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>

   Burger King Co. on Wednesday announced a month-long
national promotion developed by its new advertising agency that
features a different sandwich each weekday for 99 cents.
   The daily special, which will run through Sept. 29, was developed
by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi and the UniWorld Agency, which does Burger
King's minority advertising.
   It's the first work done by New York-based Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for
Burger King since the fast-food giant fired N.W. Ayer Inc., which
came up with the ``We do it like you'd do it'' theme in June.
   ``We are very excited about this promotion,'' said Gary
Langstaff, Burger King's executive vice president of marketing. It
``represents some of the best promotional advertising in the
business.''
   Burger King spokeswoman Cori Zywotow said the new commercials
highlight the diversity of the chain's menu.
   ``They're just really upbeat, fast-paced spots,'' she said.
   Recent Burger King ad campaigns that met with less-than-favorable
reviews included a search for Herb, a nerd who had never been to a
Burger King, and the themes ``This is a Burger King Town'' and ``The
Best Food for Fast Times.'' Those were produced by the J. Walter
Thompson agency of New York before the agency was replaced by Ayer
in September 1987.
   Burger King announced in May it was awarding its $215 million
account to Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, a British-owned agency that will focus
on promotions and products, and D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles of New
York, which will concentrate on image.
   Miami-based Burger King changed hands in January as part of
British conglomerate Grand Metropolitan PLC's acquisition of
Pillsbury Co., Burger King's parent.
   Burger King and its franchisees, which operate more than 5,800
restaurants worldwide, had systemwide sales of more than $5.4
billion in fiscal 1988.
