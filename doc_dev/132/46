Australia's tourist industry, starved of domestic airline services for the past 
week, is facing ruin because of widespread cancellations by nervous overseas 
visitors, operators said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Resorts and hotels reported a slump in occupancy rates since the weekend, when 
travelers realized that the dispute, which has grounded all domestic airlines 
since last Thursday, was set to continue for some time. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's bleeding here at the moment," said Gaynor Cooper, marketing 
manager of the Yulara Resort in the shadow of Ayers Rock in the central 
Australian desert. 
</P>
<P>
"We would expect to be 100% full at this time of year, but our occupancy rate 
is very low. People are canceling because they are afraid they won't be able to 
get back home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tourism is Australia's most important foreign exchange earner and reaped $4.9 
billion from about 2.2 million visitors in the last financial year. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had quite massive cancellations from abroad. There's been a huge loss of 
confidence," said Owen French, manager of a string of island resorts off 
Queensland. "Overseas travel agents are just taking Australia out of the 
schedules."

About 1,600 pilots resigned en masse last week after the three largest domestic 
airlines refused to consider their demand for a 30% pay raise, bringing chaos 
to the transport system of the continent. 
</P>
<P>
The airlines said they had received more than 800 responses from pilots to job 
advertisements they placed in newspapers around the world. But they warned it 
would take about four weeks for the applications to be processed and new pilots 
to be trained. 
</P>
<P>
Although a few charter flights still serve tourist hot spots such as Ayers 
Rock, most foreign travelers come to Australia on multi-stop tickets, which are 
no longer feasible. 
</P>
<P>
"It's suddenly got worse since yesterday, and we're now around 20% to 30% down 
on normal," said Yvonne Singleton, public relations manager at Sydney's Menzies 
Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting a lot of cancellations of groups, mainly Japanese, for 
September." she added.
