   Lindy Chamberlain, the mother in
Australia's dingo-baby case, says she is owed millions of dollars in
compensation promised nearly a year after she was found innocent of
charges she killed her infant daughter.
   Mrs. Chamberlain, who claims her 6-week-old daughter was snatched
by a dingo, a native Australian wild dog, while on a camping trip in
the Outback, says the notoriety has left her broke and prevented her
family from living a normal life.
   Mrs. Chamberlain, 41, who in the past has resented her trial by
media, called a news conference with selected journalists Monday to
generate publicity to force the Northern Territory government, which
prosecuted her and later pardoned her, to pay compensation for the
3{ years she spent in jail.
   Her ordeal, regarded as one of the miscarriages of justice in
Australian legal history, and her fight for compensation have been
front-page stories for years in Australian newspapers.
   But despite eight best-sellers about the case, Mrs. Chamberlain
claimed she had not received much money. She also said money she
received from the 1988 movie ``A Cry In The Dark,'' in which Meryl
Streep played her role, covered little more than her expenses.
   Husband Michael, 45, a former pastor with the Seventh Day
Adventist Church, said he eked out a living chopping firewood and
selling it for $26 a trailer load. Mrs. Chamberlain said she could
not afford to buy new shoes for her three school-age children.
   ``People think a couple so famous should be rich,'' she said.
``Our anonymity has been blasted; we can't live a normal life. You
can't plan for the future because you don't know what that future
is.''
   The family's saga has captivated the Australian public since
1980, when Mrs. Chamberlain claimed a dingo killed her daughter
Azaria in the Outback.
   Mrs. Chamberlain was prosecuted for murder by the Northern
Territory government but was released following the discovery of
vital new evidence while a Royal Commission, the highest form of
investigation available, reviewed the case.
   Mrs. Chamberlain was finally pardoned last November. The
Chamberlains have refused to reveal the amount of compensation they
were promised, but a figure leaked to the media by the Northern
Territory government put it at around $3 million.
   Officials for the Northern Territory government could not be
reached for comment today or Monday.
   ``Maybe an apology is a little hard to swallow and let's face it,
compensation is an apology,'' Mrs. Chamberlain said.
   The couple said they owe about $1 million in legal costs, mostly
to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, which supported them through
their court battles.
