ONE OF THE FAMILY
by Wendy W Fairey
W W Norton Pounds 15.95, 288 pages
WENDY FAIREY'S mother was Sheilah Graham. Fairey was certain of that. Most
people who know anything about F. Scott Fitzgerald know something about
Sheilah Graham and her 'College of One'. She was the East End girl who moved
from a Jewish orphanage to become a Hollywood gossip columnist and then
Fitzgerald's love at the grim end of his days.
Between drinking and writing not-so-good stories to pay for his mad wife
Zelda's hospital, he discovered the fun of playing Henry Higgins to a
glamorous but ill-educated young woman. The result, according to Sheilah who
wrote a bestselling book about it, was that she inspired Fitzgerald to
produce at least a part of that brilliant novel, The Last Tycoon.
All this may seem a long build-up to Wendy Fairey's search for her identity,
but the ghost of Fitzgerald hung over her childhood as the father she had
never quite had. As it turned out, the father she thought she had was not
her actual natural father, and when she discovered his existence after her
mother died she was very pleased to acknowledge him - but he too had died,
and had done her no favours in life.
To come out with a few names, Fairey's undistinguished first
father-in-name-only was an Englishman called Trevor Westbrook who, as it
turned out, Graham had married as a cover for the birth of her daughter -
whose actual father was the philosopher Freddie Ayer. He and her mother's
other lovers at that period were, so Fairey works out for herself, Scott
substitutes. Thus the great man inspired her birth.
The thriller element is somewhat reduced by giving us Ayer at the beginning
of the book. In fact more than half of it is about her mother, set in the
lavish world of Hollywood in the 1950s as seen through the eyes of a clever,
swottish girl. With ironic hindsight, Fairey describes a child out of place
in her environment, who goes East as soon as possible and ends up, just like
the father she did not know at the time, a professor.
The quest to put together the pieces of the family jigsaw is told with great
intensity, an endearing honesty, but not much humour. Ayer, it turns out,
had always known about her. Perhaps unsurprisingly, when she eventually
meets him as her father, not just as a family friend, the professor,
although good-natured about it, cannot quite rise to her expectations.
Three months after this meeting, Ayer died and Fairey received the first
public acknowledgement of her new parentage in The Times' list of those
attending his funeral: 'Prof. Wendy Ayer'. That is a moment of blackish
humour.
