Clubowner Ronnie Scott must be confident of this showy vibraphonist's
appeal. The American has already spent a week at Scott's new club in
Birmingham and follows now with a three-week residency at the London base.
But there are few good vibes players around and the instrument does seem to
have some pulling power on the margins of jazz: perhaps because it offers
both melody and percussion in large, equal measures or because it is played
standing up and with some vigour.
Whatever the reason, it is hard to ignore.
Roy Ayers has the added advantage of being an unrepentant showman who owns
an expensive looking piece of equipment from which he can summon all kinds
of sounds with a flick of the switch and the application of mallets. This he
does with alacrity and even managed a clever but tacky mini-tribute to Miles
Davis by hitting the trumpet button on the machine. He can play though and
when the vibes are right, backed by a tough all-American no-nonsense rhythm
section, the swirling vibrato is mesmerising.
Legend has it that Ayers was encouraged to take up the electric xylophone at
the age of five by Lionel Hampton, the original big band vibes man, when he
gave him a pair of mallets to get the young Ayers started. He moved quickly
away from a pure jazz sound, however, and by the mid-1970s was established
as an uncomplicated and entertaining fusion player.
Thus he neglects to play long, sustained solo parts throughout a set of
sweaty jazz funk. Instead the repertoire of songs with titles like 'Everyone
likes the sunshine' relies heavily on a seductive groove and the old
charmer's line of cheeky chat. He even resorts to the trusted technique of
invoking 'everyone to put their hands in the air', for example. He likes to
sing as well and has a soulful voice which delivers smoothie nonsense
reminiscent of ladies' men like Barry White or Luther Vandross.
While guitarist Zachery Breaux whacks out the soul riffs, Ayers puts down
his mallets, fixes a table at the front with a mischievous eye and sings, 'I
believe in the spirit of do-do'.
Later in the set he wiggles his ears, a seductive device which Ayers' wife
apparently finds irresistible.
On this first night more than a few in the near capacity audience seemed to
like it too.
