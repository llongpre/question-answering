NEWSWIRE: ASSISTANT AYERS PROMOTED TO HEAD POST AT OHIO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ohio State University ended a three-week search Monday by making assistant 
Randy Ayers head basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers replaces Gary Williams, who left last month to become coach at Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson had been the front-runner for the job after Jim 
Crews of Evansville and Lon Kruger of Kansas State withdrew from contention 
Friday. But Richardson withdrew Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers, 33, who had been an assistant to Williams since May 1987, has no head 
coaching experience but said he will base his coaching philosophy on bits and 
pieces taken from other coaches. He signed a five-year contract with a base 
salary of $75,000 for the first year.
