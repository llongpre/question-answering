Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh on Sunday denied that he had tried to hide the fact 
that his chief personal aide had flunked a lie detector test during a sensitive 
department investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely not," Thornburgh said when asked about the allegation of Deputy 
Atty. Gen. Donald B. Ayer, the department's No. 2 official, who has turned in 
his resignation, effective on Friday. The charge was reported by The Times on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ayer is sadly misinformed about the facts," Thornburgh said. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no evidence that tied any person on my staff to the unauthorized 
disclosure." Thornburgh was referring to a leak of information during an 
investigation of alleged financial irregularities in the office of House 
Majority Whip William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Thornburgh was asked about 
his former executive assistant, Robert S. (Robin) Ross Jr., who failed a lie 
detector test in the leak inquiry. Asked whether the failure was not 
"evidence," Thornburgh responded: "No, it isn't evidence of wrongdoing -- not 
in our courts of law." 
</P>
<P>
Later, in a statement issued Sunday, Thornburgh said he found it "unfortunate 
that Mr. Ayer has chosen to conduct himself in this manner with respect to his 
former colleagues." 
</P>
<P>
After he resigned, Ayer contended that he had been blocked from performing the 
deputy's duties by Ross. According to Ayer, Ross acted as the department's 
chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
The statement released by the department did not deal directly with Ayer's 
allegation that Thornburgh had tried to keep the leak investigation away from 
the department's internal watchdog unit and, failing that, refused to follow 
the unit's recommendation for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the statement noted that Solicitor General Kenneth W. Starr's review 
of the investigation concluded that there had been no reason for Thornburgh to 
remove himself from the case -- as Ayer had unsuccessfully sought to persuade 
him to do. 
</P>
<P>
The statement also noted that Thornburgh was acting within his discretion in 
deciding not to discipline anyone over the leak. The statement said that Starr 
also had considered the concerns of the department's watchdog unit, which had 
called for further investigation and possible discipline.
