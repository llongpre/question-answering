A Newport Beach woman has died from injuries related to an attempted suicide in 
her jail cell, authorities said. Pamela Pauline Ayers, 45, had been held since 
Aug. 12 in the Santa Ana women's jail in the fatal shooting of prominent Los 
Angeles attorney Gerald Goldfarb, 49.

Deputies discovered the woman hanging from a bedsheet tied to a shower rod. 
Goldfarb died of multiple wounds to the head and body, and Ayers underwent 
surgery for a self-inflicted wound to the abdomen shortly after the shooting 
incident outside her Newport Beach condominium. Police alleged that Ayers, a 
former interior decorator, fired 10 shots from a 12-gauge shotgun that she had 
bought just hours before the slaying. Ayers' attorney said his client mistook 
Goldfarb's friendship and legal counsel for a love relationship.
