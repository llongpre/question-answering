   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh reassigned
two top aides Monday in what appeared to be an attempt to dispel
the perception he is surrounded by a tight circle of loyal aides.
   Robert S. Ross Jr., Thornburgh's chief of staff, will spend the
next two to three months organizing a new office of international
affairs, then return to private legal practice, said senior
department officials.
   David Runkel, Thornburgh's press secretary who has endured
stormy relations with reporters, has been reassigned to be director
of communications, said the officials, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   The changes took effect Monday. Thornburgh was in the process of
selecting a new director of the Office of Public Affairs, who will
serve as the department's chief spokesman, the officials said.
   The changes were disclosed by officials close to Thornburgh just
three days after Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer announced
after just six months in office that he would resign on May 25.
   The same day that Ayer disclosed his plans to leave, the White
House announced its intention to nominate Assistant Attorney
General William Barr to be the new deputy attorney general.
   Ayer decided to leave because he felt he lacked the traditional
authority usually given a deputy attorney general to oversee the
day-to-day operations of the department, according to
administration sources.
   One source said Ayer was kept out of the decision-making process
by Thornburgh's top aides.
   Ross, who functioned as Thornburgh's chief of staff, retained
many of the responsibilities normally given to the deputy attorney
general, one official said.
   Officials said that Barr would be given the authority that Ayer
sought but was never given as part of Thornburgh's effort to turn
management of the department over to the deputy and the assistant
attorneys general.
   Thornburgh has run an extremely tight ship, holding
decision-making power among a small circle of aides who worked for
him when he was governor of Pennsylvania.
   Both Ross and Runkel, members of a trio that includes longtime
aide Murray Dickman, served as top aides to Thornburgh in
Harrisburg.
   Dickman is expected to remain on the attorney general's staff,
which is expected to play a more ``low-key role'' in department
operations, officials said.
   ``It was never his (Thornburgh's) intention to have a small
personal staff attempting to run the department,'' said one
official.
   ``When the dust settles, you are going to see a Washington team
in place,'' said another official.
   Ayer was given the unpleasant and difficult assignments of
defending the Bush administration's opposition to undoing a series
of Supreme Court decisions on civil rights that Democrats in
Congress are anxious to blunt.
   Ayer's resignation was announced two weeks after the disclosure
that he had been ordered to withdraw a letter expressing Justice
Department support for sentencing guidelines for corporations
convicted of crimes.
   Runkel said the letter was unauthorized because Thornburgh had
not seen it before Ayer sent it to the U.S. Sentencing Commission,
which is considering whether to implement the guidelines.
   Runkel has been accused by reporters of giving them misleading
or incomplete information.
   An FBI investigation ordered by Thornburgh of unauthorized leaks
of information about a criminal probe involving the office of Rep.
William H. Gray III, D-Pa., named Runkel as a ``secondary source''
of the story. Thornburgh defended Runkel's conduct, but the
disclosure of his close aide's role proved politically embarrassing.
