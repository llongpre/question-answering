   Stanley Works' third-quarter profit from continuing operations will be "somewhat lower" than that of a year earlier, Richard H. Ayers, president and chief executive officer, told analysts here, blaming "inflationary cost pressures." 

   In the 1987 third quarter, the New Britain, Conn., maker of tools and specialty hardware had profit from continuing operations of $27.8 million, or 63 cents a share. 
Losses from discontinued operations made net income $21 million, or 48 cents a share. 

   Mr. Ayers also said profit from continuing operations for all of 1988 will exceed the year-earlier $96.3 million, or $2.22 a share. 
This indicates that 1988 second-half profit will exceed $48.9 million, or $1.12 a share, based on first-half earnings of $47.4 million, or $1.10 a share. 
Net for 1987 was $86.6 million, or $2 a share. 

   Mr. Ayers also said 1988 sales would surpass the 1987 total of $1.76 billion, which suggests that 1988 second-half sales will exceed $807.2 million. 
First-half sales this year totaled $952.8 million. 

   "Sales, although higher than last year, will be lower than previously anticipated, because some of our major accounts have taken a more cautious stance in ordering products in advance of the holiday season, construction activity has been soft, and the summer drought has impacted sales in certain regions," Mr. Ayers said. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Stanley Works shares closed at $25.75, down 25 cents.
