   Richard H. Ayers, president of Stanley Works, was named to the additional post of chief executive officer of the tool and hardware concern. 

   Mr. Ayers, 44 years old, who was formerly chief operating officer, succeeds Donald W. Davis, 65, who remains chairman. 

   Separately, at its annual meeting yesterday, Stanley Works, which hasn't yet formally reported first-quarter financial results, said it had net income in the period of $17.8 million, or 41 cents a share, up 12% from $15.9 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. 

   Profit from continuing operations was $19.2 million, or 44 cents a share, up 30% from $14.8 million, or 38 cents a share, a year earlier. 
Sales from continuing operations were $416.8 million, up 50% from $278.3 million in 1986, largely because of acquisitions made over the past year, the company said. 

   Mr. Ayers said he plans "no significant changes" in the company, which in recent years has focused on tools and services for consumers as well as products for professional builders and industrial users. 
Stanley Works had made 10 acquisitions and four divestitures within the past 14 months and was now in "a period of catching our breath," Mr. Ayers said. 

   Also newly appointed was R. Alan Hunter, who was named to succeed J. Spencer Gould as vice president, finance, and chief financial officer. 
Mr. Gould is retiring later this year. 
Mr. Hunter had been assistant vice president, finance. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Stanley Works shares closed at $32.25, up 50 cents.
