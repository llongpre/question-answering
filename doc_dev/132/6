<HEAD>Couple in Australia's Dingo Baby Case to Divorce</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael and Lindy Chamberlain, the
couple who claimed their infant daughter was spirited off by a
dingo in the Australian outback, are planning to divorce, a
newspaper said Saturday.
   The marriage fell victim to the strains of fighting for more
than nine years to clear their names, the Sydney Morning Herald
said.
   The couple claimed in August 1980 that their daughter Azaria was
carried away by a dingo, an Australian wild dog, from the tent
where they were camping in central Australia near Ayer's Rock.
   The child's body was never recovered. In 1981, Lindy Chamberlain
was charged and later convicted of her daughter's murder. She spent
3{ years in prison but was released after new evidence was
discovered - a piece of clothing that indicated a dingo might
indeed have taken the child.
   The infant's disappearance, one of the most hotly disputed
criminal cases in Australia's history, was the subject of a
Hollywood movie ``A Cry in the Dark,'' starring Meryl Streep as
Lindy Chamberlain.
   The newspaper said the couple is still living together at their
home north of Sydney and that it has not been decided who will have
custody of their three remaining children.
   Lindy Chamberlain is in New Zealand on a nine-day trip to
promote her book, ``Through My Eyes.''
