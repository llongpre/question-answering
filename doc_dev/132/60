   When an ad agency goes sour, when its clients head for the door, how far can it slide before it hits the point of no return? 

   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. is about to find out, as it pushes the envelope in trying to turn around the beleaguered New York office of its Campbell-Mithun-Esty agency. 
The office earlier this week racked up the latest in a long string of account losses when Tambrands Inc. pulled its $12 million feminine hygiene products account, awarding it to Ally &amp; Gargano. 
Earlier this year, it lost the $25 million American Home Products Corp. account, including the Anacin business. 
Last month, its chairman, Joseph W. O'Donnell, resigned under pressure. 

   The latest setbacks are hardly isolated instances. 
The New York office's losing streak has now run for more than three years, raising the question of whether a slump that severe and that sustained can be overcome in the image-obsessed advertising business. 

   Several ad executives questioned yesterday had their doubts. 
Lee Anne Morgan of Morgan Anderson &amp; Co., a consulting firm that helps clients choose ad agencies, notes that successful agency turnarounds are rare. 
"It's a Catch-22 situation," she says, because clients don't want to go to an agency that isn't winning new business. 
She adds that if Campbell-Mithun-Esty's name were to appear on a list of finalists for an account, "a consultant would have to counsel their clients that the agency has lost a ton of business, and who knows how long they're going to be able to keep {the staff} they have on board?" 

   What's worse, even if an agency does manage to turn itself around, perceptions don't always keep track with reality -- and perceptions are everything in advertising. 
"It's easier to do a start-up" then to turn around a fading agency, Ms. Morgan asserts, "because at least then they feel the whole world is open to them, instead of people having negative perceptions." 

   Yet Saatchi and Campbell-Mithun-Esty management are pulling out the stops to try to turn around the New York office. 
William D. Dunlap, Campbell-Mithun-Esty's chief executive officer, predicts that "within six months, it will be stabilized and moving ahead." 
He says the New York office is currently in three new business pitches, and should hear the results within 60 days. 

   Mr. Dunlap, who is based at the agency's Minneapolis headquarters, now spends three days each week in the New York office. 
A few months ago, Richard Johnson, one of the agency's top creative executives, was dispatched from Detroit to take on the creative mantle in New York. 
The agency is also planning to tap the talents of its other offices to shore up New York's fortunes. 
All three non-New York offices are relatively strong. 

   Mr. Dunlap notes that David Tree, the top creative executive in Minneapolis, has participated in several New York pitches. 
He says all the offices will try to ferret out new-business leads for New York. 
And he hopes to bring some of the agency's more successful ventures to New York, such as a unit that produces TV programming. 
"We have a lot of excellent, dedicated people. 
We just need a few breaks," he says. 

   Meanwhile, the agency is busy fending off the rumours that swirl about it like vultures. 
Speculation that Texaco Inc. was putting its account up for review prompted the oil company to release a statement categorically denying it. 
Saatchi management, meanwhile, in early spring had to assure Campbell-Mithun management, in writing, that it had no intention of selling the agency, as had been rumored. 
"We have every intention, as does Bill {Dunlap}, of supporting CME-New York through this period, and of re-establishing it as a strong, positive, New York agency," says Terry Bannister, co-chief of Saatchi's advertising operations. 

   And the agency is struggling against more than three years of severe troubles at the New York office, which until last year was a separate agency, William Esty Co. 
The problems date back to 1986, when Esty lost both its R.J. Reynolds tobacco and Nabisco cookies and crackers business after the merger that created RJR Nabisco. 
Then, in early 1987, just after Esty hired Mr. O'Donnell, the agency lost its largest client, the $150 million Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. account. 
It also resigned the $40 million MasterCard International account, which was under review. 

   Mr. O'Donnell tried mightily to improve Esty's workmanlike creative product -- but succeeded instead in alienating clients who were at the agency precisely because they wanted conventional, unexciting ads. 
Industry executives say American Home Products left the agency after Mr. O'Donnell tried to persuade it to run more cutting-edge creative work. 
Mr. O'Donnell, who is traveling and couldn't be reached, also didn't throw himself as heavily into wooing new business as Saatchi had hoped; industry executives say he didn't feel the creative work was yet up to snuff. 

   The string of account losses, and Mr. O'Donnell's inability to stem the flow, prompted Saatchi to merge Esty with Minneapolis-based Campbell-Mithun in July, 1988, in what effectively was a takeover relegating Mr. O'Donnell to the sidelines. 
Today, the New York office has $210 million in billings -- less than half of the $510 million it billed as an independent agency in 1985. 

   Mr. Dunlap attributes part of the problems since then to the usual post-merger adjustment period. 
"I want to make this seem like one company," he adds. 
"I think it took a little longer than I anticipated. 
But we're at a point now where it's really coming together."

   Ayer Takes Double Hit 

   Illinois Bell, a client of N W Ayer Chicago since 1937, yesterday pulled its $19 million ad account and assigned it to Tatham-Laird &amp; Kudner, Chicago. 

   News of Illinois Bell's defection comes just days after Ayer lost another longtime account, the $10 million Deere &amp; Co. business. 
Illinois Bell and Deere were the agency's two largest clients. 
The agency is now just a $15 million shop with only a handful of small clients, including Leaf Inc. and a Honeywell division. 
Another client, Citicorp Savings Illinois, is about to take its business to another agency as well, industry executives say. 

   Ayer Chicago has also had its share of management turmoil. 
Last month, John Wells, who headed the office, was fired after executives there decided his performance wasn't acceptable, people close to the agency say. 
Dom Rossi, Ayer's director of U.S. operations, has been leading the office but is looking for a Midwestern ad executive to take over permanently. 

   "We're committed to Chicago," Mr. Rossi said in an interview yesterday. 
He added that Ayer is looking to make an acquisition in the Chicago area in order to bolster its presence there.
