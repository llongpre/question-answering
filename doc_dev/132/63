   After months of account losses and internal turmoil,
Backer Spielvogel Bates held onto the $35 million Avis rental
car account, winning a shootout with five other agencies.
   The account is sizable in itself -- but its significance
to Backer is far greater than the dollar terms would suggest.
Backer's U.S. operations have been battered badly over the
past year by a string of losses including the $110 million
Miller Lite business. Carl Spielvogel, the agency's chairman,
has in the past few months ousted old managers and brought in
a new team to run U.S. operations in a desperate attempt to
turn around the tottering agency.
                                                                                                       

   "It's a critical turning point," Mr. Spielvogel said
yesterday. "It's a great boost for the new management team.
It could be the beginning of what we like to call the Big
Momomentum."
   The win is the first concerted effort by the new
management team under Ken Rogers, who was promoted to
president last month, and Don Easdon, who was brought in to
be the top creative executive in April. Considering that
incumbent agencies rarely win once an account is put up for
review, Avis's slogan -- "Trying harder than ever" --
probably fits the agency these days even more than its
client.
   The agency "had a lot of problems, and certainly they
couldn't insulate Avis . . . {but} I think they've
straightened those things out," said Robert Cardillo, Avis's
vice president of marketing. "They convinced us that the
level of service would continue and improve. That was an
important factor to us," he added.
   Yet Backer's troubles aren't over yet. The agency is still
recovering from the spate of account losses. In just the last
year, a list of blue-chip clients has made a beeline for the
door, including Xerox, Dole, Fisher-Price and Prudential, in
addition to Miller Lite.
   Avis's decision to keep Backer, which has serviced the
account for six years, had some industry executives wondering
whether the review was simply a tactic to keep the agency on
its toes. Indeed, despite the two-month-long account review,
which included speculative creative work from all six
agencies, Avis's advertising strategy will remain the same.
Ads will continue to focus, as they have for three years, on
the fact that the company is employee-owned. "The next
advertising won't be dramatically different than what we've
got," Mr. Cardillo said.
   "Maybe they were looking for a way to wake Backer up,"
said Bill Tragos, chief executive officer of TBWA
Advertising, one of the other five ad agencies in the review.
"Sometimes clients do those horrible things, and make the
rest of us jump through hoops." DDB Needham; McCannErickson;
Foote, Cone &amp; Belding's New York office, and D'Arcy Masius
Benton &amp; Bowles were the other contenders.
   At Backer, though, where staffers toasted the win
yesterday afternoon with Miller Genuine Draft (another
client, of course), Mr. Rogers said the win wasn't a sure
thing. In a memo to the staff, he said Avis screened over 100
agencies and interviewed 12 before narrowing its list.
"Retaining a major account is usually more difficult than
winning a new one," he told staffers, "so Avis's decision
offers clear evidence that BSB can compete with and beat any
agency in the business."
   To get the agency's competitive juices flowing, Mr. Rogers
had set up a "challenge team" within the agency to compete
against the existing team on the Avis account. The work
Backer ultimately presented to Avis last week included the
existing team's strategy and some creative work contributed
by the challengers.
   Whether the Avis win signals the beginning of a
turnaround, or just a bright blip in an otherwise downward
trend, isn't yet clear. But Backer is already working on
several other new-business pitches to try to sway the odds in
its favor. It makes a pitch for the Joint Military Services
account early next month, and is one of several agencies
competing for Rhone-Poulenc-Rorer's Maalox business.
   Says Avis's Mr. Cardillo, "I think the agency has bottomed
out. I think they're on the way back up."

   Ayer, Ammirati Win Sterling
                                                                                                       

   Sterling Drug's Glenbrook Laboratories unit, which had
been reviewing its Bayer business and some other small
assignments, went a giant step further: it tapped Ayer and
Ammirati &amp; Puris to handle all of its over-the-counter drug
brands, with billings that may total more than $50 million.
   Ayer walked away with the biggest prize, Glenbrook's Bayer
aspirin account, which billed about $17 million last year and
is expected to spend closer to $30 million this year. In
addition, Ayer was named to handle all of its other analgesic
brands, including Midol, Panadol, and Vanquish, which
together bill about $5 million.
   The win is an important one for Ayer, which lost the J.C.
Penney account, with 1990 billings of $53 million, earlier
this month. That loss is expected to lead to the closing of
Ayer's Dallas office. Another client, The National, recently
closed. Ayer has lost a number of other major accounts in the
past few years, and its new-business record has been weak.
   Ayer's win was offset somewhat by the loss of Glenbrook's
Phillips' laxative and pHisoDerm brands, which this year will
bill less than $10 million. Those brands, along with
Glenbrook's gastrointestinal brands, were awarded to
Ammirati. The brands had billings of $22 million last year,
according to Leading National Advertisers.
   Ad executives involved in the review said they were
surprised yesterday to learn that the review involved all of
Glenbrook's brands, not just Bayer. Lintas, which previously
handled Bayer, elected not to participate in the review when
it was announced earlier this year. Warwick Baker &amp; Fiore and
Slater Hanft Martin had handled several of the brands
previously.

   WPP Group Woes
                                                                                                       

   WPP Group missed its budget for the first quarter and
"there have been no faint or even vague stirrings of
recovery," Martin Sorrell, chief executive officer, said at
the annual meeting in London.
   Mr. Sorrell said operating margins continued to erode
during the first two months of the second quarter, "albeit
less severely" than the first-quarter decline. World-wide
revenue slid 5% in the first quarter, he said.
   Mr. Sorrell, who in April renegotiated WPP's huge debt
load with bankers, is facing more problems than just
recession fallout. WPP's Ogilvy &amp; Mather agency is facing
major business problems including staff defections and
trouble on its huge American Express account. And Mr. Sorrell
said he is continuing discussions over selling WPP's Scali,
McCabe, Sloves unit.
   But Mr. Sorrell said that despite the poor outlook, WPP
will be able to meet income targets stipulated by his banks.
WPP's stock has been battered by speculation that the company
wouldn't meet its debt covenants, but "the Group continues to
perform within the constraints," he said.
