   Schieffelin &amp; Somerset Co., following a three-month review of its $8 million Hennessy Cognac account, decided to keep Lord, Geller, Federico, Einstein as its advertising agency. 

   The decision by the wine and spirits importer is a boost to Lord Geller, which has been fighting to hold on to its clients since several top executives walked out earlier this year to form a new agency. 
However, last week International Business Machines Corp., Lord Geller's largest client by far, said it put its account up for review. 

   William Wardell, president of Lord Geller, a unit of London-based WPP Group PLC, said Schieffelin &amp; Somerset's decision is "a terrific vote of confidence." 

   Other agencies that pitched for the account were N.W. Ayer Inc., Smith/Greenland Inc., David Deutsch Associates Inc. and Hal Riney &amp; Partners. 
Smith/Greenland already creates about $25 million in advertising for other Schieffelin imports, including Johnny Walker; N.W. Ayer handles about $4 million for other Schieffelin accounts. 

   Clint Rodenberg, executive vice president of marketing for Schieffelin &amp; Somerset, said Lord Geller was chosen for its "spectacular creative" campaign. 
Mr. Rodenberg characterized Lord Geller as "in effect a new agency" thanks to new creative people brought in since the defections in March. 

   Besides IBM, Fuji Photo Film USA and Anne Klein II, a womenswear retailer, have also put their accounts at Lord Geller up for review. 
WNBC-TV, an NBC-affiliated station in New York, and the New Yorker magazine have moved their accounts to Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners, the agency formed by the defecting executives, but a New York state judge has since enjoined Lord Einstein from accepting further Lord Geller clients.
