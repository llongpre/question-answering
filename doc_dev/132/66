   A former Justice Department official is being
considered to be deputy attorney general, a position vacant because
of controversy surrounding the original candidate, an
administration source said Thursday.
   Donald B. Ayer, a former deputy solicitor general who served
five years as U.S. attorney in Sacramento, Calif., is a candidate
for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The job has been vacant since Harold G. Christiansen resigned
last spring.
   Robert B. Fiske Jr., a New York attorney who was the original
choice of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, withdrew from
consideration after Senate conservatives threatened a lengthy
confirmation battle if he were nominated.
   A number of conservative Republicans accused Fiske of scuttling
President Reagan's judicial nominees when he chaired the American
Bar Association's Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary. Fiske's
critics urged President Bush against making the nomination.
   Fiske, a partner in a Wall Street firm who was once U.S.
attorney in Manhattan, bowed out from consideration last month.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel refused to comment on
whether Ayer was the candidate under consideration whom he had
discussed earlier in the week. Runkel had said the FBI had not yet
completed a background check on a candidate, whom he did not
identify.
   Ayer, who was out of town and unavailable for comment, is a
partner in the Washington office of the Cleveland law firm of
Jones, Day, Reavis and Pogue.
   He joined the firm in late 1988 after serving for two years as
deputy solicitor general at the Justice Department under Solicitor
General Charles Fried.
   He was U.S. attorney in Sacramento, Calif., from 1981 to 1986,
an element of his resume that Thornburgh considers critical
experience for the job, the source said.
   A native of San Mateo, Calif., Ayer, 40, is a 1971 graduate of
Stanford University and received his law degree from Harvard in
1975.
   He clerked for then-Circuit Judge Malcolm Wilkey on the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals here before becoming a law clerk to
Supreme Court Justice William H. Rehnquist during the high court's
1976-77 term.
