<HEAD>Tax Time Pays Off For H&amp;R Block</HEAD>

   Helping people figure out how much to
pay Uncle Sam paid off for H&amp;R Block Inc. this year.
   The company prepared 13,090,000 tax returns worldwide, according
to preliminary figures released Wednesday by the Kansas City-based
firm.
   That was an increase of 526,000, or 4.2 percent, from 1988. The
returns accounted for $630.9 million in taxes.
   The figures bucked a trend in the tax-preparation business, the
company said. Usually, fewer people use tax preparers in the second
year after tax-overhaul legislation is enacted, said Donald Ayers,
Block's vice president for finance.
   After the Tax Reform Act of 1986 went into effect, Block had a
record increase in the number of tax returns it prepared, Ayers
said. But the company had expected trouble this year.
   ``In the first year after tax reform we always have a boost in
business because people are confused,'' Ayers said. ``But in the
second year, the numbers decrease because many people go back to
self-preparation.''
   Block and its franchises operate more than 8,700 tax-preparation
offices worldwide.
