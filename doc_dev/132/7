   N.W. Ayer Inc. said its European network of ad agencies won an assignment for Gillette Co. in Europe. 
The annual budget for the assignment is estimated at $25 million. 

   The assignment was held by the London office of Chicago-based Foote, Cone &amp; Belding Communications Inc. 

   Ayer has worked for Gillette in Europe since 1986 and in the U.S. since 1979. 
The new assignment includes advertising for Gillette personal division brands, including Aapri facial scrub, Silkience shampoo and conditioner and a variety of new products. 
Ayer already creates the domestic ads for many of those same products. 

   Foote Cone competed with Ayer for the account. 
That account was put under review last year, when Boston-based Gillette reorganized its businesses. 
Since last month, Gillette has been operating its European operations under the same umbrella as its U.S. and Canadian businesses. 

   A Gillette spokesman said that giving the account to Ayer made sense. 
"Foote Cone has no (Gillette) business here" in the U.S. he said. 
"Ayer has the bulk of that business here, so for consistency, it made sense to give them" the European account. 

   For Ayer, the Gillette assignment is the largest the agency has in Europe. 
An Ayer spokeswoman said it is also the agency's "biggest international account gain since" winning the advertising account for Pan Am Corp. in 1978. 
Ayer no longer works for the airline holding company, having lost the account in 1981 to New York-based Wells, Rich, Greene Inc.
