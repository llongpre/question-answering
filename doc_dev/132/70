What a pleasure it was Saturday afternoon and evening at the second annual Long 
Beach Jazz Festival. With a cool breeze blowing across the harbor, the sound 
properly balanced for jazz, and brisk, no-delay stage work, the setting left 
little to be desired. 
</P>
<P>
The music, however, was not quite so flawless. After typically energetic 
opening sets by Kevin Eubanks, Ernie Andrews &amp; the Capp-Pierce Juggernaut 
and Fattburger, vibist Roy Ayers finally brought the crowd to its feet with a 
non-stop tour through his uniquely entertaining approach to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers is one of perhaps four or five vibes players in the world who can almost 
instantly be recognized on the basis of style alone. The brisk, dancing lines 
of his improvisations were brilliant examples of contemporary improvisation. 
But Ayers clearly enjoyed contrasting his pure jazz with several long funk 
tunes -- "Poo-Poo La-La Means I Love You" was one -- that he sang and performed 
with theatrical fervor (he climbed on top of his vibes to make one story 
point). The high-energy flashpoint came during a mock argument between Ayers 
and percussionist/vibist Dwight Gassoway that turned into a whirlwind duel 
across the bars of the vibes. 
</P>
<P>
Ayers' long set traced in part to the typically late arrival of Freddie 
Hubbard. The trumpeter's fabled undependability didn't sit well with at least 
one member of the audience. When Hubbard tried to explain away his lateness by 
announcing that he'd just gotten off a plane from Japan, a voice rang out of 
the darkness shouting, "Yeah, man, and the check's in the mail!" 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the real circumstances, the music which followed was disjointed and 
unsteady. Hubbard, of course, can rip off a powerful solo almost any time he 
wants to, and there were indeed moments of sheer brilliance. But they were only 
moments, with the bulk of his efforts coming across with the fatigue of 
recycled glory. The real Hubbard essence must have been left behind on the 
plane from Japan.

Singer Diane Schuur worked more effectively with her own piano accompaniment 
than she has in recent outings as a stand-up singer. The addition of 
keyboardist Rob Mullins -- who provided an enormous array of synthesized sounds 
and crackerjack solos -- also helped balance Schuur's frequently monochromatic 
style. 
</P>
<P>
Sticking mostly to standards like "You'd Be So Nice to Come Home To" and "Teach 
Me Tonight," along with an occasional blues, she flashed occasional moments of 
excellence. But Schuur continued to mistake shrillness for energy and shouting 
for intensity. 
</P>
<P>
Tenor saxophonist Stanley Turrentine, closing the evening, brought things back 
into equilibrium with just the right mix. Winging comfortably through such 
pop-based pieces as Marvin Gaye's "Don't Mess With Mr. T.," he contrasted 
strong, blues-based improvising with easily accessible funk rhythms. It was, 
finally, the perfect ending for a beautifully staged, but musically unsteady 
festival performance.

The festival was scheduled to continue through Sunday with performances by 
Alphonse Mouzon, Chick Corea, Dianne Reeves and others. DON HECKMAN
