   A postal employee pulled a shotgun out at the
main post office Wednesday night, wounded three people and holed up
in the building with at least one hostage, authorities said.
   The gunman eluded police for about five hours before agents found
him in a room used for coffe breaks during a room-to-room search of
the block-wide building, said FBI spokesman Volney Hayes.
   The gunman, who Hayes said was holding at least one hostage,
fired two shots at agents, who then backed off.
   ``He was barricaded behind a door. As the agents approached he
fired,'' said Cesta Ayers, a post office spokesman.
   Negotiations with the gunman were being conducted by telephone,
Ayers said early Thursday.
   Earlier, Hayes said, the gunman got into an argument with a
co-worker and pulled a weapon out of a bag.
   Authorities identified the gunman as Warren Murphy, about 40, a
six-year postal worker. One of the people shot was the person Murphy
argued with, Hayes said. He did not identify the victim or elaborate.
   ``I was going to mail this box of stuff I have and the security
guard came down. He was real excited,'' said a witness, Pat
Wingerter of New Orleans. ``The guard was screaming, `There's a guy
with a gun!'''
   Four hours after the incident began at 8:30 p.m., authorities
said an undetermined number of postal employees were apparently
still inside the building but it was not known if they were being
held hostage.
   About midnight, a dozen postal employees who had been laying low
on the vast second floor escaped through a back door, Hayes said,
leaving about 20 to 30 or the 500 workers on the night shift
unaccounted for.
   ``We still think he's in there,'' he said. ``Some postal
inspectors have evacuated. ... They weren't really hostages.''
   Hayes said the workers who escaped had seen Murphy but hadn't had
any contact with him. The employees were hustled away by FBI after
they came out of the building.
   Ayers said Murphy may have had marital problems. ``The
information we have at this time ... is that his wife did leave him
and left the city. We have not talked to him, but that is the rumor
we have at this time,'' Ayers said.
   Two patients were at Tulane Medical Center where they were in
stable condition, a Tulane spokesman said. One person was hit in the
thigh and one in the arm. A third person was wounded in the eye and
was undergoing surgery late Wednesday at Charity Hospital, a
hospital spokeswoman said.
   ``I don't think anybody is hurt real bad at the present time,''
said Dr. Norman McSwain, police surgeon. ``I know nobody has any
life-threatening injuries.''
   Ayers said unidentified relatives were at the scene to assist
with negotiations. There was no word if Murphy was demanding
anything, said Hayes, whose agency was in charge of the situation
because the post office is federal property.
   Jerry Vale, a postal worker who was working on the ground floor,
said, ``I just saw some people come running from upstairs, saying
there was a man loose with a shotgun.''
   A security guard told police that the gunman might be hiding on
the second floor where letter-sorting machines and other large
equipment is located.
   ``There's plenty of places to hide up there,'' Vale said.
   Special police teams dressed in flak jackets surrounded the post
office on Loyola Avenue on the edge of the central business district.
   Wingerter said the security guard ran to the door to make sure
the half dozen or so postal workers and customers in the immediate
area escaped out the front safely.
   ``I heard one shot and then the people started coming out,'' he
said. ``Even after the shot, there were people driving up mailing
letters for about five minutes. It was crazy.''
   Adding to the confusion, holiday shoppers poured out the adjacent
Macy's department store to see what was going on.
   On Aug. 20, 1986, part-time mailman Patrick Henry Sherrill walked
into the post office in Edmond, Okla., with guns and ammunition
hidden in his mail bag and began shooting.
   He fatally wounded 14 postal workers and injured six others
before killing himself. Police, thinking Sherrill was holding
workers hostage, waited outside for an hour before entering the
building to aid the wounded and to free employees who had hidden
from the gunman. Witnesses said the final shots were heard about 40
minutes before police entered the building.
