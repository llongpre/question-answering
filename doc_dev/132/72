   Stanley Works expects to post 1987 earnings from continuing operations of $2.17 to $2.23 a share, Richard H. Ayers, president and chief executive officer, said. 

   In 1986, the hardware products maker had earnings from continuing operations of $77.9 million, or $1.84 a share, on sales of $1.37 billion. 
Profit from discontinued operations of $861,000 brought net income for the year to $78.7 million, or $1.86 a share. 

   In the first nine months of 1987, New Britain, Conn.-based Stanley posted a 22-cent-share loss from discontinued operations because of the disposal of certain operations. 
Mr. Ayers said in an interview that there won't be a similar charge in the final quarter, indicating that net income for all 1987 will range between $1.95 and $2.01 a share. 

   For the first nine months of 1987, net income totaled $60.5 million, or $1.39 a share, on sales of $1.3 billion. 

   Stanley has completed the sale of the steel and structures operations in Albuquerque, N.M., and San Antonio, Texas, and is negotiating to sell similar units in Phoenix, Ariz., and Denver, Mr. Ayers said. 

   He added that 1988 "is going to be a pretty good year," but that sales growth may be slower than in 1987. 

   Stanley closed at $26, up 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.
