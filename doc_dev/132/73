   Government policy makers must help bring down the
cost of doing business in New England in order to turn around the
region's slumping economy, according to a report issued Monday.
   The report from Bank of Boston Corp. says some costs, such as
wages and housing, will drop naturally as the economy continues its
slide. But government officials can assist in other areas where
economic cycles play a smaller role, such as health care costs and
workers compensation.
   ``Two weeks after the election of four new governors in New
England, we want to point out that the current debate has yet to
focus on the issue of the cost of doing business,'' said Wayne
Ayers, chief economist for Bank of Boston, who helped prepare the
report.
   ``So much attention during the election was understandably
focused on fiscal problems,'' he said. ``But the (state) budget to
any extent is a reflection of the underlying health of the
economy.''
   Ayers said high business costs not only threaten to further
erode New England's shrinking manufacturing base, but also could
hurt the region's services sector.
   He said the services sector cannot prosper when attorneys,
accountants and other vendors have nothing to service.
   ``We need a core manufacturing base, and therefore lowering the
cost of doing business is critical,'' he said.
   According to the study:
   - Housing prices, although declining, are still above the
national average and make it difficult to recruit new workers to
the region.
   - Medical care costs have raised health insurance premiums in
New England by 13 percent a year, about 3 percentage points above
the national average. The effect has raised the cost of doing
business in New England, compared to the rest of the nation, by
about $1,000 per employee per year.
   - Workers compensation is more expensive in New England than
elsewhere, and the problem is worse today than at the height of the
economic boom of the mid-1980s.
   Ayers said the weak economy would ``take its toll'' on housing
prices and wages.
   ``As painful as the process is, it is necessary for any kind of
recovery,'' he said.
   Ayers also said the region's business costs have been
exacerbated by the Persian Gulf crisis, which has increased higher
oil prices and added to the high bills paid by companies.
   Despite the gloom, the region has many strengths, the report
said, including emerging technology companies, a strong research
and education base, foreign trade and a skilled work force.
