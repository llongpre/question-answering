   Stanley Works, a New Britain, Conn., maker of tools and
hardware, said first-quarter net income fell 31% to $15.5
million, or 38 cents a share, on lower sales.
   The company blamed lackluster consumer spending and
building activity for weak sales, which dropped to $453.6
million from $484.1 million a year ago.

   Year-ago earnings were $22.5 million, or 53 cents a share.
The year-earlier period included a gain of $10 million from
the sale of the company's drapery hardware business, which
was partially offset by a $7.1 million charge for contingent
liability reserves.
   "We have felt for some time that the last half of 1990 and
the first quarter of 1991 would be the toughest economic
conditions for our businesses," said Richard H. Ayers,
chairman and chief executive officer. "We hope that this will
prove to be the case."
   Meanwhile, Mr. Ayers announced that the company was "in
the process" of acquiring Nirva, a Lille, France, maker of
closets. Although details weren't disclosed, Mr. Ayers said
Nirva would provide "a strong base for extending sales of
(Stanley's) Acmetrack and other hardware products in Europe."
