   The Oldsmobile division of General Motors Corp. is going to take its Southern California dealers for a ride this week. 

   Oldsmobile will try to improve the image -- and sales -- of its new Cutlass Supreme in this trendy region in a $1 million-a-month marketing campaign by linking the car to the most popular ride at Disneyland, Star Tours. 
The ride, a high-tech extravaganza designed to give the illusion of zooming through outer space, was inspired by George Lucas's "Star Wars." 

   Sales of Oldsmobiles in the region have slipped to a 4% market share from 5.7% two years ago, hurt by the recent proliferation of car makers and models. 
But the company concedes that part of the problem is that the car has an image problem -- it seems a bit boring. 

   Olds hopes the link with the futuristic space ride will give it a high-tech appeal. 

   Olds isn't the only advertiser targeting Southern California with such campaigns. 
Other auto makers are producing special, jazzier campaigns for that young and affluent market. 

   "As advertisers compete to gain additional shares they have to be more tactical about how they do it," said John Littlewood, chairman and chief executive of Ayer Pacific, a unit of N.W. Ayer Inc., a New York advertising company. 
Richard B. Edler, executive vice president and general manager of McCann-Erickson Los Angeles, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos., a New York holding company, noted that other car makers have tailored ad campaigns to the Southern California market. 
"It's a young, affluent market with lots of miles," said Mr. Edler. 
"A lot of car makers come to California simply to observe. 
California is a precursor of things." 

   Cy Schneider, chairman of the pacific division of Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, noted that the proliferation of imported cars in California has led domestic car makers to boost advertising expenditures in the state. 
"They recognize it's harder for Detroit to get a share of the market in California," said Mr. Schneider. 
"The car market here is so dramatically different that you have to look at it as another country. 
The car here is a symbol of freedom and an expression of one's personality." 

   Oldsmobile will introduce its campaign to dealers tomorrow, and its television, radio and print ads will run Feb. 11 through March 6. 
The TV commercials will show the Cutlass Supreme in front of Disneyland, in Anaheim, Calif., and emerging from the Star Tours ride. 

   As part of the campaign, Cutlass Supremes will be parked in front of the park and in front of the ride. 
Oldsmobile also will display one of its developmental Aerotech cars, which broke a land speed record last year. 

   Oldsmobile picked Disneyland for the link because of its "all-American" image and because it draws a large number of families, said James Zubor, Oldsmobile's Los Angeles marketing manager. 
Oldsmobile will pay for the ad campaign, and Walt Disney Co., owner of Disneyland, will help write and design the ads. 

   Lucasfilm Ltd., which holds copyrights on the ride with Walt Disney, agreed to allow the ad campaign. 

   When the campaign ends, Oldsmobile will continue to pursue "life style" marketing, or marketing aimed at specific groups -- particularly women, since they represent a large share of car buyers. 
Chrysler Corp. also has been targeting women with its ads in Southern California.
