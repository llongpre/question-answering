   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is
reassigning two top aides in an apparent attempt to erase the
impression that he runs the Justice Department through a tight
circle of political loyalists.
   Robert S. Ross Jr., the attorney general's chief of staff, was
assigned Monday to organize a new office of international affairs
within the department before returning to private law practice in
two or three months, said senior department officials.
   David Runkel, Thornburgh's press secretary who has been
repeatedly accused by reporters of providing misleading and
inaccurate information, will no longer serve as the department's
chief spokesman, said the officials, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Runkel has been appointed chief of communications and Thornburgh
will soon select a new spokesman, officials said.
   The realignment is intended to transfer much of the
decision-making power within the Justice Department from
Thornburgh's personal staff to the deputy attorney general,
officials said.
   The moves were announced three days after Deputy Attorney
General Donald B. Ayer, who has held the No. 2 post in the
department for only six months, announced plans to resign effective
May 25.
   Ayer quit because he was frustrated with the lack of operating
authority he was given by Thornburgh, said an administration source
who described Ross as the ``real deputy attorney general.''
   The officials said Thornburgh plans to give his new choice to be
deputy attorney general, William P. Barr, the operating authority
traditionally conferred on the holder of that office.
   Barr's appointment by President Bush will give Thornburgh the
opportunity to make the long-contemplated changes, the officials
said. Barr, an assistant attorney general, will serve as the acting
deputy while his nomination is pending in the Senate.
   `It was never his (Thornburgh's) intention to have a small
personal staff attempting to run the department,'' said one
official.
   But since he took office in August 1988, late in the Reagan
administration, Thornburgh had relied on a small cadre of aides who
served him when he was governor of Pennsylvania.
   Ross and Runkel are members of a trio of longtime aides who
formed what many Justice Department career officials came to call
the ``Harrisburg Mafia.'' Murray Dickman, the third member of the
triumvirate, will remain on Thornburgh's staff.
   Lower-ranking officials have complained of the difficulty
getting quick decisions from Thornburgh's office because they found
it difficult to pierce the inner circle.
   ``When the dust settles, you are going to see a Washington team
in place,'' one official said of the changes.
   Ayer's resignation announcement came two weeks after it was
disclosed that Thornburgh had ordered him to withdraw a letter
expressing Justice Department support for proposed sentencing
guidelines for corporations convicted of crimes.
   Thornburgh's aides said the attorney general had not authorized
Ayer's letter. Other officials, however, said Ayer's letter merely
expressed a longstanding department policy now being questioned by
the White House.
   An FBI investigation ordered by Thornburgh into the unauthorized
leak of information about a criminal probe involving the office of
Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., identified Runkel as a ``secondary
source'' of the news story.
   While Thornburgh defended his longtime aide, the disclosure of
Runkel's role in the episode was a political embarrassment.
