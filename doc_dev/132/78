Los Angeles lawyer and author Gerald Goldfarb was shot to death in a Newport 
Beach townhouse after he argued with a woman who then shot herself in the 
stomach, authorities said this morning. 
</P>
<P>
Pamela Ayers, 45, of Newport Beach critically wounded herself after she 
allegedly fired 10 shots from a 12-gauge shotgun she had purchased only hours 
before the shooting Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb died from multiple wounds, and Ayers underwent surgery for a wound to 
the abdomen and is listed in critical condition today at Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center. Her bail was set at $250,000, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Goldfarb, 49, a Harvard Law School graduate, was a monthly columnist for the 
Whole Life Times. Robert Hertzberg, a friend, said that Goldfarb had co-written 
a book, "Winning With Your Lawyer," and that he hosted a show on Century Cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Goldfarb and Ayers were longtime friends but would not say whether 
the relationship was romantic. Hertzberg said that Goldfarb "has been happy as 
a clam lately . . . and he was only married two months ago." 
</P>
<P>
The shotgun allegedly used still carried price tags, authorities said.
