   Two young brothers died after being scalded
by hot water in the bathtub of their housing project apartment in an
apparent accident, police said.
   Detectives questioned the boys' parents following the deaths
Thursday, but no charges were filed, police said. ``It just looks
like a very tragic accident,'' a homicide detective, Lt. James
Hansen said.
   Troy Ayers, 3{, and Kevin Wilson, 2, lived in the Queen Lane
Apartments with their mother, Sandra Ayers, 25, and her friend,
Kevin Wilson, according to Courtnay Bachan Cannady, spokeswoman for
the Philadelphia Housing Authority.
   A neighbor summoned housing authority police shortly after 10
a.m., Ms. Cannady said. She said the officers found the youngsters
outside the apartment, where a woman was trying to resuscitate one
and Wilson was holding the other.
   Housing police said the mother was not home, but The Philadelphia
Inquirer quoted police sources as saying Wilson and Ms. Ayers told
police they were asleep when the two boys apparently got out of bed,
went into the bathroom, climbed into the tub and turned on the water.
   In the steam-filled apartment, officers found a tub filled with
scalding hot water. Clothes, magazine and toys were floating in the
tub, Ms. Cannady said.
   The boys were pronounced dead on arrival at the Medical College
of Pennsylvania, hospitial spokeswoman Linda Lally said. The medical
examiner's officer ruled the cause of death as scalding.
