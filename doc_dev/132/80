   President Bush says he will nominate U.S.
District Judge Robert C. Bonner of Los Angeles to direct federal
law enforcement efforts against illegal drugs.
   Bush also said Friday that he would nominate William P. Barr to
be deputy attorney general, the No. 2 job at the Justice Department
   Barr would replace Donald B. Ayer, who resigned Friday to return
to private law practice. Department officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity said Ayer and Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh had clashed frequently, reportedly over Ayer's
resentment at lack of authority fitting the No. 2 job.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Bonner would succeed John C. Lawn as
director of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Lawn, a 27-year
government law enforcement veteran, ran the DEA from 1985 until his
retirement in March to become chief of operations for the New York
Yankees.
   Bonner, 48, has served on the federal bench in the Central
District of California, based in Los Angeles, since last year.
   Prior to that, he was U.S. attorney in Los Angeles for five
years.
   Barr, 39, is assistant attorney general for the Justice
Department's office of legal counsel.
   The nominations were announced in Columbia, S.C., along with
other Justice Department appointments, during a speech-making visit
by the president.
   Bush also said he would nominate:
   _J. Michael Luttig to be assistant attorney general for the
Office of Legal Counsel, succeeding Barr. Currently, Luttig is
principal deputy assistant attorney general in the same office.
   _Steven D. Dillingham to be director of the Bureau of Justice
Statistics. Since 1988, he has been deputy director for policy and
special programs for the Bureau of Justice Assistance.
   _Jimmy Gurule to be assistant attorney general for the Office of
Justice Programs. He has been an associate professor of law at
Notre Dame Law School since last year.
   _Charles M. House to be director of the Office for Victims of
Crime, a new position. House now is operations sergeant for court
services in Los Angeles and previously held various positions in
the Los Angeles County sheriff's department.
   Barr's principal assistant, Chief Associate Deputy Attorney
General Peter A. Nowinski, also announced his resignation. He and
his boss will leave on May 25.
   The Barr and Nowinski resignations came only a week after
Thornburgh's aides said the deputy attorney general had not cleared
with Thornburgh a letter expressing department support for proposed
sentencing guidelines for corporations convicted of criminal
offenses.
   Thornburgh ordered Ayer to withdraw the letter to the U.S.
Sentencing Commission after the White House inquired about the
position. Business groups had complained that the proposed
guidelines would be unduly harsh.
