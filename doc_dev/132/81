   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh went against
career Justice Department lawyers in agreeing to pay $25,000 to a
former department official who was investigated in the alleged
disclosure of government secrets, say sources familiar with the
case.
   A senior career department attorney who reviewed the case of the
official, political appointee Roger Pilon, concluded there was
sufficient evidence to have justified his firing and therefore he
was not entitled to reimbursement for legal expenses, according to
a memo to Thornburgh obtained by The Associated Press.
   But the attorney general overruled those findings and instead
authorized a settlement with Pilon, who had headed the Asylum
Policy and Review Unit.
   Several top officials strongly disagreed with Thornburgh,
according to sources familiar with the issue who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer, who wrote the memo to
Thornburgh, resigned in May - partially because of the attorney
general's handling of the matter.
   The dispute began in 1988, when Pilon was investigated by the
FBI in connection with an allegation that his wife, Juliana, had
disclosed a classified State Department document to a South African
diplomat. The document analyzed communist involvement in black
nationalist movements opposed to the South African government.
   Both Pilons have denied any wrongdoing, and Mrs. Pilon has said
she did not pass on any classified material.
   Prosecutors declined to press charges against the couple and
turned the matter over to the Justice Department's Office of
Professional Responsibility for a review of Pilon's conduct.
   Pilon was placed on paid leave during the investigation by the
FBI and the department's career-staffed internal watchdog unit.
   He later was reinstated by Associate Deputy Attorney General Dee
V. Benson, who said in a Sept. 9, 1988, letter to Pilon that ``no
implication adverse to you should be taken from the
investigations.''
   Several weeks later, Pilon resigned to become a fellow at a
conservative research organization.
   Last November, the Office of Professional Responsibility
released its 1988 annual report that alluded to Pilon's case
without naming him.
   The report said that a foreign counterintelligence investigation
indicated that an employee ``may have been involved in the
disclosure of classified information to a foreign government.''
   While evidence did not warrant prosecution, the report said, the
investigation had found ``sufficient cause to terminate'' the
official's appointment and said ``the employee resigned prior to
the initiation of removal proceedings.''
   Pilon, who told reporters that the report did refer to his case,
quickly demanded an apology from the department, asked for payment
of his legal fees and threatened to sue for character defamation.
   Thornburgh then asked Ayer to investigate Pilon's demands. Ayer
assigned the case to career Justice Department lawyer Lawrence S.
Robbins, who at the time worked in the solicitor general's office.
   Robbins, according to a Jan. 24 memo from Ayer to Thornburgh,
found that Pilon had been reinstated despite ``sufficient evidence
to justify Pilon's dismissal.''
   The memo obtained by the AP did not detail any evidence Robbins
cited in his classified report.
   Robbins also found, according to Ayer's memo, that OPR had not
been told of Pilon's reinstatement and thus could not be faulted
for saying the employee had ``resigned prior to the initiation of
removal proceedings.''
   Ayer recommended that Pilon not be compensated for his legal
expenses.
   Sometime after receiving the memo, Thornburgh decided to award
Pilon the $25,000 and to issue a formal apology for the wording of
the OPR report.
   Ayer, who now refuses to comment, said after he resigned in May
that Thornburgh had tried to use ``the matter,'' which he did not
identify by name, to discredit OPR and its head, Michael E. Shaheen
Jr., himself a career official.
   Ayer also contended that Thornburgh had been trying to undermine
Shaheen as his office was seeking to investigate two of the
attorney general's closest aides on an unrelated matter.
   Acting at Thornburgh's direction, Assistant Attorney General
Stuart M. Gerson in July wrote Matthew L. Myers, Pilon's attorney,
that the couple were entitled to an apology because ``the 1988
investigation of Mr. Pilon did not produce any evidence sufficient
to warrant his dismissal from the department.''
   That letter also referred to ``confusion created'' by the 1988
OPR report and said that Pilon had been ``restored
unconditionally'' to his position and that ``his subsequent
resignation was self-initiated and was not made in the face of
removal proceedings (which in fact never had been contemplated or
ordered).''
   The letter said the department was awarding the $25,000 to
settle Pilon's complaint.
   Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian now refuses to
comment on the Pilon issue, except to say that ``we stand by the
report'' issued by Gerson.
   Pilon, in an interview, said his decision to resign played no
part in his reinstatement by the department.
   ``You just don't return a top-secret security clearance, even if
it is for three weeks, if there is evidence that suggests that I
should be terminated,'' Pilon said.
