   Charlotte Beers, widely regarded as the most powerful
woman in advertising, surprised the industry by resigning as
chief executive officer of Tatham RSCG. Ralph Rydhom, her
longtime partner and the agency's chairman, will succeed her.
   The sudden resignation set off a swarm of speculation over
what Ms. Beers will do next. She said she hasn't made any
decisions except one: that after having run Tatham for a
decade, "10 years as CEO is just about right."

   Ms. Beers, along with Wells, Rich, Greene founder Mary
Lawrence, is one of just a few women to reach the top ranks
of the ad business. Charismatic and youthful, she has a high
public profile -- yet manages to be discreet in an infamously
gossipy industry. She never talks about her clients and just
as ferociously guards her age, though "Who's Who" reports she
is 56 years old.
   Tatham, which is based in Chicago, and its French parent,
Euro RSCG, clearly didn't want Ms. Beers to leave. Euro RSCG
owns three U.S. agencies -- including high-profile Della
Femina McNamee -- but Ms. Beers was the only American to
crack the French management's inner circle. She held the post
of vice chairman of Euro RSCG, and the French parent company
offered to move her to Paris as chairman in a bid to keep
her.
   But she declined, Texas-born Ms. Beers said in an
interview, because she didn't want to move to France, and the
post "sounds better on the resume" than it is in reality.
   Ms. Beers in the past has been heavily recruited by both
competitors and clients. She is known to have been wooed by
both Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. and Avon Products in the past.
Friends say they expect her to take a job in New York, where
her daughter lives.
   "I'm sure everybody is going to go after her," said
Saatchi's chief executive, Robert Louis-Dreyfus, although
"she definitely didn't call me before" leaving.
   Speculation flew Friday that Ms. Beers would join troubled
WPP Group's Ogilvy &amp; Mather or J. Walter Thompson agencies.
Also mentioned were Young &amp; Rubicam and Ayer, the latter of
which shares the Procter &amp; Gamble account with Tatham.
Executives at those agencies, though, said they weren't aware
of any such plans.
   Though Tatham is a midsized shop, with billings it puts at
$325 million, its reputation outstrips its size thanks to an
enviable list of blue-chip clients. Procter &amp; Gamble, its
largest client by far, has more than $100 million in billings
at Tatham, including assignments for Head &amp; Shoulders, Old
Spice and Mr. Clean. Stouffer Foods Corp.'s Lean Cuisine and
Ralston Purina Co. are among other clients.
   Tatham grew from about $100 million when Ms. Beers joined
in 1979; billings grew by 17% in 1991, according to the
company. "She's a very capable, very articulate and very
charming woman and probably is capable of holding any job in
the marketing or advertising world," says Edward Meyer,
chairman and president of Grey Advertising, another big
Procter agency.
   Some industry executives say Ms. Beers may have been
prompted to leave partly by disenchantment with the merger
last fall that created Euro RSCG. She had orchestrated her
agency's sale to France's RSCG in 1988, but RSCG's weak
financial position subsequently forced it to merge with
Eurocom. An apparent power struggle between the French
partners ensued, with Tatham as pawn: While Tatham handled
Procter, Eurocom handled arch competitor Henkel, a German
company. Since Procter and Henkel wouldn't co-exist as
clients in the same ad agency group, speculation was that the
French might sell off Tatham.
   Ultimately, though, Tatham and Procter prevailed -- and
the French group resigned the Henkel business in December
instead. Ms. Beers insists she is happy with the merger and
says "it had nothing to do with" her decision to leave.
   Procter declined to comment on Ms. Beers's departure,
which takes effect March 31. Mr. Rydholm, an amiable and
well-liked creative executive, said all clients had been
notified and were supportive. Nevertheless, in the current
weak advertising environment, other ad agencies are sure to
try and pick away at any business they can.
   In an interview, Mr. Rydholm said he doesn't plan any
major changes. "The agency has done very well," he said. "If
anything, I hope to continue doing what we're doing." Ms.
Beers, meanwhile, has exacting standards even as she heads
for the door: "If they don't triple this agency, I would be
surprised -- and also disappointed."
                                                                                                       

   Y&amp;R Defends Army
                                                                                                       

   Young &amp; Rubicam, New York, was awarded the U.S. Army's $57
million recruitment advertising contract, successfully
defending the account it has serviced since 1987.
   Y&amp;R retains the account under a one-year contract, which
the Army has the option to renew over an additional four
years, according to the Army's Defense Supply Services unit.
The contract could be worth as much as $302 million over the
five years, a spokeswoman said.
   New York agencies Backer Spielvogel Bates, a unit of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, and Ayer also competed for the account.
Y&amp;R won the business from Ayer in 1987.
                                                                                                       

   Dooner Named McCann Heir
                                                                                                       

   McCann-Erickson Worldwide promoted John J. Dooner,
president of its North American operations, to president and
chief operating officer, putting him next in line to run the
the international agency.
   Mr. Dooner, 43 years old, succeeds Robert L. James as
president. Mr. James, 57, continues as chairman and chief
executive of the agency, a unit of Interpublic Group of Cos.
   Mr. James said he isn't leaving McCann anytime soon. "Our
growth has put added pressure on me," Mr. James said, "and
the timing is right" to promote Mr. Dooner. McCann's flagship
New York office has racked up impressive new business gains
over the past 18 months, amassing an estimated $340 million
in new advertising billings.
   Mr. Dooner, known to be particularly close to the
Coca-Cola account, will continue overseeing the agency's
North American operations in his new job.
