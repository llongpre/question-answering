   Burger King Corp. hopes to reignite sales growth
with an advertising campaign that invokes the memory of the
flame-broiling-versus-frying debate that engulfed the fast-food
industry in the early 1980s.
   The campaign employs the theme ``We do it like you'd do it'' and
pitches Burger King's flame-broiling process as the one which
burger-lovers prefer.
   The campaign contains some reminders of the hard-hitting ads of
1982 in which Burger King asserted that tests showed people
preferred its flame-broiled hamburgers to those from the industry
leader, McDonald's Corp.
   McDonald's objected, saying its burgers are grilled and not
fried. The exchange became known as the Burger Wars.
   McDonald's name is only mentioned once in the new Burger King
ads, which were previewed for the media Tuesday in a New York hotel
room decorated to look like a backyard complete with sod, a
barbecue pit, lawnmower and picnic tables.
   In one new ad, a kindergartener discovers that her Burger King
hamburger has ``lines'' from broiling. She likes the taste and asks
a friend why she never gets similar lines on burgers from
McDonald's. Her pal shrugs.
   In another ad, a foreign exchange student savors a broiled
Burger King hamburger, and complains to some friends that
hamburgers are usually fried in his country. When told that some
burger places fry them here too, the student registers his
disbelief with a long ``Noooooo.''
   The ads begin appearing Feb. 29, and Burger King reportedly
plans to spend about $200 million putting them on the air and in
print over the next year.
   The approach, created by the agency N.W. Ayer Inc., replaces the
``Best Food for Fast Times'' theme that had been created by J.
Walter Thompson. Ayer was selected for the Burger King account last
fall.
   Burger King officials, speaking on condition they not be
identified by name, said consumers liked the ``Best Food'' and
``This is a Burger King Town'' campaigns created by Thompson but
failed to remember the characteristic that separates Burger King
from other hamburger chains _ flame-broiling.
   Charles S. Olcott, president of the Miami-based Burger King USA,
said the company's average sales per store had stalled. Burger
King's average sales per store cracked $1 million for the first
time in 1985 but rose to only $1.02 million in the year ended May
31, 1987.
   McDonald's had average sales per store of $1.37 million in 1986,
and has about 7,400 stores nationwide compared with 4,700 for
Burger King.
   They are the leaders in the fast-food market, which the trade
magazine Advertising Age estimates at $60 billion. Hamburgers
account for roughly half of the figure.
   Another hamburger chain, Wendy's International Inc., based in
Dublin, Ohio, recently began airing new versions of an old campaign.
   Wendy's and Hardee's Food Systems Inc., based in Rocky Mount,
N.C., are fighting for third place in hamburgers, analysts say.
   The agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates, has created some new
versions of a 2{-year-old campaign for Wendy's, known as
``Hamburger A-Hamburger B.''
   The campaign spoofs consumer taste-tests as an interviewer asks
someone in each ad to choose between a fresh-looking Wendy's
Hamburger A and an unappetizing Hamburger B.
   A truck driver picks B in one ad, and beams that he can have one
``in Shakeytown and still be tasting it in Salt Lake.'' In another,
a woman trying to lose weight said she'd pick B because she
wouldn't be tempted to eat it.
   Wendy's used humor to boost sales in 1984 when its advertising
asked, ``Where's the Beef?'' Wendy's average sales per store peaked
at about $861,000 in 1984, but slipped to $767,000 in 1986,
according to spokesman Paul Raab.
   With the new ads and the installation of SuperBars that offer
all-you-can-eat Mexican or Italian food or salads in about a third
of its 3,600 domestic restaurants, Wendy's sales are picking up,
said another spokesman, Denny Lynch.
   He added the company expects ``a gradual improvement through the
year.''
