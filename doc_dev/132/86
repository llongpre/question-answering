   A blaze authorities say started with a
4-year-old playing with wood in an open heater claimed the life of a
second firefighter Thursday.
   Capt. Jimmy L. Ayers, 46, died at Baptist Medical Center, where
he had been treated for second- and third-degree burns over 80 to 90
percent of his body.
   Sobbing friends and family packed the corridor outside the
third-floor burn unit after the death was announced. Firefighters
wore strips of black across their badges and met with firefighters
and police officers who came from Shreveport, La., to help counsel
them.
   Fire Chief Tom Smith said a memorial service for Ayers and
Jeffrey Lindsey, who died in the fire Wednesday, would be held
Saturday.
   The boy's mother, Dorothy Munker, told neighbors she tried
unsuccessfully to extinguish the fire before fleeing with her son.
Three other children were at school.
   A third burned firefighter, Capt. Bennie D. Zellner, 44, was in
critical condition at Baptist Medical Center.
   Smith said doctors had set the extent of Zellner's burns at 60
percent of his body, down from an earlier estimate of 70 to 80
percent. Smith said Zellner's bodily functions remained strong and
the firefighter had regained some movement in his hands and feet.
   All three firefighters were inside the living room of the house
when gases released from burning material ignited suddenly, a
phenomenon known as a flash over, Smith said.
   The deaths were the first in almost 40 years involving Oklahoma
City firefighters while fighting a fire.
   Ayers had been with the department for 23 years. He is survived
by his wife, Betty Lou, and their three children.
   Lindsey, who had been with the department for 3{ years, is
survived by his wife, Melissa, who is expecting their first child.
