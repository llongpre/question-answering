<HEAD>J.C. Penney Promoting Its Fashions During Academy Awards</HEAD>

   J.C. Penney Co. Inc., attempting to freshen its
image, will air new commercials during the Academy Awards program
Wednesday night aimed at focusing attention on the 87-year-old
retailer's latest fashions.
   In a series of four 30-second spots, the retailer will highlight
men's and women's apparel, and other merchandise, such as jewelry
and home furnishings, Penney's advertising agency NW Ayer said.
   The ad for men's fashions features a man clad in a
European-styled suit and silk tie walking down an alley. The
voiceover says: ``People buy more men's suits, shirts, slacks and
ties at J.C. Penney than at any other department store. And, that
suits us just fine.''
   The women's clothing commercial shows a woman in an updated
version of a classically tailored oatmeal-colored suit riding on
what appears to be an old-fashioned iron-work elevator.
   As she descends, light coming through the door illuminates what
she's wearing and the following is heard: ``People buy more women's
fashions at J.C. Penney than at any other department store. Now
there's a fashion statement.''
   Jim Hradecky, the creative director of NW Ayer's Dallas office,
said the commercials are a bit different for Penney, which normally
gears advertising to sales or special events, such as the promotion
of a new line of merchandise.
   ``These are neither. They are fashion oriented,'' said Hradecky,
who wrote the commercials.
   He said the commercials, which are designed as a supplement to
the retailer's regular television ads, are significant because they
promote Penney as an authority on fashion.
   Penney has been a sponsor of the Oscar presentation ceremony in
past years. In 1988, Penney debuted one new ad during the show and
used re-edited versions of existing ones.
   In October 1987, Penney announced plans to alter its retailing
strategy.
   It has placed added emphasis on women's clothing and expanded
its apparel offerings. It also stopped selling various hard goods,
such as home electronics, in its retail stores while continuing to
provide them through its catalogs.
   Kay Baker, a Penney spokeswoman, said the commercials appearing
Wednesday night contain what she called a new ``lifestyle''
approach that the retailer had been planning to test in its ads.
   But she said Penney does not intend to abandon its historical
strategy of concentrating its ads on events and sales.
   The Academy Awards presentation, which attracts more than 25
million viewers, is used by many advertisers as a forum for airing
their latest promotions.
