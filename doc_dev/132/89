FT  13 MAY 94 / Whitehall shake-up urged for jobs

A Whitehall department should be set up to replace the employment and
education departments as part of a package of measures to focus education
more towards the job market, a report published by a Conservative pressure
group said yesterday.
The Tory Reform Group paper includes proposals to relaunch the training and
enterprise councils in England and Wales - the employer-led bodies which
deliver government training schemes.
It recommends almost halving the number of Tecs from 75 to 40 and allowing
them to replace local education authorities as a source of support for
schools.
Mr Julian Ayer, author of the paper, said: 'The idea is not to amalgamate
the employment and education departments but to let them wither gradually
after the formation of this new department.'
The other aim of the proposals was to stop the growth of an 'underclass' and
create a skilled workforce up to world standards.
Mr Ayer said that 20 per cent of the labour force was permanently excluded
from work or functionally illiterate and employed in low-skilled jobs which
were disappearing. The new Whitehall department, he said, would take in the
minister for sport from the National Heritage Department and the prison
education service.
The Commons trade and industry committee recently suggested that the
employment department's responsibilities should be transferred to the trade
department.
The Tecs, Mr Ayer said, had been given insufficient power to deliver the
local training and employment links hoped for when they were established in
1990.
