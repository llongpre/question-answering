   Federal officials ended their investigation into N.W. Ayer Inc.'s handling of the U.S. Army recruiting campaign, the ad agency said. 

   Louis T. Hagopian, chairman and chief executive officer of Ayer, said he had been notifed by U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani in New York that the case had been closed. 

   The investigation, which began in July 1983, resulted in a former Ayer employee's guilty plea in 1986 to a charge of accepting kickbacks from a supplier of recruiting films. 

   Last November the Army broke off a 19-year-old relationship with Ayer, "largely because of this investigation and the innuendoes it generated," Mr. Hagopian said. 

   "The U.S. attorney's decision leaves us with a profound sense of relief that our confidence in the honor and integrity of Ayer is vindicated at last," he added. 
"We're not angry any more." 

   Ayer had been responsible for the "Be all you can be" ad campaign for the Army. 
The $100 million account was awarded to Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. in January.
