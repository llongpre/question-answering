   Just two weeks after Subaru awarded its major ad account
to Wieden &amp; Kennedy, one of the nation's hottest small
agencies, another Japanese car maker appears ready to select
a small "hot shop," too.
   Word leaked on Madison Avenue that American Isuzu Motors
had selected five small agencies with enviable creative
reputations to compete for its $75 million to $90 million
account. The agencies include Goodby, Berlin &amp; Silverstein,
San Francisco; McCabe &amp; Co. and Altschiller
Reitzfeld/Tracy-Locke, both of New York; and two Minneapolis
agencies, McElligott Wright Morrison White, and Carmichael
Lynch.

   The news surprised some industry observers, who noted that
most car makers' accounts are serviced at big ad agencies
that are perhaps better suited to the complex day-to-day
handling of car accounts. But Subaru bucked convention when
it tapped Wieden &amp; Kennedy, a small but creative agency best
known for its "Bo knows" Nike ads. Industry executives said
Isuzu, too, may be looking to distinguish itself with risky,
offbeat ads.
   "I think that American Isuzu is playing follow the
leader," said Alice Magdol-Conrad, of ad agency headhunters
Magdol &amp; McCone. "The feeling here might be that in
competitive times you have to take a gamble. I can guarantee
you that Isuzu wouldn't have made this decision without
Subaru's move first."
   But Ms. Magdol-Conrad and other industry executives warned
that these smaller agencies might not be equipped to service
the giant accounts. "There's a real question as to whether
{these agencies} can maintain their same character, or if
they will be able to handle the business at all. This is more
than just getting out a Nike ad."
   Car accounts are far larger than the clients most small
agencies are accustomed to handling, and small shops don't
routinely run accounts in the $100 million range. Most car
advertising also involves tie-ins with local car dealers all
around that country, requiring an up-and-running network that
most small agencies don't have. And the sheer number of
commercials and variations requires intensive manpower.
   Wieden &amp; Kennedy apparently satisfied Subaru that it is
capable of handling the business. After being awarded the
creative portion of the account, it later convinced Subaru to
let the firm handle the media buying, too. The shop, based in
Portland, Ore., set up a service office in Mount Laurel,
N.J., near Subaru's U.S. headquarters in Cherry Hill, N.J.
   The only other major Japanese car maker that has its
account serviced at a small agency is Honda, whose ads are
created at Rubin Postaer &amp; Associates in Los Angeles. Omon, a
small agency in New York, does handle Toyota's small
corporate-image account, but the majority of Toyota's
advertising work is handled by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
   Isuzu, a unit of Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan, wouldn't
confirm the names on the list or say what affected its
decision to hear pitches only from smaller shops. A
spokeswoman said only that a list of the finalists would
likely be released today.
   To be sure, one reason Isuzu may have narrowed its
selection to five small shops is that most big agencies
already have a car account. Its previous agency, Eurocom's
Della Femina McNamee, is much bigger than any in the quintet
it will now consider. That shop created the well-known
commercials featuring "Joe Isuzu," the lying car salesman.
Isuzu, which has been posting sluggish sales at best, fired
Della Femina in May and assigned media-buying duties to SFM
Media Corp. in New York; the small shop that wins the Isuzu
account will oversee only the creative portion.
   The Isuzu contenders prefer to suggest it was their
creative firepower that wooed the Japanese auto maker. The
executives said Isuzu's decision to look at hot shops may be
a reflection of today's auto market: U.S. car makers are now
competing head on with the Japanese car companies' long-held
claims of superior value and reliability.
   "I think Wieden broke it wide open for agencies out in the
hinterland, where a lot of cars are sold," said Lee Lynch,
chairman and chief executive officer at Carmichael Lynch.
"They broke the myth that car accounts have to be based in
New York or Los Angeles." His agency, with billings of about
$100 million, is one of the biggest being considered; others,
including McElligott Wright and McCabe, are brand new shops
run by legendary admen that each have only a few small
accounts.
   Goodby Berlin, with billings of about $120 million, has
been on a hot streak lately, winning Heublein and the Carl's
Jr. account from Carl Karcher Enterprises. But Goodby may
have a conflict in its Northern California Honda Dealers
Association account; agency executives couldn't be reached to
find out how that could be resolved.
   Regardless, the small agencies are gearing up for what
will be a relatively quick review process. Isuzu has told the
shops that they will receive a briefing outlining an
advertising project within the next week, and that final
presentations will be made in the last week of July. "We sent
out a fun internal memo to our employees about us being
included in the review," Mr. Lynch said. "The note was signed
by Joe Isuzu and included all kinds of lies, like that the
account is $300 million and that it's already down to two
agencies."

   Ayer Promotes Three
                                                                                                       

   Ayer promoted three top executives, consolidating the
number of executives reporting to the chairman of the agency,
Jerry J. Siano.
   Thomas F. Maxey, the agency's 54-year-old vice chairman,
was named to the additional post of chief operating officer.
Dominick F. Rossi Jr., 50, who had been president of the
agency's flagship New York office, was promoted to president
of Ayer's U.S. operations. Patrick J. Cunningham, 48, who has
been chief creative officer since 1987, was given the
additional title of vice chairman.
   Three executives who had been reporting directly to Mr.
Siano will now report to Mr. Maxey. Glenn E. Corlett, 47,
chief financial officer; David Gantman, 49, managing director
of account services; and Richard Hedger, 53, chairman of
Ayer's European operations, will report to Mr. Maxey.
   Mr. Siano, 56, said Mr. Rossi would continue to oversee
the New York office and no one would be named to succeed him
as president of that office.

   DDB LAYOFFS: Omnicom Group's DDB Needham agency let go 29
of 700 employees in its New York office, and a spokesman said
some more cuts "probably" will be made in the Chicago office.
The employees were dismissed "because of client budget
cutbacks," the spokesman said. While DDB hasn't had any major
client losses, it has been behind budget this year because of
a decline in ad spending by its clients.
                                                                                                       

   WHO'S NEWS: Bob Stone, 72 years old, has rejoined Stone &amp;
Adler, the Chicago direct response agency he founded in 1966,
as interim chairman. The agency said president Craig Thomas,
43, had left the agency. Mr. Thomas declined to comment on
his departure. Stone &amp; Adler is a unit of Dentsu, Young &amp;
Rubicam Partnerships, a joint venture of Young &amp; Rubicam and
Dentsu of Japan.
                                                                                                       

   NEW AGENCY: Two British expatriates have formed a small
new New York agency called Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen. The agency
is headed by creative director Nick Cohen, who used to work
at Chiat/Day/Mojo and Ogilvy &amp; Mather, and new business
director Mike Geach.
