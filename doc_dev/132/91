   State officials say they're not sure how
to respond to an appeals court ruling that segregation still
affects Mississippi's public universities because they can't
mandate where students will go to school.
   ``How to integrate the universities in Mississippi is a question
beyond me. It's very complicated _ a very thorny-type issue,'' said
State College Board member Sidney Rushing of Gulfport. ``You can't
force students to attend.''
   Gov. Ray Mabus said Wednesday that many education reforms being
considered by lawmakers would improve conditions at all the
colleges, but declined to comment directly on the court's action.
   ``There are still areas in which we need to work harder and we
have made progress.''
   The governor said the universities would benefit from improved
literacy programs and other measures to improve the quality and
quantity of high school graduates.
   The 2-1 decision Tuesday by a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
panel in New Orleans overturned a lower court ruling in a lawsuit
by blacks over policies at Mississippi's five historically white
and three historically black universities.
   The court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Neal B.
Biggers Jr., who had dismissed the lawsuit in 1987, declaring
Mississippi's university system sufficiently desegregated.
   Historically white Southern Mississippi, Delta State,
Mississippi State, Mississippi University for Women, and the
University of Mississippi enjoy distinct advantages over
historically black Alcorn State, Jackson State and Mississippi
Valley State universities, the panel ruled.
   More than 99 percent of the state's 26,953 white college
students were enrolled in historically white institutions during
the 1985-86 school year, while 71 percent of 12,826 black students
were enrolled in historically black schools, the court said.
   House Speaker Tim Ford and others argue the Legislature tries to
promote integration and to equitably fund all eight universities.
   ``I don't see what else we can do, other than mandating where
people can go,'' Ford said.
   Mississippi spent an average $1,351 in 1960 and $8,516 in 1986
per student enrolled at historically white institutions. The
average at historically black schools was $718 in 1960 and $6,038
in 1986, the court said.
   Legislators say little new money can be squeezed out of the
overburdened state budget.
   Appeals court judges Irving Goldberg and Sam D. Johnson said the
black colleges are still inferior and ``there remains in
Mississippi's higher educational system vestiges of discrimination
which distort the perceptions of black students'' 15 years after a
lawsuit was filed against the higher education system.
   There is no formal plan for desegregating the eight
universities, although presidents are encouraged to strive for a
racially mixed enrollment by recruiting blacks and whites.
   ``If the state of Mississippi continues with its tradition, it
will delay any changes as long as possible,'' said state Sen. Doug
Anderson, chairman of the Senate Universities and Colleges
Committee. ``What we do know is at the predominantly white
institutions, there is very little black faculty. And there is also
the discriminatory way appropriations have been made to
predominantly black institutions. Historically, they've received
fewer dollars and less attractive, new programs.
   ``This case is very important to the survival of black
institutions. Right now, the lowest salaries, the worst facilities
are at predominantly black institutions.''
   The College Board can ask the three-member panel of the court to
reconsider the ruling or ask the full 15-member court to take up
the case.
   College Board attorney Bill Goodman of Jackson said he is sure
the ruling will be considered by the full court. ``I'd rather do my
talking in the courtroom,'' he said, declining further comment.
   State Rep. Aaron Henry, president of the Mississippi NAACP,
appealed to students and administrators of traditionally
white-dominated schools to be more accepting of black students.
   ``Racism is America's No. 1 problem. This ruling about
Mississippi gives a true portrait of Mississippi, but in any other
state the ruling could have been the same,'' said Henry.
   In his dissent, Judge John Duhe said Mississippi had fulfilled
its legal obligation to open its universities to all students,
regardless of race.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1975 by Jake Ayers of Glen Allen on
behalf of his son, Jake Ayers Jr., a high school student, and 20
other black students. The younger Ayers later attended junior
college but dropped out to join the Air Force.
   Ayers' widow, Lillian Ayers, said she has another son who will
graduate from high school this year.
   ``Hopefully he will benefit from the change,'' Mrs. Ayers said.
