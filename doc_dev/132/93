A Whitehall department should be set up to replace the departments of
employment and education as part of a package of measures to focus education
more towards the job market, a report published by a Conservative pressure
group said yesterday.
The Tory Reform Group paper includes proposals to relaunch the Training and
Enterprise Councils in England - the employer-led bodies which deliver
government training schemes - almost halving their number from 75 to 40 and
allowing them to replace Local Education Authorities as a source of support
for schools.
Mr Julian Ayer, author of the paper, said: 'The idea is not to amalgamate
the employment and education departments but to let them wither gradually
after the formation of this new department.'
The other aim of his proposals was to stop the growth of an 'underclass' and
create a skilled workforce up to world standards. He said that 20 per cent
of the labour force was permanently excluded from work or functionally
illiterate and employed in low skilled jobs which are disappearing.
The new Whitehall department, said Mr Ayer, would take in the minister for
sport from National Heritage and the prison education service.
The Commons select committee on trade and industry recently suggested that
the employment department's responsibilities should be transferred to the
trade department.
The Tecs, Mr Ayer said, had been given insufficient power to deliver the
local training and employment links hoped for when they were established in
1990.
They needed to be relaunched, the report said, as independent local
strategists freed from central government control and encouraged to merge
with chambers of commerce.
It also called for the development of a partnership between Tecs and
universities, partly to refocus the educational system on vocational
concerns rather than on academic elitism.
