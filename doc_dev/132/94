   General Motors Corp.'s Saturn subsidiary ended a seven-month search for an advertising agency by choosing Hal Riney &amp; Partners Inc., the youngest and smallest of three finalists and the one considered a long shot by many in the industry. 

   San Francisco-based Hal Riney is known as a feisty, creative agency and has had high visibility in recent years for its commercials for E.&amp;J. 
Gallo Winery, particularly the Bartles &amp; Jaymes wine coolers. 
But many people had expected Saturn to pick a more traditional agency. 

   The Saturn account is expected to bill between $90 million and $100 million a year, making it one of the biggest awarded in recent years. 
Some 50 agencies solicited the account, but Saturn narrowed the list to Riney, N W Ayer Inc. of New York and Boston-based Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos Inc. 
The account will increase Riney's billings 50% to $300 million. 

   At a news conference in New York, Saturn officials said they picked Riney because of its creative reputation and because of its strong presence on the West Coast. 
Japanese cars are particularly popular with Californians, and import buyers are the consumers Saturn intends to chase in its advertising. 

   In addition, Saturn may have seen Riney's smallness as an asset. 
In a memo to staffers, Jerry Siano, chairman of Ayer's U.S. operations, said Saturn officials told Ayer that Riney's size promised the "near total involvement of Hal Riney and key associates" with Saturn. 
Saturn's importance to Riney, which has about 200 employees, could anger other clients of the agency. 
But John Yost, a senior vice president at Riney, said because the agency has two years' lead time before Saturn cars are introduced, there would be no "pressure" to divert people from other account responsibilities. 
And that represents an "adequate time frame" for figuring out how many additional people to bring on board, he said. 

   Chairman Hal Riney promised that his agency's campaign, which hasn't been developed yet, will be markedly different from other auto advertising. 
"I don't think we will ever shoot a picture of a car going down a wet, winding road," Mr. Riney said. 

   The Riney agency also sold itself to Saturn in an unconventional way. 
The company made a sentimental film based on interviews with children in the Tennessee community where Saturn cars will be made. 
When GM executives visited Riney in San Francisco, the agency hung out a brass plaque that playfully labeled each floor of its building with names such as "Future Saturn Partnership Headquarters." 

   It's likely Riney will have to resign its $20 million Sterling car account. 
Austin Rover Cars of North America had threatened to drop Riney when it learned the agency was bidding for the Saturn account, but Mr. Riney persuaded the company to defer a decision. 
Officials at Austin Rover, a unit of Rover Group PLC of Britain, couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Like most auto makers, GM doesn't allow any of its agencies to work for competitors, a policy that complicated the Saturn search. 
Because of the wave of agency mergers in recent years, most big shops already have a car account. 
Other car makers who have looked for new agencies in recent months have faced the same problem as GM, leading them to consider smaller agencies. 
Saab-Scania of America Inc., for example, recently chose Lord Einstein O'Neill &amp; Partners. 

   A Saturn spokesman said there was no timetable for advertising to begin, but Saturn cars aren't expected to reach the market until 1990. 
GM hasn't told any outsiders what the cars will look like, and most aspects of how they will be sold remain up in the air. 
It also isn't clear whether Riney will also do advertising for Saturn dealerships. 
The local advertising done by most GM dealerships usually isn't done by GM's national agencies, but Saturn and Riney officials suggested that Saturn dealers would likely choose to go with Riney. 

   An executive at Riney said billings for dealership advertising are expected to come in at around $25 million to $35 million within about two years.
