   The head of the Justice Department's criminal
division, Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., is resigning to join a
Philadelphia law firm, officials said Wednesday night.
   Dennis' resignation, expected to be announced Thursday, creates
another vacancy in the top echelons of the Justice Department,
which has been plagued by personnel difficulties in the last year.
   But officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Dennis's resignation as an assistant attorney general is unrelated
to recent turmoil on the staff of Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.
   Dennis, who has spent most of his career as a Justice Department
prosecutor, will become a senior partner at the prestigious
Philadelphia firm of Morgan, Lewis and Bockius, said one official.
   ``This is for his personal and professional benefit,'' the
official said.
   Without disputing that, two sources familiar with the situation
said Dennis had grown frustrated with Thornburgh's
close-to-the-vest management style that centralized decision-making
in the attorney general's office. These sources spoke on condition
that they not be identified.
   Dennis, the first black to head the Justice Department's
criminal division, will join the national litigation section at the
firm
   Morgan, Lewis and Bockius has more than 600 lawyers in several
cities, including Washington.
   As a holdover from the Reagan administration, Dennis long had
plans to return to Philadelphia, where he was U.S. attorney for
five years before he became assistant attorney general in 1988,
officials said.
   He commutes daily by train from his home near Media, Pa., a
suburb southwest of Philadelphia.
   Last year, Dennis served as acting deputy attorney general as
well as head of the criminal division. As such he was the
highest-ranking black ever to serve in the department.
   Dennis, who officials said would remain on the job through
August, is the second top Justice Department official to resign in
the last two months.
   In May, Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer, the department's
No. 2 official, resigned amid great acrimony, later accusing
Thornburgh of mishandling an internal investigation of an
unauthorized news leak.
   Sources said Ayer was also frustrated because he had been frozen
out of policy-making decisions by the attorney general's top aides,
who worked for Thornburgh when he was governor of Pennsylvania.
   Several days after Ayer's resignation, Thornburgh resassigned
two top aides, spokesman David Runkel and chief of staff Robert S.
Ross Jr. in an attempt to counteract criticism that he was isolated
from the department and surrounded by political loyalists.
   The president nominated William P. Barr, assistant attorney
general in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel, to succeed Ayer
as deputy.
   Barr told the Senate Judiciary Committee at his confirmation
hearing Wednesday that he was asked by Thornburgh to restore the
traditional lines of authority in the department.
   Barr said that post of executive assistant to the attorney
general, which had been Ross's job, was abolished. Barr said he now
reports directly to Thornburgh.
   The 40-year-old Barr, who is acting deputy attorney general,
told senators that all the Justice Department components now report
to the attorney general through him.
   When Ayer was deputy, some divisions and agencies reported to
Thornburgh, Barr said.
   Barr told lawmakers that Thornburgh's staff assumed more
responsiblities than the attorney general had intended because he
had difficulty recruiting top people in the waning days of the
Reagan administration.
   Personnel difficulties continued after Thornburgh was asked to
stay on as attorney general in the Bush administration.
   His first choice for deputy attorney general, Robert Fiske, was
rejected by conservatives because of involvement in the American
Bar Association's judicial screening committee.
   Barr told the committee that Thornburgh's staff continued to
retain many responsibilities because of the difficulty finding a
deputy.
   Beside's Barr's appointment, other nominations for vacant
Justice Department positions are pending in the Senate.
   The Senate is also considering the nomination of Michael Luttig
to succeed Barr as the department's legal counsel.
   Late last year, Carol Crawford, assistant attorney general in
charge of legislative affairs, resigned following a series of
bureaucratic turf wars. Lee Rawls has been nominated to head the
office.
