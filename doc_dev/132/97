   A federal appeals court ruled that
vestiges of segregation ``permeate'' Mississippi's public
universities 15 years after a lawsuit was filed to change the
system.
   The 2-1 decision by a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in
New Orleans overturned a lower court ruling in a lawsuit by blacks
over policies at Mississippi's five historically white and three
historically black universities.
   ``The badge of inferiority that marks black institutions has not
been removed,'' judges Irving Goldberg and Sam D. Johnson wrote in
the decision released Tuesday. ``As such, there remains in
Mississippi's higher educational system vestiges of discrimination
which distort the perceptions of black students.''
   Unfortunately, they wrote, ``this case lingered, loitered and
lulled for more than a decade'' without adequate changes.
   Hours after the ruling, state leaders of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People appealed to
students and administrators of traditionally white-dominated
schools to be more accepting of black students.
   ``Racism is America's Number 1 problem. This ruling about
Mississippi gives a true portrait of Mississippi, but in any other
state the ruling could have been the same,'' said state NAACP
president Aaron Henry.
   He said whites had not worked as hard as blacks in the
desegregation effort that began when a court ordered the University
of Mississippi to enroll James Meredith, its first black student,
in 1962.
   ``The willingness of the black communities to adapt to their
(white) presence is more than the whites are willing to accommodate
blacks,'' Henry said.
   In his dissent, Judge John Duhe said Mississippi had fulfilled
its legal obligation to open its universities to all students,
regardless of race.
   ``The majority, relying on district and other circuit court
decisions, has ... imposed upon the state the same constitutional
duty required for primary and secondary education, where freedom of
choice is unavailable and services are free of charge.''
   The State College Board can ask the panel to reconsider the
ruling, or can request an opinion of the full 15-member court.
   Board attorney Bill Goodman said he would withhold comment until
after the ruling is reconsidered.
   Aubrey Lucas, president of University of Southern Mississippi,
said: ``My first reaction was one of regret that we were unable to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the courts some very significant
progress has been made.''
   Historically white Southern Mississippi, Delta State,
Mississippi State, Mississippi University for Women, and the
University of Mississippi enjoy distinct advantages over
historically black Alcorn State, Jackson State and Mississippi
Valley State universities, the panel ruled.
   ``Vestiges of de jure segregation permeate the public university
system of Mississippi,'' the majority decision said. ``Admissions
policies, the racial composition of the faculty and administration,
funding practices, academic offerings and mission designations all
perpetuate a stigma of inferiority.''
   More than 99 percent of the state's 26,953 white college
students were enrolled in historically white institutions during
the 1985-86 school year, while 71 percent of 12,826 black students
were enrolled in historically black schools, the court said.
   Mississippi spent an average $1,351 in 1960 and $8,516 in 1986
per student enrolled at historically white institutions. The
average at historically black schools was $718 in 1960 and $6,038
in 1986, the court said.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1975 by Jake Ayers of Glen Allen on
behalf of his son, Jake Ayers Jr., a high school student, and 20
other black students.
   The elder Ayers has died and his son, now 32, moved to Oklahoma
after dropping out of junior college to join the Air Force. His
mother, Lillian Ayers, said she has another son who will graduate
from high school this year.
   ``Hopefully he will benefit from the change,'' Mrs. Ayers said.
   The court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Neal B.
Biggers Jr., who had dismissed the lawsuit in 1987, declaring
Mississippi's university system sufficiently desegregated.
   The appeals panel called for the lower court's re-hearing to
include testimony from psychologists, sociologists and other
professionals.
   ``Windows must open to ventilate the courtroom with ideas from
the winds of truth,'' it said. ``To this end, testimony,
depositions, cross-examinations and opinions can assist. Only then
should the parties come forth with a definite plan for'' achieving
desegregation.
