   New England's economy is in for another 18
months of sluggish growth even though the region's credit crunch
may be easing, a panel of experts said.
   Legislators, economists and bankers gathered at a symposium on
the tightened credit market in the Northeast agreed the worst may
be over.
   Federal regulators have largely completed their intensive review
of real estate lending in the region and the slowdown in lending
caused by that review appears to be diminishing, the participants
said.
   But Wayne Ayers, chief economist of the Bank of Boston, said
Thursday the end of the crunch does not mean that credit will
automatically begin to flow freely again.
   ``The economy in New England has been, and I think will continue
to be pretty soft for the next 18 months,'' Ayers said.
   High wages and housing prices are discouraging businesses from
moving into New England, Ayers said. And commercial and residential
construction, fed by the boom years of the 1980s, has far outpaced
demand leading to a severe contraction of that industry.
   ``The New England economy has yet to bottom,'' Ayers said.
``There are no `sleeping beauty' industries out there that can
realistically be expected to rejuvenate the region's economy.''
   The symposium was called to address the extent to which
stepped-up federal regulation in New England may be accelerating
the region's economic slide.
   That question remained unsettled, but participants agreed that
recent moves by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the
Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have eased
the concerns of bankers.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a member of the House Banking
Committee, said a meeting two weeks ago between the heads of those
three federal regulatory agencies and the American Bankers
Association was a key step in easing fears of a regulatory clamp on
lending.
   In that meeting, the Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan along with the comptroller and the head of the FDIC urged
bankers to continue making loans to credit-worthy customers.
   ``I can't remember the last time the three top regulators
thought it important to tell bankers to lend money. That was at
least implicit acknowledgement that things were too tight,'' Frank
said. ``The Secretary of Commerce does not meet with Iacocca, Smith
and whoever runs Ford and say `Gee, I think you guys should sell
cars.'''
   Frank Maguire, Deputy Comptroller of the Currency, said the
major purpose of that meeting was to thwart what the OCC viewed as
an overreaction by bankers to regulators.
   Frank disagreed, saying there was strong evidence indicating
that the OCC was being overly strict in ordering New England banks
to reclassify loans as ``non-performing.'' That step forces banks
to add more money to their loan loss reserves, money that might
otherwise be loaned.
   Regardless of who was at fault for the credit crunch, there was
little doubt among the panelists that it had some downward impact
on the economy.
   In Connecticut, more than 80 percent of the 2,000 businesses
that responded to a survey sensed a shortage of available credit,
according to John Rathgeber, vice president of the Connecticut
Business &amp; Industry Association.
   More than 60 percent of those responding, Rathgeber said,
reported that they were unable to get credit on the same terms they
had always enjoyed. The problem was concentrated in the working
capital area, money loaned to help businesses maintain day-to-day
operations.
   ``The unavailability of working capital has tremendous spinoff
effects on the economy,'' Rathgeber said. ``For Connecticut's
economy and for New England's economy, we need access to credit
markets.''
