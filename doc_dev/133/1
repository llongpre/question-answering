   Rio Grande Industries Inc. received government
approval Tuesday for its $1.2 billion purchase of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, one of the nation's oldest rail lines with track
stretching from Oregon to Louisiana.
   Southern Pacific, which has 15,000 miles of track, will retain
its name and incorporate into its operations the smaller Denver &amp;
Rio Grande Western Railroad once the purchase is completed, company
officials said.
   By a 4-0 vote, the Interstate Commerce Commission gave approval
for the railroad's sale by its parent Sante Fe Southern Pacific
Corp., to Rio Grande Industries, a subsidiary of the Denver-based
Anschutz Corp.
   Philip Anschutz, owner of the privately held company, told
reporters he intends to concentrate on reducing Southern Pacific's
debts, partly through the sale of some of its real estate holdings,
and modernize the railroad's equipment and facilities.
   ``We will be in the railroad business, first and foremost,''
said Anschutz, whose background is in energy.
   Anschutz, who has a reputation of being reclusive, acknowledged
that he had never before held a news conference, but he said he
wanted to meet with reporters to set to rest unfounded ``rumors,''
including one that sought the Southern Pacific to break it up and
make a quick profit.
   ``It's very important that this company be kept together,'' he
said.
   The Anschutz Corp. purchased Rio Grande Industries four years
ago.
   William Holtman, chairman of Rio Grande Industries, expressed
confidence in Anschutz's devotion to railroading. ``He's a
long-term player,'' Holtman said of Anschutz.
   The ICC said the merger of the Southern Pacific and the Denver &amp;
Rio Grande Western railroads would have the best competitive
benefits and be in the public interest. The merger was recommended
by both the Justice Department and the Transportation Department.
   The commission last year ordered the Chicago-based Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp. to divest itself of either the Southern
Pacific or the Santa Fe railroads after it rejected a proposal to
merge the two rail lines. The company chose to sell the Southern
Pacific.
   Southern Pacific's stock has been held in a trust for nearly
five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should own
the railroad.
   ``We look forward to completing the sale, getting out of
trusteeship and moving forward again with a clear idea of Southern
Pacific's future course and direction,'' said Denman McNear,
chairman of the Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
   Anschutz said the Southern Pacific's management team would be
chosen from among the senior managers of both the Southern Pacific
and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western.
   Santa Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries
on the sale last February, but when permission for the transaction
was sought from the ICC, another railroad company, Kansas City
Southern Industries, objected and asked that it be allowed to buy
the railroad.
   But the ICC in a series of votes Tuesday turned its back on the
Kansas City Southern proposal. One concern of the ICC was Kansas
City Southern's financial outlook in light of a $600 million court
judgment that is under appeal.
   The judgment stems from antitrust and contract violations
involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in South Dakota. Kansas
City Southern had argued that the judgment would not affect its
ability to finance the Southern Pacific purchase.
   Kansas City Southern could challenge the ICC ruling in court,
but the company's president and chief executive officer, Landon
Rowland, said no decision has been made on what the next step, if
any, would be.
   ``We're not ruling out anything,'' Rowland told reporters after
the ICC vote.
   The Southern Pacific, which is rich in history, operates up and
down the West Coast and along the southern tier of the country with
tracks stretching from Portland, Ore., through central California
and across the Southwest as far east as New Orleans. It also
operates lines from San Francisco to Ogden, Utah, where it links up
with the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western, and from St. Louis to the
Gulf Coast.
   The Denver &amp; Rio Grande runs along a central corridor from Ogden
to St. Louis.
   Both railroads have been closely intertwined with the history of
the West, helping to bring in settlers, miners and industry.
   Southern Pacific's founders helped drive the golden spike in
Utah in 1869, linking the country's first transcontinental rail
line. Two years later, the Denver &amp; Rio Grande ran its first train
from Denver to Colorado Springs.
   Anschutz said the new railroad ``will operate under the banner
of Southern Pacific,'' although within the company the Denver &amp; Rio
Grande Western will continue to maintain its own identity.
   He said he decided to retain the Southern Pacific name because
it is by far the larger of the two railroads and probably better
known. ``Last of all, I like the name,'' he added.
