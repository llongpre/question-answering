   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said it petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission late Tuesday to reconsider the rejection of a plan to merge its two railway units -- Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 

   The appeal was expected. 
The regulatory commission blocked the proposed merger of the two railway units in July because of worries that it would hurt competition in the Southwest. 
Santa Fe Southern Pacific had until Tuesday to ask that the merger talks be reopened. 

   The railroad combination, which was the first to be rejected by the ICC in two decades, would have formed the nation's third-largest rail system. 
The two railway units have operated separately since their parents, Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Corp., combined in 1983 to form Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 
The companies' operations were combined except for the railroads, which need ICC approval to merge. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific also has interests in natural resources and forest products. 

   Since the ICC's rejection, Santa Fe Southern Pacific has been trying to win support for the merger of its units from its railroad competitors. 
Earlier this month, it agreed to give Union Pacific Corp. the right to operate on some of the units' lines, among other things. 
The agreement is similar to a September accord that gave Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad access to markets west of Ogden, Utah.
