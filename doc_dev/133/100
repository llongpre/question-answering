<LEADPARA>  The Eastern Establishment crushed the West Coast upstarts Friday night to
reclaim the title as Supreme Masters of the Computer Universe.;    A team
composed of senior executives from IBM, Digital Equipment Corp. and AT&amp;T --
with help from the New York Times -- blew away a dumbfounded Silicon Valley
five by the score of 460 to 170 in the third annual Computer Bowl trivia
contest.;    "I guess we should have studied more," said Heidi "Poison"
Roizen, president of T/Maker Co. in Mountain View and captain of the
outclassed West Coast team.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The embarrassed losers speculated that people working for those East Coast
computer companies have a lot more idle time to sit around and relive the
early days.;    The Computer Bowl is a fund-raising event sponsored by the
Computer Museum in Boston. The contest is patterned after the old TV quiz show
"College Bowl." The sponsors try to recreate the atmosphere of the old General
Electric program with campy quiz-show paraphernalia and mannerisms.;    In
previous years, the contest was held at Boston's World Trade Center and
televised by satellite to Silicon Valley and several other West Coast sites.
In the first Computer Bowl in 1988, the Easterners scored a 375-310 blowout.
In the second contest last April, the West Coast experts won an overtime
nail-biter, 300-290.;    This year, the event was held before a live audience
of 400 partisans at the San Jose Convention Center.;    They didn't get their
money's worth.;    The Easterners answered the first few questions posed by
Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft Corp., and never trailed in a contest that
was over by halftime. They relied most heavily upon their captain and most
valuable player, Pamela McCorduck, a computer historian and author of several
books on artificial intelligence.;    "Is that fair? Using a computer
historian?" asked David E. Liddle, chairman of Metaphor Computer Systems Inc.
in Mountain View and the West's MVP.;    Other members of Roizen's West Coast
team were David "Power" House, president of the microcomputer components group
at Intel Corp.; Philippe "King" Kahn, chairman and chief executive of Borland
International Inc.; and Ed "Here Comes The" Juge, director of market planning
for Tandy Corp.;    The first two Computer Bowls raised about $1 million in
cash, products and services for the Computer Museum. The event was expected to
bring in about $650,000 for the institution, which is located on Boston's
Museum Wharf.;    The contest was taped for use next month on "Computer
Chronicles," a weekly television series seen on many PBS stations.;    Other
members of the East Coast team were John Armstrong, vice president of science
and technology for IBM; James E. Clark, vice president for high-performance
systems at AT&amp;T Computer Systems; Samuel H. Fuller, vice president of research
for Digital Equipment Corp.; and John Markoff, technology writer for the New
York Times.;    Roizen tried to practice a little spin-control after the
thumping. "Since both McCorduck and Markoff have California roots, we consider
this a West Coast victory in spirit," she declared.; TEST YOURSELF;  So you
