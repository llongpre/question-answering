   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s three-year struggle to merge the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads cleared one hurdle, but another may have surfaced. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said it and Union Pacific Corp., another railroad concern, agreed on a plan to clear up regulatory concerns that doomed the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific lines last summer. 
But at the same time, Union Pacific voiced new objections to a similar agreement between Santa Fe Southern Pacific and another competitor. 
Those concerns could further tangle the merger effort. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific was formed in 1983 by the combination of Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Corp. 
The two companies' energy and other operations were immediately merged, but their railroad units have been kept apart pending Interstate Commerce Commission approval. 

   As previously reported, the ICC unexpectedly quashed the merger in July because of worries that the combination would stifle competition across the Southwest. 
The rejection, the first time the ICC had killed a railroad merger in 20 years, stunned the industry and led many industry officials to fear that the era of consolidation that began two decades ago -- the only thing that has kept many railroad concerns alive -- has ended. 

   Union Pacific originally argued against the merger, which would have created the nation's third-largest rail system. 
The new agreement, which will be submitted to the ICC as part of a petition to reopen merger hearings, would give Union Pacific the right to run its trains over some Santa Fe and Southern Pacific lines in Texas, Illinois and other areas. 
It would also give Union Pacific certain pricing authority and other rights. 

   However, a Union Pacific official said that Union Pacific has "serious problems" with a similar agreement forged between Santa Fe Southern Pacific and Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co., another competitor that originally opposed the merger. 
In September, Santa Fe Southern Pacific agreed to give Denver &amp; Rio Grande access to markets west of Ogden, Utah. 
In return, Denver &amp; Rio Grande said it would drop its opposition to the combination. 

   But the agreement allows Denver &amp; Rio Grande to operate in central California for the first time. 
Union Pacific, which has operations in that area, has "problems with that, and that's something we'll have to have addressed" if the ICC takes up the merger again, the Union Pacific official said. 

   A Santa Fe Southern Pacific spokesman said he "wouldn't want to characterize" Union Pacific's stance. 
He said Santa Fe Southern Pacific intends to go through with its agreement with Denver &amp; Rio Grande. 
"We recognize that not everybody will always be satisfied with these things," he said. 
"That's often the case where the ICC is concerned." 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific has been expected to formally ask the ICC to reconsider the merger for months. 
The spokesman said the company will submit its appeal to have the merger talks reopened within the next few days. 
It has until Dec. 9 to file the petition, he said.
