   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said it reached another agreement aimed at smoothing the way for the proposed merger of its two railway units, the Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific. 

   Santa Fe Southern said it reached a binding agreement with the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co., allowing the Denver &amp; Rio Grande to retain access to markets west of Ogden, Utah. 
As previously reported, the rail lines reached a tentative accord on rail access last September. 

   John J. Schmidt, chairman of Santa Fe Southern Pacific, said, "This agreement and those previously announced with Union Pacific and the Missouri-Kansas-Texas railroad have been designed to address adverse competitive impacts identified by the (Interstate Commerce Commission) relating to our proposed merger." 

   Last July, the ICC rejected the proposed merger, which would have formed the nation's third-largest rail system. 
The agency said the merger would be anti-competitive and cited opposition from several railroads, including the Denver &amp; Rio Grande. 

   The Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific have operated separately since their parents, Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Corp., combined in 1983 to form Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 

   A petition to reopen the merger case is pending before the ICC.
