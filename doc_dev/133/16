   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. was
trying to determine what its options are today after the Interstate
Commerce Commission approved the sale of the Southern Pacific
Railroad to Rio Grande Industries.
   Kansas City Southern, which had offered to buy the Southern
Pacific, could challenge the ICC ruling in court but the company's
president and chief executive officer, Landon Rowland, said no
decision has been made on what the next step, if any, would be.
   ``We're not ruling out anything,'' Rowland told reporters after
the ICC vote in Washington, D.C.
   Rio Grande Industries has agreed to buy the Southern Pacific
from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. for $1.2 billion. Kansas City
Southern has offered to buy Southern Pacific for $1.25 billion.
   But the ICC in a 4-0 vote said the merger of the Southern
Pacific and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western railroads would have
the best competitive results and be in the public interest.
   The commission last year ordered the Santa Fe Southern Pacific
Corp. to divest itself of the Southern Pacific after the rejection
of that railroad's merger with the Santa Fe.
   Santa Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries,
but when permission for the sale was sought from the ICC, Kansas
City Southern objected and sought to buy Southern Pacific as well.
   In a series of votes today, the ICC turned its back on the
Kansas City Southern proposal and approved the sale to Rio Grande
Industries instead.
   Meanwhile, a three-judge court is scheduled to meet Friday in
Kansas City to consider KCSI's application for a stay of a recent
order barring the company from completing its efforts to purchase
Southern Pacific, according to Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals
Judge Pasco Bowman.
   Bowman told attorneys in Kansas City that when a South Dakota
judge Friday prohibited the company from buying Southern Pacific,
he also delayed the prohibition from taking effect until after it
could be appealed.
   Bowman's observation came after a short hearing Monday morning.
He said a temporary stay on the prohibition, preventing it from
taking effect, was to last until next Tuesday.
   A federal judge in Sioux Falls, S.D., last week blocked KCSI
from buying Southern Pacific Railroad. Judge John B. Jones said
Kansas City Southern could not buy Southern Pacific while it is
appealing a $600 million judgment the state of South Dakota has
against Kansas City Southern.
   The judge ruled for South Dakota officials, who argued that the
purchase might jeopardize the recovery of their judgment in the
anti-trust lawsuit.
   But Kansas City Southern officials say the purchase would
enhance the value of their company, rather than harm it.
   South Dakota won the judgment in a suit alleging Kansas City
Southern helped kill a $3.8 billion coal-slurry pipeline that would
have helped the state's economy. The state contended Kansas City
Southern worked against the project because it would have hurt the
railroad's business.
   The pipeline plan was dropped in 1984.
