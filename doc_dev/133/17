   Billionaire Philip Anschutz has completed a $1.8
billion acquisition of the Southern Pacific Railroad, one of the
nation's oldest rail lines with track stretching from Oregon to
Louisiana.
   The historic railroad, combined with his Denver &amp; Rio Grande
Railroad, puts Anschutz at the head of the nation's fifth-largest
rail company in terms of track mileage.
   The purchase ``ends years of uncertainty and opens the door to
robust competition in the western rail corridors,'' said Rio Grande
Chariman W. J. Holtman at the deal's closing in New York on
Thursday.
   ``This historic combination brings together two railroads which
hold an important place in the pioneering of the West,'' he noted.
   Anschutz's new railroad has 15,046 miles of track and is ranked
sixth nationally based on revenues estimated at $2.5 billion. The
Rocky Mountain News reported that he paid $1.02 billion in cash and
assumed $760 million in debt.
   The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the combination in
August. Last year the ICC rejected a proposal that Chicago-based
Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. merge the Southern Pacific and
Santa Fe railroads and ordered the company to divest one of the
lines.
   The company chose to sell the Southern Pacific, but had to
overcome the objections of another rail company before it could
proceed. Southern Pacific's stock has been held in a trust for
nearly five years pending the outcome of the battle over who should
own the railroad.
   Anschutz, who made his fortune in oil, gas and real estate, will
become chairman of Southern Pacific.
   Mike Mohan, now executive vice president of Southern Pacific,
will become the chief executive of both lines, which will operate
from Southern Pacific's San Francisco headquarters. D&amp;RG had been
headquartered in Denver.
   Anschutz has said 400 to 800 jobs will be lost through the
consolidation of the two companies. The cuts likely will be split
evenly between San Francisco and Denver.
   The two lines will remain separate entities, although both will
be held by Rio Grande Industries Inc., said Anschutz's attorney,
Bob Starzel.
   D&amp;RG mainly carries coal on about 2,500 miles of track between
Kansas City, Mo., and Colorado and Utah and rents track to other
railroads. Three times a week runs the Rio Grande Zephyr from Salt
Lake City to Denver.
   ``This creates the only western railroad with two rail
corridors. ... Now, Southern Pacific and Rio Grande will be in both
the southern and central corridors,'' Starzel said.
