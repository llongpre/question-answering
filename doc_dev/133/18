FT  07 JUL 94 / US frontiers blurred after railway merger: Stock swap may
lead to east meeting west

A railway that makes a profit has become a rarity since road transport
started to offer a cheaper and more flexible alternative. But in the past
few years, US railways have been doing very nicely. Now two of them, the
Burlington Northern and the Santa Fe Pacific, plan to do even better by
merging their large networks in a Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.8bn) stock swap,
creating by far the biggest railway in the US: the Burlington Northern and
Santa Fe.
Unlike railways in most other countries, US railway companies - all of them
in the private sector - operate only freight trains. Passenger services are
operated over the private railways' tracks by the state-owned Amtrak, which
lost Dollars 730m last year.
Just 20 years ago, it was not too fanciful to imagine that US railways might
cease to exist. Federal government investment in the construction of an
interstate road system had encouraged rapid growth in the road haulage
industry, and the heavily regulated railways were unable to compete.
With many railways staring at bankruptcy, the industry went through a wave
of mergers in the late 1970s and early 1980s that cut the 17 big railway
companies to seven. Around the same time, the railways also began to see the
first glimmer of salvation with the passage of the Staggers Act in 1980,
which in effect deregulated the industry.
Once the merger mania was over, all the big railways started using their new
commercial freedom to set more competitive freight rates, drop unprofitable
traffic, dispose of loss-making lines and cut jobs. Gradually the red ink
turned to black.
While cost-cutting was the main theme of the 1980s, in the 1990s the
railways have started to win more traffic. Economic growth is one reason for
the increase; a shortage of drivers in the trucking industry has helped,
too. But more importantly, lower costs have enabled the railways to show
they are still capable of competing with road hauliers on price, at least on
long-distance trips.
One of their fastest-growing markets is for intermodal traffic - trailers
and containers that switch from road to rail for the long-distance part of
their journey.
Burlington Northern and Santa Fe say this is why they want to get together.
Although both railways lie to the west of the Mississippi, connecting the
Midwest with the Pacific coast, most of Burlington's network lies to the
north of Santa Fe's: so connecting the two would greatly increase the number
of long-distance destinations on offer to both railways' customers.
The merged railways would also get a substantial boost to competitiveness
because of the efficiency savings flowing from higher traffic densities and
reduced administrative costs.
The big question, however, is: will they get away with it? The Interstate
Commerce Commission, a federal regulatory agency, stood aside during the
wave of railway mergers in the 1970s and early 1980s. But in 1987 it
forcibly intervened in a deal between Santa Fe and another of the Big Seven
railways, Southern Pacific, telling them to unbundle a merger that had been
accomplished more than three years earlier.
Santa Fe hopes this deal will be different. The Santa Fe and Southern
networks, it says, were largely overlapping, and the Interstate Commerce
Commission had feared that a merger would reduce competition.
The Santa Fe and Burlington networks, by contrast, hardly overlap at all: it
would be an 'end-to-end' merger, increasing the options available to
customers and allowing the merged railways to compete more effectively with
Union Pacific, the biggest operator west of the Mississippi.
If the commission does allow the merger - and it could be the end of next
year before it reaches a decision - the result could be to encourage more
deals between US railways. But future mergers are likely to be different
from any seen before.
For years, the industry has speculated on the possibility that one of the
four big railways to the west of the Mississippi might merge with one of the
three big railways to the east - the Norfolk Southern, CSX and Conrail.
This would create a transcontinental railway network providing customers
with a seamless coast-to-coast freight transport service, without the costs
and delays associated with interchanging traffic from one operator to
another.
Analysts had speculated that any one merger would start a game of musical
chairs in which the other big railways would also scramble to form east-west
partnerships.
With four companies on one side of the Mississippi and three on the other,
it always looked as though one company west of the Mississippi would be left
in the cold.
A successful merger between Burlington and Santa Fe would send a signal to
the rest of the railway industry that end-to-end mergers were acceptable to
the commission, and conveniently even up the number of potential partners to
three on each side of the Mississippi. At that stage, the logic of a
transcontinental merger wave might become irresistible.
