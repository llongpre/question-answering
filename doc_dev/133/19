<HEAD>Rio Grande Files Application To Acquire Southern Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>

   Rio Grande Industries Inc. on Monday filed an
application with the Interstate Commerce Commission to acquire
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. for $1 billion from Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp.
   Rio Grande said in a news release that if the acquisition was
made, it planned to sell a 25 percent share in the merged railroads
to a limited partnership affiliated with the investment firm Morgan
Stanley Group Inc.
   The ICC already has approved an expedited schedule for the
application, with a final decision expected in six months, Rio
Grande said.
   The application follows a formal purchase agreement that Rio
Grande entered into with Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. Last year,
the ICC ordered Santa Fe Southern to divest either the Southern
Pacific or the Santa Fe Railroad.
   Rio Grande's action will affect Kansas City Southern Industries
Inc.'s rival bid of more than $1.25 billion for the Southern
Pacific, said Joele Frank of Adams &amp; Rinehart in New York, which
handles KCSI's public relations.
   ``Kansas City is planning to ask the ICC to choose which company
should acquire the Southern Pacific, based on which would serve the
public interest the best,'' she said. ``They will ask that the ICC
consider whether the bidder helps the competition, and also is
willing to pay a higher price.''
   Ms. Frank said KCSI should be aided in the ICC deliberations by
having the higher offer.
   Rio Grande officials equally were confident their proposal would
win ICC approval.
   ``We are confident that the commission will find this
single-line system covering both the southern and central rail
corridors will enhance competition for the benefit of shippers and
the public,'' said William Holtman, Rio Grande chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Tom Saunders, chairman of the equity fund, said: ``The financial
commitment we are making is the strongest statement possible about
our confidence in the long-term viability of this venture.''
   The two lines will be an end-to-end joining of railroads whose
common points at Ogden, Utah, Herrington, Kan., and Kansas City,
Mo., will allow complete connection of the two systems, Rio Grande
said.
   Rio Grande's proposal has been accompanied by a commitment to
honor existing labor contracts. The railroad also said it has
received the unanimous support of the general chairmen of all the
unions representing Southern Pacific workers.
   Roy Thiessen, vice president of marketing and sales for the
Denver and Rio Grande Western, said shippers have expressed support
for the merger as well.
   ``It is clear that the public and customers are anxious to see
this acquisition approved promptly, without delays caused by third
parties,'' said Thiessen.
