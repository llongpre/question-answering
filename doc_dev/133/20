   Rio Grande Industries said it intends to make a bid for Southern Pacific Transportation Co. in order to merge the carrier with its Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad unit. 

   Rio Grande, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp., didn't specify a purchase price. 
Industry analysts have said Southern Pacific could sell for as much as $1 billion. 

   Rio Grande is the latest in a string of potential buyers to step forward since June, when the Interstate Commerce Commission rejected as anti-competitive the proposed merger of Southern Pacific and the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway. 

   The ICC ordered the railroads' parent company, Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., to spin off one of the carriers. 

   Since then, Southern Pacific's employee unions, its managers and Kansas Southern Industries Inc., another railroad concern, have said they are planning bids. 
So far, none have made specific proposals. 

   Rio Grande earlier discussed buying a portion of San Francisco-based Southern Pacific. 

   Santa Fe officials declined to comment on any of the potential bidders. 
However, a spokesman said the company expects to comply with the ICC's order by the end of the year. 

   A Rio Grande-Southern Pacific merger would combine two of the oldest railroads in the West. 
Southern Pacific extends 13,000 miles from Southern California across the South and Midwest to Memphis, Tenn. 
Rio Grande stretches 2,400 miles across the Rocky Mountains. 

   Any bid from Rio Grande would require ICC approval. 
A company spokesman said the railroad doesn't anticipate regulatory problems since "nowhere do the tracks of these two railroads run parallel."
