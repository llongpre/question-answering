   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc.
says it has asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to authorize
KCSI, and not the Denver Rio Grande Western Railway, to acquire and
operate the Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
   The application was based on the belief that it would be in the
best public interest for KCSI to own Southern Pacific, said Landon
Rowland, president and chief executive officer of KCSI, on Monday.
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corporation has been required by the
ICC to divest the Southern Pacific because a merger between it and
the Santa Fe Railway would have essentially ended railroad
competition in the Southwest and other markets served by the two
railroads, Rowland said.
   ``Santa Fe Southern Pacific chose to sell the Southern Pacific
to Denver Rio Grande, rather than to Kansas City Southern, for what
we believe to be purely anti-competitive reasons,'' he said.
   KCSI's operating plan, filed Monday with the ICC, calls for the
purchase of 547 modern locomotives over the next five years.
   ``In contrast, the Philip F. Anschutz interests, which control
the Denver Rio Grande, appear to treat the acquisition as primarily
a real estate play, and propose to buy only 40 new locomotives over
essentially the same period,'' he said.
   Samuel R. Freeman, the Rio Grande's vice president and general
counsel, said his company wouldn't neglect the Southern Pacific. It
would lease most new equipment instead of buying it to capitalize
on financial and tax benefits, Freeman said.
   The Rio Grande runs across about 1,900 miles, from Kansas City
to Utah. It hasn't revealed details for combining its small local
work force with that of the Southern Pacific, which has about 280
employees.
   Monday was the deadline for comments about the Southern
Pacific's proposed sale to be filed with regulators.
   Also opposing the deal were Missouri Gov. John Ashcroft and the
Missouri Highway and Transportation Commission.
   Freeman said the Rio Grande's purchase was backed by most
shippers, regulators and other railroads.
   The ICC expects to rule in mid-August on the sale plan.
   Regulators last June killed Santa Fe Southern Pacific's efforts
to merge the Southern Pacific with the Rio Grande Railway, which it
also owns. They feared that a merger of the two big lines, whose
tracks overlap in many areas, would stifle competition and increase
shipping rates.
   Early last year Kansas City Southern began a furious campaign to
buy the Southern Pacific. But the lobbying didn't prevent Santa Fe
Southern Pacific from naming the Rio Grande as the railroad's buyer
in late December.
