   Burlington Northern Inc., which this week announced a new
rail-barge service, will be challenging a trio of railroad
rivals for the fast growing trade between the U.S. and
Mexico.
   The Fort Worth, Texas, railroad company operates the
longest rail system in the U.S., but it must rely on the
rails of competing carriers to reach the Mexican market.

   The new service is designed to challenge Union Pacific
Corp., Rio Grande Industries' Southern Pacific Transportation
Co., and Santa Fe Pacific Corp. for the half-billion-dollar
rail market, which is estimated to be growing 10% a year. An
anticipated free-trade agreement between the U.S. and Mexico
is expected to further accelerate the market growth.
   "Burlington Northern is the only one of the big Western
railroads that doesn't have a direct track connection to
Mexico," says William J. Rennicke, a vice president of
Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane, a transportation consulting firm in
Lexington, Mass. The rail-barge service planned by Burlington
Northern is "a very creative way to extend its rail network
and service into a growing market and bypass its three
Western rail competitors."
   Burlington Northern said yesterday that it and Grupo
Protexa S.A., Monterrey, Mexico, are equal partners in a
joint venture that will provide the rail-barge service by
mid-1992. The service, the first of its kind between the two
countries, will allow Burlington Northern freight cars to
roll onto Protexa rail barges at Texas Gulf ports. The barges
will link with the Mexican rail network at the east coast
ports of Altamira, Veracruz and Coatzacoalcos.
   The joint venture, Protexa Burlington International S.A.,
to be based in Mexico City, will represent a "substantial
pooling of assets," Burlington Northern said. The joint
venture will include rail cars, locomotives, tugboats and
barges equipped with rails for carrying freight cars.
   Burlington Northern officials declined to estimate
investment and revenues. But Anthony Hatch, an analyst at
PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said he expects the rail-barge
service to eventually generate revenues of about $100 million
a year.
   In announcing the new rail-barge service, Burlington
Northern said it hoped to alleviate the "ever-present, and
increasing, border and port congestion in Mexico."
   The company said the new service will initially haul grain
cars from the U.S. to Mexico but would be expanded to
transport products from raw materials to finished goods.
   Executives at railroads with direct track connections to
Mexico played down the competitive threat from the planned
rail-barge service. Rollin D. Bredenberg, vice
president-Mexico of Southern Pacific Transportation, said the
new service would allow Burlington Northern to increase its
market share at the expense of grain presently going by water
to the east coast of Mexico.
   "I think Burlington Northern will still access the
northern and western markets of Mexico using Southern
Pacific's gateway connections to Mexico," said Mr.
Bredenberg. "The rail-barge {service} will allow Burlington
Northern to compete with water transportation of grain to
points in central and southern Mexico."
   A spokesman for Union Pacific's rail unit, responding to
the Burlington Northern comment about border congestion, said
it has eliminated congestion problems at its Laredo, Texas,
gateway to Mexico. The company said changes in its train
operations and customs procedures have opened the flow of its
rail traffic across the border. In addition, Union Pacific is
currently leasing 30 locomotives to Ferrocarriles Nacionales
de Mexico to meet increasing demands for rail transportation
between the U.S. and Mexico.
