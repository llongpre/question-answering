   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and a union representing employees of Southern Pacific Transportation Co. asked the Interstate Commerce Commission Monday to block the sale of the Southern Pacific to Rio Grande Industries Inc. 

   Kansas City Southern's bid for the Southern Pacific was rejected by the railroad's parent, Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., last year. 
Kansas City Southern is hoping its offer will get a second airing, this time in the governmental arena. 
All rail mergers must be approved by the ICC. 

   The employee group, meanwhile, asked the commission to reject Rio Grande's merger application and support a bid by the Southern Pacific employees. 
The group represents members of an employee stock ownership plan who hold about a 1% stake in San Francisco-based Southern Pacific. 

   Santa Fe agreed to sell the Southern Pacific to Rio Grande, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp., for $1.02 billion in cash last December. 
Rio Grande also agreed to assume $780 million in Southern Pacific debt. 

   Although the other bidders never disclosed the amounts of their offers, Kansas City Southern reportedly offered a price close to Rio Grande's, but in cash and notes. 
The employees' bid was around $900 million, an official familar with the offers said. 

   Originally, Santa Fe intended to merge the Southern Pacific with its Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway unit. 
But the ICC denied the merger on anti-competitive grounds last June and ordered the company to divest itself of one of the railroad units. 

   Monday was the deadline for filing objections to the proposed sale. 

   Rio Grande's application received a boost Friday when the Justice Department, in an opinion filed with the ICC, said it saw no reason for the agency to disapprove the sale. 

   Rejecting Kansas City Southern's arguments, the Justice Department said it would be "unnecessary and burdensome" for the ICC to choose between two buyers who each meet the divestiture criteria. 
"The choice should be up to Santa Fe," the department said. 

   The Kansas City Southern's chances were further imperiled when a South Dakota federal jury recently ordered the company to pay the state between $243 million and $611 million for antitrust and contract-interference violations related to a coal-slurry pipeline project there. 
Kansas City Southern has asked the court to set aside the verdict and to order a new trial.
