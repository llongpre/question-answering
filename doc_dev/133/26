Two of the biggest railroads in the US, the Burlington Northern and the
Santa Fe Pacific, yesterday announced that they planned to merge in a deal
worth Dollars 2.8bn.
If allowed, the merger will create by far the biggest railroad in the US,
joining two complementary networks spreading from the west coast to the
midwest. It will be called the Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
However, the deal faces an investigation by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, a federal regulatory body which seven years ago ordered the
unbundling of a merger between Santa Fe and Southern Pacific, another
railroad in the same region, on the grounds that it was anti-competitive.
The proposed deal will take the form of a takeover of Sante Fe Pacific by
Burlington Northern, the bigger of the two companies. Santa Fe shareholders
will receive 0.27 of a Burlington share for each Santa Fe share they hold,
putting a value of Dollars 2.8bn on Santa Fe.
In other respects, the deal looks like a true merger of two healthy and
profitable companies. Burlington made net profits of Dollars 296m on
turnover of Dollars 4.7bn last year, while Santa Fe made net profits of
Dollars 338m on turnover of Dollars 2.7bn.
Although passenger trains in the US are operated by the state-owned Amtrak,
all the country's track infrastructure and freight trains are owned and
operated by private sector railroad companies.
Recently the freight railroads have enjoyed a surge in profitability caused
by a combination of growth in the US economy, big increases in efficiency
and productivity, and a lack of capacity in the road haulage industry
resulting from driver shortages.
West of the Mississippi, Burlington and Santa Fe are two of four big
railroads. The others are Southern and Union Pacific.
Burlington and Santa Fe said the proposed merger was not anti-competitive
because their networks were complementary rather than competing, connecting
with one another at the ends of their routes. The combined railroad would
compete mainly with Union Pacific.
The two companies said the merger would result in substantial cost savings
though operational improvements, higher traffic densities and reduced
administrative costs.
Customers would benefit from being able to use a single railroad to reach a
wider range of destinations, eliminating the costs and delays associated
with interchanges.
