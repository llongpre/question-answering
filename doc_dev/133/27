   The Interstate Commerce Commission today
postponed a decision on whether to approve a $110 million merger
that would make the regional Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co. a
part of the giant Union Pacific Corp.
   ICC Chairman Heather J. Gradison canceled a scheduled vote,
saying that Commissioner J.J. Simmons III had failed to give his
fellow commission members adequate time to review his proposed
conditions for the merger.
   Under agency rules, commissioners must distribute any amendments
the day before a planned vote. Simmons did not outline his
proposals at today's brief session and, under commission rules,
amendments are not made public until they are discussed at a
meeting.
   No new meeting to consider the merger was scheduled immediately,
and Al Brown, an ICC spokesman, said it was unlikely that another
vote will be set before next week.
   The railroads contend that consolidating operations would
provide improved service at lower costs and ensure reliable
long-term transportation, especially for Midwestern grain shippers
relying on the 3,100-mile MKT system known as the ``Katy.''
   Other railroads have questioned whether the proposed merger will
reduce competition, because the Katy's lines generally parallel
some Union Pacific routes from Kansas and Missouri to southern
Texas and the Gulf Coast. The Union Pacific is a 21,500-mile
network formed by a rail merger six years ago.
   To address those concerns, Union Pacific has offered competing
railroads the rights to use some trackage on proposed merger routes.
   Without the merger, the ICC has been told, the financially
ailing Katy could face problems surviving against bigger
competitors. Operating income for the Katy declined from $37
million in 1981 to $5 million in 1986.
   The Union Pacific, the nation's third largest railroad system in
terms of track mileage, serves about 20 states with routes from Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle in the West to Chicago and New
Orleans. The company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the
Union Pacific, Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific railroads.
   The Katy serves six states, with mostly north-south routes
running from Omaha to the Gulf Coast in Texas. A separate east-west
route extends between Kansas City and St. Louis.
   Union Pacific, which filed an application in November 1986
seeking government approval of the Katy acquisition, says the
merger would produce operating savings of $61 million a year.
Company officials say grain shippers would benefit through a
shorter, more direct single-line route to export markets in Texas
Gulf ports.
   However, the merger would eliminate about 1,100 Katy jobs
because of closings of rail yards and repair shops. Union Pacific
also plans to abandon 405 miles of track, mostly operated by Katy,
if the merger is approved.
   Union Pacific has taken steps to ease objections to the merger.
For example, the company has agreed to pay $1 million to the
southeast Kansas community of Parson in exchange for not opposing
the merger. The city would lose about 300 Katy jobs, with an
estimated $8 million payroll, under the merger.
