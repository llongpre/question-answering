   The Interstate Commerce Commission said it wouldn't decide whether to reconsider its rejection of the proposed merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads until March 2. 

   The commission said that reopening the case "may well be appropriate," but that it needed additional data from the railroads. 
In particular, it requested information on the steps the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific are taking to lessen anti-competitive problems posed by the merger. 
The commission raised questions of competition last July in rejecting the merger -- a move that stunned the railroad industry. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the Chicago-based holding company that owns the Santa Fe and holds the Southern Pacific in trust, has reached agreements with a number of other railroads in an effort to win support for the proposed merger. 
For example, it agreed to give Union Pacific Corp. and the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad rights to operate on some of the units' lines. 

   But the commission said it hasn't received sufficient information on the settlements, and warned: "We won't reopen on the basis of speculation that ongoing negotiations might produce an acceptable solution sometime in the future. 
The petition to reopen will be granted only if applicants can show in sufficient detail what their proposal is." 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. was created in December 1983, when Santa Fe Industries Inc. merged with Southern Pacific Co. in a $6.4 billion transaction. 
While the energy, natural resources and construction operations of the two companies were immediately combined, the two railroads were kept separate pending ICC approval.
