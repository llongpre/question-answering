   Kansas City Southern Railway Co. said it asked the Interstate Commerce Commission to uphold the rejection of the proposed merger between the Southern Pacific and the Santa Fe railroads. 

   In its petition, Kansas City Southern, a unit of Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., said it would make a bid to buy Southern Pacific Railroad within 60 days if the commission doesn't overturn itself. 
Kansas City Southern said it has retained Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to advise it on a bid for the railroad, but offered no details about any possible proposal. 

   Meanwhile, two government agencies voiced their opinions again on the merger. 
The Department of Transportation, which previously supported the merger, sent a letter to the commission yesterday reaffirming that support. 
The Justice Department, which has previously opposed the merger, reasserted its opposition. 

   The commission jolted the railroad industry last July by blocking the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific on the grounds that it would be anti-competitive. 
The merger, which was opposed by several railroads, including the Kansas City Southern, would create the nation's third-largest rail system. 

   Since July, Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., the parent of the railroad combination, has satisfied most of the opponents of the merger by offering traffic and pricing concessions. 
In December, Santa Fe Southern appealed the commission's ruling. 
Railroad industry experts said they expect a commission decision on the Santa Fe Southern Pacific appeal soon. 

   If the appeal is rejected, Santa Fe Southern Pacific would have to divest itself of one of the railroads under a time schedule and in a manner approved by the commission. 
In filings last year with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Santa Fe Southern Pacific said the Southern Pacific had net assets of $2.31 billion and 1985 revenue of $2.55 billion. 
For the first nine months of 1986, the railroad had revenue of $1.78 billion. 

   In an interview, Landon H. Rowland, Kansas City Southern's president and chief executive officer, said his company would bid for the Southern Pacific once the merger question is cleared up by the commission. 
He declined to say how much Kansas City Southern was prepared to bid for the railroad. 
"From our data and our familiarity with that system, we think the property, set free, can make money," Mr. Rowland said.
