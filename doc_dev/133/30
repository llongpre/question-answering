   Major airlines, still attempting to prop up sagging
earnings, slashed fares 50% on coast-to-coast flights.
   The $198 round-trip fares between some East Coast and West
Coast cities -- initiated by Trans World Airlines and quickly
followed by other major carriers -- are among the lowest
offered during the past decade for transcontinental travel.

   "This is the one that will bring people out of the
woodwork," predicted Thomas Nulty, president of Associated
Travel Services Inc., a Santa Ana, Calif., travel agency.
   However, industry analysts warned that while the lower
fares promise to spur travel, their effect on earnings is
unknown. "Whether or not this will generate profits, I'm not
sure," said Edward Starkman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   Net income continues to dive for most airlines. According
to the Air Transport Association, the industry trade group,
airlines had a $1 billion loss in the first half of the year,
compared with a loss of $63 million in the first half of last
year.
   "Now airlines are looking at their projected earnings for
the fall and they see that they have to do something," Mr.
Nulty said. "This will get travelers very excited."
   With the industry's summer peak travel season behind it,
TWA introduced the lower fares over the weekend "to try to
entice people to fly during this time of year when travel is
normally down," a TWA spokesman said.
   Aimed at leisure travelers, the Mount Kisco, N.Y.,
carrier's offer covers flights between Baltimore, Washington,
New York and Newark on the East Coast and Los Angeles,
Ontario, San Francisco and Santa Ana on the West Coast. The
tickets are non-refundable, require seven-day advance sales,
and must be purchased by Thursday for non-holiday travel
between Sept. 23 and Dec. 15.
   "This is as low as it goes for transcontinental travel,"
said Samuel Buttrick, an industry analyst at Kidder, Peabody
&amp; Co. "What I'd be wary of is that you want to control the
spread of this kind of pricing."
   Yesterday, as TWA began offering its fare cuts, United
Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., Chicago, and American
Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp., Fort Worth, Texas, not only
matched the TWA offer, but also added additional cities to
the promotion.
   United said it will add Oakland, San Jose, Long Beach and
Burbank -- all in California -- on the West Coast and White
Plains, N.Y. and New Haven, Conn., on the East Coast. "TWA
rolls out a shotgun and United rolls out a tank," said Mr.
Starkman. "This industry is just blistering competitive,
especially when bookings aren't there." Until recently, major
airlines would hardly have followed suit on TWA's promotion.
   In addition to matching the TWA offer, American Airlines
said it is offering $218 round-trip fares between the East
Coast and Oakland and San Jose. Industry sources say they
expect American to drop those prices to $198, to remain in
step with United. Delta Air Lines, based in Atlanta, and
USAir, a unit of USAir Group Inc., Arlington, Va., also moved
to match the TWA promotion, and likely will extend their
offers to the additional cities.
