   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. said it is in preliminary talks to acquire the Southern Pacific railroad unit of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. 

   Kansas City Southern first expressed interest in buying the Southern Pacific unit in January. 
The talks mark the first time that the Chicago-based company has agreed to provide information about the unit to Kansas City Southern. 
"We are seriously negotiating," said Donald L. Graf, Kansas City Southern senior vice president of finance. 

   Kansas City Southern said it is mulling "certain proposals" that have been submitted to it by Santa Fe. 
Kansas City Southern, a railroad and data processing concern, said it expects to respond to the proposals in the next few weeks. 

   Santa Fe was ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission in June to sell one of its two railroad units. 
The diversified railroad holding company is widely believed to be interested in selling the San Francisco-based Southern Pacific unit in order to retain the more profitable Chicago-based Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway unit. 
Some railroad analysts have estimated that the Southern Pacific unit could attract a bid of more than $1 billion. 

   In Chicago, a spokesman for Santa Fe said the company "would consider an offer from Kansas City Southern," but wouldn't comment on the talks. 

   Kansas City Southern is the only railroad operator so far that has publicly expressed interest in Southern Pacific, but it has yet to make a specific offer. 
Last month, a group of railroad unions representing Southern Pacific employees said it is fashioning a proposal to buy the unit. 

   In addition, Southern Pacific management is exploring a leveraged buy-out of the unit. 
In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is retired with money generated by the acquired company. 

   An acquisition of Southern Pacific would open the way into Southern California for Kansas City Southern. 
The Kansas City, Mo.-based concern currently operates a north-south line between Kansas City and the Gulf of Mexico, and an east-west line between Dallas and New Orleans. 

   Landon H. Rowland, Kansas City Southern president and chief executive officer, said late yesterday that if the company buys the railroad it probably would give closely held Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. access to Southern Pacific's central California operation. 
He declined to elaborate. 

   An acquisition might help Kansas City Southern management ward off an unwanted suitor by making the company harder to swallow. 
In August, a group led by New York real estate developer Howard Kaskel disclosed that it held a 7.9% stake in Kansas City Southern and asked for regulatory approval to acquire control of the company. 

   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kansas City Southern's stock fell 87.5 cents to close yesterday at $77.375 a share. 
Santa Fe shares closed at $51.50, down 50 cents, also on the Big Board. 

   Santa Fe was formed in 1983 through the merger of two railroad parent companies. 
In June, the Interstate Commerce Commission cited anti-competitive concerns to finally end the company's four-year struggle to combine the railroad units. 
The company has until Sept. 28 to submit a two-year railroad divestiture plan to the federal agency.
