<LEADPARA>  In 1863, workers of the Central Pacific Rail Road Co. began laying track here
at Front and K streets and headed east furiously. Six years later, Leland
Stanford drove a gold spike at Promontory Point, Utah, linking the West with
the rest of the country and securing Sacramento's place in railroad history.; 
  Today, the renamed Southern Pacific Transportation Co. is pulling up stakes.
The railroad officially notified workers Friday of plans to close its
Sacramento Locomotive Works and transfer the 358 jobs downtown to Denver.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Last vestiges of company;  "We're mindful that these are the last vestiges
of a company that was there when Sacramento was just a village," SP spokesman
Jerry Pera said.;    "But Sacramento isn't the railroad hub like it was then,"
he added. "We could liken the move to many other things that have changed in
society since then.";    Southern Pacific has evolved since Stanford and
co-founders Charles Crocker, Mark Hopkins and Collis P. Huntington -- known as
"the Big Four" to admirers, as "robber barons" to critics -- built the
nation's first transcontinental railroad.;    Today, their corporate legacy is
struggling in a modern railroad era of mergers and reorganizations, heavy
debt, tough competition and different transportation needs.;    "It's
certainly no secret that Southern Pacific is having financial difficulties,"
Pera said.;    145 employees laid off;  Those problems are reflected in the
company's decision last week to lay off 145 workers in Sacramento. Pera said
the action is necessary because there is not enough work for the employees,
who overhaul locomotives and make other heavy-duty repairs.;    The workers
could be recalled if more work becomes available, Pera said -- although the
shop eventually will be closed and moved to Denver.;    "Everyone knows that
Southern Pacific is struggling, and these layoffs are very clearly to reduce
costs," he said. "But there is no conscious effort to sell off properties or
lay off people just simply to pay down debt.";    Nevertheless, debt hangs
heavy over SP. Denver billionaire Philip Anschutz, who bought the railroad
from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. in 1988 for $1 billion, was left with a
debt of $1.7 billion.;    Efforts to slash debt;  To reduce the debt, the
company that once was the largest landholder in California has been selling
unused property. In 1989, SP sold a total of 5,800 acres for $350 million;
last year, the sale of track lines in the Los Angeles Basin to transit
officials brought $450 million.;    SP also has a letter of intent to sell 60
miles of lines stretching from San Francisco to San Jose for $300 million. The
company's historic San Francisco headquarters has been put on the block,
although it is not being actively marketed during the current real estate
slump, SP spokesman Mike Brown said.;    Five years ago, the company also
embarked on a plan to reduce its workforce of 30,000 by one-third. Today, SP
has 21,800 employees, Pera said.;    "Most of those are happening through
attrition . . . or layoffs if there isn't any work," he said. "For a while, we
were paying people to quit, but a company that's losing money can't afford to
do that.";    The sell-offs and downsizing have not been enough, however. SP
had reduced its debt by only $300 million last summer. Pera declined last week
to update that figure.;    Southern Pacific was the only major U.S. railroad
to report losses to the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1989 and 1990. The
San Francisco-based company lost $34 million in net income in 1989 -- it's
worst year since the Great Depression -- and $13 million last year.;    Union
officials in Sacramento said last week that SP officials told them the company
has lost $45 million since Jan. 1.;    Pera said the company's financial
troubles also stem partly from tough competition in the transportation
industry and changing needs among shippers.;    "Some commodities lend
themselves more to being shipped by (railroad) cars, like coal and grain," he
said. "We don't have tracks in those areas.";    About 30 percent of SP's
cargo is seagoing containers and flatbed trucks and trailers already loaded
with goods. The railroad has to compete for many of those shipments with the
trucking industry, which is mostly non-union and may ship goods directly and
to remote areas for much less money.;    "A lot of companies today order in
smaller shipments, one at a time," Pera said. "It's just enough to fit in a
truck.";    Founded in California, Southern Pacific has 20,000 miles of tracks
in 16 states in the West and Midwest. Its previous owner, Santa Fe Southern
Pacific Corp., is a Chicago holding company. Federal regulators forced it to
sell SP in 1987.;    With Anschutz based in Denver, speculation abounds that
the railroad that opened the West to a fledgling nation eventually may leave
its birthplace.  </TEXT>
