   CHICAGO -- Santa Fe Pacific Corp. said Michael R. Haverty
resigned as president and chief operating officer of the
holding company's flagship Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe
Railway unit.
   Mr. Haverty, 46 years old, will be succeeded by Robert D.
Krebs, Santa Fe Pacific's chairman and chief executive
officer.

   In a news release, Mr. Haverty said the parent company's
recent spinoff of its energy and real estate operations, and
the combination of the railway and holding company
organizations have created "an increasing amount of overlap"
in the responsibilities of the railway head and Mr. Krebs. He
said he had, as a consequence, "decided to seize the moment
to pursue new challenges."
   Since assuming the company's top railroad job in 1989, Mr.
Haverty had drawn positive reviews from industry analysts.
Among the accomplishments they cite are his negotiation of
agreements with rail unions, which cut the size of train
crews.
   He also launched innovative intermodal services, such as a
joint venture with J.B. Hunt Transport Services Inc. Under
that program, Hunt trucks pick up and deliver freight for
shippers, but transfer it to high-speed Santa Fe trains
between the Midwest and West Coast.
   Mr. Haverty also helped to rebuild the railroad's image
after its aborted merger with Southern Pacific Transportation
Co.
   But with the parent company's recent spin-off of much of
its non-railroad holdings, it "appears that there is a lot
less for Michael Haverty to do now that Robert Krebs is able
to devote more of his time to the railroad," said PaineWebber
Inc. analyst Anthony Hatch.
   In an interview, Mr. Haverty acknowledged "overlapping
responsibilities" as one reason he decided to leave the
company and "look for some new opportunities" in the
transportation industry, though not necessarily in
railroading.
