   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said the number of bidders for its Southern Pacific Transportation Co. unit has narrowed to five from seven, and that the lowest bid has increased to $900 million from $750 million. 
The company said the highest of the five bids is "well over $1 billion." 

   Separately, Henley Group Inc. is talking with several big banks about securing a $7 billion credit line for use in taking over all of Santa Fe Southern Pacific, individuals familiar with the talks said. 
There's no indication of how close to establishing the credit La Jolla, Calif.-based Henley might be. 
As previously reported, Henley has offered $63 a share in cash and securities, or about $9.94 billion, for the transportation, energy and real estate concern. 

   Officials at Santa Fe Southern declined to identify the suitors for Southern Pacific. 
But people familiar with the bids said they include offers from Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp.; a Southern Pacific management group; North Billerica, Mass.-based Guilford Transportation Industries Inc.; and the Railway Labor Executives Association, which represents Southern Pacific employees. 

   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. said late yesterday that it is also among the five bidders. 

   The company declined to identify which of the suitors had raised their offers. 
However, sources close to the bidding process said the management group and the Railway Labor union had increased their offers. 

   Santa Fe had set yesterday as the deadline for accepting firm bids for the railroad. 

   The labor union said previously that it offered $750 million for the railroad. 
Sources said the management group's original bid offered similar terms. 

   A spokesman for Southern Pacific confirmed late yesterday that the management group filed a revised bid, but declined to specify the changes. 
Railway union officials weren't immediately available. 

   Officials at Kansas City Southern and Denver Rio Grande declined to comment on the terms of their latest bids. 

   Santa Fe initially received two other bids, including one from Henley, which has since made its offer for the whole company. 
Sources said Chicago-based Itel Corp., another of the original bidders, dropped out after completing examining Southern Pacific's financial records. 
An Itel official declined to comment. 

   Santa Fe Southern shares closed yesterday at $51.75, up $1.875, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 

   Santa Fe decided to sell Southern Pacific earlier this year after the Interstate Commerce Commission rejected its plan to merge that railroad with its Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe unit. 
The ICC ruled that such a combination was anti-competitive and ordered Santa Fe to shed one of its railroads. 

   In recent weeks, the fate of Southern Pacific has been dwarfed by the uncertainty surrounding its parent company. 
After Henley Group announced its offer for Santa Fe, Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., a Toronto-based real estate concern, said it may match "or better" Henley's offer. 

   The banks involved in the Henley financing include New York-based Citicorp; officials couldn't be reached for comment late yesterday. 
The names of other banks couldn't be definitively learned. 

   A spokesman for Henley, a manufacturing, engineering and financial services concern, declined comment on the possibility of such a credit line, which would be among the largest ever established. 

   As previously reported, Henley has accumulated a 14.1% stake in Chicago-based Santa Fe. 

   A Santa Fe spokesman said discussions are continuing with both Henley and Olympia &amp; York.
