   An association representing the unionized employees of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s Southern Pacific railroad said it offered $750 million for the unit. 

   The Railway Labor Executives' Association said its bid was submitted together with a "parallel" offer from the management of the Southern Pacific unit. 
The two groups said they are working toward making a joint offer for the railroad. 

   Separately, Chicago-based Santa Fe said third-quarter net income soared nearly tenfold to $123.5 million, or 78 cents a share, reflecting a huge charge taken in the 1986 quarter and improved results for rail and oil operations. 

   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Santa Fe Southern Pacific closed down $4.75, at $56.25 a share. 

   Yesterday had been set by Santa Fe as the deadline for bids for its Southern Pacific unit, which the company put on the block after its proposal to merge its two large railroad units was rejected by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 

   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., based in Kansas City, Mo., also submitted a bid for the railroad in conjunction with Warburg E.M. Pincus &amp; Co., Landon H. Rowland, president and chief executive officer said. 
Mr. Rowland wouldn't give details of the offer but said the company's investment banker is Lazard Freres &amp; Co. 

   Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co., a unit of Rio Grande Industries, is also among the list of bidders, said William J. Holtman, president. 
Rio Grande is a unit of Anschutz Corp. Mr. Holtman wouldn't elaborate on the company's offer. 

   In addition to the $750 million in cash, the Washington-based union group said its bid includes the assumption of Southern Pacific's long-term debt and other liabilities, unspecified cost savings, and the spinning back to Santa Fe of certain tax credits attached to the unit. 
The union group said the "full economic value" of its offer is $3.6 billion. 

   It added that Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. would provide financing for its offer. 
In San Francisco, where the railroad is based, a Southern Pacific spokesman said the unit's long-term debt exceeds $800 million. 

   The management group wouldn't disclose details of its bid, but a spokesman said it is "similar" to the union group's bid and is based on retention of the railroad's core rail system. 
The group's investment banker is Hellman &amp; Friedman of San Francisco, the spokesman said. 

   A Santa Fe spokesman said the company has received several bids for its Southern Pacific unit, but he wouldn't elaborate. 

   For the 1986 third quarter, the holding company reported net income of $12.4 million, or eight cents a share. 
That included an after-tax charge of $70.5 million associated with the write-down of oil and gas properties. 

   Revenue for the 1987 third quarter rose 7.5% to $1.41 billion from $1.31 billion a year earlier. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said pretax operating profit in its transportation group rose 43%, largely because of increased shipments of grain and piggybacked trailers and containers. 
Meanwhile, sharply higher oil prices and higher daily oil production pushed petroleum operations into the black; those operations bled badly last year. 

   For the nine months, Santa Fe Southern Pacific reported that net income more than doubled to $259.8 million, or $1.64 a share, as revenue rose 1.8% to $4.01 billion. 
A year earlier, the company earned $123.9 million, or 74 cents a share, on revenue of $3.94 billion.
