   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. would sell off a major section of the Southern Pacific railroad, for which it is readying a bid, to Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co., a person familiar with Kansas City Southern's strategy said. 

   The Southern Pacific section in question, between Ogden, Utah, and California, is one of three main Southern Pacific lines, and has long been coveted by closely held Denver &amp; Rio Grande. 
The section, which analysts suggested would have a value of roughly $130 million, would give the Denver-based concern much-needed access to California markets. 

   Kansas City Southern's designs on Southern Pacific, which is owned by Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., were first disclosed in January. 
If the plans lead to any acquisition, they might have the additional benefit of discouraging an unwanted suitor for Kansas City Southern. 

   A spokesman for Santa Fe Southern Pacific said the company will consider any offers made for the Southern Pacific railroad. 
He said Kansas City Southern hasn't bid for the railroad. 
Kansas City Southern said it is still waiting for additional financial data on the railroad before setting a purchase price. 

   A group led by New York investor Howard Kaskel disclosed earlier this month that it has acquired a 7.9% stake in the Kansas City, Mo.-based railroad and data-processing concern. 
The group also has asked the government for clearance to seek control. 

   The Kaskel group has said it opposes Kansas City Southern's plans to bid for Southern Pacific and, in conversations between the two sides' Wall Street representatives, has said it believes Southern Pacific would be a drag on Kansas City Southern's earnings. 

   Samuel Freeman, a lawyer representing Denver &amp; Rio Grande, confirmed that his company is interested in acquiring the Southern Pacific section, as well as another route from Los Angeles to Portland, Ore., from either Southern Pacific or Kansas City Southern. 

   A Kansas City Southern spokesman said the company would be interested in selling pieces of Southern Pacific, but he didn't specify which ones. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific, formed in 1983 through the merger of the parent companies of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads, has been ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission to sell one of the railroad units. 
It is widely believed that the Chicago-based company will attempt to shed Southern Pacific, which, if sold, could fetch a price of more than $1 billion, railroad analysts have suggested. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific is considering a number of alternatives, including a sale or spinoff of all or part of the Southern Pacific unit, and is expected to file a divestiture plan with the ICC by Sept. 28. 
In addition, both the unit's management and its employees are considering leveraged buyout offers. 

   Kansas City Southern, however, is the only concern that has so far publicly expressed an interest in Southern Pacific. 

   In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.
