   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said it reached another agreement with a railroad company in an effort to win support for the proposed merger of its two railway units -- the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific. 

   The latest agreement is with Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co., a unit of Katy Industries Inc., Elgin, Ill. 
Santa Fe Southern Pacific said Missouri-Kansas-Texas will be given trackage rights over certain lines in Texas. 
In exchange, Missouri-Kansas-Texas said it will support the proposed merger, assuming the trackage-rights agreement is approved by the federal government. 

   As reported, the Interstate Commerce Commission stunned the railroad industry last July by rejecting a plan to merge Santa Fe and Southern Pacific. 
The agency cited anti-competitive problems with the merger. 
The two railway units have operated separately since their parents, Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Corp., combined in 1983 to form Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific recently appealed the ICC ruling. 
To drum up support for the appeal, the company agreed to give Union Pacific Corp. the right to operate on some of the units' lines and reached a similar agreement with Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad.
