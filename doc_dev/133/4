   The Interstate Commerce Commission heard from
two railroads Wednesday that are vying for the purchase of the
Southern Pacific Railroad, which is on the auction block because of
a failed merger attempt last year.
   The Santa Fe Pacific Corp., had agreed to sell its Southern
Pacific subsidiary to Rio Grande Industries Inc., the parent
company of the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad for $1.02
billion.
   But the deal, which requires ICC approval, has run into strong
opposition from Kansas City Southern Industries, operator of the
Kansas City Southern Railroad, which has offered $1.25 billion for
the 13,000-mile rail system that stretches from Kansas City to the
West Coast.
   The ICC heard from both railroads Wednesday as it tries to
determine which buyer to choose, or whether it might approve both
applications and allow Santa Fe to choose.
   A decision is expected next month.
   Samuel Freeman, an attorney for Rio Grande Industries, told the
ICC in formal arguments that the company is in better financial
position to buy the Southern Pacific than is Kansas City Southern.
   ``The request (by Kansas City Southern that it be allowed to buy
the railroad) is unprecedented and unwarranted,'' he said.
   Rio Grande officials noted that Kansas City Southern faces a
possible $600 million settlement from a legal entanglement that
grew out of its role in the a failure of a coal slurry pipeline
project.
   Kansas City Southern, however, maintained before the ICC that it
would be the most fit buyer of the Southern Pacific, arguing that
it is offering more money and plans to invest 20 percent more funds
in the railroad than the Rio Grande.
   ``We are committed to the acquisition and rehabilitation of the
Southern Pacific,'' said Landon Rowland, president of Kansas City
Southern Industries. He said the company would invest more than $4
billion in the railroad over a five-year period.
   Kansas City Southern has accused the Santa Fe Pacific Corp., of
favoring the lower Rio Grande bid because the merger would benefit
the Santa Fe Railroad, the other rail line owned by Santa Fe
Pacific Corp.
   Jerome Donohoe, representing Santa Fe Pacific, said the company
has a binding contract with Rio Grande and could not complete the
sale this year if the ICC were to choose Kansas City Southern.
   The Southern Pacific was put up for sale under an ICC
divestiture order after the ICC last year rejected a planned merger
of the Southern Pacific with the Santa Fe.
