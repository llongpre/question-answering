   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. said Friday that it wants to sell its ailing Southern Pacific railroad unit to comply with a federal divestiture order that it dispose of one of its two rail systems. 

   As expected, the diversified holding company said in a filing with the Interstate Commerce Commission that it wants to keep its more profitable Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway unit, based here. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said it is studying whether to sell San Francisco-based Southern Pacific as a whole or piecemeal, or whether to spin off the unit to shareholders. 

   As previously reported, the holding company already has held talks about a sale of the unit with Kansas City, Mo.-based Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and closely held Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. Groups representing Southern Pacific management and its unions also have shown interest in acquiring the unit. 

   An ICC spokesman said the agency would have to approve the sale of Southern Pacific operations to other railroads. 
In June, the ICC ordered the railroad divestiture because of anti-competitive concerns.
