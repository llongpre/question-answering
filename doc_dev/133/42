   A federal court has canceled a scheduled
Friday hearing on Kansas City Southern Industries' application for
a stay of a recent court order barring its efforts to purchase the
Southern Pacific Railroad.
   KCSI president and chief executive Landon Rowland said he asked
the court to cancel the hearing on the advice of company attorneys,
who said it was ``procedurally not ripe'' to have the hearing now.
   He said the cancellation had nothing to do with Tuesday's
Interstate Commerce Commission approval of Rio Grande Industries
Inc.'s proposal to buy Southern Pacific.
   The ICC in a series of votes Tuesday rejected the Kansas City
Southern proposal, partly due to concern over Kansas City
Southern's financial outlook in light of a $600 million court
judgment against the company.
   In April, a U.S. District Court jury in South Dakota returned a
verdict that Kansas City Southern had violated antitrust laws by
helping block a coal slurry pipeline that would have taken some of
the railroad's business, and awarded the judgment to the state of
South Dakota.
   The verdict is being appealed to the 8th Circuit Court of
Appeals in St. Paul, Minn.
   A federal judge in Sioux Falls, S.D., recently ruled that KCSI
could not buy Southern Pacific Railroad while it is appealing the
judgment.
   ``We think its moot in view of the fact that the order has not
been entered in South Dakota,'' Rowland said of Friday's court
hearing.
   Southern Pacific, part of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., has
15,000 miles of track and is one of the oldest rail lines in the
nation, with track stretching from Oregon to Louisiana.
   Sante Fe Southern reached agreement with Rio Grande Industries
on the sale last February, but when permission for the transaction
was sought from the ICC, Kansas City Southern objected and asked
that it be allowed to buy the railroad.
   Roland said the company's offer to buy Southern Pacific ``is
still on the table,'' and said the company would review all its
options when the full commission decision is released.
