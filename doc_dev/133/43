   Alaska Air Group said it plans to terminate on Oct. 1 the Midwest and East Coast flights of its recently acquired subsidiary, Jet America of Long Beach, Calif. 

   It also completed the previously announced sale to the United Airlines unit of Allegis Corp. of Jet America's gates at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago and National Airport in Washington D.C. Company officials wouldn't disclose the price, but based on recent sales of airport gates Alaska Air is believed to have fetched at least $11 million. 

   Alaska Air paid about $31 million for Jet America in a transaction completed in December. 
J.R. Vingo, the company's chief financial officer, said the sale of some of Jet America's eight jet aircraft is also being evaluated but no decision has been made. 

   Mr. Vingo said that major competitors such as Trans World Airlines and Delta Air Lines were recently allowed to fly routes to the Midwest and other destinations out of Long Beach. 
"The competition from megacarriers eliminated any prospect of Jet America competing in those markets," he said. 

   Jet America will continue to serve the Portland-Seattle market and certain other California and West Coast markets, Mr. Vingo said. 
Alaska Air's other subsidiary, Alaska Airlines, flies routes from Alaska to most West Coast airports and to Phoenix and Tucson. 

   Alaska Air Group had a first-quarter loss of $5.3 million, compared with a loss of $4.8 million in the year-ago period.
