<LEADPARA>  Southern Pacific Railroad may find it easier to clean up 19,500 gallons of
toxic pesticide from the Sacramento River than to get back on the financial
track.;    The San Francisco-based transporter, which employs about 23,000,
has been hurt by the recent economic downturn more than other carriers have.
It suffered a net operating loss on railroad operations of $44 million in 1990
and was the only major carrier to report a loss.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Athough once the largest private landowner in California, Southern Pacific
has sold $1.2 billion worth of property and track rights since Philip F.
Anschutz bought the company for $1.02 billion in 1988, raising operating cash
and reducing the $1.7 billion debt that faced the Denver billionaire.;   
Despite recent losses, Southern Pacific officials remain optimistic about the
future because their real estate sales have offset operating losses of the
last two years and because the loss was less last year than in 1989.;    "What
we're convinced of is, if there hadn't been a recession and Persian Gulf war
and a spike in fuel costs, '91 would have been a profitable year," said
Southern Pacific spokesman Michael Brown. Because of those reasons, though,
the company suffered a "significant" operating loss in the first quarter.;   
Still, the Sacramento River spill on July 14 and the subsequent Ventura County
derailment near Seacliff on July 28 -- when ruptured drums leaked a form of
rocket fuel -- can only exacerbate the company's financial troubles and may be
symptomatic of deeper problems.;    The carrier has had financial troubles for
the last 10 years, said Joel Price, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin and
Jenrette in New York. "With the events of the last two weeks, God only knows
what the effect will be.";    Southern Pacific has not given a cost estimate
for the derailment by the Sacramento River near Dunsmuir because there are
liability questions to settle, Brown said.;    However, the Journal of
Commerce, citing environmental agencies, reported an estimate of more than $25
million.;    Brown would not disclose the details of the carrier's insurance
policy, nor how the company would handle the costs.;    Investigators say that
power surges from a faulty electrical generator in a locomotive may have
caused the Sacramento River derailment, and that a faulty bearing may have
caused an axle to snap in the Seacliff accident.;    Some observers question
whether the company's level of maintenance played a role in the accidents.;   
"I think it (the Seacliff derailment) will raise questions, perhaps wrongfully
so, about whether SP's operations and maintenance are up to par," Michael
Lloyd, a rail analyst with Saloman Brothers in New York, told the Journal of
Commerce.;    Sometimes railroad companies cut down on maintenance in poor
economic years, waiting for a profitable year to spend money fixing assets,
said Anthony Hatch, an analyst with PaineWebber in New York.;    "It used to
happen a lot more" in the 1970s, he said. "There should be some drop in a bad
year, because you're not using as many cars, and you don't break down the
tracks as much. But if you're cutting down more, that's a sign of financial
weakness.";    Brown denied that Southern Pacific had been lax on maintenance,
pointing out that since 1988, $730 million has gone into capital expenditures,
mostly maintenance and safety-related spending.;    "That is not the action of
a company deferring maintenance," he said.;    But federal reviews of Southern
Pacific's operations indicate a high accident rate and a high percentage of
defects in locomotives.;    In June, the Federal Railroad Administration
inspected Southern Pacific locomotives in Nevada, California and Arizona, and
found that 206 out of 248 -- or 83 percent -- had at least one defect.;    And
from 1986 to 1990, Southern Pacific was virtually tied with CSX Transportation
for the highest rate of rail accidents involving hazardous materials, with
1.05 and 1.06 accidents, respectively, per million train miles, according to
the federal agency. In 1990, Southern Pacific was easily the highest, at 1.20,
compared to 1.10 for CSX.;    "It would be fair to say if they invested more
in safety, they would have a better safety record," said Robert Creamer,
spokesman for Citizen Action on Rail Safety.;    After it deals with the
derailment costs, Southern Pacific still has to overcome some business
problems.;    The company's fate depends heavily on shipping automobiles,
lumber and chemicals, all of which are very sensitive to the economy, said
John Hilton, an analyst with Argus Research Corp. in New York.;    Lumber,
which accounted for almost 15 percent of Southern Pacific's freight revenue in
1990, fluctuates because its major use is to build houses, and the housing
market is tied to the economy's health. The automobile market, which accounted
for 9.1 percent of freight revenues, also has been depressed in recent years.;
   Meanwhile, Southern Pacific ships few "cushion" goods that are
recession-resistant, like coal.;    Southern Pacific's 7 percent share of the
overall market is threatened by healthier rail companies.;    "Union Pacific
is really beginning to make big money," Price said. As a result, Union Pacific
will probably invest more in capital improvements to lower costs and become an
even tougher foe.;    The Omaha, Neb.-based transporter -- one of the three
biggest with 21,000 miles of track -- expanded a major coal line running
through Nebraska and installed a large automobile loading facility in Los
Angeles.;    To compete, Price said, "you need resources. If you're running on
a shoestring budget, that's almost conceding defeat.";    Southern Pacific is
not helpless, though. In addition to its real estate assets, it does have
valuable routes stretching along the Pacific coast, from Los Angeles to
Portland, Ore., which "all other things being equal," could form a solid core
for a railroad carrier, Hatch said. "You give me that route in perfect shape,
I'll take it.";  California rail history; (box) 1862 -- President Lincoln
