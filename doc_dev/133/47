   Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., which last week said it wouldn't bid for Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., has increased its stake in the giant railroad, energy and real estate concern. 

   In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Olympia &amp; York, a Toronto-based real estate developer controlled by the Reichmann family, said it increased its holding to 8.2% from 6.9%. 

   The move ensures that Olympia &amp; York is still a force to contend with as Santa Fe tries to steel itself against potential hostile bidders. 
It also steps up pressure on Santa Fe's management at a time when it is trying to beat back a takeover threat from La Jolla, Calif.-based Henley Group Inc. 

   Henley, a diversified manufacturing concern, holds a 14.7% stake in Santa Fe. 
That holding, combined with Olympia &amp; York's latest purchase, puts nearly a fourth of Santa Fe's stock in unfriendly hands. 

   In recent days, Santa Fe's management has taken a variety of steps to repel potential hostile suitors. 

   Henley said last week that it might make a tender offer for the Santa Fe shares it doesn't already own after merger talks with Santa Fe broke down. 
As a countermeasure, Santa Fe said it was "willing to consider certain transactions" that would enable the company to regain control of Henley's Santa Fe stock. 

   People close to Santa Fe said its chairman and chief executive officer, Robert D. Krebs, has been trying to speed up the sale of company assets to raise cash toward that end. 
Mr. Krebs also proposed paying Santa Fe shareholders $4 billion in cash or securities or both, with a twofold purpose in mind: leveraging the company to make it less attractive to potential bidders, and placating other large shareholders in case Henley had to be bought off. 

   Last week, Olympia &amp; York announced that it had decided against making a $63-a-share offer for Chicago-based Santa Fe, but said it might still accumulate Santa Fe stock and remained interested in discussing a company restructuring. 
A $63 cash offer was the price that the Santa Fe board had said it would consider. 

   If Santa Fe decides to buy back Henley's stake at a premium, Olympia &amp; York may also have to be satisfied. 
At the same time, Olympia &amp; York is well-positioned to join forces with Henley at some point if it so desires. 

   In its filing, the company said it had acquired an additional 1,917,800 Santa Fe shares between Dec. 9 and Wednesday at $39.75 to $48.064 each and now controls 12,837,000 Santa Fe shares. 
Olympia &amp; York officials declined to comment further. 

   Santa Fe shares closed at $46.875, down $1.875, in active composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday. 

   Whatever happens in the next few months, it is certain Santa Fe will be changed forever. 

   Under Mr. Krebs's plan, Santa Fe will remain a railroad, natural-resources and real-estate concern, but in a scaled-back form. 
Mr. Krebs has moved already to sell some of Santa Fe's smaller businesses, such as its building-contracting unit, its timber company and the Bankers Leasing &amp; Financial Corp. subsidiary. 
Santa Fe said it expects to receive $680 million pretax for these businesses. 

   Santa Fe is expected to announce as early as today the sale of its Southern Pacific Transportation Co. unit. 
An official familiar with the bidding process said Kansas City, Mo.-based Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. and Rio Grande Western Railroad, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp., were among the top bidders. 

   The official said that Kansas City Southern valued its bid at $1.8 billion and that Rio Grande had offered to match that. 

   Both Henley and Olympia &amp; York are said to be interested mainly in Santa Fe's vast real estate holdings, valued at an estimated $5 billion. 
Many railroad industry analysts believe Henley would proceed to sell the company's assets piecemeal if it succeeds in a takeover. 

   "There are two scenarios I see playing out," said an official close to the company. 
"Santa Fe will either remain an independent transportation, oil and gas and real estate company, albeit a smaller one, or all of the assets will be liquidated." 

   Even if Henley prevails over Santa Fe management, its plans may face obstacles at the Interstate Commerce Commission -- where jockeying against Henley is under way. 

   Santa Fe decided to sell the Southern Pacific after the ICC ordered the company to shed one of its two railroad units, citing anti-competitive concerns. 
Henley has told commissioners informally that if it is successful in acquiring Santa Fe, it will likely sell the more profitable Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, and reorganize the Southern Pacific. 

   An ICC official said commissioners are concerned that Henley would sell the Southern Pacific in pieces, keeping only its valuable real estate. 
Southern Pacific owns vast tracts of land in Southern California, including spectacular coastline potentially attractive for real-estate development. 

   Such a plan "gave people around here acute heartburn," one commission staffer said. 

   Other bidders for the Southern Pacific are reportedly lobbying the commission to use its authority to thwart Henley.
