   The purchase by the Union Pacific Corp., of
the ``Katy'' railroad, a regional line that runs from Nebraska to
the Gulf Coast, has been approved by the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the agency announced today.
   The ICC's approval requires the Union Pacific and the
Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, as the ``Katy'' is formally known,
to grant trackage rights to other railroads inseveral regions where
direct competition otherwise would be reduced.
   The ICC approved the merger Friday, but it was not announced
until today, agency officials said.
   The commission acknowledged that the merger would result in the
elimination of some jobs and abandonment of more than 300 miles of
tracks where the two rail systems run parallel tracks. The
railroads have said about 1,000 jobs would be eliminated.
   The commission concluded, however, that the benefits of the
merger both to the public and to rail shippers outweigh the
negative impact. ``The public benefits will be achieved through
reduced transportation costs ... and improved service for
shippers,'' said Heather Gradison, ICC chairman, in a statement.
   The ICC said about 300 miles of track has been approved for
abandonment, including a 123-mile stretch from Henriette to Durant
in Oklahoma. The railroads have said facilities would be shut down
in St. Louis, Kansas City, Fort Worth and other points along the
route system because of duplication.
   Ackowledging a concern about reduced competition for Midwest
grain shipments, the ICC said the Union Pacific must provide
trackage rights to another railroad between Omaha and Kansas City
to preserve the current level of competition.
   It also required agreements with other rail lines in south Texas
where there were competitive concerns about the shipment of crushed
rock from various Texas points to Houston. An agreement with the
Southern Pacific has alleviated that concern, ICC officials said.
