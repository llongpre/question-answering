   The Interstate Commerce Commission unanimously approved Union Pacific Corp.'s proposed $1.2 billion acquisition of Overnite Transportation Co., the most recent and ambitious effort by a railroad to enter the trucking business. 

   The decision extends the reach of New York-based Union Pacific, whose railroad operations are principally west of the Mississippi River, into the eastern half of the U.S., where Richmond, Va.-based Overnite has concentrated its operations. 
Overnite is the nation's fifth-largest motor carrier of general freight. 

   Union Pacific follows other railroads that have emerged as integrated transportation companies offering a sort of one-stop shopping for shippers. 
In recent years, CSX Corp., a railroad holding concern, has bought the ocean shipping company SeaLand Corp., has launched a truck line and bought a barge company. 
Another railway company, Norfolk Southern Corp., last year bought North American Van Lines, a trucking company. 

   The merger was hailed by Union Pacific Chairman William Cook, who said it will "greatly increase our ability to provide our customers with efficient door-to-door service." 
Mr. Cook added that Union Pacific expects to create a "wide range of new choices in multi-modal transportation services for shippers throughout the country." 

   Some rail analysts expect Union Pacific to offer new transcontinental services by tying Overnite's truck routes in the East with Union Pacific's trains in the West. 

   But other rail experts question whether railroads need to buy truck companies in order to offer such services. 
"The burden of proof is on Union Pacific to prove that there are efficiencies accompanying ownership of a truck line that aren't available through cooperative agreements with a truck line," said Jeffrey Stone, a transportation analyst at Wertheim &amp; Co. 
"It's hard for me to detect any greater synergies." 

   In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Union Pacific closed at $78.625, down 37.5 cents. 

   The merger isn't likely to spur additional purchases of truck lines by railroads, however. 
Last year, a federal appeals court instructed the ICC to apply more-restrictive standards to railroad acquisitions of truck lines, which could chill future mergers of railroads and truck lines. 

   "We tried to give intermodalism a green light, but the court kind of messed it up a little," said one commission staff member. 
Still, he echoed analysts' views that the railroad and trucking companies still could use marketing agreements to offer shippers a wider range of services. 
But he said legislation may be necessary to permit the commission to return to its more lenient standard for approving rail and truck mergers. 
The Union Pacific-Overnite merger was specifically permitted in legislation late last year. 

   Union Pacific agreed to acquire Overnite a year ago for $43.25 a share. 
The shares have been held by Union Pacific in a voting trust pending final ICC approval. 
In giving the transaction the green light, the commission cited "considerable public benefits, including increased efficiencies and additional service options." 

   The acquisition's only opposition came from the United Transportation Union, a Cleveland-based union of 125,000 rail and bus employees. 
"We're fearful that UP may be going into the trucking business rather than concentrating on the railroad business," said Fred Hardin, president of the union. 
He said other big railroad holding companies are trimming their rail holdings by selling off or abandoning thousands of miles of tracks.
