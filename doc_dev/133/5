   The Interstate Commerce Commission is expected today to approve the sale of Southern Pacific Transportation Co. to Rio Grande Industries Inc., closing a five-year controversy over the fate of one of the nation's oldest railroads. 

   The commission, meeting in Washington, D.C., is expected to approve the sale despite strenuous objections from Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., which has offered $1.25 billion in cash and notes for Southern Pacific. 
A commission official said the ICC is concerned about how a court judgment of as much as $600 million against Kansas City Southern in the state of South Dakota will affect that company's financial outlook. 

   Kansas City Southern is appealing that judgment, which stems from antitrust and contract violations involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in South Dakota. 
A Sioux Falls, S.D., federal judge last Friday said he planned to issue an order barring Kansas City Southern from completing any purchase of Southern Pacific until the South Dakota case is resolved. 

   In December, Southern Pacific's parent, Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., agreed to sell the rail unit to Rio Grande, a unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp., for $1.2 billion. 
But the sale couldn't be finalized without the approval of the ICC, which rules on whether such mergers are "in the public interest" and must insure they don't pose anti-competitive problems. 

   Kansas City Southern has tried since then to prevent the sale, arguing that it's willing to invest more money in Southern Pacific than Rio Grande, and would therefore make Southern Pacific a more viable competitor among railroads in the West. 
Kansas City Southern maintains the $600 million judgment it has been ordered to pay in South Dakota would have no effect on its plans for Southern Pacific. 

   Landon Rowland, Kansas City Southern's president and chief executive officer, said a decision in favor of Rio Grande at today's ICC hearing would be "very disappointing." 
He left open the possibility that his company still may try to block the sale in the courts if it fails before the ICC. 

   The fate of the Southern Pacific, which traces its beginnings to the first transcontinental railroad, has been in abeyance since December 1983, when it was acquired by Santa Fe Southern Pacific. 
Santa Fe had hoped to merge Southern Pacific, which is based in San Francisco, with its other rail unit, the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway. 
But after four years of hearings and rehearings, the ICC rejected that proposal and ordered Santa Fe to sell off one of its rail units.
