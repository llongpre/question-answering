   Last week's stunning jury award against Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. threatens to derail the company's pursuit of a Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. railroad unit. 

   The success of that quest was in doubt even before the verdict, largely because Santa Fe already had accepted a competing offer from a unit of Rio Grande Industries. 

   A federal district court jury in Sioux Falls, S.D., awarded South Dakota between $243 million and $611 million for antitrust violations and contract interference related to a coal-slurry pipeline project that, the state argued, Kansas City Southern and unidentified co-conspirator railroads conspired to block. 

   The jury award surprised the company and industry analysts alike, especially since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in the company's favor earlier this year on a minor issue related to the case. 

   "It's a huge, unexpected judgment when most of the signals were in favor of management," said Gary Saunders of Josephthal &amp; Co., New York. 
He added that Kansas City Southern's effort to acquire the Southern Pacific Railroad was "unlikely even prior to this liability. 
Now it's going to be even more difficult to convince the Interstate Commerce Commission and shareholders that the acquisition is in its (Kansas City Southern) best interest. 
It's extremely negative." 

   Yesterday, Kansas City Southern's stock closed at $39.875, down $5.125, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 

   Kansas City Southern is a Kansas City, Mo.-based railroad and data-processing concern. 

   An analyst said the stock was hit heavily by a double whammy -- the South Dakota verdict and the end of speculation that Kansas City Southern was itself a takeover target. 
That speculation ended after New York investor Howard Kaskel, who made a hostile bid for the company, sold his 11.3% interest for $60 a share to Kansas City Southern and Hallmark Corp., the Kansas City, Mo.-based greeting card company. 

   Not all analysts were highly pessimistic about the verdict. 
"It seems like a preposterous (verdict)" said an analyst. 
"On appeal, they (Kansas City Southern) ought to win." 

   If the antitrust verdict is upheld, Kansas City Southern would be faced with paying the $611 million judgment, which mostly represents the triple damages the federal law allows. 
Should the antitrust portion of the verdict be overturned, the company still would have to pay $243 million for contract interference, a violation of state laws. 

   Analysts likened the judgment to the famous Pennzoil Co.-Texaco Inc. case where Texaco was hit with a staggeringly high judgment that forced Texaco into bankruptcy-law proceedings. 
"Where would they ever get the money?" asked Michael D. Smith, an analyst with First Kansas City Securities Inc., Kansas City, Mo. 
He estimates that the low-end $243 million verdict would represent about two-thirds of Kansas City Southern's book value. 

   South Dakota had claimed the Kansas City Southern and the unnamed railroads had a vested interest in keeping the coal slurry -- which would transport coal from Wyoming's Powder River Basin, through South Dakota to customers in the south -- from being built since the pipeline would directly compete with the railroads. 
South Dakota charged Kansas City Southern with instigating costly, time-consuming litigation against the pipeline that eventually resulted in the project being abandoned. 

   Kansas City Southern said it will file for the verdict to be set aside by the court as well as for a new trial. 
And a spokesman said the company probably would appeal the verdict if it's allowed to stand. 
For support, the company pointed to a unanimous Supreme Court decision in February, which invalidated South Dakota's agreement to sell Missouri River water to an entity that was formed to develop the coal-slurry pipeline. 

   But Roger Pellinghuisen, South Dakota's attorney general, said the state is "confident in the strength of the verdict. 
We've been successful on the same issues they've raised and expect to be successful on appeal." 
He said the Supreme Court decided on a minor issue that is irrelevant to the antitrust and contract interference questions. 

   Landon H. Rowland, Kansas City Southern's president and chief executive officer, said the company still intends to file its application for acquiring Southern Pacific as well as its objections to that railroad unit's sale to the railroad unit of Rio Grande Industries, itself a subsidiary of Denver-based Anschutz Corp. 

   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said that as a result of the jury verdict, it's reviewing for possible downgrading the single-A-3 rating on about $63 million in of Kansas City Southern debentures. 
Mr. Rowland said, "I appreciate that they have a job to do, but I think they're premature."
