<TEXT>
   Stockholders of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.
voted to changed the name of the Chicago-based company Tuesday to
Santa Fe Pacific Corp.
   The change was required by the company's sale of the Southern
Pacific Transportation Co. to Rio Grande Industries Inc. last
October.
   The company's common stock will continue to be listed on the New
York, Midwest and Pacific stock exchanges under the trading symbol
SFX.
   In addition to the Santa Fe Railroad, the company has interests
in real estate and energy.
   The company sold Southern Pacific after the Interstate Commerce
Commission disallowed the merger of its railroad unit with the
Santa Fe Railroad. The two railroad holding companies had merged in
1983 but kept the railroad operations separate pending government
action on the merger proposal.
