   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., Kansas City, Mo., reaffirmed that it will continue to pursue its bid to buy a Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. railroad unit, which Rio Grande Industries Inc. agreed last week to acquire for $1.02 billion. 

   Kansas City Southern, a railroad and data-processing concern, claimed its bid for the unit, Southern Pacific Transportation Co., was financially superior to the Rio Grande proposal accepted by Santa Fe. 
In response, Santa Fe said that both bids weren't "significantly different." 
Chicago-based Santa Fe added that it believed the Rio Grande bid best satisfied public and shareholder interests and would expedite the unit's sale. 

   The bid by Rio Grande, the railroad unit of Denver-based Anschutz Corp., benefited from being all cash, Santa Fe said. 
The Rio Grande proposal was also buttressed by a bank commitment, unlike Kansas City Southern's, Santa Fe said. 

   Kansas City Southern said it was "outraged" by what it called Santa Fe's "misrepresentation" of its bid recently. 

   When Santa Fe announced its decision last week, Kansas City Southern stated its intent to continue seeking the unit. 
Yesterday, it said it intends to "pursue the matter vigorously before the Interstate Commerce Commission."
