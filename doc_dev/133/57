   The Interstate Commerce Commission said it approved Union Pacific Corp.'s proposed purchase of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, commonly known as the Katy line. 

   In announcing the decision, the commission said the "public benefits" of the acquisition -- including about $59 million in lower shipping costs -- outweighed any potentially adverse effect on competition. 

   But the commission, responding to concerns about a reduction in competition for Midwest grain shippers, ordered Union Pacific to grant trackage rights to another railroad between Omaha and Kansas City, Mo. 

   The merger will probably result in the closing of a railroad yard in St. Louis, a locomotive shop in Parsons, Kan., and a car shop in Denison, Texas. 
About 1,000 jobs will be eliminated because of the merger, the railroads have estimated. 

   The Union Pacific's two subsidiaries -- Union Pacific Railroad Company and Missouri Pacific Railroad Company -- operate over about 23,000 miles of railroad throughout the West Coast, the Midwest and the Gulf region. 

   Missouri-Kansas-Texas, a unit of Katy Industries Inc., operates a 3,000-mile system that extends through Nebraska, St. Louis, Kansas City and Texas.
