   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s revised plan to create the nation's second-longest railroad still faces opposition from some competitors and regulators. 

   The plan, which was filed last week with the Interstate Commerce Commission, details the concessions the transportation and natural resources giant is willing to grant to four Western railroads. 
The railroads had objected to its plans to merge its two railway units: the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. and Southern Pacific Transportation Co. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific is attempting to use the concessions to convince the ICC to reopen hearings on its three-year struggle to merge the two railroads. 
The ICC blocked the merger last July on grounds that the combined railroads would have monopolized traffic on the Pacific Coast as well as between Southern California and the Gulf Coast. 

   According to the filing, Santa Fe Southern Pacific is agreeing to let the four railroads use hundreds of miles of its track in return for similar rights. 
The arrangements strengthen the four railroads, which may in turn spur their competitors to try to derail the complicated merger plan. 

   Burlington Northern Railroad Co., the nation's largest railroad, said Friday it opposes the revised merger proposal because, among other things, it would grant its biggest Western competitor, Union Pacific Corp., access to the southwestern U.S. 
"At the least, the anti-competitive problems don't go away, and it gives Union Pacific the upper hand in the Southern corridor," said Burlington Northern spokesman Mike Wenninger. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific has reached agreements with the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad Co. and the Texas Mexican Railway Co. 
The company said a final agreement with the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co. is snagged over "narrow, discrete issues" that it suggests could be settled by the ICC or arbitration. 
The agreement would allow the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western to lease track in Utah, California and Oregon. 

   The Justice Department said it is looking at the concessions to determine whether they solve the anti-competitive problems raised by the original combination. 
"We are skeptical," said James R. Weiss, chief of the antitrust division's transportation, energy and agriculture section. 
"Trying to resolve (anti-competitive problems) through these fixes is difficult to do," he said. 
The Transportation Department has supported the merger of the railway units, which would encompass more than 25,000 miles of track from the Mississippi River across the West and Southwest. 

   Kansas City Southern Railway Co. has opposed the revised merger plan because it wants to buy the Southern Pacific system. 
Santa Fe Southern Pacific will have to divest itself of one of the railroad units if the ICC rejection stands. 

   This complicated railroad battle was touched off in 1983 when Santa Fe Industries Inc. merged with Southern Pacific Co. in a $6.4 billion transaction. 
The energy and natural resources operations of the two companies were immediately combined but the railroad units were kept separate pending ICC approval. 
Southern Pacific is managed independently through a trust. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said it has drummed up support to reopen the ICC hearings from, among others, the governors of 12 states and from 1,700 companies that ship goods over the affected railroad lines. 
Interested parties have three weeks from last Thursday to file comments on Santa Fe Southern Pacific's merger petition. 

   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Santa Fe Southern Pacific shares closed at $36.625, up $1.25. 

   The concessions are an about-face for Santa Fe Southern Pacific's chairman, John J. Schmidt. 
Prior to the rejection of the merger proposal by the ICC, he had maintained that any concessions could severely damage the viability of the merger. 
Now the company is saying the concessions improve the merger. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific said Mr. Schmidt wasn't available to comment. 
A company spokesman said the trackage-rights swaps and lease agreements with the four railroads would allow the merged units to take shortcuts and trim maintenance costs, among other things. 
The petition estimates that Santa Fe Southern Pacific would save itself about $295 million annually by merging the units this way. 
Under the old plan, the company thought it would save about $288 million annually.
