MR CHRIS GREEN, managing director of British Rail's InterCity subsidiary, is
to become director of ScotRail next year, and intends to lead a bid by its
management for the franchise to run it under the government's privatisation
scheme.
He will set up a shadow franchise company to run ScotRail for up to a year
before the government puts the franchise up for offer. ScotRail operates all
passenger services in Scotland except for InterCity services.
Mr Green, a former managing director of Network SouthEast, has a high
profile among BR executives and should be in a strong position to gain the
backing of financial institutions for a management bid for the franchise. He
will take over from Mr Cyril Bleasdale, who will retire on April 1, and who
had himself hoped to lead a franchise bid.
Mr Green's appointment was among those of 24 directors designate who were
named yesterday by British Rail to run passenger services until they are
franchised.
The Gatwick line, one of the first due for franchising, has been separated
from the Anglia Region, and Mr Rob Mason, currently the franchising director
on the board, will be its director. ScotRail has also been designated one of
the first parts of British Rail to be franchised.
The Department of Transport stressed yesterday that it was committed to
maintaining train services on the west coast main line to Glasgow after
privatisation. This followed a leaked report from a committee of civil
servants and BR officials which raised the possibility of the operators of
the west coast route ceasing to run trains between Preston and Glasgow
because of aggressive competition from the more modern east coast main line.
The document, disclosed by Mr Brian Wilson MP, a Labour transport spokesman,
said that 'in the longer term' competition from the east coast 'will
certainly cast doubt on the economics of the (Euston-Glasgow) sleeper. It
may cause west coast to review whether they should service the market even
with day trains.'
The department said the route would be franchised as a whole and the
franchisee would not be able to pick the parts on which to operate trains.
Mr Green described the leaked document as 'an academic paper on what would
happen if there were unregulated competition'. He thought the franchisee
would have to operate passenger and sleeper services to Glasgow, for which a
subsidy would be paid.
Mr Green said he would definitely be bidding for the ScotRail franchise as
long as he believed there was a viable business. He acknowledged the
management team might face rival bids from other potential franchisees. The
bus company Stagecoach is believed to be interested in bidding.
British Rail said last night that Mr Green wanted to become 'more closely
involved with delivering train service improvements'.
