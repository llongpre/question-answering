   Stock prices ended the second quarter with sharp losses, as some investors took profits yesterday and others remained on the sidelines. 

   The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 28.38 to 2418.53. 
It was the largest drop in the industrial average since May 19, when it fell more than 37 points. 

   Rather than the end-of-quarter buying that some traders and analysts had expected, sellers dominated the stock market. 
The market opened lower, and traders said the slide accelerated on rumors -- later denied -- of a bombing at the U.S. embassy in Kuwait. 
A U.S. embassy spokesman in Kuwait said there was an accidental explosion at the embassy. 
Traders added that several sell programs tied to strategies using stock-index futures also added to the declines. 

   The dollar was little changed in foreign exchange trading, and bond prices were slightly lower; both had little impact on stock prices. 

   "It didn't take much in the way of a news item or a computerized sell program to knock the market down, and there wasn't enough buying to bring it back up again," said one New York-based equity trader. 

   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lost 3.90 to 304.00, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index sank 1.92 to 171.07. 

   Big Board volume rose to 165.5 million shares from 142.5 million shares Monday. 
There were 995 issues declining and 606 advancing. 

   Absent from the stock market in the past few sessions was any urgency among money managers to invest spare cash in their portfolios before the second quarter ended. 
Michael Metz, a market strategist with Oppenheimer, believes both bulls and bears are probably sitting with cash in their portfolios and can find no compelling reasons to invest right now. 

   He said many of his clients remain very concerned about the budget and trade deficits. 
Many are still worried about inflation, although their worst fears have been dispelled, he said. 

   But for many investors, Mr. Metz believes, high stock valuations are the biggest stumbling blocks to buying more stocks. 
When employing such traditional valuation measures as price-earnings multiples, book values and dividend yields, Mr. Metz said many stocks are at levels that "historically have always been a time to sell." 

   Joseph Feshbach, a technical analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New York, believes the stock market is headed for a slide that could set the Dow Jones Industrial Average back about 100 points during the next two weeks or so. 

   From several indicators that he watches, such as the number of advancing minus declining issues, and volume in gainers versus losers, Mr. Feshbach said it looks as if the stock market is "overbought." 
That means a "sufficient amount of money has already moved in (to the stock market) and there's not enough out there to sustain a market advance for the time being," Mr. Feshbach said . 
"It's run out of fuel near-term," he added. 

   Stock investors paid little attention to a 0.7% rise in the May index of leading economic indicators, following an upward revision in the April index to a 0.2% gain. 
It was originally reported as a 0.6% decline. 

   Despite the downbeat tone in the stock market, three rail stocks and a few other issues were big gainers. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific jumped 3 3/4 to 50 as more than 4.9 million shares were traded. 
The Interstate Commerce Commission won't reconsider its July 1986 rejection of the proposed merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific railroads. 
Santa Fe said it won't appeal the decision and it is considering various options, including the sale of both railroads and the possible sale of several other businesses. 

   As with other recent corporate restructurings, traders said investors assumed the various parts of Santa Fe Southern might be worth more than the whole and quickly went after the stock. 

   Kansas City Southern Industries moved up 1 3/4 to 58 3/4 after saying it would make a formal offer in 60 days to Santa Fe Southern to acquire Southern Pacific Transportation for cash. 

   Burlington Northern gained 5 to 82 3/4 in active trading. 
The company said it was interested in acquiring certain portions of Santa Fe Southern's railroad units that may be divested under the ICC ruling. 

   W. Glenn Cameron, a rail industry analyst with Jessup &amp; Lamont, said if investors assumed that Santa Fe Southern might be worth more split up, the same assumption was being made about Burlington Northern, which owns the world's longest railroad as well as extensive natural resources and valuable real estate. 

   He believes Santa Fe Southern will first sell the Santa Fe railroad and later sell the various parts of the Southern Pacific railroad to other railroad companies. 

   Gains in the rail sector were limited. 
CSX fell 3/8 to 34 7/8, Norfolk Southern fell 1 to 33 and Union Pacific declined 5/8 to 78 3/8. 

   GenCorp rose 7/8 to 103. 
The company announced late Monday that it plans to sell its General Tire unit to Continental AG of West Germany for $650 million. 

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph fell 1/2 to 27 5/8 on more than 3.9 million shares. 
AT&amp;T Chief Financial Officer Robert M. Kavner told industry analysts that second-quarter results are "likely to show an improvement" over the first quarter. 
The stock price had run up in recent weeks in anticipation of such news, so yesterday's announcement came as no surprise, traders said. 

   General Motors lost 1 1/4 to 82 5/8. 
The auto maker will place 3,000 hourly workers on indefinite layoff when it eliminates the second shift at an assembly plant. 
The plant will be closed permanently Dec. 23. 

   Ford fell 1 5/8 to 99 and Chrysler dropped 3/4 to 34 1/8. 

   Compaq Computer advanced 3 3/8 to 46 7/8 on news that it expects second-quarter net income to be nearly three times the year-earlier results. 
Compaq was one of the few gainers in the technology sector. 

   United Technologies rose 1 5/8 to 52 1/4 in active trading. 
The company said several parties were interested in acquiring some of the operations of its Essex subsidiary. 

   General Mills closed unchanged at 55 5/8 after trading as high as 57. 
The food concern said it expects that income from continuing operations in its fourth quarter ended May 25 rose about 10% on a sales increase of about 18%. 

   Contel sank 1 to 31 3/4. 
The company said it anticipates 1987 earnings from continuing operations will be about 15% lower than the $3.04 earned in 1986. 
Contel added that it is reviewing several alternatives to maximize long-term shareholder value. 

   Allegheny International lost 3/8 to 15 1/2. 
Allegheny's chairman said the company will post a loss in 1987 as a result of continuing losses in its industrial businesses and because of costs associated with cutbacks in corporate overhead and plant closings. 

   Owens-Corning Fiberglas fell 3/8 to 23 1/4. 
The company said it will take a $14.3 million charge in the second quarter as a result of termination of a bank credit facility. 
The credit line had been used to finance its $1.6 billion recapitalization, which was completed in November. 

   Pennzoil fell 3 5/8 to 75 1/4 after falling 4 Monday. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission will side with Texaco on a narrow but significant issue involving tender offer rules, part of the $10.3 billion court battle between Texaco and Pennzoil. 
Texaco rose 1 1/8 to 40 1/2 in heavy trading.
