<HEAD>Henley to Sell Santa Fe Shares, Other Holdings to Itel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Henley Group Inc., which earlier
this year abandoned attempts to take over Santa Fe Southern Pacific
Corp., agreed to sell its Santa Fe shares to another rail company,
Itel Corp.
   The complex deal also calls for sale to the Chicago-based Itel
of Henley's holdings in American President Cos. Ltd. and three
other companies and would give Henley a 40 percent stake in Itel.
   The companies valued the total deal at $1.2 billion in cash and
stock.
   Henley, a holding company run by investor Michael Dingman out of
this San Diego-area coastal enclave, said it would receive $827
million cash and 18.7 million shares of Itel stock, giving it a 40
percent share of the transportation, dredging and wiring company.
   Itel would get Henley's 16.9 percent share of Chicago-based
Santa Fe; its 9.6 percent holding in American President, an
Oakland, Calif.,-based container freight company; and its 13.2
percent stake in Oak Industries. Itel also would get Henley's
wholly owned Signal Capital Corp. and Equilease Corp. subsidiaries.
   Henley, which has bought and reshuffled a number of companies in
recent years, would be subject to a 10-year standstill agreement
limiting the way its Itel shares could be voted or sold and
restricting further purchases, Itel said.
   An affiliate of Itel Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Samuel
Zell and director Robert Lurie has agreed to buy warrants for
purchase of Itel stock to keep the men's 20 percent equity share,
the company said.
   The railroad portion of the deal is subject to federal antitrust
review, which Henley said is expected to take 30 days.
   The transaction would allow Itel to combine 30,000 railroad cars
owned by Signal's Pullman Leasing with Itel Rail's 43,000 cars to
make the largest railcar leasing operation in the country, Itel
said.
   On March 18, Henley abandoned plans to wage a proxy fight to
gain seats on Santa Fe's board after an adverse court decision and
said it would consider selling its stock in the railroad company.
   The action ended a six-month battle in which Henley had at
various times sought unsuccessfully to acquire all or part of Santa
Fe and had challenged the rail company's plans to restructure and
sell off assets.
   In announcing the deal, Henley also said it was proceeding with
plans to split its businesses into two companies. After the Itel
deal closes, Henley said, it will file documents with the
Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the split into The
Wheelabrator Group Inc. and The Henley Group Inc.
   Wheelabrator would own Henley's share of Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc. and other assets related to the waste-to-energy
business. The Henley Group Inc. would hold the rest of the
company's assets.
