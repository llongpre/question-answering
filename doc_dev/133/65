   A railroad rate case initiated eight years ago
by a group of Montana farmers may play a pivotal role in the way
the Interstate Commerce Commission determines when certain shippers
are being overcharged.
   The case involves ``captive shippers'' who must rely on a single
railroad for transporting their goods _ in this case wheat and
barley being sent from Montana to shipping points along the
Northwest coast.
   The ICC earlier this month concluded that the Burlington
Northern Railroad had overcharged the farmers and directed that the
railroad make refunds _ as much as $30 million, according to some
estimates _ and use a new method to determine fair rates.
   The Montana ruling, known as the McCarty Farms case after one of
the farmers, is being appealed by the Burlington Northern. It may
not be settled until it goes to the U.S. Supreme Court, say both
railroad and shipping experts familiar with the case.
   But if it stands, the case may spawn a new method of determining
when captive shippers are being overcharged.
   ``The McCarty case is the first attempt to do this in a live
case,'' said Daniel Campbell, the ICC's deputy general counsel.
``If we've done it successfully and it's accepted by the courts it
has implications for other (captive) shippers.''
   In the Montana case, the ICC sought to establish a shorthand
approach to determining whether a shipper is being overcharged by
comparing a railroad's revenue to its operating costs.
   The ICC already has used the same method of determining an
overcharge in a case involving generators being shipped for
Westinghouse Corp., and shipments of sugar, according to ICC
officials.
   But neither the railroads nor groups representing shipping
interests are particularly happy about the methods the ICC
developed in the Montana case.
   ``It sets up a very nasty test for any future shippers,''
suggested Mark Cooper, research director for the Consumer
Federation of America, who has studied railroad ratemaking as it
applies to captive shippers.
   Cooper said he is concerned that in the Montana case the ICC
decided to use average rates when determining whether the Montana
farmers were being charged too much.
   If the same practice is used in other ratemaking cases, shippers
who are being charged exceedingly high rates might be denied relief
because they are lumped in with other shippers whose rates are
lower, suggested Cooper.
   Other critics say the Montana case exemplifies the problems a
shipper faces in challenging railroad rates.
   ``The case is an absolute modern horror story,'' maintains
Robert Szabo, the executive director of the Consumers Union for
Rail Equity. ``It has taken (these farmers) seven years ... and
they spent over a million dollars.''
   Szabo's group, known as CURE, has been battling the railroads
for years on behalf of primarily coal companies and electric
utilities over rates to captive shippers.
   With the Montana case, suggests Szabo, the ICC has tried to head
off continuing criticism in Congress that the ICC has been moving
too slowly to deal with shipper grievances.
   Spokesmen for the Association of American Railroads declined to
comment on the case except to reiterate its position before the ICC
that it opposed using the new procedure to determine maximum rates
and that it did not consider the Burlington Norther rates excessive.
   The Montana case began in 1980 when Richard McCarty, a grain
farmer from near Plentywood, Mont., and a few other farmers filed a
class action suit accusing Burlington Northern of price gouging in
shipping crops to West Coast markets.
   A federal judge referred the case to the ICC where an
administrative law judge ruled in 1981 that the farmers qualified
for relief under the Staggers Act, which deregulated much of the
railroad industry in 1980. The ICC concluded the case Feb. 12.
