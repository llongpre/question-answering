   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. ended its search for a chief executive officer by picking the current No. 2 man at the company to fill the post. 
The move was viewed as an effort to improve stability at the company at a time of internal reorganization and takeover rumors. 

   The diversified railroad company said it named its president and chief operating officer, Robert D. Krebs, 45 years old, chief executive. 
Mr. Krebs will retain the position of president; no successor was named to fill the post of operating chief. 

   Mr. Krebs confronts the task of leading Santa Fe as it faces one of its most difficult periods. 
The company is undergoing a major restructuring after being ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission to sell off at least one of its two railroad units after losing a four-year battle to merge those properties. 

   The company also recently has come under increasing pressure to increase shareholder value from one of its large holders, California-based Henley Group Inc., which said it is considering increasing its stake in the company to as much as 25% from 5%. 
Henley revealed last week that it had twice discussed forming a "business combination" with Santa Fe, but had been rebuffed. 

   A company spokesman said John S. Reed, 69, will remain as Santa Fe's chairman. 
Mr. Reed, who had retired as chairman in 1983 after heading the company for 16 years, was recalled by the Santa Fe board after the ouster of John J. Schmidt as chairman and chief executive in April. 
Mr. Schmidt was largely identified with Santa Fe's failure to win approval for the proposed railroad merger. 

   Since June 30, when the ICC ordered Santa Fe to sell one or both railroads, Mr. Krebs has been responsible for drawing up a divestiture plan. 

   A source close to the commission said Santa Fe is attempting to sell the Southern Pacific, but wants to retain the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe, a railroad dating back to 1869. 

   If so, Mr. Krebs would be presiding over the sale of the company where he began his career. 
He joined the Southern Pacific in 1966 after graduating from Harvard Business School, and from management trainee rose to president of the railroad's diversified holding company, Southern Pacific Co. 
He was once considered the heir apparent to the chief executive's job at Southern Pacific, former associates at Southern Pacific say. 

   When Southern Pacific merged with Santa Fe Industries Inc. in December 1983, Mr. Krebs was one of a handful of ex-Southern Pacific executives who became an officer of the surviving company. 

   "He is intelligent and decisive," a former colleague said of Mr. Krebs. 
"And with John Reed still as chairman, I don't expect radical changes over there." 

   Neither Mr. Reed nor Mr. Krebs could be reached for comment. 
A spokesman for Henley said the company didn't have any immediate comment on Mr. Krebs's appointment. 

   It was unclear how long Mr. Reed will stay on as chairman. 
But one analyst said, "It's been very clear that John Reed wants to go back into retirement . . . 
I think he felt it would be better sooner rather than later to get someone with a lot of energy into that job." 

   Santa Fe has only two months left to report back to the ICC with its divestiture plan. 
In addition, the company has said that it is considering selling several of its other businesses and has already announced a buyer for its Dallas-based construction company. 
In the coming months, Mr. Krebs will also have to find a way of dealing with Henley Group, which many analysts believe will attempt to force Santa Fe to sell both its railroads as well as its valuabe real estate holdings.
