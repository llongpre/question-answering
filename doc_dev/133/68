   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s planned sale of
its Black Mesa Pipeline Inc. subsidiary would complete a nearly
nine-month-old corporate restructuring to pare the railroad and
energy conglomerate's holdings.
   Santa Fe announced Thursday it had agreed to sell Black Mesa to
Williams Technologies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., at undisclosed terms.
   The Santa Fe restructuring announced June 30 was aimed at
reducing the company's holdings to five core businesses in
transportation, real estate and natural resources, said spokesman
Richard Hall.
   Chicago-based Santa Fe has sold or agreed to sell two other
pipeline companies, a building contractor company, a timber
company, a leasing business and the Southern Pacific Transportation
Co., one of its two railroads.
   The company expects to reap $1.7 billion after taxes from the
sale of the businesses.
   The restructuring plan included a $30-a-share payout to
stockholders totaling $4.7 billion.
   Hall said in a telephone interview that the restructuring was
intended to help pay down debt incurred in paying the special
dividend and to improve the company's long-term growth and earning
potential.
   Parts of the plan were bitterly opposed by two of Santa Fe's
largest shareholders, the Henley Group Inc. of La Jolla, Calif.,
and Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. Both companies
failed in attempts to take control of Santa Fe and have apparently
abandoned the efforts.
   The 273-mile Black Mesa pipeline carries coal slurry from a mine
in northeastern Arizona to a power plant in southern Nevada.
   Completion of the restructuring will leave Santa Fe with its
Chicago-based Santa Fe Railway, San Francisco-based Santa Fe
Pacific Realty Corp., Houston-based Santa Fe Energy Co.,
Albuquerque, N.M.-based Santa Fe Pacific Minerals Corp. and Los
Angeles-based Santa Fe Pipelines Inc.
