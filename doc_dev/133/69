   North America's longest rail tunnel, a
nine-mile stretch under Glacier National Park, has opened to link
Canada's coal and mineral-producing hinterland with the West Coast
and the Pacific Rim countries.
   The tunnel was inaugurated Thursday in a ceremony accented by
the sound of bagpipes and attended by rail executives,
industrialists, politicians and some of the 1,100 railway workers
who worked on the $422 million project.
   The new route, completed ahead of schedule and $84 million under
budget, ends the cumbersome practice of adding extra locomotives to
trains that had to negotiate 4,000-foot Rogers Pass and should
increase westbound capacity by as much as 60 per cent, authorities
say.
   Major improvements, including the Mount Macdonald Tunnel,
reduced the steepness so that pushers are no longer needed on the
southeastern British Columbia route.
   ``This is the biggest thing the railway has done since the
building of the transcontinental,'' said Barry Scott, chairman and
chief executive officer of CP Rail.
   CP Rail, a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Ltd., can now run
four-locomotive freight trains from Calgary to Vancouver and,
without the aid of the pusher trains, increase the number of
freights through Rogers Pass daily from 15 to 24.
   ``After nearly 104 years of railroading in these Selkirk
Mountains, we have finally tamed the geography _ or at least as
much as man is ever likely to do,'' said Scott.
   The project involved double-tracking the CP Rail main line
through Rogers Pass. It was the last of four double-tracking and
grade-reduction projects undertaken by the railway in British
Columbia and Alberta.
   Lighter eastbound trains through Rogers Pass will use the old
track and the Connaught Tunnel, which opened in 1916. The new route
also will be used by passenger trains.
   CP Rail officials say the project will have a significant impact
on the ability to move export commodities such as grain, coal,
sulphur and potash to the West Coast and the Pacific Rim.
   ``This was built for the future,'' said Barry Scott, a senior
railway spokesman. ``It's solid advance planning.''
   CP Rail hopes to pay for it over 20 to 30 years depending on
revenues, but will realize savings immediately from the elimination
of about 20 pusher locomotives from service.
