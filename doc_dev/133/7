   The Interstate Commerce Commission approved the $1.02 billion sale of Southern Pacific Railroad to Denver-based Rio Grande Industries Inc., spurning a competing bid from Kansas City Southern Industries Inc. 

   Rio Grande Chairman Philip Anschutz said that company's railroad unit, Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad, will be combined with Southern Pacific and run under the Southern Pacific name. 

   The new rail system, with 15,000 miles of track, will be the fifth largest in the U.S., covering 15 states west of the Mississippi River. 
It will be based in San Francisco, as Southern Pacific is now, and will have a major regional office in Denver. 

   In a 20-minute session, the commission voted 4-0 to approve Rio Grande's application to buy Southern Pacific from Chicago-based Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. and 4-0 to reject Kansas City Southern's. 
Heather Gradison, chairman of the commission, said the transaction would "produce substantial public benefits" without "discernible harms to competition or to essential railroad service." 

   ICC member Paul Lamboley appeared to speak for his colleagues in articulating a major argument against the Kansas City Southern bid: a pending court judgment against that Kansas City, Mo., railroad company of as much as $600 million. 
He said the prospect of the judgment clouds the company's financial outlook and would delay completion of any Kansas City Southern purchase of Southern Pacific. 

   The judgment against Kansas City Southern stems from antitrust and contract violations involving a coal-slurry pipeline project in South Dakota. 
The railroad is appealing the judgment, but a federal judge last week said he would bar Kansas City Southern from completing a purchase of Southern Pacific until the case is resolved. 

   Kansas City Southern's bid for Southern Pacific totaled $1.25 billion in cash and debentures. 
Rio Grande's bid was all cash. 

   Meanwhile, David Berger, an attorney in Philadelphia, is seeking certification from a state court in Wilmington, Del., to press a class-action suit on behalf of Santa Fe Southern shareholders. 
The suit would charge that the company's management breached its fiduciary duties in accepting the lower bid and would seek damages of at least $20 million. 

   Kansas City Southern yesterday criticized the commission's decision to approve its rival's bid, saying, "The biggest loser was the public interest." 
The railroad contended that it planned to spend $4 billion more on Southern Pacific over the next five years than Rio Grande plans to spend. 
Kansas City Southern said its bid for Southern Pacific remains "on the table." 

   The commission vote apparently ends one of the longest-running sagas in the railroad business, over the future of Southern Pacific. 
In late 1983, Santa Fe Industries, which owns Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, bought Southern Pacific Co., owner of Southern Pacific Railroad. 
The parent companies merged their non-rail assets but operated their railroads separately pending ICC approval. 

   Last year, the commission, citing threats to competition, vetoed the rail merger and ordered Santa Fe to sell one of its railroads.
