   A proposed purchase of the regional
Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad by the Union Pacific Corp. has been
tentatively approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission, sources
say.
   The regulatory agency has scheduled an official announcement on
Monday of its decision.
   Agency and congressional sources, speaking on condition they not
be identified, said the commission had voted 4-0 on Friday to
permit the Union Pacific and MKT merger.
   The Union Pacific, a 21,500-mile network, proposed in November
1986 to acquire the 3,100-mile MKT system, known as the Katy line,
for $110 million and to assume its outstanding debts.
   As proposed, the merger would eliminate about 1,100 Katy jobs
because of closing of rail yards and repair shops. Union Pacific
also proposed the abandonment of 405 miles of track, mostly
operated by Katy.
   The Union Pacific, the nation's third largest railroad system in
terms of track mileage, serves about 20 states with routes from Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle in the West to Chicago and New
Orleans.
   The company was formed in 1982 with the merger of the Union
Pacific, Missouri Pacific and Western Pacific railroads.
   The Katy serves six states, with mostly north-south routes
running from Omaha to the Gulf Coast in Texas.
   Dennis Watson, an ICC spokesman, said he had no information on
how commissioners had voted in the case, and could not confirm or
deny that the merger had been approved.
   The sources said retiring commissioner Malcolm Sterrett, who did
not seek reappointment to a new term on the agency, did not vote.
The agency made its decision by a voting system that does not
require a public meeting.
   The railroads say consolidating their operations would provide
shippers with better service at lower costs, and offer direct
single-line routes in some areas. Without the merger, the ICC has
been told, the financially troubled Katy will have difficulty
surviving against bigger competitors.
