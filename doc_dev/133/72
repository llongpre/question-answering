   In what may preface the first major takeover attempt since Monday's market crash, Henley Group Inc. is believed to have accumulated millions of shares of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. stock this week. 

   Both companies declined to comment, but industry officials said La Jolla, Calif.-based Henley has accounted for much of the 19.2 million shares of Santa Fe that have changed hands since Monday -- about 12% of Santa Fe's shares outstanding. 
Chicago-based Santa Fe has interests in railroads, real estate, and energy. 

   Santa Fe stock closed yesterday at $51 a share, up 50 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
With 5.3 million shares traded, the stock was the third most active on the Big Board. 

   Henley quietly held some 7.9 million Santa Fe shares, or about 5% of the company, for nearly a year before the apparent buying spree. 
The engineering and financial services concern first disclosed its holding in March when a slight drop in Santa Fe's shares outstanding boosted Henley over the 5% threshold. 
This summer, Henley sought and was granted permission under federal antitrust law to boost its holding to as much as 24.9%. 

   Santa Fe has been a target of substantial investor interest as it put its railroad unit and other assets on the block. 
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., the Toronto-based real estate company, last month disclosed that it had acquired a 6.2% interest in Santa Fe and that, like Henley, it had received antitrust clearance to increase its holding to 24.9%. 

   In a defensive step, Santa Fe last month announced plans to buy as much as 38% of its stock, with the purchase to be financed by the sale of company assets. 

   With this week's market plunge, that strategy may have come unglued. 
From a record high of $64.875 a share on Oct. 1, Santa Fe's stock price tumbled to close at $41.375 on Monday. 
Since then, the stock climbed to close at $47.625 on Tuesday, and $50.50 on Wednesday. 
Santa Fe is believed not to have been a major buyer of its shares this week because of its plan to fund repurchases through future assets sales. 

   Henley, under its chairman and chief executive officer, Michael Dingman, apparently decided to use the market plunge as an opening to buy. 
Although he has declined to discuss Santa Fe, Mr. Dingman, in general comments about the stock market, told a reporter on Monday that "there are great opportunities in life and this is one of them." 

   Later on Monday, Henley announced that it had at some time begun and then discontinued talks with Santa Fe about the possible purchase of its units Southern Pacific railroad and Bankers Leasing &amp; Financial Corp., as well as other Santa Fe transportation and real estate interests that weren't further identified. 

   The announcement added that Henley was reviewing its investment in Santa Fe and that, depending on various factors, might buy or sell Santa Fe stock. 

   The purpose of Henley's disclosure wasn't clear. 
But analysts speculated that it might have been made for legal reasons prior to further transactions in Santa Fe stock. 

   Santa Fe's principal attraction is its vast real estate holdings, with an estimated value of as much as $5 billion. 
Some of the most valuable real estate is held by the Southern Pacific railroad, which Santa Fe is under regulatory orders to dispose of. 

   Santa Fe acquired the Southern Pacific in 1983 through a merger with its parent. 
Since then, however, the railroad has operated separately from Santa Fe's own railroad, pending regulatory review. 
In a stunning upset to the merger plans, the Interstate Commerce Commission denied approval earlier this year and ordered Santa Fe to sell the railroad with much of its valuable real estate. 

   The Southern Pacific has remained on the block and, by the end of last week, Santa Fe said it received seven bids for it at prices ranging from $750 million to more than $1 billion. 

   Henley, having broken off talks to acquire the subsidiary railroad and other assets, now may have to buy the parent company if it is to acquire the desirable real estate. 
It is possible that Henley then could sell the railroads to separate outsiders -- eliminating the regulatory problem and allowing it to keep the real estate and other assets.
