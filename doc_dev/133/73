   Union Pacific Railroad assumed control Friday
of the Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, railroad officials announced.
   In a news release, Union Pacific said the takeover had been
approved May 18 by the Interstate Commerce Commission.
   Union Pacific reached agreement with Katy Industries in 1986 to
acquire its railroad, more commonly known as the Katy, for
approximately $110 million and assume its $250 million debt.
   Operational changes on the Katy will be phased in to assure a
smooth transition, Union Pacific said.
   Union Pacific said the changes will be made as labor agreements
are reached outlining employee transfers and other details. One
move will be the installation of Union Pacific's Transportation
Control System on Katy routes, bringing Union Pacific's
computerized customer service program to Katy shippers.
   The Katy is a 3,100-mile regional railroad connecting the
Midwest with the Texas Gulf Coast. Union Pacific and Katy have had
several joint operating arrangements to use of each other's tracks.
   Union Pacific serves the West Coast, Texas Gulf Coast and such
major trade cities as Chicago, St. Louis, Memphis, Tenn.; and New
Orleans.
