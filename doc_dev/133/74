<HEAD>Henley Proposes Santa Fe Scrap Part of Restructuring, Sell It More
Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. is
pondering a proposal from Henley Group Inc. to scrap part of the
railroad-energy giant's restructuring and sell $780 million in new
stock to the dissident investor.
   The move, which would boost Henley's stake in Chicago-based
Santa Fe to 34.3 percent from 15.7 percent, was announced Monday
and faced an uncertain reaction from Santa Fe, which has been
fending off Henley's unwanted overtures since mid-1987.
   Santa Fe spokesman Robert Gehrt said the proposal would be taken
up at Santa Fe's regularly scheduled board meeting later today but
would not comment further.
   Henley's proposal called for Santa Fe to stop the planned
payment of $5 per share in high-yield ``junk bonds'' for each of
its 157.3 million shares on March 1. Santa Fe already has made a
$25-per-share cash payout.
   Henley has claimed persistently that the pay-in-kind debentures
would leave shareholders with a large tax liability because of the
way they are structured.
   Instead, Henley proposed that Santa Fe sell Henley $780 million
worth of new stock at $17.50 per share. Proceeds from that deal
would be used to make a onetime $5-per-share cash payout to all
current shareholders.
   The proposed deal would mean 44.6 million new shares for Henley
and would boost Santa Fe's total shares outstanding to 201.9
million. But Henley said the proposal was dependent on Santa Fe's
annulment of a ``poison pill'' takeover defense that would make a
hostile acquisition prohibitely expensive.
   Under the measure, if any hostile suitor exceeds 20 percent
ownership in Santa Fe's stock, other Santa Fe shareholders would be
permitted to buy new stock at half price.
   Henley now owns 24.6 million shares, or 15.7 percent, of Santa
Fe, a railroad, land and natural resources concern that has been
attempting to restructure because of federal regulatory rulings
forcing it to sell one of its two railroads, either the Santa Fe
line or Southern Pacific line.
   Together, those lines constitute the nation's third-larges rail
system extending over of 26,000 miles of main track.
   Henley repeatedly has criticized Santa Fe's adoption of the
``poison pill,'' saying the measure restricted the ability of major
holders to maneuver.
   In another development Monday concerning Santa Fe, Denver-based
Rio Grande Industries Inc. filed an application with the Interstate
Commerce Commission to acquire the Southern Pacific line for $1
billion.
   The ICC already has approved an expedited schedule for the
application, with a final decision expected in six months, Rio
Grande said.
   Rio Grande's action threw into question Kansas City Southern
Industries Inc.'s rival bid of more than $1.25 billion for the
Southern Pacific.
