   A federal jury Friday ordered Santa Fe
Southern Pacific Corp. and one of its units to pay $345 million to a
pipeline joint venture after ruling earlier that they conspired to
delay the venture's construction of a coal slurry pipeline.
   The amount will be tripled automatically to $1.035 billion if the
judge upholds the jury's award and issues it as a final judgment.
Santa Fe is expected to appeal.
   The planned 1,800-mile, underground coal slurry pipeline would
have extended from Wyoming to Texas and Oklahoma and was abandoned
in July 1984 after a series of delays the pipeline venture alleged
were caused by a group of railroads.
   The pipeline venture, known as Energy Transportation Systems
Inc., filed a 1984 suit against Burlington Northern Railroad Co.,
Union Pacific Railroad Co., Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., Kansas
City Southern Railway Co., and Chicago and North Western
Transportation Co. Santa Fe was added to the suit a few months later.
   All the railroads except Santa Fe had settled out of court for
$285 million.
   The members of the pipeline venture were Texas Eastern Corp.;
Bechtel Petroleum Inc., a subsidiary of the construction giant;
InterNorth Inc., now Houston-based Enron Corp.; and K-N Energy Co.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Parker had given the jury a directed
verdict determining that Santa Fe Southern Pacific and its Santa Fe
Railway Co. unit had participated in an illegal conspiracy.
   After deducting the total of $285 million already paid by the
other defendants, the net amount of the recovery against the Santa
Fe will be $750 million, assuming the jury's award is tripled, Texas
Eastern spokesman Fred Wichlep said.
   ``SFSP and Santa Fe Railway continue to believe that they did not
cause the failure of the proposed ETSA coal slurry pipeline and that
the award of damages is not justified,'' a statement by Santa Fe
said. ``The company believes there are significant issues on which
to base post-trial motions to set aside the verdict. The company
also believes there are significant issues on which to base an
appeal and intends to appeal the verdict.''
   Lawyers for the pipeline contended the project, if completed,
would have had a net cash flow of about $11 billion over 35 years.
   The railroads were accused of delaying the project by using
complex legal procedures before federal and state regulatory
agencies, organizing farm and environmental groups in opposition and
not granting rights-of-way through railroad property.
   ETSI attorneys said the delays occurred during a period of high
inflation and increased the cost of the project from $689 million in
1974 to $3.5 billion in 1984.
   Judge Parker ruled Monday that there was ``an agreement or
conspiracy to delay, hinder or stop'' the project and Santa Fe
knowingly took part in the agreement.
   Santa Fe attorney Fred Furth argued the pipeline project was a
sham and Bechtel profited from the project by taking money for the
engineering but would not take the risks needed to get the project
off the drawing board.
   He also contended that project was destined to fail without the
railroads because companies could not secure customers, financing
and a ruling on whether the pipeline fell under Interstate Commerce
Commission regulations.
