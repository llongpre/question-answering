   Burlington Northern Inc. said it signed an agreement with
the United Transportation Union that will cut the size of
train crews on the southern two-thirds of its railroad.
   The agreement, which was approved by the union's
membership Wednesday, is the first negotiated train crew
reductions since a congressionally appointed special board
made final recommendations on rail labor issues over the
summer.

   Transportation industry analysts say the recommendations,
once implemented throughout the industry, would eliminate
most of the remaining work-rule restrictions, reduce railroad
labor costs by more than $1 billion a year, and make rails
more competitive with trucks.
   James Dagnon, senior vice president, human resources, of
the Fort Worth, Texas, transportation company, said the
agreement could lead to the elimination of 1,650 of the 5,000
UTU employees in the southern part of the railroad. The
southern tier extends south from the Denver area to the Texas
Gulf Coast and east to a number of Midwest cities and
contains much of the company's coal and grain traffic.
   However, Mr. Dagnon said Burlington Northern expects to
invoke arbitration to settle crew size issues on the northern
part of its railroad, which extends from Seattle to
Minneapolis and has been marked by larger crew sizes and more
confrontational relations between management and labor.
   The special board had urged railroads and the UTU to do
their best to negotiate crew size agreements voluntarily, but
allowed the parties to invoke arbitration after Thursday to
settle disputes.
   Burlington Northern said it expects to implement the
agreement on its southern lines within 30 days. Upon
implementation, the railroad will be able to operate most of
its trains on the southern two-thirds of its rail system with
two crew members. Currently, most of its trains operate with
three or four employees.
   The company will pay a $1,000 signing bonus to each UTU
member affected by the agreement and will offer one-time
separation payments of $60,000 to surplus train crew members
who decide to leave the company. Surplus train crew members
who elect to stay with the railroad would be put on a reserve
board that entitles them to full health and welfare benefits
and 75% of their pay.
   Other railroads, including the rail units of Norfolk
Southern Corp., Norfolk, Va., and Union Pacific Corp.,
Bethlehem, Pa., said they are continuing to negotiate with
the UTU over crew size reductions but plan to invoke
arbitration if they haven't reached agreements by week's end.
   "Hopefully, they will remove forevermore one of the
ongoing thorns in the sides of rail management and labor,"
said William Rennicke, vice president of Temple, Barker &amp;
Sloane, a management consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. "And
hopefully, they will address the mutual competitive threat,
which is the motor carrier."
