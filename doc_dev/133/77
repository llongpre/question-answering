   Henley Group Inc. offered to buy $780 million of new Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp. stock at $17.50 cents a share in an unsolicited proposal apparently designed to put pressure on Santa Fe. 

   Henley, a La Jolla, Calif.-based manufacturing, engineering and financial services concern that holds a 15.7% stake in Santa Fe, proposed the purchase as an alternative to Santa Fe's planned payment of about $780 million in senior subordinated debt to shareholders. 

   If accepted, the purchase would give Henley about a 34% stake in Santa Fe. 

   Robert D. Krebs, Santa Fe's president and chief executive officer, said Santa Fe's board will consider Henley's proposal at a meeting today. 
He declined to comment further. 

   Santa Fe stock rose late yesterday following disclosure of Henley's letter, closing at $22.875 a share, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Henley stock rose 12.5 cents to close at $22.125 a share in national over-the-counter trading. 

   Henley's plan -- proposed yesterday in a letter from Henley's chairman and chief executive officer, Michael D. Dingman, to the Santa Fe board -- calls for Santa Fe to cancel payment of its senior subordinated debentures to shareholders and instead use the $780 million raised from the sale of stock to Henley to pay a $5-a-share cash dividend. 
Santa Fe currently plans to pay the special securities dividend on March 1 to stock of record Feb. 5. 
Henley said it is making the offer at $17.50 a share because the new stock wouldn't qualify for the $5 dividend. 

   Henley's offer is contingent on Santa Fe's removal of a shareholder rights defense, which currently would be triggered if a holder or group of holders accumulated more than 20% of Santa Fe's stock without board approval. 

   Analysts noted that Henley's offer appeared designed to maximize pressure on Santa Fe, which for many months has been resisting Henley's efforts to acquire it. 

   Santa Fe directors, which are scheduled to meet today and tomorrow, are expected to consider whether the company will urge acceptance of a $245 million tender offer by Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. for as many as 14 million existing Santa Fe shares at $17.50 each. 
That purchase would boost the Toronto-based real estate and natural resource company's stake in Santa Fe to 19.9% from 10.5%. 
A representative of Olympia &amp; York declined to comment on Henley's plan. 

   Santa Fe late last month signed what appeared to be separate peace with Olympia &amp; York in which Santa Fe agreed to name as directors two officials of the closely held Canadian company, Paul Reichmann, a senior vice president of Olympia &amp; York, and Marshall A. Cohen, president of Olympia &amp; York Enterprises Corp., a unit. 
Olympia &amp; York undertook to support Santa Fe management in a proxy contest at Santa Fe's annual meeting, scheduled for May 24. 

   Santa Fe officials, however, have said since in court that they don't consider the pact with Olympia &amp; York to be legally binding on the Canadian concern. 

   Santa Fe's board meeting will be the first attended by Messrs. 
Reichmann and Cohen, who could urge Santa Fe to accept Henley's proposal with the priviso that Olympia &amp; York also is permitted to boost its stake. 

   Analysts said Henley's latest move may gain the California company support among Santa Fe shareholders. 
"By posing this type of option, Henley is trying to highlight the fact that the debentures have a toxic element that perhaps isn't in the best interest of Santa Fe shareholders," said Laurence Lytton, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 

   Moreover, Henley's move seems designed to reinforce a lawsuit launched in Delaware state court. 
That suit seeks a court order barring Santa Fe's issue of the subordinated debenture dividend on grounds that the debentures' tough debt restrictions will encumber Santa Fe for years to come and serve only to entrench the company's current management. 

   By offering a cash alternative to the debentures, Henley may be attempting to persuade the court that Santa Fe's design in issuing the securities is indeed for purposes of management perpetuation, rather than for financial purposes. 

   Separately, Rio Grande Industries Inc. said it filed a formal application with the Interstate Commerce Commission to merge its Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western railroad unit with Santa Fe's Southern Pacific Transportation Co. Denver-based Rio Grande, a unit of Anschutz Corp., also disclosed that it will sell a 25% position in the holding company of the merged railroads to Morgan Stanley Leverage Equity Fund II, a limited partnership and affiliate of Morgan Stanley Group Inc., after completing the acquisition.
