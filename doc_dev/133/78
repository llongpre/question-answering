railways branching into new markets

MENTION Canadian Pacific, and Canadians and foreigners alike are apt to
conjure up an image of a coast-to-coast railway snaking through the Rocky
Mountains and striking out across the prairies.
That image is rapidly being overtaken by a less romantic reality. Canada's
two railway companies, Canadian Pacific and the government-owned Canadian
National, are paying less attention to the thinly populated Rockies and
prairies, in favour of more profitable business to the south in the US and
Mexico.
'With globalisation and free trade, we're seeing the business opportunities
being much more north-south traffic flows within the continent, as opposed
to east-west,' says Mr John Guppy, CN's senior vice-president for marketing.
CN recognised the trend last year by combining its Canadian and US
operations under a single corporate umbrella, known as CN North America.
The Canadian railways' growing north-south focus is a response to the
emergence of an integrated North American market as customs duties are
eliminated and other trade barriers fall under the 1989 US-Canada free trade
pact. Rail traffic between Canada and Mexico, though still small, is also
growing rapidly as business seeks to capitalise on the North American free
trade agreement, due to take effect on January 1.
The southbound expansion by the Canadian railways is also explained by
rising competition from US railways and road transport. US west coast ports
and transport companies have already garnered more than two-thirds of the
container traffic from the Far East to Toronto and Montreal.
Mr Gil Mackie, CP's executive vice-president, says the Canadians suffer from
a lack of traffic density, which is where US railways have an important
advantage through their cost structures. He adds: 'If we're going to get the
level of efficiency we need, we need to expand our businesses.'
The top priority for both CP and CN has been to secure their access from
eastern and western Canada to Chicago, the hub of surface transport in North
America. CN cemented a western link last year by allying with Burlington
Northern, the aggressive US railway company which runs a line from CN's
railhead at Duluth, on the western tip of Lake Superior, to Chicago. Under
the agreement, CN can run its own trains on BN's track, with only a crew
change at Duluth.
In the east, CN's trump card is a proposed CDollars 200m (Pounds 99m)
cross-border tunnel between the US and Canada, under the St Clair River
north of Detroit. The tunnel, due to be opened late next year, is to
accommodate the double-stack container trains which have become one of the
railways' most potent weapons in their drive to bring down costs. The tunnel
is expected to lop 12 hours off the train-and-barge journey from Toronto to
Chicago.
CP has taken a slightly different approach. Besides numerous alliances with
US carriers, it has bought two US railways: the Soo Line in the mid-west and
the Delaware and Hudson in the north-east.
These acquisitions have helped to propel CP into the domestic US market. Mr
Mackie says that aspect was an afterthought, but 'the more experience we
get, the more we understand it and recognise the potential. I think we'll
see more and more of our operations within the US.'
The opportunities in a wider North American market are matched, however, by
the threat from powerful, low-cost US railroads and road transporters within
Canada.
Under the 1987 National Transportation Act, Canadian shippers can ask a
government agency to impose a freight rate for a carrier competing with CP
or CN. The Canadian railway is left to haul the goods to the nearest
connecting point with the US carrier - just the type of short-haul business
which CP and CN are trying to leave.
The Canadian carriers are working on three fronts to overcome their
handicaps.
First, they are lobbying governments in Canada and the US to drop rules
which put them at a disadvantage against their cross-border rivals. Canada's
high taxes on locomotive fuel and property are one sore point.
CN and CP estimate that their tax bill is the equivalent of about Dollars
200m a year higher than it would be if they were based in the US.
Furthermore, US railways can write off their investments almost twice as
quickly.
Second, the Canadian companies are pulling out the stops to bring down
costs. Their efforts range from the closure of loss-making lines in Canada
to greater emphasis on double-stack container trains. One short line has
already been bought by a US company, Railtex, which specialises in restoring
this type of operation to profitability.
Third, CN and CP are building their North American business on the old adage
that, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. Beside their alliances with US
railways - such as Burlington Northern, Conrail and CSX - the Canadian
companies are forging links with road rivals on both sides of the border.
These alliances reflect the explosive growth in the past three years of
'inter-modal' shipments, involving the use of both road and rail. The goal
is for railways to focus on profitable, long-distance routes while trucks
act as short-haul feeders.
CN and CP are banking heavily on their 'piggy-back' trains, which carry
trailers equipped with both truck tyres and train wheels. According to Mr
Mackie, CP's piggy-back traffic has reached a new record every month this
year.
