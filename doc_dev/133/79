   NEW YORK -- Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. downgraded ratings on
the equipment financing of six railroads, but it said the
move did not reflect a change in the evaluation of the
companies' overall credit risk.
   The rating of the rail equipment trust certificates of
Santa Fe Pacific Corp.'s Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway
Co. unit was lowered to single-A-minus from single-A.
Meanwhile, the ratings on certificates of CNW Corp.'s Chicago
&amp; North Western Transportation Co. unit and Illinois Central
Corp.'s Illinois Central Railroad Co. unit were lowered to to
triple-B-minus from single-A.

   S&amp;P also downgraded ratings on the certificates of three
railroads owned by Rio Grande Industries Inc., a unit of
Anschutz Corp: Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Co.,
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. and St. Louis
Southwestern Railway Co. were reduced to triple-B-minus from
single-A.
   S&amp;P said it lowered the ratings on the certificates
because railroads might be less reliable about repayment
should they go into bankruptcy-court proceedings.
   Railroads historically have continued to make payments on
such certificates, even if they have filed for Chapter 11
reorganization, because creditors could seize equipment that
serves as the collateral for the loans. But S&amp;P said changing
economic and regulatory conditions make it more likely that
railroads in reorganization proceedings would reject
certificate holders or attempt to renegotiate the
certificates' terms.
   A spokesman for Rio Grande said that while the downgrades
will increase borrowing costs, the debt is still investment
grade. He also reiterated S&amp;P's opinion that the lower
ratings reflect industrywide conditions and that the
railroads Rio Grande owns are otherwise financially sound.
   Officials of the other railroads couldn't immediately be
reached for comment.
