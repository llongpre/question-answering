In "Eureka," his jubilant essay on living in Los Angeles, John Gregory Dunne 
pointed out, not without a certain handsome relish, that people in Los Angeles 
no longer cared all that much about what was going on back East. Not only had 
their inferiority complex vanished entirely, but so, becomingly, had their 
hostility. Whatever people in New York might choose to suppose, no one in Los 
Angeles took seriously the idea, which, in any case, might as well have come 
straight out of a B-Western, that America wasn't big enough for both cities to 
coexist in, much less that California's own success required as its vindictive 
corollary the economic or cultural collapse of the Boston-to-Washington 
corridor. "There it was," Dunne wrote, "the canker, the painful sore of 
reciprocity: Los Angeles was indifferent to New York."

Dunne was writing in 1978, when it already seemed safe to assume, in California 
any way, that all that tired oppositional thinking would soon be put to rest. 
The East Coast and the West Coast had never been two states of consciousness in 
the first place, but rather, as if that weren't enough, two very different 
areas of the country with all the distinctions as well, of course, as the 
commonalities, that places 3,000 miles apart with different histories and 
different economic interests can be expected to have. Unfortunately, it seems 
that old cliches, like old resentments, die hard. 
</P>

In "East Coast/West Coast," Patrick Douglas, a free-lance writer from South 
Carolina, now transplanted to San Francisco, has given them their fullest and 
most tendentious airing since Woody Allen indulged his New York prejudices on 
the subject in all their venomous ignorance in his fim, "Annie Hall." Douglas, 
of course, comes down firmly on the side of California in this pointless 
contest, but in his vulgarity and simple-mindedness he very much resembles 
Allen or any of the countless New York pseudo-wits who have had so much fun 
trashing California. 
</P>
<P>
In Douglas' recapitulation, the East Coast is home of rationality, elitism, and 
old-fashioned Eurocentrism. "Being older," Douglas writes in his breathy, 
portentious way, "the East Coast shares Europe's sense of history, of human 
frailty and human folly." In contrast, Californians are -- predictably, since 
the stereotype hasn't changed since at least the nineteen-twenties -- imbued 
with a receptiveness to the new, a belief in the boundlessness of possibility 
and the inherent benignity of change, and an affinity for the intuitive and for 
the mystical. It is surely no accident that Douglas locates the center of this 
new way of thinking in the northern rather than the southern part of the state, 
for his is a view of California that might conceivably make sense at an Esalen 
weekend but has little to do with a morning on the floor of the Pacific Stock 
Exchange, let alone on any sweatshop floor along Los Angeles Street in the 
garment center.

Even Douglas' description of life in California is peculiar in the extreme. At 
one point, he contrasts life on the East and West Coasts and observes that West 
Coast residents are "like a leisure class that, free from the business of 
earning a living, is inclined to wonder what it all means." Elsewhere, Douglas 
asserts that on the East Coast, "a person's life is often largely predetermined 
-- by social class, education, custom and so on. On the West Coast, there are 
few such constraints. How should a person spend his life? is a question that 
inevitably arises." Tell that to a high school kid in Compton, or, for that 
matter, a clerical worker in the Valley. Douglas is so infatuated with his 
generalizations that he never pauses to ask himself whether they apply or not 
to real Californians as well as to the idea of California that he entertains so 
mechanically. 
</P>
<P>
The problem with an essentially metaphoric description of reality of the type 
that Douglas offers is that it so easily drives thinking into abstraction and 
pointless speculation. Had Douglas been content to look at the degree to which 
California's coming of age is changing American politics and American culture, 
he might have written a useful if scarcely an original book. After all, that 
theme has been treated well by a number of recent books, notably Joel Kotkin 
and Yoriko Kishimoto's "The Third Century," as well as regularly in such 
important magazines as the Los Angeles-based New Perspectives Quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas is after bigger game. He genuinely believes that California represents 
a new stage of human consciousness, and, imprisoned in his metaphor, he goes so 
far as to argue that the difference between the East and West Coasts is 
analogous to the right brain/left brain dichotomy in neurology. Here, "East 
Coast/West Coast" goes off the rails entirely, but even before Douglas has run 
his book aground on the shoals of parapsychology, it is clear that he is more 
interested in what might be true, or what he would like to be true, than in 
what he can describe. 
</P>
<P>
California deserves better. There is a real transformation of American culture 
going on all around us; and if Los Angeles has not necessarily supplanted New 
York, it has become one of the great capital cities of our increasingly 
polycentric world. Those are the questions that are worth pondering. That is 
the California that needs to be confronted by writers and thinkers. What we do 
not need is the kind of potted history and mystical gobbledygook so perfectly 
exemplified by "East Coast/West Coast."
