<LEADPARA>  A MAN I KNOW, A STANFORD grad loyal and true, kept his watch on Pacific time
all the while he was at Harvard Law School. He did it to remind himself where
he really wanted to be. A more perverse drudge might do it to gloat over his
three-hour lead over fellow grinds on the West Coast.;    The East Coast never
relinquishes that lead, so those obsessed with being the first one to work
each morning must move there. The rest of the country just learns to play
catch-up. The New York Stock Exchange opens at 9:30 a.m. Eastern, 6:30 a.m.
Pacific. This is why those nice young men and women in chalk-stripe suits
stumble off to work before daylight.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Anyone with business on the East Coast is in a bind. By the time you're in
and settled it's lunchtime in New York. You don't dare try to reach anyone
right after lunch. (Those people are known to drink!) Then it's off for your
lunch and suddenly a full day's business is done between 1 and 2 p.m.;   
Traveling east from the West on business is disorienting (though only whiners
call it "jet lag"). The power breakfast feels like the dawn of the morning
after, maybe because your body thinks it's 4:30 a.m. For the Easterner
traveling west, the 7:30 a.m. meet feels like brunch. Westerners, do your
dealing at dinner, which is always to your advantage.;    TV schedules are
planned for the East Coast, but they work best in the West. Pro football is on
here every Sunday from around 10 a.m. to around 4 p.m., leaving a little
post-game daylight. In Pittsburgh, it starts at 1 and is still going strong at
7 p.m. Monday Night Football seems perfect starting at 6 p.m. How do people on
the East Coast survive a game that starts at 9 p.m. and goes until early the
next morning?;    Baseball fares worse. The primo games are at 8 p.m. Eastern,
so a West Coast game starts at 5 p.m., the worst time of all to play. Shadows
cover only part of the field, and the hanging sun makes line drives an
adventure. On the other hand, late afternoon sun is about the best light that
California has to offer, and when you bathe a baseball game in it, magic's in
the air.;    For the networks, news is what happens in the Eastern Time Zone.
The East has voted and been sampled, the winner declared and victory analyzed
while your basic California voter is mulling whether to vote straight
Vegetarian and which of the 18 insurance reform initiatives speaks to him.
Network presidents, faced with the prospect of restrictions on exit polling
until after Pacific Coast polls close, recommend that the polls be open 24
hours -- 8 p.m. Monday to 8 p.m. Tuesday in the East, 7 p.m. Monday to 7 p.m.
Tuesday in the Midwest, 5 p.m. Monday to 5 p.m. Tuesday in the West. This
would be handy for network presidents, who would have to testify before
Congress less often, but not for many other people.;    But on the West Coast
you can really feel like the news is wrapped up. The afternoon stock final
really has final stocks. The morning paper has all the baseball scores. When
it's the end of the day on the Pacific Coast, it's the end of the day for the
country. Our newscasters wrap up the world, our commentators get the last
arched eyebrow. West of here there's nothing but Alaska, Hawaii, Samoa and
tomorrow.  </TEXT>
