<TEXT>     Late Tuesday night, CalTrain workers said they had achieved a fragile
agreement with striking freight workers that would allow commuter rail workers
to stay on the job.;    "The dispute is between the railway unions and the
freight railroad corporation," said Ed Adams, president of the United
Transportation Union Local 1732 in San Jose. "The CalTrain commuter passengers
are just innocent bystanders. Our intent is not to drag them into our
dispute.";    However, Adams said commuter workers would not cross picket
lines set up by freight train workers. He also said it was unclear how
Southern Pacific, which owns the rails on which the CalTrain service operates,
would respond to the strike.;    "We don't know if Southern Pacific will lock
us out or refuse to let us operate the trains," he said, "or if they'll
provide the minimum dispatching service necessary to keep the commutes
running." Last-ditch contract talks between freight railroads and unions
representing 235,000 workers broke off Tuesday evening in Washington,
prompting the unions to call for picket lines to be set up around the country
at 7 a.m. today local time.;    "I assume there was just no reason to go on,"
Jim Reiter, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, said about
three hours before a federally imposed "cooling off" period was set to
expire.;    The unions have said they have no quarrel with the Amtrak
passenger service or local commuter lines; no Amtrak service disruptions were
expected on the East Coast.;    But there are places where Amtrak or local
commuter lines, such as CalTrain, use tracks owned by freight lines, and a
nationwide strike could halt that traffic.;    Several passengers said Tuesday
that they dreaded the prospect of joining bumper-to-bumper traffic on the
freeways today.;    "I rely on the train. I like the train," said Ron Ruiz,
46, as he waited at the San Jose depot for a train to take him to his San
Francisco job as a shoe salesman. "I get there in a little over an hour, and I
read the newspaper instead of fighting traffic.";    Ruiz said he would drive
to work if the trains shut down, but it would be more expensive. "It costs $80
a month for a (rail) pass, and you can't drive back and forth many days for
$80. And when you get there, there's parking. Six bucks a day is the
cheapest.";    The trains are owned by the California Department of
Transportation, but run on rails owned by the Southern Pacific Railroad, one
of the negotiating carriers. The conductors, engineers and ticket sellers on
those commuter lines are members of one of the bargaining unions.;    An
Amtrak spokeswoman, Sue Martin, said the Los Angeles-to-San Diego route -- the
nation's second busiest passenger traffic corridor after the Northeast --
could be affected.;    Even as the talks broke off, unions said they were
willing to try to avoid a strike.;    "The unions, at this point, while we
recognize that there are still a great many problems to resolve, the door is
open to try to engage in meaningful negotiations," said Ed Wytkind, a
spokesman for the unions.;    11th-hour attempt;  Dan Lang, another industry
spokesman, said the carriers made an 11th-hour attempt to settle by offering a
new proposal. He offered no specifics, but said, "Obviously, it came to
naught.";    Wytkind said he was unaware of any substantive new proposal.;   
Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Bush administration was
prepared to work with Congress on speedy legislation "to impose a settlement
and end the strike.";    Congressional leaders had refused to enact
legislation to stop a strike before it started, but Tuesday, meeting behind
closed doors, they said that if a walkout occurred, they would hurry to pass
legislation to resolve the dispute.;    "My feeling is that, given the nature
of the economy, it is important to act in a timely fashion," said Sen. Edward
Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate Education and Labor Committee.;   
Morning hearing scheduled;  A House panel had already scheduled a hearing for
early today, with representatives of labor and management), as well as
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, set to testify on the impasse.;    At
issue is a 3-year-old dispute over wages, work rules and health care costs.;  
 Unions contend the railroads have not offered high enough pay increases to
make up for wage freezes of the past. Management argues that railroad workers'
salaries are already higher than those paid to most other industrial
employees.; WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO YOU; Here are some of the expected effects
of a strike by 235,000 freight-line workers:; (box) Car and truck assembly
plants could begin shutting down by week's end. That would cause a rippling
effect through component and supplier plants, all within a week, and add up to
widespread layoffs. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association says 70 to 80
percent of motor-vehicle manufacturing facilities would be affected in the
first 24 hours of a strike.; (box) Coal deliveries will be disrupted. Coal is
the largest single commodity carried by the rail industry. Nationwide,
railroads deliver about 57 percent of the coal sent to domestic customers.;
(box) Delays could occur in United Parcel Service deliveries. The company uses
freight trains to transport 30 percent of the 11 million packages it delivers
each day.; (box) About 234,000 daily rail commuters in the Bay Area, Southern
California, Chicago and Maryland will have to find other ways to get around.;
HOW YOU CAN GET AROUND IT; CalTrain officials urged the 11,000 people who ride
its trains daily to seek other public transit in case of a stoppage. Pass
holders will be reimbursed for any days the trains don't run. For more
information on service disruption, call (800) 558-8661.; (box) SamTrans: San
Mateo County is adding buses to several local routes and urging passengers to
use its nine express routes, which leave from Palo Alto, Redwood City, San
Carlos, San Mateo and Foster City. Commuters with monthly CalTrain passes will
get a 60-cent discount. For route information, call (800) 660-4287.; (box)
Santa Clara County Transit: South Bay buses -- specifically, Route 22, will
take commuters to the Menlo Park CalTrain station, where they can catch
SamTrans's Bus 5L or 7F. But be warned -- Bus 22 makes lots of stops, and
Santa Clara County transit officials say they aren't planning to add buses
during the strike. There's no discount for train pass holders. For route
information, call (408) 287-4210.;    (box) BART: Bay Area Rapid Transit plans
to add extra trains and to set up ticket tables at the Daly City and Fremont
stations to accommodate the crush. Because parking will be at a premium,
officials are urging riders to take public transportation to the stations or
have someone drop them off. Santa Clara County Transit Bus 180 runs from the
San Jose CalTrain station to the Fremont BART station. Call (415) 465-BART for
information.; TICKET TO RIDE; Who carried the freight in 1989; ...; Airlines
