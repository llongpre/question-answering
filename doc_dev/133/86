   Eleventh-hour negotiations averted a shutdown of
Chicago, Missouri and Western Railway Co. and put the bankrupt
company's sale back on track, CM&amp;W's trustee said Wednesday.
   Under an agreement given tentative approval Tuesday by U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge John Schwartz, Rio Grande Industries Inc. _ parent
of Southern Pacific Railroad _ will purchase CM&amp;W's north-south
line for $21.5 million, said Daniel Murray, court-appointed trustee
for the failed railroad company.
   Schwartz was expected to give the deal final approval next
Tuesday, Murray said.
   Without the agreement, CM&amp;W's cash collateral would have been
forfeited to creditors and the railroad would have been shut down
at midnight Wednesday, the trustee said.
   Rio Grande also will pay $1 million in start-up expenses and
assume responsibility for $11 million in loans the state of
Illinois made last year to keep struggling CM&amp;W afloat.
   The state, meanwhile, has agreed to reduce interest rates on the
existing loans and extend their payoff periods, as well as to
forgive another $2.5 million loan by changing it to a grant,
officials said.
   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan said the state also
would lend Southern Pacific $36 million to install continuous
welded rails along the entire north-south route.
   The route runs 632 miles from Joliet to the Kansas City area. It
is mainly used for freight, but Amtrak also uses it to make daily
round-trip passenger runs between Chicago and St. Louis.
   A shutdown of the line would have left more than 100 businesses
in Illinois and Missouri without rail service. An estimated 300,000
people travel the route annually.
   Hartigan, representatives of Illinois Gov. James Thompson, and
other state officials entered into negotiations last weekend with
CM&amp;W and its creditors, who sought liquidation of the railroad's
assets to pay back debts totaling more than $100 million.
   Citicorp North America Inc. and Heller Financial Inc. had asked
the court to cancel the CM&amp;W contract with Amtrak because they said
the railroad is continuing to lose money on the passenger service
and ``has no reasonable prospects of successful reorganization.''
   Pat Yoxall, a spokeswoman for Citicorp, said the creditors had
met with state and CM&amp;W officials, but declined to specify what
agreements had been reached.
   ``All of those groups are part of the discussion,'' Yoxall said
Wednesday in a telephone interview. ``We gave the judge
confirmation that negotiations are ongoing.''
   Negotiations continued with Wertheim Schroder &amp; Co., which seeks
to purchase the CM&amp;W's east-west lines, which run between St. Louis
and Kansas City and are used for freight.
   Murray said the Wertheim cash proposal will go before Schwartz
on Dec. 4.
   Schwartz is considering a proposal, submitted Tuesday, to have
Santa Fe Railway operate the lines until then, the trustee said.
   CM&amp;W was created in 1986 as an independent regional railroad.
   In April 1988, the railroad filed for protection from creditors
and reorganization under federal bankruptcy law.
