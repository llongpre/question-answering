The battle to create the largest railway network in the US intensified
further yesterday when Union Pacific raised its takeover bid for Santa Fe
Pacific to Dollars 3.8bn from Dollars 3.2bn, about Dollars 600m more than
offered by rival railway operator Burlington Northern.
In an attempt to put pressure on Santa Fe shareholders, who are due to vote
on the proposed Burlington merger on November 15, Union Pacific said its new
offer was contingent on Santa Fe immediately terminating merger talks with
Burlington.
Last night, Santa Fe did not say it would stop talking to Burlington, but
promised to consider the new offer from Union Pacific. However, the Santa Fe
management, which has recommended that shareholders accept Burlington's
offer, warned it was unlikely that a merger with Union Pacific would receive
the approval of federal regulators.
Ever since Union Pacific offered to buy Santa Fe, doubts have been expressed
over whether the government would allow a merger between two railways whose
prime routes are in direct competition with each other. Union Pacific has
responded by saying that a panel of industry experts it hired to study its
bid had concluded that the merger stood a good chance of being approved by
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
Union Pacific raised its bid for Santa Fe over the weekend because
Burlington last week increased its original offer of Dollars 2.6bn to
Dollars 3.2bn. If that deal is approved by shareholders, it will create the
biggest freight railroad system in the US, joining two complementary
networks spreading from the west coast to the midwest.
Union Pacific's latest offer, worth Dollars 20 a share, represents a 29 per
cent premium over Santa Fe's current stock price of Dollars 15 1/2.
