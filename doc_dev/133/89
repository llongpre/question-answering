   Rain fell over much of the northern half of the East Coast on
Friday, with freezing rain and snow in some inland spots, and light
rain fell over much of the West Coast.
   The low pressure system that dropped heavy rain along the
central Gulf Coast earlier in the week slid up the East Coast and
during the afternoon rain was widespread from Maryland and eastern
Virginia to New York state and central New England.
   The heaviest rain in the six hours up to 1 p.m. EST was 0.98 of
an inch at Fort Eustis, Va., the National Weather Service reported.
   The clouds and rain kept temperatures in the 30s and 40s from
New England to Virginia, with readings in the 50s over the
Carolinas and Georgia.
   In upstate New York, freezing rain was reported in the
Susquehanna and Catskill regions and Binghamton reported freezing
rain throughout most of the day.
   Snow and sleet were scattered over parts of western New England
and eastern New York, but temperatures were mostly above freezing.
Two to 4 inches of snow was forecast for the mountains of Maine and
New Hampshire.
   Gusty northeasterly wind blew across sections of the New Jersey
coast during the afternoon and gusts to 45 mph were reported around
New York City. Gale warnings were posted for the New Jersey coast
and Long Island Sound.
   A moist Pacific weather system spread rain throughout much of
the West Coast states, but most rainfall amounts were less than a
quarter inch. Snow was reported above 7,000 feet in the Sierra
Nevada range, with accumulation of 6 to 12 inches possible around
the Lake Tahoe area.
   In the middle of the nation, a few rain and snow showers spread
over the Dakotas and Minnesota.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 28
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 84 at Fort Myers, Fla. Friday's low
in the Lower 48 states was 2 degrees below zero at Houlton, Maine.
   For Saturday, showers were forecast in the early part of the day
over New England, New York state and western Pennsylvania. Widely
scattered showers were forecast over southern Texas, and across the
northern Plains and northern Rockies. Widespread rain was forecast
over the West Coast states, and northern and central sections of
the Intermountain region betwwen the Sierra Nevada and the Rockies.
   Highs in the 40s and 50s were predicted from the Pacific
Northwest across the northern Rockies, the northern Plains, the
upper Mississippi Valley and the Great Lakes to New England; in the
80s over Florida, Louisiana, Texas and southern Arizona; and in the
60s and 70s elsewhere.
