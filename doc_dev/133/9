   Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., under orders from the Interstate Commerce Commission to sell one of its two railroad units, is trying to persuade the regulatory agency to allow it to sell only a portion of the Southern Pacific Transportation Co., commission staff members and industry officials said. 

   Santa Fe wants to retain Chicago-based Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway, its more profitable railroad property, these sources said. 
It also wants to keep a portion of the Southern Pacific, known as the Cotton Belt line. 
The Cotton Belt, which runs from New Mexico to Kansas and from Texas to Tennesee, would provide the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe with two new gateways to the East: Memphis, Tenn., and St. Louis. 

   But such a plan would in turn rob Southern Pacific of these two cities and Kansas City, the three most important gateways on its route system. 
"It would be a dagger in the heart of the Southern Pacific," a source close to the San Francisco-based railroad said. 

   Robert D. Krebs, Santa Fe Southern Pacific's chief executive officer, said through a spokesman that the company is continuing work on a divestiture plan and that reports of the possible sale of the Cotton Belt are "premature." 

   Denman K. McNear, chairman and chief executive officer of Southern Pacific, declined to comment. 

   Santa Fe Southern Pacific was formed in 1983 through the merger of the two railroads' parent companies, Santa Fe Industries Inc. and Southern Pacific Co. 
In June, it lost a four-year battle to merge the two railroad units, which had long competed for the transport of a wide range of commodities across the West and Midwest and which it continued to operate separately pending ICC approval. 
But the ICC, which denied the merger on anti-competitive grounds, ordered the railroad, energy and real estate concern to submit a divestiture plan by Sept. 28. 

   Since then, Santa Fe officials have had several meetings with ICC commissioners and staff to discuss the possible sale of parts of Southern Pacific, the industry and commission sources said. 
Although it is unclear if the commission will allow the sale of only a portion of Southern Pacific, at least one commissioner, Paul Lamboley, has criticized the Santa Fe plan as "just another attempt at a merger," a commission official said. 

   Only one company, Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., has so far publicly expressed an interest in Southern Pacific. 
But Kansas City Southern has yet to make a specific offer. 

   The Cotton Belt has been one of the more profitable routes in the Southern Pacific system. 
In the first five months of 1987, the line had revenue of $150 million, compared with $140 million in the same period of 1986. 
The Southern Pacific unit had 1986 revenue of $2.27 billion. 

   Through the Cotton Belt line and its gateways at St. Louis, Memphis, Kansas City and New Orleans, Southern Pacific trains transfer a wide range of cargo, including autos, lumber and petrochemicals, to other rail carriers for delivery to eastern cities. 
If the Atchison Topeka &amp; Santa Fe is allowed to take control of those gateways, "it would spell disaster for the Southern Pacific," an industry official said.
