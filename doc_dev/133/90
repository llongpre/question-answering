THE US rail system was braced yesterday for possible coast-to-coast
industrial action which could bring chaos to both freight and passenger
services. Talks between rail unions and operators were continuing up to a
midnight deadline yesterday.
Amtrak, which runs passenger services across the US, had already cancelled
about 50 overnight runs, to prevent passengers being stranded.
It was also refusing to take long-distance reservations for today and
tomorrow and negotiating stand-by arrangements with bus companies and
airlines. Greyhound, the largest long-distance bus operator, said it had
agreed to accept Amtrak tickets on all routes, while special arrangements
had also been made between Amtrak and USAir.
At issue are three separate union-management negotiations, all attempting to
establish new labour contracts. The first centres on talks between the
International Association of Machinists and the freight railroad industry
generally; the second concerns Conrail, one of the largest freight operators
and its track workers; the third involves Amtrak and half a dozen unions.
Late last night Amtrak announced it had reached agreement with two unions
but said it was still negotiating with the other four.
If strike action is called it is unclear whether it would occur in all three
disputes, or just one. A strike by the IAM against the freight operators
would be the most damaging.
However, Conrail alone serves 14 states and about half the freight moved in
the US starts or ends on Conrail track. A strike against Amtrak would badly
disrupt commuter traffic in metropolitan areas on the east coast - such as
Boston and New York.
Congress has special powers over the rail industry which allow it to enforce
labour settlements - authority it has used as recently as last year. Union
supporters allege that the railroad operators are anxious to incite strike
action in order to drag Congress into the dispute.
It is likely Congress will step in if a strike is called. President George
Bush has met Mr Andrew Card, the new transport secretary, and both signalled
that the administration was poised to pressure Congress to intervene.
