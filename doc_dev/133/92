<TEXT>     Union leaders said they had reached a fragile agreement that would allow
commuter rail workers to stay on the job while freight workers went on strike
at 7 a.m., even though both groups belong to the same union.;    "The CalTrain
commuter passengers are just innocent bystanders," said Ed Adams, president of
the United Transportation Union Local 1732 in San Jose. "Our intent is not to
drag them into our dispute.";    But a spokesman for the Southern Pacific
Railroad, which owns the tracks on which the CalTrain service operates, said
Southern Pacific would refuse to allow some workers to stay on the job while
others picket.;    "At 7 a.m., if a picket line goes up in Eugene, Ore., we
will consider ourselves struck, and we will cease operations throughout that
time zone," spokesman Mike Brown said. "It is not safe to operate as
sophisticated a commute line as the Peninsula in a strike environment.";   
Brown added that commuters taking trains before 7 a.m. should not be
affected.;    The trains are owned by the California Department of
Transportation, but run on rails owned by Southern Pacific. The conductors,
engineers and ticket sellers on the commuter lines are members of one of the
bargaining unions.;    Last-ditch contract talks between freight railroads and
unions representing 235,000 workers broke off Tuesday evening in Washington,
prompting the unions to call for picket lines to be set up around the country
at 7 a.m. today local time.; "I assume there was just no reason to go on," Jim
Reiter, a spokesman for the Association of American Railroads, said about
three hours before a federally imposed "cooling off" period was set to
expire.;    The unions said they have no quarrel with the Amtrak passenger
service or local commuter lines; no Amtrak service disruptions were expected
on the East Coast.;    But in places where Amtrak or local commuter lines,
such as CalTrain, use tracks owned by freight lines, traffic could be
disrupted.;    Several CalTrain passengers said Tuesday that they dreaded the
prospect of joining bumper-to-bumper traffic on the freeways today.;    "I
rely on the train. I like the train," said Ron Ruiz, 46, as he waited at the
San Jose depot for a train to take him to his San Francisco job as a shoe
salesman. "I get there in a little over an hour, and I read the newspaper
instead of fighting traffic.";    Ruiz said that he would drive to work if the
trains stopped but that it would be more expensive.;    "It costs $80 a month
for a (rail) pass, and you can't drive back and forth many days for $80. And
when you get there, there's parking. Six bucks a day is the cheapest.";    An
Amtrak spokeswoman, Sue Martin, said the Los Angeles-to-San Diego route -- the
nation's second busiest passenger traffic corridor after the Northeast --
could be affected.;    Even as the talks broke off, unions said they were
willing to try to avoid a strike.;    "The unions, at this point, while we
recognize that there are still a great many problems to resolve, the door is
open to try to engage in meaningful negotiations," said Ed Wytkind, a
spokesman for the unions.;    Dan Lang, another industry spokesman, said the
carriers made an 11th-hour attempt to settle by offering a new proposal. He
offered no specifics, but said, "Obviously, it came to naught.";    Wytkind
said he was unaware of any substantive new proposal.;    Presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Bush administration was prepared to work
with Congress on speedy legislation "to impose a settlement and end the
strike.";    Congressional leaders had refused to enact legislation to stop a
strike before it started, but Tuesday, meeting behind closed doors, they said
that if a walkout occurred, they would hurry to pass legislation to resolve
the dispute.;    "My feeling is that, given the nature of the economy, it is
important to act in a timely fashion," said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.,
chairman of the Senate Education and Labor Committee.;    A House panel
already had scheduled a hearing for early today, with representatives of labor
and management, as well as Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner, set to
testify on the impasse.;    At issue is a 3-year-old dispute about wages, work
rules and health care costs.;    Unions contend the railroads have not offered
high enough pay increases to make up for wage freezes of the past. Management
argues that railroad workers' salaries are already higher than those paid to
most other industrial employees.; r; STILL ON TRACK?; Though it uses freight
tracks, CalTrain is expected to keep running if there is a strike.
Nevertheless:; (box)CalTrain workers reportedly would not cross picket lines
set up by freight train workers.; (box)Employees striking Southern Pacific,
which owns the tracks, might decide to lock out CalTrain workers or otherwise
hinder service.; (box)BART and SamTrans have prepared for extra commuters. For
tips, see Back Page.; WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO YOU; Here are some of the expected
effects of a strike by 235,000 freight-line workers:; (box) Car and truck
assembly plants could begin shutting down by week's end. That would cause a
rippling effect through component and supplier plants, all within a week, and
add up to widespread layoffs. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association says
70 to 80 percent of motor-vehicle manufacturing facilities would be affected
in the first 24 hours of a strike.; (box) Coal deliveries will be disrupted.
Coal is the largest single commodity carried by the rail industry. Nationwide,
railroads deliver about 57 percent of the coal sent to domestic customers.;
(box) Delays could occur in United Parcel Service deliveries. The company uses
freight trains to transport 30 percent of the 11 million packages it delivers
each day.; (box) About 234,000 daily rail commuters in the Bay Area, Southern
California, Chicago and Maryland will have to find other ways to get around.;
HOW YOU CAN GET AROUND IT; CalTrain officials urged the 11,000 people who ride
its trains daily to seek other public transit in case of a stoppage. Pass
holders will be reimbursed for any days the trains don't run. For more
information on service disruption, call (800) 558-8661.; (box) SamTrans: San
Mateo County is adding buses to several local routes and urging passengers to
use its nine express routes, which leave from Palo Alto, Redwood City, San
Carlos, San Mateo and Foster City. Commuters with monthly CalTrain passes will
get a 60-cent discount. For route information, call (800) 660-4287.; (box)
Santa Clara County Transit: South Bay buses -- specifically, Route 22, will
take commuters to the Menlo Park CalTrain station, where they can catch
SamTrans's Bus 5L or 7F. But be warned -- Bus 22 makes lots of stops, and
Santa Clara County transit officials say they aren't planning to add buses
during the strike. There's no discount for train pass holders. For route
information, call (408) 287-4210.;    (box) BART: Bay Area Rapid Transit plans
to add extra trains and to set up ticket tables at the Daly City and Fremont
stations to accommodate the crush. Because parking will be at a premium,
officials are urging riders to take public transportation to the stations or
have someone drop them off. Santa Clara County Transit Bus 180 runs from the
San Jose CalTrain station to the Fremont BART station. Call (415) 465-BART for
information.; TICKET TO RIDE; Who carried the freight in 1989; ...; Airlines
