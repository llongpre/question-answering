   The Santa Fe Railroad had one of its best
four-month periods in recent history from January through April,
earning more than double what it made in the same period of 1987,
company officials said Tuesday.
   That made the railroad the star performer of Santa Fe Southern
Pacific Corp., a Chicago-based holding company, officials said at
the corporation's annual shareholders' meeting here.
   Improvements in the railroad's income resulted from a 22 percent
increase in carloads and increased efficiency, officials said.
   Overall, Santa Fe Southern had net income of $395.8 million, or
$2.52 per share, compared with $71 million, or 45 cents per share,
for the same period last year.
   The latest period's results included a $335.9 million gain from
the sale of assets. It also included a $35 million charge from the
company's restructuring program.
   Earnings from continuing operations were flat at $59.9 million,
or 38 cents per share, compared with $60.6 million, or 38 cents per
share, a year earlier.
   The company did not announce revenue figures.
   Also Tuesday, the company's board of directors elected Robert D.
Krebs to replace the retiring John S. Reed as chairman. Krebs also
will continue serving as president and chief executive officer.
   Officials told shareholders the sale of assets during the first
four months helped erase some of the debt Santa Fe incurred from a
one-time special dividend of $30 per share paid to shareholders
earlier this year.
   At Tuesday's sometimes contentious meeting, several shareholders
were critical of the special dividend, saying they would take a
large tax loss this year because of the way it was structured.
   Shareholders also voted to recommend overturning a ``poison
pill'' anti-takeover defense instituted by the corporation's
management. However, Krebs said both he and Reed, who remains on
the board of directors, would vote against following shareholders'
advice.
   The poison pill would be triggered if any shareholder's stake
exceeds 20 percent. If that happened, other Santa Fe shareholders
would be permitted to buy new stock at half price.
   Two major shareholders, Olympia &amp; York and Henley Group Inc.,
have criticized the pill in the past. Both companies have attempted
to take over Santa Fe Southern during the past year.
   Krebs pointed out that those companies represented a majority of
the shareholders who voted against the pill Tuesday.
   Richard Foley, a Santa Fe employee and shareholder from Tucson,
Ariz., who supported the proposal to overturn the pill, said, ``The
measure passed today requires that Santa Fe management make a
decision to listen to the shareholders, or refuse to allow their
shareholders a voice in ownership.''
   Foley also criticized the board of directors' decision to sell
the Southern Pacific Transportation Co. to the Denver-based Rio
Grande Industries Inc.
   Meanwhile, at a news conference after the meeting, John Swartz,
president of the railroad, said the company's restructuring is
ahead of schedule.
   Under the restructuring announced in June 1987, Santa Fe
Railroad reduced its divisions from 11 to six, with one of the new
and enlarged divisions headquartered in Kansas City, Kan., and the
other in Newton, Kan.
