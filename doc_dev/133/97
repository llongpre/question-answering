   CNW Corp.'s board approved a $1.6 billion buyout
offer Tuesday from a group that includes company management,
railroad company Union Pacific Corp. and other investors, prompting
hostile suitor Japonica Partners to withdraw its own offer.
   The buyout group formed by investment banker Blackstone Group,
which will hold a controlling interest in the railroad company,
agreed to pay $45.50 cash per common share in cash and $4.50 per
share of preferred stock.
   CNW stock jumped 75 cents to close at $47.50 a share New York
Stock Exchange composite trading.
   ``Employees and customers of CNW will benefit from the fact that
our business plan calls for upgrading CNW's most strategically
important line, does not depend upon the sale of operating assets,
and continues CNW's role as a provider of quality transportation
services,'' said CNW chairman and chief executive officer Robert
Schmiege, who leads the management contingent of the buyout group.
   New York-based Japonica Partners, which had been pursuing a $44 a
share hostile takeover valued at $722 million, issued a statement
saying it was terminating its tender offer. The group is CNW's
largest shareholder with an 8.8 percent stake.
   ``Japonica Partners and its affiliates intend to evaluate their
alternatives, which may include the disposition of some or all of
the CNW common shares benefically owned by them; or holding some or
all of such shares for sale pursuant to the merger agreement,'' the
statement read.
   Based on approximately 19 million CNW shares outstanding and the
assumption of CNW debt, the management group valued its buyout plan
at $1.6 billion.
   New York's Chemical Bank has committed $585 million in buyout
financing and the New York investment firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette Inc. has committed to provide up to $475 million in
financing.
   Blackstone will hold a controlling interest in CNW under the
agreement, with minority positions held by management and Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   Union Pacific, the railroad and trucking company, will hold $100
million of stock that will be convertible into a minority position
after five years.
   Officials said Blackstone's financing structure will not require
significant sales of operating assets to retire the debt caused by
the takeover. But the firm will complete CNW's previously announced
plan to sell its Chicago-area commuter operations and will divest
some real estate and surplus equipment.
   Japonica planned to sell CNW's real estate, excess equipment and
Chicago-area commuter lines if its takeover bid succeeded.
   CNW is the parent of the Chicago and North Western Transportation
Co., a 6,000-mile railroad with 8,500 employees that operates in
nine states, most of them in the Midwest.
   Union Pacific owns Bethlehem, Pa.-based Union Pacific Railroad.
which has some 21,000 route miles, all west of the Mississippi River.
   Union Pacific relies heavily on the North Western's
Chicago-to-Fremont, Neb., line for east-west freight traffic and
accounts for about 40 percent of the North Western's shipments,
analysts say.
   ``We wanted to insure reliable and effective service to our
customers into and out of Chicago,'' Union Pacific spokesman Harvey
Turner said of the takeover agreement in a telephone interview.
   CNW has agreed with Union Pacific to spend $115 million through
1992 to maintain and upgrade CNW's east-west main line in order to
improve rail quality and shorten delivery times.
   Union Pacific recently paid $1.5 million for an option to buy the
Iowa Interstate Railroad, a regional line between Iowa and Chicago.
Officials said the line would have served as a substitute for the
North Western had a hostile takeover disrupted freight service.
   The offer by the Blackstone-led group was approved by a special
CNW board committee that was evaluating bids for the Chicago-based
rail company.
   CNW's union on Friday made a proposal to buy the company that
would have given employees a one-third stake in the railroad. Union
officials did not immedately return telephone calls seeking comment.
