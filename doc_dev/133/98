   Kansas City Southern Industries Inc., Kansas City, Mo., said it asked a federal court to review the Interstate Commerce Commission's approval of the sale of Southern Pacific Transportation Co. to Rio Grande Industries Inc. 

   In filing the petition with the federal appeals court in New Orleans, Kansas City Southern said it believes the ICC failed to consider the acquisition's long-range impact on Southern Pacific's ability to compete effectively. 

   The ICC approved Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp.'s $1.02 billion sale of its Southern Pacific railroad unit to Denver-based Rio Grande in August, spurning Kansas City Southern's competing bid.
