   Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged fellow
members of a Harvard University governing board Sunday to back
divestment in South Africa until changes promised by that country's
president become reality.
   In a news conference following a closed-door meeting of the
Board of Overseers, Tutu said that much of what South African
President F.W. de Klerk said last week was a declaration of purpose.
   ``Sanctions should remain in place until certain conditions are
met,'' Tutu said.
   In last week's speech, de Klerk promised to free jailed African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and lift government bans on
30 outlawed opposition groups.
   Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
efforts, welcomed the announcement but tempered his response with
pragmatism.
   ``We'd like to see these things immediately but let's be
realistic. The parliamentary session has just begun,'' the Anglican
archbishop said.
   Tutu said he had asked colleagues on the 30-member Board of
Overseers to press Harvard to withdraw $139 million in investments
in South African companies until Mandela is freed, all exiled
political activists are granted amnesty and the government's policy
of segregation is dismantled.
   The board planned to further consider the divestment issue at a
future meeting.
   The board is less powerful than the university's main governing
body, the Harvard Corp., but is the only alumni-elected panel with
an influence on school policy. The board plays no role in
day-to-day business, but must give formal consent to major
initiaitves and appointments.
   Tutu, who ran for the board on an anti-apartheid slate, was
elected last June along with U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
and actor John Lithgow.
   The archbishop said de Klerk's action last week was sparked by
the growing number of countries that had placed sanctions on South
Africa, a position Tutu said seemed to be catching on among fellow
board members.
   He said he was encouraged by the attention South Africa had
received in the United States amid the historic changes in the
Soviet bloc.
   ``The kind of coverage and response is indicative that, in spite
of what has happened in Eastern Europe, which pushed our case to
the back burner, people here do want to see our situation
resolved,'' he said.
   Asked why he was in Massachusetts rather than South Africa at
such a critical time, Tutu replied, ``Harvard is Harvard. The
things that Harvard does and does not do have an impact far beyond
what you would expect from an educational institution.''
