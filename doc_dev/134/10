   KATUTURA, South-West Africa (AP) _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu
preached Sunday in the territory's largest black township, derided
its multiracial government and renewed his call for independence
from South Africa.
   Tutu gave his sermon to about 1,500 people, many in the red,
green and blue colors of the South-West Africa People's
Organization, a guerrilla group fighting for independence.
   The congregation had gathered to hear Tutu, the first black
leader of the Anglican church in southern Africa, in a church near
Windhoek, capital of the territory commonly known as Namibia.
   ``God is here with you in Namibia. He suffers with you,'' said
Tutu. ``He says, `It is going to be all right, because I am the God
of justice, I am the God of liberation.'''
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, lamented last week's
moves by South African President P.W. Botha to broaden power of his
country's chief representative in Namibia.
   Botha said Administrator-General Louis Pienaar will be empowered
to act against ``subversive'' media, arrange for regional or
racially based elections and refer certain major court rulings to
South Africa's appellate court.
   The archbishop spurned the territory's multiracial interim
government as ``echoes of their master's voice.''
   He was joined at the church Sunday by 18 Anglican bishops who
serve under him. They included the bishop of Namibia, who wore a
leopard-skin mitre, and bishops from nearby Swaziland, Lesotho and
neighboring South Africa.
   Women ululated and held their children above their heads for a
glimpse of Tutu. The service was held at a Roman Catholic church,
the largest place of worship in the township of 60,000 people.
   Namibia's 1.3 million people are 88 percent black. The rest are
divided about equally between whites, who dominate the economy, and
people of mixed race.
   The rebels in the territory have waged a 22-year-old, largely
ineffectual war of independence.
   On Sunday, Tutu blamed South Africa's apartheid system for the
violence.
   Tutu won his Nobel prize for his fight against apartheid, which
establishes a racially segregated society in which South Africa's
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   ``We are opposed to all violence, especially the violence of the
evil system of apartheid, however it may be disguised by cosmetic
adjustments,'' Tutu said Sunday. ``It can survive only because it
uses evil and immoral methods to defend it.''
   A sheet of hymns distributed at the church Sunday showed
pictures of detained activists.
   But Tutu said he opposed violence by both guerrillas and the
military, and he rejected communism as a goal for Namibia.
   ``The best defense against communism is a free and contented
people,'' he said. ``South Africa does not want Namibia to be
free.''
   Tutu appealed for Pretoria to observe a U.N. resolution calling
for a South African withdrawal and U.N.-supervised independence
elections in Namibia.
   But South Africa says it will stay as long as Cuban troops
remain in neighboring Angola, where they are helping the Marxist
government battle combined forces of South Africa and a rebel
movement.
