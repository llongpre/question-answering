   Supporters and critics of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu scuffled Saturday during rival
demonstrations before the black Anglican leader embarked on a trip
to Moscow.
   At least one black man, a supporter of Tutu, was taken into
custody, and police ordered all members of the public to leave the
main hall at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport.
   About 100 of Tutu's supporters remained in the hall and chanted
the archbishop's name when he arrived on a connecting flight from
Cape Town.
   Police and clergymen escorted Tutu and his wife, Leah, through
the hall as his supporters, most of them black, cheered. Many white
onlookers stared in amazement.
   He gave a final wave to the crowd before entering the
international departure area to catch a flight to London. He is to
fly to Moscow on Sunday to join ecumenical celebrations of the
1,000th anniversary of the Russian Orthodox Church.
   About 15 anti-Tutu protesters _ including a few blacks and a
white woman with charcoal on her face and wearing a bishop's
costume _ assembled at Jan Smuts with placards denouncing the
archbishop's support for sanctions against South Africa. One poster
termed Tutu ``Moscow's Puppet,'' while another said: ``Red Carpet
for Tutu _ Red Bombs for Us.''
   It was the fourth airport protest against Tutu since he returned
three weeks ago from a trip to Europe and the United States. During
that trip, he repeatedly called for tougher sanctions against South
Africa as a means of promoting racial reform.
   Saturday marked the first time during the series of protests
that anti-Tutu demonstrators were outnumbered by supporters of the
archbishop, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight
against South Africa's policy of white domination.
   The altercation began after some of the supporters grabbed an
anti-Tutu poster and tore it. Police announced over the public
address system that the arrival hall should be vacated, but many
people _ including members of the rival protest groups _ remained.
   When Tutu arrived, about 45 minutes after the scuffle, one woman
cursed him but few of his other critics were visible.
   Participants in the earlier anti-Tutu protests have included
whites from right-wing organizations and jobless blacks recruited
by conservative black politicians. All the protests have been
filmed and shown on the national television news by the state-run
South African Broadcasting Corp., which frequently denounces Tutu.
   Tutu has described sanctions as one of the few non-violent means
of pressuring the government to end apartheid, under which South
Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs.
Sanctions could be avoided, he says, if the government dismantled
apartheid and moved to grant the black majority full political
rights.
   Tutu's critics contend that sanctions will result in higher
black unemployment while hardening the attitudes of pro-apartheid
whites.
   These critics also claim most blacks oppose sanctions, but there
is no means of verifying this. Endorsement of sanctions is illegal
under emergency regulations, and blacks are not allowed to vote in
national elections or referendums.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary general of the South African
Council of Churches, said this week that the anti-Tutu protests
were being ``orchestrated ... to give the impression that there was
mounting protest against anti-apartheid groups.''
