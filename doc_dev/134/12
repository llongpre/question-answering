<HEAD>Bishop Tutu Heads Anti-Apartheid Slate In Contested Harvard Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu was among five
anti-apartheid candidates for Harvard University's governing board
awaiting word on whether alumni supported their stand against the
school's investments in South Africa.
   ``It has been a vituperative campaign. Things have heated up,''
said Robert Wolff, director of Harvard-Radcliffe Alumnae Against
Apartheid.
   The group, which has three members on the 30-member Board of
Overseers, ran five candidates against a Harvard Alumni
Association-backed slate of 10, including U.S. Transportation
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, former Democratic Party Chairman Paul
Kirk and actor John Lithgow.
   Results of the election, which was open to all Harvard degree
holders and conducted by mail, will be made public Thursday at
Harvard's commencement.
   The anti-apartheid group has pressured the university to
withdraw its $162.8 million in investments in companies doing
business in South Africa.
   Tutu, a black leader of the Anglican church in southern Africa
and a 1984 Nobel Peace Prize-winner, has threatened to return the
honorary degree Harvard gave him in 1979 unless the university
backs away from its South Africa-related holdings.
   Wolff, a professor of philosophy at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, charged that Harvard had campaigned
against the anti-apartheid slate.
   Fred Glimp, vice president of alumni affairs, denied that but
said voters should be wary of one-issue candidates.
