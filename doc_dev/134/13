   Anglican bishops, including an
envoy sent by the Archbishop of Canterbury, today pledged support
for Archbishop Desmond Tutu in his confrontation with the
government.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican church in southern
Africa, has angered President P.W. Botha by declaring that he and
other church leaders will carry on the work of anti-apartheid
groups which last month were banned from operating.
   Nineteen bishops, after an emergency meeting with Tutu, issued a
statement warning that the government ``is driving this beloved
country closer to civil war.''
   ``We offer Archbishop Tutu our loyalty and support,'' the
bishops said. ``We shall not allow the government to isolate him.''
   Tutu, who declared that the government would ``bite the dust,''
said it was important that Botha and other white South Africans
``know that I am not just spouting forth things that come into my
head.''
   ``These are responsible people,'' said Tutu, gesturing to the
bishops. ``They would have knocked me down if they believed that
what I am saying is inconsistent with the gospel.''
   Botha met with Tutu, the winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize,
last week and suggested that the archbishop had aligned himself
with the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   Referring to this, the bishops said they ``take grave offense at
the cavalier way'' in which Botha treated Tutu.
   Among those attending today's meeting was Bishop Keith Sutton of
Lichfield, England, who was sent as representative of the
Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.
   Runcie is spiritual leader of the 70-million-member worldwide
Anglican communion.
   ``He is a Christian leader,'' Sutton said of Tutu. ``His
objections to apartheid grow directly out of his pastoral work.''
   At a news conference Monday, Tutu dared Botha to take action
against him.
   ``If they try to restrict me or ban me, they are just wasting
their time, because I will not obey their orders,'' Tutu said.
``They will have to put me in jail.''
   ``I can't keep looking over my shoulder to see if God has got
the approval or disapproval of the government,'' he added.
   Three weeks ago, Tutu and 24 other church leaders were arrested
and briefly detained after they tried to march to Parliament in
Cape Town with a petition protesting the latest crackdown on
opposition.
   Last month, the government banned 17 other organizations from
participating in any activity not approved by the government.
   Since then Tutu and other church representatives have taken up
the struggle against apartheid, which by law and custom establishes
a racially segregated society in which the 26 million blacks have
no vote in national affairs.
   South Africa's 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
