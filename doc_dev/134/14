<HEAD>Tutu Rejects Botha Reform Proposal As ``Crumbs of Conscience''</HEAD>

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu today
rejected as ``crumbs of conscience'' President P.W. Botha's
proposal for giving blacks more political clout in South Africa.
   The black South African cleric accused Botha of making ``slight
adjustments to the evil system'' of apartheid, South Africa's
official policy of separation of the races. Tutu, an outspoken
opponent of apartheid, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984.
   It won't help if the white-led government merely ``moved
furniture around, because the room would remain the same,'' Tutu
said on the last day of a four-day visit to Britain.
   Botha told Parliament on Thursday that he would move for black
participation in the electoral college and possibly in the Cabinet
as part of the National Party's program of gradual reform.
   Blacks have demanded full voting rights and abolition of
residential and school segregation.
   Tutu, leader of South Africa's Anglican Church, dismissed
Botha's policy of gradually introducing apartheid reforms.
   ``Reform will not come by `big master' throwing to us crumbs of
conscience that fall from his table,'' the archbishop said. ``It
will happen when all the people in South Africa are able to
determine the menu together when they sit at the same table.''
   Tutu was speaking at ceremony opening a primary school in this
central England industrial city.
   The school is named after Nelson Mandela, the jailed black
activist, prompting protests from local Conservative politicians.
They denounced Mandela as a terrorist and said Tutu had not been
forthright in his condemnation of violence.
