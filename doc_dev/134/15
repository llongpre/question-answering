   WINDHOEK, South-West Africa (AP) _ In a stinging rebuke to
President P.W. Botha, Archbishop Desmond Tutu today denied that he
endorsed Marxism and said his fight against apartheid was deeply
rooted in Christian tradition.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in southern
Africa, released the text of a letter to Botha defending his
challenges of government policy in a church-state confrontation
that has intensified over the past two months.
   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate was responding to a March letter
from Botha in which the South African president suggested Tutu was
furthering the cause of the African National Congress guerrilla
movement and promoting a Marxist dictatorship.
   Botha, whose letter was quoted at length on South African
television, asked whether Tutu was acting ``on behalf of the
kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the ANC.''
   Replied Tutu: ``I work for God's kingdom. For whose kingdom,
with your apartheid policy, do you work for?''
   ``I reject atheistic Marxism and I reject apartheid, which I
find equally abhorrent,'' said Tutu. He cited numerous scriptural
passages to support his contention that South Africa's policy of
racial separation is ``unbiblical, un-Christian, immoral and evil.''
   Referring to insinuations in Botha's letter, Tutu said he had
never listened to the ANC's radio broadcasts or read its magazine.
   ``My theological position derives from the Bible and the
teachings of the Church,'' Tutu wrote. ``The Bible and the Church
predate Marxism and the ANC by several centuries.''
   Tutu is presiding this week over a synod of Anglican bishops in
South-West Africa. South Africa administers the territory, also
known as Namibia, in violation of a U.N. resolution.
   Tutu also offered to debate the morality of apartheid with a
theologian from Botha's Dutch Reformed Church. Apartheid
establishes a racially segregated society in which the 26.5 million
blacks have no vote in national affairs, but the 5 million whites
control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools and
health services.
   ``My position in this is not one of which I am ashamed ... I
know that I stand in the mainline Christian tradition,'' he added.
   Botha had chided Tutu for getting arrested, along with 25 other
church leaders, when they tried to march on Parliament six weeks
ago to protest the bannings of 17 major anti-apartheid
organizations and more than a dozen individuals.
   The clergymen have been trying to fill the political void
created by the crackdown.
   Tutu, who leaves Saturday on a five-week trip to Europe and the
United States, asked Botha to ensure that his reply to the
president was covered as prominently by state television as Botha's
March 16 letter to Tutu. He also accused the president of falsely
claiming that Tutu once preached under a communist banner.
   ``I pray for you, as I do for your ministerial colleagues, every
day by name,'' Tutu's letter concluded. ``God bless you.''
