   Sen. Paul Simon visited black
squatters Wednesday in Soweto, met with Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
renewed his clemency appeal for the Sharpeville Six, a group of
blacks facing execution.
   The Illinois Democrat, on a five-day trip to South Africa,
conferred briefly with Prakash Diar, lawyer for the Sharpeville
Six. The five men and one woman have been sentenced to hang for
involvement in a mob that killed a black town councilor in 1984 in
Sharpeville, a township south of Johannesburg.
   Later, Simon spent about 30 minutes with Tutu, leader of the
Anglican church in southern Africa and winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize for his campaign against South Africa's apartheid
system of race segregation.
   Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Simon predicted that
Congress will toughen sanctions against South Africa. As chairman
of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on African affairs,
Simon will have a major role in that decision.
   Congress ``would be eager to avoid sanctions if we got a good
strong clear signal from the government here that they were going
to do away with apartheid,'' Simon said. ``But I'm not getting that
signal.''
   He contends that sanctions could push the white authorities
toward reform.
   Before meeting Tutu, Simon toured Soweto, the black township of
2.5 million people outside Johannesburg. He also visited two
squatter camps and an all-male hostel for migrant workers.
   ``I've just spoken with a man with five children who sees his
family only once a year,'' Simon said after emerging from the
hostel. ``This is an illustration of what happens under a system of
injustice based on racial separation.''
   Simon also met with Albertina Sisulu, a prominent anti-apartheid
activist whose husband, Walter, is serving life in prison with
fellow African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   Simon is leading a U.S. campaign seeking clemency for the
Sharpeville Six, whose case has drawn worldwide attention.
President P.W. Botha has refused to intervene. They were granted a
reprieve in March hours before they were to be executed.
   Diar will argue the case before the Appeal Court next month.
   His clients did not physically contribute to the death of the
councilor, according to court testimony. They were convicted under
the doctrine of ``common purpose,'' which holds them responsible
for being an active part of the mob that carried out the killing.
   ``There is a feeling that the system has not provided justice
for a great many people, and to some extent the Sharpeville Six are
a symbol of that,'' Simon said.
   He said his request to visit with the Sharpeville Six was turned
down but he planned to mention the case in a scheduled meeting
Thursday with Foreign Minister Roelof F. Botha.
