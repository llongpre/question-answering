   The son of Archbishop Desmond
Tutu said Tuesday he engineered his own arrest at an airport to
promote an advertising agency he heads.
   Trevor Tutu made the declaration to reporters after going to
court Tuesday first to face charges stemming from the airport
incident and then to answer minor traffic violations.
   ``We're in the business of playing with people's minds,'' Tutu,
32, told reporters at his news conference. He said he tricked police
into arresting him mainly ``to tell people that TuMult had arrived.''
   He serves as chairman of TuMult, a black-oriented advertising
agency formed a few months ago. He said the name was chosen to sound
like his last name, which gained international fame in 1984 when his
father won the Nobel Peace Prize.
   Earlier Tuesday, Tutu and a former girlfriend appeared in a
suburban magistrate's court to face charges of violating civil
aviation laws.
   The charges relate to an incident over Tutu's luggage Saturday at
Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport. The case against Tutu and Joan
Rhodes was postponed until Feb. 15.
   But Tutu was taken into custody by Johannesburg police as he left
the Kempton Park courthouse, driven to police headquarters, and
fined $160 for failing to answer three traffic summonses.
   He pleaded guilty to operating an unlicensed vehicle and parking
twice in a loading zone.
   At the news conference, Tutu said he and colleagues planned the
airport incident as a promotion stunt.
   Tutu said he changed into dirty, old clothes while heading into
Johannesburg on a flight from Swaziland. He said he then placed
luggage near some policemen at the airport and told them he was a
servant acting on instructions of his white employer.
   He said the police did nothing until he came back later to remove
the bags and told them the parcels could have contained bombs.
   At that point, he said, many policemen converged, and he was
arrested, Tutu said.
   ``I tied down 5,000 guys,'' Tutu said of security personnel. He
repeatedly mocked police, saying at one point: ``They don't know
what they're doing.''
   Police have warned South Africans not to leave parcels and
luggage unattended in public places because of a bombing campaign by
anti-government guerrillas.
   Tutu is the eldest of four children of Desmond Tutu, who leads
the Anglican Church in southern Africa. The father won the Nobel
Prize for his campaigning against the country's system of racial
discrimination.
   Trevor Tutu said his father did not know in advance of his recent
activities but added: ``As long as I'm using peaceful means, he
doesn't mind.''
   In 1984, Trevor Tutu was held by police for three days before he
was cleared of a charge of drunken driving.
   In 1985, he was briefly detained after arguing with police at a
courthouse about the detention of black children.
