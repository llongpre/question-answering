   Jubilation over the pending release of South
Africa's imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela must be tempered
with the realization that apartheid is far from ended, Archbishop
Desmond Tutu said Saturday.
   Tutu, visiting to confer with other opposition leaders and U.S.
officials, said the fight for equality is not over and urged
continued political and economic pressure on the South African
government to dismantle apartheid.
   ``We have not yet the complete dismantling of apartheid and this
is the pinpoint of the sanction program. We want apartheid totally
dismantled,'' said Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   The Anglican archbishop said his initial joy over the lifting of
some political restrictions against blacks Friday was tempered
later by the realization that apartheid still is far from over.
   He said his change of heart came after ``having pinched myself
and convinced myself it wasn't a dream and it was real. ... Of
course you see apartheid is still in place.''
   Tutu said he is looking forward to relinquishing his position as
South Africa's pre-eminent opponent of apartheid now that Mandela
is to be released from prison.
   ``I said long ago I was just an interim leader until he
(Mandela) comes out,'' he said. ``He's been making us work too
hard.''
   Tutu was accompanied by Patrick Lekota, publicity secretary for
the United Democratic Front. They were met at Logan International
Airport by Themba Vilakazi, head of the Boston-based Fund for a
Free South Africa, just returned from Zambia where the African
National Congress is based.
   The group was met by Zenani Mandela Dlamini, 30, eldest daughter
of Nelson and Winnie Mandela and a political science student at
Boston University.
   Their arrival came less than 24 hours after South African
President F.W. de Klerk announced in a speech to Parliament that
Mandela would be released unconditionally, although he set no date.
   De Klerk also lifted bans on more than 30 opposition groups
after three decades of underground activity against white rule,
including the African National Congress, outlawed in 1960.
   The announcements appeared to clear the way for talks on a new
constitution that would end the black majority's exclusion from
national politics.
   Tutu, a member of Harvard University's Board of Overseers, was
here to attend a meeting at the school. Lekota said he planned to
attend a meeting of the Albert Einstein Institute, a Cambridge
think tank that advocates the use of non-violent sanctions to solve
political unrest.
   Mandela's daughter, greeted fondly by Tutu, told reporters she
was skeptical of the recent changes in South Africa, despite the
news her father would be released.
   ``This has been going on for 300 years,'' she said. ``What
happened Friday, I'm not overly excited about it. Release some
political prisoners, to me, that's nothing. We want total majority
voting in South Africa. Until that happens, I will not be
satisfied.''
   Her husband, Thumbumuzi Dlamini, 39, is a prince from Swaziland,
one of the sons of the late king Sobhuza II. His brother is now the
king of Swaziland, an independent country almost completely
surrounded by South Africa. They live in the Boston area with their
three children.
   Lekota, who was recently released from prison, was more positive
about the changes. He predicted members of the white minority in
South Africa who resist change will eventually be forced to accept
the idea of equality with blacks.
   ``They cannot stop us,' he said. ``We are unstoppable now.''
   Lekota said he also planned to meet with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., and State Department officials to give the South African
black perspective on the recent turn of events.
