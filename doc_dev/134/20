   Archbishop Desmond Tutu called
``mind-boggling'' Wednesday's first talks between the South African
government and the African National Congress and said too much was
at stake for either side to be ``bloody-minded.''
   The black Anglican archbishop of Cape Town, an anti-apartheid
campaigner and 1984 Nobel Peace laureate, said he didn't expect
important agreements to emerge from the preliminary talks in Cape
Town which end Friday.
   ``I just think what most of the people in our community would
like to hear is a real commitment on all sides to talks,'' he told
a news conference at Exeter University.
   ``And that we want to go in to substantive negotiations, that
would be important and give hope to people who are tired of the
violence of apartheid and the counterviolence of those who oppose
apartheid.''
   Tutu came to Britain Wednesday for a three-day visit shortly
before the talks began. He lectured Wednesday night in this
university city in southwest England.
   Asked by reporters at London's Heathrow Airport if he believed
much could be achieved in the first round, he said:
   ``I am very hopeful. I don't think that any of those people, on
both sides, are going into those talks bloody-minded. We've got too
much at stake. Too many people have already died, too many people
have suffered.''
   Tutu said South African President F.W. de Klerk knew that unless
he settled with the black majority ``the whole question of
sanctions and apartheid economy will be exacerbated.''
   Tutu commented, ``It's actually almost mind-boggling to think
that they are now sitting across the table with the people they
tried to demonize.''
   ``On the ANC side, they know that most of their supporters would
like to see an end to violence,'' the prelate said.
   He called South Africa's racial-segregation system ``one of the
most vicious the world has seen.''
   Tutu criticized British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for
opposing sanctions on South Africa.
   ``We admire her eloquency in condemning apartheid. We just wish
there was a matching consistency in action,'' he said.
