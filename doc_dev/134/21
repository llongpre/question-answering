   Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
saying he was ``obeying God'' in defying the government, urged
blacks and whites to boycott next month's nationwide but segregated
municipal elections.
   Elsewhere on Sunday, black activist Winnie Mandela also violated
state of emergency rules by calling for increased international
economic sanctions against South Africa.
   Tutu, in a service at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town,
described the elections as ``ludicrous'' and ``unjust'' and said
the government was attempting to ``force participation.''
   ``I urge black people in this diocese not to vote in the October
elections and I hope that white Anglicans would join their black
fellow Anglicans in that action,'' said Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize.
   ``I am aware of the penalties attached to this call. I am not
defying the government, I am obeying God,'' the black churchman
said.
   Whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race will hold
separate elections Oct. 26 to choose local officials. The black
majority has no vote in national affairs, although the nation's 26
million blacks make up about 75 percent of South Africa's
population.
   Under the 26-month-old state of emergency it is illegal to call
for an election boycott in South Africa. If convicted, violators
may be fined or imprisoned.
   In the 1984 municipal elections, anti-apartheid groups promoted
election boycotts and only about 10 percent of eligible black
voters went to the polls.
   Many black activists view black elected officials as
collaborators with the white-dominated government and its apartheid
policies of racial separation.
   Tutu said calling for an election boycott was a legitimate
``non-violent way of expressing our opposition to the evil and
injustice of apartheid.''
   ``You cannot get security through the barrel of a gun, nor
through the draconian and oppressive state of emergency,'' he said.
   Tutu spoke at a special service to install Canon Colin Jones as
dean of St. George's Cathedral. Jones, 37, becomes the first black
to serve in the post. He spent last year in Portland, Ore., and
most recently was the chaplin at the University of the Western
Cape, a mixed-race school.
   Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok has threatened to clamp
down on anti-apartheid clergymen.
   ``We must clip their wings _ as we clipped those of the 19
revolutionary and activist organizations,'' Vlok said on Friday in
reference to the government's February decision banning most
leading anti-apartheid groups.
   Anti-government church leaders were among the few prominent
resistence figures spared in the crackdown, and they now are the
most visible domestic opponents of the government.
   Mrs. Mandela called for increased economic sanctions in a speech
at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
   ``When we call for sanctions, when we call for disinvestment
from this country, it is because we are looking for those peaceful
measures as an alternative to the structural violence of the state
we see today,'' she said.
   Mrs. Mandela spoke to 400 people gathered to mark the
publication of a biography on her husband, jailed African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela. The book, entitled ``Higher Than
Hope,'' was written by South African academic Fatima Meer, who also
was present.
   The 70-year-old Mandela, South Africa's best known black leader,
is in a Cape Town clinic recuperating from tuberculosis.
   He has been imprisoned for 26 years and is serving a life
sentence for sabotage and attempting to overthrow the government.
The ANC is the major guerrilla group fighting white minority rule.
