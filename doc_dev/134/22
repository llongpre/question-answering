   Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged
churches once divided over apartheid to work together for a
peaceful future as he opened a church conference Monday.
   About 300 delegates from 90 churches are meeting in hopes of
reaching agreement on how to help South Africa move peacefully to a
non-discriminatory democracy. They will spend five days at the
National Conference of Churches, billed as the largest such meeting
to be held in South Africa.
   The conference in Rustenburg, 62 miles northwest of
Johannesburg, has brought together the white branch of the Dutch
Reformed Church with its black and mixed-race branches.
   The white Dutch Reformed Church, the main church of the
Dutch-descended Afrikaners who dominate the government, argued for
decades that the Bible supported apartheid. It has changed that
view and says it wants to merge with the other branches.
   The black and mixed-race branches have staunchly opposed
apartheid.
   Tutu, the Anglican archbishop who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize
for his anti-apartheid activism, called for reconciliation. ``We
come here not to engage in recrimination,'' he said in the opening
speech.
   ``In this land we are bound together by common humanity, by
having one God. The only way we will ever be able to survive, to be
free, to be human, is together, black and white,'' Tutu said.
   Khoza Mgogo, president of the South African Council of Churches,
urged delegates to adopt strategies for redistribution of wealth,
most of which is in the hands of the white minority.
   ``The beauty of the meeting is that we are bringing the whole
Christian community of South Africa together - the establishment
Afrikans churches and their anti-apartheid counterparts,'' the Rev.
Frank Chikane, a conference organizer, told the Sunday Times.
   ``For the first time there is the distinct possibility that the
Christian churches - representing 78 percent of the population -
can speak with one voice on apartheid and the country's future,''
he said.
   Two relatively small white churches that still support apartheid
- the Afrikaans Protestant Church and the Reformed Church - are not
attending.
   Many of the churches represented belong to the South African
Council of Churches, which often has been at the forefront of the
anti-apartheid movement. Chikane is the general secretary of the
council.
   The nation's church leaders met 30 years ago in an attempt to
forge a united front to challenge apartheid, but the agreement
collapsed when the Dutch Reformed Church rejected it.
   The current conference was organized after President F.W. de
Klerk urged church leaders to develop a common position on the role
they envision for the church in the future.
   De Klerk has said he wants to dismantle the apartheid system and
negotiate a new constitution that would allow the country's 5
million whites and 30 million blacks to share power.
   South Africa is predominantly Christian, with large numbers of
Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists, Zionists and Pentecostalists.
There also are many Jews and Moslems in the nation.
