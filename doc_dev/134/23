   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said
today he would try to persuade Western governments to break all
diplomatic ties with South Africa until it eased restrictions on
anti-apartheid groups.
   ``We want to tell the South African government that they do not
deserve to be part of a decent society,'' he said at a news
conference.
   Tutu said Western nations should cut any diplomatic links with
South Africa and expel South African diplomats from their countries.
   ``Britain and America and West Germany have kept saying that
sanctions hurt blacks and sanctions are not effective,'' he said.
``While not withdrawing my support for economic sanctions, I am
saying to Britain, West Germany and other Western countries, `Here
is your chance.'''
   Tutu was in the Kenyan capital for a meeting of the All-African
Conference of Churches, which he heads.
   He said he has called in the past for Western governments to
break relations with Pretoria. But he said this time he intended to
actively campaign for such a move.
   ``My own intention now is to challenge the West to break off
diplomatic relations with South Africa, to expel South African
diplomats from their countries until certain conditions are met,''
the churchman said.
   Those conditions are a lifting of the state of emergency,
reversal of a Feb. 25 ruling that outlawed political activity by 18
opposition groups, and the release of political detainees,
especially children.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, and other churchmen
were arrested Monday when they attempted to march on the South
African Parliament at Cape Town to protest the crackdown on black
opposition groups.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, also was arrested. In an interview with ``CBS
This Morning'' from Harare, Zimbabwe, he said it is clear that the
government now is outlawing ``all legitimate peaceful activity,''
and that apartheid opponents have no choice but to resist.
   ``And if that means confrontation, if that means disobedience to
your unjust laws then I think that is exactly what we mean,'' he
said. ``We are talking about the possibility of civil
disobedience.''
   He said non-violent protests have ended in deaths in the past
but won't be a deterrent to civil disobedience.
   ``We will have to take the risks that go with it and we will
have to take the consequences that follow these actions of ours,''
he said.
