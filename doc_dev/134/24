   Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Friday that
black South Africans would be disappointed by a Republican victory
in next week's presidential election.
   ``We would rather see a Democrat in the White House than a
Republican,'' Tutu said. ``We have suffered a great deal from the
Reagan administration's policy of constructive engagement.''
   Tutu, leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa and winner
of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, made the comments in Nairobi while
attending the annual conference of the All-Africa Council of
Churches.
   He is council president and chairman.
   Tutu did not mention either Democrat Michael Dukakis or
Republican George Bush by name. He also did not single out policies
advocated by either candidate that would be harmful or helpful to
blacks in South Africa.
   The Reagan administration preferred a policy on South Africa that
became known as constructive engagement _ dialogue with the
white-led Pretoria government rather than the diplomatic and
economic confrontational tactics pursued by former Democratic
President Jimmy Carter.
   Tutu said President Reagan's policy had failed.
   ``We are now virtually being ruled by martial law,'' he said.
   The archbishop said South African authorities had declared a
state of emergency three times during Reagan's tenure at the White
House. During that period, he said, more than 2,000 people were
killed, many by security forces.
   Tutu is a key activist against apartheid, the policy of racial
segregation under which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no
vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
