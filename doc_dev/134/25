   Black Anglican Archbishop
Desmond Tutu on Wednesday canceled a meeting with leaders of the
white Dutch Reformed Church after they described his challenge of
government policy as ``impious.''
   Tutu, a prominent foe of apartheid and winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize, had planned to meet the leaders in Pretoria Thursday
for the first formal talks between the two churches since 1960.
President P.W. Botha and most other government officials belong to
the Dutch Reformed Church, the largest denomination of the dominant
Afrikaner white minority.
   Tutu said he canceled the meeting because of an ``abusive
attack'' on his church in a statement issued Tuesday by Dutch
Reformed leaders and published Wednesday. He said the leaders
``deliberately sabotaged the talks.''
   Later Wednesday, Botha issued a statement asking Tutu to
repudiate the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla
movement. Tutu says he does not endorse the ANC's use of violence
but shares its professed goal of a non-racial democracy.
   ``The question must be posed whether you are acting on behalf of
the kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the ANC and the SACP
(South African Communist Party),'' Botha said.
   ``Are you in favor of the establishment of a Marxist
dictatorship in South Africa under the rule of the ANC and the
SACP, to the detriment of the church?''
   Tutu later met with Botha to urge clemency for the ``Sharpeville
Six'' _ a group of blacks scheduled to hang Friday for complicity
in a 1984 mob killing during anti-apartheid unrest.
   Tutu said Botha scolded him for taking a confrontational stance
toward the government.
   The archbishop said his decision to cancel the church meeting
was influenced by a ``background of unease'' related to the
scheduled hangings. He urged Dutch Reformed leaders to join
Anglican clergy in prayers for condemned prisoners.
   The Dutch Reformed leaders' statement referred to comments by
Tutu and the Rev. Allan Boesak, a mixed-race minister, at a church
service Sunday in Cape Town.
   Tutu and Boesak were protesting a recent government ban on
political activity by 19 organizations.
   Boesak, president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches,
and Tutu used strong language in responding to Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok's warnings that he will act against the
clergymen if they did not stop ``preaching revolution.''
   Boesak said the government ``signed its own death warrant. ...
No government can challenge the living God and survive.''
   Tutu said, ``If it is revolution to say I work for a South
Africa that is truly democratic ... I am for that.''
   The Dutch Reformed Church objected to the clergymen's
``language, convictions and veiled threats that do not breathe the
spirit of the Gospel.''
   It said it was ``not unsympathetic to the problems that churches
in this country have to contend with.'' But the statement called on
Boesak and Tutu ``to divorce themselves from this impious road and
to discuss their problems openly'' with Vlok and Botha ``who are
both avowed Christians.''
   Botha issued a statement Wednesday through the South African
Broadcasting Corp. saying the churches had to recognize ``certain
limitations in the execution of their prophetic task outside the
ecclesiastical field.''
   One major point of Boesak's and Tutu's sermons was to dispute
Vlok's statement that they were preaching revolution instead of the
Christian message.
   The Dutch Reformed statement appeared to agree with Vlok and
Botha.
   ``In exceeding these limits they have confronted the state, and
cannot equate themselves with the church in the face of state
retaliation,'' it said. ``The Church of Jesus Christ cannot be used
as a means for a revolutionary change of government.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
