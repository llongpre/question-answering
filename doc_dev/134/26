   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize for his struggle against apartheid in South Africa, has
called on a fellow Nobel laureate to join him in mediating the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
   Tutu made the offer to 1986 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Elie
Wiesel as he accepted an award Monday night from the Stephen Wise
Free Synagogue in Manhattan.
   ``The idea, I must say, did not come to me `cerebrally,' but in a
vision, because of its symbolic significance, as two men who have
been honored with the Nobel Peace Prize,'' Tutu said at the award
ceremony.
   He said he had not consulted with Wiesel, the author and
Holocaust survivor, before making his proposal. Wiesel was not in
the audience.
   Tutu said he supported Israel's right to territorial integrity
and condemned terrorism, ``But Israel is not infallible,
mercifully.''
   Tutu was honored by the synagogue ``for his leadership in the
struggle against apartheid and for the entire spectrum of civil and
human rights for all peoples.''
