   Archbishop Desmond Tutu denounced the
United States, Britain and West Germany for voting to block U.N.
resolutions calling for sanctions against South Africa because it
refuses to end apartheid.
   The black Anglican prelate told a U.N. committee Friday that
South Africa ``is able to cock a snoot (thumb its nose) to the
world ... because the South African government knows that when it
comes to the crunch, President Reagan, (British Prime Minister
Margaret) Thatcher and (West German) Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl will
use their veto to protect the South African government from the
consequences of its actions.
   ``We don't suggest that these worthies are racists,'' he said in
obvious sarcasm, ``but it is an academic distinction.''
   The Western countries say they deplore apartheid but think
sanctions hurt the black population and do not help end the system
of racial separation.
   The United States and Britain have veto power as permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council. West Germany does not have a
veto.
   Tutu addressed a meeting of the U.N. Special Committee against
Apartheid on the 25th anniversary of the committee's founding.
   South Africa has defied all United Nations resolutions
condemning apartheid and calling for independence for Namibia, or
South-West Africa. The South African ambassador recently stalked
out of the Security Council and said it could do its ``damndest''
to impose sanctions on his country.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his non-violent
efforts to end apartheid, called the system ``as evil, as immoral
as Nazism ever was.''
   ``Is it too much to ask that in the land of our birth, we walk
tall as human beings made in the image of God? ... To say we want
to be free?''
   Joining him were the Rev. Allan Boesak, also an anti-apartheid
leader in South Africa, and almost 20 speakers, who called for
renewed dedication to the peaceful abolition of apartheid.
   ``Help us,'' the archbishop appealed, ``because we want the
emergence of a new South Africa where black and white people would
live amicably together.
   ``Is it too much to ask to exert pressure to persuade the South
African government to come to the conference table?'' he asked.
   Apartheid by law and custom establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   He condemned the ban on 17 organizations and individuals opposed
to apartheid and also said the South African news media is severely
restricted and ``collaborates in self-censorship.''
