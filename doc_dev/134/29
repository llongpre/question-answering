   Archbishop Desmond Tutu
compared apartheid to Nazism during an emotional ceremony Friday in
which he was installed as chancellor of the country's most militant
university.
   The black Anglican leader, who returned Thursday from a month in
Europe and the United States, also defended his controversial
appeals for tougher Western sanctions against South Africa.
   ``The problem is not sanctions, the problem is apartheid,'' Tutu
told students and staff at the University of the Western Cape. ``I
want apartheid destroyed, not reformed. If it can be done away with
without sanctions, I will sing hallelujah.''
   Tutu's calls for punitive sanctions were covered extensively by
the South African media during his trip. His remarks have been
denounced not only by the government but also by white and black
moderates who contend that sanctions will increase black
unemployment without inducing whites to accept reforms.
   ``There are those who seek to generate hysteria,'' Tutu said of
his critics. ``The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide
a viable, non-violent alternative.''
   Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, was greeted by several hundred cheering students when he
arrived at the university's main hall before the ceremony.
   His aides had to form a human wall around him as they ushered
him through a crowd that chanted the archbishop's name and waved
placards with slogans like ``Viva Sanctions'' and ``Viva Tutu.''
   Tutu said he accepted the chancellorship on behalf of detainees,
political exiles, displaced blacks and other victims of ``this vile
and obscene system'' of apartheid.
   He said apartheid is ``so utterly evil, immoral, unbiblical and
unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil
system _ Naziism.''
   As chancellor at University of the Western Cape, Tutu will be
the honorary leader of a university that the government established
for mixed-race students in 1960 as part of its segregated
educational system.
   He praised the university, near Cape Town, as South Africa's
``most potent academic institutional dissident.''
   In the past decade, the university has increased its black
enrollment from a handful to 13 percent of the 11,500 students. Its
students and staff have grown increasingly militant in their
opposition to apartheid, under which the nation's black majority
has no voice in national affairs.
   The university's chief administrator, Rector Jakes Gerwel, says
the campus will be ``an intellectual home for the left.''
   Tutu has been the target of government wrath for years because
of his support of sanctions. Recently, the archbishop has drawn an
unprecedented degree of criticism from white liberals.
   Business Day, a Johannesburg newspaper often critical of the
government, said in a recent editorial that blacks should insist
that Tutu live in the same conditions as the poorest unemployed
black squatter.
