<HEAD>Tutu: Havard Should Divest Until South African Changes Are Made</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is a member
of Harvard University's governing board, urged the school to
withdraw its money from South Africa until promised changes are
made there.
   Tutu told reporters Sunday that he had asked the 30-member Board
of Overseers to sell off $139 million in investments in companies
that do business in South Africa. The money could be reinvested
once it becomes clear that reforms promised by President F.W. de
Klerk will take place, Tutu said.
   The Board of Overseers, to which the Anglican archbishop was
elected last June, had met earlier in the day in a closed session.
The board planned to further consider the divestment issue at a
later meeting.
   Last week, de Klerk said he would release jailed African
National Congress leader Nelson Mandela and lift government bans on
30 outlawed opposition groups.
   Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid
efforts, praised de Klerk for his announcement, but said actual
advancements would be decided by the South African Parliament.
   ``We'd like to see these things immediately, but let's be
realistic. The parliamentary session has just begun,'' he said.
``If (de Klerk) is playing games, they would be very odd games and
the world would know how to act.''
   When asked why he was in Massachusetts rather than in South
Africa at such a critical time, Tutu said, ``Harvard is Harvard.
The things that Harvard does and does not do have an impact far
beyond what you would expect from an educational institution.''
   Tutu ran for the Harvard board on an anti-apartheid slate and
was elected last June, along with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
and actor John Lithgow.
