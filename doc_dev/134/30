   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu of
South Africa charged that the United States, Britain and West
Germany support the white-led South African government and its
system of apartheid.
   ``Such big economic and financial interests are involved that
the South African government knows too well that, when compulsory
economic sanctions will be imposed by the United Nations, they will
be automatically vetoed by Washington, London and Bonn,'' the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize winner told a meeting of European
non-governmental organizations working for development.
   ``The South African government can do the worst things, because
it knows that it will be protected,'' the religious leader said on
Monday.
   Tutu called on European countries to suspend landings of South
Arican Airways planes, to limit South Africa's international
communications and to ban South African authorities from financial
markets.
