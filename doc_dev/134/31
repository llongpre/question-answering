   Pope John Paul II arrived in Harare
today on the first leg of a pilgrimage to five black-ruled nations
bordering racially-troubled South Africa.
   Before leaving Rome on the 10-day journey, the pontiff said he
hopes he can help solve some of white-led South Africa's problems
on a future trip there.
   His fourth journey to Africa and his 39th abroad will be to
Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique, Swaziland and Zimbabwe _ all
countries less than 20 years old that vehemently oppose South
Africa but depend on it for economic survival.
   In an unusual statement Friday, the Vatican emphasized the pope
was not snubbing South Africa and hoped to visit the country in the
future. It said the pope's full schedule on this trip made a stop
there impossible.
   The statement appeared directed at reports the pope had ruled
out a visit to South Africa, where a white minority rules 26
million blacks.
   During nearly 10 years at the helm of the Roman Catholic Church,
John Paul has strongly denounced apartheid.
   ``No system of apartheid or separate development will ever be
acceptable as a model for the relations between peoples or races,''
he said in a 1985 address in the Netherlands.
   In May, the pontiff received Anglican archbishop and 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize winner Desmond Tutu, who defiantly invited arrest and
prosecution Sunday by urging a boycott of Oct. 26 municipal
elections in South Africa.
   Tutu's challenge to the government came two days after the South
African law and order minister, Adriaan Vlok, said the time had
come to ``clip the wings'' of church leaders who hide behind the
``mask of liberation theology.'' Earlier this week, police armed
with a search warrant seized a tape of Tutu's sermon at the
archbishop's Cape Town office.
   When the pope greeted Tutu and other South African clergymen in
May, he said the system of racial segregation has exacted a
``terrible toll.'' Tutu urged tougher sanctions by Western nations
_ an issue on which the Vatican has not taken a position.
   South African Roman Catholic bishops, who have worked closely
with Anglicans, were waiting for the pope at his first stop in the
Zimbabwe capital of Harare. They are attending a conference of
regional bishops there.
   After a meeting with Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, the pope
planned to address the 71 bishops in a Dominican convent. The
speech, one of 42 drafted during a summer vacation in the
mountains, was expected to set the tone for the 12,400-mile voyage.
   In a document issued two years ago, the Vatican said it was
perfectly legitimate for the oppressed to take action _ such as
passive resistance _ to secure structures and institutions in which
their rights would be respected.
   But it warned clergy against direct involvement in politics and
against any efforts to inject Marxism into church work on behalf of
the poor.
