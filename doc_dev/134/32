   Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and other religious leaders called Sunday for a sweeping
campaign of defiance against new restrictions on opposition groups.
   Prominent clergy told their congregations that the church would
become more active in opposing apartheid now that the government
has banned political activity by 18 opposition groups. They called
for a church-led campaign against the latest crackdown.
   ``We have no option but to engage in activities that now are
prohibited,'' said the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the
South African Council of Churches.
   ``No matter what the consequences, we will continue to seek the
unbanning of democratic organizations and the transfer of power
from the white minority to all the people,'' Chikane told about 200
people at Central Methodist Church in Johannesburg.
   The government on Wednesday banned the 18 black-led groups from
political activity and placed restrictions on the activities of 18
senior black leaders.
   Church groups weren't included in the crackdown and
theoretically still were free to engage in resistance campaigns,
but most forms of peaceful protest still are banned under existing
regulations.
   The outlawing of the country's leading anti-apartheid groups,
most of them affiliated with the United Democratic Front coalition,
is viewed as a clear sign that the government intends to maintain a
hard line against all political opponents.
   Rev. Peter Storey, a prominent white minister and anti-apartheid
activist, compared the crackdown with the government's 1960
decision to outlaw the African National Congress guerrilla group
and the 1977 banning of 18 black political organizations.
   ``To do a third time what has failed twice is rank stupidity,''
Storey said at the Central Methodist service. ``What the government
has done flies in the face of history, exhibits a moral bankruptcy
and is a declaration of war on peace.''
   In Cape Town, Tutu said he would defy government laws he
considers unjust.
   ``Apartheid is evil, apartheid is immoral and apartheid is
un-Christian,'' Tutu told about 200 people at the Bonteheuwel
Anglican Church.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, described the South
African government as ``illegitimate'' and suggested church leaders
would initiate a civil disobedience campaign in coming days.
   None of the church leaders specified what activities they would
engage in, but there are several ongoing resistance campaigns that
were led by groups now restricted. Those include rent boycotts in
black townships, keeping track of dissidents under police
detention, and a push to restructure black education.
   Church services to express opposition the government's measures
also were held in Pretoria and Durban, the country's other leading
cities.
   Under South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation,
the nation's 5 million whites maintain political and economic
control over 26 million blacks, who have no vote in national
affairs.
