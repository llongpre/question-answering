   Police fired tear gas Wednesday to
disperse thousands of anti-apartheid protesters, including
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and stone-throwing crowds in several
townships outside Cape Town.
   Columns of black smoke from burning street barricades were
visible across the densely populated Cape Flats, northeast of the
city center.
   The unrest has occurred almost daily for more than three weeks,
coinciding with the launch of a nationwide campaign to defy
apartheid restrictions.
   The Cape Town area has been the most troubled section in the
country. The area has experienced the most sustained series of
confrontations between police and activists in two years.
   Police headquarters said officers encountered stone-throwing
youths in at least seven black and mixed-race communities near Cape
Town on Wednesday.
   Tutu said that if Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok ``does not
constrain his security forces, and if they behave the way they did
today, then we are on the brink of a major disaster.''
   Tutu, leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa, tried to
mediate between police officials and protesting youths in the black
township of Guguletu.
   The archbishop persuaded the youths to call off a planned march
from a high school to a police station, where they intended to
demand the release of several students and teachers detained in
recent weeks. Instead, Tutu arranged for a small delegation to go to
the station to present the demands.
   But police fired tear gas at Tutu, other clergymen, a white
opposition member of Parliament and hundreds of other people as they
emerged from a church where the archbishop had been reporting on the
latest developments.
   Tutu said the tear gas was fired without warning after he urged
the protesters to disperse peacefully.
   Police showed an ``incredible impatience and eagerness to use the
whole range of their armory,'' said Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize.
   He said he was surprised that youths ``were still listening to
community leaders who urged non-violence. If I was young, I would
not listen to Archbishop Tutu.''
   Police also used tear gas on several thousand marchers at the
University of the Western Cape, a militantly anti-government school
where most students are mixed-race.
   The marchers, including teachers, students and workers, were
fired at with tear gas as they reached the main gate of the campus,
leading out to a highway. The marchers carried placards supporting
the defiance campaign and criticizing police action against
activists.
   Organizers said further protests were planned to oppose the visit
to South Africa by an international rugby team, which activists say
is undermining the sports boycott imposed to protest apartheid. The
visiting team is scheduled to play South Africa's national team in
Cape Town on Saturday.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
