   Archbishop Desmond Tutu
inspected the bombed headquarters of the South African Council of
Churches on Friday, then prayed for those who planted the
explosives.
   Police later surrounded and entered the nearby Central Methodist
Church, where the black prelate gave a news conference and tried to
hold a private meeting with members of the church council staff.
   ``The only surprising thing is it took so long,'' Tutu said of
the bombing while a security police video team filmed him.
   An explosion before dawn Aug. 31 heavily damaged Khotso House,
where the council and several other anti-apartheid groups have
their offices. More than 20 people in the area suffered slight
injuries and the building was declared unsafe for further use.
   The council moved into Khotso House during Tutu's tenure as
general secretary 1978-1984. Tutu won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize
for his work against South Africa's apartheid policy of racial
discrimination and now heads the Anglican church in southern Africa.
   ``Foul, foul foul!'' Tutu muttered, bending under crumpled
doorways and crunching shattered glass beneath his feet during a
tour of three of the building's six floors.
   Tutu and the church council's current general secretary, the
Rev. Frank Chikane, entered through a balcony from a temporary
metal staircase over the wrecked main entrance.
   They went to each floor via the back fire escape because the
building's staircases were impassable. Walls were knocked down,
glass was broken and doors were blown out in every room.
   Surveying the elevator shaft, which apparently took the brunt of
the explosion, Tutu said: ``It was done by an expert.''
   He stepped on a small table as he entered his old office and it
collapsed, then a partition fell over next to him. ``I left this
office in better shape,'' he told Chikane.
   At the news conference, Tutu said ``the forces of darkness''
were behind the bombing and declared that ``the government, and its
supporters have tried before to destroy'' the council.
   When asked who he held was responsible, Tutu said: ``Sometimes I
amaze myself at how diplomatic I can be. But people who are wise,
like yourselves, know exactly who we mean.''
   Police have not reported significant progress in their
investigation. Anti-apartheid activists believe the attackers were
right-wing vigilantes or a covert security force unit.
   If the police make arrests in the case ``I will give them a
prize,'' Tutu said.
   Police allowed a crowd of blacks to sing and dance in the street
outside Khotso House for nearly an hour. Riot police moved in as
Tutu came out to deliver his prayer for the bombers but took no
action.
   Soon afterward, however, officers scuffled with a guard at the
door of the Methodist Church conference hall when he tried to keep
them out of the meeting.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
