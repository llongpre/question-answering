   Police today handcuffed and
arrested Trevor Tutu, son of Nobel Prize winner Desmond Tutu, for
failing to appear in court for traffic violations.
   The arrest came minutes after the 32-year-old son of the black
Anglican church leader faced a court on another charge.
   Tutu shouted at police during his arrest and urged his immediate
release. ``I have already been threatened with death,'' he told
reporters.
   The arrest came after he appeared in Kempton Park Magistrate's
Court because of remarks he allegedly made to police Dec. 31 when
they told him not to leave his luggage unattended at an airport.
   Police have not said what remarks he may have made, and the court
case was postponed until Feb. 15.
   As Tutu left the courthouse, police handcuffed and arrested him
on charges of failing to appear in court for three traffic
violations. He was then taken to Johannesburg Magistrate's Court.
   While he was being arrested, Tutu called one superintendent a
``stupid hooligan.''
   He was questioned at the second courthouse and taken to police
headquarters for investigation of other possible charges. He told
reporters he intended bringing an urgent court action for his
release and protection from possible police violence.
   Trevor Tutu is the eldest of four children of Archbishop Tutu,
leader of the Anglican Church in southern Africa and winner of the
1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid campaigning.
   In 1984, Trevor Tutu was held by police for three days before he
being cleared of a charge of drunken driving. In 1985, he was
briefly detained after arguing with police at a courthouse about the
detention of black children.
   The Dec. 31 incident began when police told him not to leave his
luggage unattended at Jan Smuts Airport.
   Police have warned South Africans not to leave parcels and
luggage unattended in public places because of a bombing campaign by
anti-government guerrillas, which has killed 35 people and injured
more than 660 in the past 2{ years.
