   Desmond Tutu, the Anglican archbishop
of South Africa, said Sunday his country's racial policies would
change immediately if the United States and other Western nations
demanded it.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his active
opposition to South Africa's segregation policies known as
apartheid, said his nation's racial policies are maintained because
of ``immense economic interests'' by Western governments.
   ``If the United States and the Western countries wanted,
apartheid would end tomorrow,'' Tutu said at a news conference.
   ``Some actions taken by the Western government have a background
of racism,'' Tutu told reporters. ``They say that dollars are more
important than people, especially when those people are black.''
   Tutu and six other Anglican officials arrived in Panama Saturday
from Nicaragua, where they toured the country for five days. They
leave Panama on Tuesday.
   In Managua Saturday, the clerics issued a statement backing the
leftist Sandinista government's recent reforms and called on the
U.S. government to help resettle the 11,000 Nicaraguan rebels in
Honduras.
   An agreement signed Feb. 14 by five Central American presidents
sought to disband the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. The
Contras have been supported by the U.S. government since 1981.
   The Anglican officials are visiting at the invitation of the Rev.
Sturdie Downs, bishop of Nicaragua's Episcopal Church.
   Edmond Browning, Anglican primate in the United States, said he
accepted the invitation after hearing about ``the horrible pain and
suffering of the people in these countries.''
   The religious leaders were scheduled to meet Monday with Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, head of the nation's security forces.
   The U.S. government imposed sanctions against Panama in April
1988 to force the fall of Noriega, the country's de facto ruler. A
court in Florida has indicted Noriega on charges of drug trafficking.
   The U.S. sanctions have seriously damaged Panama's economy.
