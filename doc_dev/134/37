<HEAD>Archbishop Denounces Police Response to Bomb Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>

   Archbishop Desmond Tutu
criticized police Monday for suggesting that a bomb blast at the
headquarters of several anti-apartheid groups was caused by
explosives stored in the building.
   Police officials made the suggestion last week following the
Aug. 31 explosion that wrecked Khotso House, a six-story office
building in Johannesburg used by the South African Council of
Churches and several human rights groups.
   Police said investigators had been unable to get through the
rubble to the section of an underground garage where the bomb was
believed to have been placed.
   But they suggested explosives were being stored in the building
for use elsewhere. Building occupants said they believe the bombers
were right-wing extremists or even security force members.
   ``The police have implied that those who work in Khotso House
are perpetrators of violence,'' said Tutu, leader of the Anglican
church in southern Africa.
   ``It is an absolutely disgraceful suggestion to make, and it is
made worse by the fact the police have made it without a tittle of
evidence and before doing any proper investigation,'' Tutu said in
a statement.
   ``We are still waiting to hear the government's clear
condemnation of the bombing.''
   He said the bombing should be viewed in the context of a claim
by military commanders last week that the army was beyond the
jurisdiction of the courts because South Africa was in a state of
war.
   On Sunday, Tutu deliberately defied a government ban on calls
for voting boycotts, urging blacks and whites to stay away from the
polls in next month's nationwide municipal elections.
   State-of-emergency regulations provide for a jail sentence of up
to 10 years for promoting election boycotts.
   A Law and Order Ministry spokesman, Brig. Leon Mellet, said the
text of Tutu's speech would be studied. He declined to comment on
possible action against the black archbishop, who won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1984.
   Whites, blacks, Asians and people of mixed-race will hold
separate elections Oct. 26 to choose local officials.
   Many anti-apartheid activists oppose black participation in any
local or regional elections as long as blacks are excluded from
national elections.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no vote in national
affairs, although the 26 million blacks make up about 75 percent of
South Africa's population.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
