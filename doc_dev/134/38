   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa on Monday
renewed his call for increased U.S. pressure to end apartheid in
his country.
   ``What must still happen?'' to prompt the American government to
act, Tutu asked repeatedly in a commencement address at Emory
University.
   ``All the things you hold dear in this land are undermined,
destroyed, held in small account (in South Africa),'' he told the
graduates.
   Tutu dismissed arguments that economic sanctions against South
Africa only hurt black South Africans, questioning the motives of
``those who suddenly decide they feel sorry for black people.''
   Tutu further criticized U.S. news coverage of South Africa,
especially since the government there moved to limit coverage of
protests.
   ``Media in this land, with a few notable exceptions, have shown
extraordinary timidity,'' Tutu said. He said American readers do
not see the newspaper stories which appear in South Africa
detailing the injustices of apartheid.
   Tutu also made an apparent reference to a controversy at Emory
over the dismissal last fall of a black professor who was denied
tenure. Supporters of the teacher, Sondra O'Neal, demonstrated on
the campus Sunday and distributed fliers Monday protesting alleged
racism at the school.
   Tutu said Emory ``has a good record'' of seeking racial justice
in the United States and around the world.
   ``One would want to be equally concerned about similar issues
here,'' he added. ``... It is critical for this institution, with
which I am honored to be associated, to show a zeal to eradicate
something which could be a stumbling block.''
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, received an honorary
doctor of divinity degree during the commencement program.
