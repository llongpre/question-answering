<HEAD>Black Archbishop Tutu Meets Noriega In Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South
Africa met Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Monday and said he asked
Noriega if he would guarantee freedom of the press, free elections
and human rights in Panama.
   Tutu indicated that Noriega responded positively to the requests
made by him and his delegation of Anglican leaders, but Tutu did not
answer reporters' questions about Noriega's answers.
   As chief of Defense Forces, Noriega is Panama's de facto leader.
He was not available to speak with reporters after the one-hour
private meeting.
   Tutu, the black prelate who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for
his efforts against South Africa's racial segregation policies,
spoke briefly with reporters.
   Panama has elections scheduled for May 7 to elect a new president
and two vice presidents. Panamanians also will elect all 67 members
of the National Assembly and 510 municipal officials.
   Noriega is not a candiate for president.
   The U.S. government imposed sanctions against Panama last year,
throwing this country's economy into serious disarray, in an effort
to force Noriega to quit as military chief after a U.S. grand jury
indicted him on drug trafficking and money laundering charges.
Noriega denied the charges.
   Tutu and his fellow Anglican leaders visited Nicaragua for five
days before arriving in Panama on Saturday. Tutu returns to South
Africa on Tuesday.
