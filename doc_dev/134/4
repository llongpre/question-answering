   Archbishop Desmond Tutu won a seat
Thursday on a Harvard University governing board, striking a blow
for forces opposed to the school's $163.8 million investment in
companies doing business in South Africa.
   ``I ... pray God I will do justice to the honor that has been
given me,'' Tutu said, speaking from South Africa.
   The 1984 Nobel Prize-winner, who promised a year ago to return
honorary degrees to any schools that had not divested such holdings
by May 1989, said he would not return the diploma Harvard conferred
on him 10 years ago.
   Instead, the South African Anglican prelate will use his new spot
on the Board of Overseers to lobby against apartheid and for
divestment, said Tutu spokesman John Allen.
   ``This is really big news,'' said Robert Wolff, director of
Harvard-Radcliffe Alumni Against Apartheid. ``I feel very confident
that once (Tutu) arrives there will be enormous pressure on Harvard
to divest.''
   Tutu's victory was the only one claimed by the pro-divestment
coalition, which ran four other candidates against an official slate
of 10 people backed by the Harvard Alumni Association.
   Actor John Lithgow and U.S. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, both
endorsed by the alumni assocation, were the top vote-getters in the
write-in election open to all Harvard degree holders.
   Tutu came in fourth with 14,226 of the votes cast by 39,897
people, who elected five officials to serve six-year terms on the
30-member board. The panel monitors the university's academic
policies and advises the Harvard Corporation, which manages the
school's business affairs.
   Since 1986, the Harvard-Radcliffe anti-apartheid group has
nominated candidates to the 30-member overseers panel by petition
and has succeeded in placing three members on the board.
   The campaign was more heated than any in recent years, with the
alumni association and university officials speaking out against
electing ``single issue'' candidates.
   But Wolff, a professor of philosophy at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, said he was optimistic Tutu's presence on
the panel would encourage other ``progressive'' board members to
join the push for divestment in South Africa.
   ``There are a large number of progressive board members who would
feel comfortable rallying to Tutu's standard,'' Wolff said. ``In his
presence he will be the moral center of the board on this issue.''
   Wolff said it was not immediately clear when Tutu would come to
Cambridge to meet with the board, but predicted that ``when he
comes, thousands of people will turn out support him.''
