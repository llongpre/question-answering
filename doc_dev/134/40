   Archbishop Desmond Tutu told
students that apartheid is ``so utterly evil, immoral, unbiblical
and unchristian that it can only be compared with that equally evil
system _ Nazism.''
   At his installation Friday as chancellor of the University of
the Western Cape, the nation's most militant university, the black
Anglican clergman also defended his appeals for tough Western
sanctions against South Africa.
   ``The onus is on those who oppose sanctions to provide a viable,
non-violent alternative,'' said the prelate, who is the Anglican
spiritual leader for all of southern Africa and winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize.
   Tutu said he accepted the position of chancellor on behalf of
detainees, political exiles, displaced blacks and other victims of
``this vile and obscene system'' of apartheid, the country's race
segregation system under which the black majority has no voice in
national affairs.
   The prelate returned home Thursday from a month in Europe and
the United States during which he asked for punitive sanctions
against this country.
   The calls were widely covered here in the news media and
denounced not only by the government but by white and black
moderates who say sanctions will increase black unemployment
without inducing whites to accept reforms.
   ``The problem is not sanctions, the problem is apartheid,'' Tutu
said Friday. ``I want apartheid destroyed, not reformed. If it can
be done away with without sanctions, I will sing hallelujah.''
   Tutu was greeted by hundreds of cheering students upon his
arrival.
   As chancellor at the University of the Western Cape, Tutu will
be the honorary leader of a university that the government
established for mixed-race students in 1960 as part of its
segregated educational system.
