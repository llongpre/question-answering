   Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
some African National Congress leaders said Sunday they will meet
Secretary of State James Baker III when he visits South Africa this
week, even though ANC leader Nelson Mandela criticized the trip.
   ``If the secretary of state wants to see me, of course I'll see
him. But I will not meet him in South Africa,'' Mandela said
Saturday after returning from a five-nation tour. During his trip,
he called on foreign governments to cut all diplomatic ties with
the Pretoria government.
   Baker, who flies to neighboring Namibia on Monday, has invited
Mandela to a meeting there. Both men will be attending celebrations
of the South African colony's independence. Mandela has indicated
he will accept that invitation.
   The U.S. official then intends to fly to Cape Town on Thursday
to meet with President F.W. de Klerk and black leaders.
   ``We do not want any high-profile visits to South Africa because
these can result in a lot of confusion,'' Mandela said Saturday.
``They suggest that President de Klerk has done something positive,
something fundamental which requires the world to review sanctions
and other strategies, which we have invited in order to increase
pressure on South Africa.''
   De Klerk freed Mandela last month after he served 27 years in
prison for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white government.
The president also legalized the ANC and other anti-apartheid
groups.
   Walter Sisulu, a member of the ANC's national executive and a
close friend of Mandela, said Sunday night he had received an
invitation to meet Baker in Soweto, outside Johannesburg, but would
be unable to accept it because he will be in London.
   However, he said ANC leaders Govan Mbeki and Raymond Mhlaba, who
were imprisoned with Mandela for plotting to overthrow the
government, will meet with the secretary of state.
   Asked to explain why ANC leaders would meet with Baker inside
the country after Mandela's comments, Sisulu said the issue had not
thoroughly been discussed earlier. In any case, he said, Mandela's
meetings are considered different from those of the other black
leaders.
   Tutu, the Anglican archbishop of Cape Town who won the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize, said he expected to meet Baker, probably in Cape
Town, although the meeting hadn't been confirmed.
   Regarding Mandela's statement, Tutu said: ``I appreciate the
necessity for political leaders to keep foreign governments under
pressure to take a firm stand against apartheid.''
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
