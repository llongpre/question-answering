   Mother Teresa ended a one-week trip
to South Africa today with a visit to a vast black squatter camp,
and a pro-government newspaper praised her for declining to discuss
politics during her stay.
   The 78-year-old nun, winner of the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize,
visited an old age home, a church and a high school in Winterveld, a
shantytown of 500,000 blacks north of Pretoria in the nominally
independent black homeland of Bophuthatswana.
   At each stop, Mother Teresa was welcomed by cheering crowds and
gave brief speeches urging people to love one another.
   At the start of her visit, Mother Teresa told reporters she would
not become involved in political debate and added: ``I did not know
that something like apartheid existed.''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no say in
national affairs.
   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg daily, praised Mother
Teresa for not making political statements and said she was more
worthy of praise than Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, also winner
of the Nobel Peace Prize. It described Tutu as a ``political priest
whose pronouncements cause division.''
