<HEAD>Pope Urges `Only Peaceful Means' To Fight Apartheid</HEAD>

   Pope John Paul II on Friday urged Christians
in South Africa to reject violence in fighting apartheid, which he
said had exacted a ``terrible toll.''
   ``I pray that the Christian communities in South Africa will
continue to foster only peaceful means of responding to the
difficulties of the present situation,'' the pope said in remarks
to a visiting delegation of South African churchmen, including
Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   The pope restated his and the Roman Catholic Church's opposition
to all forms of racial discrimination, adding that a change in the
structures of discrimination requires ``a change of hearts.''
   The 10-member delegation was a joint group of the South African
Council of Churches and the Southern African Catholic Bishops'
Conference.
   In their address to the pope, the church officials said recent
government actions in South Africa have ``resulted in bitterness,
resentment and frustration _ feelings which can easily lead to
violence.''
   They said an emergency meeting of church leaders will be held in
Johannesburg on May 30.
   ``The emergency convocation will develop effective non-violent
action to put pressure on the South African government to sit at
the negotiating table and for the church to refuse to collaborate
with the unjust system,'' the delegation said in a news statement.
   At a news conference, Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said the
pope was making an ``eloquent statement'' by not visiting South
Africa during his tour of four African nations next September.
   ``It speaks to the perpetrators of apartheid, it speaks to the
victims,'' he said.
   Tutu called for tougher sanctions by Western nations against the
South African government.
   ``If we do not apply sanctions, or if sanctions are ineffective,
what is effective?,'' he said. ``If you say sanctions will fail or
have failed, than you can tell us what will succeed...then the very
last last option available is violence and we have consistently
expressed our opposition to violence... So we say, `help us.' ''
   He criticized Japan for its trade links with South Africa.
   ``We hope that the Japanese would be embarassed that they have
stepped into a vacuum,'' he said. ``I hope the Japanese will
remember that they were insulted in South Africa when the
government was enforcing racial classification. Because they wanted
the Japanese as traders, they called them `honorary Europeans.' I
would hope they would get so upset, they would go back home.''
