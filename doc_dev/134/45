   Archbishop Desmond Tutu, his wife
and 34 other activists were arrested today as they began a march
protesting the alleged beating of clergy and church workers during
an anti-apartheid protest.
   The Anglican archbishop, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize,
was angered by reports that police earlier today had severely beaten
about 20 protesters from the Western Province Council of Churches.
   The clerics and churchworkers said police used batons and whips
to chase them from a security police office in Cape Town, where they
had gone to condemn recent detentions of activists.
   Later, when Tutu and the other activists left St. George's
Cathedral to begin a protest march, they encountered police who
formed a human barricade. Police told the demonstrators to disperse,
then led them into vans when they refused.
   The marchers carried placards with slogans such as ``To Hell With
Restrictions!'' and ``Stop Killing Our People!''
   Canon Winston Ndungane, chief executive officer of Anglican
Church in South Africa, said Tutu's arrest was ``a further
indication that the authorities will use whateverwork stoppages at their
factories to protest a labor law which they say cripples their power
to strike.
   One of the biggest union protests was at a Unilever Ltd. factory
in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, where 1,000 workers marched
around the premises, many carrying placards denouncing the year-old
Labor Relations Amendment Act.
   The two main black labor federations on Thursday called on their
1.5 million members to stage protests against the act, which limits
the ability of workers to strike, during work hours today.
   The federations also joined other major anti-apartheid groups in
calling for a national protest on Tuesday and Wednesday against the
segregated parliamentary elections on Wednesday. In the past, such
protests have taken the form of a general strike.
   The same organizations have been orchestrating a campaign since
early August to challenge segregation laws and mobilize opposition
to the elections.
   On Saturday, activists plan to attempt an illegal march toward
the Parliament buildings in Cape Town, and on Sunday blacks plan to
hold a mass picnic on a whites-only beach in Durban.
   Police have arrested or detained scores of activists in the past
week and have banned at least two protest rallies planned for this
weekend, including a ``peace service'' in Soweto which was to be
addressed by Tutu.
   The Detainees Aid Center, which assists families of detainees,
said two black activists were detained Thursday in Soweto when they
made their daily appearance at a police station in accordance with
restrictions imposed when they were released from a previous stint
in detention.
   On Cape Town's outskirts, where police and militant youths have
clashed daily for several weeks, several mixed-race students
reportedly were wounded today when officers fired tear gas and
birdshot to disperse a rally.
   The independent South African Press Association quoted a teacher
as saying several students were arrested.
   Police said three mixed-race men were injured Thursday night when
a small mine exploded at a civic center in Athlone, near Cape Town.
There was no claim of responsibility.
   Police headquarters said five black men were found dead from
bullet wounds at a house in Natal Province. Much of the province has
been wracked by a three-year power stuggle pitting supporters of
militant anti-apartheid groups against members of the more
conservative Zulu political organization Inkatha.
