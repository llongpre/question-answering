   With secular anti-apartheid
groups effectively silenced, clergymen have sharpened their attacks
on the white-led government and rekindled a longstanding
church-state conflict.
   Spared in recent government crackdowns, activist church leaders
represent one of the few prominent opposition forces operating
without restrictions.
   In recent weeks, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other
clergymen have organized and led demonstrations, issued harsh
anti-government statements, focused sermons on political themes and
dared authorities to act against them.
   ``The churches have been pushed to the front line of the
struggle,'' said the Rev. Alan Boesak, president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches. ``We have always protested against
apartheid. We must now go over to participate in the resistance
against apartheid.''
   Although President P.W. Botha's National Party government has
refrained from clamping down on the clergymen, it has attempted to
undercut the credibility of Tutu, Boesak and other prominent
ministers.
   Botha regularly refers to South Africa as a country guided by
Christian principles, yet pointedly tells anti-apartheid clergymen
they have no business in politics.
   In recent letters to activist church leaders, Botha said the
clergymen ``love and praise'' the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement, ``with its Marxist and atheistic
ideology.''
   ``You embrace and participate in their call for violence,
hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution,'' Botha said. ``The
question must be posed whether you are acting on behalf of the
kingdom of God or the kingdom promised by the ANC.''
   ``I work for God's kingdom,'' replied Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize. ``For whose kingdom, with your apartheid policy,
do you work for?''
   At one point, the Anglican church threatened to sue Botha,
saying his statements were defamatory.
   ``I would like that,'' responded Botha. ``Then the government
will come forward with all the knowledge and facts it has at its
disposal.''
   Botha did not elaborate.
   The long-simmering, church-state feud began to boil over after
the government on Feb. 24 banned 18 leading anti-apartheid
organizations from participating in politics. Church leaders
marched on Parliament on Feb. 29 to protest the ban, and 25
clergymen, including Tutu, were briefly arrested.
   In early March, church leaders formed the Committee for the
Defense of Democracy in a bid to fill the void created by the
government crackdown. But within days, Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok barred the new organization from ``performing any
activities or acts whatsoever.''
   Boesak reported March 11 that his house had been stoned and that
he had received death threats. He said that if anything happened to
him ``suspicion should fall on the South African government and the
police.''
   Two weeks later, police searched the home of a Catholic bishop,
Edward Adams, and confiscated documents related to local
organizations in the southern Cape Province.
   ``The state is intent on an open confrontation with the
church,'' the Southern African Catholic Bishops Conference said in
a statement condemning the search.
   Anglican bishops, backed by Archbishop of Canterbury Robert
Runcie in Britain, declared the government had ``launched a
carefully planned attack'' on Tutu, Boesak and others, ``aimed at
portraying them as Marxists and isolating them from their churches
as a prelude to state action against them.''
   However, Botha's verbal attacks on activist clergy have won
support from sectors of the white community, including the Dutch
Reformed Church, the largest white denomination.
   In this deeply religious country, the Dutch Reformed Church has
long had close links to the government and maintained until 1986
that apartheid was justified in the Bible.
   Apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the
25.6 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The 5 million
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts, schools
and health services.
   Dutch Reformed leaders said recently that black clergy do not
represent the Christian church when they confront the state. The
leaders called on Tutu and Boesak to ``divorce themselves from this
impious road and to discuss their problems openly'' with Botha and
Vlok, ``who are both avowed Christians.''
   The anti-apartheid clergy are denounced frequently in letters to
the editor in the pro-government newspapers.
   ``These men are doing Satan's work,'' said one recent letter in
The Citizen, a Johannesburg daily. ``It is hoped that these
troublemakers are dealt with, and not to worry about the cloth they
wear.''
   But the criticism appears only to have strengthened the
ministers' resolve to confront the government.
   ``The government of South Africa has signed its own death
warrant,'' Boesak said in a recent sermon in Cape Town. ``No
government can challenge the living God and survive.''
   ``I am not going to allow this government to choose my friends
for me,'' Tutu said at the same service. ``If teaching the gospel
of Jesus Christ is going to lead me into trouble, tough luck.''
