   Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu today praised an 18-year-old white man who has been sentenced
to six years in prison for refusing to serve in the armed forces.
   Charles Bester was convicted and sentenced Monday, becoming the
second conscientious objector to receive the maximum six-year
sentence since a recent toughening of penalties for draft resisters.
   Bester told the court his Christian beliefs did not allow him to
perform military service because he felt the armed forces were used
to uphold apartheid. Dozens of supporters, including many young
blacks, attended the court session, and several were threatened with
contempt charges after they sang an anti-apartheid anthem.
   Tutu, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who is the first black to head
the Anglican church in Southern Africa, said of Bester in a
statement: ``We believe your cause to be right. Be strong and of
good courage.''
   ``We are certain that justice and righteousness will overcome
evil oppression and we shall all be free, black and white
together,'' Tutu said. ``Your decision brings that glorious day
closer.''
   Tutu's statement was read at a news conference attended by
Besters' parents, who expressed full support for their son.
   Earlier this year, David Bruce, 25, was sentenced to six years in
prison for refusing military service, and Dr. Ivan Toms, who
completed his initial 2-year military service in 1979, was sentenced
to 21 months in jail for refusing to report for a call-up camp.
   Military service is compulsory for white males in South Africa
and voluntary for other races. The government has banned the End
Conscription Campaign, a nationwide group opposed to mandatory
military service.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no vote in national
affairs. The white minority controls the economy has separate
districts and health services.
