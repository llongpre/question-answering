   Archbishop Desmond Tutu on
Sunday prayed with and encouraged blacks threatened with eviction
from this fishing town, hundreds of miles from the nearest area
where they can live legally.
   The church service concluded a two-day visit by the Anglican
leader to a windswept, treeless plain outside Port Nolloth, about
400 miles north of Cape Town. About 500 blacks live in 90 tents in
the remote town.
   ``God is on your side, and God cannot ultimately be defeated,''
Tutu told the congregation. ``That is why those who oppress you
have already lost.''
   The tent dwellers, who were served with eviction notices in
January, are fighting the order in court.
   Under South Africa's segregation laws, blacks have no legal
right to live in this sparsely populated region called Namaqualand,
which stretches along the Atlantic Coast to the border with
South-West Africa.
   The nearest official black township is in Upington, more than
300 miles east.
   Tutu arrived Saturday on his first visit to the desolate camp
whose residents collect water in barrels and use portable outhouses.
   About 100 women, some with babies on their backs, led the black
archbishop and his wife, Leah, through the rows of tents.
   While Tutu conferred with community leader Lingington Sonqishe
in a corrugated metal shack, a crowd outside sang in praise of Tutu
and Oliver Tambo, president of the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla group fighting apartheid.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no voice
in national affairs, which are controlled by the 5 million whites.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his campaign
against the policy of segregation, said he was dismayed at the
living conditions but impressed with the determination of the
residents.
   ``I want to express admiration for the people here, at the
extraordinary resilience and the strength of their commitment to
stand for their rights,'' Tutu said. ``One is humbled, really, to
see how people refuse to be manipulated and intimidated.''
   Many of the Port Nolloth blacks, who work in mines or with the
fishing industry, have been in the area for 10 years. Initially,
they lived with mixed-race people in a shantytown that was
demolished.
   The mixed-race population was given new housing, while most of
the blacks fled to South-West Africa, which is ruled by South
Africa. Authorities there forced them back into South Africa in
1986, and the blacks believed the government was going to allow
them to stay permanently.
   A legal battle has been waged since then, with the next court
session scheduled Nov. 9.
   ``They were given the promise that they would have houses built
for them,'' Tutu said. ``The town council is reneging on that
promise. Their only sin is that they have black skin.''
   If the tents are demolished, Sonqishe said, the residents would
live outdoors ``like monkeys and baboons. Then the whole world will
see the suffering.''
   Tutu's visit to Port Nolloth was covered by crews from
Independent Television Network and Visnews, two London-based
television news agencies. ITN's bureau chief, Mike Wills, said
security police seized the film when it arrived at a small airport
near Johannesburg Sunday afternoon. The officers said they were
acting under state-of-emergency regulations, Wills said.
