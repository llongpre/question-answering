   Archbishop Desmond Tutu offered a public vote
of confidence Tuesday for James A. Baker III, saying the new
secretary of state is open to new ideas and ``not dogmatic'' in
discussions with church leaders pressing for sanctions against the
white-ruled government of South Africa.
   ``I don't want to be euphoric, but we certainly have been
impressed,'' said the Nobel Peace Prize winner, who flew to
Washington for the early-evening meeting between Baker and a
delegation sponsored by the World Council of Churches.
   Tutu said Baker made no promises, but indicated the new
administration is reviewing its policy toward South Africa.
   Asked to compare his first meeting with Baker and past sessions
with former Secretary of State George Shultz, Tutu said:
   ``I was very impressed by the fact that he was not dogmatic, he
actually was discussing with the group and was interested in any
initiative that the United States might actively take to pressure
the South African government to the negotiating table.''
   ``They are ... involved in a review process. He did not dismiss
us, he listened to us with very considerable interest,'' Tutu said
after the half-hour session at the State Department.
   Tutu joined a delegation that has been on a three-week tour of
the United States, several West European capitals and Japan to
convince government officials to take a stronger stand against South
Africa and its policy of apartheid.
   The archbishop said the delegation asked Baker to consider the
imposition of more economic sanctions against South Africa as a
means of pressuring the white-rule government to abolish apartheid.
   Tutu stressed, however, the real appeal to Baker was made as an
appeal against racial injustice.
   ``More than anything else, the call of the delegation (was) that
the United States had to take a moral leadership in what is a moral
issue facing the world,'' Tutu said.
   In 1986, Congress imposed sanctions against South Africa despite
a veto by then-President Reagan, putting in place a ban on new loans
and investments, a prohibition of the importation of South African
coal and other materials, and halting direct U.S.-South African air
links.
   The group of church leaders, formally known as the Eminent Church
Persons Group of the World Council of Churches, is composed of
Metropolitan Paulos Mr Gregorios, India; Rev. Canaan Banana,
Zimbabwe; Elaine Hesse Greif, New Zealand, World YWCA general
secretary; Lysaneas Maciel, Brazil, Brazil National Assembly federal
deputy and Ministry of Labor legal counselor; Lucille Mair,
Trinidad, University of the West Indies; Rev. Carl Mau, Washington,
D.C., former Lutheran World Federation general secretary.
