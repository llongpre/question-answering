   The United States and Iraq should avert war
in the Persian Gulf by talking out their differences, South African
Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Saturday.
   ``People must make it more and more clear that we are
peacemongers, because peace is so sensible. It's so much more
sensible than war,'' said the Anglican prelate, who won the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize for his opposition to South African apartheid.
   At a news conference, Tutu also urged the United States to
continue its economic sanctions against South Africa ``until the
process of dismantling apartheid is irreversible.''
   Apartheid is South Africa's official police of racial
segregation and discrimination against non-whites.
   Although South Africa's President F.W. de Klerk deserves credit
for some reform, ``the pillars of apartheid still stand firmly in
place,'' Tutu said.
   Tutu came to this ity of 24,000 people to help raise
scholarship money for South African students abroad and for
American Indian students in Montana.
   Tutu heads the 2.6 million-member Anglican Church of Southern
Africa. This was his only scheduled stop in North America while en
route to a convocation in Honduras.
   The visit was arranged by the Montana Logging and Ballet
Company, a Helena-based quartet that mixes music, comedy and satire
to promote political and social causes.
   Tutu wrote liner notes for the group's latest album after
hearing it perform an anti-apartheid song, ``Take the Barriers
Down,'' in 1987.
