   Religious leaders who were barred
from holding an anti-apartheid rally led more than 2,000 people in
a defiant church service at a cathedral that was surrounded by
police vehicles.
   ``The government of South Africa has signed its own death
warrant,'' said the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches. ``No government can challenge the
living God and survive.''
   Boesak's speech electrified a multiracial crowd at the Sunday
service and was punctuated by shouts of ``Amandla!'' the Zulu word
for ``power.''
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1984 for his fight against South Africa's system of racial
separation, also spoke to the worshipers who packed the aisles of
St. George's Anglican Cathedral.
   Organizers said many people trying to go to the service were
turned back at police roadblocks on highways leading to central
Cape Town.
   The church service was arranged after police prohibited a rally
that had been planned at the nearby University of the Western Cape.
   Police also banned the 5-day-old committee, whose members
included Tutu and Boesak, that was sponsoring the rally.
   The Cape Town service and others in major cities were called to
protest government restrictions on opposition groups and the
detention of thousands of people without charge during a 21-month
national state of emergency.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok on Sunday warned the
white-led government would ``take the necessary steps'' against
clergymen who took up the cause of 18 black opposition groups
banned in a crackdown last month.
   ``If teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ is going to lead me
into trouble, tough luck,'' responded Tutu.
   Referring to Vlok's warning that clergymen should preach the
``true Christian message rather than revolution,'' Boesak said:
   ``If you had read the Bible you would not have spoken such utter
nonsense. ... The fight for justice is the Christian message.''
   In another development, Tutu wrote an article in today's
editions of The New York Times calling on the United States,
England and West Germany to cut diplomatic ties with South Africa
unless it meets three demands.
   ``First, the state of emergency must be lifted,'' he wrote.
``Second, last month's restrictions against our peoples'
organizations and leaders must be lifted. Third, detainees ... must
be tried in open courts or released.''
   Boesak, who reported receiving two death threats in the past two
weeks, told worshipers Sunday, ``It does not matter whether they
ban us, threaten us, or kill us in jail _ the church of South
Africa has decided we have work to do.
   ``We must tell (President) P.W. Botha, `Your days are over,' ''
he said.
   Tutu told the service, ``If it is revolution to say, `I work for
a South Africa that is truly democratic, where black, white and
yellow and green can walk together hand in hand,' then friends, I
am for that.''
