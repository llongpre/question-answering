   A fire set by arsonists damaged
a university building today where the annual Desmond Tutu Peace
Lecture was to be delivered, police and student leaders said.
   The building, which was painted with anti-Tutu slogans, also
houses the offices of a multiracial, anti-apartheid organization.
The offices were heavily damaged by the fire and files were stolen,
police said.
   A detonator, fuse and a flammable liquid were used to set fire to
the offices of the National Union of South African Students in the
building at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg,
police said.
   Sprinklers doused the fire, but flooded the building, damaging
corridors, lecture halls and equipment in the classrooms, said
Stephen Silver, spokesman for the student organization.
   Also today, police reported a limpet mine explosion damaged a
railway track near East London on Friday night and a black man was
shot to death by an unidentified gunman in the Natal province
township of Mpumalanga.
   The fire caused an estimated $240,000 damage to the building.
   Graffiti attacking Tutu, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning Anglican
archbishop, was painted on the outside of the building where an
annual peace lecture bearing his name was to be delivered tonight.
Tutu was invited to attend, but was not planning to, said spokesman
John Allen.
   Allen said the name of the speaker, British Rabbi Julia
Neuberger, was printed in small letters on posters, and ``Desmond
Tutu Peace Lecture'' was in large block letters, possibly leading to
the impression that he was to appear.
   A police spokesman, Lt. Col. Frans Malherbe, said the fire was
being investigated by a criminal division of the police force.
   He said a phone recording machine and some files had been removed
from the offices of the student organization but that neither
security police nor the criminal investigators had removed anything.
He said police believed the same persons were responsible for the
arson, the graffiti and the thefts.
   Stephen Kromberg, national president of the student group, said
the attack ``is obviously aimed at intimidating us and disrupting
our anti-apartheid work.
   ``The bombing of our offices follows a string of attacks on other
anti-apartheid organizations. ... The police do not seem to have
made much progress with these cases and we hope that they will treat
this case with the seriousness it deserves.''
   Malherbe said the detonator and fuse found at the scene had been
used to light the fire, and not for explosive purposes. ``At this
stage it's being treated as an ordinary arson,'' he said.
   Police gave no details on the death Natal, where at least 1,000
people have died in the past two years in fighting between black
political groups for control of the townships.
   Police said they did not know when the limpet mine had exploded
on the railway line near East London in eastern Cape province, but
the damage, and a second, unexploded mine, were discovered today.
Services were not interrupted, said transport spokesman Louis du
Toit.
   Censorship rules imposed under the 29-month-old state of
emergency ban or restrict reporting about unrest, security force
actions, treatment of detainees, most forms of peaceful protest and
a broad range of statements the government considers subversive.
