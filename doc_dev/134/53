   OSHAKATI, South-West Africa (AP) _ Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and eight fellow bishops led a defiant church service Saturday
and called for Namibian independence from South Africa.
   The main preacher, Bishop Bruce Evans, described South Africa's
occupation of the territory as evil, urged Christians to oppose it
and called for the troops' immediate withdrawal from South-West
Africa, commonly known as Namibia.
   ``We say to the South African government, `get out,''' Evans, a
white from South Africa, told about 500 black worshippers. ``We
pray for independence.''
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize and the first black
to lead the Anglican church in southern Africa, told the
congregation that two of Evans' sons have been detained in South
Africa for political activity.
   Oshakati is the administrative center of the northern region of
Ovambo, the most populous area of Namibia and the main operational
zone of the South-West African People's Organization guerrilla
movement during its sporadic 22-year-old bush war against South
African rule.
   During their two-day trip to Ovambo, Tutu and his colleagues
have urged the immediate implementation of a 1978 United Nations
resolution calling for U.N.-supervised independence elections.
   Most observers believe such elections would be won by SWAPO,
which is recognized by the U.N. but condemned by South Africa as a
Marxist-oriented terrorist group.
   South Africa says it will not implement the U.N. resolution
until Cuban troops withdraw from neighboring Angola, where they
support the Marxist government in a war against the South
African-backed UNITA rebel movement. Oshakati is a main staging
point for South African forces fighting alongside UNITA, the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola.
   ``South Africa has taken the military option,'' Tutu said after
the church service. ``It is not interested in negotiations.''
   Tutu condemned the announcement by President P.W. Boha on Friday
that he was broadening the powers of South Africs's chief
representative in Namibia.
   ``You turn the screw tighter and tighter,'' he said of South
Africa, ``and you get less and less control.''
   Among those attending the church service was Peter Kalangula,
leader of the Ovambo regional administration. He has refused to
participate in the South African-installed territorial government
and seeks to maintain good ties with SWAPO supporters.
   Kalangula, who spoke with Botha on Friday in Windhoek, Namibia's
capital, said Botha promised that Defense Minister Magnus Malan and
Army Commander Jannie Geldenhuys would look into allegations of
army atrocities when they visit Oshakati soon.
   The South African Defense Force announced Saturday that two
white soldiers had died Friday from wounds they received in a
bombardment Thursday in the far northern part of the territory. A
military spokesman said the bombardment had been carried out by
SWAPO but gave no other details.
