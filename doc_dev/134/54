   A detainee in critical
condition after 37 days on a hunger strike said Sunday he would
suspend his fast and hinted he may soon be released.
   In a separate development, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu told
residents of an impoverished township that black faction fighting
remains an obstacle in their struggle for political rights.
   Hunger striker Sandile Thusi, who has been fasting to protest
his detention without trial, said he decided to resume eating
following a Saturday meeting with anti-apartheid leader Rev. Frank
Chikane.
   Chikane also spoke Saturday to Minister of Law and Order Adriaan
Vlok about Thusi, who has staged the longest fast of the estimated
600 detainees who have participated in a hunger strike since
January to demand their freedom.
   Thusi said the negotiations between Chikane and Vlok were the
key to his decision to resume eating. His comment suggested there
has been some progress toward his release, but he would not say if
the government had given him any assurances that he will be freed.
   The government has said it would not consider Thusi's release
until he resumed eating. Chikane, meanwhile, said he will meet Vlok
this week for additional talks on the status of Thusi and other
detainees.
   Thusi, who is in the intensive care unit at St. Aidan's Hospital
in Durban, said in a statement he would begin eating Monday after
meeting with his family.
   The 26-year-old university researcher reportedly has lost 57
pounds, or about one-third of his weight, during his fast to
protest his nine-month detention without trial.
   Doctors have described his condition as critical and said he
risks blindness and brain damage if he continues to fast.
   The government says it has authorized the release of 580 people
in custody since the hunger strike began. Human rights groups say
several hundred activists remain held without charge. An estimated
30,000 people have been detained for varying lengths of time during
the 33-month-old state of emergency.
   Tutu delivered his Easter Sunday sermon to 600 people, including
dozens of uniformed policemen, at an Anglican Church service in
Mbekweni, a township about 45 miles east of Cape Town.
   ``There is no doubt that it is God's intention for us (blacks)
to be free in our land,'' said Tutu. ``For we do not want to
oppress anyone, we just want to live in peace and harmony and
happiness.''
   Several hundred township residents, including a band and drum
majorettes, sang and danced while they waited for the arrival of
Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize winner and the head of the
Anglican Church in southern Africa.
   ``I pray that we in this township will know that we are oppresed
because we are black,'' Tutu said. ``Therefore, we will be united
and not allow ourselves to be divided into warring factions. The
day we are so united there will be nothing to stop us.''
   There have been numerous black-on-black faction fights in recent
years, including 1986 battles in Cape Town between anti-apartheid
activists and pro-government vigilantes.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
