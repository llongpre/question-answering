   Scores of blacks protesting
Archbishop Desmond Tutu's support of sanctions were treated to tea
at his residence Wednesday while their leaders conferred with
Anglican leaders.
   About 200 residents of Crossroads, a shantytown near Cape Town,
came in minibuses to Tutu's official residence in the wealthy Cape
Town neighborhood of Bishopscourt.
   Tutu, leader of the Anglican church in southern Africa, was
attending an ecumenical church conference in Kenya, but other
Anglican leaders met with representatives of the protesters.
   A statement issued after the meeting said both sides agreed that
apartheid was a fundamental cause of South Africa's problems and
that blacks suffered economically long before sanctions were imposed.
   Tutu has been the target of several protests this year involving
blacks who claim they are losing job opportunities because of
sanctions.
   Previous protests have been featured prominently on newscasts of
the state-run television network, and Tutu's staff has suggested
there is an orchestrated campaign to create a false impression the
archbishop is widely opposed by his fellow blacks.
   Crossroads has been dominated since 1986 by a conservative
faction which ousted anti-apartheid activists during a series of
battles. President P.W. Botha visited the shantytown in August.
