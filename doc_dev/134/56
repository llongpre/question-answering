  [Text] Cape Town Dec 31 SAPA -- Thursday night's terror 
attack on Cape Town's Heidelberg tavern should not be allowed to 
provoke decent people into taking revenge, Anglican Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu said on Friday. 
  Archbishop Tutu said the attackers, who left four people 
dead 
and five injured, were "agents of evil...who know they are on 
their last lap while the country progresses to freedom and 
peace", SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio 
reported. 
  The archbishop is a former recipient of the Nobel Peace 
Prize.
