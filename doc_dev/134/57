   There was no Christmas lull in
the fighting between black factions in Natal Province, despite a
peace appeal from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and police said nine more
blacks have died in the country's worst conflict.
   Most died from stab wounds in six separate incidents Sunday in
the troubled province. A dozen homes were set afire, 17 people were
injured, and police used tear gas to break up two street battles.
   More than 1,000 blacks have been killed in Natal in the past two
years in the feuding between supporters of militant anti-apartheid
groups and members of Inkatha, a more moderate movement led by Zulu
politician Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   Tutu, the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who heads southern
Africa's Anglican Church, last week deplored the violence in this
southeastern province.
   ``When we are meant to be celebrating the birth of the Prince of
Peace, the killing looks as though it is escalating,'' the black
archbishop said. ``In such a situation it is easy to be dispairing.
Calling for peace can seem a meaningless ritual.''
   Black leaders had expressed optimism in September, when officials
of Inkatha and the Congress of South African Trade Unions signed a
peace pact in the Natal provincial capital, Pietermaritzburg. The
militant labor federation is allied with the banned United
Democratic Front _ an umbrella organization for anti-apartheid
groups _ in the power struggle against Inkatha.
   The agreement condemned violence and established a board to
review residents' complaints of harassment or attacks.
   The pact remains in effect, but has had limited success. Some
witnesses have been afraid to testify and many supporters of the
United Democratic Front, which is banned from holding meetings, felt
they were not consulted about the agreement.
   This month, increasing violence has further dimmed the hopes
raised by the peace pact. On Dec. 3, gunmen fired into a house in
Trust Feed, a black community near Pietermaritzburg, and killed 11
people, including children, who were holding an all-night vigil for
a child who had died.
   News reports initially blamed Inkatha for the massacre. Buthelezi
later claimed the victims were Inkatha members and threatened to sue
anyone who blamed his organization.
   On Dec. 17, residents of Caluza, also near Pietermaritzburg, said
Inkatha members rampaged through town, killing three people and
damaging dozens of homes while police stood by.
   Police officials deny any partiality in the conflict.
   Tutu, in his peace appeal, raised the issue of police bias.
   ``I am very disturbed to hear reports that people do not perceive
the police as a force which protects them, but rather as a group
which favors those who claim allegiance to the Inkatha movement,''
he said.
   The country's largest-selling black daily newspaper, The Sowetan,
said in a recent editorial the ``reign of terror'' in Natal was ``a
shame and a disgrace.''
   Both Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, and the United
Democratic Front oppose the apartheid policies under which South
Africa's 5 million whites dominate the 26 million blacks, who have
not voice in national affairs. But the strategies of the two groups
differ markedly.
   The front, a predominantly black coalition of about 600 groups,
advocates economic sanctions, strikes and other confrontational
tactics to bring about sweeping political and economic change.
   Inkatha, which opposes sanctions and shuns militant protest,
accuses the front of supporting the violence of the outlawed African
National Congress, the largest guerrilla group fighting the
government.
