   Archbishop Desmond Tutu today
urged fellow Anglicans to fast three days each week for the duration
of a hunger strike by about 300 black detainees who are demanding to
be set free.
   Some of the strikers have not eaten for 22 days, and 21
reportedly have been hospitalized. They have threatened to starve
themselves if the government does not either release or charge them.
   The Ministry of Law and Order said detainees are reviewed and
released every day, and that 17 were freed today. Two detainees who
had been on a hunger strike until Saturday were freed Monday but
their release had nothing to do with their fast, the ministry said.
   Tutu said he and other anti-apartheid church leaders will meet
Thursday with Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok to discuss the
strike, the strongest challenge yet to the white-led government's
policy of detention without trial.
   Vlok has agreed to meet starting today with lawyers for some of
the detainees and was considering a request to meet with parents of
hunger strikers.
   ``You know how a mother feels ... it really hurts,'' said
Neocwaka Lamani, one of six parents who flew to Cape Town today in
hopes of seeing Vlok.
   She said her 27-year-old son, Tango, joined the strike last week
at a Port Elizabeth prison, where he has been held since June 1986.
   Tutu, who spoke by telephone with Vlok on Monday, described him
as ``very concerned ... The very fact that he is ready to meet a
delegation of lawyers and church leaders is an indication that he is
prepared to listen to different points of view.''
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, called on Anglicans
to fast each Monday, Wednesday and Friday in support of the hunger
strikers.
   He said a prayer service will be held Thursday at St. George's
Cathedral in Cape Town prior to his meeting with Vlok, and that
another service was planned for Friday.
   The Rev. Allan Boesak, along with Tutu one of the country's most
influential anti-apartheid clergymen, announced Monday that he is
fasting in solidarity with the hunger strikers.
   ``None of us wish to die,'' Boesak said in a letter to Vlok.
``But if this is the road we must take to make you and your
government understand the evil of your ways, we will take it.''
   Boesak, 43, is a mixed-race clergyman and president of the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches. Tutu said of Boesak's decision:
``That is how he believes God is calling him.''
   The strikers include about 170 detainees at Diepkloof Prison
outside Johannesburg, 105 at St. Albans prison in Port Elizabeth and
11 at a Port Elizabeth police station. Many have been held without
charge since a state of emergency was declared in June 1986.
   Vlok said the meetings with lawyers are part of a continuing
process of reviewing the cases of an estimated 1,000 detainees. He
said those deemed to pose no threat to state security would be
released.
   Police have warned newspapers that reports about the condition of
the detainees might violate a state-of-emergency regulation. Public
meetings intended to show support for the hunger strikers have been
banned.
   The Citizen, a pro-government Johannesburg newspaper, said in an
editorial today that one of South Africa's ``worst stigmas'' could
be removed if the government ``adopted a fresh approach to
detentions.''
   Business Day, another Johannesburg newspaper, asked: ``How many
more deaths will it take before the decent people of this country
rebel against the rule of wickedness?''
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
