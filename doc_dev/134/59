<HEAD>Police Seize A Second Tape of Archbishop's Defiant Sermon</HEAD>

   Security police today seized a
second recording of a defiant sermon by Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
and a pro-government newspaper said authorities should not be
reluctant to prosecute him.
   Officers with a search warrant came to the Argus, a Cape Town
morning newspaper, and seized a tape recording its religion
reporter made of a sermon Sunday in which Tutu called for a boycott
of local elections slated for next month. State-of-emergency
regulations forbid such calls.
   On Tuesday, two plainclothes officers went to the Anglican
archbishop's official residence in Cape Town and seized a recording
of the sermon that Tutu's press aide, John Allen, had made.
   In the sermon at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town, Tutu urged
whites and blacks to boycott nationwide municipal elections
scheduled for Oct. 26. Many blacks oppose participation in any
local or regional elections until the black majority is allowed to
vote in national elections.
   A pro-government Johannesburg daily, The Citizen, said Tutu
``has invited the government to prosecute him ... to achieve the
status of a martyr.''
   ``He is well aware that if he is prosecuted, the world spotlight
will be on him, that the court case will be reported far and wide,
that his status internationally will be enhanced, and that South
Africa itself will suffer tremendous harm when he, as head of the
Anglican Church in southern Africa, as Nobel Peace laureate, is
placed in the dock,'' the newspaper said.
   ``Whatever the consequences, his defiance cannot be allowed,''
The Citizen said. ``To us, he will be the man who has harmed his
country, his church, his people.''
   Another Johannesburg paper, Business Day, today advised the
government to ignore Tutu. ``He would be furious,'' the paper said.
   Violation of emergency regulations is punishable by up to 10
years in prison.
   Tutu said Sunday that he was aware of the penalties. ``I am not
defying the government, I am obeying God,'' he said.
   The Oct. 26 elections for councilors in South Africa's racially
segregated municipalities will mark the first time that voters of
all races go to the polls on the same day.
   The white-controlled government is depicting the elections as a
major step toward democracy and is spending hundreds of thousands
of dollars on advertising to encourage a large turnout.
