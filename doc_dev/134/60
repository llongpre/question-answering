   President Bush, stressing his ``abhorrence of
apartheid,'' today pledged American pressure to bring about
``justice and equality'' in South Africa, his spokesman said.
   The president, after meeting with Nobel Peace Prize laureate
Desmond Tutu, invited Albertina Sisulu, one of the leaders of the
United Democatic Front in South Africa to visit the United States,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``The president shares the archbishop's abhorrence of
apartheid,'' Fitzwater said. ``The president promised to stress his
opposition in every way possible. The asministration will be
looking at ways to best use American pressure, influence and
leverage to bring about justice and equality to South Africa.
   Tutu, who heads the Anglican Church in South Africa, said he
urged Bush to ``take the moral leadership'' toward ending his
country's apartheid policies of racial separation and said he was
enouraged the president had a ``warm openness'' to that cause.
   ``We do not want to be overly optimistic,'' Tutu told reporters,
adding he had been impressed that Bush appeared to genuinely abhor
apartheid, that he wanted to be ``a catalyst for change'' and ``a
positive influence.''
   Tutu and two other anti-apartheid leaders, Revs. Allan Boesak
and Beyers Naude, who met briefly with Bush at the White House, did
not disclose the specifics of their conversation. Tutu indicated,
however, they did not ask for specific initiatives other than that
Bush urge Pretoria to negotiate with its opposition.
   Asked about the discussion, Tutu said: ``We said we wanted to
help the United States ... to take the moral leadership of the
world in helping to end apartheid and bringing the South African
government to the negotiating table, which is our primary end.''
   Although the White House said a day earlier that Bush does not
intend to back further sanctions against Pretoria to press for
social change, in essence maintaining the policy of President
Reagan, the leaders were upbeat after the meeting.
   ``I think there is a very warm openness and we think the door
stands ajar. No door has been slammed in our face,'' Tutu said.
   At a news conference later, the group said Bush and Congress
should support sanctions that would squeeze the economically
strapped South African government and force it to the negotiating
table.
   Boesak also urged Bush to take advantage of indications of a
recent Soviet shift in southern Africa toward more pragmatic
policies or ask himself ``the question: will we be trailing behind
(Kremlin leader Mikhail) Gorbachev again?''
   If Bush fails to understand the importance of resolving the
South African problem for the stability of the region and for
superpower relations, ``then it's not only our funeral, it's his
too,'' Boesak said.
   The meeting itself was seen as a small victory for the
anti-apartheid activists.
   Under President Reagan, whose veto of anti-Pretoria sanctions
was overridden by Congress, ``we had the idea that here was a
position that was taken and there was no further possibility of
even discussing the issue. Here we have a feeling that the
president has not closed his mind to any possibility of how he
could best be helpful in the South African situation,'' said Boesak.
   ``And the very fact that he values the opinion of those of us
who represent black people in South Africa, that in itself is a
sign that we did not get in the same measure from the previous
administration.''
   The White House session was scheduled as U.S. officials were
preparing for the visit of F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to
succeed President P.W. Botha after Botha resigns in September. De
Klerk would be the first top South African leader to officially
visit here in 30 years.
   Tutu, as well as Democrats in Congress, said Bush's failure to
meet with the trio would have shown his unwillingness to support an
end to South Africa's racial segregation system.
   Anti-apartheid leaders believe a window of opportunity may be
created both by the new U.S. administration and by the anticipated
change in their country's leadership. De Klerk has called for
political reforms, although he has ruled out complete
enfranchisement for blacks, who comprise 85 percent of the nation's
population.
   The Reagan administration argued that sanctions impoverish South
Africa's 28 million blacks rather than forcing the government to
reform.
