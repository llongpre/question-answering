   Police arrested Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu and hundreds of other activists nationwide
Friday as clerics, students and workers staged protests in support
of a growing anti-apartheid campaign.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, was arrested along
with his wife and 34 other protesters as they marched outside St.
George's Cathedral to protest the alleged beating of church workers
by police earlier in the day.
   Tutu and the others were released several hours later.
   ``We are going to defy until freedom comes,'' Tutu told several
hundred supporters after his release. ``I'm increasingly proud of
being part of a community that has decided we have had enough.''
   Police spokesman Brig. Leon Mellet said all 36 could face
prosecution under a law that prohibits demonstrations near
Parliament. The march took place about 200 yards from Parliament.
   Police also threatened Friday to take ``decisive action'' against
members of the media who defy state-of-emergency regulations that
prohibit reporting on unrest.
   About 20 protesters from the Western Province Council of Churches
said police used batons and whips Friday to chase them from a
security police office in Cape Town, where they had gone to condemn
recent detentions of activists.
   Tutu described the beatings as ``utterly, utterly scandalous. It
was a peaceful demonstration.''
   Later, when Tutu and the other activists left St. George's, which
Tutu heads, they encountered police who formed a human barricade.
Police told the demonstrators to disperse, then led them into vans
when they refused.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States had made its concern known to the South
African government and has asked for a full report on the incident.
   ``Once again, we urge the South African government to permit the
peaceful expression of political dissent,'' she said.
   Canon Winston Ndungane, chief executive officer of Anglican
Church in South Africa, called Tutu's arrest ``a further indication
that the authorities will use whatever means possible to prevent a
man of peace going about his work.''
   ``When (Tutu's) peaceful intervention is met by this kind of
behavior, it lessens whatever hope we have of ending the conflict in
this country,'' Ndungane said.
   Tutu's wife, Leah, was among about 200 women arrested Wednesday
in Cape Town for staging an unauthorized protest. The women were
released without bail and told to appear in court next month.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in southern
Africa, has played a prominent role in the nationwide defiance
campaign launched Aug. 2. The campaign is aimed at challenging
segregation laws and mobilizing opposition to the Sept. 6
parliamentary elections, which exclude the 28-million black majority.
   On Saturday, activists planned an illegal protest march on
Parliament and also planned to defy a police ban by holding a huge
rally in Soweto, the township outside Johannesburg. On Sunday,
blacks have scheduled a mass picnic on a whites-only beach in the
Indian Ocean city of Durban.
   Police have arrested or detained scores of activists in the past
week, and more were reported Friday in cities nationwide.
   Several blocks from the site of Tutu's march, police arrested
more than 100 college and university teachers for staging an illegal
anti-government protest on a pedestrian mall.
   In Durban, police arrested about 300 students, both black and
white, who were demonstrating just outside the University of Natal
campus.
   On Cape Town's outskirts, where police and militant youths have
clashed daily for several weeks, several mixed-race students
reportedly were wounded when officers fired tear gas and birdshot to
disperse a protest rally.
   Police said they were ``deeply concerned about the screening
abroad of film material featuring scenes of unrest.''
   ``Police hereby issue an early warning to the media to strictly
comply with all media emergency regulations,'' a statement said.
   Under the 3-year-old state of emergency, reporting on police
action and unrest is prohibited without permission from authorities.
   The restrictions have not been enforced comprehensively, but
photographers and television cameramen have had their film
confiscated by police with increasing frequency in recent weeks.
   Thousands of black union members, meanwhile, joined the defiance
campaign Friday, staging work stoppages at their factories to
protest a labor law they say cripples their power to strike.
   One of the biggest union protests was at the Unilever Ltd.
factory in Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, where about 1,000 workers
marched around the premises, many carrying placards denouncing the
year-old Labor Relations Amendment Act.
   The two main black labor federations have joined other major
anti-apartheid groups in calling for a national protest next Tuesday
and Wednesday against the elections. In the past, such protests have
taken the form of a general strike.
   The labor relations act has been the subject of a bitter dispute
among the government, employers and unions since it was drafted by
government officials last year.
   Employers agreed to some changes after unions complained it would
virtually eliminate their ability to strike. But several provisions
remain which they unions say are unacceptable, including a
prohibition on sympathy strikes by workers not directly involved in
a contract dispute.
   Friday's protest was endorsed by the 1 million-member Congress of
South African Trade Unions and by the 500,000-member National
Council of Trade Unions.
