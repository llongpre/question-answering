   Bishop Desmond Tutu said Wednesday that
news reports misrepresent tribal violence in South Africa's black
townships when they focus on the ``black on black'' angle.
   ``The violence is mainly for political reasons over ideological
political turf,'' the anti-apartheid activist said at Brown
University, which presented him with an honorary degree.
   ``We're no more divided than any other normal community,'' he
said.
   Tutu wondered aloud why the strife in Northern Ireland wasn't
characterized as ``white on white,'' as the ``black on black''
violence is in South Africa.
   About 800 blacks have died since fighting began outside
Johannesburg in early August between the African National Congress
and Inkatha. Both organizations oppose apartheid, South Africa's
policy of racial separation, but differ on plans for the country's
future.
   ``This is the frustration of people who have been deprived for
so many years,'' said Tutu, who won the Nobel Prize for peace in
1984 for his work against apartheid. ``The cost may be slightly
higher than we thought.''
   Tutu also questioned President F.W. de Klerk's commitment to his
stated goal of ``one man, one vote'' for South Africa. But he said
de Klerk, who met with President Bush on Monday, ``must be given
considerable credit for his courage'' in trying to move the country
away from apartheid.
   But Tutu said the world looks more to African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela as South Africa's spiritual leader.
   He contrasted the adulation given Mandela when he visited the
United States earlier this year with de Klerk's lower-profile visit
with Bush on Monday.
   ``It's as different as chalk and cheese,'' he said.
   Tutu also reiterated his call to Bush to retain economic
sanctions against South Africa.
   ``It indicates whether you are on the side of the oppressed or
the oppressor,'' he said.
   The president has indicated he might lift the sanctions if the
government releases political prisoners and lifts the state of
emergency in black townships.
   The bishop also said he had no qualms about accepting honors
from Brown University, which has $635,000 invested in South Africa.
Tutu has turned down similar honors from schools that had South
African investments.
   But Robert Reichley, Brown's vice president of university
relations, said Brown has reduced its investments from $33 million
in 1984, and half of the remaining $635,000 is held by the school
on behalf of others, including alumni.
   Asked if that amount was significant, Tutu replied: ``I would
think that would be debating how many angels dance on the point of
a needle.''
