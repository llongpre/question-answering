   South Africa's foreign minister criticized U.S.
sanctions against his country during an interview on American
television, but his apartheid opponent, Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
called for tougher steps.
   Foreign Minister Roelof ``Pik'' Botha and Tutu, the Noble Peace
Prize-winning Anglican prelate, were interviewed separately on
ABC-TV's ``Nightline'' show Thursday.
   Tutu criticized the United States for failing to take tougher
steps against South Africa to induce that country to abandon
apartheid, the policy of racial separation.
   ``We are saying, `Look, in South Africa, many of the things that
you hold dear are being treated with considerable disdain. Why
don't you do something that will indicate to the South African
government and to the victims that you actually do mean what you
say?''' Tutu said.
   Botha, meanwhile, claimed that ``in general, black South
Africans have more effective civil rights than black Americans.''
   ``You do not want to have a proper analysis of our dilemma,''
Botha said. ``You simply ascribe to us the worst motives. We appeal
to the black Americans to try to understand that in many instances
black South Africans enjoy better medical facilities, better
housing facilities, better education and greater prospects of
power-sharing than black Americans will ever enjoy.''
   Tutu said that despite the South African government's relaxation
or elimination of some apartheid policies, ``those steps have not
come about as a result of any significant conversion on their part.
... Political power still remains very firmly in the hands of the
white minority and until we deal with that problem we are playing
marbles.''
   Responding to a question about whether economic sanctions were
effective, he said, ``if in fact sanctions are as ineffective as we
are being led to believe, why are the South African government, the
private sector ... jumping around like scalded cats, as if they had
ants in their pants?''
   Botha argued that the sanctions and the withdrawal of some
industries ``mean robbing our black people of jobs, of sending
their families into starvation.''
   He claimed a poll had shown that 75 percent of his country's
blacks opposed sanctions. When asked why the government would not
allow blacks to express such views by allowing them to vote, Botha
denied that blacks are being denied political power.
