   It won't happen next season, but there might
still be a move in store for Roseanne Barr's hit television show.
   Tom Arnold, Barr's husband, said earlier this week they plan to
buy a house in the Twin Cities and bring with them production of
``Roseanne,'' possibly as early as next season.
   David Brokaw, a spokesman for the company that produces the ABC
series, said Friday the move is too expensive and will not happen
any time soon.
   ``But we will definitely take a look at it in the future,''
Brokaw said in a statement he issued jointly with Barr and Arnold.
   Arnold said he and Barr want out of the ``loony bin'' that
passes for their life in Los Angeles.

   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Archbishop Desmond Tutu says the
United States is vacillating on the value of sanctions against
South Africa's apartheid government.
   Tutu spoke Friday at Seton Hall University, where he was honored
for his civil rights work on behalf of blacks in South Africa. He
told a crowd of about 500 people that sanctions should be
maintained until apartheid is dismantled.
   ``We hope your government is not going to lift sanctions
prematurely,'' Tutu said.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984, heads the 2.6
million-member Anglican Church of the Province of Southern Africa.

Friday he plans to visit every state to promote fitness as chairman

   He told the crowd at the University of Nebraska Coliseum that
he'll return to the state to check on the progress of physical
education and fitness programs in schools.

   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Zimbabwe President Robert G. Mugabe,
at a ceremony in which Michigan State University gave him an
honorary doctor of laws degree, said there are new signs of hope
for democracy in South Africa.
   Mugabe, Zimbabwe's first president elected under majority rule,
said at Friday's ceremony he hopes current peace initiatives in
South Africa will lead to elimination of apartheid and ``create a
non-racial democratic order as a new political reality.''
   ``Hence encouragement should be given to all forces fighting to
dismantle apartheid and to replace it with the desired just social
and political order,'' Mugabe said.

   CHICAGO (AP) - A South Side street that was once a hub for jazz
and blues will be renamed after the late Sammy Davis Jr.
   Davis, who died this summer of cancer, performed in Chicago
throughout his career, beginning in the early 1940s.
   ``Legendary artists of the '30s, '40s and '50s were showcased in
clubs and theaters and even private homes that lined 31st Street,
which was once the hub of jazz and blues,'' Mayor Richard M. Daley
said.
   ``Thus it's only fitting that this street is chosen to honor one
of the greatest performers in show business, the late Sammy Davis
Jr,'' he said.
   City officials planned a ceremony Thursday to change the
street's name.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Former President Reagan renewed his
friendship with country-music king Roy Acuff during a visit to the
Music City to address a bottlers convention.
   Acuff and Reagan spent about 15 minutes together Friday night,
discussing sports, retirement and other topics, said Grand Ole Opry
spokesman Jerry Strobel.
   ``Mr. Acuff wanted to thank him for coming to Nashville for his
81st birthday celebration in 1984,'' Strobel said. ``And President
Reagan said, `Glad to do it - it's always a treat to see Roy
Acuff.' ''
   The men have been friends since the 1940s, when Reagan was
president of the Screen Actors Guild and Acuff was in Hollywood
making movies.
   Reagan also served as honorary chairman of a May 1984 tribute to
Acuff at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
