   ``Pope, Tutu clash,'' said a
headline Tuesday in one South African newspaper. ``Tutu and Pope in
agreement,'' said a headline in another.
   The conflicting messages reflected the intense battle being
waged by South African political factions to capitalize on Pope
John Paul II's visit to five neighboring countries.
   The pope is bypassing South Africa, but his comments on issues
such as apartheid, sanctions and political violence are being
analyzed and interpreted here with great intensity and diversity.
   Pro-government media seized upon some of the pope's comments en
route to Harare, Zimbabwe, on Saturday and suggested that he had
repudiated Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
   This interpretation was based on the pope's unqualified
denunciation of political violence, and his reservations about
sanctions and election boycotts.
   Tutu advocates sanctions and is urging a boycott of the upcoming
segregated elections. He has repeatedly condemned violence but says
he understands how some South African blacks feel they have no
other alternative in seeking to end white-minority domination.
   One pro-government paper, Beeld, ran a cartoon Tuesday showing
Tutu with a chain of bullets around his neck.
   ``Is this what your rosary looks like?'' the pope asks Tutu, as
they stand near a newspaper poster that reads: ``Pope Strongly
Against Sanctions and Violence.''
   ``It is a pity that Archbishop Tutu was not in Harare to hear
the pope, since he would have learnt what a man of such eminence
has to say in leading the faithful on the paths of reconciliation
and peace,'' said The Citizen, a pro-government daily, in an
editorial Monday.
   ``But then, the pope is a great religious leader, whereas
Archbishop Tutu has decided to involve himself in politics.''
   John Paul also was praised by the state-run South African
Broadcasting Corp. In a commentary Tuesday, it contrasted his
``forthright declarations'' with the ``vagueness, prevarication and
endless qualifications'' from South African clergymen.
   Tutu's spokesman, John Allen, said there are no fundamental
differences between the pope and the archbishop, who met earlier
this year at the Vatican.
   Both oppose violence and agree that strategies such as sanctions
and election boycotts should not be used indiscriminately, if other
effective tactics were available, Allen said.
   The papal visit also has prompted ideological maneuvering in
Marxist-ruled Mozambique. John Paul will travel there Friday on the
last leg of his trip.
   The government-backed newspaper Noticias, in a front-page
editorial Monday, said the visit to Mozambique proves that the pope
sides with ``the peoples of southern Africa'' in a struggle against
``the forces of colonialism, apartheid and destabilization.''
   The editorial denounced the ``hesitations, ambiguities or
collaborationist silence'' of local Roman Catholic leaders who have
urged the government to change its policy and negotiate with the
Mozambique National Resistance guerrilla movement.
