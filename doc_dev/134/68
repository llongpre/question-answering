   Archibishop Desmond Tutu said Monday he
hoped President Bush would encourage South African President F. W.
de Klerk to ``get on with the business'' of negotiating an end to
white rule.
   ``I think they really ought to get into the negotiating mode
quickly because that's the only way in which results will happen
which will then lead to the lifting of sanctions,'' the South
African prelate said after receiving an honorary degree from the
University of Missouri-Kansas City.
   De Klerk, the first South African leader to visit the United
States since 1945, met with Bush Monday in Washington.
   Tutu praised de Klerk's reforms as steps toward dismantling
South Africa's apartheid, a system of racial separation under which
the country's black majority is ruled by the white minority.
   ``It is important that some recognition be given for the things
he has done, and recognition for his courage,'' said Tutu, who won
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his work against his country's
system of racial separation.
   However, Tutu said it was too early to ease U.S. economic
sanctions against South Africa. The sanctions helped push de Klerk
toward change, he said.
   In Washington Monday, Bush said that despite dramatic progress,
South Africa has not met conditions for ending the sanctions.
   Among de Klerk's reforms was the legalization of the African
National Congress and other anti-apartheid groups. In February, ANC
leader Nelson Mandela was freed after more than 27 years in prison.
