   A secret government security
unit planned bombings and killings, and it once employed a witch
doctor to put a spell on Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a former agent
testified Monday.
   Abraham ``Snake'' Van Zyl told an inquiry hearing that agents of
the secret Civilian Cooperation Bureau had conducted a major
underground campaign against anti-apartheid activists. He said the
main targets were the African National Congress, Nelson Mandela's
group, and the South African Communist Party.
   ``Disruption of the enemy ranged from breaking windows to
killing,'' he told the official inquiry.
   Van Zyl, a former police officer, said he and other agents tried
to use ``muti,'' or magic, against Tutu, an anti-apartheid activist
who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize. He said they hanged a monkey
fetus prepared by a witch doctor in Tutu's driveway and drove
magically treated nails into the driveway.
   He did not say exactly how this was supposed to affect Tutu.
   The government has ordered an investigation into the Cooperation
Bureau, which was reportedly run by the South African Defense
Forces to wage a secret war against groups fighting the white
government's apartheid policies of racial discrimination. South
African newspapers have reported that top generals were linked to
the unit's activities.
   Opposition leaders contend the security forces are tied to the
deaths or disappearance of dozens of anti-government activists in
recent years. Several former police officers have admitted
involvement in killings of government opponents and other illegal
activities.
   Van Zyl, who said he was speaking because he wanted the truth to
come out, also said the unit bombed a school in Cape Town in 1989
because it was reportedly used as a meeting place by anti-apartheid
activists.
   He said it also planned to kill anti-apartheid leader Dullah
Omar by inducing a heart attack by swapping medicine for poison.
   Van Zyl also said the unit planned to kill Gavin Evans, a
journalist.
   Most of the schemes described by Van Zyl appeared to end in
failure.
   Van Zyl recounted how he was recruited into the unit by military
intelligence officers and given a salary and allowances that
allowed him to buy a BMW car. He said he and other agents set up
businesses with government funds to mask their activities and serve
as front organizations.
