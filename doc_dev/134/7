   The government-run
broadcasting network assailed the pro-sanctions position of
Archbishop Desmond Tutu on Tuesday and challenged the Anglican
Church to say if it supports or rejects Tutu's stance.
   Tutu, the first black to head the Anglican Church in South
Africa, was completing a U.S. tour where he appealed for additional
U.S. economic sanctions to protest South Africa's apartheid
policies.
   ``Archbishop Tutu has never been voted into a public office that
gives him the right to claim a significant constituency,'' the
South African Broadcasting Corp. said in a commentary.
   The statement failed to note that Tutu, like all of the nation's
26 million blacks, is ineligible to vote or be elected to national
political office.
   The SABC also said, without elaborating, that the Anglican
Church ``is deeply divided as a result of his (Tutu's) political
utterances.''
   ``What is the church's stand on the widely held view that
sanctions will bring deprivation and hardship in increasing numbers
to black South Africans?'' the SABC asked.
   ``The church owes it not only to parishoners but to all South
Africans to state unequivocally where the church stands on
sanctions, disinvestments, and their consequences.''
   Anglican Church officials could not be reached for comment
despite repeated telephone calls to their offices.
   The government has attacked Tutu in harsh tones on a number of
issues. In March, President P.W. Botha sent a letter to Tutu and
other church leaders saying they ``love and embrace'' the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla group.
   ``You embrace and participate in their call for violence,
hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution,'' Botha said.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, has continued to
call for sanctions and other forms of international pressure as the
most likely ways to bring about race reform in South Africa.
   The U.S. Congress imposed limited sanctions against South Africa
in 1986, banning the import of selected goods and stopping direct
air links between the two countries. Congress now is considering
much tougher legislation that would ban almost all bilateral
economic activity.
   Under apartheid, a racially segregated society is established by
law and custom, with the 5 million whites controlling the economy
and maintaining separate districts, schools and health services.
