   The guerrilla-backed African National
Congress on Friday told South African church leaders its policy is
not to attack civilian targets in their homeland.
   ANC President Oliver Tambo, exiled head of the main black
nationalist movement fighting the white-led Pretoria government,
acknowledged some guerrillas hit at civilians because they were
``inspired by anger at the regime's campaign of terror.''
   But he told a news conference, ``agents of the Pretoria regime
have been known to carry out attacks to sow confusion.''
   President P.W. Botha's government blames the ANC for the more
than 150 bombings since it declared a state of emergency June 12,
1986. Most casualties are black civilians.
   Tambo spoke to reporters after a daylong meeting with South
African church leaders headed by Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu,
the Nobel Peace Prize laureate.
   The joint news conference ended a five-day conference in Harare
of World Council of Churches clerics and civil rights activists on
Pretoria's destabilization of neighboring black-ruled states.
   Tutu said, ``It is quite important for us to keep underlining to
the world, especially to white members of our society, that the ANC
is made up of people who care enormously about our country and that
they are not ogres as they are painted to be _ that they are not
bloodthirsty.''
   Tutu said he was satisfied after the talks that the ANC was
pledged to non-violence against civilians. At previous meetings with
the ANC, Tutu has tried in vain to persuade guerrilla leaders to
abandon all violence.
   Tambo told reporters, ``it is contrary to ANC policy to attack
targets whose sole objective is civilian casualties.''
   The Harare meeting came as Pretoria announced that ANC leader
Nelson Mandela would not be returned to prison once he is released
from a private clinic treating him for tuberculosis. South African
officials said they will keep Mandela under guard at an unspecified
location.
   Mandela, 70, has been serving a life sentence since his 1964
conviction with other ANC leaders for sabotage and plotting to
topple the government.
   Tambo, his one-time law associate and president-in-exile of the
ANC, said Mandela always would be the head of the movement.
