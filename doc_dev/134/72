   President F.W. de Klerk today
agreed to meet with Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and two other
church anti-apartheid leaders next week for unprecedented talks
about South Africa's racial conflict.
   De Klerk immediately agreed to a request by the church leaders
for urgent talks ``about the crisis in our land,'' the president's
office said.
   It will be de Klerk's first direct meeting with top
anti-apartheid leaders since he replaced P.W. Botha as president
Aug. 15. The meeting has been scheduled for Wednesday in Pretoria.
   Tutu, who was in the United States today, released a statement
through his office in Cape Town saying he and his colleagues
believe de Klerk ``does not appreciate the far-reaching nature of
the steps he must take to get negotiations off the ground'' between
blacks and government leaders.
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new constitution within five
years that would extend political rights to the disenfranchised
black majority, but he has ruled out participation by the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement unless it renounces
violence.
   Tutu, referring to this position, said: ``Negotiations which
exclude the legitimate leaders of our people, which the government
appears to be contemplating, will intensify, not resolve, our
country's crisis.''
   ``It is not our intention to go to Mr. de Klerk claiming to be
negotiators,'' Tutu said. ``As church leaders, we would see
ourselves as facilitators who would try to create the climate for
negotiations.''
   The actual negotiations, he said, ``would have to be entered
into by those identified by our people as their true political
leaders.''
   In addition to Tutu, the clergymen who requested the meeting
were the Rev. Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, and the Rev. Frank Chikane, general-secretary of
the South African Council of Churches, de Klerk's office said.
   Tutu, expected back in South Africa on Sunday after traveling to
Washington for the funeral of Episcopal Bishop John T. Walker, met
four times with Botha during the former president's 11 years in
power. The archbishop has not met with de Klerk since Botha's
resignation in August.
   Government sources have been quoted in news reports this week as
saying jailed ANC leader Walter Sisulu and another prominent black
activist, Oscar Mpetha, will be freed by Oct. 18.
   Sisulu, 77, the outlawed group's general secretary, was
sentenced in 1964 along with Nelson Mandela and other ANC leaders
to life in prison for plotting anti-government sabotage.
