<HEAD>Archbishop Says Police Manacled His Wife for Traffic Violation</HEAD>

   Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu said Friday his wife was handcuffed, chained and threatened by
police when she answered a summons for a traffic violation.
   ``Once they had established her identity they handcuffed her to
a door (at a branch traffic office),'' the black prelate said in a
statement from Cape Town. ``When her hand, after a while became
numb, she hit the door. The response of the officers was to chain
her foot to the door.''
   Tutu said when his wife, Leah, complained about not being
allowed to make a phone call, she was told by the traffic officer
that if she complained any further he would kick her in the mouth.
   Tutu said the officer used the Afrikaans word for an animal's
mouth.
   He said she was then taken to the Johannesburg police
headquarters and was handcuffed to the inside of the car door on
the way. She was then allowed to make a phone call and was released
on $100 bail, Tutu's statement said.
   The archbishop, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize and a
leading foe of South Africa's racial segregation system, said the
incident took place when his wife was in Johannesburg.
   ``I take very grave exception to the treatment that was given
and I want to take the matter further,'' Tutu said.
   He was due to leave the country Saturday for a trip to Moscow to
join ecumenical celebrations of the 1,000th anniversary of
Christianity in Russia.
   A police spokesman, Capt. J.J. Slabbert, said after checking on
the allegations, ``Mrs. Tutu was arrested by the traffic department
on a warrant. As far as I know nothing went wrong, there were no
scenes, everything was handled in a very nice way.''
   He said she was released on bail and was to appear in court on
June 20. He said according to his investigation she was not
handcuffed.
