Artifice: Seventy-six paintings seized from Imelda and Ferdinand Marcos are not 
worth the multimillion-dollar price tag placed on them for auction, an arts 
magazine says. Experts quoted in the October issue of ARTNews said the artwork 
is not worth the $8.6 million to $12.5 million Christies auction house 
estimated they will bring at a January auction.

Manhattan conservator Marco Grassi told the magazine that galleries sold Mrs. 
Marcos "inferior art at superior prices." The works were seized by the 
Philippine government after Marcos was ousted in 1986. Christies spokesman Ian 
Kennedy said: "I am perfectly satisfied" with the prices.

Klerk deserves praise for progress in dismantling apartheid. "It would be 
churlish to say that he does not deserve to be praised," Tutu said at a

remain until the process is irreversible," said Tutu, who is leader of the 
Anglican Church of Southern Africa and winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize.
