   About 200 religious leaders
from across South Africa met in emergency session Monday to
consider new non-violent strategies against apartheid, including
civil disobedience.
   The two-day convocation, first of its kind, is to end Tuesday
with a ``service of witness and solidarity'' at the main Roman
Catholic Church in Soweto, Johannesburg's largest black township.
Desmond Tutu, the black Anglican archbishop who won the 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize, is scheduled to preach.
   Organizers of the meeting said Soweto officials refused to let
the service be held at an outdoor amphitheater.
   Workshops were planned on a range of anti-apartheid tactics,
including ``non-cooperation and non-collaboration'' with the
government. The agenda suggested targets of civil disobedience
targets could include tax payments, military service and racially
oriented laws such as those mandating segregated residential areas.
   The convocation is sponsored by the South African Council of
Churches, which includes major Protestant denominations active in
the fight for black rights; the Roman Catholic Church, and several
independent African churches.
   In the opening speech the Rev. Frank Chikane, secretary-general
of the church council, said the clergy needs to find effective
alternatives to anti-apartheid violence.
   ``The issue now is how can we go about ending this evil and
unjust system,'' he said. ``The intransigence and violence of the
apartheid regime has created a pastoral crisis for the churches in
South Africa, as more and more victims of this system have resorted
to the use of force.''
   Chikane said political conditions have ``worsened drastically''
since leading clergymen decided in early February to organize the
convocation.
   He cited the effective bannings of 17 anti-apartheid
organizations, closure of two opposition newspapers and pending
legislation to restrict labor unions and opposition political
groups.
   Topics to be discussed at the convocation included providing
pastoral care for victims of apartheid and developing ``strategies
of direct action'' to force the government to negotiate an end to
apartheid.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. South Africa's 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Chikane said convocation participants should develop a separate
program to increase international pressure, urging foreign
countries to ``withdraw their support of the apartheid system
militarily, culturally, politically and economically.''
   Tutu, Chikane and other clergymen have been confronting the
government since late February, when they pledged to carry on the
work of anti-apartheid organizations that were banned.
   President P.W. Botha says some church leaders appear to be
promoting violent revolution. They accuse Botha of trying to stifle
opposition to apartheid.
