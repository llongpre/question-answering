   Anti-apartheid clergyman Allan
Boesak said Sunday that if he is killed, the government and police
should come under suspicion.
   ``Over the last week there have been more death threats,'' said
Boesak, leader of the mixed-race branch of the Dutch Reformed
Church and president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   ``I want the world to know the light of suspicion should fall on
the South African government and the police if something like that
should happen,'' he said at a news conference.
   ``One doesn't say these things to create an atmosphere of
martyrdom. It has happened before in this country. People have died
mysteriously.''
   Capt. J.L. Barnard, a spokesman for national police headquarters
in Pretoria, said Boesak had made ``a totally unfair, untrue and
malicious statement.''
   ``It is another example of how untested, unsubstantiated,
one-sided allegations are made in public in a bid to discredit the
South African Police as well as the South African government,'' he
said.
   Boesak said volunteer student guards had seen a police car drive
by his home early Tuesday. A passenger in the back seat pointed a
gun out the window, but the guards shined lights and the car sped
away, he said.
   ``This is a very sinister development,'' Boesak said. He said
police later denied dispatching a car to the area.
   Barnard said he could not comment on the facts of Boesak's
allegations about the car.
   Boesak and other South African church leaders have vowed to take
a more confrontational approach since the government banned the 17
leading anti-apartheid groups last month. Among the protesting
clergymen are Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize; and the Rev. Frank Chikane, head of the South
African Council of Churches.
   Authorities arrested 25 of the church leaders Feb. 29 when they
tried to march to Parliament with a petition protesting the bans.
The government also banned a new Committee for the Defense of
Democracy set up to take over activities of the outlawed
organizations.
   Boesak on Sunday lamented statements by the white branch of the
country's Dutch Reformed Church saying he and Tutu don't represent
the church.
   ``The white Dutch Reformed Church is saying to the state, `These
people are not the church and do not represent the church;
therefore, when you act against them, you are not acting against
the church,''' said Boesak. ``Once you create that kind of
atmosphere, almost everybody out there who is angry with us could
feel justified in threatening our lives because the church said
they were not acting against people of God.''
   Boesak's news conference was attended by a delegation from the
World Alliance. It had come to express solidarity with South
African clergymen who are challenging the government and its
apartheid segregation policies.
   Leaders of the alliance, based in Geneva, said they represent
164 churches with a worldwide membership of 70 million. Sunday's
Cape Town delegation included a Swiss minister, Edmond Perret,
general secretary of the aliance; and Joachim Guhrt, president of
the Reformed Churches of West Germany.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
