   Leaders of Christian churches
opposed to apartheid and those that long supported segregation met
today in an effort to reach consensus on ending discrimination and
building a new South Africa.
   ``For the first time there is the distinct possibility that the
Christian churches can speak with one voice on apartheid and the
country's future,'' the Rev. Frank Chikane, co-chairman of the
conference, told the Sunday Times.
   He said Christian churches represent 78 percent of the
population.
   The National Conference of Churches, billed as the largest such
gathering ever in South Africa, has attracted about 300 delegates
from 90 churches to Rustenburg, 60 miles northwest of Johannesburg.
   Virtually all the country's leading Christian clergymen were to
attend the conference, which began today, including Anglican
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984
for his anti-apartheid activism.
   The delegates will seek to reach agreement by the end of the
conference Friday on what churches should do to help South Africa
make a peaceful transition from apartheid to a non-discriminatory
democracy.
   Many of the churches represented belong to the South African
Council of Churches, often at the forefront of the anti-apartheid
movement. Chikane is general secretary of the council.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church, which argued for
decades apartheid was supported by the Bible, also was present. It
is the main church of the Dutch-descended Afrikaners who dominate
the government.
   The Dutch Reformed Church now says that apartheid is wrong and
has no biblical foundation. But virtually all Dutch Reformed
Churches remain segregated. The church says it wants to merge with
its black and mixed-race sister churches but no action is expected
for several years.
   The black and mixed-race branches have staunchly opposed
apartheid.
   Two relatively small white churches that still support apartheid
declined to attend the conference. They were the Reformed Church
and the Afrikaans Protestant Church, which broke from the Dutch
Reformed Church in 1988 to protest moves away from apartheid.
   South Africa is predominantly Christian, with large numbers of
Catholics, Anglicans, Methodists, Zionists and Pentecostalists.
There are also many Jews and Moslems in South Africa.
   Last Christmas, President F.W. de Klerk called on the country's
churches to develop a joint position on the role they envisioned
playing in the country's future.
   De Klerk has promised to dismantle the apartheid system and
negotiate a new constitution that would allow the country's 5
million whites and 30 million blacks to share power.
