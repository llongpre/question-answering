<LEADPARA>  The leader of a black group that received secret government funds sought to
distance himself from the scandal Saturday, asserting his political
independence and denying knowledge of the payments.;    But furor raged over
the disclosure of Pretoria's covert aid to the Inkatha Freedom Party, with
anti-apartheid leaders urging renewed economic sanctions and conservatives
demanding a full inquiry.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Credibility threatened;  It also threatens the credibility of Inkatha and
the government soon after some foreign leaders agreed to lift embargoes. Also,
hopes of negotiations to end white-minority rule have been raised by the
election of moderates to lead the African National Congress, Inkatha's main
rival.;    ANC leader Nelson Mandela had said the incident could lead to a
break in relations between the government and the ANC. Supporters of the ANC
and Inkatha, the country's two major black opposition groups, have clashed in
township battles that have claimed 6,000 lives in five years.;    Inkatha
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said he had no plans for an alliance with the
governing party and stressed his organization's independent role.;    The
party "has not and is not negotiating for an alliance with any other political
party," Buthelezi said, opening the group's 16th general conference in the
eastern city of Ulundi.;    Buthelezi said the payments were made to an
Inkatha bank account set up to receive contributions from anonymous donors,
and he had no knowledge of contributors.;    The ANC had often claimed Inkatha
was aided by the government, which denied the charges. But Law and Order
Minister Adriaan Vlok on Friday disclosed that the government gave Inkatha a
total of $100,000 in late 1989 and early 1990 to pay for two rallies.;    'You
are a liar';  Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace
Prize for his anti-apartheid efforts, led calls for Vlok and Defense Minister
Gen. Magnus Malan to resign. Tutu spoke before 22,000 people at the funeral of
two slain ANC members.;    "You have shown us that you are a liar," Tutu said
of Vlok. "You said you did not support any one of the two groups.";    Joe
Slovo, the Communist Party head who also is an ANC leader, said: "We are tired
of your policy of blood and smiles. We have always known that they were using
Inkatha as a private political and military army in an attempt to destroy us.
. . . Now the truth is out."  </TEXT>
