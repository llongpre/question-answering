<HEAD>Bishops To Meet About Government Threat Against Tutu</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anglican bishops from
throughout southern Africa plan an emergency meeting this week to
discuss the threat of government action against Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, the church said Sunday.
   Tutu, the first black to lead the Anglican Church in South
Africa, has been engaged in increasingly bitter confrontations with
the white-led government since last month, when it banned political
activity by leading black anti-apartheid groups.
   Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, was briefly detained three weeks ago when he and other
church leaders tried to march to Parliament with a petition
protesting the crackdown on opposition activity.
   He and other clergymen, including the Rev. Allan Boesak,
subsequently vowed to continue challenging the government. Boesak
is president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches.
   South Africa's Anglican bishops, in a statement Sunday, said the
government has ``launched a carefully planned attack'' on Tutu and
Boesak ``aimed at portraying them as Marxists and isolating them
from their churches as a prelude to state action against them.''
   President P.W. Botha met with Tutu last week and suggested that
the archbishop had aligned himself with the outlawed African
National Congress guerrilla movement.
   The bishops' meeting on Tuesday is to take place at Jan Smuts
Airport outside Johannesburg. The Right Rev. Keith Sutton, a bishop
from Litchfield, England, is to join African bishops at the meeting
as the representative of the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Right
Rev. Robert Runcie.
