   The leader of the governing
National Party said today the party's plan to eventually give blacks
a direct vote in national affairs will end South Africa's isolation.
   Anti-apartheid activists and conservatives reacted with
skepticism to the proposal, which envisions blacks having a vote in
national affairs within five years. Anglican Archbishop Desmond
Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight against
apartheid, rejected the plan outright.
   The plan is part of the party's new election platform, which also
holds out the possibility of giving the black majority a voice in
writing a new constitution.
   The party held a one-day congress in Pretoria today and accepted
the platform. No vote was held _ the congress simply adjourned with
no delegates voicing objections to the plan.
   Party leader F.W. de Klerk, designated to replace retiring
President P.W. Botha after the Sept. 6 parliamentary elections,
opened the meeting by saying the party could lead the country back
into the international community, which has condemned South Africa's
system of racial separation.
   ``Our cause is just and the doors must open. We will not have to
go crawling back, we will walk in proudly and with our heads high,''
said de Klerk, who wept when the 1,500 delegates greeted him with a
standing ovation in Pretoria City Hall.
   A less enthusiastic ovation followed his brief tribute to Botha,
who did not attend the meeting. The two have had strained relations
since March, when party leaders indicated they wanted Botha to
resign so de Klerk could take over.
   An editorial in the anti-apartheid Cape Times of Cape Town
complained that the proposal provided for a bill of rights only as a
``possible option'' and failed to say how blacks would be
incorporated into the government.
   ``Whatever its vote-winning merits for the NP, as a plan to
resolve the South African crisis it is much too tentative,'' the
newspaper said.
   Tutu said the platform it was designed to make apartheid more
comfortable rather than dismantle it.
   ``We are not interested in reform. We want to see apartheid
abolished,'' Tutue said today in Hilleroed, Denmark, where he was
attending a festival of the Danish national church.
   Ferdi Hartzenberg, deputy leader of the pro-apartheid
Conservative Party, said the plan would lead to majority rule by
South Africa's 28 million blacks and deprive the 5 million whites of
influence in the writing of a new constitution.
   Political analysts say the Conservative Party may gain some seats
in the national legislature as a result of the National Party reform
proposals.
   South Africa's apartheid system denies blacks a voice in
government and relegates them to separate housing, schools and
health care facilities. Whites also control the nation's economy.
   Many foreign governments have imposed economic sanctions and
other limitations on dealing with South Africa in efforts to force
an end to apartheid.
   Much of the National Party's platform represents a softening of
policies designed to maintain white control, and is seen as
reflecting the views of de Klerk.
   The five-year program includes removal of criminal penalties for
residential apartheid violations, more government subsidies for
multiracial schools, removal of race as the major criterion for
identifying political groups, a bill of rights, and negotiating a
new constitution with black leaders.
   In London, a leader of the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla group called the platform an advance, but from a wrong
position.
   ``It's a step forward to the extent that the National Party
recognizes that South Africa cannot be ruled on the basis of
exclusive power for the white minority,'' Thabo Mbeki, secretary for
international affairs, said Wednesday en route to the ANC's base in
Lusaka, Zambia.
   ``But the position is wrong because it continues to define people
as black and white and not as the people of South Africa. The period
of transition must emerge from negotiations.''
   Clive Derby-Lewis, spokesman for the Conservative Party, likened
the plan to ``the sales talk of an unscrupulous car dealer'' and
said the National Party was hiding plans to go further in reducing
racial laws.
   ``It is completely different from what they really intend to do.
It is real skulduggery,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``It
will generate further distrust in the Nationalists by the
electorate.''
   Beeld, the leading Afrikaans-language newspaper, pro-government
but generally moderate in its views, said the party's plan ``has the
potential to create a new South Africa'' if carried out with vigor.
