   President F.W. de Klerk must
present plans this week for the swift abolition of apartheid or
face intensified international pressure, three anti-apartheid
church leaders said Monday.
   The clergymen _ Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the Rev. Allan
Boesak and the Rev. Frank Chikane _ are scheduled to meet with de
Klerk in Pretoria on Wednesday. It will be de Klerk's first meeting
with prominent anti-apartheid leaders since he took office in
mid-August.
   The church leaders said Boesak, president of the World Alliance
of Reformed Churches, will attend the summit of Commonwealth
leaders Oct. 18 in Malaysia, and Chikane, general secretary of the
South African Council of Churches, will travel soon to Canada.
   ``Before they go, we want to hear from Mr. de Klerk personally
his response to the demands of our people, whether he persists in
his refusal to talk to the African National Congress, and what
concrete steps he intends to take within the next six months to
abolish apartheid and introduce a non-racial democracy,'' their
statement said.
   De Klerk has offered to negotiate a new consitution in five
years that would extend political rights to the black majority, but
he has vowed not to negotiate with leaders of the outlawed ANC
guerrilla movement until they renounce violence.
   Also Sunday, government television reported that Tutu's son,
Trevor Tutu, was arrested after he threatened to ``activate a
device'' on an aircraft.
   Tutu was returning to Johannesburg and asked to get off the
plane as it made a brief stop in the southern city of East London,
the South African Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   When he was refused permission, he allegedly pushed crew members
out of his way and went into the terminal building, then threatened
to ``activate a device'' in his luggage, the report said.
   In August, the 32-year-old Tutu was given an 18-month suspended
sentence for making a false bomb threat at Johannesburg's airport.
At that time, Tutu said he deliberately courted arrest as part of a
publicity stunt for his advertising agency.
   Tutu also has been convicted of five additional charges stemming
from two other confrontations with police.
   His father has not commented on his legal troubles.
