<LEADPARA>  Racism is becoming respectable in Western society because proponents are adept
at playing on people's fears in times of economic difficulty, South African
Archbishop Desmond Tutu said Saturday in Shippensburg, Pa. The 1984 Nobel
Peace Prize winner cited the rise of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke,
whom he called a "media star giving expression to the latent but hidden racism
of many.";   "The point is that racism has come out of the closet and people
are beginning to not be afraid of declaring blatantly racist views and getting
away with it," the black Anglican archbishop said at Shippensburg University.  </LEADPARA>
