   The government on Wednesday
banned political activity by 18 opposition groups, including the
nation's largest anti-apartheid organization and its biggest union
federation, in the most sweeping crackdown in a decade.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said the move would be seen by
many government opponents as a ``declaration of war.''
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, however, said the
regulations ``will contribute to a climate of stability, peaceful
coexistence, and good neighborliness among all population groups.''
   Vlok's order prohibits the United Democratic Front, which
represents more than 2 million members, from any activity except
bookkeeping and court action. The same order was applied to 16
other groups, covering most of the large militant black political
groups in South Africa.
   It gives Vlok the power to prohibit any organization ``from
carrying on or performing any activites or acts whatsover.''
   Security police notified at least nine UDF members of
restrictions on their activities, which included being confined to
home and prohibited from speaking publicly.
   UDF co-president Archie Gumede was prohibited from participating
in any UDF activities and banned from speaking to journalists.
   Albertina Sisulu, the other co-president, was ordered confined
to her home from 6 p.m. to 5 a.m., prohibited from participating in
activities of the UDF and other organizations, and barred from
addressing meetings of more than 10 people.
   ``We are all peaceful organizations trying to unite the people.
... Is this the way of reform? ... We dare say the government is
declaring war on the people of South Africa,'' Mrs. Sisulu told
reporters. She said she wasn't sure if she was prohibited from
speaking to the press.
   The 750,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions was
ordered to stick to labor issues and barred from political
activities, such as advocating holidays with special meaning to
blacks and calling for the release of detained union members.
   Anti-apartheid activists had anticipated a crackdown this year,
suggesting that President P.W. Botha's National Party government
would seek to blunt criticism from the extreme right in advance of
parliamentary by-elections next week.
   The union and several of the affected organizations said they
would consider legal action to challenge the regulations.
   ``The government's idea of reform is to smash all effective
possible political opposition in the country, no matter how
peaceful and lawful, and to rule with a jackboot,'' said Tutu, who
won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his fight against South
Africa's system of racial segregation.
   Tutu appealed to the United States and other Western countries
to intensify economic pressure on South Africa, saying that if they
do not act, ``then God help us.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said
the government was ``appalled'' at the restrictive measures.
   ``This is a giant step backward for South Africa,'' Redman told
reporters.
   Jay Naidoo, general-secretary of the trade union federation,
said, ``The closing of the avenues of democratic expression will
possibly lead to an escalation of civil conflict and violence.
There cannot be a peaceful resolution of South Africa's crisis
without freedom of expression and association, and without credible
organizations which can articulate the needs and interests of the
majority.'
   Vlok said the groups being acted against had encouraged civil
disobedience and rebellion, advocated alternative structures to
replace official ones, and waged campaigns of intimidation.
   All the groups denied wrongdoing.
   In addition to the UDF, groups affected by the ban include:
   _ The Azanian People's Organization, the largest group espousing
the black consciousness philosophy pioneered by Steve Biko, the
activist who died in police custody in 1977.
   _ The National Education Crisis Committee, which has promoted a
``People's Education'' philosphy in which black communities would
exercise greater control over their schools.
   _ The Detainees Parents Support Committee, which monitors
detentions and provides support for relatives of people detained
without charge.
   _ The Soweto Civic Association, the main anti-apartheid
community group in the country's largest black township and a key
factor behind the rent boycott that has persisted there for nearly
two years.
   Others included regional and national youth and community
organizations and the Release Mandela Committee, a group
campaigning for the release from prison of African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela.
   The outlawed ANC is the main group fighting to oust South
Africa's white-led government. Under the government's system of
apartheid, the nation's 26 million blacks have no voice in national
affairs, and the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate schools and districts.
