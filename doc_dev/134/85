   The Dutch Reformed Church joined
other Christian denominations today in rejecting apartheid as a sin
and confessed the church's role in implementing the system of
legalized segregation.
   The Dutch Reformed Church, the main church of the
Dutch-descended Afrikaners who control the government, had argued
for decades that the Bible supported apartheid. That position
isolated it from other denominations.
   But at the end of a weeklong conference of 90 Christian
churches, leaders of the Dutch Reformed Church joined in supporting
a statement condemning church participation in apartheid.
   ``We confess our own sin and acknowledge our heretical part in
the policy of apartheid which has led to such extreme suffering,''
the joint statement said. `We denounce apartheid in its intention,
its implementation, and its consequences as an evil policy.''
   The conference in Rustenburg, 60 miles northwest of
Johannesburg, was the largest ever gathering of Christian churches
in South Africa.
   The so-called Rustenburg Document also recommended that the
government remove all apartheid laws, set up a one-person, one-vote
democracy, seek equitable wealth distribution, restore land to
blacks, and arrange an affirmative action program to advance
blacks.
   Rev. Peter Potgieter, head of the Dutch Reformed Church, said
his church agreed with the basic message of the document, but not
with some of the details. He declined to be more specific, but it
appeared his reservations were with the specific political
recommendations in the document.
   He cautioned that the document was not official church policy,
which must be decided by the church's synod.
   Nonetheless, the church's participation in the conference and
its general support for the final document was its strongest
repudiation of apartheid to date. The church first said apartheid
was wrong several years ago but had not declared it a sin or
confessed its role in building the system.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, leader of the South African Council of
Churches, praised the document but said he understood the Dutch
Reformed Church's hesitation to give it full support.
   ``I feel that we have started a process, and I'm just hoping the
Dutch Reformed Church will be able to move ahead with us,'' he
said. ``I understand they're constrained, they have to answer back
to their own membership.''
   The Rustenburg Document did not cite the Dutch Reformed Church
by name. It said all South African churches should have done more
to resist apartheid.
   ``Some of us actively misused the Bible to justify apartheid,
leading many to believe that it had the sanction of God,'' it said.
   Other churches, the document said, ignored apartheid by
preaching the ``sufficiency of individual salvation without social
transformation.''
   ``We adopted an allegedly neutral stance which in fact resulted
in complicity with apartheid,'' it said.
   Still other churches condemned apartheid but did little to
resist, the statement said.
   Virtually all South Africa's leading clergymen attended the
conference, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and
Chikane.
   Tutu, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his opposition
to apartheid, said he accepted the repentance: ``The confession is
not cheaply made, and my response is not cheaply made,'' he said.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church has about 1
million members, including President F.W. de Klerk and most of the
Cabinet.
   There are separate branches for blacks and people of mixed-race,
which have staunchly opposed apartheid.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church said last month it
wants to merge with its sister churches, but no action has been
taken.
   De Klerk has promised to dismantle apartheid and negotiate a new
constitution that will allow the 5 million whites and 30 million
blacks to share power.
