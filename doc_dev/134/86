   A summit of black leaders called
by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to seek peace in South Africa began
today with the noteable absence of Zulu leader Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi.
   Buthelezi and two black homeland leaders turned down the
invitation from the Anglican archbishop to take part in the meeting
to discuss efforts to end apartheid and replace it with a
democratic state.
   The summit will talk about problems confronting South African
blacks, including black factional fighting that has claimed
thousands of lives in recent years. Most of the fighting has been
between members of Buthelezi's conservative Inkatha movement and
African National Congress supporters.
   In calling in October for the summit, Tutu said those who did
not attend would reveal themselves as enemies of peace and unity.
   Had Buthelezi turned up, it would have been the first meeting
between him and the ANC's deputy president, Nelson Mandela. The
meeting in part had been called to bring the two face-to-face to
discuss the violence.
   The leaders of the Bophuthatswana and Ciskei homelands also
declined to attend.
   ``Those who have turned down the invitation need to examine
their motives,'' Tutu said today shortly before the delegates sat
down to talk at his official residence at Bishopscourt.
   Tutu pointedly avoided a specific reference to Buthelezi in his
rebuke.
   ``We would have wanted the meeting to be a great deal more
inclusive than it is turning out to be,'' he said. ``The point is
that when you want peace you talk to anybody.''
   He said he hoped the meeting would be the beginning of a process
that would ``make a difference'' in South Africa. He said he was
particularly concerned about the intolerance among rival black
groups that led to ``violence, carnage and mayhem.''
   ``In a way we are looking for a miracle. We don't believe that
the age of miracles has ended,'' he said.
   There was no immediate comment from Mandela on Buthelezi's
absence.
   President F.W. de Klerk has promised to end white minority rule
and share power with the black majority. The government and the ANC
are expected to start talks next year on a new constitution.
   The 10 black homelands were set up by the government under the
apartheid system of racial segregation. Four of them -
Bophuthatswana, Transkei, Ciskei and Venda - are considered
independent by South Africa, but no other countries recognize their
sovereignty.
