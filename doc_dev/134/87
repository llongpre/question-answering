   An explosion early today
shattered a six-story office building used by church and
anti-apartheid groups, and police said 23 people were injured. The
structure was declared unsafe for further use.
   The type of explosive, which was believed planted in the
basement parking garage, and the identity of the bombers were not
known, police said.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu blamed the attack on ``the
perpetrators or supporters of apartheid.''
   The injured included passersby, residents of nearby apartment
buildings, and employees of the South African Council of Churches,
the main occupant of the Khotso House, which means House of Peace
in the Zulu language. Several nearby shops and apartment buildings
also were heavily damaged.
   The Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary of the council, said
the blast destroyed the council's fleet of cars parked in a
basement garage. He said police barred workers of Khotso House from
entering the building and expressed concern the council's files
might be searched.
   It was the second explosion to wreck the Johannesburg
headquarters of anti-apartheid groups. Last year, the offices of
the main black labor federation, the Congress of South African
Trade Unions, and several of its affiliates was severely damaged.
   The union congress described today's bombing as part of a
``continuous campaign against the opponents of apartheid'' and said
it had heard nothing from police about investigations of the 1987
blast at its headquarters.
   Khotso House serves as headquarters for the council of churches
and the Black Sash civil rights group, two of the most prominent
anti-apartheid organizations that so far have remained affected by
government bans.
   Several other church and human rights groups have offices in the
building, and it housed offices of the United Democratic Front
before the nationwide coalition and 17 other groups were banned in
February.
   The church council _ which represents most major Protestant
denominations except the Afrikaner-oriented Dutch Reformed Church _
has taken a lead role in the anti-apartheid movement since the
bannings.
   Tutu, a leader of the church council and winner of the 1984
Nobel Peace Prize for his anti-apartheid campaigning, said the
bombing ``represents a new low in the behavior of those who seek to
destroy the witness of the church against the evil and unchristian
policies of the South African government.''
   Chikane said, ``The darkest forces of evil are arranging
themselves against the church ... but we intend to continue telling
the truth.''
   A fire set off after the blast destroyed gas pipes in the
basement. The floor of the main lobby collapsed into the basement,
and a section of the facade was blasted open, strewing rubble into
the street.
   City engineers and fire officials visited the building after the
explosion at 1:10 a.m. and declared it unsafe for further
occupation.
   The Rev. Peter Storey, a Methodist minister who formerly was
president of the church council, called the bombing a ``bestial
act.''
   Storey later joined Chikane at a news conference at a nearby
Methodist church and told journalists the church office had
received a telephoned bomb threat moments earlier.
   Last year, there was a series of unsolved bombings and arson
attacks on offices of anti-apartheid groups and militant black
labor unions. Activists suggested the attacks were carried out by
right-wing vigilantes, either within or outside the security forces.
   This year, several restaurants and other civilian targets have
been bombed. Authorities have blamed the attacks on the outlawed
African National Congress guerrilla movement, which seeks to topple
the white-minority government.
   Under apartheid, the nation's 26 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs and the 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   State-of-emergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict
reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of
detainees, some forms of protest, and a broad range of statements
the government considers subversive. Enforcement of the regulations
has not been comprehensive.
