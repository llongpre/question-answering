   The government on Saturday
banned a church-led opposition group headed by Archbishop Desmond
Tutu and said it was a threat to public safety.
   Minister of Law and Order Adriaan Vlok said the recently created
Committee for the Defense of Democracy was barred from ``performing
any activities or acts whatsoever.''
   Police, meanwhile, issued a separate order banning a Sunday
rally in Cape Town that was to mark National Detainees Day.
   Tutu, who heads the Committee for the Defense of Democracy and
who planned to attend the rally, said clergymen instead would hold
a church service at St. George's Cathedral in Cape Town. Similar
church services are scheduled in four other cities.
   ``We are dealing with a vicious government that will not
tolerate any opposition to its evil and immoral policies,'' Tutu
told a news conference. ``They have banned a committee even before
it has started operating.''
   Tutu's group was set up following the government's Feb. 24
crackdown on black-led opposition groups. In that crackdown, the
government banned 18 anti-apartheid organizations from
participating in politics.
   The Committee for the Defense of Democracy is led by several
church leaders, including Tutu, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace
Prize, and Allan Boesak, president of the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches. The clergymen said the group would attempt to
take over some the activities previously carried out by the
restricted organizations.
   However, Vlok's latest order places the same restrictions on
Tutu's group as the other anti-apartheid groups.
   ``Certain clergy are becoming more and more involved in
preaching revolution instead of the true Christian message,'' Vlok
said in a statement.
   Vlok accused church leaders of promoting the aims of the
outlawed African National Congress, which wages a bombing and
sabotage campaign in a bid to overthrow the white-led government.
   He cited a March 1 broadcast by ANC's Radio Freedom which called
for the church in South Africa to take a more active role in
opposing the government.
   ``The ANC is currently waging a desperate attempt to extend the
revolutionary onslaught and is aiming this attack more and more at
the churches and the whites,'' Vlok said.
   ``The church (should) direct itself to the spiritual area and
the government can rely on its prayers to solve the difficult
political problems in the country,'' Vlok added.
   Tutu's group helped arrange Sunday rallies at five sites across
the country to mark National Detainees Day. However, police
Saturday banned the Cape Town ceremony, where Tutu and Boesak were
to appear.
   Police spokesman L.J. Haasbroek said he had no information on
the status of the four remaining rallies.
   Clergymen indicated earlier this week they may defy any attempt
by authorities to stop them.
   Saturday's clampdown is the latest in a series of tough
government actions aimed at political opponents in recent weeks. In
addition to banning political activity by 18 groups, the government
has imposed restrictions on individual activists and introduced
legislation to prohibit foreign funding of political activity.
   In a related development, the Black Sash, an anti-apartheid
group made up of white women, estimated Saturday that 1,500
activists remain in detention without charge.
   Black Sash, which has not been directly affected by the recent
crackdowns, said it would continue ``to defend those who are
voiceless and incarcerated.''
   An estimated 30,000 people have been detained without charge for
varying lengths of time during the 21-month-old state of emergency.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
