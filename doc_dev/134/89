   Four black activists, including
three leaders of the country's largest anti-apartheid group, were
convicted today of treason. They and seven co-defendants convicted
of terrorism could be put to death.
   The verdicts culminated a three-year trial on the role of the
United Democratic Front, a pro-black rights coalition formed in
1983. The state alleged the front incited anti-government violence
in black townships in 1984, at a time when the coalition's leaders
said they advocated peaceful protest.
   Supreme Court Justice Kees van Dijkhorst described the front as a
``revolutionary organization'' which sought to overthrow the
government.
   Three of those convicted of treason were senior leaders who had
spent 40 months in jail without bail _ Popo Molefe, 36, who was the
coalition's national secretary; Terror Lekota, 40, who was its chief
spokesman; and Moses Chikane, 40, a leader of its Transvaal Province
branch.
   Also convicted of treason was the Rev. Thomas Manthatha, an
activist in the Vaal Triangle area south of Johannesburg where the
first wave of unrest flared in September 1984. Sentences are
scheduled to begin Dec. 5.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a coalition supporter, said the
convicted men were ``gentle, rational people who in a democratic
society would be regarded as civic-minded and public spirited
leaders.''
   ``I'm shattered by the verdict,'' Tutu said. ``If any of these
people are sent to prison, I will not rest until I get them out. If
this is treason, then I am guilty of treason.''
   Eight of the 19 defendants were acquitted on all charges and
seven were convicted of terrorism related to unrest in the Vaal
Triangle.
   A crowd, which included U.S. Ambassador Edward Perkins, packed
into the courtroom but was subdued when Dijkhorst announced the
verdicts. The judge began reading 1,521-page trial summary Tuesday,
and his preliminary conclusions this week left no doubt the top
defendants would be convicted.
   ``We haven't given up. We will always maintain that the UDF is a
non-violent organization,'' said Chikane before he and his
colleagues gave clenched-fist salutes and were led away.
   ``This is very disappointing,'' said anti-apartheid activist
Helen Suzman, a member of Parliament. ``This very much narrows the
field of protest.''
   The front, banned earlier this year, was formed to mobilize
opposition to a new constitution that entrenched the exclusion of
the black majority from representation in Parliament. Under
apartheid, blacks have no vote in national affairs.
   The defendants had pleaded innocent to charges of treason,
terrorism, murder and subversion related to the central allegation
that the front and its affiliates incited violence in 1984 to make
South Africa ungovernable.
   Van Dijkhorst said the state proved treason because violence was
an intended facet of the township uprisings. He also accepted
prosecutors' allegation that the core of the front's leadership was
supported and guided by the African National Congress, the main
anti-government guerrilla movement.
   The front has maintained it endorsed the front's political goals,
such as a one-person, one-vote system, but did not promote the use
of violence.
   Before its banning in February, the front had become the largest
opposition group in South Africa, encompassing more than 600
affiliated groups with 2 million members. Most front leaders are in
detention, in hiding or barred from political activity.
   Van Dijkhorst presided over the non-jury trial since its start in
1985.
