   Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
other anti-apartheid church leaders today urged foreign bankers to
refuse to reschedule South Africa's debt payments unless the
government makes major political concessions.
   An interim debt agreement expires on June 30, 1990, and South
Africa's white-controlled government is faced with payments of at
least $8 billion by 1991 unless new terms are established.
   The four clergymen said bankers should negotiate a new agreement
only in exchange for government promises to lift the state of
emergency, free political prisoners, lift bans on opposition
groups, repeal discriminatory laws and begin talks on granting full
political rights to blacks.
   ``Without such linkage, rescheduling will amount to an extension
of time and credit to the apartheid regime to continue brutalizing
the oppressed majority in South Africa,'' said a letter released by
the South African Council of Churches.
   The letter was signed by Tutu, the first black leader of the
Anglican Church in southern Africa; the Rev. Frank Chikane, black
general-secretary of the church council; the Rev. Allan Boesak,
mixed-race president of the World Alliance of Reformed Churches;
and the Rev. Beyers Naude, a veteran white anti-apartheid activist.
   The clergymen also recommended that trade credits to South
Africa be suspended and that banks halt gold loans, in which South
Africa uses its gold reserves as collateral.
   Two weeks ago, the head of the Reserve Bank of South Africa,
Gerhard de Kock, warned that the country's economy faced stagnation
unless there was ``adequate progress in the field of political and
constitutional reform.''
   His cautiously worded speech was viewed as confirmation that a
4-year-old freeze on new loans to South Africa has seriously harmed
the economy. Since 1985, several billion dollars has left South
Africa, without replacement, to pay off old debts and purchase
imports.
   Since de Kock's speech, the economy has been battered even
further by the falling price of gold, by far the country's most
important export.
   The loan freeze has had more impact on South Africa than other
forms of economic sanctions. Most foreign companies which have
withdrawn from South Africa have sold their holdings at favorable
terms to local executives, and exports of coal, steel and farm
produce have been sustained despite embargoes by the U.S. and some
Western European countries.
   Tutu and his colleagues have been criticized harshly by whites
and conservative blacks for their advocacy of sanctions. The
critics claim sanctions will harden white attitudes while causing
harm primarily to poor blacks.
   The four anti-apartheid leaders, on a visit to the United States
earlier this month, launched a new campaign seeking to target
economic pressure more specifically.
   ``We did not go (to Washington) to ask for more sanctions,''
Tutu said in a speech Wednesday night. ``We went to ask for help to
get negotiations going that would bring an end to apartheid and to
usher in the new South Africa.''
