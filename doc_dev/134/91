   Tens of thousands of blacks in the
Soweto township stayed away from work today to protest factional
fighting that has claimed more than 500 lives over the past two
weeks.
   Buses, taxis and trains in Soweto were carrying roughly a third
as many passengers as usual into neighboring Johannesburg. Many
schools were closed and the main streets in the township of 2.5
million people were mostly empty.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, addressing a funeral for seven
people killed in the violence, told a roaring crowd that police
actions, not tribal divisions, were fueling the conflict.
   ``We have never quarreled because of tribalism,'' Tutu told some
5,000 African National Congress supporters at a Soweto
amphitheater. ``The evidence is overwhelming that the police have
not been impartial.''
   Most of the fighting in Soweto and other townships around
Johannesburg has pitted Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha
movement against Xhosas and other blacks who support the ANC, the
country's largest black political organization.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela and other anti-apartheid figures have
accused police of siding with Inkatha, a charge police deny.
   The government and many neutral observers portray the conflict
as mostly tribal fighting linked to the power struggle between the
ANC and Inkatha.
   Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi has blamed the ANC for
instigating the fighting, which has resulted in some of the worst
violence since nationwide unrest during the mid-1980s. Buthelezi
says the ANC wants to crush all opposition.
   ``Our freedom is at hand,'' Tutu said to tumultuous cheers.
``And there are those (whites) who say they don't want us to have
our freedom ... so they have made us fight one another.''
   Heavily armed soldiers and police ringed the amphitheater. No
arrests or violence were reported.
   The general strike was called by the anti-apartheid Soweto Civic
Association to ``protest the violence, police behavior and to mourn
our dead.'' Residents in neighboring townships also took part.
   A group of Xhosa and Zulu tribal chiefs sympathetic to the ANC
toured the townships Sunday and said the violence was ``not a
Zulu-Xhosa conflict, but has its roots in the system of apartheid.''
   ``The problem is the collaboration between the police and
Inkatha,'' said Mwelo Nonkonyana, a Xhosa chief.
   The delegation, which included seven Xhosa and six Zulu chiefs,
said it did not represent any political party. But the chiefs all
belong to the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa, a
group with close ties to the ANC.
   The Zulus and the Xhosas are the two largest tribes in South
Africa, but townships in the Johannesburg area have blacks from all
10 major tribes in the country.
   Townships around Johannesburg have been relatively peaceful in
recent days for the first time since the violence erupted Aug. 12.
A total of 515 blacks have died, including more than 100 in Soweto,
police said.
   Army troops and police continued to patrol the streets and
confiscate guns, spears, axes and other weapons. The government has
declared townships ringing Johannesburg ``unrest areas,'' giving
police wide powers to curb violence.
   The government lifted a state of emergency in three provinces in
June, but retained the measures in the eastern province of Natal,
where fighting between Inkatha and ANC forces has claimed about
5,000 lives in the past five years.
   In Natal, seven blacks were hacked and stabbed to death and
three were fatally shot over the weekend in separate attacks,
police said.
   Under South Africa's apartheid system of racial segregation, the
5 million whites dominate politics and the economy, and the black
majority has no voice in national affairs.
