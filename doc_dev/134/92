   President P.W. Botha issued a
stinging attack Thursday on anti-apartheid clergymen, saying they
praise guerrillas who commit horrendous atrocities.
   The accusation came in a five-page letter released by Botha in
response to a letter from the Rev. Frank Chikane, general secretary
of the South African Council of Churches, who defended the clergy's
growing role in anti-government protest.
   The exchange of letters is the latest round of a bitter
church-state confrontation that began last month when the
government banned all activities by 17 major anti-apartheid
organizations. Chikane, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and other
clegymen vowed to fill the void created by the bannings.
   On Feb. 29, Chikane, Tutu and 23 other church leaders were
arrested while trying to march to Parliament with a petition
protesting the crackdown.
   Chikane, in a letter to Botha a week ago, defended the
clergymen's decision to protest against ``ungodly acts of
oppression.''
   Botha, in his response, described himself as a devout Christian.
He said his government, which denies the black majority a vote in
national affairs, strove to broaden democracy and remove
discriminatory laws.
   Referring to the outlawed African National Congress and South
African Communist Party, Botha said to Chikane: ``You love and
praise the ANC-SACP, with its Marxist and atheistic ideology,
landmines, bombs and necklaces perpetrating the most horrendous
atrocities imaginable, and you embrace and participate in their
call for violence, hatred, sanctions, insurrection and revolution.
   ``In the name of God,'' added Botha, ``I call upon you to be
messengers of the true Christian religion and not of Marxism or
atheism.''
   ``Necklacing'' is a form of execution in which a gasoline-soaked
tire is placed around a victim's neck and set alight. In nationwide
unrest from 1984 through 1986, many blacks suspected of
collaborating with the government were necklaced by black militants.
   The ANC, which wages a bombing and sabotage campaign aimed at
undermining white-minority rule, repudiated necklacing last year
and the method has been used infrequently in recent months.
   At an emergency meeting Tuesday, Anglican bishops from across
South Africa pledged support for Tutu in his confrontation with
Botha. The bishops said they rejected the president's efforts to
depict the dispute as a choice between Marxism and the government's
programs.
