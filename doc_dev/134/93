   Two South African church
leaders, including Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, today called
for nationwide services to protest the government crackdown on 18
opposition groups.
   ``I hope our people will still be willing to try non-violent
strategies. ... But we have nothing to show for our non-violent
approaches. If violence erupts, what will be surprising is that it
has taken so long,'' said Tutu, who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize
for his fight against apartheid.
   Tutu met with the Rev. Frank Chikane, general-secretary of the
South African Council of Churches, to discuss a response to the
orders banning political activities by the opposition organizations.
   ``I would not be surprised if they (the government) act against
the church,'' Chikane told reporters.
   The meeting took place at Khotso House, the Johannesburg
headquarters for many of the restricted organizations. Black paper
was draped at Khotso House as a sign of mourning.
   Both clergymen appealed to the black majority not to lose hope,
to white voters to disassociate themselves from the government, and
to the international community to isolate South Africa.
   Newspapers, business leaders and politicans criticized the
government, saying the suppression of the major black political
groups would provoke violence.
   In Lusaka, Zambia, the outlawed African National Congress called
for ``resistance and defiance.'' The ANC is the main guerrilla
organization fighting to end white-minority domination in South
Africa.
   ``The organizations and civic bodies that have thus been banned
were committed to non-violent forms of struggle,'' the ANC said in
a statement.
   ``It is not advocacy of or engagement in armed struggle that the
regime fears, but the very expression of democratic opposition.''
   President P.W. Botha on Wednesday gave Law and Order Minister
Adriaan Vlok the power to prohibit all activity by any
organization. Vlok immediately banned 17 organizations, including
the largest anti-apartheid coalition, the United Democratic Front,
from engaging in political activities.
   He also prohibited the nation's largest labor federation, the
750,000-member Congress of South African Trade Unions, from
engaging in any political activity, including commemorating days of
importance to blacks.
   In addition, restrictions were imposed on the activities of
individual black leaders.
   ``I regret the further erosion of the rule of law. ... Banning
and detentions can never be the solution,'' said the Rev. Allan
Hendrickse, leader of the mixed-race house of Parliament. Whites
and people of mixed race are represented in Parliament, but not the
26 million black majority.
   Colin Eglin, leader of the anti-apartheid Progressive Federal
Party, said, ``The government was busy turning South Africa into a
third-grade banana republic where real power is not with the
Parliament, the courts or the people but in the hands of a
restricted political clique.''
   Gavin Relly, chairman of Anglo-American Corp., the nation's
biggest conglomerate, said, ``The curtailment of civil and
political freedoms to the interests of public order should be
subject to judicial control. Yesterday's actions are steps away
from the rule of law.''
   The New Nation, a newspaper for blacks published by the South
African Catholic Bishops Conference, was among several observers
predicting increased violence because of the regulations, which
Vlok said were meant to improve the atmosphere of peace and
security.
   ``Trade unionists have warned that by banning the commemoration
of days of mourning, the government has set the stage for massive
confrontation,'' The New Nation said. ``The ban is unlikely to stop
workers from observing these days.''
   The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper, said the government
actions were inevitable but added: ``Suppression of radical or
revolutionary movements does not solve the country's problems. It
only provides the space within which solutions can be found.''
   The orders ``violate a number of basic freedoms, more
particularly the freedoms of association and expression,'' said
Robert Charlton, vice chancellor of the University of the
Witwatersrand. He said the clampdown would provoke protest and
disruption on campuses.
   The large black political organization Inkatha was not among
those restricted. But the leadership in the KwaZulu Legislative
Assembly, headed by Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, condemned
the restriction of black organizations, including those with which
Inkatha has been feuding.
   ``There would be no need for the state of emergency if black
democracy was unshackled and if blacks were free to support the
leaders and the parties of their choice,'' the KwaZulu caucus said.
