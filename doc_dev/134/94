   President Bush told three leading South
African foes of apartheid Thursday that he would press ``in every
way possible'' to end that nation's system of racial separation,
his spokesman said, but gave no indication of any change in U.S.
policy.
   Nonetheless, the three men with whom Bush met _ Archbishop
Desmond Tutu, the Rev. Allan Boesak and the Rev. Beyers Naude _
said they were impressed that Bush showed an open attitude to their
concerns.
   Tutu, who heads the Anglican Church in South Africa, was
complimentary of Bush's attitude and expressed hopes for progress
with his administration.
   ``I think there is a very warm openness and we think the door
stands ajar. No door has been slammed in our face,'' Tutu said
after the 20-minute meeting, also attended by presidential Chief of
Staff John Sununu and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday
that Bush continues to view additional sanctions against the
minority white government of South Africa as ``counterproductive.''
   Tutu and his colleagues contrasted Bush's attitude to that of
his predecessor, Ronald Reagan.
   Once Reagan opposed economic sanctions against South Africa,
Boesak said, anti-apartheid activists felt ``there was no further
possibility of even discussing the issue.''
   Reagan vetoed the sanctions but Congress overrode him. They
banned new U.S. investment in South Africa; barred imports of South
African coal, steel, uranium and textiles, and prohibited South
African airliners from landing in the United States.
   Tutu said after meeting with Bush that he had urged the
president to ``take the moral leadership'' toward ending apartheid.
   ``We do not want to be overly optimistic,'' Tutu told reporters.
But he said he was impressed that Bush wanted to be ``a catalyst
for change'' and ``a positive influence.''
   Boesak added, ``The very fact that he values the opinion of
those of us who represent black people in South Africa, that in
itself is a sign that we did not get in the same measure from the
previous administration.''
   Tutu said there were no specific indications of a change away
from Reagan administration policies. ``But the way we were
received, the fact that we were received'' was a hopeful sign.
   The archbishop said the three asked Bush to urge the Pretoria
government to negotiate with representatives of the South African
black majority.
   Boesak spoke to Bush about the need to give hope to young South
Africans, ``and that touched a responsive cord,'' Tutu said.
   ``We said we wanted the United States ... to take the moral
leadership of the world in helping to end apartheid and bringing
the South African government to the negotiating table,'' the
archbishop said.
   To that end, Bush and Congress should support new economic and
diplomatic sanctions intended to pressure financially strapped
South Africa, the group told a news conference.
   Boesak said the most effective sanctions would target the South
African coal, oil and gold-mining industries.
   The three clergymen said they did not specifically discuss
sanctions with Bush, but do hope to have further talks with his
administration.
   Speaking for the administration, Fitzwater said that officials
``will be looking at ways to best use American pressure, influence
and leverage to bring about justice and equality to South Africa.''
   Fitzwater said that the president ``shares the archbishop's
abhorrence of apartheid'' and had ``promised to stress his
opposition'' to apartheid ``in every way possible.''
   Meeting with reporters a day earlier, Fitzwater said Bush sees
further sanctions as ``counterproductive.''
   Fitzwater said after Thursday's meeting that Bush had issued an
invitation to Albertina Sisulu, one of the leaders of the United
Democatic Front in South Africa, to visit the United States.
   She is ``restricted'' in her homeland, meaning she cannot speak
at public rallies or be quoted in news accounts. State Department
officials denied the invitation was an attempt to provoke Pretoria
to give her a passport.
   The Thursday meeting came as U.S. officials prepared for the
visit of F.W. de Klerk, who is expected to succeed P.W. Botha as
president of South Africa after Botha resigns in September. De
Klerk would be the first top South African leader to officially
visit here in 30 years.
   Anti-apartheid leaders are looking to De Klerk's ascendancy,
along with the new administration in Washington, as a window of
opportunity for change. De Klerk has called for political reforms,
but opposes complete enfranchisement for blacks, who comprise 85
percent of the nation's population.
