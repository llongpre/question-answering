   Pope John Paul II, who had
planned to bypass South Africa on his tour of the region, landed in
Johannesburg today after bad weather and mechanical trouble
diverted his flight to Lesotho.
   In Maseru, Lesotho, meanwhile, security forces surrounded a bus
filled with nuns and schoolgirls that was hijacked by armed
guerrillas as it headed for a Mass to be celebrated by John Paul.
   A nun today said some of the 71 captives had been released but
she did not know how many.
   Official Lesotho Radio said a group of ``fanatics'' had taken
over the bus Tuesday. Diplomats said the guerrillas were believed
to be members of the rebel Lesotho Liberation Army.
   The pope was informed of the hijacking, but made no comment.
   Arriving in Johnannesburg, the pope, an outspoken critic of
South Africa's racial segregation policies, did not kiss the
ground, as he customarily does the first time he visits a country.
   The pope, who is on a 10-day tour of southern Africa, spent
three hours at Johannesburg's Jan Smuts Airport before he and his
entourage left for Lesotho in a convoy of cars and buses.
   The 270-mile trip to Lesotho, a mountain kingdom completely
surrounded by South Africa, was expected to take at least five
hours.
   Foreign Minister R.F. Botha greeted the pope on the steps
leading from the plane and accompanied him into a VIP lounge at the
airport while security forces stood guard inside and outside the
terminal.
   ``We consider it a privilege to assist the Holy Father,'' said
Botha, who ordered 100 luncheons for the entourage.
   The plane's pilot, Robin Cartwright, told reporters he decided
to divert the chartered Air Zimbabwe Boeing 707 flight because of a
low cloud ceiling and because two radio beacons at the airport in
Masera, Lesotho's capital, were out of order.
   In an announcement to passengers, the pilot said conditions had
been unsuitable to bring the plane below the clouds. Masera airport
is in a valley between 3,000-4,000-foot-high mountains.
   A hard, freezing rain fell on Lesotho. King Moshoeshoe II and
other officials waited at the airport for hours before the
announcement that the pope would come by road.
   Lesotho was to be the third stop on a 10-day trip that has taken
the pontiff to Zimbabwe and Botswana. He also plans stops in
Swaziland and Mozambique.
   The Vatican said South Africa's Catholic bishops have advised
John Paul that this was not an appropriate time for him to visit
South Africa.
   The pope has said he would like to visit South Africa at some
point, but the country was not mentioned when the Vatican announced
this week that John Paul would go to Tanzania and Madagascar on
another African tour next year.
   Hundreds of thousands of South Africans had been expected to
cross into Lesotho to see the pope during his scheduled 48-hour
visit to the kingdom.
   South Africa's Catholic bishops have been active in the
anti-apartheid movement, particularly in the period since 17 major
black opposition groups were banned in February.
   The government has blamed the bishops for the pope's decision to
omit South Africa from his official itinerary, and pro-government
media have claimed many Catholics are angry at their leaders.
   Pro-government media also tried to depict the pope as having
repudiated Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South Africa's
best-known anti-apartheid cleric.
   This interpretation was based on the pope's unqualified
denunication of political violence and reservations about sanctions
and election boycotts. Tutu advocates sanctions and is urging a
boycott of upcoming, segregated municipal elections.
   Tutu has repeatedly condemned violence but says he understands
how some South African blacks feel they have no other alternative
in seeking to end white-minority domination.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs, and its 5 million whites control the economy
and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   Tutu's spokesman, John Allen, said there are no fundamental
differences between the pope and the Anglican archbishop, who met
earlier this year at the Vatican.
