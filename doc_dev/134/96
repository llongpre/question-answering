Although black South African leaders Desmond Tutu and Nelson Mandela are united 
in their insistence that economic sanctions against the government of their 
country must continue, there have been differences in their styles, missions 
and receptions during visits to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, the jovial, peace-talking Anglican archbishop who preceded political 
leader Mandela's visit by almost two months, has been cast in a kind of "John 
the Baptist" role, an advance man for Mandela's reception as a world-class 
superhero. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu "helped prepare the way for Mandela," said Edmond Browning, the presiding 
bishop of the Episcopal Church. "He has held up the moral and ethical issues of 
apartheid. Now, Mandela can come in with the necessary political skills and 
influence" with the U.S. government, Browning said. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, 58, who heads the Anglican Church in the Province of Southern Africa, has 
often come to the United States, including his recent 10-day visit to Southern 
California. His trips here are primarily to speak in churches and at 
universities and to raise scholarship money so disadvantaged black African 
youths can study at U.S. universities. 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, 71, a Methodist layman and deputy president of the African National 
Congress, is making his first U.S. visit and Tuesday became the first black 
private citizen to ever address a joint session of the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Those who know both men say the difference in their messages is in nuance 
rather than substance. 
</P>
<P>
"Both have a vision for justice and a truly nonracial charter of freedom for 
their country," said Brian Sellers-Petersen, director of the Center for South 
African Ministry, an arm of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
"Mandela talks in political terms against the supremacy of either black or 
white . . . Tutu talks in the same way but in more theological terms . . . 
about the humanity of God and his reflected glory in us," Sellers-Petersen 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Ridley-Thomas of the Los Angeles office of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference noted that both Tutu and Mandela are students of 
liberation theology -- Tutu from the theoretical perspective and "Mandela from 
a jail cell, which gives you a very different cut on it." 
</P>
<P>
Tutu, a diminutive figure with a hint of impishness often glowing from his 
eyes, is given to flowery descriptions, effusive expressions and ready wit. 
</P>
<P>
When a stained glass window bearing his likeness was unveiled at an Altadena 
church last month, he appreciatively joked that he was "tongue-tied" -- an 
affliction, he said, "many in the South African government wish would be 
permanent." 
</P>
<P>
Mandela, also charismatic, generates excitement in a quiet way. He speaks 
bluntly, softly and often in a lilting South African accent. A lawyer by 
training, he usually reads his speeches, stands very erect and greets people 
with a calm, dignified manner. 
</P>
<P>
The two African leaders, who have been close friends over the years, are not 
far apart on their views about armed struggle, according to associates. 
</P>
<P>
The politically savvy Mandela locked horns with the White House Monday when he 
politely but firmly told President Bush that he would not renounce the use of 
violence if other efforts failed to end white domination of his country. 
</P>
<P>
Though in his speeches Tutu has concentrated on the renunciation of violence, 
"he understands it," said the Rev. George Regas, rector of All Saints in 
Pasadena and a longtime Tutu friend.
