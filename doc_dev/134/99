   Only new and harsher economic pressure on
South Africa will prompt the regime to end its policy of official
racism, Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu told members of Congress
Wednesday in appealing for new sanctions against his country.
   In meetings and appearances throughout the day, Tutu repeated
his message that the longstanding U.S. policy of diplomatic
pressure has failed. He urged lawmakers to support a new bill that
would sever virtually all economic ties between the two countries.
   ``It is critically urgent that you make a moral decision,'' Tutu
told a Capitol Hill audience that included about a dozen House
members. ``Are you on the side of injustice or justice? The side of
oppression or freedom? Of inhumanity or humanity?''
   A bill that would require U.S. companies to shed their
investments in South Africa within a year and ban trade in
everything but strategic minerals and agricultural products is
pending in the House, and a similar bill was to be introduced in
the Senate Thursday by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and others.
   While supporters are optimistic about House passage, the bill's
fate is unclear in the Senate, in part because moderate Republicans
who were key to the passage of limited sanctions in 1986 are
reluctant to go along with harsher measures.
   As Tutu sought support for the legislation, a congressional
study was issued showing that South Africa's exports to 24
countries which report trading data to the International Monetary
Fund decreased by 7 percent and imports plummeted by 31 percent
from 1982 through the first half of 1987. The declines came while
overall trade was rising substantially.
   The interim report by the General Accounting Office did not say
how much of the decline was due to the limited sanctions imposed by
Congress in 1986 over President Reagan's veto. Those sanctions
banned imports of agricultural products, coal, iron, steel and
textiles, and exports of oil, arms, nuclear materials and
computers, as well as new U.S. loans.
   The report also noted that U.S. direct investment in South
Africa declined by about 10 percent since 1982.
   About 80 percent of South Africa's trade remains with six major
industrial nations: the United States, Great Britain, West Germany,
France, Italy and Japan. The United States and Great Britain
recently have decreased their share of trade, while Japan has
increased its share, the GAO found.
   Tutu said the South African government remains intransigent,
exercising what amounts to terrorism over its black majority
despite the earlier sanctions by the United States. And he
suggested that world attention to the problem has waned.
   ``I want to know what the South African government still has to
do so the world would be filled with so much revulsion and outrage
that it would move heaven and earth to rid the world of the scourge
of apartheid,'' the Anglican archbishop said, comparing the
government to that of Nazi Germany.
   ``It sometimes takes our breath away, the things that the South
African government has been able to get away with,'' he said.
   Tutu contended that ``anything that has happened in South Africa
has happened because of pressure.''
   He specifically cited the continued detention by the government
of children as young as 7 and 8 years old, with some held more than
a year and kept without contact from the outside.
   ``What must our people still suffer so that the world,
recognizing their anguish, would then say we can't allow this to
continue?'' Tutu asked.
   Rep. Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., who supported the limited
sanctions in 1986, said he was concerned that unilateral action by
the United States might have little impact without parallel moves
by other major South African trading partners like West Germany and
Japan.
   ``It would be far more effective if we had a global approach,''
Tutu acknowledged. ``But who is likely to persuade them? No country
is in a better position that the United States. ... The moral stand
you take sends out ripples.''
   In a speech at the National Press Club, Tutu faulted the current
leaders of the United States, Great Britain, West Germany and Japan
for ignoring the problem. ``They have decided that South African
blacks are expendable ... profits matter more,'' he charged.
