   After being brushed by several hurricanes this year,
the eastern Caribbean islands may get the brunt of Hurricane Hugo as
it churns westward with 150 mph winds, forecasters said Friday.
   ``It looks like this one is not going to miss the islands like
the others,'' said Jack Beven, a forecaster at the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. ``It's on the most
southerly course of any this year and that should keep it down in
the Caribbean longer.''
   A hurricane warning was posted Friday from St. Lucia to the
British Virgin Islands, and a hurricane watch was issued for the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico. A tropical storm watch was
issued for the islands of Barbados and St. Vincent.
   Rough seas have been reported around the islands since Thursday.
   Forecasters described the force four hurricane as ``extremely
dangerous.'' Category five is the scale's highest rank.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Hugo's center was near 14.9 north latitude and
56.6 west longitude, or about 340 miles east southeast of the French
resort island of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands. The storm was
moving west at 15 mph.
   With nothing in the atmosphere to divert it or sap its power,
Hugo was expected to remain on its westerly course and strengthen
somewhat during the next 24 hours, according to reports from an Air
Force reconnaissance plane.
   Beven said the center of the system could reach the Leeward
Islands on Saturday night and may move toward Puerto Rico over the
weekend. Rainfall amounts of five to 10 inches is expected in the
path of the hurricane.
   Three other hurricanes this year _ Dean, Erin and Gabrielle _
turned north toward Bermuda before reaching the Caribbean.
   But Hugo's southern course is reminiscent of Hurricane Gilbert,
which pounded Jamaica and the Mexican mainland last September. Hugo
was upgraded Friday to a force 4 storm. Gilbert was a 5, the scale's
highest rank.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the present Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Tropical storms have
maximum sustained winds of 39 mph, and reach hurricane status when
winds reach 74 mph.
