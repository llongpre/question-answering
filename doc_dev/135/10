   After flying into about 200 hurricanes,
Bob Sheets doesn't appear at all fazed by his responsibility as
director of the National Hurricane Center to predict the path of the
ferocious storms.
   Sheets, 52, friendly and low-key, is in his third season as head
of the worldwide command center for hurricane data in this suburb of
Miami.
   ``You look out there and see the chaos ... but it really works,''
he said Wednesday while surveying the low-ceiling, wide-open room
jammed with forecasters and reporters, cameramen and photographers
covering Hurricane Hugo.
   Hugo, whose winds dropped to 105 mph after churning through the
Caribbean, is the most powerful of nine named storms this year, six
of which became hurricanes. Storms like Hugo make Sheets a household
name.
   Killer hurricanes like Hugo, which left at least 25 dead, tens of
thousands homeless and millions of dollars in damages in its rampage
through the eastern Caribbean, make Sheets a household name when
they threaten the U.S. mainland.
   A typical half hour for Sheets: do live feeds for the networks
and local television stations; squeeze in a few minutes with a print
reporter; grab a phone to talk with a government official in Myrtle
Beach, S.C.; consult with his team of forecasters on incoming data.
   Then it starts all over again.
   ``He's a cool, collected person _ the ideal person for this
pressure job,'' said Gil Clark, a 34-year veteran of the hurricane
center. ``He's got a real feeling for hurricanes and everything that
goes with it.''
   Sheets also gets high marks from his colleagues for scientific
ability and poise.
   ``He worked here as a forecaster before becoming deputy director
and then director,'' said hurricane specialist Hal Gerrish. ``He's
not just an administrator. He can sit down and be able to pull one
of the shifts with us.''
   One of the biggest pressures on Sheets is to pinpoint where a
hurricane will blast ashore _ a decision that can result in
evacuations and huge expenditures. It is one of his biggest
frustrations.
   ``It's frustrating not to be able to say with a great deal of
confidence this is where it's going to move,'' said Sheets.
   Hugo has been an especially difficult storm to forecast beyond a
couple of days, but he said the devastation in the Caribbean had
been lessened because of forecasts and warnings issued by the center.
   Sheets, in 16 years of research flights, had his share of close
calls flying into the eye of hurricanes. He says he finds his
current job very fulfilling despite offers to join reconnaissance
crews checking Hugo.
   ``There's nothing there that I need to go and experience again,''
he said, grinning.
