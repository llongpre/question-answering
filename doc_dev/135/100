   Planning ahead is the key to hurricane safety,
and with Hurricane Hugo posing a threat to the United States,
residents of coastal areas may want to consider how to cope with the
danger.
   The storm surge, a wall of water pushed ahead of these storms,
poses perhaps the greatest threat, although high winds and flooding
are also major hazards, weather experts warn.
   For low-lying communities, evacuation is the safest measure, and
officials have warned that many fast growing communities lack plans
and proper roads to get everyone to safety in the face of a
fast-approaching storm.
   The time needed to evacuate many coastal areas is greater than
the available warning time, the American Meteorological Society has
said. And many people are complacent or unaware of the danger, with
80 percent of the 40 million people living on the Atlantic and Gulf
coasts never having experienced a hurricane.
   ``It is imperative that coastal residents and visitors alike take
the threat seriously and acquaint themselves with hurricane safety
rules, and evacuate immediately if advised to do so,'' says Robert
Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables,
Fla.
   Safety suggestions compiled by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and Federal Emergency Management Agency
include:
   _Keep track of the developing weather through local radio and
television or NOAA Weather Radio, which broadcasts on special
frequencies that can be received by inexpensive weather radios.
   _Learn local evacuation routes and shelter locations. If in a
vulnerable area, be prepared to leave, and do so promptly if
authorities recommend it.
   _Keep the automobile fully fueled, and make a supply of fresh
water, batteries and food is available.
   _Tape, board and shutter windows and tie down mobile homes before
leaving. Wedge sliding glass doors to prevent them from lifting off
their tracks.
   _Bring in pets.
   _Anchor small boats or move them to a safe shelter if there is
time.
   _Secure outdoor objects that might be blown away and become
dangerous missiles. These include such things as garbage cans,
garden tools, signs, porch furniture and so forth.
   _Remain at home only if it is sturdy and not in an area subject
to flooding. If staying home, keep away from windows. Fill
containers and bathtubs with several days supply of water.
   _Avoid loose or dangling wires and report them immediately to
your power company. Report broken water mains, since low pressure
may hamper fire fighting.
   After the storm has passed:
   _Seek assistance if needed in Red Cross shelters.
   _Stay away from disaster areas unless you are qualified to help.
   _Be wary of fly-by-night repair services rushing into an area,
collecting money for work and then disappearing or doing shoddy
repairs. Check references, and wait if necessary.
   _Check refrigerated food for spoilage if the power has been off.
