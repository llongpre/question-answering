   The 1989 hurricane season, marked by the costliest
storm in U.S. history, officially ended today with yet another
tropical storm forming in the Caribbean.
   At 8 a.m. EST, Tropical Storm Karen, with 50 mph winds, was
about 125 miles south-southwest of Havana and was not expected to
strengthen, said the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables. It was drifttng toward Cuba at about 5 mph.
   Depressions become named storms when their sustained winds reach
39 mph; hurricanes have winds of at least 74 mph. Karen is the 11th
named storm of the season, which began June 1.
   The six-month season was far less deadly than 1988's, in which
550 people died in storms.
   This year's storms killed 84 people, including 56 in the United
States, said meteorologist Mark Zimmer. Hurricane Hugo was blamed
for 49 deaths, including 21 in this country. It slammed into South
Carolina on Sept. 21.
   ``I've seen greater damage in smaller areas,'' said Bob Sheets,
director of the hurricane center. ``But I've never seen it on such
a large scale where you go mile after mile with such massive
damage.''
   Overall damage from Hugo totaled about $10 billion. In the
United States, it caused a record storm damage of about $7 billion.
Most of the U.S. damage was around Charleston.
   The U.S. Virgin Islands are racing to recover from Hugo in time
for the tourist season.
   ``We are still in a sense reeling from the effects of Hugo but
that didn't dampen our spirit,'' said Alexander A. Ferrelly,
governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands. He said Wednesday that St.
Thomas and St. John are ready for winter tourists and St. Croix
would be ready by early 1990.
   It was the most expensive disaster for the American Red Cross
since the organization began 110 years ago. Latest figures show the
agency has spent about $38 million in the Caribbean and the
Carolinas, said Michael Caudill, a spokesman in Washington.
   The hurricane season, which began June 1, had four tropical
storms, counting Karen, and seven hurricanes. The storms also were
stronger than usual, said Sheets.
   Last year, there were seven tropical storms and five hurricanes.
The Atlantic season usually has 10 named storms. Normally, only
five or six whip up the 74-mph sustained winds to become a
hurricane.
   Hugo, the fifth major Atlantic hurricane in the last decade to
reach U.S. shores, may have marked the end of a 30-year period of
fewer, weaker hurricanes, Sheets said.
   ``There have been fewer of the stronger hurricanes making
landfall since the 1960s,'' Sheets said. ``Now maybe we're starting
to return to more normal activity like we had in the '50s and
'60s.''
   During the 1950s, eight major hurricanes hit the United States,
while seven struck the following decade.
   After Hugo, the most damaging tropical system this year was
Tropical Storm Allison. It dumped large amounts of rain and caused
11 deaths and $500 million damage in Texas and Louisiana.
