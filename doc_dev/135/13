   Hurricane Gustav curved away from outer Caribbean
islands Monday and aimed its 105 mph winds toward open ocean.
   Gustav _ which reached hurricane strength Sunday while heading
west toward the Leeward Islands _ turned north onto a path that
would skirt the island chain and take it out into the Atlantic.
Storm warnings in the islands, which stretch north from the
Venezuelan coast, were droppped, but forecasters said rough seas
and surf might be experienced.
   ``They'll probably get a little of the fringe effects,'' said
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables. ``But the hurricane itself looks like it's going to
pass to the east.''
   At 3 p.m. EDT, Gustav was centered near 17.4 degrees north
latitude and 58.2 degrees west longitude, or about 240 miles east
of Antigua. It was moving north at 10 mph and was expected to hold
that course and speed for the next day or two.
   Gustav had hurricane-force winds extending 35 miles from its
center and tropical storm-force winds extending outward 175 miles.
   Over the weekend, islanders with strong memories of last year's
Hurricane Hugo had scrambled to prepare for Gustav's expected
onslaught.
   In Montserrat, a British colony devastated by Hugo, banks,
hardware stores, pharmacies and supermarkets opened Sunday.
   Utilities called workers back from vacation, and the 100-member
police and 50-strong volunteer army were fully mobilized.
   ``The level of preparedness and the level of activity is
significantly greater than it was last year'' before Hugo, said
Reuben Meade, the government's director of development. ``They are
out there in earnest.''
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Hortense remained about a thousand
miles to the east in the mid-Atlantic, a hindrance only to shipping.
   At noon EDT Monday, Hortense had winds of 45 mph. It was moving
north-northwest at about 8 mph.
   The storm was centered near 19.1 degrees north latitude, 41.8
degrees west longitude, or about 1000 miles west of the Cape Verde
Islands of Africa. It wasn't expected to gain strength, but
forecasters planned to keep an eye on it.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained
winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph.
