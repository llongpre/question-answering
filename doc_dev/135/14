   Tropical Storm Hugo today edged closer to becoming a
hurricane as it began following the path of its predecessor,
Gabrielle.
   The eighth named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season
had sustained winds of 65 mph. At 6 a.m. EDT it was centered near
latitude 12.7 north and longitude 42.0 west, 1,300 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles.
   The storm was headed west at about 20 mph and was expected to
hold its course through today, possibly affecting the Caribbean in
four or five days. Forecasters said Hugo could become a hurricane,
with 74 mph winds, within a day or so.
   ``It's not as big a system (as Gabrielle) and it seems to be
getting better organized,'' said forecaster Gil Clark of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Tropical Storm Gabrielle continued dissolving in the cold water
of the northern Atlantic, about 280 miles south of Cape Race,
Newfoundland.
   The former hurricane's winds today were down to 40 mph, 1 mph
over the minimum for tropical-storm classification, but still
causing 6- to 10-foot swells along Nova Scotia. Swells as high as 16
feet from Gabrielle were blamed for the disappearances of at least
seven people from New York to Maine in the past week.
