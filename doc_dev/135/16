   The region's mightiest hurricane in
a decade lashed Puerto Rico today after battering the U.S. Virgin
Islands and other tourist havens, leaving at least nine people dead
and thousands homeless.
   The National Weather Service said Hurricane Hugo hit the eastern
tip of Puerto Rico and skirted the northern coast, packing 125 mph
winds and a 6-foot tidal surges. Forecasters expected up to 15
inches of rain and flooding and mudslides all over the island.
   ``We're getting ravaged,'' said ham radio operator Fernando
Garcia in San Juan. ``Part of my aluminum siding is gone, my next
door neighbor's aluminum siding is gone ....''
   There were reports of heavy damage, some looting, no water and no
electricity in Puerto Rico.
   At noon EDT, Hugo's center was near latitude 18.6 degrees north
and longitude 66.0 west about 20 miles north of San Juan, said the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   On Sunday, Hugo plowed west-northwest through the eastern
Caribbean, slamming into the U.S. and British Virgin Islands with
100 mph winds and rains that caused heavy flooding and destroyed
homes.
   Five people were reported killed, 80 injured and more than 10,000
homeless on the French island of Guadeloupe, relief officials said.
Corrugated steel roofs were torn off, power lines ripped free and
crops were destroyed. The airport's control tower was knocked out of
commission, permitting only visual landings by relief planes.
   Two people were killed in Antigua and one in Montserrat,
according to Beacon Radio in Anguilla. Ham radio operators reported
at least five deaths in Montserrat, but there was no official
confirmation.
   Nearly all of Montserrat's 12,000 residents were homeless and
schools, hospitals and the police department all suffered serious
damage, said ham radio operator Stuart Haimes of Queens, N.Y.
   Police said a man was electrocuted in Puerto Rico when he touched
a power line while removing a TV antenna from his roof in preparing
for the storm.
   Off St. Thomas, charter boat captain O.B. O'Brian told CNN by
ship-to-shore telephone this morning:
   ``Looking down the lagoon, we see a lot of sailboats intertwined
and a lot of sails ripped and a lot of sails down. It looks pretty
bad ... There was a lot of wind.''
   Most of the Virgin Islands' 106,000 residents live on St. Thomas.
On St. Croix, a ham radio operator said the winds tore off the roofs
from up to 75 percent of the homes.
   Officials said stores in the St. Croix town of Christiansted were
heavily damaged, and there were reports of looting. National Guard
Adjutant Gen. Robert Moorehead said 1,000 people were evacuated to
rescue shelters in St. Croix.
   Storm watches were in effect for parts of the Dominican Republic,
and a hurricane warning was issued for the southern Bahamas,
including the Turks and Caicos islands.
   Hugo was moving at 10 mph west-northwest alongside Puerto Rico, a
U.S. commonwealth with 3.3 million people. Hurricane-force winds
extended up to 75 miles from its center. The weather service said
winds ripped the roof off a baseball stadium on the offshore island
of Vieques, about 10 miles to the east with about 7,000 residents.
   High winds Sunday blew roofs off six houses in the offshore
island of Culebra. Luis Munoz Marin International Airport, by far
the region's biggest, was closed, as were schools, banks, courts and
government offices.
   The National Guard had been mobilized in both the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico.
   Meteorologist Jesse Moore at the National Hurricane Center said
it was too early to tell whether Hugo would strike the U.S.
mainland. He said the storm was expected to be off the southeastern
Bahamas by Wednesday and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''
   Residents of hilly areas where flash floods are a danger were
urged to evacuate, and Social Services Secretary Carmen Sonia Zayas
said 11,300 people were moved from flood-prone coastal areas to
rescue shelters.
   The Port Authority also said cruise ships scheduled to arrive in
San Juan, where one-third of the island population lives, had been
routed elswhere.
   Hugo uprooted trees and knocked out power in the British Virgin
Islands. On the resort island of Tortola in the British Virgin
Islands, residents said there were numerous injuries and scores of
homes destroyed.
   ``We are aware of the widespread damage. We may have to declare
the area a disaster area,'' said Louis Walters, education minister
in the British Virgin Islands.
   The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were last hit by a major
hurricane in 1956, when Betsy caused extensive damage and killed 11
people in Puerto Rico.
   Officials in Guadeloupe said many buildings were damaged.
   The mayor of St. Francois, a village on the island's eastern end,
told Radio Caraibe Internationale that there was nothing left of it.
   ``Aside from a few houses, almost all the rest were destroyed,''
said Mayor Ernest Moutoussamy. He said several hotels suffered
serious damage.
   In Paris, a plane was sent Sunday with 60 rescue workers and
emergency supplies for Guadeloupe, and two more were standing by
waiting for Caribbean airports to reopen.
   Hugo is the fourth hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season,
which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
   It is the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since
Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people
in the Caribbean and Florida.
