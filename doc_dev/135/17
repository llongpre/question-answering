   Tropical Storm Hugo would soon strengthen into a
hurricane as it churned across the Atlantic toward the Caribbean,
forecasters said Tuesday, and Gabrielle whipped up heavy swells as
it moved away from Nova Scotia.
   Hugo, the eighth named storm of this Atlantic hurricane season,
had winds of 65 mph with stronger gusts in squalls, and forecasters
said conditions were right for it to grow stronger.
   ``It still looks impressive on the satellite imagery, meaning it
has continued to strengthen some,'' forecaster Max Mayfield of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables said, adding that
Hugo could be up to 74 mph hurricane-strength winds in a day or two.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Hugo's center was near latitude 12.9 north and
longitude 39.0 west, or about 930 miles west-southwest of the
westernmost Cape Verde islands. It was headed west at about 20 mph
and was on a path that could take it to the Caribbean in about five
days, forecasters said.
   Tropical Storm Gabrielle's winds were down to 40 mph, but still
causing swells as high as 16 feet along the south coast of Nova
Scotia and parts of New England, forecasters said.
   Gabrielle was expected to weaken as it accelerated to the
northeast over northern Atlantic waters.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle's center was near latitude 41.7
north, longitude 55.0 west, or about 345 miles south southwest of
Cape Race, Newfoundland. It was drifting east-northeast at about 10
mph.
