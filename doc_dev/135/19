   Hugo became a hurricane Wednesday evening as it sped
westward toward the Caribbean, but forecasters said it was too early
to determine whether it was a threat to land.
   ``The longer it heads west, the more concern it is to us,'' said
Hal Gerrish, a forecaster for the National Hurricane Center. ``But
we're not sure yet where it will go _ there are too many things that
can happen.''
   Hugo's most recent predecessors, hurricanes Dean, Erin and
Gabrielle, turned north into the open Atlantic before reaching the
Caribbean, Gerrish noted. But last year's killer Hurricane Gilbert
remained on the westward course, wreaking havoc on the Caribbean and
Mexico.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Hugo's center was located near 12.9 north
latitude and 46.3 west longitude, or about 965 miles east of the
easternmost Lesser Antilles, and was moving west at 20 mph.
Sustained winds reached 75 mph, just over the hurricane threshold,
and further strengthening was expected.
   Meanwhile, Gabrielle was downgraded to an extratropical storm as
it moved through the North Atlantic, and the center stopped issuing
bulletins on it. Its last position was about 225 miles southeast of
Cape Race, Newfoundland, Canada, moving northeast at 20 to 25 mph
with winds of 55 mph.
   Gabrielle and Hugo are the seventh and eighth named storms of the
1989 Atlantic hurricane season. They become storms when sustained
winds reach 39 mph and are classified as hurricanes when the
strength increases to 74 mph.
