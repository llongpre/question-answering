   A hurricane watch was posted in the eastern
Caribbean today as Hurricane Hugo churned westward with winds of 125
mph and some stregthening predicted, forecasters said.
   The hurricane watch was posted from St. Lucia to the British
Virgin Islands, and a tropical storm watch was issued for the
islands of Barbados and St. Vincent, according to the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   ``The fringe effects of the storm are already being felt,'' said
forecaster Gil Clark. ``The seas are already getting rough off the
islands because of swells emanating off the storm.''
   At noon EDT, Hugo's center was located near 14.4 north latitude
and 54.1 west longitude, or about 500 miles east southeast of
Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands. The storm was moving west at 15
mph, down from a peak of 20 mph Wednesday night.
   ``The only way it's going to miss those islands is it's going to
have to swerve northward,'' Clark said.
   He added that forecasters saw no indications Hugo would turn that
way. ``We've been lucky this year. We've had two or three storms
head toward the islands and then turn north. Maybe we'll get lucky
again but it doesn't look like it in ths case.''
   Three of this season's Atlantic hurricanes _ Dean, Erin and
Gabrielle _ turned north into the open Atlantic before reaching the
Caribbean, forecaster Hal Gerrish said.
   Last year, killer Hurricane Gilbert held the westward course,
pounding Jamaica and Mexico.
   Hugo developed quickly into a major storm. Its highest sustained
winds rose by more than 35 mph Thursday alone and were estimated at
120 mph this morning, inching up to 125 mph at noon.
   ``It really was amazing how fast the eye formed and it almost
doubled its winds,'' Clark said. Conditions favored the hurricane's
strengthening today; forecasters expected no change in its motion.
   Hugo's winds classify it as a 3 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, a
sort of Richter scale for storms. Gilbert, the strongest hurricane
on record, was a 5 _ the scale's highest rank.
   A reconnaissance plane was to be dispatched to investigate the
storm, Clark said.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane
season. Tropical storms have sustained winds of 39 mph, and reach
hurricane status when winds hit 74 mph.
