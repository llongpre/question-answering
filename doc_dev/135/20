   Hurricane Hugo ripped away rooftops
and uprooted trees in Guadeloupe and Dominica early Sunday and
approached other popular resort islands of the eastern Caribbean
with deadly winds of up to 140 mph.
   Forecasters described Hugo as ``extremely dangerous'' and said it
could be the most powerful hurricane to hit the region since
Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated 1,200 people
in the Caribbean and Florida.
   ``The eye of the hurricane is directly above Guadeloupe,'' Israel
Matos, director of the National Weather Service bureau in San Juan,
said Sunday at 1:25 a.m. EDT. It was impossible to telephone to
Guadeloupe early Sunday morning as telephone circuits were either
jammed or busy.
   At midnight EDT Saturday, Hugo's center was near 16.3 north
latitude and 61.1 west longitude, about 350 miles east-southeast of
San Juan. After hitting the French island it was expected to move
north toward Puerto Rico, said forecaster Martin Nelson at the
National Hurricane Center near Miami.
   The hurricane was moving west-northwest at 12 mph, sending
showers and gusty winds to the eastern edge of the Caribbean and
threatening islands over a 600-mile arc stretching from St. Lucia to
Puerto Rico.
   The storm's effects would start to be felt in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico by Sunday morning, the National Weather Service in
San Juan said.
   By midnight there was a blackout in most of Guadeloupe as
authorities turned off electricity as a precautionary measure,
government radio RFO said. The island experienced very strong winds,
which blew the metal roofing off some homes on Guadeloupe's eastern
side late Saturday night.
   In Dominica to the south there were power outages on the island's
north side where strong winds uprooted trees, the radio said.
   Radio France Internationale from Paris, monitored in San Juan
shortly before midnight Saturday, said French authorities were
preparing to send emergency supplies and personnel to Guadeloupe.
   ``It's a very dangerous storm, extremely dangerous in fact,''
Nelson said.
   Forecasters said if the storm remains on its northwesterly course
it would pass over St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands about 6 p.m.
Sunday and continue on to the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico
early Monday. San Juan, the Puerto Rican capital with a population
of 1.1 million, is on the northeastern coast.
   Earlier, forecasters had said the hurricane was headed for Puerto
Rico's southern coast.
   The National Weather Service in Miami issued hurricane warnings
at 3 p.m. EDT for the U.S. Virgin Islands and for Puerto Rico, which
previously had been on a hurricane watch. The warnings were posted
from Martinique northward and westward through Puerto Rico,
including the British Virgin Islands and St. Martin and surrounding
islands.
   Tropical storm watches for the islands of Barbados and St.
Vincent were discontinued, and a warning for St. Lucia was changed
to a tropical storm watch.
   Forecasters said waves 10 feet above normal could be expected
near the eye of Hugo, and warned of heavy rain and flooding.
   In Guadeloupe and Dominica, the first two islands directly in
Hugo's path, civil defense officials prepared to evacuate people to
rescue shelters.
   Franklin McDonald, head of the Pan-Caribbean Disaster
Preparedness and Prevention Project in Antigua, said several relief
teams from the United States already were headed to the region.
   State radio said a heavy downpour set off a landslide early
Saturday on Dominica's isolated southeast side, which faces the
Atlantic, partly blocking a road but causing no injuries. The Public
Works Department deployed earth-moving equipment at strategic points
across the island.
   Non-critically ill patients at Princess Margaret Hospital in the
capital of Roseau were sent home late Friday and early Saturday to
make room for possible hurricane victims.
   The government of Dominica urged its citizens via radio to take
emergency precautions, and said police were put on alert ``to deal
with any security problem which might arise.'' There was widespread
looting after Hurricane David battered the tiny island of 81,000
people.
   In Guadeloupe, which has a population of 340,000, heavy traffic
built up in Pointe-a-Pitre, the biggest city, late Friday as people
rushed supermarkets and hardware stores, stocking up on food,
bottled water and supplies such as flashlights, batteries, timber,
nails and tape.
   The government ordered all pedestrians and cars to be off the
streets by 6 p.m. in what amounted to a curfew. The directions were
broadcast on radio stations.
   Residents boarded up doors and windows of their homes and many on
the Atlantic side fled inland.
   At Le Meridien, a luxury, 271-room beachfront hotel in St.
Francois, a woman who answered the telephone said guests were being
moved from ground-floor rooms and those facing the ocean. But she
said none of the 100 guests had checked out.
   ``Many people are worried; nobody's hysterical,'' said the hotel
employee, who asked not to be identified by name.
   In Paris, Air France canceled all three of its flights scheduled
Saturday to Guadeloupe's sister island, Martinique, and British
Airways canceled its flight from London to Antigua, where the
airport was closed.
   Officials in Puerto Rico said up to 6,000 people might have to be
evacuated from flood-prone areas if Hugo passes near the densely
populated island of 3.3 million.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
