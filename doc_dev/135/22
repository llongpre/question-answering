   The season's 10th tropical storm formed today after
a depression strengthened rapidly off the Mexican coast,
forecasters said.
   Tropical Storm Jerry had maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and
was moving north through the Gulf of Mexico at about 8 mph,
according to the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Forecasters predicted some further increase in Jerry's strength
today. They said there was about a 10 percent chance of the storm's
center passing within 65 miles of various Gulf Coast points from
Brownsville, Texas, to Gulfport, Miss. by 7 a.m. Monday.
   At noon EDT, the storm's center was located at 22.3 north
latitude and 93.4 west longitude, or about 580 miles
south-southwest of New Orleans.
   Jerry is the first tropical weather system since Hurricane Hugo
ravaged the Caribbean and South Carolina coast last month.
   Tropical depressions become named tropical storms when maximum
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Hurricanes are declared when winds
hit 74 mph.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November.
