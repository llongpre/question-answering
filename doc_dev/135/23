   Hurricanes beginning with G's and H's tend
to make people along the coast a little nervous. There was Hazel in
1954, Gracie in 1959, Gilbert _ which raked the Caribbean in 1988.
And then there was Hugo.
   It's no wonder people are keeping an eye on Gustav and Hortense,
and an ear to the phone at national hurricane central in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   ``People are saying, `It better not come hit us; we just got our
house put back together,' '' said Darryl Graham, an employee at
Isle of Palms Hardware.
   Many residents on the Isle of Palms are still living in houses
with plastic covering the holes left by last September's Hurricane
Hugo, which killed 29 people in South Carolina and caused an
estimated $5.9 billion in damage.
   ``Folks around (here) are planning to load everything up and
head out early if it even looks close, but we aren't selling
batteries and water yet,'' he said.
   Despite word from the National Weather Service that Hurricane
Gustav and Tropical Storm Hortense will skip the East Coast,
coastal residents are wary.
   Gustav, with winds of 105 mph, began turning north Sunday night,
and Hortense is continuing a northward path that should keep both
well out in the Atlantic Ocean, said Silvia Graff, a meteorologist
with the National Weather Service's hurricane center in Coral
Gables.
   ``Fortunately, it looks like the steering currents will keep
both Gustav and Hortense away from the U.S. and the Caribbean
islands,'' Ms. Graff said.
   ``At least this time around, it looks like South Carolina is off
the hook.''
   Ms. Graff said weather service phones were ``ringing off the
hook,'' with many of the calls coming from South Carolina.
   Jackie Ford, a Lady's Island Marina dockmaster who is thought by
many in the area to have a sixth sense when it comes to predicting
the landfalls of large storms, said he spent most of Monday
puzzling over the storms' directions.
   ``I've got just one pin on the chart, and I don't have a good
feeling for it one way or the other,'' Ford said. ``It's a little
too early to tell, but I guarantee you we will be keeping an eye on
both of them.''
   Meteorologists watching Gustav believe it's unlikely the
hurricane will turn toward the U.S. East Coast as it makes its way
north.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Gustav's center was located near 22 degrees north
latitude and 58 degrees west longitude, or about 425 miles
northeast of Antigua. It was moving north at about 13 mph and was
expected to hold that course and speed through Wednesday.
   Tropical Storm Hortense remained a danger only to shipping. The
storm was centered near 23.2 degrees north latitude and 45.5
degrees west longitude, or about 1,420 miles west-northwest of the
Cape Verde islands. Little change in its strength was expected
either.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained
top winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph.
