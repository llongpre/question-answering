   Islanders boarded up their homes and
bought supplies Tuesday as Hurricane Hugo, blamed in at least 25
deaths, swept along the Bahamas after leaving an estimated 50,000
people homeless in the eastern Caribbean.
   Weather officials said the hurricane would begin affecting the
British colony of Turks and Caicos Islands southeast of the Bahamas
chain on Tuesday night. The storm was moving on a parallel course
east of the Bahamas.
   ``All of the islands at some time or another are going to get
some effects (from Hugo),'' said Noel Risnychok, specialist with the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas feared Hugo could drift westward
toward more populated islands, including New Providence.
   That island, which includes the Bahamas capital city of Nassau,
is the most populated with an estimated 135,000 people.
   The government of the Bahamas Tuesday downgraded the hurricane
watch for the central Bahamas to a tropical storm warning. A
tropical storm warning remained in effect for the southern Bahamas,
though it was discontinued for the Turks and Caicos Islands.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Tuesday, the hurricane's center was near
latitude 23.8 degrees north and longitude 69.5 west, about 190 miles
east northeast of Grand Turk Island in the southern Bahamas,
according to the National Weather Service.
   Hugo was moving in a northwesterly direction at about 12 miles
per hour with its highest sustained winds at 105 mph.
   Government officials in Nassau were monitoring the hurricane but
had not made any special preparations Tuesday for Hugo, said Bill
Kalis, press secretary for the government's information office.
   Residents were told to monitor weather advisories but could go
about their daily businesses, he said.
   ``They were telling everybody to get the water, the lamps
handy,'' said Dorothea Seymour of Naussau, who has a stall at The
Straw Market on Bay Street. ``We never had a storm here for some
years. We're always hearing about storms, but they never come.
   ``Some people worry, some people don't,'' she said.
   ``Although the indications are that it's going to move east of
the more populated areas, no one is relaxing their vigil because it
can change direction,'' Kalis said.
   Kalis said residents were gathering supplies in preparation.
   ``The stores have reported brisk sales of supplies such as
flashlight batteries and lumber for boarding up windows,'' he said.
   Weather officials in the Bahamas said Hugo's threat to the
northwestern Bahamas has intensified because of the
west-northwestern drift that the hurricane is expected to take.
   ``This westward drift can spell trouble for the northwestern
Bahamas which includes the bulk of the population,'' said Ken
Lightbourne, chief meteorological officer for the government's
weather agency in Nassau.
   Officials with Paradise Island Airlines in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
said they had not changed flight schedules yet, but were monitoring
the hurricane's path.
   ``We're just keeping a close eye on it like everybody else,''
said Hugh Riesdorph, director of flight operations for the airlines.
   He said the company makes 11 round-trip flights daily from Fort
Lauderdale and Miami to Paradise Island, which is linked by a bridge
to Nassau.
