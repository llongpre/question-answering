   Hurricane Hugo pounded the U.S.
Virgin Islands and headed on a collision course with Puerto Rico
early Monday after ripping across the northeast Caribbean with 140
mph winds and leaving at least nine people dead.
   About 80 people were injured on the French island of Guadeloupe
and 4,000 were left homeless, French officials said.
   The region's most powerful storm in a decade was expected to plow
into Puerto Rico early Monday. The government mobilized the National
Guard, and residents rushed for last-minute supplies and taped and
boarded windows.
   At 3 a.m. EDT Monday, Hugo's center was located near latitude
17.6 degrees north and longitude 64.7 west, about 105 miles
east-southeast of San Juan, said the National Weather Service in
Florida.
   The storm slowed slightly from 12 mph to 9 mph, the Weather
Service said. The Virgin Islands' population is 106,000, and Puerto
Rico has 3.3 million people.
   Hurricane-force winds of nearly 100 mph ripped away roofs and
knocked out power on St. Thomas and St. Croix, about 70 miles east
of Puerto Rico, officials said. Those two islands have most of the
Virgin Islands' population.
   Officials said stores in the St. Croix town of Christiansted were
heavily damaged and there were reports of looting.
   National Guard Adjutant Gen. Robert Moorehead said 1,000 people
were evacuated to rescue shelters in St. Croix.
   Jesse Moore, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in
Florida, said it was too early to tell if the storm ``will even hit
the United States (mainland). The closest we can forecast it is to
be off the southeastern Bahamas by Wednesday. After that it's
anybody's guess.''
   The storm caused widespread damage early Sunday as it passed near
Guadeloupe. Damage also was reported on the islands of Martinique,
Antigua and Dominica.
   Guadeloupe state radio said five people were killed on that
island. In Paris, French officials said up to five people had been
killed there. Neither report gave further details.
   Gabrielle Carabin, mayor of the village of Le Moule on the
northwestern coast of Guadeloupe, said in an interview on the
island's Radio Caraibe Internationale that two village residents
were killed. She did not elaborate.
   Beacon Radio in Anguilla said one person was killed in Montserrat
and two in Antigua, but it gave no details.
   In the central Puerto Rican town of Utuado, a man was
electrocuted when he touched a power line while removing a
television antenna from his roof to prepare for the storm, police
said. He was identified as Antonio Alago Gonzalez, 51.
   In San Juan, the Port Authority announced that it closed the
Munoz Marin International Airport to all flights at 6 p.m. It said
all international carriers had removed their planes from Puerto Rico
except for one American Airlines A300 left behind for emergencies.
   The Port Authority also said cruise ships scheduled to arrive in
San Juan had been routed to other destinations.
   A Sunday morning weather service bulletin said: ``If the eye of
Hurricane Hugo moves across Puerto Rico as forecast, we expect a
50-mile wide path of extensive to extreme damage to occur.''
   In Washington, Brian Ruberry, a spokesman for the American Red
Cross, said late Sunday that based on projections, the storm could
leave up to 250,000 people homeless on Puerto Rico.
   Civil defense officials said up to 15,000 people could be
evacuated from flood-prone areas of western Puerto Rico and hundreds
had already been moved into a sports stadium in Mayaguez, the
island's third largest city.
   National Guardsmen and volunteers drove through San Juan, the
capital, on Sunday issuing emergency instructions over loudspeakers.
   Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon flew over the island by helicopter
Sunday morning and told reporters later: ``We are as prepared as we
could be.''
   In a statement on the emergency broadcasting system, the governor
said waves 15 to 20 feet high were expected. He appealed to coastal
residents not living in sturdy homes to move to shelters in hundreds
of churches, schools and other public buildings.
   Reports indicated that the island of Guadeloupe, the most
southerly of the Leeward Islands, was the hardest hit of the string
of islands forming a 600-mile arc from the Leewards to the Greater
Antilles.
   Jocelyne Vandvurdenghe, a French government official in
Martinique, said 80 people were reported injured in Guadeloupe.
   Hugo slammed into Guadeloupe, which has a population of 337,000,
shortly after midnight, downing power lines and blacking out the
island's 30,700 telephones, state radio and television and and telex
service.
   Officials said many houses and buildings were damaged. The eye of
the storm passed over St. Francois, a major tourist area on the
eastern end of the island.
   The mayor of the village of St. Francois, Ernest Moutoussamy,
said on Radio Caraibe Internationale that ``There's nothing left of
St. Francois.''
   ``Aside from a few houses, almost all the rest were destroyed,''
he said, adding that several tourist hotels, notably the Meridien,
suffered serious damage.
   In Paris, a plane was sent Sunday with 60 rescue workers and
emergency supplies for Guadeloupe, and two more were standing by
waiting for Caribbean airports to reopen.
   Catholic Air announced in Paris it was sending clothes, water,
food, and blankets in coordination with the Red Cross.
   Louis Le Pensec, French minister of overseas terrotories, told a
news conference that his government will provide quick disaster
relief funds to those who lost property.
   The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico were last hit by a hurricane
in 1956 when Hurricane Betsy caused extensive damage.
   Hugo is the fourth hurricane and the eighth named storm of the
Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
   Forecasters said Hugo was the most powerful storm to hit the
region since Hurricane David in 1979. That storm killed an estimated
1,200 people in the Caribbean and Florida.
