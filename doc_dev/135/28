   An Atlantic tropical depression that forecasters
originally feared might strengthen into a tropical storm broke up
Tuesday.
   ``I don't think we're going to have to worry about it any
longer,'' said Robert Molleda, spokesman for the National Hurricane
Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, forecasters said the latest satellite pictures
showed the depression was no longer identifiable due the strong
upper level winds that developed over the system throughout the
preceeding 12 hours.
   No more advisories would be issued on the system unless it
regenerated, which was not expected, the center reported.
   The depression, the 13th of the Atlantic hurricane season,
formed Monday. Forecasters earlier had warned the system could
intensify to tropical storm strength by Tuesday.
   At noon EDT, the system had top sustained winds near 35 mph and
was centered near 17 degrees north latitude and 50 degrees west
longitude, about 800 miles east of the Leeward Islands.
   When a system's maximum sustained winds reach 39 mph, it becomes
a named storm, and is classified a hurricane at 74 mph. Hurricane
Hugo was the eighth named storm and the fifth hurricane of the
Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
