   The start of the Atlantic hurricane
season this week is a time of anxiety for many victims of last
year's Hurricane Hugo.
   ``A lot of people are just barely back on their feet, if they
are at all, and the thought that something like this could happen
again is just frightening to them,'' said Veronique Aniel, a
counselor with the statewide Hurricane Hugo Outreach Program.
   The hurricane season begins Friday and runs through Nov. 30.
   Hurricane Hugo smashed ashore last Sept. 21 with 135 mph wind
and a 19-foot storm surge that caused an estimated $5.9 billion
damage and killed 29 people in South Carolina. While most
structures in Charleston have been cleaned and repaired, recovery
in outlying areas has taken longer.
   Officials of the state Department of Mental Health, which
operates the outreach program, say as many as 20,000 South
Carolinians suffering post-traumatic stress syndrome are expected
to develop long-term psychological problems as a result of the
storm.
   ``We're anticipating stress because of the anniversary coming up
and because of the hurricane season starting,'' said Linda Lane, a
counselor in Berkeley County, one of the outlying areas hard-hit by
the storm.
   ``We have children who are having difficulty in school when the
rain or wind is blowing more than normal,'' she said.
   Some people will experience fear when the weather is similar to
those before the storm, said Dr. Michael Foxworth, a psychiatrist
who is medical director at Charter Hospital of Charleston.
   ``I think the emotional damage a person suffered in Hugo
probably relates ... primarily to the duration of time their lives
were totally out of their control,'' he said.
   ``The person who had time to evacuate and get to a safe place
and then pretty quickly returned to their normal environment
suffered less psychological impact than those who were totally
without resources,'' he said.
   Foxworth said people will be watching weather reports and
tracking hurricanes more closely this year.
   Before Hugo there was a sense of denial about hurricanes, a
feeling that ``it can't happen here,'' he said.
   ``Now that it has, things swing the other way and it becomes a
sense of expectancy that it will happen again ... even though the
odds are probably no greater this year than before Hugo,'' he said.
   Some people say they will leave Charleston and never return if
another storm hits, Ms. Aniel said. Others deny another storm could
even happen.
   ``Some people don't even want to talk about it. They want to
ignore the fact. If another one comes this way, what will these
people do?'' she said.
   But the fact Charleston has recently been hit by a storm would
make a future evacuation easier.
   ``You've experienced a bad hurricane and it's fresh in people's
minds,'' said Mark Zimmer of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla. ``There won't be any difficulty convincing people it's
a real threat.''
