   Forecasters consulted computers, satellites and
yellowing hurricane charts Tuesday in a frantic effort to plot the
course of Hurricane Hugo, which might hit the United States this
weekend.
   Then again, it might not.
   ``When you look out two to three days in the future, that's when
we have our most difficult problems,'' said Bob Sheets, director of
the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. ``We have a
lot of different things going on.''
   Forecasters said U.S. residents from the Florida Keys to North
Carolina should watch Hugo's uncertain path carefully. The
hurricane, leaving devastation behind in the Caribbean, was moving
past the Bahamas and could affect Florida by Friday, forecasters
said.
   They added, however, that it could also miss the United States
entirely.
   A variety of weather factors, some as far away as Canada and the
Rocky Mountains, could determine Hugo's course. But the most likely
effect will come from the combination of a low-pressure system
moving west across southern Georgia and a broad high-pressure ridge,
the ``Bermuda High,'' to Hugo's north.
   The high-pressure system probably will block Hugo from spinning
harmlessly out into the Atlantic, as Hurricane Gabrielle did last
week, forecasters said, while the low-pressure system could lure
Hugo westward.
   Forecasters said the varying factors also would affect the
storm's strength, which was slowly rebuilding Tuesday after falling
from 140 mph winds to 105 mph.
   Forecasters watched data spit out of advanced computers, studied
satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on Air Force
``hurricane hunter'' planes, and even pulled out old hurricane
charts to see what storms similar to Hugo have done.
   ``We were just looking through a bunch of the old charts,''
Sheets said. ``They've done everything. They've done loopity-loops,
they've gone into south Florida, they've gone into central Florida,
all the way up to the Carolinas.''
   An Air Force reconnaissance crew that flew into Hugo Tuesday said
the eye was about 30 to 40 miles across and the pressure had risen
to about 965 millibars _ a sign of weakening.
   ``It's weaker than in the past few days, but it's still a
significant hurricane,'' said Air Force Capt. Dave Carlisle.
   Hurricane David, a destructive hurricane that hit eastern
Caribbean islands 10 years ago, swept past Puerto Rico, hit the
island of Hispaniola, moved through the western Bahamas, then made
landfall on Florida's middle east coast.
   So far, Hugo has moved from the eastern Caribbean across Puerto
Rico, then away from Hispaniola and was headed slightly east of the
Bahamas.
   Computer models that use all available weather data, past records
and physics equations were laying out conflicting futures for Hugo,
Sheets said.
   The best advice forecasters could offer, Sheets said, was for
coastal residents across the southeastern United States to be ready.
