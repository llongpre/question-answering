   With Hurricane Hugo heading toward the U.S. mainland, cruise
lines emptied their ships of passengers and ``hauled tail'' out of
port. Florida residents jammed the phone lines of insurance
companies for financial protection.
   The eastern Caribbean's strongest storm in 10 years churned
toward the Bahamas today after scouring Puerto Rico with 125 mph
winds, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless.
   Early computer predictions indicated the storm was likely to hit
the East Coast late in the week, and officials told coastal
residents to familiarize themselves with emergency procedures.
   ``Hurricane Hugo has the potential of being the worst storm to
affect the Southeast coast since David hit the Georgia-South
Carolina coast in 1979,'' said John Purvis, director of the
Southeast Regional Climate Center in Columbia, S.C.
   Workers at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Fla.,
began preparing to roll the space shuttle Atlantis from its launch
pad into a building in case Hugo comes too close.
   In addition, NASA decided to drain the fuel from an Atlas-Centaur
rocket carrying a Navy satellite, postponing the launch from Friday
to at least Sunday.
   Preparations were being made to remove the satellite, but NASA
said today that no decision on moving it or the shuttle would be
made until Wednesday.
   Cruise lines in San Juan, Puerto Rico, quickly unloaded
passengers, changed itineraries and sent passengerless liners out to
sea after Hugo's winds began to rake the island Sunday morning.
   ``We hauled tail and got out of there,'' said Rich Steck, a
spokesman for Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which canceled this
week's trip on the Sun Viking and ended last week's tour a day
early, bringing 444 passengers into San Juan on Saturday.
   ``As soon as the people were off, we took out to sea with just
crew on board,'' Steck said in Miami. ``Ships are built to ride in
rough water. Its natural element is the sea. We'll just go as far as
we can get from it and then turn around and face it.''
   Royal Caribbean offered passengers on the canceled trip free
tickets and $200 spending money on a later cruise, Steck said.
   Carnival Cruise Lines diverted the Celebration, which which
normally carries up to 1,800 passengers on weeklong trips through
San Juan, St. Thomas and the eastern Caribbean, toward Jamaica and
Mexico.
   Carnival was watching Hugo's development closely before deciding
whether to divert the Carnivale, which left Miami on Monday with
about 1,000 passengers on a four-day trip to the Bahamas, spokesman
Tim Gallagher said.
   Days before possible hurricane watches or warnings for the Miami
area, some insurance agents already have issued a warning of their
own: It's now too late to get flood insurance protection for Hugo.
   ``If someone comes in and wants to add flood insurance, there's a
five-day waiting period,'' said James Berhardt, a State Farm agent.
   Agents for other companies said the hurricane was fast
approaching the point beyond which they would issue no more
increases in property insurance.
   Independent agent John Handeman of south Miami said once any
hurricane crosses 15 degrees north latitude and 72 degrees west
latitude, he won't sell homeowners increased coverage. Miami is at
about 80 degrees west longitude.
   Early today, Hugo's center already had passed the threshold.
   At 2 a.m. EDT, its center was near 20.7 degrees north latitude
and 67.3 degrees west longitude, moving north northwest at 12 mph.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials were
hoping Hugo would give them enough warning before bringing high
winds to the launch site at Cape Canaveral.
   According to NASA's contingency plan, officials will order a
rollback of the Atlantis if they receive a forecast that
hurricane-force winds will arrive at the cape within 72 hours.
   By Monday night, the National Weather Service estimated there was
only an 8 percent chance that hurricane force winds would hit Cape
Canaveral before Thursday evening.
   But because the shuttle can move at only 1 mph, the journey back
to the assembly building takes six hours, leaving little room for
error.
   NASA said that if caught by high winds it could secure the
shuttle and its cargo, the nuclear-powered Galileo space probe, on
the launch pad to ride out any storm.
   A return to the hangar would certainly mean a delay in the
scheduled Oct. 12 launch of Atlantis, but NASA has until late
November to send the probe on its six-year voyage to the planet
Jupiter.
