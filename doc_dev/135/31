   A tropical storm in the Gulf of Mexico showed signs
of growing into a hurricane Friday, threatening to swamp coastal
areas already facing abnormally high tides and prompting the
evacuation of offshore oil rigs.
   Tropical Storm Jerry, which developed rapidly from a tropical
depression off the Mexican coast on Friday, had maximum sustained
winds of 70 mph and appeared to be gaining intensity, according to
the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   The center issued a hurricane watch from Port Arthur, Texas, to
the mouth of the Mississippi River. A hurricane warning for
portions of the watch area was likely to be issued Saturday.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Friday, the center of Jerry was located at
24.5 north latitude and 93.6 west longitude, or about 425 miles
south-southwest of New Orleans, and moving north at 13 mph.
   Oil companies began evacuating offshore rigs and platforms early
in the day, officials said in New Orleans. More than 4,000 workers
in the gulf were to be be brought ashore by helicopter and ship.
   ``We started as soon as it became a tropical storm,'' said Wendy
Jacobs of Shell Oil. ``Everyone knows you don't take any chances
with these.''
   The hurricane center advised Gulf Coast residents and marine
operations to closely monitor advisories on the storm.
   ``At the moment, Louisiana appears to be in the greatest danger,
but the storm could turn over the weekend,'' said forecaster
Gilbert Clark. A coastal flood watch was issued for the Texas coast.
   Rough seas from Jerry also may coincide with an unusual
astronomical phenomenon that is expected to elevate average tides
to a 10-year high, said Clark.
   The moon, which raises tides with its gravitational pull, will
be both full and at its closest point to the earth next week. In
addition, the moon's orbit is over the Northern Hemisphere, which
adds to its affect on the seas.
   Clark said tides could be up to a foot higher in the Gulf and
more in the open ocean.
   ``A situation likes this happens about once every decade,'' he
said. ``But it also has the reverse affect. Low tides will be at
their lowest.''
   Jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since Hurricane
Hugo ravaged the Caribbean and coastal South Carolina last month.
   Tropical depressions become named tropical storms when maximum
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Hurricanes are declared when winds
hit 74 mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June to
November.
