<HEAD>Hurricane Hugo Hits Puerto Rico</HEAD>

   Hurricane Hugo brushed across Puerto Rico on Monday, bringing
sustained winds near 125 mph and heavy rain, causing extensive
damage and interfering with communications.
   Hugo, the most powerful storm to strike the region in a decade,
was blamed for at least 14 deaths.
   Meteorologist Jesse Moore at the National Hurricane Center said
it was too early to tell if Hugo would strike the U.S. mainland. He
said it was expected to be off the southeastern Bahamas by Wednesday
and ``after that, it's anybody's guess.''
   Behind Hugo, Tropical Storm Iris was about 300 miles from the
Lesser Antilles with a maximum sustained wind speed of around 50
mph. Strengthening was not expected because of the proximity of Hugo.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms were widespread across much
of the Florida Peninsula, south of a frontal system in very warm
humid air. Hail the size of golf balls pelted Amelia Island during
the morning, the National Weather Service said. A tornado was
reported at Fernandina Beach near Amelia Island, the weather service
said.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the central Pacific
Coast and into the northern Rockies as low pressure in the upper
atmosphere developed over Northern California. Street flooding was
reported in parts of Sacramento, Calif., the weather service said.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 38
degrees at Truckee, Calif., to 94 at Brownsville, Texas. Monday's
low in the Lower 48 states was 30 at both Burns and Redmond, Ore.
   For Tuesday, widespread showers and isolated thunderstorms were
forecast from central and Southern California into Wyoming and
central South Dakota. Scattered showers and thunderstorms were
forecast from Florida across the southern and middle Atlantic Coast.
   Highs only in the 60s were predicted across the Pacific
Northwest, the Great Basin of Nevada and western Utah, and the
northern parts of New England; in the low to mid 90s across much of
Texas; and in the 70s or 80s across much of the rest of the nation.
