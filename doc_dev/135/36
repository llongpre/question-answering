   Hurricane Hugo ripped across resort
islands of the eastern Caribbean on Sunday with winds up to 140 mph,
ripping away rooftops, uprooting trees and leaving an estimated
3,000 people homeless on the island of Guadeloupe.
   Forecasters described Hugo as ``extremely dangerous'' as it
churned toward Puerto Rico and said it could be the most powerful
hurricane to hit the region since Hurricane David in 1979. That
storm killed an estimated 1,200 people in the Caribbean and Florida.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Hugo's center was located near latitude 16.6 north
and longitude 62.7 west, about 250 miles east-southeast of San Juan,
said the National Weather Service in Miami.
   Hugo was moving west-northwest at 12 mph and was expected to hit
the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Sunday night or early Monday,
the weather service said. Hurricane warnings were in effect for
islands throughout the region.
   ``All preparedness actions should be rushed to completion in the
warned areas,'' the weather service said in its 9 a.m. weather
bulletin.
   The storm slammed into the French island of Guadeloupe, about 350
miles east-southeast of Puerto Rico, just after midnight Sunday.
   Phone circuits to affected islands were either busy or jammed
early Sunday and it could not be immediately determined if the storm
caused any casualties on the island of 340,000 people.
   Jean-Claude Roure, a government official on Martinique, told
French radio there were no reports of deaths of serious injuries on
Guadeloupe but that it appeared about 3,000 people were left
homeless. Martinique is about 100 miles south of Guadeloupe.
   Roure reported heavy damage to buildings and said the airport
control tower in the city of Pointe-a-Pitre was ``partially
destroyed.''
   ``Since people can't move around and almost all communications
are cut, it is possible there's more information that has not been
passed along,'' he said.
   He said it appeared that La Desirade, an island of about 1,600
people 22 miles east of Guadeloupe, may have been the hardest hit so
far but that all communications with it were cut.
   The director of civil security at the French Interior Ministry in
Paris, Hubert Fournier, said emergency supplies and personnel were
being prepared to be sent to Guadeloupe as soon as it was known what
was needed.
   Rainfall of up to 10 inches was expected in the path of the
hurricane, producing flash floods and possible mud slides in hilly
regions, the National Weather Service said. It warned residents in
mountainous areas to move to safer locations.
   Storm surges up to eight feet above normal were expected in
coastal areas, forecasters said.
   In Dominica to the south of Guadeloupe, there were power outages
on the island's north side where strong winds uprooted trees,
France's RFO radio said.
   In Antigua, just north of Guadeloupe, heavy rain and very strong
winds also uprooting trees were reported. Authorities there turned
off power to the entire island of 100,000 people as a precautionary
measure shortly before midnight.
   The radio reported flooding in low-lying areas but provided no
details. It said dozens of people were moved to shelters. At the
plush St. James Club hotel, on the island's southeastern side,
guests were evacuated.
   In the British dependency of Montserrat, northwest of Guadeloupe
and directly in Hugo's path, Joe Dominique, editor at Radio
Antilles, said the storm blew down trees and ripped away galvanized
rooftops of several homes in the capital, Plymouth, early Sunday.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
