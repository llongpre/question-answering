   Hundreds of workers fled oil rigs in the Gulf
of Mexico as Tropical Storm Jerry inched toward the coasts of Texas
and Louisiana.
   A hurricane watch was issued this morning for the coast from
Port Arthur, Texas, to the mouth of the Mississippi River, with
landfall somewhere along that area forecast for Sunday at the
earliest.
   The storm weakened slightly this morning and also was found to
be farther away from land than first thought and moving more
slowly, said forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   Jerry developed rapidly from a tropical depression off the
Mexican coast and by early today had maximum sustained winds of 70
mph. By late morning, though, the winds had eased to 65 mph.
   Forecasters said conditions were not favorable for a major
increase in storm strength, but noted that even a relatively slight
increase could bring the storm up to hurricane strength, defined as
74 mph or more.
   Evacuations from the oil rigs began early Friday, soon after
Jerry reached tropical storm strength in the southwestern gulf,
stirring up rough seas. Officials said more than 4,000 workers
would be brought to shore if the rigs were all shut down.
   ``We started as soon as it became a tropical storm,'' Shell Oil
spokeswoman Wendy Jacobs said. ``Everyone knows you don't take any
chances with these.''
   At noon EDT today, Jerry's center was near 24.9 north latitude
and 93.1 west longitude, about 400 miles south southwest of New
Orleans. The storm was moving north at 6 mph, more slowly than
forecasters thought earlier in the day.
   The system's rough seas could coincide with unusually high tides
expected all week because of an unusual alignment of the Earth, Sun
and Moon.
   Tides through Friday were expected to peak at their highest
levels in a decade, Clark said, perhaps a foot above their usual
highs in the gulf.
   Jerry is the strongest tropical weather system since Hurricane
Hugo ravaged the Caribbean and coastal South Carolina last month.
The storm, which killed 33 in the Caribbean and 29 on the mainland
United States, hit Charleston, S.C., late Sept. 21.
   Storm preparations were under way along the gulf coast.
   On Grand Island, La., in the gulf south of New Orleans,
officials readied evacuation plans for 2,000 residents.
   ``We just have to play it hour-by-hour and see what happens, but
when there's a storm in the Gulf it kind of raises everybody's
hackles a bit,'' said Pete Picou, civil defense director of Cameron
Parish on the southwestern Louisiana coast. ``Down here you can't
ever take them for granted.''
