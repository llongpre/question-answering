   Giant Hurricane Gabrielle, its tail winds swamping
homes and businesses as far south as Barbados, may have reached peak
force as its swirling clouds spread further over the Atlantic,
forecasters said late Tuesday.
   Experts, however, said it was too early to draw conclusions from
U.S. Air Force reconnaissance plane readings of rising barometric
pressure and a slightly expanding eye in the hurricane, which
brushed by the U.S. Caribbean islands before turning its 135 mph
winds northward.
   Hurricane forecasters said Gabrielle appeared to be heading
toward the British island of Bermuda in the Atlantic, but was still
at least three days away and on an uncertain course that seemed to
be moving from a northwesterly course to northward.
   ``The biggest threat now is for Bermuda ... Anybody on the East
Coast should watch this storm,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Gabrielle, already this season's biggest hurricane, was upgraded
Tuesday evening to a Category 4 hurricane, with 5 the strongest.
   Forecasters said it rivaled last year's record-setting Hurricane
Gilbert at the same stage, but was on a path more like 1985's
powerful Hurricane Gloria, which did $900 million in damage as it
raced up the East Coast and into New England.
   Sheets said Gabrielle was unlikely to come near South Florida.
   Gabrielle, with storm winds in a 500-mile-long band, caused storm
swells as far as 1,000 miles from its center, forecasters said.
   Sheets compared Gabrielle to Gilbert of 1988, saying Gabrielle's
size was similar to Gilbert, which became ``the storm of the
century'' and devastated the island of Jamaica. Both were the
seventh named storms of their Atlantic season, as was Gloria.
   While Gilbert stayed on a westerly course across the upper
Caribbean and made landfall in Mexico, Gabrielle was moving out of
the Caribbean and headed up into the Atlantic.
   As of 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle was centered near 22.6 north
latitude and 58.5 west longitude, about 775 miles south-southeast of
Bermuda. It was moving northwest at 12 mph.
   The governments of the Leeward Islands countries urged small
craft to stay in port and issued heavy surf warnings as Gabrielle
pushed 74 mph (hurricane-force) winds as far as 100 miles away from
its center.
   Henry Laskosky, a National Weather Service forecaster in San
Juan, predicted rough seas for the island.
   ``It should not bother us at all, except for seas, they'll be a
little rough tonight and Wednesday,'' Laskosky said.
   In Barbados, the easternmost Caribbean island 550 miles southeast
of Puerto Rico, Gabrielle's tail caused 10-foot waves and rough seas
on the island's east coast Monday. Some beachfront homes and
businesses in the capital of Bridgetown were flooded Tuesday.
   No injuries or serious damages were reported.
   The weather in Barbados and Leeward islands on Tuesday was sunny
and clear.
   Forecaster John Toohey said the hurricane would have no effect on
the Virgin Islands.
   Gloria, the last major hurricane on the U.S. East Coast in Sept.
16-Oct. 1, 1985, started on a track similar to Gabrielle. The
hurricane, which moved up the Atlantic at an unusually fast 30 to 50
mph, panicked thousands of coastal residents but turned out not to
be the massive killer hurricane predicted. It was a Category 3 storm
when it hit the coast, but had earlier had winds of 150 mph.
   ``People were very fortunate with Gloria,'' Hurricane Center
spokesman Martin Nelson said. ``The tides were in our favor and it
stayed offshore. We can take all the chastising about crying wolf,
but we're not going to downplay this one because of Gloria.''
   Meanwhile, far to the north, Hurricane Felix was back to 85 mph
winds after falling to 39 mph over the weekend.
   Little additional strengthening was expected for Felix, which was
no threat to land. At 10:30 p.m. EDT, its center was located near
36.5 north latitude and 48.5 west longitude, or about 950 miles west
of the westernmost Azores, and it was barely moving.
