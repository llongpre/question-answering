   Hugo's trek across the Atlantic toward the Caribbean
slowed today, the storm's 75 mph winds just barely qualifying it as
a hurricane.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Hugo's center was located near 13.0 north latitude
and 48.0 west longitude, or about 900 miles east of the Lesser
Antilles. The storm was moving west at 17 mph, down from 20 mph
Wednesday night.
   Its highest sustained winds were just over the 74 mph hurricane
threshold, but the storm was expected to strengthen, forecasters
said. Hugo was expected to hold its course today.
   ``The threat to the islands is kind of delayed some,'' said
forecaster Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables. ``A lot of our model forecasts indicate it's going to
slow down even more in the next couple of days.''
   Hugo, the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
developed into a hurricane Wednesday evening. Storms are given names
when their sustained winds reach 39 mph, the tropical storm
threshold.
   ``The longer it heads west, the more concern it is to us,'' said
Hal Gerrish, a forecaster at the hurricane center. ``But we're not
sure yet where it will go _ there are too many things that can
happen.''
   The three Atlantic hurricanes before Hugo _ Dean, Erin and
Gabrielle _ turned north into the open Atlantic before reaching the
Caribbean. But last year's killer Hurricane Gilbert remained on the
westward course, socking Mexico and the Caribbean.
   They became storms when sustained winds reached 39 mph, and reach
hurricanes status when winds hit 74 mph.
