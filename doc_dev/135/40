   Gabrielle, dwindled from a hurricane to a tropical
storm, lost more its punch Monday while forecasters began watching a
new tropical depression shaping up in the area where Gabrielle got
its start.
   Gabrielle, lingering south of Nova Scotia, lost its hurricane
status late Sunday when its maximum sustained wind speed dropped
below the 74 mph minimum. By Monday evening, it had slowed to 45 mph.
   The depression, the 11th since the 1989 Atlantic Hurricane season
began June 1, formed from a tropical wave off West Africa. It had a
maximum sustained wind speed of 45 mph and was expected to reach
tropical-storm strength of 39 mph by noon Tuesday. It would be named
Hugo.
   ``This is the peak of the tropical storm season and these
tropical waves are moving off the coast of Africa every three or
four days like clockwork,'' said forecaster Max Mayfield of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Neither it nor Gabrielle posed any immediate threat to land,
although Gabrielle's wind still created unusually high surf
conditions along the southern coast of Nova Scotia and the U.S. East
Coast north of Boston.
   During the weekend, swells, undertow and waves up to 15 feet high
lashed the coast from Maine to New York, and three people apparently
drowned and at least six others were missing.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of Gabrielle was near latitude 41.0
north, longitude 60.0 west, or about 195 miles south southwest of
Sable Island, Nova Scotia. It was drifting north-northeast at about
12 mph and was expected to continue that course through the day.
   Also at 10:30 p.m., Hugo's center was near latitude 12.5 north
and longitude 31.5 west, or about 485 miles west southwest of the
southernmost Cape Verde islands, where many strong, peak-season
storms like Gabrielle are born. It was moving west at about 20 mph.
   Gabrielle was the seventh named storm of the Atlantic hurricane
season and the fourth hurricane.
