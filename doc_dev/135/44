   Residents from Florida to North Carolina stocked up
on groceries, flashlights and window-reinforcing tape for Hurricane
Hugo's expected assault and the Navy sent ships to sea today to ride
out the killer storm.
   Looting broke out on St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands in the
wake of the storm blamed for at least 25 deaths in the Caribbean.
President Bush declared the islands a disaster area, and the
government made available $500,000 for food and emergency supplies
there.
   Forecasters said the chances of the hurricane hitting the East
Coast late this week were steadily increasing, and most projected
paths had the storm hitting between Cape Canaveral and Cape
Hatteras, N.C., by early Saturday.
   The storm today brushed northeast of the Bahamas with winds of
105 mph and was expected to bring mostly high wind and rain. Workers
boarded up government buildings, and Prime Minister Lynden Pindling
cut short a visit to Jamaica.
   ``Although the indications are that it's going to move east of
the more populated areas, no one is relaxing their vigil because it
can change direction,'' said Bill Kalis, a spokesman for the
Bahamian government.
   At noon EDT, Hugo's center was 360 miles east of Nassau in the
Bahamas. Its coordinates were 25.8 north latitude and 71.5 west
longitude and it was moving northwest at 12 mph, a course it was
expected to maintain through today.
   The Navy today began to send ships to sea from a base at
Charleston, S.C., to avoid storm damage.
   Looters ransacked stores and law enforcement collapsed on St.
Croix, where tourists pleaded with reporters for help in getting out.
   ``When we landed, we were pounced upon by about 15 tourists,''
said Gary Williams, a reporter for a San Juan newspaper. ``They
said, `Please get food! Please get water! Please help us! They're
looting. We've seen police looting. We've seen National Guard
looting. There's no law and order here.'''
   Hugo so far has left millions of dollars in damage, more than
50,000 Caribbean residents homeless and hundreds of injuries. It
ripped away roofs, flattened houses, flipped planes, damaged cash
crops and knocked out power and communications.
   The death toll was incomplete, and officials feared it would grow
as rescuers searched collapsed buildings.
   On Monday, the hurricane's 125 mph winds smashed directly into
Puerto Rico, where officials said 10,000 people were homeless and
25,000 were in shelters.
   Two Coast Guard planes carrying fresh water, food and lumber
arrived in Puerto Rico late Tuesday, and several other relief
flights were planned today. President Bush was expected to declare
the island a disaster area.
   The hardest-hit islands were still cut off from normal
communication early today. On the tiny British island of Montserrat,
officials said nearly every building was destroyed, including the
only hospital on the island of 12,000.
   ``It's as if a bomb has been dropped in the buildings and
everything has been blown out. All trees are like stubble. There's
not a flower left standing,'' said Cmdr. Colin Ferbrache of the
Royal Navy vessel H.M.S. Alacrity, which was stationed off
Montserrat.
   National Hurricane Center specialist Bob Case said the East Coast
would feel the storm's fringe effects of rain and some gusty winds
at least through Thursday night, if Hugo stayed on its track
parallel to the Bahamas.
   In Georgia, residents stocked up on batteries, food, plywood and
generators. Insurance companies told agents to hold up writing some
types of policies until the storm passed. Boaters were advised to
move inland.
   Sheriff Van Findley in Effingham County, Ga., said he was
rounding up generators for emergency medical headquarters and
shelters and arranging for chainsaws for use in cutting trees that
may block evacuation routes.
   ``I see a lot of people buying water and canned goods like pork
and beans,'' Bryan Raleigh, manager of a grocery in the Wilmington,
N.C., area. ``It's been pretty steady all morning.''
   Off Charleston, S.C., a ship salvaging $400 million in gold from
a sunken 19th-century steamship sought safe harbor. In Myrtle Beach,
S.C., officials began moving bulldozers to where they would be
readily accessible if the storm hit.
   A Mount Pleasant, S.C., hardware store manager said residents
grabbed batteries, masking tape, flashlights and lamp oil. ``I think
people are taking it seriously,'' said Louis Middleton. ``There are
some old-timers who have memories of Hazel and Gracie,'' hurricanes
that hit South Carolina in the 1950s.
   Others took a wait-and-see attitude.
   ``We have quite a few tourists still, but everybody seems pretty
calm,'' said Mabel Gaskins of coastal Ocracoke, N.C. ``Most of them
are waiting for Thursday or Friday to see what it does.''
   Workers at Kennedy Space Center were ready to move space shuttle
Atlantis, scheduled for launch Oct. 12, from the launch pad to a
hangar if necessary. They also were prepared to remove a Navy
communications satellite from an Atlas-Centaur rocket on another
pad. Decisions on both missions might not come until Thursday, NASA
said.
   Meanwhile, forecasters said Tropical Storm Iris is weakening
because of its closeness to Hugo. At noon, Iris was near latitude
21.5 north and longitude 62.8 west, or 230 miles north of the
Leeward Islands and moving northwest at about 12 mph.
