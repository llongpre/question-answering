   Hurricane Jerry blustered ashore with 80
mph winds, flinging a half-dozen twisters inland, blacking out
thousands of homes and killing two people before quickly losing
much of its punch today.
   A voluntary evacuation order for thousands of people in the
low-lying southwestern corner of Louisiana was lifted today as the
remnants of the late-season storm moved away to the north through
eastern Texas.
   By 5 a.m. the storm was downgraded to a tropical depression with
winds at 35 mph. It was centered was 35 miles east-southeast of
Lufkin, near 31.2 degrees north latitude and 94.2 degrees west
longitude. It was moving northeast at 17 mph and was expected to
continue in that direction and weaken further.
   As the hurricane blew into Galveston from the Gulf of Mexico, it
uprooted trees, smashed windows and tore several balconies from an
apartment building. ``Whole balconies came down. It just ripped
them up from the bolts,'' said resident John Harsh.
   But damage overall was limited, with City Manager Doug Matthews
saying today that it is estimated to be less than $10 million. He
said also that there was no looting.
   The bodies of a 24-year-old man, who worked for the U.S. Coast
Guard, and his 2-year-old daughter were found on rock jetties on
Galveston Island's protective seawall, Galveston police said. It
appeared that they had been in a car that was swept off the
seawall, officers said.
   The seawall was erected after Galveston was devastated in a 1900
hurricane in which 6,000 or more people died. It was the deadliest
hurricane on record in the United States.
   A tornado spun off by Jerry damaged several buildings in the
town of Orange near the Louisiana line, and another twister ripped
the door off a Galveston fire truck and damaged the fire station
and a shed at the airport.
   Tornadoes or funnel clouds were sighted around Galveston Bay in
Hitchcock, Baytown, Beach City, Webster and a nearby spot northeast
of Texas Highway 6. Tornado damage generally was confined to roofs
and power lines.
   Two tornadoes were spotted early today in inland Polk County,
damaging some houses and barns, said sheriff's spokeswoman Genace
Chapman.
   At least 52,000 homes and businesses lost power, most of them in
Galveston Island, said Houston Lighting &amp; Power spokeswoman Graham
Painter. But by 5 a.m. today, 80 percent of the power was restored.
Phone service to much of the island also was disrupted.
   The center of the hurricane made landfall Sunday evening, with
sustained winds of 80 mph and 100 mph gusts, according to the
National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. Within 3{ hours,
Jerry was downgraded to a tropical storm after its maximum
sustained winds fell below 74 mph.
   On Galveston, which bore the brunt of the storm, an early
assessment found minor street flooding but little serious damage,
said Gary Vasquez of the emergency operations center. The biggest
task appeared to be cleaning up debris scattered by the wind, he
said.
   ``I think we did very well,'' said Mayor Jan Coggeshall.
   Schools were open as usual today, except for one elementary
school closed because of a power outage.
   Jerry was considered a category 1 hurricane, the least severe
possible. Hurricane Hugo, which devastated parts of the Caribbean
and South Carolina last month, was a category 4 with winds of 135
mph. Jerry was much smaller, too, with hurricane-force winds
extending just 15 to 25 miles out from the eye, as compared with
100 miles for Hugo.
   But Jerry was still enough to cause fear in low-lying areas,
particularly because it coincided with an unusually high tide
caused by a rare alignment of the Earth, moon and sun. The
combination of astronomical forces and the storm sent tides 5 to 8
feet above normal.
   In Louisiana's Cameron Parish, officials Sunday urged voluntary
evacuation of 8,000 to 10,000 residents. ``We're just concerned
about getting people to higher ground,'' said Scott Henry, a Civil
Defense volunteer.
   The evacuation advisory was lifted this morning.
   Earlier, hundreds of workers had been evacuated from offshore
oil rigs as Jerry zigzagged through the gulf during the weekend.
   Most of Galveston's 62,000 residents decided to stay in their
homes instead of evacuating for Jerry.
   By 11 p.m., those who had moved to shelters were told they could
return home, said Gary Stone, spokesman for Galveston's Emergency
Operations Center.
   Jerry was the seventh hurricane of the six-month Atlantic
season, which ends in November. Hugo was easily the most
destructive, killing 33 people in the Caribbean and 29 on the U.S.
mainland and causing billions of dollars in damage.
