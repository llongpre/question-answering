   Tropical storm Arthur, with heavy rains and wind up
to 70 mph, strengthened Wednesday and forecasters warned that it
could turn into a hurricane threatening parts of Puerto Rico and
the Dominican Republic.
   The Dominican Republic issued a tropical storm watch for the
south coast of the island after Arthur pushed across the Windward
Islands and into the Caribbean Sea. A similar watch was in effect
for the south coast of Puerto Rico.
   Forecasters said a hurricane watch could be issued for parts of
those areas late Wednesday.
   Arthur was expected to ``remain very near to hurricane
intensity'' through early Thursday without reaching sustained winds
of 74 mph that would classify it as a hurricane, said Mark Zimmer,
hurricane specialist at the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables.
   ``We think that there is more than a 50-50 percent chance that
it won't become a hurricane,'' he said. ``But there is certainly
the chance that in the next 12 to 18 hours it could go ahead and
reach hurricane intensity.''
   At 10 p.m. EDT, Arthur was centered near latitude 14.2 north and
longitude 65.5 west, or about 420 miles southeast of Santo Domingo,
Dominican Republic. It was moving northwest at about 15 mph and was
expected to continue that motion through the next day or two, said
Bob Sheets, director of the hurricane center.
   Arthur, the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season's first named storm,
grew from a tropical depression, the second of the 1990 season,
that formed Sunday in the open Atlantic. The hurricane season runs
from June 1 to Nov. 30.
