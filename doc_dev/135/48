   Hurricane Hugo's leading edge brought
rain to the lower East Coast today, and thousands fled inland. The
first of 1,000 soldiers sent by President Bush arrived in the Virgin
Islands to quell looting in the storm's wake.
   With landfall expected as early as tonight between Florida and
North Carolina and the killer storm's winds rising to 110 mph,
schools were closed, homes were boarded up, residents stocked up on
emergency supplies and shelters opened.
   Forecasters warned that waves could tower as much as 16 feet
above normal because the hurricane could cross the coast at high
tide, about 2:30 a.m. Rain of 5 to 10 inches was forecast.
   The military brought aircraft inland and sent ships out to sea to
ride out the storm, which has killed at least 25 people in the
Caribbean with direct blows to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.
   South Carolina's governor declared an emergency and called out
the National Guard to help thousands move inland. As many as 490,000
people were being evacuated from the coast in Georgia, where an
emergency also was declared.
   ``We get a lot of storms over here. I don't get real upset over
them because I've sat through too many of them,'' said Nancy
Treadaway, who was packing this morning to leave Charleston.
   Robin Bevill, taping the windows of her Wrightsville Beach, N.C.,
gas station, said residents of the island town were nervous.
   ``Diana, back in 1984, was nothing really to worry about,'' said
Ms. Bevill. ``This one's expected to be bigger. ... It's still
exciting, as long as you're safe.''
   U.S. military police were sent to the Virgin Islands to reinforce
U.S. marshals, FBI agents and armed Coast Guardsmen who were
dispatched after police reportedly joined prison escapees and
machete-armed mobs in looting on St. Croix.
   The first contingent, about 75 soldiers led by a brigadier
general, arrived this morning, secured the airport and set up a
command center. It appeared to be the first time in more than 20
years that a president ordered active duty military personnel into
the nation's streets.
   ``Everyone in the federal pen there is loose,'' said Eileen Long,
a New York City advertising executive who was among 145 St. Croix
tourists who arrived in Miami late Wednesday on a
government-arranged evacuation flight.
   ``There are murderers and snipers running around everywhere,''
she said.
   Bush also declared the Virgin Islands a disaster area and freed
up $500,000 for relief.
   Hugo sideswiped the Bahamas and accelerated as it moved over open
water Wednesday. ``An increase in forward speed increases the
likelihood that it will strike the coast and not recurve, heading
out to sea,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center in Florida.
   Early today, rain from Hugo fell from North Carolina to
Melbourne, Fla. Rain was heavy around Augusta, Ga. A hurricane
warning was issued from Fernandina Beach, Fla., to Cape Lookout, N.C.
   Forecasters said there was a 1 in 4 chance that it would come
ashore between Savannah, Ga., and Charleston.
   Charleston officials braced for widespread flooding, noting that
some streets flood at high tide during a full moon even without a
storm. Hospitals stockpiled supplies, discharged patients well
enough to go home and moved others inland. Utility companies said
they would cut off power to Hilton Head Island.
   At Cape Canaveral, Fla., NASA decided it was safe to keep shuttle
Atlantis on the launch pad for an October launch.
   At noon EDT, Hugo's center was 305 miles southeast of Savannah,
or 29.5 degrees north latitude and 77 degrees west longitude. It was
moving northwest at 17 mph, up from 12 mph Wednesday.
   Bill Clack, executive director of the Georgia Emergency
Management Agency, said he expected 490,000 people would be
evacuated from the state's barrier islands and other low-lying areas.
   From Florida to the Carolinas, people stocked up on supplies to
board up windows and carry them through several days without
electricity and water.
   ``They're buying me out of all my candles, tape, flashlights,
propane fuel, oil and lamps,'' said Tim Brindley, manager of a K
mart in Mount Pleasant, S.C.
   The governor requested shelters opened in eight coastal counties.
His emergency declaration put the National Guard and state law
enforcement agencies on alert and ordered vans to be made available
to evacuate the elderly.
   In Charleston, the 188-year-old City Hall was boarded up, schools
and colleges canceled class and the mayor said the storm could be
the city's biggest catastrophe since a 1938 tornado that killed 32
people and injured hundreds.
   ``It's very important no one underestimate the danger of this
hurricane,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said.
   The Navy sent its ships from Charleston to ride out the storm.
Hunter Army Air Field in Savannah flew more than 60 helicopters
inland. Bases in Myrtle Beach and Charleston also planned to fly
aircraft away from the storm.
   Tropical Storm Iris was close behind. At 6 a.m. EDT, it was near
22.7 north latitude and 66.2 west longitude, or 330 miles east of
Grand Turk Island. Winds were 45 mph as the storm moved
west-northwest at about 13 mph.
   The last major storm to blow ashore in South Carolina was Gracie
in 1959, which struck near Beaufort with winds of more than 100 mph,
leaving 22 dead and $14 million in damage.
