   Tropical Storm Iris and its 60 mph winds swirled in
the Atlantic as Hurricane Hugo devasted the eastern Caribbean.
   Iris' further strengthening was unlikely through this evening,
according to hurricane specialist Gil Clark of the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   Even so, the governments of Barbados, St. Vincent and St. Lucia
issued warnings for Iris, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic
hurricane season, which ends in November. Forecasters warned
residents of the Leeward Islands, raked by Hugo, to keep an eye on
Iris.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, Iris' center was near 18.7 north latitude
and 57.9 west longitude, or about 265 miles east of the Leeward
Islands. It was moving north-northwest at about 17 mph.
   The storm was expected to hold that course at a slightly slower
pace today.
   Tropical depressions become named storms when their top sustained
winds reach 39 mph. Iris became a storm Sunday.
