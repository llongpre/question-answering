   Hurricane Gabrielle on Monday pushed a huge,
400-mile-wide band of storm-strength wind across the Atlantic toward
the Caribbean.
   However, it will be four to five days before forecasters can say
if it will strike the U.S. mainland, said Bob Sheets, director of
the National Hurricane Center. It was on a path that could take it
northwest of the Virgin Islands.
   ``The storm is actually a long way away from any potential
impact,'' Sheets said.
   The Atlantic season's fourth hurricane had maximum sustained wind
of 130 mph, and meteorologists at the hurricane center in suburban
Coral Gables said Gabrielle would probably strengthen as it moved
over warm tropical water.
   ``Everything is favorable as far as the hurricane itself is
concerned to strengthen slightly,'' said Sheets. ``It's a very large
hurricane.''
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle's center was near 19.3 north
latitude and 56.3 west longitude, about 375 miles east of the
northeastern Leeward Islands. It was moving west-northwest at 15 mph
and was expected to continue that course over the next 24 hours.
   Gabrielle had hurricane-force wind of at least 74 mph extending
as far as 100 miles north of its center, according to reports from
an Air Force reconnaissance plane that flew through the storm
Monday, Sheets said.
   Forecasters said wind of tropical-storm force, at least 39 mph,
extended up to 250 miles northeast of the center and 150 miles to
the southwest.
   ``This is definitely a hurricane that needs to be respected,''
forecaster Bob Case said.
   Gabrielle formed Thursday off Africa and its sustained wind
quickly surpassed minimum hurricane force of 74 mph.
   Tropical Storm Felix strengthened as it drifted westerly far to
the north and was expected to gradually turn toward the northwest.
   At 10:30 p.m., the center of Felix was near 36.3 north latitude
and 48.7 west longitude, or about 970 miles southwest of the
westernmost Azores.
   Its winds were estimated at about 65 mph, 25 mph stronger than
Sunday. Forecasters said a ridge to Felix's north had strengthened,
causing Felix's winds to build back.
