   Downed power lines after a hurricane are more
likely to kill nowadays than the storm's fierce winds and mighty
sea surges, according to a federal study of Hugo's swipe across
Puerto Rico last month.
   Of nine deaths associated with Hurricane Hugo's pass over Puerto
Rico on Sept. 18, just two came by drowning in the storm's rains
and floods, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   Seven people died in accidental electrocutions, however, most
during cleanup efforts.
   Five electric company workmen died in separate accidents
repairing downed power lines. A sixth man was electrocuted taking
down a TV antenna before the storm, and another man was
electrocuted when he hit a downed electric line while chopping
trees after the storm hit.
   ``In the past,'' the CDC said in its weekly report,
``hurricane-related mortality has occurred primarily as a result of
drownings ... associated with storm surges'' _ the huge wave of
water hurricanes bring at landfall.
   ``It looks like the pattern may be changing,'' said Dr. Rossanne
Philen, a researcher with the Atlanta-based CDC. ``Because of the
increased forecasting ability we have, we're able to evacuate more
people ahead of time.''
   In Puerto Rico, more than 18,000 people were evacuated from
flood-prone areas the night before the storm.
   ``But we found, unfortunately, in Puerto Rico that the cleanup
efforts led to quite a few deaths,'' she said. ``People need to be
aware of the possible dangers. Just because the hurricane is gone,
it doesn't mean you are no longer at risk of injury or death.''
   ``Public health officials ... must realize that the ... risks
associated with hurricanes extend beyond the impact phase,'' the
CDC said. ``Efforts to minimize injury and other health risks for
both disaster-relief workers and the general population are
crucial.''
   At least 71 deaths ultimately were attributed to Hugo as it
moved across Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the Carolinas and
rained itself out over the northeastern United States. At least a
dozen deaths ultimately were logged in Puerto Rico.
   The CDC said the same pattern occurred four years earlier when
Tropical Storm Isabelle hammered the island, killing 95 _ only 21
of whom drowned.
   Researchers from the CDC are studying the effects of Hugo in the
Virgin Islands and along the South Carolina coast. They plan
further analysis on the storm and the injuries and deaths that
resulted.
