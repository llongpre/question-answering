   Tropical Storm Klaus gained
strength off Antigua today and was upgraded to a hurricane after
leaving six people dead and two missing in flooding on the
Caribbean island of Martinique.
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Klaus had sustained
winds of 80 mph this morning, up from 60 mph earlier. It remained
stalled 30 miles off Antigua but was expected to start moving again
later.
   It was uncertain whether Klaus, the sixth named hurricane of the
season, would reach the United States.
   ``We expect it in the next two or three days to move toward the
northwest and to be north of Puerto Rico and east of the Bahamas.
Beyond that, it's too early to say,'' said Bob Sheets, director of
the Miami Hurricane Center.
   Antigua's international airport was closed, said Stan
Cieniewicz, administrative officer for the island-based
Pan-Caribbean Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Project.
   He said Klaus was expected to cut between Antigua, a popular
tourist spot, and its tiny sister island, Barbuda.
   Both islands are mainly flat, but Barbuda's 1,500 population is
located almost entirely in the capital, Codrington, protected by a
reef and lagoon.
   Early today, Antigua was being swept by high winds and
intermittent rain, but there were no reports of damage.
   Antigua's government radio station, ABS, said schools were
closed and residents were stocking up on supplies. It advised
residents to stay indoors. Later, both ABS and another staion were
knocked off the air by the winds.
   Authorities on Thursday evacuated hundreds of residents from the
French island of Martinique, where the storm left floodwaters
nearly 10 feet deep in some places. The dead and missing were
reported on that island.
   Hurricane warnings were issued for the Leeward Islands along an
arc from the French and Dutch island of St. Martin in the north to
the British colony of Montserrat in the south. Tropical storm
warnings remained in effect for Martinique and its sister island of
Guadeloupe.
   ``It stalled again, just hasn't moved. I think later today it'll
resume the northwestward drift,'' said hurricane specialist Max
Mayfield at the Miami center. ``I think the problem will come in
two to three days, when it gets to the northern Caribbean.''
   The Hurricane Center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was
possible for the islands of the northeastern Caribbean. That amount
could trigger mudslides and more flash flooding.
   At noon EDT, Klaus was centered near latitude 17.2 north and
longitude 61.3 west, or about 30 miles east-northeast of Antigua.
The system's hurricane-force winds extended 30 miles from its
center and tropical-storm forces 115 miles out.
   In Barbados, southeast of Martinique, floodwaters forced the
evacuation of a few families overnight and temporarily blocked some
roads, although the major tourist hotels on the western coast were
unaffected.
   Islands covered by hurricane warnings included St. Martin, St.
Barthelemy, Saba, St. Eustatius, Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, the
British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and St. Kitts-Nevis.
   Many of the same islands were battered by Hurricane Hugo, which
devastated the region in September 1989 before hitting the Carolina
coast.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Josephine, downgraded last week to a
depression, strengthened in the mid-Atlantic to a hurricane late
Thursday. Josephine, with top winds of 75 mph, was reported at noon
EDT to be heading northeast at 16 mph about 750 miles southwest of
the mid-Atlantic Azores archipelago.
   Josephine, the fifth named hurricane of the season, posed no
immediate threat to land, located at latitude 32.6 north and
longitude 38.2 west.
   Tropical storms are upgraded to hurricanes when their maximum
sustained winds reach 74 mph.
   The hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Previous
hurricanes this year were Bertha, Diana, Gustav and Isidore.
