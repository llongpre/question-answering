   Coastal dwellers from Florida to Massachusetts nervously watched
the progress of Hurricane Hugo on Tuesday, hoping it would spin
harmlessly out to sea but fearing the worst.
   ``We've just been inundated with calls about preparedness,'' said
Dan Summers, who coordinates emergency operations in New Hanover
County, N.C., one of the places considered most vulnerable to the
storm.
   Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Florida said it
was too early to tell whether Hugo might turn toward the northwest
and take aim at the U.S. mainland or veer eastward and churn out
into the Atlantic.
   ``It is definitely a potential threat. People in the United
States should be monitoring this storm,'' said meteorologist Jesse
Moore at the Hurricane Center. ``Any time you have a hurricane with
winds of 105 mph or more possibly coming ashore in the beachfront
areas, you have the potential for a great deal of damage.''
   If it does assault the Eastern Seaboard, possibly as early as
Friday, Hugo could land anywhere from Florida to Massachusetts,
forecasters said, with North Carolina getting votes as the most
likely target.
   Hurricane Center director Bob Sheets said he expects to issue a
hurricane watch Wednesday from South Florida to Cape Hatteras, N.C.,
with the East Coast likely to feel the hurricane's effects in two to
three days.
   ``Hopefully, we'll be able to narrow that somewhat tomorrow,''
Sheets said.
   Emergency officials up and down the coast began making plans for
the hurricane, although most said it was too early to take any
defensive action.
   ``Right now, we're just watching the storm,'' said Robert Smith
of the Norfolk, Va., Office of Emergency Services. ``Tomorrow, we'll
be having a meeting with the shelter managers, school
superintendants and others to review the procedures.''
   In Georgia, Atlanta Red Cross spokeswoman Ann Willcox said all
emergency workers had been placed on standby alert and officials
were contacting volunteers to make sure they are prepared to help
out in a disaster.
   And in Florida, NASA officials fretted about the space shuttle
Atlantis, sitting on its pad at Cape Canaveral in preparation for an
October launch. Space agency officials decided to wait until
Wednesday before deciding whether to pull the spacecraft back into
the safety of its hangar _ a tedious procedure that could delay its
flight.
   The American Red Cross ordered food and made last-minute
preparations to open 58 shelters in Miami and 23 in Fort Lauderdale,
and several radio stations in central Florida planned to activate
storm tracking hotlines to keep residents up to date.
   Florida disaster worker Lee Barnett said he was ``assuming the
worst and hoping for the best.''
   Farther north, officials in New York and Massachusetts said they
were just keeping track of the storm and hoping their states weren't
on its itinerary.
   For those in charge of emergency agencies, preparations for a
hurricane can include stocking schools and evacuation centers with
food, notifying residents of evacuation plans and shoring up
vulnerable structures.
   Preprations for individual coastal residents are much the same.
   Martin Nelson, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center,
said anyone in Hugo's path should stock up on non-perishable food,
flashlight batteries and drinking water, and should make sure their
car has plenty of gas.
   Boat-owners should bring their vessels ashore if possible, and
residents closest to the water _ especially those in mobile homes _
should be ready to evacuate. Pet owners need to find places for
their animals, which usually aren't allowed at evacuation shelters.
   Nelson had warnings for the socially minded and the adventurous.
He said those in the hurricane's path shouldn't plan hurricane
parties, and no one should venture outside if they are in the eye of
a hurricane.
