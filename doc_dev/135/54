   Tropical storm Arthur weakened today as it moved
slowly through the Caribbean Sea, its winds dropping from
near-hurricane strength of 70 mph to 50 mph, the National Hurricane
Center said.
   A tropical storm watch remained for the southern coasts of Haiti
and the Dominican Republic, but the storm was on a track that made
it less of a threat to Hispaniola, the island shared by the two
countries, forecasters said.
   At noon EDT, Arthur's top sustained winds of 50 mph _ well below
the 74 mph minimum-hurricane strength _ were centered near latitude
15.3 north and longitude 69.0 west, or about 230 miles
south-southeast of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
   It was moving west-northwest at 20 and was expected to continue
that motion through the day, said Hal Gerrish, a hurricane
specialist at the center in suburban Coral Gables.
   ``Some further decrease in strength is likely during the next 24
hours,'' he said.
   Storm warnings for Trinidad, Tobago, Grenada and Grenada
dependencies were discontinued Wednesday after the storm passed
through from the Atlantic.
   Grenada reported winds gusting to 55 mph early Wednesday when
the center of Arthur passed over the island, and heavy rains were
reported on Tobago and other islands in the area, said Bob Sheets,
director of the hurricane center.
   Arthur, the 1990 Atlantic hurricane season's first named storm,
grew from a depression, the second of the 1990 season, that formed
Sunday in the open Atlantic. The hurricane season runs from June 1
to Nov. 30.
