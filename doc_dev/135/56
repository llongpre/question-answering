   Hurricane Dean turned away from Puerto Rico and the
Virgin Islands and moved slowly northward to the open Atlantic
today, apparently rendering its 85 mph winds harmless.
   All hurricane and flood warnings and watches have been lifted
throughout the eastern Caribbean, officials at the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables said today.
   ``The main thing is that it did what we wanted it do in that it
missed the islands down there,'' said forecaster Bob Case of the
hurricane center. ``It appears now that it's going to be a marine
problem for the next couple of days.''
   The waters north of the islands are heavily traveled by local
craft and cruise ships, but Case said the vessels will be able to
steer around Dean.
   ``Looking at the satellite, it looks like it's going to drift
northward,'' said forecaster Jesse Moore. Dean won't threaten any
land for days ``unless something really strange happens,'' he added.
   At noon EDT, the storm's center was located 210 miles northeast
of San Juan, Puerto Rico, near latitude 21.2 north and longitude
63.9 west. It was drifting slowly northward, and was expected to
pick up speed later today.
   A weakening of upper atmosphere winds that steer the storm kept
Dean away from the islands on Thursday.
   The Puerto Rican National Guard canceled plans to evacuate 2,000
people from flood-prone areas.
   Earlier, repeated warnings on television and radio that Dean was
headed for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico caused a shopping
rush as people stocked up on food, drinking water and buckets,
batteries, candles and tape.
   Dean was not expected to gain much strength today.
   ``It may pulsate a little bit in strength,'' forecaster Hal
Gerrish said. ``Normally when hurricanes slow down they strengthen.
In this particular case I think that's being offset by deleterious
winds at the upper level.''
   Dean, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season, became a
tropical storm Monday night and on Tuesday passed the hurricane
threshold of 74 mph winds.
