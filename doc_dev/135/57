   Prime Minister Lynden Pindling cut short
an official visit to Jamaica and returned to the Bahamas today
because of Hurricane Hugo, but it appeared the killer storm would
spare the islands a direct hit.
   Tropical storm warnings were posted for the central and
northeastern islands. However, light winds and scattered clouds
greeted morning commuters in Nassau.
   The center of Hugo was well to the east, in the open Atlantic,
and was on a course that would carry it safely past the northernmost
Bahamas.
   Late Tuesday, when Hugo appeared more threatening, shoppers and
tourists from the bustling cruise ship trade clogged the city's
downtown, displaying only modest concern that Hugo's 105 mph winds
were blowing a few hundred miles offshore.
   The government issued no emergency instructions, no emergency
shelters were set up and there was no sense of urgent storm
preparation.
   Pindling left the Bahamas on Monday for a Commonwealth Finance
Ministers meeting in Kingston, Jamaica. He was to head to Washington
at week's end.
   Forecasters today said that if Hugo maintained course, it would
continue moving parallel to the Bahamas, bringing high winds and
rains to the islands but not the death and destruction seen in other
parts of the eastern Caribbean.
   Officials at the Bahamas Meteorological Department in Nassau said
late Tuesday, however, there was cause for concern.
   ``It's not enough to deliver a devastating blow,'' said
meteorolgist Nicholas Small. ``But it's not far enough away for us
to relax. We're going to get a healthy tropical wind ranging between
39 and 73 mph, and possibly higher in gusts.''
   The government has begun some preparations: a work crew began
boarding up windows of government buildings. Reuben Henderson,
nailing plywood sheets over windows on a government office building,
said he and his crew had been given those instructions.
   Dorothea Seymour, a shopkeeper in the busy downtown Straw Market,
didn't seem too concerned.
   ``Some people care, some people don't,'' she said. ``We're always
hearing about storms, but they never come.''
   With her business 15 feet from Nassau Harbour, Ms. Seymour said
if the storm came, she would simply pack up her stock of straw
handbags, dolls, hats and T-shirts.
   Four cruise ships were tied up at Prince George Wharf just yards
away, their passengers browsing through shops about the city.
   ``We have not had any cancellations of cruise ships,'' said
Cordell Thompson, a spokesman for the Ministry of Tourism. ``And
there have been no cancellations of air service.''
   Thompson said he didn't think the Bahamas could avoid Hugo's
effects altogether.
   ``I suspect we're going to get a lot of rain and a lot of high
winds,'' he said.
   If the hurricane made a sharp turn to the northwest or the west _
toward the Bahamas _ ``we might start getting nervous,'' Thompson
said.
   Few vacationers appeared worried about facing a hurricane on New
Providence, the Bahamas' most populous island.
   Michael Belt, and his wife Rachelle, of Henderson, Ky., were
among them.
   ``I guess all the people here have to ride it out and I guess
I'll have to ride it out with them,'' Belt said.
   ``I think we'll make it through,'' said Mrs. Belt.
