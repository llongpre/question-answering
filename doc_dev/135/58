   Most Puerto Ricans remained without
running water Friday and 20,000 were still housed in shelters four
days after Hurricane Hugo blew across the island.
   Large parts of San Juan, the capital, and several towns in the
northeast were still without power and 70 percent of the Caribbean
island remained without tap water Friday, officials said. Hundreds
of residents in San Juan stood in long lines waiting for water, ice
and gasoline.
   When Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon arrived in the north coast town
of Canovanas on Friday to inspect local shelters, angry residents
complained they had received no govenment aid since the storm.
   ``We're all in the street. We don't have any food, water or
light. Our houses blew away,'' local resident Gladys Cruz told the
governor.
   Hernandez Colon said the federal government's ``inexplicable
excuses'' were responsible for delays in the delivery of four pumps
for Puerto Rico's main dam to replace those damaged by the storm.
The pumps arrived Friday in this U.S. commonwealth.
   The Carraizo Dam east of San Juan provides water to several
northern towns and the capital, where a third of the island's
population of 3.3 million live.
   The civil defense director in the west coast town of Mayaguez,
Anibal Roman, said he would request police escorts for truck convoys
of food to San Juan from his town, which was untouched by the
hurricane. He said he feared hurricane victims would ``attack us and
take away the merchandise.''
   The government said on Friday, 20,000 people remained in
shelters, including schools and churches.
   In its sweep across the northeastern Caribbean on Sunday and
Monday, Hugo wrecked thousands of homes, snapped power and
communication lines, and killed at least 20 people, including six on
Puerto Rico. Civil defense authorities say 26 died in the Caribbean
but only 20 have been detailed in an island-by-island breakdown.
   It was the worst storm to hit this island since Hurricane Betsy
killed 16 people on Aug. 12, 1956.
   Federal authorities said 80 percent of the El Yunque rainforest,
a mountain-top national park on the island's eastern end, was
ravaged by Hugo's 125 mph winds.
   Most of the forest's trees were knocked down, and all the leaves
were blown off, leaving the park a brown wasteland. Park authorities
said it could take up to 10 years for the forest to replenish itself.
   The park is the only tropical forest in the U.S. national forest
system.
   Authorities on Friday continued cleaning up Roosevelt Roads naval
base in Ceiba, on the east coast.
   At the base, the largest U.S. military installation outside the
continental United States, buildings were destroyed and water, power
and communications were knocked out when Hugo passed directly over
it. Ships and planes, however, escaped damage, officials said.
