   Rafael M. Estevez's hobby again became his
work Monday when Hurricane Hugo cut communications in the Caribbean,
turning ham radio operators into key sources of information for the
islands.
   During such emergencies, his home serves as base for a network of
ham radio operators helping people contact relatives and relaying
emergency information.
   ``I like this because I can help my community, my friends and
people I don't know,'' Estevez said.
   When Hugo left communications dependent on Estevez and other ham
radio operators, reporters descended on his home and television
camera cables snaked through his front door and across the living
room floor.
   Estevez, seated at a desk topped with ham radio equipment and two
telephones, gave live broadcasts in Spanish for several television
stations on the latest damage reports from notes he had jotted on a
pad.
   In the community of Arroyo on Puerto Rico's southeastern coast,
the mayor and several dozen other people stayed in a
theater-turned-shelter after Hugo passed because most homes were
destroyed and power lines lying in the streets made travel
dangerous, Estevez reported.
   A huge wave, about 30 feet high, reportedly struck the village's
beach, he said.
   The islands of Vieques and Culebra off the eastern end of Puerto
Rico were ``severely pounded'' by Hugo with wind reported up to 135
mph, he said.
   ``There's a lot of roofless houses,'' he said.
   Estevez is president and founder of the International Society of
Radio Amateurs, with members in Central America and South America.
Plaques on his wall praise the group's work, including transmitting
information during the United States' invasion of Grenada.
   Estevez works at Hialeah Park Race Track taking bets and does
racetrack publicity for the Spanish-speaking media, but said he is
excused from work during emergencies like Hugo.
   A fellow ham radio operator, Robert Pastor, fielded phone calls
while pressing Estevez to eat a late lunch.
   Estevez, 50, recalled other disasters, including the 1972
Nicaraguan earthquake. He said radio operators serve as a vital link
for people trying to contact relatives in disaster-struck areas.
   ``Earthquakes, you get more victims than hurricanes,'' he said.
``Hurricanes, you get less victims but more damage.''
   Ham radio operator Bernard ``Bob'' Sternberg of Sunrise also
relayed information Monday. He said he transmitted assistance
requests for the eastern Caribbean island of Montserrat to the Red
Cross in Washington, and talked to a St. Croix ham radio operator
who described ``utter destruction'' on that island.
   Sternberg said he spoke early Monday to a ham radio operator on a
boat anchored in a mangrove swamp at Vieques. He said the operator
told him there was ``no wind, no rain and he knew he was in the eye
of the storm,'' and said he was making preparations for the full
brunt of the hurricane.
   ``He asked us to pray for him and we did,'' Sternberg said. ``We
prayed for all of them.''
