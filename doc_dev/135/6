   Hurricane Hugo, the most powerful storm to hit the
northeastern Caribbean in a decade, was bearing down on the Leeward
Islands today with 140 mph winds and a 10-foot wall of water.
   ``This is an extremely dangerous hurricane,'' hurricane
specialist Max Mayfield at the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables said. ``This is stonger than Hurricane David back in
1979,'' which left 1,200 dead in the Caribbean and Florida.
   At noon EDT today, Hugo's center near 15.6 north latitude and
59.0 west longitude, or about 175 miles east-southeast of the French
resort island of Guadeloupe in the Leeward Islands. It was expected
to hit the island this afternoon or tonight, said forecaster Martin
Nelson, before moving in the direction of Puerto Rico.
   The hurricane was moving west at 14 mph, sending showers and
gusty winds to the eastern edge of the Caribbean.
   The storm's strength flucutated this morning, dipping from 150
mph at 6 a.m. to 140 mph at 9 a.m. It was expected to continue to do
so as the size of the eye contracts and expands, forecasters said,
but storm-force winds of 39 mph and above extend 150 miles from the
center.
   In Paris, Air France announced it was canceling all three of its
flights scheduled today to Martinique because of the storm.
Miami-based Eastern Airlines planned no cancellations or reroutings
today, but spokesman Robin Matell said, ``We'll keep monitoring it
very closely.''
   Forecasters won't be able to tell for five or six days whether
Hugo will hit the coastal United States, forecaster Jim Gross said.
   A hurricane warning was posted from St. Lucia north to St. Martin
including the British Virgin Islands, and a hurricane watch the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico may be upgraded to a warning today. A
tropical storm watch was in effect for the islands of Barbados and
St. Vincent, according to the hurricane center.
   Forecasters classed the hurricane in Category 4, meaning it is
considered capable of extreme damage. If its sustained winds grow to
155 mph, it would be classified in Category 5, capable of
catastrophic damage. Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the
United States since record-keeping began; the latest, Camille in
1969, killed 256 people.
   Islanders were warned to expect rainfall amounts of 5 to 10
inches and a storm surge with waves 10 feet higher than normal.
   Dominica, Guadeloupe's closest neighbor to the south, has only
recently recovered from the destruction David wrought 10 years ago,
when floods and mud slides poured down from mountains onto coastal
towns and villages.
   On Martinique, the next island in the chain, school officials
canceled classes today.
   A disaster response team from Miami's Metro Dade Fire Department
established a communications center in Barbados, about 200 miles
south of Hugo's path, to assess damage and coordinate emergency
medical treatment throughout the Leeward Islands.
   At the U.S. Coast Guard station in San Juan, Puerto Rico,
guardsmen were preparing for the storm Friday.
   ``You go around and police the area and pick up anything that can
become a missile hazard,'' Petty Officer Alan Burd said.
   The island chain has escaped the worst of previous hurricanes
this year. Dean, Erin and Gabrielle turned north toward Bermuda
before reaching the Caribbean. This time, there were no signs of the
lowering atmospheric pressure that veered the others away.
   Hugo is the eighth named storm of the current Atlantic hurricane
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Tropical storms have
maximum sustained winds of 39 mph and reach hurricane status when
winds reach 74 mph.
