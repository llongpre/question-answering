   Hurricane Dean drifted northward Friday in the open
Atlantic Ocean after veering away from northern Caribbean islands
and the southeastern Bahamas, forecasters said.
   ``It may strengthen a little bit. There are changes that are
taking place around it,'' said Bob Sheets, director of the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Dean's winds of 85 mph were centered near
23.0 north latitude and 64.91 west longitude, about 600 miles
southeast of Bermuda. The hurricane was moving north at about 12
mph, forecasters said.
   ``Our latest reconnaissance positions indicate that indeed it
may start a little bit more fast speed toward the north, and you
can see that on the satellite,'' Sheets said.
   A weakening of upper atmosphere currents that steer the storm
kept Dean away from the islands Thursday, after it initially headed
toward the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.
   The hurricane was moving very slowly.
   ``We're still expecting it to turn to the north and then
eventually go to the northeast,'' said forecaster Jim Gross. Asked
about the storm's potential for hitting Bermuda in about three
days, he said: ``They're very easy to miss.''
   The second hurricane of the Atlantic season became a tropical
storm Monday night and was reclassified a hurricane Tuesday when
its maximum sustained wind speed passed 74 mph.
