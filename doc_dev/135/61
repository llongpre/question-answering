   Tropical Storm Klaus bore down
Thursday on the eastern Caribbean after causing severe flooding on
the French island of Martinique, where six people were reported
dead and two missing.
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Klaus, the 11th
named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, had sustained winds
of 60 mph and could grow into a hurricane by Friday.
   Hurricane warnings were issued for the Leeward Islands along an
arc from the French and Dutch island of St. Martin-St. Maarten in
the north to the British colony of Montserrat in the south.
Tropical storm warnings remained in effect for Martinique and its
sister island of Guadeloupe.
   ``The storm has been showing signs of getting stronger, and
we're forecasting the possibility of it becoming a hurricane within
the next 24 hours,'' said forecaster Miles Lawrence at the
hurricane center.
   Klaus was expected to pass near the sparsely populated island of
Barbuda late Thursday or early Friday, the center reported.
   Tropical storms are upgraded to hurricanes when their maximum
sustained winds reach 74 mph.
   The hurricane center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was
possible for the islands of the northeastern Caribbean. That could
trigger flash flooding and mudslides.
   Stan Cieniewicz, administrative officer for the Pan-Caribbean
Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Project in Antigua, said
commercial airlines were flying to the region as scheduled.
   He said authorities in Guadeloupe warned residents to move
cattle to protected areas, to avoid long road trips and to keep
away from rivers that could overflow in heavy rains.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Klaus was centered near latitude 17.0 north and
longitude 61.0 west, or about 55 miles east of Antigua. It was
moving northwest at 6 mph, with tropical storm-force winds
extending 115 miles from its center.
   Earlier, Klaus dumped torrential rain on Martinique, a French
overseas department of 336,000 inhabitants, where six people were
reported drowned in floodwaters that reached nearly 10 feet in
places. Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes as rain
continued for a second day Thursday.
   Among the dead were two sisters, aged 8 and 14, who were swept
from a bridge Wednesday in St. Joseph, authorities said. Rescuers
found their bodies Thursday.
   Four men were drowned in different parts of the island. They
included a 56-year-old farmer who fell from his tractor into a
flooded ditch.
   Two fishermen - a father and son - were reported missing
Thursday in Riviere Pilote. Officials told Radio Caribbean
International that the local outdoor market and soccer stadium were
under 5{ feet of water.
   Jocelyne Van Elverdinghe, an aide to Prefect Jean-Claude Roure,
the French government's representative on the island, said flooding
forced 750 people from their homes in Lamentin.
   Schools were closed throughout the island. Flooding disrupted
telephone and electrical service.
   In Barbados, southeast of Martinique, floodwaters forced the
evacuation of a few families overnight and temporarily blocked some
roads, although the major tourist hotels on the western coast were
unaffected.
   Lightning knocked out electricity across the island Wednesday
night.
   High wind downed utility poles and trees in Dominica to the
north.
   Islands covered by hurricane warnings included St. Martin-St.
Maarten, St. Barthelemy, Saba, St. Eustatius, Antigua and Barbuda,
Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and St.
Kitts-Nevis.
   Many of the same islands were battered by Hurricane Hugo, which
devastated the region in September 1989 before hitting the Carolina
coast.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Josephine, with winds near 70 mph, was
reported at 6 p.m. to be drifting north at 8 mph in the
mid-Atlantic about 1,050 miles southwest of the Azores.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.
