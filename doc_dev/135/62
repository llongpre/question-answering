   Officials handed out $300 emergency
checks Monday to islanders who lost their homes in Hurricane Hugo,
which caused an estimated $1 billion damage to Puerto Rico.
   Much of this island and its neighbors in the eastern Caribbean
remained without water and electricity Monday, one week after Hugo
and its 125-mph winds whipped through the region.
   Relief from the United States and Caribbean islands that escaped
Hugo's destruction has poured into Puerto Rico, which Gov. Rafael
Hernandez Colon said sustained $1 billion in damage and caused the
deaths of seven people on the island. Earlier reports had put the
dead at six.
   The federal government, working with Puerto Rican officials,
began distributing the $300 emergency checks to families without
homes. By Monday, 7,000 checks had been approved, but officials
were uncertain how many people would eventually receive them.
   The governor met with school superintendents and asked them to
take a census of the number of families without homes. Various
government estimates range from 25,000 to 53,000 of Puerto Rico's
750,000 families are homeless.
   Jose Bravo, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Administration on this U.S. Commonwealth, said the maximum aid to a
single family is $10,000 if its property is in a disaster zone. The
capital, San Juan, and other communities on the eastern side of
this island were declared disaster areas.
   The Puerto Rico water company estimated 800,000 of Puerto Rico's
3.3 million people were still without water service Monday. Luis
Ruiz Javier, executive director of the company, said San Juan
should be receiving water by Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, people were taking water from swimming pools, bathing
at fire hydrants or in the sea, and filling buckets at portable
tanks distributed throughout the city. Two U.S. Navy destroyers,
each carrying 10,000 gallons of fresh water, distributed water at a
San Juan harbor.
   The Electric Power Authority reported it had restored power to
70 percent of the island, although much of the capital remained
without electricity.
   On the eastern Caribbean island of Antigua, the government
reported $90 million in damages and 420 people homeless out of a
total population of 85,000.
   A government emergency committee said much of the country was
left without power, water and telephone service, but public
utilities should be restored by the weekend.
   Only one death was confirmed, a 74-year-old woman who ran from
her home seeking shelter during the hurricane. Earlier, two people
were reported to have died.
   A total of 33 to 35 people were reported killed by Hugo, which
swept through Sept. 17-18.
   Aid and relief personnel were arriving from Caribbean neighbors
that escaped the storm, including Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana and
Jamaica. Much of the relief was for the British colony of
Montserrat, where 10 people were killed, 30 percent of the homes
destroyed and damages of $100 million were incurred.
   In the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Coast Guard reported a storage
tank at the Virgin Islands Water and Power Authority was still
leaking at a rate of 42,000 gallons a day.
   They said the tank, damaged by the storm, still contained 1.25
million gallons, but that the oil was no longer seeping into the
harbor. The Guard also said 40,000 gallons that did reach the
harbor had been confined in containment booms.
   Military and civilian cargo planes continued to unload relief
supplies at St. Croix, where Hugo damaged 90 percent of the homes
and left 45,000 homeless. Gov. Alexander Farrell estimates property
damage at $500 million.
   About 1,200 U.S. troops sent to quell widespread looting were
helping in the relief effort.
   On neighboring St. Thomas, capital of the U.S. Virgin Islands,
heavy overnight rains caused flash flooding, sending mud and water
into some homes already hit hard by the hurricane. There were no
reports of injuries from the flooding, however.
