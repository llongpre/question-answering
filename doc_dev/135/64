   The 1989 Atlantic hurricane season,
which began today, should be milder than last year's, a leading
storm forecaster says.
   Colorado State University professor William Gray predicted
Wednesday that there would be only four hurricanes and seven
tropical storms during the season, which runs through Nov. 30.
   ``This will be a below-average year in the number of hurricanes,
and they will be less intense,'' Gray, a teacher of atmospheric
sciences, told a conference of the American Meteorological Society.
   In the last six years, Gray has made near-perfect predictions
about the number of hurricanes formed in the Atlantic, using reams
of data on such things as ocean temperature patterns.
   Last year, there were six hurricanes, including Gilbert, a
particularly strong storm that killed more than 300 people and
wrought heavy damage in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica and
Mexico; and Joan, which devastated parts of Nicaragua. In addition,
there were five tropical storms.
   Weather disturbances that begin in the tropics are classified as
tropical storms, and given a name, when their sustained winds reach
39 mph. They are classified as hurricanes if their winds reach 74
mph.
   During the average Atlantic season 10 tropical storms develop
and six of them become hurricanes.
   In Coral Gables, the National Hurricane Center on Wednesday
released the 21 names that will be given 1989 hurricanes and
tropical storms in the Atlantic.
   The names are: Allison, Barry, Chantal, Dean, Erin, Felix,
Gabrielle, Hugo, Iris, Jerry, Karen, Luis, Marilyn, Noel, Opal,
Pablo, Roxanne, Sebastien, Tanya, Van and Wendy.
   Bob Sheets, director of the hurricane center, cautioned that
apathy and unfamiliarity with the destructive power of a major
hurricane could prove fatal.
   In his annual hurricane awareness warning Wednesday, Sheets
said: ``If a major storm strikes a coastal metropolitian center
this year, the risk of fatalities is high because the endangered
population will face congested evacuation routes, insufficient
escape and too little experience in hurricane survival.''
   His comments were echoed by other disaster officials, who said
they fear that newcomers to a region and tourists, in particular,
sometimes don't take storm warnings seriously enough.
   ``Getting people to take hurricanes seriously is the biggest
problem,'' said Rick Scofield, assistant director of Disaster
Services for Miami's Red Cross. ``When a community goes a long time
without a major storm, they're less sensitive to the danger.''
