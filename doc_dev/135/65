   For some Caribbean islands it will
take years to recover fully from Hurricane Hugo, but most are
quickly bouncing back and starting to rebuild, business analysts
and government officials say.
   ``I think initially we had thought it was going to be much worse
than it's turning out to be,'' said Dorla Humes, a senior economist
for the Barbados-based Caribbean Development Bank, which is
assessing damage on Montserrat, Dominica and the twin island states
of Antigua and Barbuda and St. Kitts-Nevis.
   Nevertheless, Ms. Humes and others said the widespread
destruction of homes, buildings, hotels, roads and utilities would
set back the economies of the small eastern Caribbean island
nations, which have grown rapidly in recent years on the strength
of a buoyant tourism industry.
   ``Certainly for the rest of this year, and perhaps well into
next year, there is going to be a slowdown in economic activity in
most of the islands affected by the hurricane,'' she said.
   Hurricane Hugo buffeted a dozen islands along a 500-mile arc
from Dominica to Puerto Rico on a two-day sweep of the eastern
Caribbean, Sept. 16-17, before slamming into the South Carolina
coast.
   The storm, which carried winds of 140 mph and heavy rain, killed
an estimated 56 people in the Caribbean and 29 on the U.S.
mainland, left thousands homeless and caused billions of dollars in
damage.
   In St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands, about 1,000 military
police are still on duty and a nighttime curfew remains in effect
even though there have been no disturbances since hundreds of
residents went on a four-day looting spree during and after the
hurricane.
   St. Croix, about 70 miles east of Puerto Rico, was by far the
hardest hit of the three main islands of the U.S. territory.
Federal officials said 6,300 homes in St. Croix, or one-third of
the total, were heavily damaged or destroyed. Power, water and
telephone service still have not been fully restored, and dozens of
plundered stores stand vacant.
   The territorial government has estimated damage on St. Croix and
the two other main islands, St. Thomas and St. John, at $500
million. Lt. Gov. Derek Hodge said he thought it would take at
least two years for St. Croix to fully recover.
   Similarly, Montserrat, a British colony of 12,500 inhabitants
about 200 miles southeast of Puerto Rico, was all but flattened by
the hurricane. Ten people were killed and one-fourth of the
population was left homeless.
   ``You're talking about a rewrite of that country,'' said Melvin
Edwards, a regional coordinator for the Caribbean Association of
Industry and Commerce in Barbados. ``You're going to have basically
a different country in five years.''
   The French island of Guadeloupe, with a population of 340,000,
also was extensively damaged and 15,000 people were left homeless.
   Hundreds of conscript French soldiers are helping repair downed
utility poles, but as of last week, 40 percent of the island
remained without power and 40 percent without telephones.
   Elsewhere, however, power, water and communications have been
restored and reconstruction is well under way, officials say.
   In Puerto Rico, easily the most economically advanced, and with
3.3 million inhabitants, most populous of the islands struck by
Hugo, life has virtually returned to normal except for the extreme
east and the two small offshore islands of Culebra and Vieques.
   Banco Popular, Puerto Rico's largest bank, estimated total
damage at $1.1 billion dollars, including lost production. Chief
economist Augusto Amato said economic growth would probably
constrict this year from a projected 3.4 percent to 3.1 percent.
But he said recovery is occurring so quickly the economy should be
back to normal by the third quarter of next year.
   ``Right now, the economy is recovering very, very fast,
especially in the eastern quarter where most of the manufacturing
is located,'' Amato said. ``We had expected the blow to be more
severe.''
   He said Puerto Rico could expect a ``mini-boom'' in construction
as the island rebuilds with millions of dollars in insurance and
federal disaster assistance filtering through the economy. The Bush
administration has allocated $1.1 billion in disaster assistance
for North and South Carolina, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
   Carl Mitchell, director of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States' Economic Secretariat, based in Antigua, said Hugo was the
most destructive hurricane to hit the eastern Caribbean since the
1920s.
   In the four OECS countries affected _ Montserrat, Dominica, St.
Kitts-Nevis and Antigua and Barbuda _ the hurricane demolished 800
to 1,000 low-income houses and three hospitals and heavily damaged
roads and electrical, water and telephone systems.
   Dominica, the southernmost of the islands affected, escaped
serious property damage, but lost 80 percent of its banana crop,
the impoverished country's main export and foreign-exchange earner,
Mitchell said.
   Substantial damage to citrus crops, livestock, poultry and the
fishing industry also occurred throughout the region.
   But Mitchell said that in most of the islands ``the
emergency-relief phase is virtually over. The help we will be
looking for will be for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of
the economies.''
   The priority now is getting hotels back in shape in time for the
winter tourist season starting in December, he said.
   ``Fortunately, with the exception of Montserrat, tourism has not
been that badly affected by the hurricane,'' Mitchell said.
``Tourism is one of the industries that can rebound most quickly.''
