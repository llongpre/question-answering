   The Small Business Administration
said Wednesday it expects to authorize up to $300 million in loans
for Puerto Rican businesses damaged by Hurricane Hugo.
   Agency administrator Susan S. Engeleiter on Wednesday visited
Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon to brief him on progress made in
hurricane aid requests.
   She said she had also come to ``ensure him that the earthquake
in California will not affect the aid to be received by Puerto
Rico.''
   Hurricane Hugo ravaged the Caribbean and coastal South Carolina
last month. The storm killed 33 people in the Caribbean and 29 on
the mainland United States, coming ashore at Charleston, S.C., on
Sept. 21.
   More than 60 people were killed in the Oct. 17 quake in northern
California, according to the official toll.
   Ms. Engeleiter said that so far, her agency had received 1,567
requests for emergency loans from storm-stricken business owners in
Puerto Rico and 1,690 in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
   She said the agency expected to hand out $250 million to $300
million in hurricane loans to small businesses on Puerto Rico.
   The administrator said the agency expects to provide a total of
about $700 million in loans for hurricane-stricken businesses in
the Caribbean and U.S. East Coast.
   She said her agency in an average year distributes only about
$250 million in loans to small businesses throughout the United
States.
