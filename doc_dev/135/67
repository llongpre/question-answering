   Forecasters today upgraded Tropical Storm Erin to
hurricane status but said the season's third hurricane continued to
pose little threat to land.
   A report from a ship that passed near Erin's center led
forecasters today to upgrade the mid-Atlantic storm to a hurricane
with 75 mph winds, the National Hurricane Center said.
   The ship relayed its observations after the storm pushed through
a low-pressure trough that boosted its strength, forecasters said.
Earlier in the day, the storm's winds had been estimated at only 45
mph.
   Erin's center was located at 10 a.m. EDT about 1,100 miles
southwest of the Azores near 29.7 north latitude and 44.7 west
longitude, said forecasters at the hurricane center in suburban
Coral Gables.
   The system moving north-northwest at about 17 mph was given
little chance of making it to the United States as a hurricane,
forecasters said.
   While the hurricane posed no danger to land, it was touching
shipping lanes.
   ``It's like the I-95 of the ocean between Bermuda and Puerto
Rico,'' said Bob Ebaugh, weather service specialist, referring to
the interstate highway that runs along the East Coast.
   The weather service routinely requests information from ships
sailing within 300 nautical miles of a storm, he said.
   Erin formed as a tropical depression Friday off Africa and became
a named storm Sunday night when sustained winds reached 39 mph.
Hurricanes are formed when winds hit 74 mph.
   There have been seven depressions in the current Atlantic
hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Before Erin,
four had become named storms and two of those had developed into
hurricanes.
