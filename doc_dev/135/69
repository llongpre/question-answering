   Tropical Storm Klaus weakened into a depression and
moved further into the open Atlantic Sunday after unleashing wind
and rain that left at least six dead and 1,500 homeless in the
northeastern Caribbean.
   Klaus briefly reached hurricane status Friday, but was
downgraded to a tropical storm Saturday and then dropped to
depression-level winds of 35 mph Sunday evening, forecasters said.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the center of the depression was located at
latitude 19.8 north and longitude 67.0 west, or about 105 miles
northwest of San Juan, Puerto Rico.
   The depression was moving west-northwest at near 14 mph, and the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables said little
change in strentgh or direction was expected through Monday.
   The hurricane center on Saturday lifted all storm warnings and
watches for the northeastern Caribbean. By Sunday night, it said
most Klaus-related showers were well east of any land.
   Klaus, the 11th named storm and the sixth hurricane of the
Atlantic hurricane season, skirted Antigua on Friday, tearing roofs
from houses but causing no major damage.
   The French island of Martinique south of the Leewards was by far
the hardest hit. Heavy rain since Tuesday spawned landslides and
serious flooding, forcing 1,500 people from their homes and killing
six people, authorities said.
   Wind and flood damage also occurred on Barbados, Dominica and
St. Lucia, where banana growers said about 15 percent of this
year's crop was destroyed. They estimated damages at $1 million.
