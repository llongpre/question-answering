   When it's all counted up, the damage from
Hurricane Hugo may exceed $8 billion, the director of the National
Hurricane Center said Thursday.
   Robert Sheets told a Senate committee that damage from the
September storm could climb to the $8 billion to $10 billion level,
in his opinion.
   The insurance industry is currently estimating its losses at $4
billion, Sheets said. ``In the past we have found that total losses
get close to two to three times the insurance loss,'' he told the
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.
   ``I've never seen such massive damage as with Hurricane Hugo,''
said Sheets, who has toured the damaged regions, including South
Carolina's coastal zones.
   Sheets said the nation was somewhat lucky with Hugo, because the
storm struck in such a way that the most powerful wind and waves
slammed into the Francis Marion National Forest, an area with few
human residents.
   If it had struck a major metropolitan area, the destruction
would have been much greater, he said.
   Sheets' comments came at a hearing on modernization of the
National Weather Service, and he pointed out that improved weather
radars planned for the future will make hurricane forecasting
easier and more accurate.
   Sens. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
questioned the proposed cuts in Weather Service offices planned
over the next decade under the modernization.
   The improved technology will mean that the National Weather
Service will be able to give the same or better service with fewer
offices, contended John Knauss, director of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
   ``The whole point ... is top provide better service, '' he said.
``We guarantee we will not provide any less service in any
location. If we can't do that, we will not close the station.''
Knauss said.
   Stevens indicated disbelief, saying that cutting from 10 weather
stations to three in Alaska could have serious results in a state
where aviation and fishing are major activities.
   Elbert W. Friday, director of the National Weather Service, said
new radar systems will dramatically improve forecasting of storms.
In tests at Norman, Okla., the radars improved prediction of severe
weather from 58 percent to 91 percent, he said.
   The installation of new radars will provide improved coverage of
Alaska, he said, especially along the coastline.
   ``We've proven the technology so far. We've proven the science
so far ...'' said Friday.
