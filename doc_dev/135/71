   Hurricane Hugo continued its track toward the continental United
States on Wednesday, while Tropical Storm Iris weakened and locally
heavy rain fell along much of the Eastern Seaboard.
   Hugo, still packing wind blowing at a sustained 105 mph, was
southeast of Savannah, Ga., during the afternoon.
   Forecasters warned that the storm blamed for at least 25 deaths
in the Caribbean could come ashore late Thursday or early Friday
anywhere from northeastern Florida to Cape Hatteras, N.C.
   Behind Hugo, Tropical Storm Iris began to weaken, having gotten
too close to Hugo. The storm, north of the northern Leeward Islands,
had maximum sustained wind speed of only 55 mph.
   Rain fell across much of New England and along the middle
Atlantic Coast and showers and thunderstorms were scattered along
the rest of the coast.
   North Carolina, New York state, Vermont and the middle Atlantic
Coast reported 1 to 3 inches of rain during the 24-hour period up to
8 a.m. EDT. Three to 6 inches of rain drenched sections of eastern
Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey.
   During the 6 hours up to 2 p.m. EDT, 1.50 inches of rain fell at
Richmond, Va.
   Syracuse, N.Y., got 1.77 inches of rain Tuesday, a record for the
date.
   Coincidentally, on the West Coast, Los Angeles also had a record
rain amount for the day, at 0.27 of an inch.
   Two to 3 inches of rain was reported in New York state's Essex
County early in the day, prompting a flood warning for the Au Sable
River.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms developing along a warm
front were scattered from northern Utah to Nebraska and the Dakotas.
   A few showers and thunderstorms developed over the lower Rio
Grande Valley of Texas.
   Wednesday's low in the Lower 48 states was 24 degrees at West
Yellowstone, Mont.
