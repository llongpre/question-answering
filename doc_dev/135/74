   Hurricane forecasters Monday were tracking three
tropical depressions, the closest one expected to gradually
strengthen as it moves into the western Caribbean.
   The newest tropical depression formed Monday in the middle
Atlantic Ocean, east of the Lesser Antilles. The westward-moving
system's highest sustained winds were near 35 mph around a center
roughly 325 miles east of the island of Guadeloupe, the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables reported at 10:30 p.m.
Monday. The depression was moving about 20 to 25 mph.
   An Air Force reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled to
investigate the depression Tuesday morning.
   Forecasters were most concerned with the Caribbean depression,
which was moving west-northwest at about at about 15 to 20 mph and
had highest sustained winds of near 35 mph, the hurricane center
said. The poorly organized depression was about 175 miles southeast
of Kingston, Jamaica.
   ``The one in the Caribbean probably has the best potential,''
said forecaster Bob Case. ``Once it moves into the western
Caribbean, it seems more favorable for development.''
   Some strengthening was expected over the next 24 hours, Case
said Monday.
   ``Any time there's a tropical depression southeast of us at this
time of year, you need to pay attention,'' Case added.
   Of the tropical activity, Case said it was ``quite normal'' at
this point in the hurricane season, which began June 1 and ends
Nov. 30.
   ``We're really approaching the peak of the season,'' he said.
   Little strengthening was expected in the newly formed depression
unless it slowed its forward speed, Case said.
   Meanwhile, the most distant system, located about 200 miles
northwest of Santo Antao in the Cape Verde Islands off west Africa,
was moving northwest at 15 to 20 mph into colder water, and little
change in strength was expected until a gradual decrease late
Tuesday. Its highest sustained winds were estimated near 35 mph.
   Depressions are upgraded to named tropical storms when their
sustained winds reach 39 mph and to hurricanes when winds hit 74
mph. There have been two tropical storms so far in the 1988
Atlantic Ocean hurricane season, but neither reached hurricane
strength.
