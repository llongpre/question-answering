   Hurricane Hugo lost some of its fury as it roared northward
Friday, fading to a tropical storm and then dwindling to an unnamed
storm that nevertheless brought heavy rain and the threat of
flooding from Tennessee to New York.
   Rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches were possible in the storm's
path, and forecasters warned that isolated tornadoes were possible
from Virginia to Pennsylvania.
   The storm produced 6 inches of rain at Savannah, Ga., in 24 hours.
   Hurricane Hugo packed winds of 135 mph as it hit the South
Carolina coast Wednesday night. Its eye passed just east of
Charleston, moved northwest to just west of Sumter and entered North
Carolina just west of Charlotte.
   The strong wind downed thousands of trees, damaged roofs,
destroyed homes, blew over signs and bent steel towers to the
ground. Hugo dumped 3.16 inches of rain in about 12 hours at
Charlotte, and during the early morning produced wind to 69 mph with
gusts to 87 mph.
   Thunderstorms associated with Hugo also produced wind gusts to 60
mph at Myrtle Beach, S.C., and wind gusts to 109 mph at Sumter, S.C.
At Snowshoe, W.Va., wind Friday gusted to 60 mph.
   Tree damage was so extensive in North Carolina that the state
forest service had to be called in to help clear the debris and
downed trees.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from Mississippi and Alabama
to the lower Great Lakes region and New York state Friday afternoon.
Heavier rainfall totals for the six-hour period ending at 8 a.m. EDT
included 3 inches at Savannah, Ga., 1 inch at Myrtle Beach, S.C.,
and .98 inches at Birmingham, Ala.
   Strong northwesterly winds were ushering cold Canadian air into
the north central United States. Showers and thurderstorms were
reported over southwest Texas and southern New Mexico.
   Forecasters posted flood watches for western Massachusetts and
western Connecticut and flash flood watches for Vermont and eastern
New York state. They posted overnight freeze warnings for Minnesota,
South Dakota, northwest Iowa and northern and west-central Wisconsin.
   The cold spot in the nation Friday was West Yellowstone, Mont.,
with a low of 26 degrees.
   Afternoon temperatures were warming into the 80s across the
southern Atlantic Coast and from south-central Texas through eastern
Texas to the central Gulf Coast; in the 90s in the desert Southwest;
in the 40s across the Dakotas, eastern Montana and northern
Minnesota.
