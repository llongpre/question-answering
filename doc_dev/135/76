   Busy shoppers and tourists from the
bustling cruise ship trade clogged downtown Nassau, displaying only
modest concern that Hurricane Hugo's 105 mph winds were blowing a
few hundred miles offshore.
   On Tuesday, the government issued no emergency instructions or
orders, no evacuation route signs were visible about the city, no
emergency shelters were set up and there was no sense of urgent
storm preparation.
   The prime minister, Lynden Pindling, was out of the country.
Pindling left the archipelago Monday for a Commonwealth Finance
Ministers meeting in Kingston, Jamaica. He was to head to
Washington, D.C., at week's end.
   Forecasters early today said that if Hugo maintained its current
path, it would continue moving parallel to the Bahamas, bringing
high winds and rains to the islands but not the death and
destruction seen in other parts of the eastern Caribbean.
   Officials at the Bahamas Meteorological Department in Nassau said
late Tuesday, however, there was cause for concern.
   ``It's not enough to deliver a devastating blow,'' said
Meteorolgist Nicholas Small. ``But it's not far enough away for us
to relax. We're going to get a healthy tropical wind ranging between
39 and 73 mph, and possibly higher in gusts.''
   The government has begun some preparations: a work crew began
boarding up windows of government buildings. Reuben Henderson,
nailing plywood sheets over windows on a government office building,
said he and his crew had been given those instructions.
   Dorothea Seymour, a shopkeeper in the busy downtown Straw Market,
didn't seem too concerned.
   ``Some people care, some people don't,'' she said. ``We're always
hearing about storms, but they never come.''
   With her business 15 feet from Nassau Harbour, Ms. Seymour said
if the storm came, she would simply pack up her stock of straw
handbags, dolls, hats and T-shirts.
   Four cruise ships were tied up at Prince George Wharf just yards
away, their passengers browsing through shops about the city.
   ``We have not had any cancellations of cruise ships,'' said
Cordell Thompson, a spokesman for the Ministry of Tourism. ``And
there have been no cancellations of air service.''
   Thompson said he didn't think the Bahamas could avoid Hugo's
effects altogether.
   ``I suspect we're going to get a lot of rain and a lot of high
winds,'' he said.
   If the hurricane made a sharp turn to the northwest or the west _
toward the Bahamas _ ``we might start getting nervous,'' Thompson
said.
   Few vacationers appeared worried about facing a hurricane on New
Providence, the Bahamas' most populous island.
   Michael Belt, and his wife Rachelle, of Henderson, Ky., were
among them.
   ``I guess all the people here have to ride it out and I guess
I'll have to ride it out with them,'' Belt said.
   ``I think we'll make it through,'' said Mrs. Belt.
