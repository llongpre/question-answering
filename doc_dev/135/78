   Hurricane Dean veered away from the
U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico on Thursday, carrying its 85
mph winds farther out to sea and reducing the threat to the Florida
coast, forecasters said.
   They said the season's second hurricane would probably sweep 150
miles north of Puerto Rico on its way up the Atlantic Ocean.
   The National Weather Service lifted hurricane and flood warnings
for all the islands of the eastern Caribbean, including the Virgin
Islands and Puerto Rico, where authorities had begun putting
emergency measures into effect.
   The Puerto Rican National Guard canceled plans to evacuate 2,000
people from flood-prone areas.
   A hurricane watch was issued for the Turks and Caicos Islands, a
British colony at the southern tip of the Bahamas chain, 550 miles
south of Miami. A watch, which is less serious than a warning,
means hurricane conditions could pose a threat to coastal or inland
communities.
   Dean turned toward the Bahamas but was expected to resume its
northwesterly course out to sea later Thursday, the weather service
reported.
   At 9 p.m. EDT, the hurricane's center was at latitude 20.1 north
and longitude 64.0 west, or 175 miles northeast of San Juan, Puerto
Rico. Dean was moving northwest at 5 mph.
   Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla., said Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands could
get some heavy rain and gusting winds, ``but no real problems.''
   ``The biggest problem in the islands is usually flash floods and
mudslides, so there is some potential for that,'' he said, ``but
it's not going to be as if the core of the storm was coming across
there.''
   Sheets said the storm, which had been heading toward Florida,
was curving to the north, away from land, and did not pose an
immediate threat to the U.S. mainland.
   ``It is not a problem for the next two to three days and
probably will not become a problem,'' he said. ``There is still a
chance it might get blocked and turned back to the west, but that's
unlikely at this moment.''
   The storm strengthened overnight as it zigzagged west-northwest
of the Leeward Island chain, missing the nearest island, Barbuda.
   Repeated warnings on television and radio that Dean was headed
for the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico caused a shopping rush as
people stocked up on food, drinking water and buckets, batteries,
candles and tape.
   In San Juan, a city of 1.1 million people, the windows of many
houses and condominiums were taped or boarded up, and some
businesses closed.
   Government workers on both U.S. islands at first were given the
day off, but later those in the Virgin Islands were told to report
for work.
   Dean grew into a tropical storm Monday night.
