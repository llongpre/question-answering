   Hurricane Hugo, the mightiest storm to hit the northeastern
Caribbean in a decade, has spun a web of destruction across the
popular tourist islands of the region. Here is an island-by-island
look based on initial damage reports.

   PUERTO RICO: Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon estimated damage at
``hundreds of millions'' of dollars and said the homes of at least
50,000 people were destroyed or damaged in the U.S. commonwealth
with a population of 3.3 million. By Tuesday, 92 percent of the
island had telephone service and 75 percent electricity, the
governor said. He said 60 percent of the island remained without
water and that fully restoring water could take a few days. Some
2,500 National Guardsmen were aiding the cleanup and trying to stop
widespread looting. The Pentagon said some of its facilities,
including U.S. Naval Station at Roosevelts Roads in Puerto Rico,
were heavily damaged.

   GUADELOUPE: Five people reported killed, 84 injured and more than
15,000 homeless on the French island of 340,000 people. Roofs were
torn off, power lines downed and crops damaged. France's Defense
Ministry assigned 3,000 soldiers, two military transport aircraft
and four cargo vessels to assist in restoring communications and
emergency services to the French territory.

   ANTIGUA: Two people killed and widespread wind and rain damage
reported. Island hotels reported water and wind damage.

   MONTSERRAT: Nine people were killed and hundreds of buildings
were flattened on the British island. The British government said
nearly all of the 12,000 island residents were homeless. Royal Navy
marines landed on Montserrat to help clear the airport runway so
planes could deliver supplies. British Overseas Aid Minister Lynda
Chalker said Britain would provide $1.57 million in emergency aid to
British islands struck by the hurricane.

   ST. KITTS: Houses damaged and trees toppled but no reports of
casualties. Communications nearly severed across the island.

   U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS: Popular tourist islands of St. Croix and St.
Thomas hard hit. Widespread looting reported, including raids by
machete-wielding gangs. Ham radio operators in New York were told by
contacts in St. Croix that prisoners had escaped from a jail and
were roaming free and that some National Guardsman and policemen
were joining in the looting. Ham radio operators also reported that
97 percent of the buildings were damaged or destroyed on St. Croix,
which has a population of 53,000. Sailboats were blown out of the
water and thrown up to 150 feet on shore in St. Thomas. Some
waterfront businesses disappeared.

   BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS: Trees uprooted and power and
communications knocked out. On the resort island of Tortola,
residents said there were numerous injuries and scores of homes
destroyed. Inns reported widespread damages.

   THE BAHAMAS: Islanders boarded up homes and stocked up on
supplies as Hugo moved westward. Weather officials said the
hurricane would begin affecting the British colony of Turks and
Caicos Islands southeast of the Bahamas chain Tuesday night. The
storm was moving on a parallel course east of the Bahamas.

   UNITED STATES: Forecasters said it was likely Hugo would hit the
U.S. mainland later in the week, but it was too early to predict
where. Forecasters said U.S. residents from the Florida Keys to
North Carolina should watch Hugo's path carefully.
