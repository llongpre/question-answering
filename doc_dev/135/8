   Tropical Storm Iris gathered 50 mph winds in the
wake of Hurricane Hugo on Monday and forecasters warned residents on
the already battered Leeward Islands to keep a close watch on its
progress.
   At 6 p.m. EDT Monday, a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft
and satellite pictures located the center of the tropical storm near
16.5 north latitude and 56.5 west longitude, or about 300 miles east
of the Leeward Islands, a group of islands in the Lesser Antilles of
the West Indies.
   The governments of Barbados, St. Vincent and St. Lucia issued
warnings for Iris, the ninth named storm of this Atlantic hurricane
season.
   Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables said
Iris was moving toward the north-northwest at about 18 mph.
   Swirling weather patterns left behind by Hugo made further
strengthening unlikely through Tuesday evening, said hurricane
specialist Gil Clark. Iris was expected to hold its course at a
slightly slower pace during that time.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their top
sustained winds reach 39 mph. Iris became a storm Sunday.
