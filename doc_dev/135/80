   The Rev. Jesse
Jackson arrived in the Virgin Islands on Thursday and criticized
the Bush administration for its slow response to the U.S.
territory's needs following the devastation caused by Hurricane
Hugo.
   Jackson, accompanied by the territory's Health Commissioner,
Alfred Heath, toured St. Thomas in Gov. Alexander Farrelly's
limousine and briefly spoke with residents of the popular tourist
resort.
   Jackson on Friday is to visit the sister island of St. Croix,
where Farrelly said the storm caused $500 million in damage and
destroyed most of the island's buildings.
   ``The (federal) government was not prepared. Recovery is slow,
there's no plans for rebuilding,'' Jackson said.
   Bush sent about 1,100 military policemen to St. Croix on Sept.
21 to prevent looting, three days after most stores on the island
of 55,000 people had been looted. Relief supplies began arriving
from the United States on Saturday, a week after Hugo struck.
   Hugo, which whipped across the northeastern Caribbean first
before heading north and west to the United States, left at least
33 people dead on the islands of Montserrat, Antigua, Guadeloupe
and Puerto Rico.
   On St. Thomas, most of the power and water was cut and many
building roofs were blown off, but damage was minimal compared to
St. Croix.
   Later Friday, Jackson is also scheduled to visit the neighboring
U.S. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, where Hugo caused widespread
destruction, leaving an estimated 53,000 people homeless and $200
million in damage.
   Officials in Puerto Rico said that on Thursday, 78 percent of
the island was receiving water and that power would be restored to
all of metropolitan San Juan by Sunday, two weeks after Hugo swept
across the island with 125 mph winds.
