   Hurricane Gustav's winds hit 105 mph early today as
the storm headed for the Caribbean, and warnings were posted in the
West Indies.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Gustav, which reached hurricane strength on
Sunday, was about 205 miles east of Guadeloupe. It was moving
northwest at nearly 9 mph and was expected to maintain that course
and speed for the next 24 hours, foecasters said.
   Gustav was on a path that would skirt the Leeward Islands, and
hurricane forecasters said the island residents were likely to feel
its effects.
   ``It would be close enough that they need to watch it. They
would be on the fringes,'' said Mark Zimmer, a specialist at the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables. ``Conditions
are favorable for further strengthening.''
   The islands of Guadeloupe, Antigua, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis
and St. Kitts issued hurricane warnings late Sunday. A hurricane
watch was in effect for St. Martin, Anguilla and surrounding
islands but dropped today for Dominica and Martinique.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Hortense trailed Gustav about a
thousand miles to the east in the mid-Atlantic, an immediate danger
only to shipping.
   Hortense, the eighth named storm of the Atlantic season, had
winds of 45 mph at 6 a.m. today and was not expected to gain
strength today. It was moving north at about 5 mph.
   Gustav and Hortense were born as tropical depressions near the
Cape Verde islands off West Africa. Such storms have been among
history's worst.
   Tropical depressions become tropical storms when their sustained
winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74 mph.
