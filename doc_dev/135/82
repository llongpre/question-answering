   Tropical Storm Dean developed into a hurricane with
winds of 78 mph today as it surged westward toward the Caribbean.
   At noon EDT, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season was
centered near 17.5 degrees north latitude and 59.5 degrees west
longitude, or 425 miles east of San Juan, Puerto Rico, rushing
westward across the Atlantic at 20 mph.
   Hurricane warnings were posted for the Lesser Antilles from
Guadeloupe to the U.S. Virgin Islands, said the National Hurricane
Center in Coral Gables. A hurricane watch was in effect for Puerto
Rico, Dominica and Martinique.
   ``It's very warm water. There's not anything in the atmosphere
to cause it to break up, so basically it looks good for further
development,'' said meteorologist Jesse Moore. ``Right now, it's
away from any land area, but it could affect the easternmost
islands of the Lesser Antilles within the next 6 to 12 hours.''
   Rainfall of 5-10 inches and tides 3 to 5 feet above normal were
possible.
   South Florida could be in danger in three or four days from
Dean, which is called a Cape Verde storm because it formed off the
west coast of Africa.
   ``When we see a hurricane like that we realize that it has the
potential to move all the way across the Atlantic and threaten the
southeastern United States,'' said hurricane center forecaster
Miles Lawrence.
   Chantal, the first hurricane of the season, was downgraded to a
tropical depression Tuesday night after hitting Texas near High
Island, midway between Galveston and Port Arthur. It was blamed for
at least two deaths.
   Dean began Monday as the fifth tropical depression of the
season. It became a named storm Monday night when its winds reached
39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes when their top sustained
winds hit 74 mph.
   Three other depressions have grown into named storms since the
season began June 1.
