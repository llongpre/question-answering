   Tropical Storm Jerry picked up strength and shifted
a bit westward Sunday, and forecasters said the storm's center
should make landfall in Texas or Louisiana by early Monday and
could bring dangerous flooding and near-hurricane-force wind.
   Storm watches were posted from Morgan City, La., on the central
Louisiana coast, westward to Port O'Connor, Texas, on the central
Texas coast. Watches east of Morgan City were withdrawn. Earlier,
the storm watch had covered most of the Lousiana coast but only
small parts of Texas.
   Storm winds were clocked at 65 mph this morning, up from 60 mph
overnight.
   ``Some slight increase in strength is likely before landfall,
possibly bringing the winds to near hurricane force,'' Bb Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables,
said in an advisory.
   Tropical storms become hurricanes when sustained winds reach 74
mph.
   A storm warning was expected to be issued later Sunday for part
of the watch area, forecasters said.
   They warned of severe coastal flooding because of the
combination of coastal tides, which are expected to reach a peak
this weekend, and the storm's surge.
   ``Astronomical tides are expected to be the highest of the year
this weekend, and in combination with storm-surge water levels this
could produce dangerous coastal flooding, depending on the exact
path of the storm,'' Sheets said.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, the center was located near latitude 27.7 north,
longitude 94.0 west, or about 115 miles south-southeast of
Galveston, Texas. The storm was moving north-northwest at about 10
mph, bringing the center near the upper Texas Coast late Sunday or
early Monday, said Sheets.
