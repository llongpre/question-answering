   Hurricane Dean, packing 85 mph
winds, veered away from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
today on a wobbly course in the Atlantic Ocean, forecasters said.
   The National Weather Service lifted hurricane warnings for all
the islands of the eastern Caribbean, including Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands.
   Forecasters said Dean was moving farther out to sea and that the
worst effects would probably miss the islands.
   The government of the Bahamas had a hurricane watch in effect
for the Turks and Caicos Islands, southeast of the Bahamas.
   A flash-flood watch remained in effect for the Virgin Islands,
but it was lifted for Puerto Rico, where the National Guard earlier
had been preparing to evacuate 2,000 people from flood-prone areas.
   At noon EDT, the hurricane's center was at latitude 19.5 north
and longitude 63.3 west, or 200 miles east-northeast of San Juan.
The weather service in San Juan said if Dean remained on its
current course it would pass 125 miles north of the Virgin Islands
and 150 miles north of Puerto Rico.
   ``The biggest problem in the islands is usually flash floods and
mudslides, so there is some potential for that, but it's not going
to be as if the core of the storm was coming across there,'' said
Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   He said the strom was curving northward, away from land, so
there was no immediate threat to the United States.
   Dean, the second hurricane of the Atlantic season, strengthened
overnight as it moved irregularly in a west-northwest course
through the Leeward Island chain, missing the nearest island,
Barbuda.
   By late Wednesday it began veering northwest, giving many
residents and vacationers hope the hurricane would harmlessly go
out to sea. But just as quickly, the hurricane darted back west and
toward land.
   ``This is dangerous storm and should not be taken lightly even
though it is a minimal hurricane,'' said an advisory from the
National Weather Service in San Juan.
   Police were on alert, and at least 60 American and Canadian
vacationers were evacuated late Wednesay to hotels from a marina
resort on the east coast of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands.
   The National Hurricane Center near Miami posted hurricane
warnings on Wednesday for the Leeward Islands from Antigua to the
U.S. Virgin Islands, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.
   A Weather Service advisory issued in San Juan for the U.S.
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico advised residents to ``secure loose
objects or move them indoors,'' board or tape windows and stock up
on emergency supplies such as drinking water, food that needs no
refrigeration and batteries.
   In San Juan, a city of 1.1 million people, shoppers on Wednesday
formed long lines in supermarkets, workers boarded up windows of
the governor's mansion and stores in the tourist district of Old
San Juan.
   In the eastern Puerto Rican city of Humacao, Mayor Ramon Vega
Sosa said he asked Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon to mobilize the
National Guard to evacuate 1,966 residents who live along a highway
that runs along the coastline, which is five feet from the sea.
   Dean grew from the fifth tropical depression of the season
Monday morning into a named storm by Monday night.
   Three other storms have formed since the season began June 1.
   Tropical Storm Allison caused widespread flooding in Texas and
Louisiana in June. Barry churned up the open Atlantic last month
before dissipating.
   Chantal became a hurricane Monday and was downgraded to a
tropical depression Tuesday night after hitting land in Texas.
