   Cooperation among Latin, Caribbean and U.S.
officials _ even those at odds politically _ kept the loss of life
to ``probably one-tenth'' of what it might have been during this
year's hurricane season, the nation's chief hurricane forecaster
says.
   The six-month Atlantic hurricane season, which officially ends
Wednesday, produced 11 named storms and six hurricanes, including
the record-breaking Gilbert, and Tropical Storm Keith, which blew
across Florida last week but caused little damage except beach
erosion and minor flooding. Forecasters called it an average storm
season.
   There were 505 deaths recorded this year, but in the past, major
hurricanes have killed thousands when they hit Latin and Caribbean
nations where many houses are unable to stand up to hurricane winds
and flooding, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane
Center in nearby Coral Gables.
   ``I'm pleased to say I think everything went very well,'' Sheets
said. ``Even with the destruction we're talking about, loss of life
was relatively small. The governments, I think, did an excellent job
in getting their people prepared.''
   During the rise of Hurricane Joan last month, for example, the
center was in constant contact with the Nicaraguan Embassy in
Washington and the Colombian meteorological service, Sheets said.
Forecasters spoke regularly with concerned parties in Panama and
Costa Rica.
   During Joan, Sheets said, Costa Rican President Oscar Arias
``himself called four times here to this office.'' A week after the
storm, he sent his vice president to visit and thank employees for
their help.
   ``I know there are political differences that exist between the
U.S., Nicaragua and Cuba,'' Sheets said, ``but those differences
aren't felt in the meteorological community.''
   The sharing of information helped governments order evacuations
and take necessary precautions, Sheets said.
   Sheets recalled that Hurricane Fifi, a 1974 storm that struck
Honduras, killed 8,000 people. By contrast, 184 people died as a
result of Hurricane Joan's encounter with Central America.
   Hal Gerrish, another hurricane center forecaster, said the
international cooperation has been fostered by workshops the
hurricane center has held, for at least the past six years, for
officials from other nations.
   ``We have a 10-day course in both Spanish and English for the
Caribbean forecasters,'' Gerrish said Saturday. ``Their lead
forecasters will come up for refreshers and to get the latest on
forecasting. This has created a pretty close fraternity among us.''
   This year's season produced a record hurricane, Gilbert. There
was talk of adding a new top rank to the Saffir-Simpson scale, a
sort of Richter scale for hurricanes, just to accommodate it, Sheets
said.
   He added that Gilbert will probably be recorded as one of the
costliest storms ever. Gil Clark of the hurricane center said
figures are still preliminary, but he estimated the September storm
did $1 billion to $2 billion worth of damage, primarily in Jamaica
and Mexico.
   Sheets noted that Gilbert ``was the lowest pressure ever recorded
in this hemisphere.'' As a rule, the lower a hurricane's barometric
pressure, the stronger its winds. Gilbert registered sustained winds
as high as 175 mph.
   Sheets compared Gilbert to the 1935 hurricane that hit the
Florida Keys, killing more than 400 people. Its winds were clocked
at up to 200 mph; its pressure was the lowest recorded in the
hemisphere before Gilbert.
   Gilbert also ``was one of the largest hurricanes we've ever
seen,'' Sheets said.
   The storm's eye measured 8 miles across. At one point, he said,
Gilbert stretched across the Florida Keys, Cuba, the Florida
Straits, all of the western Caribbean and part of the Gulf of
Mexico. It killed more than 300 people and did significant damage in
Mexico, Jamaica, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.
   While Gilbert was ranked a 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, the
scale's top rank, Joan rated a 4.
   Sheets said that in the century the service has kept records,
there has been no mention of a Category 4 storm in Central America.
   Joan menaced Central America for days before blasting it with top
winds of 135 mph, causing mudslides, floods and other damage in
Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Colombia and Panama.
   Even after crossing land, Joan had sufficient strength to be
renamed Miriam as a Pacific storm.
   There are a lot of mysteries associated with hurricanes, and the
season's two biggest storms, which followed unusual paths for major
hurricanes, only added to them.
   ``As far as understanding why we have a Gilbert or a Joan, indeed
we know what are the necessary conditions, but we don't know what
the trigger mechanisms are,'' Sheets said.
