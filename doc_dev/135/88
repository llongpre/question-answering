   Seven of Hurricane Hugo's nine victims in Puerto
Rico died in the storm's aftermath, while 13 of Hugo's 29 victims
in South Carolina died at the peak of its impact, federal
researchers found.
   But the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said Thursday residents
of both places largely avoided the most common killer historically
from hurricanes: the storm surge, a wall of water that builds up
ahead of the storm's intense low pressure.
   The agency, reviewing reports by officials in 25 South Carolina
counties, said only one person died when Hugo's 17-foot storm surge
swept the South Carolina coast on Sept. 21-22 _ a 60-year-old woman
in her mobile home.
   No storm-surge deaths were reported when Hugo lashed Puerto Rico
three days earlier.
   In Puerto Rico, most of the Hugo-related deaths were
electrocutions among repair workers after the storm.
   In South Carolina, besides the woman killed in the storm surge,
five people drowned while trying to bring boats inland at
Charleston, four were crushed in mobile homes, two were killed by
falling trees and one died in a house collapse.
   After the storm, nine people in South Carolina were killed in
five separate house fires blamed on the use of candles during power
outages. Another four people were electrocuted during cleanup and
repair work, two were killed by falling trees and one died in a
chain saw accident.
   Because of the South Carolina deaths, the CDC on Thursday
recommended more efforts to educate the public in hurricane areas
about the hazards of candles, the need to evacuate mobile homes and
the hazards of boating during the approach of a hurricane.
