   Tropical Storm Karen has dissipated after a cold
front moved into the northwest Caribbean, forecasters said today.
   Miles Lawrence of the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables said a hurricane reconnaissance flight found that the
storm had weakened.
   Over the weekend, Karen lingered off the coast of Central
America with 40 mph winds, barely tropical-storm strength.
   The system surprised forecasters by building to tropical-storm
strength Thursday, the final day of the six-month Atlantic
hurricane season. On Friday, top winds reached 55 mph.
   The hurricane season officially runs from June 1 to Nov. 30, but
hurricanes have been recorded in every month except April.
