   Forecasters today said deadly Hurricane Hugo could
hit anywhere from Florida to North Carolina this weekend _ or spin
harmlessly away in the Atlantic.
   ``It's a long way from any potential landfall,'' said Bob Sheets,
director of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
``Unfortunately, the higher likelihood is that it will turn more
west and could make landfall anywhere from South Florida to North
Carolina.''
   Sheets added, though, that it's also possible the hurricane could
skirt the United States entirely.
   Forecasters today watched data spit out of computers, studied
satellite maps and reconnaissance photos flown back on Air Force
``hurricane hunter'' planes, and even pulled out old hurricane
charts to see what storms similar to Hugo have done.
   The data laid out conflicting futures for Hugo, Sheets said.
   ``We were just looking through a bunch of the old charts,'' he
said. ``They've done everything. They've done loopity-loops, they've
gone into South Florida, they've gone into central Florida, all the
way up to the Carolinas.''
   The main area of agreement on the computer models, Sheets said,
was that Hugo is likely to change from the north-northwest course it
followed overnight after pounding Puerto Rico.
   ``Now the question is when is it going to turn more
west-northwest,'' Sheets said. ``There's just not any way to say.''
   Hurricanes are propelled by prevailing winds generated by other
weather systems.
   The most likely impact on Hugo will be a ``Bermuda High,'' a
high-pressure system building to Hugo's northeast, forecasters said.
That system would tend to keep Hugo from veering from the East Coast.
