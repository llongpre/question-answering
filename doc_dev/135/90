   In South Carolina, unlike Puerto Rico, much of
the death brought by Hurricane Hugo came at the peak of the storm's
impact, a U.S. government report concluded Thursday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control looked at 29 injury
deaths associated with Hurricane Hugo, as reported by officials in
25 South Carolina counties. Thirteen of those deaths, the CDC said,
occurred during the ``impact phase'' of the storm's assault on the
state Sept. 21-22.
   The pattern was different in Puerto Rico, where the storm struck
days earlier. There, only two of nine deaths occurred during the
storm's impact; most of the deaths were electrocutions among repair
workers after the storm.
   The CDC said, however, that in both Puerto Rico and South
Carolina, the historical hurricane pattern of death by drowning in
storm surges did not hold. The CDC reported just one storm-surge
drowning in South Carolina, a 60-year-old woman who died in her
mobile home.
   Five other people drowned while trying to bring boats inland at
Charleston.
   The other impact-phase deaths in South Carolina included four
people crushed in mobile homes, one person killed in the collapse
of a house and two killed by falling trees.
   Most of the 16 injury deaths after the storm involved nine
people who were killed in five separate house fires. The fires were
blamed on the use of candles during power outages.
   Four people were electrocuted during clean-up and repair work,
two people were killed by falling trees and one died in a chain-saw
mishap.
   With the South Carolina deaths in mind, the CDC on Thursday
recommended more efforts to educate the public in hurricane areas
about the hazards of candles, the need to evacuate mobile homes and
the hazards of boating during the approach of a killer storm.
   After the deaths in Puerto Rico, the CDC last month recommended
greater precautions for electrical workers repairing hurricane
damage.
