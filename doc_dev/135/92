   Millions more Americans are exposed to
hurricanes as the population grows in the Southeast and Gulf
states, and meteorologists worry that these new residents may
underestimate the dangers they could face.
   The entire region from Texas to North Carolina has experienced
sharp growth in recent years _ a period that has averaged
relatively few hurricanes.
   That means many coastal residents have never experienced a major
storm.
   Emergency management officials say they fear that when a major
storm does threaten, people will underestimate the danger and delay
evacuation or fail to leave at all.
   ``We are more vulnerable to hurricanes in the United States now
than we have ever been in our history,'' said the American
Meteorological Society in a special statement of concern adopted a
couple of years ago.
   ``It is imperative that coastal residents and visitors alike
take the threat seriously, acquaint themselves with hurricane
safety rules, and evacuate immediately if advised to do so,'' said
Robert Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla.
   As it is, the population in many regions _ such as the New
Orleans area _ now exceeds the number that could be safely
evacuated in the time available, officials said.
   ``Some evacuation times for high-density coastal populations are
much larger than the amount of time that we can reasonably give a
decent warning,'' said meteorologist Miles Lawrence of the
Hurricane Center.
   Florida's Atlantic coast tops the region with 2,075 people per
shoreline mile, up from 824 per mile in 1960, according to a new
study from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
   About one-third of the residents in the Southeast region _ from
Texas to North Carolina _ are considered coastal in the NOAA study,
including the entire population of Florida.
   June 1 marks the official start of hurricane season for the
Southeast, and the danger period extends to autumn.
   ``Overall, there have been less hurricanes in the last 20 years
than prior to that,'' noted Lawrence, adding that ``southeast
Florida has not had a direct hit by a Category 3 or higher (storm)
since 1965.''
   Strong storms have struck in recent years in South Carolina and
Texas, however, he said. Hurricanes are graded on a scale of 1 to
5, with 5 the strongest.
   Last year's Hurricane Hugo killed 29 people and did an estimated
$5.9 billion in damage in South Carolina. The storm also inflicted
serious damage on adjacent states as well as the Virgin Islands and
Puerto Rico. Advance warning, however, allowed people to be
evacuated from many coastal islands and low-lying regions.
   While Hugo is reportedly the most expensive hurricane in U.S.
history, it is far from the deadliest. That occurred in 1900 when a
storm arriving with little warning drove a wall of water over
Galveston, Texas, killing an estimated 6,000 people.
   While Florida's East Coast is the most densely populated area
where hurricanes post the greatest threat, all areas seem to be
growing rapidly.
   Texas' coastal counties average 1,517 people per shore mile, up
from 798 in 1960. Third is Florida's west coast, where the coastal
population has risen from 433 per mile in 1960 to 1,064 currently,
according to NOAA.
   Here is a rundown of the population in coastal states most
threatened by hurricanes. It includes the percentage of the state's
population considered coastal and the estimated number of people
per shoreline mile in 1988 compared with 1960 and the projected
population in the year 2010.
   _Florida (East Coast), 100 percent coastal; 2,075 people per
shoreline mile, up from 824 in 1960, headed for 2,689 in 2010.
   _Florida (Gulf Coast), 100 percent coastal; 1,064 per mile; up
from 433, headed for 1,411.
   _Texas, 31 percent coastal; 1,517 per shoreline mile, up from
798, headed for 1,956.
   _Mississippi, 13 percent coastal; 928 per mile, up from 527,
headed for 1,102.
   _Alabama, 12 percent coastal; 800 per mile, up from 599, headed
for 886.
   _Louisiana, 62 percent coastal; 352 per mile, up from 248,
headed for 420.
   _South Carolina, 25 percent coastal, 303 per mile, up from 176,
headed for 365.
   _North Carolina, 11 percent coastal, 202 per mile, up from 140,
headed for 234.
   _Georgia, 6 percent coastal, 158 per mile, up from 114, headed
for 179.
