   Hurricane Gabrielle, which built quickly from a
tropical storm, churned Friday across the Atlantic toward the
Caribbean.
   ``It was a little faster than anticipated,'' hurricane specialist
Jim Gross, of the National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral
Gables, said after Gabrielle's quick rise to hurricane status.
   Gabrielle is the fourth storm to reach hurricane status in the
Atlantic season, which began June 1. It formed Thursday in the
eastern Atlantic.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Gabrielle was centered near 13.5 north
latitude and 39.5 west longitude, or about 1,425 miles east of the
Lesser Antilles, moving slightly west northwest at 20 mph.
   The hurricane, which strengthened as it pushed away from the
African coast, had maximum sustained winds of about 75 mph with
higher gusts in squalls, forecasters said. There was little
strengthening Friday, but forecaster Gil Clark said Gabrielle could
get stronger as it moved into tropical waters.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Felix was expected to weaken again as
it drifted northward in the central North Atlantic.
   Its winds, which had dropped to 35 mph, below the 39 mph
threshold for a named storm Wednesday, picked up to 40 mph on
Thursday but were likely to drop back later Friday, forecasters said.
   At 10:30 p.m., Felix was near 34.2 north latitude and 41.2 west
longitude, or about 650 miles southwest of the westernmost Azores
moving to the north at 5 to 10 mph. The depression was expected to
continue on this course Friday with a gradual turn to the northwest
on Saturday.
   Neither storm is an immediate threat to land, forecasters said.
