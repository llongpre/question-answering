   Although damage estimates in the wake of
Hurricane Hugo were hiked upward to more than $4 billion, the
return of carriage rides and parking tickets are signs that
historic Charleston is trying to get back to normal.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said the city had made an ``absolutely
remarkable'' recovery in two weeks since the hurricane lashed the
city with its 135 mph winds.
   ``The city is open, the curfew is over and we invite the people
of the state and the country to come to Charleston,'' Riley said.
But he noted that the recovery will take longer for those who lost
homes, possessions or jobs in the hurricane.
   Horse-drawn carriages were to be back on the streets this
weekend and the city will start ticketing parking violators on
Monday, the mayor said.
   Meanwhile, the Ben Sawyer Bridge _ the only link between the
mainland and the Isle of Palms and Sullivans Island about 10 miles
north of Charleston _ is back in place, said Carol Todd,
spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers.
   She said the corps finished its work about 2 a.m. today, but
that she does not know when the swing bridge will open to traffic.
Officials from the state Highway Department were inspecting the
bridge this morning, she said.
   The bridge _ one end of which was submerged in the Intracoastal
Waterway by Hugo's winds _ was lifted onto barges Wednesday. But a
broken cable prevented the barges from positioning the bridge back
on the road before today.
   Hugo hit the coast Sept. 21, leaving at least 18 dead in South
Carolina, and damaging and destroying homes, businesses, schools
and municipal buildings. In all, 29 people were killed on the U.S.
mainland and at least 33 in the Caribbean.
   Gov. Carroll Campbell said Thursday that damage from the storm
was revised upward to $4 billion to $5 billion. Previous estimates
had been closer to $3 billion.
   State and local governments would pick up about 25 percent of
the $200 million cleanup cost with the federal government covering
the rest.
   The state highway commission suggested a 1-cent increase in the
gasoline tax to help pay for the cleanup, but Campbell said he
would first shift funds from other programs before increasing taxes.
   Riley, who had asked Campbell to request Army troops to help
clear debris, said Thursday he wrote to President Bush himself when
the governor rejected the idea.
   In a letter to Campbell, Riley and two other mayors said the
state has been inundated with as much debris as one might expect to
collect over 50 years. They said private contractors could not meet
the cleanup demand and local governments couldn't afford to pay
them.
   But Campbell said the cities can still contract with private
contractors and would have to pay 12 percent of the cost.
   Also Thursday, National Hurricane Center Director Bob Sheets
said damage from the storm could have been halved had coastal
structures been built to the tougher hurricane building codes of
south Florida.
   ``The extent of the damage is far more widespread than I've seen
from any previous hurricane,'' said Sheets, in the state to tour
storm damage.
   Workers used bulldozers to rebuild dunes along beaches scarred
by the hurricane. Private contractors were supported by 550 Army
troops and Marines using 100 dump trucks to haul sand to build up
eight miles of beach in Myrtle Beach.
   Tides at least 2 feet above normal are expected along the coast
from Oct. 14-18 caused by the moon coming unusually close to the
Earth, said Ms. Todd.
   Campbell hopes to have 65 miles of dunes rebuilt along the
state's northern coastline before the high tides hit.
