   On the hurricane-battered
island of Vieques, a practice site for U.S. Navy bombing off Puerto
Rico, residents link their destiny to a century-old tamarind tree
on a barren hill.
   ``If the tree survives, so will Vieques,'' said engineer Sixto
Perez after a ceremony to replant the tree, which was uprooted by
Hurricane Hugo on Sept. 18.
   ``It has been silent witness to our history,'' Nana Ortiz de
Castano, a retired teacher, told schoolchildren gathered around the
tree.
   The U.S. Navy has been part of Vieques' history since World War
II.
   It owns two-thirds of the island and uses it for practice
bombings and maneuvers. In the 1970s, Vieques was rocked by violent
anti-Navy protests. Similar demonstrations in 1975 drove the Navy
off its sister island, Culebra. Although the Navy says relations
have improved in recent years, many Viequenses, as the 8,000
residents are called, say Hurricane Hugo has made matters worse.
Vieques was one of the areas hardest hit by the storm.
   Hugo pounded Vieques for 12 hours with winds clocked at 140 to
200 mph, demolishing or damaging virtually all its 3,000 homes.
Trees were either knocked downed or defoliated, leaving the
once-verdant, sun-splashed island with little shade.
   ``It will take 10 years to recover,'' said Luiz Davila, manager
of a General Electric plant that makes electric switches and is the
island's largest employer, with 132 workers.
   ``Now we are seeing the devastation,'' Davila added. ``In six
months, a year, we will see the lack of income people will have.''
   With their homes and possessions gone and their future
livelihood in doubt, some residents despair. Officials say two
people hanged themselves and several others attempted suicide after
the storm. No one in Vieques died in the hurricane itself.
   ``There is lot of depression, a lot of suicide attempts,'' said
Dr. Eva Almodovar, who is in charge of the emergency room at the
Vieques Hospital. ``It's people who have lost everything. ... They
don't see a way out.''
   The Navy is helping rebuild roads and restore power and water.
   The day after the hurricane, the Navy put up a roadblock to
prevent squatters from returning to a disputed area where they had
set up shacks and burned two Navy vehicles in April.
   Robert Ravin, a high school history teacher, charged that the
Navy acted ``like thieves in the night,'' taking advantage of the
hurricane crisis.
   But a Navy spokesman, Lt. Richard Boyle, said the roadblock was
put up because the squatters were ``unauthorized people on Navy
property. The shacks had been blown down and were completely
demolished.''
   The Navy bought Vieques land for training during World War II,
resettling residents in the center of the island, which is 20 miles
long and six miles across. Most of the Navy property is unused and
hundreds of squatters have moved in over the past year.
   Rear Adm. John A. Moriarty, commander of Caribbean naval forces,
said relations with Vieques residents have been ``very, very good.''
   But squatter organizer Antonio Figueroa, a carpenter who says
his movement is ``rescuing land,'' believes the Navy ``has a master
plan'' to stifle development to keep the island to itself.
   Many Viequenses complain that the Navy's presence has kept the
island underdeveloped, underpopulated and poverty-stricken.
   Vieques has a severe housing shortage, an unemployment rate of
70 percent, and an annual per capita income of $5,281, as opposed
to the Puerto Rico average of $8,721. The majority of the islanders
are on welfare.
   Although its unspoiled beauty has made it the location for
several movies, most recently ``Heartbreak Ridge,'' with Clint
Eastwood about the 1983 U.S.-led invasion of Grenada, Vieques has
seen little tourism.
   ``The Navy occupies two-thirds of the island and this prevents
it from developing to its plenitude because they own the best
beaches, the best land,'' said Mayor Manuela Santiago Collazo.
   Vieques has been losing population for years, and is expected to
lose 2,000 of its 8,000 inhabitants by the year 2000.
   ``A young Viequense who becomes an engineer, a doctor or a
lawyer can't come back because there is nothing to do here,'' said
Figueroa.
