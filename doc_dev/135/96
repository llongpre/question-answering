   While cooler mid-Atlantic waters continue to sap
Hurricane Erin's strength today, forecasters say it's too early to
waive caution.
   They note a similar storm in 1987 traveled northward to lash
Great Britain, causing substantial damage.
   The National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables predicts
Erin is heading somewhere between Greenland and Ireland.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT on Friday, Erin's center was located near 43.0
north latitude and 35.4 west longitude, or about 310 miles west
northwest of the westernmost Azores. The system was moving northeast
at about 25 mph and was expected to weaken gradually over the next
24 hours.
   The storm, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, will probably
lose its tropical characteristics over the North Atlantic, but could
cause damage if it makes landfall, Kimberlain said.
   Erin was spawned off the African coast and became a named storm
Sunday night when sustained winds reached 39 mph. It reached the 74
mph threshold for a hurricane Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, forecasters report the eighth tropical depression of
the year formed late Friday off the African coast.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, the depression was located at 16.9 north
latitude and 21.5 west longitude, or about 100 miles east of the
easternmost Cape Verde islands. The depression, with maximum
sustained winds of 35 mph, was moving westward at about 17 mph with
some stregthening expected.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Erin
is the fifth named storm and the third hurricane of the year.
