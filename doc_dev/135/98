   Here is a summary of developments Friday associated with
Hurricane Hugo:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DISASTER DECLARED</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush declared seven counties of South Carolina a
disaster area, making the state eligible for federal loans for
rebuilding, repairs, and restoration of utilities.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ELEVEN DEATHS REPORTED</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Ten deaths were reported in South Carolina, eight of them in
counties surrounding Charleston and one near Columbia, S.C., and one
person died in North Carolina.
   Earlier, at least 20 people, and as many as 26, died as the storm
surged across the Caribbean.

<NOTE>THE STORM</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Hugo was downgraded to a tropical storm at 6 a.m. Friday. By 6
p.m., Hugo had all but lost the characteristics of a tropical storm
and was weakening, although the weather system featured maximum
sustained winds of 40 mph and torrential rains. Its last location
was in Pennsylvania, just west of Pittsburgh, at latitude 40.5
degrees north and longitude 81 degrees west. Officials said no
further tracking would be done.
   The storm was expected to wear out in Canada.
   Threats of severe flooding were eased because the storm was
moving faster than expected.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LANDFALL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The center of the storm made landfall about midnight Thursday
over the Isle of Palms, just east of Charleston. S.C.
   The hurricane passed through Charleston with winds of 135 mph and
gusts even higher. Flooding was worsened since the impact, carrying
a wall of water 12 to 17 feet high, coincided with high tide at 2:13
a.m.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DAMAGE and FLOODING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Thirty buildings in downtown Charleston, S.C., were flattened,
houses collapsed all over the city, and several people were trapped
beneath a collapsed condominium complex. Fires erupted from natural
gas leaks.
   Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. estimated damage at $1 billion.
   Elsewhere along the coast, Garden City Beach, S.C., a small
vacation community south of Myrtle Beach, was largely leveled. At
least 14 houses on Pawleys Island were washed away. Three piers
disappeared in North Myrtle Beach, Cherry Grove, and Garden City
Beach.
   In Charlotte, N.C., 200 miles inland, power was out in 85 percent
of the city, and downed trees blocked roadways and damaged homes.
High winds, clocked at up to 75 mph, felled a 1,000-foot television
transmission tower and broke windows in a 42-story downtown office
building.
   At least 900,000 customers in the Carolinas were without
electrical power Friday.
   As the storm moved northward, coastal areas were largely spared
but inland flooding was reported.

<NOTE>LAW ENFORCEMENT</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell said more than 3,000
National Guardsmen and law enforcement officials were on duty.
   Campbell said there had been looting in the Surfside Beach and
Garden City area, but the National Guard had quickly secured the
area.
   Charleston Mayor Riley ordered a curfew from 6 p.m. until 7 a.m.
every night until the damage is cleaned up.
   About 175 Guardsmen were deployed in North Carolina to assist
local authorities. The state ordered evacuation of 90 prisoners at
Yancey Correctional Center at Burnsville as a precaution because of
rapidly rising waters in the Cana River.

<NOTE>CARIBBEAN</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   On St. Croix, Virgin Islands, officials said patrolling U.S.
troops sent to restore order had curbed rampant looting.
   The Marine Radio Band said Thursday that two looters were shot in
St. Croix, but there was no independent confirmation.
   In Washington, the Interior Department said it will staff phones
24 hours for people concerned about relatives in the Virgin Islands.
The number is 202-343-6816.
