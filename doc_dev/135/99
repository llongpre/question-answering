<LEADPARA>  Hurricane Bob, packing winds near 75 mph, threatened to strike the Outer Banks
of North Carolina today, and some residents and vacationers, spurred by
memories of 1989's Hurricane Hugo and warnings from forecasters, scurried to
leave the coast. The hurricane was expected to move north-northwest, take a
turn to the north and skirt the North Carolina coast, and then continue north,
said Bob Ebargh, a forecaster with the National Hurricane Center in Coral
Gables, Fla. Traffic was heavy late Saturday out of the Outer Banks, a series
of narrow islands running along the northern half of North Carolina's coast.
The area is a popular weekend spot for beachgoers and sport fishermen.;   
State officials recommended that people cancel plans to visit the area today,
and the National Park Service closed its campgrounds on the Outer Banks. "With
the unpredictable nature of this storm, it is better to be safe than sorry,"
said Joe Myers, state emergency management director.  </LEADPARA>
