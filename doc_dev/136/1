   The heirs of an American soldier accused of
pilfering medieval art treasures from a German church during World
War II have given the trove to a Dallas museum for safekeeping
while their ownership is settled.
   The Quedlinburg treasures will not be displayed publicly at the
Dallas Museum of Art until the ownership is decided by a U.S.
District Court judge, museum director Richard R. Brettell said
Thursday.
   Brettell said professionals and scholars might be allowed to see
the treasures if the court and both sides in the lawsuit agree. The
public likely will get to see the art once ownership is clear.
   ``Each party was interested in eventually displaying the art for
the people in Texas,'' Brettell said.
   The pieces will be moved from rural Whitewright, about 60 miles
north of Dallas, to the downtown museum within a week, he said.
   The Lutheran Stiftskirche-Domgemeinde church of Quedlinburg
claims that Joe T. Meador stole the trove while his U.S. Army unit
was guarding a mine shaft where the items had been hidden.
   Attorneys for Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, the brother and
sister of the soldier, have been negotiating with the church to
have the treasures kept in a neutral place while they haggle over
ownership.
   Meador, who died in 1980, bequeathed the artwork to his
siblings. The heirs claim to have several, but not all, of the 14
treasures sought by the church. The treasures include a 9th- or
10th-century wood reliquary, a container; a jeweled ivory-and-gold
comb; a Byzantine rock crystal flask; four small reliquaries in the
form of turrets, and a small heart-shaped reliquary.
   Two jeweled medieval manuscripts believed held by the Meadors
for several years were sold recently on the European art market.
   Brettell said he did not know how many objects the museum would
receive. He said they included gold, silver, ivory and crystal
articles from the 8th to 14th centuries.
   ``The Quedlinburg treasury is undoubtedly the most important
Carolingian treasury of the Germanies,'' he said. ``The objects
were made for important kings. They were in a repository which was
among the three or four greatest medieval repositories.''
   The Carolingian period refers to the reign of emperor
Charlemagne and his successors in the 8th through early 10th
centuries.
   Brettel refused to assign a value to the treasures.
   ``Important Carolingian objects have not traded hands on the
open market for the last generation and therefore it's impossible
to give a real and correct evaluation,'' he said.
