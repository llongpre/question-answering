   A U.S. soldier accused of smuggling medieval
treasures out of Germany near the end of World War II confided to a
longtime friend that he took the trove, a newspaper reported today.
   For years before his death in 1980, Joe T. Meador was torn over
whether to keep the artwork or return it, Owen Hunsaker, Meador's
college classmate in the 1930s, told The Dallas Morning News.
   ``When he looked at it he'd get a dreary, transported look on
his face because he knew what he had _ he loved it _ and he
couldn't part with it,'' Hunsaker was quoted as saying.
   ``He struggled with that a lot,'' said Hunsaker, a 71-year-old
retired airline executive who lives in New York.
   Hunsaker said his friend told him he found the treasures in a
cave in 1945 in Quedlinburg, now in East Germany, and had simply
wrapped them in brown paper and used an Army post office to ship
them to his home in Whitewright, 60 miles north of Dallas.
   Hunsaker is the first person to explain how Meador allegedly
discovered the artwork and moved it. Reports about the case first
surfaced in The New York Times two weeks ago.
   The treasures included manuscripts, crucifixes and ancient
coins, which church officials said were gifts to the Quedlinburg
Cathedral from Germany's earliest kings.
   Lawyers for the Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg contend that
Meador stole the treasures while serving as an Army lieutenant
among troops that occupied the area in April 1945.
   Meador left the cache to his brother and sister, Jack Meador and
Jane Meador Cook. They are disputing the church's claim of
ownership and trying to keep the items, which are worth millions.
   The Meador family is asking the church's permission to display
the treasures at the Dallas Museum of Art or the Kimball Art Museum
in Fort Worth while the lawsuit over ownership is pending, the News
reported today.
   ``We have not as yet spoken with either museum,'' the family's
attorney, Randal Mathis, told the newspaper. ``We think that they
would be appropriate places for safekeeping.''
   Hunsaker was in the Pacific during World War II while his friend
fought in Germany. He said that during a visit to Whitewright in
1948, Meador showed him artwork that he said he had wrapped in
brown paper, marked as ``old books'' and deposited in a mailbox at
Army headquarters.
   He said Meador told him that he found the artwork in 1945 in a
cave filled with treasures of gold and silver, and filled his Army
jacket with ``as many treasures as he could hold'' before returning
to his headquarters.
   U.S. Army reports indicate the treasures were removed from a
mine shaft near Quedlinburg within three days after Allied troops
occupied the area in April 1945.
   Hunsaker, the News reported, said Meador did not tell him
whether anyone helped him remove the artwork or whether he returned
to the cave later to get more items.
   He said they sat for hours paging through a manuscript with an
elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels, and highlighted with
a silver figure of Jesus Christ with his hand risen in benediction.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Hunsaker said. ``I knew I was touching
ancient history.''
   Hunsaker said he frequently tried but failed to persuade Meador
to turn over the artwork to authorities.
   ``Joe knew he had a hot potato,'' said Hunsaker. ``He couldn't
let everybody know about it, and he certainly couldn't sell it.''
   Hunsaker said he last talked to Meador a few years before he
died.
