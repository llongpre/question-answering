   A major Soviet-American exchange of eight art
exhibitions over the next five years, tentatively scheduled to
appear in more than a dozen museums across the United States and
Soviet Union, was announced Friday.
   At a news conference in a gilded salon at the Soviet Embassy,
Ambassador Yuri Dubinin said he hoped the new cultural exchange
would give the American people ``a better understanding of our
life, our perestroika ... and our sincere desire to improve
Soviet-American relations.''
   The exchange, arranged by the Soviet Ministry of Culture and
InterCultura, a private, non-profit organization based in Fort
Worth, Texas, will involve tours of four exhibitions of Soviet art
in the United States and four American shows traveling through the
Soviet Union.
   A ninth exhibition, organized jointly by U.S., Soviet and
Canadian institutions, will feature artworks of the Tlingit people,
North American Indians of Alaska and British Columbia and will tour
all three countries in 1994.
   The Soviet exhibitions headed for the United States include:
   _Masterpieces of 19th century Russian paintings from an artistic
group of social activists known as the Wanderers, to premiere at
the Dallas Museum of Art in the summer of 1990 and travel to an
undetermined second American museum.
   _Important avant-garde Russian works from the early 20th
century, many of them never seen in the United States, and examples
of traditional Russian art that inspired those modern artists. The
show will debut at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth in 1991 and
travel to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art the following year.
   _The first major U.S. display of treasures of medieval Russian
ecclesiastical art from the 14th to the 17th centuries, involving
90 to 100 objects from the State Russian Museum in Leningrad. The
exhibition will be seen at the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore in
1991, the Dallas Museum of Art in 1992 and a third undetermined
museum the same year.
   _Masterpieces of 19th century Russian photography, to be shown
in two or three U.S. museums _ yet undecided _ in 1993.
   American art shows traveling to the Soviet Union include:
   _A collection of 195 historic American photographs taken between
1839 and 1904, including images of the Civil War, exploration of
the American West and the native Indian nations. Tentatively
scheduled to open in Moscow in 1991.
   _Sculptures from the Nasher Collection, regarded as the most
important private holding of 20th century sculpture in the world,
to open in Moscow in the summer of 1991.
   _A survey of American modern art from 1950 to 1980, including
paintings by Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Willem de Kooning.
Tentatively scheduled to open at the Artists Union Hall in Moscow
in 1992 and travel to the Russian Museum in Leningrad the same year.
   _Treasures of pre-Columbian art from North and South America,
including more than 200 sculptures, ceramics and other ancient
objects dating to 2000 B.C. To open at the Russian Museuim in
Leningrad in 1993.
   Gordon Dee Smith, president of InterCultura, and Genrikh P.
Popov, chief of the Soviet Ministry of Culture's fine arts
department, said the exchange will be unsurpassed in scope, size
and duration in the history of Soviet-American cultural cooperation.
   They said that when exchange plans are completed, the
itineraries for the exhibitions are expected to stress appearances
at museums outside such major cities as New York, Washington,
Moscow and Leningrad.
   Smith said there were no current plans for any of the Soviet
shows to appear at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York or
the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
   The first project under the joint agreement, resulting from
negotiations that began in 1987, is ``10 + 10: Contemporary Soviet
and American Painters,'' an exhibition of recent works by 10 Soviet
and 10 American artists. That show, which opened in Fort Worth last
May, will travel to the Soviet Union next year after a U.S. tour.
