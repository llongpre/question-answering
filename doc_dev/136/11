   People who knew Joe T. Meador say they
can't believe the quiet hardware store owner stole millions in
medieval art from a German church while he was a soldier during
World War II.
   The possibility that Meador stashed the precious cache in a
Whitewright bank vault was the talk of this farm town Thursday,
when The New York Times quoted unidentified sources as saying he
was responsible for one of the century's biggest art thefts.
   ``I just don't believe he was that kind of a man,'' said
73-year-old Mary Bryant, who said she had visited Meador's home but
could not remember seeing any sumptuous works of art.
   ``He didn't seem the type of guy to me that would do something
like that,'' said Troyce Spencer, who also lives in this town of
1,760 people about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The newspaper said Meador, in the final days of World War II,
took the objects from a church in Quedlinburg, an ancient castle
town in what is now East Germany. The Times based its report on
interviews with art experts, lawyers and neighbors of Meador.
   Stolen was a small, silver display case inlaid with enamels and
precious stones, with side panels of carved ivory; a liturgical
ivory comb; a manuscript dated 1513; several rock crystal flasks
and gold and silver crucifixes, and other treasures.
   The Army investigated the theft but dropped the matter in 1949
when Quedlinburg became part of East Germany.
   Dietrich Kotzsche, a German authority in medieval decorative
art, said the Quedlinburg treasures, dating to the 9th and 10th
centuries, could be worth millions.
   The Times reported today that the church in Quedlinburg has
retained two lawyers to seek the return of the art.
   Meador died in 1980 at age 64. He co-owned a family hardware and
farm tool business and grew orchids in a greenhouse behind the
two-story Victorian home he shared with his mother, Mabel.
   ``He was the type of fellow that didn't mix with people much,''
said Odell Caraway, a member of American Legion Post 225 to which
Meador once belonged. ``As far as I know he's never been involved
in any kind of crooked stuff.''
   Willi A. Korte, a West German government official who
specializes in the repatriation of cultural property, and Thomas R.
Kline of the law firm Andrews &amp; Kurth of Washington and Dallas,
said they planned a trip to Dallas today to negotiate with Meador's
relatives, the Times said.
   Neither those lawyers nor John S. Torigian, an attorney for
Meador's brother, Jack, could be reached for comment Thursday by
The Associated Press.
   Meador was an officer in the 87th Armored Field Artillery, which
occupied Quedlinburg and guarded a mine shaft where the Times said
the treasures were kept. The items disappeared a few days after
U.S. troops took over the area in 1945, the newspaper said.
   Three longtime Meador employees said Thursday they had never
known their boss to show off any art works.
   The Times reported that a source it did not identify said the
treasures are in the vault of the First National Bank of
Whitewright, reportedly as collateral for a loan. Harrell Stowers,
the bank's executive vice president, would not confirm that
information Thursday when asked by The Associated Press.
   Jack Meador, his wife, Jean, and Meador's sister, Jane Meador
Cook, also would not comment Thursday.
   How the treasures got to Texas is a secret that may have died
with Meador.
   Most of the people interviewed Thursday said they didn't know
Meador had even been in the Army or World War II.
   ``We haven't had this much excitement since the machine gun
deal,'' said Mayor Clarence Tillet Jr., who explained that a judge
once charged four machine guns in the town's name to avoid paying
sales tax.
