   Art treasures allegedly pilfered by an American
soldier at the end of World War II have been given to a Dallas
museum while attorneys for his family and an East German church
haggle over ownership of the treasure.
   Attorneys for the church in Quedlinburg and for the heirs of
former Army Lt. Joe T. Meador, who allegedly took the centuries-old
objects, announced the agreement today at the Dallas Museum of Art.
   The museum agreed to provide a ``temporary, neutral safe
haven,'' said museum director Richard R. Brettell in a statement.
However, the pieces will not be displayed publicly until the
lawsuit brought by the church is settled.
   ``Claimants presently contemplate permitting the museum
subsequently to display the objects ... with terms for any display
to be negotiated later,'' the statement said.
   The objects to be brought to the museum include articles of
gold, silver, ivory and crystal dating from the 8th to 14th
centuries, the museum said.
   The agreement was reached today between law firms representing
both sides.
   The items have been in Whitewright, about 60 miles north of
Dallas, and Dallas since 1945, the museum said.
   The artworks have been stored recently in safety deposit boxes
in banks in those cities.
   The Lutheran church, Stiftskirche-Domgemeinde of Quedlinburg,
claims Meador, who lived in Whitewright, stole the trove while his
unit was guarding a mine shaft where the items had been hidden.
   Attorneys for Jack Meador of Whitewright and Jane Meador Cook of
Mesquite, brother and sister of the deceased soldier, have been
negotiating a proposed move of the treasures to the Dallas museum.
   The ownership lawsuit is being heard by U.S. District Judge
Sidney Fitzwater of Dallas, who is expected to review the
agreement. Fitzwater on July 9 ordered the heirs and the church to
agree on a facility to store the items until the case is settled.
   Meador, who died in 1980, bequeathed the artwork to his siblings.
