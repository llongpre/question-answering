   An East German church is getting help
from West Germany to retrieve art treasures believed pilfered by an
American soldier at the close of World War II, a West German
official said Monday.
   East and West Germany also agreed to build an information
database aimed at the return of other art works that vanished when
the Third Reich fell.
   Litigation to retrieve the so-called Quedlinburg treasures from
bank vaults in Texas is already under way. The Foreign Ministry
said Monday that West Germany would pay the legal costs.
   Bonn's help in meeting the expense will be a major boost for the
Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg, which claims its treasures were
stolen at the end of World War II, said Klaus Maurice, director of
the West German Cultural Foundation of the States.
   ``Nobody knew until now who had to pay, but they will pay and
this is marvelous,'' Maurice said.
   The Quedlinburg treasures include two rare medieval manuscripts,
a jeweled, ivory-carved container for relics and several
rock-crystal and ivory objects. They were allegedly removed from a
mine shaft where they had been hidden in the final days of the war.
   Maurice said there was no doubt the art works in question were
authentic.
   The Quedlinburg treasures, among Germany's most famous art
works, were allegedly taken by a U.S. army officer stationed in
Quedlinburg, now East Germany, in 1945, and brought to his hometown
of Whitewright, Texas.
   The church is suing the sister and brother of the officer, the
late Joe T. Meador, to recover the treasures.
   Maurice said officials have no clear idea of how many other
works were allegedly looted from Germany's artitistic heritage in
the final months of the war.
   ``The problem up to now is that we had two states and it wasn't
easy to speak with East Germany,'' Maurice said. ``Now, this is
easier.''
   Maurice spoke after attending a two-hour meeting to dicuss
coordinated approaches toward retrieving lost German art. Also
attending the meeting was a Ministry of Culture representative from
East Germany, which is expected to formally unite with its Western
neighbor in December.
   The new database is to be established in Berlin and collect
information from museums, churches and other institutions
throughout the two Germanys, Maurice said. The database will
compare pre-World War II inventories with current records in an
attempt to get a complete picture of what is missing, he said.
