I do not often sit down to a candlelit dinner in a French cathedral but last
week I had the opportunity, between mouthfuls of lamb and couscous, to study
the Romanesque sculptures of the cathedral of St Lazare at Autun. At the
same time I was able to contemplate the outstanding 12th-century carvings of
the tympanum of the Vision of the Apocalypse at the abbey church of Moissac;
and I scarcely had to turn my head to see the remarkable relationship
between architecture and sculpture at the basilica of St Madeleine at
Vezelay. Within reach of my table were the slender sculptures from Chartres
as well as columns, capitals, chancels and Carolingian conceits from all
over France.
I was, of course, in a cathedral of culture, at an elegant Parisian event to
mark the re-opening of the Musee National des Monuments Francais at the
Palais de Chaillot. The story of this museum goes back to the 1880s when the
architect Eugene-Emanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879) had the idea that the
French public should have the chance to see, in Paris, the high points of
French architecture and sculpture of the Middle Ages. He put together this
remarkable assembly of cast copies of important elements of buildings in
what was then the new Palais du Trocadero, which had originally been
designed by the architect Davioud for the Paris Universal Exhibition in
1878.
The display was always intended to be didactic, offering the visitor the
opportunity to make comparative analyses of stylistic developments.
Viollet-le-Duc was a scholar and historian and his architectural activity
consisted principally of repair and restoration, including work on monuments
including Notre Dame and the Sainte Chapelle in Paris. He wrote a dictionary
of French architecture and this museum is an effective monument to his
conviction that architects can and should learn from the past. He saw the
parallels between Gothic structures and the development of 19th-century
engineering.
As the original progenitor of the museum, Viollet-le-Duc would have approved
of the way it has suddenly taken on a new lease of life. The original
Trocadero was transformed in 1937 by the architect Carlu into the Palais de
Chaillot, as the centrepiece of the Paris Universal Exposition of that year.
Today these former exhibition buildings gather around the steps and stylish
fountains of the Trocadero, paying homage to the Eiffel Tower. They remain
resolutely of the 1930s and provide an extraordinary contrast to the
architectural collections housed there.
For a long time the casts have been seen as little more than dusty relics,
stranded in the 1930s splendour of the Chaillot. It has taken the dramatic
energy of Mr Jack Lang and his ministry of education and culture to see the
potential of this important museum. It has also taken an enormous amount of
work and inspiration from the young curator  - Mr Guy Cogeval, who came here
from the Louvre; in only six months he has achieved a considerable
transformation.
It begins in the new entrance hall which has been designed by a young
architect, Jean-Christophe Denise. This is a handsome light space in the
spirit of Carlu. It has a most stylish cafe-restaurant with a marvellous
view of the fountains of the Trocadero and the Eiffel Tower (the furniture
is based on Carlu's original art deco designs); there is also a new
bookshop. The clean lines of this hall provide a cool setting for the four
giant fragments of the reproduction of the sculpture - 'la danse de
Carpeaux' - originally created by Paul Landowski in 1931. These look
dramatic and surreal, mounted at a high level on large plinths.
The hall is accessible to all visitors to the museums in the Palais de
Chaillot, including those of the theatre and cinema. (The Musee du Cinema is
likely to enjoy a close relationship with the renovated Musee national des
Monuments Francais because of Mr Cogeval's great interest in film and his
plans to create events that explore both the plastic and the cinematic
arts.)
To visit the great halls upstairs that house the maquettes, casts and models
is a thrilling experience, although in time the displays will probably be
reordered and captioned to make them both more instructive and more
enjoyable. Mr Cogeval is anxious to make more of the amazing collections of
topographical and architectural photographs stored here. They will form part
of the large programme of temporary exhibitions.
The first exhibition to be held is called 'Marseille a Paris', a version of
the very successful exhibition held in Marseilles. Its subject is the city
in the 19th century, considering both the physical character of the changing
city and the artistic activity within it at the time. A large variety of
artefacts ranging from contemporary models and maps to paintings and plans,
drawings and sculptures is displayed to convey the commerce and creativity
of one entire city at a peak moment of its growth. (The installation here is
sometimes inevitably in conflict with the permanent installation of the
museum, but in 1994 there will be a full-scale temporary exhibition space.)
Marseilles grew and prospered in the 19th century, its artistic flowering as
aesthetically mixed as any other city at the time. It is probably right to
show the whole range so that comparisons of quality can be made. Relatively
unknown history painters are shown as seriously as old masters, and posters
and plans rub shoulders with fine drawings. It is a complex and dense
exhibition, giving a sense of a city touched by the exoticism of its African
trade and yet solidly rooted in the Second Empire in its architecture and
monuments.
The renewal of this museum in Paris is important for the broadening of our
architectural culture. It will take a lot of imagination to build on the
solid foundations of the unique collection. The resurrection has just begun,
but I am sure Mr Cogeval will ensure that it continues with both scholarship
and excitement. It is a museum to watch.
