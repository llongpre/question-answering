<HEAD>Friend: World War II Officer Confided About Smuggled Medieval Art</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>

   The late World War II Army officer accused of
stealing priceless German art treasures at the end of the war
stumbled onto them during a battle and simply shipped them home in
a plain brown wrapper, a friend says.
   Owen Hunsaker, a college classmate of Joe T. Meador, said his
friend agonized over whether to return the stolen Medieval
artworks, but loved them too much to part with them, The Dallas
Morning News reported Friday.
   He said Meador was running for cover during fighting near
Quedlinburg, Germany when he ended up in a mine shaft and
discovered an ``Aladdin's Cave.''
   The Army lieutenant filled his jacket with ``as many treasures
as he could hold,'' Hunsaker said. He then mailed the artworks home
in a box wrapped in plain brown paper and marked ``old books.''
   Hunsaker, 71, of New York said Meador told him the story during
a visit in 1948. They had been college classmates in the 1930s and
kept in touch until a few years before Meador's death in 1980.
   The religious treasures stored in the mine shaft for safekeeping
from retreating Nazi forces disappeared in April 1945. They
belonged to Quedlinburg Cathedral.
   Lawyers for the Quedlinburg church contend Meador stole the
treasures and kept them in his hometown of Whitewright, Texas, a
tiny town about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The church wants the treasures returned and has asked a federal
judge to prevent Meador's heirs from moving or disposing of the
artworks, believed to be stored in nearby bank vaults.
   Hunsaker's account is the first offering an explanation of how
Meador allegedly discovered and shipped the artworks that include a
bejeweled gold-covered manuscript, crucifixes and ancient coins.
   The artworks were gifts to the church from Germany's earliest
kings.
   During Hunsaker's 1948 visit to Whitewright, Meador took the
so-called illuminated manuscript ``wrapped in an old Texas quilt''
from a bedroom closet, he said.
   ``It was unbelievable,'' said Hunsaker. ``I knew I was touching
ancient history.''
   He said it had an elaborate cover of gold encrusted with jewels,
highlighted with a silver figure of Christ with his hand risen in
blessing.
   Hunsaker said he frequently urged Meador to turn over the
artwork to authorities.
   ``When he looked at it he'd get a dreary, transported look on
his face because he knew what he had _ he loved it _ and he
couldn't part with it. He struggled with that a lot,'' Hunsaker
said.
   Meador considered taking the artworks to Mexico to obtain phony
ownership papers, but abandoned the plan because he feared border
police, he said.
   ``Joe knew he had a hot potato,'' Hunsaker said, ``He couldn't
let everybody know about it, and he certainly couldn't sell it.''
