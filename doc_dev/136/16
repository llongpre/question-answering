   Word that a local hardware and farm
tool vendor may have pulled off one of the century's biggest art
thefts while a soldier in Germany during World War II was the talk
of this town of 1,760 Thursday.
   There were more reporters than residents on the town's main
drag, about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   ``Not much happens here,'' said Carolyn Flaughter, ``You see
cameramen walking up and down the street. You just don't see that
every day.''
   According to a New York Times report Thursday, Joe T. Meador
transported the priceless pieces to Texas from Quedlinburg, an
ancient castle town in what is now East Germany.
   The Army investigated the theft but dropped the matter in 1949
when Quedlinburg became part of East Germany.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying the
treasures are in the vault of the First National Bank of
Whitewright, reportedly as collateral for a loan.
   Bank officials declined to comment on the reports. Harrell
Stowers, bank executive vice president, said he could not confirm
whether the treasures are or ever have been in the vault.
   Meador died in 1980. His brother, Jack, and his sister-in-law,
Jean, declined to comment Thursday.
   The Times based its report on interviews with art experts,
lawyers and neighbors of Meador.
   The treasures include a small silver reliquary, inlaid with
enamels and precious stones, with side panels of carved ivory; a
liturgical ivory comb; a manuscript dated 1513; several rock
crystal flasks and gold and silver crucifixes. Some of the
treasures were gifts from kings and emperors who ruled German
states in the 9th and 10th centuries.
   Meador was an officer with the 87th Armored Field Artillery, the
unit that occupied Quedlinburg and guarded the mine shaft where the
treasures reportedly were kept. They disappeared a few days after
American troops took over the area in 1945, the Times said.
   Three years after Meador died, his brother-in-law, Dr. Don H.
Cook, of Mesquite, Texas, sought to have two medieval manuscripts
evaluated, John Carroll Collins, a Dallas estate appraiser, told
the newspaper.
   A former employee of Meador's, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Meador reportedly showed his employees richly bound
gold and silver manuscripts.
   But three longtime Meador employees said Thursday they'd never
known their boss to show off any art works when they were around.
The three declined to give their names.
   Most of the people interviewed Thursday said they didn't know
Meador had even been in the Army or World War II.
   ``Joe was a quiet man. I think Joe, in my way of thinking, was a
very, very intelligent man ... he seemed to mind his own
business,'' Mayor Clarence Tillett said.
   Tillett said he'd visited Meador in the house he shared with his
mother but didn't recall any unusual works of art.
   ``It wouldn't have surprised me for anything to come out of
Germany,'' Tillett said.
   Many residents recalled Meador as a loner whose most memorable
trait was his passion for growing orchids.
   ``He didn't seem like the type of guy to me who would do
something like that,'' said Troyce Spencer, a resident.
