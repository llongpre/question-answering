In the tiny Texas town of Whitewright, hard on the Oklahoma border, a scandal 
is brewing in which a man who raised prize orchids and ran a hardware store 
before his death 10 years ago may have been the perpetrator of one of the 
largest art thefts ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Joe T. Meador, by all accounts a quiet, unassuming man who served 
honorably in World War II and ended his service stationed in what is now East 
Germany in 1945. His unit was in charge of guarding a mine shaft that contained 
some of the world's most valuable art objects, hidden there at the time for 
safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation and a West German investigator are now 
looking to a bank vault in Meador's hometown of Whitewright, population 1,800, 
as the place where the treasures might at last be recovered. The investigation 
was disclosed Thursday by the New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
"I am going to Texas to try to put some more nails in some coffins," said Willi 
Korte, the German investigator, in a telephone interview. "I have been to 
Whitewright before, and it wasn't because Triple-A recommended it." 
</P>
<P>
The first break in the case occurred last April, when, for a $3-million 
"finder's fee," one of the missing works was returned to a West German 
foundation, with the stipulation that the names of the sellers, as well as the 
name of the lawyer who negotiated the deal, would never be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
At the time the deal was cut for the artwork -- a 9th-Century jewel-encrusted, 
illustrated manuscript of the Four Gospels -- a spokesman for the foundation 
said the manuscript was taken to Texas by an American GI at the end of the war. 
That and other treasures were hidden in the mine shaft near Quedlinburg, a 
medieval castle town in Saxony-Anhault Province. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement for the manuscript was carried out in Switzerland, where such 
sales are protected by law. 
</P>
<P>
The lengthy report in the New York Times pointed to Meador as the thief and his 
heirs as the people who arranged for the sale of the manuscript. Numerous calls 
to the relatives elicited a string of "no comments." The lawyer named as the 
intermediary in the transaction, John S. Torigian, left word that he would be 
taking depositions for the rest of the week. 
</P>
<P>
The president of the bank where the remainder of the treasures are purportedly 
being kept would not discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
FBI agent Mike Satimauro of the Dallas office said the matter is under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We're intent on getting a better handle on what's supposed to be missing," he 
said. "We're trying to see if we do, in fact, have stolen articles and, if we 
do, we will do our best to get them back." 
</P>
<P>
While the FBI is investigating, the town of Whitewright went into an absolute 
swoon Thursday. Television crews in helicopters flashed overhead and the 
telephones never seemed to stop ringing. 
</P>
<P>
"This has thrown us into an uproar," said Mayor Clarence Tillett. "The whole 
town will be talking about this for some time to come. There's 1,800 people 
here and people usually know what's going on with everyone else in town. But I 
can tell you, all of us were surprised about this news about Joe Meador." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Kennealy, the chief of police, said: "Nobody knows anything about this." 
</P>
<P>
Korte, the investigator, said these kinds of thefts usually follow a similar 
pattern, in which art was taken, the thief dies and the heirs try to cash in on 
the treasure. In this case, the family members allegedly consulted with a 
number of experts about two manuscripts. Most of the experts told the family 
that the manuscripts probably were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
"There was not a whole lot of sophistication, or they wouldn't have exposed 
themselves by having so many appraisals," Korte said. "I hope the family has 
some valuable information and some additional items." 
</P>
<P>
Korte said his first nibble came early this year, when word went out through 
the art world that one of the manuscripts could be had for the $3-million 
finder's fee. That was two years after the first word that the Quedlinburg 
treasures might be for sale, for the right price. 
</P>
<P>
"The offer clearly smelled like it was coming out of the U.S.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Korte was somewhat circumspect about how the field was narrowed to 
Whitewright, he said documents at the National Archives had been extremely 
beneficial. He said he had been looking for an officer to be the thief. Meador 
was a lieutenant when the war ended. 
</P>
<P>
He said experience had shown that most such postwar thefts were "under the eyes 
of an American officer or with the participation of an American officer." 
</P>
<P>
After the war, Meador, who had studied art in college, came back to Whitewright 
after his father became ill. By all accounts, he led a very normal life, 
waiting on people at the hardware store and raising orchids in the three 
greenhouses behind the family home. He never married. At graduation time, 
Meador provided free orchids to the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall Hasty, one of the pallbearers at Meador's funeral, said Thursday: "I 
heard from several people that Joe used to bring those manuscripts in the 
hardware store once in a while and left them laying right out there on the 
counter. 
</P>
<P>
"The consensus in town is he didn't know the value of them. If he did, I don't 
think he would have laid them out on a counter in a hardware store downtown." 
</P>

Times researcher Lianne Hart contributed to this story.
