   A federal judge has ordered an inventory of
medieval artwork believed stolen by a U.S. soldier from a German
mineshaft during World War II and stashed in a small-town bank
vault in Texas.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater ordered Tuesday that the
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the
inspectors and the objects, which have been valued in the millions
by German art experts.
   The Lutheran cathedral in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to
recover the artwork from the First National Bank in Whitewright and
the family of Joe T. Meador.
   Meador, a former Army lieutenant, is believed to have stolen the
objects and stashed them in his hometown of Whitewright, about 60
miles north of Dallas.
   The treasure disappeared in 1945 from a mine shaft in
Quedlinburg, a castle town occupied by U.S. troops at the end of
World War II. Meador died of cancer in 1980, and his family put the
objects in the bank for safekeeping, said branch President John
Farley.
   Farley said he never knew the art had been stolen and had been
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership. ``We wanted to do
what was right,'' he said.
   Government officials have said it is unclear whether charges can
be brought in the case because of statutes of limitations on thefts
of art.
   The judge on Tuesday dictated the circumstances of the inventory
down to the type of flash to be used in photographing the items,
the placement of the cameras and a requirement that all inspectors
wear cotton gloves.
   The lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects were taken by Meador,
including a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or 10th
century, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal flask and an ivory
comb inlaid with precious stones.
   Also listed as stolen are two manuscripts, one from about 1300
and the other from 1515, bound in precious metals and encrusted
with gems.
   Meador's brother and sister, Jack Meador of Whitewright and Jane
Meador Cook of Mesquite, have refused to comment.
   Farley said the bank will ask to be dropped from the lawsuit
because First National never claimed to own the relics.
