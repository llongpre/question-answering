<HEAD>477-Year-Old Manuscript Taken During War Returned to Germany</HEAD>

   A 477-year-old manuscript taken from Germany by an
American soldier at the end of World War II has been returned to
its homeland.
   The law firm Andrews &amp; Kurth said Wednesday the Evangelister
manuscript, noted for its silver cover containing the figure of
Jesus Christ, was returned earlier this month and is being restored
in Munich.
   American soldier Joe T. Meador, who died in 1980, brought the
manuscript and several other items to America in 1945 from
Quedlinburg. They eventually wound up in the hands of First
National Bank of Whitewright.
   This is the second piece of Quedlinburg treasure recovered by
the German Cultural Foundation of the States. The Samuhel Gospels,
made in the 10th century, was recovered in Switzerland for a $3
million finder's fee, according to reports from the New York Times.
   The Lutheran Church is suing for the return of the other works,
which are being held in a Dallas museum.
