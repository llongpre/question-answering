<HEAD>Attorneys for German Church Say Family Is Hiding Treasures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>

   Attorneys for an East German church trying to
recover medieval treasures stolen during World War II allege that a
Texas family moved or hid some of the items in the last two weeks.
   In court documents, the attorneys accuse relatives of Joe T.
Meador of Whitewright of moving the articles from bank vaults in
Dallas and Whitewright so the lawyers wouldn't find them.
   Meador, who died in 1980, allegedly stole the items, including
centuries-old manuscripts of the Gospels, from the church in
Quedlinburg at the end of World War II.
   Motions filed in federal court Friday allege that Meador's
siblings, Jack Meador and Jane Meador Cook, ``have been linked to
more than half'' of about 18 artworks taken from a mine-shaft
hiding place near Quedlinburg in 1945.
   The Meadors allegedly inherited the trove, valued in the
millions, when their brother died of cancer.
   Raymond A. Krell, a Houston attorney for the Meadors, did not
return phone calls Saturday from The Associated Press.
   Alan Harris, an attorney for the church, declined to comment on
the motions Saturday.
   No court action was taken Friday on the motions.
   The church filed a lawsuit Monday after three weeks of
negotiations with the family reached an impasse.
   The lawsuit, which also names the First National Bank of
Whitewright as a defendant, seeks unspecified damages. The bank has
held some of the artwork for at least the last three months, its
lawyer said.
   A U.S. State Department legal adviser said this week that the
lawsuit was filed after East German officials learned the treasures
were about to be moved to Switzerland, where secrecy laws would
make them impossible to trace or recover.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater granted a 10-day
temporary restraining order Monday barring movement of the trove,
pending a decision in the case. But he denied a plea by church
lawyers that the items be placed in court custody for safekeeping.
   On Tuesday, he ordered the church be allowed to examine,
photograph and inventory treasures being stored in vaults at the
Whitewright bank and the First Interstate Bank of Dallas.
   During an examination Thursday of Mrs. Cook's safe-deposit boxes
in Dallas, only one item believed to be a Quedlinburg treasure was
found, the church contends.
   Mrs. Cook removed several of the other items last week, the
church says, and an unidentified person rented a new safe-deposit
box and ``placed certain items'' into it. The objects were not
identified.
