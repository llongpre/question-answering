   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered the small-town
bank that has been holding a cache of stolen medieval art to open
its vault for inventory by the East German cathedral that claims
the treasure.
   U.S. District Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater also ordered that the
time and place of the inspection be kept secret to protect the
inspectors and the objects.
   The art is believed to have been stolen from a German mine shaft
at the end of World War II by a U.S. soldier from Texas. German art
experts have said the treasures are worth millions of dollars, but
no specific estimate is available.
   The president of a First National Bank branch in the town of
Whitewright said he never knew the art had been stolen and has been
trying to mediate the dispute over its ownership.
   ``We wanted to do what was right,'' branch President John Farley
said in an interview published Tuesday in The Denison Herald.
   The Lutheran cathedral in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to
recover the artwork from First National and the family of Joe T.
Meador, a former Army first lieutenant who is believed to have
stolen the objects and stashed them in his hometown of Whitewright,
about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The treasure disappeared in 1945 from a mine shaft in
Quedlinburg, a castle town occupied by U.S. troops at the end of
World War II.
   Meador died of cancer in 1980, and his family put the objects in
the bank for safekeeping, Farley said. He oversees the Whitewright
branch but is based at Denison, about 70 miles north of Dallas.
   Farley told The Associated Press the bank will ask to be dropped
from the lawsuit because First National never claimed to own the
relics. He declined to answer further questions about the case.
   A church representative met with Farley on May 7 to demand
return of the treasures. The lawsuit alleges at least 14 objects
were taken by Meador, including a silver, ivory and gold reliquary
from the 9th or 10th century, a 10th century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask with sides shaped like birds and an ivory comb inlaid with
precious stones.
   Farley and his attorney, Timothy Powers, told The Denison Herald
the bank had been negotiating with the church and the Meador family.
   The talks broke down last week when the story broke and
international attention focused on the bank and Whitewright,
population 1,760, Farley said.
   He said keeping the treasures did not affect the bank's daily
business or financial status.
   ``We're on the sidelines,'' he said. ``I'm sorry that we were
not able to get the parties to agree. It's not in anyone's best
interest to incur litigation costs.''
   Fitzwater revised his inventory order Tuesday after conference
calls with attorneys on both sides of the dispute.
   He also ruled on a defense request that had been informally made
Tuesday, but his office declined to reveal the nature of the
decision or the request until the request is formally filed with
the court Wednesday.
   Fitzwater dictated the circumstances of the inventory down to
the placement of cameras and a requirement that all inspectors wear
cotton gloves.
   Attorneys for the defendants did not return phone calls seeking
comment.
   Meador's brother and sister, Jack Meador of Whitewright and Jane
Meador Cook of Mesquite, have declined to comment.
   Government officials have said it is unclear whether criminal
charges could be brought in the case because of statutes of
limitations on thefts of art and antiquities.
   Ely Maurer, a State Department assistant legal adviser for
cultural property, said criminal charges might be pursued under the
National Stolen Property Act. The law prohibits interstate or
international transport of stolen art or artifacts.
   The law might be extended to heirs if they knew the art was
stolen and transferred it across state lines, Maurer said.
