<HEAD>East German Church Files Lawsuit in Artwork Case</HEAD>

   An East German church has filed a lawsuit
demanding the return of medieval artwork believed stolen by an
American officer in the final days of World War II.
   After hearing oral arguments by telephone Monday, U.S. District
Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater barred movement of the church treasures
without a court order.
   Fitzwater also ordered that representatives of the Lutheran
cathedral in Quedlinburg be allowed to inventory the cache. The
artwork is believed to be held in a bank in Whitewright, a town of
1,760 about 60 miles north of Dallas.
   The church hopes to recover 15 treasures that had been hidden in
a mineshaft during the war. The treasures disappeared in 1945,
shortly after American forces occupied the medieval castle town.
   Among the treasures, said Thomas R. Kline, the lawyer who filed
the lawsuit, are a rock crystal flask of Byzantine origin; a wooden
box decorated with silver, gold, ivory and precious stones, dating
from the 9th or 10th century and containing relics of Henry I; and
two manuscripts, one from about 1300 and the other from 1515, bound
in precious metals and encrusted with gems.
   Joe T. Meador, a former Army lieutenant who was among the U.S.
troops who entered Quedlinburg in April 1945, is believed to have
stolen the artifacts.
   After he died of cancer in 1980, his brother and sister, Jack
Meador of Whitewright and Jane Meador Cook of Mesquite, obtained
the treasures and stored at least some in a vault at the First
National Bank, The Dallas Morning News said today.
   They apparently sold at least two of the pieces, the bejeweled
illuminated manuscripts, the newspaper said.
   A secretary for Jack Meador told The Associated Press on Monday
night that Meador had no comment on the lawsuit. Mrs. Cook also
declined to comment.
   An affidavit filed with the lawsuit said a church representative
had met with bank President John Farley to demand the treasures.
Farley confirmed that some of the artifacts are at his bank, The
New York Times reported today.
   Farley said he first saw the artworks in 1986 ``when a customer
of the bank brought me two manuscripts to have appraised.'' He
would not reveal the customer's name or disclose the number of
artworks stored in the bank.
   Ely Maurer, a State Department assistant legal adviser for
cultural property, said the lawsuit was filed primarily because
negotiations for return of the collection reached an impasse during
the weekend.
   An unidentified FBI agent was quoted by the Morning News as
saying it was unclear whether charges could be brought in the case.
   He said that the statute of limitations for interstate
transportation of stolen property is five years and that
international treaties governing theft of art and antiquities have
a 30-year statute of limitations.
   Maurer said charges might be pursued under the National Stolen
Property Act, a statute prohibiting interstate or international
transport of stolen art.
   ``The law would extend to heirs who knowingly transferred the
property across state lines,'' Maurer said. ``The fact that they
moved some of the artworks as recently as this year might make the
statute apply.''
   He said there is evidence the family knew for some time that the
art was stolen.
