   The Army said it has thrown out all
records of its investigation into the World War II theft of German
medieval artworks that wound up in a small town in Texas.
   As a result, the Army may never know whether a former soldier
from Texas who died in 1980 was a suspect in the theft, an Army
spokeswoman told The Denison Herald in an interview published
Thursday.
   The artifacts, some of them stored in the vault of the First
National Bank in Whitewright, have been valued in the millions of
dollars by German art experts.
   A Lutheran church in Quedlinburg, East Germany, is suing to
recover the artwork from the bank and the late Joe T. Meador's
family.
   Meador is believed to have stolen the objects while an Army
lieutenant, and stashed them in his hometown about 60 miles north
of Dallas. He left the artifacts to a brother and sister.
   Army military police investigated the theft, but the file was
apparently destroyed in 1964 when records of all cases older than
15 years were purged, Barbara Parker, a spokeswoman at the U.S.
Army Crime Records Center in Fort Holabird, Md., told the Herald.
   Only records of historical interest survived the housecleaning,
Parker said.
   The Army abandoned the case in 1949 when Quedlinburg became part
of East Germany. Army spokesmen have said it is unclear whether the
military will reopen the case.
   The articles allegedly taken by Meador include a silver, ivory
and gold reliquary from the 9th or 10th century, a 10th century
Byzantine rock-crystal flask with sides formed like birds and an
ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.
   Meador's heirs, Jack Meador, 70, and Jane Cook, 58, said earlier
this week that their unoccupied farmhouse was ransacked Monday
night by burglars who mistakenly believed the treasure was there.
   The burglary was described in a motion filed by Meador and Ms.
Cook seeking a protective order to keep all parties in the lawsuit
from discussing the case in public. U.S. District Judge Sidney A.
Fitzwater denied the motion Tuesday.
   The bank had acknowledged the artifacts are in the vault.
Fitzwater has ordered the bank to allow representatives of the
church to inventory and photograph the artifacts.
   Denison is 70 miles north of Dallas.
