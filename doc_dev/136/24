   An art expert says stolen German treasures stored
at Dallas Museum of Art rank among the world's rarest and most
important religious artifacts.
   One of the treasures may contain material linked to the Virgin
Mary, said Dietrich Koetzche of the Kunstgewerbe Museum in Berlin.
   He visited Dallas to study the relics for a German church that
claims to own them. They were believed to have been taken from a
mine shaft at Quedlinburg, East Germany, near the end of World War
II by a soldier from Texas.
   The objects ``rank among the three most significant medieval
church treasures in Germany,'' he told the Dallas Times Herald. Joe
Meador, the soldier, died in 1980, leaving the art to his brother
and sister. It later was turned over to the museum.
   Officials say most of the treasures were reliquaries or
containers used to hold relics. Koetzche said he believes some
small reliquaries hold items belonging to the Virgin Mary, possibly
including a lock of her hair.

   William Bentley Ball, a noted
religious-rights attorney, urges Roman Catholics and evangelical
Protestants to become partners in opposing trends toward secularism.
   Ball, a Catholic, writes in the evangelical fortnightly,
Christianity Today, that evangelicals and Catholics share positions
in opposing the breakdown of sexual morality, affirming the
sanctity of life, rejecting abortion and euthanasia, favoring
parental choice in schooling and supporting religious efforts to
influence political decisions.

   A Jewish scholar says Orthodox Judaism,
one of three major branches of the faith, is on the rise despite
``Orthodox-bashing by its detractors.''
   Rabbi Norman Lamm, president of Yeshiva University, told a
recent convention of the Rabbinical Council of America,
representing Orthodox rabbis, that ``Orthodox-bashing appears to
have abated, but it is still powerful.''

   Membership in the United Methodist
Church declined during 1989 to 8,873,638, down about 68,000. But
that loss was 7,000 less than the year before, the denomination
reports.
   The denomination, second largest in U.S. Protestantism, had a
peak membership of more than 11 million in 1968. But like most
mainline Protestant bodies, it has declined in size for the last 22
years.

   Appealing to alienated Roman Catholics to
``Come Home'' to church, Franciscan friars in New York and New
Jersey run periodic newspaper ad campaigns. A report says the
program in five years has drawn 2,000 back into church life.
   ``Too many alienated Catholics have heard only the voice of
authority,'' the Rev. Flavian Walsh says in an article about the
program in St. Anthony Messenger, a Cincinnati-based monthly.
   The ads, inviting telephone calls and participation in group
sessions, stress the gentler, compassionate side of the church.
Similar programs have also been used in Boston and Cincinnati.
   Of 15 million non-practicing Catholics in the country, 40
percent of them would like to mend fences and return to church
activity, according to a Gallup Poll, the article says.
