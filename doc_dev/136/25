   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Art treasures plundered from conquered Nazi
Germany have been turning up from Moscow to Krakow to a tiny town
in Texas. Now, with the two Germanys ready to reunite, officials
hope to restore a cultural heritage that was torn asunder by war.
Part of that effort is to find the pilfered artwork and get it
back.

   In 1945, as the Red Army advanced on
Germany, a Soviet soldier stumbled across a stunning collection of
drawings and watercolors, by masters such as Rembrandt, Durer and
Van Dyck, stashed in a castle for safekeeping.
   The soldier, an architect in an engineering unit, bundled what
he could off to Moscow and stored the works in a museum. There they
sat for decades, covered and concealed from the world.
   Now, the aging soldier says the 364 pieces should go back to
their original owner, a German museum, the Kunsthalle in Bremen.
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has written to
his Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, asking that the works
be returned.
   The Germanys, racing to reunite their politics and peoples, are
also trying to restore their cultural heritage, devastated by war
and its plunders.
   But the task is as monumental as some of the missing treasures.
   During World War II, German museums, libraries and churches
packed up their most valuable works and shipped them off for
safekeeping from Allied bombing raids. Later, many treasures were
again moved by the Nazis, to caves or salt mines, to hide them from
advancing troops.
   The destruction of war, the multiple moves, incomplete or
missing inventories, and plundering occupation troops all conspired
to conceal the fate of some of the treasures.
   Art historians say troops from both the West and the East moved
German artworks out of the country after the war.
   In addition, fires were often reported in art repositories. Some
historians question whether some of the fires actually occurred or
whether they destroyed everying that was claimed to have been lost.
   ``I fear that much of what was officially burned is still
somewhere,'' said one museum researcher who didn't want to be
identified by name.
   In addition to individual instances of plundering, many art
historians say some treasures were removed with official sanction
for use as cultural reparations.
   Although that policy was later rejected in the West and many
objects were returned, historians say it is not possible to tell
how much of what was taken was given back.
   ``The problem is that this was done by forces who were operating
like the intelligence forces, without documents or with documents
that were not declassified up to now,'' the museum official said.
``It was a problem of all four of the Allies.''
   ``For many years these things were considered lost anyway
because we had no information whatsoever,'' said a government
source in Bonn who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``You could say this is one of the last fields of really
finishing with the consequences of war.''
   In July, government and art representatives from West and East
Germany agreed to establish a Berlin-based databank to pool
information from museums, churches and libraries on missing art and
its last known location.
   Klaus Maurice, director of the West German Cultural Foundation
of the States, said the list could be completed in three years.
   ``We will make a list of what was lost, not what must be
found,'' he said. ``We don't want to give advice for police.''
   Improving East-West relations and recent finds have already
fueled hopes that more could follow.
   In a Texas court, an East German church, financed by West
Germany, is fighting the heirs of a U.S. soldier who the church
claims made off with a cache of priceless objects hidden in a mine.
U.S. forces occupied the Quedlinburg area, 120 miles southwest of
Berlin, in 1945.
   The treasures include a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from
the 9th or 10th century, a 10th-century Byzantine rock-crystal
flask and an ivory comb inlaid with precious stones.
   An art investigator working with the Prussian Cultural Heritage
Foundation tracked the Quedlinburg treasures to Whitewright, Texas,
about 60 miles north of Dallas, last May.
   The foundation, which includes 15 museums in West Berlin, the
Prussian State Library and Prussian State Archives, houses the
collections of the former Prussian empire.
   Curators from its museums are working, with varying degrees of
success, to find and return their lost treasures, ranging from
Trojan gold to prehistoric baskets.
   The Bremen case is typical of what happened to Germany's art
during the war. The museum sent its masterpieces to several places
throughout the country for safekeeping in 1943, said director
Siegfried Salzmann.
   About 4,000 items went to a castle northwest of Berlin ``to
prevent damages by air attacks,'' he said. Soviet troops occupied
the area in April 1945.
   The Soviet soldier, Victor Baldin, asked his superiors what was
to be done with the art and when they showed no interest, he packed
off what he could to Moscow, Salzmann said.
