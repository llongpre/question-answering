know Rubens and his compatriots better

THERE are sadly limited folk for whom true beauty exists only in the piazzas
of cities beyond the Alps. But if your senses respond to the north, then
Antwerp is without question one of the most beautiful cities of northern
Europe.
This great maritime city on the Scheldt has its sombre side, its rotting
Renaissance facades and defaced Baroque Calvaries. Nonetheless, to my mind
Victor Hugo's judgment is spot on; 'The city is delightful: paintings in the
churches, sculpture adorning the houses, Rubens in the chapels . . . the
city is literally overflowing with art.'
In Hugo's day, Antwerp's dozen or so museums did not exist. Nor, of course,
did the city's newly restored Central Station and any number of
extraordinary late-19th and early 20th-century architectural extravaganzas.
Now there is Antwerp 93, and a notable group of exhibitions which will
ensure that the art-lover will indeed find this a city overflowing with
pleasures.
Perhaps the key fact of Antwerp's history is that as capital of the Spanish
Netherlands, it was held for Catholicism. Any visit should therefore start
at Onze Lieve Vrouwe, the largest Gothic cathedral in the Low Countries. It
has been under restoration for decades, but Antwerp 93 speeded the programme
up.
The entire interior is again visible, with Rubens's three wonderful
altarpieces, cleaned and conserved, displayed at the east end. From May 26
to October 3, the cathedral has an exhibition, Antwerp Altarpieces, the type
of 15th- and 16th-century pieces shipped out in staggering quantities for
churches from England to South America.
Any civilised visit to Antwerp must be partly about getting to know Rubens
better. An unusual exhibition at the Rubenshuis will shed light on the
running of the many highly successful artists' 'factories' of the day.
Rubens Cantoor (which means 'workroom') shows 80 copies of drawings by
Rubens loaned from Copenhagen. Most were made by Willem Panneels, who was
put in charge of the studio between 1628 and 1630 while the master was in
England and Spain (May 15 to June 27).
So intimate is the view of the artist conveyed by the famous Rubenshuis that
you will surely want to round things off with a visit to the Rockoxhuis, the
sumptuous Renaissance mansion which was home to Burgomaster Nicolaas Rockox,
Rubens's friend and patron. And of course, a pilgrimage is required to St
Jacobskerk. Above the wonderfully elegant tomb of the lord of Steen is his
last masterpiece, The Madonna with Saints.
Jacob Jordaens at the Museum of Fine Arts (27 March-27 June 27) is the
flagship exhibition of Antwerpen 93, celebrating 400 years since the
artist's birth. When gout carried Rubens off in 1640, Jordaens immediately
put up his prices. Over the next four decades of this artist's long career,
the Jordaens studio continued to be hugely successful even though its
master's talent declined as Rubens's never had. This should be the year and
the show to reevaluate Jordaens's achievement.
Antwerp: Story of a Metropolis at the Hessenhuis is a major exhibition
mounted by historian Jan van Stock to examine the image and the reality of
Antwerp's two first Golden Ages, in the 16th century and again in the early
17th century. Pride of the city throughout that period was the famous
printing dynasty of the Plantins. It is not only bibliophiles who find the
Museum Plantin-Moretus a place of rare fascination. So long as you are
prepared to peer, books, prints, letters and bills bring the political and
intellectual world of these centuries vividly to life.
Here, too, are portraits by Rubens, an intimate friend of the great
Balthasar Moretus. The Plantin-Moretus marks Antwerpen 93 by looking at the
scientific side of the humanist culture so important to Rubens and his
circle. Botany in the Southern Netherlands (13 March-June 13) comemmorates
the studies of the three great Flemish botanists, Dodoens, Clusius and
Lobelius, whose illustrated treatises were all published by the Moretus
presses.
Although its role in the Festival programme is small, the Museum Mayer van
den Bergh cannot be missed, for it is one of the most remarkable
19th-century museums in the world. Mayer Van den Bergh was a wealthy
connoisseur and art-collector. He never married - the story goes that he was
always looking for a girl with the face of a late-Gothic Virgin Mary.
Van den Bergh died in his early thirties. In 1904, his mother built the
exquisite neo-Renaissance mansion with its intimate rooms. Original cases
still house manuscripts, Byzantine and early medieval ivories, 12th-century
sculpture, coins and a fine collection of Nethelandish and Flemish
paintings. Few art-lovers realise that Breughel's chilling 'Dulle Griet' is
hidden away in the Mayer van den Bergh with his 'Twelve Proverbs', two of
only seven of the artist's works remaining in Belgium.
Diamonds enter the festival in Diamond Jewellery from Antwerp's Golden Age
(April 23-September 26). At the city's distinguished Ethnographic Museum,
there will be The Face of the Spirits: Masks from Zaire (September
19-December 31). The contemporary art programme has not been finalised but
summer will see openings at the Middelheim Open-air Sculpture Museum, the
Museum for Fine Arts, and the Museum of Contemporary Art.
A marvellous guide-book for exploring Antwerp is Derek Blyth's Flemish
Cities Explored (Bodley Head, 1990). It would be nice if in Antwerp's great
year of culture, every one of the chapels, mansions and gardens therein
recommended might indeed be accessible.
