<F P=106> [Herbert Kremp commentary: "Europe Is Expanding"] </F>
  [Text] The inclusion of three Scandinavian states and 
Austria is changing the political and intellectual-cultural 
prospects of the European Union [EU]. The imbalance toward the 
south is disappearing and, with the accession of the north and 
the east, the touch of Carolingian stuffiness is waning. Since 
countries with tested national sovereignty are involved in the 
further decisions, the form of a federation of states, of 
cooperation of national states and their parliaments, is 
beginning to dominate. 
  The old-established members of the EC scene in Brussels have 
long predicted this development with regret, and they are not 
wrong: With the geographic and mental expansion, the political 
"deepening" of the Union becomes a rhetorical postulate without 
any prospect for realization. At least the Scandinavians do not 
have any inclination toward integration in the form of a federal 
state. We are facing the end of the late romantic period. 
  With Finland, the Union gets 1,300 km of Russian border and 
the proximity of the Baltic states -- with all the flair and all 
the risk. In the case of Sweden, Norway, and Austria, the 
single market, that is, the real economic and trade policy 
advantage of the community, has the greatest attractiveness. 
However, particularly Finland and Sweden hope for an increase 
in security, at least in political support. With Austria, the 
German language section of the EU is growing. However, more 
important is its function as a bridge to Hungary, Slovenia, and 
Croatia. Here, too, the Union, which has so far been oriented 
toward West Europe, is going to receive a fruitful closeness to 
the East. 
  Until the date of accession at the upcoming turn of the 
year, 
several obstacles -- both in substance and in terms of 
referendums -- have to be overcome. These apply mainly to 
Norway and Austria. In both countries the result of the 
referendums is uncertain; in Finland and Sweden it is considered 
relatively certain. Germany has pushed the membership 
negotiations forward with great energy. As a result, It is 
natural and unavoidable that it has not gained just friends in 
the old European Community.
