Titian, Rubens, Rembrandt, Hogarth, Delacroix, Degas -- given the list of 
stellar names from the pantheon in Western art history, it might seem odd to 
choose Francois-Xavier Fabre as the artist to represent the highly engaging 
exhibition, "Treasures From the Fitzwilliam Museum: The Increase of Learning 
and other great Objects of that Noble Foundation." 
</P>
<P>
But that's just what its organizers did. Through the reproduction of a Fabre 
portrait on the covers of both the catalogue and the press kit, and with pride 
of place for the painting in the gallery installation, the show -- which opened 
Thursday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (to Sept. 9) -- surprisingly 
features a relatively obscure artist as its metaphoric poster boy. 
</P>
<P>
The choice might be surprising, but it also turns out to be appropriate. The 
reason is that the Fitzwilliam, the first great university museum ever, has 
more on its mind than merely toting up celebrated names. 
</P>
<P>
The museum was established in 1816 by Richard, seventh Viscount Fitzwilliam of 
Merrion, with a bequest to Cambridge University of his art collections and 
library, and a sum of money to care for both. (A sweet portrait of 19-year-old 
Richard, by the often eccentric Joseph Wright of Derby, hangs in the show.) The 
aim, according to the bequest, was to promote "the Increase of Learning and 
other great Objects of that Noble Foundation." The selection at LACMA, which 
numbers more than 160 items, suggests the diversity and scope of that intent. 
</P>
<P>
The earliest object is a delicate, incised drawing of a reindeer on a small, 
thin shard of limestone, dating from the Paleolithic period (about 12000 BC). 
The latest is also a drawing -- a 1918 pencil study of an actress wearing a 
large hat, by Amadeo Modigliani. 
</P>
<P>
In between are Asian, Middle Eastern and, mostly, European decorative arts, 
paintings, sculptures, coins, prints and many more drawings. Not everything is 
first-rate. The graceful Paleolithic reindeer may be regarded as among the 
finest examples of naturalistic art to have survived the ages, but the 
Modigliani is at best indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the celebrated names can't always be counted on to deliver celebrated 
works. Antoine Watteau's delicate chalk study of a man playing a flute falls 
apart in the crude rendering of the hands, while the Renoir painting of a 
street scene is, typically, a chromatic mess (the otherwise sensible catalogue 
wildly claims that it compares to "Luncheon of the Boating Party," far and away 
Renoir's finest painting). In the museum's historical chain, the 19th-Century 
holdings constitute the weakest link, forming a perfunctory coda to the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
But individual excellence is not the only reason a museum -- especially a 
university museum -- assembles a collection. The Watteau drawing claims 
historical significance, serving as the model for figures in more than one 
painting by this important artist, while the Renoir is in part instructive 
simply because it dates from the same period as his great boating picture. As 
for the 19th-Century slump, it suggests the difficulty in making sense of 
contemporaneous, as opposed to historical, artistic events -- a difficulty 
common to any number of museums. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the gold far outweighs the dross in the galleries. The hard, jewel-like 
color of Bassano's early mannerist "Journey to Calvary" (circa 1540) gets my 
wholly arbitrary vote for Best of Show, while the furiously flailing limbs of 
Titian's monumental image of rape, "Tarquin and Lucretia" (1568-71), create a 
disturbing dramatic spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Peter Paul Rubens' small oil on copper, "The Death of Hippolytus" 
(circa 1611), is as startlingly fresh as if it had been painted last week. 
Carlo Dolci's 17th-Century portrait of a contemplative scholar -- a fitting 
subject for a museum at Cambridge -- carries what is surely the most 
beautifully painted shirt collar ever: Like frosted glass, the translucent 
cloth creates a dazzling shadow play for the silver cloak tassel it conceals. 
</P>
<P>
The five medieval manuscripts and the many small bronzes -- especially an 
astonishing 2nd-Century BC figure of a drunken Hercules, which is believed to 
have been broken off the shoulder of a vessel -- are almost uniformly fine. And 
for those whose sensibilities are easily offended, here's a friendly warning: 
Avoid at all costs William Hogarth's delightful pair of paintings, "Before" and 
"After." They're raucously engaging images of a courtly lad and lass, but the 
bracketed event in question would doubtless make Jesse Helms apoplectic. 
</P>
<P>
The sensitively installed show is slightly marred by an annoying glare in the 
main gallery, which makes unobstructed viewing of the large Titian, Van Dyck, 
Guercino and Salvator Rosa difficult at best. (A makeshift space, carved from 
the well of the Ahmanson Building's atrium, the room has no ceiling to support 
adequate lighting.) Still, "Treasures of the Fitzwilliam" demonstrates 
something pivotal about the foundations of the modern era, something its 
"poster boy" makes plain. 
</P>
<P>
Francois-Xavier Fabre was a fashionable and successful painter of the late 18th 
and early 19th centuries. A student of the great neo-classical master, 
Jacques-Louis David, he won the requisite prize for any aspiring French artist 
-- the Premier Grand Prix de Rome -- and promptly left for Italy. He meant to 
insert himself as the inevitable destination for the on-going march of history 
and civilization: Imperial Rome to Renaissance Italy to the neo-classical turn 
of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Fabre's aristocratic portrait of a gentleman, "Allen Smith Seated Above the 
Arno, Contemplating Florence" (1797) is about as straightforward a declaration 
of this path of ascent as could be imagined. The actual identity of the sitter 
has long been in dispute (recent speculation is that he was American, not 
British), but clearly this tourist was a man of means. The picture's 
composition derives from a famous portrait of Goethe, with a notable 
difference: Smith's head, formally posed as a refined profile, is reminiscent 
of an ancient cameo. He is seated on a crude block of stone decorated with 
Egyptian hieroglyphs, a ruined Corinthian capital at his feet and the 
Renaissance city Florence spread out before his steady gaze. 
</P>
<P>
Dressed in period clothes and powdered wig, Smith is also wrapped in a tunic 
that approximates a Greek chiton or a Roman toga. The loping arches of a bridge 
that spans the Arno form a rhythmic procession leading gently to the graceful 
curve of the sitter's hand -- a sitter who has thus been deftly cast by Fabre 
as a living bridge to the classical past. 
</P>
<P>
Although acquired by the Fitzwilliam only in this century, the painting's 1797 
date is roughly coincident with the university museum's 1816 founding. The 
impulse that fueled one also fueled the other. It's easy to see the 
appropriateness of Mr. Smith as "poster boy" for this illuminating exhibition.
