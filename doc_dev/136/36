Now to get back to a subject I would have tackled in the past couple of
weeks except for other matters intervening. I shall not allow the week's
dreary round of comment on the British Budget to deflect me.
Last month, the 75th anniversary of almost everything was celebrated,
including the foundation of the Austrian republic. Never has this November
date seemed so relevant to current events, at least to the Austrian press.
The significance of the collapse of the empire was summarised in the
biggest-selling tabloid, Kurier. It noted that the monarchy's multi-racial
army occupied huge tracts of foreign soil by late-1918 and, 'in a typical
piece of Austrian nonsense,' surrendered in Padua to an Italian army it had
already beaten soundly.
We are still dealing with the consequences of the subsequent collapse:
Czechs and Slovaks pushed into a common state; millions of Hungarians left
as minorities and as potential problems for Romania, Serbia and Slovakia;
and Slovenes and Croats locked into a south Slav state where the Serbs
played the role of victor.
In Bosnia, there began a wave of persecution of those Moslems and Croats who
had been loyal to the monarchy. Austria lost South Tyrol and became 'the
state nobody wanted'; all the natives did want was union with Germany, so
the Nazis entered the country 20 years later under the pretext of
'expressing the true will of Austrians.'
Kurier concluded that the end of the empire was the 'beginning of an endless
tragedy of ethnic and national conflicts in central Europe.'
Die Presse adopted a complementary theme: in a modern Europe free of trade
restrictions, with open frontiers and possessed of a single currency, there
was only one historical precedent that mattered. The Habsburgs had provided
all this for a large part of the continent until 1918.
In the Salzburger Nachrichten, we read that the real anniversary was that of
1,000 years of Austria, which falls in 1996 - the year it plans to enter the
European Union. That, said a contributor to the paper, meant the country
would sacrifice a 'thousand million schillings' and 1,000 years of history
while receiving Ecus in exchange.
So, if Austria was at the centre of the storm which generated all the
European disasters of this century, it also provides the metaphor for a full
European union, for which it will sacrifice itself yet again.
The Dual Monarchy should indeed influence those in Brussels who are creating
a more boring Europe. The Austro-Hungarian model can add a dash of colour
and satisfy Euro-sceptics of different hues.
If Jacques Delors were to become, say, the Count of Brabant, he would appear
an even more attractive figure to the diverse populations of the Union. (The
title might carry with it the captaincy-general of the Belgian football
team).
Articles in Hello, and long-distance shots in the seedier London tabloids of
his wife on distant island beaches, would elevate this somewhat forbidding
figure to celebrity status.
He would be assisted by various new commissioners - the Duke of Connaught
would be the hereditary Commissioner for Peasants and Gentry, and the Duke
of Burgundy would make a fine food and drink supremo. A resurrected
Elector-Palatine would be president of the European Parliament, members of
which he would select personally.
By its very nature, the system would ensure the realisation of certain
socialist aspirations - a 'Europe of regions' would be an inevitable result.
Work sharing and jobs for life are at the core of the concept.
The post of head of state would pose some problems, though. Many would think
twice about a European emperor based in Vienna; but turning Otto von
Habsburg into a Carolingian figurehead enthroned in an already existing
European institutional capital, Strasbourg, would provide a decorative
addition to the scene. The Queen of England, as the first among equals of
European royalty, would supply the balance in the other half of a Dual
Monarchy.
And, finally, we should have a solution for the German problem. The
country's unification has not proved beneficial - it never has - so the
answer is to split it up again.
The old German Democratic Republic could re-emerge in slightly different
form as Prussia; Bavaria could gain what it always wanted - independence of
a sort; and Hamburg would concentrate on making money around the Baltic and
up and down the Elbe. Any number of daft and varied constitutions could be
provided to ensure that subsidiarity flourished.
To conclude with what might be an apocryphal tale, but one which has the
ring of truth: in 1920, a German weekly, presumably Simplicissimus, ran a
competition for the most startling headline of all time. The winner was:
'Archduke Franz Ferdinand Alive: Great War a Mistake.'
The time has come to rectify that mistake.
