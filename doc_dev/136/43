The opening today of four newly painted and reinstalled galleries at the County 
Museum of Art makes all the artworks look like brand-new acquisitions, but one 
painting is the real thing. "St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ and God the 
Father at La Storta," an Italian Baroque altarpiece by Domenichino, is a recent 
gift of the Ahmanson Foundation. The glowing devotional painting, depicting a 
saint at a spellbound moment, goes on view today in the museum's 17th-Century 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of policy, the museum does not disclose prices of new acquisitions, 
but the Domenichino is a rare and beautiful work that many institutions would 
like to have, according to Philip Conisbee, curator of European paintings and 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been a great deal of eyebrow raising in the museum world" over 
LACMA's good fortune in landing the picture, museum director Earl A. Powell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Though not well known and not in fashion, Domenichino's stock is rising. "He 
has been rediscovered in the last 20 years as part of a scholarly 
re-examination of Italian Baroque painting," Conisbee said. This particular 
canvas, which has been in private European collections and was purchased with 
Ahmanson funds from a London dealer, came to light in the early '80s -- just in 
time to be included in the appendix of Richard Spear's monograph on the artist. 
</P>
<P>
The richly colored altarpiece was commissioned for the Church of Gesu in Rome 
by Cardinal Odoardo Farnese in about 1622, the year St. Ignatius Loyola was 
canonized. The painting hung in the church for awhile but was removed during 
Domenichino's lifetime and replaced with a copy made in his studio. Scholars 
believe that the original was privately sold, but records are incomplete.

"St. Ignatius Loyola's Vision of Christ and God the Father at La Storta" 
portrays a priest on a journey in 1537 to Rome where he planned to seek papal 
approval of the new religious order of Jesuits. At La Storta, 10 miles 
northwest of Rome, the priest had a vision of the holy father and son in which 
Christ declared, "I shall be merciful to thee in Rome." 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino has portrayed this episode in the priest's life as a moment of 
divine inspiration. The rapt priest, on his knees, looks up to the heavens 
where he sees God in human form, Christ holding and pointing to a cross (the 
symbol of the Jesuits) and angels. The congregation appears to float in a 
profusion of golden clouds that are composed of cherubic faces. 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino (1581-1641) was born Domenico Zampieri in Bologna. He was the 
favorite pupil of Annibale Carracci and a friend and rival of painter Guido 
Reni, two of whose works are owned by LACMA. They are currently in a traveling 
exhibition, but, upon their return, the museum will display them with the 
Domenichino and two earlier Ahmanson gifts, Georges de La Tour's "Magdalen With 
the Smoking Flame" and Philippe de Champaigne's "St. Augustine." 
</P>
<P>
Domenichino, who painted in a more classical style than Reni, is primarily 
known for frescoes on buildings in Rome and Naples. He did relatively few easel 
paintings. "There are maybe a dozen in the world," Conisbee said. "St. 
Ignatius" is a fine example because of its "classical perfection of form" and 
pristine condition. "Every brush mark is from Domenichino's hand," the curator 
said, noting that the painting had been properly cared for and not repainted by 
restorers. 
</P>
<P>
Three other refurbished galleries opening today display the museum's 
collections of 18th-Century art (including the recently acquired "Portrait of 
the Devin Family" by Louis-Michel van Loo), 19th-Century paintings and 
sculpture and works by the French Romantics.
