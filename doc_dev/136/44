The San Diego Museum of Art has appointed Ellen Smart its first curator of 
Indian paintings. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, 45, will be in charge of about 1,400 Indian paintings and manuscript 
illuminations bequeathed to the museum in 1986 by Edwin Binney III, a former 
museum trustee. 
</P>
<P>
The Binney Collection, valued at $40 million to $50 million, spans more than 
seven centuries of Indian art from Rajasthan to Agra, from a rare, 12th-Century 
manuscript on palm leaves to 20th-Century paintings. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take me a couple of years just to see what's here," said Smart, who 
begins at the museum in May. She will continue doing independent art research 
in Rhode Island until then. Her appointment was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Smart first became acquainted with works in the Binney Collection when she saw 
them in a show in San Francisco in the late 1960s. At the time, she was 
studying for her master's degree at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working with Indian paintings ever since," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The works -- described by museum director Steven Brezzo as "a breathtaking 
addition to the (museum) collection" -- were held in probate until just last 
month, when complex negotiations between the museum, Binney's estate and the 
Massachusetts attorney general's office finally concluded. 
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of highlights from the collection is scheduled at the museum for 
next December. 
</P>
<P>
Smart, a specialist in 16th- and 17th-Century Mughal painting, received her 
Ph.D. in the art and archeology of South Asia from the University of London. 
She has worked as a research curator and a consultant for such institutions as 
the Nelson-Atkins Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the Walters Art 
Gallery in Baltimore. In 1988, she was named a Fulbright Scholar. 
</P>
<P>
Smart's publications range from children's books to articles in scholarly 
journals. According to Brezzo, it was important to find a curator "committed to 
public education" because Indian art has had so little exposure in San Diego.
