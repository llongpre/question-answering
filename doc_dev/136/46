IT IS not tremendously likely, but imagine a day when conservators exercise
complete control over the shape of art exhibitions world wide. Imagine, too,
that the conservators then decreed that historic artifacts should lead
virtually risk-free lives at home.
No more grandiose government-sponsored shows of the like of last year's
Hispania-Austria, which procured hundreds of exceptionally precious
15th-century artifacts from museums in Europe and America, and freighted
them first to Toledo and then to Innsbruck. What kind of art exhibitions
might we then see?
An exhibition of 15th-century Flemish art which has just opened at the
Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge suggests what might be achieved if ever the
age of the jet-setting art-treasure ends. Splendours of Flanders; Late
Medieval Art in Cambridge Collections brings together some 70 exhibits -
panel-paintings, drawings, one well-preserved tapestry, sculpture, coins, an
iron-bound safe on wheels, printed books and illuminated manuscripts.
Unsurprisingly, the largest share of objects belongs to the Fitzwilliam's
own collection, where they can be seen (so long as you arrive on the right
day; the downstairs, with its medieval treasures in the Rothschild Gallery,
is closed in the afternoons.) A significant number of exhibits belong to
colleges and the University Library, and are not readily on view.
Not many Cantabrigians normally manage to inspect Sidney Sussex College's
iron-bound chest. It was brought back in 1607 from a synod in Flanders by a
Master who, like his 20th-century successors, seems to have been concerned
to step up college security. The massive chest had a complex locking
mechanism of three keys which required to be operated in sequence by the
junior bursar, the senior bursar, and the Master himself.
Queen's College has lent the exhibit which is the 'discovery' of the
exhibition; three panels showing scenes from the life of Christ, which would
have been the wings for a large altarpiece. Remarkably, it seems that the
panels may have been in England since before the Reformation.
The show's curators give this rare survival to the Master of the View of
Saint Gudule, a Brussels artist with a fondness for lively scenes and male
figures with features like pug-dogs. In Queen's chapel, the panels can be
viewed only from the front, whereas in the exhibition the saints on the
reverse are also visible.
Among the Fitzwilliam's own Flemish paintings, the most famous is Joos Van
Cleve's Virgin and Child, a lovely image of a baby who seems just that
instant to have fallen asleep on his mother's breast, to her huge
satisfaction. Another more modest Virgin and Child is thought to be by the
Joos's son, Cornelis Van Cleve. 'Daft Cleve' was one of the Flemish artists
who in the far less favourable conditions of the mid-16th century, decided
instead to try his luck in England where (for reasons unknown) he went mad.
Manuscripts and books are unquestionably the strength of the 'Splendours of
Flanders'. Among single leaves detached from illuminated manuscripts are
several by the famous master, Simon Bening. One of his full-page
illuminations of The Annunciation shows in the margin a charming scene of
the Virgin apparently going for a stroll in the countryside, followed by an
angel, presumably carrying her workbox, not her lunchbox.
The Lord of Enghien we see in a full-page illumination in his personal Book
of Hours, kneeling before St Hubert, the patron of hunters. Someone else
paid handsomely for a Bruges manuscript with a fine set of the traditional
Labours of the Month, enlivening the calendar of feastdays and saints' days.
We can only see the book open at September, harvesting grapes, but
photographs of the other months also show scenes of sophisticated urban life
 -driving about in carriages and in May, courting one's mistress with a band
of minstrels.
What I particularly liked about this exhibition is its clear explanation of
the role of medieval religious books, particularly Books of Hours. These
were virtually mass-produced in towns like Bruges, Tournai, or Valenciennes.
Many were exported to England with the addition of English saints, such as
St Thomas Becket. In the Low Countries, ruled for a century by Burgundian
dukes with the keenest appreciation of fine books, it was an essential mark
of social status to own an attractive book of prayers.
The richer the client, the more miniatures and illuminated capitals he or
she could afford, not to mention 'personalised' books in which they and
their name-saints appeared. The skills of even a thoroughly dull painter did
not come cheap. In a fascinating and highly readable book published earlier
this year, Medieval Illuminators and their Methods of Work, (Yale; Pounds
35; 210pp.) Jonathan Alexander points out that in 1463, the celebrated
artist, Simon Marmion, earned enough from illustrating just one manuscript
to have the thatch on his house replaced with tiles.
By no means all the books are religious. The humanist outlook of the
Renaissance is represented by a group of manuscripts which do not come from
Cambridge. They are four superb illuminated manuscripts of classical texts
borrowed from the library established in the 18th century by Thomas Coke of
Holkham Hall in Norfolk. No doubt the famous agriculturalist particularly
enjoyed the page in the Virgil Collected Works which illustrates farmers'
tasks, everything from coppicing to luring a swarm of bees.
The fully illustrated catalogue of the exhibition is well worth having, not
least for an excellent historical introduction narrating how the Dukes of
Burgundy pieced together their great inheritance in the Low Countries, broke
with France, and created a Burgundian 'nation'. (A comparison between the
sexual appetites of Philip the Good and President Kennedy is
thought-provoking.)
Catalogue and exhibition are sponsored by the bank Gemeentekrediet (Credit
Communal) and the Flemish government, which has named the show Cultural
Ambassador for Flanders. Is this the first time that a foreign sponsor has
been willing to pay up for a show which will only be seen in a foreign
country? The Fitzwilliam made clear that the works of art were not going to
go to the Flemings. So the sponsor agreed that is the Flemings who must go
to Cambridge - after all, it is only a short hop to Stanstead. Is this,
then, to be the nature of arts sponsorship in the 21st century?
