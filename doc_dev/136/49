   Two thieves with a talent for disguise and a taste
for Rembrandt and Degas stole 11 paintings valued at upwards of
$100 million in a daring theft from the Isabella Stewart Gardner
Museum.
   But experts say the paintings are so priceless, in one sense
they're worthless. Any legitimate collector or dealer would
recognize them and wouldn't pay a penny, they say.
   ``People make pilgrimages to see these paintings. Scholars and
art lovers know where they belong,'' Constance Lowenthal, executive
director of the International Foundation for Art Research, said
Sunday.
   The theft occurred around 1 a.m. Sunday, when two men apparently
convinced museum guards they were police, then bound them with tape
and made their way to the museum's Dutch room.
   It was seven hours before a cleaning crew discovered the theft.
   The heist was ``a professional job,'' said FBI agent Paul
Cavanagh. ``This is one of those thefts where people actually spent
some time researching and took specific things.''
   He said the investigation would not be limited to the United
States.
   ``It is the biggest Old Master theft in this country, by far,''
said Ms. Lowenthal, whose organization tracks art thefts.
   ``The Gardner Museum is a treasure house,'' she said.
``Everything in it is exceedingly valuable and first-rate and
superb.''
   The value of the missing works, which included an ancient
Chinese beaker, was in the hundreds of millions of dollars, said
Karen Haas, the museum's curator. The police report gave the value
as at least $100 million.
   ``It's not overstating the case to say that these are priceless
works,'' said William Robinson, curator of drawings for Harvard
University's Fogg Art Museum. ``A loss of any of these works is
significant.''
   But their true value cannot be determined because they have not
been on the market for nearly a century.
   The works taken were:
   _ ``The Concert'' by Jan Vermeer.
   _ ``A Lady and A Gentleman in Black,'' ``The Storm on the Sea of
Galilee,'' and a self-portrait by Rembrandt.
   _ ``Landscape with an Obelisk,'' by Govaert Flinck, another
17th-century Dutchman.
   _ ``Leaving the Paddock,'' ``Procession Outside Florence,''
``Three Mounted Jockeys,'' ``Program for an Artistic Soiree,'' and
another, less complete work by the same name, by Edgar Degas.
   _ ``At Tortoni's,'' by Edouard Manet.
   _ A Chinese bronze beaker from the Shang Dynasty, 1,200-1,100
B.C.
   The Rembrandt self-portrait and ``The Storm on the Sea of
Galilee,'' the artist's only seascape, were especially important,
Robinson said.
   He said the theft of the Vermeer also was a major loss because
only about 35 of his works are known to exist.
   Experts said the motive for stealing such well-known pieces
could be ransom or acquisitiveness by a selfish, wealthy art lover.
   ``You hear legends of deranged collectors. But, mostly, I think
it's the stuff of spy novels,'' said Peter Sutton, curator of
European paintings at the nearby Museum of Fine Arts.
   Gardner Museum spokesman Corey Cronin refused to say whether the
works were insured.
   The Gardner Museum, which sits along the graceful green parkway
called the Fenway, has a state-of-the-art security system, and had
two security guards on duty at the time of the theft, Cronin said.
   He said no apparent damage was done to the museum, a four-story
building with a courtyard and a skylight.
   The museum was built to house the collection of the woman whose
name it bears, the widow of John Lowell Gardner, the wealthy son of
the last of Boston's East India merchants.
   Mrs. Gardner lived on the top floor of the mansion until her
death in 1924 at age 85. But she opened her home and its collection
to the public long before then, in 1903.
   The museum collection contains 290 paintings, 280 pieces of
sculpture and various religious objects, period furniture,
textiles, ceramics and documents and books by famous writers and
political figures.
   The last major reported theft involving a musuem occurred in
Paris on June 1, when a Georges Braque worth an estimated $3
million was taken from the National Museum of Modern Art at the
Pompidou Center.
