<HEAD>Trail of Art Treasures Reads Like Hollywood Script</HEAD>

   Lost treasure. International intrigue. A lone
adventurer.
   The script for a Hollywood movie? Nope, this is a job for Willi
A. Kotre, an investigator who followed a trail of musty documents,
Cold War secrets and just plain luck to discover the lost treasure
of the Quedlinburg Cathedral in East Germany.
   ``But please, don't call me Indiana Jones,'' the soft-spoken
German said.
   The 36-year-old Kotre, a researcher for the Prussian Cultural
Heritage Foundation in Berlin, in May pinpointed a local bank as
the place where a dead former U.S. Army officer's heirs were
keeping the missing gifts of Germany's earliest kings.
   Now, the art's original owner, the Lutheran Church of
Quedlinburg, is suing the family of former Lt. Joe T. Meador for
return of the treasures. Meador died in 1980, bequeathing the
artwork to his brother, Jack Meador, and sister, Jane Cook.
   Lawyers for the church contend Meador stole the treasures in the
final days of World War II, mailed them to the U.S. and kept them
in his hometown of Whitewright, about 60 miles north of Dallas.
German officials want to bring the artwork home as a symbol of
German reunification.
   ``It is very difficult to take a historical account and
successfully trace a missing item to an individual,'' Korte said.
``Usually, you need some kind of postwar event _ like someone
trying to sell the art _ and then you have a case.
   ``That's what happened here.''
   An East German who helped in the case, Gunter Wermusch, told The
Dallas Morning News in a telephone interview from Berlin that Nazi
officials hauled the cathedral's treasures into the cave as Allied
troops approached in early 1945.
   Soon after Korte's search began, a London book dealer offered
one of the missing treasures, a 9th-century illuminated manuscript,
to the researcher's employer.
   Officials said the $9 million offer was rejected in late 1988
because of the price and potential problems from buying art taken
from another country. But it provided a clue that the dealer
apparently worked for a U.S. resident, they said.
   Korte said he began looking for detailed accounts of Army units
near Quedlinburg in April 1945. Spending months in the National
Archives records tracing U.S. operations, he then went to the
National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, the military's
service records repository.
   More than 1,000 names of soldiers assigned to the area were
found by Korte in over a week of research. He then turned to East
Germans and medieval art experts for further clues.
   Bavarian manuscript dealer Heribert Tenschert in February was
offered the illuminated manuscript, which had been in Europe
without a buyer for two years, the newspaper said.
   Tenschert said he relayed the offer to the Foundation of the
States, a private German cultural group. The foundation paid $3
million to Houston attorney John T. Torigian in April for the
manuscript, said Aoachim Fischer, a foundation director.
   Torigian termed himself a proxy for an unnamed U.S. client,
Fischer said.
   Dealers left out of the sale immediately began talking, said
Korte.
   ``Eventually, I learned the name of the bank, and it was short
work once I had that,'' he said.
   In May, Korte went to the First National Bank of Whitewright,
which was holding the artwork for the Meador family. Bank president
John Farley said he talked with Korte but gave him no information
about the treasures.
   Checks of his lists and a call to a Grayson County veterans'
group produced Joe Meador's name, said Korte. The Germans
negotiated in successive weeks with the bank and Torigian, who
represents the Meador family, the foundation said.
   But talks stalled on June 16, when word surfaced of a second
manuscript in Switzerland that was offered for $500,000.
   A Dallas judge has barred movement of the artwork.
