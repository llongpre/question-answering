   Three years after the original 1904 Walters Art
Gallery closed for a $6 million overhaul, Baltimore's Renaissance
palace museum has been restored to the glory that railroad magnate
Henry Walters envisioned for one of the greatest private art
collections in the world.
   The renovation has created for Walters' precious jewels,
bronzes, paintings and sculpture _ what gallery director Robert P.
Bergman calls a ``seamless museum environment'' that is easy on the
eye and alluring even to those not trained in art history.
   ``In a lot of ways, we think the public is going to see the
collection for the first time,'' Bergman said recently, pointing
proudly to carefully concealed display spotlights designed to lure
viewers. ``We direct people directly to the object through the
lighting.''
   The massive stone building with a marble-columned court
fashioned after the 17th-century Palazzo Balbi in Genoa, Italy, is
one of six comprehensive museums in the United States. Walters
bequeathed it to the city upon his death in 1931, along with the
22,000-piece collection.
   The leaking roof, blackened marble, drab painted walls and
poorly lighted rooms Bergman inherited when he left an art history
post at Harvard University and arrived here are gone. In their
place stands a pristine and colorful complex of rooms featuring
gleaming stone; rich, silk moire; red, blue and gold cotton damask;
polished woods, glass, lucite and plaster. The works themselves
were carefully conserved to bring out colors and features hidden
for centuries.
   The renovated gallery holds some of the 30,000-object collection
spanning 5,000 years of history. A 1974 addition that stayed open
during the renovation holds many of the works, while thousands more
lie in storage.
   Walters, who made his fortune with the Atlantic Coast Line
Railroad, left the collection _ along with a $3 million endowment _
to his native city ``for the benefit of the people.''
   The works include such masterpieces as one of three surviving
14th-century Italian perspective paintings called ``View of an
Ideal City,'' an early life-size Italian crucifix from the school
of Cimabue, the first Raphael Madonna to come to America and one of
only 12 known paintings by Hugo Van Der Goes.
   Now, however, their future is assured by a climate and
light-controlled environment that is so high-tech that special
louvers regulate the amount of natural light let in by skylights,
and storage spaces for metal works vent outside to prevent
oxidation from destroying other valuable pieces.
   Bergman jokingly calls the project a ``modest calling.''
   ``We wanted to create the finest facility possible for this
collection of Renaissance, Baroque and 18th-century paintings and
sculpture and decorative arts,'' he said.
   ``To do that was a special project. The building is a work of
art. We had to respect at every turn the character of this landmark
structure,'' said the medievalist who moved from the rarified
atmosphere of art history theory to a comfortable position as
ceaseless champion of his world-class museum.
   Bergman is satisfied with the effort, financed with $1 million
in city funds, $1 million in state funds and another $4 million in
contributions. In fact, he considers the workmanship he got for the
money a bargain, pointing out how the wood in new doorways matches
original woods and marble-painted sculpture bases mimic the marble
columns for a consistent look.
   Going room to room, Bergman marvels at the miraculously
preserved royal jewel cabinet in wax and wood made for Marie
Antoinette; a collection of European porcelains considered second
only to the British royal collection at Windsor Castle; and some of
the nearly 1,000 pieces of jewelry spanning the styles from ancient
Egypt to art nouveau.
   The installation includes a 19th-century alcove modeled on a
French goldsmith's shop for Walters' delicate Faberge enamels, an
iris corsage ornament created by Tiffany and Co. and an ivory
orchid comb by Lalique.
   The gallery went up between 1904 and 1909, and before Walters'
death, he would open the doors a few times a month, charge
admission and donate the proceeds to charity just as his father,
who began the collection, had done.
   More recently, the gallery has been drawing 150,000 to 200,000
visitors a year, including 1,500 museum members who celebrated the
official opening on May 15. The first visitors to the reopened
gallery included former employees as well as local visitors
seasoned by a lifetime of trips.
   One after another, they stopped Bergman to thank him for
restoring the collection to splendor.
   ``Just hearing these people convinces me we did the right
thing,'' he said.
