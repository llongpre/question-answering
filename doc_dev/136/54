   The earthquake that devastated several cities and
wiped out villages in Soviet Armenia may have also doomed priceless
medieval art and early Christian churches in the region, an art
historian said.
   ``That area is full of medieval monuments and churches,'' said
Lucy Der Manuelian, professor of Armenian art and architecture at
Tufts University. ``Some are over a thousand years old.''
   Wednesday's earthquake destroyed two-thirds of Leninakan, a city
of 250,000 people 30 miles from the epicenter, and wiped out the
nearby village of Spitak, a Soviet TV correspondent said. Early
estimates put the death toll at 50,000 to 70,000.
   Atop a mountain less than a mile from Leninakan is a 7th century
church called St. Stepanos, which contains rare wall paintings. A
domed church made of rose and brown-colored volcanic stone, St.
Stepanos is a ``priceless treasure,'' Manuelian said.
   She fears it may have been destroyed becaues it is so close to
the quake's center, but she said she has not been able to find out.
   Also within a few miles of Leninakan is an 11th century Marmashen
church and a 13th century monastery called Harich, which has a
museum that may contain priceless medieval gospel manuscripts,
Manuelian said.
   Across the border from Armenia in Eastern Turkey are the ruins of
the 9th century capital city of Armenia, called Ani. Scholars
believe that city's 10th century cathedral may have been the
inspiration for Romanesque and Gothic architecture in Western
Europe, she said.
   Armenia was the first country to make Christianity its official
religion in the year 314, Manuelian said. Its early stone churches
are of special interest because some scholars believe that Europeans
learned the building techniques used on their towering cathedrals
from the Armenians.
   ``The Soviets have been spending million of rubles to restore
these Armenian churches,'' Manuelian said. ``Whatever is destroyed
of medieval Armenian architecture is a terrific loss, because the
ones in Turkey aren't being taken care of.''
