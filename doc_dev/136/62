Clustered in the dark, visitors at the J. Paul Getty Museum watch a colorful 
slide show describing how an ancient Roman villa was buried by the volcanic 
wrath of Mt. Vesuvius. The glorious Villa dei Papiri, they learn, acted as the 
architectural model for the Getty. 
</P>
<P>
Upstairs in a hands-on gallery, Pauline Chambers and her two sons look through 
an original 19th-Century view camera. An instructor extends its accordion-like 
bellows to show how early photographers found their focus. 
</P>
<P>
In a cubicle nearby, Alma Ruiz and two friends gaze at a 13-inch video screen, 
transfixed. Centuries-old artworks, reproduced with the latest laser-disc 
technology, flash before their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
"I love it. I think it's very informative," said Ruiz, using the Getty's new 
"interactive" video about illuminated manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
By tapping the screen with a finger, visitors advance the video's images, 
allowing them the otherwise forbidden luxury of leafing through the fragile 
artworks page by page. Users may also learn all about the books, from how they 
were bound to the meaning of their miniature illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
The recent installation of the video, like the debut of the Getty's hands-on 
gallery and introductory slide show, is part of a revamped educational program, 
one which is now coming into full operation after about five years' work, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to find ways to help people -- who need and want the help -- to 
understand and enjoy the works in our collection. That's the bottom line," said 
Bret Waller, associate director in charge of education and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty's educational program was "very modest" when director John Walsh 
hired Waller in 1985 to begin the improvement process, Walsh said recently. "It 
was a kind of home-grown thing, well done, but not even scratching the surface 
of its potential." 
</P>
<P>
Restructuring, reorganizing and restaffing, Waller and his staff have addressed 
a range of needs, from tours to help visitors find their way around, to bigger 
art history classes, to gallery talks on the art of appreciating fine art. 
</P>
<P>
But the world's wealthiest museum had an obligation that went beyond its own 
audience, Walsh and others thought. Its resources should be used to find 
innovative ways to enrich visitors' trips -- such as a $280,000 interactive 
video -- that could serve as models for museums internationally. 
</P>
<P>
The Getty introduced it's first interactive video in 1986, a tape concerning 
its Greek vase collection. Many other museums use such teaching tools but the 
Getty's videos are more advanced, reproducing detail with greater precision, 
and they contain more information, Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had visits from at least a dozen museum professionals to look at (the 
Greek vase video) and see what they can learn from it -- how much it cost, how 
much time was involved in making it, how you hire an outside firm to produce 
it, as we did," Waller said. 
</P>
<P>
Public education has begun to command more attention -- and funding -- at 
museum's nationwide, said David Ebitz, the Getty's head of education and 
academic affairs. And it will continue to do so in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a limit on what you can acquire, a limit on what's left in private 
hands," he said. "You can't build much more, so you turn to education" and 
conservation. 
</P>
<P>
To discover what their own museum browsers need to deepen their experience of 
art, Getty officials have conducted several studies as well as evaluations to 
gauge the success of their efforts. (Along with 10 other museums nationwide, 
they've also held revealing visitor focus groups. See adjoining story.) 
</P>
<P>
The illuminated manuscripts video, which features live action sequences and 
most of the Getty's manuscripts collection spanning the 5th to the 16th 
centuries, attracted one viewer after another on a recent Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's hands-on gallery was popular too. Like the video's Browsing Room 
(also a place to read about museum collections), this "Information Center" is 
small and often cramped. But administrators "pushed ahead" with such projects 
partly because they are considered experiments for the Getty's new expanded 
Brentwood museum, slated for completion in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
The center will always contain displays that relate to a current exhibit and 
will be staffed with a gregarious educator ready to demonstrate how the items 
on view operate. 
</P>
<P>
"The First Golden Age, 1851-1889," a photography show, is the theme of its 
current display that charts the early days of the medium. Its objects include a 
19th-Century view camera, tinted stereographs -- the first three-dimensional 
images -- and a stereoscope to see them with. 
</P>
<P>
Educator Sara Cannon encouraged visitors to try out the equipment as she 
answered their questions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to have people interact (with the materials) and learn about 
photography, then go into the gallery with greater appreciation of technique 
and artistry," said Cannon, a USC graduate student. "This is one of the few 
hands-on interactive gallery spaces for adults in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Peering into a stereoscope, visitor Diane Faust said she preferred the approach 
over the old stop, look and linger method. "It's boring," she said, " if you 
just walk around."
