News from China for the past few weeks has been so unsettling that one is 
hardly prepared for the exquisite calm that pervades "Imperial Taste: Chinese 
Ceramics From the Percival David Foundation." The rare traveling show of works 
from a renowned London-based collection, at the Los Angeles County Museum of 
Art through Sept. 17, is about as far as one can get from the China of recent 
headlines. 
</P>
<P>
Three curators -- George Kuwayama of LACMA, Tung Wu of the Boston Museum of 
Fine Arts and Rosemary Scott of the Percival David Foundation -- have selected 
58 works from a collection of 1,400 for the jewel-like exhibition. "It's a bit 
of everybody's favorites and a representative group from the collection," Scott 
said at a press preview. "The American curators had an eye on things that are 
not in American collections or rarely seen here, and I pointed out the most 
important pieces in the collection." 
</P>
<P>
Decision by committee? Perhaps, but the show doesn't suffer for it. Though 
works span the 9th to the 18th centuries and styles run from modest to 
flamboyant, the exhibition is a tranquil, sensibly ordered survey. If it 
accomplished nothing else, "Imperial Taste" would serve as a quiet reminder 
that China is a cultural powerhouse despite its turbulent history and extended 
blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
That power comes on with a whisper in 9th- and 10th-Century vessels of definite 
shapes and indefinite colors. This Yue ware (gray-bodied stoneware) includes a 
small grayish vase shaped like a pair of upright fish, a green-gray spittoon 
far too lovely to use and a silvery bowl delicately inscribed with two 
phoenixes. White basins and dishes from the Ding kilns in Hebei province look 
rather like embossed objects, subtly covered with scrolling floral motifs. 
</P>
<P>
A 7-inch-tall guan (official) vase from the Southern Song Dynasty is considered 
"the perfect example of its type," according to Scott, because of its graceful 
shape, pale blue color and a cracked pattern that complements the form. 
</P>
<P>
Such examples of understated beauty suggest that ceramics was a pure art form, 
but others undermine that notion. One 13th-Century vase with notched corners, 
for example, emulates a jade tube, while another vase is patterned after a 
bronze. Both offer evidence of a 13th-Century fascination with the archaic, 
Scott said. Another work that isn't quite as simple as it seems is a 
yellow-glazed porcelain table screen. Though it appears to depict a rooster 
looking for lunch in a garden, it's actually a pun that offers a wish for a 
successful career in government. 
</P>
<P>
Ceramic decoration becomes more complex as the show moves into the 14th 
Century. Monochromatic forms give way to cobalt blue and white porcelains 
sporting convoluted dragons, a wine jar with beaded outlines and lattice-like 
floral reliefs, and various fussy teapots. One of the most elaborately 
decorated pieces is an enamel-painted porcelain dish with the gods of 
happiness, rank and longevity painted in the center and a ring of leaf-shaped 
panels depicting birds and animals. 
</P>

Many of the objects in the show were owned by Chinese emperors and have 
inscriptions to prove it. The late Sir Percival David acquired them over a 
20-year period beginning in the late 1920s. His wife, Lady David, writes in a 
catalogue essay that he was "a born collector" who first visited China in 1924. 
"He instantly became so attracted by the Chinese tradition of art 
connoisseurship that he determined to study it in its highest manifestation, 
the Imperial Collection," which was displayed rather haphazardly in the 
Forbidden City in Beijing. With the blessing of Chinese officials, Sir David 
financed the renovation of a building in the Forbidden City, staged an 
exhibition of the collection there and published a catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
He went back to Britain in 1925, but returned to China in 1927 when rumors 
indicated that parts of the collection might be for sale. According to Lady 
David's rather vague account, Sir David arranged to buy 40 pieces in an 
on-again-off-again deal that involved hostile competitors and the temporary 
jailing of a Japanese dealer who helped him. Those 40 objects are the core of a 
collection that presently numbers 1,400. In 1950, Sir David gave the collection 
and a library on Chinese ceramics to the University of London. The collection 
is now housed in a historic house in the Bloomsbury district of London where it 
is open to the public on weekdays.
