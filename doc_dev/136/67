   The first exhibition to probe the artistic
dialogue between Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque during the years
they collaborated on Cubism has opened at the Museum of Modern Art.
   It is perhaps the most important art event of the season, for
Cubism was possibly a vision that could only have succeeded with
the collective creativity of the two masters.
   ``We were like mountain climbers roped together,'' Braque
recalled.
   ``Almost every evening, either I went to Braque's studio or
Braque came to mine. Each of us had to see what the other had done
during the day,'' Picasso once said.
   Picasso and Braque pushed art beyond its traditional scope to a
pure abstraction. Through Cubism, which utilized cubes and other
geometric shapes to create forms, the two changed modern art.
   The exhibition includes 390 works in all mediums used by both
Picasso (1881-1973) and Braque (1882-1963). The works are on loan
from collections in Moscow, Leningrad, Paris, London, Stockholm,
Prague and Basel, and were also taken from the Museum of Modern
Art's own collection.
   In addition to the Picasso-Braque exhibition, here is a list of
other shows this season at some museums and galleries in the United
