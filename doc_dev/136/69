In 1902, a 22-year old architect, Giles Gilbert Scott, won the competition
to design Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral. Too few people discover the
austere majesty of Scott's Gothic cathedral, one of the largest in the world
and one of the outstanding British buildings of this century. A new museum
has now opened actually inside the cathedral, high above in the right
gallery - properly, the triforium. From the Elizabeth Hoare Gallery,
visitors enjoy a dizzying view of Scott's masterpiece. However, the real
purpose of this unique museum is to celebrate an aspect of Victorian
craftsmanship and design which has hitherto been disastrously neglected.
Thanks to the Elizabeth Hoare Collection, Liverpool now boasts the only
permanent display of classic Victorian and Edwardian embroidery in the
country. The collection is beautifully displayed, a real feast for the eyes.
Sumptuous velvet vestments and altar-frontals glow in deep-dyed hues of
indigo, green, violet and red. Embroideries gleam with artfully stitched
gold thread, made in true medieval fashion, by wrapping gold leaf around
spun silk. Samplers demonstrate the marvellous effects from floss silk and
gold thread.
The museum is truly a window onto a forgotten aspect of Victorian emulation
of the past. In the 1830s and 1840s, first the birth of the Oxford Movement
and then Augustus Pugin's championing of medieval designs, paved the way for
a magnificent flowering of ecclesiastical embroidery. Church furnishings was
a lively issue, and not just in the pages of The Ecclesiologist. The
collection takes the story on as far as the 1940s and '50s. Modern design
may be more austere, yet the specimens from the Hoare Collection and the
cathedral's own are a million miles from the amateurish monstrosities which
disgrace so many parish churches and cathedrals.
Admittedly, ecclesiastical embroidery might sound impossibly arcane.
However, there is a lot more to Liverpool's newest museum. It could be said
to be the nearest thing Britain yet has to a museum of women's art. Many
things remain to be discovered about the world of the Victorian
embroiderers, but it is probably true that most of these pieces were
designed by male architects. At the same time, the actual work of embroidery
is thought to have been women's work, done by skilful lady amateurs who
eagerly joined embroidery gilds as well as by female outworkers working for
the flourishing commercial firms.
Anglican 19th-century nuns, like their medieval forbears, fashioned
vestments for the bishop and exquisite furnishings for God's house. One of
the most superb pieces in the exhibition is a frontal designed by GE Street
and made by the nuns of St Margaret's Convent, East Grinstead. Everyone
remembers that one of Mr Gladstone's interests was rescuing fallen women and
it is piquant to discover that some of them would have ended up in convent
workshops, learning how to bring a faint blush to the cheeks of virgin
saints.
The very survival of this unique collection is due to the vision and energy
of businesswoman Elizabeth Hoare. She began in the early 1960s, when it
would have been difficult to think of a more unfashionable area to collect.
However, Mrs Hoare's interest was both professionally and aesthetically
motivated - indeed, one might even say it was genetic.
In 1874, the firm of Watts &amp; Co. was founded by three well-known architects,
G. F. Bodley, Thomas Garner and George Gilbert Scott, to make fine
furnishings for houses and churches. ('What's in a name' was said to have
been the origin of the name, since for gentlemen architects to put their
name to a shop seemed not quite respectable.) Mrs Hoare is the granddaughter
of Scott the elder and therefore the niece of Giles Gilbert Scott, architect
of Liverpool Cathedral. After an early career as an actress, she took over
the firm after the war and has been fitting out bishops and altars ever
since.
In the 1960s and '70s, the era of the beige, homespun look, it seemed that a
new age of iconoclasm had come upon the church in England. Vicars everywhere
were throwing out Victorian chasubles and frontals, convent workrooms were
closed down, and a quantity of Victorian embroidery ended up in the dustbin
or on the bonfire. In the course of her work in churches, Mrs Hoare was able
to rescue several hundred pieces. They rarely cost her more than the (often
not inconsiderable) effort of carrying them back on the train.
For years, Hoare's Bank in Fleet Street stored the bulky collection in its
vaults. However, the owner always hoped to find a permanent home, partly
from a deep conviction that modern embroiderers lack opportunity to study
what is best in the English tradition. Four years ago, Liverpool Cathedral
ordered some copes from Watts, unaware of the family connection with its own
architect. The offer was made, and to their great credit the cathedral
authorities reacted enthusiastically.
Funds for the transformation of the first triforium (it is hoped that the
second may eventually be used) were raised privately. Donors include; The
Clothworkers' Foundation, Peter Moores Foundation, Ecclesiastical Insurance
Group, and Commercial Union, among others. The tide may have turned; this
long neglected art may yet be appreciated as one of the high points of
English craftsmanship.
