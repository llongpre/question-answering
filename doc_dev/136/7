   The Rev. Friedemann Gosslau
said his heart soared when he heard that medieval artworks
belonging to his church are believed to be in a Texas bank.
   He has complete faith priceless objects that disappeared in 1945
at the end of World War II will be found and restored to his
500-member parish and Quedlinburg's 12th-century cathedral.
   ``We must defend the interests of the church. When the pieces
are here again, we will show them, but this time we'll need help
with security,'' Gosslau said with a smile.
   The treasures, among Germany's most famous artworks, are the
subjects of an international struggle. The Lutheran church in
Quedlinburg has filed suit in Texas to try to recover a collection
that includes a silver, ivory and gold reliquary from the 9th or
10th century, a 10th-century Byzantine rock-crystal flask with
sides shaped like birds, and an ivory comb inlaid with precious
stones.
   It is believed the works were taken to Whitewright, Texas by the
late Joe T. Meador, a former Army lieutenant who served in
Quedlinburg in 1945.
   During the war, the objects were removed from the Romanesque
cathedral to a mine shaft to keep them safe from Allied bombing.
They disappeared in 1945.
   Gosslau came to Quedlinburg 25 years ago and learned about the
missing works by studying cathedral archives.
   ``I thought maybe we'd find traces and then convince the people
to give the pieces back peacefully. I dreamed of it, but I never
counted on it,'' Gosslau said in an interview in his home.
   The Lutheran minister said it was always thought the missing
pieces could have been taken by ordinary Germans during the chaotic
end of the Third Reich; by Nazi SS forces who seized the cathedral
at the start of the war; or by the American soldiers who occupied
the town.
   Then in May there was news that a private West German foundation
that searches for stolen artworks had recovered a 9th-century
illuminated manuscript of the Four Gospels.
   ``We had no idea where it was. It's fantastic news and it's sure
it comes from the church because it is described in the
inventory,'' Gosslau said.
   A second illuminated manuscript also noted in church archives
was recovered in June. Full details of how those works were
recovered have not been made public and they have not been returned
to the church.
   A federal judge Tuesday ordered the First National Bank of
Whitewright to open its vault for inventory by the cathedral.
   ``We were proud of what we have, and about what we didn't have
anymore,'' Gosslau said. ``The cathedral treasure is small, but it
is exquisite.''
   He would like any pieces found in Texas to join the rest of the
treasure that is kept in glass cases in the cool stone vault
constructed in the Middle Ages to hold the priceless objects.
   The part of the collection still in Quedlinburg is a dazzling
display that includes a Syrian vase brought back by crusaders, a
4th-century translation of the Bible, and a 13th-century
gem-encrusted illimunated manuscript.
   In the Middle Ages, the vault guard was a nun trained to watch
over the works, which were used in services that the royal family
attended.
   Tourists taking the cathedral's guided tour are allowed to look
at the treasure vault, a small room with tiny windows at the top of
a staircase on the edge of the nave.
   During a tour this week, the guide did not mention the lost
treasures. Nor were they mentioned in the small guidebook to the
church on sale at the entrance.
   The town had no chance to seek recovery of the lost valuables
once it became part of East Germany in 1949. Contact was limited
until the country's former Communist leaders opened the country's
borders last year.
   ``We knew the crates were broken into and some things taken
away. But we didn't know where they went,'' said Walter Gold, the
city's cultural adviser.
   ``Because the world was divided, we had no contact with the West
so we couldn't do anything about it.''
   The remains of Heinrich I, Germany's first king, and his wife
Mathilde are buried inside the cathedral. Heinrich I died in 936.
   While the cathedral is still state property, Gosslau maintains
that according to old laws the treasure belongs to the parish and
should be returned to the vault.
