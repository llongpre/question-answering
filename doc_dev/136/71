They were the Opulent '80s. The visual arts, a once-esoteric subculture, joined 
the real world, reflecting the Reagan era's love of consumption, prestige and 
self-congratulation. We crowned ourselves in a frenzy of museum building and 
filled our cultural cathedrals with the booty of centuries. Artists joined the 
ranks of the rich and famous. Galleries flourished and auction prices ascended 
into the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
It was gilded and grandiose, but in the end museum directors feared for the 
future of public showplaces. New York's magisterial Metropolitan had a 1989 
deficit of more than $4 million. Tax laws discouraged donations, and auction 
prices shut down institutional collecting. New art lost its way in a maze of 
cross-purposes, and all art was reduced to a commodity increasingly in the 
hands of private investors seeking status, profit or their very own private 
museums. Some boutique museums worked -- like Houston's smart, soulful Menil 
Museum -- but hearts sank when Armand Hammer jerked his promised collection 
away from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to build his own monument in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
It looked like the dawn of the Nasty '90s. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? What went right? What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles matured into a meaningful art center and came to symbolize the 
whole caboodle as the home of the world's richest art institution, the J. Paul 
Getty Trust. With an endowment well in excess of $3 billion, it has an annual 
income of about $150 million -- a sum a Saudi prince would have trouble 
squandering. Among many acquisitions was one of the 10 most expensive works 
auctioned. It paid $35.2 million for Jacopo Pontormo's "Halberdier," but Van 
Gogh and Picasso dominated the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles mirrored a Euro-American cultural axis at the apex of Baroque 
splendor. It built museums with the enthusiasm of medieval worshipers. Art 
itself took on the aspect of a weird secular religion. True believers revered 
its relics. The powerful purchased piety through corporate indulgence. The 
artist Hans Haacke blew the whistle on them, the Ralph Nader of the art world. 
</P>
<P>
Angeltown's greening was signaled by the enchanted Olympic year of '84 with its 
cosmopolitan arts festival. The fine arts had a small part in it, but the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art's lovely Impressionist show, "A Day in the 
Country," captured the mood. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art went through birth traumas. Wrangles over 
architectural control and the loss of its superstar director Pontus Hulten had 
to play out before Richard Koshalek took charge. Now, Arata Isozaki's pretty, 
witty building glitters on Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Earl A. (Rusty) Powell came from Washington to direct the 
steady-as-she-goes County Museum. Now the museum's new Anderson Building by 
Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer and its Japanese Pavilion by Bruce Goff are as exotic as 
the town, but they echo a phenomenon that swept westward from the Berlin Wall 
to the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany probably led the pack, capping its economic miracle with a blitz 
of building, adding nearly 30 new museums by decade's end, including such 
masterworks as James Stirling's muscular Stuttgart Neue Staatsgalerie and Hans 
Hollien's lapidary Stadtisches Museum Abteiberg in Monchengladbach, a burg of 
just 150,000 souls. 
</P>
<P>
Paris gilded its lily with the grandiose art-unfriendly Musee d'Orsay, got it 
right when they housed the legacy of the rebellious Picasso in the 17th-Century 
Hotel Sale and surprised everybody when I. M. Pei's new glass-pyramid entry for 
the Louvre turned out handsome and respectful of its august surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The real spirit of the era began with a national sigh of relief on Inauguration 
Day, 1981, when the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini released American hostages held 
in the Tehran embassy. Self-celebration followed. Art of all stripes acted as 
reassurance that the culture was still rich and powerful even as it felt 
rattled and unsure. The country became conservative and art held up the mirror 
in a revivalist rush into the past. 
</P>
<P>
Art formed cliches of Post-Modernism accompanied by big nostalgic shows devoted 
to the American Renaissance, Louis Comfort Tiffany and decadent Vienna, 1900. A 
paraded pomp of bread-and-circus shows that started in the '70s with "The 
Treasures of Tuthankamun" lumbered on to pretty well culminate with the 
National Gallery's "Treasure Houses of Great Britain" in 1985. By then, rising 
insurance costs and dwindling support had turned such shows, no matter how 
popular, into albino elephants. Some, like the fatuous "The Search for 
Alexander," had been turkeys anyway. 
</P>
<P>
A newer, more nourishing trend was already under way. Serious and revelatory 
surveys of master art proved the most passionate fruit of the decade. Even 
aficionados who had spent their days with noses glued to framing glass were 
astonished by the number of once-in-a-lifetime American exhibitions of great 
old master art: Watteau, Caravaggio, Poussin, Zurbaran, Hals, Velazquez. As 
history moved closer, it focused on the towering figure of Cezanne, the 
heart-stopping testament of Van Gogh, the unavoidable stylishness and exoticism 
of Gauguin. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles viewers, such marvels were both revelation and aggravation 
because witnessing any of them required pilgrimage to Manhattan's Metropolitan 
and Museum of Modern Art and Washington's National Gallery. Los Angeles came a 
long way, but baby we still got a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
We did better -- even astonishingly better -- when it came to totting up the 
short list of the decade's finest modern exhibitions. The originality of a 
revived modern-art program at LACMA ran neck-and-neck with the classicism of 
the Museum of Modern Art. MOMA's great Picasso retrospective, her "Primitivism 
and 20th Century Art" plus "Picasso and Braque," added up to a thoughtful 
probing of fixed tradition. LACMA talked about the present and future in 
exhibitions devoted to near-forgotten, newly relevant movements like the 
Russian avant-garde and Stephanie Barron's German Expressionist sculpture and 
second-generation shows. Maurice Tuchman had the gumption to say that modern 
art had soul in "The Spiritual and Art." The museum reintroduced the dense 
mastery of Max Beckmann in a retrospective no New York museum had the brains to 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
Pluralism turns out to be code for "one fine mess." The art of the moment 
became a chaotic tower of Babel with everybody speaking every conceivable 
language but his own. Babylon babbled on in the accents of fashion, 
entertainment, politics and economics, but it was a rare day when there was a 
sign in the window reading "Man Spricht Kunst" or "On Parle Art." In the end, 
art was deemed more interesting if it attached to a current issue like 
perestroika, AIDS or Japan than because it was good. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art became the West Coast flagship of the Now. Not 
fully launched until 1986, it made great strides, buying its core collection 
from Milan's Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo for $11 million and receiving 
bequests from the estates of Barry Lowen and Taft Schreiber. Everyone wished 
MOCA well, but as the artificial curtain came down on the '80s, the museum 
seemed not to have gained traction. A sense of trying to do too many things at 
once echoed the disarray of the larger world of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
Bogus movements succeeded one another like mannequins parading down a ramp: 
Neo-Expressionism, the Transavantgardia, New Images, Neo-Geo, Appropriation, 
Deconstructivism. Art was reinternationalized and, for what it's worth, a local 
institution exercised broad influence. A generation of Young Turks from CalArts 
under the guruship of John Baldessari spearheaded art that deals in 
word-associated images and social parody via The Media. 
</P>
<P>
The new power of the press to intervene in shaping popular artistic taste was 
never clearer than in the hot, slow summer of '86, when Time and Newsweek 
carried cover stories about the supposed discovery of a cache of supposedly 
secret paintings by Andrew Wyeth. All depicted his longtime model, Helga 
Testorf. The subtextual implication that the grand old conservative of American 
painting had had an affair was enough to ensure the popularity of a museum 
tour. It had nothing to do with art. It was about the yarn. 
</P>
<P>
International bellwether exhibitions proved there are more artists working than 
anybody can keep track of -- or wants to. Germany's Documenta and the Venice 
Biennale suffered from inbreeding and hollow giantism. After 10 years, only a 
handful of such artists stick in the mind: Anselm Kiefer, Jannis Kounellis, 
Richard Long, Jonathan Borofsky, Christian Boltanski -- to name a few of the 
few. Local examples with talent and apparent staying power are as rare as Jill 
Giegerich. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Paris' Pompidou Center organized "Magicians of the Earth." It 
mixed a sprawling melange of jet-set regulars like Nam June Paik with unknown 
Third World folk-style artists and may have been the worst, most incoherent 
circus of the epoch. 
</P>
<P>
Superstar artists flaired and fizzled. A trio of Italians hot at the start were 
half forgotten by the end. Americans like David Salle, Julian Schnabel, Eric 
Fischl and Robert Longo sold in six figures, but after Longo's retrospective at 
LACMA a New York critic wondered if he was washed up with the decade. Green 
talents were launched before they were ready. Jean-Michel Basquiat died from 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Truth to tell, the most memorable art of the '80s came from artists who 
predated it: Frank Stella, Richard Diebenkorn, David Hockney, Lucien Freud, Ed 
Moses, Joe Goode and the artist's architect, Frank Gehry. One of the nicest 
memories comes from '85, when Christo wrapped Paris' ancient Seine bridge, the 
Pont Neuf. Seen at sunset swathed in dull golden fabric, it was like a 
liquefied cocktail of past and present existing in classic harmony. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
The culture went greedy, narcissistic, intensely confrontational, contentious 
and short on civility. Fracturing polarization symbolized by, say, the 
agonizing debate over abortion, signals a society that has lost the ability to 
make the distinctions necessary to arrive at a common set of values. 
</P>
<P>
A French poet, I think it was Valery, when accused of being overly cultivated, 
replied that if civilization fails to become more refined it must become 
brutalized. 
</P>
<P>
In the arts, the decade saw a breakdown of distinctions that breached the 
borders between the various arts, a cross-fertilization that revitalized 
architecture and design but impoverished fine art. Even artists who kept the 
faith found themselves confronted by an audience relieved of the burden of 
being attentive to pesky nuances. After all, it's all the same in the end. It's 
all collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Warhol died, but his sardonically innocent insights about American culture 
proved true. Fame and money. 
</P>
<P>
Public Art turned out to be code for vulgarization. 
</P>
<P>
Vulgarity has the virtue of energy and the vice of self-satisfaction. Now that 
art is like everything else, everybody has a shot at it from John Q. Public to 
The Media and Sen. Klaghorn. The decade has shown where that gets us. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the controversy up in the Bay over Robert Arneson's bust of 
assassinated Mayor George Moscone? What about the wrangle over Maya Lin's 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in D.C., or New York's grinding battle around Richard 
Serra's "Tilted Arc," which was finally removed to the artist's anguish? Around 
here, there was Robert Graham's Olympic Gateway. Critics out to weigh its 
aesthetic worth were surprised at public outrage over pubic specificity. 
</P>
<P>
Remember when the city's manager for cultural affairs, Fred Croton, left the 
post after it was discovered he had exaggerated his qualifications on his 
application? The Getty's respected curator of antiquities, Jiri Frel, was 
allowed to resign quietly after he'd violated museum policies on acquisitions. 
Dreary business. 
</P>
<P>
Gentlemanly John Walsh, director of the Getty Museum, must have been bemused by 
the number of times journalists and dealers besmirched his acqusitions as hot 
or fake. First they went after his Dieric Bouts, then his ancient Greek Kouros 
and a big Aphrodite. Thomas Hoving of Connoisseur magazine led the charge so 
many times it should have gotten funny. Never did. 
</P>
<P>
It does not auger well that the lights go out on a year when the big news was a 
senatorial attack on the National Endowment for the Arts. Hard to forget that 
the Corcoran Gallery did the wrong thing by canceling an endowment-funded show 
of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. Instead of avoiding controversy and 
political interference thereby, they increased it, incensed the art community 
and kicked off a chain of events that ended with legislation restricting 
endowment grants to "obscene or offensive" art, whatever that means. 
</P>
<P>
Means trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody wants to leave a decade on such a sour note. Let's go back to London, to 
the new Clore Gallery for the art of Joseph Mallord William Turner. There is a 
study room there where any citizen willing to wash his fingers can contemplate 
Turner's glorious watercolors, holding them in his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
That's what it's all about. 
</P>
