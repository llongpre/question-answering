For 24 years, the International Committee for Modern Art Museums has met 
annually throughout Europe. The group of museum directors and other leaders in 
the field of modern and contemporary art has convened in Amsterdam, Helsinki 
and Dubrovnik. Committee members have pondered museum issues in Lisbon, 
Dusseldorf, Paris and London. One year, they ventured across the Atlantic Ocean 
to Buenos Aires. But not once have they met in the United States, even though 
about 10% of the organization's 275 members are Americans. 
</P>
<P>
This year, as the committee marks its 25th birthday, the group will not only 
come to the United States, it will bypass New York and convene in Los Angeles. 
CIMAM (the acronym for Comite International Pour les Musees d'Art Moderne) will 
hold its 1990 conference today through next Saturday at Loew's Hotel in Santa 
Monica. Participants will attend lecture sessions at the hotel and visit 
Southern California museums and collections. 
</P>
<P>
Why are they finally coming here? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I have nagged them for three years," said Lyn Kienholz, director of 
the Los Angeles-based California/International Arts Foundation. "I was invited 
to join the organization about 6 1/2 years ago, and I couldn't understand why 
they hadn't met here." Kienholz's foundation, which organizes international art 
exchanges, is facilitating the conference with a committee of Southern 
California museum directors. 
</P>
<P>
Kienholz has had close ties to the European art community for nearly three 
decades, but she said that her dealings with Europeans revealed a persistently 
disappointing perception of Los Angeles. "I kept hearing that nothing of 
interest happened in Los Angeles and that no good art was produced here," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The appointment of Pontus Hulten as the first director of Los Angeles 
Contemporary Museum of Art in 1980 turned the tide, Kienholz said. 
</P>
<P>
Hulten, the founding director of Paris' immensely popular Georges Pompidou 
Center, left MOCA in 1982, but the idea that Los Angeles was becoming an 
exciting art center had caught hold in Europe, she said. The notion gained 
substance when MOCA got its program rolling and opened its new building on 
Grand Avenue, the L.A. County Museum of Art built a new wing for modern and 
contemporary art, and the gallery scene boomed in Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
Conference participants who partake in all scheduled events will be busy 
visiting Watts Towers and a host of museums and collections, including an 
all-day trip to Santa Barbara and another to Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. 
Tonight's inaugural event is the opening of the exhibition "Lee Miller: 
Photographer" at the Santa Monica Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
CIMAM members will also attend lecture sessions on weighty topics. The opening 
program, on Monday morning, is dedicated to "Perspectives on the State of 
Culture at the End of the 20th Century." 
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday morning's session on "Realities of the California Scene," video 
artist Bill Viola will talk about California art and artists, art consultant 
Tamara Thomas will discuss corporate collections and Henry Hopkins, director of 
the Frederick Weisman Art Foundation, will speak about Southern California 
museums. Additionally, Thomas Hines will deliver a lecture, "Los Angeles 
Architecture: The Issue of Tradition in a 20th-Century City." 
</P>
<P>
A Thursday morning session on "Enlightened Sponsorship," featuring speakers 
from Citicorp, the Rockefeller Foundation and the J. Paul Getty Trust, will 
introduce Europeans to American practices of private support for the arts. The 
final session, on Friday morning, will be a round-table discussion on "Present 
Day Developments" with curators and directors of private museums, galleries, 
foundations and study centers. 
</P>
<P>
Following the conference, one group of participants will visit San Francisco 
and about 20 others will accompany Kienholz on a five-day trek through the 
Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
Eighty-four CIMAM members have registered so far, the largest attendance in the 
organization's history, Kienholz said. About half the participants are from 
Western Europe, two dozen live in the Americas or the Caribbean, and the rest 
hail from Japan, the Soviet Union, Israel, Hungary, Poland, Yugoslavia and 
Australia. Most of the foreign participants have never visited the West Coast, 
Kienholz said. 
</P>
<P>
CIMAM board members planned the lecture sessions, while Kienholz and her Los 
Angeles committee have organized housing, transportation, hospitality, art 
tours and funding. 
</P>
<P>
Conference costs, totaling about $200,000, have been offset by contributions of 
money and services from corporations and foundations. The Rockefeller 
Foundation provided $60,000 to bring participants from developing nations to 
Los Angeles. The J. Paul Getty Trust contributed $24,700 to transport CIMAM 
members from East Bloc countries. Other sponsors include Citicorp, the City of 
Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department and Pacific Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
During nine years of work with the California/International Arts Foundation, 
Kienholz has become accustomed to the complications of international projects. 
She organized a show of California sculpture that opened at the 1984 Olympic 
Arts Festival and toured Europe, and she coordinated an exchange of donated 
artworks between the Museum Stuki in Lodz, Poland and the Los Angeles Museum of 
Contemporary Art. She has also produced a film, "A Good Time to Be West," on 
sculptors from California.
