   A collection of priceless religious items that
popes from the Middle Ages to the Baroque era commissioned or
received as gifts goes on display Thursday, the first time many
have been seen in the United States.
   The exhibit at the Walters Art Gallery commemorates the
bicentenntial of the Baltimore Archdiocese and the beginnings of
the Roman Catholic hierarchy in this country.
   ``Since we are celebrating the presence of the papacy on
American shores, every object has been commissioned by or given to
the pope,'' said Robert Bergman, director of the public museum.
   The collection consists of nearly 30 works, most of them created
for use in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, the papal household's
private chapel.
   It includes a ninth-century gold enameled reliquary cross said
to have held pieces of the cross on which Christ was crucified, and
one of the most important medieval enamel objects in existence.
   Also in the collection are two tapestries designed by Raphael,
gold-threaded vestments made for Pope Clement VII (1523-1534) and
several illuminated manuscripts.
   About half the items have never been displayed in the United
States, and most have never been seen together, Bergman said.
   The exhibit, ``Splendor of the Popes: Treasures from the Sistine
Chapel and the Vatican Museums and Library,'' runs through Jan. 7
and is the culmination of two years of negotiations.
   ``It was sort of an elegant ballet of courtesies,'' Bergman
said. ``The negotiations took place on a clerical and
museum-professional level. We benefited from intervention from the
highest levels of the church.''
   The tapestries, vestments, artworks, crucifixes and manuscripts
have been arranged to resemble a chapel. A mock altar has been set
up at the head of the exhibit with tapestries and vestments along
the walls and religious manuscripts and other items in the center.
   ``The exhibit gives you the impression of the cascading levels
of embellishment of the Sistine Chapel that would have descended
from Michelangelo's frescoes,'' Bergman said.
   The two 15-foot tapestries designed by Raphael depict the
stoning of St. Stephen and the conversion of St. Paul, and are part
of a set of 10 made to be hung below Michelangelo's frescoes on the
Sistine Chapel's ceiling.
   ``Raphael's designs for the Sistine tapestries are considered
his most perfected and heroic works,'' Bergman said. ``The
monumental scale of Raphael's figures and their highly energized
character were clearly influenced by Michelangelo's recently
completed ceiling frescoes.''
   The tapestries have had eventful histories. Stolen twice and
taken as far Paris and Constantinople, they were reassembled during
the reign of Pope Paul III (1534-1549). In 1932, Pope Pius XI had
them placed in the Raphael Gallery of the Vatican Museums.
   The reliquary cross was made for Pope Paschal (817-824), and is
one of the Vatican's most precious treasures. It is the highlight
of the Sancta Sanctorum Treasure, a collection of objects and
relics found in the private chapel of the Lateran Basilica, the
seat of the papacy before the 14th century.
   Both the tapestries and the reliquary have never been seen in
the United States.
