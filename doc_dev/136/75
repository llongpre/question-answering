Thirty years ago, the thought that any large American museum would want to
exhibit, let alone collect paintings by obscure early 19th century Danish
artists would be considered a joke along the lines of 'Masterpieces of
Bulgarian Portraiture' or 'Albanian Landscape Painting'. The whims of the
art market and the resourcefulness of scholars have combined to change all
that, as can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the exhibition The
Golden Age of Danish Painting (till April 24).
Although Danish painting has always had a small band of admirers and
supporters (a Danish show was held at the Jeu de Paume in Paris in 1928)
attention was closely paid only during the market boom of the late 1970s and
early 1980s, when forgotten or neglected painters or schools were seized
upon by an art trade hungry for novelty and quality and a surplus of eager
graduate students and museum curators. In addition, Danish pictures
benefited from the emergence of Biedermeier as a 'hot' style of interior
decoration, their small scale and attractive secular subjects making them
the perfect size for intimate rooms of penthouse apartments.
By the mid-1980s, 19th-century Danish painting became chic, promoted by
fashionable galleries in New York and London. Mindful of their heritage, the
Danes made it increasingly difficult for foreigners to obtain export
licences for top Danish works, making the available supply increasingly
expensive - which of course, added to their appeal. Following the dictum
that 'if it's expensive it must be worth buying', museums including the
Louvre, the National Gallery, London, and the Cleveland, Metropolitan and
Getty museums belatedly began to acquire their first Danish paintings.
In 1984/85 the Grand Palais and the National Gallery, London, hosted the
inevitable exhibition Danish Painting: the Golden Age, and ten years later,
it is the Metropolitan's turn following its premiere at the Los Angeles
County Museum. The LA/Met show is tighter and more coherent than the 1984
exhibition, with masterpieces attractively displayed in five intimate
galleries painted in fashionable Biedermeier colours of plum, coffee and
green.
The 'Golden Age' of Danish painting was relatively brief, lasting only the
first 50 years of the 19th century ironically coinciding with an unusually
bleak spell of economic depression and political unrest in Denmark. Although
most Danish artists made the inevitable trek to Rome, producing many
brilliant oil-sketches of the Italian countryside, once back home they
concentrated on depicting pleasant scenes from daily life, sea vistas filled
with ships with blindingly white sails, landscapes of the countryside, and
numerous portraits.
Perhaps the most various of them was Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg
(1783-1853), a pupil of David in Paris who is represented at the Met by all
of the above, plus a small history painting of 'The Return of Odysseus';
several superb male and female academies; and a disquieting moonlit view of
a bridge down which people are running while two women point with alarm to a
scene outside the picture: the catalogue assumes it to be a fire or an
attempted suicide.
Eckersberg's student, Christen Kobke, now considered the leading figure of
the time, is a more sensitive artist, whose rendering of light and
atmosphere are unsurpassed - as can be seen in his two extraordinary views
of the 'Small Tower on Frederiksborg Castle' and the hazy summer 'View of
Dosseringen with a Group of Rushes in the Foreground'.
Running concurrently with the Danish show is Caspar David Friedrich to
Ferdinand Hodler: A Romantic Tradition, comprising of 19th-century German
and Swiss paintings from the Oskar Reinhart Foundation, Winterthur (closes
April 24, reopens at the National Gallery, London, on June 15).
Even among many sophisticated collectors, most German art has been tainted
by innocent association with the cultural politics of Nazism, which
celebrated the 'noble Aryan' artist from Durer down. Official Nazi
propaganda took its cue from much German 19th-century painting, and when the
Metropolitan bravely hosted an exhibition of this neglected period in 1981,
it was ignored by the public.
In the face of public indifference, the Metropolitan gets credit for trying
German art once again, but unfortunately it is hindered by the private,
uneven quality of the Reinhart pictures, which, as presented, will win no
new fans for this esoteric material.
Unhappily hung on white walls in several large, sprawling galleries, the
Reinhart show is twice as large as it should be, padded and diluted with a
distressing number of uninspired work by mediocre painters and minor works
by major artists: the Reinhart Fuseli, 'Jealousy', is dreadful, inferior to
the the Met's own 'Lapland witches'.
Despite this, there is much to give pleasure and several welcome surprises:
notably the landscapes of icy glaciers and valleys in the Alps by the late
18th-century Swiss, Caspar Wolf, and the crisply painted, sun-drenched
landscapes of Italy and Salzburg by the Austrian Ferdinand Georg Waldmuller.
Friedrich is shown in seven examples, highlighted by the famous 'Chalk
Cliffs on Rugen'. A superb vista of the Unter den Linden in Berlin in 1852
by Eduard Gaertner is a worthy successor to Bellotto's views of Dresden and
Warsaw.
Genre painting is represented by the English city and country views by the
Swiss Jacques-Laurent Agasse and by the small equestrian canvases (populated
with doll-like figures) by Wilhelm von Kobell.
After the mid-19th century, much of the individuality of German painting was
lost as influences from France gradually took hold. Some artists, like
Wilhelm Leibl, were talented enough to translate Courbet's earthy realism
into an individual and incisive style, as seen in two fine portraits and a
large political genre scene of careworn peasants consulting a land register,
but more often than not, the loose brushwork of Manet or Monet becomes a
sloshy and unconvincing mannerism in the hands of Frank Bucher, Max
Liebermann, Max Slevogt, Fritz Schider or Fritz von Uhde.
After this, the innovative work of Arnold Bocklin, and especially Ferdinand
Hodler, are a blessed relief, both painters owing little or nothing to
French influence. Rather, Hodler's female portraits, the 'Convalescent' of
1880 and the 'Portrait of Louise-Delphine Duchosal' of 1885 anticipate
Picasso's rose period of some 20 years later; and his extraordinary
'Surprised by the Storm of 1886', where six fashionable ladies and gentlemen
in a tiny boat form an interlocking chain of icy terror as they cling to
each other as the menacing waves rise about them, recalls the tortured
compositions of Stanley Spencer and Paulo Rego.
