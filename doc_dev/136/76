Imagine "Masterpiece Theatre" getting the notion of doing one of its leisurely, 
humane series here in Lotusland. Somehow a city that only slows down for 
gummed-up freeways doesn't quite fit the bill. On the other hand, there are 
places hereabouts that do approximate the program's sense of the past existing 
in the present and chief among them is the Huntington Library and Art Gallery 
in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
In this blessed Camelot anybody can bask in the illusion of being a character 
in "Brideshead Revisited" or a Henry James novel, strolling its rolling 200 
acres of barbered grounds, browsing its famous library or standing in agreeable 
awe before masterpieces of British art like the affectionate favorites "The 
Blue Boy" and "Pinkie." Actually you can't see the boy at the moment as he's 
off the wall for some minor touch-ups. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody can also wonder -- as pleasant as this all is -- if it is still 
culturally relevant in a city increasingly dominated by ethnic diversity and a 
cultural climate grown dubious of the hegemony of Anglo privilege. If anybody 
has the answer then it must be Robert Wark who has wandered the place and 
puttered its inner sanctums for decades as if it were his very own. He's just 
retired at 65 after 34 years as curator of the art collections and has 
witnessed every alteration visited on the Huntington by both history and 
changing times. He says the Huntington has not escaped the exigencies of the 
real world. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks the most dramatic change has been in education. The major symbol of 
this is the big James Irvine Foundation orientation building which opened in 
1981. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first came here what we mainly did for the public was to open the doors 
at 1 o'clock and close them at 4:30. But we have become increasingly concerned 
with making our holdings interesting to the general public. We could do more. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is based on a theme of Anglo-American civilization in an area more 
and more dominated by ethnic minorities who are not part of that or necessarily 
sympathetic to it. The Anglo-American axis was once axiomatic as a cultural 
standard; today the assumption that Anglo culture is automatically blessed is 
no longer accepted. All the more reason to reach out and help people understand 
it as a historical phenomenon. We need to show today's real world that this 
civilization was capable of aspiring to serenity, stability and peace." 
</P>
<P>
He is troubled about the current controversy over the National Endowment for 
the Arts, calling it "a tragic business. If the government is to support the 
arts it should be without strings attached. But I'm more equivocal about it 
than some of my colleagues. Maybe expecting that degree of support from a 
government body is just too much to ask." 
</P>
<P>
Wark retired officially Saturday covered with honors including a lecture series 
created in his name, an acquisitions fund and a ceremonial publication in his 
honor with laudatory essays by colleagues stretching from London's Tate Gallery 
and Victoria and Albert Museum to the Yale's Paul Mellon Centre for British 
art. Former Huntington director James Thorpe said, "No one else has ever made 
such a profound and far-reaching contribution to the progress of art at the 
Huntington since the death of its founders." 
</P>
<P>
It all adds up to the scholarly sphere's equivalent of an Academy Award for 
lifetime achievement. Of course it's not exactly the same thing and thank 
goodness. Oscars are for obvious fame. Wark's encomiums are for quiet 
dedication, careful work and the slow advance of human knowledge. If they have 
any symbolic dimension, they honor the virtues of dignity, self-effacement and 
real accomplishment. In his time, Wark has organized some 100 scholarly 
exhibitions, written a dozen books and catalogues and literally doubled the 
size of the art collection, loading in everything from decorative arts to study 
collections for a total of some 6,000 objects added to the holdings. 
</P>
<P>
But on the eve of his retirement he had a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
Wark strolled the Shakespeare garden the other day talking about his tenure. He 
was wryly witty, vaguely rumpled and unself-consciously elegant as usual, but 
under his half-glasses there was a noticeable shiner. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a collision with a packing crate yesterday. There was something 
significant about it. It occured to me I hadn't had such a mishap since I first 
came here, ran into a crate and broke my toe. There is a certain symmetry in 
that as there was in connection with my first task of conservation, fixing some 
tiny spots on 'The Blue Boy.' At the time I was told it was a natural problem 
that would probably recur in about 30 years. Now it has and the painting is 
down again. A circle seems to have been closed." 
</P>
<P>
He points out that his retirement, while quite real, will not involve him in 
much more that moving about 500 yards from his office in the still-new Virginia 
Steele Scott wing for American art to another office in the library building 
where he will be a senior research associate. 
</P>
<P>
Wark came to the Huntington in 1956 with a joint appointment as curator and 
senior researcher. It was possible for him to pursue both tasks until the late 
'70s when a series of programs he politely calls "exhilarating" ate up more and 
more of his scholarly time, a minus factor in the idyllic column, an add to the 
harried real world quotient. 
</P>
<P>
In 1979, the collection began to expand with a gift from the estate of Judge 
Lucius Peyton Green. It included a brace of French paintings that put the 
Huntington on the continental art map for the first time. Then came 50 American 
pictures from the Virginia Steele Scott foundation and a new pavilion to house 
them. At the moment, Wark is overseeing his final project -- the permanent 
installation of a dining room by the legendary Pasadena craftsman-style 
architects Greene and Greene, plus a gallery of pictures from their collection 
done in collaboration with Randell Makinson, director of the Gamble house. It 
is slated to open in September. 
</P>
<P>
In between, Wark was embroiled in what would certainly be the great crisis in a 
fiction-version of the Huntington -- the disastrous fire of 1985 which singed 
irreplaceable pictures and kept the gallery closed for a year. The 
ever-gentlemanly Wark termed it "a blessing in disguise" because it 
precipitated a long-awaited cleaning of the collection. Wark praised assistance 
lent by the J. Paul Getty Museum's conservation team who came immediately to 
the rescue. They wound up applying their advanced research on 
earthquake-proofing art installations. "The Getty tells us we two are the best 
prepared in case of a temblor," said Wark proudly. 
</P>
<P>
He has witnessed epochal change in Los Angeles' museum world. 
</P>
<P>
"The Norton Simon collections are certainly the most dramatic. He was ambitious 
from the word go. Everyone said it was impossible to form a major collection in 
these times and he simply proved us wrong. It's a staggering achievement for 
one man. 
</P>
<P>
"In some ways he and J. Paul Getty ran on parallel tracks. What Getty left 
forms an interesting contrast." 
</P>
<P>
He would not characterize the higgledy-piggledy confusion of bad Roman 
sculpture and kitschy salon painting that Getty collected personally other than 
to say that, "Well, he was known to be interested in bargains. 
</P>
<P>
"The future rests with that institution and they have splendid opportunities. 
It's an awesome responsibility to live in a fish bowl constantly scrutinized by 
the rest of the art world. I think they always try to act responsibly but it is 
true that witnessing that much power in the hands of a single institution is 
vaguely unsettling on the face of it." 
</P>
<P>
He mused on how the Getty initially established its various institutes, 
educational and conservation programs because they assumed they would never be 
able to spend all their vast income on works of art. Now, with 
multimillion-dollar prices for art becoming commonplace, Wark sees the 
possibility of even the mighty Getty one day being shut out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be the fate of all endowed institutions that operating expenses 
eventually catch up with income. In some ways the Huntington was the Getty of 
the 1920s. For a half-century it managed. I could buy things regularly for the 
first 10 years I was here. Sometimes I go and look at the prices on the old 
invoices when I want to cheer myself up. 
</P>
<P>
"But by 1970, income no longer met the operating budget and now we are heading 
into a major development campaign led by our new director Robert Skotheim. I 
hope the campaign can achieve its ends without changing what people admire in 
the Huntington. It's a very special place. Its basic mission as a specialized 
research center gives it a scholarly direction others can't afford to indulge. 
</P>
<P>
"Other institutions need blockbuster shows to keep people coming. Curators have 
no chance to do scholarship because they are too busy organizing special 
exhibitions. Our attendance stays steady at about a half-million a year. 
Curators ask me how we do it and I say we have a built-in blockbuster in the 
cactus garden alone. The total ambiance is more than the sum of its parts. It 
is a work of art in itself. You don't tinker lightly with the Huntington." 
</P>
<P>
Wark was born in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in 1924 when it was an attractive 
small city of 75,000. His father was a grain inspector and the family was more 
conscious of the ravages of the Depression than he realized at the time. 
Describing himself as a quiet child, he grew up loving music and still plays 
the piano, admitting that, "My personal artistic commitment leans more strongly 
to music than to art." 
</P>
<P>
He attended the University of Alberta which turned out to be a classic 
provincial British college where professors taught in academic robes. "No one 
thought art history needed to be taught. It was the sort of thing a gentleman 
picked up on his own. I studied English literature and history." 
</P>
<P>
He moved to Harvard for graduate study. At age 24, he had never seen a real art 
museum. One look a the university's fabled Fogg Museum and "I was bowled over. 
I knew instantly this was what I wanted to study." 
</P>
<P>
The art history department was at a peak moment, crammed with legendary faculty 
members like the renowned connoisseur Jakob Rosenberg. 
</P>
<P>
"I was greatly influenced by Wilhelm Koehler an expert in Carolingian 
miniatures. In those days, unlike now, the basic introductory course was taught 
by the most senior and eminent faculty member and Koehler taught that course. 
He could lecture for an hour on a single slide and told the teaching assistants 
that if they had more than three slides for a lecture it was an indication of 
being unprepared." 
</P>
<P>
The Ph.D program was rigorously formal and so tough that Wark's class halved in 
size each semester for two years. "Art history is not taught like that anywhere 
anymore. In fact, it's been so long it is probably time for it to come back." 
</P>
<P>
He mused on the state of present scholarship with its heavy emphasis on reading 
the social, political and economic significance of works of art. 
</P>
<P>
"Of course it's not my dish of tea but I've lived long enough to see various 
forms of art-historical investigation come and go. Each one, as they pass along 
leaves behind something permanent and important. The Marxist approach leaves an 
awareness of social context. I was brought up with the feeling that art was 
self-contained and evolved internally so I was missing a lot that art could 
tell me about society. But I think a formalist approach still comes closest to 
the basic appeal of art and I'm troubled by an approach that leaves out the 
issue of quality. If you want to look at art for its socio-economic 
significance, ordinary artifacts are more revealing. The decorative arts 
closely reflect social reality while the fine artist tends to transcend his 
times." 
</P>
<P>
Wark's Harvard mentors nagged him to give up his specialization in British art 
which was considered a minor genre, but he stuck to his convictions and the 
realization that if he wanted to work in this country, the Huntington was about 
his only option. When its then-director John Pomfret invited Wark to visit in 
1955, he took one look and said, "This is it." 
</P>
<P>
"I've never looked back despite some fairly handsome offers to move. I've had 
an incredibly happy career getting paid for doing what I most enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
He's a self-confessed workaholic who never married. He's close to a surviving 
sister whom he visits in summer at a cabin on Pigeon Lake near Edmonton. He 
walks and hikes for recreation, going regularly to a piece of land he owns at 
the foot of Mt. Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing on it but a magnificent oak tree and a stream. I plant things 
there. Sometimes I think I should have been a forest ranger." 
</P>
<P>
Now back to scholarship, Wark plans to concentrate on finishing cataloguing the 
Huntington's British drawings. 
</P>
<P>
"I've found 13,000 already and suspect there are two or three thousand more in 
books and folios in the library. As Kenneth Clark once said, I take more 
pleasure and satisfaction in adding one piece of factual knowledge than in all 
the interpretative writing in the world. Connoisseurship has a bad name now, 
but it does try to get the facts straight. When you find an accurate date for a 
drawing you add something concrete to history."
