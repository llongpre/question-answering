Sated as we are by reviews of the past year and decade, it's a relief to look 
ahead in 1990. Forget about the disappointments of 1989. Here come big 
exhibitions of art by Francis Bacon, John Baldessari, Kasimir Malevich, Henri 
Matisse, Claude Monet and Titian. The Soviets are sending more loan shows from 
their great museums, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is organizing a 
landmark exhibition on "The Fauve Landscape" and the J. Paul Getty Museum is 
planning a special show of ancient Cypriot art. 
</P>
<P>
In short, 1990 offers a typically impressive slate of celebrated names and 
ambitious projects -- particularly if you take a coast-to-coast view of 
exhibition highlights and if you extend both ends of the calendar year. The 
first 1990 event at the County Museum of Art, for example, is a double bill of 
contemporary artists' traveling retrospectives that debuted last year in other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
One is a survey of British artist Francis Bacon's work, organized by the 
Hirshhorn Museum in Washington to mark his 80th birthday in 1989. The eagerly 
awaited celebration of an artist whom many critics consider to be the best 
living painter will be at the County Museum of Art from Feb. 11 to April 29, 
then go to the Museum of Modern Art in New York (May 23-Sept. 4). 
</P>
<P>
"Helen Frankenthaler: A Paintings Retrospective," which honors a New York 
painter known for stained abstractions, premiered at MoMA last year. The show 
of 40 years' work will appear at LACMA from Feb. 11 to April 22, then have its 
final engagement (Nov. 5-Jan. 7, 1991) at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest feather in LACMA's cap this year may turn out to be a brand-new 
exhibition, called "The Fauve Landscape." Judi Freeman, the museum's associate 
curator of 20th-Century art, has selected 175 paintings made between 1904 and 
1906 by artists who were dubbed fauves (wild beasts) because of their use of 
vivid, unnatural color and their modern vision. The show will premiere at the 
County Museum of Art (Oct. 4-Dec. 30) before moving on to the Met (Feb. 14-May 
5, 1991) and the Royal Academy of Art in London, (June 13-Aug. 18, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
Two of the most important 1990 exhibitions at Los Angeles' Museum of 
Contemporary Art are also major traveling shows. One, a long overdue 
retrospective for Los Angeles conceptual artist John Baldessari, was organized 
by MOCA and will appear there first (March 25-June 17). Then the show will set 
out on an exhaustive tour, going to the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art 
(July 12-Sept. 16), the Hirshhorn Museum (Oct. 16-Jan. 6, 1991), the Walker Art 
Center in Minneapolis (Feb. 3-April 28, 1991) and the Whitney Museum of 
American Art in New York (July 10-Sept. 29, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the year, MOCA will honor another internationally known Los 
Angeles artist, Edward Ruscha. His exhibition of about 50 paintings from the 
'80s, which was organized by the Museum Boymans-van Beuningen in Rotterdam and 
the Pompidou Center in Paris, will wind up in Los Angeles (Dec. 9-Feb. 24, 
1991) at the end of an international tour. 
</P>
<P>
As the world grows smaller through speedy transportation and instant 
communication, art shows take to the road almost as routinely as people. This 
tends to homogenize the art scene for frequent fliers, making it appear that 
the same exhibitions eventually pop up in every major city -- right next to 
McDonald's hamburger stands. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Angelenos continually complain -- with justification -- that 
many important exhibitions never come here. The 1990 list of major attractions 
that are not booked in the Southland includes the following: 
</P>
<P>
- "Matisse in Morocco: The Paintings and Drawings, 1912-1913." The exploration 
of a short but vital period of the French modernist's oeuvre will be at 
National Gallery in Washington (March 18-June 3), New York's Museum of Modern 
Art (June 24-Sept. 4), the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts in Moscow (Sept. 28-Nov. 
20) and the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad (Dec. 15-Feb. 15, 1991). The show 
will include 24 paintings -- about half of them from Soviet collections -- and 
36 drawings made while Matisse traveled around a country that he considered an 
earthly paradise. 
</P>
<P>
- "Titian, Prince of Painters." The assembly of 60 works will celebrate the 
Venetian Renaissance master's 500th birthday at the Ducal Palace in Venice 
(June 1-Oct. 7) and the National Gallery (Oct. 28-Jan. 27, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
- "Monet in the '90s: The Series Paintings." Sure to be a popular success, the 
exhibition of 90 paintings will include images of haystacks, the Rouen 
Cathedral, gardens at Giverny and other subjects that Monet painted repeatedly 
during the 1890s. The show will appear at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston 
(Feb. 7-April 29), the Art Institute of Chicago (May 19-July 21) and the Royal 
Academy in London (Sept. 7 to Dec. 9). 
</P>
<P>
- "From Poussin to Matisse: The Russian Taste for French Painting." The 
Hermitage and Pushkin museums have agreed to lend 50 paintings for this 
exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (May 20-July 29) and the Art 
Institute of Chicago (Sept. 8-Nov. 25). 
</P>
<P>
Regrettable as these losses may be, Los Angeles isn't exactly out of the 
traveling show loop. The County Museum of Art has scheduled a staggering array 
of exhibitions to be trucked in from afar. They include "Envisioning America: 
Prints, Drawings and Photography by Georg Grosz and His Contemporaries," 
featuring German Expressionist views of America (April 19-June 24); "Thomas 
Hart Benton: An American Original," a retrospective of 81 paintings by the 
American Regionalist (April 29-July 22) and "The New Vision," 125 innovative 
works by 70 modernist photographers (May 10-July 15). 
</P>
<P>
Also on LACMA's 1990 agenda of traveling shows are "A Primal Spirit: 10 
Contemporary Japanese Sculptors" (June 17-Aug. 26), "Treasures From the 
Fitzwilliam Museum" (June 21-Sept. 9) and "Masterpieces of Impressionism and 
Post-Impressionism: The Annenberg Collection" (Aug. 16-Nov. 4). 
</P>
<P>
The first imported attraction at Armand Hammer's new museum in Westwood, which 
he plans to open in May, will be a landmark retrospective of works by Soviet 
modernist Kasimir Malevich (Nov. 25-Jan. 13, 1991). The exhibition of more than 
100 paintings and works on paper, primarily from Soviet museums, will have its 
first U.S. engagement at the National Gallery in Washington (Sept. 16-Nov. 4) 
and end a three-city tour at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (Feb. 
3-March 24, 1991). 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art will present paintings from the "AMERIKA" series 
by Tim Rollins and KOS, a highly publicized New York workshop for adolescent 
artists (July 8-Sept. 2). Among other imports, MOCA will adapt Ellen 
Sebastian's "Sanctified" performance piece as a collaborative exhibition with 
Betye Saar (April 22-July 22). "The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the 
Aesthetics of Plenty" (Nov. 4-Jan. 13, 1991) will present a British group's 
responses to American technology, mass media and popular culture in a show that 
MOCA has jointly organized with the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, 
UC Berkeley's University Art Museum and the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth 
College. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum will start off the year with "Success Is a Job in 
New York: The Early Art and Business of Andy Warhol" (Jan. 21-March 18). This 
exhibition on Warhol's early development as a designer and artist, featuring 
194 works made between 1945 and 1963, was organized by the Grey Art Gallery at 
New York University. "Tony Cragg: Investigations into Chaos" is a Newport 
production, however, and a big one at that. The first solo American exhibition 
of works by the British sculptor will premiere at the Newport museum (Oct. 
14-Dec. 30) before going on a national tour. 
</P>
<P>
Still other exhibitions are for local consumption only. Out-of-towners will 
have to come here to see them. The California Afro-American Museum, for 
example, will present "The Blues Aesthetic: Black Culture and Modernism," an 
examination of a merger of blues music, black folk culture and modernist 
elements (Jan. 13-March 4). More or less concurrently (Jan. 31-March 3), USC's 
Fisher Art Gallery will offer "Celebrations: Sights and Sounds of Being," an 
exhibition of paintings, prints and sculptures by 25 African-American artists, 
which will be accompanied by taped music. 
</P>
<P>
The J. Paul Getty Museum's exhibition program will continue to offer important 
glimpses of the museum's steadily growing collection in small, comprehensible 
shows. This year's agenda includes "Renaissance and Mannerist Drawings in 
Northern Europe" (Jan. 9-March 25), "The Art of the Written Word: Medieval and 
Renaissance Calligraphy in Illuminated Manuscripts" (Jan. 16-April 1) and 
"Carleton Watkins: Western Landscape and the Classical Vision," a show of 
19th-Century photographs (March 13-May 27). 
</P>
<P>
The Getty generally concentrates on its own art, but this year a rare loan 
exhibition will bring 32 objects from the Cyprus Museum and three from the 
Menil Collection in Houston together with a Getty-owned idol in a special 
exhibition called "Chalcolithic Cyprus" (Feb. 22-April 11). Sculpture and 
pottery dating from 3500 BC will include new finds from excavations at 
Kissonerga on the island of Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
Whether any or all of these exhibitions -- not to mention hundreds of others -- 
will live up to our most optimistic expectations remains to be seen. It's a 
sure thing that both homebound and peripatetic art aficionados can keep very 
busy covering the 1990 scene.
