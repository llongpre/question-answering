and around Monaco is a treat in itself

One of the nicest things about Monaco is its location: clinging to a cliff
on the picturesque Mediterranean with the Italian coast to the east and the
French riviera to the west.
The idea of being able to drive over the border for dinner in a foreign
country is always appealing. Nice, Cannes and Genoa are all within easy
reach. But if you tire of the glitz and gloss of Monte Carlo, there is also
the option of visiting some of the smaller towns and villages along the Cote
d'Azur and inland in rural Provence.
Driving in and around Monaco is a treat in itself thanks to the spectacular
views offered from the the corniches, or coastal roads, which run through
the principality from Nice to Menton. There are three corniches - high,
medium and low depending on the height at which they perch on the
cliffsides. All three are familiar settings from car commercials and Cote
d'Azur movie car chases.
Roquebrune is the first place you come to when leaving Monaco on the western
corniche. It is a 15th century village built around an 11th century castle
complete with a mock medieval tower added by an eccentric English owner in
the 1920s. The village has been colonised by souvenir shops and is now
something of a tourist trap, although the charm of its narrow alleys and
stairways is still apparent when the shops close down at night.
The coastline to the west of Roquebrune is accessible only by foot and
offers a stunning shoreline walk past the white rocks and pine trees of Cap
Martin. The path is called Le Corbusier after the famous modernist architect
who drowned there in the mid-1960s while staying at a house owned by the
Anglo-Irish designer, Eileen Gray.
The next stop after Cap Martin is Menton, the sunny seaside town nestling in
mountains and lemon groves which is, in many ways, a more subdued version of
Monaco. Menton and Roquebrune both belonged to Monaco until the mid-19th
century when they declared their independence. The then Prince of Monaco was
stoned on the streets when he came to reclaim them and later sold them off
to France for FFr4m.
Menton, like Monaco, has an Italianate vieille ville, or old town, with
candy-coloured houses and pretty little chapels. It also sports one of the
most sought-after Salle des Mariages, or register offices, in France
(tel:9357 8787) decorated by Jean Cocteau, the surrealist artist. Cocteau
not only filled the walls with friezes of love stories - from a Saracen
wedding party, to Orpheus and Eurydice - but even carpeted the floor with a
mock-panther skin.
Cocteau also created his own museum for Menton, the Musee Jean Cocteau
(tel:9357 7230), which lies between the vieille ville and the old port. It
houses a fine collection of his drawings, paintings, writing, stage and film
sets.
The corniches to the east of Monaco are also well worth exploring. The
hilltop village of Eze looks wonderful from a distance, with its medieval
houses and churches winding around the natural fortress of its hill. But on
closer inspection it is even kitscher than Roquebrune with a clutter of
souvenir shops and overpriced antique dealers.
Beaulieu, the next town along the coast, has the same sleepy air as Menton.
Its main attractions are the recently renovated Art Deco casino and the
idiosyncratic Villa Kerylos, a replica of a classical Greek villa built in
the early years of this century for Theodore Reinach, an archaeologist who
lived there for 20 years in the same style and dress as an ancient Athenian.
The other coastline folly is Fondation Ephrussi de Rothschild (tel:9301
3399) which perches high above the nouveau riche holiday homes of Cap Ferrat
to house the collections of art and furniture hoarded by the eponymous
Baroness de Rothschild. The baroness, like Theodore Reinach, had a penchant
for ancient Greece. Her pastel pink villa is cluttered with classical
columns, as well as vestiges of almost every period from Tiepolo frescoes,
to Louis XIV furniture and a tiny lover's room tucked away on the ground
floor.
Jean Cocteau crops up again in Villefranche-sur-Mer, yet another picturesque
fishing village to have fallen victim to souvenir shops and tourist traps.
But Villefranche does boast the Chapelle Saint-Pierre, a tiny 14th century
seafront chapel where Cocteau covered the interior walls with abstract
fantasies of Saint Peter frolicking with the Camargue gypsies.
Nice itself is filled with museums and restaurants. The nearby town of
Cagnes is now a jumble of modern villas but was once the home of the
painter, Pierre-Auguste Renoir. His house has been turned into a museum, the
Musee Renoir (tel:9320 6107), which contains his old studio as well as some
of the paintings he did there and pieces by friends, such as Bonnard and
Dufy.
Then there is Saint-Paul-de-Vence, another pretty Provencal hill village
transmogrified into a tourist trap, where the Fondation Maeght (tel:9332
8163) offers one of the best collections of modern art in southern France
with works by Giacometti, Arp and Miro. The foundation, which was created by
a family of Paris art dealers, also stages temporary shows the latest of
which is a Georges Braque exhibition that runs until the autumn.
The last port of call before a longish drive back to Monaco could be La
Colombe d'Or (tel:9332 8002), the Saint-Paul restaurant run by the Roux
family since the 1920s where local artists paid for their meals with their
work. Luckily for the Roux the 'locals' included Picasso, Braque, Chagall
and Miro not to mention Fernand Leger, whose frieze decks the restaurant
terrace, and Alexander Calder, who made a mobile to bob above the swimming
pool.
