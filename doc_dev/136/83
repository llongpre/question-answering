<LEADPARA>  THE Jeu de Paume museum will reopen in June as a state-run exhibit space
devoted to contemporary art.;    Overlooking the Place de la Concorde, the Jeu
de Paume was one of the city's most popular tourist attractions until it
closed in August 1986 to allow its crowded collection of Impressionist
masterpieces to be shipped across the Seine for display in the grander setting
of the Orsay Museum on the Left Bank.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The reasons for the move were both national prestige -- the huge Orsay
museum, built in a former railway station, is devoted entirely to 19th-century
art -- and safety. So many people came to view the Impressionists at the Jeu
de Paume that the paintings were often almost hidden from view, and curators
worried that such crowded and stuffy conditions could damage the canvases.;   
French Culture Minister Jack Lang intends the Jeu de Paume to be a popular
showpiece for contemporary art, a field he is anxious to promote in order to
put France on equal footing with other European countries. He said recently
that Paris needed to have its own equivalent of London's Whitechapel Art
Gallery or the Kunsthalle of major German towns to exhibit contemporary
painting and sculpture.;    The first major exhibit, which opens June 20, is a
show of late works by French artist Jean Dubuffet, who died in 1985 at the age
of 84. Ironically, Dubuffet hated museums.;    The actual building was
constructed in the mid-19th century during the reign of Napoleon III to house
courts for games of jeu de paume, a French form of indoor tennis. The game
fell out of fashion at the end of the century, and the courts were first used
as an art gallery in 1909.;    Rebuilding work was carried out after World War
I, and the Jeu de Paume became a full-fledged museum housing its own
collections in 1922. It later started acquiring major modern paintings and in
1938 housed its first major exhibit, organized with the Museum of Modern Art
in New York.;    Requisitioned by the Germans during World War II, the Jeu de
Paume was used as a warehouse for artworks confiscated from Jewish collections
before they were shipped off to Germany. In 1947 the building was used for the
first time to exhibit major Impressionist paintings.;    The French government
is also to tackle the drab state of the 75-acre Tuileries gardens in which the
Jeu de Paume stands. Three leading landscape gardeners have been chosen to
draw up an extensive restoration project which will be presented to French
President Francois Mitterrand next month.;    Work on sprucing up the gardens,
their 2,600 trees, gravel alleys, lawns and terraces is scheduled to start
this summer and be complete by 1995.  </TEXT>
