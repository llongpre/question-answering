<TEXT>     It's the gripping saga of a flourishing native culture, the clash with its
conquerors and the ultimate reconciliation of the two strains in a synthesis
as beautiful and moving as a fugue.;   Told through about 400 works of art,
this is the story of 3,000 years in the life of Mexico.;   Forgotten America;
In common parlance, nortenos overlook the fact that the country is every bit
as much a part of the American continent as the United States.;   But as
"Mexico: Splendors of Thirty Centuries" demonstrates, the dramatic forging of
the American identity found no better stage than in Mexico, which was home to
one of the continent's most advanced Indian civilizations, bloodiest conquests
and sweetest resolutions.;   By contrast, the U.S. ethos always has been
dominated by the urge to start from scratch, so mainstream artistic trends
have yet to integrate our American Indian roots.;   But not so Mexico, whose
artists have a long tradition of smoothing ethnic differences by grafting the
traditions and customs of one group onto its successor.;   Historical cycle;
"The process of rupture, reintegration, rupture (and) reintegration can be
taken as a leitmotif of the history of Mexico," writes Octavio Paz, the
country's Nobel laureate, in the impressive catalog for "Splendors.";   The
exhibit, which will be on view through Dec. 29, traces this intricate
progression through seven pre-Columbian groups, 300 years of colonial rule and
100 searching years after independence from Spain.;   Such revered modern
masters as Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Frida Kahlo brought the
influence full circle. Melding ancient, folk and European traditions, they
were seeking to give voice to national pride in the wake of the Mexican
Revolution of 1910, but they ended up giving one of the most eloquent
descriptions of what it means to be both native and imported.;   "They showed
how one can bring together the past and present into a visual message that can
be a point of pride," explained Miguel Angel Corzo, now director of the Getty
Conservation Institute but formerly an exhibition organizer.;   In assembling
such an ambitious display, organizers have borrowed from dozens of major
museums in Mexico, Europe and the United States, as well as smaller museums at
far-flung archaeological sites in Mexico.;   "It's possible to see these
things in their homes," said Thomas Lentz, one of four curators installing the
exhibit. "But it would take you years and thousands of miles.";   Besides, the
intrepid traveler would miss all the hoopla surrounding the exhibit, which
comes to Los Angeles after popular runs in two other cities.;   At New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art, which started the exhibit last October,
"Splendors" attracted almost 600,000 visitors, making it a blockbuster,
officials there said.;   And at the San Antonio Museum of Art, where it closed
Aug. 4, the exhibit attracted nearly four times more people in five months
than the museum had seen in its best year.;   "It totally transformed San
Antonio," said Marion Oettinger, the museum's director.;   In Los Angeles, the
reception is expected to be no less spectacular.;   The largest exhibit ever
mounted at the museum, it will fill the museum's three main exhibition spaces,
spilling from the Robert O. Anderson to the Frances and Armand Hammer
buildings.;   The exhibit is so vast, so varied that even seasoned veterans
such as Virginia Fields, the museum's resident pre-Columbian expert, hadn't
seen some of the pieces before she unpacked them.;   "She'd go, 'Oh, my gosh,
I didn't realize it looked like this,' " Lentz said.;   Under any
circumstances, the exhibit spanning from 1000 B.C. to 1950 would be expected
to find an enthusiastic following among people of Mexican heritage, and the
museum is leaving nothing to chance.; Bilingual signs;   In an unprecedented
move, the museum is printing the exhibit's descriptive text in both Spanish
and English. It also has signed on bilingual docents to accommodate an
anticipated crush of Spanish-speaking visitors from Mexico as well as Los
Angeles and other parts of California.;   "In many ways, it will be a matter
of pride to see another country become so excited about one's cultural
heritage," Lentz said.;   It has been 27 years since the museum has staged a
overview of Mexican art from pre-Columbian to modern times. But by some
accounts, there hasn't been a comparable look at Mexican art since the
Metropolitan Museum of Art mounted "Twenty Centuries of Mexican Art" in 1940.;
  However it stacks up against previous Mexican exhibitions, "Splendors" can
already boast an unprecedented effect, having touched off a whole series of
events spotlighting Mexican and Mexican-American culture through February.;  
More than 300 lectures, films, exhibits and performances organized under two
banners -- "Artes de Mexico," a locally organized celebration; and "Mexico: A
Work of Art," a celebration that received support from the Mexican government
-- will complement the exhibit.;   Greater understanding;   Originally
proposed by the Friends of the Arts of Mexico, a U.S. foundation dedicated to
promoting awareness of Mexican culture, "Splendors" is designed to awaken a
deeper understanding of the country.;   "We wanted to have an exhibition that
would show Mexico and its very important historical contribution," explained
Miguel Angel Curzo, who was president of Friends of the Arts of Mexico during
that period. "There are very few countries that can boast 30 centuries of
constant artistic evolution, especially starting at the high level that this
exhibit does.";   Ultimately, however, the most lasting lesson may be the
beauty of synthesis, a lesson that, when ethnic and racial tensions dominate
local headlines, couldn't be better timed.;   "We haven't reconciled these two
worlds to the extent Mexico has," said Julie Jones, a curator at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art who helped assemble the exhibit.;   The story
begins in 1000 B.C. with massive stone sculptures carved by Olmecs, the
founders of the first complex civilization in the Americas.;   It will be
impossible to miss the 5-ton Colossal Head, a thick-featured head of an Olmec
man that stands 5 feet tall. Stunningly modern-looking, the highly stylized,
helmeted statue that probably had some religious connotation looks as though
it were carved in the 1920s to immortalize a football player.;   The head,
like the equally weighty Olmec "Seated Figure," exemplifies the organizers'
concerted effort to include large stone sculptures from every pre-Columbian
site represented.;   There is a 6-foot stela from Monte Alban near Oaxaca, a
6-foot column from El Tajin on the Mexican Gulf, a choice Chacmool statue from
Chichen Itza in the Yucatan, and so on.;   Themes -- such as the plumed
serpent, a god revered in one form or another by so many Indian cultures --
surface, disappear and then re-emerge transformed, from a first-century Olmec
burial urn, to a 10th-century bas relief from Veracruz to a 16th-century
sculpture from Tenochtitlan.;   Likewise, sensibilities repeat over and over
again in the manner of a haunting melody. No sooner will you shake the chill
of a hideously disfigured Olmec deity, than the old Mexican fascination with
the macabre will raise its head in the form of intricately carved,
2,000-year-old human bones. Or in the 19th-century cartoons by Mexico's master
caricaturist Jose Guadalupe Posada. Or in Kahlo's deliciously gruesome stabs
at exorcising the pain of crippling spinal injury and resulting
childlessness.;   (box); IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; "Mexico: Splendors of Thirty
Centuries" will be on view through Dec. 29 at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art. Call (213) 857-6000 for more information.  </TEXT>
