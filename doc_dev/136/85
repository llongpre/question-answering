<F P=106> [Commentary by Gianni Baget Bozzo: "Europe and the </F>
Countries of the East"] 
  [Text] The issue of the Italian ministers belonging to the 
National Alliance has created a controversy with regard to the 
elections to the European Parliament. Having raised some 
problems in the field of public ethics, Italy now poses a 
growing issue with regard to Europe's identity as a community 
based on certain values. But it is not Italy alone that makes 
the 1994 elections different from all its predecessors. 
  Now Europe extends no longer from the Atlantic to the Elbe, 
but from the Atlantic to Vladivostok, the city where 
Solzhenitsyn is deliberately beginning his voyage of rediscovery 
through Russia. Basically, this strengthens the cohesion and 
force of attraction of the Twelve. As long as the communist 
empire existed, the Russian system had a rigid and limited 
scope. Now between the borders of Russia and those of the 
European Union [EU] there extends a no man's land that is bound 
neither to the West nor to the East and that is seeking links 
with the West because it fears another Russian era in the 
European East. 
  It is as a consequence of this innovation in the East that 
the innovation in the north has occurred: The Nordic countries 
and Austria are becoming part of the Community, while other 
countries of the East have applied. The EU may become a focal 
point on the continent in the face of possible developments in 
Russia. 
  What is certain is that Russia will try to regain influence 
over the lands of the former USSR, offering as an alternative to 
the West a guarantee of balance in the East. But this is no 
easy objective, because Ukraine is a difficult problem to 
resolve. Be that as it may, the East, starting with Russia, is 
in a state of flux, and this is causing a real change in the 
Europe of the Twelve. 
  Postcommunist parties are in power in all the countries of 
the East that aspire to join the Union, apart from the Czech 
Republic. 
  This does not mean that the membership of the countries of 
the East is imminent, because it is impossible for them to 
implement EU policies, starting with agriculture. But it does 
mean that Europe will be governed by different systems of 
association with the Community, which already exist within the 
EU as a result of the exemptions granted to the British and 
especially the Danish in order to secure their adherence to the 
Maastricht Treaty. 
  National differences are therefore destined to prevail. For 
that matter, the principle of subsidiarity established in 
Maastricht is basically the reverse of the principle of 
federalism. Under European federalism it is a virtue to 
transfer responsibilities from the nations to the European 
authorities: Under the principle of subsidiarity, the opposite 
is true. In any case, in Italy's domestic debate federalism 
correctly means increasing local powers to the detriment of the 
central authorities. In some European countries, the principle 
of subsidiarity established in Maastricht is cited as an 
addition to the responsibilities of local authorities. The era 
of European federalism seems to have come to an end, and what is 
starting now is basically similar to an ancient institution, 
that of the "European concert of nations," in other words, the 
accord among the major European states to establish the common 
interests of the whole. 
  The protagonists of this European concert of nations can 
already be seen: They are Germany and France. The old 
Carolingian Europe is at the center of the new European system, 
particularly because it has determined its course. And it is 
certainly Germany that is steering events: If Chancellor Kohl 
wins the elections, it will be not because he is Adenauer's 
successor, but because he has radically updated policy, pushing 
Germany eastward in accordance with an ancient tendency -- 
Germany as organizer of the Slavic world. 
  From the viewpoint of the Community institutions, this means 
an increase in intergovernmental activity, that is, in the role 
of the Council of Ministers and of the permanent 
representatives. For that matter, in the years before 
Maastricht the most important event, established in the Single 
Act of 1985, was political cooperation, that is, a body not 
envisaged by the treaties, which established permanent meetings 
on all matters of common interest on the part of the foreign 
ministers of the Twelve. Maastricht incorporated this 
institution into the Treaty of Rome, and perhaps this is one of 
the most significant modifications. 
  Overall European cooperation, at the military level too, 
will 
become all the more demanding as America's foreign policy 
becomes vaguer with the accession to power of the Vietnam 
generation: The "new order" and the "unipolar world" envisaged 
by Bush's strategists lasted less than a year. Now Europe must 
provide with its own forces. The terrible tragedy in Bosnia, 
far from being over, will cause us further difficult times, when 
we can even foresee a European disengagement, open warfare 
between the sides involved, and an end to the arms embargo. It 
is a very different Europe from that of 1989 that is about to 
elect its fourth Parliament.
