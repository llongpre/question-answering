<TEXT>   -- inscription on a plaque outside the Judah L.; Magnes Memorial Museum in
Berkeley.; THE contrasting styles and intricate designs of the Hanukkah
menorahs on display in the museum's Holiday Room say a lot more about Jewish
people, history and traditions than simply the ritual of lighting these
nine-branched lamps during what is actually a minor Jewish festival.;   One
lamp, carved from stone, was made in Morocco in the 19th century. Another is a
14th-century brass lamp from Spain. There also are 19th-century Cochin Indian
menorah candles and 20th-century Israeli candleholders formed from silver
spoons. There is even a relief of a menorah, carved out of stone, that was
part of a door lintel.;   The Festival of Lights -- beginning Sunday at
sundown and lasting eight days -- commemorates the successful Maccabean revolt
against the Syrian ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, in the year 167 B.C. The only
non-biblical Jewish festival, it focuses on the legendary miracle of one day's
supply of oil lasting eight days.;   Thus, the menorah, a stylized ritual
object, takes on a seemingly infinite variety of appearances and is well
represented here in the Judah L. Magnes Memorial Museum, known by many as "the
Jewish Museum of the West.";   "The lamps on exhibit in the Holiday Room
represent a very small portion of our collection," says museum registrar Marni
Welch. "We have more than 200 Hanukkah lamps in our permanent collection.";  
But the message to visitors, researchers and the curious is much broader. The
museum's goal is to reflect "Jewish life and cultural contributions throughout
history.";   Casually pointing out Torah cases from Egypt, Morocco and North
Africa, museum publicist Paula Friedman says, "The museum sends rescue
missions to places throughout the world where the Jewish race is
disappearing.";   It has been doing that sort of thing for nearly 30 years.
Named for a San Francisco native ordained as the first U.S. rabbi from the
Western states, this remarkable collection brings together under one roof
thousands of Jewish artifacts, paintings, books and sculptures -- as well as
the world's largest library of Western U.S. Jewish history.;   In 1962, that
roof covered two rooms above an Oakland movie house. Today it's the redwood
roof of a renovated Berkeley mansion surrounded by an ivy-covered brick wall
and beautifully landscaped grounds.;   Haunting Holocaust artifacts are on
display in the "Room of Remembrance," including a concentration camp
prisoner's uniform, a detailed figure carved by a prisoner with a penknife and
"Abraham," a German wood sculpture that reeks of anti-Semitism.;   Less
visually spectacular -- but far more impressive -- is the collection of books,
archives and oral histories of the Jewish people in the Western states. The
latest additions are a series of oral histories of "Jewish Women in the
Military, World War II.";   "Researchers doing dissertations, school papers
and family genealogies and authors getting background material for their books
are coming through here all the time," says Ruth Rafael, the library's head
archivist.;   The new land;   This collection also includes an extensive --
and constantly growing -- series of oral histories and archives that trace the
Jewish arrival in California back to the Gold Rush. An exhaustive photo file
includes a 1932 photo of two grizzled miners at the Last Chance Mine in Placer
County, the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. Building in 1880 and a gathering of proud,
muscular young iron pumpers at San Francisco's Young Men's Hebrew Association
in 1902.;   The library volunteers who come through this top-floor facility --
a children's playroom when the building was a private home -- are also engaged
in a daunting attempt to put together a collection of every Jewish periodical
published in California -- all on microfilm.;   "We already have a good
collection," says Rafael. "We have a complete collection of the Emmanuel, a
San Francisco paper going back to 1895." It's now the Northern California
Jewish Bulletin.;   And Ava Kahn, a research associate with a doctorate in
history, is working here under a private grant to put together a course on the
history of Bay Area Jewish communities, to be taught in Jewish day schools,
Sunday schools and Hebrew schools.;   "We hope to introduce it to public
school systems as well," she says. "Many are getting increasingly involved in
ethnicity.";   The museum also regularly displays traveling exhibits that
represent Jewish life, artists, writers and themes. Offerings currently on
display include "In the Footsteps of Columbus: Jews in America, 1654-1880" --
a collection of more than 350 photos, documents, paintings and objects tracing
the roots and development of Jewish life in this country -- and "Under the
Scuds," grim drawings by Israeli and Palestinian school children portraying
their chilling memories of the Persian Gulf war.";   Reaching the community;  
And Welch, the registrar, stresses that no more than 1 to 5 percent of the
museum's permanent collection is ever on display. More overwhelming
statistics: There are about 10,000 objects in the collection, 20,000 pieces in
the Western Jewish History Center and 20,000 more in the Rare Book and
Manuscript Library.;   Most are carefully stored in "state of the art"
climate-controlled and earthquake-resistant storage rooms and vaults. "We have
some really wonderful and beautiful objects," says Welch. "My job is to
preserve them. If museums were run by the registrars everything would be
locked in dark closets and nobody would see them.";   Instead, the museum also
features poetry readings, awards ceremonies and a "docent outreach program"
that brings parts of the collection into the community. One such program,
"Light the Hanukkah Lamps," is a slide-show portrayal of the museum's Hanukkah
ceremonial objects.;   And yes, Hanukkah does come early this year, but
Friedman, the museum's publicist, points out that it's never too late for some
last-minute holiday shopping. "We have menorahs in the gift shop ranging in
price from $10 to $200," she notes, "and don't forget, the festival goes on
for eight days."; IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Judah L. Magnes Memorial Museum is
