The Victoria &amp; Albert's unparalleled ironwork collection is housed in one of
the oddest spaces in any museum. Spanning the entire 220m width of the
building at first-floor level and at times less than five metres wide, it is
more flyover than gallery, top lit by glass domes and pierced by light wells
affording unexpected bird's-eye-views of the galleries below.
Two years ago the space was closed for essential repairs to the roof.
Yesterday, the re-displayed Ironwork Gallery re-opened to reveal what is one
of the most visually stimulating galleries the museum has to offer - at
least in part. Funding has only been available for the first phase of the
project, and none forthcoming for an accompanying catalogue. Indeed no
publication on this extraordinary collection is currently in print.
As if to emphasise the lack of cash, the display ends abruptly with a
stencil representation of the massive screen designed by George Gilbert
Scott for Hereford Cathedral. This tour-de-force of Gothic Revival metalwork
still languishes in store awaiting a sponsor for its restoration. The sole
elements in place over the stencil, like 3D jigsaw pieces, are the
'terracotta' figures of Christ and a Choir of Angels ingeniously
manufactured out of electroformed copper.
Dismantled and removed from the cathedral in 1967, the Hereford screen is
also eloquent witness to the metalwork department's enterprise in
architectural salvage on a monumental scale. Many of its treasures are here
as a result of church and state's cavalier disregard for its heritage - from
the 13th-century wrought-iron grilles from Chichester Cathedral rescued from
a scrap-metal merchant in 1896, to an Art Nouveau fireplace designed around
1904 by Charles Rennie Mackintosh and pulled out of the Willow Street Tea
Rooms in Glasgow before they were demolished.
A 12th-century wooden chest ornamented and protected by elaborate
S-scrolling iron hinges and latchwork came from the derelict St Albans
Abbey; the 17th-century polychrome chandelier rods on display once adorned
Wren's St Michael Queenhithe, demolished in 1876. Garden gates stand as a
solitary survivor of Robert Adam's Lansdowne House in Berkeley Square; the
elegant neo-Classical lampholder a poignant reminder of one of the London's
most tragic losses, the Adams' Adelphi buildings off the Strand. This sad
litany continues with the disembodied balconies, balusters and grilles from
France, Italy, Germany and Spain.
Most of the collection, of predominantly wrought rather than cast iron from
1600-1800, was acquired by the museum 1860-1930, often through the agency of
passionate preservationists. Perhaps the unlikeliest Albert Steptoe of all
was the pioneering Lady Dorothy Nevill, who saw her mission as relieving
workers' cottages on the Weald of their 16th-century decorative cast-iron
firebacks and presenting them to the nation in 1914.
The museum's mission was, of course, to improve modern design and
manufactures by exhibiting the finest examples of the arts of the past and
present. In this sense the V&amp;A itself was - and is - an exhibit. On show,
for instance, is one of the ropework cast-iron radiator panels with their
curious hermaphroditic friezes designed by Alfred Stevens for the museum
around 1862. The department's most recent commission, a steel bench by the
American artist Albert Paley, is due to arrive in late October.
James Horrobin's impressive hammered gates to the gallery of 1981 are
evidence of the relatively recent flowering of contemporary blacksmithing in
Britain, a phenomenon that makes the abysmal design and poor execution of
the new Queen Elizabeth Gates in Hyde Park as bewildering as they are a
wasted opportunity. Their only saving grace is as a reminder that decorative
ironwork was traditionally painted and gilt; black was late Victorian
convention.
It is, however, the stark contrast of the black, calligraphic lines of
wrought iron imaginatively set against white walls that provides the gallery
with its immediate drama. Its eclectic collections of smaller ironwork
warrant closer inspection: fiendishly complex medieval and renaissance locks
and keys take their place alongside gleaming 16th-century Venetian gondola
prows, the dull, delicate filigree of Berlin iron jewellery and jolly
turn-of-the-century biscuit tins.
Black-stained wooden display cases are re-used from the old Glass Gallery,
the first of the V&amp;A's 'materials and techniques' galleries to be
re-displayed. These, plus the gimmick-free simplicity of the new
installation, are virtues born of necessity.
