COLMAR, France 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In this region of France known as Alsace, the song of the open road is "Roll 
Out The Barrel." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, spirits are high along the Route du Vin, which is to say the grape 
lover's highway between Strasbourg and Colmar, a path strewn with dozens of 
little wine-producing villages that appear like sketches culled from a book of 
fairy tales. 
</P>
<P>
The journey represents one of life's joys, a time for toasting one's companion 
with the wines of Alsace while exploring narrow, cobbled streets and ancient 
half-timbered buildings that Alsatians seriously believe inspired the brothers 
Grimm. 
</P>
<P>
Barely 75 miles long, the Route du Vin is a slice of history, a glimpse of 
medieval Europe. There comes to mind Turckheim, a village on the outskirts of 
Colmar that reflects a period when such towns were walled, as indeed is the 
case today in Turckheim. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic funnels through 800-year-old gates; the sun reflects off slate roofs, 
and Turckheim's cobbled streets are crowded with visitors who take shelter at 
Hotel des Deux Clefs, just as they have for nearly 400 years. 
</P>
<P>
At Hotel des Deux Clefs, guests awaken to the tolling of church bells and 
gather of an afternoon in the bar, which also serves as the reception, to taste 
the wines of Alsace in a setting of timbered walls and leaded windows. 
</P>
<P>
One enters Turckheim down a cobbled street where a fountain flows only steps 
from a verdant square facing Hotel des Deux Clefs. Inside the bar/restaurant, 
the room is alive with the music of Johann Strauss, and we found the comely 
proprietress, Marie-Claire Planel-Arnoux, busily arranging flowers fresh from 
her garden. 
</P>
<P>
Classical melodies continued to set the mood throughout the day in this former 
coaching stop, with its fine wines and a menu that features sauerkraut, 
sausage, pork, guenelles de foie and coq au Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
The stairway leading to guest rooms creaks with one's footsteps, reminding 
visitors that generations have passed this way and that others will follow, but 
that this particular moment is precious, a split second in Turckheim's history 
and that you are part of it, and that it will not be played again. A mere 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
In the dining room and outside in the garden, guests spend entire afternoons 
over lunch, divorced from fast-paced cities beyond the gates of Turckheim. 
</P>
<P>
The garden is particularly pleasant on a sunny afternoon. Flowers flow from a 
bucket suspended above a well, and ivy climbs ancient walls. Later, strings of 
colored light add to the magic as the sun disappears and darkness softens the 
scene and church bells toll once more. 
</P>
<P>
With darkness, the last town crier remaining in all of France emerges from a 
guardhouse, a ghostly figure in a flowing cloak, swinging a lantern whose 
yellow glow casts eerie shadows against ancient walls while the crier calls to 
a gathering crowd, "All's well!", his words echoing through vacant streets like 
the uttering of a spirit braced against the chill wind that whips the folds of 
the crier's cloak, nearly snuffing out his lantern. 
</P>
<P>
For another half-hour, the group traces his footsteps until, finally, the crier 
returns to the guardhouse, calling out once again, "All's well!" before 
disappearing through a darkened doorway. 
</P>
<P>
Stars shine brightly as the group returns to Hotel des Deux Clefs for brandies, 
later climbing the creaking stairway to slip beneath thick eiderdowns as church 
bells toll the midnight hour. 
</P>
<P>
From Colmar, the Route du Vin skirts other ancient villages and churches with 
their baroque steeples and half-timbered homes and hotels that reach across 
Alsace. Cattle graze beside the road and vineyards sweep to the Vosges, the 
mountain range that forms the western extension of the Black Forest. 
</P>
<P>
Castles rising on wooded hillsides face mile upon mile of gingerbread villages, 
and fragrant breezes stir among the narrow streets of Eguisheim and 
Kaysersberg, which was the birthplace of Albert Schweitzer, the jungle doctor 
whose home functions as a museum, drawing legions of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
During the high season, tour buses crowd the streets, bumper-to-bumper, outside 
the gates of Riquewihr, a village that's a flashback to the 16th Century, its 
ancient walls surrounding cobbled paths lined with sidewalk cafes and 
half-timbered houses that sag with age. 
</P>
<P>
To avoid the tour groups it is best to remain overnight in Riquewihr. Indeed, 
Riquewihr is best enjoyed in the late afternoon and particularly in the evening 
when lights glow through amber and leaded windows, fires blaze warmly in 
restaurants with smoke-stained walls, and the village is at peace again. 
</P>
<P>
One can, of course, avoid crowds during daytime by taking to the side streets 
with their topsy-turvy homes and window boxes crowded with geraniums and other 
blooms. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel St. Nicholas at 2 Rue St. Nicholas is a pleasant, unpretentious hideaway 
facing a quiet path, its inviting lounge and spotless rooms providing peace in 
an atmosphere that harkens back to a century when coaches rattled through 
Riquewihr and horses' hoofs echoed along its narrow paths. 
</P>
<P>
Other travelers return of an evening to Colmar, the capital of Alsatian wine 
whose cobbled streets pass beneath half-timbered houses in a medieval setting 
unrivaled along the entire Route du Vin. 
</P>
<P>
While its old town -- the core of Colmar -- is a page out of a child's 
storybook, its treasure is the world-renowned Issenheim altarpiece by Mathias 
Grunewald in Colmar's Unterlinden Museum. Others are drawn to the museum of 
Frederic Bartholdi, who created the Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
In the tourist season, crowds stroll through the old town with its carved 
gables, ancient signs and a hotel that is simply a gem, Le Marechal at 4-6 
Place des Six Montagnes Noires -- a wedding together of four former private 
residences that face a canal in that section of Colmar known as Petite Venise. 
</P>
<P>
Other canals flow through Colmar's Little Venice, but the mood surrounding 
Hostellerie Le Marechal is special, particularly for guests whose tables face 
the water with its swans and the amber light of lanterns reflected by its 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is a glimpse of medieval Europe, a quaint and pleasant choice, with 
the stirring of fragrant breezes and the musical background of Bach, Beethoven, 
Mozart and Wagner. Candles glow and the wines of Alsace flow -- as do the notes 
willed to listeners by those composers. 
</P>
<P>
Guests, especially Europeans, return regularly to Hostellerie Le Marechal, 
seeking solace within its ancient walls. In the lobby, which is hardly bigger 
than a cloak room, an antique clock strikes the hour. The hotel is filled with 
warmth and good cheer, and fortunate is the couple that receives the key to 
room No. 12, with its timbered walls and antiques and windows that frame the 
canal, which makes for one of those picture-perfect settings -- particularly 
for honeymooners. 
</P>
<P>
One should not arrive in Colmar alone, for not to share its magic would be a 
pity. In Colmar, poets and painters are inspired by the twisting streets and 
half-timbered houses whose balconies face scenes from another century. 
</P>
<P>
Michelin bestowed a star upon the 16th-Century Restaurant Au Fer Rouge at 52 
Grand Rue, where couples gather of an evening in three small rooms given over 
to romance -- as well as the restaurant's award-winning cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Proprietor Patrick Fulgraff prepares four small tables on the upper level, 
another five on the ground floor and half a dozen in a basement setting that's 
a showplace of medieval intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
To get a fix on Au Fer Rouge, this remarkable little restaurant is only steps 
from Maison Pfister, which is acclaimed as the most beautiful house in Colmar. 
A few doors away, the proprietor of a six-stool bar serves wine as well as 
espresso and cappuccino, and passers-by are lured into a bakery whose seductive 
fragrances drift through Colmar's cobbled streets like the aromas pouring from 
a kitchen on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
In Colmar's old quarter, half-timbered structures rise above the canals, their 
balconies blood red with flowers, their shadows fading with dusk. Later, lamps 
spread their glow and melodies flow from the doorways of restaurants that bid 
couples to step across the threshold to savor the romance inside. 
</P>
<P>
In a small bistro just off Tanner's Square, a boy with a mandolin strummed a 
haunting melody for a girl with golden hair who sat alone, eyes focused on the 
candle burning at her table. As she looked up, the boy put aside the mandolin 
and together they slipped away into the night. 
</P>
<P>
The moon was full and the evening was just beginning. 
</P>

The Route du Vin d'Alsace: 
</P>
<P>
The wine route of Alsace climbs hills and slips into valleys, passing through 
towns and villages with near-unpronounceable names: Hatmannswiller, Wattwiller, 
Wuenheim, Guebwiller, Bergholtz-zell, Gueberschwihr, Voegtlinshoffen, 
Wettolsheim, Eguisheim, Niedermorschwihr, Ribeauville, Rorschwihr and 
Mittelbergheim. These and dozens more. 
</P>
<P>
Castles face the plains of Alsace and footpaths are cut into vineyards so that 
one may stroll as well as drive while doing the Route du Vin. Alsace, bordered 
by Switzerland and Germany, is a 120-mile-long province that's famed for its 
fare as well as its wine. 
</P>
<P>
A three-star Michelin restaurant, L'Auberge de L'll at Illhausern, is rated one 
of France's best. Other one- and two-star restaurants are scattered throughout 
Alsace. 
</P>
<P>
Traveling through the province, motorists brake at scores of wine-tasting 
cellars and festivals that are held in Colmar during August, Ammerschwihr in 
April, Molsheim in May and Ribeauville in July. Later, with autumn's harvest, 
the entire province comes alive with celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
In its turbulent past, the province of Alsace was the victim of a succession of 
intruders. During the German occupation of World War II, the French language 
was banned and Alsatians were forced to fight alongside the Germans. Others hid 
Allied prisoners and specialized in sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
The battle to recapture Alsace is recalled as one of the bloodiest of the war, 
with entire villages destroyed. At the same time, vineyards fell victim to the 
German army as troops cut a swath through fertile valleys, wiping out 
competition for their own wines. 
</P>
<P>
When following the Route du Vin, it is best to rent a car rather than ride a 
crowded tour bus. Frequently, Colmar is chosen as a base for day-trips to 
surrounding villages (Its grandest hotel, the Bristol, at 7 Place de la Gare, 
is a third-generation family operation with an excellent restaurant, tastefully 
furnished rooms and a caring staff.) 
</P>
<P>
In July, an international music festival attracts artists from nations around 
the world to this historic old town with its 15th-Century Customs House, the 
14th-Century Pfister House and the Unterlinden Museum. 
</P>
<P>
Transportation: Alsace and the city of Colmar are served by frequent flights, 
and there's excellent train service from Paris' Gare de l'Est.
