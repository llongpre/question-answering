   DALLAS -- A Texas family that inherited religious and art
treasures in 1980 formally agreed to drop its claim to the
treasures and allow them to be returned to the German
cathedral where they were housed before World War II.
   The settlement, signed by the last of 14 members of Joe
Tom Meador's family, ends an almost two-year-old dispute
between the family and the Lutheran Church of Quedlinburg,
Germany. The works were taken from Quedlinburg in 1945, when
Mr. Meador was stationed there as a first lieutenant in the
U.S. Army artillery.

   Mr. Meador brought the works, including medieval
manuscripts and reliquaries, to Whitewright, Texas, where
they remained until 1990, when some heirs agreed to sell an
illustrated manuscript to a German cultural foundation. The
church sued the family in federal court in Dallas later that
year. A tentative settlement of the suit was reached in
January 1991.
   Specific terms of the settlement weren't provided, but
both sides said the Meador family will receive less than the
$3 million that they were to receive for the illustrated
manuscript. The accord also calls for the art and religious
works to be exhibited at the Dallas Museum of Art before
returning to Germany.
   The settlement didn't resolve a preliminary ruling by the
Internal Revenue Service that the trove should have been
listed as part of Mr. Meador's estate. "In the event that
ruling becomes final, we fully expect to challenge it in
court," said Randal Mathis, a lawyer for the Meador family.
