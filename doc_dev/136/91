<P>
Just a stone's throw from elegant Rittenhouse Square in the shadow of 
Philadelphia's financial district, a 19th-Century townhouse beckons book lovers 
from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library is home to priceless literary and historical 
works, including rare books and manuscripts and documents tracing the history 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's gems range from the Bay Psalm Book, the first book printed in the 
American colonies, to the manuscript of novelist James Joyce's masterpiece 
"Ulysses" and the living room of American poet Marianne Moore. 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenbach collection, part of which is highlighted in special museum 
exhibitions, includes more than 30,000 books, 270,000 manuscripts, 20,000 art 
works on paper, 500 paintings and miniatures and 750 photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1954, the museum is the legacy of Philip Rosenbach (1863-1953) and 
his brother Dr. Abraham Simon Wolf Rosenbach (1876-1952), whose shops in 
Philadelphia and New York City were long a magnet for book collectors. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham Rosenbach roamed the world acquiring literary treasures for wealthy 
clients. He also acquired a reputation as America's most famous dealer in rare 
books and manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
To his friend, the writer Christopher Morley, Rosenbach was "the Pied Piper of 
rare editions. He blows an airy wheedling note and the old vellums and 
calfskins come trotting after him." 
</P>
<P>
His biographers called him "the Napoleon of the auction room, the man who set 
record prices year after year." 
</P>
<P>
His collecting prowess in a career spanning the first half of this century 
brought Rosenbach much wealth and publicity and occasional criticism. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach's 1928 purchase at auction of the manuscript of Lewis Carroll's 
"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" for $77,000 infuriated many Britons, who 
were aghast at the loss of a national treasure. The manuscript, later sold by 
Rosenbach for a $20,000 profit, was eventually returned to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenbach acquisition in 1924 of Joyce's Ulysses manuscript for $1,975 
inspired a sarcastic quatrain by the Irish writer. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce was angered at being unable to raise the money to buy back the longhand 
manuscript of what is now considered the century's most influential novel and 
because Rosenbach paid four times more at the same sale for a manuscript of 
Joseph Conrad's novel "Victory." 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Joyce: 
</P>
<P>
"Rosy Brook he bought a book 
</P>
<P>
"Though he didn't know how to spell it. 
</P>
<P>
"Such is the lure of literature 
</P>
<P>
 "To the lad who can buy and sell it." 
</P>
<P>
No mere book dealer, however, Rosenbach was an avid collector whose love for 
his precious finds made possible the museum, which was established by trustees 
of the Rosenbach estate. 
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Rosenbach was well known for putting ridiculously high prices on things 
that he really didn't want to part with. That really became the foundation of 
his personal collection," said Leslie Morris, the museum's books and 
manuscripts curator. 
</P>
<P>
A tour of the museum, housed in the four-story home shared by the brothers in 
their final years, testifies to broad and distinguished tastes. 
</P>
<P>
Amid antiques collected by Philip Rosenbach, the collection yields distinct 
literary treasures at every turn. Historical documents and letters bear the 
great names of European and American history. There are manuscripts by Conrad, 
Geoffrey Chaucer and Charles Dickens, first editions of "Don Quixote" and 
"Robinson Crusoe," books once owned by John Milton and Abraham Lincoln, even 
Herman Melville's bookcase. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the Marianne Moore living room, whose contents, including a 
typewriter, books and autographed baseballs, were moved to the museum from 
Moore's Greenwich Village apartment after her death in 1972 and precisely 
rearranged. The museum also houses the Moore archives. 
</P>
<P>
Morris said the museum and library annually attract about 7,000 visitors and 
450 literary researchers, who pore over authors' manuscripts and letters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our mission is not only to display but also to perpetuate (the Rosenbachs') 
scholarly and social contributions," Morris said. "We see as our mission to 
explain to the general public the importance of rare books and art objects." 
</P>
<P>
The Rosenbach Museum &amp; Library is open to the public for tours Tuesday 
through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 2:45 p.m. Address: 2010 DeLancey Place, 
Philadelphia, Pa. 19103. Call (215) 732-1600.
