<LEADPARA>  WHEN the San Jose Museum of Art opens the doors to its new building tomorrow,
there will be cause for celebration. It marks a fresh start, and the inaugural
shows -- primarily the 27-piece "Compassion and Protest" -- identify the
territory the museum has staked out for itself.;    What director I. Michael
Danoff and his curators have chosen to emphasize is art that criticizes the
status quo, opens viewers' eyes to social ills and cultural injustices and
raises questions that, perhaps, will initiate discussion.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I can't imagine a painting or sculpture saving anyone's life, but I'm
convinced it's possible to produce works of art that affect people's
opinions.;    Some of the works in "Compassion and Protest" will certainly do
that. This show, the centerpiece among those featured at the opening, brings
together 16 contemporary big names, several of whom -- John Ahearn, Hans
Haacke, Anselm Kiefer and Leon Golub among them -- I can't remember ever
having seen exhibited before in San Jose.;    For me, Golub epitomizes an
artist at his most political. A fringe figure plugging away more than 30 years
ago in Chicago, when figurative art was out of favor, Golub has always been an
activist. With the wider acceptance of such art, he has gained international
attention for monumental canvases of anonymous torturers, cops and soldiers --
pieces which trace the influence of power through the metaphor of the
mercenary.;    In Golub's most powerful work on view, "Mercenaries III,"
larger-than-life figures float in a vast terra cotta space. In addition to its
dramatic format, Golub's richly textured paint and the huge scale of the work
command attention, drawing us into the action.;    Like Golub, Sue Coe rages
at inhumanity -- in the forms of poverty, war, slaughterhouses, animal
experimentation, drug abuse -- with her dark, bloody visions expressed through
the tough, tabloid look of the printed page. Coe's work always looks stronger
in graphite than paint. Still her "Welcome to R.A.F. Greenham Common," a
shiny-varnished collage/painting depicting a woman demonstrator being burned
alive by militaristic types near the U.S. air base in England that houses
missiles, graphically depicts political repression, separating the real heroes
from the villains.;    Like Coe, Barbara Kruger is one of many successful
artists who cross from fine art to commercial art and back. Kruger's forceful
protest art is delivered in her signature red-framed black-and-white photo
blow-ups on which punchy captions are superimposed. "Your Body is a
Battleground," for instance, was produced as poster for the pro-choice march
in Washington, D.C., in April 1989.;    Jenny Holzer is represented by an
installation consisting of granite benches inscribed with short texts
referring to rape, AIDS, and so on. The benches are placed in rows facing an
electronic message board flashing similar messages. The installation, called
"Under a Rock" and presented in a darkened gallery, makes for a compelling
"chapel of doom.";    Cindy Sherman is something of a special case. She is
best known for photographs in which she uses herself as the model, recording
an impressive repertoire of guises. The bait is luscious color and beautiful
form, but the instant a picture captures your attention, it reveals strange
features. In an untitled 1989 color photograph, Sherman, for instance, poses
topless in historical garb like some escapee from an Ingres canvas, but a
closer look reveals the props of her game: The "milk-swollen breasts" are made
of molded plastic and tied on at the shoulder.;    Sherman says her work is
about identity, but it's also about wittily playing with what's real. Her
images are often interpreted as feminist statements that take issue with the
cliches about womanly glamour.;    All these and the other pieces in
"Compassion and Protest" are part of the Eli Broad Family Foundation
Collection in Santa Monica. They have been borrowed and turned into a
dazzling, if trendy, compendium.;    It doesn't take away from the show's
impact to say that the collection is somewhat hit-or-miss. The Golubs are
splendid; so is Anselm Kiefer's "Germany's Spiritual Heroes," darkly glorious
with its cavernous interior containing stark monuments to Germany's cultural
heroes. David Wojnarowicz's attack on the press -- "The Newspaper As National
Voodoo: A Brief History of the U.S.A." -- is one of his strongest works.
Jonathan Borofsky's male aggression statement on canvas is powerful as well.; 
  And the installation by German-born artist Hans Haacke, who now lives in New
York and is well known for criticizing corporate connections with the art
world, attacks Ronald Reagan's nuclear policy and suggests that art can be a
weapon for social and political change.;    Some of the works are problematic,
however. The two huge, colorful "hip-hop hieroglyphic" paintings by Keith
Haring might have been selected because their immense scale shouts their
"importance"; they do not represent this graffiti artist's best endeavors,
however. Jean-Michel Basquiat's cartoon-style text-pieces are lively,
appealing and poetic, but they don't really fall into the realm of protest art
but rather reflect Basquiat's East-Village-streets lifestyle. Andy Warhol's
small portrait of Mao Tse-tung, despite its political subject, doesn't protest
so much as celebrate power figures. And the works here by Robert Longo, Robert
Morris and Tom Otterness are easily forgettable.;    Even so, "Compassion and
Protest" gives us plenty to mull over about the important issues surrounding
art that attempts to stimulate dialogue and change.;    It also raises some
disturbing questions: Is the museum going to buy into trendy and chic
corporate art, in this case, right off the covers of art magazines? And is
there a danger in giving such works a museum imprimatur, along with a lavish
color catalog, that can tend to pump up the value of the collection?;    One
thing the museum has been careful to avoid is creating the impression that
political art is new. Prints by Goya, Daumier, Kollwitz and Posada are
featured in a related show on the second level. They remind us that throughout
history art has been colored by political agitation and social disruptions.;  
 The 25 pieces here, calculated to offer a context for "Compassion and
Protest," include a handful of Goya's powerful prints from his "Disasters of
War" series and six Daumier prints that bring home the social injustices faced
by laborers after the 19th-century industrialization of France.;    Works by
renowned 20th-century German printmaker Kathe Kollwitz convey pity for the
poor and a mothers' grief for sons killed, as hers was, in World War I. The
great Mexican graphic artist Jose Guadalupe Posada attacked controversial
events of his time with drawings that create a fantasy world.;    Of the many
varied exhibits at the opening, what I especially like is the attention paid
to the interweaving of old and new. This interlacing starts in the new lobby,
where San Jose State University professor Tony May's wonderfully witty
"Bookmobile," alluding to the original building's former role as a library, is
suspended overhead. Designed as a bridge between the historical and new
structures, May's clever multi-layered "Variable Book Construction" consists
of wire tubes from which hang green-covered Encyclopedia Britannica yearbooks
from the '60s. Their color mirrors the green-tinged edges of the light
fixtures.;    The interlacing continues throughout, with El Greco's "St.
Francis Venerating the Crucifix," the masterpiece loaned by the Fine Arts
Museums of San Francisco. (It was still in its crate when the press previewed
the show earlier this week.);    Lewis deSoto's site-specific installation,
"Pe Tukmiyat, Pe Tukmiyat (Darkness, Darkness)," spreads its quiet magic
through five rooms in the original building. The 47 Rodin sculptures loaned by
Stanford look especially splendid in the light-drenched central gallery on the
new building's second level. Further comment on these works, along with
thoughts on impressive pieces by Donald Judd, Martin Puryear and Frank Stella,
loaned by Hunk and Moo Anderson of Atherton, and other pieces, will come
later.;     Compassion and Protest: Social and Political Art from the Eli
