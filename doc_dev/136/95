Cassiano dal Pozzo looked at the world 'with the true eyes of a lynx'. His
biographer could hardly have chosen an epitaph that would have pleased
Cassiano more. In an age distinguished by voraciously inquiring minds,
Cassiano stands out as a man of boundless curiosity. Patron of Poussin,
close friend and literary midwife to Galileo, correspondent of scholars and
dilettantes throughout Europe, Cassiano is a figure who really repays
discovery.
The Paper Museum of Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588-1657) at the British Museum
does not quite measure up to the fascination of its subject. That would
require an altogether more ambitious exhibition. To get the measure of
Cassiano, you definitely need the catalogue (published by Olivetti Pounds
18.50).
Cassiano and his circle stood at the centre of the scientific revolution.
There was, of course, no sense of any tension between art and science, let
alone of 'two cultures'. Cassiano, a lifelong bachelor, devoted himself to
Art which led him to subjects as diverse as science, museology, collecting,
geology, art-history, botany, architecture, archaeology, libraries, even
sport.
Cassiano was born in Turin in 1588, but the family then moved to Pisa, a
highly cultured city which was, of course, Galileo's home. After his father
died, he established himself in Rome in the service of Cardinal Barberini.
He lived with his younger brother, who helped him amass a great library and
a collection which ranged from flamingoes to antiquities and Poussin's
'Seven Sacraments.'
Many an aristocratic collector could boast a more impressive Wunderkammer.
Cassiano was only ever comfortably off. But his interest in science was on
an altogether more profound level than that of the average collector. Like
Galileo, he was elected to the select, and in some circles highly suspect,
Academy of Lynxes, the ancestor of all modern scientific institutions.
Whatever the subject at issue, nature, art or the manners and customs of
antiquity, Cassiano held that exact visual records were vitally important.
Aristotle's and Theophrastes's verbal descriptions were no longer adequate
for people with inquiring minds.
Cassiano's interest in natural history is well represented, with two of the
earliest microscopic studies ever made and striking studies of animals,
birds, plants, minerals, fungus and petrified wood. Some of these were for
books which Cassiano commissioned from proteges - he preferred to act as
literary midwife rather than publish himself.
Delectable watercolours of citrus fruit by Vincenzo Leonardi (one of few
identifiable artists working for Cassiano) were preparatory drawings for an
astounding compendium on the citrus fruit, the Hesperides. Its author,
Cassiano's friend Ferrari, was a typical polymath of the time. He was a
Jesuit, Professor of Hebrew in Rome, an elegant poet, author of a Syriac
grammar, and he planned the Barberini garden. One of the most attractive
drawings on show is Guido Reni's allegorical scene of Genoa watching as
Daedalus grafts a lemon-tree.
Cassiano's plan was that his Paper Museum (Museo Carteo) of some 7,000
drawings would ultimately be published as the indispensable guide to the
ancient world. Artists were commissioned to copy objects such as mosaics,
armour, reliefs, gems, statuary, inscriptions, and manuscripts. His main
interest was not so much the aesthetic quality of the object copied, but
what it showed about the world of the ancients.
By no means all the drawings are good, but they had to meet Cassiano's
criteria of being informative. The Paper Museum was a project which met with
approval in the highest circles. Cassiano was allowed to borrow two of the
most precious manuscripts from antiquity, the Vatican Terence and Virgil,
for a year so that his best artist, Pietro da Cortona, could copy scenes.
Cassiano also collected older prints and drawings. Like many 17th-century
collectors, he liked plans of fortifications and scenes of warfare. His
collection of architectural drawings were a painful reminder of how much
contemporary architects had departed from classical and Renaissance models.
In 1762 the Adam brothers bought a large part of the Paper Museum for George
III - siphoning off four magnificent books of architectural drawings for
their own purposes. The Royal Collection did not keep all its Cassiano
drawings but still owns the largest share.
An international committee has been coordinating research into Cassiano,
sponsored by Olivetti - a wholly exceptional gesture of corporate support
for scholarship. The exhibition catalogue is volume four of the Quaderni
Puteani, absorbing essays on Cassiano. Eventually the Paper Museum is to be
published in its entirety. The current exhibition is an intriguing dip into
the 17th-century intellectual world and its 'culture of curiosity'.
At the British Museum until August 30
