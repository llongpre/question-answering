   In the 1950s, industrialist William Lane's
voracious appetite for American art was limited only by the size of
his car.
   ``If it didn't fit into the back of my station wagon, I wouldn't
buy it,'' he reminisced, years after amassing what is considered
one of the finest collections of early 20th-century American works
by such artists as Georgia O'Keeffe, Arthur Dove, Stuart Davis and
Marsden Harley.
   Now, Lane has given 75 of those oil paintings, watercolors and
drawings to the Museum of Fine Arts, the museum's largest donation
in 40 years. They went on display Tuesday night.
   The gift to the Boston museum, already noted for its collections
of 18th and 19th century art, ``transforms our American painting
collection,'' director Alan Shestack said Tuesday.
   The collection ``makes us a real center for 20th-century
American art, which we could not have said yesterday,'' he said.
``Suddenly, in one fell swoop, we have gone from having very little
to having a very distinguished collection.''
   The gift from the William Lane Foundation, based in Lunenburg,
includes four works by O'Keeffe, seven by Davis, 12 by Dove and
three by Harley.
   Lane, a retired plastics manufacturer, began collecting
paintings in the 1950s. Guided primarily by his instincts, he
``slowly amassed what turned out to be a spectacular collection,''
Shestack said.
   Efforts to reach Lane and his wife, Saundra, were unsuccessful.
Their telephone number in Lunenburg is not listed. Lane recounted
his collecting habits in a statement issued by the museum.
   His finds include O'Keeffe's much-reproduced painting of 1936
``Deer Skull with Pedernal,'' which depicts a stylized deer skull
suspended on a blackened tree limb; Stuart Davis' pivotal abstract
``Egg Beater 3'' of 1927-28, and Dove's 1944 masterpiece ``That Red
One.''
   Lane ``appreciated these paintings at a time when they were
being overlooked by almost everyone else,'' Shestack said. ``They
represent the birth of abstraction in American art.''
   Lane's collection has been exhibited frequently at the Museum of
Fine Arts and around the world. He approached trustees of the
Boston museum this summer about making his permanent donation,
Shestack said.
   Lane is an honorary trustee at the museum, and his wife is a
trustee.
   The collection hung in the museum's central first-floor gallery,
which has been renamed the William H. and Saundra B. Lane Gallery.
