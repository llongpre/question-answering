<LEADPARA>  FEW great rivers evoke the mystery and myth that surrounds the Rhine.;  
Perhaps that is why the idea of a Rhine cruise is still a lure to travelers,
even in an age when the river is as congested and despoiled as any
superhighway.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Rhine begins in eastern Switzerland's Grisons Canton, where the
Vorderrhein and the Hinterrhein meet to form the Alpine Rhine. It ends in
Holland's North Sea. From beginning to end, its murky depths and rocky shores
have inspired poets, tale-spinners and diarists since the dawn of recorded
history.;   Sir Arthur Conan Doyle dispatched Sherlock Holmes in the Rhine,
sending him tumbling over the Rheinbeck Falls at Schauffhaussen, Switzerland,
locked in mortal combat with his eternal foe, Professor Moriarity.;   Earlier,
when the Roman Empire was just beginning to forge the great Roman Road
adjacent to the banks of the Rhine, Julius Caesar wrote that the barbarian
tribes who lived there ate fish and birds' eggs for sustenance.;   Playwright
Lillian Hellman used the Rhine's symbolic position as a natural border between
Germany and France to express her anti-Nazi sentiments in the play "Watch on
the Rhine.";   And in "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage," Lord Byron wrote of the
Drachenfels, a lonely, crumbling castle sitting on a hill overlooking the
right bank of the Rhine in Germany. Smack in the middle of a region known for
its fine red wine (called "dragon's blood"), the ruin is accessible to
tourists via a 19th-century rack railway.;   Most of the land that borders the
Rhine on its 820-mile journey to the sea has some historic, mythic or
political significance. Travelers can see these sites by booking any of the
three- to six-day Rhine cruises offered by the K.D. German Rhine Line, sole
provider of tourist travel on the Rhine River.;   But perhaps the area most
popular for cruising is the so-called Middle Rhine, that part of the river
stretching from Mainz to Cologne in Germany -- the Rhine of composer Richard
Wagner's Ring cycle, of the precious vineyards of the Rheingau, and the
romantic RheingoldStrasse home of the Lorelei Rock and dozens of castles.;  
Some of the highlights of a trip down the Middle Rhine are:;   (box) Mainz:
The capital of the Rhineland Palatinate, Mainz is also hometown of Johann
Gutenberg, the man who invented the printing press. Before boarding your
steamer, look in at the Gutenberg Museum in the northeast corner of Cathedral
Square.;   If you are there in early summer, spend a night frolicking at the
Midsummer Night's Festival, held in late June. The rebuilt town square is
turned into a carnival of wine and sausage vendors, strolling musicians and
fireworks. Similarly, in the first week in September vintners come to market,
allowing all the Rheingau to sample the grape.;   (box) Rudesheim: This lovely
town is home to many of the best of Germany's vintners. Literally devoted to
the grape, every street has its wine shop where worshipers of Bacchus may
sample the local wares. But the main drag for wine and souvenirs is the
Drosselgasse, where one may order a rohmer -- a clear crystal goblet with a
bottle-green base -- of some prized vintage. Additionally, in summer,
householders are allowed to sell their home brews in charming backyard
gardens. There is also a wine museum in Bromser Castle that is devoted to the
history of the Rheingau's 6,000-year-old wine industry.;   (box) Bingen: The
first stop on the Rhine's left bank, Bingen is situated between the Nahe and
the Rhine. Farther up, in Idar-Oberstein, the Nahe has been bridged within
town limits, to provide more streets for the thriving goldsmith and gem works
center. Bingen is on the old Roman Road; thus the empire manned a fort there.
Today it is a center for the making of Sekt, Germany's sparkling white wine.; 
 (box) The Mauseturm: Smack dab in the middle of the Rhine, the Mouse Tower is
a 13th-century watchtower sitting on a rocky islet. According to legend,
Archbishop Hatto of Mainz was eaten by mice in the tower for having caused a
number of hungry people to be burned to death. The truth is that its name
comes from the German word for toll, since the tower served as a
toll-collecting site in the days when every petty baron along the Rhine
demanded tribute of ships plying the waterway.;   (box) The Lorelei: A massive
slate crag on the right bank of the Rhine, the Lorelei rises to an impressive
400 feet above the river. Legend had it that the singing of a nymph who lived
on the rock lured sailors to their deaths, until she herself was felled by
love and dived to her death in the river.;   (box) Remagen and Remagen Bridge:
Steamers stop in Remagen, where one may inspect the remains of an ancient
Celtic settlement as well as a Roman fort. Nearby is the bridge that figured
so significantly during World War II.;   (box) Cologne: Home to one of the
world's greatest cathedrals, begun in 1248 and not completed until 1880.
Today, stonemasons from around the world are working hard to replace with
concrete copies the sandstone embellishments that have fallen prey to
automobile exhaust and other air pollution. Go there to see the Shrine of the
Magi, a reliquary designed in the 13th century. Also in Cologne, the German
Roman Museum houses relics uncovered along the old Roman Road.;   Cologne is
the last stop on a steamer cruise of the Middle Rhine; from there one can take
a quick ride over to Dusseldorf, a city as sleek and sophisticated as any in
the world. Its old town, filled with bars and beer halls, has been called the
"longest bar counter in Europe." But if beer is not your desire, let loose
with the credit cards along Konigsalle, which is lined with pricey boutiques,
restaurants and galleries.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; K. D. German Rhine Line is
at 323 Geary St., San Francisco 94102; (800) 858-8587 or (415) 392-8817.  </TEXT>
