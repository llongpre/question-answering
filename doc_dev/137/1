   A twin-engine plane with 11 people aboard
disappeared on what was to have been an hourlong tour of the
Hawaiian Islands, and searchers used helicopters and boats to look
for the plane, the Coast Guard said today.
   The U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Point Harris searched overnight
through the channel separating Hawaii Island and Maui Island for the
Scenic Air Tour Hawaii plane that disappeared Sunday afternoon.
   The Coast Guard was concentrating its search for the plane off
the northeast coast of Hawaii Island, the last confirmed location of
the airplane, said Coast Guard spokesman Petty Officer Robert
Bennett.
   Bennett said the Coast Guard received information from Federal
Aviation Administration radar tapes confirming the twin-engine
Beechcraft had left Hilo International Airport on the east side of
Hawaii Island and headed up the island's northeast coast.
   The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an FAA
ground station that he had taken off from Hilo for Maui's Kahului
Airport, said the FAA's George Harvey.
   The plane was to have toured Hawaii Island, including erupting
Kilauea Volcano, before flying on to Maui, said David Tom, a Scenic
Air Tours Hawaii reservationist in Honolulu.
   Tom, who declined to identify the pilot, said the 10 passengers
aboard the plane had set out earlier Sunday from Honolulu on Oahu
Island. He said they were probably tourists.
   Search efforts Sunday included a Coast Guard C-130 search and
rescue plane and a helicopter, two helicopters provided by the Maui
Fire Department and four Scenic Air Tour Hawaii planes, said Bennett.
   Civil Air Patrol planes and a Coast Guard helicopter were to join
the search when it resumed this morning, Bennett said.
   Hawaii police were also asked to check a section of the island
the pilot was known to fly over during tours, Bennett said. Hilo
police Sgt. Prentiss Morino said ground searches Sunday turned up
nothing and police were to resume looking later today.
   Air strips on the neighboring island also were checked in case
the pilot made a landing without informing the FAA, Harvey said.
   No rains were reported on the two islands Sunday, which had party
sunny skies with low scattered clouds and 15 to 20 mph winds, the
National Weather Service office said. Alenuihaha Channel, which the
plane would have had to cross to get to Maui Island, had 5- to
6-foot seas, it said.
   In December 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with
eight people aboard disappeared on flight from Honolulu to Molokai
Island. No trace of the plane or those aboard was found.
