   Hawaii's seafood-rich diet may have helped give
it the nation's lowest rate of preventable deaths from nine major
diseases, while Michigan's industrial lifestyle was blamed in part
for its having the highest.
   The rankings of all 50 states and the District of Columbia came
from a Centers for Disease Control study published Wednesday.
   It looked at deaths from stroke, lung cancer, coronary heart
disease, breast cancer, diabetes, cervical cancer, chronic liver
disease, colorectal cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease in 1986, the latest year data were available.
   The study found that 26.4 percent of the 2,817 deaths in Hawaii
from those nine diseases could have been prevented - the lowest
rate in the nation. North Dakota and Utah, both with 33.2 percent,
tied for the second lowest rate.
   Michigan had the highest rate - 53.5 percent - followed by West
Virginia at 53.3 percent, New York with 52.6 percent, Ohio at 52.1
percent and Kentucky with 52 percent.
   The differences depended on several variables but could be
explained, at least partially, with a little guesswork, said Steven
M. Teutsch, a CDC epidemiologist who worked on the study published
in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   Michigan's high rate may be because it is highly industrialized
and has large minority populations that might know little about
disease risks, he speculated.
   In Hawaii, people tend to eat more seafood and vegetables; that
contributes to lower cholesterol rates and less heart disease, he
said.
   Researchers arrived at their figures using a model based on
combining the lowest death rates for each disease to create a
``utopian state'' with an overall, combined death rate for the nine
diseases of about 224 per 100,000 people.
   Then they compared each state to the ideal.
   Hawaii came the closest, with 304.7 deaths per 100,000, or 80.34
deaths above the ideal. Thus 26.4 percent of its deaths were
considered preventable.
   The study found smoking contributed to the most deaths from the
nine diseases, 33 percent. Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, high
cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes followed.
   Teutsch said researchers have found that reducing even one of
the known risks for each disease - such as smoking for lung cancer
and cholesterol for heart disease - dramatically lowers chances of
developing the illnesses.
