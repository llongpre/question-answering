   Authorities ended their search of a remote
Hawaii Island valley after finding the bodies of all but one of the
11 people killed when a sightseeing plane crashed.
   The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane slammed into an 1,800-foot
cliff on June 11, killing all 11 people aboard.
   The bodies of two or three victims were discovered Friday, and
seven sets of remains were found Tuesday.
   Rain and fog in the rugged Waipio Valley forced authorities to
give up the effort, said Bruce Butts, deputy administrator of the
Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency.
   ``The weather conditions have turned bad again and we just have
to figure we've gotten all we can,'' he said.
