A sightseeing plane that vanished between the islands of Hawaii and Maui with 
11 people aboard may have sent out an emergency signal Monday, but foul weather 
prevented rescuers from searching for it. 
</P>
<P>
"There's an emergency signal coming from a valley, and we think it could be the 
plane," said Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler. "But the weather's so bad 
helicopters can't go in, and otherwise it's about a 10-hour hike." 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard helicopter picked up the emergency transmitter's signal from the 
remote Waimanu Valley region of the island, which is on the northwest end and 
within the flight path of the missing Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane, Spangler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane disappeared Sunday on what was to have been an hourlong flight. 
</P>
<P>
"We're getting all our information together and seeing if the weather will let 
up," Spangler said. Heavy rain and low clouds persisted in the area Monday.
