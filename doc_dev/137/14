   A grave discovered on a small, uninhabited atoll
in the Marshall Islands was believed to contain the remains of one
of five Hawaii fishermen who disappeared nearly 10 years ago,
authorities said.
   The grave and what remained of the men's 17-foot fiberglass
boat, the Sarah Joe, were found on Sibylla Island last month by a
U.S. National Marine Fisheries worker and an archaeologist studying
green turtles and sea birds, Coast Guard Capt. Jim Cushman said
Wednesday.
   Two forensics experts and a 27-member Coast Guard shore group
were sent to the island, located 2,054 nautical miles from Hawaii,
after officials in Honolulu were notified late last month, Cushman
said.
   ``It (the grave) was located some yards above the high water
mark,'' he said. ``It was a cairn of rocks with a crude cross on
top of it.''
   The partial remains, comprising about 60 percent of a skeleton,
including a lower jawbone, were found in the shallow grave, Cushman
said. A skull was not recovered, he said.
   A 2{-day search of the island, measuring about three miles by
less than half a mile, and nearby islands turned up no other human
artifacts, Cushman said.
   The island was described as uninhabitable, with no water or
vegetation, he said.
   The remains were transported last week to the Army's Central
Identification Laboratory in Honolulu, where an attempt to make a
positive identification will be made once medical records of the
five men are obtained, said Capt. Paul Bethke. It is possible the
remains might not be associated with the Sarah Joe, he said.
   The Sarah Joe was reported missing Feb. 11, 1979, after it
failed to return from a one-day fishing trip off Hana, Maui.
   A search for the boat was suspended after five days following a
56,000-square-mile search involving aircraft from the Coast Guard,
Navy, Marine Corps, civil air patrol and commercial and private
aircraft.
   Registration numbers on the boat's hull and the boat's
manufacturer's number were used to identify the Sarah Joe, said
Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.
