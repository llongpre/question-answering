   A search continued Sunday for a commuter plane
with 20 people aboard that disappeared Saturday night on a
scheduled 35-minute flight from the island of Maui to the island of
Molokai, officials said.
   The Aloha IslandAir DH6 Twin Otter failed to reach Molokai
Airport after leaving Kahului Airport at 6:25 p.m. (12:25 a.m. EDT
Sunday), said Don Early, air traffic manager for the Federal
Aviation Administration at the Honolulu Airport.
   There was no distress call from the plane's two-member crew and
no signals have been detected from an emergency locator transmitter
aboard the plane, said Sgt. William Bowker of the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center.
   The last radar fix on the plane was when it was two miles off
the northeast shore of Molokai, officials said.
   Two Coast Guard C130 search planes, two helicopters and two
cutters were dispatched to search the 3,000-square-mile area of the
Pailolo Channel between the two islands, said Chief Petty Officer
Dennis Hubbard, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   By early Sunday, the two helicopters and one C130 had been
recalled from the search area to await first light before rejoining
the search, said Petty Officer First Class Francesca Bozem at the
rescue center.
   Two Civil Air Patrol planes also were to join the search, she
said. Aloha IslandAir planned to send two aircraft to join in the
search at daylight, said Stephanie Ackerman, a spokeswoman for
Aloha IslandAir.
   Kahului is about 100 miles southeast of Honolulu.
   Searchers reported rain in the area was limiting visbility,
Hubbard said. The weather service said there were only scattered
clouds and 18 mph winds during the scheduled time of the flight.
   The plane, owned by a subsidiary of Aloha Airlines, was carrying
18 passengers and a crew of two, Early said. Thirteen passengers
are from Molokai, one is from Maui, two are from Philadelphia and
two are from Houston, said Ackerman. The names of the passenger and
crew were not released.
   About 10 police officers searched the coastlines of Maui,
Molokai and the island of Lanai ``looking for flares or any kind of
distress signal,'' said officer Peter Akuna at the Maui Police
Station in Wailuku.
