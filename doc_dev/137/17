<TEXT>     They make stops at Kauai, Maui and the Big Island of Hawaii. Visitors can
fly in from the mainland and just hop on board.;    The Independence was built
in 1950 and was the first of the sister ships to re-enter the trade after
American ocean cruises had stopped. Bought in 1978 by American Hawaii Cruises,
the ship started sailing Hawaii waters in 1980.;     The Constitution entered
service in 1951 with voyages between New York and Italy, and took Grace Kelly
to her wedding to Prince Rainier in Monaco. In 1982, Princess Grace
rechristened the vessel for American Hawaii Cruises when it joined the
Independence.;    Both ships have undergone $25 million in renovations in the
past 18 months, and both have occupancy rates greater than 100 percent in
summer, since young families book vacations then with children in tow.;   
Along the Honolulu waterfront, the Independence and the Constitution have
become heirs to the long tradition of American shipping. Each week as the
ships depart majestically, a bit of the magic of "Boat Day" is recaptured, and
it is easy to sense the years of tradition that the vessels continue.;    Time
aboard passes leisurely, Hawaii-style. Visitors spend hours lounging in the
sun, walking the decks, exercising in the fitness spas, relaxing in the
refurbished lounges and dining on the succulent Hawaiian fare.;    The
American registry of the sister ships means that they are staffed with all
American crews. "Passengers frequently find neighbors to share the hometown
news with," says Capt. Lawrence W. Kelley, master of the Independence.;   
Reaching all islands;  All the major islands are accessible by American Hawaii
Cruises.;    Oahu, "The Gathering Place," is ringed by protective coral reefs,
its legendary beaches stretching as far as the eye can see. At its heart is
world-famous Waikiki Beach, yet just a few miles beyond are pineapple and
coconut groves and ancient fishing villages.;    Maui may be the only place in
the world where humpback whales cause traffic jams. That is because so many
drivers stop to watch along the Honoapiilani Highway during the November-May
migrating season, when two-thirds of the North Pacific giants, Hawaii's
biggest visitors, stop by.;    Maui is Hawaii's second-largest island, and
also ranks No. 2 in visitors. Lahaina, the old whaling port where humpbacks
sing and cavort for visitors, is still the center of the action, but the
narrow, dusty streets Herman Melville walked are brightly lined with shops,
art galleries, restaurants and night spots.;    Today, the ships anchor
offshore, and visitors are taken by tender to Lahaina. Strolling its streets
and beaches is an easy way to kick back in paradise.;    Haleakala, the mighty
volcano called the House of the Sun, which stretches 10,000 feet out of the
sea, is the not-to-be-missed sight on Maui. Once visitors have seen it at
sunrise, they understand why Mark Twain called it "the sublimest spectacle I
ever witnessed.";    Sunshine on Kauai;  Kauai, the resort of ancient kings
and modern filmmakers, is the third-largest island, and ranks third in
visitors because of its gorgeous beaches, dependable sunshine and wonderful
sunsets. The ancient kings knew how to pick resorts, and visitors are
following in their footsteps to Poipu Beach on its south shore.;    The ships
tie up in Nawiliwili, but it is easy to arrange any ground tour desired. The
port itself is a working harbor, and not a great place to spend a day.;    In
addition to Poipu, many visitors choose the visually dramatic recreational
resort at Princeville. The unsurpassed sight at Puupoa Point, with its post
card perfect vista of Hanalei, was the sight for shooting the Bali Hai scene
in "South Pacific.";    Near the northernmost point of the Big Island of
Hawaii, there is a special place called Waipio Valley. The 2,000-foot gouge in
the earth is one of the great panoramas of the islands, and the two waterfalls
at the head are silver ribbons in the lush greenery.;    Towering above the
little valley is the snow-capped peak of Mauna Kea, home of the world's
greatest concentration of space-age telescopes. This may be the only place on
earth where it is possible to drive in a single day from an orchid-lined road
through a rain forest to a scene of lunar-like desolation high above the
clouds.;    The ships tie up off Kailua-Kona, where visitors can spend the day
or arrange day tours. Hilo is the other Big Island port of call, where
organized tours are a lot better idea than spending the day wandering the old
town.;    Hawaii's not-to-be-missed spectacle is Kilauea, the world's only
"drive-in" volcano, which offers the thrill of frequent, easily accessible
eruptions. The ride around Crater Rim Drive gives visitors the feeling they
can reach out and almost touch the volcano.;    As usual, Twain probably put
it best when he wrote of Hawaii: "No other land could so longingly and
beseechingly haunt me sleeping and waking through half a lifetime, as that one
has done."; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; (box) ITINERARIES -- Both the Independence
and the Constitution depart every Saturday from Honolulu. The Constitution
offers 3- and 4-day packages as well as week-long cruises; the Independence

the Big Island.; (box) RATES -- The packages offered by the Constitution
include either three or four nights at hotels on the various islands. Prices
for both ships (cruise only) start at $1,095 per person for an inside cabin.

also has air fare add-ons.; (box) SPECIALS -- A honeymoon/anniversary package
combines a two-day resort stay with a four-day cruise. Rates start at $989 per
person for stays at the Hawaiian Regent in Honolulu and $1,069 per person for

ocean-view rooms are among the amenities.; The cruise line is offering a 50
percent discount off its seven-day inter-island cruises to active and active
reserve military as well as military dependents. The discount applies to the
first two passengers in cabin categories "A through G" for April, May, July
27, Aug. 3, Nov. 9-23 and Dec. 14 sailings. Reservations may be made by
