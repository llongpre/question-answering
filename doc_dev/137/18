   Tropical Storm Marie, downgraded from a
hurricane, moved today toward Hawaii. Residents were advised to
prepare for winds of up to 73 mph.
   Hurricane Marie was downgraded late Sunday after its top
sustained winds fell from 85 mph to 70 mph. A storm must have
sustained winds of 74 mph to be classified a hurricane. Marie's
winds still gusted to 85 mph, the National Weather Service said.
   Marie storm was 210 miles southeast of Hilo on Monday night,
heading for Hawaii at 9 mph, forecasters said. If it stays on the
same course, the storm center would pass 130 miles south of South
Point on Hawaii, known as the Big Island, this afternoon,
forecasters said.
   A tropical storm warning, meaning winds of 39 mph to 73 mph were
possible, was posted for Hawaii Island. A tropical storm watch was
posted for Maui County, including the islands of Maui, Molokai and
Lanai. There were no warnings for Oahu Island, where Honolulu is
located.
   Gale-force winds, ranging from 39 to 54 mph, extend 140 miles
from the center, the weather service said.
   High surf kicked up by the storm hammered the east and south
shores of Hawaii Island, prompting the closing of Punaluu Beach
Park with surf on Monday ranging from 8 to 10 feet where it
normally averages 1 to 2 feet, said County Civil Defense
Administrator Harry Kim.
   The southeast section of the island was already experiencing
some strong gusty winds Monday, blowing debris onto some roadways,
Kim said.
   There were no reports of any property damage related to the surf
or wind, he said.
