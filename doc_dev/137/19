   High school students on Molokai Island
wept and prayed Monday for classmates and educators who were among
20 people killed in Hawaii's worst commuter airplane crash.
   A National Transportation Safety Board team arrived Monday to
investigate Aloha IslandAir Flight 1712, which slammed into a ridge
near Halawa Valley on the island's eastern end Saturday night en
route from neighboring Maui. There were no survivors.
   Rescuers recovered 20 bodies Sunday from the charred wreckage of
the DH6 Twin Otter.
   The victims included eight members of Molokai High School's
volleyball teams, the coach of the girl's team and the school's
athletic director. Three other island residents also were killed.
   The crash stunned Molokai, a rural island with 6,000 residents.
Many drivers attached green and white streamers to their car radio
antennas Monday. Molokai High's colors are green and white.
   ``It's small enough here so that everybody knows each other,''
said the Rev. Robb Kojima of Kalaiakamanu Hou Congregational
Church. ``It's almost like the feeling when the (space shuttle)
Challenger blew up. In the same sense, we all feel the grief.''
   Students at Molokai High gathered for a morning assembly. State
psychologists and psychiatrists and two sent by Aloha IslandAir
were on hand to help students cope with the tragedy.
   The school will establish a special counseling center as well,
Principal Clifford Horita said.
   State Health Director Dr. John Lewin said a six-member Mental
Health Division crisis team will be available to counsel families
and friends of the victims.
   Fire rescue teams used helicopters to ferry the bodies back to
Kahului Airport on Maui. State crisis team workers were on hand to
assist relatives who were flown to the island.
   The twin-engine plane was 16 years old and had made 28,000
flights, Peter Dudgeon, Aloha IslandAir's vice president and
general manager, said Sunday. It was rebuilt in 1986 and had no
significant maintenance problems, he said.
   The plane left Kahului Airport at 6:25 p.m. Saturday for a
scheduled 35-minute flight, said Don Early, air traffic manager for
the Federal Aviation Administration at Honolulu Airport.
   The Coast Guard launched a search shortly after 8 p.m. when the
airline reported the plane missing, officials said. The plane was
sighted at 5:45 a.m. Sunday. Wreckage was found over a 300-foot
area.
   There was no distress call from the crew and no signals were
detected from an emergency locator transmitter aboard the plane,
said Sgt. William Bowker of the Joint Rescue Coordination Center.
   The pilot of the plane, Captain Bruce Pollard, 30, had flown for
the airline for two years, Dudgeon said. He and First Officer Phil
Helfrich, 27, were from Oahu Island, which includes Honolulu.
   Aloha IslandAir said the passenger list included Peter and
Elizabeth Wiley of Philadelphia, John Craig and Christina Batura of
Houston, and Hank Gabriel of Maui. The airline earlier identified
Ms. Batura as Christina Craig, which is how she checked in with the
carrier. Her real name was released Monday.
   The Molokai passengers were identified by the airline as girl's
volleyball team coach Odetta Rapanot; athletic director John Ino;
Leilani Ahina, Jared Elia, Lea Dunnam, Colette Kekalia, Natalie
Helm, Nancy Pierce, Nancine Mahiai, Aloma Spencer, Rodrigo Senica,
Jovencio Ruiz and Testa Ku. No ages were given.
