   A sightseeing plane that vanished between the
islands of Hawaii and Maui with 11 people aboard may have sent out
an emergency signal Monday, but foul weather prevented rescuers from
searching for it.
   ``There's an emergency signal coming from valley and we think it
could be the plane,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.
``But the weather's so bad helicopters can't go in, and otherwise
it's about a 10-hour hike.''
   A Coast Guard helicopter picked up the emergency transmitter's
signal from the remote Waimanu Valley region of the island, which is
on the northwest end of the island and within the missing plane's
flight path, Spangler said.
   The valley had no vehicular access, he said, adding that no
decision had been made whether to dispatch searchers to hike in.
   ``We're getting all our information together and seeing if the
weather will let up,'' Spangler said. Heavy rain and low clouds
persisted in the area Monday.
   The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane disappeared Sunday on what was
to be have been an hour-long flight.
   A Coast Guard cutter, Coast Guard helicopter and seven Civil Air
Patrol planes searched 1,279 square miles of ocean, said Coast Guard
spokesman Scott Hartvigsen. Police on Hawaii and Maui islands also
checked areas where tour aircraft fly, he said.
   Air strips also were checked in case the pilot landed without
informing the Federal Aviation Administration, said FAA spokesman
George Harvey.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft carrying a pilot and 10 tourists had
left Hilo Airport for Kahului Airport and headed up Hawaii Island's
coast under partly sunny skies, disappearing without any indication
of trouble, officials said.
   The plane's last reported position according to FAA radar was
about 10 miles north of Hilo, flying along Hawaii's northeast coast,
Hartvigsen said. Its altitude at that point was not known, Harvey
said.
   Harvey said investigators suspect that if the plane went down it
is in the area of that last radar fix, because it was passing out of
radar coverage and if it had gone further it likely would have been
picked up by another radar station.
   The sky over the area was partly sunny with low scattered clouds,
no rain and 15 to 20 mph wind at the time the plane disappeared, the
National Weather Service said. The plane took off about 1:15 p.m.
and was to have landed at Kahului at 2:30 p.m., officials said.
   Alenuihaha Channel, which the plane would have had to cross to
get to Maui, had 5- to 6-foot seas at the time.
   The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an FAA
ground station that he had taken off from Hilo for Maui, Harvey said.
   The plane was on a six-island tour, said company owner Doris Tom.
The passengers had taken a ground tour of the erupting Kilauea
Volcano before leaving Hilo, she said.
   Most of those aboard are Americans and two are from Australia,
but the names are not being released because not all the families
have been notified, said David Tom, the operations manager for the
tour company.
   In 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with eight people
aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from Honolulu to
Molokai Island.
