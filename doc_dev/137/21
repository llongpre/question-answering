   Tropical Storm Marie headed farther south of the
Hawaiian Islands than previously expected Tuesday, but forecasters
cautioned residents to prepare for effects of the storm.
   High surf kicked up by the storm hammered the eastern and
southern shores of Hawaii Island, prompting the closing of Punaluu
Beach Park. Surf there ranged from 8 to 10 feet, up from a normal
average of 1 to 2 feet, Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator
Harry Kim said.
   The southeastern section of the island also experienced some
strong, gusty wind that blew debris onto some roads, Kim said.
   There were no reports of any property damage caused by the surf
or wind, he said.
   The storm was expected to pass about 250 miles south of the
South Point area of Hawaii Island.
   On Monday, the National Weather Service predicted the storm
would come within 130 miles of Hawaii Island, the Big Island, but
the storm began veering from a westerly course to the southwest.
   At 2 a.m., the storm was about 235 miles south southeast of
Hilo, on Hawaii Island's east coast, and was moving to the
southwest at 9 mph.
   The storm, downgraded from a hurricane Sunday, had a maximum
sustained wind speed of 65 mph with 85 mph gusts. Gale force wind
extended 125 miles out from the center.
   The storm's intensity was expected to change little until the
same time Wednesday, the weather service said.
   A tropical storm warning remained in effect for Hawaii Island
and a tropical storm watch was in effect for the islands of Maui,
Molokai and Lanai. No storm warnings were issued for Kauai and Oahu
islands; Honolulu is located on Oahu.
   A tropical storm warning means wind blowing at a sustained speed
of 39 mph to 73 mph is possible within 24 hours or less. A watch
means there is a threat of tropical storm conditions within 36
hours.
