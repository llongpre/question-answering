Mature travelers who enjoy combining travel with education will appreciate the 
program offered by ElderFolk, a fast-growing program founded in 1984 by the 
Oregon-based Folkways Institute. 
</P>
<P>
ElderFolk is designed for adults age 55 and older, and is described as a 
"school without walls" because, unlike many study programs for seniors that 
take place on college campuses in the United States and abroad, ElderFolk 
provides on-site lectures, discussions and individual exploration in the 
countries visited. 
</P>
<P>
Programs are designed to be economical while still providing participants the 
opportunity to explore other cultures by direct contact with local citizens. 
</P>
<P>
ElderFolk programs vary in length and do not require any specific education 
level or previous knowledge of the areas visited. There are no textbooks, 
homework or study preparation. 
</P>
<P>
The Folkways Institute has scheduled more than 15 tours for the remainder of 
1990 and through 1991, with other destinations to be added. 
</P>
<P>
A sampling of the types of tours and subject matter includes: "Discover the 
Agean" (Greece and Turkey), emphasizing the region's influence on the modern 
world, May 3-24, 1991, $2,160; "Back Country Hawaii," devoted to an ecological, 
cultural and geological overview of the Big Island of Hawaii, Jan. 11-20, 1991, 
$1,260, and "Myanmar (Burma), Rangoon to Inle Lake," focusing on the natural 
and cultural wonders of the Republic of Myanmar, Feb. 6-22, 1991, $2,325. 
</P>
<P>
The free ElderFolk catalogue contains details of the philosophy and background 
of the Folkways Institute and a brief description of all of the tours scheduled 
for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
For the listing of tours or a copy of the catalogue, write Folkways Institute, 
14600 S.E. Aldridge Road, Portland, Ore. 97236-6518, or call (800) 225-4666.

Mature travelers make up a high percentage of passengers on freighters, 
according to a spokesman for the Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel Assn. 
Flexibility is the key to freighter travel since the vessels' schedules are 
dictated by the cargo on board and any that might be picked up along the way. 
</P>
<P>
Newer freighters are being constructed with the express intent of carrying 
passengers, too, and cabins are increasingly more spacious and better 
decorated. One new freighter, Ivaran Lines' Americana, can book 88 passengers, 
although most freighters offering service from the United States carry a 
maximum of 12. 
</P>
<P>
The Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel Assn. has published a free booklet entitled, 
"35 Most Commonly Asked Questions About Freighter Travel." It tells about 
length of trips, shipboard activities, possible destinations, food service, 
language problems on foreign carriers, accommodations, health requirements, 
fares and discounts, booking procedures and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
For a free copy of the booklet, write to the Cruise &amp; Freighter Travel 
Assn., P.O. Box 218, Flushing, N.Y. 11358, or call (800) 872-8584 during normal 
business hours.

Mature travelers who are considering a trip to the Hawaiian Islands this year 
can benefit from what are called "Prime Time Perks" -- fringe benefits offered 
by Island Holidays Tours to persons over age 60. Bonus features may include 
tours, special amenities or upgrades at certain properties. 
</P>
<P>
