<LEADPARA>  THE first Polynesian settlers reached the Hawaiian Islands by sea about 500
B.C. and British explorer Capt. James Cook sailed there in the 18th century,
so it seemed odd to me on my first visit to Hawaii 15 years ago that I
couldn't travel from island to island by sea. Not only the Polynesians and
Captain Cook had done it, but Yankee whalers and missionaries in the 19th
century. But in the 20th century, I couldn't.;    Instead, I hopped on and off
planes for a 30-minute flight from Honolulu to Kauai, about 100 miles away,
and to Maui, another 100-mile, half-hour flight. When I was in Honolulu, there
was Molokai in the distance just 26 miles away. From Molokai to Maui, the
channel is only nine miles wide. But by sea there was no getting there from
here.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But 10 years ago, two former transatlantic passenger ships, the
Constitution and the Independence were refurbished to cruise the Hawaiian
Islands. And last spring I joined 790 other passengers in Honolulu for a
weeklong American-Hawaii Line cruise of these waters that the Polynesians, the
explorers, the whalers and the missionaries had sailed.;    Skies lowered and
rain fell almost constantly as the Constitution made her way from Honolulu to
Maui, Maui to Hawaii and Hawaii to Kauai. To go ashore in Kona on the Big
Island of Hawaii I wore a bathing suit. There was no point in getting other
clothes that wet. And I opted for a submarine fish-seeing tour figuring that,
under water, I would be in the right company. It didn't really matter, though,
as the 46-passenger mini Atlantis submarine took us down 150 feet to a coral
reef in the harbor where schools of zebra-striped fish and surgeon fish and
blue-striped snappers swarmed around a diver feeding them stale bread and
lettuce.;    Of course the American-Hawaii Cruise Line cannot be blamed for
the weather, but the season to avoid in Hawaii -- the inviting warmth of the
climate notwithstanding -- is the December to February rainy season. Even
then, the rain comes in quick, heavy showers and is gone again just as
quickly.;     In Kona, after my submarine outing, I spent an hour indoors at
Hulihee Palace, a summer palace for some of Hawaii's last royalty. (An
advantage of Hawaii, in any weather, is its large number of well maintained
historic houses, palaces and museums -- many operated by Hawaii's equivalent
of the DAR, the Daughters of Hawaii, descendants of missionaries interested in
preserving old Hawaii's heritage.) The palace was rich in Hawaiian antiques
and royal memorabilia (including a 180-pound exercise ball that 18th-century
King Kamehameha the Great is said to have used and a hatbox made from a
hollowed-out coconut tree trunk.);    In Hilo, on the other side of the
island, I saw the early-morning Monday through Saturday Suisan Fish Auction
where hotel buyers poked with their umbrellas at the fish they wanted -- red
snapper, blue marlin, yellowfin tuna and wahoo. The taxi driver who had picked
me up at the ship also had provided a brief tour of other waterfront sights --
the Japanese Garden with miniature pagodas and stone bridges and lanterns and
bamboo.;    A land excursion from the ship took passengers to Rainbow Falls
where mist from the 125-foot falls and sun commingle to make the rainbows;
ferns grow as tall as trees; elephant ear leaves are carried as umbrellas;
philodendron and trumpet flowers grow.;    Another possible excursion was to
Hawaii Volcanoes National Park where Kilauea Volcano lava is oozing like black
tar toward the ocean and one can walk out on the lava flow, feel the heat
beneath it; see the destruction it has wrought.;    Sailing from Hilo to Kona
we watched the burning lava -- like a stream of lights -- descend the mountain
side and splash -- with a further explosion of lights -- into the black sea.; 
  On Kauai, the Garden Island where "South Pacific" was filmed,
fellow-passengers and I rented a car to drive through little tin-roofed
villages, past taro fields to the beauty spots of its North Shore where the
blue seas thunder in on white sand and rock and ironwood trees grow tall. Had
the weather been better, another option would have been a view from a Zodiac
raft of this northern Na Pali coast, or from a helicopter.;    I spent the
afternoon of my Kauai visit wandering the over-manicured, over-fancified
grounds of the Westin Kauai at Kauai Lagoons resort, whose mammoth high-rise
bulk I had seen looming alongshore as the Constitution pulled into Nawiliwili
Harbor.;    On a post-cruise excursion on the Big Island, I spent time on the
still grander similar resort, the Hyatt Regency Waikoloa where the waterfalls
and lagoons and canals are artificial. Trams take one from the registration
desk to one's accommodation (or it is possible, instead, to travel on a
canopied boat along one of the canals). Guests can swim in a pool with
dolphins.;    On Maui, the land excursions included a bus trip through green
hills and effulgent valleys where plumeria and orange African tulips bloom to
the Iao Needle, a rock spearing 1,200 feet from the valley floor.
Unfortunately, again, rain impeded seeing it with clarity.;    Land excursions
from the Independence or the Constitution are an expensive add-on to a
Hawaiian Islands cruise (they range from $15 to $125).;    As for shipboard
time, there are hula, lei-making and ukulele lessons to take take free of
charge; nightly cabaret entertainment; good, if not exceptional meals
pleasantly served in pretty dining saloons. Cabins are well decorated and well
tended.;    And I was right. It feels better, somehow, to be sailing through
an island chain rather than flying through it.;    (check) IF YOU GO --
American-Hawaii cruises leave Honolulu on Saturdays year round with double
cabin prices for a seven-day cruise starting at $895 per person for an inside
or $1,095 for an outside cabin, plus port and cruise taxes of about $50.
Alternatives include a three- or four-day cruise combined with three or four
days at a resort. Information: (800) 765-7000.  </TEXT>
