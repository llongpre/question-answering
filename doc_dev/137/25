   Magdalena Barut didn't need the money, but she
was bored; tired of ``just chasing the chickens around the yard''
of the Maui home she has lived in since 1954.
   So, on a whim, the 67-year-old Barut applied for a job at
McDonald's, figuring she would be rejected because of her age.
   But not only has McDonald's hired Barut and other senior
citizens like her, the nationwide hamburger chain also lets them
pick their own shifts, gives them 20 hours of training for just one
task _ Barut learned to make french fries _ and in some cases
drives them to and from work.
   ``I don't know I was worried about getting turned down,'' said
Barut, who has been promoted to running a cash register. ``I guess
we just didn't figure how desperate they are for workers around
here.''
   McDonalds _ which traditionally hires high school students for
part-time, minimum-wage jobs _ is only one of the many companies
facing a labor crunch in Hawaii.
   Businesses on the islands of Oahu, Kauai and Maui and Hawaii,
especially those dependent on the ever-burgeoning tourist industry,
are scrambling for workers as the state's unemployment rate falls
to record lows and soon-to-open luxury resorts compete for the
existing work force.
   The state department of Labor and Industrial Relations reported
a statewide unemployment rate of just 3.3 percent for February, the
most recent data available.
   ``Basically, everybody's got a job who wants one,'' according to
a spokeswoman from the Hawaii Visitors Bureau, who said the state's
reputation could suffer if hotels, restaurants and other
tourist-related businesses could not hire enough people to serve
their guests.
   ``The aloha spirit is one of the prime attractions of Hawaii,''
said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be named. ``If that begins
to change because there are not enough people to fill all the jobs,
we could have a serious problem.''
   A report by the labor department's Tourism and Training Council
projected an average of 6,400 workers would be needed each year to
meet job openings forecast for Hawaii, Kauai and Maui counties
through 1995. But the study found that after this year, only about
1,600 people _ or one-fourth the demand _ would enter the job
market each year until then.
   Those dim projections helped convince McDonalds to turn to
senior citizens to fill its employee gaps. Other companies have
taken more drastic measures.
   The Westin Maui Hotel in Kaanapali, in a joint venture with the
state, helps ferry workers from the nearby island of Molokai, where
a declining pineapple industry led to a 5.8 percent unemployment
rate in February. Other businesses followed suit.
   ``Maui had a low unemployment rate and Molokai had a high one,
so we decided to work together,'' said Lindsey Geyer, the director
of human resources at the Westin Maui.
   Although many are basking in the glow of the state's ``full
employment,'' others say the prevalence of tourist-related jobs _
which account for about one third of the employment in the state _
means many residents earn less than they would in other industries.
Since Hawaii's cost of living is about 26 percent higher than the
national average, many people struggle to make ends meet.
   ``The islands may be paradise, but there also very expensive,''
said Geyer. Educators in the state are also concerned; they say
that because of the proliferation of jobs, young people who would
otherwise go to college are lured away to the work world.
   And economists say that full employment could trigger higher
inflation, because when businesses compete for employees _ offering
more pay and better fringe benefits _ the cost is ultimately passed
on to the consumer.
   Then, of course, there are the tourists.
   1987 was a record year for tourism in the state, with about 5.7
million people visiting the islands, 3.3 percent more than the year
before, according to the visitors bureau.
   ``Today's traveler and tomorrow's traveler want more service,
and that's labor intensive,'' said Dorothy Bremner, employment
analyst for the labor department's Tourism and Training Council.
   An obvious cure _ enticing more people to work and live here _
could be painful.
   ``Bringing people in presents plenty of other problems, and our
infrastruture is already overloaded,'' Bremner said. ``You'll find
very few people interested in making it any more crowded here.''
   A better solution, she says, is to upgrade the skills of the
people who already live here, and make jobs in the tourist industry
career opportunities rather than just average-wage occupations.
