<LEADPARA>  HAWAII is an accessible safari, even for those of us who usually only daydream
of adventure. Let your friends return from a Hawaiian vacation to say they
have been to the famous places. You can come back with the kind of amazing
stories of nature that most people expect to find only on television
documentaries.;   That was what we discovered on a recent trip to two of the
Aloha State's most accessible islands: the Valley Island of Maui and the Big
Island of Hawaii.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     You can watch active volcanoes ooze orange fire. Or experience the
mysterious way that black and lifeless lava deserts lie right next to lush
rain forests filled with thundering waterfalls. You can marvel at mountains
capped with snow -- then drive half an hour to sweltering, secluded beaches
made of black, red and even green sand. The ocean's crashing waves can tease
your senses as, just yards away, you soak quietly in natural pools of clear,
still and soothing water.;   Wide open spaces; The Big Island is often
overlooked by tourists -- but we found it amazing in its sheer volume of
natural wonders.;   They do not call it the Big Island just to distinguish it
from the state name itself. It's big -- all the other islands would fit on it
together with no problem. But it is open -- fewer than 100,000 people are
scattered through its 4,000 square miles -- and it is manageable. We drove 350
miles around its circumference in one very long but immensely satisfying day.;
  That is how we discovered that Hawaii, the island, holds a little of just
about everything that Hawaii, the state, has to offer. Actually, everything
the planet has to offer. Of Earth's 37 climate zones, 31 can be found on this
island.;   In Hawaii Volcanoes National Park you can view huge, lunar-like
volcanic craters (not to mention active Kilauea), and then moments later be
hiking in surprisingly lush rain forests.;   Only the hardiest hikers can
reach Mauna Loa, at 13,677 feet the island's second-highest mountain. But
anyone can drive up Hawaii's tallest peak, Mauna Kea, in the midst of a forest
reserve north of the national park. The world's largest observatory -- holding
10 huge telescopes -- takes advantage of the unspoiled atmosphere atop its
13,796 feet. The height also brings snow in the winter months; expert skiers
can make an expensive four-wheel-drive haul up to find untouched powder.;  
The road less traveled; The real appeal of the Hawaiian islands lies in the
sum total of dozens of small delights, the ones that can only be savored by
taking those detours down spur roads that look appealing and hiking up some
muddy trail just to see where it might lead.;   We learned this valuable
lesson in our earlier stop on Maui. You are likely to have heard of some of
its main attractions -- like the "road to Hana," a three-hour drive from the
resort towns over some of the twistiest, windiest coastal two-lanes imaginable
to an isolated little village on Maui's windward side. It is inevitable that
you go, but you must think of it as a journey on the Hana Highway, not a road
to a place.;   Take the time to stop and savor its many nooks and crannies --
dozens of waterfalls, some creating ponds suitable for swimming; family fruit
stands offering reasonably priced refreshments and homemade souvenirs;
roadside mini-trails through bamboo forests and wild gardens of blazing exotic
flowers; quaint missionary churches from the 19th century. We stumbled on a
grove of "rainbow" eucalyptus trees whose trunks were streaked with an amazing
array of bright pastel colors -- lavender, pink, chartreuse and orange.;  
Despite conventional wisdom, you do not absolutely have to backtrack from
Hana, either, although it is true that Maui's paved roads run out pretty
quickly around the far side. We forged ahead a few miles to the much-touted
Seven Sacred Pools, which we learned were not considered sacred and are
considerably more than seven, stepping down from a stunning waterfall to the
ocean in quick succession down a rock gorge. It is almost a religious
experience, however, to take a dip in them, especially the final one, which is
protected from the raging ocean only by a short wall of stones.;   When we got
back to the continental United States with two dozen rolls of landscape
pictures and stories of all those remote wonders of nature that we had managed
to discover, our friends said in amazement that it sounded like we had seen it
all.;   Gee, we thought -- we felt as though we had barely scratched the
surface.  </TEXT>
