   A commuter plane with 20 people aboard
disappeared Saturday night on a scheduled 20-minute flight from the
island of Maui to the island of Molokai, officials reported.
   The Aloha Islandair DH6 Twin Otter failed to reach Molokai
Airport after taking off from Kahului Airport at 6:25 p.m., said
Don Early, air traffic manager for the Federal Aviation
Administration at the Honolulu Airport.
   The Coast Guard launched a search for the plane after
determining it had not landed at any other airport, said Sgt.
