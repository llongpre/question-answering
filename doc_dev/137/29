Barbara Campbell, formerly of Kona Village on the Big Island of Hawaii, has 
taken wing and settled at Kamuela (also on the Big Island), where she operates 
a lodging service called Hawaii's Best Bed &amp; Breakfasts. Everything from 
B&amp;Bs to private cottages. Her headquarters are in upcountry Kamuela (10/20 
minutes by car from the ocean, less than an hour from Kailua-Kona and 57 miles 
from Hilo). One of Campbell's hosts is former Los Angeles newspaper reporter 
Dee Dickson. 
</P>
<P>
High on Campbell's list is a converted barn with two bedrooms, a kitchen, 
living room, fireplace, TV, telephone, stereo. (The owners live in a separate 
cottage nearby.) Another rental faces Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, with a view all 
the way to the Pacific. Campbell's own Waimea Gardens cottage features antique 
furnishings and a kitchen where guests prepare their own breakfasts with 
ingredients supplied by Campbell (she lives just next door).

B&amp;B, Beverly Hills Style: Meanwhile, here's the ultimate B&amp;B, with a 
price tag (hold on to your hat) that ranges from $2,000 to $2,500 per night. 
That's the cost for living the celebrity life in a 4,000-square-foot spread at 
the Bungalows at Mauna Lani Bay, which is downcountry from Campbell's cottages. 
Five enormous homes, each with two bedrooms, two baths, a steam room, 
individual swimming pools, a film/stereo library. A butler on call 24 hours a 
day. Limousine service from the airport. Cocktails/hors d'oeuvres served every 
afternoon, or you can pour your own drinks all day from your own private bar. 
And of course, breakfast, too. Something to consider if you ever hit the Lotto.

Fine Dining: Everyone (islanders and visitors alike) agree that Merriman's at 
Kamuela is the finest restaurant on the Big Island. Young Peter Merriman, 34, 
who distinguished himself at restaurants on the mainland (including a Laurance 
Rockefeller property in Woodstock, Vt.), brought honors to Hawaii's Mauna Lani 
Bay Hotel before opening his own restaurant at Kamuela. Merriman's specializes 
in fresh meats from local ranches, fresh fish. Gets raves for his wok-charred 
ahi (local fish), his veal with mango and peppercorn sauce, and his steak kiana 
(filets with shiitake sauce). Merriman, who is credited with introducing the 
idea of regional cuisine in the islands, is the son of Woodene Merriman, the 
former food editor of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Food/cooking is his lifetime 
love. 
</P>
<P>
Merriman's Restaurant, Opelo Plaza, Kamuela. Lunch served Monday through 
Friday, dinner nightly. For reservations, call (808) 885-6822.

Hawaiian Weddings: Greeters of Hawaii is mailing an 11-page wedding planner to

sunrise. Other weddings at sea, in Maui's Iao Valley and Kauai's Fern Grotto
