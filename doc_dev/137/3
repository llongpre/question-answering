A twin-engine plane with 11 people aboard disappeared on what was to have been 
an hourlong tour of the Hawaiian Islands, and searchers used helicopters and 
boats to look for the plane, the U.S. Coast Guard said today. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard Cutter Point Harris searched overnight through the channel 
separating the islands of Hawaii and Maui for the Scenic Air Tour Hawaii plane 
that vanished Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard was concentrating its search for the plane off the northeast 
coast of the island of Hawaii, the last confirmed location of the twin-engine 
Beechcraft. 
</P>
<P>
The last communication with the pilot was when he radioed an FAA ground station 
that he had taken off from Hilo for Maui's Kahului Airport, the FAA's George 
Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
The plane was to have toured Hawaii Island, including erupting Kilauea Volcano, 
before flying on to Maui, said David Tom, a Scenic Air Tours Hawaii 
reservations clerk in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Tom said the 10 passengers aboard the plane had set out earlier Sunday from 
Honolulu on the island of Oahu.
