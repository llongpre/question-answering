   A partial list of the 95 people aboard Aloha
Airlines Flight 243, which was blown apart last Thursday during a
flight from Hilo to Honolulu, was released Tuesday by state
Attorney General Warren Price.
   Aloha had repeatedly refused to release the names of the 89
passengers on board the ill-fated flight, saying it wanted to
protect them from unsolicited legal advice and to protect their
privacy.
   The names of pilot Robert Schornstheimer, co-pilot Mimi Tompkins
and flight attendants Michelle Honda, Jane Sato-Tomita, and
Clarabelle Lansing, who was killed, were released last Thursday.
   Price said he released the list because of media requests. It
includes only the 63 people who were transported to or treated at
Maui Memorial Hospital after the plane, with 20 feet of its upper
fuselage ripped off, made a safe emergency landing at Kahului
Airport on Maui.
   The names of the 14 people from the states other than Hawaii are:
   Arlo J. Clippinger, Tucson, Ariz.
   Daryle Clippinger, Tucson, Ariz.
   Monte Dreben, Calabasas, Calif.
   Joy Flanigan, St. Davids, Pa.
   William Flanigan, St. Davids, Pa.
   Alice M. Godwin, Boulder City, Nev.
   Ralph Godwin, Boulder City, Nev.
   Timothy Green, Citrus Heights, Calif.
   Cynthia L. Johnson, San Diego
   Cosme Mangibuyat, San Francisco
   Billy A. Wann, Boulder City, Nev.
   Elouise Caro Wann, Boulder City, Nev.
   Daniel Westfall, Novato, Calif.
