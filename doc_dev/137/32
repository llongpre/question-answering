   A Honolulu-bound jumbo jet with 205 people
aboard developed a fuel leak over the Pacific Ocean, but landed
safely early Monday after being diverted to Hilo, authorities said.
   Pilots shut down the TWA airliner's left wing engine when fuel
began leaking from the wing, said Don Morrison, an airline
spokesman in St. Louis.
   ``The captain was not able to do anything to stop the leak, and
made a precautionary landing in Hilo,'' Morrison said.
   TWA Flight 235, bound from Los Angeles, reported it was low on
fuel and 450 miles out of Honolulu at 11:30 p.m. HST Sunday,
according to Dick Hallen, a Federal Aviation Administration duty
officer in Los Angeles.
   The L-1011 was instructed to divert to Hilo International
Airport on Hawaii Island, southernmost and easternmost in the
Hawaiian chain and more than 200 miles from Honolulu, Hallen said.
   The plane landed safely at 12:40 a.m., escorted by two F-15 jet
fighters from the Hawaii Air National Guard and a Coast Guard C-130
search-and-rescue airplane, according to Christopher Kimbrough, a
spokesman for the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in Honolulu.
   Marilyn Kali, a state Transportation Department spokeswoman,
said fire-crash rescue workers could see fuel leaking after the
plane landed. The landing, however, was described as routine.
   Morrison said the cause of the leak was under investigtion.
   The plane carried 190 passengers and 15 crew members. The
passengers were brought to Honolulu aboard a chartered plane,
Morrison said.
