   A hint that a missing couple from Wheaton College
are still alive has come from an unlikely source _ a vacation book
on Hawaii checked out of a suburban Chicago library and found in
Minnesota.
   The book was returned to the Wheaton Public Library from a St.
Paul, Minn., post office where it was found. It had been checked
out with Scott Swanson's library card, police said Wednesday.
   Swanson, 23, and Carolyn MacLean, 21, have not been seen since
April 2. Their luxury car was found in a downtown Chicago alley
with most of their belongings undisturbed and the keys still in the
ignition.
   Police initially suspected the couple had met with foul play.
But some of the circumstances surrounding their disappearance _
they were married secretly about a week earlier _ led to
speculation they may have eloped.
   Commander Ettore DiVito, who is heading the investigation, said
the book, ``Hidden Hawaii: The Adventurer's Guide'' was checked out
of the Wheaton library on March 29 and was found Saturday in St.
Paul.
   Although DiVito decline to chacterize the find as a
``breakthrough'' in the investigation, when he was asked whether
police believed the couple may have been in St. Paul and headed for
Hawaii, he replied: `It's a possibility. We're checking out both
possibilities.
   ``We're sending flyers to St. Paul, to the missing persons
division of their police department and we're making contact with
the appropriate authorities in Hawaii,'' DiVito said.
   Acquaintances have told police the two were saving money for a
trip before their disappearance, that Ms. MacLean had recently
purchased $600 worth of clothes and some excerpts found in her
diary were about trips to exotic locales.
   The couple was to have arrived at the Swanson family home in
Elgin the night of April 2 after visiting Ms. MacLean's grandmother
in Flint, Mich.
