<LEADPARA>  The administration's top mass-transit official and senior subordinates
island-hopped in Hawaii recently, enjoying steeply discounted luxury
accommodations on a junket arranged by a Washington lobbyist seeking $360
million in federal transit aid for Hawaii.;    The official, Brian W. Clymer,
head of the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, was accompanied by his
recently promoted director of communications and external affairs, Nancy M.
Butler, who earns $87,000 a year. Also in Clymer's party were Hiram J. Walker,
a senior transit-agency evaluator of Hawaii's grant proposal, and Walker's
wife and son.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     There is no public transportation on two of the three islands the
delegation visited, islanders said, aside from a few vans to transport the
elderly and the disabled.;    All three officials refused to be interviewed
about their trip March 25-29 and referred all questions to their agency's
public affairs office.;    Expense accounts obtained through the Freedom of
Information Act show the officials spent a night at a plush Maui resort
fronting a beach recently declared America's finest, another at a honeymoon
hotel on the island of Hawaii and two nights at Honolulu's Sheraton Waikiki,
where the suite Clymer occupied usually goes for $525.;    Thanks to lobbyist
Denis J. Dwyer and cooperative Hawaiian politicians, no day's lodging costs on
the Monday-through-Friday tour exceeded $97, the maximum daily reimbursement
for federal officials traveling in Hawaii on business.;    Bids are due May 15
on a proposed 17-mile elevated rail system to relieve Honolulu's traffic
congestion. State and local officials are "currently negotiating" with the
Urban Mass Transportation Administration to pay 30 percent of its cost, said a
spokesman for the agency, Jerry Brown.;    Travel records indicate that the
team worked only one full day, March 27, on Oahu. Otherwise, the entourage
spent most of its time on the islands of Maui and Hawaii, travel records
show.;    On Maui, they and lobbyist Dwyer checked into the Kapalua Bay Hotel,
where Clymer and Butler each paid $95 a night for $290 rooms, travel records
indicate. According to local officials, Clymer and his party had only one
90-minute meeting on Maui, arranged by Dwyer on a state holiday.;    Clymer's
party had no meetings on the island of Hawaii, even though Clymer's official
itinerary showed one.;    One person listed as attending, Honolulu
Transportation Director Joseph Magaldi, reached by a reporter on the day the
meeting was to have occurred, knew nothing of it.;    With the taxpayers
picking up their air fares, their meals and their discounted lodging, the
excursion appears to have cost Walker $22.96 in out-of-pocket expenses, Butler
$24.50 and Clymer $20, according to their expense reports.  </TEXT>
