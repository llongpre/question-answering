   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed Tuesday in
anticipation of heavy surf from Hurricane Dalilia, and residents
were urged to stock up on emergency supplies, although the storm
appeared to turn away.
   At 2 p.m. HST Tuesday, the hurricane was 450 miles southeast of
Hilo, on Hawaii Island, moving slightly north of a westerly course
at 12 mph, the National Weather Service said. Its maximum sustained
wind speed was 75 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that
speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 90 mph.
   The weather service said it was too early to tell whether the
slight shift north portended a significant change in course or
whether it meant Dalilia had a ``wobbling eye,'' a fairly common
phenomenon among hurricanes.
   If the hurricane took a more northwesterly course, it would pass
closer to the southern coasts of the islands, the service said in a
statement.
   Earlier in the day, data provided by the crew of an Air Force
hurricane-hunting airplane indicated the hurricane's center was
slightly farther south than it was Monday, said Clarence Lee, head
of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center here.
   If it continued on the track determined by the airplane, Dalilia
would pass 250 miles south of Hawaii Island, southernmost in the
Hawaiian chain, Wednesday morning, Lee said.
   Dalilia's rapid westerly movement had slowed by nearly half from
20 mph during a 24-hour period, he added.
   ``Dalilia's current location and apparent movement is a favorable
sign for Hawaii,'' Lee said. ``If the trend continues, the hurricane
may pass far south of the island chain and the only effect ... would
be an increase in surf along the southern coasts of the islands.''
   A tropical storm watch remained in effect for Hawaii Island,
meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were possible if Dalilia
moved farther north than expected.
   Hawaii Island residents were urged to stock up on batteries,
canned goods and other emergency supplies in case the storm veered
northward.
   A high surf advisory was issued for beaches along the south shore
of Hawaii Island, southernmost in the Hawaiian chain, in
anticipation of waves as high as 15 feet.
   ``We're going to be keeping these beaches closed as a
precautionary measure,'' said Bruce Butts, a spokesman for Hawaii
County Civil Defense. ``The tides are pretty high. That will make
surf especially dangerous.''
