   Japanese demand for golf, Hawaii's sunny climate
and a limited supply of land for housing have political leaders
here asking for up to $100 million as par for the course.
   The idea to charge golf course developers ``community impact
fees'' to pay for rental housing has drawn support of Gov. John
Waihee and Honolulu Mayor Frank Fasi.
   Supporters call it a way to force developers - who stand to make
huge profits exploiting Hawaii's limited land - to give something
back to the community. Critics say it's a tempting but legally
questionable scheme to tax developers under the guise of state and
county land-use regulations.
   With about 50 golf courses being proposed statewide by various
developers - many of them Japanese - proceeds to the local
government under the plan could climb well into the billions of
dollars. Some developers are ready to pay.
   Jurigi Co. of Japan agreed to pay Honolulu $111 million for a
just-completed $40 million municipal golf course near Pearl Harbor
and $200 million more in community impact fees for permission to
build two more courses on Oahu, where Honolulu is located.
   The City Council rejected the proposal, but its chairman, Arnold
Morgado, agrees with the concept.
   In September, Morgado, the governor and the mayor said golf
courses take up land that could be used for housing, and ``require
large tracts of undeveloped land at or near locations which have
scenic, recreational or cultural significance to the community.''
Fasi said the fees would be subject to negotiation.
   Hawaii's leaders are trying to cash in on high-priced
memberships in Hawaii golf courses being peddled in Japan.
   For instance, Shinwa Golf Corp., owner of the Wailea Resort on
the island of Maui, has offered Japanese citizens 1,000 memberships
at $115,000 each in a new Wailea golf course.
   University of Hawaii Professor David Callies, an expert on
land-use law, said impact fees have been found unconstitutional
when they exceed a development's actual effect on such things as
roads, sewers and the environment.
   ``Impact fees are not revenue-raising tools and golf courses are
appropriate open space uses in the right places,'' Callies said.
   ``It is difficult to see how a golf course generates $100
million in infrastructure costs, which is the sole legal basis for
charging such a fee,'' he said.
   Dan Davidson, executive director of the Land Use Research
Foundation, a research and trade organization for landowners and
developers, said impact fees are tempting from a fiscal standpoint.
   ``It is, however, a tax and the city has no authority to impose
this sort of tax in the guise of a land-use regulation,'' he said.
   Harold Masumoto, director of the state's planning office, said
Hawaii could avoid the potential problem of linking golf course
fees to actual impacts by entering into development agreements.
   That way it would not be an impact fee, but a mutual agreement
by the developer to make a contribution to a rental housing fund,
he said.
   In 1988, the state Land Use Commission decided that major
developers had to make 60 percent of their homes ``affordable'' for
low- and middle-income families.
   In August, the same group for the first time imposed the
governor's new policy of requiring hotel and resort developers to
create one non-tourism job for every hotel room they build, or pay
the state $25,000 per room.
   Wali Osman, director of research for the real estate firm Monroe
&amp; Friedlander Inc., said the trend is a result of the state's
frustration in handling housing problems and diversifying the
economy through traditional means. He said exactions from
developers won't solve the housing problems.
   The state is going ahead anyway.
   Last month, the Board of Land and Natural Resources proposed
that Minami Group USA pay $15 million in impact fees in exchange
for extending a permit to complete a $100 million golf course on
land zoned for conservation use. The extension was needed because
rain had delayed construction.
   An attorney for Minami told the board he doubted the legality of
the new proposed assessments, but said his client wanted to be ``a
responsible neighbor'' and was willing to work with the state and
local groups.
