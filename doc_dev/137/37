SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO

A Coast Guard plane Monday continued to patrol the South Pacific in search of a 
San Diego family missing at sea. 
</P>
<P>
Graham and Sheri Hughes, together with their sons, Alex, 21, and Ryan, 15, were 
sailing their 39-foot sloop Sea Dreamer on the return leg of a summer-long 
cruise, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Scott Hartvigsen from the Honolulu 
headquarters. The four were last seen July 29, when they left the Palmyra 
island chain 800 miles south of Hawaii, Hartvigsen said.

The Sea Dreamer failed to arrive in Hawaii on Aug. 16 as expected, and harbor 
checks in Hawaii and along the California coast turned up no trace of the boat, 
Hartvigsen said. Coast Guard planes searched unsuccessfully off the Southern 
California coast one day last week on the chance that the Hugheses had bypassed 
Hawaii, according to Chief Quartermaster Mark Vavra in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Since Saturday, Coast Guard planes based in Hawaii have covered more than 
300,000 square miles of the South Pacific in search of the family. The search 
will be suspended Thursday if the boat has not been found by then, Hartvigsen 
said.
