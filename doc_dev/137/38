   A passenger on the Aloha Airlines jet that blew
open in flight took dramatic photographs of the pilot and co-pilot
assisting passengers after the plane's precarious but safe
emergency landing.
   Robert Nichols, 61, of Kailua, Hawaii, was carrying a camera for
business use Thursday on the flight from Hilo, on Hawaii Island, to
Honolulu. Nichols, an executive of Tropical Rent-A-Car, said he had
inspected and photographed a building under construction in Hilo
that morning.
   Nichols said that when he saw the upper fuselage of the Boeing
737 blow away, he took a piece of paper from a magazine and began
writing.
   ``I didn't know how long I had,'' said Nichols, but he started
keeping a log, pouring out his heart to his wife, Jan, for what he
was sure was the last time.
   Nichols was uninjured, but after the plane's emergency landing
at Kahului Airport, he was held overnight at Maui Memorial Hospital
because he is recovering from a heart attack.
   Nichols said he was director of Pan American World Airways'
training school for flight attendants for 30 years, and had high
praise for the actions of the flight attendants.
   Nichols said he met his wife 40 years ago on his first flight as
a Pan Am steward.
