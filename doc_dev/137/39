   A TWA jumbo jet made an emergency landing after
developing a fuel leak and running low on fuel, and airline
officials said they weren't sure how close it came to a forced
ditching in the Pacific.
   TWA's Flight 235, bound from Los Angeles to Honolulu with 205
people aboard, landed early Monday at Hilo International Airport on
the island of Hawaii, 200 miles southeast of Honolulu, because it
was the closest airport, said TWA spokesman Don Morrison in St.
Louis.
   Asked about a televised news report here that the Lockheed
L-1011 had about four minutes of fuel left when it landed, Morrison
said that had not been determined.
   Passenger Domenic Silvestri said he could hear crewmembers
behind a curtain reviewing ditching procedures.
   The pilot reported at 11:30 p.m. HST Sunday that the jet was low
on fuel and 450 miles out of Honolulu, and was instructed to divert
to Hilo, said Dick Hallen, a Federal Aviation Administration duty
officer in Los Angeles.
   Going to Hilo cut about 110 miles off the flight, according to
an FAA calculation.
   Morrison said the plane's left engine was shut down after the
crew realized fuel was leaking from the wing.
   ``The captain was not able to do anything to stop the leak,'' he
said.
   Passengers said they were only told that something was wrong
with the left engine.
   Two F-15 fighters from the Hawaii Air National Guard and a Coast
Guard C-130 search-and-rescue airplane escorted the TWA plane to
Hilo, where it made a routine landing at 12:40 a.m., said
Christopher Kimbrough of the Joint Rescue Coordination Center in
Honolulu.
   Fire-crash rescue crews could see fuel leaking from the wing
after it landed, said Marilyn Kali, a state Transportation
Department spokeswoman.
   Morrison said the cause of the leak was under investigation.
   The 190 passengers, including rock singer Bobby Brown, were kept
at the Hilo airport terminal until dawn when they were put on
chartered jets to take them to Honolulu.
   ``It was rough, but I'm glad we got home safely. I'm glad the
Lord brought us here,'' said Brown, who came for a series of
concerts.
   However, he and other passengers complained about their
treatment at Hilo.
   ``It was like being held hostage, you know, by your own people,
by TWA,'' Brown said.
   Other passengers complained they were given no food or drink and
had to contend with dirty restrooms during their wait.
