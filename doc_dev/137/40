<LEADPARA>  FOR six minutes on the morning of July 11 on the Big Island of Hawaii, all
eyes will be on the heavens. That is the day the moon and sun will cross,
creating a total eclipse of the sun.;    Upward of 20,000 visitors are
expected on the Big Island for the phenomenon, which will not be visible from
the same location for another 360 years. Many more people will settle for the
astronomical cheap seats on other Hawaiian islands, which will experience up
to a 99 percent eclipse.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     American Express, in cooperation with Honolulu's Bishop Museum and
Planetarium, has several packages available.;    You can choose condominiums
either in Kona on the Big Island, or on Oahu or Maui with a Big Island
excursion on eclipse day. All packages include eclipse viewing from Waikoloa
Village Stables as well as a post-eclipse champagne breakfast.;    Sample
prices for, respectively, each of two people in a one-bedroom condo or each of
four in a two-bedroom condo: six nights and seven days in Kona, $1,052 and
$788; four nights and five days on Maui, $792 and $731; three nights and four
days on Oahu, $682 and $622.;    Maui and Oahu packages include round-trip
transportation and transfers on eclipse day.;    The Big Island-based Momentum
Travel, reachable at (808) 329-0536 or (800) 346-0276, is offering seven-night
packages at hotels ranging from the Keauhou in Kona for $1,475 a person to the
opulent Mauna Lani Bay Hotel at $2,875 a person. Most of its packages include
a car; all include air fare from the West Coast.; (hbox);    While the eclipse
is being given star billing, it is not the only happening, or reason, for
visiting Hawaii this year.;    The Big Island, which happens to be home to the
southernmost point in the United States -- the town of Naalehu -- will also
celebrate the 200th anniversary of the building of a temple by King
Kamehameha. The celebration on Aug. 17 will be one of Hawaiian traditions.;   
On Oahu, just beyond Honolulu, the Polynesian Cultural Center now offers a
huge IMAX film presentation, "Polynesian Odyssey," which depicts the
settlement and cultures of the Pacific. Also in Honolulu, the Dole Cannery,
the ninth-most-popular visitor attraction, has expanded its pineapple cannery
tour, and Atlantis Submarines, which offers a below-the-seas view of Hawaii,
will have a second sub operating off Waikiki this summer.; (hbox);    Hawaii
expects a decline in tourists from Japan, which has produced the biggest
influx of visitors in the last decade. A poll of 40 Japanese travel agents
showed Hawaii bookings down almost 20 percent for February through April. The
Hawaii Visitors Bureau attributed the expected decline to comments made during
the Persian Gulf war from a Japanese politician, Shokei Arai, who said package
trips by young Japanese were inappropriate at a time when young Americans and
Europeans were on the battle front.; (hbox);    The number of visitors to
Hawaii in January dropped 7.6 percent, the Hawaii Visitors Bureau reported.;  
 A total of 537,040 people came to Hawaii the first month of 1991, a decrease
of 44,000 compared to the same period last year. The decline is blamed on war,
recession and the threat of terrorism.;    The only island to project an
increase was Lanai, where the number of visitors rose 15.2 percent to 4,330
people. The number of visitors to Oahu fell 5.7 percent to 411,210. Maui's
visitor count fell 9.6 percent to 167,900. Figures from the Big Island showed
a 4 percent decline to 100,270. The visitor count for Kauai fell 6.4 percent
to 90,660. Molokai experienced a decline of 5.7 percent to 8,750 visitors.  </TEXT>
