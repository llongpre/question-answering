<DESCRIPT>  HAWAII; TRAVEL  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  THE Big Island of Hawaii has launched a campaign to attract new waves of
tourists. A lineup of locals calling themselves BIG (Big Island Group) has
installed an 800 hot line. Callers get a 16-page brochure containing
background on accommodations, beaches, sightseeing, tips on visiting Kilauea,
updates on the Kohala Coast and more. Call (800) 648-2441.;   Besides hotels
and resorts, the Big Island is heavy into bed-and-breakfast businesses.
Barbara Campbell, a familiar figure for years at the popular Kona Village,
will put you into B&amp;Bs at dozens of locations. Besides the Big Island,
Campbell represents 60 B&amp;Bs on Oahu, Kauai, Maui and Molokai. Campbell
personally inspects each property. And she's fussy. Next door to her own home
on Hawaii at Kamuela, Campbell operates a charming B&amp;B in a cottage featuring
two units ($90 to $95) with their own kitchen facilities.  </LEADPARA>
