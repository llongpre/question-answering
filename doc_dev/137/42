   A U.S. Coast Guard cutter escorted a Soviet
research vessel into Hilo Harbor so a crew member could be treated
for an eye ailment, a Coast Guard spokesman said today
   The 150-foot Fedor Matisen, which tied up Friday night at Hawaii
Island, also was allowed to take on water during the medical
stopover, Christopher Kimbrough said.
   A paramedic from the Hawaii County Fire Department was ferried
to the Fedor Matisen aboard the cutter Cape Cross earlier Friday to
verify the man's ailment, Bob Schenck, another Coast Guard
spokesman, said Friday night. The ailment prevented the man from
looking into bright light, Schenck said.
   The Soviet vessel was scheduled to leave Hilo today, Kimbrough
said.
