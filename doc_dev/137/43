   The bombing of Kahoolawe has stopped. The
question is, for how long?
   Use of the pockmarked, 27,000-acre island by the military for
target practice has been suspended for two years. The political
maneuvering over who ultimately will get control of Kahoolawe is
just beginning.
   The dry, mostly barren island 10 miles west of Maui has been
ravaged by 49 years of conventional bombing by U.S. planes and
warships. Some historical sites have been damaged, the landscape
has been scarred and topsoil has been lost to erosion caused by
bombs and grazing goats and sheep. The bombing has also been a
source of deep pain for native Hawaiians who view the island, with
its ancient shrines, as a sacred place.
   The former penal colony and cattle ranch was seized by the Navy
in 1941 after Pearl Harbor. Kahoolawe had been used for target
bombing since 1953, until President Bush signed the 1991 Defense
Appropriations Bill on Nov. 5.
   The bill contained an amendment sponsored by Sen. Daniel Akaka,
D-Hawaii, that puts a halt to the bombing for two years. The law
also established a commission to help determine the best way to
return the island to the state.
   But the threat of war in the Middle East has military officials
pressing for limited use of the island. Some who worked to halt the
bombing worry that Bush may issue an executive order permitting
military use of the island if war begins with Iraq.
   The Kahoolawe Island Conveyance Commission includes two
appointees from Gov. John Waihee, two Navy appointees and an
appointee from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs. The commission's
first meeting was scheduled for today.
   The panel can recommend a ban on all military use or allow the
military unlimited or partial access to the island. The three
non-Navy appointees oppose any bombing. The panel's recommendations
are subject to approval by Congress.
   Cmdr. Joel Keefer, a spokesman for the Navy's Pacific Command,
said Kahoolawe is needed to train troops for the long term, not
just for Operation Desert Shield.
   ``Kahoolawe offers us the only place for the kind of training we
need to perform ... aircraft, gunfire support, amphibious
landings,'' Keefer said. ``We have forces in the Pacific and we
need to train them where they are.''
   Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, has flip-flopped on the the issue
twice in recent months. He was a longtime advocate of the
military's use of Kahoolawe, then came out in support of Akaka's
bill before the November election and pledged to work for the
return of the island to Hawaii.
   Last week, he said the island is needed to train troops for
Operation Desert Shield.
   Inouye's reversal ``disappointed many of us,'' said Dr. Noa
Emmett Aluli, co-founder of the Protect Kahoolawe Ohana and a
member of the commission. Aluli helped form the Protect Kahoolawe
Ohana in 1975 and has taken part in several ``occupations'' of the
island to prevent target bombing.
   Aluli said the island holds a special spiritual and cultural
significance to native Hawaiians. Ancient Hawaiians were the only
people ever to inhabit the island. There are fishing shrines,
agricultural shrines, major temples and housing sites, which have
landed Kahoolawe on the National Register of Historic Places.
   ``The history of our ancient Hawaiian people is intact on
Kahoolawe,'' Aluli said. ``No way will I allow a resumption of
bombing.''
   Maui Mayor Hannibal Tavares, another commission member, said as
the western part of Maui becomes more populated bombing of
Kahoolawe becomes more dangerous because errant shells can strike
the cities of Lahaina and Kihei.
   Tavares and others say the military has better sites to train
personnel for a desert war, including desert areas near bases in
California, Nevada and Texas.
   It's unclear how much it would cost to restore the island.
   Aluli said the government should find money to ``green'' the
island back to its natural state, whatever the cost.
