   A tropical storm watch was posted for the
120,000 residents of Hawaii Island as a ``dangerous'' Hurricane
Fabio and its 125 mph gusts churned toward the Hawaiian Islands
today, forecasters said.
   At 2 a.m. today (8 a.m. EDT) the storm's center was 530 miles
east-southeast of Hilo and 740 miles east-southeast of Honolulu,
with a course and speed that would bring it just south of Hawaii,
the southernmost island in the chain, on Friday.
   If the course and speed remained unchanged, it would be near
Oahu, the most populous island of 850,000 where Honolulu is
located, on Saturday, forecasters said.
   Maximum sustained winds were 105 mph, with tropical force winds
between 39 mph and 73 mph extending 180 miles from the center. The
intensity diminished from early Wednesday when gusts reached 175
mph.
   ``It's a large storm and quite intense,'' said Hans Rosendal, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Honolulu.
   ``It likely will come quite close to the islands. It is still a
dangerous storm.''
   A track up the chain's western side would bring the more intense
and dangerous side of the storm over the islands, he said.
   Although the storm had not weakened in six hours, Rosendal said
storms usually diminish in strength as they move away from the
equator and over cooler waters.
   Supermarkets contacted around the state Wednesday said they had
not noticed any big rush to buy items as batteries, candles,
charcoal or canned goods that Civil Defense officials advised
residents to have on hand.
   Observers assigned to spend Wednesday night on Hawaii Island's
east coast to watch for rising surf generated by the approaching
storm reported no problems, said Bruce Butts, operations officer
for the Hawaii County Civil Defense.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
skirted Oahu and ran over Kauai and Niihau in November 1982 with
117 mph winds, causing $234 million damage. There were no deaths
officially attributed to that storm.
