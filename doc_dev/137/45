   A hurricane with reduced top winds of 100 mph
spun toward Hawaii Sunday, bringing the threat of high waves and
warnings to stay off the beach.
   Hurricane Marie, was centered about 380 miles east-southeast of
Hilo on the island of Hawaii Sunday afternoon, and showed more
signs of weakening, the National Weather Service said.
   Sustained winds near its eye fell to 80 mph, with top gusts
reaching 100 mph. The hurricane was expected to be downgraded to
tropical storm status Sunday night once sustained winds dropped
below 75 mph, forecaster Tim Craig said.
   Gale force winds, which range from 39 mph to 54 mph, extended
150 miles from the center of the hurricane. Waves kicked up by the
storm were expected to reach Hawaii, known as the Big Island, late
Sunday or early Monday, the weather service said.
   All ocean and beach activities along the southern and eastern
coasts of Hawaii should be halted because of the high surf danger,
Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim said.
   Hurricane Marie, moving westward at about 10 mph, would pass
about 70 miles off the southern tip of Hawaii on Monday if it
maintains its course and speed. On Tuesday it would pass about 200
miles south of Oahu, the island where Honolulu is located, the
weather service said.
   To monitor rising surf, residents along the affected coastlines
will maintain a watch and report to Civil Defense officials, Kim
said.
   The last major storm to hit the Hawaiian islands was Hurricane
Iwa, which struck on Nov. 24, 1982 and caused $234 million damage,
primarily to the islands of Oahu and Kauai.
