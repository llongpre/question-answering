   The strongest earthquake to hit Hawaii in
six years shook a sparsely populated area of Hawaii Island already
ravaged by lava, destroying two homes and generating a small tidal
wave.
   No serious injuries were reported.
   Authorities were investigating reports of damage to other homes
Monday, said Hawaii County Civil Defense Administrator Harry Kim.
   ``Our first priority this morning is to check certain remote
areas to make sure no one is trapped in their homes,'' Kim said.
``Early reports we are getting indicate no one is trapped.''
   The temblor, caused by the 6{-year-old eruption of Kilauea
Volcano, struck Sunday evening and measured 6.1 on the Richter
scale, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
   It was centered west of Kalapana, a small coastal town on the
south flank of the volcano, said Bruce Turner, a geophysicist at the
Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Honolulu.
   The quake was triggered by the release of pressure generated by
the movement of underground magma, or molten rock, said Bob
Koyanagi, a seismic analyst at the Geological Survey's Hawaiian
Volcano Observatory.
   Reggie Okamura, a spokesman for the observatory, said scientists
had recorded numerous aftershocks. The strongest, measuring 4.0 on
the Richter scale, was recorded Sunday night, he said.
   Kilauea lava has destroyed 68 homes in the Kalapana area since
its latest eruption began Jan. 3, 1983. Four homes were destroyed in
May, and last Thursday a Hawaii Volcanoes National Park visitor
center burst into flames as lava crept beneath the wooden structure.
   Koyanagi said pressure became too great within the world's most
active volcano, causing its south flank to move and triggering the
earthquake.
   The tidal wave, which measured 22.8 inches high at Honuapo, 8.4
inches at Kapoho and 5.6 inches at Hilo, caused no damage, Turner
said.
   Five people were injured by falling debris inside homes, but none
required hospitalization, Kim said. Crews were working to repair
downed power lines.
   It was the strongest earthquake to hit the state since Nov. 15,
1983, when a 6.6 temblor caused several million dollars damage on
Hawaii Island.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
