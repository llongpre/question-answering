<HEAD>Rescue Team Recovers Seven Bodies, Find Four Other Victims of Crash</HEAD>

   Rescue workers descended down ropes from a
helicopter to recover the bodies of seven of the 11 people who died
when a sightseeing plane crashed into a steep valley wall.
   County firefighters and national park rangers found the bodies of
the other four passengers, but the recovery was suspended at
nightfall Tuesday. They planned to return to the remote site this
morning.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft slammed into an 1,800-foot high wall
at the back of Waipio Valley on Hawaii Island, shortly after taking
off Sunday from Hilo Airport en route to Kahului on the island of
Maui. There were no survivors.
   The wreckage of the plane was spread over a 300-foot-long,
fire-scarred swath in the thick vegetation. It was found just after
dawn Tuesday by helicopters that tracked the signal from the plane's
emergency locator transmitter.
   Heavy rains and low clouds had prevented aircraft from searching
the area Monday.
   ``Most of it was all disintegrated,'' said Hawaii County Deputy
Fire Chief Edward Bumatay. ``The biggest part they could find was
the engine down in the bottom of the valley.''
   The bodies were taken Tuesday night to Hilo Hospital, where work
was to begin on identification, said Bruce Butts, operations officer
for the county Civil Defense Agency.
   Eight of the 10 passengers were identified late Tuesday as Peter
Spillane and Ann Herbert, both of Sydney, Australia; Jack Merle and
Shirley Merle of Russellville, Ark.; a Ms. Statler of Blue Mound,
Ill.; Sylvie Martel and Nicole Beland of Canada; and Robert Wren,
61, an English professor at the University of Houston.
   Two women whose names were withheld pending the notification of
their families were from Torrance, Calif., and New York City, said
T.C. Campbell, operations manager for Scenic Air Tours Hawaii, the
carrier.
   The plane's pilot, Pascal Meric, 28, of Honolulu, had about 4,000
hours flying experience, said Doug Rogers, chief pilot for Scenic
Air Tours.
   The crash was the first in the company's nine-year history.
   A National Transportation Safety Board team was expected to begin
an investigation today into the cause of the crash.
   It was Hawaii's fourth major airline accident in two years.
   In December 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with
eight people aboard disappeared during a flight from Honolulu to
Molokai Island.
   In April 1988, a flight attendant died and dozens were injured
when the front third of the top section of an Aloha Airlines jet's
passenger cabin blew away in flight.
   In February, nine passengers were hurled to their deaths when a
cargo door and a huge chunk of fuselage tore off a United Airlines
jumbo jet some 100 miles south of Honolulu.
