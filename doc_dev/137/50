Kaolelo Ulaleo remembers trekking with his grandmother into the rain forest, an 
enchanting place where feathery ferns grew tall enough to dwarf a small boy. 
</P>
<P>
She taught him to pull roots from the moist earth to make tea and pick berries 
for traditional home remedies. 
</P>
<P>
"For me, Wao Kele is the spoon that feeds you," said 41-year-old Ulaleo, who 
has continued to visit the forest throughout his adult life. "You come inside, 
and everywhere is God." 
</P>
<P>
Today, other visitors have come to the forest that Ulaleo treasures, known as 
Wao Kele o Puna, or Rain Belt of Puna, on the island of Hawaii. Their mark is 
less subtle. 
</P>
<P>
The bulldozers of True Geothermal Energy Co. have cleared several acres of 
trees and tangled undergrowth in hopes of tapping volcanic steam for a 
25-megawatt power plant. In the process, the industrial newcomers have taken 
center stage in the struggle over the future of the last major tract of lowland 
tropical rain forest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents in Hawaii and on the mainland argue that geothermal development could 
destroy a unique and fragile ecosystem by slicing through it with a web of 
pipes, generators and transmission lines. Hawaii's forests are especially 
prized because most of their plants and animals are found nowhere else in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
"The greatest danger to any tropical forest is fragmentation," said Dan Taylor, 
chief of resources management at nearby Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. "It can 
only go so far before the whole system collapses." 
</P>
<P>
Formal challenges have quietly and laboriously made their way through the 
courts and government hearing rooms for years. Ironically, geothermal energy is 
usually considered an environmentally benign alternative, and partly for that 
reason, the early local skirmishes attracted little notice beyond Hawaii's 
shores. But the issue of the rain forest changed all that. 
</P>
<P>
"How can we expect to save the rain forests in Brazil and Malaysia if we can't 
save our own?" asked Suzanne Head of the San Francisco-based Rainforest Action 
Network, which has seized on the case as a test for the environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
As drilling begins in the forest, the struggle has moved into the streets. 
</P>
<P>
Five people were arrested in late October for trying to block trucks hauling 
equipment to the site, 3 miles deep into the rain forest. Two weeks ago, 
protesters staged sit-ins at the offices of Gov. John Waihee and held all-night 
vigils outside to dramatize their call for a moratorium on geothermal 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Wao Kele o Puna is just part of a sprawling geothermal resource zone designated 
by the state on the eastern slope of Kilauea Volcano. An ambitious plan 
designed to promote Hawaii's energy independence calls for geothermal plants to 
produce up to 500 megawatts of power, much of it to be carried through undersea 
pipes to Honolulu and elsewhere in this island chain. 
</P>
<P>
Over the years the plan has provoked opposition from various quarters, with the 
arguments ranging from the spiritual to the practical. 
</P>
<P>
Some native Hawaiians consider geothermal drilling a violation of the volcano 
goddess, Pele, and have appealed all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, without 
success. Now they are challenging the legality of the state's transfer of 
27,000 acres of forest land, including Wao Kele o Puna, to a private estate for 
development. The case is on appeal to the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
Nearby residents, soured by noise and noxious fumes from a small, experimental 
plant outside the forest, have argued against geothermal development on health 
and safety grounds. They also question the wisdom of drilling near an active 
volcano. 
</P>
<P>
But the issue that has grabbed the most attention in this environmentally 
conscious age is the threat to the rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not just a native Hawaiian struggle any more," said Palikapu Dedman, 
president of the Pele Defense Fund, which has led the legal fight. "It's 
everybody's struggle now." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii's once extensive lowland forests have been all but consumed since the 
first Polynesian voyagers arrived. The Puna forest's inaccessibility and 
proximity to the volcano have helped protect it, until now. Naturalists argue 
that a geothermal network in the area would hasten the invasion of aggressive, 
non-native species that have decimated other areas. They also fear the effects 
of noise, lights and emissions on wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
Tropical rain forests have moved to the forefront of environmental concerns in 
the past few years as fears over global warming have heightened. The forests 
are considered crucibles of life itself because they help regulate the Earth's 
climate and house nearly half of all plant and animal species. But these rich 
habitats are fast disappearing as developing countries clear vast areas for 
timber or agriculture. An estimated 50 million acres a year is destroyed 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists blame global warming on such deforestation and the burning of wood 
and fossil fuels. Leaders of industrialized nations, including President Bush, 
have called on their Third World counterparts to stop the plunder of the rain 
forests. Although Wao Kele o Puna is tiny by comparison to other tropical 
forests, environmentalists consider it strategically important to their 
crusade. 
</P>
<P>
The 25,000-member Rainforest Action Network has begun distributing leaflets to 
Hawaii-bound travelers at West Coast airports, with fluorescent green stickers 
that read "Save Hawaii's rain forests. Stop the Big Island power plant, or I 
stop traveling." It also plans a demonstration Dec. 14 at True Geothermal's 
Casper, Wyo., headquarters and simultaneous protests in Hawaii and California. 
And it is calling for a boycott of Hawaii-made products. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of people have emotional attachments to Hawaii because it's unique and 
beautiful," Head said. "Given the visibility of the rain forest issue and the 
fact that this one is in our country, I think there is a pretty good chance of 
actually stopping the project." 
</P>
<P>
But geothermal energy has strong allies in Hawaii. Along with the electric 
utility, the state government promotes geothermal power as a cheap, clean and 
indigenous source of energy. 
</P>
<P>
"Of all the options, geothermal continues to be the most attractive," said 
Maurice Kaya of the state's energy program office. "The power is available 24 
hours a day, and the money doesn't leave the state." 
</P>
<P>
Hawaii depends on oil, most of it foreign, for 90% of its energy needs. While 
the islands have abundant wind and sunshine, those energy sources are 
intermittent and expensive compared to geothermal, Kaya said. 
</P>
<P>
Allan Kawada, Hawaii representative for True Geothermal, said the company chose 
to drill here because of the state's commitment to geothermal energy. The 
developer, he noted, has already endured an exhaustive permit process and plans 
to use just 350 acres of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
"We've gone through about seven years of regulatory approvals," he said. "These 
issues have all been discussed at length many times, not just once. We feel we 
have the right to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
Geothermal development was originally slated for another forest, known as 
Kahaualea, further upland on the volcano's rift zone. But naturalists -- and 
nature itself -- intervened. While the proposed drilling was being contested as 
a threat to a pristine native ecosystem, Kilauea Volcano began to erupt in 1983 
and eventually buried much of the area in fresh lava. Some native Hawaiians 
suggest that Pele was making her feelings known about geothermal development. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, the state Board of Land and Natural Resources agreed to exchange the 
private estate lands at Kahaualea for the state-owned Wao Kele o Puna to allow 
geothermal development in the lowland forest. Environmentalists supported the 
trade because, like most highland areas, Kahaualea's ecosystem was more intact 
than Wao Kele o Puna. But that hasn't stopped them from trying to save Wao Kele 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
"Those same people were who were saying 'Go down to the Natural Area Reserve' 
are now saying that we should preserve it," complained Kawada, shaking his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Lamoureux, a professor of botany at the University of Hawaii and a 
consultant to the developer, contends that the threat to the Wao Kele has been 
exaggerated. The forest is not pristine, and drilling sites were chosen to 
minimize the impact on native ecosystems, he said. He also discounts the threat 
of emissions, noting that 
</P>
<P>
wildlife here has evolved around volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
"There are patches of good forest and there are patches that aren't," Lamoureux 
said. "The best lowland forest is outside of the geothermal zone. . . . We're 
talking about meddling with an area that has already been trashed by strawberry 
guava, mynah birds and wild pigs (non-native species). I'm not convinced this 
project will have any measurable effect." 
</P>
<P>
But other natural scientists disagree. While foreign plants have infested parts 
of the Puna forest, much of it is considered a rare collection of varied 
ecosystems that have sprung up after successive lava flows over the centuries. 
The forest also boasts large populations of native birds, which elsewhere have 
fled to higher elevations. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a mosaic of different aged forests, from 600 years to the present," 
said Jim Jacobi, a botanist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, who has 
mapped native vegetation throughout Hawaii. "It's a really dynamic set of 
ecosystems that doesn't exist anywhere else in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"We've lost so many areas in Hawaii," he added. "What little we have left is 
priceless." 
</P>
<P>
Because of its distance from any major land mass, Hawaii is considered a 
storehouse of revolutionary wonders. Only a few seeds, birds and insects were 
hardy enough to make their way here after the first volcanic cones burst 
through the ocean's surface millions of years ago. From those few early 
arrivals, a plethora of native species have evolved. 
</P>
<P>
"These are the most isolated islands on the face of the Earth," noted Taylor. 
"More than 90% of Hawaii's biota are endemic, which means they are found only 
here, a far higher rate than anywhere else. So they're of tremendous interest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have many lessons to learn," he said. "But we're tossing the books out 
before we've read them."
