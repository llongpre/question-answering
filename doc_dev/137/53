   A weakening Tropical Storm Dalilia headed past
Hawaii, bringing heavy rain and high winds but no reports of major
damage.
   Hurricane Dalilia weakened to a tropical storm early Wednesday,
but the National Weather Service continued to warn people _
especially residents of the island of Hawaii _ to brace for heavy
rains and high winds.
   At 2 a.m. HST Thursday (8 a.m. EDT today), the storm was about
185 miles south of Honolulu, moving northwest at 13 mph and was
predicted to slowly weaken, according to the weather service.
   The weather service said that was likely the closest it would
come to the state. The storm was 210 miles south-southeast of Oahu,
the most populous island, and was expected to pass within 100 miles
of it today.
   Its maximum sustained wind speed was 63 mph; a storm is
classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted
to 80 mph.
   In Naalehu, the southernmost community in the United States,
residents braced for the worst, but were optimistic they would not
need the water, canned goods, batteries and candles they had hoarded.
   A tropical storm watch for Hawaii Island, the southernmost in the
chain, was upgraded Wednesday to a tropical storm warning, meaning
residents could expect winds up to 73 mph, heavy rains, flooding and
higher than normal surf. A flash flood warning also was in effect.
   A flash flood watch _ less urgent than a warning _ was issued
Wednesday night for Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Lanai as the
weather service reported heavy rain throughout the state.
   ``Because it seems to staying on a course that will bring it
parallel to the islands, we think the main problem might be from the
rain; hopefully the winds won't be too extreme, but we might get
some flooding'' said Hans Rosendal, a weather service forecaster.
   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed for the second day as surf
surged to more than 15 feet on the southeast coast.
