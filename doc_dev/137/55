NATURE SHOWS THE WAY ON FRIENDLY MOLOKAI

Molokai, known for a century for its infamous leper colony, has always been a 
bit off the tourist track. But "The Friendly Isle" has a lot to offer -- 
particularly for the hiker and nature lover. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to get away from it all, Molokai is definitely away from it all. 
The island has a couple of beaches, a lush rain forest, some very modest 
resorts and a natural Hawaiian beauty second to none. What the island doesn't 
have is night life or even one single stoplight. 
</P>
<P>
On the tiny island is Hawaii's largest expanse of old-growth tropical forest. 
With a little time and effort, the intrepid hiker can discover what Kamakou 
Preserve Manager Ed Misaki calls "the real Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
Three of my favorite Molokai hikes include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kalaupapa National Historic Park, which was set aside in 1980 to preserve 
the former place of exile for victims of Hansen's disease (leprosy). For a 
century, those suffering from mai hookaawale (separating sickness) were 
isolated from the rest of the world by the steep lava walls of the Kalaupapa 
Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
By the 1960s, the development of sulfone drugs had brought Hansen's disease 
under control, but many sufferers, isolated for so long from the outside world, 
elected to stay. The historic settlement, formerly a place of almost 
unbelievable misery, is now open to guided tours; the tour leaders are the 
residents themselves, with help from the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
On the tour, visitors view the homes, hospital facilities and stores of the 
settlement, as well as the church built by the courageous Father Damien, who 
arrived in 1873 to work with the afflicted exiles in what was often referred to 
as a "living tomb." After much good work, Father Damien himself eventually 
contracted leprosy and died. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, although long a place of the damned, the Kalaupapa Peninsula is one 
of the most beautiful places in all of Hawaii. Don't miss the short walk 
through Palaau State Park, which provides a panoramic overlook of the 
peninsula. Another trail leads through tall pine trees to much-photographed 
Phallic Rock. 
</P>
<P>
The Molokai Mule Ride (about $80) is the way most people visit the Kalaupapa 
settlement. However, you can hike down for about $30. Even if you hike, you 
must sign up for a tour. It's a six-mile round-trip trek, with 26 switchbacks 
and a 1,600-foot elevation drop. (Save some energy for the steep uphill return 
trip.) 
</P>
<P>
At the bottom of the trail, hikers join the mule riders for a guided walking 
and bus tour of Kalaupapa National Historic Park. The tour includes a box 
lunch. For more information, contact Molokai Mule Ride, P.O. Box 200, Kualapuu, 
Molokai, Hawaii 96757, (800) 843-5978. On the island: 567-6088. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Halawa Valley. Located on the extreme east end of the island, this is a 
good introduction to the joys of tripping afoot on Molokai. 
</P>
<P>
In the valley are some of Hawaii's oldest village sites, dating to AD 650. For 
many centuries farmers cultivated taro on hillside terraces here. Halawa Valley 
is about 20 miles from the isle's main town of Kaunakakai. The drive along 
Kamehameha V Highway (450) to the valley passes ancient fish ponds, churches, 
black-sand beaches and historic markers. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the highway is the trail head for the path through Halawa Valley. 
The trail leads two sometimes-muddy miles past taro patches and guava, and 
through a green jungle to Moaula Falls. The falls fills a rock-rimmed basin, 
which is one of the more scenic swimming pools you'll ever see, though kind of 
chilly. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kawiakou Preserve. Under the watchful eye of the Nature Conservancy, this 
area protects a wondrous rain forest. More than 200 plants grow here and 
nowhere else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
You reach the preserve by driving up a muddy road (sometimes impassable) 
through slopes forested with cedar, eucalyptus and Monterey cypress. Waikolu 
(Three Waters) Overlook offers grand views of waterfalls and steep cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
The first part of the trail through the preserve is on a narrow wooden 
boardwalk that leads through Pepeopae Bog, believed to be 10,000 years old. 
Violets and orchids brighten the primordial ooze. Some plants are but dwarfs of 
their species, while others, such as giant tree ferns, grow to astonishing 
heights. 
</P>
<P>
It's possible to visit the preserve on your own, but an even better way to go 
is to join one of the occasional guided walking tours given by the Nature 
Conservancy.

567-6680.
