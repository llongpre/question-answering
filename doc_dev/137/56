   HONOLULU -- A U.S. judge set back Hawaii's geothermal
energy program by banning federal involvement pending
completion of an environmental impact study.
   State and federal agencies have been working on the island
of Hawaii in recent months to harness geothermal energy from
around the Kilauea Volcano. The island state's goal is to
reduce its nearly total dependence on petroleum exports
through use of geothermal and other alternative energy
sources.

   But a number of environmental groups objected to the
drilling and last year filed a lawsuit in Honolulu federal
court to halt federal participation in the Hawaii Geothermal
Energy Project pending an environmental review, which could
take two years. On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge David Ezra
ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, blocking about $5 million
in federal funding for the project.
   Though nine federal agencies involved in the project now
are prohibited from proceeding, the state of Hawaii has been
conducting its own program that is unaffected.
   Hawaii hopes to generate 25 megawatts of geothermal power
for use on the island by the end of this year, said Maurice
Kaya, energy program administrator for the state. Ultimately,
he said, state officials would like to see geothermal energy
supplied to Oahu and Maui through overland and underseas
cables.
