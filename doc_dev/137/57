   Hurricane Dalilia swirled toward Hawaii on Monday
on a course that would take it 150 miles south of the state's
southernmost island, meteorologists said.
   ``Anything can happen. The way it looks now we may get a little
from it, but not much,'' said Edmund Manning of the Central Pacific
Hurricane Center here. ``But then you can't be too optimistic.''
   At 2 p.m. HST Monday, the hurricane was 630 miles east-southeast
of Hawaii Island, southernmost in the chain, moving west at 20 mph,
Manning said. Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75 mph; a storm
is classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 mph. Wind
gusted up to 90 mph.
   At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to pass
south of Hawaii Island, the ``Big Island,'' on Tuesday night.
However, the center said a slight change in direction would bring
the hurricane closer to the state.
   A tropical storm watch was issued for the island at 5 p.m. HST,
which means winds up to 73 mph, large waves and heavy rains might
hit the island, the center said.
   An Air Force reconaissance plane from Keesler Air Force Base in
Biloxi, Miss., was scheduled to fly through the storm Tuesday to
collect data on its intensity and direction, said Clarence Lee, head
of the hurricane center.
   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, which
brushed the island of Oahu and roared over the top of Kauai with
winds up to 117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.
   Manning said it was too early to predict with certainty how
Dalilia would affect Hawaii's weather.
   ``A lot depends on how close Dalilia moves to the Islands,'' he
said. ``Some increase in showers and winds will likely result,
especially on the Big Island. There will also be some surf.''
   Manning said wave action associated with a fast-moving hurricane
like Dalilia tends to bunch up and arrive close to the passage of
the center. Surf on Hawaii Island's southern beaches was not
expected to increase until midday Tuesday, he said.
   Harry Kim, Hawaii County Civil Defense administrator, called a
briefing Monday with Hawaii Island agencies responsible for
monitoring surf. ``At this time, it seems like the worst we will
have is surf problems,'' Kim said.
