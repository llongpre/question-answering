<LEADPARA>  Before the first arrival of humans in the Hawaiian Islands about 1,600 years
ago, scientists have found, the long-isolated archipelago was ruled by an
assortment of at least 35 now-extinct bird species, many of them flightless.; 
  Smithsonian researchers, who discovered preserved remains of the birds,
announced this week that the birds lived in Hawaii before the Polynesians
arrived around A.D. 400. The scientists believe that the Polynesians, with
their dogs, pigs, farms and appetites, did in the birds.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Biologists long have known that many Hawaiian bird species became extinct
in relatively recent times, but they say they are astounded by the diversity
of avian life unearthed by Storrs Olson and Helen James of the Smithsonian,
the husband-and-wife team who have spent the last 15 years crawling in lava
tubes and sand dunes, digging up bird bones.;    "It tells us the Hawaii we
see, which is such a wonderful showcase of evolution, is today only a fraction
of what once was," said David Blockstein, an ornithologist and executive
director of the Committee for the National Institutes for the Environment.
"They have uncovered some fascinating stuff.";    The new report was published
as a scientific monograph describing 32 extinct Hawaiian bird species. Three
others had previously been reported, two of them by Olson. In all, Olson and
James suspect that when they finish examining all the bones they have found,
they may have identified more than 50 extinct birds.;    "Nobody had ever
really expected that this degree of extinction was taking place on the
islands," Olson said.;    Before the arrival of the Polynesians in Hawaii,
birds filled many of the ecological niches occupied on the mainland by mammals
and reptiles. There were dozens of honeycreepers, each with its own habitat.
There were hawks, owls and eagles, which preyed upon other birds. And there
were at least 20 species of flightless bird, from tiny rails to ibises to
goose-sized ducks that filled the same niche occupied by tortoises on the
Galapagos Islands today.;    The work of Olson and James reinforces the idea
that extinctions are not the work only of modern humans, but have been going
on for thousands of years. Aboriginal Europeans and Asians wiped out many
giant mammals on those continents. Indians in North and South America are
considered responsible for hastening the end of the giant ground sloths,
camels, horses and mastodons that once roamed the New World.;    Now the
Polynesians are being blamed for killing off at least 35 and possibly 50
species of birds in Hawaii. Olson and James say that while the Polynesians'
animals may have played a role, the Polynesians' hunger for farmland and
flightless birds probably did the most damage. Other researchers are
uncovering similar extinction events across the Pacific. It seems wherever
human beings migrated, the birds suffered.;    "It really makes us rethink our
view of indigenous people living in harmony with their environment,"
Blockstein said. "We have this romantic image of them . . . that doesn't quite
appear appropriate.";    Alan Holt, director of science and stewardship for
the Nature Conservancy of Hawaii, said the biggest threats to the surviving
Hawaiian birds may be introduced pests and predators.;    Between 10 and 25
new alien pests arrive each year. And island nature lovers live in terror that
the venomous brown tree snake will make its way to Hawaii. On Guam, the newly
arrived tree snake wiped out the island's birds.  </TEXT>
