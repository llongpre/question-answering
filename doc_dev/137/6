   A rescue helicopter searching a remote valley
early today spotted the wreckage of a sightseeing plane that
vanished Sunday with 11 people aboard, authorities said. There were
no signs of survivors.
   Pieces of the twin-engine Beechcraft were strewn over the face of
a cliff on Hawaii Island's northeast coast, three miles from where
aircraft had pinpointed an emergency radio signal on Monday,
authorities said.
   Marines lowered themselves by ropes in an attempt to reach the
crash site, said Coast Guard spokesman David Santos.
   ``Debris is spread out over a 200- to 300-meter area,'' said
Marine spokesman Maj. Kerry Gershaneck. ``There's nothing that our
people see that would identify the wreckage as an aircraft. There is
no sign of survivors.''
   The Scenic Air Tours plane disappeared without indication of
trouble Sunday during what was supposed to be an hour-long flight
from Hawaii Island to Maui Island. The plane had left under partly
sunny skies, carrying a pilot and 10 tourists.
   Heavy rain and strong winds on Monday prevented helicopters from
searching the valley. A Coast Guard helicopter had picked up the
emergency signal from the Waimanu Valley region on the northeast
side of Hawaii Island.
   The valley is about four miles long with several major side
valleys and has a 320-foot-high waterfall. It cuts deep into the
5,480-foot Kohala Mountain and is thick with vegetation.
   The plane's last reported position was 10 miles north of Hilo and
flying at 2,000 feet, according to Federal Aviation Administration
spokesman George Harvey. The plane passed out of radar contact at
that point and would not have re-emerged on radar until it passed
the island's northern tip.
   The names of those aboard, eight Americans and two Australians,
will not be released until all their families have been notified,
said David Tom, the tour company's operations manager.
   The plane's 28-year-old pilot had about 4,000 hours flying
experience and had flown the around-the-island tour about 50 times,
according to Scenic Air Tours chief pilot, Doug Rogers.
   In 1987, a twin-engine Panorama Air Tours plane with eight people
aboard disappeared without a trace on a flight from Honolulu to
Molokai Island.
