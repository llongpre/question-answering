   Bonneville Pacific Corp. said it entered agreements to develop three hydroelectric-power projects in Hawaii, with a total value of about $39.3 million. 
Terms weren't disclosed. 

   The projects are expected to be completed by 1988. 
Bonneville, Salt Lake City, a developer and operator of alternative-energy plants, said it agreed with B2C Energy Group, a closely held energy concern in Hawaii, to develop an $11.4 million facility on the island of Maui, and a $17.9 million plant on the island of Hawaii. 
Under the agreement, Bonneville acquires controlling interest in B2C Energy, and a 50% equity in the projects. 

   Bonneville also said it will purchase the stock of Island Power Co., another closely held energy concern in Hawaii, which owns the rights to develop a $10 million hydroelectric plant on the island of Kauai. 

   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Bonneville was unchanged at $11.50 a share.
