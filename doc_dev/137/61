ISLAND'S ATTEMPTS TO AVOID SPRAWL ARE SUCCEEDING  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Now, nearly 200 years later, another invasion has swept across Hawaii --
this one by hotel and condominium developers. But on this isle of soaring
volcanic peaks, beaches the color of brown sugar and river valleys sheltering
some of Hawaii's best-preserved rain forests, the invasion meets singular
resistance.;    While high-rises, highways and sprawling resorts have been
built in Hawaii at a breakneck pace -- from 1983 to 1990, construction
increased almost 28 percent annually, the Bank of Hawaii says -- developers on
Kauai have faced pickets, lawsuits and a popular, community
activist-turned-mayor of the island, Joanne Yukimura.;     THESE DAYS,
Yukimura and the business community are squared off over a plan to extend the
runway at the island's airport to accommodate jumbo-jet flights. Yukimura is
against the $15 million-to-$30 million proposal. "Access affects what a place
comes to look like," she said. "A small town that gets a freeway exit
disappears in the megalopolis.";    As a result of nearly two decades of
dueling between islanders and developers, Kauai remains the least developed of
the four largest Hawaiian Islands and has the most limited development plans.;
   Nearly half the 335,000-acre island is mountainous forest, owned by the
state, and much of it is accessible only by hiking trails. The north shore,
with its dramatic Na Pali cliffs also lacks roads.;    In the heart of the
island is the great, untouched Alakai Swamp, a bizarre bog where violets grow
on 8-foot bushes while some trees stand only 2 feet tall.;    The sky is
pierced by misty, green Mount Waialeale, one of the wettest places in the
world, with an average of 451 inches of rain annually, and the source of many
of Kauai's waterfalls.;    The island is so beautiful that whenever Hollywood
needs a tropical backdrop -- be it for "South Pacific," "Raiders of the Lost
Ark" or the remake of "King Kong" -- it comes to Kauai.;    Movie moguls are
more warmly received than developers. "The island definitely has a reputation
as the most anti-development in Hawaii," said Douglas Boynton, a founder of
the Kauai Sierra Club. "Of course, that doesn't prevent the developers from
trying.";    But they inevitably run into Yukimura.;    "We are trying to
create a tourism that is compatible with the people who live here. We don't
want people who are looking for Waikiki, because we aren't Waikiki," Yukimura
said, referring to the strip of massive high-rise hotels along Waikiki Beach
in Honolulu.;    In 1974, Yukimura came home from the mainland, where she had
earned degrees at Stanford University and the University of Washington Law
School, to find her island in turmoil.;    The Ohana O Maha' Ulepu, or
Extended Family of Maha' Ulepu, a seaside community, was battling a
condominium developer. Hotels were trying to change zoning to allow
high-rises.;    Yukimura immediately jumped into the fray, helping to form
SHOK -- Stop High-rises on Kauai -- which successfully defended the zoning
ordinance that forbids buildings "taller than the tallest coconut tree" --
four stories.;    In 1976, at the age of 26, Yukimura ran for County Council
and won. In the early 1980s, she twice failed to win the mayor's job, then
succeeded in 1988 and again in 1990.;    The fights have been ongoing. There
was a bitter confrontation over a proposal for a 1,500-room resort. After a
sit-in and an island-wide referendum, a Hilton Hotel was built, but with only
500 rooms.;    More recently, there was the crusade to save the rickety
Hanalei Bridge, the gateway to the island's spectacular north shore. The
single-lane, steel-truss bridge, which was built in 1912, cannot take the
weight of big tour buses. Yukimura prefers it that way. The old bridge, she
said, "sets a tone and protects our north shore." When the state and business
interests wanted to replace it with a modern two-lane concrete span, islanders
blocked the proposal.;    Yukimura -- who grew up on the island in the 1950s,
when there were only three small hotels, one traffic light and no television
-- talks in almost mystical terms about Kauai.;    "It is said that this is a
very nurturing environment," she said. "It is a place that people find
themselves, a place to come alive again. It has changed dramatically, but
there is still much of the essence of the island.";    Despite the battles and
the victories, resort development has made a significant beachhead on Kauai.; 
  Today, there are dozens of resorts with a total of more than 7,000 rooms. In
the last year, a Hyatt Hotel and a Sheraton Hotel opened. On any given day,
Kauai's population of 51,000 is bolstered by about 16,000 tourists.;    BUT
THE BUSINESS community now finds itself in an "uneasy truce" with the mayor
for a variety of reasons.;    First, Yukimura's positions have won tremendous
support. On an island where voter turnout averages about 80 percent, she
garners nearly 60 percent of the vote. Second, with high occupancy rates in
the new hotels and a cooling of Japanese investment, the push to build has
dwindled. In this atmosphere, Yukimura's policy of opposing new development
and supporting existing development is playing well.;    Finally, Parker said,
the business community "recognizes that (Kauai's) environment is the key
attraction. To mess with that too much is to essentially mess with its
economy.";    But Yukimura sees an irony in Kauai's efforts. "The more
beautiful we keep our island," she said, "the greater the development
pressures become."  </TEXT>
