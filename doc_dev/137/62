   Hawaii Island residents were urged to stock up on
batteries, canned goods and other emergency supplies as Hurricane
Dalilia swirled toward the state.
   Late Monday, the hurricane was moving west at 20 mph several
hundred miles east-southeast of Hawaii Island, according to the
National Weather Service. Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75
mph, with gusts up to 90 mph.
   At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to pass
about 150 miles south of Hawaii Island tonight. However, the weather
service said a slight change in direction would bring the hurricane
closer to the state.
   ``Storms have a mind of their own,'' said lead forecaster Hans
Rosendal. ``We've put out a tropical storm watch in case Dalilia
strays from the path.''
   The weather watch issued Monday afternoon warned residents that
73 mph winds, large waves and heavy rain could hit the island, he
said. It was issued only for the island of Hawaii.
   An Air Force reconaissance plane from Keesler Air Force Base in
Biloxi, Miss., was scheduled to fly through the storm Tuesday to
collect data on its intensity and direction, according to the
Central Pacific Hurricane Center here.
   Dal said it was too early to predict with certainty how Dalilia
would affect Hawaii's weather.
   ``It depends how close it comes,'' he said. ``There would
probably at least be some heavy rain and high surf on the Big
Island. It's too early to say about Oahu and the rest of the state.''
