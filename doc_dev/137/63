   The mid-flight disintegration of part of a
Boeing 737 over Hawaii is likely to lead to as many as 50 orders to
strengthen older passenger jets in the next year, a Boeing Co.
executive says.
   In the meantime, Ben Cosgrove, vice president for engineering at
Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said the world's largest commercial jet
manufacturer is making sure the Federal Aviation Administration is
told of problems in older planes.
   At a news briefing on aging aircraft, Cosgrove said that when
Boeing officials hear about an aircraft problem from an airline,
they tell the carrier to notify the FAA within 24 hours, ``and we
make sure that it does.''
   The Hawaii accident last April stunned the commercial aircraft
industry and raised questions about older aircraft and how long they
can safely fly. The Aloha Airlines Boeing 737 was flying over Hawaii
when an 18-foot section ripped from the top of the jetliner.
   A flight attendant was swept to her death and 64 of the 93 other
people aboard were hurt before the crew managed to land the plane on
Maui. The 19-year-old plane, with nearly 90,000 flights, was the
second most-heavily used plane in the worldwide 737 fleet.
   Last June, the FAA sponsored a three-day conference in
Washington, D.C., on older planes. One result was the creation of
task forces of FAA, manufacturer and airline representatives to
examine ways to ensure older planes' safety.
   Since the Aloha accident, the FAA has changed some of its
thinking about older aircraft, sometimes requiring operators to make
specific modifications rather than just checking for a given problem
and correcting it if trouble is found.
   Last fall, the FAA required operators of many older 737s to
replace thousands of rivets in some places where a 737's skin is
joined after the adhesive used on those lap joints was found prone
to delamination. In December, a similar order was issued for older
Boeing 727 tri-jets.
   Cosgrove, who serves on a working group that oversees task forces
dealing with Boeing planes, said it has reviewed service bulletins
Boeing has issued over the years as advisories for 727, 737 and 747
jumbo jets operators and has nearly completed recomending which ones
airlines now should be required to perform.
   The FAA will then determine which modifications should be made
mandatory through ``airworthiness directives,'' or orders to air
carriers, he said.
   ``You're going to see ads coming out pretty quick on some
recommendations,'' he said, adding later that as many as ``50, 51''
directives could be issued in the next 12 months.
   In addition to the Boeing planes, other work groups are examining
aircraft made by McDonnell-Douglas, Lockheed, Airbus Industrie,
Convair, Fokker and British Aircraft.
   Boeing spokesman Jack Gamble said the number of directives
involving older Boeing airframes could be as few as 10 or 12, and
that the FAA may group some smaller modifications into single
directives to make the process simpler.
   Boeing officials and many others in the industry say commercial
planes can be flown indefinitely, as long as they are properly
maintained. What determines an airplane's life, they say, is the
increasing cost of maintenance, the aircraft's efficiency, and
technological changes.
   The National Transporation Safety Board report on causes of the
Aloha accident is expected out shortly, and Cosgrove said he would
wait until it is released before commenting on why that massive
structural failure occurred.
