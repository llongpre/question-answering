   A Yap islander found drifting in a life raft
told authorities he abandoned his tuna boat after fumes from
rotting fish apparently killed two other men aboard the vessel,
according to the Coast Guard.
   Coast Guard and Navy ships were sent to tow the vessel to port,
but their crews were warned to stay upwind to avoid the fumes.
   Lawrence Moon, who was safely aboard the Coast Guard cutter Cape
Corwin on Wednesday, told authorities he abandoned the 85-foot,
Seattle-based trawler Margaret G after fumes overcame two crewmates
``in a matter of seconds,'' said Coast Guard spokesman Keith
Spangler.
   Moon told officials after his rescue Tuesday that the trawler's
refrigeration system failed during a trip to Honolulu that began
April 22 at American Samoa, a U.S. territory about 2,300 miles
south of Hawaii, Spangler said. Yap, part of the Federated States
of Micronesia, is about 540 miles southwest of Guam.
   Moon said that on Sunday, the other crewmember went down into a
hold and did not return, and when the captain went to investigate,
he was also overcome, leaving Moon alone, according to Spangler.
   Moon told authorities he headed the vessel toward Honolulu but
had problems with a steering linkage and later a generator
malfunction, Spangler said.
   On Monday, Moon said, he woke to find himself succumbing to the
fumes, so he abandoned the vessel after closing all the hatches,
Spangler said.
   Spangler said the crewmen may have been overcome by hydrogen
sulfide, which is produced by rotting organic material.
   ``It is very toxic and it takes the oxygen out of the air,''
Spangler said. ``If it's rotting fish, this could happen.''
   The Japanese ship Sun Harvest rescued Moon Tuesday evening 300
miles south of Honolulu. Spangler said Moon was later transferred
to the Coast Guard cutter and was reported in ``good condition and
good spirits.''
   Coast Guard and Navy ships were at the scene Wednesday but were
instructed to remain 2,000 yards upwind from the Margaret G,
Spangler said. Crewmembers were told to rig the vessel for towing
but not to go below deck, he added.
   ``The fumes are really bad,'' he said. ``The vessel will be
towed to Honolulu, but a decision has not been made what to do
after that.''
   Spangler said the investigation was complicated by the fact that
hydrogen sulfide is highly combustible.
   Moon's raft was spotted Tuesday morning by the crew of a Coast
Guard plane following an emergency distress beacon signal that was
picked up by commercial aircraft and the worldwide Search and
Rescue Satellite Assisted Tracking computer system, said spokesman
Dave Goff.
   Moon was about two miles from the Margaret G, which when viewed
from the air showed no evidence of damage and no sign of life,
Spangler said.
   A Coast Guard life raft containing a radio and food and water
was dropped, and Moon swam to it from his raft to await pickup by
the Japanese ship, Goff said.
