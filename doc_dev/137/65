Travelers were enraged this week after learning of a new (old, actually) state 
tax law pertaining to goods bought in foreign countries. Although on the books 
since 1935, the law allowing billing became enforceable following the 
automation of U.S. Customs files. And while the tax amounts to peanuts (6.5%), 
it is proving irksome. 
</P>

Californians complain that it comes as a surprise addition to duty (10%) 
already imposed by the federal government. Thus far only a handful of 
Californians have been billed. Still, the numbers promise to increase as 
residents make their 1990 Customs declarations. Customs requires the 
declaration when merchandise exceeds $400 ($800 in the case of Guam, American 
Samoa and the U.S. Virgin Islands). One state official suggested that travelers 
who failed to declare their 1989 purchases come forth voluntarily and pay up. 
To which a returning resident declared, "You must think we're crazy!"

French/American Affair: France is launching a new campaign to lure Americans to 
the provinces. Direct flights from the United States to 10 hubs besides Paris: 
Nice, Lyon, Lille, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse, 
Montpellier, Marseille. Inside France, Air Inter (the nation's domestic 
airline) has stepped up service on 50 routes. At the same time, the 300-m.p.h. 
TGV Atlantique (world's fastest train) has begun service from Paris to Rennes, 
Nantes and beyond to "land's end" in the Finistere.
