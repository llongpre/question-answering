<HEAD>Man Found on Raft Says Fumes From Rotting Fish Killed Two Crew Mates</HEAD>

   The bodies of two crewmen were found aboard a
disabled tuna boat, and a crew member who abandoned the vessel told
the Coast Guard his companions were overcome by fumes of rotting
fish.
   Lawrence Moon, a Yap islander found drifting in a life raft
Tuesday, told officials he abandoned the tuna boat Margaret G after
the fumes felled the two other men ``in a matter of seconds,'' said
Coast Guard spokesman Keith Spangler.
   Spangler said the men may have been overcome by hydrogen
sulfide, which is produced by rotting organic material.
   The Coast Guard began towing the 85-foot, Seattle-based vessel
to Hawaii on Wednesday, said another Coast Guard spokesman, David
Goff. The 300-mile trip could take three to four days because the
tuna boat has rudder problems, he said.
   The Coast Guard investigation was complicated by the fact that
hydrogen sulfide is highly combustible, Spangler said.
   Moon, who said he joined the Margaret G before it left American
Samoa on April 23, told authorities the boat's refrigeration system
was not operating when it left the U.S. territory about 2,300 miles
south of Hawaii. The boat was carrying 13 to 15 tons of tuna it had
been unable to sell in port, Goff said.
   Moon said the three crew members dumped five to six tons of
rotten fish into the Pacific Ocean between April 25 and 27, but had
to stop when the heat and smell became too intense.
   The skipper was overcome by fumes Sunday when he went into the
fish well and the other crewman was also overcome when he went to
help the skipper, Moon said.
   Fearing the fumes endangered his life, Moon boarded a life raft
Monday after the ship's electric generator failed. His raft was
spotted Tuesday by a Coast Guard plane following an emergency
distress beacon signal.
   Yap, part of the Federated States of Micronesia, is about 540
miles southwest of Guam.
