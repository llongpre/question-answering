Sailing Singles: Ships with the largest number of single staterooms, according 
to Consumer Reports, include the Canberra (148), QE2 (98), Crown Del Mar (88), 
Dawn Princess and Fair Princess (59), Sagafjord (54), Rotterdam (42), Royal 
Viking Sea and Royal Viking Sky (both 39) and Vistafjord (36). Loners will 
still pay more than per-person rates sharing a double cabin, but not as much as 
they'd pay for occupying a double stateroom alone.

Half-price Sail: Princess Cruises is offering Southern Californians a special 
"Second Person at 50% Off" rate for a transcanal cruise this fall aboard the 
Island Princess. The 11-day cruise sails from San Juan, Puerto Rico, to 
Acapulco, departing Oct. 16. During the voyage, the ship will visit St. Thomas, 
St. Maarten, Martinique and Curacao, and transit the Panama Canal. Fares begin 
at $2,140 per person, double occupancy; the 50% second-person discount is based 
on one-half of the tariff for the category. Round-trip air transportation 
connected with the ship is included from several Southern California gateway 
cities, including Los Angeles and San Diego. See your travel agent or call 
(800) 421-0522.

Cruise to Eclipse: It's not too early to start planning a Hawaiian cruise to 
view the solar eclipse next year. American Hawaii's Independence and 
Constitution sail July 6, 1991, for seven-day voyages from Honolulu. The 
cruises will include the usual ports of Kauai, Kona, Hilo and Maui, but will 
reroute on July 11 off the Big Island. The total eclipse is due at 7:28 a.m. 
and will last more than four minutes, but passengers will be able to witness 
unusual lighting in the sky for up to two hours. Cruisers are invited to bring 
the kids, who can cruise free with certain types of accommodations. For 
details, see your travel agent or call (800) 765-7000.

Cruise Savings: South Florida Cruises, based in Ft. Lauderdale, offers savings 
from as little as $300 to $1,500 per cabin, based on double occupancy and 
availability. The company allocates millions of dollars annually to buy group 
space in advance on 23 different cruise lines. "This allows us to offer our 
customers the group rate, whether they want one or 101 or more cabins," says 
firm president Jim Bone. "The more cabins we buy, the easier it becomes to pass 
the savings on to our customers." Founded in 1985, the national company, with 
more than 30,000 past passengers, is a member of the Association of Retail 
Travel Agencies, Cruise Lines International Assn. and the National Assn. of 
Cruise Only Agencies. Call (800) 327-7447.

Weather or No: To those potential cruisers concerned about hurricanes, the 
season officially begins in June and ends in November. Historically, most 
storms occur in August, September and October. But while there is some risk 
that a hurricane may occur on the week you've chosen to cruise, modern weather 
tracking systems virtually eliminate the danger of being caught in one.
