<LEADPARA>  STATE authorities in Alaska, responding to angry complaints from residents of
the state's most scenic coastal areas, have found that cruise ships are
pumping dense amounts of smoke and obscuring views. They have given the cruise
line operators until the end of 1992 to sharply reduce the smoke emissions.;  
The smoke problem is most severe in Juneau, Sitka, Skagway and Glacier Bay. In
those areas, mountains close to the coast sometimes cause temperature
inversions in the atmosphere, in which smoke and other pollution is trapped
beneath a layer of cold air, Stone said. The inversions are most common in the
summer, when the cruise ship visits are most frequent.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     An Alaska law, enacted last year, prohibits ships from emitting smoke that
blocks or obscures the view of more than 20 percent of background scenery. In
tests last summer, state inspectors monitored 17 cruise ships and found that
12 of them violated the smoke emission standard.;   Those ships whose
compliance with state standards was rated poor or marginal were the Dawn
Princess, Fair Princess, Island Princess, Sky Princess and Star Princess, all
of Princess Cruises line; the Noordam, Rotterdam and Westerdam, all of the
Holland America Line; the Regent Star of Regency Cruises; Cunard Line's Sea
Goddess; Seven Seas Cruise Line's Song of Flower, and World Explorer Cruises'
Universe.; Big business; (box) Travel and tourism continue to be a major
factor in the state's economy, according to a report issued last week by the
Office of Tourism in the California Department of Commerce. The industry
generated almost $53 billion in 1990, according to the report.;  
"California's travel industry is big business," said Commerce Director Julie
Meier Wright. "With an overall 8.9 percent increase over the previous level of
$48 billion, California continues to be the number one travel destination in
the U.S.";   Travel-related employment grew from 724,000 jobs in 1989 to
750,000 last year. Payroll gains mirrored job growth, showing an 8.6 percent
gain from $10 billion to $10.9 billion.; The top spots; (box) A new American
Express survey is out showing California to be the second most popular
domestic travel destination. The No. 1 spot was that other sunshine state,
Florida.;   Next in line were Hawaii, Colorado and Nevada. Top international
picks were the Caribbean islands, Mexico, England, Caribbean cruises and
Europe in general with top choices France, England and Italy. But, the study
showed that 76 percent of American Express agents' clients were willing to
change destinations to save money.;   In another survey, this one conducted by
the American Society of Travel Agents, the top winter destinations were
Florida, followed by Mexico, Hawaii and cruises.;   While travelers are
looking for bargains, the travel agents group noted that few planned to delay
their trips until after Jan. 7, when lower air fares take effect. Travel
agents, Davidoff said, indicated travelers "feel other deals are always right
around the corner."; Beware flimflam; (box) The American Society of Travel
Agents has complained to the Federal Trade Commission and state investigators
about bogus travel-agent identity cards. The cards, sold through mail-order
ads and telemarketing for up to $500 apiece, purport to give the bearer entree
to travel discounts that travel agents commonly receive. The cards look like
driver's licenses, with photo and "travel agent" displayed.; Colorado skiing;
(box) Denver is trying to make it easy on visitors who want to ski for a day
or two while visiting the city. The visitors bureau is promoting a toll-free
number through which transportation from hotels to 10 resorts, ski equipment
rentals, lift tickets and even ski jackets can be arranged. The number is
(800) 283-2754. You can also use that number to order a brochure showing the
10 resorts.; South Africa flights; (box) With the lifting of U.S. sanctions
against South Africa, South African Airways has resumed service between New
York and Johannesburg, with a stop en route at Ilha do Sal in the Cape Verde
Islands off West Africa. SAA's reservation number is (212) 826-0995.; Kosher
Club news; (box) South America and Israel have been added to the Kosher Club's
1992 "Complete Guide to Kosher Dining and Travel," a 256-page book that
includes nearly 1,200 restaurants, delis, bakeries and other kosher food
establishments in the Western Hemisphere and, now, Israel.;   The guide --
which originally covered only establishments in the United States -- is a
Kosher Club membership benefit, along with a bimonthly newsletter and
discounts at hundreds of restaurants. An annual membership costs $49.95.
