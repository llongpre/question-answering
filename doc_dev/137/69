   Tropical Storm Dalilia skirted the Hawaiian
Islands on Thursday, causing some road flooding, high surf and a
power outage but no major property damage or injuries.
   Dalilia passed about 60 miles south of Hawaii Island,
southernmost in the chain, Wednesday night after weakening from a
hurricane to a tropical storm. A flash flood watch was in effect
for all islands as the weakening storm moved northwest on a course
parallel to the state.
   At 8 a.m. HST Thursday, the storm was about 120 miles south of
Honolulu, moving northwest at 17 mph. Its maximum sustained wind
speed was 58 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when that speed
reaches 74 mph.
   Dalilia was forecast to pass 60 miles south of Honolulu, on the
island of Oahu, causing heavy rain, high surf and stiff wind, but
forecasters said the progressive weakening of the storm made it
less of a threat than it was to Hawaii Island.
   Nevertheless, the Oahu Civil Defense Agency advised Honolulu
residents to purchase emergency supplies such as flashlights,
batteries and canned food in case the storm takes a sudden turn
north, spokesman Paul Takamiya said.
   ``Because it seems to staying on a course that will bring it
parallel to the islands, we think the main problem might be from
the rain, hopefully the winds won't be too extreme, but we might
get some flooding'' said Hans Rosendal, the weather service's lead
forecaster.
   ``We got away pretty clean in regard to rain, wind and surf,''
said Harry Kim, Hawaii Island Civil Defense administrator.
   Up to 8 inches of water closed the only highway along Hawaii
Island's south coast, but the road was reopened early Thursday, Kim
said.
   More than 7 inches of rain fell during a 24-hour period in areas
of Hawaii Island's south coast, the weather service said.
   Winds of 35 to 40 mph knocked out a transformer near Pahala,
blacking out the community of 3,000. Kim said electricity there
would remain out until late Thursday.
