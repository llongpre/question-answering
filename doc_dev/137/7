   Rescuers worked to recover the last four
bodies Wednesday from a remote Hawaii Island valley where a tour
airplane crashed, killing 11 people.
   The Scenic Air Tours Hawaii plane slammed into an 1,800-foot high
wall Sunday afternoon at the back of Waipio Valley. There were no
survivors.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft was on a flight from Hilo Airport on
Hawaii Island to Kahului on the island of Maui.
   A three-member National Transportation Safety Board team was to
travel to Hawaii Island to meet with officials in charge of recovery
effort, said Bruce Butts, operations officer for the Hawaii County
Civil Defense Agency.
   Barry Trotter, leader of the NTSB team, said that in addition to
examining the crash site the team would investigate Scenic Air
Tours' crew training procedures and how the company selects its
pilots.
   The plane's pilot, Pascal Meric, 28, of Honolulu, had about 4,000
hours flying experience, said Doug Rogers, chief pilot for Scenic
Air Tours. The crash was the first in the company's nine-year
history.
   Rescue workers descended on ropes from a helicopter to recover
seven bodies Tuesday. Those remains were found upslope from the main
portion of wreckage.
   ``The remains of the others, from what I understand, are in and
around the main wreckage itself, and that wreckage is hanging
precariously on the side of a steep valley wall,'' Butts said.
   Butts said Civil Defense officials, firefighters and national
park rangers were trying to minimize the risk to rescue workers
working to recover the remaining bodies.
   The twin-engine Beechcraft struck a sheer valley wall, and its
wreckage cut a 300-foot-long, fire-scarred swath as it slid downhill
through thick vegetation.
   Hawaii County Police Chief Victor Vierra, who visited the crash
site Tuesday, said the impact left a burn mark ``that was the
perfect outline of the aircraft.''
   The seven bodies were taken to Hilo Hospital, where work was to
begin on identification, Butts said.
   Scenic Air Tours on Wednesday released the name of a ninth
passenger: Delphine Clemenz of Torrance, Calif.
   Eight other passengers were identified as Peter Spillane and Ann
Herbert, both of Sydney, Australia; Jack Merle and Shirley Merle of
Russellville, Ark.; Mary Statler of Blue Mound, Ill.; Sylvie Martel
and Nicole Beland of Canada; and Robert Wren, 61, an English
professor at the University of Houston.
   The name of a New York City woman was being withheld pending
notification of relatives, according to company owner Doris Tom.
