   The Coast Guard found a yacht that had been
crippled in rough seas southwest of Guam and sent a patrol boat
Monday to tow the boat and its crew to safety, officials said.
   A C-130 search and rescue plane from Hawaii spotted the Royal
Taipan about 120 miles east-northeast of Yap, an island of the
Federated State of Micronesia, said Lt. Kent Youel, a Coast Guard
spokesman in Honolulu.
   Earlier reports had said the 146-foot vessel was lost about 225
miles south-southwest of Guam, but its location Monday was about
500 miles southwest of Guam.
   A 95-foot patrol boat was sent out from Yap to take the boat in
tow, Youel said. Everyone aboard was reported safe, he said.
   The Royal Taipan, a converted Navy minesweeper owned by
Honolulu-based Windjammer Cruises, first radioed for help Saturday
when it ran into the fringes of Tropical Storm Abe.
   Communication was lost Sunday night just after the crew reported
that it was taking on water in 25-foot seas and about 50 mph winds,
and that water had reached the floorboards, said Youel.
   The crew, including 14 Filipinos and two Americans, was sailing
the Royal Taipan from the Philippines to Saipan, where the yacht
was to have been refurbished for cruises, Youel said. The
nationality of the 17th crewmember wasn't known.
