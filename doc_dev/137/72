   Searchers today found the bodies of two
dogs that had been on a twin-engine plane missing off Rhode Island
but saw no sign of wreckage or the eight people aboard, authorities
said.
   Authorities held out hope of finding survivors from the New
England Airlines plane that vanished Tuesday night on a 17-mile
flight from Block Island State Airport to Westerly.
   Searchers on land and in boats reported finding various debris,
including a radio headset, a shoe, a life jacket, a fire
extinguisher and a box of freight believed to have been aboard the
plane.
   ``There's always a chance. That's why we're still looking,''
said Coast Guard Petty Officer David Brear.
   The dogs were found in Block Island Sound, about two miles
northwest of the island, where two Coast Guard cutters and a dozen
smaller boats were searching in water about 100 feet deep and as
cold as 45 degrees overnight.
   The dogs belonged to passenger Judy Johnson, a New Jersey woman
who had a summer home on the island, said a friend, Barbara
Heineman, who came to the Westerly airport to await further word.
   The flight left at 6:20 p.m. and should have taken no more than
15 minutes, authorities said. The British Norman Islander aircraft
had about two hours of fuel, airline controller Dean Martin said.
   There was no radio contact with pilot John Beck Jr. after
takeoff, Martin said. The airports involved do not have control
towers, and Beck, a former Naval aviator with about 10 years of
experience on the Block Island route, would have navigated
visually, the airline said.
   ``We're all just worried sick,'' said Helen Scraug, a bartender
on Block Island. ``We're praying for everybody on that plane.''
   Peter Wood, publisher of the Block Island Times newspaper, said
his wife, Shirley, a real estate agent, was aboard on her way to a
real estate class on the mainland.
   Others aboard included two construction workers and a man who
worked at a restaurant on the island, New Shoreham police Sgt.
William McCombe said.
