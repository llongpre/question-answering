   Japanese investment in Hawaii real estate in the
first six months of the year was down about 20 percent from the same
period last year, according to a study by a Honolulu newspaper.
   The Honolulu Advertiser reported Wednesday that Japanese
investors bought or announced purchases of at least $809 million
worth of Hawaii real estate during the first six months of 1989.
That was down from more than $1 billion in property bought by
Japanese investors in the same period last year.
   Real estate experts and local economists have said foreign
investment in the state was bound to decline, considering the huge
amount of money that has already been poured in here, and because
the Japanese are being lured by perhaps more lucrative investments
elsewhere.
   Since 1986, Japanese investors spent more than $4.4 billion on
Hawaii real estate, buying mostly luxury hotels, golf courses,
office buildings, shopping centers and residential homes.
   The 1989 six-month figures showed most investment in that period
went toward buying hotels and resorts, the Advertiser said.
   The sales of two Maui resorts accounted for nearly half the total
investment in that period. The Wailea resort was sold for nearly
$200 million, while the newly-opened Embassy Suites resorts at
Kaanapali fetched $151.2 million.
   However, the Advertiser study indicated that more Japanese
investors were acquiring raw land for development, rather than
buying existing assets.
   Thousands of acres of land have been purchased on the islands of
Hawaii, Maui and Molokai, it said.
