With the two Germanys no longer divided, a "first-ever" pass for travel through 
East Germany can be obtained as an add-on when buying either a GermanRail pass 
or a Eurailpass. Fares are $79 for four days, $119 for eight days (or for 
travelers possessing Eurail Youth Passes, the cost is $59 for four days, $79 
for eight days). Both passes are good for unlimited travel in East Germany. To 
order rail passes, call toll-free (800) 223-6036. Additional information is 
available from GermanRail's Los Angeles representative at (213) 479-2772. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, travelers are cautioned to obtain hotel reservations wherever they 
go in East Germany. What with a shortage of first-class hotels, you could wind 
up without a room. Berlin, in particular, is crowded. One tourism official told 
us: "I'd wait until next year when East Germany will be better prepared for 
heavier tourism."

West Germany by Coach: For travelers planning a visit to West Germany, a new 
coaching tour takes in King Ludwig II country. Horse-drawn coaches leave from a 
village south of Munich on Thursdays/Sundays through October. Tours include 
transfers from Munich, meals, accommodations, an English-speaking guide. Groups 
visit two of King Ludwig's castles as well as several Bavarian villages. For 
details/prices, contact the German National Tourist Office locally or write to 
Coaching in Bavaria, R. Nermitz, Kerschlach 2, 8121 Pahl, Federal Republic of 
Germany.

Leaf Peepers: Soon the highways, byways and back roads of New England will be 
crowded with travelers taking in the fall colors. To assist motorists, Vermont 
has published an eight-page guide describing 13 foliage tours. Provides driving 
instructions, mileage, etc. Covers all areas of the state. In addition, there's 
a calendar of events for September/October (craft fairs, foliage festivals, 
concerts, hayrides, art exhibits, ice cream socials, quilting bees, antique 
fairs). A total of 242 attractions.

St., Montpelier, Vt. 05602.

Meanwhile, visitors are reminded that Vermont innkeepers frequently require a 
two-night minimum booking during the foliage season. A favorite of ours is The 
Inn at Wethersfield, where innkeeper Ron Thornburn plays the piano for guests 
while his wife Mary supervises the kitchen (her culinary talents are famous 
throughout New England). This old farmhouse exudes all the warmth that leaf 
peepers dream about. It's homey, informal. Candles glow of an evening while 
Thornburn performs at the piano.

The 18th-Century, two-story inn sits back from a country lane at the base of 
Hawks Mountain between Springfield and Woodstock in southern Vermont. Guests 
have included Paul Newman and his family and novelist J. D. Salinger. The rate 
per couple is $160, including a four-course breakfast, high tea each afternoon 
and a five-course dinner. At Christmastime, the inn takes on a special glow 
when guests bundle into a horse-drawn sleigh and ride off into the woods in 
search of a tree. This is a special place -- no matter what the season.

Italian Inn: This note from Burt and Sally Clapper of Encino: "We took your 
advice and spent the last week of June at Tramonto D'Oro in Priano, Italy. We 
are genuinely well traveled and money is not a major concern. This was an 
excellent choice. The Esposito family, who are the owners of this little inn, 
were most kind and helpful. They spoke little English, but every effort was 
made toward our comfort. The food was excellent and varied and very fairly 
priced. The rooms are a bit small, but lovely balconies face the sea. The room 
price was $80 and certainly worth it. I absolutely recommend Tramonto D'Oro, 
Priano, Amalfi, Italy. It would be difficult to do better for the money." 
</P>
<P>
This little inn is south of Naples on the Amalfi Drive. Only a few miles beyond 
Positano, which was the late John Steinbeck's favorite Italian village.

Air Fares: There are more airline fares than new car models. It gets confusing. 
And costly. Here's our advice: Book your flight as far in advance as possible. 
For the lowest domestic fares, reserve 14/21 days in advance. I booked a coach 
flight to Hawaii a couple of years ago. The fare was quoted in excess of $800. 
I asked about an advance-purchase fare. The answer: $425. Same seat, same 
plane. And a savings of $400. Suggestion: Inquire about midweek fares. Busiest 
days are Monday/Friday. Often you'll get a better break on Tuesdays/Wednesdays. 
Additional savings are available by taking a one-stop (rather than nonstop) 
flight. Ask your travel agent to explain the other options.

operates a B&amp;B (in Northampton) and maps out trips for guests doing trips

"There is lots to do locally as well -- touring medieval castles and stately 
homes, including George Washington's ancestral home and Princess Diana's family 
estate. We (she and her British husband, Peter) can offer a great visiting 
experience to travelers from the U.S." The Voss home is in a 16th-Century 
village complete with pub and a cricket green. Rates at the B&amp;B are $25 per
