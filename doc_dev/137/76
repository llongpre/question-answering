   Spattered by blood and buffeted by debris
after their plane's roof blew off high over the Pacific, the
frightened passengers aboard Aloha Airlines Flight 243 helped one
another into life jackets and waited calmly.
   A stewardess was blown out of the Boeing 737, and 60 of the 89
passengers and remaining crew of four were injured before the plane
made a safe emergency landing here Thursday.
   ``I heard a loud explosion and I saw my bag from under the seat
in front of me fly right out of the aircraft,'' said David Kupihea,
who was in the first-class section at the front of the plane.
   A piece of conduit ripped loose from the plane and punctured
Kupihea's arm.
   ``I kept my head down; I pulled out my life vest; I used it as a
cushion. You can see the wind blowing in your face,'' he said.
   Kupihea said he noticed that the passenger next to him, John
Lopez, was bleeding so he covered him with a seat cover.
   ``When I looked out of the aircraft and saw the island of Maui,
I told him, `Hang on, John, hang on, we're going to Maui.''
   Lopez, 40, of Hilo, needed seven stitches to close a cut on his
head.
   The passengers were frightened but calm, some of them reported
after the severely disabled plane made a safe emergency landing
here, about 15 minutes after the plane was ripped apart during a
flight from Hilo, on Hawaii Island, to Honolulu.
   Dan Dennin, a salesman from Honolulu, was reading in a window
seat near the back of the plane when the jet was rocked by the
blast. At first he thought his window had blown out, but he looked
up and saw a gaping hole just behind the cockpit.
   ``A third of the roof was gone ... I looked up and saw blue
sky,'' he said.
   The intercom system no longer worked, but oxygen masks dropped
in front of passengers where the roof was still intact.
   ``But the wind just blew them away. We couldn't use them,'' said
passenger Mae Kagihara.
   The passengers helped each other don life-jackets and tuck their
heads down between their legs, according to several passengers. As
the plane landed, passengers applauded and cheered, they said.
   The uninjured then helped those who were hurt.
   ``There was debris all over the place,'' said Kagihara. ``When
that thing ripped open, there was all that debris flying around.
   ``The guy sitting next to the aisle got hit and there was blood
all over,'' she said. ``It was all over the place. We are lucky to
be alive,'' Kagihara said.
   Alice Godwin of Boulder City, Nev., said she had put on a life
jacket and placed her head between her knees.
   ``I sang all the hymns I knew,'' she said. ``That kept me busy.''
   Rick West, a banker from Hilo, said the passengers remained very
calm.
   ``It was just a matter of waiting to see what would happen,'' he
said. ``It was a long wait.''
   ``Everyone was calm. Everyone was trying to help each other,''
said Stanford Samson, a Honolulu PBX supervisor.
   Kagihara and Samson said they didn't think the plane would be
able to land.
   ``I thought we were going to hit water. I thought, `This is
it,''' Samson said.
   ``At first I thought we were going to crash in the ocean,''
Kagihara said. ``Then when we got close to land, I thought at least
I could swim.''
   The passengers appeared calm after they landed on Maui, said
Kevin Hildebrant, a tour driver who helped take the injured to Maui
Memorial Hospital.
   ``They were overly calm, I guess, to compensate for what they
went through,'' he said.
