<DESCRIPT>  OBITUARY  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  In the early part of this century, Jacinth "Jess" Soares grew up in a Hawaii
that was mostly wilderness, where children dived into the ocean to ride the
backs of giant sea turtles and learned to ride horses at a young age.;   
Years later, retired in San Jose, Mr. Soares told family and friends stories
of his early days as a Paniola cowboy on the big island of Hawaii, long before
he came to San Jose to work again as a cowboy and as a mechanic.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Last Monday, Mr. Soares died at San Jose Medical Center. He was 92.;    Mr.
Soares was born in Pauuillo, Hawaii, shortly after the islands became a U.S.
territory.;    By the time he was 13, he was training horses and herding
cattle on Hawaii.;    But Mr. Soares realized the islands' economy was poor.
So in 1920, he moved to California in search of change and a chance to earn
more.;    He soon landed a job as a cowboy on a foothills ranch east of San
Jose's Evergreen Valley, and sent part of his pay to his parents and younger
brothers and sisters in Hawaii.;    In 1935, Mr. Soares and Margaret Cancilla,
a San Jose native, were married at Sacred Heart Catholic Church.;    Mr.
Soares went to work in 1940 as a mechanic for the San Jose Canning Co., a job
he held until his retirement in 1965.;    His wife died in 1982.;  Jacinth
