<LEADPARA>  THIS is the peak season in Hawaii -- for good reason. Temperatures are in the
high 70s, low 80s; trade winds rustle the palm trees; the skies are clear and
blue.;    Normally, you'd have a hard time getting a plane reservation to
Hawaii or a decent room in one of the popular resorts. And high season usually
commands top prices.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But these are anything but normal times. On top of a sluggish economy, the
gulf war led many Americans to cancel vacation plans. Hawaii is experiencing a
major drop in business. Hotels and resorts report cancellations for group
bookings and lackluster interest from individuals.;    "It's almost unheard of
to get phone calls in January asking for space in February or March, but this
year we got those calls and we had space." So reports Joyce Kaswandik, sales
manager at Destination Resorts, which books 320 condos at the Wailea Resort on
Maui.;    "Ordinarily, we would have difficulty accommodating people coming in
so late in the high season. But we can now," she says.;    Many major tour
operators, resorts and hotels have begun campaigns to lure mainlanders to the
islands. Their bait: price cuts or, at the least, more value for the same
money through package "enhancements.";    Properties in Hawaii are holding the
line at 1990 rates or even cutting them. This permits tour operators to pass
along savings with lower package prices. That's the case at Pleasant Hawaiian
Holidays in Westlake Village in Southern California, largest tour operator to
Hawaii. It's offering some packages that represent a 15 percent to 20 percent
discount from normal high-season rates.;    Where package prices themselves
are about the same as last year, travelers will find extras thrown in. In some
cases, this might be an additional night free, free car rentals or room
upgrades.;    Package deals;  Some examples of bargain packages:;    (box)
Pleasant Hawaiian's lead economy packages offer five nights accommodations on
Waikiki with air fare for $444 per person, double occupancy. That's estimated
to be $100 less than last year and probably the same as it was two years ago.;
   "That's almost the same as it was 10 years ago," said Howard Dunaier,
Pleasant Hawaiian's regional sales manager in San Francisco. He read from an
April 8, 1980, newspaper ad for eight days and seven nights in Waikiki for
$379.;    Another package offers seven nights in a Maui condo, round-trip air
fare to Honolulu from Los Angeles, inter-island air and use of a car for eight
days. Price: $684 per person. This is down from $850.;    According to
Dunaier, package prices may drop slightly because Hawaiian Air is reducing its
rates.;    For tour information, call (800) 242-9244; for reservations, call
your travel agent.;    (box) Suntrips, a San Jose charter firm, is offering
double occupancy, per person rates of $459 for seven days/six nights to
Hawaii. The package includes a studio condo, rental car and air fare.
According to an agent with Arista Travel, Saratoga, this is a spring promotion
and ends the first of June. It excludes the Easter holidays and departure days
are limited. Information: (408) 432-0700.;    (box) Sunbird, a San Jose travel
wholesaler, is offering Waikiki packages from the high-$300s. Included are air
fare, hotel for seven days/six nights and airport transfers. Similar Maui
packages are available from the mid-$400s and include a car. For information,
call your travel agent.;    Hotel deals;  Not only lower-end properties but
also luxury resorts are playing "let's make a deal.";    (box) The posh Four
Seasons Resort Wailea on Maui, which opened last March, is offering luxury,
ocean-view accommodations plus a full-size, air-conditioned, four-door sedan
with unlimited free miles for $320 per night per room. This time of year, the
room -- without the car -- would ordinarily go for $350. Information: (808)
874-8000.;    (box) The Maui Inter-Continental Wailea has eliminated seasonal
rates. Among its programs is a room-and-car package going at $99.50 per
person, per day.;    For families, it offers a second room free when parents
book their room at $285. In addition to accommodating up to four youngsters
under the age of 12 in the second room, the kids get three meals a day at no
charge. That package, however, only becomes available April 1.;    With a $38
million renovation just completed, the property wasn't in a position to reduce
rates, according to Brad Jencks, general manager, so it is enhancing its
packages.;    Information: (808) 879-1922.;    (box) The Hawaii Prince in
Waikiki and the Maui Prince at the Makena Golf Resort have rooms at $100 per
person based on double occupancy. Rates include a buffet breakfast daily and a
mid-size air-conditioned car with unlimited mileage. Information: (800)
321-OAHU or (800) 321-MAUI.;    Getting there;  Hawaiian Airlines' widely
advertised $299 round-trip air fare from the West Coast may be all the
incentive some world-weary people need to pack their bags.;    "This is a
great time for the consumer," said Nancie Brown, president of the Wailea
Destination Association.  </TEXT>
