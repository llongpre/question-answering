<TEXT>     While respectfully honoring the tragedies of World War II, the cruises will
recreate upbeat memories of the '40s with movies, dances, decor and games of
the times.;    Survivors to participate; Pearl Harbor survivors will travel on
all four cruises, sharing their experiences, both formally and informally,
with other passengers. Some will show photographs, scrapbooks and other
memorabilia of the 1941 event.;   Among the featured speakers will be James
Kimery, former commander-in-chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars; Ken Creese,
president of the National Association of Pearl Harbor Survivors; and British
historian John Costello and Capt. Roger Pineau, co-authors of "And I Was
There.";   Since special activities to commemorate the Pearl Harbor
anniversary are also being planned on land by various organizations, you may
want to stay on Oahu either before or after your cruise. There will be
concerts, fly-overs, gun salutes, parades, luaus, exhibits and informal talks.
Major speakers will include President Bush and other government officials.;  
Many of the events will be open to the public; Pearl Harbor survivors and
relatives of those who were killed will be specially honored guests.;  
Memorial services; American Hawaii Cruises will provide shuttle buses to
transport passengers who want to attend sunrise or sunset memorial services at
Punch Bowl, the national cemetery, or the solemn events taking place at the
Arizona Memorial (see story on Page 8T).;   The Pearl Harbor anniversary
cruises are being offered at American Hawaii's standard cruise rates, said
Gene Ferretti, the cruise line's president. Prices for the one-week cruises
range from $1,095 to $3,695 and up per person, depending on the
accommodations. Special rates are extended to the third and fourth occupants
of some cabins, and children cruise at bargain prices. Attractive specials
offer resort stays on the islands before or after the cruises, reduced air
fare to Honolulu, shipboard credits and other discounts.;   Both the
Independence and the Constitution celebrated their 40th birthdays this year,
but you would never guess their ages. There are some differences between the
two (the Independence has a solarium and a big dining room, the Constitution
has a new fitness center and two smaller dining rooms), but both have good
food and more-than-adequate service.;   The Constitution and the Independence
leave from Honolulu's Aloha Tower every Saturday night, sailing into the
setting sun as they begin their travels around the islands of Oahu, Hawaii,
Maui and Kauai. Stopover itineraries vary somewhat, so inquire.;   Calling at
five ports, they offer opportunities to experience various venues of Hawaii,
with shore excursions ranging from underwater adventures along the coral reefs
of Lahaina to helicopter touring of live volcanoes on the Big Island of
Hawaii. Other activities include deep-sea fishing, river-boating, horseback
riding and exploring with kayaks, bicycles, carriages and catamarans.;  
Shipboard activities may have you winning the shuffleboard tournament, pumping
iron or simply lounging on deck. You'll rustle up an outfit for the costume
contest, learn to make a lei or carve a scrimshaw, visit the captain on the
bridge and eat as often as six times a day.;   Activities for children from
toddlers to teens are arranged by youth counselors in fun surroundings
including a well-equipped play room, juke box, electronic games and a soda
fountain.; IF YOU GO . . .; (check) Information - The four Pearl Harbor
anniversary cruises offer special appeal, but other American Hawaii cruises
are available throughout the year. Fares, based on double occupancy, are
available in a number of categories, ranging from $1,095 to $3,695. Give up a
porthole and you pay less. The line is offering a 20 percent discount on
selected cruises this fall. American Hawaii is located at 550 Kearny St., San
Francisco 94108; (800) 765-7000.;   (check) ETC -- Remember to squirrel away
at least $100 per person for shipboard snacks, beverages and souvenirs
(passengers can open an all-in-one charge account with a major credit card).
Add accordingly if you tend to patronize the bar or order wine with dinner.
Tipping among the waiters, cabin stewards and assistants normally amounts to
$50 per person for the week; you cannot charge tips.;   (check) SHORE
EXCURSIONS -- Both ships have good food and non-stop activities, but you may
want to take an excursion. They aren't mandatory, but they're a good way to
visit the neighbor islands. Prices vary. Here are some examples (prices are
per person): helicopter tour of the Big Island's volcanoes, $145; snorkel sail
off the Kona coast, with lunch, $56; Kauai kayak trip, $35. Tour descriptions
are presented on both ships during a "lecture" the day after embarking.  </TEXT>
