Emergency crews descended by ropes from helicopters Wednesday to recover the 
last four bodies from the steep terrain where a tour airplane crashed over the 
weekend, killing all 11 people aboard.

Delphine Clemenz of Torrance, Calif., was identified Wednesday as one of those 
on the Scenic Air Tours flight.

The twin-engine Beechcraft was en route Sunday from Hilo Airport on Hawaii to 
Kahului on the island of Maui when it slammed into the 1,800-foot-high 
escarpment at the back of remote Waipio Valley.

A team of three from the National Transportation Safety Board was headed for 
Hawaii Island to meet with officials in charge of the recovery effort, Bruce 
Butts, operations officer for the Hawaii County Civil Defense Agency, said.

An NTSB team member said that in addition to examining the crash site the team 
would investigate crew training procedures and how the tour company selects 
pilots.

Seven of the dead were removed by helicopter Tuesday and taken to Hilo 
Hospital, where identification work was under way, Butts said.
