   The National Transportation Safety Board laid
the major blame today on Aloha Airlines' maintenance program for
failing to detect fatigue damage to the fuselage of a 19-year-old
Boeing 737 that split open over Hawaii slightly more than a year
ago.
   After a daylong meeting, the board concluded that Aloha's
management failed to supervise maintenance of its aging fleet
properly. The board also blamed the Federal Aviation Administration
for improperly assessing the airline's inspection program and
issuing inadequate orders for ensuring the safety of older
airliners.
   The board said Aloha's maintenance operations failed ``to detect
the presence of significant disbonding and fatigue damage'' on the
surface of the fuselage.
   The board criticized the FAA for failing to order replacement of
rivets along joints in the 737's outer skin much earlier than it
did.
   Board member Joseph Nall dissented from the five-member board's
decision, saying he wanted blame to be more widely spread for the
failure of the aviation system to deal earlier with the problem of
aging airliners.
   Earlier today, metallurgist James Wildey told the board that a
3-foot-by-4-foot piece of metal skin from the airplane showed it
had been repaired but still contained cracks that were missed by
airline mechanics before the April 28, 1988, accident.
   The accident has led to sweeping changes, including required
replacements of parts, in the maintenance of airliner fleets
worldwide.
   A stewardess was killed when she was sucked out through an
18-foot hole in the plane's fuselage, but the pilot managed to land
the airline safely at Kahului Airport on Maui with 94 other people
aboard. Sixty-one passengers and crew members were injured. The
plane had been flying at 24,000 feet en route from Hilo to Honolulu
when the section of fuselage ripped off.
   Wildey, a board staff member, said evidence showed that
inspection for possible cracks by airline mechanics, required on
all early 737s, was ``either not performed or performed
ineffectively.''
   ``The piece that they repaired contained additional fatigue
cracks that were underneath the repair patches, between the repair
patches and on either side of the repair patches,'' Wildey said.
   Chief investigator Barry Trotter described the harrowing
incident, saying ``the captain observed that the cockpit-cabin door
was gone, and there was blue sky where the ceiling had been.''
   He said the board staff drew up 24 recommendations arising from
the accident for airlines, Boeing and the FAA. The recommendations
were not disclosed immediately.
   The safety board staff examined the role of metal fatigue,
aircraft design, the airlines' maintenance program, crew
performance and FAA directives affecting the aircraft, which had
logged nearly 90,000 flights.
   The Aloha investigation, which was kept confidential up to
today's meeting, was based on inspection of the plane, interviews,
public hearings and other data.
   The accident focused worldwide attention on the issue of aging
airliners and led to several FAA orders for inspections and
modifications. The average age of in-service airliners exceeds 13
years, and jetliners are rarely retired as the demand for air
travel increases and orders for new jets have to be made years in
advance.
   A series of FAA directives stepping up inspections and ordering
some modifications of older aircraft followed the Aloha incident.
   The FAA cited the accident last week when it issued a
far-reaching series of airworthiness directives changing the way
all older Boeing-built airliners will be kept safe. The directives
give airlines four years to replace parts and make other
modifications on Boeing 727s, 737s and 747s that either reach 20
years of age or a set number of takeoffs for each model.
   Before the orders, which are set to become final by late summer,
were issued, airlines were required to make periodic inspections,
replacing parts only when they showed signs of excessive wear.
   Four months before the Aloha accident, an in-depth FAA
inspection found that Aloha did not have an adequate system for
complying with FAA directives and properly maintaining its planes.
   The FAA had warned airlines to check for corroding fasteners
that hold pieces of the fuselage together and had ordered close
inspection of the upper skin of the early 737s because routine
inspections had turned up cracks in some planes.
   Aloha had said it complied with FAA maintenance orders before
the incident and had found nothing unusual in inspection of the
plane that tore open.
   After the accident, investigators said they found minute cracks
where the 18-foot hole in the fuselage apparently started.
