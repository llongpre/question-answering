<LEADPARA>  'THERE, where the red hibiscus blooms, is where Robert Louis Stevenson sat
under a great banyan tree, and drank in the beauty of it and created poetry --
there, at that very place where now there is no banyan tree, only a new cement
building.";    The deep, solemn voice of the Hawaiian woman in the long red
muumuu rolled the words dramatically, somberly. She paused.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the hush, only the ever-present rumble of Waikiki's traffic was heard.
Suddenly, she smiled. "But that's progress.";    All of Honolulu's attractions
aren't sand and sea. One of the nicest things that has happened to Waikiki
since Duke Kahanamoku trained for the Olympics here is "Aunty" Malia Solomon,
a Pacific anthropologist who knows the history of the area. She has joined
with the Hyatt Regency Waikiki to offer a free daily walking tour of Waikiki.;
   The 90-minute guided tour takes in sites that most visitors never see -- or
that they pass by never knowing what they've missed. The wizard stones, for
instance, are four large rocks that crop up from the coral sands of Kuhio
Beach, next to the Moana Hotel. They were once dedicated, according to legend,
to four soothsayers who came to Oahu from Tahiti long before Captain James
Cook dropped anchor in either place.;    Now swimmers drape their towels over
the stones, Solomon says with a scowl, ignorant that the rocks contain a
special mana, or power.;    The Hyatt Regency has established a personal
museum and gallery for Solomon in the hotel, which is halfway between Ala
Moana Yacht Basin and Kapiolani Park. There she teaches island skills and
crafts and displays some of the cultural richness of Hawaii.;    In between,
she conducts walking tours down busy Kalakaua Avenue and tells how it was
named for the last King of Hawaii. That's on the route to Ainahau, "the
grounds of the princess who never ruled," Princess Ka'iulani.;    Also on our
list of fun things to do in Honolulu involving neither sand nor water is a
tour of Chinatown. Captain Cook first saw these islands in 1778 and the first
Chinese arrived only 11 years later.;    The original commerce between the
Kingdom of Hawaii and the rest of the world was sandalwood for Chinese silk,
which explains why there are no more sandalwood forests.;    The first sugar
plantation was founded in 1802 by a Chinese immigrant, and when the big
plantations were planted, it was Chinese laborers who worked them.;    The
Chinatown tour starts at Nuuanu Street and covers 15 blocks. There are 45
buildings on the National Register of Historic Buildings. Whole blocks are on
the register, even though most of the area was rebuilt after the January 1900
fire when buildings in Chinatown were deliberately destroyed by the city in an
attempt to stop the spread of bubonic plague.;    Go into Shung Cho Yuein
Chinese candy store, 1027 Maunakea St., and sample some of the candied ginger,
papaya and carrot. The Fook Sautong herbal medicine shop, across the street,
is packed with herbs which have, many Chinese believe, the ability to cure
almost anything.;    A block over, at 1041 Kekaulike St., at the Kim Fat
Chinese Grocery, dried Chinese fruit, displayed in large jars, is the lure. At
1028 Kekaulike St. is Ying Leong Look Funn Factory, where Hawaiian appetizers
are made by hand daily.;    Cross Smith and Hotel streets on your tour and
they'll seem quiet and tranquil, yet these streets once were the center of
Honolulu's red light district. Though the city is trying to clean things up,
if you return here after 9 p.m., you'll find that not much has changed.;    Be
sure to end your tour at Wo Fat, the garish three-story pink building at the
corner of Hotel and Maunakea streets. Wo Fat first opened in 1882 and is the
oldest restaurant in Hawaii, possibly the oldest, continuously operated
Chinese restaurant in the United States. There's an all-you-can-eat lunch
buffet, plus a huge a la carte menu.;    You can stroll Chinatown on your own,
but you'll get more from it if you join one of the guided tours operated by
the Hawaiian Heritage Center, the Chinese Chamber of Commerce or the Chinatown
Historical Society.;    Finally, to see the area between Waikiki and
Chinatown, there's a self-guided walking tour that includes Iolani Palace, the
only royal palace on American soil, and Kawaiahao Church, Honolulu's oldest,
built in 1841 out of coral.;    The Mission Houses Museum is a collection of
the oldest Western-style structures in Hawaii, at King and Punchbowl streets.
All built between 1821 and 1831, these were the homes and work places of the
New England missionaries.;    Also included are the Aloha Tower and the Hawaii
Maritime Center. Docked here are the Falls of Clyde, the world's last
four-masted, full-rigged sailing vessel, and the Hokulea, a full-size
Polynesian voyaging boat that is part of a canoe display.;     If you go . .
