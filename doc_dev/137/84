   Old people suffer more heart disease if their
blood cholesterol is high and they might benefit by eating less
fat, exercising and losing weight, a government study has concluded.
   The findings contradict earlier research which made some doctors
reluctant to advise elderly people to reduce their serum
cholesterol, said Dr. Dwayne Reed of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute.
   The study of 3,440 middle-aged and 1,419 elderly men in Hawaii
showed that a high level of cholesterol in the bloodstream
increased the risk of future heart disease among 65- to
74-year-olds just as it did for those age 50 to 59.
   The 20 percent of men with the highest cholesterol levels were
1.7 times more likely to develop heart disease within 12 years than
the 20 percent of men with the lowest levels, regardless of whether
they were middle-aged or elderly when the study started in 1977.
   That means people with high cholesterol _ levels above 240
milligrams of cholesterol per deciliter of blood _ ``should be
treated the same no matter what age they are,'' he added.
   Reed, an epidemiologist and physician who directs the
government's Honolulu Heart Program, presented the findings
Thursday during an American Heart Association conference.
   He said the results contradict some earlier findings of a famed
study that started in 1948 and linked high blood cholesterol, high
blood pressure and cigarette smoking to increased heart disease
among residents of Framingham, Mass. For years, the study found no
significant link between heart disease and cholesterol among people
65 and older.
   ``Previous to 1985-86, we would say it looks like cholesterol is
weak or non-existent as a risk factor in the elderly,'' said Dr.
Peter Wilson, laboratory director for the Framingham study.
   That's because there were too few elderly people in the study
until recent years, and their health hadn't been followed long
enough to reveal the cholesterol hazard, he added.
   Recent analyses of Framingham data confirm the Hawaii findings
linking high blood cholesterol and heart disease risk among people
65 and older, but ``there's been a lag in terms of communication to
the public,'' Wilson said.
   Wilson said the new study only demonstrates that cholesterol
raises heart disease risk in elderly people. It will be a few years
before studies determine if their risk can be reduced with
cholesterol-lowering drugs or by cutting dietary fat, losing weight
and increasing exercise.
   A majority of cholesterol experts believe all adults should
``know your cholesterol level and bring it down'' if it's above
240, first by dieting for a year, then by trying medications shown
to be safe, Wilson said. People with levels over 300 often need
medication immediately, he said.
   He noted that elderly heart disease patients already under a
doctor's care are the most likely targets for such treatment. Those
who should be checked for high cholesterol include seniors with
other coronary risk factors such as high blood pressure, cigarette
smoking or family history of heart disease.
   Experts are debating whether cholesterol testing would be worth
the cost for all senior citizens.
   Seniors with high cholesterol should see a doctor who doesn't
simply try to reduce total cholesterol, but tries to raise
so-called ``good'' cholesterol, or HDL, while reducing ``bad''
cholesterol, or LDL, Wilson said.
   He urged people to get their cholesterol tested through a doctor
who draws blood from a vein and has the blood tested by
sophisticated equipment. Experts have disputed the accuracy of
portable testing units that use blood from a finger stick. Such
units often are seen in shopping malls.
   Reed said some doctors still don't urge old people to quit
cigarettes because of earlier Framingham data that found no
increase in heart disease risk in elderly smokers. But Wilson said
most doctors and patients ``have gotten the message on smoking.''
   The men in the Hawaii study are of Japanese ancestry and have
lower heart disease death rates than white Americans. Reed said
research has shown that regardless of race, ``the biological causes
of heart disease are the same. ... And there is no reason to
believe their biological effect would change as people get older.''
