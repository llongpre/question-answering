   A collision of two helicopters was the apparent
cause of a crash that killed four U.S. Marines during a training
exercise on Okinawa, American military authorities said today.
   It was the second time in a week that Marine Corps fliers were
involved in fatal collisions in flight.
   Last Tuesday, nine Marines and an Air Force officer died in a
training crash in the Arizona desert, and Marine officials said the
two helicopters they were in apparently collided in flight.
   The U.S. Media Liaison Office announced Monday that four Marines
had been killed in a crash on the southern Japanese island of
Okinawa that day, but no cause of the crash was given.
   Today, it issued a statement saying two CH-46 helicopters
``apparently collided while conducting routine training
operations.''
   One of the big twin-rotor copters crashed in mountainous
terrain, killing all four men aboard, the other returned to Marine
Corps Air Station Futenma on Okinawa with damage in the nose area
but no injuries aboard, it said.
   The cause of the crash was under further investigation, the
office said.
   The crash occurred in such difficult terrain that rescuers had
to be lowered on ropes from a helicopter to reach the wreckage.
   Meanwhile, Japanese Foreign Minister Sosuke Uno expressed regret
over the crash and concern at what might have happened if the
collision had occurred over a populated area.
   He also said the Foreign Ministry had asked U.S. military
authorities to look into reports of live ammunition having been
found after military exercises on Okinawa and stray bullets hitting
houses.
   ``There is rather a lot of carelessness,'' he said.
   His comments pointed to underlying friction between Japanese
civilians and the military on Okinawa, where about 30,000 U.S.
troops are based.
   The Marine fliers were on six-month assignment to Okinawa for
training from their base at Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, the U.S. statement
said.
   It identified the four killed as Maj. Richard J. Eisloeffel, 34,
of El Cajon, Calif.; Capt. Michael F. King, 31, of Bend, Ore.,
whose wife Constance King lives in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii; Cpl. Sean
M. Timmons, 20, of Isle Of Palms, S.C., whose wife Stacy L. Timmons
lives in Honolulu; and Cpl. Charles F. Dehn II, 20, of Glendale,
Ore.
