   Eight people aboard a twin-engine
commuter plane that vanished off Rhode Island have been given up
for dead.
   The Coast Guard called off the search by air and sea Wednesday
night for the New England Airlines plane that disappeared Tuesday
during a 17-mile flight from Block Island to the mainland.
   Searchers had found the bodies of a passenger's two dogs that
had been on board, as well as a cabin panel, life jackets, seat
cushions, a headset and other debris believed to be from the plane,
but saw no other sign of the aircraft itself or those aboard.
   ``The results of the search indicated there were probably no
survivors from the crash,'' Petty Officer David Jersey said.
   In Westerly, National Transportation Safety Board spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz said today that without wreckage the cause of the
crash is unlikely to be determined.
   ``I think all we're going to be able to do today is go through
the aircraft records and the pilot records, and unless something
comes up out of the ordinary, there won't be much,'' he said.
   The NTSB had no authority to order a search for the wreckage,
and any attempts to find it would be up to the airline's insurance
company, Lopatkiewicz said.
   The Coast Guard began its search shortly after the British
Norman Islander plane, built in 1969, was reported missing.
   Coast Guard officials had expressed hope early Wednesday of
finding survivors, but veteran islanders said the seas of 5 to 6
feet and water temperature of about 45 degrees made survival
unlikely.
   The debris was found mainly in an area where the water averages
100 feet deep.
   Thomas Grady, New England Airlines' attorney, said the Federal
Aviation Administration would also investigate.
   The plane ``had the most thorough inspection it gets in the
preceding 30 days,'' he said.
