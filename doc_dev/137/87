   Passengers on Friday praised the Aloha
Airlines pilot who safely brought down a jetliner blown open at
24,000 feet, with one man saying the landing was ``just like riding
in a Cadillac.''
   ``It came down so smooth, it was better than a regular
landing,'' said Mae Kagihara, who had thought the plane was going
to crash Thursday.
   The Boeing 737, piloted by Robert Schornstheimer, landed at
Kahului Airport on Maui Island, 15 to 20 feet of its upper fuselage
_ just behind the front passenger door _ torn away to the floor.
Witnesses said one engine was on fire. One attendant apparently was
sucked from the cabin to her death, and 61 people were injured, two
critically.
   ``I give credit to the pilot. He brought that plane down so
smoothly. It was just like riding in a Cadillac,'' said John Lopez,
40, one of 89 passengers aboard Flight 243 from Hilo, on the Hawaii
Island, to Honolulu.
   A structural failure is suspected of having caused the cabin to
blow open. Investigators have ruled out a bomb blast, sources said.
   Schornstheimer, a 42-year-old former Air Force pilot, realized
there was a hole in fuselage but was not aware of the extent of the
damage until after the landing, said his father, also named Robert.
   ``He says it was just something else _ all of a sudden there was
this noise, and the plane's flying funny and there's a big drag on
it, so he immediately decided to change the flight plan to land at
the Maui airport, which was closest, and he was able to get it in
and land it,'' the elder Schornstheimer father said from his home
in Marietta, Ohio.
   The pilot was taken to an undisclosed location by Aloha for
questioning by investigators from the Federal Aviation
Administration and National Transportation Safety Board, officials
said.
   U.S. Transportation Secretary Jim Burnley telephoned and
congratulated him for the landing, said a spokesman for the
department.
   ``Because the upper structure was gone, there was a possibility
of the plane buckling,'' said Dale Bringelson, owner of Island
Aeromotive, who watched the landing from his company hangar at
Kahului Airport. ``If he hadn't been real careful, it could have
busted in two. The man was highly skilled and it speaks well of the
profession.''
   Mark Eberly, a ramp supervisor at the airport, said he and a
friend dropped to their knees as they saw the plane land, its cabin
exposed.
   The jetliner was weaving as it headed in, he said. ``You could
tell his plane was on one engine,'' Eberly said. ``One engine was
on fire and smoking.''
   ``I have to give the pilot credit. He brought it in good,''
Eberly said.
   ``I can't believe the airplane was still flying or that people
sitting in that area survived,'' said F. Emmett Miller, an Aloha
pilot who has flown 737s for 20 years. ``I think it's a statement
probably any pilot would make looking at it. I just think that Bob
Schornstheimer did a wonderful job.''
   The elder Schornstheimer said his son sounded calm when they
spoke by telephone Thursday night.
   ``He's pretty calm under pressure. He said he was calm and did
what needed to be done, just like any other pilot would have. They
were talking about it on TV like (he was a hero), but he said he
just did what any other pilot would have done in the same
circumstance,'' the father said.
   Schornstheimer's wife, Mary, said she learned of the explosion
and safe landing from friends. ``I wasn't worried,'' she said. ``I
have a lot of confidence in his ability as a pilot.''
   The elder Schornstheimer said his son was in the Air Force from
1967 to 1974, serving as a flight instructor and then as an air
traffic controller at Vance Air Force base in Enid, Okla.
   Schornstheimer then worked as a civilian air traffic controller
at Kaneohe Marine Air base on Oahu from 1974 until joining Aloha as
a pilot in 1977, his father said.
   Schornstheimer is secretary-treasurer of the local council of
the Air Line Pilots Assocation and just made captain status this
year, said his stepmother, Nancy Schornstheimer.
