   Four Air Force reconnaissance planes are
searching the Hawaiian Islands for marijuana fields as the crews
are flying training missions there, the Pentagon said Friday.
   The RF-4C reconnaissance planes are from the 67th Tactical
Reconnaissance Wing at Bergstrom Air Force Base in Texas, said
Defense Department spokesman Army Maj. John Smith.
   Smith said he did not know how many missions the planes have
flown or whether they've found any marijuana.
   The four planes, along with 50 support personnel, are operating
out of Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii during the operation, he
said.
   Smith said National Guard planes have flown similar operations
over the islands as far back as the 1970s but he did not know if
federal armed forces had done so in the past.
   At Bergstrom, Sgt. Vern Paul, a spokeswoman, confirmed that
flights were being made over Hawaii and said she did not know when
they started.
