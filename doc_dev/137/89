Hurricane Dalilia swirled toward Hawaii today on a course that would take it 
150 miles south of the state's southernmost island, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
"Anything can happen. The way it looks now we may get a little from it, but not 
much," said Edmund Manning of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center here. "But 
then you can't be too optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
At 2 a.m. today, the hurricane was 830 miles east-southeast of Hawaii Island, 
southernmost in the chain, moving west-northwest at 20 m.p.h., Manning said. 
Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75 m.p.h.. A storm is classified a 
hurricane when that speed reaches 74 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to pass south of Hawaii 
Island, the "Big Island," on Tuesday night.
