   Hawaii has the nation's lowest rate of
preventable deaths from chronic diseases and Michigan has the
highest, the federal Centers for Disease Control said Wednesday.
   The CDC found that the 50 states and the District of Columbia
could have prevented at least 26 percent of their deaths from nine
leading chronic diseases in 1986 by reducing such risks as smoking
and cholesterol levels.
   ``The bottom line is there are a lot of these deaths that are
potentially preventable,'' said Steven M. Teutsch, a CDC
epidemiologist who helped research the study.
   ``What we are hoping states do is look at where they fall in
terms of these chronic disease deaths and then examine the specific
problems in their states.''
   The study found that Hawaii had the lowest rate of preventable
deaths, with 26.4 percent of 2,817 deaths that year labeled as
preventable. North Dakota and Utah, both with 33.2 percent, tied
for the second lowest rate. New Mexico, with 37.2 percent, and
Minnesota, with 37.7 percent, rounded out the lowest five.
   Michigan had the highest rate - 53.5 percent - followed by West
Virginia's 53.3 percent, New York's 52.6 percent, Ohio's 52.1
percent and Kentucky's 52 percent.
   The CDC study, published in this week's Journal of the American
Medical Association, found that if each state reduced a risk for
its most prevalent disease, the national life expectancy of 73.7
years would increase by four years.
   Teutsch said the study was the first federal effort to track
preventable deaths, which it considered stroke, coronary heart
disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
liver disease and lung, breast, cervical and colorectal cancers in
1986, the latest year data were available.
   Teutsch said the differences in rates of preventable deaths are
``potentially explainable'' by isolating various factors.
   For instance, he said Michigan's high rate may be attributable
to it being a highly industrialized state with high minority
populations where knowledge about risk of disease is low.
   In Hawaii, on the other hand, the diet leans strongly toward
seafood and vegetables, which contributes to lower cholesterol
rates and less heart disease.
   Researchers figured out which state had the lowest mortality
rate of each of the diseases and added those rates to create a
mythical ``utopian state'' with the lowest death rate in all nine
diseases - about 224 per 100,000 population. Then they compared
each state to the ideal.
   Hawaii came the closest to the ``utopian state,'' with 304.7
deaths per 100,000, or 80.34 above the ideal. Thus 26.4 percent of
its deaths were considered preventable.
   Teutsch said researchers have found that reducing even one of
the known risks for these diseases - such as smoking for lung
cancer and cholesterol for heart disease - dramatically lowers
chances of developing the illnesses.
   ``What we've seen is what's been achieved in some state,''
Teutsch said, pointing out that Hawaii has the nation's low heart
disease rate. ``If that's been achieved in some state, it
presumably can be achieved in another state.''
   The study found cigarette smoking contributed to the most deaths
from the nine diseases, 33 percent. Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle,
high cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes followed.
   It also found that use of mammography and Pap screening for
breast and cervical cancers could lower deaths from those diseases.
