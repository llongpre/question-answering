   James Brolin's 30-year acting career has had
many incarnations and these days he's wearing several hats.
   In addition to serving as host of a new syndicated TV program,
he's working on a film, a miniseries, and a new police series.
   Brolin most often has been the leading man in series such as
``Hotel'' and movies such as ``Capricorn One,'' ``Westworld'' and
``Gable and Lombard,'' a bomb in which he portrayed screen hero
Clark Gable.
   This season, Brolin, who's turned down many series offers since
his original success as the young doctor in ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,''
is host of a heart-tugging TV series called ``Reunion.'' It brings
together friends and relatives who have become separated and seeks
those who heretofore have defied contact.
   The weekly series, which began in September, is seen on 130
television stations across the country.
   ``When they showed me a tape of what they were doing the tears
started flowing,'' he says. ``I figured if it could work on old
jaded me it should be a success. The show has a goodness to it.
We're not trying to catch crooks. I don't think there's any other
show that opens your heart like this.''
   But there's much more in store for Brolin:
   -He plays his first comedy role, as a hippie artist on the beach
in 1974, in the upcoming movie ``Love in Venice.''
   -In February he plays a murder victim in the CBS miniseries
``And the Sea Will Tell.''
   -Brolin and Barry Morrow, Oscar-winning co-writer of ``Rain
Man,'' have teamed up to develop an unorthodox police show for CBS.
Brolin will play a crime laboratory technician who loses his job in
a budget cutback and forces the city to make him a detective so he
can complete the years needed for retirement.
   -Brolin also told the producers of ABC's ``Young Riders'' he'd
like to direct an episode, and possibly co-star with his son Josh.
Two years ago they teamed up as father and son for Turner Network
Television's first original movie, ``Finish Line.''
   Brolin's iron-gray hair and beard is growing back after he
shaved his face clean and wore a crewcut for his role in ``And the
Sea Will Tell'' in Hawaii.
   ``I prefer the beard,'' he says. ``It's easier than shaving. I
started growing a beard in 1971. I've worn it most of the time. I
had it for `Hotel.' The people at `Reunion' don't care if I have
the beard or not.''
   Brolin, who earned an Emmy for his role on the long-running
series ``Marcus Welby, M.D.,'' is married to actress Jan Smithers,
who had a featured role as one of the few sane people on ``WKRP in
Cincinnati.''
   They have a 3-year-old daughter, Molly. Brolin has two sons from
an earlier marriage, Josh and Jess, who's in high school.
   Brolin has strong ties to Tahiti, where he and his family own 11
acres at Taravoa. His brother, Brian, is moving to Tahiti, and his
father, Henry, has spent time there as a land developer.
   ``In 1958 my Dad said he was sailing to theSouth Seas and asked
me to come along,'' he says. ``I said I was working on my career,
but then I went with him when I was signed to play Marlon Brando's
son in the remake of `Mutiny on the Bounty.'
   ``I didn't do the role but I spent seven months in Tahiti. My
family stayed for a year, and Dad helped show the Tahitians how to
convert some of the land from copra. We ended up buying land for a
hotel 30 years ago, and now it's right where they're going to build
a new city.''
   Brolin recently returned from Hawaii where he worked on ``And
The Sea Will Tell.'' It's based on Vincent Bugliosi and Bruce
Henderson's upcoming book about the disappearance of a San Diego
couple on a sailing cruise to tiny Palmyra Island south of Hawaii.
   ``At the same time a hippie couple sailed out of Hawaii bound
for the same island,'' Brolin says. ``Eight months later they
sailed back in the San Diego couple's boat, the Sea Wind. There
were no bodies so they were charged only with yacht theft. Six
years later they found the wife's bones and they were charged with
murder.''
   Brolin and Diedre Hall star as the San Diego couple who
disappeared. Rachel Ward and Hart Bochner are the young couple and
Richard Crenna appears as Bugliosi, one-time Manson Family
prosecutor who later served as defense attorney for the woman
defendant.
   The four-hour miniseries switches back and forth between the
courtroom and Palmyra.
