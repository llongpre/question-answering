   In the 1950s, readers of ``From Here to
Eternity'' were shocked by its strong language and sexy scenes. But
even steamier was author James Jones' original manuscript, a
professor who found it says.
   Editors from Scribners publishing house in New York forced Jones
to rewrite many lewd passages and tone down the language in the
book about Army life in 1941.
   ``It was heavily edited. Scribners was afraid of what would
happen if the language was not toned down,'' University of Illinois
English professor George Hendrick said Thursday night. ``Rightly
so, given the times. It was 1950. Censors would have banned it.''
   Hendrick, who found the 1,300-page manuscript while gathering
Jones' letters for a 1989 collection ``To Reach Eternity,'' said
the original work was superior to what was published.
   ``I think it is a better book. The language is grittier, more
reflective of Army speech in prewar Hawaii than the one Scribners
published. The scenes were much better the way Jones wrote them,
too,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home in Urbana,
Ill.
   Jones, who was stationed in Hawaii while serving in the Army in
prewar Hawaii, complained about the editing demands but gave in
because it was his first novel, Hendrick said.
   ``I'm not blaming Scribners. They had to do what they did,''
Hendrick said.
   Even more sanitized than the novel was the blockbuster movie
based on the book, starring Burt Lancaster and Frank Sinatra.
   ``There are major changes. It's a good story but not one Jones
wrote. The scene on the beach usually appears in film histories,''
said Hendrick, referring to the torrid scene between Lancaster and
Deborah Kerr in the Hawaiian surf.
   If the book were published in 1990, Hendrick said, no changes
would be made in the manuscript.
   ``Absolutely, it would be published today as it was,'' he added.
``It was a wonderful novel,'' he said.
   But he thinks Jones wrote an even better novel.
   ```The Thin Red Line' was even better. It was not as popular,
but Jones had learned a tremendous lot by having written his first
novel,'' said Hendrick, who met Jones in 1962 when the author was
touring Europe.
   After ``From Here to Eternity'' was published in 1951, Jones,
who died in 1977 at age 55, gave the manuscript to Lowney Handy as
a birthday gift.
   Mrs. Handy, Jones' lover, operated a writers' colony in his
southern Illinois hometown of Robinson, Hendrick said.
   He fictionalized the affair with Mrs. Handy in his second novel,
``Some Came Running.'' But during a visit to New York for its
publication, he met Gloria Mosolino and they married.
   Jones wanted the manuscript back, but Mrs. Handy refused, and
after her death in 1964, relatives stored the document in a garage.
   It ended up in a bank vault, where Hendrick found it.
   Widow Gloria Jones and daughter Kaylie were on hand in April for
ceremonies in connection with the University of Illinois'
acquisition of the manuscript.
   ``It was the first time they had seen the manuscript. They were
pleased to see it and have it in the hands of an institution,''
said Hendrick.
