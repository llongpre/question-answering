Ten years ago, school teachers Evie Werner and Al Davis bid goodby to their 
classes in the San Francisco Bay Area and headed for Hawaii to launch a B&amp;B 
reservation service aimed at the budget traveler. The idea dawned after Werner 
and Davis fell in love with the islands during a vacation. The couple sent 
their regrets to friends on the mainland: "Goodby, we've found our Paradise." 
Only, could they afford the gamble? 
</P>
<P>
Werner and Davis decided it was worth the risk, so they bought a home and put 
up their shingle: "Bed &amp; Breakfast." Just the one home in the beginning. 
Now Werner and Davis represent more than 150 residences on Kauai, Maui, the Big 
Island, Oahu, Molokai and Lanai. Rates from $30/$50 single, $35/$80 double. A 
choice of homes, studio apartments, private cottages. The Werner/Davis team 
make the rounds personally, checking out hillside homes, beach houses and 
shacks by the sea, signing up only the best. In addition, they've put together 
a book listing the rentals. 
</P>

Write to Werner/Davis c/o Bed &amp; Breakfast Hawaii, P.O. Box 449, Kapaa, 
Kauai, Hawaii 96746. Telephone (808) 822-7771. Visa and MasterCard accepted.

Virginia City: To R.H. of Simi Valley, who asked for the name of a "reasonable" 
hotel or inn in Virginia City, Nev. I've had good luck with Edith Palmer's 
Country Inn, P.O. Box 756, Virginia City, Nev. 89440. Two rooms with private 
bath, three with shared bath. Rates: $60/$75. Besides breakfast, hosts prepare 
lunch/dinner on request. This is an old-style country house. Loads of 
atmosphere. An 1800s wine cellar serves as the dining room. You'll pay a bit 
more at the recently restored Chollar Mansion, 565 D St., Virginia City 89440.

Pocket-size water filters, headphones that filter out static on aircraft sound 
systems, ear plugs, currency converters, first-aid kits, luggage 
locks/straps/tags, maps, phrase books, inflatable pillows, electric adapters.

North Carolina Hideaway: Norm Ross, an ex-newspaperman, traded his Chicago beat 
for an inn in the woods of North Carolina. With his partner, Jim Rouse, Ross 
converted several old tobacco barns into log cabins for guests seeking escape 
from the stress of city life. Rustic charm, wooded landscape, a swimming pool. 
A good spot to keep in mind when May rolls around and wildflowers bloom 
profusely in North Carolina's mountains. Good hiking trails nearby, and the 
Blue Ridge Parkway leads to parks in the area.

A Ranch in the Rockies: A testimonial on behalf of Colorado ranch life from Dr. 
Anthony B. Sokol of Beverly Hills: "Vacationed last summer at the Drowsy Water 
Ranch in Granby, Colo. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Felt that the entire operation 
hosted by owners Ken and Randy Sue Fosha was excellent. The staff were 
attentive and solicitous and understood the needs of both adults and children 
to make the week enjoyable and safe. Guests ranged from secretaries to heads of 
corporations. A wonderful mix of people. We were surprised to find four 
separate families from England that had been returning to the ranch year after 
year. The accommodations, although Spartan, were just what we felt a ranch 
should have -- that is, log cabins. The food was wholesome and plentiful. We 
certainly recommend Drowsy Water Ranch as a wonderful family vacation."

For brochures, write to Ken and Randy Sue Fosha, Drowsy Water Ranch, Box 147, 
Granby, Colo. 80446. Telephone (303) 725-3456. Drowsy Water opens in late May, 
closes late in September. Rates: $800 per week single, $1,450 double. Cheaper
