   A military refueling jet bound for Hawaii
crashed in a ball of flames on takeoff Tuesday at Dyess Air Force
Base, killing all 19 people aboard, the Air Force said.
   Officials at K.I. Sawyer Air Force Base near Marquette, Michigan,
where the flight originated, said the plane's passengers included
spouses of military members or retired military members.
   The plane's crew ``never got it off the ground,'' said witness
Vernon Wright, 19. ``The first thing I saw was just the mushroom of
the smoke.''
   ``I heard the plane as it was coming down,'' said Skeet Jackson
of Abilene. ``Engines were backfiring and missing. It curved off to
the left and crashed. And then I saw the ball of smoke and fire go
up.''
   Initial reports fowarded to Air Force commanders at the Pentagon
suggested the pilot of the plane experienced some kind of problem
during his take-off roll, according to officials who spoke on
condition they not be identified.
   ``It was toward the end of the roll and he apparently had no
choice but to press on,'' said one source.
   ``But he didn't have the power to get up for some reason,'' added
another.
   The wreckage burned for more than an hour after the crash. The
plane came to rest tilted at about a 45 degree angle, a charred wing
tipped toward the sky.
   Military search and rescue teams set up floodlights and searched
into the night before the last two bodies were found, a base
spokesman said.
   The flight manifest showed that 17 of those on board were from
Sawyer Air Force Base and the other two boarded at Dyess, Master
Sgt. Al Dostal at Dyess said.
   The plane was en route from Dyess to Hickam Air Force Base in
Hawaii on a training mission, said Dyess Airman 1st Class Beverly
Foster.
   The sources in Washington said the plane was carrying close to a
full load of fuel totaling 155,000 pounds, including its own fuel
and fuel to transfer during the flight to Hawaii to some F-16
fighters flying across the Pacific.
   The Air Force said the KC-135A tanker crashed at 12:10 p.m. near
the south end of the Dyess runway, near U.S. Highway 277 about six
miles southwest of Abilene.
   The maintenance record for the plane, powered by four Pratt &amp;
Whitney jet engines, was not yet available, said Lt. Col. George
Peck, a spokesman at Strategic Air Command Headquarters at Omaha,
Neb.
   There is no ejection system on the plane, built in 1963, said
Peck.
   It was the second crash at Dyess in less than three months. A
B-1B bomber crashed there Nov. 8. The four-man crew safely bailed
out.
   The KC-135, dubbed the Stratotanker, is the backbone of the Air
Force's refueling fleet.
   The aircraft, a military spin-off of the Boeing 707, normally
takes a crew of four or five. It can carry a sizeable load of
passengers even when carrying fuel.
   The military began using the first KC-135As in 1956. The tankers
have a range of 1,150 miles while carrying 120,000 pounds of
transfer fuel. They cost $20.1 million.
   A KC-135 crashed Oct. 11, 1988, at Wurtsmith Air Base near
Oscoda, Mich. That plane, also based at Sawyer, crashed and burst
into flames on landing, killing six and injuring 10. An
investigation into that crash has been completed, but SAC has not
made it public.
