<LEADPARA>  EVERY year, from November to May, Hawaii plays host to some unusually
distinguished guests -- humpback whales -- who leave their summer home in the
Gulf of Alaska to winter in the warm waters off Hawaii. Between 500 and 800
whales congregate in the large shallow basin formed by the islands of Maui,
Lanai, Molokai and Kahoolawe, an area appropriately called the "bedroom of the
whales," since it is here that they mate and breed.;   Except for those
glimpsed in Southern California waters, the humpbacks in Hawaii constitute the
largest gathering of whales routinely visible to humans. In recent years,
watching the aquatic antics of these remarkable creatures has delighted
thousands of visitors to the islands.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Measuring from 40 to 50 feet long and weighing about 40 tons, the humpback
has distinctive characteristics that make it easily identifiable: bumps on its
snout, unusually long flippers, and a scalloped tail fin, called a fluke, that
is often 18 feet across. For all its bulk, the humpback is an agile and even
graceful swimmer. In one incredible display, known as "breaching," the whale
will propel its entire body out of the water and then land on its back or
side, sending up a wall of spray. Whether it breaches to communicate its
location, to dislodge the many barnacles and lice that cling to its ample
body, or simply to express a natural exuberance, no one knows for certain. But
the display is undeniably impressive.;   Smart and protective;   What
fascinates biologists and laymen alike about whales is their intelligence and
their highly developed social structure. A mother and her calf are always
accompanied by a third whale, usually male, perhaps the father, who helps
teach the newborn the necessities of life -- diving, breathing, breaching --
and runs interference for the mother and calf should anything threaten them.; 
 The most striking evidence of the humpbacks' sense of community is their
singing -- sonorous, otherworldly sounds thought to be mating calls or
communication to whales perhaps hundreds of miles away. The songs are
complicated sequences, lasting anywhere from 6 to 30 minutes, repeated over
and over. Not only do all the whales in a given community sing the same song
(North Pacific humpbacks sing a different song from humpbacks in the North
Atlantic), but the song changes, subtly, from year to year, and everybody
learns the new verses.;   Many on Maui;   Maui is by far the best island base
for whale watching. Whales can easily be seen from several spots along the
shore, and because Maui is a popular tourist destination, there are a number
of whale-watching cruises that leave from Lahaina and Maalaea harbors. The
cruise sponsored by the Pacific Whale Foundation (101 N. Kihei Road, Kealia
Beach Plaza, Kihei, Hawaii 96753; (808) 879-8811), a research organization, is
perhaps the most informative, but others run by residents well acquainted with
the waters can be just as fruitful. (If you book your cruise through the
Pacific Whale Foundation, a portion of your fare will go to its efforts on
behalf of the whales.);   Don't, however, take a boat out on your own. There
are strict federal regulations regarding the observation of whales, and fines
of as much as $20,000 for violating them. Although the humpback has been a
protected animal since 1966, its numbers have continued to drop until today
there are only an estimated 1,000 to 1,500 left in the Pacific. Some think one
reason for the decline is human-generated activity, such as the buzz of a
boat's motor around their breeding grounds, which interferes with mating.
Since females give birth to a single calf only once every two years, it's not
hard to appreciate how perilously close to extinction the humpback is.;  
Because of these concerns, naturalists are encouraging people to watch whales
from the shore. Shore-spotting is excellent on Maui, from Kaanapali to Maalaea
Bay on West Maui, and down the coast of East Maui to Makena. There are a
number of high spots where observers can pull off the road to watch them, but
the scenic lookout at McGregor Point, near the town of Maalaea, offers the
best viewing.;   Whales are also visible from Molokai and Lanai, but the best
viewing spots are difficult for tourists to reach. A small group of whales
spends time at Kawaihae Bay, on the northwest side of the Big Island, and,
with a little patience, it's possible to spot them from one of several
elevated places along the coast. There are some winter sightings from Kauai's
south coast, but April and May are the better months, when great numbers pass
offshore on their trek back north.;   Big ones at play;   Any high spot along
Poipu, especially Makahuena and Nukumoi points, is likely to reward a patient
observer with the sight of a group of two or three humpbacks swimming along
the surface at a good clip. If they're not cavorting around, there's plenty of
spray coming from their blowholes to track them by. Kauai Sea Sports
(808-742-9303) offers motorized raft whale-watch tours during winter months
from Poipu's Kukuiula Harbor. On Oahu, whales are occasionally spotted from
lookouts between Diamond Head and Makapuu.;   There's no great trick to
successful shore-spotting, but a few tips should help first-timers. First, use
elevated ground for your observation point. Go early in the morning or late in
the afternoon. By midday, the wind is stronger and churns up the water, making
it more difficult to spot the whales, but a few hours before sunset (between 6
and 7 p.m.), the whales tend to come closer to shore, sometimes as near as 50
feet. Finally, be patient. Scan the horizon till you see what looks like an
explosion of smoke about 18 feet high. That's the blow of the humpback. If you
have binoculars, by all means, take them along. They're especially good for
spotting the light blow of a calf. When a humpback lifts its head out of the
water, an activity dubbed "spy hopping" since its eyes are just above the
surface, it's just playing around. But when it lifts its tail straight up out
of the water (called a fluke-up dive), it's going under for a prolonged dive
and won't surface again for another 20 minutes or so.;   To help
whale-watchers bone up on humpbacks, the Pacific Whale Foundation gives a
number of lectures at hotels and condominiums around Maui. (Call 808-879-8811
for a schedule of upcoming lectures.) It's also possible to catch two films on
whales at the Carthaginian, a boat-cum-whaling museum anchored at Lahaina
Harbor (Maui). And at the Whale Report Center, on the dock next to the
Carthaginian, there's updated news on where whales have been sighted most
recently. Also worth a visit is the Whalers Village Whale Museum at Kaanapali
(Maui), the Pacific Whale Museum at Oahu's Sea Life Park, Honolulu's Bishop
Museum, and the Hawaii Maritime Center adjacent to Aloha Tower in downtown
Honolulu, all of which feature excellent displays on the great whales and
artifacts of the hunt. If you come away as fascinated by these creatures as
most people do, treat yourself to Richard Ellis' beautiful and comprehensive
work, "The Book of Whales" (Knopf, $25) or Bob Goodman's interesting book,
"Whale Song."; If you go . . .; TO HELP whale-watchers bone up on humpbacks,
