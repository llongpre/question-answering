   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel rejected
Thursday the idea of an international Mideast peace conference, and
he vowed to ask Washington about reports it is backing the idea at
the United Nations.
   Shamir labeled as ``rumors'' the reports that the United States
will ask the U.N. Security Council to consider convening the peace
conference.
   In a speech at a Joint Israel Appeal fundraising dinner, Shamir
also reassured Israel's supporters that the country is ready to
deal with threats by Iraq's leader. Saddam Hussein has said Israel
would be the first target in any Persian Gulf conflict.
   ``Saddam Hussein must surely know that if he resorts to violent
action against Israel, he will pay dearly for such action,'' Shamir
said.
   ``The days when people could attack defenseless Jews with
impunity are over. This is what Israel is all about.''
   About 6 million Jews were killed in the Nazi Holocaust.
   The Israeli leader, who is on nine-day trip to Britain and the
United States, noted that his country is not part of the
multinational force opposing Iraq in the gulf.
   ``But by our very presence in that area - thanks to our
steadfastness and capacity - we have been, and continue to be, a
force for stability, a barrier that has prevented many military
adventures and muand in a civil clomplaint charged Cartisano and his
Challenger V Foundation with violation of five Hawaii laws.
   The complaint said Challenger V violates child welfare licensing
laws, compulsory school attendance laws, operates without a
business license and is avoiding state taxes, is an unlicensed
practice of psychology and has engaged in unfair and deceptive
trade practices.
   Tom Farrell, Hawaii's assistant attorney general, said he
believed Cartisano was with the teen-agers either near Kona on
Hawaii Island or floating in the seas.
   Repeated telephone messages left with Challenger V's answering
service in Honolulu were not returned.
   Cartisano's wife, Debbie, said Wednesday her husband is in
Guadalajara, Mexico, where he is attempting to set up another
wilderness therapy program. She said she had no way of contacting
him.
   The Utah program, founded in 1988 by Stephen Cartisano, sought
Chapter 11 protection this summer. State officials say it owed more
than $279,000 in federal and state taxes. A creditors' hearing
showed the program owed more than $1.1 million and had assets of
about $260,000; the program claimed assets of $63,000.
   Cartisano, 33, and his company are awaiting trial in May on
charges of negligent homicide and child abuse in connection with
the hiking death June 27 of Kristen Chase. Athorities closed down
the program in August.
   An offshoot of a popular wildrness program offered at Brigham
Young University in the 1970s, Cartisano claimed therapeutic value
in forcing unruly teen-agers to cope and succeed in an unforgiving
environment.
   In Utah, Challenger charged $16,000 for the 63-day program,
which many parents swore by, including the mother of the dead
teen-ager.
   Mrs. Cartisano accused Hawaii officials of pursuing a vendetta
passed on by Utah officials.
   ``They called over here with all that gossip,'' she said.
   She said company attorneys told them that Challenger V is
operating legally. She declined to name the lawyers.
   ``Those people (in Hawaii) haven't had any complaints,'' she
said. ``There's no reason to be doing these things.''
