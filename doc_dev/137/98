   Suspicion has focused on terrorist sabotage as the cause of
Wednesday's Pan Am jetliner crash in Scotland. Here is a look at
five air disasters involving bombs over the past 12 years:

   Korean Air Flight 858 disappears over the jungle near the
Thailand-Burma border. All 115 people aboard the Boeing 707 are
killed.
   Suspicion about a planted bomb focused on two passengers, a man
and woman, detained after they were questioned about forged Japanese
passports and bit into cyanide capsules hidden in cigarette filters.
The couple had left the KAL flight, which was bound from Baghdad to
Bangkok, in Abu Dhabi, one stop before it disappeared. The man
succeeded in his suicide attempt, but the woman survived.
   South Korean officials believe the couple left bags on the plane
that contained a bomb, and suggested they were North Korean agents
who blew up the plane as part of a long-range scheme to disrupt the
1988 Seoul Summer Olympics. North Korea called the accusation
``silly and far-fetched.''

   Four Americans are killed when a bomb under a seat explodes on
Trans World Airlines Flight 840 from Rome to Athens. Nine other
passengers are injured.
   The Boeing 727 was beginning its descent into Athens when the
bomb blew a gaping hole in the fuselage. Two women, a mother and
daughter, and the daughter's baby were killed when they were sucked
from the plane and plummeted to the ground. The fourth victim, also
found on the ground, was killed instantly when the bomb exploded
under his seat.
   Authorities speculated that the terrorist who set the charge may
have been confused by Italy's recent shift to daylight-saving time.
Had the bomb gone off an hour earlier _ before the jet began its
descent _ the massive decompression of the fuselage would have
caused a crash killing all 122 people aboard.
   Police said the explosive device was left under the seat by a
woman carrying a Lebanese passport under the name Mei Mansour who
sat in the seat earlier, when the plane was westbound. Mansour later
appeared in Beirut and denied responsibility.

   Air-India Flight 182 blows apart off the coast of Ireland,
killing all 329 people aboard. The Boeing 747 was on its way from
Toronto to Bombay, via London.
   An inquiry by the Indian government concluded that a bomb caused
the crash.
   Canadian authorities said a man checked a suitcase onto the plane
but did not board. In another incident the same day, Canadian
officials say, Sikh militants planted a suitcase bomb on a Canadian
jetliner in Vancouver. The bag exploded while being transferred to
an Air-India flight at the Tokyo airport, killing two baggage
handlers.
   Despite circumstantial evidence, police have been unable to prove
their contention that extremist Sikhs based in British Columbia
planted the bombs to retaliate for the storming of a Sikh shrine in
India by government troops. Anonymous callers claimed responsibility
for the crash on behalf of Sikh groups.

   A 16-year-old Japanese boy is killed by a bomb that explodes
aboard a Pan Am jetliner bound from Tokyo to Hawaii. Fifteen other
passengers, including the boy's parents, are injured.
   The plane, carrying 285 people, landed safely despite the
explosion, which occurred about 140 miles out from Hawaii. No
individual or group claimed responsibility for the explosion.
   In May 1988, a Palestinian, Mohammed Rashid, was arrested at
Athens airport, on a tip from the U.S. Embassy in the Greek capital,
and charged with planting the bomb aboard the trans-Pacific
airliner. American officials have said Rashid also was involved in
the 1986 TWA bombing.
   His extradition to the United States remains under consideration.

   A Cubana Airlines DC8 crashes into the sea minutes after taking
off from Seawell Airport in Barbados, killing 73 people, including
24 members of the Cuban national fencing team.
   Nine minutes after takeoff, the pilot contacted the control
tower: ``Seawell, Seawell, C0455. We have an explosion on board.
We're descending fast. ... We have fire on board. ... Request
immediate landing permission.'' Another explosion went off and the
pilot was heard shouting, ``Shut the door!'' The plane hit the ocean
several miles offshore.
   Four Cuban exiles living in Venezuela were charged with the
bombing. Two were convicted, one escaped, and a fourth, anti-Castro
radical Orlando Bosch, spent 11 years in Venezuelan prisons while
fighting the charges, was never convicted, and finally was released
and returned to the United States last February.
