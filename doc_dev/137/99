<TEXT>     Sure, there are spots where Hawaii is like it used to be, back before folks
started building $200-a-night mega-resorts, with everything from lake-size
swimming pools to several million bucks' worth of artworks stashed around the
joint.;    The best example of the calm and quiet old days was probably Lanai,
the Pineapple Island, which lies just across the Kalohi Channel from Molokai.
Now, they want to call it the Resort Island.;    For most of this century,
Lanai was the home of the Dole pineapple groves. But the company that bought
Dole out, Castle and Cook, decided last year that pineapple profits were too
low, so it decided to plow under all the groves and stick in two or three
swanky resorts for folks who can plop down $300 or $400 a night to escape the
world.;    And that leaves Molokai. (Well, there is the privately owned
Niihau, west of Oahu. Its old-fashioned ways are perhaps safe -- for the
moment. But since us tourists aren't allowed there anyway, it doesn't count.);
   This is not to say that Molokai is living in the 19th century, because it's
not. And some parts are as overrun with tourists as the other islands. But on
the whole, Molokai remains what it has traditionally been: a farming island.; 
  It is part of Maui County, a fact not totally popular with Molokai
residents. They like their island the way it is -- small, friendly and quiet
-- and think by getting home rule for Molokai they can stop the huge
developments that have overtaken the rest of the state.;    Molokai is at once
one of the most beautiful and also one of the least attractive of the islands.
The north coast has some of the most dramatic cliffs in the world -- they are
in fact the highest sea cliffs in the world, rising about 4,000 feet from the
ocean.;    The north coast is also the location of the Kalaupapa Peninsula,
the famous leper colony, now a national historic park. Kalaupapa is the target
for the famous Molokai mule rides that wend their way from the spine of the
island to the isolated park.;    But on the west, the island is a near-desert,
and to the south, where most of the population is, the beaches are mostly
muddy and the land is basically flat.;    The east is a series of wide spots
in the road with volcanic slopes rising to the middle of the island, but it is
the site of the beautiful Halawa Valley. On the whole, most of the island is
about as exciting as a crossroads town in Nebraska.;    So why go there at
all?;    Because it is Molokai. Because it is quiet. Because, in fact, there
are things to do like hike and lie in the sun or play golf -- without being
assaulted by a million tourists. There are places to hike up into the
mountains, places where you can swim in a pool formed by a towering waterfall
-- and places where you can let giraffes nibble food off your stomach -- we
kid you not.;    Not for first-timers;  But generally, the way it is today,
unless you're heading for Kalaupapa, either by air or by mule, Molokai is
probably not a good choice for first-time visitors to Hawaii because there
really is little of what folks expect when they go to the islands: high-speed
luaus and dancing, mai tais and Don Ho. Sun, fun, romance.;    One of the
major targets for many visitors who plan to stay on the island is the Kaluakoi
Hotel and Golf Club, a Colony resort set on the island's west coast, within
easy distance of Papohaku County Park (a very nice beach), plus the resort's
own, smaller beach.;    The Kaluakoi is a self-contained resort and has
various room/meal plans, from a basic double around $100 a night to around
$300 for a two-night double that includes all meals, 18 holes of golf per
person a day and airport transfers. (The airport is about 15 miles east of the
resort.);    The resort is comfortable, with accommodations in blocks of
rooms, many with ocean views. The pace is pretty low-key, like most things on
Molokai. It offers a quiet, remote vacation, with none of the hassles you find
on the more popular islands. If you don't play golf or tennis or enjoy just
lying on a beach, the Kaluakoi is probably not for you. Kids under 10 are
free. Information: (800) 777-1700.;    The big city on Molokai is Kaunakakai,
about 25 miles east of the resort -- it's normally just called "K'Kai." It's
pretty small-town stuff, with a few restaurants and the feel of a place where
time stopped about 1950.;    Among the more famous spots in town is
Kanemitsu's Bakery, an island institution that bakes thousands of loaves of
"Molokai bread" every day. The bread, baked in sort of a round, country-style
loaf, is so popular the bakery usually sells out by noon. It's also a great
breakfast hangout, either for fresh doughnuts or a full meal.;    Down-home
eats;  Another more-or-less famous spot, especially for the locals, is the Mid
Night Inn, a down-home eatery specializing in fish and what owner John
Kikukawa calls "healthy food," meaning less fat and cholesterol. His
philosophy, he says, is to "provide a decent meal for a decent price." And he
does.;    Gourmet it ain't, but the prices, the service and the feeling of
being part of the K'Kai scene make the Mid Night worth a try. It's also a nice
change from the fairly expensive fare served at the Kaluakoi resort's
restaurants.;    Another popular spot is the Hop Inn, specializing in Asian
dishes. The prices are low; so's the food quality. But it is a good place to
meet the locals.;    Near town are a couple of smaller hotel complexes, but as
noted, the beaches on the south side of the island are pretty poor. But the
prices are good and you are close to town. Plus if you golf, the drive out to
the Colony is not that far.;    The Hotel Molokai houses its guests in
"Polynesian-style bungalows," with thatched roofs, private baths and lanais.
Prices start around $55 a night double and there is a pool, restaurant and
bar. Information: (800) 423-6656. Down the road a piece is the Pau Hana Inn,
with doubles starting around $45. Check out the old banyan tree, the open bar
and the sunsets. Reservation information is the same as for the Hotel
Molokai.;    Nature buffs will immediately head to the Halawa Valley at the
east end of the island and climb into the mountains past two big waterfalls
along lush trails filled with birds and green things. (Remember, there are no
snakes in Hawaii.);    Take Highway 45 (the coast road) from K'Kai about 25
miles to a parking lot run by the Puu O Huku Ranch, which owns most of the
valley. The east coast drive, from about 12 miles out of K'Kai to the falls,
is lush, and when you turn the corner to go north, the view is much like the
Pacific Coast Highway.;    At the end of the road there's a security lot, run
by a nice old guy who makes you sign a damage waiver and charges you $5 to
park your car. He also sells snacks and sodas.;    The hike up to the first of
the Moaula Falls (250 feet high) takes about an hour; another 45 minutes gets
you to the upper falls. It's the prettiest accessible scene on the island, and
if it's hot, you can put your bod into the cold pool at the base of the lower
falls. Be sure to ask about the trail before you go because it crosses several
small creeks that can be fairly mean after a rainstorm.;    Another popular
draw on the island is the Molokai Ranch Wildlife Park, owned by the same
company that runs the Colony resort. The ranch, about 52,000 acres, is
populated by small herds of African wildlife, including Barbary sheep, eland,
blackbuck, kudu and oryx. As wildlife parks go, it's pretty small potatoes,
but it does give you a chance to see some exotic critters.;    One of the
stops is a giraffe area, where guides will take volunteers, lie them down on a
bench, pour giraffe chow all over their stomachs and watch while the beasts
gently use their huge tongues to snack. You are guaranteed never to get that
close to a giraffe in Kenya. The tours are started from the Kaluakoi resort
and are $25 for adults and $10 for kids under 10. Information from the resort
or from the ranch, (808) 552-2767.;    If you like your wildlife less
structured, make arrangements to go to the Kamakou Preserve, run by the Nature
Conservancy of Hawaii in the mountains northeast of K'Kai. Inside the
preserve's 2,800 acres are 250 types of Hawaiian plants, including some rare
species that grow only on Molokai. It's basically a rain forest that supplies
an estimated 60 percent of the island's fresh water.;    Camping is not
allowed in the preserve, but there are facilities at the park entrance.
Getting a permit is a long process, however. The best bet is to take a guided
four-wheel-drive tour. Tours can be booked through the Kaluakoi resort, or by
contacting Alex Tour in K'Kai, which runs a 5-hour trip to the preserve for
$30 a person. Warning: it's very cold at the park, so dress accordingly.

96748, (808) 553-3369.;    As for the famous mules, they start on the north
coast and go down a steep trail to the leper colony where you have lunch, take
a tour, then hop aboard your steed for the trip back up. The price is $93.60
per person and the trip takes about eight hours, starting at 8:30 a.m. There
is an age restriction (16 and over), and a weight restriction (under 225
pounds). Information: (800) 843-5978.;     If you go . . .; (check) Getting
There; There are no direct flights from the mainland to Molokai. However,
Hawaiian Airlines, (800) 367-5320, and Aloha Island Air, (800) 367-5250, fly
to Molokai from the other Hawaiian islands. Panorama Air, (800) 367-2671,
flies to Molokai from Oahu.;    The Maui Princess ferry makes daily excursions
to Molokai from Lahaina Harbor on Maui. The trip takes about an hour and 45
minutes. On Maui, call (808) 661-8397 for current schedules and prices.;   
(check) GETTING AROUND -- Avis, Budget, Dollar and Tropical all have cars for
rent at the Molokai airport. Tropical, as an example, rents small compacts for
$29 a day, unlimited mileage. Gasoline on Molokai will probably be 10 to 20
cents more a gallon than on the mainland. Air fare to the island from Honolulu
is about $125 round trip.;    (check) INFORMATION -- Destination Molokai
Association, P.O. Box 960, Kaunakakai 96748; (808) 553-3876, or in Honolulu,
