   Six of the 10 richest people in the world are
Japanese but the United States still leads the world in the total
number of billionaires, according to estimates compiled by Forbes
magazine.
   For the third year running, Yoshiaki Tsutsumi led Forbes' list of
private billionaires even though his wealth wasn't quite as much as
it had been 12 months earlier.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal net
worth of at least $15 billion, over $3 billion less than estimated
last summer due mainly to a rise in the dollar against other major
currencies, Forbes said Sunday.
   The estimate was far greater than that made by Fortune magazine
in its September 1988 ranking of those it considered the world's
richest people _ which valued Tsutsumi's holdings at a mere $2.8
billion.
   In last year's list, Forbes estimated Tsutsumi's net worth was
$18.9 billion.
   The magazine reports in its July 24 issue that Tsutsumi edged out
second-ranked Taikichiro Mori by less than $1 billion.
   Mori, a former economics professor who owns 72 office buildings
in Tokyo, has an estimated net worth of $14.2 billion. In last
year's survey, Forbes placed Mori's worth at about $18 billion.
   The third-richest on the list was American Sam Moore Walton,
founder of the third largest retailer in the United States, Wal-Mart
Stores Inc. Walton and his family are worth an estimated $8.7
billion, up from Forbes' 1988 estimate of $6.5 billion.
   After the Waltons came Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of the
Olympia &amp; York real estate empire, with a combined net worth of
about $8 billion.
   The rest of the 10 richest people in the world, their country and
industries, according to Forbes, were: Shin Kyuk-ho, South Korea,
candy, real estate; Hirotomo Takei and family, Japan, publishing,
real estate; Kitaro Watanabe, Japan, real estate, hotels; Haruhiko
Yoshimoto and family, Japan, real estate; Hans and Gad Rausing,
Sweden, liquids packaging; and Eitaro Itoyama, Japan, land.
   Forbes said it identified 226 individuals or families around the
world with personal assets worth over $1 billion.
   The United States was the country with the most billionaires,
with 55 individuals qualifying for that title. Japan ranked second,
with 41, and West Germany was third with 20.
   American also accounted for the most billionaires in the 1988
survey, with 47 individuals, followed by Japan's 32 and West
Germany's 16.
   Among the richest of the world's rich were people who didn't
necessarily come by their money in an honest way.
   Colombia's cocaine barons, for instance, are still putting away
piles of money from selling the illegal drug even though profit
margins in the cocaine trade have been shrinking during recent years.
   Three of them made Forbes ``World Billionaires'' list including
Pablo Escobar Gaviria, leader of the notorious Medellin cocaine
cartel, with an estimated personal net worth of $3 billion. The
other cocaine kingpins on the list were the Ochoa family, worth more
than $2 billion, and Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, with more than $1
billion.
   In compiling its list, Forbes does not consider royal families
and heads of state in compiling its list of wealthy people and
individuals ``because their wealth derives more from political
heritage than from economic effort _ theirs are feudal fortunes, not
capitalistic ones.''
   The magazine also excludes dictators, such as Cuba's Fidel Castro
or North Korea's Kim Il Sung.
