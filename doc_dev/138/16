<LEADPARA>  Sure the recession hurt some of America's wealthiest people. But most kept
getting richer.;   Entertainment mogul John Werner Kluge is worth more than
any other American for the third straight year. But computer whiz Bill Gates
is closing the gap, Forbes magazine said in its 10th annual ranking of the
richest.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The net worth of the 400 wealthiest Americans hit $288 billion -- the
highest ever recorded by Forbes. The list appears in the magazine's Oct. 21
issue.;   The recession made ex-moguls of some, mostly in real estate, where
values have dropped and vacancies skyrocketed, Forbes said in a report
released Sunday. A record 71 billionaires populate the list, up from 66 last
year and 13 in the magazine's first ranking in 1982.;   Fifty-eight of the 400
are women. The list's average age is 64.;   Amid the recession, Forbes
undertook something of an apology for wealth in America. The magazine, which
describes itself as a "capitalist tool," said in an essay that the rich are
having a tough time, too.;   "Since 1989 the economy has slowed -- for blacks,
for whites, for rich, for poor," Forbes said. "The median net worth of the
Forbes 400 has stagnated since 1989, not even keeping pace with inflation.";  
Forbes found that the fortune of Kluge, a 77-year-old German immigrant who
founded Metromedia Co., keeps growing. At an estimated $5.9 billion, it's up
$300 million from last year.;   No. 2 is William Henry Gates III, 35, a
Harvard dropout who in 1975 formed Microsoft, now the biggest computer
software maker. The bulk of his estimated worth of $4.8 billion comes from
company stock, Forbes said. Last year, he ranked 16th with $2.5 billion.;  
Gates replaces Warren Buffett, the Nebraska investor tapped to clean up
scandal-tainted Salomon Inc. Buffett's estimated stock-market fortune grew to
$4.2 billion from $3.3 billion, but he slipped to eighth on the list.;   Ahead
of him are Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Sam Moore Walton and his family.
Walton divided his wealth equally among himself and his four children. Each is
estimated to be worth $4.4 billion.;   Next are industrialist Henry Lea
Hillman, $3.3 billion; Amway Corp. partners Richard Marvin DeVos and Jay Van
Andel, $2.9 billion each; and publishing brothers Samuel Newhouse Jr. and
Donald Newhouse, $2.8 billion apiece.;   The magazine said financier Michael
Milken's criminal guilty plea didn't erase his junk-bond driven fortune. He's
"making about 30 cents an hour at prison labor, to add to net worth estimated
over $700 million," Forbes said.;   Forbes said it bases the rankings on
inheritances, stock ownership and conservative estimates for private companies.  </TEXT>
