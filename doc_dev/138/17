   President Reagan's latest nominee for a seat
on the Federal Reserve Board has been accused of attempting to
dodge taxes in negotiating a $2.5-million ``golden parachute''
compensation agreement with the Boston bank holding company he
heads.
   John P. LaWare, chairman of Shawmut National Corp., said
Thursday he was not sure a tax dodge was involved in the agreement,
which he said was offered to assure him his $500,000 annual income
until he reaches age 65. He turned 60 on Feb. 20.
   Despite concern expressed by Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, there was no indication
the issue would affect LaWare's nomination.

   Retail sales rose between 3.5 percent and 4 percent in June,
helped by the hot weather and consumer purchases of summer
clothing, retailers have reported. For the year, sales were up 2.5
percent.
   Industry analysts remained cautious, however, about the outlook
for consumer spending. Some said the drought in the Midwest could
affect July sales.
   June sales also were aided by the markdowns retailers continued
to take to clear their inventories, the nation's largest retailers
reported Thursday.

   Control Data Corp. says it will
convert its disk drive operations into a separate subsidiary, a
possible prelude to a sale or partnership for the billion-dollar
unit.
   Analysts said the reorganization would make it possible for
Control Data to attract a joint-venture partner or a buyer for the
unit, which accounted for nearly $1 billion of the company's $3
billion in revenue last year.
   Disk drives are devices used for storing and retrieving
computerized information at high speed.

   Agriculture Secretary Richard E. Lyng, after
meeting with six farm-state governors, says there is an urgent need
for legislative action to provide drought relief.
   Lyng earlier had commented that Congress should hold off on a
relief package until the extent of the drought damage is known.
   Bill-drafting sessions could start as early as next week in both
the House and Senate Agriculture committees. Lyng said that
President Reagan might sign relief legislation if it is a measure
``that is reasonable and compassionate and will help farmers.''
