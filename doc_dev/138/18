   Last October's stock-market crash took its toll on U.S. fortunes, according to Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the 400 richest Americans. 

   Although Sam M. Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., remains the richest person in the U.S., the crash lopped off 31% of his fortune -- it fell to $5.9 billion from $8.5 billion. 
By August, Mr. Walton's fortune was back up to $6.7 billion, more than double that of second-ranked John Werner Kluge, principal owner of Metromedia Co. 

   Three others in the top 10 of last year's Forbes 400 watched their fortunes drop 32% to 50% in the week after the crash. 
Rupert Murdoch, the media magnate, who saw a 48% loss, to $1.1 billion from $2.1 billion, in the week after the crash, fell to 35th place from eighth with a net worth of $1.08 billion. 
Hewlett-Packard Co. Chairman David Packard, who had a 32% drop, to $1.9 billion from $2.87 billion after the crash, fell nine spots in the ranking to 13th with a fortune of $2 billion. 
Limited Inc. Chairman Leslie Wexner, who saw a 50% drop to $1.05 billion from $2.1 billion after the crash, fell to 49th place from 10th with $1 billion. 

   Of the 52 who dropped off the "Forbes 400" list, 22 fell because their stocks declined. 

   Although tops in the U.S., Mr. Walton is the sixth-richest person in the world. 
Above him on the list are three Japanese, a Korean and a Canadian.
