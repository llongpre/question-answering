   If you wondered why oil is worth fighting for,
take a look at Fortune magazine's latest ranking of the world's
billionaires.
   The two richest people on the face of the earth are oil barons,
the magazine reported Tuesday.
   Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah, oil-rich leader of the tiny
Pacific sultanate of Brunei, retained Fortune's top title for the
fourth straight year with an estimated worth of $25 billion,
unchanged from 1989.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd and clan, a focus of the Persian Gulf
crisis, ranked second with assets worth $18 billion, also unchanged
from last year.
   Fortune spokeswoman Emma Dockendorff said those estimates were
based partly on oil prices in mid-July, when one barrel of crude
fetched about $18.
   Prices have since surged to about $28 a barrel following Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the U.S. move to protect neighboring
Saudi Arabia. That price jump would make the sultan and the king
potentially even wealthier.
   The ranks of Fortune's richest _ bankrolled by assets ranging
from oil to sneakers to ball bearings _ swelled by 25 names this
year to 182 individuals and families, controlling a combined empire
worth $471.3 billion.
   That's up about 7 percent from last year and enough to erase the
U.S. budget deficit, trade deficit and a good chunk of the savings
&amp; loan bailout tab.
   Fortune released the fourth annual ranking in its Sept. 10
issue. It said the average entrant's wealth was only slightly
higher compared with last year after adjusting for inflation.
   But the average fortune was still worth about $2.6 billion,
which if invested in 7.5 percent U.S. Treasury bills would earn
$534,000 a day.
   ``True, you shouldn't feel too sorry for folks who have their
own islands and castles, use Reniors for wallpaper and control, in
the aggregate, $471.3 billion,'' Fortune said.
   As competitor Forbes magazine did in its annual list released
last month, Fortune ditched the Sultan of New York, Donald J.
Trump, whose real estate and casino empire is bogged down in debt.
The magazine had estimated his holdings at $1.7 billion last year.
   Fortune placed Trump in a separate category of fallen tycoons,
who also included troubled takeover strategist James Goldsmith and
convicted financier Michael Milken.
   Ranked third on Fortune's list was the reclusive Mars family of
the United States, whose holdings include Mars Inc. candy bars,
Uncle Ben's Rice and Kal-Kan pet food, worth $12.5 billion.
   Fourth was Britain's Queen Elizabeth II, the wealthiest woman,
with an untaxed personal fortune of $11.7 billion in riches ranging
from 267,000 acres of Royal real estate to racehorses, crown jewels
and a vast stock portfolio.
   Fifth was the Newhouse family of the United States, owners of a
large media empire, worth $11.5 billion; sixth was the Reichmann
family of Canada, with extensive real estate holdings valued at
$11.1 billion; tied for seventh were Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, Japan's
richest industrialist, and Arkansas retailing mogul Sam Walton,
both valued at $7.3 billion; eighth was John W. Kluge of the United
States, owner of media giant Metromedia Inc., valued at $7.0
billion; ninth was Tsai Wan-lin and family of Taiwan, owners of a
construction and insurance empire worth $6.5 billion; 10th was the
Thomson family, owners of Canada's biggest newspaper chain, at $6.2
billion.
   American newcomers included the Stephens family of Arkansas,
owners of investment banking, energy and real estate holdings worth
$1.7 billion; the Parfet family of Kalamazoo, Mich., owners of a
large stake in the Upjohn Co. drugmaker, worth $1.5 billion; and
Philip Knight, head of the Nike Inc. athletic footwear maker, $1.3
billion.
   Foreign newcomers included Alicia and Esther Koplovitz of Spain,
owners of a $2.2 billion construction and banking fortune; Hiroshi
Termachi, owner of a $1.8 billion Japanese ball bearing business;
and John Spyros Latsis, European head of a Saudi Arabian shipping
and oil-refinery network worth $1.8 billion.
   The magazine based estimates of net worth on what it called
``published information or appraisals of asset values.'' To
qualify, each prospect needed a net worth of $1 billion or more
after subtracting debt.
   Fortune said the United States remained home to the greatest
number of billionaires at 58. Twenty were from the Persian Gulf, 15
from West Germany, nine from Italy, and eight in Japan, down from
12 last year.
