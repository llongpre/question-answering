   Queen Elizabeth II, whose personal fortune is a
closely guarded secret, is Britain's richest person worth an
estimated $5.87 billion, according to a list of the nation's 200
richest people.
   The list was front-page news in London on Thursday, with racy
tabloid headlines ranging from ``Filthy Rich'' in the Sun to
``Millionaires Galore'' in the Daily Mail.
   Money Magazine, which complied the list, said the
second-wealthiest Briton as 92-year-old Sir John Moores, founder of
the Littlewoods soccer pools empire, a weekly game for small-time
gamblers based on soccer results. It estimated his fortune at $2.99
billion.
   It listed the third-wealthiest Briton as supermarket chain owner
Garfield Weston, 60, chairman of Associated British Foods, with an
estimated personal fortune at $2.64 billion.
   In fourth place is the 36-year-old Duke of Westminster. His
inherited holdings include large chunks of highly desireable real
estate in central London, huge tracts of farmland and sweeping
acres of remote northern moorland. The magazine said his personal
fortune was about $2.46 billion.
   Money Magazine says Britain has seven billionaires, 18 families
and individuals worth more than $440 million each, and 20,000
millionaires as measured in pounds.
   The magazine's estimate of the 61-year-old queen's wealth makes
her the world's eighth-richest individual. It said the world's
richest person is the Sultan of Brunei, with an estimated fortune
equivalent to $24.64 billion.
   The Guinness Book of Records lists the richest person in the
United States as Sam Moore Walton, founder of Wal-Mart discount
stores in Bentonville, Ark., whose personal wealth was estimated in
mid-1987 at $4.5 billion ``and rising.''
   Money Magazine said financier Sir James Goldsmith _ fifth in its
list of Britain's wealthiest 200 with an estimated $1.76 billion _
was the only British billionaire to have made all his money since
the end of World War II in 1945.
   The youngest person in the top 200 is 31-year-old Sophie Mirman,
with an estimated $52.8 million. She and her husband, Richard Ross,
created the popular Sock Shop chain.
   Among the 12 women in the top 200 list are ``Dynasty'' star Joan
Collins and her sister, Jackie Collins, the author of a string of
best-selling raunchy novels. It said they are worth an estimated
$26.4 million between them.
   Editor Sue Thomas said it took six months to compile the list,
``consulting public sources of information and talking extensively
to analysts in the City,'' London's financial district.
   ``The people we did not talk to were the 200 themselves because
we wanted to keep the list under wraps until the last possible
minute. Many of the super-rich are very secretive,'' she said.
   Asked how it estimated the queen's wealth in view of the secrecy
maintained by her London bankers, Coutts and Co., Mrs. Thomas said:
``We found out as much as we could about the different headings
under which her wealth falls _ her castles and other properties,
her land holdings, her vast share portfolio, her stamp collection,
her art collection, her jewelry collection and so forth and we
talked to a lot of people with information.
   ``We arrived at what we estimate to be a minimum net worth for
all the people on our list.''
   It said 53 of the 200 fortunes stemmed from property. Five
percent of those listed came from abroad and only 15 percent belong
to the British aristocracy. The self-made rich outnumbered those
who inherited their wealth by 2-1.
