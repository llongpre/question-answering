It will take a lot more than the collapse of the Japanese stock market to
knock Japan's Taikichiro Mori off his perch as the world's wealthiest
person.
Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the world's billionaires shows that
despite falling property prices the 88-year-old Japanese real estate tycoon
still boasted a personal fortune of Dollars 13bn. Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, 58, a
railway and golf course tycoon, remains the second richest with a Dollars
10bn fortune arising from a 40 per cent stake in the family-run company,
Kokudo.
By contrast, Bill Gates, the 36-year-old Harvard dropout and founder of
Microsoft, may be the richest American, but he is only worth Dollars 6.4bn.
But despite Japan's pole position, the US tops the list with 101 individuals
or families out of 291 worth Dollars 1bn or more. Germany is second with 44
billionaire fortunes and Japan comes in third with 34. For the first time,
Richard Branson joins the billionaires list; Forbes says he is worth about
Dollars 1.2bn.
But it is Latin America which has unearthed a surge of capitalist energy; up
from eight to 21 billionaires this year.
