   The past year yielded a bumper crop of billionaires, according to Forbes magazine's annual ranking of the 400 richest Americans. 

   The number of billionaires on the Forbes list nearly doubled over the last year to 49, an increase of 23 from 1986. 
The magazine credited the rising stock and real estate markets for the swelling ranks of billionaires. 

   The richest person on the list remains Sam M. Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores, whose net worth was estimated at $8.5 billion. 

   Among the new billionaires were candy heiress Jacqueline Mars Vogel, brewer August A. Busch Jr., media magnate Rupert Murdoch, Microsoft Corp. Chairman William H. Gates, CBS Inc. Chairman Laurence Tisch, and Ted Arison, who took Carnival Cruise Lines Inc. public this year. 

   Some multimillionaires lost their slots on the Forbes list. 
Rock 'n' roll's Dick Clark and "Dynasty" producer Aaron Spelling slipped from the list because their newly public companies took downturns. 
Motown's Berry Gordy, Apple Computer Inc. founder Steven Jobs and oilman Armand Hammer were replaced by people with larger fortunes. 

   Another name missing from the list: Ivan Boesky, the Wall Street arbitrager who admitted insider-trading violations.
