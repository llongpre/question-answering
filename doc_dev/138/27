   An attorney for Sam Walton, the nation's
richest man and chairman of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., on Tuesday sought
to repeal an $11.5 million fine against his client in connection
with a personal injury suit.
   The motion filed in 352nd District Court argues that the
sanctions violated a stay issued by the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals
and Walton's constitutional rights of appeal.
   ``This unreasonable ruling must be reversed. When a judge enters
an order so patently wrong, the party suffereing the abuse should be
vindicated at the very first opportunity,'' attorney Vic Anderson
said in the motion.
   The issue surfaced this summer when Walton was asked to give a
deposition in a lawsuit filed by Andrew Carrizales of Houston
against Wal-Mart and manager Jerry Rand. Carrizales claims that
while shopping at the company's Sulphur Springs store in 1986 he
slipped and fell on clear oil spilled on the floor.
   When Walton failed to provide testimony, former 352nd District
Court Judge John Street ordered him to appear in Fort Worth for a
deposition. But the Texas Supreme Court said Street's ruling was a
clear abuse of discretion.
   Street modified his order and required Walton to submit to a
videotape deposition at the company's headquarters in Bentonville,
Ark. Walton refused and Street imposed sanctions against him for
violating the modified order.
   Fines began at $10,000 on Nov. 28 and reached $1.28 million
before dropping back to $1 million a day. Walton eventually showed
up for a deposition in Fort Worth on Dec. 15.
   However, Anderson says the 2nd Court of Appeals in Fort Worth
granted a stay of Street's order five days after it was issued Nov.
18. The stay dissolved on Dec. 12 and Walton showed up two days
later.
   Walton is currently listed as the nation's richest man by Forbes
magazine, with a net worth of about $6.7 billion.
