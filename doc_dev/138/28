   Wal-Mart Stores founder Sam Walton and family
remained the wealthiest people in the United States last year even
though the value of their stock lost more than $135 million, U.S.
News &amp; World Report says.
   The Waltons of Bentonville, Ark., whose stores are fixtures in
small-town America, held $6.13 billion worth of stock in Wal-Mart,
keeping them atop the magazine's Richest 100 list for the third
straight time since the rankings began three years ago, U.S. News
said in its Aug. 1 editions.
   To make the list, an individual or family must own at least 5
percent of the shares of a publicly traded company. This is the
level the government considers large enough to influence management.
   In second spot again were Irenee and Edward du Pont and family
of Wilmington, Del., with $3.38 billion worth of the giant chemical
firm. U.S. News said the du Ponts kept the ranking despite a $1.3
billion loss in stock value in the 12 months ending in Marchy.
   David Packard, the computer pioneer from Los Altos Hills,
Calif., jumped from seventh spot in 1987 to third this year, with
$2.56 billion worth of holdings in Hewlett-Packard Co.
   No. 4 in the latest list were Carl Lindner and family of
Cincinnati, with $2.3 billion worth of holdings in food, financial
services, retailing and electronics firms. The Lindners were not in
the Top 10 last year.
   In fifth spot, up one from 1987, were John Dorrance Jr. and
family of Gladwyne, Pa., with $2.05 billion worth of the Campbell
Soup Co.
   Others in the Top 10 were Edgar and Charles Bronfman and family
of New York and Montreal, Seagram Co. Ltd., $1.88 billion; Sid,
Lee, Robert and Edward Bass of Ft. Worth, Texas, a variety of
holdings, $1.75 billion; Warren Buffett of Omaha, Neb., Berkshire
Hathaway, $1.64 billion; William Ford and family of Grosse Point
Shores, Mich., Ford Motor Co., $1.62 billion; and the Bancroft
family of New York, Dow Jones &amp; Co., $1.61 billion.
   U.S. News said the Bancrofts fell from third position in 1987
because of a $1.19 billion loss in stock value last year. It said
other stock-value losses included $859 million for the Bronfmans,
$510 million for the Dorrances and $320 million for the Lindners.
   U.S. News said the year's biggest money loser was Leslie Wexner
of Columbus Ohio, whose holdings in The Limited clothing stores
fell in value by $1.4 billion, or nearly 55 percent. Wexner was
ranked 17th among 18 billionaires on the list.
