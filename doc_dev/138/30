   The legion of American billionaires has grown to
51 people, despite the 1987 stock market crash that realigned the
fortunes of many of the nation's wealthiest.
   Forbes magazine says its annual survey shows the net worth of
the ultra-affluent totaled $84.8 billion _ nearly $5 billion more
than the combined wealth of last year's 49 billionaires.
   The 349 others in Forbes' list of the 400 richest Americans were
worth about $135.2 billion.The average fortune is $551 million, up
$1 million from last year.
   Topping the list released Monday is 70-year-old Sam Walton, who
held the No. 1 spot for the fourth straight year even though his
net worth shrank by $2 billion following the Oct. 19 stock market
crash.
   But Walton, head of the Arkansas-based Wal-Mart discount store
empire, scoffs at his $6.7 billion fortune, calling it ``just paper
_ all I own is a pickup truck and a little Wal-Mart stock.''

   Iranians involved in the Iran-Contra affair
thought George Bush was the ``most powerful man in the world'' and
the person pulling the strings from behind the scenes, according to
a new book.
   The book is written by Michael A. Ledeen, a former consultant to
the National Security Council who played a role in the earliest
stages of the affair. He says the Iranians overestimated Bush's
importance because the vice president was a former director of the
CIA, which they considered to be the root of ultimate power in the
United States.
   Ledeen says his book is an attempt to shed light on how the
Iran-Contra affair happened and ``set the record straight about
myself and my role in the affair.''
   ``Perilous Statecraft: An Insider's Account of the Iran-Contra
Affair'' is published by Charles Scribner's Sons. The book mixes
Ledeen's firsthand view of certain events, his opinions and his
interpretation of material that was uncovered during congressional
hearings in the summer of 1987.

   Texas Democrats watched in dismay the past
several weeks as Republican presidential nominee George Bush
pounded rival Michael Dukakis on gun control, crime and the Pledge
of Allegiance.
   But in the wake of vice presidential nominee and Texas Sen.
Lloyd Bentsen's debate success, Democrats say the Lone Star state _
and its third largest Election Day prize of 29 electoral votes _
once again is up for grabs.
   ``I was kind of down in the dumps a couple of weeks ago. We were
pinned down on the beach for a while. But now we're getting air
support and we're going to drive those folks back,'' said Ed
Martin, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party.
   Hours after last week's vice presidential debate, Dukakis and
Bentsen campaigned in East Texas while the Democratic ticket
unleashed new ads rebutting Bush's claim that Dukakis is soft on
crime.

   Hobbled by an independent challenge that
has siphoned off some of his conservative support, Republican Gov.
Norm Bangerter is a distinct underdog in his bid for a second term.
   Democrat Ted Wilson holds a double-digit lead in the polls, and
independent Merrill Cook commands the loyality of Republicans who
blame the governor for the biggest tax increase in Utah history.
   However, Bangerter and his supporters contend there is time
before November's election to reclaim the support that swept him
into office four years ago as Utah's first Republican governor in
two decades.
   ``The polls are tightening and I think Norm could pull this
out,'' Charles Akerlow, former state GOP chairman, said recently.
``He's running hard and running scared and, consequently, running
very well.''

   Lax security at Energy Department nuclear
weapons laboratories has allowed agents from the Soviet bloc and
other countries to gain access to sensitive research facilities,
congressional investigators reported today.
   The visits took place at the national laboratories at Los Alamos
and Sandia in New Mexico and Livermore in California, where
scientists conduct advanced research on nuclear weapons and the
Strategic Defense Initiative, known as Star Wars, according to a
congressional report.
   The foreign visitors included specialists from the Soviet bloc,
China and nations which are believed either to have nuclear weapons
or are seeking to develop them, including India, Pakistan, Israel,
Brazil and Argentina.
   Officials at the FBI and CIA declined to discuss possible
espionage investigations stemming from the incidents and it was not
clear whether any secrets had been lost, according to the report by
the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress.

   When Richard Wagner put him on the operatic stage
in 1845, Tannhauser was a noble knight with one girlfriend too many
_ the pagan goddess of love. Now, he's a television evangelist with
the same problem.
   The goddess in Peter Sellars' production of ``Tannhauser,''
which premiered Monday evening at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, lives
in a sleazy Las Vegas motel and is attended by nymphs wearing only
their bikini tops for the first 90 seconds of Act 1.
   Tannhauser himself, sung by tenor Richard Cassilly, bears a
certain resemblance to the Rev. Jimmy Swaggart.
   Tannhauser confesses to his sins of the flesh during a ceremony
at a crystal cathedral clearly modeled on the Rev. Robert
Schuller's headquarters in California. In February, Swaggart
confessed to committing unspecified sins against his family and
God, while a prostitute maintained he had paid her to pose nude in
a motel room.

   The Agriculture Department has a new cookbook
this fall for school cafeterias which includes some new recipes,
labor-saving tips and a little pizazz for the pinto beans.
   In all, there are 161 recipes in the revised publication,
``Quantity Recipes for Type A School Lunches,'' the first new model
since 1971.
   School meals are served to 24 million children in 90,000 schools
across the country.
   Assistant Secretary John W. Bode says ``food service has changed
dramatically'' since the previous recipes were issued 17 years ago.
The new ones, he says, feature more optional ingredients and
seasonings to reflect regional food preferences.

   Babe Ruth drank here, between innings. Bill Veeck
threw his wooden leg across a stool and rhapsodized here for hours.
And future baseball legends, it now appears, will get a chance to
become part of the lore at McCuddy's saloon.
   The tavern is one of 11 businesses scheduled for demolition as
the state clears the area around ancient Comiskey Park for a new
stadium for Chicago's White Sox by 1991.
   But Gov. James R. Thompson has promised that McCuddy's, with a
little help from the state, will rise from those ashes like a
phoenix in the same spot it has occupied for 78 years _ directly
across the street from Comiskey Park.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' Pat Senese, the bar's 65-year-old owner, said
Monday. ``My wife is the third generation of the McCuddy family to
have a stake in this and now we know it'll go on beyond that.''
