   The Communist Party has changed its
name and embraced democratic aspirations, but its members on Monday
retained the head of the old party in a compromise vote.
   Delegates to the closed session said Rezsoe Nyers was chosen as
head of the Hungarian Socialist Party's collective presidency after
dissatisfied reformers reluctantly agreed to support him.
   Hours before beginning the closed session, the party congress
adopted a manifesto pledging commitment to democracy and a break
with the Marxist-Leninist orientation of its Communist predecessor.
   Despite the stated commitment to democracy, reformist delegates
have expressed concern that the new party does not differ
sufficiently from its predecessor. The choice of Nyers to continue
as leader was expected to increase the anxiety of some who wanted a
clean break with the past.

   Two University of California cancer
researchers won the Nobel Prize in medicine Monday and immediately
reaped the perquisites of success: box seats at the National League
baseball playoffs.
   ``We're off to the game _ just got tickets,'' a jubilant J.
Michael Bishop said shortly after he and Harold E. Varmus learned
that they had won this year's prize.
   The 50-member Nobel Assembly of the Karolinska Institute,
Sweden's largest and oldest medical university, cited Bishop and
Varmus for their discovery that cancer genes in certain viruses are
altered forms of normal animal genes.
   The research helped scientists understand how cancer begins, and
it ``widened our insight into the complicated signal systems which
govern the normal growth of cells,'' the assembly said.

   The operator of the Rocky Flats nuclear arms
plant knew as early as 1984 that dangerous amounts of radioactive
plutonium may have accumulated in building air ducts but failed to
act on the information, a former employee said Monday.
   James Stone, a utility design engineer at the site from 1980 to
1986, said he raised the probability of such plutonium deposits _
and the safety hazard they would pose _ with Rockwell International
Corp., which operates the plant near Denver under an Energy
Department contract.
   ``They said we cannot afford to clean it,'' Stone said in a
telephone interview.
   Stone's suspicion of a buildup of plutonium residue in the
ventilation system at Rocky Flats was borne out by a team of
independent investigators who disclosed in a report to the Energy
Department last week that such plutonium deposits raised ``a real
possibility'' of an accidental nuclear chain reaction at Rocky
Flats.

   Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge is
worth an estimated $5.2 billion, but he had to back into first
place on Forbes magazine's annual list of the 400 richest Americans.
   Kluge displaced Sam Walton, head of the Wal-Mart stores discount
chain, who divided his $9 billion fortune among himself and his
four children and ended a four-year reign as Forbes's wealthiest
person.
   Among other notables on the list released Monday, developer
Donald Trump compounded his already considerable fortune and
financiers Michael Milken and Carl Icahn joined the billionaires
club.
   Overall, Forbes' richest are worth an estimated total of about
$269 billion, up nearly $50 billion from the previous year, a 22
percent increase that substantially outpaced last year's 4.4
percent inflation rate.

   Some might think a television show about
home renovation would be as exciting as watching paint dry. But
PBS' ``This Old House'' has long since proved that Americans love
to watch other people fix up fixer-uppers.
   Now ``This Old House'' has this new host: Steve Thomas, an
eclectic blend of Thor Heyerdahl, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Robert
Redford.
   PBS officials hope that Thomas, 36, an expert sailor, carpenter,
world traveler and writer, will dispel the whiff of scandal that
hovered over the show when its original host, Bob Vila, left over a
conflict of interest.
   The popular Vila began as co-host of the show with master
carpenter Norm Abram 11 years ago. He left after last season when
an underwriter withdrew funding in a dispute over Vila's commercial
endorsements.
