   The wealthy are getting a dose of what many
Americans already know: rougher economic times.
   Forbes reported Monday that the nation's 400 richest individuals
suffered a decline in net worth this year for the first time since
the magazine began compiling the list eight years ago.
   Fifty-three of the Forbes 400 list lost anywhere from $100
million to $880 million, the magazine said in its Oct. 22 edition.
The minimum net worth required to join the elite ranking, which had
risen steadily from 1982 to 1989, dropped from $275 million last
year to $260 million this year.
   Some names such as casino monger Donald J. Trump were evicted,
another symbolic boot to the 1980s era of living on borrowed money.
Forbes said Trump's fortune, estimated at $1.7 billion in 1989, was
possibly within ``hailing distance of zero'' because of looming
loans and a slow economy.
   Trump, who previously has denounced Forbes for downgrading his
ranking on the list, did not return a telephone call for comment.
   ``It's not just the year Donald Trump's and some other
overleveraged fortunes hit the wall,'' the magazine said. ``This
year the entire Forbes 400 list seemed to stop going up and, on
balance, start going down.''
   ``This year all kinds of things went down: real estate, media,
banks, public stocks, private companies, you name it,'' Forbes
said.
   It said the declines ``reflected a general scaling down of
capital values, brought about in good part by a worldwide shrinkage
of credit and sinking stock markets.''
   That's not to say the wealthiest are hurting unbearably. The
estimated worth of the Forbes 400 totals $272.5 billion. That's
actually up $3.5 billion over last year's total, but the magazine
said the reason was its discovery of previously hidden sources of
wealth among some members of the list.
   Forty-three names were added to the list this year, meaning 43
old names came off. Six died, including the magazine's own namesake
Malcolm Forbes. The fortunes of 35 fell too far to be included.
   In addition, Alfred Dreyfus Goldman, Oklahoma City, with a 1989
real estate fortune estimated at $400 million, was removed from the
list because of an inheritance dispute with his brother. William
Barron Hilton was dropped because part of his 1989 total of $1.25
billion actually belongs to a foundation.
   As in 1989, the richest person on the list was John Werner
Kluge, 76, thrice-married entertainment entrepreneur who made his
$5.6 billion fortune by building up Metromedia Co., a wide-ranging
telecommunications company.
   No. 2 is Omaha investor Warren Buffett, 60, who bought his first
stock at age 11 and parlayed a savvy for picking stocks into a $3.3
billion fortune.
   Third is debt-financed takeover specialist Ronald O. Perelman,
47, a Wharton business school alumnus who borrowed money to build
an empire that ranges from the Revlon cosmetics company to Coleman
camping products to savings &amp; loans. Forbes pegged his worth at
$2.87 billion.
   More notable, however, were the people whose net worth tumbled.
The biggest victim was Sumner Murray Redstone, owner of the
entertainment giant Viacom International Inc., whose fortune
dropped from $2.88 billion to $2 billion.
   Others in the big-loser category included
publishing-entertainment baron Rupert Murdoch, whose fortune fell
by $600 million to $1.1 billion; cable TV mogul Ted Turner, whose
worth fell $460 million to $1.3 billion; and convicted Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond pioneer Milken, whose worth plunged
by $570 million to $700 million, largely because of $600 million in
criminal penalties and losses from Drexel's collapse early this
year.
   Among new names on the list, the wealthiest was Fred A. Lennon,
a highly secretive Ohio industrialist who made his $600 million
fortune selling valves and pipe fittings.
   The magazine said it based the figures on intensive research
into inheritances, stock ownership and what it called conservative,
common-sense estimates.
   Forbes has sought to make the 400 ranking its trademark, much
like arch-rival Fortune magazine has done with its annual ranking
of the 500 biggest U.S. industrial companies.
