   Publisher Malcolm Stevenson Forbes, as
usual, made Forbes Magazine's list of the 400 richest people in
America, and as usual, he chose not to disclose his own wealth.
   Forbes has kept his net worth a closely guarded secret, and
aides to the publishing mogul contend that he may not even know
where he falls on the list.
   Saying no official wealth estimate is available, the magazine
has made him No. 113 on the list, between Laszlo Nandor Tauber,
worth $500 million, and John Thomas Lupton, worth $480 million.
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``One thing I can say for sure, he's definitely worth between
$225 million and $6 billion,'' said Harold Seneker, a Forbes editor.
   Being publisher has its privileges for the Far Hills
million-or-billionaire. In short, he doesn't publish how much he's
worth because he doesn't have to.
   ``There is no (dollar figure) for him simply because he feels
it's his prerogative as owner of the magazine not to release his
net worth,'' said Forbes spokesman Ray Healey. ``He just chooses to
keep it to himself.''
   But really, how much is he worth?
   ``I don't think he even knows what it is and I don't think he's
in any hurry to have it figured out,'' said Don Garson, director of
corporate communications for Forbes.
   It would be unfair to Forbes to print his worth, Garson said,
because the dollar figures for the other 399 people listed are
presumed estimated, and Forbes' would be presumed factual since it
is his magazine.
   While the Oct. 24 issue includes outsiders' estimates of Forbes'
worth, they range dramatically. The London Daily Mail guesses $400
million, Newsday estimates his worth between $400 million and $700
million, and New York's Daily News simply says he's a
``billionaire.''
   Forbes, 69, owns American Heritage magazine, Somerset Press, a
400-square-mile Colorado ranch, a South Sea island, a London
mansion and a French chateau, among other holdings.
