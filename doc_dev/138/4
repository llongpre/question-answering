<HEAD>Tsutsumi Heads Forbes List of Billionaires for Second Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Yoshiaki Tsutsumi is a bit poorer than he was
last year _ make that less wealthy _ but the Japanese railroad
magnate still ranks as the world's richest person, according to
Forbes magazine.
   Tsutsumi, head of Japan's Seibu Railway Group, has a personal
net worth of at least $18.9 billion, making him the world's richest
person for the second straight year, Forbes said Thursday.
   The magazine, in a report on the richest people outside the
United States, estimated Tsutsumi's fortune at approximately $20
billion last fall in its first survey of the world's richest people.
   The story appears in the magazine's July 25 issue.
   The designation for Tsutsumi again puts Forbes at odds with
Fortune magazine. In its compilation of the world's billionaires
last October, Fortune estimated Tsutsumi's holdings in railroads,
hotels and golf clubs were worth a far smaller _ but still
substantial _ $2.5 billion.
   The second richest person on Forbes' list is also Japanese.
Taikichiro Mori, a former economics professor who owns 68 office
buildings in Tokyo, is worth $18 billion, the magazine estimated.
In the previous survey, Mori's fortune was put at $15 billion.
   Following the two Japanese are the Reichmann brothers of Canada,
who have built a $9 billion fortune in real estate, Forbes said.
   Shin Kyuk-ho, a South Korean with interests in candy making,
hotels and real estate, is ranked No. 4 ($8 billion-plus), and
Kenneth Cole Irving, a Canadian with interests in oil distribution,
paper and land, is No. 5 ($8 billion).
   The survey identifies 119 non-American individuals or families
around the world whose personal net assets are worth more than $1
billion, up from 90 in the previous list.
   The United States still accounts for more billionaires than any
other country, Forbes noted. The magazine said at least 47 American
individuals and 20 U.S. families are worth more than $1 billion,
compared with 32 individuals and families in second-place Japan and
16 in third-ranked West Germany.
   The leading American billionaire is Sam Walton, the head of
major retailer Wal-Mart Stores, who ranks seventh worldwide with a
net worth of $6.5 billion, Forbes estimates.
   Not all the fortunes listed in Forbes' list were amassed in a
respectable way.
   Three of them belong to people the magazine identified as
Colombian drug dealers, two individuals and one family, who are all
part of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Two of the Colombian cocaine fortunes, those of Pablo Escobar
Gaviria and the Ochoa family, are each more than $2 billion, Forbes
said. It estimated the third, amassed by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
at between $1.3 billion and $3 billion.
