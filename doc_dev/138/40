   In a state that has no limits on political
contributions, Douglas Wilder's campaign for governor of Virginia
is happy to have the support of John W. Kluge, named by Forbes
Magazine as the richest man in America.
   ``It's great,'' B.J. Northington, a Wilder campaign aide, said
Tuesday. ``He's given us, what, $200,000?'' Indeed, he has, in two
checks so far this year of $100,000 each. Kluge raised an
additional $500,000 for Wilder at a $5,000-a-couple get together at
his Charlottesville estate.
   But Northington was quick to say that Wilder's Republican
opponent, J. Marshall Coleman, has received more than $900,000 in
campaign contributions from McLean, Va., developer Dwight Schar and
his family.
   Big money is a hallmark of the campaign to succeed Virginia's
Democratic Gov. Gerald Baliles, who cannot run for re-election.
   Coleman has raised more than $8 million and Wilder, bidding to
become the first black elected governor of any state, has taken in
close to $5 million. The election is Nov. 7.
   Money can be easy to raise in Virginia, too easy, according to
Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia.
   ``We have no limitations in Virginia,'' he said. ``People can
give millions if they want.''
   Sabato defends political action committees as a preferred
alternative to individual contributions in the range of hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
   ``They're making an investment,'' he said of such contributors.
``I've yet to find a person who believes the line they're doing it
for good government.''
   Alson Smith, a member of the Virginia House of Delegates who is
one of the state's premier political fund-raisers, said he
supported efforts to limit individual contributions to $1,000.
   ``We couldn't get that to fly,'' he said, adding that attempts
to set the limit at $5,000 and $10,000 were no more successful.
   Smith described Kluge as ``a good friend of mine'' and said,
``I've never asked him for a dime for anybody.''
   He said he thought Kluge was ``basically a Republican.''
   The 75-year-old Kluge is described as a self-made man who
parlayed a Maryland radio station into the Metromedia radio and
television empire.
   Forbes estimated his fortune at $5.2 billion and said his
holdings rose about $2 billion from the previous year thanks to a
tripling in the value of his investment in cellular telephones.
   He took the role of richest man in America from Sam Walton, head
of the Wal-Mart stores discount chain who dropped down on the
individual list because he divided his $9 billion fortune among
himself and his four children.
   Smith said Kluge and Wilder met when the billionaire had ``a
little mixer'' on his yacht.
   ``He started off without a dime,'' Smith said of Kluge. ``He
felt Doug Wilder had brought himself up by his bootstraps.''
   That prompted the first $100,000 check from Kluge to the Wilder
campaign. The story of the second check was told by Patricia Kluge
at the fund-raising reception at their estate.
   According to Mrs. Kluge, Coleman called her husband and said he
was aware of his support for Wilder but ``I'm going to win and I
think we should get to know each other.''
   Mrs. Kluge said that after that conversation her husband wrote
another $100,000 check to the Wilder campaign.
   What would Kluge's money buy if Wilder is elected governor?
   There has been widespread speculation that the billionaire's
wife yearns to sit on the University of Virginia Board of Visitors.
   Smith brushed off such suggestions, saying that given Kluge's
wealth, ``There's nothing Doug Wilder can do for John Kluge. What
can anybody do for John Kluge?''
