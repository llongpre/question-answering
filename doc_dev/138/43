<HEAD>Discount Chain's Founder Undergoes Cancer Therapy</HEAD>

   Sam Walton, the 71-year-old founder of
the Wal-Mart discount chain empire, has undergone treatment for
bone-marrow cancer, a company spokesman said Thursday.
   Walton, once the richest person in America, has received two
sessions of chemotherapy and some radiation therapy since Sunday
for multiple myeloma, said Don Shinkle, a Wal-mart spokesman.
   Myeloma is a malignant tumor in the bone marrow. It is generally
made up of abnormal plasma cells.
   A Wal-Mart statement said Walton was expected to recover fully
from treatment he underwent in Houston at M.D. Anderson Hospital.
   It is the second time Walton has faced cancer. In 1982, he was
diagnosed as having leukemia and also was treated at M.D. Anderson.
The leukemia has been in remission for several years.
   ``Along with Mr. Sam's doctors, we are very encouraged that
because of early detection and treatment a full recovery is
expected,'' the statement said.
   ``His doctors have advised him that they have had good success
treating this type of cancer if it's detected in time,'' Shinkle
said. ``He's in very good spirits.''
   Shinkle said Walton probably would spend another couple of weeks
in Houston. ``The bottom line, we hear from the doctors, is that
they caught this in time, in the early stages,'' he said.
   Walton had experienced aches and pains for several months, but
felt better after the therapy, Shinkle said.
   ``I feel so much better already,'' Walton said in a two-page
memo to Wal-Mart employees.
   Shinkle said the memo was issued because Walton wanted employees
to hear news of his illness from him, ``rather than have them to
hear a lot of rumors, because many might be exaggerated or untrue.''
   Shinkle said Walton may be initially slowed down, but that he
expects to resume visiting outlets in a few weeks, a common Walton
practice. After this week's treatments, Walton visited a Sam's
Wholesale Club in Houston.
   Walton has been known to drop in on local Wal-Mart managers with
little advance notice to stay in touch with the retail business at
the customer level.
   The memo also described Wal-Mart accomplishments during the
1980s, which Walton credited to the employees of the chain's 1,300
stores. It said Walton looked forward to more success.
   Based on his holdings of Wal-Mart stock, Walton has been listed
for the past several years by Forbes magazine as one of the
wealthiest men in the nation. He was the wealthiest until he split
his stock among family members.
   Walton stepped down as chief executive officer of the retail
chain in 1988, and chose David Glass to oversee the chain.
   The chain blossomed under Walton's philosophy of tight
management and general marketing principles that the customer is
always right.
   Born in Kingfisher, Okla., Walton grew up as the son of a
farm-mortgage banker. He graduated from the University of Missouri
with an economics degree in 1940 and joined J.C. Penney Co. as a
management trainee in Des Moines, Iowa. After serving three years
in the Army, he went to Arkansas and opened a Ben Franklin
five-and-dime. In 1962, Sam and his brother James L. Walton, opened
the first Wal-Mart Discount City.
   Three of his four grown children are involved with the company
in various capacities.
