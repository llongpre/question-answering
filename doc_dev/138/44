<TEXT>     Walton said his cancer was detected about a year ago, soon after he was
injured during a hunting trip. He has since undergone chemotherapy.;   
Before, he said, he couldn't lift his arms, had trouble shooting a gun and had
chronic pain in the ribs. Now he hunts quail and conducts business as usual.
He has given up tennis, he said, but still flies his own plane.;    "I've
never felt better before in my life," he said. "I am well enough to hassle the
folks at the office.";    Walton told a packed auditorium that he remains an
"optimist at heart.";    "I just think that some bright person will be able to
help me in time and, if not, save a lot of other people. If it's next year,
that's all right; if it's next month, that's all right. Let's just go ahead
and enjoy the days we have left.";    On last year's list of the 400 richest
Americans, Forbes magazine estimated Walton's wealth at $2.5 billion, ranking
him in 11th place.  </TEXT>
