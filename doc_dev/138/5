   A Japanese developer again topped a list of the
world's richest people, but the annual tally has one conspicuous
deletion this year: Donald J. Trump.
   Despite the financial troubles of the New York developer, the
United States continues to contain the world's largest number of
billionaires _ 62 _ according to estimates by Forbes magazine. In
addition, there are 37 U.S. families with fortunes over $1 billion,
Forbes says in its July 23 issue.
   Forbes, in estimates released Monday, says the world's
wealthiest person for the fourth straight year was Yoshiaki
Tsutsumi of Japan, whose railroad and real estate empire includes
golf courses, ski resorts and hotels. Forbes estimated his net
worth at $16 billion, up about $1 billion from last year.
   That estimate was far greater than that of rival business
magazine Fortune, which put Tsutsumi's net worth at $3.1 billion
last September.
   Fortune said the world's richest person is the Sultan of Brunei,
at $25 billion. Forbes excludes heads of state from consideration.
   Following the 56-year-old Tsutsumi on the Forbes list was
Japanese developer Taikichiro Mori, a former economics professor
who now owns 78 office buildings. Forbes put Mori's net worth at
$14.6 billion.
   Ranked third was the family of Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart,
the third-largest U.S.retail chain. Forbes estimates that the
Waltons, who also were third-ranked last year, are worth $13.3
billion, up from $8.7 billion in 1989.
   America's du Pont family was fourth, with a net worth estimated
at $10 billion. They were followed by Hans and Gad Rausing, two
Swedish brothers who control a packaging empire worth $9.6 billion.
   Kitaro Watanabe, a Japanese real estate owner, was sixth at $9.2
billion. He was followed by Canada's Reichmann brothers, owners of
the Olympia &amp; York real estate company, at $9 billion.
   Kenkichi Nakajima and his family, founder of Japan's largest
maker of pachinko machines, a gambling game similar to pinball,
were eighth at $8.4 billion.
   South Korea's Shin Kyuk-ho, who owns a candy and real estate
empire, was ninth at $7 billion to $8 billion; and Forrest E. Mars
and family of the United States, of Mars candy fame, were 10th at
an estimated $6 billion.
   Other American families with net worth exceeding $3 billion
included the Newhouse, Hearst and Cox families, which derive their
fortunes from publishing and broadcasting; the Bass family of
Texas; the Mellon family of banking fame; the Dorrance family,
whose wealth comes from Campbell Soup Co.; and Bill Gates, founder
of the computer software company Microsoft Corp.
   John Werner Kluge remained the richest American individual,
according to Forbes. Kluge, founder of the media company
Metromedia, has an estimated net worth of $5.2 billion, placing him
in a tie for 12th place on the worldwide list with the Newhouses.
   As for Trump, Forbes put his net worth last year at $1.7
billion, but it dropped sharply this year as the value of his real
estate and airline empire plummeted. In April, the magazine said he
was worth about a half a billion dollars. Some sources peg it even
lower.
   Forbes says one trend it noticed in compiling this year's list
was the number of wealthy Germans. The magazine identified 38 West
German billionaire families _ far more per capita than in Japan or
the United States.
   The list includes 40 Japanese and 99 American individuals or
families with a net worth over $1 billion.
   Forbes says it identified 271 billionaire individuals or
families worldwide, up from 226 last year. The compilation is based
on recent stock valuations, comparable real estate valuations and
currency exchange rates, among other factors.
   The magazine says it excludes from consideration royal families
and heads of state because their wealth ``derives more from
political heritage than from economic effort.''
   But it doesn't exclude drug dealers. Among the billionaires it
lists are Colombia's Pablo Escobar Gaviria, the head of the
Medellin cocaine cartel, at about $3 billion, and Colombia's Ochoa
family, at about $2 billion.
