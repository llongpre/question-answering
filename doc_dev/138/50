Forbes magazine released its annual list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people 
today, spelling out what some have suspected with glee for months: Donald Trump 
has hit very hard times, and he's not the only high-flier who crashed with the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
While the flashy developer was dropped right off the Forbes 400 list, 
Metromedia founder John Kluge grew even richer. 
</P>
<P>
The rags-to-riches German expanded his fortune by $400 million, to a staggering 
$5.6 billion, enough to retain his crown as the richest of the rich. 
</P>
<P>
But most of the top 400 saw their net worth dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
"With the end of the great 1980s credit binge, capital values almost everywhere 
are being marked down. Just as homeowners feel less wealthy than a year ago, so 
do most of the nations' rich," the magazine said. "In 1990 the rich have been 
getting poorer. 
</P>
<P>
"Trump is the most noteworthy loser," it said. "Once a billionaire, Trump's net 
worth may actually have dropped to zero." 
</P>
<P>
Another loser is Merv Griffin, whose Resorts International, which owns the 
struggling casino next door to Trump's struggling Taj Mahal, went bankrupt.
