   Forbes magazine says its estimates of the net
worth of what it considers the 400 wealthiest Americans are
``deliberately conservative.''
   The magazine said its basic principle in compiling the estimates
was to ``think in terms of how much a prudent buyer ... might be
willing to pay for a person's net assets.''
   Among the factors used in compiling the estimates, which Forbes
released Monday:
   _Blocks of publicly traded stock were priced at the market close
Sept. 8.
   _Privately held companies were valued according to estimated
revenues and earnings and to prevailing price-earnings ratios for
publicly traded companies in similar businesses.
   _If earnings and cash flow weren't known, the magazine said, it
adopted valuations typically used in particular industries.
   _For trusts and other inter-family arrangements, Forbes said it
worked on a case-by-case basis ``applying common sense.''
   ``The fortunes of the very rich are, of course, very difficult
to calculate,'' Forbes said. ``Often it isn't even clear exactly
who owns a great fortune.''
