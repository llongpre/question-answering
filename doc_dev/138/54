   Donald Trump may not be nearly as rich as he
claims, Forbes magazine says in an article that if true would bump
the tycoon out of the world billionaire's club.
   Forbes has slashed its estimate of Trump's net worth by more
than $1 billion, to around $500 million. In its May 14 cover story,
which Forbes made available Friday, the magazine says it revised
the estimate after examining nonpublic documents submitted by Trump
last year to a government body, which Forbes declined to specify.
   The article challenges Trump's claim in the documents to have a
net worth of $1.5 billion. It also questions whether Trump's cash
flow is sufficient to cover the debt and interest payments on his
vast holdings.
   The developer said Friday he has discussed selling or
refinancing most of his major asset to raise money to buy new
properties. Trump said he has hired Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. to
negotiate a possible sale of the Trump Shuttle less than a year
after buying the airline and sticking his name on it.
   Trump said he is interested in raising cash now so that he will
have funds on hand in the future to acquire additional properties.
   His assets also include New York's Plaza Hotel, the glitzy Trump
Tower skyscraper on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, and casinos in
Atlantic City, N.J., including the $1 billion Taj Mahal casino,
which recently opened.
   In a statement released late Friday, Trump Organization said
Forbes made a ``mathematical mistake or purposeful omission'' by
not including $160 million a year in anticipated operating profit
from the Taj Mahal, while including the new casino's debt service.
   ``They (Forbes) made a major mistake here,'' said a Trump
spokesman, who asked not to be identified by name.
   He declined comment on the broader question of Trump's total net
worth. ``Only Donald Trump's accountants know this,'' he said.
``Forbes magazine may guess, as others do, but they really don't
know.''
   Ray Healey, a spokesman for the magazine, responded, ``We've
done a very thorough analysis and we stand by our story.''
   Using the list of properties in Trump's 1989 documents, and
updating their values, Forbes said it came up with a total market
value of slightly less than $3.7 billion. However, with nearly $3.2
billion in debt, Trump's cash shortfall may be nearly $40 million a
year, the business magazine estimated.
   Some of the interest on his debt is accruing rather than being
paid in cash.
   In the documents, Trump claims a net worth, after deducting all
debts and mortgages, of $1.5 billion, Forbes noted in the article
entitled ``Manhattan's Favorite Guessing Game: How Rich is Donald?''
   The magazine's own estimate in 1989 was $1.7 billion.
   ``Double-whammied by a real estate recession and problems with
his gambling casinos, Donald Trump may be down to his last
half-billion in net worth and he has little liquidity,'' the
article says. ``That's not comfortable for a guy with more than $3
billion in debt.''
   In an interview Friday with The Associated Press, Trump insisted
that he is ``very liquid now.''
   ``I want to build up cash because I think cash is going to be
king,'' he said.
