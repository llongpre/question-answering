BREN FALLS IN FORBES RANKING OF THE RICH;

<P>
Orange County's Donald is poorer, but the Donald appears headed for the 
poorhouse. 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Bren, the Newport Beach real estate developer, joined many of the 
nation's wealthiest last year in seeing a portion of his fortune slip away. 
According to Forbes magazine, Bren's net worth now is estimated at $1.6 billion 
-- $250 million less than in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
But that's nothing compared to the record of Donald Trump, the flashy real 
estate mogul and deal maker. Trump last year had a net worth $1.7 billion; this 
year he has less than $260 million -- probably much less. 
</P>
<P>
Trump, whose name had become synonymous with the high-flying, money-mad 1980s, 
earlier this year hit a cash crunch and had difficulty meeting debt payments. 
Now, Forbes says, Trump's fortune is within "hailing distance of zero." 
</P>
<P>
But the two Donalds were not the only ones with financial problems over the 
past year. Many of the nation's richest saw their fortunes decline as the 
nation nursed a hangover from its decade-long financial binge. 
</P>
<P>
"In 1990, the rich have been getting poorer," the Oct. 22 issue of Forbes 
notes. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's neighbor on Atlantic City's casino row, Merv Griffin, disappeared from 
Forbes' annual list of the 400 wealthiest Americans as his Resorts 
International went bankrupt. Other notable losers include media moguls Rupert 
Murdoch and Ted Turner. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Milken, the junk-bond king turned convicted felon, remained on the 
list, with Forbes estimating his net worth at $700 million. Milken weathered 
the payment of a record $600-million fine earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This year, the entire Forbes 400 list seemed to stop going up and, on balance, 
started going down," the magazine states. 
</P>
<P>
The publication blamed much of the slide on the slumping stock market and 
drooping real estate prices. Fifty-three moguls on the list saw their incomes 
drop between $100 million and $880 million. The minimum net worth required was 
$15 million less than last year's $275 million. 
</P>
<P>
The richest person in the nation, according to Forbes, continues to be 
Metromedia founder John Kluge. A rags-to-riches German, he has made an 
estimated $400 million over the year, adding to a fortune now estimated at $5.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Bren, three other Orange County residents made the list. William Lyon 
($350 million), Richard J. O'Neill ($300 million) and George L. Argyros ($290 
million), all of whom made their fortunes in real estate, made their usual 
appearances on the list without any significant changes. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, chairman of the Irvine Co., plummeted to 35th place on the list, down 
from 19th place last year, when Forbes put his fortune at $1.85 billion. The 
magazine does not allude to a specific cause for Bren's slide in its annual 
listing. 
</P>
<P>
But the amount of Bren's loss roughly approximates the award that a court 
recently ordered the Irvine Co., which is controlled by Bren, to pay Joan 
Irvine Smith for her 11% stake in the company. The court ordered the company to 
pay her $149 million plus interest, an amount expected to total about $250 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes also notes that the Irvine Co.'s development is being constrained by 
"strong environmental forces." Last week, the company compromised on a proposed 
2,000-acre development near Laguna Beach after environmentalists complained. 
</P>
<P>
Bren is described by Forbes as a 58-year-old, twice-divorced, one-time 
"Hollywood rich kid." He borrowed $10,000 to finance the construction of his 
first house. His home-building business took off, and he eventually bought the 
Irvine Ranch with four other investors in 1977. He subsequently bought off the 
others and was left with $1 billion worth of Orange County's most picturesque 
and desired property. 
</P>
<P>
A Bren spokeswoman said that the billionaire has a policy of never commenting 
on his rank on the Forbes list since he has never been consulted and is 
unfamiliar with the magazine's methodology. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the payment for her Irvine Co. stock alone would be almost enough 
to boost Smith, the granddaughter of the Irvine Ranch's founder, onto the 
Forbes list, she was left off. She was on the list several years ago before the 
criteria to be included skyrocketed. 
</P>
<P>
While Smith was conspicuous by her absence, Forbes lists Freedom Newspapers 
publisher Harry Howard Hoiles as still residing in Santa Ana. Hoiles, worth an 
estimated $375 million, now resides in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The list also includes some notables who have extensive ties to Orange County 
even though they don't live here. Gene Autry, best known locally as the owner 
of the California Angels, is listed at $300 million. Autry made his fortune 
buying and selling radio and television stations and listed by Forbes as living 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
There are also a smattering of Disney family members: Walt Disney's widow, 
Lillian, has an estimated $315 million; Roy E. Disney has $575 million; and 
Sharon Disney Lund has $275 million. 
</P>

<P>
ORANGE COUNTY'S RICH 
</P>
<P>
Four Orange County residents made the list of the nation's wealthiest 
individuals, according to the annual compilation by Forbes magazine. All four 
were also on last year's list. 
</P>
<P>
Donald L. Bren 
</P>
<P>
Residence: Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
Net worth: $1.6 billion 
</P>
<P>
1990 rank: 35 
</P>
<P>
1989 rank: 19 
</P>
<P>
Summary: A slump in the real estate market, increasing political pressure 
against new development on Irvine Ranch-owned land and the court award likely 
to amount to more than $250 million to heiress Joan Irvine Smith all appeared 
to have contributed to Bren's fall in his ranking on the Forbes list. Still, 
the magazine notes, Bren owns one-sixth of Orange County and has presided over 
the building of some of the poshest estates, condominiums and office towers in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
William Lyon 
</P>
<P>
Residence: Coto de Caza 
</P>
<P>
Net worth: $350 million 
</P>
<P>
1990 rank: 288 
</P>
<P>
1989 rank: 283 
</P>
<P>
Summary: Lyon, a retired Air Force general, made his fortune building low-cost 
homes for first-time buyers. He has dabbled in other business ventures as well, 
such as buying financially ailing AirCal in 1981 and selling it at a profit in 
1986. It was merged into American Airlines. Lyon, an avid car collector, is 
active in Orange County social circles and remains a major home builder. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Richard J. O'Neill 
</P>
<P>
Residence: San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
Net worth: $300 million 
</P>
<P>
1990 rank: 350 
</P>
<P>
1989 rank: 354 
</P>
<P>
Summary: O'Neill shares a hefty inheritance with his sister, Alice O'Neill 
Avery of Los Angeles. He parlayed that into millions more through Southern 
California real estate development. He co-developed the massive Mission Viejo 
tract in the 1960s with Donald Bren and is currently building the 5,000-acre 
Rancho Santa Margarita planned community in South County. O'Neill has ranches 
in Mexico, California and Nevada. He is active in Democratic politics, and 
Forbes says he is known for his "disheveled appearance." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
George Leon Argyros 
</P>
<P>
Residence: Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
Net worth: $290 million 
</P>
<P>
1990 rank: 370 
</P>
<P>
1989 rank: 386 
</P>
<P>
Summary: Argyros built a real estate empire after deciding it was a way to 
wealth. "If you work hard, it's one of the frontiers that are left," Forbes 
reports. He bought and sold baseball's Seattle Mariners, netting $50 million 
despite the team's losing record. He owns 5,200 apartment units.
