   Metromedia Co. founder John W. Kluge, the
wealthiest man in America, credits much of his success to plain old
gambling and good luck.
   ``The greatest factor in my life - and I know entrepreneurial
people don't want to express it, they think it diminishes them -
but luck plays a large part,'' Kluge told Forbes magazine in a
rare, recent interview.
   The 76-year-old Kluge (pronounced kloogy) is worth an estimated
$5.6 billion, making him the richest man in the country, according
to Forbes. The Forbes 400 ranking released last Monday marked the
second straight year Kluge topped the list. Last year, the magazine
estimated his worth at $5.2 billion.
   While many successful men are driven by money, Kluge is not,
said his estranged wife, Patricia.
   ``John was a pioneer - he wasn't particularly a man who wanted
to be rich or enjoy a grand life,'' Mrs. Kluge, 41, told The
Washingtonian magazine in an interview published in August.
   ``He was more an intellectual businessman than a money-making
businessman,'' she said. ``He was more challenged by the creation
of new ideas and new markets against all odds . . . He took a small
idea and turned it into something grand.''
   Friends and colleagues also describe the stocky, balding Kluge
as friendly and down-to-earth.
   ``He's just a regular guy,'' said Alson H. Smith, who has known
the Kluges since they moved to Virginia in 1982. ``He'll talk about
anything you want to talk about.''
   Kluge, born in Germany, came to the United States in 1922 at age
8. The son of an engineer, he and his family settled in Detroit,
and for a time he worked on a Ford assembly line.
   During the Depression, Kluge enrolled in Columbia University and
earned an economics degree in 1937. He worked in Army intelligence
during World War II.
   At Columbia, Kluge told Forbes, he was a gambler, often playing
cards well into the night to help earn money for school. ``I came
out of college with $7,000,'' he said.
   Kluge got into broadcasting after the war, buying his first
radio station in 1946. Later he expanded into television, and his
holdings, Metromedia Broadcasting, eventually grew into seven TV
stations and 14 radio stations. The TV stations eventually became
the foundation of Fox Television.
   Business wasn't always smooth. In the early 1980s, Metromedia
was taking a beating on Wall Street.
   Kluge, convinced his properties were worth much more, decided to
go private by buying out public shares. He warned his wife of tight
financial times ahead, but by her own account, she wasn't
sympathetic.
   ``There was no buildup for this thing. I was stunned, as any
wife would be,'' she said. ``And I said: `Why don't you have a
fortune? All those people lesser than you certainly don't have your
brain and your vision, but they have fortunes.' ''
   When he told her it had never been important for him to become
rich, she shot back, ``Damn it, it is now!'' The Kluges had just
adopted a son, John W. Kluge II.
   ``Go out and become a billionaire, and don't come back until you
are,'' she said she told her husband. ``And he did.''
   Kluge had met Patricia Rose, the Baghdad-born daughter of a
British father and Scottish-Iraqi mother, at a dinner party in
1976. She was divorced from Russell Gay, publisher of the British
men's magazine Knave, which had run nude photographs of her.
   She and Kluge were married in 1981, he for the third time.
   ``What attracted me was his brilliance,'' she said. ``I was
absolutely knocked out by his ability to achieve whatever he wanted
to achieve.''
   The reclusive Kluge declined to be interviewed by The Associated
Press.
   After the highly leveraged buyout that gave him all of
Metromedia, Kluge sold off the pieces for $4.65 billion, according
to Forbes, and personally netted more than $1.6 billion.
   ``I felt that television was going to change,'' Kluge told
Forbes of the selloff. ``I just thought that it was going to get
more competitive.''
   Since then, Kluge has invested his profits in other interests,
including cellular telephones and restaurants. He owns the
Ponderosa Steak House, Bonanza and Steak &amp; Ale chains. He recently
sold his New York cellular operations for more than $1 billion in
cash and $850 million in stock.
   Kluge plays his business deals as close to the vest as he plays
his cards.
   ``Whenever I have a plan, I keep it really very much to myself,
because I make changes in my own mind,'' he said. ``It's been a
habit of mine to do that, not because I don't want to look like I
don't make mistakes - I make mistakes all the time - but rather so
that people around me don't feel that every five minutes I'm
changing my mind.
   ``I have to work things out, and I sometimes change in the
middle of the course,'' he said.
   ``I think the ability to gauge risks is crucial. I never
ordinarily take on things that I can't see some end to, where you
pile risks on risks,'' he said.
   One of Kluge's lesser-known business ventures is cattle breeding
on his 10,000-acre Albemarle Farms estate in the shadow of
Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's home near Charlottesville, Va.
   Before the Kluges separated this spring, he balanced the week
between Virginia and his New York office, but now spends more time
in New York. In a 1986 broadcast interview, he said he moved to the
pastoral county near the Blue Ridge Mountains ``because it's a
place where the urban centers like Washington don't encroach.'' He
also owns 70,000 acres in Scotland.
   Mrs. Kluge will keep the 45-room Albemarle House mansion the
couple built on the Virginia estate plus a reported $1.5 million
weekly allowance. She serves on the governing board of nearby
University of Virginia.
   She and Kluge contributed $200,000 to Virginia Gov. L. Douglas
Wilder's campaign for election last November, and both served as
chairmen of Wilder's inauguration festivities in January.
   Since the separation, which by all accounts was amicable, Mrs.
Kluge has been romantically linked to the 59-year-old Democrat.
Wilder says only that he is friends with the Kluges.
