   Grand Metropolitan PLC said it is negotiating the sale of its Intercontinental hotel chain to Seibu/Saison Group of Japan. 
Although London-based Grand Met didn't disclose the price under discussion, real estate executives in New York and London put it at about $2.3 billion. 

   A source close to Grand Met, a brewing, tobacco and hotel concern, said a signing could come as early as this weekend. 
However, he emphasized, "no final agreement" has been reached. 

   The Seibu/Saison group has hotel, real estate and retailing interests in Japan. 
It is run by Seiji Tsutsumi, whose brother, Yoshiaki, controls the Seibu railroad and was ranked by Forbes Magazine last July as the world's richest man, with a personal net worth of $18.9 billion. 

   The reported price for Intercontinental is close to the $2.5 billion that Grand Met said it was seeking when it announced an auction for Intercontinental last August. 
Analysts, at the time, said the asking price was far too high. 
The 100-hotel chain earned about $63 million in the year ending Sept. 30, 1987, and analysts estimate that it will earn $85 million this year. 

   However, glamorous hotels occupying prime real estate have lately been trading for far more than their business value. 
Intercontinental, based in Montvale, N.J., has choice hotels in Europe, the U.S., the Middle East and Far East. 

   Its best-known properties include the Grand and the Intercontinental in Paris; the Mayfair and the Intercontinental in London; the Carlton in Cannes, France; the Barclay in New York; and the Mark Hopkins in San Francisco. 

   Japanese buyers have fueled the inflation of hotel prices, especially in Hawaii and in California. 
Stephen Brener, a New York hotel consultant, said, "I don't know what these things are worth any more. 
People are paying crazy prices." 
Although Grand Met reviewed more than a dozen bids, no other serious bidder offered more than $2 billion, according to real estate industry sources. 

   Many bidders were unwilling to offer a higher price without a clear idea of what the individual hotels could be resold for. 
Intercontinental's breakup value is hard to discern because "a lot of its real estate is in markets which haven't had a lot of trades," one investment banker noted. 
And, some of the bidders said, its value was hard to figure because taxes and capital-repatriation laws in countries with Intercontinental hotels vary widely. 

   However, real estate sources said the prospective Japanese buyer could try to sell off some of Intercontinental's choicest hotels and then focus on increasing income from managing the properties. 
Earlier this year, Robert M. Bass Group Inc. purchased Westin Hotels &amp; Resorts for $1.53 billion and quickly sold two of the chain's hotels for half the total purchase price. 

   Grand Met plans to use proceeds to expand in consumer goods. 
People familiar with the company say that Allen Sheppard, its chairman, is eager to pursue liquor and food companies. 

   A spokesman at Grand Met said Mr. Sheppard "has said he is very keen to build up our drinks, foods and retailing interests. 
There are a lot of plans. 
It's certainly not a static company." 

   Grand Met shares rose three pence yesterday on London's stock exchange to close at 504 pence ($8.52). 

   Grand Met is battling for control of Dublin-based Irish Distillers against French drinks group Pernod-Ricard S.A., which has made an offer for Irish Distillers. 

   The Japanese group's interests include Seibu department stores, one of Japan's largest retailers, as well as consumer finance, restaurant chains and an insurance venture with Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.'s Allstate Insurance unit. 

   Grand Met is being represented by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
