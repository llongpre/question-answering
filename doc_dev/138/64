   Is there a smoking gun in the Michael Milken
affair?
   Government prosecutors would like nothing more than to produce
one in a special presentencing hearing for the junk-bond financier
that began this past week.
   But in the first day of the two-week show in Manhattan federal
court, no big bombshells dropped. Two government witnesses failed
to directly link Milken to the systematic stock manipulation
alleged by the government.
   The first round of testimony still managed to produce some news.
A trader for Milken's former employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
revealed he had a secret, middle-of-the-night meeting with Milken
after stock speculator Ivan Boesky turned state's evidence in 1986.
   Boesky, once one of Milken's regular customers, would become his
chief accuser.
   The ex-trader, Cary Maultasch, described a cloak-and-dagger
rendezvous with Milken at Drexel's office in Beverly Hills, Calif.
The pair spoke in hushed tones with a guard posted at the door.
Milken scribbled his most sensitive comments about Boesky on a pad
and erased them immediately, but Maultasch couldn't recall exactly
what was communicated.
   The ``mini-trial'' resumes Monday before Judge Kimba Wood, who
is trying to focus her image of Milken before pronouncing his
sentence. She ordered the hearing after the government and the
defense provided her with documents painting widely divergent
portraits of the ex-billionaire.
   The hearing covers a handful of allegations beyond the crimes
Milken admitted in his six-count guilty plea in April. Wood is
nevertheless limited to the maximum penalty of 28 yars in prison
prescribed in the plea bargain.
   The prosecution's case hangs on three transactions, in which it
claims Milken abused securities laws. The defense, led by attorney
Arthur Liman, will try to deflect those blows while promoting its
alternative image of Milken as a misunderstood genius of finance
and warm-hearted do-gooder.
   The hearing, although it takes the Milken chase into extra
innings, has left some observers less than excited because of its
limited scope.
   ``We will never have confidence in knowing what happened,'' said
Albert Alschuler, criminal law expert at the University of Chicago
Law School.

   As Milken ran the gantlet of photographers and reporters on his
way to court, he could at least take solace in the fact that he
remains one of the nation's wealthiest people.
   The latest ranking of Forbes magazine's 400 richest Americans
put the Californian at 115th, worth $700 million. That's a demotion
from his days as a billionaire, thanks to the $600 million
settlement included in his plea bargain.
   In general, the rich got poorer in the past year, according to
the magazine. Fifty-three of the Forbes 400 suffered net-worth
declines, ranging from $100 million to nearly $900 million.
   In contrast to Milken, most suffered at the hands of the
economy.
   For the first time in the eight years Forbes has been publishing
the register, the minimum fortune it took to make the grade
dropped, from $275 million in 1989 to $260 million.
   John Werner Kluge, the Metromedia tycoon, topped the list with
an estimated $5.6 billion.

<HEAD>TRUMP: Among the Richest No More</HEAD>

   One name missing from the Forbes ranking was Donald Trump, whose
1989 fortune of $1.7 billion has almost completely disappeared.
   Trump's troubles continued during the week with word that his
second book, ``Surviving at the Top,'' hadn't survived long on The
New York Times best-seller list. The paper said the book had fallen
off the list after only seven weeks. His first book, ``The Art of
the Deal,'' lingered 48 weeks on the list after it was introduced
in 1987.
   Trump was also reported to be negotiating new terms for loans on
two of his casinos in his continuing efforts to keep his gambling,
real estate and airline empire aloft.
   Takeover investor Carl Icahn (65th on the Forbes list at $1
billion) also emerged in the Trump storyline as a possible investor
in Trump's casino bonds. Reports said Icahn was snapping up the
sagging notes as a long-term investment.

<HEAD>MARKETS: The Market's Balloon Loses More Air</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bottom-fishing could become the sport of choice on Wall Street
as the stock market swoons.
   Over three successive days the market lost more than 6 percent,
as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks,
prompting The Wall Street Journal to proclaim the ``official''
arrival of the bear market.
   The Journal said that by falling below 2,400 on Thursday and
more than 20 percent over the past two months, the Dow had
fulfilled the classic requirements of a down market.
   Corporate earnings reinforced the market's pessimism. CBS Inc.
reported a 30 percent drop in third-quarter profits; Chemical
Banking posted a $43.7 million loss and slashed its dividend.
   Oil continued its relentless move upward, setting records above
the $40 per barrel mark on the futures exchange. Silver, meanwhile,
plummeted toward $4 per troy ounce.
   The silver slide heightened recession fears because it indicated
sinking industrial demand for the metal.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: Retailers Bemoan Mean Season</HEAD>

   The nation's retailers were slip-sliding toward Christmas with
bad tidings for thefall season.
   Their sales reports for September were grim; some even showed a
decline from year-ago levels. Worries about the economy and the
Persian Gulf crisis were mostly to blame, but the weather also
contributed. Warmer than normal temperatures dissauded some
consumers from shopping for winter clothing.
   The government reported that wholesale prices shot up 1.6
percent in September, led by an unprecedented 20.6 percent leap in
gasoline.

<HEAD>SATURN: Hope for the Americans</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The great American hope for battling foreign auto imports rolled
out of a Spring Hill, Tenn., plant.
   General Motors Corp. introduced its new fuel-efficient,
affordable Saturn line of cars with predictions that two-thirds of
future sales would come at the expense of GM's competitors,
including the Japanese.
   But analysts were concerned about the other third, which would
come out of GM's own hide. The cars go on sale Oct. 25, at base
prices ranging from $7,995 to $11,775.
