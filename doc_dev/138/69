   Chairman Lee Iacocca went to school,
   He wanted to groove on that golden rule.
   Got to rapping with the gang
   And the Rich Academy guys gave him some slang:
   ``He left Ford Motor Company with a plan on the double.
   Became Chrysler's CEO, found out they were in trouble.
   He designed a new automobile, they called the `K.'
   His new car and charming wit surely saved the day.''
   Student Chris Longino got in the entrepreneurial way:
   ``I'm going to keep this (song). I might make some money off
this one day.''
   Translated: The Chrysler Corp. chairman visited the 9-year-old
alternative school on Thursday. During his visit, Longino and
fellow student Aaron Bolton performed their ``Iacocca Rap.''

   Singer Billy Joel won the first round of a $90
million lawsuit he filed against his former manager.
   State Judge Edward Lehner ordered the ex-manager, Frank Weber,
to pay the singer $2 million that Joel contended was stolen from
him. Lehner also said Joel was entitled to go to trial on another
set of claims against Weber.
   Joel contends that Weber took $30 million from him in
unauthorized management commissions, investments in companies Weber
controlled and other alleged embezzlements.
   Joel also is seeking $60 million in punitive damages from Weber,
according to Joel's lawyer, Leonard Marks.
   In the written opinion Thursday, Lehner dismissed Weber's claim
that he had an oral agreement to pay $2 million back to Joel.
   Marks said he contacted Joel in London and told the singer of
the judge's decision.
   ``Billy is absolutely delighted with this result and regards it
as a first-round knockout,'' he said.
   Marks said he expected the case to go to trial in six months to
a year.
   Weber's attorney, Anthony Conforti, could not be reached for
comment Friday because he was on vacation, according to a secretary
at his Long Island office.

   Donald Trump had his alleged mistress Marla
Maples move in next door to him at Trump Tower, much to the dismay
of his estranged wife, Ivana, a newspaper reported Friday.
   ``I am shocked and saddened that Donald could subject me and the
children to such shameful behavior,'' Mrs. Trump said, according to
gossip columnist Liz Smith's account in the Daily News.
   Ms. Maples moved into the building in December, Smith said, and
has evaded the past 5{ weeks of intensive media scrutiny by using a
side entrance and taking the service elevator directly to her
63rd-floor apartment.
   After Trump's separation from his wife became public in
February, Trump moved in across the hall from Ms. Maples, Smith
said.
   It was reported Thursday that Trump was ``dropping'' Ms. Maples.
But Smith called this a ruse designed to ``soften up'' Mrs. Trump
and prevent her from making legal moves that might embarrass the
billionaire tycoon before he goes before the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission on Thursday.
   Trump is seeking final license approval for the Taj Mahal, his
mega-casino slated to open April 5 in Atlantic City.
   Trump's spokesman has refused to comment on the alleged affair.
Ms. Maples' spokesman has said the aspiring actress' relationship
with Trump was never more than a friendship.

   Miss America Debbye Turner says she
entered beauty pageants repeatedly and refused to listen to critics
who told her a black woman would never win the national contest.
   She also said she was undeterred when the same critics scoffed
at her for being a devout Christian and a marimba player.
   Ms. Turner, who won the title last September in Atlantic City,
told high school students Thursday that her example should show
everybody that all dreams are attainable.
   She said she entered pageants repeatedly, and had two runner-up
finishes in Arkansas, before winning the Miss Missouri title and
qualifying to go to Atlantic City.
   ``I said, `Alright, God, do you want me to do this?'' Ms. Turner
recalled. ``What's important about the story is, no, I didn't give
up.''
   Ms. Turner said afterward that she has delivered much the same
speech to dozens of school audiences, but that the message of
motivating youth to high achievement has remained fresh.
   ``Although it's the hundredth time, I'm doing something I
sincerely believe in,'' she said.

   Patricia Kluge, whose husband, John,
was ranked America's richest man by Forbes magazine, said his
billions have not changed her life dramatically.
   ``Even though I'm aware that we live a magnificent life and we
have magnificent friends around the world ... I'm still my mother's
daughter, my brothers' sister and my family's child,'' Mrs. Kluge
said Thursday. ``I still see myself as the girl I always was.''
   The one-time model married Kluge in 1981. They have lived a
largely secluded life on a palatial Albemarle County estate. Kluge
surpassed Wal-Mart executive Sam Walton as Forbes's richest man
last year.
