   The business glossies are increasingly using an
old strategy to hook the listless reader.
   Fortune and Forbes began promoting their latest editions Monday
with the most elaborate lists yet of the world's biggest companies,
ranked in categories ranging from sales to pofits to nationality.
   Officials of the twice-monthly magazines, which both report
circulation in well in excess of 700,000, said the timing was
strictly coincidence. But it came a few days after Business Week,
the leading weekly business periodical with 980,000 circulation,
produced its own list of leading worldwide companies.
   ``The list phenomenon is certainly not new, it just seems like
it's reaching new heights or new lengths,'' said James Gentry,
director of the business journalism progam at the University of
Missouri School of Journalism.
   Part of the reason for the profusion of lists, he suggested, is
``not letting anybody one-up you. If Business Week designs
something, Fortune and Forbes will do something.''
   For the first time, Fortune produced the ``Fortune Global 500.''
The list of industrial companies replaced its ``International 500''
ranking of foreign concerns by combining that list and the
``Fortune 500'' list of biggest U.S. industrial companies, the
granddaddy of rankings first published in 1955.
   Fortune's new global list ranked General Motors Corp. as the
largest industrial concern, based on 1989 sales of $126.97 billion,
followed by Ford Motor Co. with sales of $96.93 billion and Exxon
Corp. at $86.66 billion.
   The highest-ranking foreign company was No. 4 Royal Dutch-Shell
Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil concern, at $85.53 billion.
   At the same time, Forbes released its annual ``Forbes
International 500,'' which ranked the size of big foreign companies
and put the Japanese trading giant Sumitomo Corp. first with 1989
sales of $158 billion.
   The Forbes list, dominated by Japanese companies, was
embellished by an ``International Super 50'' ranking, described as
the 50 most powerful foreign companies as measured by a mix of
sales, profits, assets and market value. The magazine included its
list of the world's billionaires in the same issue.
   ``We feel we do it best of all,'' said Forbes spokesman Ray
Healey. ``We just don't give them the companies. We give them the
billionaires that run these companies. We give people a complete
package. Our competitors give people a half package.''
   Not so, said Fortune Managing Editor Marshall Loeb, who called
his magazine's list the most informative, easiest to read and
up-to-date.
   ``I don't want to knock their list, I just want to talk about
our list,'' he said. ``It's the only one that presents the 500
industrial corporations in the whole world by gauging size, that
is, the sales of the company.''
   Fortune and Forbes have assembled increasingly elaborate lists
in recent years. Besides the wealthiest people and the biggest
companies, list topics have ranged from best cities for business to
highest-paid executives.
   Both magazines also have peddled their lists more aggressively
in advance of publication, not only as news events to attract
additional readers but as a selling point to potential advertisers.
   The Fortune list is in July 30 issues and the Forbes list is in
July 23 issues. Both were released several days in advance of their
appearance on newsstands.
   In the current climate of weak advertising revenue in the U.S.
magazine industry, the foreign-theme lists have taken on a more
important role for the business glossies. Foreign companies,
particularly from Japan, have enormous amounts of money to spend on
promotion and actively are sought as advertisers.
   The Fortune issue, for example, contains an 81-page special
advertising supplement on Japanese businesses. Magazine spokeswoman
Emma Dockendorff called it the single biggest special ad section in
the magazine's history. Forbes included a 16-page supplement on
U.S.-German business.
