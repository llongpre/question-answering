   The largest private U.S. companies' sales have
doubled since 1985, due in large part to a dramatic rise in the
number of leveraged buyouts, Forbes magazine reports.
   But despite the huge shift as publicly-held companies turn
private, Minneapolis-based Cargill, a commodities marketer,
maintained a firm grip on the number one spot for the sixth
straight year of the Forbes annual ranking, with revenues of $44
billion last year.
   As companies continued to move up in the ranks in sales, one
prominent private-company billionaire - Donald Trump - dropped off
the ``Forbes 400'' list of the richest Americans, as his recent
financial woes have dramatically diminished his net worth.
   Among companies, Cargill's total sales were nearly triple the
sales of second-ranked Wichita, Kan.-based Koch Industries, a
petroleum, natural gas and chemicals firm with an estimated $17.2
billion in sales.
   All told, the Forbes list of top private firms in the Dec. 10
edition showed that sales of the biggest 400 companies increased
from $340 billion when the list was first started in 1985 to $609
billion last year. In 1989 the figure totaled $592 billion.
   Helping to boost the jump in sales, 120 of those firms have been
taken private in leveraged buyouts, including such giants as R.H.
Macy, RJR Nabisco, Trans World Airlines and the parents of Revlon
and Northwest Airlines.
   Forbes reported that 48 of the 400 largest companies are based
in New York -more than any other city.
   Chicago remains in second place on the ``Forbes 400'' list with
25 companies, followed by Dallas with 21 companies and Los Angeles
with nine. Detroit, Houston and San Francisco share fifth place
with seven firms each.
   The top state for private firms is New York with 65 companies.
However, California moved up fast in the ranks, in second place
with 42 companies up from seven last year. Texas is in third place
with 39 firms, followed by Illinois with 29 and Florida with 20.
