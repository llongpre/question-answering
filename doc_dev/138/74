<HEAD>Richest Man Supports Income Tax Hike with Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>

   John W. Kluge, a Virginia billionaire listed by Forbes magazine
as the richest man in America, said Thursday he favors an increase
in the nation's top income tax rate if the capital gains tax is
reduced.
   ``I recognize that the budget deficit must be reduced and that
issues of tax fairness are prominent in the minds of many
Americans,'' Kluge, 76, said in a telephone interview with AP
Network News, a broadcasting operation of The Associated Press.
   ``To address both of those concerns, I personally would favor
raising the top income tax rate to 33 percent as a part of a
package that included a meaningful reduction in capital gains
tax,'' Kluge said.
   For some time, Kluge said, U.S. businesses have been hampered by
the high cost of capital, ``especially when compared to businesses
in Japan and many European countries.''
   ``I believe that the most effective way to bring down the cost
of capital would be to reduce the rate at which capital gains are
taxed,'' he said. ``The president and many members of the Senate
and the House of Reresentatives share that view.''
   Kluge said tax laws should be written ``to foster and encourage
the American genius for creating new businesses and new jobs. I
firmly believe that the best way to further that goal would be a
lowered tax on capital gains for small and large businesses.''
   Kluge said most people reinvest money from capital gains.
   ``Money just doesn't stay at the sidelines,'' he said. ``It
seems to me that if one is to risk capital, there has to be an
incentive. If there is no incentive to risk capital, why even try
to make an investment? You might as well live off interest on
money.''
   Kluge (pronounced kloogy), owns a 10,000-acre farm near
Charlottesville, Va. and is worth about $5.6 billion, Forbes
estimated in its 1990 ranking of richest Americans released earlier
this month.
   He was speaking from his office at Metromedia Co., the business
he founded and the basis for his fortune. Years ago he sold the
company's radio and television properties for $4.65 billion and
netted more than $1.6 billion.
   Since then, Kluge has invested his profits into other interests,
including cellular telephones and restaurants. He owns the
Ponderosa Steak House, Bonanza and Steak &amp; Ale chains. He recently
sold his New York cellular operations for more than $1 billion in
cash and $850 million in stock.
