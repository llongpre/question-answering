   It was a public relations coup that would have
made their late chairman proud.
   The editors at Forbes magazine tried to upstage competitor
Fortune this week by issuing a new and improved list of America's
biggest companies the same day Fortune trotted out its latest
edition of the venerable 500.
   It was the kind of rascality that made the late Malcolm Forbes
famous. He was no doubt smiling down on the effort, which the
Forbes staff managed to pull off before the magazine containing the
list was even off the presses.
   Not since Forbes parodied its other main competitor, Business
Week, by spoofing its cover for a 1987 issue on executive pay has
the business-mag competition produced such high jinks.
   Forbes spokesman Ray Healey must have had tongue in cheek when
he explained in a telephone interview that the simultaneous release
of dueling Forbes and Fortune lists was simply ``a coincidence.''
   Like it's pure accident when Time and Newsweek have the same
cover story on, say, Madonna.
   Healey, who handles press relations for Forbes magazine, was
able to get the jump on the competition through a combination of
slick packaging and logistical wizardry.
   First, the magazine distinguished its list of 500 big companies
with a so-called ``Super 50,'' described as the most powerful firms
over a broad spectrum.
   That was to differentiate the Forbes list from Fortune's, a list
of the 500 largest industrial firms ranked by sales. Forbes rated
all public companies _ retailers, financial services,
manufacturers, you name it _ by sales, profits, assets and stock
market value.
   Second, Healey crunched a version of the Forbes list on his
personal computer, copied it to a computer diskette and dispatched
press kits to the news media before the magazine was printed. The
information on the diskette could be dumped directly into a news
agency's computer system, eliminating the need to hand-punch the
data from the list.
   Fortune, filling the role of tortoise to Forbes' hare, sent
copies of the actual magazine to the press along with other facts
about the 500 in paper press releases.
   The result? Both lists got the ink their creators sought,
although perhaps not in the manner they envisioned. The Associated
Press, for instance, led its story on the lists by noting the
obvious competition between the two.
   At least they agreed on who's on first. General Motors Corp.,
the only company with more than $100 billion in annual sales, led
both the Fortune and the Forbes rankings.
   But you need more than fast footwork to make real news with a
list. While Forbes grabbed a headline with its nifty 50, Fortune is
sure to have the last laugh.
   ``Fortune has been at the 500 for years and years. It's part of
the language,'' observed Fortune Managing Editor Marshall Loeb.
   ``Forbes has been anxiously and eagerly trying to catch up with
us,'' he said. ``But frankly, I've never heard anyone in
conversation say, `We're part of the Forbes 500.'''
   The Fortune editor is exactly right. Once something is
established as a standard, it's hard to push aside. That's why we
still measure in feet, not meters, or why a coach advises a kid to
eat his Wheaties, not Total.
   It's not that the Forbes list is any less ambitious or
newsworthy than Fortune's. Forbes, in a sense, does more than
Fortune by measuring companies on four separate scales.
   It's just that for some lists the franchise is locked up.
Fortune has the 500. Business Week has its executive pay survey.
Forbes, for its part, has the richest 400 Americans. No substitutes
will do.
   Of course, that won't stop the list purveyors from purveying
more lists. It seems as if every other issue delivers a fresh
register for us to peruse.
   Some journalists would say the public is definitely overlisted,
but the appetite for such trivia appears insatiable. Malcolm
Forbes, himself, must share part of the blame for this lopsided
demand curve. He was the one at Forbes several years ago who
dreamed up the richest 400 _ against the vociferous protests of
some Forbes staffers, Healey notes.
   Three decades after Fortune spawned the list business with its
first 500, news magazines have turned the ranking of the biggest
and richest into a cottage industry _ and lists have become the
Doritos of business journalism.
   So crunch all you want. They'll make more.
