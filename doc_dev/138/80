   Israel's leaders imposed curfews in the
occupied lands and mobilized troops today after police opened fire
on Palestinians who rioted at holy sites in the Old City, killing
at least 19 Arabs and wounding 140.
   Palestinian leaders in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip
demanded U.N. protection and announced a weeklong protest strike
beginning today, the start of the 36th month of the anti-Israeli
uprising in the territories.
   Monday's incident at the Temple Mount, which is sacred to both
Moslems and Jews, forced the Palestinian question back onto the
international agenda.
   It was the bloodiest clash in Jerusalem since the 1967 Middle
East war, when Israel seized the city's eastern Arab sector and the
West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip from Egypt.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - David H. Souter, a mild-mannered, well-read
and previously little-known judge from New Hampshire, becomes
history's 105th Supreme Court justice today after pledging to ``do
equal right to the poor and to the rich.''
   Souter, 51, planned to take the judicial oath, administered by
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and almost immediately get to
work hearing high court arguments with his eight new colleagues.
   The oath requires Souter to ``solemnly swear to administer
justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to the poor
and to the rich.''
   Afterward, Souter and Rehnquist planned to pose for
photographers outside the building on Capitol Hill before heading
back inside to take their seats on the bench for the start of the
court's regularly scheduled proceedings.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The super-rich are getting a dose of what many
Americans already know: rougher economic times.
   Fifty-three of the nation's 400 richest people suffered declines
in net worth this year ranging from $100 million to $880 million,
Forbes magazine said in its Oct. 22 edition.
   For the first time since Forbes began publishing the list in
1982, the minimum net worth required to join the elite ranking
dropped, from $275 million last year to $260 million.
   Among marquee names evicted from the list was Donald Trump, who
symbolized the 1980s era of living on borrowed money. Forbes said
Trump's fortune, estimated at $1.7 billion in 1989, was possibly
within ``hailing distance of zero'' because of looming loan
deadlines and a slow economy.

   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - The son of former Gov. Scott M. Matheson
believes the open-air atomic testing whose dangers his father
fought to expose caused the cancer that killed him.
   Matheson died Sunday at age 61 of multiple myeloma. He lived in
Cedar City in the early 1950s when the government conducted dozens
of above-ground tests 300 miles away in Nevada that caused
radioactive fallout to drift into Utah.
   As governor from 1977 to 1985, Matheson fought to expose the
dangers of those tests and gain compensation for radiation victims
- an effort that succeeded with the passage by Congress last week
of a compensation bill.
   Scott M. Matheson Jr. said Monday his father found it an
``interesting wrinkle'' that he was diagnosed with a disease that
Congress recognized as having possible links to atomic fallout.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Secretary of State James A. Baker III is
switching back to Cold War-era language in an effort to defeat a
House move to cut off U.S. aid to anti-communist rebels in Angola.
   In a private memo he sent recently to House Minority Leader
Robert Michel, R-Ill., Baker said ending aid to the Angolan rebels
would derail peace negotiations ``and would be a vote for more
killing, more stalemate and more suffering.''
   This is ``the absolutely worst time'' to halt the aid, Baker
said.
   The United States has been providing covert aid to the UNITA
rebels in the southwest African country since 1986, but
congressional sentiment against continued assistance seems to be
increasing.
