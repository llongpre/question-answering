   Malcolm Forbes, the self-proclaimed ``capitalist
tool'' of business publishing who used the world as a stage for his
lavish parties and ballooning exploits, was mourned as one who
reveled in life and free enterprise.
   ``Death happens to everyone but we never believed it would
happen to him; he always defied the odds,'' son Malcolm ``Steve''
Jr., who will succeed his father as head of the publishing empire,
said Sunday.
   ``What he wanted inscribed on his tombstone says it all: `While
alive, he lived.'''
   Forbes died of a heart attack while sleeping Saturday at his
40-acre estate in Far Hills, N.J. He was 70.
   ``I feel like a great light has been turned off,'' said
Elizabeth Taylor, a frequent companion of Forbes. ``He was one of
the best friends I ever had.''
   ``I don't know anyone who enjoyed life so much or gave so much
back,'' said Barbara Walters, who partied with billionaire
developer Donald Trump, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and some 1,000 other guests at
Forbes' $2 million, 70th birthday bash last fall in Tangier,
Morocco.
   Various estimates placed the worth of Forbes, chairman and chief
shareholder of Forbes Inc., at anywhere from $400 million to $1
billion.
   Whatever the amount, Forbes gleefully relished his riches.
   He made the first free flight over Beijing in a hot-air balloon
and set six world ballooning records. He owned 68 motorcycles and
made the first motorcycle tour of China. He globe-trotted with
movie stars and heads of state aboard his gold-fixtured,
helicopter-equipped yacht, the Highlander.
   But he also was gracious to everyday folks like Libby Rook, a
management consultant from Vienna, Va., who marked her 44th
birthday aboard the Highlander in 1987 after writing to Forbes on a
dare from co-workers.
   ``It's not how much money you have but what you do with it,''
Forbes once told the Star-Ledger in Newark. ``The joy of living is
incredible. We work hard at the things we have to do, so why not
take time to enjoy the things we want to do?''
   Forbes was a tireless collector, accumulating toy soldiers by
the battalion and buying up a dozen Faberge eggs, the hand-crafted
artworks of Imperial Russia.
   He was an enthusiastic champion of free enterprise and
emblazoned his corporate slogan, ``Capitalist Tool,'' on his
helicopters, balloons, even his clothing and luggage.
   ``He was a real free spirit,'' said opera star Beverly Sills,
who sang ``Happy Birthday'' at the Moroccan party. ``He had such a
joy of life. I think he would have had it if he had been a poor
man.''
   ``Malcolm Forbes was someone who lived life to its fullest and
in doing so made all of our lives a little more colorful,'' said
Iacocca.
   ``He was the quintessential American _ optimistic, buoyant and
lots of fun,'' said Kissinger.
   Forbes was born in Englewood, N.J., on Aug. 19, 1919, two years
after his father, Scottish emigrant Bertie Charles Forbes, founded
Forbes magazine.
   He graduated from Princeton in 1941, then published two weekly
newspapers in Ohio for a year. He enlisted in the Army in 1942, was
wounded in combat and received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.
   Forbes won a seat on the Borough Council in Bernardsville, N.J.
in 1949. He served in the state Senate from 1951 to 1957 and ran
for governor of New Jersey in 1957, losing to Robert B. Meyner.
   After his father's death in 1954, he became publisher and editor
in chief of Forbes. The biweekly magazine, which offered a more
personalized account of business news than its competitors, rode
the 1980s bull market and the pro-business Reagan era to the
greatest success since its founding.
   Experts valued the company's flagship magazine as high as $600
million, while its American Heritage magazine, suburban newspaper,
real estate and art holdings almost add $100 million or more.
   ``He was a hell of a competitor and a promotional genius,'' said
Stephen Shepard, editor in chief of Business Week magazine.
   ``He was a worthy competitor, certainly _ tough, charming, very,
very effective,'' said Marshall Loeb, managing editor of Fortune.
   ``He was unique and larger than life as a journalist,
entrepreneur and human being,'' said Warren H. Phillips, chairman
and chief executive of Dow Jones &amp; Co., which publishes The Wall
Street Journal.
   Malcolm Forbes Jr. will succeed his father as chairman and chief
executive of Forbes, Inc., and editor in chief of Forbes magazine.
He formerly was president and chief operating officer of Forbes,
Inc., and deputy editor in chief.
   ``Father _ Pop _ always looked to the future,'' said Malcolm Jr.
``He wanted this to remain a family business and it shall. As he
wished, and as the family wishes, I will succeed him as chief
executive. We will continue to move ahead as he was doing.''
   The younger Forbes said his father's body would be cremated and
the ashes buried at the Forbes-owned Pacific island of Lucala in
Fiji, in line with his wishes.
   The immediate family will hold a private service today at an
undisclosed location in New Jersey. A public memorial service was
scheduled for 11 a.m. Thursday at St. Bartholomew's Church in
Manhattan.
   In addition to his former wife, Roberta Laidlaw, and Malcolm
Jr., survivors include sons Robert, Christopher and Timothy, a
daughter, Moira Mumma, a brother, Wallace and eight grandchildren.
