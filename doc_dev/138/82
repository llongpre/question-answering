FT  29 MAY 93 / Seriously Rich: Neat and discreet - Tokyo

AS THE vibrating barber's chair was tilted back, the obviously wealthy
executive snored gently.
The self-consciously elite barber, near the Imperial Hotel in central Tokyo,
does not bother to post his prices on a board. It is a system much like that
of the better class of Japanese bar.
Mama-san decides when you walk in how much you will pay. On the way out, the
price is ornately scribbled on a slip of paper. Depending on the amount, it
is either an invitation to return or an expensive warning that this classy
establishment is not for the likes of you.
Riches are meant to be enjoyed discreetly in Japan. It is the gangster who
buys a large white Cadillac with tinted back windows and it is the upstart
property developer who boasts an over-powered speed boat.
The truly rich person prefers to indulge behind the drawn screens of a
ryotei, where the watered-down whiskies come in monogrammed glasses and the
services rendered are less important than the promise of prestige.
Feeling rich, and doing it with dignity, is more important in Japan that
possessing a pile of large denomination notes.
The yen of the seemingly wealthy is often that of the expense account;
collateralised assets are sometimes no more than a small patch of
undeveloped dirt in a strategic Toyko location.
Land buys money in Japan. Taikichiro Mori, the recently deceased tycoon who
headed Forbes magazine's list of the world's richest business people, was
the wealthiest of all because he had the most land.
Mori, worth an estimated Dollars 13bn, owned 82 buildings through his
private company, Mori Building, which remade a district in central Tokyo.
Mori and the like-minded founders of Honda Motor and Matsushita Electric
combined an apparent disdain for riches with a remarkable ability to create
and accumulate wealth.
Given that their wealth was made during the decades of post-war
reconstruction, it is not surprising that this generation, which prided
itself on 'making things,' should be aghast at the instant wealth frothed-up
during the bubble years of the late 1980s, when stock prices seemingly
defied gravity.
In his memoirs, a conscious-stricken Mori told of early discomfort at
receiving rental and interest payments: 'I became sceptical about receiving
unearned income from the renting business.'
That was not the case with Yasumichi Morishita, a financier and stock
speculator, famed for his purchases of Impressionist art during the bubble
era, when Japanese imports of art topped Y15bn (Pounds 88.23m) a year. In
the years since, art imports have fallen 80 per cent and Morishita's small
network of companies has gone bust.
Not only the shady Morishita liked the idea of sophistication. Men and women
of lesser means bought golf club memberships during the late 1980s in the
hope of feeling rich, and with an eye to reselling the certificates at a
profit. But clubs which promised the most prestige have brought the greatest
disappointment.
The Gentry Hills Golf Club has collapsed, membership prices at the Classic
Golf Club have fallen 78 per cent, and the Gatsby Golf Club issued 15 times
more memberships than promised, meaning that the certificates were devalued
and the fairways very crowded.
The bubble may have burst, and the old industrial class may be chuckling,
but the fondness for prestige has not diminished. Even if golf club
memberships remains out of reach, there is still Gatsby hair mousse or gel,
advertised in gawky English as 'highly valuable cosmetic.' Brand names are
still an important accessory for the wealthy.
La Tour d'Argent, which prides itself on being the country's most expensive
French restaurant, says the collapse of stock prices has yet to dull the
pampered palate.
Business entertaining accounts for about 30 per cent of its trade and
'common people can't really afford to have dinner here' anyway.
The bill would be no trouble for Hiromasa Ezoe, the founder of Recruit, a
business information company at the centre of a stocks-for-favours political
scandal in 1989. Ezoe, who goes to court once a week for ongoing hearings,
topped the list of Japan's taxpayers last year, paying Y3.96bn after
confessing to making a large profit on a share deal.
Now that he has lost control of Recruit and has the prospect of a jail
sentence to concentrate his mind, a more contemplative Ezoe has concluded
that 'joy exists in the process of gaining assets, not in the assets
themselves.'
