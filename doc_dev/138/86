   Michael Milken, sentenced to 10 years in prison
for securities and tax violations, is no longer a billionaire. But
he remains one of the country's richest people.
   His net worth was estimated in October by Forbes magazine at
$700 million, good enough for 115th place on the register of
America's 400 wealthiest people.
   That's after paying $600 million in fines and restitution as
part of his guilty plea to six felonies in April. Forbes also
estimated that he lost $250 million from the collapse of the
junk-bond market and his employer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year.
   At Drexel, Milken made more than $1.1 billion from 1983-87,
including $550 million in 1987 alone. But he faces more than 50
civil lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in damages as a result
of his wrongdoing and Drexel's collapse. And he was sentenced to
prison Friday.
