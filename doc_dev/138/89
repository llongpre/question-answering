   NEW YORK -- One of the richest men in America is getting
the richest advance ever for the memoirs of a businessman,
and he's giving it all to charity. That's Sam Walton for you.
   Mr. Walton, the folksy 73-year-old chairman of Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., became the biggest retailer in America, starting
with a single store in Arkansas in 1962. After a frenzied
auction here this week involving half a dozen publishers, his
memoirs were acquired by Doubleday for more than $4 million,
publishing sources say -- a staggering sum in tough times for
publishers.

   While the memoirs of actor Marlon Brando and Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf each fetched more than $5 million last year, the
amount for the Walton book is unprecedented for a business
biography. The most successful business memoir -- and
best-selling nonfiction book ever in hardcover -- was the
autobiography of Lee Iacocca, who reportedly received
$150,000 in advance. Since then, publishers have paid bigger
advances for other business books, but none at the level of
the Walton book.
   Making the Walton deal even more unusual and riskier is
the absence of the usual "unacceptable manuscript" clause,
which allows a publisher to reject a book it deems
substandard.
   Publishers expressed surprise and even alarm at the high
advance, but said it shows that publishers feel compelled to
gamble for big hits in a slow time. "This is the book
equivalent of `Hook,'" said Howard Kaminsky, chairman of
Hearst Corp.'s book-publishing division, referring to the
movie that reportedly cost more than $80 million to produce.
"We dropped out at less than $2 million," Mr. Kaminsky added.
"At this price, every single thing has to work, and to me,
the risk seemed bigger than the reward. It's working without
a net."
   Other publishers estimated that the book will have to sell
at least one million copies in hardcover to break even for
Doubleday, a unit of Bertelsmann AG's Bantam Doubleday Dell
Publishing Group Inc. But even some of the other bidders for
the book are optimistic that it will. "I think Sam Walton is
one-of-a-kind, and therefore it's possible that he may be
worth it," said Susan Moldau, associate publisher of
HarperCollins Publishers, which reportedly dropped out at
about $3.5 million. "He appeals to two diverse audiences you
normally don't bridge: the business audience and the vast
number of middle Americans who shop in his stores."
   The book, which is due to be published in the fall, is
being co-authored by John Huey, a senior editor at Fortune
magazine and former Wall Street Journal editor. Mr. Huey's
fee wasn't disclosed.
   Bill Barry, the deputy publisher of Doubleday, who
acquired the book, said: "I'm confident we'll earn back the
advance we paid. This is a guy who overtook Sears &amp; Roebuck
in size and became a billionaire, but he drives a pickup
truck and he's shared his success with his 350,000 employees.
I think he's an antidote to the business pirates of the '80s
and people will want to read about that."
   Nabbing this memoir has been a mission of Mr. Barry's for
more than four years. The editor started deluging the
publicity-shy Mr. Walton with letters in 1987. Mr. Walton
eventually decided he would do his autobiography and accepted
a reported advance of about $500,000 in 1988, but backed out
after several chapters were delivered, having discovered that
he was suffering from bone cancer. "He returned the advance,
with interest, and apologized," said Mr. Barry. "I've been
pursuing him ever since, and he finally decided to go ahead."
   Hearst's Mr. Kaminsky said he doesn't expect the lack of a
clause allowing Doubleday to reject the book will set a
precedent. "This is a man whose bona fides are remarkable
when it comes to being upright," said Mr. Kaminsky. "I guess
at this stage of his life, Mr. Walton didn't want to have a
book turned down, and I don't blame him."
