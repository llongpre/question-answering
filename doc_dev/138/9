   Charity began at home for Wal-Mart stores
founder Sam Walton, who ended a four-year reign as Forbes
magazine's richest American by sharing his $9 billion fortune with
his four children.
   Metromedia Co. Chairman John Werner Kluge, with an estimated net
worth of $5.2 billion, climbed into first place on Forbes' annual
list of the nation's 400 wealthiest people.
   The prototypical member of Forbes' ultra-rich was a 63-year-old
male with 3.1 children working on his 1.4th marriage with a net
worth of $672 million last year, more than the gross national
product of Lesotho, Forbes said.
   The compilation contains 346 men and 54 women. Of those, 159
inherited their wealth. Eight states lack a resident on the list.
   Among alma mater represented, Yale educated 22 of the richest,
Harvard 17 and the University of Pennsylvania 12; the 45 with
master's degrees in business had an average net worth of $895
million, while the 10 high-school dropouts had an average of $854
million.
   Overall, Forbes' richest are worth an estimated total of about
$269 billion, up nearly $50 billion from last year, a 22 percent
increase that substantially outpaced last year's 4.4 percent
inflation rate.
   That total wealth would come just short of bailing out te
nation's failed savings and loans over the next 30 years, the cost
of which was estimated by Congress at $285 billion.
   The list, released Monday, appears in the Oct. 23 issue of
Forbes and is based on estimated holdings as of Sept. 8.
   At the pinnacle is Kluge, 75, of Charlottesville, Va., whose
holdings rose an estimated $2 billion from the previous year thanks
to a tripling in the value of his investment in cellular
telephones, Forbes said.
   Kluge moved up from the No. 2 spot. The magazine noted that
``klug'' in German means smart.
   Walton, 71, of Bentonville, Ark., who milked cows during the
Depression to support his family, split his Wal-Mart and other
assets equally with his four children. While the family's total
holdings increased from $6.7 bilion, the individual family members
tied for 20th on the list, each at $1.8 billion.
   Moving up to second from 12th place is investor Warren Buffett,
59, of Omaha, Neb., the head of Berkshire Hathaway, whose stock
market-based fortune nearly doubled, to $4.2 billion. Behind him is
Sumner M. Redstone, head of moviehouse operator National Amusements
Inc. and TV-cable giant Viacom, with $2.88 billion.
   The number of billionaires increased to 66 from 51. The minimum
net worth to make the list rose to $275 million from $225 million.
   America has more billionaires than any other nation _ Japan is
second with 41 _ but the richest of the world's rich are foreigners.
   Kluge's fortune makes him the ninth-wealthiest private
individual in the world, according to Forbes. He is topped by six
Japanese, a South Korean and Canadian publisher Kenneth Roy
Thompson. Japan's Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, who made his money in land,
railroads and resorts, is worth about $15 billion, making him the
richest, Forbes said.
   Eighteen new billionaires joined the Forbes American list,
including Laurence and Robert Tisch of Loews Corp. at $1.36 billion
apiece, entertainment mogul Kirk Kerkorian at $1.29 billion,
indicted junk bond financier Michael Milken at $1.27 billion and
Trans World Airlines Inc. boss Carl Icahn at $1.2 billion.
   Donald Trump also is among the individual standouts, adding $700
million to his empire of hotels, casinos and an airline for a $1.7
billion total.
   For the second straight year, the youngest self-made billionaire
is 33-year-old William Gates III at $1.25 billion. Gates dropped
out of Harvard to found Microsoft, a computer software company, in
1972.
   St. Louis beer and baseball magnate August Anheuser Busch Jr.,
who died Sept. 29 at age 90, is included on the list with $1.5
billion. Forbes said it compiled its profiles before he died.
   The youngest person on the list is Caroline Marie Getty, 32,
daughter of the late George Getty, with her $330 million
inheritance. The oldest remained 94-year-old Mansfield Freeman of
Greensboro, Vt., whose $360 million worth includes a stake in
insurer American International Group.
   Among the losers were real estate investor and builder Fred
Trammell Crow, whose net worth, Forbes estimated, sank to $300
million from $775 million, thanks to softness in commercial real
estate. Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione slipped into something
less comfortable and dropped off the list.
   About 20 percent, or 82, of those listed live in or near New
York City; Los Angeles is second with 32 and San Francisco third at
19. Twenty-one people on the list own at least one-third of a major
league sports franchise.
   Publisher Malcolm Forbes included his own biographical data and
outside reported estimates of his net worth but refused, as usual,
to divulge his wealth. Forbes' sketch was included in the under
$500 million category. ``I'm solvent,'' he said.
