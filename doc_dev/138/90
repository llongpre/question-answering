   Billionaire magazine publisher Malcolm
Forbes celebrates his 70th birthday today with a party for 700 of
his rich and famous friends.
   The guest list includes stars, socialities, princes, publishers,
a former president, a couple of ex-kings and, of course, close chum
Elizabeth Taylor.
   Forbes is throwing the party at his palace in this playground of
the wealthy and plans to use three planes _ including the supersonic
Concorde and his own Boeing 727, ``The Capitalist Tool'' _ to
shuttle in the lucky swells.
   The publisher of Forbes magazine is estimated to be worth $1
billion. The cost of his party has been reported to be $2 million.
   The balding and bespectacled dean of jet-setters is perhaps best
known for his iron-man endurance of the social swirl and his
much-publicized fascination with motorcyles and hot-air ballooning.
He even gave a purple Harley-Davidson to Miss Taylor, to match her
mauve eyes.
   Invitations to his birthday party have been coveted by glitterati
for months.
   Those lucky enough to receive them include former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger and former President Jimmy Carter. Greek
shipowner Stavros Niarchos will be in the company of two former
kings, Constantine of Greece and Simeon of Bulgaria, along with
opera diva Beverly Sills.
   Forbes also invited media colleagues such as television
personalities Walter Cronkite and Barbara Walters, and publishers
Katharine Graham, Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell.
   Other jet set guests include fashion designer Calvin Klein,
tobacco heiress Doris Duke and American politicians from both sides
of the aisle. New York developer Donald Trump also is expected.
   The setting for tonight's party is the Mendoub palace, once the
digs of the royal governor.
   The palace, one of several of Forbes' dwellings around the world,
serves most of the time as a museum. Housing his collection of tin
soldiers, the palace is a popular destination for Tangier residents.
   Five huge tents have been set up on the 15-acre Moroccan-style
garden surrounding the palace.
   Guests drew lots for tent assignments, with the lucky ones
sharing the biggest tent with the birthday boy himself. His sons are
to act as hosts at the other tents.
   Miss Taylor did not have to stand for the lottery: She's
guaranteed a spot near Forbes. The two have been regular companions
since Forbes' 39-year marriage ended in divorce in 1985.
   Each tent is furnished in true luxury, with priceless Moroccan
furniture and thick carpets from Rabat and Fez. An army of Moroccan
chefs will be working feverishly in the kitchen.
   Guests will dance to a local band playing Moroccan and Western
tunes.
   Forbes invited Morocco's ruler King Hassan II. But the king
declined, instead inviting all of Forbes' guests to a luncheon
Sunday at the Tangier Golf Club.
   Hassan's sons, Crown Prince Mohamed and Prince Rachid, will go in
their father's place.
   Hassan ordered 120 men of his mounted guard to help provide
protection for the guests.
   ``They're not just decorative,'' Forbes said. ``Those boys mean
business.''
