   Cargill Inc., a Minneapolis commodity-trading concern with $32.4 billion in sales, topped the list of the nation's largest private companies for the third year in a row, according to Forbes magazine. 

   Second place in the 1987 ranking went to Safeway Stores Inc., an Oakland, Calif., grocery chain. 
Safeway had $20.3 billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year. 
Continental Grain Co., a New York commodity-trading firm with about $13.5 billion in sales, stayed in third place for the second year. 

   Koch Industries Inc., a petroleum and natural gas concern based in Wichita, Kan., which was second in the rankings in 1986, slipped to fourth place with $13 billion in revenue. 

   Forbes said 106 of the 400 private companies it ranked this year had sales of $1 billion or more, compared with 81 companies in 1986. 
Food wholesalers and grocery chains, apparel importers, commodity traders and real estate managers dominate the list; airlines and electric utilities are absent. 

   Proprietors of 69 of the 400 companies on the list also turned up in the magazine's annual ranking of the nation's richest individuals. 
The magazine said that 17 of 49 billionaires in the U.S. derive their wealth from the largest private companies.
