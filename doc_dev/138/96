<LEADPARA>  MORE THAN a few people in Alexandria, Va., were more than a little surprised
to discover that old Dr. Tauber, the guy who still charges just $5 for office
visits by his oldest patients, is one of the richest people in the United
States. But that's what it says in the new issue of Forbes magazine: Laszlo
Tauber is worth $500 million.;    A half-billionaire, Tauber is listed in the
new Forbes 400 -- the 400 richest people in America -- and it says he is the
federal government's largest landlord. The feds lease more than 4 million
square feet to various departments and agencies across the Potomac in
Washington.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     It is quite an American story, in more ways than one. Dr. Tauber, a Jew
born in Hungary, managed to stay a step ahead of Nazi extermination squads
during World War II and arrived in New York in 1948 as a refugee. He was 33
years old and had barely a penny to his name.;    It is a familiar, exciting
story. But the most interesting part is what happened after Tauber was finally
able to try to practice medicine again. He began looking for a small office
and made an astounding discovery about his new country: In America, you could
borrow money to buy real estate. Mortgages. Credit. These were new words to
him, new ideas.;    Tauber saw America whole. Like many immigrants, he saw
what many Americans miss or forget or take for granted. In Europe, a man
needed cash to buy property. You had to be rich. In America, the doctor saved
$1,500, got a mortgage and bought a four-unit apartment house in Washington.
One thing led to another, and at the age of 76, Tauber is wealthy beyond
dreams and could afford to practice medicine free if he felt like it.;   
"America is the greatest country in the world," a Frenchmen once said to me in
a compartment of a train from Paris to the south. He interrupted our
conversation, four of us, Americans, talking about the problems of our native
land, things that were not so great in the United States.;    "Why do you say
that?" I asked.;    "Americans invented credit," he said. Actually we didn't,
the British did, but we democratized credit, making it possible for Dr. Tauber
and me to buy our houses.;    Most of us do take too much for granted, not
thinking about how different America and American systems are from the way the
rest of the world works. We are the ones who are different in this old world;
that's why they called our part the New World. A man from St. Louis living in
England, T.S. Eliot, said: "And the end of all our exploring/Will be to arrive
where we started/And know the place for the first time.";    Eliot had the
perspective of the expatriate, Tauber the perspective of a foreigner. So did a
Frenchman named Alexis de Tocqueville. In 1831, when the young aristocrat
traveled the new United States taking notes for the book he called "Democracy
in America," this was his first notebook entry: "There are in the United
States a great number of business failures, and these do not sufficiently
injure those who are responsible.";    He was puzzled by our lenient
bankruptcy laws. They are lenient still: You go broke; you start over. In
France, debtors went to prison.;    The second chance, and the third, and
fourth, and on and on, is what makes America different. People move on, change
jobs, careers, families and personalities. They go back to school; we are the
only people who have continuing education. The greatest of American freedoms
is the freedom to fail -- and to try again.;    One can succeed anywhere,
especially with well-chosen parents. But the mark of failure is a permanent
stain almost everywhere. Americans can use and abuse the right and power to
change themselves, to start over -- to be whoever you say you are. In most
societies, people know exactly who you are, or were born to be, or supposed to
be the minute you open your mouth.;    This is the most open society on our
planet. Open, though not necessarily fair -- other societies may have more
equitable systems and laws, including laws to protect the victims of
bankruptcies. But life had not been particularly fair to Laszlo Tauber before
he stepped into the United States 42 years ago and realized that there really
were streets paved with gold -- if you looked.  </TEXT>
