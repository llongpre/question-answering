IRVINE HEIRESS GETS $149-MILLION AWARD; 
</P>
<P>
LITIGATION: THE RULING MAY END JOAN IRVINE SMITH'S LONG STOCK-PRICE DISPUTE 
WITH DONALD L. BREN, WHO CONTROLS IRVINE CO., NOW ONE OF THE NATION'S LARGEST 
DEVELOPERS.

<P>
A Michigan court referee ruled Monday that Joan Irvine Smith, an heiress of 
Irvine Co., should be paid $149 million plus interest for her stock in the 
company, now one of the biggest developers in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The decision may put to rest a bitter, seven-year dispute that pitted Smith, 
whose family founded the huge ranch in the 1860s, against Donald L. Bren, who 
now controls the company. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides seemed pleased by the ruling, in one of the largest such cases on 
record. Smith had demanded $330 million, but she and her lawyer claimed victory 
Monday. The amount, however, comes much closer to the $88 million that Bren, 
one of the nation's richest men, offered her when he bought control of Irvine 
Co. in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had argued that Bren's offer was far too low. The trial, which began in 
1987, centered on how much the company was actually worth when Bren bought it. 
</P>
<P>
"The ruling is closer to the company's estimate, but we're quite pleased," said 
Howard I. Friedman, Smith's lawyer. "But I'd be less than candid if I didn't 
say the company was worth a great deal more." 
</P>
<P>
Said Smith, who with her mother, Athalie Clarke, owned 11% of the company: "I 
understand the Irvine Co. is saying this is a great victory. But I am not 
unhappy. I consider it a definite victory for us. It is still a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co., on the other hand, was pleased because the ruling "so clearly 
validates the fundamental fairness of the 1983 transaction in which Donald Bren 
acquired the Irvine Co.," said Gary H. Hunt, the company's senior vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
Neither side seemed likely to appeal the ruling Monday, although Smith said she 
would take some time to consider an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Some issues remain to be determined by Robert B. Webster, a retired Michigan 
judge who presided over the case. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest is a hearing to determine how much interest Smith will get on the 
$149 million. Her lawyer estimates that could add another $25 million to the 
total. Irvine Co. lawyers said it would probably be considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
Webster may also decide whether to award attorney's fees to one side or the 
other. With other costs, Irvine Co. estimates its legal expenses at $15 million 
over the last seven years and says Smith's costs are probably about the same. 
She declined comment on that issue. 
</P>
<P>
Webster, who was appointed to hear the case so that it wouldn't tie up a 
Michigan courtroom for years, said he'd prefer to leave the attorney fees issue 
up to the courts but would rule if the courts insisted he do so. 
</P>
<P>
The trial was held in Michigan because the company is incorporated there. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. said it has long budgeted for an amount greater than the judge 
awarded and can pay the award through previously established lines of credit. 
The award is not payable until the issue of interest is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
Smith had been asking for about $500 million with interest. 
</P>
<P>
The high-stakes trial was the stuff of a television miniseries: On one side was 
Bren, an intense, reserved billionaire with enough land and power to impose his 
own architectural vision on a huge slice of Southern California. On the other 
side was Smith, a feisty member of the horsey set whose family traces its money 
and its toughness to the old cattle-ranching days of 19th-Century California. 
</P>
<P>
Bren, 57, bought out fellow shareholders in 1983 for $200,000 a share. They had 
bought the shares just six years earlier at $6,000, and they reaped a 3,200% 
return on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, 56, whose grandfather incorporated Irvine Co. in 1894 to run the 
family's vast ranch, also agreed to sell her 550 shares. But she demanded three 
times more, or $600,000 a share. Thousands of acres in Orange County's most 
desirable neighborhoods, she insisted, were worth that much. 
</P>
<P>
When they couldn't agree, the company had to go to court and ask a judge to set 
a fair price. It was Smith's right to insist on a court hearing under Michigan 
laws that protect shareholders of privately held companies from being squeezed 
out at unfair prices. 
</P>
<P>
The subsequent trial dragged on through 150 days in the courtroom between 1987 
and 1989. It chewed up 27,000 pages of trial transcripts and pleadings and an 
estimated $30 million in legal fees. The trial was held in a rented office 
outside Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
Smith painted Bren as a conniving schemer, and Bren's lawyers portrayed her as 
a greedy, litigious eccentric. 
</P>
<P>
Smith contended that Bren exaggerated the company's problems in order to 
frighten and mislead shareholders and stampede them into selling at a low 
price. 
</P>
<P>
That's ridiculous, said Bren. The other shareholders who sold to him at 
$200,000 a share were some of the most astute investors in the nation: Wall 
Street investment bankers and executives of large corporations. 
</P>
<P>
Bren said it was unlikely they would underestimate the value of their stock by 
$400,000 a share. Therefore, he said, the court should accept his price as 
fair. He said the deal met the test of fairness under the law: that the buyers 
and sellers be "knowledgeable and willing." 
</P>
<P>
The referee rejected the three experts Smith put on the stand, who valued the 
company at as much as $3 billion in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
The referee's ruling could make it easier for other dissident shareholders in 
private companies to challenge sales, experts said. In fact Irvine Co. argued 
that if Smith won, it would hamstring managers and enable shareholders to 
arbitrarily hold up any deal they didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
These cases are complicated because it's hard to value the stock of a privately 
held company such as Irvine Co. Unlike in a public company, the stock isn't 
traded openly on an exchange, where the price is determined by public demand 
and can be easily found in the newspaper stock tables each morning. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. is especially hard to value because there is nothing to compare it 
to: It owns a stretch of immensely valuable Orange County land 22 miles across 
and nine miles deep in some places, an undulating brown sea squarely in the 
path of growth moving south from Los Angeles. Some of the 64,000 acres it owns 
sell for more than $1 million. It is the largest private owner of land in any 
of the nation's metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
Valuation cases are usually settled out of court because they can take years to 
resolve; few people can afford to hire lawyers and expert witnesses for that 
long. 
</P>
<P>
But with hundreds of millions of dollars at stake, Bren and Smith couldn't 
reach a settlement after Bren bought the company in 1983. The two are said to 
dislike each other, which may also have hindered negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the bright side for Bren, he hasn't yet had to pay a dime to 
Smith. Irvine Co. has been able to keep and use millions of dollars it would 
otherwise have had to pay Smith in 1983 if she'd agreed to Bren's offer. 
</P>
<P>
And there is another, backhanded benefit to the ruling: Now that the referee 
says the company was worth more than Bren paid for it, it makes Bren seem a 
canny deal-maker who outsmarted some of the brightest businessmen in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling may also fuel more speculation about the size of his fortune; if the 
land is worth much more than the company says, then Bren's net worth may have 
been underestimated by Forbes magazine and others. 
</P>
<P>
Owning the company gives Bren a net worth estimated by Forbes at $1.8 billion. 
That makes him one of the 20 richest people in the nation, wealthier than much 
better-known tycoons such as Ted Turner, Donald J. Trump, Harry Helmsley, 
Rupert P. Murdoch and August A. Busch III. 
</P>
<P>
But Bren doesn't like to talk about his wealth. The profiles in national 
publications such as Newsweek make him downright uncomfortable. That's partly 
because he loathes publicity and partly because speculation about his wealth 
riles up California's powerful slow-growth movement and environmentalists, who 
question why Bren needs to develop more vacant land when he's already a 
billionaire. 
</P>
<P>
The company always downplays the question of Bren's wealth and says that just 
because a judge, with a stroke of his pen, upped the value of the company on 
paper doesn't necessarily make it so in reality.
