   Sam M. Walton, the legendary retailer who once danced the hula on Wall Street when profit waltzed past forecasts, gave up his title as chief executive officer of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. 

   Mr. Walton, about two months away from his 70th birthday, handed the job to his much-anticipated successor, David D. Glass, who served most recently as president and chief operating officer of Wal-Mart, the nation's third largest retailer. 
Mr. Glass, 52 years old, combines formal finance training and a stint as the Wal-Mart's chief financial officer with broad merchandising and operations experience. 
Mr. Walton will remain chairman. 

   Mr. Glass's elevation coincided with the retirement of Jack Shewmaker, a vice chairman and chief financial officer. 
Mr. Shewmaker was once seen as a rival to Mr. Glass for the top post, but recently had receded as a potential heir apparent. 
Mr. Shewmaker, 50, remains on the board of Bentonville, Ark.-based Wal-Mart and said he will serve as a consultant with a multiyear contract. 
He declined to discuss whether his departure was prompted by Mr. Glass's appointment, but people who know both men said it was unlikely that either one would have been content working for the other. 

   The top level changes precipitated promotions and job changes for seven other Wal-Mart executives, but no one seemed surprised by the selections. 
Most also felt the changes would signal little change at the fast-growing company. 
Mr. Walton "is relinquishing his title not his person," said Walter F. Loeb, a Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. analyst. 
"He will be in the stores as in the past, and making sure people are happy." 
In a statement, Mr. Walton said he plans "to participate and be as active and involved as always." 
Mr. Walton and his family are the company's biggest shareholders with about a 40% stake, according to last year's proxy materials. 

   Mr. Glass said in an interview that he and Mr. Walton shared the same retailing principles and that he didn't plan any major changes at Wal-Mart. 
He conceded that he doesn't possess Mr. Walton's flair although he did stage the billionaire's Wall Street hula performance several years ago and walked a pig down a Dallas street after the company met other profit goals in 1986. 
"Sam is one of a kind," Mr. Glass said, adding that he wasn't "going to dance the hula on Wall Street." 

   In a separate interview, Mr. Shewmaker said he was retiring because "I have a lot of money and I have a lot of interests I want to pursue." 
Mr. Shewmaker, who is popular with Wal-Mart's store managers, is a millionare with extensive real estate holdings and a cattle breeding operation. 

   Mr. Walton's business associates said he had been hinting recently at giving up the chief executive duties -- a post he'd held since 1962. 
The company runs largely without his presence at headquarters. 
Mr. Walton travels extensively, each week visiting stores in the chain's 24-state market, and returns for traditional Saturday meetings to review operations and field reports. 
He is expected to continue to do so. 

   Mr. Glass clearly had been successfully tested for the top job since being named in 1984 as president and operating chief in in a job switch with Mr. Shewmaker. 
"David has exhibited excellent leadership and management skills," Mr. Walton said yesterday. 

   Assisting Mr. Glass will be Donald G. Sonderquist, 54, who was named chief operating officer and a vice chairman. 
Mr. Sonderquist formerly was executive vice president of operations and administration. 
Paul R. Carter, an executive vice president, finance, was named chief financial officer, and will be nominated to Wal-Mart's board. 
Wal-Mart said Al Johnson, executive vice president, merchandise and sales, also was named a vice chairman.
