The Cleveland Browns, off to their worst start since 1984, fired Coach Bud 
Carson on Monday, the day after their worst home loss ever. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Art Modell, who promised last year that Carson would be his last head 
coach, changed his mind after Sunday's 42-0 loss to the Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an embarrassment for all of us," Modell said. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, the first coaching casualty of the season, was replaced by offensive 
coordinator Jim Shofner. 
</P>
<P>
Modell asked Shofner to take over for at least the rest of the season. He 
becomes the Browns' ninth head coach. Carson's three-year contract runs through 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
Carson said Monday he thought the Browns (2-7) were back on track when they 
lost to the San Francisco 49ers, 20-17, on a last-minute field goal a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected to play well last night, and we did not do it," Carson said. "Not 
only did we not do it, we played as badly as we can play." 
</P>
<P>
Carson gambled by starting Mike Pagel at quarterback against the Bills, instead 
of Bernie Kosar. Kosar will start when the Browns play again on Nov. 18 against 
Houston, Shofner said. The Browns have a bye this week. 
</P>
<P>
Including playoff games, Carson was 12-14-1 with the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
Carson, 59, replaced Marty Schottenheimer as the Brown coach on Jan. 27, 1989, 
after Schottenheimer left in a dispute with Modell over coaching styles. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns were 9-6-1 and AFC Central champions under Carson last year, making 
it to the AFC title game before losing to Denver. But 1990 has been a 
nightmare, with injuries, retirements and holdouts wiping out Cleveland's 
offensive line and fouling up the defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel Bud was given a fair shake," said safety Felix Wright, who staged 
a bitter holdout before the season. "I'm disappointed. Who knows what would 
have happened if we were all together during training camp, and happy?"
