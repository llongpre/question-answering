4 QUARTERBACKS, 1 SUPER BOWL 
</P>

This is the time of year that can make or break a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Bradshaw couldn't spell "cat" until he starred in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Phil Simms was never good enough in New York until he was perfect in a Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Williams never got the payday he deserved until he broke down barriers in 
a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
If this is January, then the NFL spotlight must be on the quarterback. Heading 
into the AFC and NFC championship games, this year's roll call of Final Four 
quarterbacks is typical of the times. 
</P>
<P>
There's Bernie Kosar and John Elway -- the unorthodox, side-arming flinger 
against the once golden boy -- in Sunday's AFC showdown between Cleveland and 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
There's Jim Everett and Joe Montana -- the new kid on the block against the 
master -- in the NFC's matchup between the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in that group is a Super Bowl winner: if it's Montana, a repeat 
winner, waiting the call of fame and fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Elway and Montana know a little about the territory. Elway is a two-time Super 
Bowl loser with the Broncos, born of expectations that at times have been 
surrealistic. Montana is a three-time winner whose former coach was ready to 
phase him out as recently as November 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, of the four, only Everett has not been drummed through the NFL's school 
of hard knocks. Kosar was booed this season in Cleveland. All he did was win 
four division titles in five years as a pro. Elway was booed in Denver. All he 
did was win a pair of AFC championships. 
</P>
<P>
"There (were) some unpleasant things said and John hasn't had an easy year," 
said Dan Reeves, Elway's coach in Denver. "But he has performed well, and he 
showed last week he still is able to do great things." 
</P>
<P>
Elway, 29, became the third player in NFL history to have five straight 
3,000-yard seasons. Dan Marino and Boomer Esiason are the others. Counting last 
week's come-from-behind win over Pittsburgh, he has brought the Broncos back 16 
times with last-minute rallies. It was Elway's crucial 36-yard completion to 
Vance Johnson on a flea-flicker that set up the Broncos' winning touchdown in a 
24-23 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
If there's one thing Marty Schottenheimer appreciates in Elway, it's his 
competitive fire. 
</P>
<P>
"When you talk about his mobility and strong arm, the one thing people fail to 
recognize is that he probably is as great a competitor as there is," said 
Schottenheimer, head coach in Kansas City who lost two AFC title games to Elway 
while in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
"I've coached him in the Pro Bowl, and I've seen enough of him to know the guy 
is a great competitor. And if you look at all four of these quarterbacks, 
that's one common thread they all have." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar's competitiveness helped him endure a year of insult and injury in 
Cleveland. The Browns' quarterback bruised his right elbow in a Week 10 victory 
over Seattle. He played through the pain, and in the next four games the Browns 
went 0-3-1. When he went 20 quarters without a touchdown pass, he was booed at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"If you ask Bernie how he is, he won't ever say he's hurting," said Bud Carson, 
who replaced Schottenheimer in Cleveland. "But we've discussed it with the 
doctors and they say he isn't in any career-threatening situation. He just has 
had some different arm problems. 
</P>
<P>
"When the time comes to throw the ball, especially in a big game when we have 
to have it, Bernie comes through. We were much more concerned about him last 
week, health-wise, than this week." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar, 26, has had elbow, shoulder and finger ailments this year. Last week, 
with various parts of his anatomy hurting, he completed 20 of 29 passes for 235 
yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite the injuries, Kosar still 
passed for 3,533 yards and 18 touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't surprise Schottenheimer. "The thing that stands out is that at a 
point in time when everybody thought he would be at his worst, he got the job 
done," his former coach said. "That speaks volumes about Kosar as a winning 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
At a point in time when then-coach Bill Walsh was ready to pass the 49ers' 
quarterbacking torch from Montana to Steve Young last season, Montana responded 
with some of the best football of his life. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers won seven of their last eight games a year ago, and with Montana 
showing the way, capped the season with a dramatic 20-16 victory over 
Cincinnati in Super Bowl XXIII. His 92-yard drive at game's end produced the 
winning touchdown, a 10-yard scoring pass to John Taylor. This year, the 49ers 
are 15-2 going into Sunday's showdown, and Montana has elevated his game still 
another notch. 
</P>
<P>
Montana, 33, completed a staggering 70.2 percent of his passes this season and 
posted the highest passer rating in NFL history, 112.4. His 
touchdown-to-interception ratio of 26-8 is the best of his 11-year career. 
Montana was named the NFL's MVP for his superior season. 
</P>
<P>
Said first-year 49ers Coach George Seifert, "Any superlative you can use to 
describe him fits." 
</P>
<P>
Montana's next playoff touchdown pass will tie him with Bradshaw for the league 
record of 30. 
</P>
<P>
As fate would have it, there are those who compare young Everett to the veteran 
Montana. In his second full season as the Rams' starting quarterback, Everett 
passed for 4,310 yards and an NFL-high 29 touchdowns. He has a strong arm, 
quick release and soft touch. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great compliment," Everett said of the comparison. "He (Montana) has 
proven time and time again he's a Super Bowl winner, and I think that's the 
judgment on quarterbacks. Comparisons are great, but I don't have a Super 
Bowl."
