   ABC television will try to soothe bruised
feelings in Cleveland stemming from a joke in a promotion for the
situation comedy ``Coach,'' the mayor's office says.
   Robert A. Iger, president of ABC Entertainment, promised to air
an apology the night of Oct. 22, when ABC broadcasts the Cleveland
Browns' home game against the Cincinnati Bengals, a statement by
Mayor Michael R. White's office said Saturday.
   When the Browns played in Denver against the Broncos on Oct. 8,
the network broadcast a brief promotion for ``Coach.''
   Actor Jerry Van Dyke, who plays an assistant college football
coach on the series, commented that even if the Browns beat Denver,
they would still lose ``because they have to go back to
Cleveland.''
   White sent a letter to ABC, calling the remark insensitive and
disrespectful to the city.
   ``Any comedian or comedy show that uses Cleveland as the punch
line for a joke has never visited our city and is relying on what
has been for years the crutch of feeble comedians,'' White said in
his letter to ABC.
   Iger's letter explained that Van Dyke's joke was done ``in
character'' and that no malice was intended. Iger noted that two
weeks earlier, during a Monday Night Football broadcast, Van Dyke
made the same comment about Buffalo, N.Y.
   ``We firmly believe this incident should be kept in the proper
perspective, and given the problems existing in the world today, we
urge you and the citizens of your fine city to take this in the
lighthearted spirit in which it was meant,'' Iger wrote.
