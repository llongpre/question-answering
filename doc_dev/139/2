Once again, the Rams and Raiders won't be meeting in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
How about an ex-Raider vs. an ex-Ram? 
</P>
<P>
OK, there's ex-Raider linebacker Matt Millen of the 49ers vs. ex-Ram and 
ex-UCLA Bruin receiver Michael Young, who helped quarterback John Elway and the 
Broncos break up Sunday's AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Young, left unprotected by the Rams last winter and signed by the Broncos as a 
Plan B free agent, caught two passes -- one for 70 yards and a touchdown, the 
other for 53, setting up another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Was he surprised? 
</P>
<P>
"Coming here, I thought that if I made the team, I'd have a chance to 
participate and do some things," Young said. "But never to this extent. I never 
would have dreamed of having a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
Mad at the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
"They just had a change in philosophy," Young said. "There was a new offensive 
coordinator (Ernie Zampese) coming in and I wasn't his type of player. Hey, 
everybody has their opinion. I'm not upset at all at them. 
</P>
<P>
"I wish I could say I had animosity toward 'em but I'd be lying if I said that. 
I almost stayed there because I knew I had a secure job as a backup receiver. 
But I knew that being a backup receiver on the Rams was like being a tackle. I 
mean, I knew I was never going to see any kind of action unless someone got 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"I almost didn't leave because I liked it so much. But I tell you what, I like 
it a hell of a lot better here." 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos played the second half without rookie running back Bobby Humphrey, 
and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
Veteran Sammy Winder took over and gained 37 yards -- in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Will Humphrey be ready for the Super Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
Coach Dan Reeves said he has two broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
"Nah," said Humphrey, who will be X-rayed again today. 
</P>
<P>
Eight different Denver receivers caught passes, but when asked if Cleveland's 
secondary could have done anything differently to stop them, cornerback Frank 
Minnifield failed to come up with answers. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't pay me to make that evaluation," Minnifield said. "I'm the CB, not 
the HC." 
</P>
<P>
HC? 
</P>
<P>
"Head coach." 
</P>
<P>
OK. But what about . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
"Don't even ask me," Minnifield said. "I didn't sit and watch the game. I 
played it. There was no thought process. They just pay me to cover wide 
receivers. You ask me to evaluate something, you ain't doing me no service 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
It was Minnifield who slipped and fell, freeing Young for his 70-yard touchdown 
catch. 
</P>
<P>
Bud Carson, despite the loss, was satisfied with his first season coaching the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were down and out, everybody said we were finished," Carson said. "But 
we came back, week by week, every day except today. I'd say we made a hell of a 
run at it." 
</P>
<P>
What did Elway think of the crowd noise that drowned out Cleveland counterpart 
Bernie Kosar's signals? 
</P>
<P>
"I had trouble hearing when we had the ball," Elway said. "I can only imagine 
what it was like for Bernie." 
</P>
<P>
Denver radio station KHOW played a new tune all week, sung to the tune of the 
old Coasters hit, "Charlie Brown." It went: 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 They're real clowns, those Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 They're gonna get beat, gonna miss the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the Denver Broncos always pickin' on us? 
</P>
