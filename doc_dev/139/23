Ozzie Newsome, the NFL's all-time reception leader among tight ends, said today 
that he will return for one more season with the Cleveland Browns. Newsome, who 
has been the subject of retirement speculation for several years, said he had 
decided to leave the game after last season but changed his mind after an 
overhaul of the Browns' coaching staff.

Coach Marty Schottenheimer quit the Browns at the end of the season over 
philosophical differences with owner Art Modell, and most of Schottenheimer's 
assistants also left. Newsome decided to wait until a new head coach, Bud 
Carson, was chosen, and the veteran tight end then had a long talk with Marc 
Trestman, Cleveland's quarterback coach last season, who has been elevated to 
offensive coordinator.

During his career, Newsome has had 610 receptions for 7,416 yards and 44 
touchdowns. He hasn't fumbled in his last 505 receptions and has caught at 
least 30 passes in each of his 11 seasons. Newsome, who celebrates his 33rd 
birthday Thursday, had 35 catches for 343 yards last season and extended his 
consecutive game reception streak to 143 games.
