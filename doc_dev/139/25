Jerry Van Dyke, in his role as dimwitted Luther Van Dam from "Coach," 
apologized on the air for having knocked Cleveland two weeks ago in a 
promotional spot for the ABC comedy, and the mayor accepted. 
</P>
<P>
The apology came in a promo as well. 
</P>
<P>
It was aired during the "Monday Night Football" game between the Cleveland 
Browns and the Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
"I just want to say that I'm sorry, Cleveland, and I love Cleveland and I love 
the people in it," Van Dyke said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Michael R. White replied: "The Cleveland of today and the Cleveland of 15 
years ago are vastly different places. I think the apology frankly recognizes 
that there has been a major improvement." 
</P>
<P>
The joke that got Cleveland so mad was broadcast Oct. 8 during a Monday night 
game between Cleveland and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
Van Dyke, a football coach in "Coach," said in the promo, "I think the problem 
with Cleveland is, even if you win, you lose. You still got to go home to 
Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the football season, a "Coach" promo made the same joke about 
Buffalo, incensing residents of that city.
