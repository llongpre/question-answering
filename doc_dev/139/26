Interim Coach Jim Shofner, who will lead the Browns against the Rams in 
Cleveland Sunday, said he hasn't really concerned himself with whether he will 
be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't even thought otherwise, really," Shofner said. 
</P>
<P>
"You start doing the job, you just assume you're going to do it from now on, 
and that's the way I'm thinking. And how it'll work out, I don't know. But no 
one has said 'This is your job' by any means." 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Bernie Kosar, who worked closely with Shofner when Shofner was 
former coach Bud Carson's offensive coordinator, made it clear where he stands. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the players are looking for some stability and respect Jim Shofner," 
Kosar said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram Coach John Robinson said there is no reason to fear the chilly weather in 
Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"Supposed to be in the 40s," Robinson said. "I think when it's bad is when it 
gets down to the 20s. Thirties are not bad. Forties aren't bad. I don't think 
we anticipate problems there with the weather." TIM KAWAKAMI
