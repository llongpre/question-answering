In a game filled with errors common to exhibition openers, Philadelphia 
quarterback Don McPherson and wide receiver Gizmo Williams came up with a 
picture-perfect play that helped the Eagles beat the Cleveland Browns, 17-13, 
in the fourth annual American Bowl played Sunday in front of 73,677 at Wembley 
Stadium.

<P>
An interception by safety Tom Gerhart four plays after McPherson failed to 
scored on a fourth-and-goal play gave the Eagles the ball at their 48 and set 
up a 34-yard McPherson-to-Williams touchdown pass play that gave Philadelphia a 
17-6 lead with 10:31 left.

<P>
The loss spoiled the coaching debut of Cleveland's Bud Carson, former Ram 
defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson, a second-year pro from Syracuse, replaced Eagle starter Randall 
Cunningham at the beginning of the second quarter with the Eagles leading, 7-0.

After his missed opportunity at the goal line, McPherson made the most of the 
second chance that Gerhart's interception gave him. McPherson passed nine yards 
to Robert Drummond for a first down. Then after Cleveland was called for 
holding, negating a sack, McPherson looped the ball into the right corner of 
the end zone.

<P>
Williams, who signed with the Eagles in the off-season from the Canadian 
Football League, dove for the ball and made a fingertip catch, ending the play 
with a forward roll. He tossed the ball to an official, then did a forward flip 
in the air -- a move that cost the Eagles five yards on the ensuing kickoff for 
showboating.

<P>
"He's got to learn to play NFL football. He can get away with that in Canada," 
Eagle Coach Buddy Ryan said. "The jury is still out on Gizmo Williams."
