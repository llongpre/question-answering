Miami Dolphins rookie Pete Stoyanovich may have saved more than a game with his 
35-yard field goal in overtime Sunday against the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
He also may have saved his job. 
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovich missed a 46-yard field goal in the third period and a 45-yarder 
with three seconds left in regulation time, but gave the Dolphins a 13-10 
victory when he connected on Miami's first possession in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a big, big kick in his career," Dolphin Coach Don Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovich, an eighth-round draft choice who became Miami's kicker when 
veteran Fuad Reveiz was injured in training camp, said he was confident about 
the final kick despite his earlier misses. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't that far out," he said. "I had no doubt I was going to make it. I'm 
just really fortunate that the team gave me a second opportunity to win it for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland took the kickoff to start overtime and drove 46 yards, but Matt Bahr 
was wide left on a 44-yard field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"We all miss," Stoyanovich said. "Nobody's perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The winner, with 8:32 left, capped a 55-yard drive that included two 
third-and-10 passes from Dan Marino to Fred Banks. On the first pass, Stephen 
Braggs was called for a 26-yard pass interference penalty at the Cleveland 47. 
The second pass was a 20-yard completion to the Cleveland 27. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's previous home games this season, both losses, also were decided on the 
game's final play. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been two games we should have won at the end, but we didn't," 
Marino said. "This will be a big boost for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (2-3) and Browns (3-2) both had a chance to win the game in a wild 
final minute in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's Felix Wright returned an interception to the Miami 37 with 1:08 
left, but Louis Oliver intercepted Bernie Kosar's pass two plays later. Marino 
completed two passes for 23 yards before Stoyanovich missed. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns drove to Miami's 45-yard line with five minutes to go in the fourth 
quarter. Two penalties set them back, and safety Jarvis Williams broke up a 
third-down pass at the Miami 30. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't do it when we had to," Browns Coach Bud Carson said. "We had our 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland was hampered by eight penalties for 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy football," Carson said. "Ten points don't win many 
football games."
