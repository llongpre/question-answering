<TEXT>     "He's certainly one of the key figures in professional sports," former
Bengals quarterback Ken Anderson said. "Football would not be what it is
without him. He was always concerned about his guys after football. Football
was just a steppingstone. He wanted you to prepare for your life's work.";   
Brown began his coaching career in 1930 after graduating from Miami (Ohio)
University, where he was a star quarterback.;    After coaching at a high
school in Massillon, Ohio, and at Ohio State, Brown formed the Browns of the
All America Conference in 1946 and coached the team. The Browns captured all
four titles in the league's existence before entering the NFL in 1950. They
won championship that year -- the first of their three titles in the 1950s.;  
 The 1960s saw Brown get fired in Cleveland, win election to the Pro Football
Hall of Fame and form the Bengals expansion franchise that he coached until
1975. He continued to run the Bengals' operations as vice president and
general manager.;    "I couldn't go back (into football after Cleveland)
unless I was in complete charge," he said. "I had it both ways -- when the
Browns started -- and for a long time after -- I was in complete charge. . . .
And that's the way it must be. . . . The history of all successful teams shows
how authority concentrated in the coach.";    Former Bengals offensive lineman
Dave Lapham praised Brown's organizational skills.;    "I think that the real
key to the success of Paul Brown was his organizational ability," Lapham said.
"He basically structured his football team as a CEO would his company.";    It
was as a coach that Brown made his biggest mark on the game. He was known for
his innovations -- introducing classroom techniques that are commonplace
today, using film to grade players, calling plays from the sideline.;    He
ran his team with a seriousness that shaped his image.;    "I was a
serious-looking guy," he said. "Of course, you can't exactly do much about how
you look. They formed images of me.;    "Every time we'd go to New York to
play the Giants -- and were beating them pretty regularly -- I'd get a new
term. The first one was 'the cold, calculating Brown.' Then I got to be
'deadly'; we were winning too much," he said, laughing. "Cold, deadly,
calculating.";    And a winner. Brown had a 213-104-9 record as a
professional.;    He is survived by his wife, Mary, and two sons, Mike and
Pete. Mike is the Bengals' assistant general manager, and Pete is director of
player personnel. His first wife, Katy, died in 1969. Another son, Robin, died
in 1978.;    Heim said a funeral is scheduled Wednesday morning at St.
Timothy's Episcopal Church in Massillon.  </TEXT>
