   Jerry Van Dyke, in his role as dimwitted Luther
Van Dam from ``Coach,'' apologized on the air for having knocked
Cleveland two weeks ago in an promotional spot for the ABC comedy,
and the mayor accepted.
   The apology came in a promo as well. It was aired during the
Monday night football game between the Cleveland Browns and the
Cincinnati Bengals.
   ``I just want to say that I'm sorry, Cleveland, and I love
Cleveland and I love the people in it,'' Van Dam said.
   Mayor Michael R. White replied: ``The Cleveland of today and the
Cleveland of 15 years ago are vastly different places. I think the
apology frankly recognizes that there has been a major
improvement.''
   The joke that got Cleveland so mad was broadcast Oct. 8 during a
Monday night football game between Cleveland and Denver.
   Van Dam, a football coach in ``Coach,'' said in the promo, ``I
think the problem with Cleveland is, even if you win, you lose. You
still got to go home to Cleveland.''
   Dale R. Finley, president of the Cleveland Convention and
Visitors Bureau, said the joke reflected an image created when the
city's oil-slicked Cuyahoga River caught fire 20 years ago and the
city went into default in 1978.
   The city has since changed, he said.
