Bill Walsh will give up the head coaching job of the Super Bowl champion San 
Francisco 49ers, published reports today said, and there were strong 
indications that he will be replaced by defensive coordinator George Seifert. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who reportedly will take another job in the organization, has supported 
Seifert as his replacement and Seifert reportedly cut short a trip to Cleveland 
to discuss the Browns coaching job and returned to San Francisco on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
A source told The Associated Press today that Cleveland was now leaning toward 
hiring New York Jets defensive coordinator Bud Carson. Browns owner Art Modell 
said he would meet with Carson tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the New York Daily News reported today that sources close to the 
situation said San Francisco owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. wanted a high-profile 
coach like Jimmy Johnson of the University of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, DeBartolo and their attorneys met Wednesday for two hours in the villa 
DeBartolo is occupying this week while playing in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am golf 
tournament, the San Francisco Examiner said today. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Comment 
</P>
<P>
Neither Walsh, DeBartolo nor Johnson, reportedly out of his office Wednesday on 
a recruiting trip, was available for comment. DeBartolo had said Tuesday that 
it may be three weeks before a final determination is made on Walsh's status. 
</P>
<P>
However, Miami Sports Information Director Rich Dalrymple, who said he spoke 
with Johnson today, quoted the coach as saying: "It's just a rumor. I have had 
no contact with the San Francisco 49ers." 
</P>
<P>
The San Jose Mercury News, citing a source close to the 49ers, reported today 
that Walsh has told his assistants that he will not return for an 11th season, 
but will remain with the team in the front office. 
</P>
<P>
The Examiner quoted 49ers Vice President and General Counsel Carmen Policy as 
saying a meeting of team officials would be held today -- after DeBartolo 
finishes his golf commitment. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Walsh definitely is leaving as coach and whether Seifert would be 
elevated to replace him, Policy on Wednesday night responded: "I can't say, but 
all parties are on the same page." 
</P>
<P>
Seifert, a leading candidate for the Cleveland Browns' vacant head coach 
position, was en route to Cleveland on Wednesday and booked a room in a hotel 
there. But after arriving in Dallas to change planes, he canceled the second 
leg of his trip and booked a return flight to San Francisco.
