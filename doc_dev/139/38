Don't expect Ram quarterback Jim Everett to emulate Cleveland quarterback 
Bernie Kosar, who went into a tirade Sunday after the Browns' sixth consecutive 
loss. Kosar criticized his teammates for lack of concentration, and this week 
said the Browns appear to have benefited from the lashing as they head into 
this Sunday's game against the Rams.

"I'm sure it was out of frustration; I'm sure it's one way he wants to try to 
motivate his troops," Everett said. "They've had a coaching change, and the 
leadership probably is not there, so he's probably trying to take it upon 
himself."

<P>
"I'm fortunate that we have some team leaders that are very solid individuals 
here, who through thick and thin make the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Coach John Robinson, while straining to make it clear he wasn't specifically 
talking about Kosar's action, said he would never want an individual player 
taking his teammates to task in the media. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you feel betrayed when somebody does something like that, when in 
essence it's behind your back, it's to the press," Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson also held an on-field meeting to make sure the Rams don't have a 
letdown Sunday against the Cleveland Browns (2-9) after upsetting the San 
Francisco 49ers. TIM KAWAKAMI
