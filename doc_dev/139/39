makes a 44-yard reception. He later caught the winning TD pass in Cleveland,
his 96th catch. Four players have caught 100 in a season.  </CAPTION>

<LEADPARA>  It's the question the Houston Oilers have been eager to answer since Coach
Jack Pardee installed the run-and-shoot.;   "Everybody says, 'What can they do
when they need to win? How will they do in bad weather?' " quarterback Warren
Moon said Sunday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We reacted pretty well to that today.";   Moon drove the Oilers 82 yards
through a Cleveland snowstorm to the winning touchdown with two minutes left
as Houston beat the Cleveland Browns 17-14. The loss mathematically eliminated
Cleveland (6-9) from playoff possibilities. Houston (11-4) matched a team
record for wins and kept alive its hope for a first-round bye.;   Moon
completed six passes on the winning drive and in the process set a
single-season NFL record for completions. His 2-yard touchdown pass to Haywood
Jeffires with 2 minutes, 19 seconds to play gave the Oilers their first and
only lead. It was Moon's 382nd completion this season, surpassing the mark of
378 set by Dan Marino in 1986.;   The run-and-shoot is a proven offense
indoors, but doubters say it can't be relied upon when snow, wind and cold are
added to the mix.;   Though Houston had trouble getting into the end zone, it
moved the ball well despite 29-degree cold and occasionally heavy snow --
particularly when it mattered most. Moon completed 26 of 40 passes for 250
yards and overcame an interception that killed a fourth-quarter drive.;  
"It's just a matter of making the big plays when you have to, regardless of
the weather," Moon said. "Coach Pardee said we had to go into this game not
making an issue of the weather. We've made some big drives before, although
this was maybe under worse conditions.";   The conditions became the Oilers'
ally at the end. After Bernie Kosar took the Browns to the Houston 1-yard line
with four seconds left, Matt Stover hooked a 19-yard field-goal attempt wide
of the left upright.;   "I think I may have slipped a little bit, but it
wasn't enough to make me miss a field goal," Stover said. "I felt it was,
like, solid. There are no excuses."; VIKINGS 20, RAMS 14: Reggie Rutland's
97-yard interception return led Minnesota (8-7) to a victory over Los Angeles
in Minneapolis, but the Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention
because of victories by Atlanta and Dallas.;   Rutland's franchise-record
interception return added to the Vikings' 13-7 lead. The Rams had driven to
Minnesota's 9-yard line when Rutland stepped in front of receiver Henry Ellard
at the 3, picked off the pass and was escorted along the sideline, past the
Rams' bench, by Audray McMillian for the touchdown.;   "The receiver tried to
lure me inside, then broke outside," Rutland said. "(Rams quarterback Jim
Everett) pretty much threw it on rhythm, without looking. . . . I anticipated
the route and got inside him. I was between the passer and receiver, and no
matter where he threw it, I would have had it.";   The Rams' loss was their
ninth straight, the most for the franchise in Los Angeles. The 1937-38
Cleveland Rams lost 12 in a row.;   "We're going through a hard time," said
Everett, who had four interceptions and a fumble. "It's Week 15, and we're
still making Week 5 mistakes."; PATRIOTS 6, JETS 3: New England used two field
goals by Charlie Baumann to beat New York in East Rutherford, N.J., nearly
ending the Jets' playoff hopes. But San Diego's victory over Miami kept the
Jets, who have lost three straight, still in the AFC wild-card hunt.;   The
Jets (7-8), losing their third game in a row, missed two short field goals,
and quarterback Ken O'Brien's passes often sailed in gusts of up to 30 mph.;  
"I don't know if the pressure got to us or what," New York's Brad Baxter said.
"We had the ball and we had the opportunities. Somebody has to make a big
play.";   Nobody did for the Jets. And New England, 1-15 last year, moved to
6-9 in its first season under Coach Dick MacPherson.; REDSKINS 34, GIANTS 17:
Mark Rypien passed for three touchdowns and NFC East champion Washington
pushed its record to 14-1 with a wipeout of the defending Super Bowl champions
in Washington.;   Gary Clark's 65-yard TD catch started the rout for the
Redskins, who opened a 24-10 halftime lead.;   Fears that the Redskins might
be complacent seemed unfounded. "I was really proud of our guys, because they
had a good attitude," Redskins Coach Joe Gibbs said. "They have a tremendous
amount of respect for the Giants, and they played them hard.";   The victory
marked the first time since 1983 that the Redskins had swept their season
series against New York (7-8).;   Rypien completed 9 of 19 passes for 230
yards and three touchdowns before leaving the game in the fourth period with a
torn fingernail on his passing hand.; BILLS 35, COLTS 7: Kenneth Davis,
playing for the injured Thurman Thomas, rushed for 90 yards and one touchdown
and caught one of three touchdown passes by Jim Kelly as Buffalo (13-2) won in
Indianapolis and clinched the home-field advantage throughout the AFC
playoffs.;   Buffalo scored on its first three possessions and set club season
records for points (444), passing yardage (3,747) and total offense (6,168
yards).;   The only consolation for Indianapolis (1-14), which matched a
franchise record for the most losses in one season, was the guarantee of the
No. 1 pick in next spring's college draft as the worst team in the NFL.;   The
only touchdown for the Colts was on a 1-yard run by Tim Manoa early in the
fourth quarter. Manoa started in place of Eric Dickerson, out with the flu,
and set up his first TD of the season with a 44-yard run, the Colts' longest
rush in two years.;   Thomas, who went in as the NFL's leading rusher this
season, sprained his left ankle on his sixth carry of the game's first
series.; STEELERS 17, BENGALS 10: Bubby Brister threw touchdown passes to
rookie tight ends Adrian Cooper and Keith Cash as host Pittsburgh (6-9)
withstood five turnovers to beat Cincinnati.;   The loss assured the Bengals
(2-13) of the worst season in the franchise's 24-year history.;   The 17
points allowed were the fewest by an NFL-worst Bengals defense that has
allowed 30 or more points nine times. The Steelers, who earlier won in
Cincinnati 33-27 in overtime, swept the Bengals in the season series for the
first time since 1987.  </TEXT>
