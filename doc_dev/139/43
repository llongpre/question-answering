<LEADPARA>  It's hard to say which was more surprising: that the Cincinnati Bengals
finally won, or the way they did it.;   Matt Stover, perfect on his previous
10 field-goal attempts, missed a try when the ball hit the left upright with 1
minute, 56 seconds to play. Then, sure-handed Brian Brennan dropped a
touchdown pass. Finally, Eric Thomas blocked Stover's 34-yard attempt with
time running out to preserve a 23-21 victory over the Cleveland Browns (4-5)
on Sunday.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Bengals (1-8) celebrated as if they had clinched a playoff spot.;  
"Unbelievable!" offensive tackle Anthony Munoz said. "To get a win, no matter
how . . . this was a great one today.";   Kevin Mack, who scored all three
Cleveland touchdowns, fumbled the ball away at the Bengals' 16 with five
minutes left. Then Stover hit the upright on a 47-yarder.;   "I hit it great,"
Stover said. "I wouldn't take anything back except to have it go through. It
hit way up on the upright -- it could have gone through from 60. There was a
wind blowing from right to left. The ball just hooked a little bit to the
left.";   The Bengals nearly celebrated too early. After three plays and a
punt, Bernie Kosar drove the Browns to the 17. Brennan then got open in the
corner of the end zone, but Kosar's perfect pass bounced off Brennan's
shoulder with seven seconds left.;   "I just dropped the ball," Brennan said.;
  "I couldn't believe he dropped it," Thomas said. "We've had so much bad
luck, we were overdue for good luck.";   Thomas delivered it on the next play,
sprinting in from the right side to block Stover's attempt harmlessly away.;  
Cincinnati's Boomer Esiason, who sat out the previous game with a shoulder
injury, threw a 2-yard TD pass to Mike Dingle and a 34-yarder to Eddie Brown.
Harold Green ran 24 times for 135 yards.;   Kosar completed 19 of 31 passes
for 285 yards, leaving him one pass shy of Bart Starr's NFL-record 294 passes
without an interception.;   "The records are nice when you get a lot older,"
Kosar said, "but right now I don't take much consolation in that."; BENGALS
23, BROWNS 21; (box) THE HERO: Eric Thomas blocked a 34-yard field-goal
attempt with time running out to preserve the victory.;   (box) THE GOAT: Matt
Stover, whose kick Thomas blocked, also missed a 47-yard field-goal try with
1:56 to play.;   (box) KEY PLAY: Cleveland's Brian Brennan dropped what would
have been a 17-yard touchdown pass from Bernie Kosar late in the game.  </TEXT>
