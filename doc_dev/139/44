The New England Patriots set some standards they probably would have wanted to 
avoid in their 37-7 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Patriots set a team 
record with their 10th consecutive defeat, a feat performed in front of the 
smallest crowd in the NFL so far this season. The attendance of 26,280 undercut 
the previous low of 28,924 for the Indianapolis Colts' game at New England Nov. 
11. Kansas City also set an NFL record with its sixth blocked punt. The victory 
was Kansas City's fourth in its past five games. Stephone Paige scored on an 
86-yard pass play from Steve DeBerg on the Chiefs' first play from scrimmage. 
It was Paige's longest reception in his eight-year career. 
</P>
<P>
The Cincinnati Bengals' 16-12 victory over Pittsburgh denied Steeler Coach 
Chuck Noll his 200th regular-season victory in 22 seasons. It was Cincinnati's 
sixth consecutive victory over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
The Buffalo Bills sacked Philadelphia quarterback Randall Cunningham six times 
in a 30-23 victory, ending the Eagles' winning streak at five games. Jim Kelly, 
with 334 yards passing, had his first 300-yard passing day of the season. James 
Lofton caught five of his passes for 174 yards to move into third place on the 
all-time receiving yardage list with 11,889, passing Don Maynard. Cunningham 
threw the NFL's longest touchdown of the season, a 95-yarder to Fred Barnett, 
but the Bills' heavy pass rush kept him from bringing Philadelphia back. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett ended a string of three games without a touchdown with four 
touchdown passes in the Rams' 38-23 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Henry 
Ellard led Ram receivers with six catches for 90 yards, giving him a 
team-record 402 receptions. He broke Tom Fears' record of 400. The loss was 
Cleveland's sixth in a row at home, a team record. 
</P>
<P>
Vinny Testaverde passed for 351 yards in the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' 23-17 
victory over Atlanta, handing the Falcons their fifth consecutive defeat and 
their 17th consecutive loss on the road. The victory ended the Buccaneers' 
six-game losing streak. Willie Drewrey's 89-yard touchdown reception from 
Testaverde was the longest in Tampa Bay history, breaking the record of 84 
yards from Doug Williams to Kevin House against Detroit in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Butler's field goal with 33 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter 
against Detroit was the 128th of career and tied him for the team record with 
Bob Thomas. Chicago quarterback Jim Harbaugh has thrown 146 consecutive passes 
without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's Art Monk caught 10 passes in the Redskins' victory over Miami, 
giving him 112 consecutive games with at least one reception. Gary Clark caught 
three passes to give him 402 receptions in six NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
With three receptions for 25 yards against Dallas, New Orleans wide receiver 
Eric Martin became the Saints' all-time leader in receiving yards. He has 321 
receptions for 4,890 yards, breaking the record of 4,875 yards in 309 
receptions set by Danny Abramowicz. Saint kicker Morten Anderson has scored in 
106 consecutive games. He kicked field goals of 43 and 50 yards and had one 
extra point. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's Marion Butts gained 159 yards in 26 carries against the New York 
Jets to become the seventh player in Charger history to rush for more than 
1,000 yard in a season. He has 1,154 yards this year. 
</P>
<P>
Norm Johnson's 42-yard field goal in overtime gave Seattle a 13-10 victory over 
the Houston Oilers. It was the fourth time the Seahawks had their game decided 
on the final play. They've won three of them, including a 13-10 victory at San 
Diego last Sunday on Johnson's 40-yard field goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
ROLE REVERSALS 
</P>
<P>
Before Sunday, the Miami Dolphins had the leading defense in the NFL; the 
Cincinnati Bengals' defense was No. 26 in the league. Chances are they'll be 
ranked a little closer this week. Earnest Byner ran for 157 yards and three 
touchdowns and the Washington Redskins riddled the Dolphins for 467 total yards 
in a 42-20 victory. The Redskins, who had three consecutive long scoring drives 
to take a 21-0 lead, had 222 rushing yards against a defense that had been 
giving up only 85 a game. Byner became the first player to rush for more 100 
yards against the Dolphins. Redskin quarterback Mark Rypien almost doubled the 
Miami season total for passing touchdowns allowed. Rypien threw three touchdown 
passes; the Dolphins had only given up four and had not allowed a touchdown 
through the air in five games. 
</P>
<P>
At Pittsburgh, the Steelers made the Bengals look their best, again. The 
Steelers had apparently righted their early-season offensive problems more than 
a month ago with one-sided victories over the Rams and Atlanta Falcons. Then 
they played the Bengals and were held without a touchdown in a 27-3 loss. The 
next week, the Steelers got back on track with a 24-7 victory over the Jets 
before Sunday's rematch with the Bengals. Cincinnati prevented a touchdown 
again with a 16-12 victory. The Steelers haven't scored a touchdown against the 
Bengals in 11 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller suffered a broken right clavicle in the third 
quarter against New Orleans and probably will not be able to throw for four or 
five months, Falcon Coach Jerry Glanville said. . . . Pittsburgh tackle Tunch 
Ilkin, sidelined for a month with a dislocated elbow, left in the third quarter 
against Cincinnati with a bruised back. . . . Detroit cornerback Bruce McNorton 
suffered a broken left arm in the first half against Chicago. . . . Phoenix 
running back Johnny Johnson left the game against Indianapolis in the second 
quarter after aggravating a twisted right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE BRADSHAW FACTOR 
</P>
<P>
Former Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Terry Bradshaw minced no words on "The 
NFL Today" on CBS before the Rams played the Browns at Cleveland Stadium. 
Bradshaw questioned the wisdom of Bernie Kosar's complaining about the 
dedication of his teammates and the Browns' management after last Sunday's 
30-13 loss to the Miami Dolphins. Bradshaw indicated he believed a player in a 
leadership position who takes a tack such as Kosar's could have a more 
detrimental effect on a team than help it, and he predicted a blowout victory 
for the Rams, who handed the Browns their seventh consecutive defeat, 38-23. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EASY MARK 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City linebacker Derrick Thomas, who began the day with a league-leading 
15 sacks, didn't play in the Chiefs' 37-7 victory over the New England Patriots 
at Foxboro, Mass. He rested a knee he injured last Sunday in a 27-24 victory 
over the Raiders. Apparently, the Chiefs didn't miss Thomas' contributions. 
Despite his absence, the Chiefs applied pressure on New England quarterback 
Tommy Hodson all day and sacked him six times. They lead the league with 42 
sacks this season. Defensive ends Bill Maas and Neil Smith had two sacks each. 
Hodson completed 20 of 39 passes for 211 yards, but he also had two passes 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
IN QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
New England Coach Ron Rust, after the Patriot's team-record 10th loss in a row, 
37-7 to the Kansas City Chiefs, was asked if his team had reached its low-water 
mark of the season: "I hope it is. I thought we hit it a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief quarterback Steve DeBerg, who passed for 312 yards in the first two 
quarters against the Patriots: "That's as well as I've ever seen an offense 
function for a full half." 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia's Seth Joyner, who intercepted a pass late in the 30-23 loss to 
Buffalo then fumbled the Eagles' chances away when he tried to lateral the ball 
to a teammate: "We're an opportunistic defense, an opportunistic team. We live 
by the sword and we die by the sword. Today, it didn't work for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's Bubby Brister, after a 16-12 loss to Cincinnati gave the Bengals 
a one-game lead over Pittsburgh in the AFC Central: "It's not over. If we win 
the rest of our games, we're 10-6 and that might be good enough to win the 
division. But everybody's angry: I'm angry, Chuck's (Noll) angry, the whole 
team's angry. We had too many opportunities to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle kicker Norm Johnson, after his field goal in overtime gave the 
Seahawks a 13-10 victory over Houston, the fourth Seattle game this season 
decided on the last play: "I kicked two field goals and an extra point and I'm 
completely exhausted. These kinds of games wear you out, even if you're a 
kicker." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
OOPS, GREAT CALL! 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Coach Mike Ditka's decision in overtime first looked like a blunder, 
then turned out fine in the Bears' 23-17 victory over the Detroit Lions. The 
Bears, who had tied the score, 17-17, on Kevin Butler's 19-yard field goal with 
33 seconds left in the fourth quarter, decided to defend the north goal and get 
a strong wind at their back. The Lions drove to the Chicago 17-yard line. Eddie 
Murray made a genius of Ditka and missed a field-goal attempt from 35 yards. 
The Bears then picked up three first downs before Jim Harbaugh and Neal 
Anderson connected on a 50-yard pass play for a touchdown and the victory. Said 
Ditka: "This isn't good for my health. We were fortunate, and sometimes in life 
you have to be fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
RIVALRY REBORN 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh, former first-round draft picks who battled for a 
starting position with the Dallas Cowboys, went head to head as opposing 
quarterbacks. The Cowboys' Aikman and Walsh, traded to the New Orleans Saints 
two months ago, were nearly identical statistically, but Aikman prevailed in a 
17-13 victory. He directed the Cowboys on two 80-yard touchdown drives in the 
second half. "Troy was just excellent," said Dallas Coach Jimmy Johnson. "Troy 
made some great plays . . . and, for the first time in 14 games, had no 
interceptions." 
</P>
<P>
Walsh completed 18 of 27 passes for 177 yards and no touchdowns; Aikman 
completed 15 of 21 for 177 yards and one touchdown. There were no 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE EASY WAY 
</P>
<P>
The Chicago Bears and San Francisco 49ers clinched their division championships 
Sunday off the field. The 49ers won the NFC West title when the New Orleans 
Saints were beaten by the Dallas Cowboys. After Chicago defeated the Detroit 
Lions in an afternoon game, the Minnesota Vikings defeated Green Bay at night. 
That victory gave the Bears the NFC Central championship.
