<TEXT>     Rice, the fourth player in league history to catch at least 100 passes in a
season, led all players with 78 votes.;    Montana was named to the team for a
third straight season. Rice and Lott were both repeaters.;    Notably missing
from the first team were Houston quarterback Warren Moon and linebackers Mike
Singletary of Chicago and Lawrence Taylor of the New York Giants.;    Moon led
the NFL in passing yardage with 4,689 and had a league-high 33 touchdown
passes. Singletary was on six previous first teams and Taylor had made it
eight times.; SHOFNER WON'T COACH: Jim Shofner will not return as Cleveland
Browns head coach next season but will be the team's director of player
personnel.;    Shofner's duties under the newly created position will include
evaluating Browns players as well as others in the NFL and in the college
ranks, team owner Art Modell said in a release.;    Shofner, 55, became
interim head coach in November after Bud Carson was fired.;    Team officials
said a new coach probably won't be named until next month.; ETC.: For the
second time this season, Pittsburgh Steelers running back Tim Worley said he
would welcome a trade. Worley was unhappy with Coach Chuck Noll's suggestion
this week he might move fullback Merril Hoge to halfback, Worley's position.
"That's telling you I'm not needed here," Worley said. . . . All-America
offensive lineman Ed King said he will give up his final year of eligibility
at Auburn and enter the NFL draft. King, a 6-foot-4, 285-pound junior guard,
was a semifinalist for the Lombardi Award and the Outland Trophy.  </TEXT>
