AFC LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, BUT WILL IT BE SUPER?; 
</P>
<P>
PREVIEW: BENGALS AND OILERS, WITH HIGH-TECH OFFENSES, HAVE BEST CHANCE TO 
OVERCOME SIX SUPER BOWL LOSSES IN A ROW.

<P>
In each of the past six years, the American Football Conference has resembled 
an express train moving smoothly through the countryside toward the end of the 
line, where it spectacularly derails. 
</P>
<P>
AFC teams have played the NFC on even terms each season since 1984, winning 
their share of the annual interconference series. Then each time, their 
champions have gotten untracked on the last afternoon, losing six consecutive 
Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody can really explain it," Cincinnati Bengal Coach Sam Wyche said the 
other day, reviewing the AFC's record slump. "But I can't see it going on much 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
Wyche's team, in fact, could reverse the momentum. The Bengals and Houston 
Oilers seem to be the best in their conference, and one or the other can be 
expected to represent the AFC in Super Bowl XXV, Jan. 27 in Tampa. 
</P>
<P>
Both are modern offensive teams. The Bengals play football the San Francisco 
49er way -- with a major new component, Wyche's no-huddle approach -- and the 
Oilers have converted to the run-and-shoot formation, which makes use of four 
wide receivers at all times. 
</P>
<P>
But they converted only a few weeks ago. The run and shoot is a radical 
departure from conventional football, and the Oilers may need a season of 
seasoning. The Bengals don't. 
</P>
<P>
Their time-proven offense took Wyche to the Super Bowl only 18 months ago, and 
that day, Cincinnati quarterback Boomer Esiason led Joe Montana's team until 
the last minute, when Montana, ending a 20-16 rouser, did what he usually does. 
</P>
<P>
This year, Cincinnati's problem is the potency of its own division, the AFC's 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals are looking for big trouble from all three of their Central 
Division rivals -- the Pittsburgh Steelers, Houston Oilers and Cleveland 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
They also expect trouble from the evenly matched top four in the AFC West: the 
Raiders, Kansas City Chiefs, Denver Broncos and San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
These are the AFC's big eight -- of whom only five can make the 1990 playoffs 
along with an Eastern entry, the New York Jets or Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Under a revised playoff system, three wild-card teams from each conference will 
compete with the six division winners, starting Jan. 5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches expect Denver to be one of the AFC's six. The Broncos are a more 
solid group than they seemed in Super Bowl XXIV, where Montana led the 49ers to 
a 55-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
That was the third of four jolts that Denver Coach Dan Reeves has taken in the 
past four years. His recent heart attack followed three Super Bowl losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Bouncing back is what life is all about," he said last week. 
</P>
<P>
He's right about that, although this season, it will be either Cincinnati or 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
The AFC top 10: 
</P>
<P>
1) CINCINNATI BENGALS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Boomer Esiason 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Sam Wyche (51-47) 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals and 49ers are both led by Bill Walsh-trained coaches, Wyche and 
George Seifert, and their modern offenses are similar. A possibly decisive 
difference is that the 49ers spend heavily for talent. In contrast, one of 
Cincinnati's best two linemen, Max Montoya, went to the Raiders in the kind of 
Plan B exodus that San Francisco avoids by outbidding everyone else. Nor have 
the Bengals replaced injured back Ickey Woods. They can still win with Wyche's 
no-huddle offense. 
</P>
<P>
2) HOUSTON OILERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Warren Moon 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Jack Pardee (first year) 
</P>
<P>
Their opponents describe this team's talent as the best that ever lined up in 
the run-and-shoot formation, which Pardee previously brought to two other 
Houston winners: the United States Football League's Gamblers and the Southwest 
Conference's Cougars. The Oilers' unsurpassed blocking starts with Bruce 
Matthews, the receiving with Drew Hill and Ernest Givins. A defensive 
specialist, Pardee will address the problems on that side. The question is how 
fast they can adjust to a strange new offense. 
</P>
<P>
3) DENVER BRONCOS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: John Elway 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dan Reeves (91-55-1) 
</P>
<P>
Their Super Bowl wipeout last winter is still held against the Broncos by the 
same people who seem to forget that in Montana's three-game playoff parade, the 
49ers rolled over the Vikings and Rams the same way. Last year, when the 
Broncos' ancient weaknesses evaporated with a new defense and runner, Bobby 
Humphrey, they were 6-0 over the AFC in oxygen-thin Mile High Stadium. Nobody 
in the NFL comes close to matching Denver's home-field edge. 
</P>
<P>
4) PITTSBURGH STEELERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Bubby Brister 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Chuck Noll (193-140-1) 
</P>
<P>
Having survived the winning '70s and slumping '80s, Noll hits the '90s with a 
good, young offense and improving defensive personnel. His Merrill Hoge-Tim 
Worley backfield became the NFL's best last year, and new coordinator Joe 
Walton will help the offense. The two questions: Is Brister an NFL comer? Can 
the defense hold the edge it got last year with coordinator Rod Rust, the new 
coach at New England? The defensive standout is cornerback Rod Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
5) SAN DIEGO CHARGERS 
</P>
<P>
QB: Mark Vlasic, Billy Joe Tolliver 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Dan Henning (6-10) 
</P>
<P>
With either youngster pitching for San Diego, the question is whether the 
Broncos, Chargers, Raiders or Chiefs will break out of the pack in a year when 
Denver has the only established quarterback. At most other positions, San Diego 
could be slightly ahead with runner Marion Butts, receiver Anthony Miller, 
linebacker Billy Ray Smith and the depth stored by former General Manager Steve 
Ortmayer and the incumbent, Bobby Beathard. 
</P>
<P>
6) RAIDERS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Jay Schroeder 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Art Shell (7-5) 
</P>
<P>
See paragraph above for a more exact placing of the Raiders, who, in various 
media surveys, have been ranked from first to last in their division -- and who 
have been mentioned by others for both the Super Bowl and the AFC cellar. They 
seem clearly stronger defensively and in the offensive line, and they have the 
fastest receivers in football. All they want from Schroeder is occasional 
accuracy on their favorite missile, the long, long pass to one of those 
receivers. 
</P>
<P>
7) KANSAS CITY CHIEFS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Steve DeBerg 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Marty Schottenheimer 
</P>
<P>
(8-7-1) 
</P>
<P>
If for once DeBerg could play like Bernie Kosar or Jim Kelly, the Chiefs would 
jump to the head of the class in the AFC and even worry the NFC in the Super 
Bowl. They're sound enough elsewhere. They have a few receivers and a big 
running back, Christian Okoye, and at linebacker they line up an MVP-type in 
Derrick Thomas who would make any defense look good. When they have all their 
players, their secondary is among the finest. But it's really all up to DeBerg. 
</P>
<P>
8) CLEVELAND BROWNS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Bernie Kosar 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bud Carson (10-7-1) 
</P>
<P>
Carson was 58 last year when they finally gave him an NFL team, and he won a 
division title. Then the Browns beat Buffalo in the playoffs before losing the 
AFC title game again in Denver. Although their quarterback ranks with the NFL's 
best, the Browns may otherwise be a touch short in talent. Still, some people 
say they'll win again with running backs Eric Metcalf and Kevin Mack, and with 
Clay Matthews and Michael Dean Perry on defense. 
</P>
<P>
9) BUFFALO BILLS 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback: Jim Kelly 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Marv Levy (31-26) 
</P>
<P>
In a slumping division, this team hasn't taken charge as surely as its fans 
thought it would with its intellectual coach, belligerent quarterback, diligent 
general manager, Bill Polian, and its assortment of defensive stars -- Bruce 
Smith, Shane Conlan, Cornelius Bennett and others. They say in Buffalo that 
Kelly's talent has been diluted by abrasive relationships with teammates, but 
there's probably nothing wrong with the Bills that more consistency wouldn't 
cure. 
</P>
<P>
10) NEW YORK JETS 
</P>
<P>
QB: Ken O'Brien, Tony Eason 
</P>
<P>
Coach: Bruce Coslet (first year) 
</P>
<P>
A new general manager, Dick Steinberg, has brought in a new coach from the Bill 
Walsh school. And although the Jets in a rebuilding year might be over their 
heads in other divisions, they can make a run for it in the East if either 
passer is up to it. Some NFL club executives are predicting that in time, 
Steinberg and the AFC's other new general managers -- Beathard and Kansas 
City's Carl Peterson among them -- will end the NFC's Super Bowl dominance. 
</P>
<P>
THE OTHERS 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
WEST 
</P>
<P>
After Denver, San Diego, the Raiders and Kansas City line up one through four, 
there is only one place left for the Seattle Seahawks. It is improbable, 
though, that they'll actually finish fifth. Their coach, Chuck Knox, has a way 
of hanging tough against any odds, and his defense will improve when he gets in 
his first draft pick, flashy lineman Cortez Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
In Knox's offensive backfield, John L. Williams has the look of a run-and-shoot 
triple threat -- runner-receiver-blocker -- which is one reason the Seahawks 
may be in that formation more extensively than they now expect. 
</P>
<P>
Top to bottom, the AFC West has been called a strong division that would be one 
of the NFL's strongest if it had more quarterbacks of proven worth. The Elway 
contribution can be measured in one statistic: Of the AFC's 14 teams, the 
Broncos alone played in three 1980s Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
Many scouts reason that the Chiefs and Chargers are set at most positions and, 
with Carl Peterson and Bobby Beathard rounding up talent, both soon may stand 
with the NFL's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CENTRAL 
</P>
<P>
In this division last year, in one of the NFL's closest races of all time, 
Cleveland finished 9-6-1, Houston 9-7, Pittsburgh 9-7 and Cincinnati 8-8. It 
will come as no surprise to most in the AFC Central if the standings are the 
same this year -- or if they're just the reverse, with the Browns a half-game 
behind the others. 
</P>
<P>
Few NFL teams match the quality of the Cincinnati nucleus: blocker Anthony 
Munoz, receiver Eddie Brown, tight end Rodney Holman, runner James Brooks, 
passer Boomer Esiason, nose tackle Tim Krumrie and safety David Fulcher. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland quarterback Bernie Kosar will have a fourth offensive coordinator in 
four years, Jim Shofner. 
</P>
<P>
The primary AFC Central question is how much Warren Moon will shake things up 
in Houston's run and shoot, and the mystery team is Pittsburgh, which, to many 
AFC critics, seems to be on the way up again. But Pittsburgh's Brister is the 
least experienced quarterback in a division with three giants, Moon, Esiason 
and Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EAST 
</P>
<P>
Some of the NFL's most famous winners have come out of the franchises in this 
division -- the Jets with Joe Namath, the Dolphins with Bob Griese and Dan 
Marino, the Colts with John Unitas and Eric Dickerson, the Bills with O.J. 
Simpson, and, most recently, a New England Super Bowl team. 
</P>
<P>
But to many in the AFC East, their division is in disarray -- although the 
Bills could still come back this year, and the Jets could come up. 
</P>
<P>
In Miami, Dan Marino keeps asking to be traded. Maybe he's saying something 
more. At 29, he's still the world's best passer. The question is whether Coach 
Don Shula, 60, has enough help besides receiver Mark Clayton and cornerback Tim 
McKyer. 
</P>
<P>
When the Colts drafted Jeff George last spring, they disclosed that they had 
the NFL's next great quarterback -- but he won't prove it this year. With Eric 
Dickerson out, Coach Ron Meyer has been left with not much but a linebacker, 
Duane Bickett, who can't run the ball or pass it. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots are stocked with above-average players, none of them at 
quarterback. Though well-coached by rookie Rod Rust, 61, they are unlikely to 
overtake anyone except Indianapolis.
