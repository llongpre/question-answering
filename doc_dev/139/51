</DATELINE>

<P>
Starting tight end Clarence Kay of the Denver Broncos suffered a pulled thigh 
muscle in practice, putting his status for Sunday's AFC championship game in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Kay injured the muscle in his left thigh while running wind sprints at the end 
of Wednesday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, you'd have to list him as doubtful," Denver Coach Dan Reeves said. 
"If it's sore today, I'd say it would be even more sore tomorrow. And he 
doesn't have much time to recover. A thigh muscle is awful hard to come back 
from." 
</P>
<P>
If Kay can't play on Sunday against the Cleveland Browns, it would be a blow to 
Denver's running game. Kay is considered one of the best run-blocking tight 
ends in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Reeves said Pat Kelly probably will make his first pro start if Kay can't play, 
with Orson Mobley in reserve. The Broncos might also activate former USC tight 
end Paul Green. 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Newsome of the Browns has reached all but one of his goals in pro 
football. And time is running out in his quest to reach the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"I've accomplished everything a tight end can accomplish except getting the 
opportunity to play in the Super Bowl," Newsome said. "That's the one thing 
that has eluded me. I guess that's why this has such a big meaning to me." 
</P>
<P>
The 33-year-old Newsome is the NFL's all-time leading tight end with 639 
receptions -- fifth among all receivers. His streak of 150 consecutive games 
with at least one catch ended Oct. 29 against Houston, but he has remained an 
important part of the offense. In last week's 34-30 victory over Buffalo, he 
had four catches for 35 yards. 
</P>
<P>
For the last several weeks, his resolve to retire at the end of the season 
seems to have weakened, and Newsome now says he won't make a final decision on 
his career until the Browns finish the year. 
</P>
<P>
His teammates, however, are treating the playoffs as though they are Newsome's 
last gasp. Cleveland's kicking team chanted his name before the opening kickoff 
against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
So they're 0-3 in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
So another loss in the big game will tie them with Minnesota for the worst 
Super Bowl record. 
</P>
<P>
But the Denver Broncos are still willing to risk everything for another chance 
at the Big One. 
</P>
<P>
And, yes, they are fully aware of the talk of the town: if the Broncos are 
going to be humiliated again in the Super Bowl, they're better off losing 
Sunday's AFC championship game against Cleveland before they even get to New 
Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
"We've heard that they're saying, 'Hopefully we won't go back because we don't 
want to go and lose again,' " quarterback John Elway said. "Those people who 
ask, 'Why go back?' ought to go hide in their closets. That's the easy way out. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a chance, at least a chance to step up to bat. We'll give it all we've 
got. If we lose, we lose. If we win, we're world champs. I'd hate to be stuck 
in my closet. No one wants to go 0-4 like the Minnesota Vikings, but I'm not 
worried about that."
