The names and addresses of two Cleveland Browns football players and a 
Cleveland Indians baseball player appear in a black book seized by police from 
the alleged ringleader of a prostitution ring, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported Sunday a claim by police that prostitutes 
from a call girl ring also worked in other National Football League cities has 
prompted Browns officials to notify the NFL about the case. 
</P>
<P>
Among the names in the black book are quarterback Bernie Kosar and cornerback 
Hanford Dixon of the Browns and Indians outfielder Mel Hall, the Plain Dealer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar and Dixon declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Byrne, Browns spokesman, said the Browns' director of security, Ted 
Chappelle, telephoned NFL security personnel on Wednesday to alert them to 
allegations that have surfaced since the Jan. 13 arrest of Karen M. Panek, 37. 
</P>
<P>
Panek, who pleaded not guilty Friday to a charge of promoting prostitution, 
allegedly operated a ring involving about 40 suburban women under the guise of 
escort services in Cleveland and Akron. Panek's lawyer, Stuart H. Lippe, has 
insisted that a black book containing about 100 names that was seized by police 
is only an address book. 
</P>
<P>
Browns officials suggested that Dixon's name was in the book because of his 
involvement with a March of Dimes fund-raising auction in which Panek bid $600 
for a date with him. They said Panek became angry when Dixon refused to go 
through with the date. 
</P>
<P>
Hall said he knew Panek only casually because they had once lived in the same 
building. 
</P>
<P>
Browns owner Art Modell said he had agreed to talk about the appearance of 
players' names in the black book "because this involves the reputations of some 
very important people to us." 
</P>
<P>
Byrne, who said he discussed the black book with Kosar last week, described the 
quarterback as extremely upset that his name had become associated with Panek 
by somehow getting into her black book. Byrne said Kosar had told him he didn't 
remember ever meeting Panek and didn't know why his name was in the book.
