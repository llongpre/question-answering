<LEADPARA>  "That was as much fun as I've had in a game in a long time," Denver Broncos
quarterback John Elway said, and no one could argue.;   Least of all the
Cincinnati Bengals, who had no solution for the multi-faceted attack that
riddled them for 471 total yards in a 45-14 rout Sunday in Denver.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Just where that sudden display of firepower came from, no one knew,
including Elway.;   "Not after the way the preseason went," Elway said.;   The
Broncos, missing running back Bobby Humphrey, who remains a holdout, had shown
little offensive progress in exhibition play, averaging just 10 points and 221
yards per outing. Elway was calling his own plays for the first time in his
career, but the results had been spotty.;   Somehow, it all came together.
Elway threw two touchdown passes and ran for two touchdowns. Gaston Green, who
replaced Humphrey, had a career-high 116 yards rushing on 24 carries. The
Broncos had 25 first downs to just 10 for the Bengals, produced nearly twice
the yardage the Bengals could muster (471-246), and controlled the ball by
nearly a 2-to-1 margin (38 minutes, 59 seconds to 21:01).;   The Broncos
exploded for five long scoring drives, including Elway's 52-yard TD pass to
Michael Young. Elway completed 18 of 28 passes for 262 yards, and ran three
times for 9 yards.;   Even the Broncos' defense got into the act, intercepting
three passes by Boomer Esiason, one of which was returned 52 yards by Tyrone
Braxton for a touchdown.; BEARS 10, VIKINGS 6: It was all defense as host
Chicago beat Minnesota on Kevin Butler's second-chance 22-yard field goal with
5:54 left in the game and Jim Harbaugh's 37-yard touchdown pass to Tom Waddle
near the end of the first half.;   With Chicago leading 7-6, Donnell Woolford
intercepted Wade Wilson's pass and returned 16 yards to the Minnesota 49. The
Bears moved it to the 23 before Butler attempted a 42-yard field goal that was
wide. But Audray McMillan was penalized for roughing the kicker and Butler
limped off the field.;   The penalty gave the Bears the ball at the 12, but
they couldn't make a first down and Butler limped back and kicked his
22-yarder.;   It was the eighth straight opening-day victory for the Bears,
the longest current streak in the NFL.; CHIEFS 14, FALCONS 3: Christian Okoye
ran for 143 yards, scored one touchdown and set up another with a 48-yard
gallop as the Chiefs opened the season with a victory over Atlanta in Kansas
City, Mo.;   Cornerback Albert Lewis had three interceptions for the Chiefs,
tying a personal best he recorded in 1985, also against the Falcons. Atlanta
also lost two fumbles.; PATRIOTS 16, COLTS 7: Tommy Hodson passed for one
touchdown and Jason Staurovsky kicked three field goals in Indianapolis as New
England snapped a 14-game losing streak and gave the Colts their eighth
straight NFL season-opening loss.;   It was the Patriots' first victory since
the second game of last season, also against the Colts in the Hoosier Dome,
and it gave Dick MacPherson a victory in his NFL coaching debut.; SAINTS 27,
SEAHAWKS 24: Bobby Hebert, playing his first game after a one-year contract
holdout, threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Floyd Turner on fourth down with
1:11 to play as the Saints beat Seattle in New Orleans.;   It was a bitter
defeat for the Seahawks, who lost quarterback Dave Krieg with a broken right
thumb. An apparent Seattle TD pass was wiped out by a penalty, and then the
Seahawks' game-ending 37-yard field-goal attempt sailed wide. The kick was
made 15 yards longer because the Seahawks bench was assessed an
unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty for arguing the end-zone call.; COWBOYS 26,
BROWNS 14: Troy Aikman, playing completely healthy for the first time since
college, passed for 274 yards and two touchdowns as Dallas defeated the Browns
in Cleveland.;   The Cowboys improved their NFL-best record in openers to
24-7-1 and wrecked the coaching debut of Cleveland's Bill Belichick.;   Aikman
directed the Cowboys to scores on all four of their first-half possessions.;
JETS 16, BUCCANEERS 13: Pat Leahy, at 40 the NFL's oldest player, kicked three
field goals, including a 40-yarder with 1:22 remaining to beat Tampa Bay in
East Rutherford, N.J.;   Blair Thomas, the second overall pick in the 1990
draft, rushed for 92 yards and picked up several critical first downs for New
York.; REDSKINS 45, LIONS 0: Host Washington intercepted three passes by
quarterback Rodney Peete, covered one fumble and built a 35-0 halftime lead in
routing Detroit.;   After Gary Clark caught a 38-yard touchdown pass from Mark
Rypien in the third period to make it 42-0, Coach Joe Gibbs infuriated the
crowd by refusing to go for touchdowns on two thrusts inside Detroit's 10-yard
line in the final seven minutes.;   Rypien completed 15 of 19 passes for 183
yards and two touchdowns, Clark caught six passes for 107 yards, and running
back Earnest Byner, who passed 18 yards to Ricky Sanders for a touchdown, led
the rushers with 83 yards in 16 carries. Washington, in rolling up its biggest
opening-day margin of victory, finished with 390 total yards to 141 for
Detroit.  </TEXT>
