GAME OF THE DAY 
</P>
<P>
New York Giants (9-4) at Denver (10-3), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 2. 
</P>
<P>
This was shaping up as a possible Super Bowl preview until the Giants lost 
their last two games and fell into a tie for the NFC East lead with 
Philadelphia. The Giants beat Denver in the Super Bowl nearly three years ago 
at Pasadena, 39-20, but the Broncos are a different team these days, with Bobby 
Humphrey to go with John Elway on offense and a much stronger defense. The 
Giants have gotten a lot of mileage from Ottis Anderson, but Phil Simms has 
struggled with a knee injury. Lawrence Taylor, who played only a half last week 
with a hairline fracture in his foot, has 12 sacks and should be up for the 
chase against Elway.

INTERCONFERENCE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans (6-7) at Buffalo (8-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills have lost two of their last three but hold a one-game lead in the AFC 
East because Miami has lost two in row. The Saints seemed headed for the 
playoffs after overcoming a 1-4 start, but have lost two in a row. Buffalo 
figures to muster more offense with Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas at chilly Rich 
Stadium. Saint Coach Jim Mora replaced struggling quarterback Bobby Hebert last 
week with John Fourcade, who may start. The Bills are 6-1 at home, the Saints 
are 4-2 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City (6-6-1) at Green Bay (8-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
These teams are the two biggest surprises in the NFL this season. The Packers 
are tied with Minnesota atop the NFC Central and Kansas City still is in the 
hunt for a wild-card berth. Green Bay has done it with quarterback Don 
Majkowski, who leads the NFL with 3,719 yards and 24 touchdowns, and a defense 
that has allowed 20 or fewer points in five of the last six games. The Chiefs 
give the ball to Christian Okoye, who has 1,191 yards and 10 touchdowns, and 
leave the rest to the NFL's No. 2-ranked defense. Of Green Bay's 13 games, 10 
have been decided by four points or fewer. The Chiefs are 1-4-1 on the road, 
the Packers are 7-1 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay (5-8) at Houston (8-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers lead Cleveland by half a game and Cincinnati by a game in the AFC 
Central, but play the Bengals next week before finishing the season with 
Cleveland. Houston has won three of four games, Warren Moon driving the Oilers 
to Lorenzo White's winning touchdown with 21 seconds left last week at 
Pittsburgh. Vinny Testaverde's nemesis, the interception, cropped up five times 
last week in Tampa Bay's loss to Green Bay. Houston is 5-2 at home. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego (4-9) at Washington (7-6), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers are sticking with rookie Billy Joe Tolliver at quarterback, even 
though he threw for two interceptions and was sacked five times by the New York 
Jets last week. San Diego has some promise on offense with runner Marion Butts 
and receiver Anthony Miller, but has scored more than 20 points just twice this 
season. The Redskins, hanging in the playoff race, have won two straight games 
impressively with Mark Rypien at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Seattle (5-8) at Cincinnati (7-6), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
After having been benched for two games in favor of young Kelly Stouffer, 
quarterback Dave Krieg led the Seahawks past Buffalo Monday night. The Bengals 
are tied with the Raiders and Miami for the AFC's last playoff spot, but still 
can win the title in the AFC Central. Cincinnati defeated Seattle last season 
in the playoffs at Riverfront Stadium, 21-13. The Bengals rushed for 254 yards 
in that game and will attack Seattle, ranked 24th against the run, with the 
NFL's most productive ground game. James Brooks has gained 1,065 yards this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (7-5-1) at Indianapolis (6-7), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Bernie Kosar's sore elbow sent him to the bench early in the Browns' 21-0 loss 
to Cincinnati last week and backup Mike Pagel could start against the Colts, 
his former team. The Browns are 0-2-1 since ending a four-game winning streak. 
The Colts probably lost out on the playoffs in a 22-10 defeat against New 
England last week. Eric Dickerson has gained at least 1,000 yards for the 
seventh consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
New England (5-8) at Miami (7-6), 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: ESPN 
</P>
<P>
Miami's playoff chances have been jolted by consecutive losses to Pittsburgh 
and Kansas City after the Dolphins had moved into a tie with Buffalo for the 
AFC East lead. Marc Wilson, starting for the first time in two years, led the 
Patriots past Indianapolis last week. Miami's Dan Marino has passed for 3,208 
yards and 21 touchdowns. The Dolphins ended a seven-game losing streak against 
the Patriots 12 weeks ago, 24-10. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh (6-7) at New York Jets (4-9), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers, after consecutive wins over San Diego and Miami, probably lost 
out on the playoffs last week in a last-minute loss to Houston. Quarterback 
Bubby Brister is a real threat again with his injured knee mended. New York has 
won two in a row for the first time this season, but it may be too late for 
Coach Joe Walton. The Jets beat Pittsburgh last season, 24-20. New York is 1-5 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Detroit (4-9) at Chicago (6-7), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
If the Bears can beat anybody, it may be the Lions, who have lost 10 in a row 
to Chicago. Detroit, though, is improving by the week, having won three of its 
last four games, against contenders Green Bay, Cleveland and New Orleans. The 
Lions have played well lately with either Rodney Peete, who has a knee injury, 
or Bob Gagliano at quarterback. Chicago has mostly struggled with Mike Tomczak 
or Jim Harbaugh. The Bears beat the Lions 11 weeks ago, 47-27. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta (3-10) at Minnesota (8-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings need this one with a Cleveland-Cincinnati finish in their battle 
with Green Bay for the NFC Central title. Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller will 
be chased by Minnesota's front four, which is after the NFL sack record. Keith 
Millard has 16 sacks, Chris Doleman 14, Al Noga 9 1/2 and Henry Thomas eight. 
Atlanta is 0-7 on the road, Minnesota is 6-0 at home. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas (1-12) at Philadelphia (9-4), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Johnson's Thanksgiving Day charges that Buddy Ryan is a bounty hunter 
lend spice to this one. Troy Aikman threw for four touchdown passes last week 
with little pass rush from the Rams, but Reggie White and the Eagles ought to 
pressure him. Philadelphia has beaten Dallas four consecutive times, including 
27-0 on Thanksgiving.
