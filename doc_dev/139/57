<TEXT>
<P>
Once upon a not-too-long-ago, the Chargers wanted to hire Marty Schottenheimer 
as their head coach. Schottenheimer, the winningest head coach in the AFC the 
past 3 seasons, became available last month when he quit his job with the 
Cleveland Browns in a personnel dispute with owner Art Modell. 
</P>
<P>
But, said Charger owner Alex Spanos Tuesday, "he (Schottenheimer) wanted total 
change. His demands were a little bit more than what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
What Schottenheimer wanted in San Diego was clearance to bring in his own 
staff. The Chargers balked. So Tuesday, Schottenheimer accepted the vacant head 
coaching job in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"In the course of my discussions with the Chargers, we covered a lot of 
ground," Schottenheimer said. "But no formal offer was forthcoming. Economics 
were not an issue. Alex indicated there were a number of people (current 
Charger assistants) he felt were capable. I didn't disagree with that. I just 
felt after discussions with Alex and Steve (Ortmayer, the Charger director of 
football operations) that the Kansas City situation afforded me more of a 
chance to get things straightened away in the most comfortable manner." 
</P>
<P>
The closest thing to a shot fired by either Spanos or Schottenheimer came when 
Schottenheimer told Kansas City reporters Tuesday: "I'm not interested in a 
rebuilding program." 
</P>
<P>
It's obvious he considered the Chargers to be in that category even though they 
finished with a better record (6-10) in 1988 than the Chiefs (4-11-1). 
Schottenheimer also said he considered Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and Art Rooney, 
the late Steelers owner, to be the top two owners he has known in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer's 4-year agreement with Kansas City temporarily moved George 
Seifert, the San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator, to the head of the 
Chargers' list of potential successors to fired Al Saunders. Spanos and 
Ortmayer were scheduled to meet with Seifert Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
But the Chargers apparently are not at the top of Seifert's list. Modell said 
Tuesday that Seifert called him Monday night and "asked if he could come to 
Cleveland for an interview. We said, 'By all means.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Seifert said he wanted to wait until 49er Coach Bill Walsh decided 
whether he was going to retire after leading San Francisco to its third world 
championship in 8 years. But more than one NFL source has suggested Walsh might 
be delaying his decision in hopes of squeezing 49er owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. 
into renegotiating his contract and making him the first $2-million-a-year 
coach in the NFL. Seifert's active pursuit of the Browns' job is an indication 
he believes Walsh will return. 
</P>
<P>
That would leave Washington assistant Dan Henning as the leading candidate for 
the Charger job, although there's a school of thought that the chances of Ron 
Lynn, the current Charger defensive coordinator, grow by the day. "He's still 
being considered," Spanos said. 
</P>
<P>
The top longshot is former Illinois Coach Mike White. 
</P>
<P>
All three have strengths and weaknesses in the Chargers' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
Henning is the only one of the three with NFL head coaching experience. Plus, 
he has worked in Washington with Jerry Rhome, the Charger offensive 
coordinator. He has also indicated a willingness to work with the Charger staff 
if he gets the job. 
</P>
<P>
But Henning's 4-year coaching record in Atlanta was an horrendous 22-41-1. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn is seen as an defensive innovator with a reputation for producing great 
results with limited talent. White, a disciple of Walsh, has a similar 
reputation on the offensive side. 
</P>
<P>
White is out of coaching and working for a football scouting service in Newport 
Beach. Lynn remains under the Chargers' employ. But the archrival Raiders are 
pursuing him as a successor to fired defensive coordinator Charlie Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
Lynn is not trying to pressure the Chargers. But he knows he can't hold the 
Raiders off forever. "I'd like to have seen this all cleared up a week ago," he 
said. "But I don't see this (the prolonged search) as critical." 
</P>
<P>
The worst-case scenario for Lynn is the Raiders deciding on someone else to 
replace Sumner, followed by the Chargers' hiring of a head coach who wants to 
bring in his own defensive coordinator. The latter would have been the case 
with Schottenheimer. 
</P>
<P>
But it was a measure of the Chargers' desire to keep Lynn in their organization 
that they wouldn't accept Schottenheimer without requiring him to keep Lynn. 
</P>
<P>
Ortmayer speaks with Lynn frequently. Henning is scheduled to visit Spanos and 
Ortmayer in San Diego later this week. White and Ortmayer reportedly also will 
meet soon. 
</P>
<P>
Spanos said he hopes the Chargers will be able to name their new coach by "the 
end of next week." 
</P>
<P>
Charger Notes 
</P>
<P>
Many people are still waiting for Charger owner Alex Spanos to comment on the 
firing of Al Saunders last month. But Spanos has been mostly silent on the 
subject. "It's all behind us," Spanos said Tuesday. "I wish him (Saunders) all 
the luck. I'm sure he'll do well." Pressed on the matter, Spanos said, "I'd 
rather go on with the future."
