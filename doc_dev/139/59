NEWSWIRE: KANSAS CITY NAMES SCHOTTENHEIMER AS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Marty Schottenheimer, who had resigned as coach of the Cleveland Browns at the 
end of the season in a dispute with owner Art Modell, was named coach of the 
Kansas City Chiefs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Schottenheimer, 45, took the Browns to the playoffs in each of his 4 full 
seasons as coach. His 32-15 regular-season record the last 3 years is unmatched 
in the AFC and ranks behind only Mike Ditka of the Chicago Bears and Bill Walsh 
of the San Francisco 49ers among National Football League coaches. 
</P>
<P>
His resignation from the Browns was triggered by his refusal to hire an 
offensive coordinator, a role he was filling. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would hire an offensive coordinator with the Chiefs, Schottenheimer 
broke into a grin. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have an individual to fill that role," he said. "Rest easy. Marty 
Schottenheimer is not going to call the plays. Someone will have that role, if 
not the title."
