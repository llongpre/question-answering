<TEXT>     Former offensive coordinator Jim Shofner finished the season as interim
coach but took his name out of the running.;    Cleveland's 3-13 mark was the
worst in the franchise's 41-year NFL history.;    Belichick's prospects of
becoming a head coach were enhanced by the Giants' defensive performance last
season, including their 20-19 Super Bowl win over the Buffalo Bills. He also
was a candidate for the Tampa Bay vacancy, which went to former Bucs assistant
Richard Williamson on Monday.;    Browns owner Art Modell chose Belichick over
several other candidates, including Los Angeles Raiders quarterbacks coach
Mike White and former Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur.;  
 "I've been disappointed before, but I don't expect to be disappointed this
time." Modell said. "We're not a 3-13 team, nor are we a 13-3 team. I think we
are a competitive team. I will not give him nor myself a time frame. I tried
that before and it doesn't work.";    The Raiders' Art Shell, 44, had been the
NFL's youngest head coach.; NEW DEAL FOR DITKA: Chicago Bears Coach Mike Ditka
agreed to a new three-year contract. The deal is worth an average of about $1
million a year, according to a report on WBBM-TV in Chicago.; ETC.: Mouse
Davis will be named as coach of the New York Knights of the World League of
American Football, the New York Times reported. . . . Earl Leggett will rejoin
the Raiders as a defensive-line coach. Leggett was a Raiders assistant from
1980 until 1988, then spent two seasons with Denver.  </TEXT>
