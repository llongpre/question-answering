PAUL BROWN IN HOSPITAL WITH BLOOD CLOT

Cincinnati Bengal founder Paul Brown is recoverying from a blood clot in his 
leg that forced him to be hospitalized during the weekend, according to the 
team's doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. said the problem wasn't serious, and Brown should be able 
to go home today. 
</P>
<P>
Brown, 82, was in Christ Hospital when his team lost to the San Francisco 
49ers, 20-17, in overtime Sunday. It was the first time Brown had missed one of 
the Bengals' home games. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in his first four games as the Cleveland Browns' head coach, Jim 
Shofner has given up any hope of returning to the same job next season. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, I wasn't the answer," Shofner said Monday. "Certainly I inherited a 
lot of circumstances. You can say there are all these reasons why, and maybe 
they're legitimate. But it still adds up to the same thing -- I didn't get it 
done." 
</P>
<P>
The Browns lost to Houston, 58-14, Sunday, giving up more points than they had 
ever given up in a regular-season game. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka got into a heated exchange with a reporter 
Monday, broke off his weekly news conference and stomped out of the room. 
</P>
<P>
The outburst was triggered when Red Mottlow of Chicago's WFYR radio asked Ditka 
about the Bears' offensive showing in Sunday's 10-9 loss to the Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
"What's wrong?" Mottlow asked. 
</P>
<P>
Ditka replied: "They got a pretty good defense, Red, and they stopped us! Why 
don't you talk about how good they played instead of our problems." 
</P>
<P>
Ditka then swore and told Mottlow, "You're a joke." 
</P>
<P>
After somebody else asked a question, Ditka said, "You want to get answers to 
what you need, get them from Red Mottlow. He's the expert on everything."
