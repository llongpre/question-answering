<LEADPARA>  Chuck Klingbeil's first NFL touchdown helped Don Shula to his 300th NFL
victory, and that, the coach said, "wasn't in the script.";   Klingbeil, a
reserve nose tackle, recovered Don Majkowski's fourth-quarter fumble in the
end zone to lift Miami into a tie, and Pete Stoyanovich kicked a 31-yard field
goal that gave the Dolphins (2-2) a 16-13 victory Sunday over the visiting
Green Bay Packers (1-3).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I'm glad it's in the can. It won't be one I'll pull out and look at a
lot," said Shula, who was drenched with a bucket of water by his players when
the game ended.;   After Green Bay scored 13 consecutive points to take a 13-6
lead, Majkowski dropped back to pass in the end zone, then dropped the ball
without being touched.;   "My hands were really just perspiring," said
Majkowski, blaming the 86-degree weather for his fumble. "I was very wet. The
ball just slipped out of my hands.";   Klingbeil, who is on the roster only
because two other nose tackles are hurt, was delighted to be linked with
Shula's landmark win.;   "It makes it even sweeter," he said. "It makes you
part of history.";   The victory came on the 28th anniversary of Shula's first
NFL coaching win in 1963, when the Baltimore Colts beat the 49ers 20-14.;  
Shula, 61, has a career record of 300-139-6 (.682). He is second in victories
to the late George Halas, who was 325-151-31 (.672).; GIANTS 13, BROWNS 10: In
East Rutherford, N.J., New York's defense did just fine in front of its former
leader, Cleveland Coach Bill Belichick.;   The Giants (2-2) limited the Browns
(2-2) to 27 total yards in the first half and 145 for the game.;   Cleveland
rallied from a 13-0 deficit and got to the New York 38 in the final four
minutes, but Bernie Kosar was sacked by Carl Banks for a 7-yard loss on
third-and-three.;   "We didn't make the block," said Belichick, who was the
Giants' defensive coordinator for eight years before taking over the Browns
after the Giants won last season's Super Bowl. "Carl Banks is a great athlete
and he made a great play."; LIONS 33, COLTS 24: Barry Sanders won the battle
of great running backs past and present as Detroit (3-1) beat host
Indianapolis (0-4).;   Sanders turned in the second-best rushing day of his
career, gaining 179 yards in 30 carries to overshadow the Colts' Eric
Dickerson, who was held to a career-low 17 yards but became the NFL's fourth
all-time leading rusher.;   The Lions' Jerry Ball, a two-time Pro Bowl nose
tackle, set the tone on the first of Dickerson's 13 carries, slamming him to
the turf for a 7-yard loss. In the third quarter, Ball tackled Dickerson in
the end zone for a safety.;   The Colts were held to a franchise-low 4 yards
rushing.;   Dickerson, who scored two touchdowns, has rushed for 12,121 yards,
one more than Franco Harris. Dickerson needs 192 yards to pass Jim Brown for
third place.; BILLS 17, BUCCANEERS 10: In Tampa, Fla., Buffalo (4-0) remained
unbeaten by driving 76 yards in the closing minutes to beat Tampa Bay (0-4) on
Jim Kelly's 29-yard touchdown pass to Keith McKeller.;   Tampa Bay tied the
score 10-10 on Steve Christie's 19-yard field goal midway through the fourth
quarter. But the Bucs' defense finally caved in to Kelly and the no-huddle
attack on a six-play march that produced the winning points.;   Time ran out
on the Bucs when Chris Chandler's final pass fell incomplete in the end zone
on first-and-goal from the 8.; EAGLES 23, STEELERS 14: Jim McMahon completed
22 of 31 passes for 286 yards and scored on a quarterback sneak as host
Philadelphia (3-1) rallied to beat Pittsburgh (2-2).;   McMahon, 31, given a
chance to start after a knee injury ended Randall Cunningham's season,
completed six passes for 114 yards to wide receiver Roy Green, 34, who signed
with the Eagles last week as a replacement for injured Calvin Williams.;
BRONCOS 27, CHARGERS 19: Gaston Green bolted 63 and 20 yards for two
fourth-quarter touchdowns, lifting host Denver (3-1) over San Diego (0-4).;  
Green carried 24 times for 127 yards and scored three times -- the first
rushing TDs of his four-year NFL career.; CHIEFS 20, SEAHAWKS 13: Steve DeBerg
threw two touchdown passes and Nick Lowery kicked two field goals as host
Kansas City (2-2) beat mistake-prone Seattle (1-3).;   The Chiefs seemed
comfortably headed toward victory when a pass-interference penalty on Kansas
City's Billy Bell led to Derrick Fenner's 1-yard touchdown run with 1:29 left.
The Seahawks (1-3) then recovered an on-side kick, but Chiefs linebacker Chris
Martin made a juggling interception to seal the victory.; COWBOYS 17,
CARDINALS 9: Emmitt Smith raced to first-quarter touchdowns of 60 and 12
yards, sparking Dallas (2-2) over Phoenix (2-2) in Tempe, Ariz.;   Smith, who
rushed for 182 yards in 23 carries, also turned a short pass from Troy Aikman
into a 37-yard gain late in the fourth quarter, setting up a game-clinching
41-yard field goal by Ken Willis.  </TEXT>
