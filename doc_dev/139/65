<P>
In the darkest moments of this season, one thing that always seemed to shine 
was that Cleveland Gary was and would be the Rams' tailback from here to 
football eternity. 
</P>
<P>
Gary was the man, the workhorse, the next of John Robinson's 1,000-yard 
rushers, and if you doubted that, well, all the Ram coach did was keep giving 
him the ball and all Gary did was break tackles, pile up the numbers and score 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as the Rams' season brightens in the glow of two consecutive victories, 
Gary's individual star suddenly has dimmed, thanks to his recent fumbling 
plague and the emergence of a few other tailbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Gary has fumbled nine times this season and lost five of them -- including lost 
drops in each of the last three weeks, one of which Robinson concedes cost the 
Rams the Dallas game -- and a possible three-game winning streak -- last month. 
After fumbling on the second possession of their 38-23 victory over the 
Cleveland Browns last Sunday, Gary spent most of the rest of the game watching 
backup Gaston Green play effectively. 
</P>
<P>
Monday, at his weekly media luncheon, Robinson did not exactly go out of his 
way to defend Gary, even as he was telling of his joy with his team's upswing 
to 5-7. Robinson even suggested that the newest Ram tailback, Marcus Dupree, 
could start playing more. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams will play the New Orleans Saints (5-7) Sunday in a game that for all 
intents will knock the loser out of the wild-card race, but it is not clear 
exactly who the Rams' main rusher will be. 
</P>
<P>
"They'll both play," Robinson said of Gary, who still retains at least his 
starting status, and Green. "I don't have a real ability in my mind to go into 
a game and say I'm going to play this person this much or the second series. 
</P>
<P>
"I will get Gaston in earlier. As you've seen over the last three, four weeks, 
he's come in a game in the first quarter or early in the second. And I will 
continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
Although Robinson still obviously would like Gary to do most of the work, he 
said that Gary has to learn that consistent fumbling cannot go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
Gary has gained 651 yards in 169 carries this year after missing training camp 
and the first few weeks of the season with a back injury, and Robinson 
emphasizes that the second-year player simply needs to grow as a runner. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson praised Gary's ability to gain yards the hard way, but gaining yards 
doesn't help if the ball is rolling around under defensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just got to hold the ball tighter," Robinson said. "I've never been a 
coach who said, 'Oh, you fumbled. You're out.' That's bull, I think. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think he's going through a period where he has to become responsible in 
terms of the ball. And I'm not saying he's irresponsible. I just think he's 
learning. He's learning that it's important, that we lose the game when he 
fumbles, he comes out of the game when he fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
"We lost a game because he fumbled. You know, he'd be a 1,000-yard rusher right 
now if he'd played the whole season, and if he'd been the ballcarrier (Sunday), 
he'd have had 130, 140 yards." 
</P>
<P>
Green, the Rams' No. 1 pick three seasons ago, gained 57 yards in 13 carries 
Sunday, pushing his season total to 194 yards in 44 carries, a 4.4-yard 
average. Green, who has never been able to establish himself with Robinson, 
seems at least to have caught his eye this time. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson didn't sound as if he is ready to unleash Green, and for now, it 
appears that Green will continue in a subsidiary role. Green's style of running 
is in direct contrast to Gary's rough-and-tumble-for-four-yards method. Green, 
Robinson said, needs holes to run through, and that has never been Robinson's 
style. 
</P>
<P>
"He's not the same kind of elusive person that (Dave Meggett of the New York 
Giants or Eric Metcalf of the Cleveland Browns) are," Robinson said. "He's a 
speed person. Those people are people that you cannot get a hold of, 
theoretically. . . . He's a good player, but I don't think we want to confuse 
him with those kinds of people." 
</P>
<P>
Dupree, the third and most intriguing name in the tailback mix, has shown 
flashes of his old flair after coming back from a five-year-old knee injury.

First, there was the off-season announcement that he was being moved to the 
right side of the defensive alignment to improve the Rams' woeful pass rush. 
Then, there was the heralded holdout which ended on the eve of the 
regular-season opener. A 3-7 start glaringly deemed the grand experiment a 
failure and Kevin Greene was moved back to his right outside linebacker 
position. Greene proved Sunday that he was all the way back to his 1989 form 
when he sacked Cleveland Brown quarterback Bernie Kosar three times to bring 
his season total to 10. With four regular-season games left, it's possible for 
the Auburn product to match the 16- 1/2-sack effort he's recorded the last two 
seasons.
