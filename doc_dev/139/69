<LEADPARA>  New quarterback, same old problems for the Super Bowl champion New York
Giants.;   They got three touchdown passes Sunday from Phil Simms, making his
first start of the season in place of injured Jeff Hostetler. They built a
10-point second-half lead against a Cincinnati Bengals team that had won just
once all season.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But it all came apart in a familiar way. The Giants' offense fizzled, as it
has for most of the season, and the defense and special teams self-destructed
with the game on the line, helping the Bengals rally for a 27-24 victory in
Cincinnati.;   Jim Breech's 35-yard field goal put Cincinnati ahead to stay,
and Mitchell Price returned a punt 78 yards for a clinching touchdown.;   "We
beat ourselves," Giants Coach Ray Handley said.;   "We've been doing that all
year," Simms said. "That's pretty typical of us. We made a lot of mistakes in
all facets of the game. We had a lot of chances.";   Now the Giants (7-6)
might be out of chances for a wild-card berth. Their last three games are
against Philadelphia, Washington and Houston.;   The Bengals (2-11) got back
in the game with a lot of help from a Giants defense missing linebacker
Lawrence Taylor, out with a sprained knee.;   Breech kicked a 35-yard field
goal to cut the lead to 17-10 late in the third quarter. The Giants then
turned the ball over on Mark Ingram's fumble and committed three third-down
penalties to help the Bengals drive 58 yards for a tying touchdown.;   A
roughing-the-passer penalty on Pepper Johnson and two pass-interference
penalties on Everson Walls set up Harold Green's 1-yard run that tied it at 17
early in the fourth quarter.;   Simms then threw three incompletions, and a
banged-up Boomer Esiason led the Bengals to the go-ahead points. Esiason,
playing with a sore passing shoulder and hand, threw a 38-yard pass to Eddie
Brown to get Cincinnati within field-goal range. Walls had another
interference penalty on the drive.;   Breech's second 35-yard kick put
Cincinnati ahead with 7 minutes, 10 seconds left, and the Bengals -- last in
the NFL with just 11 sacks in 12 games -- had consecutive sacks to force
another punt from Sean Landeta. Price took it, weaved through the first line
of tacklers and sprinted to the third-longest punt return for a touchdown in
Bengals history.; REDSKINS 27, RAMS 6: Coming off their only loss of the
season, Washington returned to form, beating Los Angeles in Anaheim to win its
fifth NFC East title in 10 years and first since 1987.;   The Redskins'
division crown also was their fifth under Joe Gibbs, in his 11th season as
their coach. Washington also won Super Bowls in 1982 and 1987.;   The Redskins
(12-1), defeated 24-21 by Dallas the previous week, started slowly against the
Rams (3-10), who have lost seven straight.;   Ahead 7-6 at halftime,
Washington opened the game up with two third-quarter touchdowns.;  
Washington's defense shut down the Rams' running game and also kept
quarterback Jim Everett in check. Everett completed 19 of 40 passes for 201
yards.; BRONCOS 20, PATRIOTS 3: John Elway, shrugging off a sore shoulder,
threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Vance Johnson and kept New England
off-balance with a versatile attack as host Denver drubbed the Patriots.;  
Elway, a doubtful starter because of tendinitis and a bone spur in his
throwing shoulder, came out throwing. He went to the air on six of the
Broncos' first seven plays, and Denver scored on its opening drive.;   New
England (4-9) was throttled by an aggressive Denver defense that sacked Hugh
Millen three times early in the game and held the Pats to 13 total yards on
their first five possessions. By that time, the Broncos led 17-0.; BILLS 24,
JETS 13: Buffalo won its 17th straight home game and its fourth straight AFC
East title with a victory over New York before a sellout crowd of 80,243.;  
Buffalo (11-2) took another step toward ensuring home-field advantage in the
conference playoffs by turning three New York turnovers into 17 points in
dropping the Jets, who still have wild-card hopes, to 7-6.;   Thurman Thomas
finished with 124 yards in 23 carries, and Buffalo's Bruce Smith, the 1990
defensive player of the year, made a successful return from preseason knee
surgery with a sack and four tackles.; DOLPHINS 33, BUCS 14: Mark Higgs
replaced fumble-plagued Sammie Smith and rushed for 131 yards in 25 carries to
lead host Miami past Tampa Bay.;   The Dolphins (7-6) improved their chances
for an AFC wild-card berth and surmounted the .500 mark for the first time
this season. Tampa Bay fell to 2-11.;   The 5-foot-7 Higgs, who started
Miami's first six games when Smith was hurt, regained the job after Smith lost
three fumbles near the opposing goal line in the past five games.; BROWNS 31,
COLTS 0: Host Indianapolis showed no life and Cleveland showed no mercy.;  
The Colts' four turnovers against the NFL's leader in takeaway/giveaway margin
only made the slaughter quicker.;   Kevin Mack caught one touchdown pass and
ran 51 yards for another TD as the Browns routed Indianapolis, scoring after
each of the Colts' turnovers.;   Cleveland (6-7) put the game away with four
touchdowns in the second quarter against the Colts (1-12).  </TEXT>
