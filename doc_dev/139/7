In light of the chaos caused by the Buffalo Bills' unexpected no-huddle offense 
last week, Cleveland Brown Coach Bud Carson spent the week preparing for more 
of the same today from the Denver Broncos in the AFC championship game. 
</P>
<P>
"The Bills found a couple weak spots, and they exploited them. We didn't do a 
very good job adjusting to them," Carson said. "They not only used a hurry-up 
game on us, they used an even more effective hurry-up game in that they weren't 
even audibling at the line of scrimmage. They were getting lined up and running 
plays quickly." 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's Jim Kelly passed for 405 yards and four touchdowns against Cleveland 
and nearly won the game before Clay Matthews intercepted a pass at the goal 
line with three seconds left to preserve the Browns' win. One play earlier, a 
potential touchdown pass glanced off the hands of Ronnie Harmon in the left 
corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo's first touchdown came on a no-huddle play that created confusion among 
Cleveland's defenders. Matthews was feverishly trying to call a timeout as the 
ball was snapped, and Kelly proceeded to hit a wide-open Andre Reed over the 
middle for a 72-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
Though Denver attempted to use a hurry-up offense without much success in a 
16-13 loss to the Browns in Cleveland on Oct. 1, Carson said he'd be surprised 
if the Broncos didn't try of it today. 
</P>
<P>
"We're anticipating 90,000 no-huddles. Our whole practice has been no-huddles," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Browns are seeking their first Super Bowl appearance. The Broncos are after 
their third appearance in four years and fourth overall. They are 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
Denver had a 1,000-yard rusher and a 3,000-yard passer in the same season for 
the first time. Its attack is more balanced than Cleveland's. 
</P>
<P>
John Elway will supplement the passing game with Bobby Humphrey, who rushed for 
1,151 yards as a rookie and scored eight touchdowns. He is effective inside and 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Elway did not have an outstanding season, but he did pass for 3,051 yards and 
18 touchdowns. He also threw 18 interceptions and was the team's third-leading 
rusher with 244 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland's defensive backs excel at going for the ball -- the Browns led the 
AFC with 27 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
The only snow fans at the game are likely to see will be capping the mountains 
in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast for today is mild and breezy, with increasing afternoon clouds and 
high temperatures in the low 50s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's perfect football weather," said weather service meteorologist Joe Baskin. 
</P>
<P>
"It's cool enough for the players to enjoy it, and enough breeze to blow all 
the smoke out of the stands. Just a really nice day." 
</P>
<P>
Baskin said snow could follow on the heels of the game, however, perhaps on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe for the ticker-tape parade," he said.
