<P>
The Rams' 19-13 victory over the Giants should be remembered as a tight, tense 
playoff game that was decided by the Los Angeles quarterback, not an official 
who made a questionable call in overtime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jim Everett clearly won his duel with Phil Simms and, under difficult 
circumstances, emerged as a genuine NFL star. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Everett showed a good arm, toughness, patience and leadership ability on a day 
when the Rams played their third consecutive game in the East and faced a 
vintage Lawrence Taylor. . . . The Rams' immediate goal is to win the Super 
Bowl tournament. Their next should be to re-sign the 27-year-old Everett, who 
will be eligible to file for free agency after the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't exactly as though all the calls went against the Giants. They got the 
benefit of the doubt when Simms seemed to fumble rather than throw an 
incompletion and another time when he wasn't cited for intentionally grounding 
the ball. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What should be second-guessed all winter is Giant Coach Bill Parcells' strategy 
late in the first half when he refused to sit on a 6-0 lead in his own 
territory and the Rams intercepted a pass to set up a touchdown. . . . 
</P>
<P>
CBS billed a game matching teams from Anaheim and East Rutherford, N.J., as 
Hollywood vs. Broadway. . . . 
</P>
<P>
A Ram unsuccessfully tried to scoop up a fumble and run with it rather than 
pounce on it, but what else is new in football?. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Rams should be declared undisputed champions of the NFC East after going 
5-0 against that division the last nine weeks. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Vaccaro, the oddsmaker at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas, has established 
San Francisco as a seven-point favorite over the Rams and Denver as a 
four-point favorite over Cleveland. . . . 
</P>
<P>
This will be the first playoff game ever between the Rams and 49ers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Forget about what John Elway has or hasn't done the rest of any particular 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
He still tends to get the job done at crunch time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Most surprising statistic of the day was that Pittsburgh punted only twice 
against Denver. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jon Kolb, who was a great offensive lineman for the Steelers, is doing a great 
job coaching their offensive line. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Honestly, did the name Merril Hoge mean anything to you before Sunday? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Three and a half hours between kickoffs of playoff games no longer is enough, 
as we discovered Saturday. San Francisco and Minnesota were well under way on 
CBS by the time Cleveland and Buffalo finished on NBC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Teams without an outstanding quarterback, such as Minnesota, rarely make it to 
the conference championship game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana couldn't have played any better in the first half Saturday at 
Candlestick, but, as Terry Bradshaw asked, what was he doing in the game when 
the 49ers were leading, 34-6, in the fourth quarter? . . . 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco placekicker Mike Cofer picked a great time to have an off day. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
The prevent defense of Coach Bud Carson nearly prevented Cleveland from 
reaching the AFC championship game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Once you've seen Bernie Kosar run the option, you've seen everything. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Making coach-of-the-year selections before the most important part of the 
season, the playoffs, is ludicrous. So was AP's choice of Green Bay's Lindy 
Infante, who didn't even make the playoffs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Noll, four-time winner of the Super Bowl, never has been selected coach 
of the year by AP. Vince Lombardi won the honor only once. . . . 
</P>
<P>
I get the impression John Madden doesn't like the running-up-and-leaping 
penalty. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota doesn't have a clue about how to use Herschel Walker. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Is Jerry Glanville still denying those reports that the Houston Oilers aren't 
happy with his work? . . . 
</P>
<P>
Newsday speculates that USC linebacker Junior Seau could be taken as the second 
player in the entire NFL draft by the New York Jets if he leaves school a year 
early. . . . I hope Eric Davis finally feels appreciated in Cincinnati. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The difference between the Kings and Toronto Maple Leafs, who beat them 
Saturday night, isn't much right now. Both score a lot of goals and give up a 
lot of goals. . . . 
</P>
<P>
UCLA was fortunate that most of us were watching the Broncos and Steelers 
instead of the Bruin-Louisville basketball game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
However, for a respite from football, try Georgetown-Pitt, Michigan-Indiana and 
Nevada Las Vegas-New Mexico State in college hoops tonight on ESPN. . . 
</P>
<P>
Did anybody really care what CBS' pregame guest, Richard Nixon, thought about 
the Rams and Giants?
