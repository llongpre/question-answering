LATERALLY SPEAKING, IT WAS CLAY'S PLAY; 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Long-suffering Cleveland Brown fans, who still talk about the Drive and the 
Fumble, infamous plays that knocked their beloved Dawgs out of the Super Bowl, 
have a new topic of conversation this season: the Lateral. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Clay Matthews of the Browns scooped up a fumble and headed for the 
goal line in the fourth quarter of their last regular-season game at Houston. A 
posse of Oilers in pursuit, Matthews tried to lateral -- to, of all people, 
Chris Pike, a lumbering defensive tackle at 6-feet-8 and 290 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The ball never got to Pike. 
</P>
<P>
It sailed over his head. The Oilers recovered and scored on the next play to 
take a 20-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
This time, though, the Browns came back to win, 24-20, as tailback Kevin Mack 
scored with 39 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
That was a saving touchdown for Matthews. If the Browns had lost, they would 
have been eliminated from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"If we'd lost, I would have put Clay on the propeller for the plane ride back 
to Cleveland," Brown Coach Bud Carson said. 
</P>
<P>
Said Matthews' father, Clay Sr.: "I almost died when I saw the lateral, I 
really did. I thought, 'Oh, my gosh, there goes his whole career on one lousy 
play.' 
</P>
<P>
"When they scored and won, I knew he was the most relieved guy in the whole 
stadium." 
</P>
<P>
After the victory over the Oilers, which gave the Browns the AFC Central 
championship, Matthews wore a big smile as he left the Astrodome field. 
</P>
<P>
But he has refused to acknowledge that he almost threw away the 1989 playoffs. 
And he hasn't grasped the idea that he would have been forever remembered in 
Cleveland for the Lateral, despite 12 exceptional seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say I would have gone around the rest of my life feeling that I had 
ruined my career if we'd lost," Matthews said. "But if someone (on the Browns) 
would have caught it and gone in for a touchdown, I can't say that I would have 
gone around thinking that I was the greatest thing since sliced bread." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews considers the lateral to have been a smart play. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unusual play, but for those who have followed my career closely I 
had lateraled five times before that, including twice in one game, and one went 
for a touchdown of 60 yards," Matthews said. "I had one where I intercepted a 
pass and ran for 36 yards and lateraled to Big Daddy Carl Hairston, who ran for 
another 40 and a touchdown against Cincinnati in 1987. That was the most 
talked-about play of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"So, when you're five for five on laterals, it made perfect sense to me to go 
six for six. Obviously, it didn't work out the way I wanted it to. But not 
everything does." 
</P>
<P>
When the Browns returned to practice after the Houston game, Matthews arrived 
wearing a T-shirt with the inscription: "No Brains, No Headache." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have a headache and some people are making the case that I don't have 
any brains," Matthews told Cleveland reporters. "I guess the smart thing to do 
would have been to fall down." 
</P>
<P>
Matthews did that smart thing after intercepting a pass with three seconds 
remaining to preserve the Browns' 34-30 win over the Buffalo Bills last 
weekend. That victory propelled the Browns into the AFC championship game for 
the third time in the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
Had Carson considered that Matthews might lateral after the interception? 
</P>
<P>
"Clay wasn't going to lateral that one," Carson said. "I had a gun on him and 
he wasn't going to get a chance." 
</P>
<P>
And why didn't Matthews try another lateral? 
</P>
<P>
"Because I didn't know where the Buffalo guys were," he said. "If I had caught 
it in an open space, I might have faked a couple of laterals and then fallen 
down just to give everybody a little jazz." 
</P>
<P>
Until that interception, running back Thurman Thomas had been beating Matthews 
all afternoon, having caught catching 13 passes for 150 yards and a touchdown. 
But on the big play, Matthews stepped in front of Thomas and intercepted 
quarterback Jim Kelly's pass for his first postseason interception. 
</P>
<P>
Big plays are nothing new to Matthews, who has made a lot of them since joining 
the Browns. The first linebacker selected in the 1978 NFL draft, Matthews has 
become probably the best linebacker in Browns' history. 
</P>
<P>
An All-American inside linebacker at USC, Matthews was moved to outside 
linebacker in Cleveland. And there he has flourished, averaging 86 tackles a 
season. He also has rung up 51 sacks, third best in club history. 
</P>
<P>
Although Matthews had to adjust to a new defensive system under Carson, who 
switched the Browns from a 3-4 alignment to a 4-3, he had an extraordinary 
season and made the Pro Bowl for the third consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews' freedom as a pass rusher was restricted in Carson's structured 
defensive system. He was moved from the right side, where he was free to rush 
the passer, having only a blocking back to deal with, to the left side of the 
defense, where he lines up over the tight end. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews, who said he thinks sacks are the ultimate for a linebacker, had just 
three of them this season. 
</P>
<P>
"When you've been fortunate to play as long as I have, one of the last areas 
where you can still brainstorm and show some creativity is the pass rush," 
Matthews said. "When you're covering someone (in zone pass coverage) you're 
limited in what you can do. When you play the run it's almost like you see the 
stimulus and react. 
</P>
<P>
"But in pass rush, there are a thousand different ways you can to try to get to 
the quarterback. It's probably the last area of creativity left on the football 
field defensively. "I was disappointed that I wasn't involved in the rush as 
much as I had been in the past, but we don't always get what we want. We've 
been successful this year so onward and upward." 
</P>
<P>
Ozzie Newsome, the Browns' tight end, and Matthews are the senior players with 
the Browns. Although Newsome, 33, has said that this is his final season, 
Matthews still approaches football with youthful zeal. Matthews, 33, has more 
kid in him than most rookies fresh out of college and he admits it. 
</P>
<P>
In the final year of his contract, he cringed at the mention of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll keep playing as long as it's still fun," Matthews said. "One of these 
days when I grow up, I'll have to figure out what I'm going to do for a 
living." 
</P>
<P>
STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND 
</P>
<P>
Although he has spent his entire pro career in Cleveland, Matthews seems as 
misplaced in Cleveland as Howard the Duck, who, in a movie, landed there from 
outer space. Not many Clevelanders, for instance, have taken acting lessons and 
appeared on a platform with President Bush. Matthews received a lot of negative 
mail after he and several teammates had endorsed Bush during the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
"He's just a California flake," said Tony Grossi, a sportswriter who covers the 
Browns for the Cleveland Plain Dealer. "He's so atypical from Clevelanders that 
it's amazing that he's played here for 12 years. He has no conception of what 
'Cleveland blue collar' is all about." 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the season ends, Matthews escapes to his home in Agoura Hills, where 
his idea of a good time is playing basketball on the regulation court in his 
backyard. 
</P>
<P>
He doesn't return to Cleveland until training camp opens, and even though he 
doesn't participate in the Browns' off-season conditioning program, he always 
arrives at camp in top shape. He has lowered his time in the 40-yard dash for 
the last three seasons while adding 20 pounds of muscle. 
</P>
<P>
But Matthews is hardly a slick Hollywood creation who dresses in three-piece 
suits and drives an expensive foreign car. 
</P>
<P>
He owns the same 1973 Mercury Capri that he has driven back and forth from 
California to Cleveland ever since he was drafted. The odometer stopped at 
89,000 miles five years ago. And although he has grown wealthy in the Southern 
California real estate market, he doesn't flaunt his wealth, dressing in 
T-shirts and jeans. Long-time friends say they have never seen him in a suit 
and tie. 
</P>
<P>
Matthews' life revolves around his family, which includes five children, 
Jennifer, 8; Kyle, 7; Brian, 4; Clay, 3, and Casey, 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
ALL IN THE FAMILY 
</P>
<P>
William Clay Matthews Jr. might have been born to play in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
His father, also Clay, played offensive tackle, tight end and linebacker for 
the San Francisco 49ers in 1950 and from 1953-55. His younger brother, Bruce, 
is an offensive tackle for the Houston Oilers. Clay and Bruce will play 
together in the Pro Bowl for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
But the elder Matthews didn't push his sons into football. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't try to take out any of my frustrations or lack of success on them," 
he said. "I made a deal with them. I told them, 'If you ask me something, I'll 
be glad to help you, but if you don't ask, I'll assume you know what you're 
doing.' 
</P>
<P>
"They both asked for help in the same way, and it really surprised me. It had 
nothing to do with technique. Both of them were high school All-Americans and 
pretty highly publicized. 
</P>
<P>
"And strangely enough, both of them came to me and said, 'I'd like to go to 
USC, do you think I can play there?' And I told them, 'If you're going to be 
the best, you might as well play with the best; and if you think that USC is 
the best that there is, why don't you go find out?' " 
</P>
<P>
Clay and Bruce became All-Americans at USC. After graduating from USC in 1983, 
Bruce was selected in the first round by the Oilers. The Matthews brothers have 
played against one another twice a year since. 
</P>
<P>
Whom does their father root for when the Oilers play the Browns? 
</P>
<P>
"I answer that question every year," Matthews said. "When a reporter from 
Houston called me this year I said, 'Aren't you tired of writing the same story 
seven years in a row?' And he said, 'No, people forget about it from one year 
to the next.' 
</P>
<P>
"So I'm going to give you the same answer I gave him. I really don't know who 
I'm pulling for when they play. I can rationalize it in my mind and say that 
I'm pulling for Clay because he's in his 12th year and Bruce is only in his 
seventh year and I want Clay to go to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"But what really happens is that as the game goes on, I pull for whoever gets 
behind. I once did an interview in the Astrodome and I said that I was the only 
person in the Dome who can't lose." Although the senior Matthews is proud of 
sons Clay and Bruce, he's even prouder of his two other sons, twins Bradley and 
Raymond, 30. 
</P>
<P>
Although retarded, Bradley and Raymond held jobs and maintained their own 
apartments. Both excelled in the Special Olympics. Bradley was the state 
swimming champion at 25 meters, and Raymond was the state champion at 50 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
"If they hadn't been retarded, we'd have four Matthews in the NFL," Clay said 
of his brothers.
