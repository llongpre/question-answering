<LEADPARA>  The phrase "starting quarterback Steve Bono" creates the temptation to write
the 49ers' season off.;   After all, how many third-string quarterbacks have
been able to keep their team in contention? Everyone has witnessed the demise
of the Philadelphia Eagles this season. They were 3-1 under backup Jim McMahon
but fell to 3-4 when forced to dip down to the next level with Pat Ryan, Brad
Goebel and Jeff Kemp.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But there is some history on the 49ers' side. It hasn't been done often,
but at least a couple of NFL teams have reached the playoffs with a
third-string quarterback or worse. Cleveland did it in 1988 with Don Strock,
and the Baltimore Colts made it in 1965 with Tom Matte, who was converted from
running back in an emergency.;   The last time the 49ers started their
third-string quarterback was in New Orleans, in 1986. Joe Montana was out
after back surgery, backup Kemp was injured and the team was left with Mike
Moroski. The 49ers lost that game, the last time they have lost in the
Superdome.;   But, this week, the team is professing confidence in Bono.;   "I
feel good about him, and I think we can win with him," Coach George Seifert
said.;   Seifert can take heart from the Cleveland case. It has many
similarities to the 49ers' struggles this season. The Browns seemed snake bit
at quarterback, even though they entered the season confident in the strength
of the position.;   "We had never been stronger," said Ernie Accorsi, the
Browns' executive vice president of football operations. "We had three
quarterbacks with tremendous experience.";   The Browns, who had made it to
the AFC championship game in the 1986 and 1987 seasons, usually carried only
two quarterbacks, but Accorsi said the team felt it needed the depth to make
it to the Super Bowl.;   The Browns soon found they needed it just to survive.
Starter Bernie Kosar suffered an elbow injury in the season opener, leaving
veteran backup Gary Danielson in charge. In the next game, Danielson was lost
for the season because of a broken ankle.;   That left only Mike Pagel at
quarterback, so the Browns signed Strock, a 14-year veteran who had been
waived by Miami after the 1987 season, at age 37.;   "He had a great suntan
and a little pot belly," Accorsi said. "He had an attitude like, 'What the
hell do I have to lose?' It was exactly the attitude you want under
pressure.";   And Strock was soon under pressure. Pagel suffered a separated
shoulder in the fifth game, and Strock came on to lead the team to a victory
over the Eagles in the game.;   Kosar returned the following week and started
the next eight games. But in Week 15, in a Monday night game against Miami,
Kosar suffered a strained knee ligament. With the Browns 9-5 and hoping for a
wild-card berth, Strock passed for two fourth-quarter touchdowns to tie the
score, but Cleveland eventually lost. Strock led the Browns to victory and the
playoffs in the final game of the season against Houston.;   Cincinnati was
winning the division but kept looking over its shoulder. Bengals assistant
general manager Mike Brown told Accorsi: "Three times, we said that's the end
of them. But it wasn't.";   Strock started the wild-card game against Houston
but injured his hand recovering his own fumble and Pagel came in, the sixth
quarterback change of the season. Cleveland lost that game but was lucky to
even have been there.;   "It was amazing the way the team responded," Accorsi
said.;   Ditto for the Colts in 1965. Late in the season, Johnny Unitas
suffered a knee injury. The next week backup Gary Cuozzo injured his shoulder,
leaving Matte, a halfback, as the emergency replacement.;   After a weeklong
quarterback cram course, Matte started the final regular-season game against
the Los Angeles Rams, wearing the plays taped to his left wristband. He led
the Colts to a 20-17 victory.;   In the Western Conference playoffs, Matte was
the quarterback, but the Colts lost to Green Bay 13-10 in overtime.;   Matte's
play-covered wristband is on display at the Pro Football Hall of Fame.  </TEXT>
