<P>
If you were from Struthers, just outside Youngstown, Ohio, you didn't take to 
the folks from neighboring Boardman. 
</P>
<P>
"We're talking the Hatfields and the McCoys here," said Jim Fox, a Boardman 
High School teacher. "The kids from Struthers always had something to prove to 
the rich kids from Boardman." 
</P>
<P>
"Boardman had a better band, better shopping malls, better everything than 
Struthers," said Chuck Perazich, sports editor of the Youngstown Vindicator. 
"Except for sports -- when it came to sports, you never knew who was going to 
win. 
</P>
<P>
"In sports it was the cake-eaters from Boardman, against the blue-collar tough 
guys from Struthers. Bitter rivals," Perazich said. "That's why I imagine 
(Chargers' defensive coordinator) Ronnie Lynn has got to have a funny feeling 
about this game. I got to believe he's going to try a little harder. After all, 
he's from Struthers." 
</P>
<P>
And Bernie Kosar is from Boardman. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar also is the starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns (1-1), and 
today in front of a sellout crowd of 80,000 he will match brawn and wits with 
Lynn's not-so-neighborly Charger defense. 
</P>
<P>
"I've known the guy for a long time," Lynn said. "His high school adviser (Fox) 
was my college roommate. I even tried to recruit Bernie to play at Cal." 
</P>
<P>
Kosar went on to prosper for the University of Miami, but today Lynn will be 
coming after him again. And he won't be alone. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie knows he's going to get the good pass rush, maybe the great pass rush," 
Cleveland coach Bud Carson said. "Maybe the best in the AFC." 
</P>
<P>
This cannot be good news for Kosar. In two games, he has been sacked 10 times; 
on 10 other occasions, he has released the ball and then has been decked. Four 
of his passes have been deflected by pass rushers. 
</P>
<P>
He wears an elastic wrap around a painted black plastic cup used to protect the 
elbow on his throwing arm, Maybe he should be padded from head to foot. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely a tough guy," linebacker Gary Plummer said. "As much as he's 
been knocked around in the last two weeks to still be standing -- you got to 
admire the guy." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, however, do not come to Cleveland Stadium to praise Kosar. They 
come "to bury him," as defensive tackle Lee Williams pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the target," Williams said. "We know where he's going to be, and we're 
coming after him. Full throttle." 
</P>
<P>
Protected by an offensive line that doesn't make the Chargers' offensive line 
look so bad anymore, Kosar has struggled to be effective, and as a result, 
Cleveland's offense ranks 26th in the NFL. The Browns feature four new starters 
up front, and to hear the folks in Cleveland, they'd be just as happy to go to 
war with the four old starters. 
</P>
<P>
It took the Browns seven quarters of play to record their first offensive 
touchdown this season. They now have two. Their longest run from scrimmage has 
been 16 yards by Kevin Mack, who is now sidelined with a broken finger; their 
longest pass play is 27 yards, to Reggie Langhorne. 
</P>
<P>
"They've had their problems, and they may do some things to keep extra 
protectors in there for Bernie," Lynn said. "But we're going to rush him. 
</P>
<P>
"Bernie's a courageous guy. But he may throw some away, and if you get hit a 
number of times, I don't care how tough you are, you start to hurt and flinch. 
I can see some of that happening if we do what we're capable of doing." 
</P>
<P>
Now if the Browns are capable of doing what they do best, then nobody scores, 
and these two teams go into overtime for the third time in their last five 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Chargers, the Browns try to construct a victory via defense. Their 
head coach is a former defensive coordinator, who was the architect of 
Pittsburgh's "Steel Curtain." Their big-play linebacker, Clay Matthews, has 
been to five Pro Bowls. Their top pass rusher, Michael Dean Perry, leads the 
AFC in sacks, with four. 
</P>
<P>
In two games, they have yet to surrender a second-half touchdown, and as the 
Chargers are often reminded, they have yet to score in either the third or 
fourth quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"I know. I know," quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver said. "I'm sure they've got to 
feel pretty good about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"But we're looking to change that. Not necessarily to score in the fourth 
quarter, but to score if we need to score. That's our goal." 
</P>
<P>
Bring on Fuad Reveiz. 
</P>
<P>
"Where's the blindfold?" said the Charger kicker, whose job is on the line. 
"Coach (Dan) Henning hasn't made it easy for me putting me on the spot like 
this, but it's something that is part of the business." 
</P>
<P>
Reveiz, one-for-three in field-goal attempts, has been informed that future 
employment with the Chargers rests solely on how he does today. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be panicking after two games," Reveiz said. "You've got a lot of the 
season to go, and you can't be looking after two games and think it's the end 
of the world." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but an 0-3 start would be the first for the Chargers since going 
0-11 in 1975. It would also put an end to all those high-flying expectations 
that greeted a fifth-place schedule and Bobby Beathard's arrival. 
</P>
<P>
The last time, however, the Chargers sought victory in the Browns' ramshackle 
backyard, they were waylaid, 47-17. 
</P>
<P>
"We got no allies there," Lynn said. "We're gonna be warming up in front of the 
'Dawg Pound' (the dog bone-tossing section of Browns fans), and they'll be 
throwing things at us and calling us everything but free men. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an avid fan, a rabid fan. This is important to the people in Cleveland. 
These are the guys who come out of the mills wearing hard hats who just don't 
take them off Friday till Sunday. They live for their football. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean I got a ticket for my college roommate," Lynn said, "and he's rooting 
for Bernie."
