<LEADPARA>  TOM LANDRY says it should be Phil Simms. John Madden said he's leaning to
Simms. Now we just wait for Coach Ray Handley's decision.;    Never before has
one team had two quarterbacks who have won a Super Bowl. And that's why the
New York Giants' Simms-Jeff Hostetler controversy has become a compelling
story around the country.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Under my philosophy, I would go back to the veteran quarterback," said
Landry, the former Dallas Cowboys coach. "Because he was hurt, the other
quarterback had a chance to go in and pick up the slack. Whether they would
have won the Super Bowl without making that change, I don't know. Sometimes
that motivates the other players to know they have to be greater than before
to win with the backup quarterback who hadn't thrown many passes.;    "It's a
tough decision, but if the veteran is performing at a high level in training
camp, I would have to go with him. If he falters, the young quarterback, who's
not too young anymore, he would have to step in.";    Madden, the former
Oakland Raiders coach, said he thinks Handley will pick Simms, and if he were
coaching he would "be leaning to Simms.";    "I've always been impressed with
Phil Simms," he said.;    Landry and Madden said they thought Hostetler would
be better coming off the bench than Simms.;  STILL A SIEVE: Too many times
last year, the Cincinnati Bengals saw their front seven on defense manhandled
by stronger opponents. So the emphasis in the draft was to upgrade this
weakness. It hasn't happened.;    First-round pick Alfred Williams of Colorado
remains a holdout, but he already has had an impact on the team -- negatively.
To make room for him outside, the Bengals moved their top pass-rusher, James
Francis, to inside linebacker, but the early returns have not been positive.; 
  In the second and third rounds, the Bengals picked ends Lamar Rogers of
Auburn and Bob Dahl of Notre Dame. Neither played well in a 24-20 loss to
Detroit in which the Lions rushed for 221 yards in 43 carries -- a 5.1 average
-- without Barry Sanders.;    "We were awful," Bengals Coach Sam Wyche said.
"You could have had a Shriners' parade through some of those holes. Lamar
looked like he was getting whipped.";  A NEED TO NETWORK: Minnesota Vikings
wide receiver Cris Carter had some insightful commentary on the problems
former teammate Randall Cunningham has with his Philadelphia Eagles
teammates.;    "Randall became such a big star. I feel sorry for him,
actually, because he's one of the most talented people I've ever been around.
But it's so hard for him being a black quarterback and being in that city. I
think it's going to be hard to deal with because they built him up so much,
but no one's going to be there for him but his true friends at the end of his
career. I hope at that time he hasn't isolated himself so far away from his
team that they're not able to help him.";  AROUND THE NFC: Running
back/outfielder D.J. Dozier, who is playing at Triple-A Tidewater and hopes to
be called up by the New York Mets in September, was rumored to be headed to
the 49ers, which General Manager John McVay denied. But don't bet on Dozier's
staying with the Minnesota Vikings, who made him their No. 1 pick in 1987.
Minnesota wants a No. 3 pick for him. New Orleans is interested. . . . The
Cowboys claim that wide receiver Alex Wright has been timed in 4.09 seconds
for the 40-yard dash. He was electronically timed in 4.29, and two-tenths of a
second are deducted from that because a hand-held timer is more accurate.
Wright is the fastest player in the NFL, and he's becoming a pretty good
receiver. The Cowboys now have some targets for Troy Aikman with Wright,
Michael Irvin and rookie Alvin Harper. And Kelvin Martin, who had 64 catches a
year ago, is now the No. 4 receiver. . . . Barring something unlikely, such as
a winning record, Tampa Bay should remain the league's most anonymous team.
This will be the eighth consecutive season that the Bucs do not appear on
"Monday Night Football," the league's longest streak.;  AROUND THE AFC: After
going 11 for 15 for New England against Green Bay, Plan B pickup Hugh Millen
has taken the lead over Tommy Hodson in the Patriots' battle for No. 1
quarterback. . .  Billy Joe Tolliver is now solid as the Chargers' No. 1
quarterback after beginning and ending the '90 season on the bench and
starting the rest of the year. He lost his job to Mark Vlasic out of camp last
year and was benched in the final game of the season for rookie John Friesz.
San Diego Coach Dan Henning's job security is linked directly to Tolliver's
success.;  SAY IT AIN'T SO, 'THE TOE': Hall of Famer Lou Groza, 67, was in the
Cleveland Browns' Mentor, Ohio, camp last week and decided to try a field
goal. The ball never got 3 feet off the ground. "It's been 20 years since I
tried to kick a ball," he said. "I got a new left hip put in 12 years ago, so
I was skeptical.";  END QUOTE: It was March 1987 and the Boston Globe's Will
McDonough was sitting near the ocean in Maui with Paul Brown, who died
Monday.;    "What was it like in Massillon?" McDonough wondered, asking Brown
to hark to his youthful coaching days in Ohio.;    "Happiest time of my life,"
Brown said, pausing for a few more seconds. "See, I loved to teach. That's
what I wanted to do. I wanted to try to hold those kids . . . have some kind
of effect on their life."  </TEXT>
