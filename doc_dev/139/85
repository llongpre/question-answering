<TEXT>     The Browns scheduled a news conference for later today regarding the
coaching job.;    Team officials declined to comment on the Monday meeting.
"We will have no comment on our head coaching search," said a team spokesman,
Kevin Byrne.;    Belichick, in the days following the Giants' Super Bowl win,
interviewed last week for head coaching vacancies in Cleveland and Tampa Bay.
The Tampa Bay vacancy was filled Monday with the hiring of Richard Williamson,
who had served as interim coach.;    The Cleveland Plain Dealer reported today
that "barring a last-second hitch in negotiations" Belichick would be named to
coach the Browns today or Wednesday.;    Belichick has been in the league 16
years. If hired, he would be the youngest coach in the NFL. At present,
youngest is the Los Angeles Raiders' Art Shell, 44.;  DITKA COMING BACK: Coach
Mike Ditka and the Bears have reached agreement on a three-year contract
extension, the Chicago Tribune said today.;    "He did it last week," Ditka's
wife, Diana, told the newspaper. "We're going to be here for a while.";    The
team planned to make a formal announcement today, the newspaper said.;   
Ditka, 51, became coach Jan. 20, 1982. He led the Bears to a Super Bowl
victory in January 1986. He was named coach of the year following the 1988
campaign, the year in which he suffered a midseason heart attack, and the
Bears had a 12-4 record.;    There was talk after last year that Ditka would
leave Chicago, but the team bounced back in 1990, and Ditka coached the Bears
to their sixth NFC Central Division championship in the last seven years.;   
The team finished 11-5 in the regular season and lost 31-3 to the New York
Giants in the second round of playoffs Jan. 13.;  BUDDY UPDATE: Buddy Ryan's
options are dwindling. The recently fired Philadelphia Eagles coach denied he
talked to Minnesota's Jerry Burns about the defensive coordinator position
with the Vikings vacated by the firing of Floyd Peters. The Minnesota job is
the only defensive coordinator position open.;    Ryan, Peters and the Rams'
Fritz Shurmur, three of the most successful defensive coaches of the 1980s,
all find themselves out of work at the moment. The World League of American
Football, the NFL's international spring venture, kicks off March 23. There is
only one coaching vacancy, in New York. Former Colts offensive coordinator
Larry Kennan was named head coach of the London team on Monday.;  ETC.: The
Minnesota Vikings named Monte Kiffin as defensive coordinator. . . . The NFL
released the names of 29 underclassmen who are eligible for the draft, a list
that includes Curvin Richards, the No. 2 rusher in Pitt history, and prospect
Eric Swann, who never made it to college. Swann, a 6-foot-4, 300-pound
defensive lineman, played last year for the Bay State Titans in football's
minor leagues. Swann, 20, once was set to play for North Carolina State but
was ineligible under Proposition 48 after he failed nine times to score the
necessary 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.  </TEXT>
