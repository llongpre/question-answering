Denver (5-1) at Seattle (3-3), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks will try to bring Denver back to the pack in the AFC West, and 
history gives Chuck Knox's squad a good chance. Seattle has won four of the 
last five games in the series, 21-14 and 42-14 last season, and the Broncos 
haven't won at the Kingdome since 1985. Bronco quarterback John Elway continues 
to struggle but has Mike Shanahan, late of the Raiders, back to help him figure 
things out. The Seahawks are 30-11 in the Kingdome in the last five seasons but 
are 0-2 this season. Seattle has not lost three straight at home since 1980.

INTERCONFERENCE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
New England (2-4) at San Francisco (5-1), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana's passing arm is better and he's expected to be back at 
quarterback. Steve Young led the 49ers past Dallas last week. The Patriots are 
going with 36-year-old Steve Grogan at quarterback, since Doug Flutie struggled 
last week for the second consecutive game. San Francisco is undefeated on the 
road and lost its only home game to the Rams, but this game has been moved to 
Stanford Stadium because of earthquake damage at Candlestick Park. The 49ers 
have won only four of their last nine games at home, where they will play five 
of the next six. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas (0-6) at Kansas City (2-4), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback Steve Walsh, the rookie out of Miami, gave the Cowboys reason to 
hope last week against San Francisco, but the yards are harder to come by 
against the Chiefs' outstanding secondary. However, with running back Darryl 
Clack replacing Herschel Walker, who was traded to Minnesota, the Dallas ground 
game was nonexistent. The Chiefs aren't fancy, relying on the running of 
Christian Okoye and a sound defense. The Cowboys' worst start was 0-10 in 1960, 
their first season, when they finished 0-11-1. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay (3-3) at Miami (3-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the way Miami played earlier this season, the Dolphins' turnaround 
is probably a combination of another superb coaching job by Don Shula and the 
greatness of quarterback Dan Marino. Just when it seemed this might be Shula's 
worst team, the Dolphins beat Cleveland and Cincinnati. Miami also has its best 
defender, linebacker John Offerdahl, back after a long holdout. Quarterback Don 
Majkowski and the Green Bay offense were slowed by Minnesota last week, but 
still rank No. 2 in the NFL. Miami beat the Packers last season, 24-17.

AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis (3-3) at Cincinnati (4-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts, their three-game winning streak snapped by Denver, need to have Eric 
Dickerson completely recovered from his hamstring injury or get Albert Bentley 
more involved to take the pressure off quarterback Jack Trudeau. If Chip Banks, 
the newly acquired linebacker, is in shape, he could be a big help to the Colt 
defense. Cincinnati hasn't been overpowering, barely getting past Cleveland, 
Kansas City and Pittsburgh. Despite the running of James Brooks, the Bengals 
aren't nearly as explosive as they were last season. 
</P>
<P>
New York Jets (1-5) at Buffalo (4-2), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills are hoping that Frank Reich is for real after beating the Rams Monday 
night, because Jim Kelly won't be back for a while. The Jets can't seem to 
decide on a quarterback, going with Kyle Mackey and Ken O'Brien in last week's 
loss to New Orleans. It hasn't helped that receivers Al Toon and Wesley Walker 
are out. Buffalo swept the Jets last season, 37-14 and 9-6 in overtime, but 
five of the last six games between these old AFL rivals have been decided by 
four points or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh (3-3) at Houston (3-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Houston may have finally gotten itself together when quarterback Warren Moon 
directed two touchdown drives in the final minutes last week at Chicago and the 
Oilers intercepted four passes. The Steelers have won three of four but didn't 
have much offense last week with quarterback Todd Blackledge replacing injured 
Bubby Brister. Houston has won three of the last four games with Pittsburgh, 
including a split last season, but Pittsburgh is 5-2 at the Astrodome since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay (3-3) at Washington (3-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Buccaneers learned last week that they can't win without Vinny Testaverde, 
who is expected to start today, and that Joe Ferguson is too old for this game. 
The Redskins lead the NFL in total offense on the running of Gerald Riggs and 
the passing of Mark Rypien, but it wasn't enough to save their three-game 
winning streak last week against the Giants. Washington's three defeats have 
been by a total of 11 points, including two three-pointers against the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (4-2) at Detroit (1-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Herschel Walker played against Green Bay two consecutive weeks, gaining 44 
yards for Dallas and 148 after his trade to Minnesota. Detroit has found that a 
healthy Rodney Peete makes a big difference in Mouse Davis' Silver Stretch 
offense. He passed for 268 yards and ran for 78 in a victory over Tampa Bay. 
Minnesota has won six in a row from the Lions, including a 24-17 victory two 
weeks ago, and five consecutive games in Michigan, but has lost four road games 
in a row dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta (2-4) at Phoenix (2-4), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals were down to their third-string quarterback, Tom Tupa, when Gary 
Hogeboom missed last week's loss to Philadelphia with an elbow injury. Tupa had 
six passes intercepted and was sacked six times. Quarterback Chris Miller 
carries the Falcons and has had only two passes intercepted all season. Atlanta 
rookie Deion Sanders leads the NFC in punt returns, had a 60-yard kickoff 
return last week and is making himself at home in the secondary. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
Chicago (4-2) at Cleveland (3-3) 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 7, 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have uncharacteristically lost two in a row, the Bears allowing 75 
points and the Browns scoring only 17. Bernie Kosar had his worst game as a pro 
last week against Pittsburgh and, surprisingly, there were cries in Cleveland 
for Mike Pagel. Chicago, which has never lost three straight with Mike Ditka as 
coach, also has had problems at quarterback lately, but Mike Tomczak -- despite 
four interceptions against Houston -- remains the starter ahead of Jim 
Harbaugh. Injuries to the defense -- Dan Hampton, Jim Morrissey -- have been 
the biggest problem.
