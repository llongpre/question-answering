<TEXT>     Funeral services will be held Wednesday in Massillon, Ohio, the city where
he coached Massillon Washington High School's football team to six state
championships from 1932 to 1940.;    Brown is survived by his wife, Mary, and
two sons, Mike and Pete. Mike Brown is the Bengals' assistant general manager,
and Pete Brown is the team's director of player personnel.;    Brown, who
suffered from emphysema, served as the Bengals' general manager until his
death. He was active at league meetings and was a member of the powerful
Competition Committee.;    Brown made a request that the Bengals not change
their routine, including practices and season preparation, after his death,
Bengals Coach Sam Wyche said. The Bengals have no immediate plans to wear a
remembrance of Brown on their uniforms.;    "One of his final requests was
that absolutely nothing be disturbed, that everything would be done as usual
-- 'business as usual,' as he put it," Wyche said. "I will honor his request,
and that'll be that nothing will be changed. That's because that's the way he
wanted it."  </TEXT>
