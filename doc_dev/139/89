</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a few minutes Monday, the Denver Broncos and John Elway weren't on their 
usual perch a mile above the rest of the teams in the American Conference. 
</P>
<P>
The fourth-quarter sight of 260-pound Kansas City Chiefs fullback Christian 
Okoye barreling over 185-pound Broncos cornerback Tyrone Braxton brought out 
animal instincts from the Chiefs. They smelled blood from a wounded champion. 
Linebacker Chris Martin stepped onto the field and pointed his finger into the 
faces of Broncos. Taunts filled the September mountain air. The AFC kings were 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm tired of you guys winning," is what Broncos receiver Mark Jackson said he 
overheard the Chiefs shouting at his teammates. When you win three AFC titles 
in four years and lose three Super Bowl games, you expect criticism. When 
you're John Elway, you expect worse. 
</P>
<P>
So there was Elway Monday night, facing fourth down and the season. The Chiefs 
led, 23-21, thanks to an improbable 83-yard touchdown by Stephone Paige, a 
possession receiver who would lose to a linebacker in a match race. It was 
fourth-and-10 at the Broncos' 17 with just more than one minute left. Elway had 
thrown 10 consecutive incompletions. 
</P>
<P>
One more errant toss and Elway's chances of returning to the Super Bowl this 
season were dim. The Broncos would have been 0-2 and no team has ever won the 
AFC West with such a bad start. The Chiefs were excited. Joe Montana is known 
as the Comeback Kid. Elway is known as the quarterback Super Bowl viewers hope 
will never come back. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess the toughest thing for me is the fact that I've lost every one 
individually," Elway said. "When you talk about Denver's losses you talk about 
John Elway losing the Super Bowl. That is probably the most difficult thing." 
</P>
<P>
But the Super Bowl isn't until January, so watch out. Elway burned the Chiefs 
with a 49-yard fourth-down bullet to Vance Johnson, and a minute later, the 
Chiefs were 24-23 victims. He may not be Mr. January, but the guy is sure 
deadly during the fall. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the key is, 'What if we hadn't done it,"' Elway said. "If we lose that 
game, it would have turned our world upside down. We would be 0-2 and we lose a 
game on the homefield to the Chiefs." 
</P>
<P>
Elway's back. In some ways, he's better than ever. Monday night's fourth-down 
miracle illustrates why Elway keeps going to Super Bowls. At least twice a 
year, he turns sure losses into improbable victories. That two-game swing is 
the reason the Broncos finish 11-5 instead of 9-7 and, in two of three cases, 
it's the reason they secured homefield advantage for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
As AFC teams all know, the teams with the homefield advantage usually go the 
Super Bowl. That is unless you force Elway to drive 98 yards in Cleveland 
Stadium in the final minutes of an AFC Championship game. 
</P>
<P>
His big play Monday, The Throw, they're calling it in Denver, marked the 17th 
time in Elway's eight seasons he's brought the team from behind in the fourth 
quarter with his $2 million a year right arm. Blame the Super Bowl losses on 
Elway, if you wish. But the Broncos know he's their ticket to the game. 
</P>
<P>
It's funny how Elway's ability to come back has become so commonplace. Jackson, 
for example, rooted for Paige to go the entire 83 yards for the touchdown so 
that the Broncos could get the ball back with 1:44 and three timeouts left. 
</P>
<P>
"(Tackle) Gerald Perry had the quote of the day," Jackson said. "He said, 
'Let's just do it.' When your offensive linemen have that kind of confidence, 
that's good. Usually, they are worried about not getting beat by a defender." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, 1990 is a comeback year for Elway. Losing a third Super Bowl hit 
him hard. He sneaked away to a new home in Palm Springs during the off-season 
and got away from the Denver fans and press, who, he claimed, suffocated him 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
Reaching the age of 30 was another eye opener for Elway. Suddenly, a touch of 
football mortality reached him. Four years remain on his six-year, $12.7 
million contract, but before camp, Elway started dropping hints he isn't 
certain he'll finish the pact. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, he must wait until January to try to erase the Super Bowl stigma 
tagged to him. 
</P>
<P>
"It still stings," Elway said. "It's a dark cloud that's hanging over us." 
</P>
<P>
Elway reported to camp slimmer and mentally fresher and had a great training 
camp. Then came the season-opener against the Los Angeles Raiders. He wilted 
from heat exhaustion in 100-plus degree heat as the Broncos suffered a 14-9 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how much he tried to hide it, Elway, who completed only 14-of-31 
passes, ached emotionally through the week that followed. 
</P>
<P>
"Beside the Super Bowl, that's probably the most disappointed I've been in a 
long time," he said. "I took a lot of criticism. I didn't play well, so I can't 
say I didn't deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet those thoughts didn't cross his mind on that fourth-and-10 against Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
"You're in a situation where you have nothing to win," Elway said. "A lot of 
guys think it's more pressure, but there really is not. To me there is far less 
pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Montana says plays seem to slow down during crucial situations. He should know. 
His 24 fourth-quarter come-from-behind victories with the San Francisco 49ers 
top even retired Dallas Cowboys Roger Staubach, who had 23 fourth-quarter 
come-from-behind victories, including 14 in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that things slow down, but they seem to be more clear," Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
What is clear is that Elway's ability to spark a comeback with one-play puts 
him in the class with Staubach, Montana and Ken Stabler. 
</P>
<P>
"I think John and Roger are very similar," said Broncos Coach Dan Reeves, who 
played with Staubach and coaches Elway. "Both of them had that tremendous arm 
and the ability to scramble and make things happen. I think both teams have 
reacted to both quarterbacks the same way. They never really feel they are out 
of a ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Except in Super Bowls, where their average loss is by 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
"One Super Bowl win will get rid of that," Elway said. "You just can't come to 
grips with, 'hey, if you lose the Super Bowl, you are not the second-best team 
in the league, you're the 28th-best team."' 
</P>
