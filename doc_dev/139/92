BACKUPS EARNING THEIR DUE IN NFL

The other football players refer to him as "The Guy," and you can hear the 
capital "T" and the capital "G" when they speak. 
</P>
<P>
As in, "The Guy who is going to get it done for us. The Guy we can count on to 
get us into the end zone. The Guy who is going to get us to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
Montana, Marino, Majik, Everett, Elway. These are The Guys. 
</P>
<P>
But behind these great quarterbacks are "The Other Guys." 
</P>
<P>
The backups. 
</P>
<P>
They may be wizened veterans or marginal talents or heirs apparent. You might 
catch a glimpse of them during a timeout, eavesdropping on a sideline 
conversation between The Guy and The Coach. They are easy to spot with their 
baseball caps, their clean uniforms and their clipboards. 
</P>
<P>
You won't hear much about them unless disaster strikes. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are the second-most important position on the team," Cleveland 
Browns' Vice President Ernie Accorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
"You need a franchise quarterback to compete in this league," Accorsi said. 
"But the other guy can take you out of contention faster than any other player 
on the field if he can't at least hold his own." 
</P>
<P>
Babe Laufenberg, who has been a backup for six years with the Washington 
Redskins, San Diego Chargers, New Orleans Saints and now the Dallas Cowboys, 
likes to be referred to as a "journeyman." 
</P>
<P>
"The dictionary defines that as someone competent but unspectacular," 
Laufenberg said. "People think of it as a derogatory term, but it is not. We 
are guys who won't go in and lose a game for you." 
</P>
<P>
Untapped competence, if not unexposed excellence, is only one of the traits a 
backup quarterback must have. He must also have his ego firmly in check. 
</P>
<P>
"My dad asked me once if I could get him an autographed football," said Gary 
Kubiak, backup to John Elway with the Denver Broncos. "And he asked me 
especially if I could get John's signature on it. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Dad ...' " 
</P>
<P>
Only six quarterbacks among the league's 28 teams started all 16 games last 
season. This season is only four weeks old, and already starters are falling: 
Washington's Mark Rypien, the Minnesota Vikings' Wade Wilson, the Indianapolis 
Colts' Jeff George, the New England Patriots' Steve Grogan and the Detroit 
Lions' Rodney Peete. 
</P>
<P>
And it is clear from their price tags that the National Football League places 
a premium on the quarterbacks who must hold it together until The Guy returns. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the ways you keep them happy," said Accorsi, who pays Mike Pagel 
$550,000 a year to be ready in case something happens to Bernie Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
"He is worth every penny to us," Accorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
Pagel earned his keep in 1988 when he was 4-2 as a starter for the injured 
Kosar and Cleveland made it to the playoffs as a wild-card team. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Reich performed as well for the Buffalo Bills last year and was rewarded 
in May with a five-year deal worth $600,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
The former Maryland quarterback was nearly cut in training camp, but he came 
off the bench for an injured Jim Kelly in a nationally televised game against 
the Los Angeles Rams in Week 6 and moved the team down the field to score the 
winning touchdown with less than a minute to play. 
</P>
<P>
Reich led the Bills to victories over the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins 
the next two weeks, and his team, too, made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
That three-game stretch earned Reich more than a pay hike. 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing it did for me was give me a little respect among my peers, which 
is important," Reich said. "As a quarterback, you need that respect when you 
step out on the field. And those three games gave me that." 
</P>
<P>
Money will not always keep a backup quarterback happy. After all, most of them 
were The Guy during their college careers. It is not easy to stand and chart 
plays when once you called them. 
</P>
<P>
"Pagel started 40 games for the Colts," Accorsi said. "He's still young and 
he's antsy." 
</P>
<P>
Reich is, too. "A little bit," he said. "Especially after having some success 
... it gives you that hunger to get back in there -- just because it is so much 
fun playing." 
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult to keep everybody happy," said George Young, vice president of 
the New York Giants. He pays Jeff Hostetler $450,000 to back up 35-year-old 
Phil Simms. Hostetler is 29. He might not have much time left for his career if 
Simms doesn't retire soon. 
</P>
<P>
"The age thing has to be just right," Young said. "You either have to have a 
veteran behind a young guy or a real young heir apparent who knows he's going 
to get his chance some day. Real close together in age and you have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Consider Tony Eason. The seven-year veteran forfeited a week's pay -- $68,000 
-- rather than report to the Jets, who had picked him up on waivers, because he 
did not want to compete against his contemporary, and best friend, Ken O'Brien. 
O'Brien eventually persuaded him to report. 
</P>
<P>
A similar age problem between two younger players was resolved in Dallas last 
month when the Cowboys traded Steve Walsh, on the bench behind Troy Aikman, to 
New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Add resolution, and a good grip on reality, to the list of qualities that you 
look for in your backup. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, Bubby's The Guy," the Pittsburgh Steelers' Rick Strom said. "And I know 
that." 
</P>
<P>
Brister has failed to produce a touchdown in four games using the offense 
designed by new coordinator Joe Walton. Strom took over for Brister late in 
last week's 28-6 loss to Miami. After taking a sack, Strom completed a 22-yard 
pass for a first down. 
</P>
<P>
He went on to complete four straight passes and move the Steelers to the 
Dolphins' 1-yard line with a minute left. A penalty, a sack and two 
incompletions ended the drive. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how well he had done in what are clearly desperate times for the 
Steelers, he does not expect Coach Chuck Noll to replace Brister with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pulling for the team to come out of this," Strom said. "I can't be 
concerned with whether I am playing or not. I have one job here. If Bubby goes 
down, I have to come in and take over so we don't miss a beat. You can't be 
prepared to do that if you spend your time on the sideline pouting." 
</P>
<P>
Kubiak, Elway's best friend and roommate since both joined the Broncos eight 
years ago, knows his role, too. 
</P>
<P>
Elway is perhaps the most durable quarterback in the NFL over the past five 
years, starting 85 of the past 87 games. Kubiak gets few turns at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"No. 1, I am not The Guy, and I won't be as long as John is around," Kubiak 
said. "When you are in that position, you have to be very self-motivated, very 
disciplined. You are not going to get the physical preparation, so you have to 
make up for it with mental preparation." 
</P>
<P>
Said a member of the Broncos front office: "Kubiak is the perfect backup. He is 
not a threat or a challenge (the way Walsh was to Aikman). He is never going to 
say, 'Play me or trade me.' Over a 16-game season, his weaknesses would be 
exposed. But to come in for a game or two, he is perfect." 
</P>
<P>
The role of the backup quarterback in the history of the NFL is not ignominious 
or anonymous. Earl Morrall replaced John Unitas and led the Baltimore Colts to 
a 13-1 record in the 1968 season. Morrall held the starting job until Unitas 
came off the bench in the third quarter of the Colts' loss to the Jets in Super 
Bowl III. 
</P>
<P>
Again in 1972, during the Dolphins' 17-0 Super Bowl season, Morrall replaced an 
injured Bob Griese during Week 5. Griese did not return until he came off the 
bench to rally the Dolphins past Pittsburgh for the American Football 
Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
And Mike Kruczek was 6-0 in place of Terry Bradshaw, helping the Steelers make 
the playoffs in 1976. But no backup quarterback ever has been the winning 
quarterback in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
And whether they are like Mike Tomczak of the Bears or Eason of the Jets or the 
Green Bay Packers' Anthony Dilweg, who knew he would be benched as soon as Don 
Majkowski ended his holdout ("They aren't paying him $1.5 million to sit on the 
bench," Dilweg said), each wonders what it would be like to be The Guy.
