(1-1).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Tupa, who was 6 of 19 for 218 yards, connected on a 51-yard touchdown pass
to Johnny Johnson in the first quarter that boosted Phoenix's lead to 10-0. He
also helped set up four field goals by Greg Davis.;   The Eagles' Jim McMahon,
replacing injured Randall Cunningham, completed 19 of 34 passes for 173 yards.
Tupa, starting in place of injured Timm Rosenbach, averaged 36.3 yards per
completion, and McMahon averaged only 8.8 yards.;   "Tom was great," Cardinals
Coach Joe Bugel said. "He didn't take any chances. He did a good job using the
clock, was a good manager on the field. He's a winner.";   Rosenbach and
Cunningham, who started 62 consecutive games before missing Sunday's game
because a knee injury, are out for the season.;   McMahon, who led the Eagles
to a victory over Green Bay last week after Cunningham went down on the first
play of the second quarter, suffered an inglorious finish against the
Cardinals with 2 minutes, 48 seconds left. He fumbled on a sack, and the ball
was recovered by Rod Saddler, who ran 7 yards for a touchdown.; SAINTS 17,
CHIEFS 10: Bobby Hebert threw two first-half touchdown passes as New Orleans
took a 17-0 first-half lead, then held off host Kansas City (1-1).;   The
Saints are off to their first 2-0 start in the 25-year history of the
franchise.;   New Orleans controlled the ball for most of the first half and
limited the Chiefs to one first down.;   Kansas City dominated the second
half, holding the Saints to two first downs, but interceptions by Reggie Jones
and Sam Mills foiled the Chiefs' comeback.; OILERS 30, BENGALS 7: Houston
(2-0) scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns just over a minute apart to clinch
a victory in Cincinnati (0-2).;   Warren Moon drove the Oilers 90 yards for a
touchdown, hitting Haywood Jeffires in stride for a 22-yard touchdown and a
20-7 lead. Moon completed 6 of 7 passes for all 90 yards in the drive.;  
Sixty-one seconds later, Lamar Lathon returned a deflected pass 52 yards for a
touchdown.;   The Bengals have scored just 21 points in losing their first two
games for the first time since 1985, when they finished 7-9.; LIONS 23,
PACKERS 14: Rodney Peete attempted a career-high 38 passes, completing 25 for
271 yards, and Robert Clark had 10 catches for a career-high 143 yards as
Detroit (1-1) defeated Green Bay (0-2) in Pontiac, Mich.;   Barry Sanders, who
missed the Lions' opener because of a rib injury, gained 42 yards in 18
carries and scored Detroit's first touchdown.; BEARS 21, BUCCANEERS 20: In
Tampa, Fla., Jim Harbaugh threw two touchdown passes and Chicago (2-0) sacked
Vinny Testaverde six times in continuing its mastery of NFC Central Division
rival Tampa Bay (0-2).;   The Bears, who are 21-2 during September over the
past seven years, won for the 15th time in their past 17 meetings with Tampa
Bay.; BROWNS 20, PATRIOTS 0: In Foxboro, Mass., Cleveland (1-1) won the battle
of last season's worst NFL teams as Bernie Kosar's two touchdown passes helped
beat New England (1-1).;   At one point, the Patriots ran 29 consecutive plays
without a first down, from late in the first quarter to early in the fourth.; 
 Cleveland had its first shutout in 32 games and provided Coach Bill Belichick
with his first victory as an NFL head coach. Dick MacPherson, the Patriots'
rookie coach, got his first loss.;   Cleveland was 3-13 last season. Only New
England's 1-15 record was worse.; DOLPHINS 17, COLTS 6: A week after being
shredded for 582 yards in a season-opening 35-31 loss to Buffalo, host Miami
(1-1) limited Indianapolis (0-2) to 150 yards.;   Miami's Mark Higgs, subbing
for injured Sammie Smith, rushed for 111 yards in 27 carries. It was his
second 100-yard rushing game in a row, the first time that has been done by a
Dolphin since Andra Franklin in 1982. Higgs has more yards in two games (257)
than in his first three NFL seasons (251).;   The victory was the 299th of
Coach Don Shula's NFL career. Only the late George Halas won more games --
325.; SEAHAWKS 20, JETS 13: Jeff Kemp, starting his first game in three
seasons, passed for two touchdowns in the third quarter as host Seattle (1-1)
beat New York (1-1).;   Dave Krieg's understudy, who didn't throw a pass in
1989 or 1990, passed 12 yards to tight end Travis McNeal and 15 yards to Tommy
Kane to give the Seahawks a 20-3 lead after three quarters. Kemp was called on
to start after Krieg broke his right thumb in Seattle's opener in New Orleans.
Krieg will be out for five to seven weeks.;   The Seahawks' defense limited
the Jets to two field goals until Troy Taylor hit Rob Moore with a 6-yard
scoring pass with 1:14 to go.  </TEXT>
