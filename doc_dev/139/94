Quarterback Bernie Kosar has agreed to a six-year extension of his contract, 
the Cleveland Browns said today. 
</P>
<P>
Terms of the deal were not disclosed. Other NFL quarterbacks of similar status 
include John Elway and Warren Moon, who have contracts worth more than $2 
million a season. Rookie Troy Aikman of UCLA signed with the Dallas Cowboys for 
about $11.6 million over six years. 
</P>
<P>
The new deal means that Kosar will be with the Browns for seven more seasons, 
because he has one year remaining on the five-year contract worth more than $5 
million he signed as a rookie out of the University of Miami in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Kosar, 25, guided the Browns to the American Football Conference championship 
games in the 1986 and 1987 seasons.
