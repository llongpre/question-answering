GAME OF THE DAY 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis (4-5) at Buffalo (6-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Reich played well in Jim Kelly's absence, but Kelly returned to the 
Buffalo lineup and rallied the Bills three times last week at Atlanta before 
coming up short. Eric Dickerson, out with a hamstring injury in last week's 
loss to Miami, is expected back. Tom Ramsey will replace Colt quarterback Jack 
Trudeau, who has a broken finger on his left hand. The Colts trounced the 
Bills, 37-14, five weeks ago, and the teams split their series last season. 
</P>
<P>
INTERCONFERENCE GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Chicago (5-4) at Pittsburgh (4-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Bears have lost four of five. The offense has been a primary culprit, 
scoring only 40 points in three games, with neither Mike Tomczak nor Jim 
Harbaugh able to make the big plays at quarterback. The Steelers will have to 
keep Richard Dent off Bubby Brister, who hasn't had a pass intercepted in his 
last 179 attempts. The Bears haven't won at Pittsburgh since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans (4-5) at New England (3-6), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
The surging Saints were beaten by San Francisco Monday night, ending a 
three-game winning streak, but New Orleans has the No. 1 defense and has moved 
the ball with Bobby Hebert and Dalton Hilliard. The Patriots have lost twice 
recently on last-minute field goals. Former Raider Marc Wilson replaced injured 
Steve Grogan last week and could become the Patriots' fourth starting 
quarterback this season. 
</P>
<P>
AFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Denver (7-2) at Kansas City (4-5), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 4. 
</P>
<P>
By mortal standards, John Elway is struggling, but he's done enough positive 
things to keep the Broncos winning. Denver has beaten the Chiefs in seven of 
their last nine games, but Kansas City's two victories came at Arrowhead 
Stadium. Kansas City has regained respect by giving the ball to Christian Okoye 
and playing tough defense. The Broncos beat the Chiefs in the season opener, 
34-20, and the teams split two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
Cleveland (6-3) at Seattle (4-5), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks, AFC West champions last season, are fighting to stay in the 
playoff race. Usually strong at home, the Seahawks are 1-3 at Seattle this 
season. The Browns, one game ahead of Cincinnati and Houston in the AFC 
Central, are getting enough running from Eric Metcalf to make it easier on 
Bernie Kosar. The Seahawks have been unable to run consistently, and 
quarterback Dave Krieg has felt the pressure. He was sacked five times and 
fumbled six times last week. Seattle beat the Browns, 16-10, last season at 
Cleveland. The Seahawks lead the series, 8-2, but both Brown wins have come in 
the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
Miami (5-4) at New York Jets (2-7), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Rookie Sammie Smith has given the Dolphins the running game they need to take 
the pressure off quarterback Dan Marino. Last week's victory at Indianapolis 
put Miami one game behind AFC East-leading Buffalo. Ken O'Brien and the New 
York offense came alive last week as the Jets beat New England. The Jets have 
beaten the Dolphins in four of their last five games, including a 40-33 victory 
seven weeks ago, and swept the two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
NFC GAMES 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay (5-4) at Detroit (1-8), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
This is another big step in the Packer resurgence because Green Bay is 0-3 on 
the road. It could be an offensive show with Detroit rookies Rodney Peete and 
Barry Sanders against the Packers' Don Majkowski, who leads the NFL in passing 
with 2,602 yards and 18 touchdowns. Green Bay beat the Lions, 23-20, in 
overtime two weeks ago and has won three of the last four games at the 
Silverdome. The Lions swept the two games last season. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota (6-3) at Tampa Bay (3-6), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
In his return as starting quarterback, Wade Wilson couldn't get the Vikings a 
touchdown but got them close enough for Rich Karlis to kick seven field goals 
in a victory over the Rams. Vinny Testaverde, who had four more passes 
intercepted last week, has led Tampa Bay to big numbers, but the defense has 
given up even bigger numbers in four consecutive defeats. Minnesota beat the 
Buccaneers, 17-3, six weeks ago and has beaten Tampa Bay in nine of the last 10 
games, including a two-game sweep last season. 
</P>
<P>
Washington (4-5) at Philadelphia (6-3), 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Two teams coming off real downers. The Eagles had a four-game winning streak 
end with a 20-17 setback at San Diego. Washington became Dallas' first victim, 
13-3. Doug Williams will remain at quarterback for the Redskins despite the 
rust he showed in his first game of the season, but he has three starters 
missing from his offensive line. The Redskins have lost to the Eagles only four 
times since 1981, but Philadelphia rallied from a 20-0 deficit for a 42-37 
victory in the second game this season. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas (1-8) at Phoenix (4-5), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Palmer has sparked the Cowboys recently; he had 110 rushing yards in 
Dallas' victory a week ago. Troy Aikman will start in place of struggling Steve 
Walsh at quarterback for the Cowboys. Cardinal quarterback Gary Hogeboom is 
having his troubles, reportedly because of an arthritic elbow in his throwing 
arm. He has lost J.T. Smith, the NFL's leading receiver with 62 catches, with a 
broken leg. The Cardinals beat the Cowboys, 19-10, two weeks ago and can sweep 
the series for the first time since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta (3-6) at San Francisco (8-1), 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana showed no ill-effects from a three-week layoff in leading the 49ers 
past New Orleans, but he has Jerry Rice, Roger Craig and friends to work with. 
Atlanta's Chris Miller is one of the league's better quarterbacks, but doesn't 
have nearly the supporting cast. Miller hasn't had a pass intercepted in six 
games. The Falcons have beaten the 49ers once in their last 10 meetings, last 
season at Candlestick Park. The Falcons are 0-5 on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
MONDAY NIGHT 
</P>
<P>
Cincinnati (5-4) at Houston (5-4) 
</P>
<P>
TV: Channel 7, 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The extra day off may give Boomer Esiason's bruised lung time to heal. 
Otherwise, Bengal quarterback Erik Wilhelm, a rookie, will make his first NFL 
start. Cincinnati, already without Ickey Woods for the season, also had backs 
James Brooks and Eric Ball injured last week against the Raiders. Warren Moon 
of the Oilers has passed for 2,255 yards and 14 touchdowns. Houston has beaten 
the Bengals four consecutive times in the Astrodome.
