   Four's Boston, named after the number worn by hockey legend Bobby Orr and cluttered with Boston Bruins, Celtics and Red Sox memorabilia, is a quintessential Beantown bar. 

   Except for three hours a week, when it becomes a quintessential Cleveland bar. 

   On Sunday afternoons, the bar features live broadcasts of Cleveland Browns football games, via satellite dish. 
Amid chipped hockey sticks, scuffed baseballs, and 250 photos of the likes of Mr. Orr, Larry Bird and Carl Yastrzemski, some 300 transplanted Clevelanders come to watch their home team. 

   The weekly transformation was the brainstorm of Mark Guarino, a graduate student from Cleveland. 
Last summer, he visited about 200 bars in or near Boston asking if any would show Browns games. 
"All but three of them laughed in my face," he says. 

   Robert Maloney, the manager of Four's, agreed to the proposal, even though his tavern is across the street from the Boston Garden, home of the Celtics and Bruins. 
The move apparently paid off -- the bar's Sunday afternoon business has more than doubled. 

   Not all of the bar's customers like the idea, however. 
The notion of permitting "a bunch of rooters to hail for Cleveland in a city of coxswains and curators is as jarring as putting a white shirt on a chimney sweep," says Jonathan Scollander, a Bostonian and occasional patron of Four's -- but not on Sunday afternoons. 

   "How in the world can anybody root for Cleveland?" he says, sitting in a nearby bar watching the New England Patriots one recent Sunday. 

   Easy. 
"Cleveland is the epitome of the common man," says displaced Clevelander James Macove, with one eye on the TV at Four's. 
"People say Cleveland mass produces blue collars, has a river so greasy it caught on fire, elected a (board of education) member who mooned someone, and defaulted on its municipal bonds," the advertising executive continues. 
"But Cleveland is for values, clean, Midwestern, down-to-earth values, and I'm not ashamed to say I'm from Cleveland." 

   "It's not fair," says Gregory Price, another expatriate. 
"Even Detroit makes fun of Cleveland." 

   Four's frequenter Ann Farren also is a Browns backer, though she's from the Boston area. 
"I kind of have to like the Cleveland Browns," she says. 
"My son, Paul, is an offensive lineman for the team."
