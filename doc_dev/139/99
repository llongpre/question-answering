   Basketball coach Rick Boyages of Bates
College hears cheers from the home fans now instead of the boos he
heard as point guard at Bowdoin, Bates' long-time rival.
   Boyages took over as head coach at Bates in 1988 at the youthful
age of 25. The Bates home games at Alumni Gymnasium are hard on
visitors, Boyages said. The wooden stands are right on top of the
court and he added: ``There is no place to hide.''

   Lloyd Winston, basketball coach at Emory, is not
sure New York is a nice place to visit, even for a basketball game.
   ``When we played NYU,'' Winston said, ``our players were all
goo-goo eyed about being in New York. There were security guards
frisking everybody at the doors. The locker room was a sweat box
and the fans never stopped screaming at us.''

   NEW YORK (AP ) _ The New York Jets finished fast in 1988 and
coach Joe Walton thinks the momentum of that late surge will carry
over to the 1989 campaign.
   The Jets won three of their last four games in '88 and their
final two, both victories, knocked the Indianapolis Colts and New
York Giants out of the playoffs.
   ``We did learn a lot in those final games last year,'' Walton
said. ``I told the players it should stand us in good stead for the
new season.''

   Ralph Hawkins, the new defensive coordinator of
the New York Jets, believes that setting up a pro football defense
is something like pitching in the major leagues.
   Hawkins has taken over for Bud Carson, who moved to the
Cleveland Browns as head coach. Hawkins came cross-country from
Seattle, where he had been an assistant to Chuck Knox.
   ``I think a good defense has to present different looks,''
Hawkins said. ``It's like a pitcher in baseball, if you keep
throwing a fast ball, eventually they'll hit it hard. You need
changeups in baseball and also in planning your defenses in the
NFL.''

   When asked about tough arenas to play
basketball games in away from home, Rick Barnes of Providence was
quick to answer: ``Kentucky's Rupp Arena.''
   ``It holds 23,000 fans and they seemed to be involved even
before the tipoff,'' Barnes said. ``They booed every call by the
officials, whether it was for or against the home team. Over a
40-minute game, it has to take a toll on the officials.''

   The Los Angeles Lakers were on the road
recently but they still enjoyed home cooking when they played a
game in Charlotte.
   Laker star James Worthy grew up in nearby Gastonia and his
mother, Gladys, cooked a virtual feast for the Laker players the
day before the game.
   The Lakers enjoyed huge platters of fried chicken, stuffing,
gravy, collard greens and venison. For dessert they had pies and
pound cake.

   After watching Mark Price, the star point guard
of the Cleveland Cavaliers, play against his team, Coach Jerry
Reynolds of Sacramento said Price should be a candidate for league
MVP honors.
   But he quickly added Mark won't get it.
   ``Little guys almost never get it,'' Reynolds commented. ``But I
think he's as deserving as anybody. He's so quick you need to hit
him on the head with something to stop him. He also is an excellent
of offensive player.''

   It was Ladies' Day almost every day
at the Charles Town racetrack meeting which ended March 31.

28-year-old Maryland native, was one of the big winners. Not too
far behind was Lori Youngs, a 21-year-old from Texas. Also close in
number of victories was Lillian Kuykendall, a 26-year-old native of
