   Moslem fundamentalists around the
world demand that Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' be
banned as blasphemy against Islam, and this weekend the campaign
turned violent.
   At least five people were killed and more than 80 injured Sunday
when police fired on a mob trying to storm the U.S. Information
Center in Islamabad. The protesters demanded the book be banned in
the United States.
   Fundamentalists say the book does not recognize Islam as the one
true religion and ridicules the most precious Moslem beliefs.
Pakistan and other Moslem nations banned the book after its
publication last year.
   Rushdie, 41, was born in India to Moslem parents and educated in
Britain, where he lives. His other books include ``Midnight's
Children,'' which won Britain's prestigious Booker prize, ``Shame''
and ``The Jaguar Smile.''
   The literary success of ``The Satanic Verses,'' a complex work
that focuses on good and evil, has been confined to a fairly small
intellectual readership in Western nations. In November, the book
won the ``new novel'' category in the annual literary competition
sponsored by the Whitbread brewing giant, but it did not win the
overall Whitbread prize.
   Leaders of the Islamabad march said it was intended to be
peaceful but police reacted improperly.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the protest apparently was inspired by reviews last week in
international news magazines. One official said: ``The reviews had
the first details anyone had about the book. Nobody here has read
the book.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is a rambling fantasy on the birth of
religion, modern history and human relations. It begins with two men
tumbling skyward from a jumbo jet destroyed by a terrorist bomb and
chronicles their adventures.
   A part of the novel fictionalizes certain episodes from the
Koran, the Moslem holy book, and the life of the prophet Mohammed in
what Western book critics say is clearly satire. They have praised
the book for imaginative vision and depth.
   The author says his book is a work of fiction that does not
attack Islam, contains no blasphemy and is not intended to offend
anyone.
   ``It is not a source of satisfaction to me to be banned in the
Moslem world,'' he said in a recent interview with the Herald, a
Pakistani magazine.
   Moslem leaders describe the novel as an attack on Mohammed
intended to insult Moslems and lead them astray.
   Syed Mohammed Younus Kazmi, a Pakistani Moslem leader, said:
``The book has fictitious characters that carricature the holy
prophet and his companions. The book contains insulting and
derogratory remarks.''
   Kazmi and other Islamic theologians say the book must be banned
because it does not treat Mohammed as the prophet of the world's one
true religion. They believe Mohammed and the Koran must be portrayed
only as representing divine truth.
   ``Rushdie has offended millions of Moslems around the world,''
Kazmi said in an interview. ``Such a person cannot be allowed to do
these things.''
   Fundamentalist leaders claimed Sunday's march was not an
anti-American protest, even though many of their followers see the
United States as a corrupt secular culture and enemy of Islam.
Protesters chanted ``American dogs'' and other slogans against the
United States.
   ``It was not an attack on the United States. We just hoped to
create moral support for our cause to stop this unholy book being
printed again,'' Kazmi said.
   Leaflets circulated by fundamentalist groups characterize the
novel as a blasphemous, semi-pornographic attack that says the
prophet was inspired by the devil, his wife was a prostitute and his
companions were evil.
   ``There are insulting remarks in this book,'' said Mohammed
Sadiq, a theology student. ``There are lies in this book. We want
this book banned in America and around the world.''
   According to the author, his novel has been distorted by
fundamentalists who have not read it and oppose any idea that does
not reflect their fanatical literal faith. He said he has received
death threats.
   Rushdie has declared himself fascinated by religion and its
development and role in history.
   He has been quoted as saying religions are ``codes with which
human beings have tried to understand their presence on the planet
and discuss their moral behavior. My point of view is that of a
secular human being. I do not believe in supernatural entities,
whether Christian, Jewish, Moslem or Hindu.''
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and other government leaders called
the protest at the American center an attack by fundamentalist
parties trying to drive her from office by straining relations with
Pakistan's ally, the United States.
   Rushdie says he has every right to deal with Islam in a creative
fashion, and ``I am not going to run away from the subject because
it is my subject and it is my birthright and nobody can take that
away from me.''
