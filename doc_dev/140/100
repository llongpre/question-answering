<HEAD>Bookshop Manager Believes Anti-Rushdie Campaign Behind Fire</HEAD>

   Police on Monday investigated two bookstore fires
that stirred speculation they were set by Moslems angered by Salman
Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   The fires were spotted minutes apart at Dillon's and Collet's
bookstores in central London Sunday night. The Fire Brigade said it
suspected arson in both cases.
   Collet's managing director, Eva Skelley, said she believed the
fire was the work of Islamic fundamentalists. She said the shop
received threats for selling copies of ``The Satanic Verses,''
which many Moslems regard as blasphemous.
   The author has been in hiding hiding since Feb. 14, when Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered his execution. Iranian
officials offered a reward of more than $5 million for the writer's
death.
   Rushdie, born in India of Moslem parents, now is a British
citizen.
   The book includes a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the
names of the prophet Mohammed's wives, and it suggests Mohammed
wrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.
   Tehran television, monitored in Cyprus, said President Kim Il
Sung of communist North Korea on Monday backed Khomeini's death
sentence. It quoted Kim as saying, ``Publication of this book is
the work of the Great Satan and the racists, and we agree that the
writer of this book should be executed.''
   The Great Satan is Iran's catchword for the United States.
   The television said Kim's remarks came at a meeting with Iran's
visiting deputy foreign minister, Javad Mansouri.
   Ms. Skelley said on British Broadcasting Corp. television
Monday, ``Most booksellers who have been selling Salman Rushdie's
books have been threatened with some kind of action and we were one
of those.''
   London Fire Brigade said the two fires appeared identical in
cause. A spokeswoman, unidentified in keeping with British
practice, said it appeared something flammable was pushed through
the shops' letterboxes and ignited. Fire damage was limited to
doorways, though Collet's suffered considerable smoke damage, she
said.
