Mohammed is his last prophet.
   ``2. To declare that I do not agree with any statement in my
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' uttered by any of the characters who
insults the prophet Mohammed, or casts aspersions upon Islam, or
upon the authenticity of the holy Koran, or who rejects the
divinity of Allah.
   ``3. I undertake not to publish the paperback edition of ``The
Satanic Verses'' or to permit any further agreement for
translations into other languages while any risk of further offense
exists.

in the world, as I have always attempted to do in the past.''
