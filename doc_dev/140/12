<HEAD>Rushdie Publisher to Issue Book That Answers `Satanic Verses'</HEAD>

   An Islamic scholar has written a book he
says will refute ``The Satanic Verses,'' the novel that sent author
Salman Rushdie into hiding to escape death at the hands of enraged
Moslems.
   The new book is scheduled for release next April by Penguin,
which also published the Rushdie novel in 1988, setting off
worldwide protests, riots, diplomatic standoffs and debates on
freedom of expression.
   The Bombay-born Rushdie, now a naturalized British citizen, has
been in hiding since Feb. 14, 1989, when Iran's late leader, the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, ordered Moslems to execute Rushdie for
blasphemy.
   Rafiq Zakaria, a Bombay Moslem whose 70,000-word manuscript has
been accepted by the London-based Penguin publishing company, said
his book is to expose the ``baselessness of whatever Rushdie
attributed to the prophet'' Mohammed.
   He described his book, ``Muhammad and the Quran,'' as ``a case
for Islam.''
   ``I believe that the evidence is so overwhelmingly against what
Rushdie has written that the best answer is to convict him
intellectually and not physically,'' Zakaria said.
   Moslems worldwide objected to Rushdie using the names of
Mohammed's wives for prostitutes in his novel and the implication
that the prophet wrote the Koran _ Islam's holy book _ instead of
receiving it from God.
   A week after Khomeini's death edict, Bombay became the
flashpoint of anti-Rushdie protests that spread to other Indian
cities. In the following days, at least 19 people died in riots and
clashes with police in India and neighboring Pakistan.
   India, Pakistan, Iran and several other countries banned ``The
Satanic Verses.'' Later, Iran severed diplomatic ties with Britain,
accusing the British government of supporting Rushdie.
   ``I have traced the campaign of calumny against Islam right from
the birth of the prophet and culminating in Rushdie's book,'' said
Zakaria.
   A senior editor of Penguin Books Ltd. in London said a paperback
edition of ``Muhammad and the Quran'' will be published by April.
   The editor said, however, the book was not planned as a reaction
to ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``It is an incredibly impressive study of the thinking of Islam
looking at Western prejudices,'' she said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Zakaria, a 64-year-old academician and author of seven previous
books, described his latest effort as ``maybe a reaction to the
vituperative attacks and innuendos by Rushdie and his
predecessors.''
   ``I have tried to show how most of it is based on deep-rooted
prejudice first between Moslems and Jews and then between Moslems
and Christians,'' he said.
   The author attributed the ``unfortunately'' large sales of
Rushdie's book to Khomeini's death threat but said he neither
condemned the order nor upheld it because, ``by doing so I take a
pontifical position.''
   Nobody can take a pontifical position in Islam because the
religion does not recognize priesthood and teaches that there is no
intermediary between man and God, he said.
