   The furor over Salman Rushdie's novel ``The

Moslem minorities. Here is a report from an English city with a
large Moslem community.

   Bradford's Moslems invited Eric Pickles,
leader of the city council, to a public burning of ``The Satanic
Verses'' and were surprised when he refused.
   The incident illustrates the gap Salman Rushdie's novel opened
between Western Europe and its minority Moslems _ between men like
Sher Azam, spiritual leader of Bradford's 60,000 Moslems, and
Pickles, the Anglo-Saxon businessman to whom he extended the
invitation.
   Azam, born in Pakistan 48 years ago, was equally offended by
British outrage at the book-burning.
   ``We were left with even more hurt and frustration,'' he said.
``The publicity we got was that Moslems are doing something not in
line with British culture and tradition.''
   Pickles, 36, said: ``They were genuinely surprised I wouldn't go.
That burning book brought back all kinds of images of repression, in
particular Nazi Germany in the '30s. ... It's an obscene act.''
   The protest Jan. 14 in this north England city of 500,000 people
was widely publicized in Moslem countries. Some analysts believe it
began the international crisis in which Iranian spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Rushdie killed, driving the
author him into hiding.
   Outraged Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting he wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it directly
from Allah.
   Like most Bradford Moslems of his generation, Azam arrived from
Pakistan in the 1950s to work in a textile mill. He now heads a
chain of Moslem-run supermarkets and is president of the Council of
Mosques, the Bradford Islamic organization.
   From book burning in Bradford to pro-Khomeini demonstrations in
Paris, the uproar over ``The Satanic Verses'' has increased the
alienation of Western Europe's 5 million Moslems.
   Officials in Ravenna, Italy, ordered increased security around a
monument to Dante Alighieri on Sunday after a group threatened to
blow it up because the medieval poet's famed ``Divine Comedy''
places the prophet Mohammed in hell.
   The main Moslem communities are Turkish immigrants in West
Germany, who have made no significant protest about Rushdie's book;
North Africans in France; and Pakistanis and Indians in Britain.
   Firebombs have been thrown at two mosques in Britain and there
are fears of a religious and racial backlash against Moslems.
   Bradford's Council of Mosques is on the edge of the Asian quarter
and has been under discreet police guard since intruders broke in
last month and left a message: ``Leave Rushdie Alone.''
   Most government and intellectual comment has focused on Rushdie's
right of free speech, but the affair has racial undertones and has
revived calls for stricter curbs on Third World immigration.
   ``It is becoming disturbingly clear that immigrants, anyhow from
Islamic countries, are going to constitute the biggest concentration
of religious fanaticism ... this country has experienced for many
centuries,'' Peregrine Worsthorne, editor of the conservative Sunday
Telegraph, wrote in a signed editorial.
   Jean-Marie Le Pen, president of the extreme-right National Front
in France, said the controversy reflects ``exactly what I am afraid
of for France and Europe, namely the invasion of Europe by Moslem
immigrants.''
   Conservatives like Worsthorne say British liberals are reaping
the harvest of their multicultural doctrines, which hold that ethnic
minorities should be free to preserve their cultures rather than
blending into the society.
   Commentator Auberon Waugh pointed to the irony of Rushdie
enjoying the protection of a government he has likened to a police
state and the police he has denounced as racist.
   ``He should pay for any police protection he may judge
advisable,'' Waugh wrote in the conservative weekly Spectator.
   Rushdie was born in Bombay, India, of Moslem parents but now is a
British citizen. ``The Satanic Verses'' was published in Britain
last fall.
   Liberal intellectuals, among whom Rushdie is prominent, have
united with Margaret Thatcher, the Conservative prime minister who
ordinarily is their favorite hate figure, in defense of free speech.
   The opposition Labor Party also joined it, but notes that Mrs.
Thatcher's record includes banning broadcast interviews with members
of the outlawed Irish Republican Army and spending millions on law
suits to suppress ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of a retired
intelligence agent.
   ``They (the government) are total hypocrites,'' Labor foreign
affairs spokesman Gerald Kaufman said in an interview. ``They've
spent the last several years suppressing freedom of speech in every
way they can.''
   Labor also has been accused by some of its own supporters of
pulling its punches for fear of losing Moslem votes.
   Many British Moslems consider speeches by Cabinet ministers about
democratic values and civilized behavior insensitive at best and at
worst intolerant.
   ``Those who wish to make their home in Britain, to contribute to
our society and to prosper within it, cannot deny to others the very
freedoms which drew them to this country,'' Education Secretary
Kenneth Baker said at a political meeting in Bradford.
   Liaqat Hussain, one of Azam's deputies, responded: ``They are
turning the attention of the British public against the Moslem
people.''
   Former Mayor Mohammed Ajeeb, the first non-white to run a British
city, said: ``A form of racism manifests itself in times of tension
and that's what is happening now,''
   In one view, the Rushdie affair is a power struggle between
fundamentalists and secularized Moslems. Some Islamic religious
leaders have supported Khomeini's death call and none has publicly
rejected it.
   Moderate Moslems are embarrassed and fear association with a
fundamentalist image that equates in many West European minds with
hostage-taking, airline bombings and keeping women in veils.
   Pickles said of the situation in Bradford: ``We've done all right
so far over this ... but if something happens to Mr. Rushdie, then
we could be in trouble.''
