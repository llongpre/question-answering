<HEAD>Rushdie Says He Wants Reconciliation With Islam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Salman Rushdie says he is optimistic that he can
work out a reconciliation with Moslems, but an Iranian leader says
the death sentence against the Indian-born author of ``The Satanic
Verses'' can never be lifted.
   ``I have to hope that the atmosphere is gradually changing. I
think there's various signs that it might be,'' Rushdie told CBS
News correspondent Mike Wallace in an interview for Sunday's
edition of ``60 Minutes.''
   In a separate interview, Rajei-Khorrasani, a powerful leader in
Iran's parliament, said the death sentence cannot be lifted
``because it is a religious fact, which remains there forever.''
   Rushdie, 43, a Bombay-born British subject, has been in hiding
under police guard since Feb. 14, 1989, when Iran's spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, declared his novel an affront
to Islam and ordered Moslems to kill him. Khomeini died June 3,
1989.
   Iranian clerics offered a $5.2-million bounty for Rushdie's
assassination.
   Among parts of the ``The Satanic Verses'' many Moslems find
offensive are a scene in which prostitutes are given the names of
the prophet Mohammed's wives, and implications that Mohammed wrote
the Koran, the Moslem holy book.
   Rushdie said he never meant to insult the Moslem world.
   ``If I'm accused of calling the prophet's wives whores, I didn't
do it,'' he said.
   ``I'm not this kind of creature with horns and a tail that's
been painted,'' he said. ``There is actually very little in
`Satanic Verses' that hasn't been, in fact, quite commonplace
discussion in the Moslem world for hundreds of years.''
   Wallace said he met with the author at a police officers' club
on the outskirts of London.
