   The leader of Moslems in Belgium, the
Netherlands and Luxembourg and his aide were shot and killed
Wednesday, five weeks after the imam distanced himself from Iran's
death sentence for author Salman Rushdie.
   Imam Abdullah Al Ahdal, a 36-year-old Saudi Arabian and moderate
Moslem, and Salem El Behir, a 40-year-old Tunisian who headed the
Brussels mosque's social services and library, were shot at close
range in the imam's office in the mosque, police said.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility, and no arrests were
made. Police said there were no witnesses and that no one heard the
gunshots.
   The two men each were shot twice, once in the head and once in
the neck, police said. Unconfirmed reports said three hooded men
were seen jumping from a van, entering the mosque and then coming
out again.
   The bodies were found by members of the Islamic community early
Wednesday evening.
   On Feb. 14, Iranian revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini issued a death sentence for Rushdie for ``The Satanic
Verses,'' a novel many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   In a Feb. 20 interview on RTBF, Belgium's French-language
television network, Ahdal agreed that Rushdie's book was
blasphemous.
   But he said of Khomeini's death sentence: ``One should not have
done that. Rushdie should have first appeared (before an Islamic
tribunal). He should have explained himself, defend himself. He
should have been asked to repent.''
   In democratic societies ``everyone has the right to speak his
thoughts, to express himself as he wants,'' Ahdal said.
   Claude van Engeland, an RTBF reporter, said Wednesday the
network had received angry phone calls after the interview from
callers who claimed Ahdal, who spoke in Arabic, was improperly
translated.
   Ahdal's mosque, in a park near the European Economic Community
headquarters, is part of the London-based World Islamic League.
   After the killings, police cordoned off the building.
   At one point a woman wearing a black veil emerged from the
building and threatened a reporter with a handgun. Several police
officers struggled with the woman and wrested the gun from her.
They said later she was Ahdal's widow.
   Rushdie, a Briton who was born in India to a Moslem family but
no longer practices religion, is in hiding in Britain. Moslems
object to ``The Satanic Verses'' because of a brothel scene in
which prostitutes take the names of the Prophet Mohammed's wives
and because it suggests Mohammed wrote the holy Koran instead of
receiving it from Allah.
   Members of the Islamic community told reporters outside the
building their mosque takes a very conciliatory tone.
   ``We respect everybody,'' one said on condition of anonymity.
``We do not take radical positions.''
   Ahdal had been in Brussels for six years heading the Moslem
community in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. His aide had
been here for about 10 years.
   Mohammed Sulim, a professor of Islamic religion, asked the
Moslem community to remain calm.
   He said, ``We are a few days from the Ramadan,'' which Moslems
mark with a month of fasting during the day.
   ``These are days for prayer. One must not seek revenge. The imam
was a tolerant man, a generous man, he lent his money to several
people.''
