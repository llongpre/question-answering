<LEADPARA>  IS Salman Rushdie a born-again Muslim, seeking, as he wrote in the Dec. 28 New
York Times op-ed page, to "enter into the body of Islam after a lifetime spent
outside it"?;    Or is he tired of nearly two years of hiding from fanatics
who pledged to carry out the Ayatollah Khomeini's death sentence on the
heretical author of "The Satanic Verses"?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Anyone who's read one of Rushdie's multi-layered, allegorical, fantastical,
satirical novels would suspect that nothing Rushdie says has only one
meaning.;    After a Christmas Eve meeting with six moderate Muslim leaders,
Rushdie issued a statement saying "I do not agree with any statements in my
novel . . . uttered by any of the characters who insult the prophet Mohammed,
or cast aspersions upon Islam, or upon the authenticity of the holy Koran, or
who reject the divinity of Allah.";    About 1.2-million English-language
copies of "The Satanic Verses," about the improbable adventures of a Muslim
immigrant in Britain, have been sold (though not necessarily read), and the
book has been translated into 15 languages.;    Rushdie described the book in
his op-ed piece as "a parable of how a man can be destroyed by loss of faith .
. . the dreams in which all the so-called 'insults' (to Islam) occur are
portraits of his disintegration and explicitly referred to in the novel as
punishments and retributions.";    While not withdrawing the book from stores,
Rushdie promised not to permit new translations of "The Satanic Verses," or an
English-language paperback edition, and pledged "to work for a better
understanding of Islam.";    Rushdie may be able to sit and schmooze with
leaders of the Islamic Society for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance in the
United Kingdom and the Supreme Council of Scholars of Islamic Affairs, but
he's still having trouble with the ayatollah's heirs.;    An editorial in the
newspaper Tehran Abrar promptly rejected his apology, saying the ayatollah's
death sentence "is irrevocable even if (Rushdie) repents.";    On the other
hand, Iran's new leaders are prone to playing good mullah, bad mullah, and
some believe Rushdie's recantation eventually will do the trick.;    The
religious thugs' attempt to silence Rushdie is an affront to human freedom. It
is distinctly unpleasant to see a novelist forced to beg forgiveness and
suppress wider publication of his own book.;    Still, the writer is not only
alive, he's writing.;    In Rushdie's new book, "Haroun and the Sea of
Stories," which is dedicated to his son, the boy Haroun undertakes a quest to
free his father, the Shah of Blah, from storytellers' block caused by the
fanatical Khattam-Shud, who has poisoned the Ocean of the Streams of Story. As
the enemy of "stories and fancies and dreams" explains to Haroun: "Your world,
my world, all worlds are there to be Ruled. And inside every single story,
inside every Stream in the Ocean, there lies a world, a storyworld, that I
cannot Rule at all. And that is the reason why.";    And that is the reason
why Rushdie must not be silenced.  </TEXT>
