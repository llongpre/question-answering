   A colorful, easy-to-read version of the Koran in
comic book form has won approval from some Islamic authorities, but
one scholar has condemned it, calling the author ``a new Salman
Rushdie.''
   ``Si Le Coran M'etait Conte'' _ ``If the Koran Were Told To
Me,'' is geared to readers aged 12 to 16, said its author, Youssef
Seddik.
   The Koran is the sacred book of Islam. According to Islamic
belief, it contains the words of God as revealed to the prophet
Mohammed.
   The comic books, which cost about $10 each, have been approved
and even encouraged by some religious authorities such as Ayatollah
Mehdi Rouhani, spiritual leader of the Shiite Moslem community in
Europe.
   ``I don't see any problem with the comic books, as long as you
know there is a precedent _ an illustrated version of the Koran
published in Iran 15 years ago,'' Rouhani said in an interview at
his Paris home.
   Rouhani called comic books ``the language of the 20th century.''
   ``I'm all for comic books, and would encourage them if they do,
in fact, get across the idea of God to young people,'' he said.
   But Mohammed Faidallah, head of Islamic Jurisprudence at Kuwait
University's Islamic Studies faculty, was quoted Friday as saying
the comic books could spark a furor like that over Rushdie's novel,
``The Satanic Verses.''
   In February 1989, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Rushdie
should die because his novel blasphemed Islam. Rushdie has been in
hiding ever since.
   Faidallah said the comic books constituted a ``criminal act that
ridicules the sanctity of the holy Koran,'' and called for their
condemnation, the Kuwait newspaper Al-Qabas reported.
   He was quoted as calling Seddik ``a new Salman Rushdie recruited
to carry out this ugly task.'' Faidallah urged Arab and Islamic
embassies in Paris ``to pressure official bodies there with a view
to halting such violation of Islamic values,'' the daily said.
   Seddik, a Tunisian-born journalist who has written extensively
on Arab culture, said Friday he was ``deeply saddened'' by
Faidallah's reaction and disputed the scholar's right to judge the
issue.
   ``Islam is my emotional and spiritual roots. Nothing, no one can
ever take it away from me,'' he said.
   ``I'm deeply attached to the principle that distinguishes Islam
from Judaiism and Christianity: that it does not accept the idea of
the clergy. Only the knowledge, competence and good intentions of
the humblest Moslem can judge our actions.''
   In an earlier interview, Seddik said he was motivated to adapt
the Koran because of his frustration from studying the text as a
child.
   ``I remember feeling very sad that we had to learn the text by
heart, without any comprehension or understanding of what it
meant,'' said Seddik, 46. ``I was one of the lucky ones _ my father
was a learned man and he would explain things to me at home.''
   Seddik said the drawings and simple language can help young
readers follow the narrative development of the Koran's many
episodes, while avoiding its ``inextricable forest of syntactic,
lexical and theological difficulties.''
   Volume One, ``The Cursed Peoples,'' contains vivid pictures of
dessert peoples worshiping idols, living in sin, and deaf to pleas
of the prophets to change their ways and worship a single God.
   The drawings, which Rouhani described as ``naive and
simplistic,'' are accompanied by exact quotations from the Koran,
complete with chapter and verse references. The prophets are not
represented, but evoked by flashes of light.
   Seddik said he was careful not to offend or blaspheme in any
way, and even destroyed 10,000 copies of a 1986 edition that
displeased religious leaders.
   The new version, he said, got the OK from religious bodies in
Algeria and Tunisia.
   A spokesman for the rector of the Grand Mosque in Paris was less
enthusiastic. ``Comic books dealing with transcendental issues have
no instructive value, and, in fact frustrate the development of the
adolescent imagination,'' said Jhaothy Hadjeddine Sari.
   ``Imposing an image of the transcendental on a young person is
tantamount to castration,'' he said. ``I can't see teaching the
Koran in comic books any more than I can imagine teaching
philospohy or math.''
   Seddik said his desire to publish the comic books was
politically motivated.
   ``The rise of Arab fundamentalism is partly a result of the way
the Koran is being taught as something opaque and incantatory,
understood by the elite few who run Islam like a secret society to
which only they have access,'' he said.
   Seddik said the wisdom of the Koran should be available to
everyone ``so people can draw their own conclusions and decide how
to live their lives.''
   Seddik admits that comic books violate one of the key tenants of
Islam: the reproduction of images. ``Of course, it's a taboo, but
I'm willing to assume full responsibility,'' he said.
   Seddik says he respects the sacredness of Islam.
   ``I don't blaspheme, I don't portray Aicha as a prostitute,'' he
said, referring to a passage in ``The Satanic Verses'' about
Mohammed's child bride that offended many Moslems.
   Seddik said the seven-volume project was financed by Hocine
Meddahi, an Algerian industrialist who lives in Paris. Three
volumes have already appeared, in French and Arabic, and an English
translation is in progress.
