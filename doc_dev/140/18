<HEAD>Britain Taking Threats Against Diplomats Seriously</HEAD>

   The Foreign Office said Friday it is taking
seriously death threats against British diplomats in Europe in
connection with Salman Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Senior diplomatic officials were singled out in letters written
by a group calling itself The Defenders of Islamic Purity, a
spokesman said, speaking anonymously in keeping with British
practice.
   He said ``appropriate action'' was taken, but no details were
being revealed about people threatened or in what countries they
worked.
   Many Moslems around the world say Rushdie's novel blasphemes
Islam. The book includes a scene in which prostitutes take the
names of the prophet Mohammed's wives, and it suggests Mohammed
wrote the holy Koran, instead of receiving it from Allah.
   On Feb. 14, Iran's leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a
death sentence against Rushdie, who remains in hiding. Rushdie,
born in India of Moslem parents, now is a British citizen.
   The Brussels newspaper Libre Belgique said Friday in an article
signed by crime reporter Roger Rosart that the British Embassy in
Brussels received threats.
   An embassy spokesman in Brussels confirmed that, but said no
staff were singled out by name and no staff were moved to other
posts, reported Press Association, the British domestic news agency.
   Belgian authorities would not comment.
   Rosart said three letters from The Defenders of Islamic Purity
which came into the hands of Belgian police blamed the British
attitude in the Rushdie affair and listed British diplomats who
were to be killed soon. It said two of the letters went to the
embassy.
   The paper reported that the threats warned family and friends to
steer clear of intended victims lest they be harmed, too. It said a
large number of these diplomats either returned to Britain or were
transferred elsewhere.
   The Foreign Office spokesman said: ``Similar letters have gone
to various embassies in Europe. These threats are always taken
seriously and we have acted accordingly.''
   Libre Belgique said Belgian authorities were arranging strict
protective measures in view of the Brussels murder of Imam Abdullah
Al-Ahdal and his aide on March 29.
   Ahdal, a Saudi cleric and leader of the Moslems of Belgium,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands, was shot after receiving death
threats for opposing Khomeini's death sentence on Rushdie.
   In other Rushdie developments:
   _Iran strongly protested the showing and sale of a few copies of
``The Satanic Verses'' during Geneva's International Book Fair. A
statement issued by the Iranian Embassy in Bern on Friday said the
action violates Swiss laws calling for respect of religious beliefs
and insults the rights of more than 90,000 Moslems living in
Switzerland.
   _A judge in Caracas ruled on Thursday in favor of Venezuela's
Islamic Center, saying publication of ``The Satanic Verses''
violated religious freedom. The Islamic Center, representing
Venezuelan Moslems, had brought suit against a publisher planning
to bring out the book.
