   Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist squad today said it
was investigating a bomb blast linked to the campaign against Salman
Rushdie, the target of death threats for his novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Police said an anonymous caller, who mentioned Rushdie's book,
telephoned with a bomb threat shortly before the device exploded
late Sunday outside Liberty's department store in central London. A
woman passer-by was injured.
   The store was closed at the time, but by day the area is one of
the busiest in London's congested West End.
   Until recently, Liberty's housed a Penguin bookstore concession.
``The Satanic Verses'' was published last year under the Viking
imprint, which is part of the Penguin group.
   The novel angered religious Moslems around the world, who claim
it blasphemes their religion.
   Viking Penguin received death threats against its staff after the
Islamic campaign began and two London bookstores, one specializing
in Penguin books, were damaged in arson attacks on April 9.
   ``There used to be a Penguin paperback bookshop in the store, on
the ground floor near the area of our present bookshop, but it
closed a couple of months ago,'' said a spokeswoman for Liberty's.
   The new bookstore does not stock ``The Satanic Verses,'' she
said, requesting anonymity.
   The injured woman, who was not identified, underwent surgery for
leg injuries and was in satisfactory condition at University College
Hospital.
   She is the first person known to have been hurt in Britain in the
worldwide campaign by Moslem zealots against the novel.
   Detective chief superintendent Derek Willison said that 10 or 15
minutes before the blast police received an anonymous telephone
warning which mentioned ``The Satanic Verses.'' He would not give
other details.
   As police were searching the area, the bomb went off on the
sidewalk in Great Marlborough Street near a window of the Liberty
department store where books were displayed.
   Willison said Rushdie's book was not among them, but books issued
by his publishers, Viking Penguin, were in the window.
   Liberty's, established in 1875 and housed in a mock Tudor
black-and-white building on the corner of Regent Street and Great
Marlborough Street, has an international reputation as a fashion
leader in textiles.
   Willison described the bomb as ``small'' and other police
officers said there was no damage to buildings. But Tracy Ryan, 23,
who was looking in a store window across the street spoke of a large
blast.
   ``Suddenly there was a huge bang. It was really frightening and
the pavement (sidewalk) shook. It was a terrible bang,'' she said.
   Early today, police sealed off the area around the store and were
checking for clues and taking photographs. They finally left at 5
a.m., removing barrier tapes. There was a bloodstain on the sidewalk
where the woman was injured.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since February, when Iran's late
religious leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called on Moslems
worldwide to kill him for his novel allegedly blaspheming Islam. Two
Iranian clerics have offered a $5.2 million bounty for Rushdie's
death.
   Rushdie's American wife, Marianne Wiggins, has said she left him
five weeks ago because she could not stand the strain.
   Moslems in Britain have burned the novel and demonstrated against
it. In Pakistan and India, at least a score of people have been
killed and hundreds injured in riots protesting the book.
   In the novel, prostitutes are named after the wives of the
prophet Mohammed prophets and that Mohammed wrote the Koran, Islam's
holiest book, instead of receiving the words from Allah.
