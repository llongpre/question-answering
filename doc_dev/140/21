   Moslem fundamentalist leaders in Iran said today
that suicide squads were preparing to carry out the ``death
sentence'' imposed on novelist Salman Rushdie and his publishers by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The declaration on Tehran Radio followed other reports that death
squads from Islamic countries were en route to Britain in search of
the writer, whose novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has outraged many
Moslem fundamentalists.
   Britain, which reopened its embassy in Tehran in December for the
first time in eight years, condemned the threats and announced it
had frozen plans to ``build up further our embassy.''
   United News of India and the British Broadcasting Corp. said
telephone callers threatened to bomb British planes to India unless
Rushdie appeared in public. Two airlines, British Airways and Air
Europe, said they were taking the threat seriously.
   The Indian news agency said a man claiming to speak for the
previously unheard of Iranian Guards telephoned its Bombay office
today with the threats.
   Pakistan's government demanded the United States and Britain ban
the book and that all copies of it be destroyed. Six people died in
Pakistan during a weekend riot over the book.
   An Iranian cleric on Wednesday offered up to $2.6 million for
Rushdie's murder, and the author canceled a U.S. promotional tour
that was scheduled to begin Friday.
   A leading Islamic theologian in Egypt said today Khomeini erred
in sending death squads after Rushdie without first giving him a
chance to repent. Sheik Mohammed Hossam-el-Din said the book should
be banned and burned, but executing its author would be ``virtually
impossible'' under the tenets of Islam.
   British news media said the Indian-born Rushdie was hiding with
his wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins, under police guard.
Press Association, the domestic British news agency, said Rushdie's
first wife, Clarissa Luard, also had been given police protection.
   Tehran Radio, monitored in Cyprus, said religious figures in the
northwestern Iranian city of Urumiyeh declared in a statement:
   ``We have already put on our death shrouds and pledge to carry
out the Imam's (Khomeini's) death sentence against Salman Rushdie
and his publishers in the United States and Europe.''
   Iran's lone diplomat in Britain, Mohammed Basti, was summoned to
the Foreign Office in London to discuss the situation and emerged
defiant, telling reporters Khomeini's ``decree or verdict'' had been
delivered ``after careful consideration.''
   ``It has nothing to do particularly with your country,'' the
charge d'affaires said.
   The Foreign Office called Khomeini's statement ``totally
unacceptable.''
   ``We recognize that Moslems and others may have strong views
about the contents of Mr. Rushdie's book,'' it said in a statement.
``However, no one has the right to incite people to violence on
British soil or against British citizens.''
   Rushdie, 41, was born into a Moslem family in India but is a
British citizen. Since ``The Satanic Verses'' was published in
Britain in September, it has sold more than 100,000 copies here and
received critical acclaim.
   Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said today protests were being filed
in Washington and London seeking a ban on the novel.
   Pakistani fundamentalist leaders called for nationwide protests
Friday to condemn the book and denounce the deaths and injuries in
Sunday's protests by Moslem fundamentalists demanding ``The Satanic
Verses'' be pulled from U.S. shelves.
   The book has been banned in countries with large Moslem
populations, including India and South Africa, as well as most
Islamic nations, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Egypt.
   No official ban has been announced in Iran, where the population
is overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem, but most foreign publications have
been banned in that country for years.
   In New York, a statement issued on behalf of author and publisher
said ``the current climate is not appropriate for a promotional tour
in the United States.'' The statement said: ``We reiterate that no
offense was intended in the creation or publication of this work.''
   The French publishing house Christian Bourgois said it was
delaying publication of the novel to avoid risk to the company, its
clients and readers.
   One of Italy's leading publishing companies, Arnoldo Mondadori
Editore SpA, announced today it will go ahead with next week's
planned release of ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Wednesday
that a senior Moslem clergyman in Iran, Hojatoleslam Hassan Saneie,
had offered $2.6 million to any Iranian who kills Rushdie and $1
million to a foreigner who kills the author.
   Tehran Radio said today that Mohammad Hashemian, the religious
leader in the southeastern city of Kerman, pledged another $2.6
million reward.
   A major character in the novel is named Mahound, a medieval
corruption of the name of the prophet Mohammed. Moslems have
complained the book represents the prophet's wives as prostitutes
and suggests that he wrote the Koran, rather than receiving it from
God.
   The title refers to verses Mohammed removed from the Koran,
Islam's holy book, believing they had been inspired by the devil.
