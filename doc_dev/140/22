   Iran called on Moslem officials
attending a conference here Wednesday to support Iran's decision to
break relations with Britain and call for the execution of author
Salman Rushdie.
   But the Saudi Arabian foreign minister, who is chairman of the
46-member Organization of Islamic Conference, said he believed the
organization would only denounce Rushdie and his book, ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   ``Iran was honored to have broken ties with the leader of the
plot,'' Mohammad Taskhiri, head of Iran's delegation, said referring
to Britain in a speech at the foreign ministers' conference.
   Taskhiri urged all Islamic governments to stand united against
what he described as ``these mean attempts to offend the image of
the Prophet Mohammed, his wives and daughters.''
   ``If we are silent now, the West will make a film and then a
video'' of ``The Satanic Verses,'' he said.
   ``We demand that the punishment decreed by Allah be meted out on
that apostate (Rushdie). We also demand that all Islamic countries
boycott Britain culturally and, if that doesn't work, then
politically and economically.''
   The punishment Taskhiri referred to was a fatwa, or religious
ruling, issued by the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
ordering Rushdie's execution for blasphemy.
   Iranian clerics later offered up to $5.2 million to anyone who
killed the 41-year-old author, who was born into a Moslem family in
India, but who later moved to Britain, where he has been under
police guard since the death threat.
   The Saudi Arabian foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, told
reporters:
   ``The conference examined the insufferable affronts and
distortions of Islam in Rushdie's book, which has been strongly
condemned and denounced.''
   He indicated the conference could not condone Iran's order to
kill Rushdie and punish Britain for protecting him.
   He said the conference attaches great importance to the ``spirit
of harmony between all world civilizations and countries.''
   In Rushdie's novel, the archangel Gabriel is depicted as an
Indian movie star. A scribe claims he altered the words of the holy
Koran _ considered the word of God _ without the prophet noticing.
And a whorehouse triples its business when its 12 women take on the
identities of the prophets' wives.
   At least 19 people have been killed in anti-Rushdie protests in
Pakistan and India, and the book has been banned in those countries
and others, including Egypt, South Africa and Bangladesh.
   In Peshawar, Pakistan, on Wednesday, a bomb exploded and tore a
two-foot hole in the roof of a British Council library. A library
official linked the blast, in which no one was hurt, to Moslem
outrage over Rushdie's novel.
   Sudan announced Wednesday it was banning all books written by
Rushdie or issued by his publisher, Viking Penguin.
   In an interview earlier Wednesday, Taskhiri insisted that Rushdie
be judged according to the sharia, or Koranic law _ which he said
requires the death sentence for blasphemy. ``That would be the end
of our request,'' Taskhiri said. ``It is impossible for Iran to
change its basic position on the issue.''
   Conference sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most
delegates follow another interpretation of the sharia, insisting
that anyone accused of blasphemy be given a fair trial and an
oppportunity to repent.
   Islamic theologians meeting in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the holiest
shrine of Islam, issued a declaration Tuesday supporting that
interpretation.
   Several delegates were trying to work out a compromise between
Iran and the more liberal group led by Saudi Arabia, the sources
said.
