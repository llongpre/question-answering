   Salman Rushdie, born in India to a Moslem family,
has ignited fires of protest among Moslems worldwide with his
prize-winning novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' a story about the
eternal conflict between good and evil.
   The novel takes its name from the verses the Prophet Mohammad
removed from Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they were
inspired by Satan.
   Moslem critics _ whom Rushdie has called fundamentalist
extremists _ say the book is blasphemous and have protested from
London to New Delhi.
   On Sunday, five people died and at least 80 were wounded when
police fired on a crowd of protesters outside a U.S. government
office in Islamabad, Pakistan, who were demanding that the United
States ban the book.
   The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British
TV personality, both passengers who fall from an airliner blown up
by terrorists en route from India to London.
   They are presumed dead but they survive, or are reborn, and take
on the attributes of the angel Gabriel and Satan.
   Rushdie denies that his novel attacks the Islamic religion, which
he says has been of central importance to him all his life. He said
it deals with ``migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love,
death, London and Bombay.''
   He said the disputed passage concerning a prophet living in a
fantastic city of sand which dissolves when water falls upon it,
happens in a dream -- ``the fictional dream of a fictional character
... and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further from
history could one get?''
   The novel was first published in Britain in September and got
generally good reviews but it was banned in India and some Arab
countries. Moslem religious leaders in Britain condemned it as a
``deliberate attack on a faith and its founders.''
   Moslems threatened to boycott bookshops stocking it and some
shops, frightened by demonstrators, removed it from their shelves.
   British writers protested the attacks and playwright Tom
Stoppard, poet Stephen Spender and novelist Kingsley Amis were among
a number who cabled Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi protesting at
the ban.
   In November, the book won the ``new novel'' category in the
annual literary competition sponsored by the Whitbread brewing
giant, but it did not win the overall Whitbread prize, which went in
January to a first novel by another writer.
   The Guardian, London's liberal daily, on Monday quoted Rushdie as
saying he was ``very upset'' at the deaths in Islamabad on Saturday
and he felt that leaders of Pakistan's religious parties were
whipping up emotion.
   Rushdie was quoted as saying: ``The thing that is most disturbing
is that they are talking about a book that doesn't exist. The book
that is worth killing people for and burning flags for is not the
book that I wrote. The people who demonstrated in Pakistan and who
were killed haven't actually read the book because it isn't on sale
there.''
   Rushdie is 41 and a British citizen. He grew up in Bombay, came
to Britain at age 14 and won honors for history studies at Cambridge
University.
   He has six books behind him, including three prize-winning
novels, ``Midnight's Children,'' ``Shame'' and ``The Satanic
Verses,'' and ``The Jaguar Smile'' about his travels in Nicaragua.
