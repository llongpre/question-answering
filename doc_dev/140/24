   Mahound is a businessman who decides to start a new religion in
the city of Jahilia. Only problem, Jahilia already has 360 gods and
doesn't need another.
   But the head of the ruling council proproses a deal: If Mahound's
Allah (the Islamic god) will accept three of the local gods _ Lat,
Uzza and Manat _ as archangels in his sect, he can have his religion
and also a seat on the council. He takes the deal.
   Mahound appears in a dream sequence in the Salman Rushdie book,
``The Satanic Verses.'' He represents Mohammed, revered by Moslems
as the prophet who set down Allah's revelations in the Koran,
Islam's holy book. And the novel's portrayal of Mahound-Mohammed _
as a womanizer, a moral coward willing to compromise his faith for
general acceptance, a conniving businessman who makes up laws to
suit his own purposes _ has inflamed the Islamic world.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is a dizzying 547-page journey through
countless plots, sub-plots, satire and philosophical questions.
   Lyrical, scathing, inquisitive and, at times, bewildering, the
novel's subjects include society's preconceptions of good and evil,
the British treatment of illegal aliens, the desire by Indians to
become assimilated in British culture and, most notably, the birth
of the Islamic faith.
   Rushdie, a 41-year-old native of Bombay, India, who now lives in
London, writes in a stream-of-consciousness style that leaves the
reader alternately exhilirated, bewildered and _ depending on one's
religious and political orientation _ outraged.
   The book opens with the bombing of a jumbo jet by terrorists. Two
of the passengers _ Gibreel Farishta, an Indian actor who
specializes in religious roles, and Saladin Chamcha, a radio star _
manage to survive by literally falling from the sky. Once they land,
Gibreel assumes an ``angelic glow'' and Saladin grows horns and
hooves.
   The book's second, fourth, and sixth chapters, ``Mahound,''
``Ayesha'' and ``Return to Jahilia,'' contain the most controversial
elements involving Gibreel's dream sequence.
   During the dream, Mahound has a revelation in Gibreel's presence
telling him to accept the deal. But he soon learns that the
supposedly divine message did not come from Gibreel (the archangel)
but from the Devil, who had been impersonating him.
   Mahound renounces the satanic ``verses.'' He and his followers
settle in the ``friendly oasis'' of Yathrib, just as Mohammed
journeyed from Mecca to Medina. There Mahound dictates to a Persian
scribe named Salman the rules of the new religion as prescribed by
Gibreel. But Salman doubts these ``revelations'' because God sounds
too much like a businessman.
   Convinced that Mahound is making up the rules himself, Salman
decides to test his leader by deliberately changing what is recited
to him:
   ``Here's the point: Mahound did not notice the alterations. So
there I was, actually writing the Book, or rewriting, anyway,
polluting the word of God with my own profane language. But, good
heavens, if my poor words could not be distinguished from the
Revelation by God's own Messenger, then what did that mean? What did
that say about the quality of the divine poetry? Look, I swear, I
was shaken to my soul.''
