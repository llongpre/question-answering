   Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' is
filled with references to the Islamic faith founded by Mohammed.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought Allah's
revelations in the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   Three main characters in the book are Mahound, the prophet of a
city of sand called Jahilia and recipient of a revelation in which
satanic verses mingle with divine; an Indian movie star, Gibreel
Farishta; and Saladin Chamcha.
   As the book opens, Farishta and Chamcha are passengers on a
hijacked jetliner. The plane blows up. They fall clinging to each
other singing rival songs. Gibreel becomes the archangel Gabriel,
although Rushdie continues to call him Gibreel, and Chamcha the
devil.
   Locked into conflict, their identities blur.
   In one passage Gibreel sees God:
   ``Gibreel's vision of the Supreme Being was not abstract in the
least. He saw, sitting on the bed, a man of about the same age as
himself, of medium height, fairly heavily built, with
salt-and-pepper beard cropped close to the line of the jaw. What
struck him most was that the apparition was balding, seemed to
suffer from dandruff and wore glasses. This was not the Almighty he
had expected. `Who are you?' he asked with interest...
   ```Ooparvala,' the apparition answered. `The Fellow Upstairs.'
   ```How do I know you're not the other One,' Gibreel asked
craftily, `Neechayvala, the Guy from Underneath?'''
   Another passage is set in a brothel called The Curtain where
prostitutes adopt the names of some of Mohammed's 12 wives,
including Ayesha and Hafsah.
   ``It was during one of these playful sessions at the end of a
working day, when the girls were alone with their eunuchs and their
wine, that Baal heard the youngest talking about her client, the
grocer, Musa. `That one,' she said. `He's got a bee in his bonnet
about the Prophet's wives. He's so annoyed about them that he gets
excited just by mentioning their names. He tells me that I
personally am the spitting image of Ayesha herself, and she's His
Nib's favorite, as all are aware. So there'...
   ``When the news got around Jahilia that the whores of The Curtain
had each assumed the identity of one of Mahound's wives, the
clandestine excitement of the city's males was intense.''
   Charles Eaton, a British scholar and convert to Islam, told The
Guardian newspaper this is one of the most offensive passages to
Moslems _ the ``equivalent offense to presenting the Virgin Mary as
a whore.''
   ``Salman Rushdie, who was brought up in Islam, knows exactly
where to put the needle in,'' said Eaton, also known as Hasan
Abdul-Hakim. ``Western readers very often don't see this.''
   Another passage tells of the Persian scribe, Salman, who takes
dictation from the prophet, and begins to add his own inventions:
   ``Little things at first. If Mahound recited a verse in which God
was described as all-hearing, all-knowing, I would write, all
knowing, all-wise. Here's the point: Mahound did not notice the
alterations. So there I was, actually writing the Book, or
rewriting, anyway, polluting the word of God with my own profane
language. But, good heavens, if my poor words could not be
distinguished from the Revelation by God's own Messenger, then what
did that mean? What did that say about the quality of the divine
poetry? Look, I swear, I was shaken to my soul.
   ``It's one thing to be a smart bastard and have half-suspicions
about funny business, but it's quite another thing to find out that
you're right. Listen: I changed my life for that man. I left my
country, crossed the world, settled among people who thought me a
slimy foreign coward for saving their, who never appreciated what I,
but never mind that. The truth is that what I expected when I made
that first tiny change, all-wise instead of all-hearing _ what I
wanted _ was to read it back to the Prophet, and he'd say, What's
the matter with you, Salman, are you going deaf? And I'd say, Oops,
O God, bit of a slip, how could I, and correct myself. But it didn't
happen; and now I was writing the Revelation and nobody was
noticing, and I didn't have the courage to own up. I was scared
silly, I can tell you. Also: I was sadder than I have ever been...''
