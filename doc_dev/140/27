   Pro-Iranian kidnappers of three Americans
issued a statement Thursday vowing revenge on author Salman Rushdie
and his publishers for insulting Islam, but did not threaten harm to
the captives.
   The kidnappers, who call themselves Islamic Jihad for the
Liberation of Palestine, made the threat in an Arabic-language
statement delivered to a Western news agency with a photograph of
hostages Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner.
   They pledged ``revenge on all those who took part in strong and
ferocious campaigns against Islam ... all institutions and
organizations that insulted in one way or another'' the prophet
Mohammed and his family through Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's 88-year-old Shiite Moslem
patriarch, has ordered his followers to kill Rushdie.
   Steen, Polhill and Turner, kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from the
campus of Beirut University College, were shown from the knees up
seated on what appeared to be a bed, looking directly into the
camera.
   Polhill's left arm and hand were thinner than in a picture
released 14 months ago and his left sleeve was pulled up to the
elbow, showing what might be a deformity, but he was smiling.
   Turner, 42, sat on Polhill's left clad in a striped sweater and
dark trousers. Steen, 49, was on Turner's left in a dark track suit.
   Steen, who is from Boston, taught journalism at the college.
Polhill, 54, of New York, was assistant professor of business and
Turner, of Boise, Idaho, taught mathematics and computer science.
   They and six other Americans are among the 15 Western hostages in
Lebanon. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press, who was abducted March 16,
1985.
   Turner's wife, Badr, who knows all three men, said of Polhill's
arm: ``Maybe it's a shadow in the picture. I'm not aware that he had
a deformity in his left arm and hand.''
   She said the three captives have nothing to do with what the
captors are saying.''
   ``My husband looked fine, but I'm worried about their
psychological well-being,'' Mrs. Turner, who is Lebanese, said in a
telephone interview. ``We're suffering without them.'
   Neither Polhill's wife, Ferial, nor Steen's wife, Virginia Rose,
could be reached for comment.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said,
``We hold the kidnappers fully responsible for the safety and
welfare of all the hostages. The hostages are innocent victims. They
should be freed immediately and unconditionally.''
   In their statement, the abductors said their group had
``persistently sought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostages
issue, in accordance with its principles and to show its good
intentioins in light of international detente.''
   ``But it seems that Imperialism and Zionism consider that Moslems
should go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were the
price of living in the shadow of international detente,'' the
statement said. ``We are going to shatter their dreams and foil
their schemes.
   ``American Imperialism and international Zionism should realize
that by supporting the ugly contents of The Satanic Verses they have
linked the destiny of their interests with the fate that awaits the
so-called Indian author of the book as well as promoters of the
anti-Islam campaign.''
   The captors urged ``Moslems all over the world to stand against
the laws of the jungle so that advocates of these laws would realize
that real human values ... lie in spiritual religions and not in the
jungle's system.''
   Rushdie's book is ``the worst type of insult to Islam's
sacredness in general and the sacredness of ... Islam's prophet in
particular,'' part of a ``serious and wide-ranging programs under
way to strike against Islam because it is the force that fights
moral and humanitarian degeneration,'' the kidnappers said.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by portraying
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran,
the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it from God.
   An-Nahar, an independent Beirut newspaper, said efforts to free
the 15 hostages were undermined by the strain in Iran's relations
with the 12-nation European Economic Community caused by Khomeini's
execution order. It did not attribute the report.
   Reaction to Khomeini's death sentence has been mixed among
Moslems in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian group believed to be the umbrella for
Shiite extremists who hold most or all of the hostages, said a
statement Khomeini's decree was ``just'' and added:
   ``The publication of this book comes against a Zionist background
that manifests malicious intentions scheming to defame Islam. This
is also the purpose of the current campaign in the West,
particularly in the United States and Britain.''
   Hasan Saab, adviser to Sunni Moslem grand mufti Sheik Hassan
Khaled, declared: ``Islam does not allow the killing of man without
a trial. The Koran teaches us that the unjustified taking of one
life is tantamount to killing the whole world.''
