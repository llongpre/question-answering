   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on
Sunday rejected the apology of British writer Salman Rushdie and
exhorted Moslems around the world to ``send him to hell'' for his
novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In a statement issued by the official Islamic Republic News
Agency, Khomeini said the ``imperialist foreign mass media are
falsely alleging that officials of the Islamic Republic said that if
the author of `The Satanic Verses' repents, the execution order
against him would be abolished. This is denied, 100 percent.
   ``Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man
of time it is incumbent on every Moslem (to) employ everything he's
got, his life and wealth, to send him to hell,'' Khomeini was quoted
as saying.
   Khomeini, patriarch of the Islamic revolution, last week
sentenced Rushdie to death for his novel, which Moslems say insults
Islam.
   But Iranian President Ali Khamenei, allied with so-called
pragmatists led by parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, sought to
defuse the crisis Friday by saying Rushdie's life would be spared if
he apologized and repented.
   Rushdie, in hiding under the guard of Scotland Yard, issued an
apology Saturday.
   Khomeini's latest statement appeared to leave no room for a
negotiated settlement of the issue, which has put Britain's newly
restored relations with Iran in jeopardy.
   A bounty of $5.2 million has been put on Rushdie's head by
Iranian religious leaders since Khomeini issued the death sentence.
   In his message Sunday, Khomeini also called on non-Moslems to
help carry out the death sentence against Rushdie.
   ``If a non-Moslem becomes aware of his whereabouts and has the
ability to execute him quicker than a Moslem, it is incumbent on
Moslems to pay a reward or a fee in return for this action,'' the
statement said.
   Neither Khomeini's statement nor IRNA referred to the president's
offer of a reprieve, reflecting a widening rift in the Iranian
hierarchy over the Rushdie affair.
   In London, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office said: `We
heard of this report with great concern. We shall be considering
carefully its implications.
   ``This subject will, of course, be discussed in Brussels by the
Foreign Affairs Council'' on Monday, when Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe is to raise the issue, the spokesman said. He spoke on
condition of anonymity in keeping with British practice.
   The 41-year-old Rushdie, born to a Moslem family in India, has
not been seen in public since Thursday, two days after Khomeini's
first decree.
   In his apology issued through an agent, Rushdie said: ``As author
of `The Satanic Verses' I recognize that Moslems in many parts of
the world are genuinely distressed by the publication of my novel. I
profoundly regret the distress that publication has occasioned to
sincere followers of Islam.''
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting that he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather
than receiving it directly from God.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' is banned in Iran, India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.
   Publishers in France, West Germany, Greece and Turkey have
decided not to publish the book, and some bookstore chains in the
United States have pulled it from their shelves.
   In New York Sunday, a spokesman said Cardinal John J. O'Connor
criticized both ``The Satanic Verses'' and those who threaten its
author, and implied Catholics should avoid reading the novel.
   ``He (O'Connor) encourages everyone not to dignify the
publication of this work, which has been viewed by Moslems as highly
sacrilegious and offensive,'' said Msgr. Peter Finn, a spokesman for
the cardinal.
   In Canada, the government decided to allow entry of the book
after a review determined it was not ``hate propaganda'' as defined
by Canadian law, National Revenue Minister Otto Jelinek announced.
Canada had blocked imports of the book after receiving a complaint
from a Moslem group.
   The European Conference of Foreign Press Associations Sunday
called Khomeini's order an ``act of terrorism against freedom of
conscience, of religion and of opinion, values which are held to be
the truest expression of a civil and more human world.''
   Representatives of the group, in Rome for a three-day meeting,
sent a telegram to the Iranian ambassador to Italy and to the Holy
See.
   In Yugoslavia, the leading Communist Party daily began printing
excerpts of ``The Satanic Verses'' in its early Monday edition.
   The printing of the excerpts in the daily Borba coincides with
the arrival Monday of Khamenei on a three-day visit to Yugoslavia,
the Iranian president's first official trip to a European country.
