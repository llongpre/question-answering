<HEAD>No Change in Blasphemy Laws, Britain Decides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Britain's ancient blasphemy laws will not be
changed because it would be difficult and could damage relations
among religious groups, the Home Office Minister John Patten said in
a letter to Moslem leaders on Tuesday.
   Patten also reiterated the government's lack of authority to ban
Salman Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems
believe blasphemes Islam. He stressed the British author's right to
freedom of expression.
   Patten urged the 1 million Moslems and other ethnic groups to
participate more fully in British society, saying no room exists for
separation or segregation.
   Moslems and others want the blasphemy law extended to reflect
Britain's multicultural society. The law covers only Christianity,
specifically the Church of England, and has been used in courts only
twice in the past 67 years.
   ``The difficulties in redefining what should or should not be
blasphemous would be immense,'' Patten wrote.
   ``Should protection be extended to all faiths, including the very
minor or very obscure? Should it extend only to faiths believing in
one God? Or to major or mainstream faiths only? I believe there is
no equitable, just or right answer to these questions.''
   Patten said the government also feared ``a rush of litigation
which would damage relations between faiths.''
   He said Christians no longer rely on the law, ``preferring to
recognize that the strength of their own belief is the best armor
against mockers and blasphemers.''
   Patten acknowledged the continuing controversy over ``The Satanic
Verses,'' and said the government ``understands how much hurt and
anxiety that book has caused, and ... that insults, particularly to
a deeply held faith, are not easily forgotten or forgiven.''
   Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in India, has been in hiding
since Feb. 14 when Iran's late leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
ordered he be killed for blaspheming Islam. Khomeini died on June 3,
but the death sentence remains.
   Moslems say his book blasphemes Islam by associating the prophet
Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting that the Koran, Islam's
holy book, was Mohammed's invention, not Allah's own work.
   Kalim Siddiqui, director of The Moslem Institute, said the
government ``has learned nothing'' from the controversy.
   ``There is no such thing as absolute freedom of expression or
speech,'' he said. ``We enjoy our freedom within certain limits.''
   He said Moslem leaders will meet to consider a response to
Patten's letter.
   ``We cannot live in this country together with `The Satanic
Verses' and Salman Rushdie,'' he said. ``They will have to go.''
   Liaqat Hussain, general secretary of the Council of Mosques in
Bradford, England, said, ``We will continue to protest and carry on
our campaign within the framework of the law.''
