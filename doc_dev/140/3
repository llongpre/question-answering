   The following is the text of a statement
issued Wednesday by the Revolutionary Justice Organization, which
holds American hostages in Lebanon. The Arabic-language statement
was translated by The Associated Press in Beirut.
   In the name of the Almighty.
   After a thorough reading of The Satanic Verses book and its
contents that insult Islam and the Arab prophet, and after examining
the study of the so-called Salman Rushdie, the Revolutionary Justice
Organization declares that it has completed its preparations to
execute the just sentence issued by the esteemed cleric and the
great struggler Ayatollah Khomeini against Salman Rushdie. Hence, it
puts forward the following evidence for carrying out the sentence:
   1. Insulting Islam and the Arab prophet is an insult to the
latest and greatest human civilization represented by revolutionary
Islam.
   2. Salman Rushdie's record indicates that he was a branch member
of the Freemasons' movement in England. Immediately after the
publication of his Satanic Verses book, he was promoted to full
official membership of the Freemasons' highest council in England
(or the church of organized atheism) which combats divine religions,
especially christianity and Islam and their great prophets.
   3. Imam Ayatollah Khomeini, with his acute awareness of the grave
consequences against the future of the divine religions emanating
from this Freemasonic and Zionist attack, has handed down his
verdict when the Arabs and those who claim to be the protectors of
Islam and speak for all the Moslems remained in tight silence.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization also declares that before
taking any measures, it will find itself compelled to attack British
police posts assigned to protect Salman Rushdie in order to get to
him to carry out the sentence. We hold the British government
responsible in advance for the human and material losses among the
British police and their posts that could result from the attacks on
them. This warning applies to all countries that are currently
negotiating with the British government to extend asylum and
protection to Rushdie.
   Victory to the oppressed
   Glory and immortality to the martyrs
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization.
