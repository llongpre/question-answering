   A hard-line Tehran newspaper today
rejected Salman Rushdie's efforts to end Moslem anger over his
novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' It said the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's death edict still stands.
   The British author announced Monday that he has embraced Islam
and will not allow the book to be published in paperback. He also
pledged that he would no longer seek to have the novel published in
other languages.
   The novel has sold 1 million copies and already been translated
into 15 languages. The book is banned by 20 countries.
   The Abrar daily said in an editorial that ``Khomeini's historic
edict on Rushdie is irrevocable even if he (Rushdie) repents.''
   In February 1989, the Iranian fundamentalist patriarch called on
Moslems to seek out and kill Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming
Islam in ``The Satanic Verses.'' Iran subsequently offered a $1
million bounty for Rushdie's death.
   Rushdie has been in hiding ever since.
   Rushdie announced his concessions to Moslems in a statement
released in London by one of several Islamic leaders with whom he
met in secret on Monday.
   Hesham el-Essawy, president of the Islamic Society for the
Promotion of Religious Tolerance, said Rushdie had typed the
statement himself.
   Essawy said Rushdie, who was born to a Moslem family in India
and had previously said he did not consider himself a religious
Moslem, now had ``a clean slate'' with the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems.
   But Abrar dismissed Rushdie's efforts as part of ``propaganda
maneuvers by the British government aimed at bringing Rushdie out
of isolation and making Moslems neglect'' Khomeini's edict.
   Although Essawy said that he and two other prominent Moslem
scholars met with Rushdie, the newspaper claimed ``no British
Moslem leader ... could confirm any such meeting.''
   Iran severed relations with Britain over the Rushdie affair,
accusing the London government of defaming Islam by allowing ``The
Satanic Verses'' to be published.
   Relations were resumed Sept. 27 after British officials conceded
that Rushdie's book offended Moslems and that London had no wish to
offend Islam.
   The resumption of relations came amid efforts by Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of his country's so-called
pragmatists, to build bridges with the West following the June 1989
death of Khomeini.
   The Iranians have not rescinded Khomeini's death sentence on
Rushdie, claiming it is a religious edict that cannot be revoked.
But Rafsanjani and his supporters have indicated they are prepared
to allow the decree to lapse.
   Abrar's editorial reflected the thinking of hard-line radicals
opposed to Rafsanjani's drive to boost relations with the West and
Iran's Arab neighbors, as well as liberalize Iranian society.
   Rafsanjani has largely marginalized the radicals in a power
struggle, but they continue to snipe at him.
   Rushdie said in a telephone hookup with a news conference Monday
that it is up to Iranian leaders whether to withdraw the death
sentence. But he added, ``I feel a lot safer tonight than I felt
yesterday.''
   Many Moslems worldwide object to Rushdie's use of the names of
the Prophet Mohammed's wives for the prostitutes in his novel and
the implication that Mohammed wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book,
instead of receiving it from God.
   Some Moslem leaders in Britain were not satisfied with Rushdie's
concessions, demanding that hardcover editions of ``The Satanic
Verses'' be removed from bookstore shelves.
   Sher Azam of the Council for Mosques in Bradford in northern
England, where the book had been publicly burned, sad:
   ``Until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on.''
