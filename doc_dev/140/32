   Police fired on hundreds of protesters
Sunday who stormed a U.S. government office to demand the United
States ban a novel they consider offensive to Moslems. At least five
people died and 80 were injured, doctors said.
   Police repeatedly fired semi-automatic weapons, rifles and
shotguns at charging protesters who yelled ``American dogs!'' and
hurled rocks and bricks during three hours of fierce clashes.
   The rioting erupted when more than 2,000 fundamentalists tried to
march to the U.S. Information Center to demand the United States ban
``The Satanic Verses,'' an acclaimed novel by Salman Rushdie.
   Pakistan banned the novel on grounds it offends Moslems by
suggesting the prophet Mohammed was fallible. India also banned the
novel.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, where President Bush was spending the
weekend, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. officials
were monitoring the Islamabad situation closely. Fitzwater said the
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, telephoned Bush early
Sunday to tell him of the riot.
   ``God is great!'' protesters screamed as they smashed windows and
started fires after driving off scores of police.
   They tore down the American flag at the center and danced in
delight as it was burned, along with effigies representing the
Indian-born Rushdie and the United States. ``Hang Salman Rushdie,''
one man yelled.
   Three U.S. diplomats and 15 Pakistanis employeed at the center
were in the building at the time but were not hurt, U.S. diplomats
said.
   ``There was a pitched battle going on outside,'' said Kent Obee,
head of the center, which contains a public library and dispenses
information about the United States.
   Doctors at area hospitals, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said at least five people had been killed by police gunfire and 65
protesters shot and wounded.
   They said the injured included Moslem theology students and about
20 police hit by rocks or beaten by the rampaging crowd.
   Police arrested at least 65 protesters, and angry officers were
seen beating and kicking some of those arrested. Hospitals reported
at least 80 injuries.
   Some protesters attacked the nearby American Express travel
agency, smashing windows and starting a fire before police drove
them off.
   Enraged demonstrators also attacked three Western journalists,
including two Associated Press correspondents and an Atlanta
Constitution correspondent. They were not injured.
   Police in blue helmets and armed with bamboo canes and metal
shields initially tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas and
batons, but the mob hurled the tear gas canisters back and
repeatedly charged police.
   Police fired in the air and then began shooting into the crowd as
protesters advanced. Other officers ran to escape the mob.
   Protest leaders said ``The Satanic Verses'' should be banned in
the United States and all other nations.
   ``There are insulting remarks in this book. There are lies in
this book,'' said Mohammad Sadique.
   The novel takes its name from the verses the Prophet Mohammad
removed from Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they were
inspired by Satan.
   The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British
TV personality, both passengers who fall from an airliner blown up
by terrorists en route from India to London.
   They are presumed dead but they survive, or are reborn, and take
on the attributes of the angel Gabriel and Satan.
   Rushdie, who lives in London, denies that his novel attacks the
Islamic religion, which he says has been of central importance to
him all his life. He said it deals with ``migration, metamorphosis,
divided selves, love, death, London and Bombay.''
   He said a disputed passage concerning a prophet living in a
fantastic city of sand which dissolves when water falls upon it,
happens in a dream _ ``the fictional dream of a fictional character
... and one who is losing his mind at that. How much further from
history could one get?''
   The novel was first published in Britain in September.
   Obee said the U.S. Embassy had been informed about the march and
that officials expected protest leaders to present a petition asking
that the United States ban the book. Police had been stationed
around the center for hours before the march.
   Some opposition lawmakers and Moslem leaders said police
overreacted and mishandled the situation.
   ``It was a very brutal attack against a peaceful demonstration,''
they said in a joint statement.
