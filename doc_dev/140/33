FT  08 FEB 93 / Survey of Iran (13): Understanding the problem - Salman
Rushdie

ON February 14, 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a 'fatwa', or religious
decree, that the author of the book Satanic Verses, Mr Salman Rushdie, had
been sentenced to death. The announcement caused a storm of international
protest and continues to bedevil Iran's relations with other countries,
particularly Britain. Mr Javad Larijani, special adviser on foreign affairs
to President Rafsanjani, explained the Iran's attitude to the issue:
'In order to solve this problem you first must really understand it. That is
the key. The Rushdie case has parallels with all the religions in the world.
It is an issue of blasphemy of the prophets.
'In Judaism and Christianity the verdict is much harsher than in Islam. What
Imam Khomeini conveyed is simply what Islam thinks about a man who is guilty
of blasphemy. So why blame Iran when that is how Islam thinks about a
particular case? It is like blaming Jesus Christ for the way in which
Christianity deals with blasphemy. In the 19th century there were cases in
Rome and other places when they burned the man who had blasphemed the
prophet.
'If we understand the heart of this matter, then no politician in London
would ask an Iranian politician to disown the fatwa because it would be like
disowning Islam and the Koran. This is not the sort of condition which
British politicians should put on relations with Iran. It is quite
unreasonable. The only condition put on relations between two countries
should be mutual interest and respect.
'I think in this case perhaps the government in London is being manipulated.
British politicians are wise enough to know all the tricks of politics. I do
not find it easy to see what benefit there is for London by getting into
such a game with Iran. I think they still do not fully understand in the
west what the meaning of a fatwa is.
'Politicians in London should not teach us how to understand Islam, in the
same way as we should not teach them how to understand the Leviathan of
Hobbes. Instead we should get down to business, into those areas of mutual
and converging interests in the economic and political spheres that do exist
between us. Let us capitalise on the areas where we converge, rather than
where we diverge.
'The issue of Salman Rushie is sometimes inflated by circles connected to
Israel. They are very unhappy with relations between the west and Iran. I do
not believe in conspiracy theories, but I cannot ignore that Israel does
have a good apparatus for making some issues known to public opinion. They
are strong at that.
'But, anyhow, it is the perceptions which are so different. The west
considers the case like this: the head of a government is pointing his
finger at a man in a foreign country and saying that this man should be
executed because he wrote a book. If this is the type of picture being
presented then it will be not very tolerable for the west.
'From our side the picture is quite different. We consider him (Rushdie) as
a man who tried to betray Islam, to downgrade Islam and to downgrade the
sentiments of more than a billion Moslems. So we said only what Islam
expects for that man: that he does not deserve to exist. It's like, for
example, you pointing your finger at Hitler when he was alive and saying
that this man should be tried and executed a hundred times. This does not
mean that you are sending paratroops to execute him.
'The main barrier, if we are to have an honest debate of this issue, is
cultural, and the very deep emotion which blocks real understanding. The key
is to understand the case objectively. Perhaps some debates between
intellectuals, writers and thinkers could be very helpful. But this does not
rest only on our shoulders. This should be done from both sides. It is not
right for Britain to put all the blame on Iran.'
