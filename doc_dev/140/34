   Thousands of American Moslems prayed and burned
effigies of Salman Rushdie in front of his publisher's office
Saturday to demand that his book ``Satanic Verses'' be banned in the
United States.
   ``Rushdie will die soon,'' said a sign carried by a small child,
one of at least 3,000 protesters who marched on a street near the
headquarters of Viking Penguin Inc., the book's U.S. publisher.
   ``Salman Rushdie _ die. How much longer will you hide?'' said
another sign, referring to the protection Great Britain has given
the author, who lives in London, following death threats from
Islamic fundamentalists.
   At a smaller rally in Boston, about 40 people paraded in a circle
on the Common carrying signs reading ``Blasphemy Does Not Equal
Freedom of Speech, Respect for All Religions.''
   Events in two other cities gave both sides the opportunity to be
heard.
   Writers gathered on the steps of the main Atlanta library to
denounce the death threats. U.S. Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., invited a
small group of Moslem protesters to the microphone, saying, ``We
have our disagreements, but we respect your freedom.''
   He said later, however, ``The ayatollah and his fanatical
followers can go to hell.''
   On Los Angeles radio station KPFK-FM, William Schallert and other
actors read excerpts from the novel as part of an hourlong program
that also featured authors discussing free speech issues and experts
on Islam explaining why Moslems have condemned the book.
   Moslems from across the country joined the mid-afternoon rally in
Manhattan, and some carried the flags of Iran, Pakistan and
Bangladesh, all Islamic nations. Demonstrators also carried signs
saying, ``Viking Penguin, we gonna fix you up'' and ``Satanic Verses
Equals Literary Terrorism.''
   Police guarded the publisher's front entrance, watching the
protesters as they listened to the chant ``Allah is great!''
blasting through loudspeakers. No arrests were made, police said.
   ``We support Rushdie's death according to the laws of Islam,''
said Mohammed Muwahid, an engineer who works for the city of New
York and was born in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
   ``There's a need to take planned action,'' said Shahid Mahmood, a
Pakistani-born investment broker with Robert W. Baird &amp; Co.
   Mahmood, of Pine Brook, N.J., said American Moslems are planning
a march on Washington D.C. within the next two weeks if Viking
Penguin does not stop publishing and selling Rushdie's book.
   At the Islamic Center of North America in Plainfield, Ind.,
officials said Rushdie's book is an offense on religion in general,
not just Islam.
   Moslems say the book depicts the Islamic prophet Mohammed through
a blasphemous fictional character and names prostitutes after
Mohammed's wives.
   ``It slurs women of virtue that have been used by one billion
people as models of morality, of family organization and kindness,''
said Dawood Zwink, vice president of the Islamic Society of North
America.
   Rushdie has labeled the book as fiction and apologized for the
distress its has caused. But Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini has stood by the $5.2 million bounty offered for Rushdie's
execution.
   President Bush and Western Europe's leaders have condemned the
death threat, and many writers have rallied to support Rushdie's
freedom of expression.
