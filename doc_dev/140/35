   Iran's parliament speaker said Friday
``The Satanic Verses'' had created history's strangest crisis, and
he offered a simple solution: Burn all existing copies of the book
and ban it forever.
   A dispatch from the official Iranian news agency did not say
whether Hashemi Rafsanjani commented on Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's order of Feb. 14 that his followers kill the author,
Salman Rushdie, for blaspheming Islam.
   Unless the novel is destroyed and banned, Rafsanjani said during
Friday prayers at Tehran University, ``it will remain forever a
source of rebellion and it would be impossible that peace would come
between real Moslems and the supporters of this book.''
   He said the solution to ``the strangest and rarest crisis in
history is to issue a strict order to seize all copies in the entire
world and burn them,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   Rushdie, a naturalized citizen of Britain, was born to Moslem
parents in Bombay, India, but has said he no longer practices
religion. The 41-year-old author went into hiding after the Khomeini
pronounced the death sentence and Iranian religious leaders added a
reward of $5.2 million.
   Moslems say a scene in ``The Satanic Verses'' in which
prostitutes take the names of Mohammed's wives, and suggestions that
the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it from
Allah, blaspheme Mohammed and Islam.
   Most nations in the Middle East have banned the book, as have
Asian countries with large Moslem populations. At least 19 people
were killed in riots about it in India and Pakistan.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain on Tuesday because
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government refused to suppress
the novel.
   She and her foreign minister, Sir Geoffrey Howe, said they
realized Rushdie's book offends Moslems but insisted Khomeini's
execution order be revoked and freedom of expression respected.
   The dispute opened a new rift between Iran and the West, to which
more moderate elements in Tehran had looked for trade and assistance
in rebuilding from the eight-year war with Iraq.
   Britain's 11 partners in the European Economic Community, joined
by Canada, Norway and Sweden, recalled their ambassadors from
Tehran. Britain says it will deport nine former Iranian Embassy
employees if they do not leave the country within 10 days.
   Rafsanjani was a leader in openings to the West and has been
considered the Iran's most powerful figure after Khomeini, the
88-year-old revolutionary patriarch.
   He castigated Britain in his speech Friday. They ``didn't have
the guts to say `We also did wrong, we supported (Rushdie), we too
are guilty','' he declared.
   ``Their pride didn't allow them to say the truth. If those who
ignited this flame do not find a suitable solution, who knows where
it will lead?''
   A Tehran radio commentary said outrage over ``The Satanic
Verses'' would not abate and warned of ``retaliatory action'' if
Britain deported the Iranians.
   ``There are currently present in Iran persons who ... are engaged
in spying for Britain and undoubtedly it is Britain who will be the
loser as the result of retaliatory measures,'' the radio said.
   It mentioned British businessmen Roger Cooper, 52, a longtime
resident of Iran jailed in Tehran two years ago on espionage
charges. The radio said Cooper had made ``revelations'' about
undercover activities in Islamic countries ``that can greatly
disgrace Britain.''
   In Turkey, a secular Moslem state, police detained dozens of
demonstrators Friday after protests to denounce Rushdie and his
novel. Protesters chanted ``Down with Europe, America and Israel!''
and ``Death to Salman Rushdie!''
