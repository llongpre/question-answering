   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini expressed his
thanks Monday to Moslems who supported his order that Salman Rushdie
be killed for writing ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iranian television quoted a statement from the 88-year-old
patriarch's office as saying it ``was inundated by waves of
telegrams and letters, and pledges of support and readiness to carry
out the Imam's order, most of them from Islamic scholars and leaders
who organized glorious rallies and protests, all of which were
reported to the Imam.''
   ``The Imam expressed his thanks to all the people for their pure
feelings, which tell of hearts full of faith,'' the statement said.
   Khomeini's thanks coincided with the opening of a four-day
conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, of member nations of the
Organization of Islamic Conference. Iran wants the meeting to take
action about Rushdie and ``The Islamic Verses,'' which Moslems
believe blasphemes Islam.
   According to the television, 190 members of Iran's parliament
sent a letter to the Riyadh conference demanding discussion of the
book and Western support for Rushdie.
   Arab diplomatic sources said Khomeini's death threat had not
found support at the conference.
   He issued the order Feb. 14, directing his followers to hunt down
and kill Rushdie, and Iranian clerics offered a reward of $5.2
million.
   Rushdie went into hiding. He was born in Bombay, India, to Moslem
parents but now is a British citizen and has said he does not
practice religion.
   Moslems say his novel blashphemes Islam in a scene in which
prostitutes are given the names of Mohammed's wives and in its
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it from Allah.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain last week because
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government would not suppress the
book.
   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Monday people
in the African nations of Niger and Zimbabwe support Khomeini's
action. It said Premier Mamane Oumarou of Niger endorsed the
execution order and a Moslem youth group in Zimbabwe had vowed to
bring Rushdie ``to divine justice.''
   The news agency said two Tehran newspapers called for an economic
boycott of Britain and a third recommended breaking relations with
West Germany.
   According to the latest available figures, Iran imported goods
worth $528 million from Britain in 1987 and sold it exports valued
at $321.
   Israel's largest book fair opened Monday in Jerusalem, with
100,000 books from 42 countries on display, and ``The Satanic
Verses'' was the main attraction.
   State radio said branches of the British Council in Israel
removed the Rushdie book from their lending library shelves, but it
quoted council officials as saying it remained available on request.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, whose government briefly
halted imports of the novel, was in London on Monday and said: ``I
expressed to Mrs. Thatcher the view of my government that ... it is
unacceptable for anyone to place a price on the head of a private
citizen for any reason at all, least of all for the expression of a
literary view.''
   President Richard von Weizsaecker of West Germany said Monday
that religious tolerance should be the starting point of a Middle
East peace settlement.
   At a dinner for visiting President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, he
acknowledged that Rushdie's book had offended Moslems, but said hurt
feelings were not grounds for violation of national sovereignty and
legal rights.
   West Germany is Iran's biggest trading partner. Iran imported
$1.3 billion worth of goods from it in 1987 and sold West Germany
exports worth $560 million.
   Bonn has joined the 12-nation European Community in recalling its
envoy from Iran to protest the death sentence, canceled plans for a
Cabinet minister to visit Tehran and suspended more than $1 billion
in credits for Iran.
   Two prominent members of the Swedish Academy, which awards the
Nobel prizes, announced in Stockholm they would boycott the academy
to protest its failure to speak out as a body on Rushdie's behalf.
   Author Kerstin Ekman, one of two women in the 18-member academy,
told Swedish television she was dropping ``all work in the academy,
which means in effect I am leaving it.''
   Lars Gyllensten, a former permanent secretary of the academy,
said he would boycott its regular Thursday meetings but remain on
the administrative committee and Nobel institution.
   Rules of the 200-year-old organization say members are elected
for life and vacate their seats only at death or if they commit a
serious crime.
