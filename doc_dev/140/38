   Egyptian author Naguib Mahfouz on Thursday
urged Moslem countries to condemn Iran's call for the assassination
of Salman Rushdie but proposed a boycott against publishers of
Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses.'' Mahfouz, who last year became
the first Arab to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, summed up his
views on the controversial book in an article in the state-owned
newspaper Al-Ahram.
   Mahfouz said he wrote the article because some of his remarks to
foreign reporters had been misinterpreted. He said he still has not
read Rushdie's book and only recently learned of its contents from
others.
   Iran's leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, sparked a global
uproar last month by offering a reward for the death of Rushdie, 41,
an Indian-born British author, on grounds his book blasphemes Islam.
   Interviewed by The Associated Press on Feb. 18, a few days after
Khomeini's statement, Mahfouz said he considered the Iranian cleric
guilty of terrorism and that his action had damaged the image of
Islam.
   In Thursday's newspaper article, the 77-year-old author said: ``I
believe Khomeini inflicted harm on Islam and Moslems that is not
less, if not more, than what the author of the book intended.
   ``I also have said previously that freedom of opinion should be
sacred and that thought can be rectified only with thought,'' he
said. ``Islam's mission is not terrorism and incitement to murder.''
   Nevertheless, he said he is proposing a three-point plan: the
book's publisher's should be boycotted; Moslem nations should reject
Khomeini's call to violence; and all nations ``should be called upon
to respect religions and sacred beliefs of peoples without prejudice
to the freedom of research based on scientific standards and subject
to discussion.''
   ``I see now that if Rushdie bolted with his imagination, the
Moslems misbehaved by staging demonstrations, burning the book and
calling for murder, thus turning the situation upside down and
making the culprit a victim,'' he said.
   Mahfouz said that if reported accounts of the book's contents
were true, ``then the book is not worthy of discussion and its
authorship, like any action overstepping the bounds of law and
ethics, should be fought in the courts or through deterrent measures
at the international level.''
   Moslems have complained that ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes
their religion by portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as
prostitutes and suggesting that he wrote the Koran, Islam's holy
book, rather than receiving it from God through the angel Gabriel.
   Rushdie contends his book is fictional and not blasphemous. He
has apologized for the distress it caused to Moslems but not for its
substance.
