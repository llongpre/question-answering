   Arab students who helped sponsor a public
reading of ``The Satanic Verses'' say they may not like author
Salman Rushdie, but they want to show that not all Moslems support
Ayatollah Khomeini's death decree against him.
   About 300 people attended Friday night's reading and panel
discussion on the University of Iowa campus. Twenty-five people read
two-minute selections from the book that many Moslems claim
blasphemes their faith.
   Wan Hasni, a member of the Iowa City Islamic Society and a
statistics student, said he and other Muslims attended the session
at the Iowa Memorial Union ``to hear the views, the feelings of
others in the American community have about this book.''
   ``A demonstration is appropriate if we need one. But it would
have served no purpose to disrupt the reading,'' he said.
   Saadi Simawe, a representative of the Arab Students Association
who organized the event, said the reading aimed to demonstrate that
not all Moslems support Khomeini's action.
   ``Fanaticism is always an aspect of insecurity,'' Simawe said.
``I read the Koran, I respect the prophet. I think Islam is a great
religion if taken personally. Once you are going to impose it on
others, it is very dangerous.''
   ``The Koran is not fragile, it is not a (blade) of grass that you
can destroy it by a book. It is a living book,'' said Simawe, a
doctoral student from Iraq studying English and African-American
World Studies.
   Bill Fuhrmeister, director of security at the university, said a
handful of officers stood guard at the reading in case of
disruptions or violence.
   But the only signs of protest were two Islamic Society members
who quietly held large posters defending Iran's order that Rushdie
be killed.
   ``Freedom of speech does not mean you can insult one-fifth of
earth's population,'' said a sign held by Mubarak Al-Ajmi, also a
student at the University of Iowa.
   ``If someone insults your family, you would stand up and do
something about it. Well, what Rushdie has insulted is my religion,
which means more to me than even my family,'' Al-Ajmi said.
   Mahmoud Rizig, president of the Iowa City Islamic Society, said
he urged his group's members to attend the reading and carry protest
signs but not disrupt the event.
   Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem family in
India, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iranian clerics
offered a $5.2 million reward for his death.
   The Writers' Workshop and the International Writing Program at
the university sponsored the reading along with the Arab Students
Association, the General Union of Palestinian Students, the Indian
Students' Association and the Pakistani Students Association.
