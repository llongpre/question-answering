   Coretta Scott King told new HUD Secretary Jack
Kemp on Wednesday he had raised expectations about the Bush
administration's commitment to easing urban problems and now must
deliver.
   Kemp, in his first duties as the new secretary of housing and
urban development, completed a high-visibility tour of Atlanta's
poor black neighborhoods and pledged to work to increase the
availability of afffor low-income people through
both public and private efforts.
   ``You have really raised our hopes and excited people about the
prospects of something happening with housordable housing ing and jobs,''
Mrs. King,
widow of the late civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., told
Kemp.
   ``From what we've heard you say, we think you mean business,''
she said. ``If something happens and there is not the follow
through, you're going to have a lot of disappointed people.''
   Kemp met privately with Mrs. King and her sons, then attended a
meeting with black leaders.
   Kemp, an unsuccessful Republican presidential hopeful who has
sought to broaden the party's appeal to blacks, promised to work to
eliminate discrimination in housing, to support affirmative action
efforts and to encourage more housing for the poor.
   ``I'm commited to a vigorous effort to expand the housing stock,
both public and ot going to solve the problem,'' said Naim
Sheikh, the owner of a shop selling leather goods who called for a
law that would prevent such books from being written again.
   ``There must be some way that governments can approve a
resolution that in future no writer should have a right to write
against any prophet _ Mohammed, Jesus or Moses,'' he said.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought Allah's
revelations to mankind in the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   ``But do I personally agree with the ayatollah? It doesn't
matter,'' said Sheikh, one of the many Moslem Bangladeshis living in
the Brick Lane area.
   ``You can't stop the ayatollah. You can't stop the people who
will do the job ... Anyone who kills Rushdie will become a hero in
the Islamic world.''
   Like Sheikh, most Moslems acknowledged they haven't read the
book. Most learned about it at one of the five mosques located in a
one-square-mile area of this district, from leaflets, or from
television reports.
   ``He insulted our prophet, our religion. From TV we know this,''
said a shopkeeper selling sticky sweets who refused to give his name.
   Even though they haven't read the book, they are sure it insults
their prophet and are quick to say so when the novel is mentioned.
   ``Our older people read it, they say it's wrong, so we believe
them,'' Nassim Khan, a Pakistani Moslem, said as he ate lunch at a
modest tandoori restaurant. ``They've been studying for years and
years and they should know.''
   Maqbool Ali-Kassam, waiting for his takeout tea, boomed from
across the room: ``Anyone who denies the religion of Islam shall be
killed.''
   Ali-Kassam, a taxi cab radio controller who calls himself a
follower of the ayatollah, said he believes Rushdie deliberately
meant to insult Islam.
   Dozens of drivers from his company stayed at the office until
early Wednesday morning, he said, arguing about the book and the
execution order. ``Some said he didn't mean anything about Islam,
others wanted him killed.''
   Many Moslems believe Rushdie, 41, insults Mohammed by portraying
him as a character called Mahound, a prophet of a city called
Jahilia. Mahound was a medieval corruption of the word Mohammed.
   They are especially angered by one sequence in which prostitutes
are given the names of some of Mohammed's nine wives and by the
book's implication that Mohammed, not Allah, may have been the real
author of the Koran.
   Rushdie was born into a Moslem family in Bombay, India, and
educated in Cambridge. He lives in London. His novel has sold more
than 100,000 copies since it was published in Britain in September
to critical acclaim.
   ``Previously Mohammed has been criticized, but not in this naked
way,'' said Abul Khair, a top officer at the Sonali Bank,
Bangladesh's state bank, on Brick Lane. ``It is intolerable for
Moslems.''
   But he doesn't agree with the ayatollah. ``We don't want
violence. Islam is a peaceful religion,'' he said.
   Restaurant manager Asaad Ramjaun, a Mauritian immigrant, said of
Rushdie: ``I think he's the devil himself.''
   ``We understand this is a free society, but I think this is
freedom of abuse,'' he said. ``But since this is a free society _ he
shouldn't be killed. He should be given a chance.''
