   Pro-Iranian captors of three American
educators today threatened to take revenge against Salman Rushdie,
the publishers of his novel ``The Satanic Verses'' and their
supporters for insulting Islam.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine delivered the
threat in a hand-written statement accompanied by an instant
photograph of American hostages Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and
Jesse Turner.
   The group did not directly threaten the hostages, who appeared in
a photograph released with the document to prove its authenticity.
   The Arabic-language statement, delivered to the office of a
Western news agency in Moslem west Beirut, threatened to ``take
revenge against all those who took part in strong and ferocious
campaigns against Islam.''
   In the photograph, shows the three bearded hostages from the
knees up sitting on what appeared to be a bed and looking straight
into the camera.
   Polhill's left arm and hand are noticeably thinner than in a
picture released 14 months earlier, and his left sleeve appears to
have intentionally been hiked up to the elbow to show the arm.
   The document said the revenge would cover ``all institutions and
organizations that insulted in one way or another'' members of
prophet Mohammed's family, meaning Moslems.
   European governments have recalled their ambassadors from Iran to
protest Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's decree last week that Moslems
seek out and kill Rushdie and his publishers because ``The Satanic
Verses'' blasphemes Islam.
   Authors have led demonstrations of outrage at the threat from
Iran's fundamentalist patriarch, who has refused to accept Rushdie's
apology, and President Bush has called the threat an insult to the
civilized world.
   Rushdie, a naturalized Briton who was born a Moslem in India, is
in hiding with his wife in Britain and reportedly under police
guard. Iranian clerics have offered $5.2 million for Rushdie's
murder.
   Steen, Polhill and Turner were kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from the
campus of the American-affiliated Beirut University College, where
they held teaching posts. Steen, 49, of Boston, taught journalism,
while Polhill, 54, of New York, was assistant professor of business
and Turner, 42, of Boise, Idaho, taught mathematics and computer
science.
   The three are among 15 foreigners missing and believed held
hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists. Nine of
the hostages are American, including Associated Press chief Middle
East correspondent Terry Anderson, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985
and is the longest held.
   ``Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine had persistently
sought to find a peaceful settlement to the hostages' issue, in
accordance with its principles and to show its good intentions in
light of international detente,'' the statement said.
   ``But it seems that imperialism and Zionism consider that Moslems
should go back on their beliefs and principles as if this were the
price of living in the shadow of international detente.''
   The Beirut newspaper an-Nahar today said efforts to free foreign
hostages in Lebanon have suffered now that Iran and the 12 European
Economic Community nations are at loggerheads over Iran's death
threat against Rushdie.
   Jihad threatened to strike against American and Israeli interests
for supporting Rushdie and his novel and called on ``Moslems all
over the world to stand against the laws of the jungle so that
advocates of these laws would realize that real human values ... lie
in spiritual religions and not in the jungle's system.''
   It described Rushdie's book and the support it has as ``the worst
type of insult against Islam's sacredness.''
   The book was part of ``serious and wide-ranging programs underway
to strike against Islam because it is the force that fights moral
and humanitarian degeneration,'' the statement claimed.
   Many Moslems say Rushdie's book blasphemes Islam by portraying
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran,
the holy book of Islam, rather than receiving it from God.
   In Beirut, reactions to Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' have
been slow and conflicting. An advisor to the Sunni Moslem grand
mufti rejected Iran's ruling while the highest Shiite Moslem
religious judge advocated the death sentence.
