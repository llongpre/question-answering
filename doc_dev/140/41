   Thousands of Moslems on Saturday fought among
themselves and clashed with police during a march to demand Britain
change its blasphemy laws and allow them to challenge ``The Satanic
Verses'' in court.
   Police said 84 people were arrested and six policemen were
injured during the march, most in street battles in front of the
Houses of Parliament.
   An estimated 20,000 demonstrators waved banners denouncing
author Salman Rushdie and shouted slogans such as ``Rushdie must
die!'' as they began their march in Hyde Park.
   An effigy of Rushdie hanging from gallows was thrust high into
the air. Rushdie, a British author, wrote ``The Satanic Verses,'' a
novel that some say is insulting to Islam.
   Lawmaker Keith Vaz of the opposition Labor Party called on
Rushdie and his publisher, Penguin, to withdraw the novel from
circulation in Britain, home to an estimated 850,000 Moslems.
   Protesters then marched to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's
office at 10 Downing St., where representatives handed in a
petition demanding a change in Britain's ancient blasphemy laws.
   Britain's rarely used blasphemy law makes it illegal only to
insult the Christian state Church of England. Moslems want it
extended to reflect Britain's multi-ethnic society, saying this
would give them legal grounds for opposing ``The Satanic Verses.''
   At their next stop in Parliament Square, thousands of protesters
stood under Big Ben and blocked traffic as fighting broke out among
crowd members. Riot police poured into the area to break up the
clashes and force protesters onto Westminster Bridge, out of the
square.
   A Scotland Yard spokesman said fighting broke out among younger
members of the demonstration ``for reasons best known to
themselves.''
   He said the demonstrators refused to move but then resumed the
march after protest organizers announced over a loudspeaker that
police had assured them the arrested people would be released.
   After the skirmishes the protesters continued their march to
their final destination in south London's Kennington where they
dispersed.
   Rushdie, born to a Moslem family in India, is a British citizen
and has been in hiding in England since Feb. 14, when Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill him.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
associating the prophet Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting
that the Koran, Islam's holy book, was Mohammed's invention, not
the work of God.
   At the start of Saturday's protest, Moslem men sat in circles on
the grass in Hyde Park and punched the air with their fists as they
called for the British government to change the blasphemy law.
   The International Committee For The Defense of Salman Rushdie
and His Publishers issued a statement calling on demonstration
leaders to repudiate Khomeini's death threat. The statement said
the death threat violated international law and contradicted ``the
principle of reverence for life which underlies all religions.''
   The committee agreed with the demonstrators that the blasphemy
law discriminated against Moslems and other non-Christians but said
it should be repealed rather than extended.
   The protest was organized by the British Muslim Action Front and
Moslem leader Abdal Hussain Choudhury.
