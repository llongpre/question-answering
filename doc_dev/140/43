   Britain said Thursday it would not accept new
Iranian offers of negotiations until the Islamic government
renounces violence in the dispute over the novel ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Iran, however, said it was Britain that was making the overtures
and that author Salman Rushdie remains subject to ``divine justice.''
   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe, meanwhile, said he
understood the book was ``deeply offensive'' to Moslems, and that it
also offends Britons by likening their country to Nazi Germany.
   The Foreign Office said it had been contacted Wednesday and
Thursday by the Iranian Foreign Ministry proposing a meeting in
Geneva this week.
   The Iranians, according to a Foreign Office spokesman, said they
wished to discuss a resolution passed Tuesday by the Majlis that
gave Britain a week to back away from its defense of Rushdie.
Otherwise, diplomatic relations would be severed.
   ``We saw no merit to a meeting at this stage,'' said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``They would have to
renounce violence, or the threat of it. That is absolutely
cardinal.''
   That apparently means Britain would expect Iran to renounce the
death sentence pronounced against Rushdie by Iran's spiritual leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini on Feb. 14. Iranian clergymen have
offered bounties up to $5.2 million for Rushdie's death.
   Following the Foreign Office statements, the Iranian news agency
IRNA quoted a Foreign Ministry source as saying Britain proposed
talks and was rebuffed.
   Howe said in an interview on BBC radio that he could empathize
with Moslems feeling offended by book, which he said is ``offensive
in many other ways as well.
   ``We are not upholding the right of freedom to speak because we
like the book, because we agree with the book,'' he said.
   ``The British government, the British people, do not have any
affection for the book. The book is extremely critical, rude about
us. It compares Britain with Hitler's Germany.
   ``So we are not sponsoring the book. What we are sponsoring is
the right of people to speak freely, to publish freely,'' he said.
   Rushdie is also critical in his book of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and her conservative policies.
   Howe plans to meet in Vienna on Monday with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who has indicated a willingness to
mediate.
   Since Khomeini condemned Rushdie, Britain and its 11 European
Economic Community partners have withdrawn their envoys from Tehran
and Iran's top diplomat left London.
   The Soviets' official Tass news agency, in a commentary
Wednesday, acknowledged the concern of Western countries about death
threats but defended Khomeini.
   ``Perhaps Imam Khomeini, the supreme religious authority in Iran,
had no choice proceeding from Koran teachings, other than denouncing
a man who has insulted Islam?'' Tass diplomatic correspondent Vadim
Biryukov wrote.
   ``The denunciation was nothing more, by the way, than the
position of a religious leader,'' he wrote. ``The Iranian government
has not condemned Rushdie to death.''
   A similar line had been taken by Iran's charge d'affaires in
Britain, Mohammad Basti, shortly before Khomeini quashed diplomatic
efforts by reaffirming the death sentence.
   At one point, Iranian President Ali Khamenei had said that
Rushdie might save himself by apologizing, and Iranian diplomats
reacted positively to statements by their British counterparts that
Thatcher's government had no role in publishing ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   The latest overtures from Tehran apparently reflect continuing
divisions within the Iranian government between Shiite Moslem
hard-liners and more moderate elements, who seek warmer ties with
the West.
   Rushdie, a native of India who is now a British citizen, is
reportedly in hiding in Britain with his American wife. The Zurich
weekly Zuri-Woche, quoting sources identified only as ``literary
circles,'' said in its society column that Rushdie has fled to
Switzerland.
   In Cairo, Egypt's Nobel Prize-winning author Naguib Mahfouz, in a
newspaper interview published Thursday, urged Moslem countries to
condemn Iran's death sentence but proposed a boycott of Viking
Penguin, which published ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In Stockholm Thursday, Sweden's Nobel prize-awarding literary
academy defended free speech but did not explicitly support Rushdie.
The academy had been under pressure from literary and other
organizations to take a clear stand for Rushdie.
   Most of its members however have individually expressed strong
indignation at the campaign against Rushdie.
   Moslem demonstrators blocked roads and burned effigies of Rushdie
on Thursday in India's Bengal state, and the United News of India
said 50 people were arrested.
   The book has been banned in Iran, Senegal, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia,
Jordan, Syria, Egypt, South Africa, Brunei, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
Kenya, and 18 people have died in protests in India and Pakistan.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' is blasphemous because it
portrays the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggests
that Mohammed, not God, was the source for the Koran, Islam's holy
book.
   At the United Nations, a Security Council diplomat said the world
body would not stand up for Rushdie for fear of offending Iran and
jeopardizing forthcoming Iran-Iraq peace talks.
