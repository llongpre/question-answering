<TEXT>
   The controversy over author Salman Rushdie's ``Satanic Verses''
has stirred the kind of fiery rhetoric little seen since the days of
religious wars. Here is a sampling:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``The author of the `Satanic Verses' book, and all those involved
in its publication who were aware of its content, are hereby
sentenced to death. Whoever is killed doing this will be regarded as
a martyr and will go directly to heaven.''
   _Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book. It seems to
me that Islamic fundamentalists could do with a little bit of
criticism right now.''
   _Salman Rushdie.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``This wretched man has no choice but to die because he has
confronted a billion Muslims and the Imam.''
   _Iranian President Ali Khamenei.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``I profoundly regret the distress that publication has
occasioned to sincere followers of Islam.''
   _Rushdie.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Even if Salman Rushdie repents and becomes the most pious man
of all time it is incumbent on every Moslem to employ everything
he's got, his life and wealth, to send him to hell.''
   _Khomeini.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``Nobody has the right to incite people to violence.''
   _British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``We should have told the ayatollah that one move towards Rushdie
and we would bomb Tehran out of existence.''
   _British Conservative Party lawmaker Terry Dicks.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``However offensive that book may be, inciting murder and
offering rewards for its perpetration are deeply offensive to the
norm of civilized behavior.''
   _President Bush.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``If I see (Rushdie) I will kill him. Take my name and address.
One day I will kill him.''
   _London property developer Abzul Khan.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``It is regrettable that a foreign government has been able to
hold hostage or most sacred First Amendment principle. Nevertheless,
the safety of our employees and patrons must take precedence.''
   _Leonard Riggio, B. Dalton's chief executive officer in New York,
in pulling the book from his bookstores' shelves.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``To see bookstores caving in like that to demagoguery is
horrifying. For them to be so cowardly is despicable.''

<TEXT>
   ``I think the right honorable Khomeini is making a best seller
out of it.''
   _Sam Weller, owner of the Zion Book Stores in Salt Lake City.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``If (Rushdie) is ever killed for a folly, we must be killed for
the same folly.''
   _Author Norman Mailer.
</TEXT>

   ``The Koran makes it clear _ if someone defames the prophet, then
he must die.''
   _Former pop singer Cat Stevens, now a Muslim known as Yussuf
Islam, in endorsing Khomeini's order.
