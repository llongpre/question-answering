   Salman Rushdie has been in hiding for 10 days under
a death sentence from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, but he has
fulfilled at least one literary commitment: a review of fellow
novelist Philip Roth's autobiography.
   In the review for the weekly Observer newspaper, Rushdie is said
to hint at a feeling of kinship with the American Jewish author,
whose portrayals of his fellow Jews got him into trouble.
   ``In the course of reviewing Roth, who himself had a period when
he was vilified by the Jews, he (Rushdie) says he found Roth was not
just speaking to him but for him,'' Blake Morrison, the literary
editor who commissioned the article, told The Associated Press
Thursday.
   Roth was attacked in the 1960s for his irreverent, painfully
personal descriptions of Jewish life, especially in his novel
``Portnoy's Complaint.''
   Rushdie, born a Moslem in India, has been deemed by Khomeini to
be a blasphemer for what he wrote in his novel, ``The Satanic
Verses'' about the prophet Mohammed and the Koran, the Moslem holy
book.
   The book Rushdie reviewed is ``The Facts,'' an autobiography in
which Roth responds to his Jewish critics.
   ``Mr. Rushdie says this has helped him during his own predicament
when he has been similarly beleaguered,'' Morrison said. ``By
quoting Roth, he gives some indication of his own feelings.''
   But where Roth's fiction stirred debate primarily at the
intellectual level, Rushdie's work has put his life in danger.
   Iran's spiritual leader issued the death call Feb. 14, and
Iranian clerics offered a $5.2 million bounty for the assassin. Most
experts on Iran have advised him to take the threat seriously, and
Rushdie has said he does.
   Rushdie, 4l, reacted with shock and apparent bewilderment last
week when he was telephoned and told of the death sentence. He
dropped out of sight.
   Four days later he issued a terse statement apologizing for any
distress caused to Moslems by the publication of his book. He has
made no public statements since.
   Iran's president, Ali Khamenei, had indicated that an apology
could alleviate the sentence. But Rushdie's words had no apparent
effect. On Wednesday, Khamenei said: ``The arrow has been launched
toward its target. It is now flying toward its aim.''
   Asked to elaborate, a Khamenei aide said the arrow was directed
``toward the heart of this blasphemous bastard, Salman Rushdie. He
must be killed.''
   Rushdie and his American wife, novelist Marianne Wiggins, are at
an undisclosed address, and both have canceled U.S. promotional
tours _ Rushdie to publicize ``The Satanic Verses'' and Ms. Wiggins
to publicize her latest novel, the critically acclaimed ``John
Dollar.''
   Morrison said the review in The Observer would appear Sunday, a
week later than originally planned.
   He said Rushdie telephoned him on the day he went into hiding and
assured him he would write the review. He phoned again this week to
make sure it had arrived in the mail.
   Morrison said Rushdie asked that their conversation about his
ordeal not be publicized, and Morrison declined to say anything that
might hint at the novelist's whereabouts.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' is sacrilegious because
it casts doubt on central tenets of the Islamic faith. The book, for
example, portrays the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggests he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather than
receiving it from God.
   In other developments Thursday:
   _ Former pop singer Cat Stevens, who gave up a successful music
career in 1977 after becoming a Moslem, endorsed Khomeini's order.
Stevens, who has changed his name to Yussuf Islam and is a teacher
in London, told Moslem students: ``The Koran makes it clear _ if
someone defames the prophet, then he must die.''
   _ Police in Canada said they received a bomb threat against the
Iranian Embassy in Ottawa.
   _ Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which holds
Americans Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner in Beirut,
released a statement threatening to avenge the action by Rushdie,
the book publishers and their supporters. The group released a
photograph of the three but did not make specific threats.
   _ A West German government spokesman, Dieter Vogel, said its
credit talks with Iran will not resume until the death threat is
withdrawn.
   _ In the Netherlands, Dutch police have taken precautions to
protect Veen, the publishers of the Dutch translation.
   _ Publishers WSOY in Finland and Christian Bourgois in France
announced they had changed their stances and would publish the
Finnish and French translations.
