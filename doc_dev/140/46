   One year after he was driven into hiding by an
Islamic death sentence, Salman Rushdie has begun to fight back.
   With a long interview and an essay in a Sunday newspaper, plus a
lecture written from hiding, the 42-year-old author is mounting a
vigorous, unapologetic defense of ``The Satanic Verses'' and shows
no inclination to bow to pressure to back down.
   That pressure is manifesting itself in a heated debate about
whether ``The Satanic Verses'' should be published in paperback.
Yes, says Rushdie. No, say those who fear it will lead to Moslem
unrest.
   The opponents include lawmakers, writers and relatives of
British hostages in Lebanon. Free speech has its limits, they say,
and a paperback edition would only worsen a conflict that has
already damaged Anglo-Moslem relations and led to deadly rioting.
   Some of Rushdie's supporters worry that the furor that greeted
the death sentence imposed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran
last Feb. 14 is dissipating.
   ``There has been this gradual shift ... into considering Rushdie
as a criminal, from someone to be supported, here's someone who
caused disquiet, unrest,'' said Frances D'Souza, head of the
International Committee for the Defense of Salman Rushdie and his
Publishers.
   The issue has domestic political implications too. The
opposition Labor Party, which Rushdie always supported, is torn
between the principle of free speech and the fear of losing Moslem
votes.
   Rushdie acknowledges his book has caused pain but appeals to
moderate Moslems to reconsider their campaign. The Bombay-born
Briton says he renounced Islam in his youth, and therefore cannot
be accused of blasphemy or reneging on his faith.
   If the uproar represents the conflict between Islamic
fundamentalism and Western libertarianism, Rushdie is firmly on the
side of the West.
   His lecture at the Institute of Contemporary Art, delivered by
playwright Harold Pinter and attended by a host of literary
heavyweights, cited an array of writers through the ages to defend
free speech and decry religious absolutism.
   ``The True Believer knows that he is simply right, and you are
wrong. He will seek to convert you, even by force (or)... despise
you for your unbelief,'' he wrote.
   Within days of the publication of ``The Satanic Verses'' in
September 1988, Moslems were claiming it insulted the Prophet
Mohammed by associating him with prostitutes, and the Koran, their
holy book, by suggesting it was man's work, not Allah's.
   The worldwide protests and book-burnings, and the deadly riots
in Pakistan and India, culminated in Iran promising a
multimillion-dollar reward for anyone who killed Rushdie. Khomeini
died in June, but the edict stands.
   Rushdie was at his north London home last Valentine's Day, when
the British Broadcasting Corp. told him of Khomeini's edict. The
same day, Rushdie dropped out of sight with his wife, American
novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   Since then he has been under round-the-clock armed guard at a
series of houses operated by Special Branch security police and
MI5, the domestic intelligence agency.
   Ms. Wiggins moved out in August. She denies there were marital
difficulties. Rushdie confined himself to publishing occasional
book reviews but stayed out of the debate on his book, saying he
felt his silence would be more eloquent.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English, almost three-quarters of those in the United States, and
has been on the Sunday Times of London bestseller list for 49 weeks.
   It has been translated into 15 other languages and been banned
in more than 20 countries.
   Writers and commentators initially rallied to Rushdie's defense,
with 2,500 worldwide signing a petition.
   But in recent weeks, spy writer John le Carre and liberal
political columnist Hugo Young have openly pressed Rushdie to
abandon the paperback edition.
   Rushdie maintains the paperback is essential if his book is to
last for posterity.
   Without a paperback, ``in a few years the book simply won't be
there for anyone who wants to read it,'' he told The Independent on
Sunday. ``It will, in all practical terms, have been suppressed.''
   But writing in the left-leaning Guardian newspaper, le Carre
said, ``Nobody has a God-given right to insult a great religion and
be published with impunity.''
   Young, a Guardian columnist, urged Rushdie to renounce the
paperback ``on the deeply considered grounds that it could do more
harm than good.''
   Relatives of British hostages issued a statement saying
paperback publication would be ``misconceived and irresponsible''
and could make conditions worse for the captives, believed held by
Moslem extremists.
   Viking Penguin says ``no firm date'' has been set for paperback
publication. The publishers have reason to be evasive. Khomeini's
death sentence extended to them too, and they have received 35,000
abusive or threatening letters and 45 bomb threats in Britain and
the United States, says spokesman Bob Gregory.
   The company's British headquarters have been evacuated six
times, and five incendiary devices have been found in its stores,
two of which exploded. Worldwide security measures cost $3.4
million a year, Gregory said.
   In a 7,000-word essay for The Independent on Sunday, Rushdie
touched on his lonely existence and the shock of being condemned by
Moslems for what he thought was a sympathetic account of their
plight as immigrants in the West.
   ``Do I feel regret? Of course I do: regret that such offense has
been taken against my work when it was not intended ...,'' Rushdie
wrote.
   ``Would I have written it differently If I had known what would
happen? Truthfully, I don't know. Would I change any of the text
now? I would not. It's too late.''
