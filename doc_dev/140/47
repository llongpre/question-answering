   More than 50,000 Moslems left mosques
and marched throughout the capital Friday before gathering at the
government's headquarters to demand the death of author Salman
Rushdie.
   Also Friday about 3,000 Moslem fundamentalists in Sudan, some
shouting ``Down, down with Britain!'' demanded that Sudan break
relations with the British government which has defended publication
of Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In Malaysia, the government banned the March 13 issue of Newsweek
magazine and the March 9 issues of the Hong Kong-based Far Eastern
Economic Review for printing extracts from the book.
   Many Moslems find the book blasphemous because it suggests the
prophet Mohammed wrote the Koran instead of receiving it from God
and because its characters include prostitutes who take the names of
Mohammed's wives.
   Several countries including Bangladesh and Malaysia have banned
the book, and Iran has offered $5.2 million to any Moslem who kills
Rushdie, an Indian-born Briton of Moslem upbringing.
   Marchers in Dhaka chanted ``We will kill Rushdie'' and gathered
near the Secretariat, the headquarters of the government. Several
hundred policemen in riot gear followed the marchers but there was
no violence.
   More than 15,000 followers of Jamaat-e-Islami, a fundamentalist
Moslem party, held another rally in front of the city's main mosque
and religious leaders accused Zionists of ``conspiring against Islam
and its prophet Mohammed.''
   Seven of the country's top religious leaders have called for a
nationwide general strike on Tuesday to protest the book.
   A youth organization has set up a 15-member death squad to kill
Rushdie if he comes to Bangladesh. The group is led by Farooq Ahmed,
who said the squad had no plans to go to London to kill Rushdie, who
is in hiding somewhere in Britain.
   The demonstrators in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, urged the
government to break relations with Britain and boycott all its goods.
   The protest, led by the fundamenalist National Islamic Front, is
seen as the party's first sign of opposition to Prime Minister Sadek
Mahdi.
   Mahdi is in the process of forming a new broad-based government
that would start talks with Sudan's southern rebels to end the
6-year-old civil war.
   The National Islamic Front has said it will not join the new
government because negotiations and a peace treaty with the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army would mean a suspension of the
Islamic Sharia law.
   Malaysia's deputy home affairs minister, Megat Junid Megat Ayub,
told reporters the Newsweek and Far Eastern Economic Review issues
were banned because the contents would have a deterimental effect on
Moslems, whose faith is the official religion.
   The Malaysian Home Affairs Ministry must receive a copy of all
incoming foreign publications including newspapers. Sometimes
articles or parts of articles are blackened out and occasionally the
entire issue is banned.
