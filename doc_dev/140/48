<HEAD>Author of Banned Book Sends Critical Letter To Gandhi</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A novelist whose latest book was banned
in India accused the government of bowing to religious
fundamentalists and denounced the ban in an angry letter to Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi.
   Indian newspapers on Thursday published Salman Rushdie's letter,
which urged a lifting of the ban on ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie, 41, is a British citizen of Indian descent and lives in
London. He won the Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious
literary award, for his first book, ``Midnight's Children,'' a
broad satire on post-independence India.
   ``Satanic Verses'' has also been nominated for the Booker Prize,
which is announced Oct. 25. Rushdie's second novel, ``Shame,''
earned wide acclaim.
   ``Satanic Verses'' was banned Oct. 5 after complaints from
Moslem members of Parliament. They said they feared Moslem
militants might use the book to incite communal riots.
   The book is sharply critical of religious fundamentalism and
makes veiled references of the prophet Mohammed and the Koran, the
sacred book of Moslems.
   The complicated story, which mixes elements of realism and
fantasy, focuses on two Indian characters. The benevolent one acts
as a messenger for Mohammed, the founder of the Islamic religion.
The other is satanic and manipulative.
   In the letter carried on the front pages of major Indian daily
newspapers, Rushdie accused Gandhi of denying the right to free
expression at the behest of religious fundamentalists.
   ``The right to freedom of expression is at the very foundation
of any democratic society, and at present, all over the world,
Indian democracy is becoming something of a laughingstock,''
Rushdie wrote.
   ``When ... self-appointed guardians of Muslim sensibilities say
that no civilized society should permit the publication of a book
like mine, they have got things backwards. The question raised by
the book's banning is precisely whether India, by behaving in this
somewhat South African fashion, can any more lay claim to the title
of civilized society,'' the author said.
   The prime minister was touring northern India on Thursday and
his office had no comment on Rushdie's letter.
   The ban has been widely criticized in India and abroad. Indian
newspapers have been particularly outspoken.
   The conservative daily, The Hindu, criticized the ban as a
``Philistine decision'' while the anti-government Indian Express
called it ``thought control.''
   Under the ban, the Ministry of Finance barred importation of the
book or sale of it. There was no hearing before the decision was
made.
   In an interview published Thursday in The New York Times,
Rushdie said, ``The idea that the Minister of Finance should decide
what books should be read and not be read is not acceptable in a
free country.''
   ``It seems to me that the government has grown very week in
India while the power of religious extremists seems to have grown
very strong,'' he was quoted as saying. ``The book is not the
issue. This is an attempt to manipulate the government.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' was published Sept. 22 in Britain and is
scheduled to be published in the United States in February.
   Six people, including playwright Tom Stoppard and novelist
Kingsley Amis, signed a telegram to Gandhi protesting the ban.
   The protest telegram, which was sent last week, said: ``We
consider that the banning of a serious work of literature
represents a very grave threat to freedom of expression in your
country, and strongly urge you to ensure that the ban is lifted.''
   The other signers were poet Stephen Spender; Philip Spender and
Sally Laird, the director and editor, respectively, of Index on
Censorship, a British-based journal on free speech issues; and
Kevin Boyle, director of Article 19, a second anti-censorship
organization.
