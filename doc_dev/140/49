   A leading writer on Islamic militancy said
Thursday that the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order to
assassinate Salman Rushdie, author of the novel ``Satanic Verses,''
had nothing to do with revulsion over the contents of the book.
   Robin Wright, herself once the target of a Mideast death threat,
said that Khomeini, seizing upon the growing fury among Sunni and
Shiite Moslems over the book, issued the edict against Rushdie in a
bid to gain the leadership of the entire Islamic world.
   Ms. Wright, author ``Sacred Rage: the Wrath of Militant Islam,''
and the upcoming ``In the Name of God: Khomeini's Revolutionary
Decade,'' said Khomeini also was using the issue to divert
attention from domestic problems, just as he created the U.S.
hostage crisis in 1979 to mobilize public support for his troubled
regime.
   But ``I suspect that Khomeini is in a minority'' among Iranian
clerics and political leaders on the issue of Rushdie, she said,
noting the assassination order ``has erased most of the diplomatic
gains made by Iran since the end of the war with Iraq.'' She
predicted history will view the episode as ``a tragic spasm.''
   Ms. Wright, a national security reporter for The Los Angeles
Times, was among participants in a seminar on the Rushdie affair at
the annual convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
Others included author Larry McMurtry; Ed Murrow, president of the
American Booksellers Association, and Andy Ross, whose Berkeley,
Calif., bookstore, Cody's, was bombed in February after it began
selling ``Satanic Verses.''
   Ross described in wrenching terms the anguish he and his 55
employees went through in arriving at their joint decision to
resume sales of the book after a Molotov cocktail damaged the
store, but caused no injuries, in the early hours of Feb. 28.
``It's quite possible my store has the dubious honor of being the
first victim of international terrorism in the United States,'' he
said.
   Ross said ``the bombing accomplished its goal, which was to
create an atmosphere of terror, and to let the world know that
under the new order of things, the sale of prescribed ideas could
be conducted only at great personal risk.''
   ``I can tell you that the decision to carry the `Verses' (after
the bombing) was perhaps the most difficult decision of my life,''
he said. ``If people were murdered, who is to say if such an act
(selling the book) was courageous or foolhardy?''
   Ross expressed some bitterness over criticism within the
literary community of bookstores that withdrew the book from their
shelves. ``I personally thought it was unbecoming for Norman Mailer
and others to expound from the safety of their coop apartments what
was correct moral behavior for bookstores in the front lines,
stores on the street vulnerable to terrorist activity 24 hours a
day,'' he said.
   He also said that the ``role of the media was a source of
paradox. The level of coverage was an element that only inflamed
the fanatics. The more you exericized your freedom of expression in
reporting the story, the greater the likelihood that my freedom of
expression would be abridged by terror.''
   Ms. Wright, once threatened with death for reporting an
attempted coup against Syrian leader Hafez Assad, said she did not
doubt that Khomeini was ``genuinely outraged by the comic and
almost pornographic approach to Islam taken in `Satanic Verses.'''
   But she noted the assassination order, coupled with a $5.2
million bounty offer, was not issued until mid-February, five
months after publication.
   Rushdie, born in India of Moslem parents, and his American wife,
author Mary Wiggins, went into hiding, presumably in England,
shortly after Khomeini's order.
   The book includes a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the
names of the prophet Mohammed's wives, and it suggest Mohammed
wrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.
   Ms. Wright noted that Islam ``is not the only religion to
condemn those who engage in blasphemy.'' She cited a passage from
the book of Leviticus in the Old Testament: ``He that blasphemes
the name of the Lord ... shall surely be put to death, and all the
congregation shall certainly stone him.''
   McMurtry, author of ``Lonesome Dove'' and other best-sellers,
said that ``tyrants, whether secular or religious, have exhibited
far more respect for language than have democratic governments.
Tyrants demonstrate that respect by sending their most able and
threatening servants, the best writers, to the stake, the block or
the gulag.''
   He complained that the response of Western governments to
Khomeini's order, ``insofar as they've responded at all, has been a
light noise, sounds without significance or without force. In time,
virtually all communications will be weakened without unfettered
freedom to express ourselves as we need to.''
   But Ross said ``I was not exceedingly disturbed by the almost
insultingly bland statements by public officials, including
President Bush, because they at least had the value of not inciting
additional violence.''
