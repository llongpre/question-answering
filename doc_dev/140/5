   Salman Rushdie said Monday that he has embraced
Islam and has given up his push for paperback publication of ``The
Satanic Verses,'' the book which brought him a death sentence from
Iran nearly two years ago.
   He also pledged, in a statement released by a local Islamic
leader, that he would permit no further translations of the book.
   However, Rushdie defended his book as a ``moral fable'' about a
character who ``has lost his mind because he has lost his faith.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since February
1989, when Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini sentenced him
to death for blasphemy.
   Iran offered a $1 million bounty for Rushdie's death, and
Iranian authorities reconfirmed the death sentence and the bounty
earlier this month.
   Rushdie's statement was released by Dr. Hesham el-Essawy,
president of the Islamic Society for the Promotion of Religious
Tolerance. He said Rushdie typed the statement himself following a
meeting with Islamic scholars.
   In his statement, the author declared that he did ``not agree
with any statement in my novel `The Satanic Verses' uttered by any
of the characters who insults the prophet Mohammed, or casts
aspersions upon Islam, or upon the authenticity of the holy Koran,
or who rejects the divinity of Allah.''
   Rushdie said in a telephone hookup with a news conference that
it is up to Iranian leaders whether to withdraw the death sentence.
But he added, ``I feel a lot safer tonight than I felt yesterday.''
   Many Moslems worldwide objected to Rushdie's use of the names of
the Prophet Mohammed's wives for the prostitutes in his novel and
the implication that Mohammed wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book,
instead of receiving it from God.
   El-Essawy said Rushdie now had a ``clean slate'' with the Moslem
world because he had only now professed his belief that ``there is
no God but Allah and that Mohammed is his last prophet.''
   In addition to el-Essawy, Rushdie met with two imams from the
Regent's Park Mosque - Dr. Zaki Badawi, principal of the Moslem
College in Britain and Dr. Hohammed Ali Mahgoub, Egypt's secretary
of state for endowment and head of the Supreme Council for Islamic
Affairs, as well as Yousef el-Sharkawy, second secretary at the
Egyptian Embassy.
   Rushdie's statement was welcomed by other Moslem leaders, who
nonetheless demanded that the book be withdrawn entirely from
circulation.
   ``Until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on,''
said Sher Azam of the Council for Mosques in Bradford, where the
book had been publicly burned.
   Iqbal Sacranie, joint convener of the United Kingdom Committee
on Islamic Affairs, said Rushdie's statement was a positive step,
but also called for ``the withdrawal from circulation of this
blasphemous book.''
   El-Essawy argued that Rushdie could not be sentenced to death as
an apostate because he had not been a believing Moslem when he
wrote the novel.
   He characterized Rushdie as a ``convert,'' and quoted the author
as saying, ``There is no difference between Rushdie and Islam.''
   ``This is the community that is close to my heart,'' Rushdie
told the news conference. ``To come closer to it has given me a
great deal of joy.''
   He said he would not permit any further translations of the book
``while any risk of further offense exists,'' and added that he
would ``continue to work for a better understanding of Islam in the
world, as I have always attempted to do in the past.''
   No one was available for comment Monday at Viking Penguin,
publishers the hardback book. However, the publisher had previously
shown no enthusiasm for a paperback, a position that had drawn
criticism from Rushdie.
   If there was no paperback, he said in an interview in January
with the Independent on Sunday newspaper, ``in a few years the book
simply won't be there for anyone who wants to read it. It will, in
all practical terms, have been suppressed.''
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 1 million copies in
English - almost three-quarters of those in the United States - and
was on the Sunday Times of London's best-seller list for nearly a
year. It has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more
than 20 countries.
   Rushdie, born in Bombay, India, and now a naturalized British
citizen, has been in hiding since Feb. 14, 1989. His native country
was the first to ban the book, in October 1988.
   In September 1989, a trade survey found booksellers in England
divided on the question of stocking any paperback edition. Forty
percent said they would not handle it, 44 percent said they would,
according to Publishing News.
