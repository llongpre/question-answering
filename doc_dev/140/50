   An Iranian envoy has been dispatched to
encourage other Moslem nations to support Iran's position on the
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' at a conference this week, according to
news reports Saturday.
   In England, home of the novel's author, Salman Rushdie, Moslems
staged demonstrations in two cities.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency reported that
Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani said during an audience with
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini the controversy over the book was
helping export the Islamic revolution.
   Khomeini did not speak during the meeting at a mosque in a Tehran
suburb, said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   IRNA said Ayatollah Ahmed Jannati, a special envoy, was touring
Moslem states in the region to try to forge a united front on the
issue at the Organization of Islamic Conference meeting scheduled to
begin Monday in Saudi Arabia.
   Pakistani Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan said in a meeting
with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, that he hoped the
OIC ``will take a decisive stand to condemn the book,'' IRNA
reported.
   Observers expect a showdown between the majority Sunni and the
minority Shiite Moslems over the issue.
   There are 100 million Shiites among the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems. More than half the Shiites live in Iran, which has
called on Moslems to kill Rushdie.
   Many Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting Mohammed wrote the Koran rather than receiving it from
God.
   Most nations in the Middle East have banned the book, as have
Asian countries with large Moslem populations.
   At least 19 people have been killed in India and Pakistan in
riots over the novel.
   Rushdie, a naturalized British citizen born to a Moslem family in
India, went into hiding after Khomeini issued his death threat last
month and Iranian religious leaders put a $5.2 million bounty on his
head.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain on March 7 over its
refusal to suppress the novel.
   On Saturday, 2,000 Moslems marched five miles through the town of
Slough west of London and burned an effigy of Rushdie.
   Dozens of police officers escorted the marchers and lines of
officers stood guard outside bookshops. Police said the march was
peaceful and there were no arrests.
   Busloads of protesters from around the English Midlands converged
on the central England town of Leicester, and about 5,000 marched
three miles through the city center.
   Police stopped the protesters from burning an effigy of Rushdie.
No one was arrested.
