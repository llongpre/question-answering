<HEAD>Iran To Boycott Film Festival Over Christ Film</HEAD>

   Iran said Monday it will boycott the
Istanbul film festival in Turkey because ``The Last Temptation of
Christ,'' a film considered blasphemous by many Christians, is to
be shown, Tehran radio reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted a statement by the
Culture and Information Ministry's film division as saying, ``The
showing of this film, especially in a Moslem country, is an insult
to ... all those who believe in God, and is playing into the hands
of global arrogance (the United States), which fears the role of
religion in awakening the oppressed countries.''
   The film by American director Martin Scorsese was adapted from a
novel. Many U.S. and West European Christians condemned it for a
dream sequence in which Jesus descends from the cross, seduces Mary
Magdalene and raises a family.
   Moslems consider Jesus a prophet.
   Monday's development follows a major diplomatic confrontation
with the West over the novel ``The Satanic Verses'' by British
novelist Salman Rushdie.
   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini condemned the book as
blasphemous for its treatment of the prophet Mohammed and sentenced
Rushdie to death.
   Iran also is in a diplomatic spat with Turkey for banning
Islamic dress for women on Turkish university campuses.
