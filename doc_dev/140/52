   Iran demanded Tuesday that Moslems
uphold its order to kill Salman Rushdie as a blasphemer for writing
``The Satanic Verses'' and said they must condemn all who take the
writer's side.
   It made the demand at a meeting in Riyadh of foreign ministers
from the 46-member of the Organization of Islamic Conference, where
little support for Iran's extreme position has been evident.
   Although the Iranians succeeded in getting the Rushdie affair on
the agenda of the closed, four-day conference, it was referred to
political committee and some delegates said it should be considered
only as a cultural topic.
   Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, is not attending the
meeting, which began Monday. The chief Iranian delegate, Mohammmad
Ali Taskhiri, conveyed his government's demands to The Associated
Press:
   ``All delegations will issue a strong resolution in denunciation
of Rushdie, his book and publisher along with all the governments
that support him. We expect all Moslems to uphold God's judgment in
this connection.''
   His second point referred to the fatwa, or religious execution
decree, issued Feb. 14 by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the
88-year-old Shiite Moslem patriarch of Iran.
   Rushdie's novel was published in 1988. Earlier this year, it
caused riots in India and Pakistan in which 19 people were killed.
Most Islamic nations and others with large Moslem populations have
banned it.
   Indonesia and Singapore joined the list Tuesday and the religious
affairs minister of Turkey, a predominantly Moslem secular state,
said the book should be banned there.
   Rusdie, 41, was born in Bombay, India, to Moslem parents but now
is a British citizen and has said he no longer practices religion.
He went into hiding after Khomeini ordered him killed and Iran's
Islamic clerics offered a reward of $5.2 million.
   Britain's partners in the 12-nation European Economic Community
recalled their ambassadors to Iran after the death sentence, along
with Norway, Sweden and Canada. Iran broke relations with Britain on
March 7 because it refused to suppress the book and act against
Rushdie.
   In calling his novel blasphemous, Moslems cite a scene in which
prostitutes are given the names of Mohammed's wives, and a
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it from Allah.
   Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, took issue
with Taskhiri and noted the delegates had not reached a consensus on
the book.
   ``Four delegates addressed the conference on the Rushdie affair
during the morning session and I heard none of them say anything
about upholding the death sentence,'' he told a news conference.
   He said the Organization of Islamic Conference believes Islam
``is not an easy prey for those bent on harming it, and I don't
believe the faith is in any danger. We are not afraid of any attacks
that may come from books or any media organ.''
   Taskhiri, who heads the Islamic affairs division of the Iranian
Foreign Ministry, said Rushdie's book was ``a rabid campaign against
our Islamic ideals and beliefs ... a crushing onslaught on Islam
requiring a strong and decisive response.''
   Speaking for Saudi Arabia, Saud said: ``We are waiting to hear
the statements of the delegates.'' He said the Saudies were in touch
with several countries to prevent the matter from ``damaging
prospects of religious tolerance.''
   King Fahd's government has banned ``The Satanic Verses'' but has
not supported the Iranian demand that Rushdie be killed.
   A group of Islamic theologians meeting in Mecca, Saudi Arabia,
the holiest shrine of Islam, issued a declaration Tuesday that
Islamic law allows Rushdie the opportunity to repent.
   Other issues on the conference agenda include the Palestinian
problem and ways of regaining occupied territory from Israel.
   A subcommittee of Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan,
Algeria and Tunisia was appointed to consider those issues, Saud
told reporters. Egypt is the only Arab nation to have signed a peace
treaty with Isrel.
   About Afghanistn, he said Moslem guerrillas have ``received the
support of the OIC since the beginning of their struggle'' against
Soviet military forces and the Islamic organization ``will continue
to support them.''
   Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan was completed Feb. 15 and the
guerrillas are trying to oust the communist government in Kabul.
