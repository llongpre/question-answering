   Iran's new supreme leader, Ali Khamenei,
on Thursday urged Moslems to demonstrate and defy Saudi Arabia's ban
on political activity during the annual pilgrimage to the holy
cities of Mecca and Medina.
   This is the second year Iranians have stayed away from the
pilgrimage in protest of a Saudi limit on participants.
   But pilgrims from other nations should protest all
``conspiracies'' facing Islam, especially Salman Rushdie's novel
``The Satanic Verses,'' said Khamenei, who was chosen on June 4 to
lead Iran after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   His 18-page message was carried by Iran's state radio and the
official Islamic Republic News Agency, both monitored in Nicosia.
   An estimated 1.8 million pilgrims from 80 countries are making
the annual pilgrimage, or hajj, to Mecca, the birthplace of the
prophet Mohammed. Pilgrims also travel to Medina to visit the tomb
of the 7th century founder of Islam.
   Last year, Saudi Arabia began limiting the number of pilgrims
based on a country's population. At that time, Iran was allowed
45,000 people, or one-third the number it planned to send.
   The pilgrimage season has been marred by disturbances since
Iran's Islamic revolution in 1979. In that year, religious
extremists seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca and held it for two
weeks before Saudi forces stormed it.
   More than 250 people were killed, including 100 of the
extremists. Saudi authorities later beheaded 63 more.
   The Saudis arrested scores of Iranian Revolutionary guards posing
as pilgrims in 1986 when they tried to smuggle in weapons and
explosives.
   The next year, 402 pilgrims, mostly Iranians, were killed in
riots in Mecca that the Saudis say were instigated by
fundamentalists.
   Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef said Wednesday that if ``the
rulers of Iran are still bent on offending the hajjis, we reject and
will resist this. We will not allow anyone to undermine the safety
of the hajjis or the homeland.''
   Saudi Arabia cut ties with Iran in April 1988. Tehran since has
been campaigning to strip King Fahd of his title as ``custodian of
the two holy shrines'' and place Mecca and Medina under
international supervision.
   Khamenei told Iranians: ``The hand of the enemy has again
deprived you of your certain right to make pilgrimage to the house
of God and the grave of the prophet.''
   He said the Saudi limit on pilgrims has ``added another dark page
to its black file. Our memory of history will not forget these
hostilities.''
   Khamenei urged pilgrims to ``gather in large numbers to express
their opposition and hatred toward the cultural conspiracies of the
arrogant against Islam.''
   He said Khomeini's death sentence against Rushdie ``still
stands'' and applies to ``any one else who insults Islam.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Feb. 13, when
Khomeini accused him of blaspheming Islam in ``The Satanic Verses''
and ordered his death.
   Khamenei also suggested pilgrims debate the Palestinian uprising
against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and
the civil wars in Lebanon and Afghanistan.
