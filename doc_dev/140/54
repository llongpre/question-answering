   A senior Iranian cleric today offered up to $2.6
million for the slaying of Salman Rushdie, whose novel ``The Satanic
Verses'' has angered Moslem fundamentalists. Newspapers said the
writer was under armed guard.
   A representative of Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
said any Iranian who kills Rushdie will receive a reward of 200
million rials, or $2.6 million, for bringing ``this mercenary of
arrogance to his punishment,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency said
in a report from Tehran.
   The representative, Hojatoleslam Hassan Saneie, who heads the
Islamic charitable foundation 15th Khortad, said the group would pay
a foreigner $1 million for killing the 41-year-old author.
   Demonstrators in the Iranian capital broke windows at the British
Embassy, a diplomat there said. He said no embassy employees were
injured. About 2,000 people took part in the protest, expressing
support for Khomeini's decree and anger over the book.
   IRNA, in a report monitored in Cyprus, said the Revolutionary
Guards Corps today expressed their ``readiness to carry out the
Imam's (Khomeini's) decree.''
   Khomeini, leader of Iran's Islamic revolution, said Tuesday that
Rushdie's novel is so offensive to Islam that he had ordered the
author and the novel's publishers put to death.
   A senior British diplomat, reached at the embassy by telephone
from Cyprus, said today the ``noisy'' demonstrators paraded outside
the walled compound for three hours before dispersing. ``Local
authorities provided effective protection,'' said the diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said the demonstrators hurled stones at the building, breaking
some windows. He said all seven British employees were inside the
embassy at the time, and that none of them was hurt.
   Tehran Radio reported that Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
told diplomats in Tehran his government will order the closure of
cultural centers belonging to nations that permit publication of the
book.
   In London, police would not confirm a report in The Times of
London that Rushdie was under armed police guard. Scotland Yard said
it was police policy not to comment on matters of personal security.
   It is rare for British police to guard private citizens.
   A spokeswoman for Viking, publisher of the novel, said today it
could not confirm or deny that Rushdie, a London resident who was
born into a Moslem family in India, was under guard.
   Rushdie's agent, Gillon Aitken, said a decision would be made
soon on whether the author should go ahead with a promotional and
lecture tour of the United States. The tour had been scheduled to
begin Friday.
   In Pakistan, fundamentalist and opposition leaders called for a
peaceful ``day of mourning'' Friday to protest the book.
   Six people were killed and 82 injured when police opened fire
Sunday on demonstrators who stormed a U.S. cultural center in
Islamabad to demand the novel be banned in the United States, where
it recently went on sale. One person was killed in a similar protest
Monday in northern India.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' has sold more than 100,000 copies since it
was published in Britain in September to critical acclaim.
   At least five countries have formally banned the novel _ India,
Pakistan, Bangladesh, Egypt and South Africa.
   Khomeini's threat emerged in a Tehran Radio broadcast that quoted
him as saying Rushdie and his publishers ``are hereby sentenced to
death.''
   ``I call on all zealous Moslems to execute them quickly, wherever
they find them, so that no one will dare to insult Islamic
sanctity,'' it quoted Khomeini as saying of the Bombay-born and
Cambridge-educated novelist.
   The Foreign Office on Tuesday expressed ``grave concern'' about
Khomeini's reported remarks. Rushdie said he was taking them ``very
seriously indeed.''
   The Daily Mail printed a picture that it said showed Rushdie and
his wife Marianne in London on Tuesday, but they could not be
contacted at home.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought Allah's
revelations to mankind in the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   They are especially angered by one sequence in ``The Satanic
Verses'' in which prostitutes are given the names of some of
Mohammed's nine wives and by the book's implication that Mohammed,
not Allah, may have been the real author of the Koran.
