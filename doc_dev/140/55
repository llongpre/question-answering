   Pro-Iranian militants holding American hostages in Lebanon today
vowed revenge for the publication of ``The Satanic Verses,'' but
publishers in three countries reversed decisions not to put out the
book, and two U.S. bookstores returned it to the shelves.
   Former pop singer Cat Stevens, who gave up a successful music
career in 1977 after becoming a Moslem, supported Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's execution order on the book's author, Salman Rushdie.
   From his place in hiding, Rushdie sent London's weekly Observer a
review of novelist Philip Roth's autobiography. It arrived about a
week late.
   The newspaper said that while Rushdie makes no statement in the
review about his predicament, he makes it clear that he identifies
with Roth, whose books were once heavily criticized by his fellow
Jews.
   West Germany, Iran's biggest trading partner, announced it had
suspended plans to help rebuild Iran's war-ravaged economy, and the
Parliament condemned the death sentence as a ``declaration of war''
against Western values.
   Police in Canada said they received a bomb threat against the
Iranian Embassy in Ottawa.
   A Yugoslav republic criticized this week's visit to Belgrade of
Iran's president and joined the chorus of condemnations of the death
threat.
   Rushdie, 41, born into a Moslem family and living in London, was
in hiding for the ninth day along with his wife, American novelist
Marianne Wiggins, who canceled her own book promotion tour to stay
with her husband.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, which holds
Americans Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse Turner in Beirut,
released a statement threatening to take revenge against Rushdie,
the book publishers and their supporters. The statement was
accompanied by photographs of the hostages but it did not
specifically threaten the men or any of the 12 other foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   The group said it will ``take revenge against all those who took
part in strong and ferocious campaigns against Islam.'' The revenge
will cover ``all institutions and organizations that insulted in one
way or another'' members of the prophet Mohammed's family, it said.
   Some say ``The Satanic Verses'' insults Islam by portraying the
prophet's wives as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the Koran
rather than receiving it from God. Iranian clerics offered $5.2
million to anyone who killed Rushdie.
   Rushdie apologized Saturday for the distress the book has caused.
Khomeini, who on Feb. 14 called for Rushdie's death, rejected the
apology.
   In West Germany, the prominent Kiepenheuer and Witsch publishing
house of Cologne said today it will publish the German-language
edition of ``The Satanic Verses.'' The publishing house had said
last week said it would not publish the novel.
   Finland's WSOY publishing company and France's Christian Bourgois
publishing house also announced today they had changed their stances
and would publish the Finnish and French translations.
   Dutch police have taken ``preventive precautions'' to protect
Veen, the publishers of the Dutch translation, police said today.
   In Ottawa, police inspector Ed Gosselin said a man speaking
English called thge department's headquarters Wednesday evening and
said: ``Today there was an attempt to blow up the Iranian embassy.
It did not work but next time it will. Death to Iran.''
   He said a search of the embassy turned up nothing.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, responsible for embassy
security in Ottawa, said it tightened security at the Iranian
Embassy.
   In London, Stevens, whose hits included ``Peace Train'' and
``Wild World,'' endorsed Khomeini's death sentence, telling Moslem
students: ``The Koran makes it clear _ if someone defames the
prophet, then he must die.''
   The U.S. bookstore chains of B. Dalton and Barnes &amp; Noble, which
last week pulled the book from their shelves, both reversed
themselves after nationwide rallies by writers and said Wednesday
they would have ``The Satanic Verses'' in stock in about 10 days.
   The decision was made at ``the urging of an overwhelming majority
of ... store managers and employees,'' according to a statement from
the chains, which are under common ownership.
   The Parliament of Yugoslavia's most liberal republic, Slovenia,
condemned Iran's death threat against Rushdie and also criticized
Belgrade's hosting of Iranian Pesident Ali Khamenei in the midst of
the controversy, the Tanjug news agency reported. Khameini ended an
official visit to Belgrade on Wednesday.
   In Bonn, West Germany, Economic's Ministry spokesman, Dieter
Vogel, said the government's credit talks with Iran will not resume
until the death threat is withdrawn.
   Finland's foreign trade minister, Pertti Salolainen, announced he
was postponing a scheduled trade visit to Iran because of the
``repulsive execution order.''
   From his place of hiding, Salman Rushdie has sent a review of
fellow novelist Philip Roth's autobiography to the weekly Observer,
the newspaper's literary editor said Thursday.
   Rushdie's review of Roth's ``The Facts'' arrived Tuesday, a week
late, said the Observer's literary editor, Blake Morrison. He said
the review will run Sunday.
   Morrison told The Associated Press that Rushdie makes no personal
statement in the review, but ``rather carefully and subtly'' makes
known his feelings about his predicament.
   ``In the course of reviewing Roth, who himself had a period when
he was vilified by the Jews, he says he found Roth was not just
speaking to him but for him,'' Morrison said.
