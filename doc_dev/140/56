   Moslem students marched in several
cities today to denounce the United States because of a book they
consider blasphemous and to protest the killing of five people in
rioting Sunday.
   Hundreds of police stood guard in Islamabad near the U.S.
Information Center, which nearly 3,000 Moslem fundamentalists
stormed Sunday. Five people were shot to death, 83 people were
injured and at least 65 people were arrested in the three-hour melee.
   The militant demonstrators alleged the center's library contained
the 1988 novel ``The Satanic Verses'' by Salman Rushdie. Moslems say
the book is blasphemous because it suggests the prophet Mohammed was
fallible, and Pakistan and India have banned the novel.
   U.S. diplomats, who say the library does not have Rushdie's book,
ordered the information center and the U.S. Embassy closed at
mid-day today for fear of renewed violence.
   About 300 Moslem theology students and political opposition
leaders chanted ``Rushdie should hang'' during a march today in
Rawalpindi, where most stores were closed in mourning for those
killed Sunday.
   Witnesses said small groups of young men hurled stones at shops
that remained open. There were no reports of injuries.
   There also were demonstrations outside the U.S. consular missions
in Lahore and Karachi. No violence was reported.
   Three Americans and 15 Pakistani employees were in the U.S.
Information Center when it was attacked Sunday by protesters yelling
``God is great!'' Police repeatedly fired at the demonstrators, who
hurled rocks and bricks and burned an American flag.
   ``The staff is traumatized,'' said a U.S. diplomat who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Embassy advised Americans in the capital to exercise
``extreme caution.''
   American diplomats said they were puzzled that the United States
was singled out by the protesters, as the Indian-born Rushdie lives
in Britain, where his book first was published in September.
   ``The embassy wishes to emphasize that the United States
government in no way supports or associates itself with any activity
that is in any sense offensive or insulting to Islam or any other
religion,'' the U.S. Embassy said in a statement.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, on an official visit to China,
ordered an investigation of the riot.
   ``My heart is bleeding for Pakistanis who fell victims to the
conspiracy of forces which are bent upon weakening the democratic
government on the one hand and on the other hand for those who lost
their lives due to an unwise administrative action,'' she was quoted
as saying by the official Pakistani news agency.
   The official English-language newspaper, the Pakistan Times,
questioned the motive of the protesters.
   ``It is hard to see how (the United States) became the prime
object of mob anger in the present case when both the author and the
first publication of the book belonged elsewhere,'' an editorial
said.
   The novel takes its name from the verses Mohammed removed from
Islam's holy book, the Koran, on grounds they were inspired by Satan.
   The novel's protagonists are an Indian movie star and a British
TV personality who fall from an airliner blown up by terrorists en
route from India to London. They are presumed dead but survive, or
are reborn, and take on the attributes of the angel Gabriel and
Satan.
   Rushdie denies his novel attacks the Islamic religion, which he
says has been of central importance to him all his life. He said it
deals with ``migration, metamorphosis, divided selves, love, death,
London and Bombay.''
