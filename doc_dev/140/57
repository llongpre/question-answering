   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said Sunday he
wants strong ties with Moscow to help fight the ``devilish'' West,
and Iranian legislators reportedly agreed to consider breaking ties
with Britain.
   Khomeini's overtures to the Soviet Union, which he previously
condemned for its atheist ideology, came during a 1{-hour meeting
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Sheverdnadze later met Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and
delivered an invitation for him to visit Moscow, according to Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   IRNA said Shevardnadze did not ask Khomeini to withdraw his order
for Moslem zealots to assassinate British author Salman Rushdie
because of his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' Britain reportedly asked
Shevardnadze to press Khomeini to give a reprieve to Rushdie, whose
book has been denounced as insulting to Islam.
   ``There was no mention of the affair in Shevardnadze's speech,''
said IRNA, monitored in Nicosia.
   The meeting with Shevardnadze came two days after Khomeini
declared Iran does not need relations with the West. This issue has
divided the Tehran hierarchy between so-called pragmatists, who
favor more relations with the rest of the world, and hardliners, who
favor continued isolation.
   However, Iran's Cabinet declared Sunday it is united behind
Khomeini, reported Tehran Television, which also was monitored in
Nicosia.
   ``Your children are united as a single hand against the enemies
of Islam,'' it quoted a Cabinet statement as saying of the
international furor over Rushdie.
   The award-winning author born into a Moslem family in India has
been in hiding since Khomeini's Feb. 14 execution order, and Iranian
religious leaders put a $5.2 million bounty on his head.
   In protest, Britain withdrew all its diplomats from its embassy
in Tehran, which had been reopened in December after an earlier rift
of more than a year. It also asked Iranian diplomats to leave London.
   The 11 other European Community countries as well as Norway,
Sweden and Canada, recalled their top diplomats from Iran, and
Tehran brought its ambassadors home.
   No diplomatic ties have been formally broken. But religious
leaders in Tehran last week called for a break with Britain.
   IRNA said more than 100 of the 270 deputies in Iran's Parliament
sponsored a bill Sunday to put relations with Britain to the vote.
The bill was ``passed overwhelmingly,'' making it a priority at the
next parliamentary session Tuesday, IRNA said.
   Rushdie has apologized for the distress ``The Satanic Verses''
has caused, saying his work was intended to study good and evil from
a secular viewpoint and not intended to insult anyone.
   Many Moslems contend the novel insults Islam by portraying the
prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and suggesting Mohammed
wrote the Koran, Islam's holy book, rather than receiving it
directly from God.
   The English-language Tehran Times said Sunday that hostile
relations with the West stemming from the Rushdie novel opened ``all
doors'' to improving ties with Moscow.
   It said the two main irritants to better relations with Moscow _
the Soviet supply of arms to Iran's enemy in the 8-year Iran-Iaq
war, and the Soviet military presence in Afghanistan _ were removed
at a time when ``the West has pushed its relations with Iran to an
all time low.''
   Khomeini stressed to Shevardnadze the importance of ``the
expansion of strong ties in various dimensions in confronting the
devilish acts of the West,'' Tehran Radio reported. It broadcast
extensive excerpts from the meeting at Khomeini's home, which IRNA
said was believed to be the first private meeting between Iran's
88-year-old revolutionary patriarch and a foreign minister.
   Tehran Television showed Khomeini, wearing a skullcap and robes
with a blanket over his knees, talking to Shevardnadze.
   The Soviet leader later met Musavi and the two agreed to set up
mechanisms for ``regulating political contacts'' between Moscow and
Tehran, Tehran radio said.
   Shervardnadze said Nikolai Konarev, chairman of the Iran-Soviet
joint economic commission, will visit Iran shortly ``with
significant proposals,'' IRNA reported.
   ``We hope significant chances will take place in bilateral
cooperation in the political and economic fields as a result of the
current atmosphere,'' he told Musavi.
   Shevardnadze was scheduled to return to Moscow on Monday. His
Middle East trip was 10 days.
