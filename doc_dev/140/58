   Moslems picketed Monday outside the publishers of
the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' but organizers of the protest
tried to distance themselves from the death threat against author
Salman Rushdie.
   At a news conference to announce the five-day vigil, Mugharam
Al-Ghamdi, chairman of the U.K. Action Committee on Islamic
Affairs, said the demonstration is a reminder that the Moslem
outrage over the novel, which started with its publication in
September 1988, would not subside.
   Picketers outside Viking Penguin Books handed out leaflets and
carried signs proclaiming ``No Rushdie Porn,'' ``Hypocrisy in High
Places,'' and ``Put Honor Back on the Agenda.''
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
associating the prophet Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting
the Koran, Islam's holy book, was not the work of God. On Feb. 14,
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious edict
calling on Moslems to kill Rushdie.
   Khomeini's action drove Rushdie into hiding, and two Iranian
clerics offered a bounty of $5.2 million for Indian-born writer's
death. Iranian leaders have not rescinded the threat after
Khomeini's death June 3.
   ``Since the sensationalism has receded, what remains is a
genuine and permanent bitterness in the hearts and minds of
ordinary Moslems,'' Al-Ghamdi said.
   Although he warned that the bitterness would increase if the
book were not withdrawn, he and the U.K. Action Committee did not
support the death threat.
   ``We appeal all the time to Moslems in Britain to keep within
the limits of the law,'' said Iqbal Saraceni, a committee leader.
``We will not condone any overstepping of the law.''
   The committee, however, refused to condemn the death threat.
   Threats also have been made to Penguin. A police officer is on
24-hour duty outside and three security guards now watch over the
entrance hall, which is equipped with a metal detector.
   Viking Penguin spokesman Bob Gregory said there was no
connection between the vigil and publication of a paperback edition
of ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``There is no date set for publication of the paperback,''
Gregory said. ``From that you cannot assume that a paperback
version will be published or will not be published.''
   Al-Ghamdi said Britain's 1.5 million Moslems want ``The Satanic
Verses'' withdrawn from publication and Britain's blasphemy laws
changed to incorporate other religions besides Christianity.
   Moslem communities from across Britain are taking turns
picketing the west London offices during the protest.
   On Monday, Moslems from Bradford, 180 miles northwest of London,
were on duty.
   ``We've seen a mixture of some people who are sympathetic and
some people who disagree,'' said Liaqat Hussain, the general
secretary of the Bradford Council for Moslems.
   The protesters handed out leaflets demanding withdrawal of the
book, a change in the blasphemy laws and for ``the moral support
and goodwill of all our fellow citizens to further our just
demands.''
