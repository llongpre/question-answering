<BYLINE>Koran Comic Book Continues to Draw Fire

   The publication of the Koran in comic-book form
drew more fire from Islamic groups as the leading religious body of
Tunisia called for it to be banned as an ``impious work.''
   In a statement made public in Tunis on Monday, the Higher
Islamic Council said the comic book ``If the Koran Were Told to
Me,'' which has been published in France, has ``brought prejudice
against the sanctity of the Koran and Moslems.''
   ``The illustration of the teachings of the holy Koran by profane
images constitutes sacrilege and heresy,'' the statement said.
   The Koran is the sacred book of Islam. According to Moslems, it
contains the words of God as revealed to the prophet Mohammed.
   The comic books are the work of Youssef Seddik, a Tunisian-born
academic who has lived in Paris since 1983. He was in Tunis and not
immediately available for comment, according to his wife, Saida.
   Seddik, 46, said in an interview earlier this month that his
goal was simply to make the Koran more accessible to young people,
and not to violate the sacredness of Islam.
   The Tunisian religious body condemned Seddik for not having
consulted experts in Islamic jurisprudence before publishing the
comic books and appealed to Islamic groups and the publishing world
to ``act efficiently so as to prevent the repetition of such acts
and thus preserve the inviolability of the sacredness of Islam.''
   The series of comic books was criticized last week by Mohammed
Faidallah, head of Islamic Jurisprudence at Kuwait University, as
ridiculing the sanctity of the Holy Koran.
   He was quoted as calling Seddik ``a new Salman Rushdie,'' the
Indian-born British novelist condemned to death last year by the
late Ayotollah Ruhollah Khomeini for ``The Satanic Verses.''
Rushdie has been in hiding ever since.
   ``My husband was completely astounded by the fact that people
are comparing him to Rushdie,'' Mrs. Seddik said Tuesday. ``He
expected some people not to like it, but he never dreamed he would
be accused of blasphemy.''
   The comic book illustrations are accompanied by exact quotations
from the Koran, complete with chapter and verse references.
