   Moslem anger over ``The Satanic Verses,'' a novel
they say insults their faith, has renewed debate over Britain's
ancient, rarely used blasphemy law.
   The law, which has been cited in court just twice in the past 67
years, applies only to the Christian state Church of England.
   Its failure to embrace other religions was among the reasons the
Law Commission, an independent panel of academics and jurists,
called in 1985 for its abolition.
   But others, including Moslems, are fighting to extend the law to
other religions to reflect Britain's multi-ethnic society.
   Moslems say it would give them legal ground for opposing Salman
Rushdie, the author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' without resorting to
the violence urged by Iranian leaders who have called for his death.
   Eight Moslem lawyers failed Monday to persuade a London
magistrate to summon Rushdie to court on charges of blasphemous and
seditious libel, but they vowed to press their cause.
   ``What we are asking is that the law should be changed so that it
gives equal status to all citizens,'' said Liaqat Hussain,
secretary-general of the Bradford-based Council For Mosques.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
associating the prophet Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting
that the Koran, Islam's holy book, was Mohammed's invention, not
Allah's work.
   Rushdie, born to a Moslem family in India, is a British citizen.
He has been in hiding in England since Feb. 14, when Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill him.
   The British government has refused to review the blasphemy law.
``There is no general consensus for reform,'' says the Home Office.
   John Vincent, a Bristol University history professor, wrote in
The Times of London that the government's position ``looks narrowly
ethnocentric.''
   Cases of blasphemy and its written form, blasphemous libel, date
to the time when church and state were indivisible and an attack on
Christianity was regarded as subversion. But church power waned, and
the law came under secular court jurisdiction in 1676.
   As part of the system of common rather than statute law, offenses
are decided by legal precedent and punishments are set by the
courts. Judges have wide discretion, since there is no definition
for blasphemy.
   Blasphemy is generally considered as the use of scurrilous,
abusive, vilifying, ludicrous or offensive words about God or
Christ, the Christian religion, the Bible, or the ``formularies of
the Church of England as by law established.'' Material must be
deemed strongly offensive to break the law.
   Other European nations also have such laws, especially the
strongly Roman Catholic ones, including Ireland, Italy, Spain and
Portugal, says Nicholas Walter, an expert on blasphemy. ``But they
are not often used,'' he says.
   Holland's law bans blasphemy that is deliberately intended to
offend religious feelings. But the Justice Ministry has decided
Rushdie's book did not break it.
   In France, which has no blasphemy law, activists have tried to
ban material on grounds of defamation.
   In the first British prosecution for blasphemy since 1922,
anti-pornography activist Mary Whitehouse sued Gay News magazine in
1977 for publishing an explicit poem about a Roman soldier's
homosexual fantasies over Christ's crucified body. The magazine and
editor Denis Lemon were fined $2,500, and Lemon drew a nine-month
suspended sentence. He lost an appeal.
   In September, state attorneys rejected Mrs. Whitehouse's demand
to prosecute the makers of the film ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' for showing Christ dreaming of having sex with a prostitute.
   In its 3-2 decision in favor of abolishing the law, the Law
Commission held that it was wrong to single out one religion for
protection when ``members of society have a multiplicity of faiths
or none at all.''
   The commission noted that most of the public comment it received
during its four-year inquiry _ from 2,000 individuals or groups and
11,000 petition signatories _ supported retaining the law in some
form. But it said none of the proposed substitutes would work.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual head of the
Church of England, approves of extending the law to all religions,
an option Jewish and Moslem groups support.
   Opponents say such a change would have to give protection for any
organization calling itself a religion, including cults, and would
infringe upon freedom of speech.
   Supporters of an extended law see no threat to free speech.
Vincent argues that it is not denials or criticism of religion that
are blasphemous, but truly offensive, sometimes inflammatory
language.
