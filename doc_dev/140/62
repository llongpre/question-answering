   The Moslem cleric slain in his Brussels
office had been threatened with death for opposing Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's order that author Salman Rushdie be killed as a
blasphemer, officials said Thursday.
   Vice Premier Willy Claes said Abdullah Ahdal, who was killed
Wednesday, got telephone threat March 24 because of his
disagreement with Khomeini's death sentence on the Indian-born
British novelist for writing ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Khomeini issued the
proclamation Feb. 14.
   Claes said ``the Islamic world is deeply divided'' by Khomeini's
execution order, which Iranian clerics accompanied with a reward of
$5.2 million, and the threat ``clearly referred to the moderate
viewpoints'' Ahdal had expressed.
   He did not exclude other motives for the murder, however. No one
has claimed responsibility.
   Britain offered to help find the killers. ``I stand ready to
offer any assistance which may be necessary to track down those who
perpetrated this foul crime,'' Home Secretary Douglas Hurd said in
a letter to Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet.
   Police strengthened border security and said they had no leads.
   Sources reported tension among Belgium's 225,000 Moslems on the
Rushdie issue and said Ahdal had argued hours before the murder
with some who disagreed with him.
   Ahdal had been in Belgium for six years and directed of the
Moslem World League in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The
league, based in Mecca, is a moderate Islamic institution.
   The 36-year-old Saudi national was shot to death in his office
at the city's main mosque along with Salem Behir, the mosque
librarian. Behir, 48, was a Tunisian.
   Police said they were shot at close range with single shots to
the head and chest, with no signs of a struggle. Ahdal was on the
telephone when he was shot, they said.
   In a Belgian TV interview on Feb. 20, six days after the Iranian
patriarch ordered Rushdie killed, Ahdal agreed ``The Satanic
Verses'' was blasphemous but said of the death sentence:
   ``One should not have done that. Rushdie should have first
appeared (before an Islamic tribunal). He should have explained
himself, defended himself. He should have been asked to repent.''
   In democratic societies ``everyone has the right to speak his
thoughts, to express himself as he wants,'' he said.
   At a meeting of theologians last month in Mecca, the holy city
of Islam, the Moslem World League said Rushdie's book was
blasphemous did not support Khomeini's death sentence.
   Elements of the book that offend Moslems include a brothel scene
in which prostitutes take the names of Mohammed's wives and the
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it from Allah.
   Rushdie, 41, was born in Bombay to Moslem parents but has said
he no longer practices religion.
   ``Because of the attack, protection measures for members of the
Islamic community were immediately increased,'' Claes said,
including more frequent police patrols near mosques and protection
for Moslem leaders.
   He said Ahdal was offered increased protection after the threat
March 24 but refused it.
   Claes joined Islamic leaders in urging Moslems in Belgium to
remain calm.
   Sheik Ibrahim Bakr, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Brussels, asked
Moslems to refrain from violence and ``have confidence in Belgian
justice.''
   He said Ahdal ``exemplified the young tolerant, moderate Moslem
who sacrificed his life to serve Islam.''
