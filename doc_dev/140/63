<HEAD>PEN Writers Conference Will Not Focus on Rushdie Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>

   An international writers' group that plans to meet
next month in Canada has decided against focusing on the case of
British novelist Salman Rushdie, according to an official.
   Graeme Gibson, president of the Canadian Center of the PEN
Congress, said that although the conference is titled ``The Writer:
Freedom and Power,'' Rushdie's predicament will not receive a great
deal of attention.
   Rushdie, author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' has been in hiding in
Britain since Feb. 14, when the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
called on Moslems to track down the author and kill him.
   Khomeini, Iran's spiritual and political leader until his death
in June, said the novel blasphemed Islam.
   The PEN Congress, an international group of poets, playwrights,
editors, essayists and novelists, will hold its annual conference in
Toronto and Montreal from Sept. 23 to Oct. 1.
   Gibson said the British-based Committee for the Defense of Salman
Rushdie asked that the conference not take up Rushie's situation.
   ``It's very hard to know what to do about it,'' he said. ``It's
certainly part of the territory for PEN, but there is nothing
specific planned at this point. ''
   ``There are others in far worse conditions than Mr. Rushdie, and
in saying this, I'm not minimizing his condition,'' Gibson said.
   Numerous nations that are predominantly Moslem banned Rushdie's
novel after critics said it associated the prophet Mohammed with
prostitutes and suggested that the Koran, Islam's holy book, was the
work of Mohammed rather than Allah.
   Some Western nations pulled the novel from store shelves and
dropped plans to publish it.
   Meanwhile in Stockholm, a Swedish publisher said it will
distribute ``The Satanic Verses'' starting Friday, and will release
another book explaining Islamic principles in two weeks.
   Carl-Otto Bonnier, vice chairman of the publishing house Bonnier,
said the second book is titled ``Islam, Our Belief,'' written by two
Moslem organizations and sponsored by the Islamic Information
Association in Sweden.
   ``It is not a polemic book. It describes Islam in a friendly
way,'' Bonnier said Tuesday, adding that it explains criticisms of
``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``There was never a question of blackmail of any sort,'' he said.
Moslems in Sweden ``want to feel they are getting an opportunity to
make their voices heard.''
   But he also acknowledged the Moslem groups had made it clear that
publishing the book could prevent the kind of violence and protests
that occurred in other countries over its publication.
