   The new spiritual leader of millions of
Soviet Moslems said Wednesday that followers of Islam should show
restraint about ``The Satanic Verses,'' the allegedly blasphemous
novel by Salman Rushdie.
   The 36-year-old mufti said Rushdie should be judged in a forum
where he can defend himself.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini pronounced a death sentence on the
Indian-born British author Feb. 14 and Iranian clerics offered a
$5.2 million reward. Rushdie has been in hiding since.
   Mahammadsadyk Mamayusupov said in an interview, the day after
being chosen to lead the Moslems of Central Asia: ``First, in my
opinion, it is necessary to pass judgment, and after a judgment is
made to announce a reprimand. This is not so simple in Rushdie's
absence.''
   He said Moslems of the Soviet Union ``are also displeased that
Rushdie published a novel in which Islam was insulted,'' but added:
``I don't know who Rushdie is. I don't know in what circumstances he
was writing. Therefore, I can't judge him.''
   If Rushdie is a Moslem, he should be judged by other Moslems,
Mamayusupov said, but if the novelist is not a Moslem a different
forum must be found. He did not say what other kind of forum would
be appropriate.
   Rushdie, 41, was born to Moslem parents in Bombay, India, but has
said he no longer practices religion.
   Among elements of his novel Moslems find objectionable are a
scene in which prostitutes take the names of Mohammed's wives and
the suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it fromn Allah.
   About 50 million Moslems live in the Soviet Union, the vast
majority in the Central Asian republics near Iran, Afghanistan and
China.
   Mamayusupov is rector of the Higher Islamic Institute in
Tashkent. Both supporters and opponents consider him a strong and
energetic leader, but those who reject government control of
religion fear he will cooperate too closely with authorities.
   He replaced Shamsuddinkhan Babakhan, who was forced to resign in
February because of charges that he was corrupt and lacked religious
knowledge. Babakhan was the third in a hereditary line of muftis
established in the 1940s.
   Soon after Mamayusupov was chosen Tuesday, several thousand
Moslems shouting ``God is great!'' carried the 7th century Koran of
Caliph Osman to the Islamic Institute. The holy book was being
returned to religious authorities by the officially atheist Soviet
government, which had kept it in a museum.
   Mamayusupov, dressed in a white turban and simple grey coat, said
Wednesday the events reflected increased religious feeling among
Soviet Moslems. He gave credit to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
more liberal policies.
   The change in Soviet society ``has reached Moslems as well,'' he
said. ``They have started to feel freer. They can express their
emotions and actively take part in the social life of the country.''
   Religion is tightly controlled in the Soviet Union, and
dissidents of all faiths criticize officially sanctioned religious
authorities for submitting to state domination.
   Some Moslems privately favor an Iranian-style Islamic republic in
Soviet Central Asia. They say Iran's experience and the success of
Moslem insurgents against Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan have made
some Soviet Moslems more radical.
   That is a serious worry for Soviet authorities, who already have
ethnic troubles in the Caucasus region and the Baltic republics. The
population of Central Asia is growing rapidly and a campaign for
greater autonomy or outright independence based in religion could be
difficult to control.
   The new mufti rejected the possibility of a strong radical
movement reaching Soviet Moslems from Iran or Afghanistan.
   ``We have our own history,'' he said. ``We have deep roots in
Islam. We have our own view and our own foundation. We can influence
others, but others cannot influence us.''
   He is pressing the government for construction of new mosques and
publication of more religious literature.
   ``We will continue to open mosques until all the requests of our
Moslems are satisfied,'' he said. ``There is an agreement on that
between us and the government.''
   Religious and civil authorities have agreed to open almost 40 new
mosques in the five Central Asian republics, which now have about
200, Mamayusupov said.
