   Iran broke relations with Britain on
Tuesday because it refused to suppress ``The Satanic Verses,'' whose
author is under a death sentence by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for
blaspheming Islam.
   Khomeini's fundamentalist Shiite Moslem regime, which has put a
price of $5.2 million on novelist Salman Rushdie's head, said it was
determined to defend Islam from foreign insults.
   Britain said the 88-year-old patriarch's order that his followers
kill Rushdie, a British citizen, violated the principles of
international relations and the diplomatic rupture was ``entirely of
Iran's making.''
   Iran decided Feb. 27 to sever diplomatic ties unless Britain met
its demands, expressed as follows in a parliamentary resolution:
   ``If the British government does not declare in a maximum period
of one week its opposition to the unprincipled stand against the
world of Islam, the Islamic republic of Iran and the contents of the
anti-Islamic book `The Satanic Verses,' the Foreign Ministry of the
Islamic Republic of Iran is obliged to break all bilateral political
ties.''
   Moslems object to what they see as Rushdie's portrayal of the
prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and his implication that
Mohammed wrote the holy Koran rather than receiving it from Allah.
Rushdie says the novel, published last year, is a secular study of
good and evil that is not meant to offend Moslems.
   More than a dozen countries have banned the book, including
Egypt, India, Pakistan and Iran. Riots it inspired in India and
Pakistan have taken at least 19 lives.
   Rushdie, 41, was born in Bombay, India, to Moslem parents but has
said he no longer practices religion. He has been in hiding since
Khomeini pronounced the death sentence and Iranian clerics offered
the reward.
   In London, the Foreign Office said Tuesday that British officials
had not received formal notification from Iran and learned but
learned of the action through news reports and a Tehran radio
broadcast.
   Hussein Musavi, the Iranian premier, said on Iran's state radio
that Britain had made ``a big mistake'' and Moslem countries would
not permit their beliefs to be insulted.
   ``We are prepared to employ all our might in order to defend the
borders of our beliefs,'' he said.
   An Iranian statement accused Britain, which Khomeini's clerics
consider their worst Western enemy after the ``Great Satan'' United
States, of ``being in the front line of plots and treachery against
Moslems'' for two centuries.
   ``The world oppressors and the West, which find genuine Islam
against their objectives and their plots, have risen against Islam
and in this anti-Islamic campaign the role of the British government
is salient,'' said the Foreign Ministry statement, distributed by
the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   After Khomeini ordered Rushdie killed, Britain closed its embassy
in Tehran and its 11 European Economic Community partners _ along
with Canada, Norway and Sweden _ recalled their ambassadors to Iran.
   The confrontation with Britain quashed attempts by more moderate
elements in Tehran to open up to Western Europe in hopes of trade
and economic assistance in rebuilding after the 8-year-old with
Iraq. A cease-fire in the war was reached last August.
   A Foreign Office issued Tuesday in London said: ``The present
situation is entirely of Iran's making. Incitement to murder is a
violation of the most elementary principles and obligations that
govern relations between sovereign states.
   ``It is Iran's actions which have removed the substance from our
relations and made it impossible to conduct normal business.''
   The dispute arose as relations between Britain and Iran were
returning to normal. In December, Britain re-opened its embassy in
Tehran, which had been closed for eight years.
   Sweden, whose envoy returned to Tehran over the weekend, will
resume handling British interests in Iran.
   Relatives of the three Britons missing in Lebanon expressed
dismay. The three are believed held by Shiites loyal to Iran and
another Briton, Roger Cooper, is imprisoned in Tehran on espionage
charges.
   The British Foreign Office said Iran canceled a scheduled visit
to Cooper on Tuesday by a Swedish diplomat.
   ``We will have to sit back and wait, rather dismayed,'' said John
Waite, a cousin of Anglican church envoy Terry Waite. ``Nothing can
ever be resolved unless there are discussions with the other side;
that was the whole basis of Terry's life.''
   Terry Waite, 49, disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while trying to
negotiate the release of two American hostages. Nine Americans are
among the 15 foreign captives in Lebanon.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Sir Geoffrey Howe, her
foreign minister, have said they realize the novel offends Moslems.
They insist the death threat be dropped, however, and reject demands
that the book be banned and its author prosecuted.
   In other developments:
   _Indonesia's attorney general, Sukarton Marmosudjono, said the
book would soon be banned in that country.
   _At least 700 schoolchildren marched in Dhaka, Bangladesh to
protest the novel, and President Hussain Mohammad Ershad said
Rushdie should be put on trial.
   _In Canada, two buildings at the University of Alberta campus in
Edmonton were shut down for several hours Monday because of a bomb
threat protesting a scheduled discussion of ``The Satanic Verses,''
officials said. No bomb was found.
