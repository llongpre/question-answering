   Police tightened security for the
225,000-strong Islamic community today after the slaying of a
Moslem leader who criticized Iran's call to kill author Salman
Rushdie.
   Gunmen killed Imam Abdullah Ahdal, the Saudi leader of Moslems
in Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, in an attack Wednesday
at Ahdal's office in the Islamic Cultural Center.
   ``Because of the attack, protective measures for members of the
Islamic community were increased immediately,'' Interior Minister
Louis Tobback in a statement.
   He said police will start ``preventive patrols'' in Moslem
neighborhoods ``aimed at restoring the peace of mind within this
community.''
   Separately, police said they have reinforced security checks at
the borders and airports.
   Police said Ahdal, 36, and librarian Salem Behir, a 40-year-old
Tunisian, were shot at close range.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
and police said there were no witnesses. Unconfirmed reports said
three hooded men were seen jumping from a van, entering the mosque
and then fleeing.
   In London, a senior Moslem cleric today blamed the murders on
jealousy between Moslems after Belgian authorities designated the
Brussels mosque where the slayings took place as the official
mosque in Belgium.
   ``That creates a lot of jealousies and resentments,'' Zaki
Badawi, president of the United Kingdom Council of Imams and
Mosques, said in a telephone interview. The organization is one of
about a dozen separate Moslem religious bodies in Britain.
   Ahdal, an imam or preacher, had been in Brussels for six years
heading the Moslem community in Belgium, the Netherlands and
Luxembourg.
   Behir, who headed the mosque's social services and library,
lived in the city for about 10 years.
   Ahdal's center, in a park near the European Economic Community
headquarters, is sponsored by the Mecca, Saudi Arabia-based Moslem
World League, which was set up by the late Saudi ruler King Faisal
to unite Moslems.
   On Feb. 14, Iran's fundamentalist patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini called on Moslems to kill Rushdie, a naturalized Briton,
for his novel ``The Satanic Verses''. Many Moslems consider the
book blasphemous.
   In a television interview Feb. 20, the day the 12 European
Economic Community countries recalled their ambassadors from Iran
in response to the death decree, Ahdal said he agreed Rushdie's
book was blasphemous.
   But he said of Khomeini's death sentence: ``One should not have
done that. Rushdie should have first appeared (before an Islamic
tribunal). He should have explained himself, defended himself. He
should have been asked to repent.''
   In democratic societies ``everyone has the right to speak his
thoughts, to express himself as he wants,'' Ahdal told RTBF,
Belgium's French-language television network.
   Claude van Engeland, an RTBF reporter, said Wednesday the
network received angry phone calls after the interview from callers
who claimed Ahdal, who spoke in Arabic, was improperly translated.
   After the killings, police cordoned off the building.
   At one point a woman wearing a black veil emerged from the
building and threatened a reporter with a handgun. Several police
officers struggled with the woman and wrested the gun from her.
They said later she was Ahdal's widow.
   Rushdie, born in India to a Moslem, is in hiding in Britain.
   Moslems are deeply offended by ``The Satanic Verses'' because of
a brothel scene in which prostitutes take the names of the Prophet
Mohammed's wives and because the novel suggests Mohammed wrote the
holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.
