   Thousands
of Moslems paraded through Salman Rushdie's hometown Saturday
demanding a judicial inquiry into the police killings of 13 people
during a protest against Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In France, authorities in Lyon banned a demonstration planned
Saturday afternoon to protest the novel, saying the march threatened
public order.
   Iran's state-run media on Saturday said Moslem leaders'
condemnation of Rushdie last week was a victory for Iran, even
though the leaders stopped short of supporting Iran's call for
Rushdie's death as punishment for the book, which many Moslems find
blasphemous.
   Also Saturday, Britain's ambassador to Lebanon said the
controversy over ``The Satanic Verses'' may not have hurt prospects
for the release of 15 foreign hostages there.
   In the 10-mile-long Bombay march, young Moslems waving black
banners and shouting ``down with Bombay police'' tried to surge
ahead, but older men held them back while steel-helmeted policemen
stood along the road, watching silently.
   All shops had closed along the procession's route and traffic had
thinned. Thousands of armed policemen in riot gear followed the
procession.
   During a demonstration Feb. 24, police opened fire to stop
defiant Moslems from marching to the British consulate, killing 13
people. The crowd was demanding a ban in Britain on Rushdie's book.
   Nineteen people in India and Pakistan have died in violence
related to the novel.
   Bombay-born Rushdie is a British citizen who maintains that his
book is neither against Islam nor its holy book, the Koran. Iranian
clerics last month offered a $5.2 million reward for Rushdie's
murder and he has been in hiding since.
   ``The Satanic Verses,'' banned in India and several other
nations, includes a scene in which prostitutes take the names of
Mohammed's wives and the suggestion that the prophet wrote the Koran
rather than receiving it fromn Allah.
   Iran's official Tehran radio said Saturday hailed the ``decisive
stance'' taken by leaders at the meeting of the 45-nation
Organization of Islamic Conference. At the meeting, which ended
Thursday in Saudi Arabia, the members voted to declare Rushdie an
apostate.
   The conference did not confirm Khomeini's death sentence as Iran
hoped, but Iranian news commentaries played down that fact and said
declaring Rushdie an apostate was tantamount to confirming
Khomeini's death sentence.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitored in Nicosia, said
that the conference decision made headlines in all the Iranian
papers, each callin the organization's declaration a victory for
Iran and Islam.
   Iran severed ties with Britain earlier this month over what it
saw as London's role for protecting Rushdie and leading the European
reaction against Iran.
   The 12 members of the European Economic Community recalled their
ambassadors from Tehran to protest Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's execution order against Rushdie.
   The British ambassador in Beirut, Allan Ramsay, said in an
interview with the British Broadcasting Corp. that although many
felt the Rushdie affair set back prospects for release of the
foreign hostages, ``I am not sure that is correct.
   ``I was encouraged, I must say, by the statements made by some
leading Moslem religious leaders who have said in very strong terms
that there is no reason to continue holding hostages. This is very
much a crime against Islam,'' Ramsay said.
   But he warned: ``I do not want to raise release hopes and I do
not want to sound over-optimistic.''
   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are being held in
Lebanon by pro-Iranian Islamic fundamentialists. American Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
is the longest-held. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
