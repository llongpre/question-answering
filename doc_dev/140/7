<HEAD>Author of Satanic Verses Says Islamic Fundamentalists Need Criticism</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Satanic Verses</HEAD>

   Salman Rushdie said today the furor caused by his
book ``The Satanic Verses'' shows Moslem fundamentalist leaders in a
bad light and makes him wish he had been more critical.
   ``Frankly, I wish I had written a more critical book,'' he told
CBS ``This Morning.'' ``I mean, a religion that claims, that is able
to behave like this; religious leaders, let's say, who are able to
behave like this, and then say that this is a religion which must be
above any kind of whisper or criticism, that doesn't add up.''
   He added: ``It seems to me that Islamic fundamentalists could do
with a little bit of criticism right now.''
   Rushdie regretted the violence caused by opposition to his book,
but denied that it was blasphemous, as some Moslems contend.
   ``It's not true that this book is a blasphemy against Islam.
   ``I doubt very much that (Iranian Ayatollah Ruhollah) Khomeini or
anybody else in Iran has read the book or more than selected
extracts out of context.
   ``Obviously it's horrifying that people are willing to proceed in
this way against what is, after all, one novel in the face of the
entire history of Islam.''
   Asked how he reacts to a death threat from Khomeini, Rushdie said:
   ``I think I have to take them very seriously indeed.''
   He told ABC ``Nightline'' on Monday night:
   ``The blood is on the hands of people who inflame the feelings of
people who unfortunately have not and cannot read the book ...
   ``The idea that this is somehow an attack on the religion shows
an absolute failure to understand what fiction is,'' he said.
   Of the novel itself, Rushdie told CBS:
   ``The sad thing is, of course, the book isn't really about Islam.
It's about migration and metamorphosis and all sorts of things.
There's one section where there are two dream sequences in the book,
in which what I've tried to do is write about the birth of a
religion which obviously is like Islam, but is a fictional departure
from Islam, and in that I've done it from a secular point of view.
   ``If you can't believe in the literal truth of God transmitting
words to a prophet ... then it seems to be a legitimate fictional
exercise to say what's really happening, what goes on, what is the
nature of revelation? ... How does a religion come into the world,
what compromises does it face, is it tolerant or intolerant?''
   He spoke about one section where a creature appearing to be like
Mohammed, the prophet Moslems believe is a messenger of Allah, is
given the name for the devil.
   ``The novel is about showing how devils are not always
devilish,'' Rushdie told CBS. ``One of the novel's major emphases is
to reclaim negative images ...''
   ``My views don't have to be the same as the views of a fictional
character. Finally, the fictional character is actually losing his
mind, he's going insane, he's a paranoid schizophrenic.
   ``Now, when you've gone to that length to write fiction, it's
very odd to have it judged as if you were writing some kind of, as
they say, thinly veiled attack. It was never my intention.''
