<HEAD>Nigeria Bans `The Satanic Verses,' Protests Held In Britain, Japan</HEAD>

   The president of Nigeria said Sunday night he had ordered a ban
on the book ``The Satanic Verses,'' and new Moslem protests against
the novel and author Salman Rushdie reached from Britain to Japan.
   Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, president of Nigeria's military
government, told reporters the consitution prohibited material that
offended either Christianity or Islam, Nigeria's two major
religions.
   Moslems comprise nearly half of Nigeria's more than 100 million
people.
   Babangida, speaking in Lagos, would give no details of the ban
or say when it began. Speculation about a possible ban mounted last
week when customs agents started seizing copies of the book from
travelers arriving at airports and seaports.
   Senegal, Kenya and some other African nations also have banned
Rushdie's book, as have other nations with large Moslem populations.
   Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in India, now is a British
citizen.
   He has been in hiding since Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini, ordered his death on Feb. 14, saying Rushdie
blasphemed Islam in his book. Iranian clerics have put a $5.2
million bounty on his head.
   In the novel prostitutes take the names of the wives of Islam's
prophet Mohammed. Also, the book suggests that the Koran was not
divinely inspired as Moslems believe.
   In Moslem-dominated Pakistan, demonstrators protesting the book
promised to greet Britain's foreign secretary with black flags to
mourn his arrival on Monday, said Kausar Niazi, a protester in
Islamabad.
   The secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe, is cutting his trip to
Pakistan from three days to 26 hours out of fear that Moslem
outrage over the book will provoke anti-British demonstrations,
officials said.
   Violent protests over the book have killed 19 people in India
and Pakistan. Both nations have banned the book.
   Hundreds of Moslems marched near the British Embassy in Tokyo on
Sunday and called on Japanese not to read ``The Satanic Verses.''
They also demanded that Rushdie be killed.
   Speeches at a pre-march rally were interrupted again and again
by protesters, who waved clenched fists and shouted, ``We want
Rushdie!'' and ``Death to Rushdie!''
   Police said about 200 people joined the demonstration.
Organizers put the number at 500. No incidents or arrests were
reported.
   The Japanese government has stressed the need for freedom of
expression and has not banned the novel.
   However, Raees Siddiqui, vice president of the 10,000-member
Pakistan Association in Japan, organizer of Sunday's protest, said
the government told him the book will not be allowed into Japan and
that attempts to translate it will be discouraged.
   In Britain, demonstrators burned effigies of Rushdie at two
weekend demonstrations and demanded that ``The Satanic Verses'' be
banned.
   More than 600 demonstrators marched Sunday in Reading, west of
London, and burned effigies of Rushdie at a rally in a park. Police
confiscated a ``Rushdie Must Die'' banner being carried by three
boys between the ages 6 and 8; a 4-year-old boy walking with his
father shouted ``Kill Rushdie!''
   A life-size effigy of Rushdie was burned and clubbed at a
demonstration Saturday by about 3,000 people in Dewsbury, West
Yorkshire, in northern England.
