   Iran's parliament voted today to sever
ties with Britain in a week unless London ends its diplomatic
embargo and denounces Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses,''
Iran's official news agency said.
   Britain last week recalled its diplomats from Tehran to protest
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order that Moslems seek
out and kill the British author because of his novel, which many
Moslems consider blasphemous.
   Britain also asked Iran's charge d'affaires and his aide to leave
London.
   In London, British Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave
said Britain regrets the Iranian parliament's threat to sever
diplomatic relations but will not change its stance concerning
Rushdie.
   ``Clearly, the British position will not be altered by threats of
that kind,'' Waldegrave said. ``We regret the statement and hope
Iranian leaders will consider again what so many international
leaders have now said to them, that they have an obligation to
behave within international law.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of
Commons today that freedom of speech and expression are ``subject
only to the laws of this land ... and will remain subject to the
rule of law.
   ``It is absolutely fundamental to everything in which we believe
and cannot be interfered with by any outside force,'' she said.
   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
``nearly all'' of the 201 deputies present in Iran's 270-member
Majlis, or parliament, voted for today's measure, standing, cheering
and praising the prophet Mohammed.
   It said they first voted to sever ties in principle, but then
included the ultimatum to Britain to revise its stance.
   The measure later was approved by the Council of Guardians, a
body of six Islamic religious leaders and six lawyers which must
sanction all laws.
   Prior to the parliament vote, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati
said: ``In the future this will be our stand toward any country
which attacks Islam and Islamic sanctities,'' IRNA reported.
   Also today, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
said Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze discussed the issue
with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati and Iranian
President Ali Khamenei during Shevardnadze's visit to Tehran.
   In the first official Soviet comment on the matter, Gerasimov
said, ``the situation that has emerged about the book by Rushdie,
`the Satanic Verses,' causes the concern of the Soviet leadership.
Unless a reasonable solution is found, the implications can really
be unpredictable.''
   Gerasimov said Shevardnadze, who returned from Iran on Monday,
will raise the subject of Rushdie with other foreign ministers and
the U.S. secretary of state when they meet in Vienna on March 7.
   Fourteen Western nations besides Britain have withdrawn their top
diplomats from Iran to protest Khomeini's death decree, and Iranian
newspapers today lashed out at one of them _ West Germany.
   The daily Jomhuri Islami said Bonn should know that hurting
Moslems' feelings ``would lead to unpleasant consequences,'' IRNA
said.
   In addition to withdrawing its ambassador, West Germany says it
suspended plans to help finance Iran's efforts to rebuild after its
eight-year war with Iraq.
   The English-language Tehran Times said Bonn had been dragged by
Washington into ``a whirlpool of rash anti-Iran policies'' that
would hurt its economy, IRNA reported. West Germany is Iran's
biggest trading partner.
   Opponents of ``The Satanic Verses,'' first published in Britain
in September, have staged demonstrations worldwide, and at least 18
people have been killed in violence in India and Pakistan.
   Countries that have banned the book include Iran, Brunei,
Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Egypt, South Africa and
Bangladesh. Lebanon banned the book today.
   On Monday, Moslem theologians meeting in the holy city of Mecca
in Saudi Arabia branded Rushdie a ``heretic and a renegade'' but did
not endorse killing him. Islamic law condemns heretics to death, but
only after they are tried and refuse to repent.
   The 41-year-old Rushdie, who was born to a Moslem family in
India, has apologized for any distress ``The Satanic Verses'' may
have caused Moslems. Iran rejected the apology.
   Iranian clerics have put $5.2 million bounty on Rushdie's head
and he is in hiding under police guard.
