   A bomb exploded near a British
cultural center early Tuesday, hours after Foreign Secretary Sir
Geoffrey Howe of Britain arrived to discuss the controversy over
the novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Police said no one was injured in the 1 a.m. blast at a building
under construction about 10 yards from the British Council Library.
   It broke windows in the library and some surrounding shops, but
damage appeared to be slight. Bomb experts at the scene had no
immediate information on the explosives used.
   There were no claims of responsibility, but the bombing appeared
to be linked to anti-British protests over ``The Satanic Verses,''
by Salman Rushdie, a naturalized British subject born in India.
   An explosion at a British Council Library in Karachi, Pakistan's
largest city, killed a Pakistani guard on Feb. 27. Police said they
believed the blast was related to Rushdie's book.
   Moslems feel the novel blasphemes Islam. The book includes a
brothel scene in which the prostitutes take the names of wives of
the Prophet Mohammed, and it suggests Mohammad wrote the holy Koran
rather than receiving it directly from Allah.
   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Feb. 14, when Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenie ordered Moslems kill the author.
Rushdie, who was born a Moslem but no longer practices religion,
has defended his work as a fictional examination of the nature of
good and evil.
   Howe arrived in Pakistan Monday afternoon amid unprecedented
security designed to prevent protests over the book.
   About 2,000 police lined the 12-mile route from Islamabad
Airport to the British Embassy. Authorities barred would-be
protesters from demonstrating at the embassy.
   ``If our government would have allowed the demonstration, Howe
would have felt the depth of our feeling,'' said Mustaza Pooya, a
member of the conservative Islamic Democratic Alliance.
   Pooya was among a delegation of fundamentalist religious leaders
and right-wing Pakistani politicians that was allowed to present a
four-page memorandum to the foreign secretary criticizing Britain
for protecting Rushdie.
   Howe was ``willing to concede that the book certainly caused
anguish,'' Pooya said after the meeting. Reporters were barred.
   Authorities imposed a ban on public gatherings in Islamabad of
more than five people during Howe's 26-hour visit.
   Seven people died and more than 100 were injured in Islamabad on
Feb. 12 when hundreds of demonstrators battled police outside an
American cultural center to protest publicatin of ``The Satanic
Verses'' in the United States.
   Pakistan, a Moslem country of 107 million people, banned ``The
Satanic Verses'' after its publication in Britain last September.
   Howe was to meet with Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan to discuss the Rushdie crisis, British
aid to Pakistan, and both countries' support of Moslem rebels
battling the communist government in neighboring Afghanistan.
