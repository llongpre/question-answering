   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
said today the Western reaction to his execution order against
author Salman Rushdie proves that opening Iranian contacts to the
rest of the world was wrong.
   Khomeini also lashed out at the ``liberals'' or pragmatists in
the Islamic republic, who support greater contacts with other
nations, and vowed he would never cede power to them.
   ``At the beginning of the revolution we gave posts to people who
were not totally with us in ideology and the bitter results of that
are plainly evident,'' Khomeini was quoted as saying by Tehran Radio.
   ``As long as I am here I will not let the government fall into
the hands of the liberals,'' Khomeini said.
   He did not mention anyone by name. Parliament speaker Hashemi
Rafasnjani and President Ali Khamenei are leaders of what is
perceived as the pragmatic faction in government.
   Publication of Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses'' was a sign from
God that policies supported by the liberals will not work, the
patriarch said.
   ``Those who believe that if we act in a pragmatic way they (the
East and West) will humanely reciprocate and will respect the
nation, Islam and Moslems, to them this is an example,'' Khomeini
said.
   ``God wanted it to happen in this way so that we may no longer
think in simplistic ways,'' he said.
   Excerpts of the speech were carried on Tehran Radio and monitored
in Nicosia.
   Khomeini warned that economic sanctions against Iran will not
sway his death ruling against Rushdie, who lives in London and has
been in hiding since the execution order was given Feb. 14.
   The European Community, Norway, Sweden and Canada have withdrawn
their envoys to Tehran.
   Several other European countries have threatened to cancel visits
by trade delegations, and President Bush noted the American
sanctions already in place when asked about U.S. reaction to the
execution order.
   A West German television station reported today that the Cabinet
was considering economic sanctions because of the Rushdie death
threat. West Germany is Iran's most important trading partner.
   The pragmatists in Iran say its future development hinges on more
freedom inside the country and greater contact with other nations.
   In addition to foreign expertise and perhaps financing needed for
postwar reconstruction, the pragmatists have said Iran needs more
liberal policies internally so the society could develop in a
high-tech era.
   Their efforts to open Iranian contacts with the rest of the world
since the August cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war have been
undermined by Khomeini's death sentence.
   When Khamenei said on Friday that Rushdie might be pardoned if he
apologized, Khomeini quickly reaffirmed the execution order.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes their religion by
portraying the prophet Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and
suggesting that he wrote the Koran, the holy book of Islam, rather
than receiving it from God.
   Khameini, ending a three-day visit to Yugoslavia, said in a news
conference in Belgrade that the concept of freedom of speech should
not be confused with freedom to insult the more than 1 billion
Moslems throughout the world.
   ``Over the past few days, we have been witnessing a very ugly
event which will in all likelihood continue to excite public and
Moslem opinion throughout the world,'' Khamenei said in remarks
carried by the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia.
   Khamenei said Western governments could not profess belief in
freedom of speech at the same as accepting the insult to all
Moslems, IRNA reported.
   ``There is no solution to the Rushdie affair,'' the president
said. ``An arrow has been shot and is unerringly aimed at its
target.''
