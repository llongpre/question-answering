   Iran's death sentence on novelist Salman Rushdie
has appalled European intellectuals and stung them into a concerted
protest that appears to be spreading throughout the non-Moslem world.
   ``We find ourselves caught up in a religious war,'' Edward
Mortimer, a British commentator, wrote Tuesday.
   In London, authors and free speech advocates announced they would
seek support for ``A World Statement'' to be published in newspapers
internationally.
   Expressions of disgust came from Mexican novelist Octavio Paz and
the Australian government. American writers led by PEN American
Center president Susan Sontag also have begun mobilizing, and
President Bush added his condemnation Tuesday.
   Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has been judged
blasphemous by Moslems because of its treatment of the prophet
Mohammed and the Koran, Islam's holy book.
   Moslem protests began in Britain soon after the novel's
publication last fall, but their demonstrations and public
book-burnings were widely regarded as more as a curiosity than as a
threat.
   Then came last week's riots in Pakistan and India that claimed at
least six lives, followed by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death
sentence on Rushdie and his publishers.
   Almost immediately, British playwright Harold Pinter led a group
of writers to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's doorstep to demand
action over ``an intolerable and barbaric state of affairs.''
   The British government's initial tactic apparently was to wait
and see whether an apology from Rushdie might lift the death threat.
Rushdie, who had gone into hiding, issued an apology Saturday for
causing offense to Islam. When that had no effect, the government
decided, with its European Economic Community partners, to get tough.
   On Monday the 12 EEC countries resolved to withdraw their envoys
from Iran. Non-EEC countries also took action. Sweden recalled its
ambassador, and the Austrian, Swiss and Finnish governments summoned
Iranian diplomats to express their condemnation.
   In France, the affair has dominated the headlines. Patrick
Marnham, a British writer and journalist in Paris, believes French
intellectuals have responded much more vigorously than their British
counterparts would have done if a French writer was under threat.
``They're really outraged,'' he said in an interview.
   After the book's French publisher suspended publication to
protect its employees from Khomeini's retribution, the weekly
l'Evenement du Jeudi proposed that French publishers put the book
out en masse and share responsibility. Nearly 20 publications and
publishing houses said they would participate.
   More than 500 authors belonging to the French section of the
international PEN club wrote to Prime Minister Michel Rocard
demanding action to ensure the book was published.
   In West Germany, writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger said a group of
authors, including internationally renowned Guenter Grass, had
agreed to explore ways of publishing ``The Satanic Verses'' after
its German publisher pulled out.
   Several Dutch newspapers and weeklies are to publish an ad signed
by some 850 intellectuals supporting Rushdie, and Dutch Foreign
Minister Hans van den Broek has canceled a visit to Iran.
   The Irish Writers Union wrote to The Irish Times saying Ireland's
own history of religious censorship should rally its writers to
Rushdie's defense.
   Spanish novelist Juan Benet called the death threat ``savagery,''
and the Madrid newspaper El Pais quoted Octavio Paz as saying: ``It
seems incredible to me that in the 20th century a writer could be
sentenced to death for writing whatever he chooses.''
   The Norwegian and Danish authors' unions said they deplored the
death threat, and publishers in those countries said they would go
ahead with translations.
   Italian novelist Alberto Moravia denounced the death threat on
television, while in overwhelmingly Moslem Turkey, novelist Orhan
Pamuk published a newspaper article defending Rushdie's right to
free speech.
   ``If there is one thing that insults the Islamic countries, it is
the decision to announce a bounty for the muirder of the authors of
other countries and assign murderers to kill them,'' he wrote.
   Mortimer, writing in The Financial Times, said the real lesson of
the affair was its global nature, pitting Western concepts of
freedom against Islamic fundamentalism.
   ``Britain is no longer an island,'' he wrote. ``Nor is Europe for
that matter. And nor is North America.''
