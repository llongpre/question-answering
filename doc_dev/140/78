President Bush, denouncing firebombings that may be linked to Salman Rushdie's 
controversial novel "The Satanic Verses," warned today he will not tolerate 
violent protests in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"This country was founded on the principles of free speech and religious 
tolerance," Bush told reporters during a question-and-answer session following 
a Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to make it perfectly clear the United States will not tolerate any 
assault on these rights," Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The offices of an outspoken New York City weekly newspaper were heavily damaged 
by a firebomb early today along with two bookstores in Berkeley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't yet know if the bombings are related to the book 'The Satanic 
Verses,' " Bush said, "but let me be clear, anyone undertaking acts of 
intimidation or violence aimed at the author, the publishers or the 
distributors of 'The Satanic Verses' will be prosecuted to the maximum." 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he was directing Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh to determine whether any 
federal laws had been violated in the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
The Riverdale Press in New York City had run an editorial endorsing the novel. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie's execution has been ordered by Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini, who alleges the book defames the prophet Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
At least 20 people have been killed and hundreds injured in Muslim 
demonstrations throughout the world against the book. Another 25 people were 
injured in the Indian city of Srinagar today in a second day of anti-Rushdie 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
Iran's call for Muslims to kill Rushdie has outraged many Western countries and 
provoked the recall of top diplomats by the European Community members and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Parliament today voted to cut ties with Britain, where the 
Indian-born Rushdie lives, unless it declares within a week "its opposition to 
the unprincipled stands against the world of Islam, the Islamic Republic of 
Iran and the contents of the anti-Islamic book 'The Satanic Verses.' "
