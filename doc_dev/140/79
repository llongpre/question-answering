   Iran severed diplomatic relations with
Britain today and accused London of anti-Islamic ``treachery'' for
refusing to denounce Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Iran's parliament had given Britain one week to lift Britain's
diplomatic embargo and ``clarify'' its stance on the book many
Moslems consider blasphemous.
   London blamed Tehran for the break. It comes after Britain
withdrew all its diplomats from Iran to protest Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's Feb. 14 religious edict calling on Moslems to kill
Rushdie for insulting Islam.
   ``The present situation is entirely of Iran's making,'' said a
Foreign Office statement. ``Incitement to murder is a violation of
the most elementary principles and obligations that govern relations
between sovereign states.''
   Iran did not formally communicate to Britain its decision to end
relations, the statement said.
   Relatives of Britons believed held hostage by pro-Iranian
radicals in Lebanon said they are saddened and dismayed by Iran's
move.
   ``Hostages' families all around the world will be upset that a
major player in this game is now out of the arena,'' said John
Waite, a cousin of missing Anglican envoy Terry Waite.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted a Foreign
Ministry statement as saying: ``The world oppressors and the West,
which find genuine Islam against their objectives and plots, have
risen against Islam, and in this anti-Islamic campaign the role of
the British government is salient.
   ``In the past two centuries, Britain has been in the front line
of plots and treachery against Islam and Moslems.''
   Iranian clerics have put a bounty of $5.2 million on the head of
the author, a British citizen born to a Moslem family in India.
Rushdie, 41, went into hiding and is under police guard with his
wife, American novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   Iran's threats prompted the 11 other European Economic Community
nations, and Norway, Sweden and Canada to recall their ambassadors
from Iran.
   A radical Palestinian group, the pro-Syrian Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command led by Ahmed Jibril, has
said it will kill Rushdie.
   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman Charles Redman
condemned the Palestinian threat.
   ``This terrorist group is based in Damascus and therefore ... we
call on Syria to take appropriate action,'' Redman said.
   In Vienna, British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe indicated
to reporters he wants the Soviet Union to take a stronger stand and
influence Iran to rescind the death threat.
   Howe said he and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
discussed the Rushdie affair in private talks Monday in Vienna.
   He told Shevardnadze ``there can be no justification for (Iran's)
incitement to murder ... and no justification for seeking to impair
the freedom of speech in a country like ours,'' Howe said.
   The Soviets have said Western countries are justified in their
indignation. They have not condoned the decree, but said Khomeini
may have had to act under Islamic teachings.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Saturday she
believes the novel has deeply offended Moslems, but her government
still insists Iran must revoke the death sentence before relations
can be normalized.
   Iran rejected Thatcher's statement of sympathy, saying it was
insufficient and suggesting London defuse the crisis by prosecuting
Rushdie and banning the novel. Britain refuses to do either.
   Moslems have objected to Rushdie's portrayal of the prophet
Mohammed's wives as prostitutes and the book's suggestion the Koran,
Islam's holy book, was not inspired by Allah.
   Rushdie has said his novel was meant to explore good and evil
secularly, and was not meant to insult Islam.
   Nineteen people have died in Pakistan and India in violence
related to the book.
   In Bangkok, Thailand, about 300 Moslems demonstrated against
Rushdie today outside the British Embassy, as their government
prepared to ban the novel.
   National Thai Police chief Gen. Pow Sarasin was to sign an order
today banning distribution and sale of the book, a police spokesman
said.
