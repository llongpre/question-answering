ALAA HAMED, a balding, middle-aged tax inspector, seems an unlikely
candidate for persecution. But his hobby - dabbling in fiction - has turned
his shabby Cairo flat into a prison. Anonymous callers threaten him with
death. Outside his flat, a 24-hour armed guard protects him from assassins.
Soon the guards may arrest Hamed: temporarily free on appeal, he faces a
maximum eight-year prison sentence for blasphemy against Islam. His crime:
to have written a fantasy novel that pokes gentle fun at the prophets of
revealed religion.
Hamed is not alone among Moslem writers. The death sentance hanging over
Salman Rushdie has drawn worldwide publicity, but the growing politicisation
of Islam is exposing liberal Moslems to the wrath of their radical
co-religionists. These are a few recent cases:
Pakistani fundamentalists are demanding that 73-year-old Akhtar Mohammed
Khan be beheaded for 'insulting the prophet' in a now banned collection of
nursery rhymes.
In May, Kuwaiti journalist Fouad al Hashem was sentenced to three months in
jail for 'inciting debauchery.' Ridiculing fundamentalist claims, he had
written a column denying that the Iraqi invasion was God's punishment for
Kuwait's sins. If this was so, he demanded sarcastically, why were Londoners
spared heavenly anger even though they openly kissed each other?
In June, religious radicals murdered Dr Farag Foda, Egypt's most outspoken
secularist, whose biting criticism of fundamentalist excesses had led some
clerics to label him an enemy of the state.
Egypt, with its century-old secularist tradition, was long considered a
haven of relative tolerance in the Arab and Islamic worlds. But even before
Islam became a political tool governments found it wise to be seen as
defenders of the faith. Successive rulers have made pacts with the
institutions of Islam - most prominently, in Egypt, with the 1,000-year-old
theological university of Al Azhar. In exchange for Al Azhar's support
against radicals, the state has wielded its power to preserve the
university's rigid interpretation of Islam.
Thus, in 1926, Egyptian courts banned one of the first critical essays into
pre-Islamic Arabia by an Arab author, Dr Taha Hussein. In the 1920s Sheikh
Ali Abdul Razeq, an Azharite scholar, was stripped of his post for arguing
that Islam does not provide a clear-cut model for government. In 1959, Al
Azhar banned a novel for using thinly disguised allegory to fictionalise
various prophets. The author, Naguib Mahfouz, later won the Nobel Prize for
Literature.
Rare though these incidents were, their memory helped restrain historians,
religious scholars and novelists from testing the limits set by Al Azhar.
Now, Egyptian intellectuals feel these limits are shrinking. 'In terms of
freedom of opinion we are going backwards,' says Hamed's lawyer, Niguad al
Boraie. 'In the 1930s or '50s you could mostly say what you wanted, but now
we have ideological terrorism to contend with.
The pressure to adhere to Islamic orthodoxy takes many forms. In Hamed's
case, a spiteful colleague told Al Azhar's Islamic Research Academy, which
is responsible for authenticating Islamic texts, that Hamed's book, A
Distance in a Man's Mind, was blasphemous. A study committee from the
Academy then notified the Public Prosecutor that the book 'committed
aggression against the Holy Koran, claiming that it is man's (not God's)
work, mocking the prophet Mohammed and other Islamic symbols and treating
them contemptuously.'
On the basis of the committee's report police also detained Hamed's
publisher and his distributor. The book - only 89 copies of which were sold
 -was confiscated. Following the trial, which his lawyer denounces as a
travesty, Hamed and his 'accomplices' were sentenced to eight years
imprisonment under Egypt's anti-sedition laws.
Because it was imposed by a special state security court, Hamed's sentence
cannot be implemented without the signature of Egypt's prime minister. This
has not been forthcoming, probably due to adverse publicity abroad about the
case. Still, the writer has spent six months since his trial in agonising
suspense.
Hamed, virtually unknown before his trial, offended the clerics by using
bawdy language to spoof religion. A Distance in a Man's Mind, says one
critic, is a metaphorical book about the future. 'Its basic thrust is that
nothing, including religion, should be free from human inquiry.' But, like
other readers, the critic disparaged Hamed's work on literary grounds. 'The
vehicle is weak and his sarcasm about the prophets seems frivolous.'
While the book was considered blasphemous, other works faced banning orders
for challenging orthodoxy. At the Cairo International Book Fair in January,
raiders from the Islamic Research Academy confiscated five works by Said
Ashmawi, one of Egypt's most prominent judges and Islamic scholars.
Like Sheikh Ali Abdul Razeq some 70 years ago, Ashmawi argued against the
fundamentalist claim that Islam offers a firm base for statehood. In an
unprecedented personal intervention, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt
ordered that the books be returned to the fair. Egyptian intellectuals
applauded the move, but saw it is a futile gesture given the government's
policy of appeasing a 'mainstream' Islam that is moving towards radicalism.
This was exemplified by the treatment of the Hamed case, which was viewed by
many of Egypt's increasingly beleaguered secularists as an example of the
government, abetted by Al Azhar, throwing a sacrifice to the fundamentalist
wolves.
To Islamic radicals, Hamed's punishment was not enough - indeed, it was
another sign that the state has failed in its primary duty to defend the
faith. In the outspoken Islamicist press there were calls for Hamed's
execution, in line with the strictest punishment for heresy and in emulation
of Ayatollah Khomeini's fatwa against Rushdie. 'The imposition of the
highest penalty is an Islamic duty against any who dares attack the religion
or prophet of God, so as not to leave our beliefs in the hands of deranged
groups that call for apostasy under the cover of creativity,' thundered
Islamic Banner, a religious weekly.
While disturbed by such calls, Hamed and his supporters did not take them
seriously - at least not until last month, when gunmen from the extremist
Islamic Leagues shot Dr Farag Foda, a prominent opponent of political Islam
who testified in Hamed's favour at his trial.
Alarmed by the assassination, Egyptian liberals have begun to see a
dangerous convergence between the 'radical' and 'moderate' Islamicist
trends. As they see it, just as the government has accommodated Al Azhar and
its orthodoxy, the orthodox have begun adopting political ideas from the
radicals.
There are many reasons for this. Because of their political motivation,
Moslem radicals have come to dominate the Islamic press. Questions of
religious identity have given way to impassioned discussion of threats which
radicals claim are challenging the faith. One is the incompleteness, as they
see it, of Islam as practiced - incomplete in that religion has not extended
its sway over the procedures of government in most Moslem countries.
More important, radical publicists have successfully pervayed a vision of an
Islam under siege from its enemies. Accordingly, for example, the tragedy in
Bosnia-Herzogovina is explained as a modern crusade against the Moslems of
what was Yugoslavia. The Kashmir crisis, the Sudanese civil war, the
conflict in Nagorno Karabakh: all are portrayed as pitting Islam against
forces of Christianity, atheism and heathenism.
Islamic institutions, which traditionally avoided meddling in politics, have
found it difficult to resist the role thrust on them by the clamour of the
radicals, particularly when they are backed by the financial muscle of Saudi
Arabia and Iran. Inevitably, this submission has expressed itself in moves
to limit freedom of expression.
Does Islam forbid art or permit it? asks Egyptian Islamicist Mohammed Abdul
Quddous in the rhetorical manner of a traditional Moslem sheikh. 'The
correct answer is that art is a two-bladed weapon,' he answers. 'It can be
in the service of heavenly teaching . . . or it an be a tool of Satan]'
Quddous, son of a well-known writer, is considered relatively mild in his
opinions. The Azharite scholars charged with imposing Islamic censorship
declined to be interviewed, but presumably they agree with him.
In Saudi Arabia, his view is already enshrined in law. According to Middle
East Watch, a New York-based human rights group, the Saudi Law of
Publication No. 17 of 1982 lists 18 subjects which cannot be addressed in
any publication. In Pakistan, a recent law has made insulting the prophet a
capital offence.
Increasingly, it appears, other Moslem countries are adopting the Saudi view
that there is no meeting ground between secularism and Islam. Dr Abdul Qader
Tash, an editor of the Saudi Islamic weekly Al Moslemoon, expressed this
idea bleakly. Rejecting the suggestion of liberal Moslem thinkers such as
Egyptian philosopher Fouad Zakariya and Iraqi writer Shibli al Isami, who
believe that there is no contradiction between humanism and enlightened
Islam, Tash says that Moslems cannot accept western notions that religion
and science, or religion and the state, are opposed.
'Some say that Islam will win in any case, and so there is no need to
confront (its opponents),' Tash writes. 'But we cannot be cowards in this
battle of ideas. The Word is the strongest weapon man has known throughout
his history.'
Moslems who think otherwise feel increasingly isolated. But judge Said
Ashmawi, for one, is not intimidated. As he sees it the Islamicist
programme, if it aims to compete with secular humanism, is doomed to
failure. What is missing from the fundamentalist approach, he says, is the
tool of finding answers through debate. 'We (Moslems) are developing a
materialistic civilisation, but without the method of producing technology,
which is based on the technique of criticism.'
Alaa Hamed's wife, a middle-class Egyptian mother of three, agrees. 'The
reason the west has progressed is that you respect reality, the truth,' she
says. 'Why can't I be a Moslem and benefit from progress? They can't force
you to deny your beliefs. Your beliefs are like your name, like your own
mother.'
In their cramped apartment her husband awaits his fate. 'My only crime,' he
says, 'is that I failed to understand the space of freedom in Egypt. It is
like this.' He draws a small circle with a finger.
But even now Hamed has not lost his sense of humour. A recent poem, roughly
translated, goes like this:
They ordered my thoughts to be captured,
Stuffed them in a sack
And tied it to the back of a donkey.
They opened it in court.
It was empty.
They asked why.
Because the donkey got hungry and ate them.
