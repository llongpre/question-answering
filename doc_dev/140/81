   The dispute resulting from Salman Rushdie's new
novel goes far beyond an argument over ethics and theology. It has
disrupted diplomacy and global trade, pitted Western notions of free
speech against Islamic fervor, and added a frightening element to
the issue of foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Unlike previous episodes in the West's rocky 10-year relationship
with Iran, the crisis over ``The Satanic Verses'' seems to offer no
room for compromise.
   ``Is this a religious conflict, a political conflict or a little
of both?'' mused Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg of Norway,
one of 15 Western countries that recalled their ambassadors from
Iran in protest of the death order.
   ``How can we meet the Iranian problem without compromising our
basic principles, while avoiding escalation and the danger of
dramatic conflicts?'' he said.
   Stoltenberg's question sums up a dilemma facing Western
governments four weeks after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called on
Moslems to kill Rushdie.
   Whatever the economic stakes, no Western politician can afford to
be seen condoning a murderous threat to artistic freedom. And no
Moslem leader can be seen to condone a book that allegedly
blasphemes Allah and Mohammed, his prophet.
   ``We're being confronted with an extreme demand. There's no
middle ground. It's not a thing on which there can be any
compromise,'' says Bernard Adamczewski, an analyst at the
London-based Institute for the Study of Terrorism.
   The crux of the problem, he says, is that Islam does not
recognize the concept of separation of religion and state and cannot
accept the Western argument that governments are powerless to
suppress books on religious grounds.
   Iranian religious leaders have offered a $5.2 million bounty for
the death of Rushdie, a British citizen who was born into a Moslem
family 41 years ago. The writer is in hiding under police guard.
   Moslem countries share a united sense of outrage over the book,
and most have banned it, but only Libya has supported the death
sentence unequivocally.
   Most Moslem governments balk at the death sentence, saying
Rushdie should at least be tried by an Islamic court.
   Britain has solid backing from its 11 European Economic Community
partners but fears this solidarity may waver. ``We have a beady eye
on the weaker brethren,'' Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave
said Thursday.
   Countries as mutually hostile as India and South Africa have
banned the book. Israel's chief rabbi has urged his country to ban
it ``so as not to strain Moslem-Jewish relations any further.''
   The Soviet Union must perform a delicate balancing act: it has
been asked by the United States and Britain to intercede with Iran,
but it is mindful of its own burgeoning Moslem population.
   In India and Pakistan, with their large Moslem populations, ``The
Satanic Verses'' is fraught with political danger, and anti-Rushdie
riots have killed at least 19 people.
   Western nations have universally denounced the death threat, and
the EEC countries, along with Austria, Norway, Canada and Sweden,
have withdrawn their ambassadors from Tehran in protest.
   Japan canceled a visit to Tehran by Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno.
   Britain, which in December was enjoying a long-awaited thaw in
its ties with Iran, has supplanted the United States as the West's
``Great Satan'' in Iranian terminology.
   Iran severed diplomatic relations with Britain on March 7, and
hopes dimmed for the release of three Britons held hostage in
Lebanon.
   Britain advised British citizens to leave Lebanon, and an Iranian
newspaper said the cut in ties will have a ``negative impact'' on
the fate of the British captives, who are believed held by
pro-Iranian extremists.
   The British tried to soothe Iranian anger by ackowledging ``The
Satanic Verses'' insulted Moslems and some Britons as well. But they
apparently see no more room for maneuver. On Wednesday the
government announced it was expelling up to 30 Iranians as security
risks.
   Britain's stance has already cost it a major oil technology trade
fair it was planning in Tehran this month.
   Industrialized countries vary in their willingness to reduce
economic ties with a nation poised to spend billions on
reconstruction following its eight-year war with Iraq.
   Even Britain says it doesn't want a trade cutoff.
   Trade with Iran is vital to some countries, and no one put it
more bluntly than New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange, when he
said he wouldn't jeopardize $153 million worth of farm exports to
Iran and ``cause New Zealand sheep farmers to go out of business
because of a threat made to a bookwriter in London.''
   Domestic criticism made Lange back down and register a protest
with Iran, but he refused a British request to recall his ambassador
from Tehran.
   Probably the harshest retaliation came from West Germany, Iran's
biggest trading partner, which has suspended negotiations on export
credits reportedly totaling at least $1 billion.
   France advised its oil companies to reduce imports from Iran.
