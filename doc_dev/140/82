   Hopes raised by the release of two American
hostages in Lebanon have turned to frustration for families of
British captives, and some are demanding a conciliatory gesture
from author Salman Rushdie.
   David Waite, the brother of hostage Terry Waite, has said
Rushdie should apologize for his book, ``The Satanic Verses,''
which many Moslems consider blasphemous to Islam.
   The father of hostage John McCarthy was quoted as saying ``The
Satanic Verses'' should never have been published.
   Rushdie's defenders say it is unfair to blame the British author
for the plight of the hostages. Most of them were kidnapped before
the publication of the book in September 1988 and the subsequent
decree issued against the author by Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. The religious decree, or ``fatwa,'' called for Rushdie's
death on grounds the book blasphemed Islam.
   Despite this, a Gallup poll published Tuesday in The Daily
Telegraph found broad public support for some sort of gesture from
Rushdie. Of the people queried, 58 percent said Rushdie should
apologize to Moslems, and 36 percent thought he should withdraw the
book.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since Khomeini's decree was issued in
February 1989. In an interview from hiding last month with BBC
radio, he said it was not his reponsibility to end the controversy
over the book. ``The people who are attacking me have the business
of solving the problem,'' he said.
   He also told the interviewer the question was ``unfair,''
sounding exasperated.
   Iran broke diplomatic relations with Britain after Khomeini's
decree.
   Syria was a broker in gaining the release of the two Americans
last month _ Robert Polhill and Frank Reed. However, Britain broke
relations with Syria in 1986 over the Syrian Embassy's alleged role
in attempting to bomb an Israeli airliner in London.
   The lack of diplomatic ties with Iran and Syria has been cited
as a key obstacle to the release of Waite, the archbishop of
Canterbury's special envoy; journalist John McCarthy; retired pilot
Jack Mann; and teacher Brian Keenan,who has dual Irish and British
citizenship.
   Paul Handley, Archbishop Robert Runcie's press secretary, said
Tuesday night the Anglican leader is considering meeting Sayed
Quddus, a leading British Moslem, who says Waite is alive and well.
   Quddus, president of a Moslem group in Bradford, northern
England, requested the meeting. He said he was told in Iran
recently that while Waite was well and in good spirits, he would be
freed only in exchange for Rushdie.
   Mann, who disappeared May 12, 1989, is the only British hostage
to disappear since the Rushdie controversy erupted.
   Mann's wife, Sunnie, 78, flew to London Tuesday and said she
thought the British government could be doing more to help the
missing Britons.
   ``I think they could be doing a bit more to help the hostages,
but I am not in politics _ it is not my line,'' she said at
London's Heathrow airport.
   Peter Temple-Morris, a Conservative Party lawmaker who chairs
the Anglo-Iranian Parliamentary group, said last week that Rushdie
should consider ``the effect he is having on British-Iranian
relations and also the effect he is having on the British
hostages.''
   He urged Rushdie not to further postpone a decision about
publishing a paperback edition of ``The Satanic Verses'' _ either
publish and get it over with, or cancel it, Temple-Morris said.
   George Foulkes, the opposition Labor Party's foreign affairs
spokesman, said if Rushdie scrapped the paperback and apologized,
it would help the hostages.
   Rushdie has said he wants a paperback, but publisher Viking
Penguin has not announced a decision.
   Frances D'Souza, who chairs the International Committee for the
Defense of Salman Rushdie and His Publishers, said the hostages'
families have been frustrated by the government's lack of a
``strong, energetic, forceful policy.''
   She said she understood the families' ``tremendous
frustrations'' but warned that giving in to Iran's demands on
Rushdie ``would set a dangerous precedent. What will they ask next,
that we extradite Mr. Rushdie?''
   An editorial Tuesday in The Independent newspaper said Rushdie
has already apologized for the ``shock and pain'' caused by his
novel. This was a reference to an essay Rushdie wrote in which he
expressed regret for the tensions the book had caused.
   In the essay that appeared in the Independent on Sunday weekly
newspaper, Rushdie said he never intended to blaspheme Islam but
recognized that many Moslems were shocked and pained by his book.
   Among the scenes Moslems found offensive were one in which
prostitutes are given the names of the wives of the prophet
Mohammed. The book also implies that Mohammed wrote the Koran, the
Moslem holy book, instead of it being dictated by Allah.
