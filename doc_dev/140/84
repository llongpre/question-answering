   Salman Rushdie must be killed, as the
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered, for blaspheming Islam and
the prophet Mohammed in his novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' Iran's
new spiritual leader said Friday.
   In Britain, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the
announcement by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was ``much to be
regretted.'' A friend of the British novelist called it a rejection
of Rushdie's recent peace overtures to Moslems.
   There was no immediate comment from Rushdie, who has been in
hiding since Khomeini declared the novel blasphemous and decreed on
Feb. 14, 1989, that faithful Moslems should kill its author.
Several Iranian leaders put a pricce on the writer's head of $5.2
million.
   Khomeini died in June, but the death sentence was not lifted. On
Friday, his successor as spiritual leader of Iran's Shiite Moslems
said the religious decree ``about the writer of the blasphemous
book `The Satanic Verses' is still valid and must be implemented.''
   Tehran radio said he made the statement in a sermon at weekly
prayers on the Moslem sabbath.
   Rushdie, who was born in India to Moslem parents, said this week
he had considered appearing in public to deliver a lecture on
censorship, but his police guards dissuaded him.
   In a 7,000-word essay published in the British newspaper
Independent on Sunday, and in an interview earlier this week with
Newsweek magazine, Rushdie expressed regret for the pain the book
had caused but said he stood by it.
   He said he was pressing for a paperback edition and declared
that charges of reneging on his faith were invalid because he had
not been a practicing Moslem for years.
   Independent on Sunday's literary editor, Blake Morrison,
described the Iranian position as a disappointing rebuff and told
BBC radio: ``It was perhaps too much to hope that a conciliatory
tone adopted here would filter through to Tehran.''
   Bob Gregory of Viking Penguin, which published ``The Satanic
Verses,'' said that when Khomeini originally announced the death
sentence, ``We condemned it in the strongest language we could
think of, and we do precisely the same again.''
   Iran's main opposition group condemned the reaffirmed threat to
Rushdie. In a statement telexed to The Associated Press from its
headquarters in Baghdad, Iraq, the Mujahedeen Khalq accused
Khamenei of trying to divert attention from internal conflicts in
Iran.
   Dr. Kalim Siddiqi, director of the Moslem Institute in Britain,
said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp. television:
``There is a sentence of death which will be executed ... by the
political and judicial authorities of Islam, not by private
citizens living in Britain or anywhere else.''
   Siddiqi said he met with Khamenei in Tehran this week and was
told Iran would not compromise on the death decree.
   Asked whether he approved of such threats, Siddiqi said: ``I
approve of it entirely. It is not a death threat. It is a death
sentence passed by the highest judicial authority in the world of
Islam, and it is according to Islamic law.''
   Britain and a dozen Western allies recalled their ambassadors
from Tehran last year in protest. All but Britain have resumed
relations.
   On Friday, the Foreign Office said Britain sought normal
relations on condition Iran renounced threats and violence, helped
obtain the release of British hostages held in Lebanon and freed
Roger Cooper, a British businessman imprisoned in Tehran.
   Nine Iranians deported from Britain arrived in Tehran on Friday.
They included an Iranian television journalist, an Iran Air
official and seven students.
   The London bureau chief of Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting, identified by Tehran radio only as Keivanara, said:
``The expulsion of the students was a political action taken on the
anniversary of the death order against Salman Rushdie.''
   Britain ordered Feb. 1 that the nine leave within a week for
reasons of national security. It did not elaborate, but similar
previous expulsions were linked to the Rushdie decree.
