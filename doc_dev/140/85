   The publisher of ``The Satanic Verses'' is willing
to talk with Moslems and would consider canceling the paperback
edition to defuse the controversy over the novel, a newspaper said
Sunday.
   Thousands of Shiite Moslems demonstrated in Lebanon and Iran in
support of Ayathollah Ruhollah Khomeini's demand that the book's
British author, Salman Rushdie, be killed.
   A man claiming to represent an Arab group said the furor over the
novel could delay the release of foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   Rushdie has been in hiding, reportedly under police guard in
Britain, since Khomeini issued his death sentence Feb. 14.
   Viking Penguin published the hardcover edition of ``The Satanic
Verses'' in Britain in September, and the paperback edition is due
out in fall. Some say the book insults Islam.
   The Sunday Times of London said Viking Penguin might rule out a
paperback version if British Moslems call off their protest and try
to persuade Islamic nations to do the same.
   Penguin also is willing to consider labeling the remaining unsold
hardcover copies with a warning that says the book is a work of
fiction, the newspaper reported, without citing sources.
   Efforts to reach the publishers failed Sunday, as offices were
closed and no one answered the telephone.
   British writers at a Writers Guild seminar in London unanimously
supported Rushdie on Sunday. ``We call upon world opinion to support
the right of all people to express their ideas and beliefs,'' the
group said in a statement.
   ``We request all world leaders to continue to repudiate the
threats made against Salman Rushdie and his publishers, and to take
firm action to ensure that these threats are withdrawn,'' it said.
   The Council for Mosques in Bradford, home of Britain's largest
Moslem population, called for a boycott of all Viking Penguin
publications at a meeting Sunday.
   More than 60,000 Moslems live in the northern England community,
where demonstrators have burned copies of Rushdie's book.
   The 41-year-old Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in India,
apologized for any distress his novel caused, but Khomeini rejected
the apology.
   About 5,000 Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems burned effigies of Rushdie
during a march in Beirut, Lebanon, on Sunday.
   Leading the march were 20 members of Hezbollah, or Party of God,
who wore white death shrouds inscribed in English and Arabic, ``We
are ready to kill Rushdie.''
   Shiite suicide squads usually don death robes before going out on
missions.
   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah is believed to be the parent
organization of Shiite factions that hold most of the 15 foreign
hostages in Lebanon.
   In the ancient eastern Lebanon city of Baalbek, protesters
carried banners signed ``Islamic Jihad,'' or Islamic holy war, in
support of the death threat.
   Islamic Jihad is a Shiite group holding two American hostages,
including Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press. The longest-held hostage, he was kidnapped March
16, 1985.
   A man claiming to speak for a previously unknown group, ``The
Islamic Revolutionary Force in the World,'' said the furor over
``The Satanic Verses'' and the West's angry reaction to Khomeini's
death threat will delay the release of the hostages.
   There was no way to authenticate the claim, made by an anonymous
caller who telephoned a Western news agency in Beirut.
   The man, who spoke Arabic, said the group had ordered its members
to assassinate Rushdie between Feb. 27 and March 15.
   Tehran television reported thousands of Moslems also demonstrated
in the Iranian holy city of Qom, chanting ``We are at your service
Khomeini'' and ``Death to America!''
   In London, a Moslem leader denied reports his mosque was being
used as a base to train Moslems in terrorist attacks. A senior
Middle Eastern diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, made
the allegation Saturday and said the training was under way at
Islamic cultural centers in Bradford, Leicester, Manchester and
London.
   The chief imam at the Manchester Central Mosque, Ahmad Nasar Beg
said: ``I'm sorry, I don't know anything about that.''
   Many Moslems say the book insults Islam by portraying the wives
of the prophet Mohammed as prostitutes and suggesting he wrote the
Koran, the Moslem holy book, rather than receiving it from God.
