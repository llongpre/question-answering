   Iran's parliament voted today to give
Britain a week to alter its reaction to Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's death decree against author Salman Rushdie or ties will
be severed, the government news agency said.
   In an earlier dispatch, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
said parliament had voted to break diplomatic ties with Britain,
which last week recalled its diplomats from Tehran to protest
Khomeini's ``death sentence.''
   Britain also asked Iran's envoys to leave London.
   Khomeini on Feb. 14 ordered Moslems to seek out and kill Rushdie
for his novel ``The Satanic Verses.'' Many Moslems consider the book
blasphemous.
   Fourteen other Western nations, including West Germany, have
withdrawn their top diplomats from Iran in the furor over Khomeini's
death decree.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, said ``nearly all'' of the 201
deputies present in the 270-member Majlis, or parliament, voted fore
the measure, standing and cheering and praising the prophet Mohammed
and his descendants.
   To become law, the bill must be approved by the Council of
Guardians, a group of six Islamic religious leaders and six lawyers
that IRNA said would likely convene today to consider the measure.
   Britain and Iran all but broke ties after an Iranian diplomat was
arrested on shoplifting charges in Britain in May 1987 and a British
diplomat was detained and beaten in retaliation.
   They restored ties late last year, with Britain reopening its
embassy building in December for the first time in eight years.
   Khomeini said last week that the policy of restoring Iran's
contacts with the West, pursued by the moderates in the government,
was a mistake because the West was constantly hatching plots against
Iran.
