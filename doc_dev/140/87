   Israel's chief Ashkenazi rabbi called in an
interview published today for a national ban on Salman Rushdie's
``The Satanic Verses,'' saying the novel threatens Moslem-Jewish
relations and world peace.
   Militant Palestinian leader Ahmed Jibril vowed Sunday to make
every effort to kill Rushdie ``in defense of religion, God, and his
prophet (Mohammed).'' Speaking in Damascus, Syria, Jibril said he
would use his Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command to carry out the threat.
   Jibril said Rushdie's book was ``a new conspiracy ... a desperate
attempt to defame God and his prophet.''
   Rushdie, a British citizen born into a Moslem family in India,
has been in hiding since Feb. 14, when Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini said he should be killed because his novel was blasphemous.
Iranian clerics have put a $5.2 million price on his head.
   The threat prompted the 12 European Economic Community nations
and several other countries to withdraw their ambassadors from Iran.
The Iranian Parliament voted Tuesday to break relations with Britain
unless Britain within a week reversed its stand.
   Nineteen people have died in Pakistan and India in violence
related to the book. The novel is banned in Pakistan, India and
several other nations.
   Israel's Rabbi Avraham Shapira made his statements in an
interview published today in the Hebrew-language newspaper Maariv. A
spokesman confirmed that Shapira wanted the book banned in Israel.
   ``Every man of religion must see himself as hurt by a publication
like this,'' Shapira was quoted as saying. ``If there had been an
attack, for example, on our forefather Moses or on the prophets,
would we not be shocked?
   ``Here we are not talking about criticism, but an attack on the
honor of a religion,'' he said.
   Shapira acknowledged he lacks the power to order an end to the
book's distribution in Israel. He also criticized the death threat
of Khomeini, saying, ``His fanaticism worries me.''
   Shapira is one of Israel's two chief rabbis. He leads the
Ashkenazi Jews, who are of European heritage and comprise almost
half the country's Jewish population. Chief Rabbi Mordechai Eliahu
represents Jews of Middle Eastern heritage. He was unavailable for
comment.
   Rabbi Zalman Quittner, the spokesman for Shapira, said, ``Ties
between Jews and Moslems in this country are very tenuous, and we
shouldn't do anything that jeopardizes them.''
   ``The book causes conflicts between different communities and
even threatens world peace,'' Shapira told Maariv.
