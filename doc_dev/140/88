   Foreign ministers of Moslem nations
began a four-day conference Monday with 150 items on the agenda but
attention fixed on ``The Satanic Verses'' and Iran's order that its
author be killed.
   The Saudi foreign minister opposed Iran's insistence that
discussion of the novel and author Salman Rushdie head the agenda.
Referring to Iranian response to the book, he cautioned against
``this rabid invasion aimed at undermining the Islamic faith and
personality.''
   By Monday, no mention of Rushdie had been made in conference
coverage by the government-guided Saudi media.
   Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries have criticized Rushdie
and banned his novel, which Moslems say blasphemes Islam, but have
not supported Iranian patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
instruction to his followers to kill the writer.
   Last year, the Saudis broke off diplomatic relations with Iran,
accusing Iran's fundamentalist Shiite Moslem regime of fomenting
terrorism among Shiites in the kingdom.
   Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said Monday
that debate on the Palestinian issue and recognition of the
provisional government organized by Afghan guerrillas should have
precedence on the agenda.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia opened the meeting of the 46-member
Organization of Islamic Conference with a three-minute speech
welcoming participants and wishing them success.
   Ali Akbar Velayati, Iran's foreign minister, did not attend.
Mohammad Khodadadi, head of the Foreign Ministry's Islamic
organization affairs department, represented Iran.
   Khodadadi said Rushdie's book ``is the most important issue to be
debated by the conference as far as we are concerned,'' and told The
Associated Press: ``We will press for their support for Iran's views
on that score.''
   Rushdie, 41, has been in hiding since Khomeini pronounced the
death sentence Feb. 14 and Iranian clerics added a reward of $5.2
million. He was born in Bombay to Moslem parents, but now is a
British citizen and has said he does not practice religion actively.
   Among aspects of the book to which Moslems object is a scene in
which prostitutes are given the names of Mohammed's wives and the
suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it from Allah.
   Tehran television, monitored in Cyprus on Monday, said 190
members of Iran's parliament had sent a letter to the Organization
of Islamic Conference asking that the meeting take a stand on the
book ``pleasing to Moslems.''
   Shiites dominate Iran but make up only 10 percent of the world's
1 billion Moslems, most of whom are of the Sunni sect.
   Several conference delegates described the Iranian position on
``The Satanic Verses'' as ``exaggerated'' and said it could give
Moslems bloodthirsty image they do not deserve.
   Conference sources, speaking privately, said no delegation other
than Iran's appeared willing to support Khomeini's execution order.
   ``Most foreign ministers are convinced Iran is trying to exploit
the affair to score propaganda gains'' said an Arab diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Diplomats said moves were under way to persuade Iran to drop its
demand for Rushdie's death and avoid a confrontation at the meeting
with Sunni Moslems led by Saudi Arabia.
   They said some delegations suggested Western nations be asked to
ban ``The Satanic Verses'' and most believed Rushdie should be given
an Islamic trial and a chance to repent.
   On Afghanistan, Prince Saud urged that Moslem nations recognize
the guerrilla government, which he said ``is capable of binding
together the Afghan people in brotherhood and accord.''
   Only Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Bahrain had extended recognition by
the time the conference began.
   The provisional government, based in Pakistan, is dominated by
Sunni Moslems. Insurgents have been trying to oust the communist
government in Kabul, capital of Afghanistan, since the last Red Army
soldiers left the country Feb. 15, ending nine years of Soviet
military involvement.
   Sources at the conference said Iran probably would raise
objections to a government dominated by the guerrilla alliance based
in Pakistan and demand a significant role for the eight
Shiite-dominated Afghan political groups based on its territory.
   Iran has warned of a possible civil war in Afghanistan if demands
for power-sharing by the Shiites are ignored.
   Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, foreign minister of the guerrilla
government, said it was more interested in recognition than in
winning Afghanistan's seat in the Organization of Islamic
Conference. The seat became vacant after the communist coup in 1978
that started the Afghan civil war.
