   Salman Rushdie is a ``heretic and a
renegade'' who blasphemed Islam in his novel ``The Satanic Verses,''
Moslem theologians said Monday, but they did not endorse Iran's
decree that he be killed.
   After a conference in Mecca sponsored by the World Moslem League,
the theologians said the British author, born in India to Moslem
parents, and his publishers should be tried by ``relevant courts.''
Iran was not represented at the meeting.
   Abdullah Naseef, secretary-general of the league, issued a
conference statement urging the 46-member Organization of Islamic
Conference to pursue that goal and to boycott publishing houses that
promote the book.
   The statement, distributed by the official Saudi news agency,
said Rushdie's public apology was insufficient. It said he must
confess that what he wrote about Islam, the prophet Mohammed and his
wives, and the prophet Abraham was ``pure lies and fabrication.''
   Diplomatic sources said privately it would be left to the
Organization of Islamic Conference to seek a trial either in the
British courts or in absentia in an Islamic country.
   Al-Sharq al-Awsat, a Saudi daily, said Wednesday that the meeting
in Mecca, the holy city of Islam, would demand Rushdie be tried in
an Islamic state and would ask the conference to start legal
proceedings in Britain.
   Islamic law condemns heretics to death, but only after they are
tried and refuse to repent.
   The conference at the World Moslem League headquarters in Mecca
ended Sunday with a brief statement naming several theological
issues debated. It said ``The Satanic Verses'' was discussed and
relevant recommendations would be made to Islamic states.
   Saudi Arabia's supreme theologian, Sheik Abdel-Aziz bin Baz, was
chairman of the conference.
   Iran is a member of the Organization of Islamic Conference, whose
annual meeting of foreign ministers is scheduled for March 13-16 in
Riyadh.
   The conference has demanded that member nations prevent
circulation of the book, ban newspapers and magazines from carrying
excerpts, and blacklist the publishers.
