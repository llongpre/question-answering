   Salman Rushdie's ``Satanic Verses'' is a dizzying
547-page journey through countless plots, subplots, satire and
philosophical discussions.
   It also is That Book, the work that has so enraged the Islamic
world that the author has been condemned to death. The controversy
has revived age-old questions of censorship and freedom of religion.
   Lyrical, scathing, inquisitive and at times bewildering, the
novel deals with preconceptions of good and evil, Britain's
treatment of illegal aliens, the desire by Indians to become
assimilated into British culture and, most notably, the birth of the
Islamic faith.
   Rushdie, a 41-year-old Bombay native of Moslem parents, writes in
a stream-of-consciousness style that leaves the reader alternately
exhilarated, bewildered and _ depending on one's religious and
political orientation _ outraged.
   The novel has been condemned by Moslems for its dream sequences
that portray the prophet Mohammed as a womanizer, a coward willing
to compromise his faith for general acceptance and a conniving
businessman who makes up laws to suit his own purposes.
   It also contains a sequence in which a Persian scribe alters the
holy laws as dictated by Mohammed, who is referred to in the book as
Mahound.
   Moslems revere Mohammed as the prophet who brought them Allah's
revelations in the Koran, the holy book of Islam.
   The book prompted Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to put a
price on the author's life, sending Rushdie into hiding, along with
his wife.
   ``The Satanic Verses'' begins with terrorists blowing up a jet en
route to London. Two passengers _ Gibreel Farishta, an Indian actor
who specializes in religious roles, and Saladin Chamcha, a British
radio star able to reproduce a myriad of voices _ fall from the
plane and survive. Rushdie writes:
   ```To be born again,' sang Gibreel Farishta tumbling from the
heavens, `first you have to die. Ho ji! Ho ji! To land upon the
bosomy earth, first one needs to fly. Tat-taa! Taka-thun! How to
ever smile again, if first you won't cry? How to win the darling's
love, mister, without a sigh? Baba, if you want to get born again
...'''
   The two men emerge on an English coast. Gibreel begins to assume
an ``angelic glow,'' while Saladin grows horns and hooves and is
arrested as an illegal immigrant.
   The novel's turning point comes when Gibreel, whose halo dazzles
police, denies to authorities that he knows Saladin. By having
Gibreel commit an evil act wearing a halo and subjecting Saladin to
the brutal treatment of the English police, Rushdie confounds
reality. Which one is evil? Which one is good?
   The book's second, fourth and sixth chapters, ``Mahound,''
``Ayesha'' and ``Return to Jahilia,'' contain the most controversial
elements.
   Gibreel dreams about the city of Jahilia, built entirely of sand.
One of Jahilia's citizens is Mahound, a
``businessman-turned-prophet'' who is starting a new religion.
Unfortunately for Mahound, the city already has 360 gods and little
use for more.
   Mahound's chance for recognition comes when the head of the
city's ruling council proposes a deal: If Mahound's Allah (the
Islamic god) will accept three of the local gods (Lat, Uzza and
Manat) as archangels in his sect, his religion will receive
certification and Mahound will have a seat on the council.
   Mahound, always the practical businessman, sees the deal as a
good opportunity to attract converts. So he climbs a mountain to
consult with the archangel, none other than Gibreel himself. Rashdie
writes of Mahound's moral dilemma:
   ```The souls of the city, of the world, surely they are worth
three more angels? Is Allah so unbending that he will not embrace
three more to save the human race?''
   Although he does not actually hear an answer, Mahound undergoes
what he considers a revelation in the archangel's presence,
believing he should make the deal.
   But he soon learns that the supposedly divine message did not
come from Gibreel but the Devil, who had been impersonating the
archangel. Mahound renounces the satanic ``verses'' and substitutes
these words, which closely follow the spirit of the actual Koran,
about Lat, Uzza and Manat:
   ``They are but names you have dreamed of, you and your fathers.
Allah invests no authority in them.''
   Rushdie takes the story a step further by having Gibreel claim
that both answers came from him, blurring the distinction between
God and Satan.
   Mahound and his followers eventually settle in the ``friendly
oasis'' of Yathrib, just as Mohammed journeyed from Mecca to Medina.
In Yathrib, Mahound proceeds to dictate to the Persian scribe Salman
the rules of the new religion as proscribed by Gibreel.
   However, Salman becomes convinced that Mahound is making up the
rules himself and decides to test his leader by deliberately
changing what is recited to him. The scribe, fearing for his life if
Mahound discovers his trick, flees Yathrib and concludes his part of
the story by stating, ``It's his Word against mine.''
   Rushdie has said his characters ``seek to become fully human by
facing up to the great facts of love, death and (with or without
God), the life of the soul. Outside it, the forces of humanity are
on the march.''
