   Supporters of Salman Rushdie said Wednesday that
the author, who is under an Iranian death threat for writing a novel
many Moslems consider blasphemous, believes reconciliation with his
opponents is possible.
   The Indian-born British novelist, author of ``The Satanic
Verses,'' said many Moslems had written him letters of support since
he was forced into hiding in February, said the International
Committee for the Defense of Salman Rushdie and His Publishers.
   Before he died last month, Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
called on Moslems to kill Rushdie, whose novel was first published
in English last year. Two Iranian clerics supported the edict by
offering a $5.2 million bounty.
   Angry Moslems have demonstrated against the book in many cities
around the world, including several in England.
   The defense committee, set up to organize protests by free-speech
groups, said it collected signatures on a petition of support from
2,500 writers and about 10,000 readers in 67 countries.
   The names were listed in an 82-page booklet which called on Iran
to lift the death threat against Rushdie.
   The committee's chairman, Kevin Boyle, told a news conference
that Rushdie said in a telephone call that it was assumed there was
``an unbridgeable gap between his version of Islam'' and that of
Moslems who accuse him of blaspheming Islam.
   According to Boyle, Rushdie said the declarations of support
emphasized ``that in fact there is no such unbridgeable gulf, that
he does write from the Islamic tradition.''
   ``It is his hope that the recognition by those who have written
to him and those who have signed this (petition) ... will be part of
a process of mutual understanding within Islam leading to
reconciliation,'' Boyle said.
   In Belgium, the French version of ``The Satanic Verses'' went on
sale Wednesday, and news reports said the few copies available were
quickly sold.
   In Brussels, most bookstores put the novel on sale on their back
shelves, and others did not sell it.
   The novel includes a scene in which prostitutes take the name of
the prophet Mohammed's wives, and it suggests Mohammed wrote the
holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.
