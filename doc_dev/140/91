   Cat Stevens once sang about peace, but disc
jockeys nationwide are having a less than peaceful reaction to his
support of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death threat against
``Satanic Verses'' author Salman Rushdie.
   Stevens was a leading pop balladeer of the 1970s, putting out
such hits as ``Moon Shadow,'' ``Peace Train,'' ``Wild World'' and
``Morning Has Broken.''
   But it's been years since his last hit, and the singer-songwriter
whose gentle style fit in so well during the last years of the
hippie generation has long since abandoned his music career to
follow the Moslem faith.
   The British-born Stevens, who now goes by the Moslim name Yusuf
Islam, leaped back into the spotlight last week when he created an
international controversy by telling Moslem students in England that
Khomeini's call to kill Rushdie was supported by the teachings of
Islam's holy book, the Koran.
   Radio stations around the United States responded almost
immediately by banning Stevens' records from their airwaves.
   ``The Koran makes it clear: If someone defames the prophet, then
he must die,'' the singer-turned-teacher said.
   Stevens, in a statement released Friday, denied he wants to see
the author killed, however, adding that he ``simply stated the
Islamic ruling on the Rushdie affair.''
   ``My only crime was, I suppose, in being honest,'' Stevens said
in the statement released in London. ``I stood up and expressed my
belief and I am in no way apologizing for it.''
   He also said the novel ``insults God and his prophets, including
those prophets honored by Christians and Jews as well as Moslems.''
   Meanwhile, officials at radio stations across the United States
said Friday they have pulled the singer's records from their play
lists.
   Stations such as WBZY-AM in New Castle, Pa., KZPS-FM in Dallas,
WCXR-FM in Washington, D.C., WEBE-FM in Westport, Conn., and KLSX-FM
in Los Angeles have dropped his records from their programming.
   In Detroit, album-rock purveyor WRIF-FM promoted a ``No Cat
Stevens Weekend'' by cutting into his songs with explosions or the
sound of a punch in the mouth ``right after a very optimistic and
non-violent line of dialogue,'' program director Marty Bender said.
   ``We're doing the `No Cat Stevens Weekend' to make a point about
one human being advocating the death of another.... This guy carries
a lot of weight, a lot of people grew up listening to his stuff,''
Bender said.
   A spokesman for WCXR in the nation's capital said that station
pulled the records off the air Feb. 28 after serious discussion of
listeners' complaints that they felt uncomfortable hearing Cat
Stevens.
   ``We didn't do this to generate publicity or to scream our call
letters out,'' said promotion director Mark Lapidus. ``We're trying
not to support an entertainer that's come out in favor of
assassination.''
