   Radio stations nationwide are boycotting Cat
Stevens songs because the 1970s balladeer said he supported
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's murder threat against ``Satanic
Verses'' author Salman Rushdie.
   The former pop star, however, denied Friday that he wants to see
the writer killed. He said he was ``totally abhorred'' by press
publicity and headlines such as, ``Kill Rushdie says Cat Stevens.''
   Stevens, a Briton who took the name Yusuf Islam and founded an
Islamic school in London when he became a Moslem in 1977, said he
had ``simply stated the Islamic ruling on the Rushdie affair'' when
he was asked a question at Kingston Polytechnic, a college near
London, on Feb. 21.
   He said in a statement issued in London that his only fault was
``being honest.'' He also said the novel ``insults God and His
prophets, including those prophets honored by Christians and Jews as
well as Moslems.''
   Stations such as KZPS-FM in Dallas, WCXR-FM in Washington, D.C.,
WEBE-FM in Westport, Conn., WBZY-AM in New Castle, Pa., and KLSX-FM
in Los Angeles have dropped Cat Stevens records from their
programming.
   In Detroit, WRIF-FM promoted a ``No Cat Stevens Weekend'' by
cutting into his songs with explosions or the sound of someone
punching someone ``right after a very optimistic and non-violent
line of dialogue,'' program director Marty Bender said Friday.
   ``We're doing the `No Cat Stevens Weekend' to make a point about
one human being advocating the death of another. ... This guy
carries a lot of weight, a lot of people grew up listening to his
stuff,'' Bender said.
   The tempest stems from Stevens' remarks to Moslem students in
England last week in which he endorsed Khomeini's call to kill
Rushdie for writing the novel that many Moslems consider blasphemous.
   ``The Koran makes it clear: If someone defames the prophet, then
he must die,'' the singer-turned-teacher told the students.
   Stevens was a leading singer-songwriter of the 1970s, with such
hits as ``Moon Shadow,'' ``Peace Train'' and ``Wild World'' in 1971,
``Morning Has Broken'' in 1972 and ``Another Saturday Night'' in
1974.
   But he abandoned his career and stage name years ago.
   Stevens said Friday that it is the duty of every Moslem to put
forward the Islamic viewpoint ``and that is what I did.''
   ``My only crime was, I suppose, in being honest. I stood up and
expressed my belief and I am in no way apologizing for it,'' Stevens
said in a statement.
   Stevens' statement was headed in black type: ``Under Islamic Law,
the ruling regarding blasphemy is quite clear; the person found
guilty of it must be put to death. Only under certain circumstances
can repentance be accepted.''
   Stevens said Moslems in Britain must observe British laws, but
might have to become more involved in British politics if the
government would not comply with their demands for a ban on
Rushdie's novel.
   Bender, who estimates WRIF only played Cat Stevens songs once or
twice a week, readily admits `we're just goofing around'' and he
believes much of the fuss on the nation's airwaves has its roots in
promotion.
   ``It's more ploy than politics,'' he said.
   In Nashville, disc jockeys at WGFX-FM dropped the singer's works
and offered to swap their recordings for copies of ``Satanic
Verses.''
   Radio personality Tom Leykis of KFI-AM in Los Angeles asked
people to bring in records to burn, only to have that denounced by
colleague Geoff Edwards, who was suspended Feb. 28 for refusing to
run Leykis' promotions.
   KFI publicist Mike Venema said a station announcement on the
resolution of that conflict was pending. However, a bonfire
scheduled for March 8 was canceled because the Fire Department
revoked a permit it had granted, Venema said.
   Leykis said in a press release he would still destroy the
records, perhaps by steamroller, but as an alternative he was trying
to organize a celebrity concert protesting the death threat against
Rushdie.
   A spokesman for WCXR in the nation's capital emphasized that the
station pulled the records off the air Feb. 28 after serious
discussion of listeners' complaints that they felt uncomfortable
hearing Cat Stevens.
   ``We didn't do this to generate publicity or to scream our call
letters out,'' said promotion director Mark Lapidus, calling the
indefinite suspension of Cat Stevens airplay a response to
listeners' requests.
