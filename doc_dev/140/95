   Author Salman Rushdie's detailed defense of ``The
Satanic Verses'' is winning plaudits from fellow writers but has
failed to placate British Moslems who say the novel is blasphemous.
   Several writers said Rushdie's 7,000-word essay was a brilliant
defense of free speech. But Moslems said it would not break the
deadlock over the novel, and one reiterated that the death sentence
passed on Rushdie by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remained
in force.
   Rushdie's essay, published in The Independent on Sunday, was his
first detailed comment on the furor aroused by ``The Satanic
Verses'' since Khomeini's edict forced him into hiding a year ago.
   Rushdie, 42, wrote of the pain of being cut off from society;
the irony of being condemned by Moslems for a novel that sought to
highlight their plight as immigrants in the West; and the anger he
feels that the Labor Party, which he has always supported, failed
to back him.
   The Bombay-born Briton said his novel sought to create a
literary language for ``formerly colonized, still-disadvantaged
peoples,'' those like himself who straddle different cultures _ ``a
love-song to our mongrel selves.''
   ``To be rejected and reviled by, so to speak, one's own
characters is a shocking and painful experience for any writer,''
he wrote.
   ``I recognize that many Moslems have felt shocked and pained
too. Perhaps a way forward might be found through the mutual
recognition of that mutual pain. Let us attempt to believe in each
other's good faith.''
   Shabbir Akhtar, a British Moslem, welcomed Rushdie's decision to
publish the essay, calling it ``thoughtful and unexpected.'' But he
said the novel remained a ``calculated attempt to vilify and
slander (the Prophet) Mohammed.''
   Akhtar is a member of the mosque council in Bradford, the
heavily Moslem-populated city in northern England where
anti-Rushdie sentiment runs high.
   Writing today in The Independent, sister of the paper that
published Rushdie's essay, Akhtar urged Rushdie to ``engage in a
dialogue'' with those he has offended. He said Islam was a merciful
religion, and ``the magnanimity which has been denied to both
parties may yet seek an occasion.''
   But he regretted Rushdie's insistence that a paperback edition
be published, saying it would ``fuel extremism in the Moslem camp.
There may even be acts of political terrorism. It will be seen as a
further provocation...''
   Rushdie's publisher, Viking Penguin, says ``no firm date'' has
been set for issuing a paperback.
   Liaqat Hussain, general secretary of the Council of Mosques in
Bradford, urged Rushdie to ``be brave enough to face the world for
his principles.''
   Another British Moslem leader, Sayed Abdul Quddus, said: ``The
death sentence still stands on Salman Rushdie. It has been passed
by Islamic law.''
   Novelist Penelope Lively, one of several writers who praised
Rushdie's essay, called it ``dignified and moving. I think, sadly,
it points up the basic confrontation; here is a novelist trying to
explain his purpose to fundamentalists who cannot, or will not,
understand what fiction is or does.''
   Writer Michael Ignatieff said the essay would be regarded as
``one of the great classical defenses of the novelist's art in this
country.''
   In his essay, Rushdie says the sequences most objected to by his
Moslem critics are actually attempts to express the pain of people
when their faith is stretched to breaking point _ ``to portray a
soul in crisis, to show how the loss of God can destroy a man's
life.''
   But he says the passage involving Mohammed with three pagan,
female deities _ an episode that particularly incensed Moslems _
was designed in part to ask ``awkward questions'' about Islam's
attitude to women.
   In introducing a character named Mahound, a medieval European
term of abuse for Mohammed, Rushdie said he was turning an insult
into a term of ethnic pride; ``The purpose is not to suggest that
the Koran (the Moslem holy book) is written by the devil; it is to
attempt the sort of act of affirmation that, in the United States,
transformed the word Black from the standard term of racist abuse
into a `beautiful' expression of cultural pride.''
   To Moslems who accuse him of turning against the faith into
which he was born, he replied: ``To put it as simply as possible: I
am not a Moslem. It feels bizarre, and wholly inappropriate, to be
described as some sort of heretic after having lived my life as a
secular, pluralist, eclectic man.''
   Responding to those who claim he deliberately set out to provoke
Moslems, he likened himself to rape victims who are accused of
having ``asked for it.''
   In a separate interview with the Independent on Sunday, Rushdie
said he has been reading Moby Dick, Ulysses, Tristram Shandy and
great free-speech defenders like Rousseau, Diderot and Voltaire,
and watching TV soap operas.
   He added: ``Having had a lot of late nights by myself I've also
become an addict of American football'' _ one of the newer features
of British television.
