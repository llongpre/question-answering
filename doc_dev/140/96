   A pro-Iranian militant group holding two
American hostages said today it has completed plans to kill British
author Salman Rushdie for allegedly defaming Islam in his novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization warned in a statement
delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut that ``the execution''
will be preceeded by attacks on British police. It did not threaten
the hostages.
   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization declares that it has
completed its preparations to execute the just sentence issued by
esteemed cleric and great struggler Ayatollah Khomeini against
Salman Rushdie,'' the group said.
   Khomeini issued a death sentence on Rushdie Feb. 14, and Iranian
clerics put a $5.2 million bounty on the author's head. Rushdie is
in hiding.
   The hand-written Arabic-language statement was accompanied by an
instant photograph of hostage Edward Austin Tracy. Revolutionary
Justice announced Oct. 21, 1986 it had kidnapped Tracy, a
58-year-old writer from Burlington, Vt.
   The group also holds Joseph James Cicippio, 58, of Valley Forge,
Pa., who was acting comptroller of the American University of Beirut
when he was abducted Sept. 12, 1986.
   ``The Revolutionary Justice Organization also declares that
before taking any measures, it will find itself compelled to attack
British police posts assigned to protect Salman Rushdie in order to
get to him and carry out the sentence,'' the statement said.
   ``We hold the British government responsible in advance for the
human and material losses among the British police and their posts
that could result from the attacks on them,'' the statement added.
   ``This warning applies to all countries that are currently
negotiating with the British government to extend asylum and
protection to Rushdie,'' the statement concluded.
   Revolutionary Justice, believed made up of Shiite Moslem Lebanese
zealots loyal to Iran, became the second group in the past four days
to threaten to kill Rushdie.
   On Sunday, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, a Syrian-backed guerrilla group headed by
Ahmed Jibril, pledged to carry out Khomeini's execution order.
   On Feb. 23, another group holding American hostages in Lebanon
issued a statement vowing revenge on Rushdie and the publishers of
his book.
   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine pledged ``revenge
on all those who took part in strong and ferocious campaigns against
Islam ... all institutions and organizations that insulted in one
way or another'' the prophet Mohammed and his family.
   The group holds Americans Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and Jesse
Turner. It sent a photograph of the three men with its statement but
did not threaten the hostages.
   They are among the 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, held
hostage in Lebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson,
41, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   Iran on Tuesday broke diplomatic relations with Britain over the
Rushdie dispute.
   Iran's Kayhan International newspaper said today the controversy
will ``leave its negative impact on the fate of the British hostages
in Lebanon.''
   There are three Britons held hostage: Anglican Church envoy Terry
Waite; journalist John McCarthy, 32; and teacher Brian Keenan, 38.
