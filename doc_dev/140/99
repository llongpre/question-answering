   The late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
order calling for the death of author Salman Rushdie must be
carried out, Iran's spiritual leader said today.
   In London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher condemned
today's sermon by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and said it was ``much to
be regretted.'' In a related development, nine Iranians deported
from Britain arrived in Tehran.
   Khamenei, Khomeini's successor, said Khomeini's fatwa, or
religious decree, ``about the writer of the blasphemous book, `The
Satanic Verses' is still valid and must be implemented,'' according
to a Tehran radio broadcast monitored in Nicosia.
   Rushdie, an Indian-born British author, has been in hiding in
Britain since Khomeini issued the decree Feb. 14, 1989. Moslem
fundamentalists consider his 1988 book blasphemous for its
irreverent treatment of the Prophet Mohammed, Islam's founder.
   Rushdie said this week he considered appearing in public to
deliver a lecture on censorship, but had been dissuaded by his
police guards. He also said he regretted the pain the book had
caused but said he stood by his work.
   He said he was pressing for a paperback edition. Viking Penguin,
Rushdie's publishers, has said no decision has been made about a
paperback edition.
   Blake Morrison, literary editor of The Independent on Sunday and
a friend of Rushdie, called Khamenei's statements ``disappointing
news in a week when he (Rushdie) has made a real effort to reopen
the debate in a more peaceful way.''
   ``Obviously it was perhaps too much to hope that a conciliatory
tone adopted here would filter through to Tehran,'' Morrison told
BBC radio.
   The international controversy over the book increased last year
when Khomeini issued the death decree and several Iranian leaders
put a $5.2 million bounty on Rushdie's head.
   Britain, along with about 12 Western allies, recalled their
ambassadors from Tehran to protest the fatwa. The European allies
resumed ties with Iran, but Tehran severed relations with London,
accusing it of trying to pressure Khomeini to revoke the death
decree.
   In Tehran today, an Iranian TV journalist deported along with an
Iran Air official and seven students, said it was no coincidence
that their expulsions came near the anniversary of Khomeini's death
decree.
   The London bureau chief of the Islamic Republic of Iran
Broadcasting, identified only as Keivanara, told Tehran radio ``the
expulsion of the students was a political action taken on the
anniversary of the death order against Salman Rushdie.''
   Britain announced Feb. 1 that the nine had to be out within a
week for reasons of national security. It did not elaborate, but
similar expulsions in the past have been linked to the Rushdie
death decree.
