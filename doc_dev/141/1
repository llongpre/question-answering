   Classes were supposed to start here
Wednesday, but after a few howling minutes of chaos there was no
class, no school, and for many residents, no home.
   The twisters that tore into this northern Illinois community and
several neighboring towns Tuesday killed at least 24 people and
injured more than 300. As they flipped cars and tore roofs off
houses, the tornadoes also threatened to bury hundreds of lives.
   ``Life in Plainfield, Crest Hill, Joliet and surrounding towns
will never be the same,'' said an editorial in Wednesday's Joliet
Herald-News. ``It has only been a few hours since the tragedy
struck. It will take days, weeks and years to recover.''
   Scores of residents were left homeless. Some residents who had
been planning a new beginning were suddenly faced with nothing.
   Jerry O'Shea, a new teacher, was getting ready for the start of
classes and left Plainfield High School minutes before the twisters
hit. He returned Wednesday to a school in ruin.
   ``This was going to be my first day teaching,'' O'Shea said.
``Welcome to Plainfield.''
   In the Warwick subdivision of Joliet, about 35 miles southwest
of Chicago, new homes finished in the last six months were reduced
to their foundations in minutes. Joliet officials had to explain to
a touring Gov. James R. Thompson that it wasn't a construction zone.
   ``All these homes were occupied,'' said Joliet Alderman Warren
Dorris. ``We lost 31 (homes) and we had three fatalities here. It's
just a shock.''
   There were even more homeless at a seven-building apartment
complex in Crest Hill, near Plainfield. Parts of the complex were
destroyed, and authorities were only allowing people into
relatively undamaged buildings to retrieve personal belongings.
   Norm Treonis, chairman of the company that owns the apartment
complex, said he was working to put displaced residents into some
of the company's other vacant apartments, rent-free, for up to two
months.
   Workers also were issuing checks on the spot to reimburse
residents for security deposits and rent. By late morning Treonis
had issued checks to more than 100 people for amounts ranging from
$200 to $600.
   Most storefronts along Plainfield's main thoroughfare, Lockport
Street, were shuttered Wednesday. But two insurance agencies were
doing a brisk business.
   ``We've had three dozen calls since eight o'clock this
morning,'' said Mike Hull of Plainfield Insurance Agency Inc.
   In Plainfield Township people also hurried to clean yards and
what was left of their homes.
   ``We're just waiting for the insurance guy to come out,'' said
Jim Schmidt, owner of a frame house that suffered extensive damage
in the storm. ``Obviously it's going to be a while.''
   The American Red Cross had three shelters for the homeless.
While providing for immediate needs such as food and clothing, the
organization was also concerned about the long-term mental impact
of the disaster.
   The Red Cross will provide ``someone to talk to and some stress
counseling,'' said spokeswoman Michele McCrillis.
   ``A lot of people _ it hasn't hit them yet,'' she said. ``The
full shock isn't going to hit them probably for a little while.''
   The flat area southwest of Chicago is sometimes referred to as
``Tornado Alley.'' On June 23, 1976, three people were killed when
a twister passed through nearby Lemont. A 1969 tornado killed 33
people in Oak Lawn, a southwest Chicago suburb.
