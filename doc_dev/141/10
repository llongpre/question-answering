   A tornado-warning radar system had been disabled
by lightning hours before killer twisters struck several towns in
northern Illinois, a National Weather Service forecaster said today.
   But the forecaster said he didn't believe the system could have
forecast the tornadoes that killed 27 people and injured more than
300 Tuesday across a region known as ``Tornado Alley,'' about 35
miles southwest of Chicago.
   The weather service's Chicago office issued a severe
thunderstorm warning for the area, but did not alert residents to
the tornadoes until six minutes after they had touched down in the
communities of Plainfield and Crest Hill.
   The office is equipped with an early version of Doppler radar,
which might have provided five to 10 minutes advance warning of the
twisters, said forecaster Carl Williams.
   ``But there's just no way that you can say that it could have
done that,'' Williams said in a telephone interview. ``It's a
primitive system and I don't think it's being out had any effect at
all.''
   Williams said the Doppler radar has not been in wide use in most
weather service offices, but an ``add-on'' Doppler was installed in
1974 on radar equipment dating back to 1957.
   But the Doppler radar in Chicago was knocked out by lightning
hours before Tuesday's storms.
   The Doppler system can detect both those winds that are
approaching and moving away. When winds are detected moving in both
directions at the same time and at high speeds, meteorologists can
quickly determine that they are dealing with a tornado.
   A newer system called NEXRAD is being tested at the weather
service's National Severe Storms Laboratory, officials said. But
that system may not be installed until 1995, Williams said.
   The New York Times reported today that the weather service has
dispatched a team of researchers from the National Severe Storms
Laboratory at Norman, Okla., to assess the effectiveness of its
forecasters and timeliness of the alerts they issued Tuesday.
   ``We will do a complete assessment of the event,'' Robert
Maddox, director of the laboratory, told the newspaper. ``We will
look at the weather observations and the data available to forecast
offices, and if the team can agree on them we will offer
recommendations for improvements.''
   Calls to the Oklahoma lab went unanswered early today.
