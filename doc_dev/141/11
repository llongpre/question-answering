authorities blamed tornadoes for at least three deaths in the northeastern
part of that state.;    In Andover, a town of 5,000, the mayor reported
devastation.;    "The southeast part of town, especially the mobile home park,
is completely leveled. The injuries are too numerous at this point to assess,"
Finlason said.;    The Golden Spur Mobile Home Park was destroyed. Authorities
planned to search for victims there throughout the night.;    "There are
still, we're afraid, injured people trapped," said Stan Cox, a Butler County
sheriff's captain.;    A 13-year-old girl in Andover was carried 400 feet into

Finney authorized National Guard troops and Kansas Highway Patrol officers to
go to the Wichita-Andover area for reinforcements.;    In Oklahoma, one woman

Highway Patrol dispatcher Patrick Sawyer. Another person was killed near
Westport, about 25 miles west of Tulsa.;    Cars rolled up into balls;  One
person died when a tornado hit a street in Copan, a few miles south of the

"were rolled up like little balls," Topping said.;    Tonkawa, about 100 miles

him, said police Chief Frank Hall.;    Kansas lawmakers were ordered to
evacuate the Statehouse on Friday afternoon because of storms heading for

houses, farms and trees south of Beatrice as thunderstorms and hail up to the
size of golf balls pummeled the state's southeastern, eastern and northeastern
portions.;    Flooding around New Orleans;  A twister battered Grand Isle in
Louisiana. New Orleans-area subdivisions were awash in floodwater, and
unrelenting rain postponed the opening of the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage
Festival.;    The festival, attended by more than 300,000 people last year,
was put off until today because rain flooded the infield at the racetrack
where it is held.;    Intense storms pelted areas of Arkansas with hail up to
the size of golf balls and knocked out power to thousands, officials said.;
