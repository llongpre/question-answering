<LEADPARA>  Suzie Storrer jumped from her car and ran as the wind howled round her.;   
The tornado, a huge funnel of destruction, had passed through only minutes
before Friday and the road was impassable. She nearly stumbled and kicked off
her high-heeled shoes, running all the harder for home. The children, Misty
and Kelsey, were there. Storrer did not even notice that her nylons were
tearing as she ran over glass and other debris in the street.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The houses around her were gone, shattered by the force of the wind. So
great was the devastation that she could not tell where her own home had once
been. She looked around for the familiar landmarks, and they were all gone.;  
 Then she saw the girls, sitting on a curb across the street from what had
been their house. A great wave of relief swept over Storrer as she cried out
and embraced her daughters. She would find out later that Misty, her
14-year-old, had herded her 10-year-old sister, the two dogs and cat into the
basement just as the twister hit.;    This small bedroom community, just to
the east of Wichita, bore the harshest brunt of the dozens of tornadoes that
whipped through six states Friday, killing at least 29 people -- 19 of them in
Andover.;    In all, more than 70 tornadoes touched down from Texas to
Nebraska, the National Weather Service said. Twenty-six people died in Kansas
and three in Oklahoma. The twisters also left more than 200 injured and at
least 1,500 homeless.;    But the most serious damage was in and around the
Wichita area.;    "What I saw made me heartsick," said Kansas Gov. Joan Finney
after an aerial tour. "The suffering must be intense." She issued a state
disaster declaration, the first step in seeking federal assistance for the
devastated area.;    The worst tornado;  The most destructive of the tornadoes
left a path about a mile wide and 43 miles long. It first touched down
southwest of Wichita and then began, as all twisters do, to move to the
northeast. At least two trailer parks south of Wichita were destroyed and then
the tornado churned toward McConnell Air Force Base. The base hospital was
heavily damaged, the legal office was blown apart and a number of other
buildings were hit, including a wing of one of the base schools.;    The
tornado then took dead aim at Andover, a town of about 5,000. Alberta Wheeler,
who has lived in Andover with her husband, Kenneth, since 1946, was in the
kitchen of her brick home when the phone rang. It was her son, Richard,
calling from a Wichita bowling alley.;    "He said, 'Mom, hit the basement.
There's buildings falling down all over the place,' " she recounted as she sat
next to her now-roofless house. "I said that I was baking a pie and didn't
have time. And he said, 'Forget the damn pie and get to the basement!' ";   
Barely time to hide;  The basement steps were five feet from the telephone,
but the tornado was on the house by the time the Wheelers reached the bottom
steps. And, in no time, their residence of 45 years was all but gone.;    "It
just took a few minutes to tear everything up," she said. Or, as her daughter,
Holly, put it: "It looked like some hellacious giant came through and walked
on everything.";    Several hundred yards down the road, workers dug through
the Golden Spur Mobile Home Park, where all of the dead of Andover were found.
The trailer park was flattened, as if all of the 290 mobile homes had been put
through a shredding machine. The search for bodies continued through the
morning and afternoon, while some residents complained that officials were not
allowing them back into the area quickly enough to sift through the ruins and
salvage what they could.;    Down the block, Lonnie Bartlett picked up a
pizza, walked home and looked out the back window. He raced to the basement,
along with his wife and son.;    "It wasn't even that noisy," said Bartlett.
"It was kind of a swoosh.";    Like the others, his house is gone.;    A few
doors down, the Inglands crouched under the basement stairs and then looked up
to see daylight because their house had been flattened. Then, cautiously, they
made their way out.;    'Like gophers';  "It was like gophers popping their
heads up," Andy Ingland said, describing the post-tornado scene as his
neighbors in the subdivision reappeared.;    Throughout the day, like others
in this devastated area, residents looked for their belongings. A car in
Ingland's front yard was crunched like a soda can that had been stepped on,
and he pointed out a heavily damaged Honda yards away. No one seemed to know
who owned either car, or how far the cars had traveled before coming to rest.;
   Ingland said he had seen the tornado coming, watched it grow stronger and
more menacing as it approached.;    "That cloud was so big, so dark," he said.
"We just kept hoping the thing would lift up, but it just kept coming and
coming.";    During the day, he and his wife and friends had packed up what
could be salvaged from the wreckage, and not all the news was bad. The clothes
were dirty but could be cleaned. He had found his wallet. They had found all
of his wife's jewelry on the floor. And, of course, they were alive.;    "I'll
tell you what, I'll never own another house that doesn't have a basement," he
said.;    Fickle destruction;  As with almost all twisters, there was a
certain fickleness about this one. Ingland's living room was destroyed, but a
statue remained untouched on the fireplace mantel. Only one dish fell from
Alberta Wheeler's china hutch, while a piece of lumber pierced her wall only a
few feet away.;    At Suzie Storrer's, the family was able to find her
husband's wedding ring and her engagement ring -- but not the refrigerator or
washer and dryer.  </TEXT>
