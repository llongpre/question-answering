   At least a dozen tornadoes Tuesday battered
south-central Kansas, killing a 6-year-old boy and another person,
injuring 14 others and extensively damaging more than 100 homes,
authorities said.
   Tornadoes also blew through sections of Iowa, Oklahoma and
Nebraska, causing widespread property damage, but no serious
injuries, authorities said.
   In Hesston, authorities were searching for two missing people.
   The town of about 3,000 poeple ``took a direct hit and there is
major damage,'' said a dispatcher with the Kansas Highway Patrol in
Wichita.
   Gov. Mike Hayden traveled to Hesston, which was left without
electricity.
   About 40 percent to 50 percent of the town sustained major
damage from the tornado, and debris was strewn everywhere, said
Phillip Kloster, manager of the nearby town of Newton who was
helping at the command post in Hesston.
   Thirteen people hurt in the Kansas twisters were taken to the
Newton Medical Center, about eight miles south of Hesston, said
spokeswoman Chris McKellip. Most had scratches, cuts and bruises.
   A 56-year-old woman who'd been traveling through Hesston when
the twister struck was treated for a broken arm at Wesley Medical
Center in Wichita, said a hospital spokeswoman.
   A dozen tornadoes touched down within a wide area of
south-central Kanas after 4:30 p.m., and continued into the
evening, said Highway Patrol Trooper Martin Berneking.
   ``We have approximately between 75 and 100 homes that have been
anywhere from completely destroyed to fairly seriously damaged,''
said Hesston city administrator Jay Wieland. At least five
businesses were destroyed and 15 were damaged.
   ``Surprisingly, we have very few people at this point who are
reported missing,'' Wieland said. ``We have temporary housing set
up at the high school and at the college. We have National Guard on
their way in now to help secure the area.''
   About 50 people went to Hesston High School's gym to spend the
night, said Principal Marvin Estes.
   The 6-year-old boy died at a home south of Burrton, which is
about 15 miles southwest of Hesston, when a chimney and fireplace
collapsed into a basement, said Harvey County Sheriff's
Investigator Byron Motter. Another child suffered minor head wounds
in the basement, where seven people had sought shelter from the
storm.
   Another person died in a home near the small town of Goessel,
which is about 10 miles northwest of Hesston, said Marion County
Sheriff Ed Davies. The victim's name was not released.
   In Hesston, the home of Charla Buscher, 14, was seriously
damaged by the twister.
   ``We're all really shook up,'' said Charla. ``A lot of the
houses here are leveled ... We had a car wash. It's gone.
   ``The northwest corner of Hesston is just, it's gone,'' she
said. ``There's nothing left. It just looks like as if it's just
starting construction''
   At a Pizza Hut, about 15 customers and employees took cover from
the storm in a walk-in freezer and two bathrooms, ``the two safest
places in the building,'' said restaurant supervisor John Anderson.
The storm tore the roof off the restaurant, but no one was injured.
   ``I was outside and I heard it roaring,'' said Dennis Eck, an
employee at a gas station, ``I flipped switches and we hit the
deck. The pumps are all torn up. We've got roof damage.''
   Eck said businesses north of his service station were
demolished, and that the post office suffered extensive damage.
   Civil Defense workers were on the scene. Initial reports said
the worst damage in Hesston was on the western edge of town.
   Wieland said power would be restored in a day and a half to two
days, and that emergency repairs were being made to water service.
   In the small eastern Iowa town of Worthington, a tornado
destroyed the fire house, 10 homes and three businesses, disaster
officials said. Fifty residents left homeless sought shelter with
the Red Cross.
   About 10 miles southwest of Worthingin, a twister leveled at
least three houses and damaged 13 farms, said Disaster Services
Director Dianne De Sotel.
   ``People were spotting them everywhere,'' she said.
