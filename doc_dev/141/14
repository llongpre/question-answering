   Rescue workers alternated between
exhilaration at finding the living beneath beams and shattered
glass and despair over holding dead children in their arms as they
dug through the rubble left by tornadoes.
   ``It will be many nights before I have a good night's sleep
again,'' said Will County Executive Charles Adelman, who helped
comb a cornfield next to the Crest Hill Lake apartment complex.
   At least eight died at the complex Tuesday as tornadoes skipped
through several northern Illinois towns, killing at least 24 people
in Joliet, 40 miles southwest of Chicago, neighboring Crest Hill,
and Plainfield to the Northwest. At least 293 people were treated
at hospitals.
   Four of the dead, including a 4-month-old baby, were found flung
into the cornfield next to the nine-building apartment complex.
   ``People were literally blown out of the building,'' said Crest
Hill Mayor Don Randich. Two of the dead were found in cars nearby
and two others were found in the building's rubble.
   Six of the apartment buildings were gutted and three had parts
of their roofs blown away. Clothing, cars and appliances were
strewn across the landscape.
   ``When the storm went through ... some of the buildings were
disintegrated,'' said Lockport Fire Chief Dave Martis, who was in
charge of the rescue effort at the site.
   At least 150 volunteer rescue workers rushed to the site,
including officers from more than 30 area police and fire
departments, said Plainfield Police Chief Don Bennett.
   Rescuers went from apartment to apartment, throwing rubble off
of the three-story buildings with shovels _ or just their hands.
   Workers searched each building twice, sifting through debris
until well after dark.
   Volunteers aided by dogs, floodlights, cranes and bulldozers
looked for bodies. A National Guard helicopter shone a floodlight
on the cornfield.
   Though some workers wanted to keep looking through the night,
Martis called off the effort at 9:30 p.m. He said it was too dark
and dangerous to continue.
   National Guardsmen and fire officials resumed the search today.
   In Joliet, four people died, including three in a subdivision
where some houses were still under construction, said Joliet Police
Chief Dennis Nowicki.
   ``I had a little baby die in my arms ... and a little girl,''
said a Joliet paramedic who did not identify himself. ``The last
thing she said was she wanted her mommy, and her mommy was laying
there next to her dead, too.''
