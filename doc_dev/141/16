   More rain fell today in the saturated South after
deadly storms unleashed more than 20 tornadoes across Texas,
shattering one town and forcing hundreds to leave their homes in
low-lying areas.
   One tornado killed a woman, and four people were swept to their
deaths in swollen creeks. The body of the fifth victim, a
12-year-old boy, was found in a creek west of Ennis today. Fifty
people suffered storm-related injuries.
   Thunderstorms lingered over southeastern Texas, eastern Oklahoma
and western Louisiana this morning. Rain was forecast for today
from the Mississippi Valley across eastern parts of the Central
Plains, Oklahoma, eastern Texas, western Mississippi, western
Tennessee, western Kentucky, Illinois and Wisconsin.
   Although the severity of the thunderstorms over Texas lessened
this morning, new flash flood watches and warnings and some tornado
watches were posted throughout the state because of the likelihood
of more rain, especially in the Houston area. A tornado briefly
touched down in Houston today, but there were no immediate reports
of damage.
   Elsewhere, the low pressure system that brought persistent rains
to the Northeast moved out to sea on Wednesday. But at least 100
families in northern New Jersey remained in emergency shelters as
they waited for the Passaic River to crest today about two feet
above flood level.
   A predawn tornado Wednesday ravaged the small Texas town of
Jarrell, killing a woman who had been asleep in her mobile home.
The twister roared through the town of 1,000 people 40 miles from
Austin, demolishing 33 houses, 12 mobile homes and 16 businesses,
said David Barham of the state's emergency management office.
   Thirty-nine homes were damaged, along with the school gym roof.
   The tornado sheared utility poles, pulled down power lines,
uprooted trees, overturned several cars and trucks, including six
tractor-trailers on an interstate and spread debris along a
seven-mile path, authorities said.
   About two dozen people were injured and treated at hospitals.
   ``I heard a bolt of lightning and it wasn't more than five
minutes before all hell broke loose,'' said W.G. Schurhammer, whose
apartment house was damaged. ``By the time I heard it, I dove for
the corner and the windows broke.''
   A tornado Wednesday afternoon cut a quarter-mile-wide swath for
as much as 30 miles through east Texas, destroying homes and
injuring at least nine people. A twister near Houston injured eight
people, authorities said.
   Another twister touched down six miles northwest of Lufkin,
destroying eight homes in Allentown, said Angelina County sheriff's
officers. At least nine people were injured, they said.
   On Wednesday, flooding forced hundreds of Dallas-Fort Worth area
residents to leave their homes. Floodwaters caused a levee failure
along the Trinity River in Dallas and rising tributaries were
forcing more evacuations today.
   ``You could hear the roar of the creek right behind our
trailers,'' said Don Reiter, who escaped high water Wednesday in
Kennedale. ``We didn't take anything because it came so fast. Our
cars are gone, our boats are gone. What we have on our back is just
what we have.''
   In south Dallas, a car driven by a 56-year-old woman stalled as
she tried to cross a bridge. Firefighters barricading the bridge
urged her not to attempt the crossing, said firefighter Dennis
Ground.
   Ground said the woman scrambled to the top of the car and was
told to stay there. But ``the water got so rough it just knocked
the car off. Whether she had been in it or on top of it, it still
would have occurred,'' Ground said.
   The body of 73-year-old Grand Prairie man was found in his
truck, which had been swept into a flooded creek branch. A man was
killed when his car was swept into McAnear Creek south of Fort
Worth.
   Rescuers plucked people from yards, trees and car tops. The
pilot of a radio station helicopter pulled two girls and their
mother from the roof of their car just before it was swept away in
a rain-swollen creek in Cleburne.
   Of the six emergency shelters opened by the Dallas Red Cross
Wedenesday, only two remained open this morning, said spokeswoman
Sandra Pomeroy. She didn't know how many people were in the
shelters, but said, ``We served 150 breakfasts today. We served 200
dinners last night and yesterday we served 300 lunches.''
   Bobby Valentine, manager of the Texas Rangers baseball team,
sought help from a radio station helicopter to reach two of his
horses that were trapped by rising waters behind his Fort Worth
home.
   He was able to lead the horses to safety, but his son's pony
drowned.
   ``It was something, jumping off the helicopter into water
waist-deep,'' Valentine said.
   In some parts of the state, more than 6 inches of rain fell,
boosting monthly precipitation totals already far above average.
The Dallas-Fort Worth area has received 9.62 inches of rain for the
month. The area average is 4.5 inches and the record for May is
13.66 inches.
