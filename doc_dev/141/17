   Officials in Florida and Louisiana today mourned five people
killed in storms but said they were lucky that powerful twisters
blasting out of Gulf thunderstorms hadn't caused more fatalities.
   One tornado Thursday night wracked the Florida Panhandle fishing
village of Eastpoint, killing three members of a family. It
destroyed 19 houses and narrowly missed a nursing home.
   ``We haven't found the house (where the family died) yet. Their
bodies were found several hundred yards from where the house once
was,'' said Pat McWhinnie, Franklin County sheriff's dispatcher.
   In Louisiana, cleanup efforts began today in the wake of Thursday
morning's storms. Tornadoes hit seven parishes in the southern part
of the state, killing two people in mobile homes in the town of
Grosse Tete and damaging scores of homes there and 15 miles east in
Baton Rouge.
   ``We can't imagine how more aren't dead,'' said Willie Hurdle, an
Iberville Parish official who surveyed the scene at Grosse Tete.
``This is devastating. There's about 20 houses that aren't even here
anymore.''
   About two dozen others were injured in the tornado.
   Police sealed the town off to prevent looting and used dogs to
search the rubble for bodies or survivors.
   Officials used a chain saw to free an elderly woman from the
wreckage of her home.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer toured the area by helicopter. He said two
companies of Louisiana National Guard soldiers would be sent to help
authorities enforce a night curfew to discourage looters.
   Baton Rouge Fire Chief Ron Spillman said four tornadoes touched
down 19 times in East Baton Rouge Parish, destroying or damaging
almost 70 mobile homes and 25 to 30 houses.
   From 400 to 600 people lived in the destroyed or damaged
residences, Spillman estimated. A shelter was set up at a high
school for those left homeless.
   Kimberly Carver was asleep in her mobile home at the Pecue Lake
Mobile Home Park when one of the twisters ripped through the
neighborhood.
   ``Somehow, I just ended up between the mattress and box springs.
Everything in my bedroom was flying. If I wasn't between the
mattress and the box spring, I would have gotten hurt. It happened
so fast,'' Carver said.
   Authorities reported three injuries in Baton Rouge, none serious.
   Gulf State Utilities crews worked into the morning to restore
power to about 3,500 residents in the Baton Rouge area.
   John Boss, a photographer for the State-Times in Baton Rouge, and
Rita F. Gilmer were caught in the middle of the storm near a bridge
over the Mississippi River.
   ``Two houses blew up right across the levee from where we were,''
he said. ``Limbs were snapping off trees and flying all over us. We
were afraid we were going to be hit by all the debris. I was scared
to death. It was hell.''
   In Florida, Franklin County Sheriff Warren Roddenberry said
today, ``We were extremely lucky. The devastation we've had and no
more than three fatalities and two minor injuries is just amazing.''
   A grandmother, mother and son died when the tornado hit their
home in Eastpoint, about 85 miles southwest of Tallahassee.
   Most of the demolished houses in Eastpoint were mobile homes,
officials said. Eight cars and several utility sheds also were
destroyed. A hardware store lost its roof, and a boat building
business was demolished.
   ``It was monstrous _ like the tornado in the `Wizard of Oz,' ''
said Tracey Hardman after seeing the twister. ``It was awesome.''
   The tornados were the worst to hit the Panhandle in three years,
said National Weather Service spokesman Ray Lowe.
   Earlier Thursday, a U.S. park ranger was hurt when a tornado
carried away the shelter at Gulf Islands National Seashore in which
she had taken refuge. Amanda Rhodes suffered a broken arm and cuts
when she was blown 10 to 15 yards. The 20-by-30-foot wood-frame
entrance station was demolished, officials said.
   Elsewhere in Florida, another tornado ripped the roof from a
grocery store near Perdido Key, southwest of Pensacola, causing at
estimated $75,000 to $80,000 in damage, said Cheryl Lively,
spokeswoman for the Escambia County Emergency Operations Center.
   Another tornado demolished a home near the neighboring
communities of Holley and Navarre about 20 miles east of Pensacola,
Santa Rosa County authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   Tornados and thunderstorms also swept through coastal Alabama,
damaging dozens of homes, but no serious injuries were reported,
authorities said.
