   Tony DeVita still clutched his ``tornado
pillow'' hours after killer storms ripped through the Raleigh area
today, killing five people and injuring about 150 others.
   The tornadoes scoured a five-mile path through the heavily
populated northern section of North Carolina's capital city and its
suburbs before leaping to neighboring counties. Along the way, the
tornadoes ripped up DeVita's town house.
   ``It sounded like a rush of water, followed by a bunch of
shaking,'' DeVita said. ``The roof was totally gone, the patio doors
were gone and every window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up
like someone was going to replace it.''
   DeVita, 34, grabbed a pillow and got behind his bedroom door. He
still held the pillow during an interview at a shelter in a central
Raleigh school.
   Forty-six people stayed at the shelter after the storms hit
between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m.
   ``If you felt a big, hot hair dryer blowing by you and the whole
place was shaking apart and if this (pillow) was the only thing that
protected your face, you'd hold onto it,'' DeVita said, calling it
his ``tornado pillow.''
   ``I had to dig my way out'' from the corner of the room, he said.
``I was kind of buried in rubble. In fact, I later found plaster in
my ears.''
   DeVita left his town house wearing only pajamas. He borrowed
clothes from neighbors _ a pink jacket from one, gray sweatpants
from another and socks from someone at the shelter. He still was
without shoes.
   Residents of the complex where he lived were told to evacuate
because of a gas leak. Mayor Avery Upchurch said at midmorning that
the danger of gas leaks had passed.
   DeVita and others weren't allowed to drive out because of the
leak, so they walked and waited for buses to take them to the
shelter.
   Elsewhere, when the sun rose, dazed residents emerged to survey
the destruction.
   ``My God, my God,'' said Ellie Sprankel, as she stood on a ridge
for a sweeping view of her town house subdivision and an adjacent
apartment complex in north Raleigh.
   Ms. Sprankle said she had lived eight years in Illinois and was
accustomed to tornado watches and warnings but had never experienced
one.
   ``They used to tell me it's like a freight train coming, but what
it's really like is a train on top of you,'' she said.
   Carolyn Davis surveyed her two-story town house by candle light
before sunrise. A large pine tree had slammed into her roof and its
top protruded through the ceiling into a bedroom.
   ``My insurance company is going to love this,'' she said. ``One
month, I've been here just one month. I can't believe it.''
   Jerry Thornton gasped in disbelief when he saw that a section of
his town house roof was gone.
   ``I didn't need to see that,'' Thornton said. ``What a way to end
the Thanksgiving weekend.''
