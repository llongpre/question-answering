   National Guardsmen and fire officials
searched a muddy cornfield today for more victims of tornadoes that
flattened scores of homes and killed at least 24 people.
   The dead included at least nine people found near a demolished
apartment complex where six residents were missing, Lockport Fire
Chief Dave Martis said today.
   At least 306 people were treated at hospitals after the cluster
of tornadoes touched down in four spots Tuesday afternoon, cutting
an eight-mile trail of destruction leading to the northern Illinois
city of Joliet. At least 11 people were listed in critical
condition today.
   In nearby Plainfield, residents began returning to the rubble of
their homes.
   ``It was like an eggbeater went through the inside of the
house,'' said 41-year-old Bruce Marshall as he tried to fashion a
makeshift cover for his roofless home.
   Gov. James R. Thompson declared Will County a state disaster
area, and requested that President Bush declare the area a federal
disaster to provide additional relief.
   ``Nothing in my personal experience ... compares with this,''
Thompson said during a tour of Plainfield today.
   Illinois Treasurer Jerry Cosentino announced that the state will
provide at least $25 million for low-interest loans to tornado
victims.
   Elsewhere in the Midwest, thunderstorms Tuesday halted power to
70,000 customers in central and western Ohio. A tornado touched
down south of Tecumseh in southern Michigan and storms that ripped
through northern Indiana left at least one person dead. Pat Jones,
27, was killed when the house he was building in South Bend
collapsed.
   At least two tornadoes were spotted in northwestern
Pennsylvania, but no injuries were reported.
   Preliminary tallies made in the dark from the tornadoes in
Illinois suggested more than 100 houses were destroyed, in addition
to the apartment complex and a high school. The storms blacked out
17,000 homes and businesses, tossed trucks like toys and flattened
crops.
   ``Cars were flying all over the place,'' said Tony Aloisio, who
was driving by and stopped to help. ``It happened so fast that all
I could do was sit there and watch. Then 15 minutes later the skies
got blue like it had never even happened.''
   About 30 Guardsmen took up positions in the three affected
communities overnight and 150 were to arrive later in the day to
search for victims and provide security, said Col. Phil Becker, a
National Guard brigade commander.
   At least four people were arrested for looting, and five others
were taken into custody for interfering with rescuers, authorities
said.
   ``I saw everything out there,'' said Will County Executive
Charles Adelman. ``Refrigerators, TV sets, washing machines, cars
stacked three high.''
   The twisters _ experts were unsure exactly how many _ hit
Joliet, 40 miles southwest of Chicago, neighboring Crest Hill, and
Plainfield to the northwest.
   Crest Hill Mayor Don Randich was among the first firefighters to
arrive at the apartment complex. ``There were people wandering
around, dazed,'' he said. ``Automobile horns were blowing, but
there was no one in the cars. It was total confusion.''
   Martis said the bodies of nine people were found near the
apartment complex. Seven bodies, including that of a 4-month-old
baby, were lying in a cornfield, some of them 400 feet from their
apartments, and two were found in a car nearby, Martis said.
   Rescuers went from apartment to apartment, throwing rubble off
of the three-story buildings with shovels or just their hands.
   The death toll was unclear. There were 24 confirmed fatalities
as of 8:30 a.m. today, and there may be 30 dead, said John Plunk,
acting director of the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster
Agency.
   The Red Cross said about 600 people left homeless were given
shelter.
   Michael Hejka, 28, was at a friend's house in Plainfield, a
community of 4,500, when the tornado hit. ``I saw trees bending,
and I said to my buddy, `It's a tornado!''' Hejka said. ``I said,
`Jump into the bathtub.' He jumped in, and I jumped in right on top
of him. The whole house lifted up, and then came down.''
   Plainfield High School was demolished and some of the 175
students and teachers inside were hurt. Catastrophe was averted
because coaches rushed dozens of athletes from a gym before the
roof collapsed.
   ``We had some very short warnings,'' said teacher Steve
Schernerhorn. ``We immediately took cover.''
   Teacher Mike Salisburg said cars in the parking lot were thrown
hundreds of yards.
   Will County is part of a frequently hit ``tornado alley.'' A
tornado hit Plainfield Township in 1984, injuring six people and
demolishing 14 homes. In 1976, a twister hit Lemont, 10 miles from
Plainfield, killing three people and injuring as many as 40. That
tornado damaged 375 houses and businesses.
