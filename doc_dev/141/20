   A swarm of tornadoes and powerful storms struck the Midwest with
high winds and hail, killing a construction worker, damaging roofs,
knocking down power lines and leaving thousands blacked out today.
   More than 80 tornadoes or tornado-like storms touched down
Sunday _ 32 in Illinois, 25 in Wisconsin and 22 in Iowa and one
each in Indiana and Arkansas, and at least 160 reports of
thunderstorms with wind gusts over 50 mph, some with baseball-sized
hail, the weather service said.
   One man, a 39-year-old construction worker, was killed Sunday
night when a house he was building collapsed on him in high winds
in Crown Point, Ind., about 15 miles south of Gary, officials said
today.
   Sunday marked the region's second day of violent weather. In
rural Gretna, Neb., a 29-year-old woman and her 2-year-old daughter
died after a tornado struck their mobile home Saturday night.
   Storm damage reports covered eastern Kansas, northeast Texas,
from Arkansas through southern Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois and
western Kentucky.
   In eastern Iowa, more than 5,000 Iowa-Illinois Gas &amp; Electric
Co. customers were without power for several hours Sunday, and
several thousand Iowa Power And Light Co. customers were blacked
out in the Des Moines area.
   A car show near Rockford, Ill., ended as 81-mph winds tossed
tents, debris, and portable toilets. ``One outhouse flew right past
me and then I got hit by another one as I was running away,'' said
Dwight Dunlop, 21.
   The winds toppled a 60-foot-by-180-foot big top tent and pulled
out dozens of metal stakes that were driven into the ground. A sign
reading, ``Not responsible for damage,'' was all that remained
standing.
   At Winsome Park, a nearby apartment complex, high winds lifted a
10-car garage away from the vehicles it sheltered and threw it into
another building.
   In the Chicago area, winds gusted up to 55 mph, downing trees
and wires. Commonwealth Edison officials said high winds caused
electricity to be cut off to about 40,000 people in the Chicago
area, but by midmorning power had been restored to all but about
6,000 customers.
   An air traffic controller at Chicago's Midway Airport complained
of a sandstorm as strong winds swept through the city. Midway and
O'Hare airport officials said some flights were delayed by the
storm.
   Mort Edelstein, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration, said the weather-related problems were compounded
by a major fire at an Illinois Bell switching center in suburban
Hinsdale.
   ``The regular telephone lines linking the Chicago-area (air)
control center in Aurora with the towers at Midway and O'Hare go
through Hinsdale,'' Edelstein explained. ``Both towers switched
immediately to backup communications systems, but the bad weather
was nearing Midway, so approaches there were stopped.''
   Edelstein said that after the worst of the weather passed,
planes were allowed to take off from Midway, and the airport was
reopened to approaching flights after several hours. There was
little effect on O'Hare, he said.
   A tornado touched down near Elwood, Ill., southwest of Joliet
shortly after 7 p.m. Sunday, tearing the roof off a condominium,
but no injuries were reportd, the National Weather Service said.
   In East Peoria, high winds ripped part of the roof off a popular
seafood restaurant, doing an estimated $200,000 damage. Authorities
said about 225 diners were inside the restaurant at the time, but
no one was injured.
   In north-central Wisconsin, two people were hospitalized with
injuries after high winds with rain and hail struck their mobile
homes in Marathon County. The extent of their injuries was not
immediately known.
   ``We've had several roofs blown off, power lines knocked down,
numerous reports of trees down, I'd say 20 or 30 reports,'' said
Jack Burbank, a civil defense official for Columbia County, just
south of Marathon.
   Thunderstorms with high winds rumbled across the northern half
of Indiana on Sunday, damaging buildings in Benton County and
Lebanon and injuring one person when a mobile home was blown over
in Wabash County, authorities said.
   A tornado with ice cube-size hail brought down trees and power
lines Sunday near Arkadelphia in southwest Arkansas, but no
injuries were reported.
