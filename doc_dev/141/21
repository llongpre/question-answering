   National Guardsmen were called out in Illinois and Kentucky as
cleanup began Sunday in three states struck by tornadoes that
injured more than 50 people and damaged or destroyed scores of homes
and businesses.
   Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and said he
planned to declare the town a state disaster area on Monday. He also
sent about 100 National Guardmen to prevent looting and help clean
up the town, where more than a third of the homes and commercial
buildings were destroyed in the Saturday evening storm.
   ``It's a mess. It's awful,'' Thompson said.
   ``It looks like this place has been bombed,'' said Jack Loeffler,
mayor of the community in southeastern Illinois.
   In Indiana, three people were injured in one county, and another
county estimated damage at half a million dollars. In south-central
Kentucky, a twister caused at least $10 million in damage to
businesses and homes in and around Franklin.
   Tornadoes in wintertime are unusual but not unheard of, according
to officials at the National Weather Service. A tornado Dec. 24
killed one person, injured 15 and destroyed 20 buildings in two
Nashville, Tenn., suburbs.
   In Allendale, about 130 miles east of St. Louis near the Indiana
border, a tornado Saturday evening cut through a 10-block area that
makes up about half the town of 600, leveling buildings and
uprooting dozens of trees.
   Loeffler said 53 homes and nine businesses were destroyed. An
additional 28 homes were severely damaged and 30 sustained some
damage. The post office, fire station, city hall and a school were
all destroyed, he said.
   ``The east half of the town's gone,'' said Marvin Jones, an
ambulance driver. ``Most of the streets are blocked by wires and
trees and debris. ... Belongings are scattered everywhere.''
   ``It's a mess is all you you can say,'' said a resident, Linda
Griesemer.
   Six to eight people were trapped in the rubble but were rescued
Saturday evening and brought to hospitals, Loeffler said.
   ``We feel very fortunate. To the best of our knowledge, there
have been no fatalities,'' the mayor said.
   About 45 people from in and around Allendale, including at least
six children, were treated at Wabash General Hospital in Mount
Carmel, said spokeswoman Elaine Shaw. Four were treated at Lawrence
County Memorial Hospital in Lawrenceville.
   Twenty-seven patients remained hospitalized Sunday at Wabash and
seven at other hospitals, Ms. Shaw said. She said some were in
critical condition, but did not know how many.
   In Indiana, the same storm system spawned a twister that injured
three people and damaged or destroyed 30 homes and about 25 to 30
farm buildings in the St. Thomas area southeast of Vincennes in
southwestern Indiana.
   The injured were treated at a hospital and released.
   The twister came within a mile of a highs school, where 2,500
people were watching a basketball game when the storm knocked the
power out.
   Later, near Forest Hill in central Indiana, the storm damaged
several houses and farm buildings in a sparsely populated area,
causing an estimated $500,000 damage, said Sheriff's Deputy Jim
Baylis. No injuries were reported.
   In south-central Kentucky, a tornado struck near midnight in
outlying areas of Franklin, causing an estimated $10 million to $12
million in damage to businesses and homes, Simpson County
Judge-Executive Ken Harper said Sunday.
   ``Miraculously, no one was injured,'' Harper said after touring
the stricken areas in the community of 7,700.
   The roof was blown off an ambulance garage at the
Franklin-Simpson Memorial Hospital. Damage also was reported to 25
homes and to 15 businesses in and near Franklin.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson authorized sending Kentucky National Guard
troops to help prevent looting and keep traffic flowing, said David
Adkinson, operations manager for Kentucky Disaster and Emergency
Services.
   About 20 military police officers from the guard's Louisville
unit were being sent to Franklin, he said.
   Minutes before the twister tore through Allendale, tornadoes hit
nearby Mill Shoals and Albion, officials said.
   In Mill Shoals, two or three mobile homes were overturned and a
couple of homes and several farm buildings were damaged, said state
police Sgt. John Muensterman. In Albion, five buildings were
damaged, said Mayor Earl Bailey.
   People whose homes were destroyed planned to stay with friends or
relatives in town, and about a dozen were taken to a shelter in
nearby St. Francisville, said Wabash County Sheriff Randy Grounds.
