condominium and strewing debris, the National Weather Service said.
Several other tornadoes touched down in Illinois, and aircraft were
overturned at the Rockford, Ill., airport as winds gusted to 81 mph.
   Showers and thunderstorms were accompanied by heavy rain and
hail from southwestern Wisconsin and southeastern Minnesota through
central and southwestern Iowa, western Missouri and eastern Kansas
into eastern Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   More than two dozen tornadoes swept through southeast Iowa,
damaging several homes near Ottumwa and tipping over mobile homes

power lines. No injuries were reported in either state.
   Late Saturday, a tornado struck a mobile home southwest of

   Hail up to 2{ inches in diameter fell just west of Lawrence,

   Wind gusts of 50 mph were clocked while the storms crossed
central Iowa and tree limbs were reported blown down at

   To the south, showers and thunderstorms moved into northern
Louisiana and southern Arkansas, with one-inch hail reported at

western Tennessee into northern Alabama. Behind the front, showers
were scattered from central South Dakota into the Nebraska
