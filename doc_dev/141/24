   Residents of three states today struggled
to recover from tornadoes that destroyed a third of the buildings in
this southeastern Illinois town and injured more than four dozen
people.
   ``It looks like this place has been bombed,'' Mayor Jack Loeffler
said Sunday from an emergency command post in a bank.
   Twisters hit the Illinois towns of Mill Shoals, Albion and
Allendale on Saturday afternoon before moving into Indiana and
touching down near Vincennes. Late Saturday, a tornado cut a
two-mile path through the southern Kentucky community of Franklin.
   Fifty people were injured in Illinois, and 22 remained
hospitalized Sunday. The three people injured in Indiana were
released from hospitals by Sunday; no injuries were reported in
Kentucky.
   ``After seeing everything that's happened, we were pretty lucky
no folks were hurt,'' said Simpson County Judge-Executive Ken Harper
in Kentucky.
   The National Guard was sent to the tornado-ravaged areas of
Illinois and Kentucky to help with the cleanup and to prevent
looting.
   Loeffler said the tornado cut through a 10-square-block area of
Allendale, destroying 53 homes and nine businesses, as well as the
post office, fire station, city hall and a school.
   On Sunday, the National Guard and other emergency workers cleared
trees and power lines that had been knocked down and other rubble
from streets, but hadn't made much headway on houses, said Gen.
Donald Lynn.
   Police said people whose homes were destroyed were staying with
friends or relatives in town, and about a dozen were taken to
shelters.
   Shocked officials and residents of this town of 600 assessed the
damage Sunday.
   ``It's a mess is all you can say,'' said Allendale resident Linda
Griesemer. ``Houses are flattened, windows blowed out, roofs gone.''
   A damage estimate was not yet available, Loeffler said.
   Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and flew over the other
affected areas. He said he planned to declare Allendale a state
disaster area.
   ``It's a mess. It's awful,'' Thompson said. The tornado ``not
only took out a third of the homes, it took out almost the entire
downtown and all the public facilities.''
   In Mill Shoals, two or three mobile homes were overturned and a
few homes and farm buildings were damaged. In Albion, five buildings
were damaged but there were no injuries, said Mayor Earl Bailey.
   In Indiana, a twister came within a mile of Vincennes Lincoln
High School, where 2,500 people were watching a junior varsity
basketball game when the storm knocked the school's power out.
   ``People are moving back into their homes and salvaging what they
can,'' Sheriff's Deputy Jerry Reitmeyer said Sunday. ``We were lucky
last night. It didn't rain anymore after the tornado, so not a lot
of homes were water-soaked.
   ``One or two homes are really damaged extensively enough that the
people won't be able to live in them.''
   Five homes were destroyed and 25 were damaged by the tornado that
hit Franklin, Ky.
   ``It came and went so quickly that some people slept through it,
didn't know it had happened,'' Harper said.
   William Huff said he went to his front door to investigate the
booming sounds of the tornado.
   ``I opened the front door, and the next thing I know, the house
was gone,'' Huff said. His two-bedroom house was leveled.
