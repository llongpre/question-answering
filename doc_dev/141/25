   A powerful storm rose out of the Gulf of Mexico on Thursday and
surged through the South, spinning off tornadoes that ripped apart
homes, toppled trees and injured dozens of people.
   The tornadoes touched down along the Gulf Coast of Mississippi
and in several places in rural Alabama. A powerful blast of wind
also swept through Columbus, Ga., but weather officials were
uncertain whether it was a tornado.
   Heavy thunderstorms or rainshowers also were reported from
Florida to Michigan, posing a threat of floods in some places. The
wet weather was the result of low pressure that was pulling
moisture northward out of the Gulf.
   The first two tornadoes were reported shortly after midnight in
the Gulf Coast town of Pass Christian, Miss., where at least 30
homes were damaged, the National Weather Service said.
   The storm drove northeastward during the night and a tornado
touched down just before dawn in Opp, Ala., damaging more than 40
homes and two businesses, and destroying two mobile homes.
   ``It shook our whole building when it came through, and we're in
a concrete building,'' said Robert Booth, a reporter with radio
station WOPP.
   The twister knocked out power, covered streets with the mangled
remains of trees and blew out windows. Ten people were injured, one
seriously enough to be hospitalized.
   Later tornadoes were reported in Pike and Barbour counties, to
the northwest of Opp.
   Three people were critically injured in Pike County, where the
twister hit about 10 miles south of the town of Troy. It ripped
apart three mobile homes and deposited a pickup truck in a tree.
   A spokeswoman at Edge Regional Medical Center in Troy said two
women, ages 86 and 44, and a 67-year-old man were listed in
critical condition.
   At South Macon High School in Alabama's Macon County, secretary
Portia Johnson said 11 girls suffered cuts and scrapes when the
ceiling collapsed in a girl's restroom about 7:30 a.m.
   In Auburn, an elementary school was closed after two trees
crashed into the building. The high winds also leveled a U.S.
Department of Agriculture barn and tore part of the roof off the
campus police station at Auburn University.
   In Columbus, Ga., which is just across the border from Alabama,
the storm struck with tornado-like winds shortly after 9 a.m.
   The storm ripped the roof off a service station, knocked out
power and phone service in parts of the downtown area and injured
two people, who were treated for lacerations and released from the
Medical Center, officials said.
   Wind damage also was reported in LaGrange, Ga., where two mobile
homes were destroyed and about eight other homes were damaged.
Trees also were uprooted, but no injuries were reported.
