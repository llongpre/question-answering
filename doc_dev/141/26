<TEXT>     The Andover Methodist Church was crammed with clothing donated to the 1,500
residents who were left homeless by the twister that flattened a mobile home
park and destroyed 88 houses and 11 businesses Friday night.;    In a big
meeting room, workers sorted 3,000 pounds of clothing donated by people,
churches and businesses. Andover Primary School's gymnasium was filled with
rows of donated food.;    "I bet some stores aren't stocked this well," Red
Cross volunteer Marvin Keeler said.;    Fourteen residents of the town's
40-acre Golden Spur Mobile Home Park were killed when a tornado destroyed 226
trailers and heavily damaged 15. Earlier reports had placed the town's death
toll at 20.;    Three Wichita residents were killed and two other fatalities
were reported in outlying Kansas counties -- bringing the Kansas total from
the storm to 19. Three people were killed just over the state line in
Oklahoma, for a total of 22 dead.;    The Kansas count had been reported at
20, but officials discovered that a Wichita man who was killed in Oklahoma
while returning from a business trip had been counted in both states.;   
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent condolences today to President
George Bush for victims of the tornadoes, the news agency Tass reported in
Moscow.;    Kansas Gov. Joan Finney today asked President Bush for help in
recovering from the tornadoes, and the White House said Bush would act quickly
on a formal disaster declaration.;    The Andover School Board suspended
classes today because school buildings were being used in the recovery
effort.;    The town's lone civil defense siren, only about a quarter mile
from the demolished mobile home park, never sounded. Local officials said they
tried four times in the 20 minutes before the tornado struck to make it work.;
   In response, authorities said police and fire units sped through the area,
using sirens and loudspeakers to notify residents.;    Some survivors,
however, said they were not aware of the police and fire warnings.;    During
the memorial, worshipers sang the hymn "We'll Understand It Better By and By."
Another hymn told of God being a "shelter from the stormy blast.";    Fewer
than 100 people attended, probably because victims wanted to use the remaining
daylight to look for belongings in the rubble, organizers said.;    The newly
homeless continued to find lost treasures under the mobile home frames, which
were twisted like giant steel pretzels.;    "We just found our cat. She's
alive," said Renee Berggren. "She had been bulldozed under.";    "There's the
quilt I made! I just don't believe it!" Kathy Schultz shouted to a friend,
pulling the colorful item from the debris.  </TEXT>
