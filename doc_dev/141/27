   A state of emergency was declared in
Indiana in the trail of twisters that killed at least nine people,
injured more than 100 and littered the Midwest with debris,
authorities said.
   At least 130 people were injured Saturday night in Indiana in
about four tornadoes that touched down 50 times or more in the state.
   Eight people were reported killed in Indiana and one person was
left dead in Illinois, officials said. A few of the injuries in
Indiana were critical, state officials said.
   Elsewhere, twisters or tornado-force winds downed trees, knocked
out power and damaged homes and businesses in Kansas, Kentucky,
Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh sent the state's National Guard to Bedford
and Petersburg, the two hardest hit areas in southern Indiana.
   The Indiana National Guard dispatched medical workers, engineers
and ambulances to the region, where state police set up a temporary
command post to assist injured and homeless residents.
   A temporary morgue was set up at a fire station in Petersburg, a
city of 4,000 people about 40 miles north of Evansville.
   ``It's like a war zone,'' said Ed Thurman of nearby Vincennes,
who walked through Petersburg early today to view damage.
   ``Half of the town was destroyed,'' Thurman said. ``Homes,
businesses, an elementary school. It went right down the main
street. The mayor's house was demolished.''
   Temporary shelters in churches quickly filled up in Petersburg,
where flooding two weeks ago chased people from their homes, Thurman
said.
   Randy Harris of radio station WFPC in Petersburg said he was home
when disaster struck.
   ``It was just a very strong roar, almost like a low-flying jet,''
he said.
   Phil Roberts, deputy director of the Indiana Department of
Emergency Management, said eight people were confirmed killed in
Indiana _ four in Petersburg, two in nearby Union, one in Bedford,
which is 70 miles south of Indianapolis, and one in Putnam County.
   Jerry Hauer, director of the state emergency management agency,
initially had reported three people were killed in Bedford, but
Roberts said early today that figure was based on reports from local
authorities who later changed their count.
   One woman was killed in Putnam County when her mobile home
overturned, said Hendricks County sheriff's Lt. Steve Golden.
Details on the other deaths in Indiana remained sketchy early today.
   The tornadoes were deemed the most destructive to hit Indiana
since 1974, when about a dozen twisters touched down, Hauer said.
   A woman in the small, southeastern Illinois town of Browns was
killed and at least eight people in nearby Findlay and Newton were
injured by tornadoes, officials said.
   Electricity and gas service was turned off in Findlay, where
about 800 people live, for fear of leaks. Eleven homes were
destroyed and 25 others were damaged in the area.
   Hospitals around the Bedford and Petersburg areas treated many of
the Indiana injured, Roberts said. Utility service was knocked out
in those areas. Mike Garvey, a medical specialist for the Indiana
emergency management agency, said at least 75 people were injured in
the Bedford and Petersburg areas. Fewer than ten were critically
injured, he said.
   Among the injured were 27 people in a Bedford restaurant that was
destroyed, Roberts said. A service station and convenience store
were destroyed south of Bedford, witnesses said.
   Indiana State Police in Lafayette reported extensive damage in
Montgomery County about 25 miles northwest of Indianapolis. At least
two tornadoes touched down in that region.
   ``Some houses are reported gone,'' state police Cpl. Dave Murray
said of Montgomery County.
   Elsewhere:
   _In Wisconsin, several thousand residents of Fond du Lac, an
eastern Wisconsin city of 36,000, were temporarily without electric
service as tree limbs tore down transmission lines. No serious
injuries were reported.
   _In Minnesota, thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 70 mph and
hail moved across southeastern and east-central parts of the state.
A tornado damaged four farms Saturday one mile east of Goodhue in
southeastern Minnesota, but no injuries were reported, authorities
said.
   _ In Ohio, a tornado damaged several homes and destroyed a
restaurant in Harrison, outside Cincinnati, the National Weather
Service said. No serious injuries were reported.
   _ In Kentucky, a tornado overturned a house trailer and damaged
three others in the town of West Liberty, and two possible tornadoes
were reported elsewhere in the state, said police and the weather
service. No injuries were immediately reported.
   _ In Michigan, a tornado touched down in Big Praire Township,
damaging some of the many vacation trailers in an area where many
retirees live, said Newago County sheriff's dispatcher Bob Bain. No
injuries were reported and the extent of the damage was not
immediately known, he said.
   _ In Kansas, winds that reached 70 mph tore roofs from homes
throughout the city of Hutchinson. Downed power lines knocked out
power to nearly 50,000 homes and sparked grass fires.
