   Tornados killed a child, injured at
least 14 others and damaged scores of buildings in northern and
western Oklahoma, authorities said.
   One twister, bearing winds of 100 mph, cut a mile-long swath in
Stillwater, hitting residential areas and the Oklahoma State
University campus. At least three other tornadoes touched down in
Oklahoma Tuesday night.
   A 4-year-old was killed in Stillwater as his mother drove to a
relative's home to take shelter, authorities said. Authorities said
the mother, who was cut, was unable to explain exactly what
happened when the storm overtook them.
   Damage was reported to six apartment complexes and other homes,
businesses and schools in this town of 40,000.
   About 40 units at a housing unit on the university campus was
reported damaged, and the storm tore part of the roof off the
physical education center.
   At least seven other people in Stillwater were treated for
injuries. The worst injury was a 75-year-old man who broke a hip.
   A twister hit the ground around midnight in Foyil, injuring at
least six people as it plowed across four miles of farmland.
   A tornado ripped off a roof near Kellyville in Oklahoma, and a
twister in western Oklahoma terrorized patrons and workers inside
an El Reno truck stop when it touched down near Interstate 40.
   With power lines down, residents of Stillwater and Foyil waited
for daylight today to reveal the extent of the damage.
   ``I'm going to go back tomorrow and see what happened,'' said
Stillwater resident Jean Annesley, who spent the night in a Red
Cross shelter after her home was hit. ``It's going to kill me. But
I'll survive it.''
   Mike Field stood in his yard and looked at the wreckage from a
school roof that littered the inside and outside of his heavily
damaged house. He and his family had made it to shelter.
   ``When we were driving back, I saw a lot of trees down and
thought that maybe the trees here in my front yard would be
damaged,'' Field said.
   ``We turned the corner, the first thing I saw was the roof gone.
My wife started crying. What are you going to do?''
