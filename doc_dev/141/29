   A violent storm front packing tornado-like winds and at least
one confirmed tornado racked parts of Georgia and Alabama this
morning, flipping trailer homes and downing trees and power lines
and critically injuring three people.
   Initial damage reports from Columbus, Ga., where the tornado
touchdown was confirmed, were sketchy. In Alabama, authorities
reported serious damage and injuries near Opp, which was hit by
tornado-like winds shortly before dawn, and to the northeast in
Pike County,.
   ``It shook our whole building when it came through, and we're in
a concrete building,'' said Robert Booth, a radio reporter with
station WOPP in Opp, a town of 7,000 about 60 miles north of the
Gulf of Mexico.
   The storm hit the town at about 5:50 a.m., knocking out power
and covering streets with the mangled remains of trees. Witnesses
said windows were blown out in downtown stores, and some
neighborhoods showed widespread damage.
   At least 15 injures were reported in Alabama. Six people
required hospitalization, including three who were critically
injured in Pike County when a twister or tornado-force winds
demolished trailer homes. The entire state remained under a flash
flood watch.
   The storm system coursed into Georgia from the southwest,
sending a tornado spinning into Columbus at about 9:15 a.m.
   ``We have no severe damage that we know about,'' said Joy
Burnham, the city's emergency management director. She said some
damage was reported at a car dealership, and some roofs and trees
were blown down.
   Phone lines were down in the downtown Columbus area, according
to Southern Bell spokeswoman Lynne Bress. Georgia Power Co.
spokeswoman Meg Reggie said only a few hundred customers were
without power.
   It was the second tornado in downtown Columbus this month. On
Feb. 10, the city was hit by one of several twisters that touched
down in Georgia during a storm.
   In northern Georgia, where 10 inches or more of rain fell on
some sections last week, the National Weather Service predicted up
to 2 inches of rain today as the storms moved through.
   ``Everybody up here's praying for good things to happen,'' said
Trion Mayor Hoyt Williams, whose town was one of the worst hit by
the earlier rain. ``I don't know what protective measures to take.
Do you?''
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris has asked for $15.7 million in
federal disaster aid for nine counties _ Carroll, Chattooga, Cobb,
Douglas, Fannin, Gilmer, Gordon, Murray and Walker _ because of
recent floods and tornadoes.
   A flash flood watch issued by the National Weather Service for
today covered an area that included Atlanta, Athens and Rome.
   Harris estimated Monday that storms since Feb. 10 have killed
six people and injured 32 in the state. He said 39 homes were
destroyed, while 470 houses and 129 businesses were damaged.
   In Alabama, the most severe damage today appeared to follow a
northeast path from Opp through Pike County into Barbour County. In
Pike County, officials said four people were injured in mobile
homes and a pickup truck was blown into a tree; in Barbour County,
sheriff's deputy R.H. Johnson said four house trailers were damaged.
   Trees and power lines also were snapped off in Chambers, Lee,
Tallapoosa, Bullock and Houston counties, and the wind was clocked
at 76 mph in Dothan.
   An elementary school in Auburn was closed after high winds sent
two trees crashing into the building. No injuries were reported. A
middle school at Auburn also was closed by a power outage.
