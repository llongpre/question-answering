   Severe thunderstorms raked parts of the Midwest Saturday,
causing widespread flooding and at least two deaths in Iowa and
Illinois. Tornadoes destroyed five houses in South Dakota and
ripped through a Nebraska town.
   Hundreds of Iowans were forced to evacuate their homes when up
to 6 inches of rain fell over parts of the state, and roads and
bridges were washed out. An 11-year-old girl was killed when she
was swept into a culvert in the Davenport suburb of LeClaire on the
Mississippi River, Scott County authorities said.
   Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad declared seven eastern and central
counties disaster areas and sent the National Guard to help sandbag
low-lying areas as rivers and creeks overflowed.
   The Weather Service said more thunderstorms and heavy rain were
likely overnight as a front of moist, unstable air moved through
the upper Midwest.
   In South Dakota, a tornado ripped a nine-mile path through
Beresford, 35 miles south of Sioux Falls, damaging 30 to 50 homes,
said Beresford Fire Chief T.A. Mullinex. He said about five homes
were destroyed but no deaths or injuries were reported.
   In Nebraska, a tornado hit the northeastern town of Madison
Saturday night, causing widespread damage just hours after areas
had been evacuated because of flooding, officials said.
   Part of the roof of the IBP Inc. meat packing plant was torn off
by the storm, said a woman who answered the plant's phone. She
wouldn't give her name.
   ``There are trees down everywhere, roofs off of houses all over
town, and gas lines ruptured,'' said Madison police Officer Mike
Bowersox. ``It moved right through the middle of town.''
   He said there were no immediate reports of deaths or injuries in
the community of 2,000 about 100 miles northwest of Omaha. Another
tornado touched down further north near O'Neill earlier Saturday,
damaging two farms, in Nebraska's fifth straight day of severe
storms.
   Heavy rains also lashed western Illinois Saturday. A train
engineer was killed and three people were injured when a Burlington
Northern freight engine derailed at a washed-out bridge near
Morrison, Ill., authorities said.
   ``The train collapsed the weakened bridge and the two engines
with approximately 28 cars began a chain reaction collision,'' said
a Whiteside County sheriff's dispatcher. ``Workers were trapped in
the engine because they came to rest in about 15 feet of water and
mud from the swollen ditch.''
   The engineer's identity was not released. The injured were
treated at a hospital and released.
   In Iowa, scattered flooding was reported throughout the state.
Branstad declared Polk, Warren, Dallas and Jasper counties in
central Iowa and Johnson, Scott and Muscatine counties in eastern
Iowa disaster areas.
   Six inches of rain overnight brought the Raccoon River out of
its banks. The river was expected to crest at 22 feet on Sunday, 11
feet above flood stage. The crest was expected to reach Van Meter
in central Iowa Sunday, nine feet above flood stage and slightly
higher than the record set in 1958. The river was expected to crest
at Des Moines near its 1947 record.
   All roads between Des Moines and west Des Moines were blocked
except Interstate 235 and police were going door to door in
low-lying areas offering evacuation help.
   A thunderstorm packing winds of at least 80 mph struck the
Ottumwa area in southeast Iowa shortly after 2 p.m., damaging trees
and at least two homes and downing power lines.
   A new outdoor storm warning system failed when the weather
service asked officials to activate it after a tornado was sighted.
Ottumwa Police Sgt. Jim Clark said the failure apparently was
caused by an electrical power surge from intense lightning.
   Travel was considered extremely dangerous all over eastern Iowa.
   In Cedar County, motorists along Interstate 80 between Durant
and Stockton were trapped inside and on top of floating cars, a
State Patrol spokesman said.
