   National Guardsmen helped keep order Wednesday
after up to 10 tornadoes churned through Arkansas, killing six
people, damaging scores of homes and businesses and temporarily
knocking out power to 16,000 customers.
   The twisters destroyed or damaged 240 homes and mobile homes and
eight businesses, said Gary Talley, spokesman for the state Office
of Emergency Services. No monetary estimate of the damage was
available Wednesday.
   Seven counties were declared disaster areas by Gov. Bill Clinton,
who set aside $350,000 in state emergency funds.
   At least 49 tornadoes touched down in Arkansas, Missouri, Kansas,
Illinois and Iowa on Tuesday night. A seventh person was killed in
southwest Missouri. The same storm system left three people dead in
road accidents in Colorado and was blamed for the electrocution
death of a woman in Illinois.
   The National Weather Service said the storms were caused by a
cold front colliding with warm, moist air.
   ``We saw it coming, but there was nothing we could do,'' said
Police Chief Darnell Scott of the central Arkansas town of Lonoke,
where two people were killed and about 30 houses were reported
heavily damaged.
   At the height of the storm, 16,000 customers of Arkansas Power &amp;
Light Co. lost power for different periods, said AP&amp;L spokesman
Jerol Garrison. By Wednesday morning, only about 1,000 customers
still had no power, he said.
   About three dozen National Guardsmen were called out for several
hours Wednesday morning to look for survivors and keep non-residents
away from homes in the Scott area in Pulaski County. A second group
of guardsmen performed similar duties in Van Buren County.
   Three of the tornado victims, a couple and their infant son, died
when their mobile home in Scott was battered by the last of the
tornadoes to hit the state, authorities said. They were identified
as Randall Dycus, 24, Kristi Dycus, 22, and their son, Waylon, about
1.
   Robert W. McCain and Juanita A. McCain, both 62, died when high
winds overturned their van on Interstate 40 near Lonoke, and Louis
Breckel, 68, was killed in Van Buren County when the storm destroyed
his home, authorities said.
   Breckel lived across the street from the new Southside High
School gymnasium, which was destroyed, Sheriff Kenny Lee said.
   ``Luckily, most of those people where the homes were completely
destroyed were all out at a high school basketball game'' in another
county, Lee said.
   William Brown, a 25-year resident of Scott, appeared resigned
Wednesday as he viewed the twisted remains of his home, which the
tornado lifted off its slab.
   ``We'll rebuild,'' Brown said, as he waited for his insurance
agent. ``Sure, we'll rebuild. This is home.''
   Next to the house sat his pickup truck, its windows blown out and
a stick almost an inch in diameter imbedded in the dashboard.
   The trees in the area, coated with the swirling fiberglass
insulation sucked into the storm's path, looked as if they were
blooming with pink cotton, and broken glass, uprooted trees and
loose boards were strewn everywhere. Two boats, hoisted by high
winds from a nearby bayou, sat 20 yards from the shoreline.
   A twister in Garland County demolished the Lake Hamilton Fire
Department, along with a half-dozen mobile homes and a barn, and 14
mobile homes were destroyed and the roofs of several residences were
damaged in Hot Spring County, said state Trooper Janet Welch.
   In Johnson County, said Sheriff Eddie King, ``We had several
homes demolished, six to 10 homes homes destroyed _ roofs blown out,
trailer homes flipped over. Trees were just twisted up, thrown in
people's yards. Cars were picked up _ one was thrown up into the
tree.''
