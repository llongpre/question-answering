   A tornado swept through a central Texas town early today,
killing one person, injuring at least two dozen others and
destroying an apartment complex while residents slept, state
officials said.
   Elsewhere in Texas, serious flooding in the Dallas-Fort Worth
area forced hundreds of people to evacuate to higher ground, and
two people were killed when their vehicles were swept away in
rain-swollen creeks. Police and firefighters performed several
dramatic rescues as the severe storm system brought a second day of
twisters, hail and heavy rain to the Southwest.
   ``I've been standing in water up to my elbows for the last
couple hours trying to get a couple gals out of a tree,'' said
Kennedale Police Chief David Geeslin. Their car had been washed off
the road.
   In the Northeast, showers stretched from eastern Virginia to
southern New England. There was widespread flooding in northern New
Jersey.
   The pre-dawn tornado caused widespread damage in the little town
of Jarrell, 40 miles north of Austin, when it stayed on the ground
for about seven miles, carving a mile-wide path of destruction.
   ``There was extensive damage downtown. A 15-unit apartment
complex was destroyed,'' said Mike Cox, spokesman for the Texas
Department of Public Safety. Williamson County Sheriff Jim Boutwell
said about 15 homes also were destroyed.
   ``It looked to me like more than one twister went through there
because there were some parallel areas'' of damage, he said.
   Several homes and businesses and the roof of the high school gym
were damaged, and at least six tractor-trailers were overturned on
Interstate 35, causing authorities to temporarily close a six-mile
stretch of the road.
   The body of a 42-year-old woman was found in the debris of a
mobile home destroyed by the tornado, Boutwell said. A man who was
in the mobile home was uninjured.
   Hospitals in Georgetown and Temples said 24 people sought
treatment and at least three were hospitalized. A police spokesman
had earlier reported 30 people injured, and it was not known if
some residents were treated at the scene.
   The Williamson County Sheriff's Department said at least three
other reports of extensive damage came from the southern and
southwestern parts of the county, where two more tornadoes were
sighted.
   In the Dallas area, a woman was killed when she drove around a
barricade and her car was swept from a bridge into a creek, and the
body of an elderly man was recovered from a truck in a creek
branch, police said.
   From 150 to 200 people were evacuated from south Dallas, 50
people from Grand Prairie, and 125 to 150 from Kennedale, police
said.
   A Kennedale city councilman used his boat to rescue a man who
had gone to check his cattle and was stranded by rapidly rising
waters, Geeslin said.
   The tornadoes came as severe thunderstorms unleashed twisters,
flash flooding and hail across a vast expanse of Texas from the Rio
Grande to the Red River.
   ``I've been working here since 1973 and this is the worst
thunderstorm I've ever seen,'' said Warren Kneis, supervisor for
the Federal Aviation Administration at the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport control tower.
   In addition to Texas, which got 7 inches of rain in some parts,
flood warnings were also issued for parts of Louisiana and
Oklahoma. A tornado touched down near Westcliffe, Colo., and huge
hail pelted Louisiana and Oklahoma.
   A weekend storm that damaged more than half of the 190 Apache
tank-killer helicopters at Fort Hood in Killeen, Texas, could cost
$500 million, said Rep. John P. Murtha, D-Pa., chairman of the
House Defense Appropriations Committee.
   The weather service said 19 tornadoes had been reported in Texas
since Tuesday morning.
   Gainesville, a city of 14,000 people about 60 miles northwest of
Dallas, was among the hardest hit Tuesday. National Guardsmen
helped evacuate about 150 homes in low-lying areas threatened by
floods, said state Trooper M. Dial. Most evacuees were taken out by
boat.
   Animals at Gainesville's Frank Buck Zoo were taken to a cattle
auction barn because of flooding. Eighteen deer were missing, said
Milburn Cravens, Gainesville's director of community services.
   Emergency workers sandbagged houses in low-lying areas of
Idabel, Okla., after heavy rains threatened flooding. A flash flood
watch was still in effect today for much of southern Oklahoma.
Thunderstorms also pelted the western part of the state.
   In northern New Jersey, 11 counties were under flood warnings,
after another 2 inches of rain in the past 24 hours drenched the
already saturated area.
   There was widespread flooding in the Newark area, with water 2
to 3 feet deep clogging entrances to roads and stalling cars. Eight
residents of Westwood, N.J., who live near the Pascack Brook were
evacuated early today.
   Area meteorologists said more rain has fallen in the first 15
days of May than usually falls in the whole month. Newark
registered 4.2 inches between May 1 and midnight Monday, before the
new rains began, compared with an average of 3.6 inches for the
whole month.
   Similarly, the amount of rain that has fallen in the
Baltimore-Washington area in May is well over the average total for
the month.
   The National Weather Service reported that a stretch of 13
consecutive days of rain in May through today is the longest in 40
years of record-keeping at Baltimore-Washington International
Airport. The previous record for May was nine days set in 1979.
