   Tornadoes skipped without warning like a
``big bouncing ball'' across North Carolina's capital city early
Monday, smashing homes and churches before heading into rural areas.
Four people were killed and at least 151 injured.
   ``I can remember hearing a big gust of wind like a hurricane and
then I could hear the wood tearing and I thought `Oh God, this is
it, I'm gone.' I just buried myself under the bed,'' said Betty Bell
of Raleigh.
   The storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a
250-mile path through the state in 1984, killing 44 people, injuring
more than 800 and leaving 2,300 homeless.
   Monday's twisters destroyed mobile homes, damaged churches,
toppled several houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto
houses and streets, leaving more 6,500 homes without electricity for
several hours. Trees were snapped several feet from the ground along
the storm's path.
   About 500 people were left homeless in Raleigh, where the storms
struck without any advance notice, said Mayor Avery Upchurch. The
National Weather Service issued no tornado warnings or watches
before the tornadoes struck.
   Roger Friedenson, a spokesman for the Insurance News Service in
Raleigh, said insurance companies anticipated a possible loss of $30
million in North Carolina from the twisters. The 1984 storms cause
$65 million in damage.
   Joe Dean, secretary of Crime Control and Public Safety, said
twisters touched down in 17 locations in Wake, Nash, Franklin,
Northampton, Halifax, Dare, Hyde, Pamlico and Currituck counties.
   In neighboring Virginia, one tornado and high wind downed trees,
damaged property and knocked out power in Isle of Wight, Brunswick
and Southampton counties early Monday, but no injuries were reported.
   The twisters first struck around 1 a.m., flattening a Raleigh K
mart store and four three-story apartment buildings nearby at the
start of a 10-mile path of destruction in northern Wake County.
   ``We flew over the area and it looked like a big bouncing ball
had gone through there,'' Upchurch said.
   Three K mart employees in the Raleigh store when the tornado hit
were all later rescued. One man was trapped in debris and had to be
pulled out.
   ``I went to the back of the store and saw I couldn't make it,''
said K Mart employee Michelle Jones. ``I got to the toys and hid.''
   Bricks, cinder blocks and twisted steel girders lay in a heap
with racks of clothing and other merchandise.
   Fire departments had crews out combing through damaged homes and
apartments in search of other victims.
   However, said Raleigh City Manager Dempsey Benton: ``To our
knowledge, all people have been accounted for.''
   Of 132 houses damaged, a third were destroyed, he said.
   Raleigh police were posted at areas of major damage to prevent
looting, authorities said.
   The Salvation Army in Wake County coordinated donations of
blankets and clothing for four temporary shelters set up for people
left homeless.
   Tony DeVita, 34, of the Calibre Oaks complex, said he grabbed a
pillow and got behind his bedroom door until the tornado passed.
   ``The roof was totally gone, the patio doors were gone and every
window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up like someone was going
to replace it,'' he said, adding he had to dig his way out from the
corner of the room.
   The Small Business Administration has been asked to assess
damages to determine if the counties will be eligible for
low-interest disaster loans, Dean said.
   ``What we are trying to do now is assess the damage and determine
how to help people affected by the storm,'' Dean said.
   Farmers also suffered losses in the storms, said Jim Graham,
state Commissioner of Agriculture. Several egg production houses, 12
bulk tobacco barns, 2,000 acres of timber,and two hog operations
were destroyed, he said.
   The victims were identified as Pete Fulghum, 12, of Raleigh;
Janet Barnes, 8, of Raleigh; and Lee Roy Alston and his wife, Mary,
of Nash County.
   Authorities first said six people had been killed. They later
said one of the deaths turned out to be unrelated to the storm. The
toll was revised downward a second time, to four, after a second
check of Wake County hospitals, the State Emergency Response Team
said in a news release.
