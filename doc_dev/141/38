   Hurricane Gilbert spun off dozens of
tornadoes in Texas that killed at least two people as the nearly
spent storm steamed inland Saturday, a ``huge rain-making machine''
with potential for deadly flooding.
   Thousands of Gulf Coast residents from Louisiana to Texas began
returning home to areas struck only a glancing blow by the main
storm, at one time the most powerful on record in the Western
Hemisphere.
   ``What could have been one of the most deadly storms in history
appears to have missed us,'' said Betty Turner, mayor of Corpus
Christi.
   Texans inland braced for more twisters and flash flooding, with
as much as 20 inches of rain expected.
   A tornado Saturday evening damaged 50 homes and destroyed 15 in
Del Rio, 150 miles west of San Antonio and just northwest of the
Mexican border, officials said. Two people were treated for minor
injuries and released, but scores of others spent the night with
relatives or stayed in shelters set up in the city, said police
dispatcher Don Weaver.
   Gilbert was downgraded early Saturday to a tropical storm. At
midday, its top sustained winds were 35 mph and it was downgraded
to a tropical depression.
   A woman was killed Saturday when a tornado hit her mobile home
south of San Antonio, some 300 miles north of Brownsville. A man
died in San Antonio when a tree toppled onto his house during a
thunderstorm Friday.
   In Alabama, a man trying to cross a rain-swollen creek in
Tallapoosa County southeast of Birmingham was swept to his death
early Saturday, officials said.
   A tornado heavily damaged a San Antonio apartment complex just
after sunrise.
   ``I just heard a loud, loud roar, like the wind blowing through
the broken patio door in my living room,'' said Wes Spencer, whose
apartment was hit.
   ``I just looked out, I freaked out. The roofs were gone on the
buildings. Cars were tossed all over the parking lot.''
   San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros also signed a disaster
declaration for his city so Air National Guard personnel could fly
in parts needed to repair air conditioning at two hospitals hit by
tornadoes earlier Saturday.
   At least 98 deaths and billions of dollars in damage were blamed
on the storm in the Caribbean and Mexico. An additional 200 people
were feared drowned after a river swollen by rain from the
hurricane jumped its banks and overturned four buses Saturday in
Monterrey, Mexico.
   The storm never made an expected turn to the north and spared
the Texas coast, where thousands had fled to shelters after
boarding up homes and businesses along the entire length of the
state's 370-mile coastline.
   Gilbert rolled ashore late Friday afternoon in northeastern
Mexico with 120 mph wind about 150 miles south of Brownsville,
where gusts of 82 mph were recorded at South Padre Island.
   Laurie Swayze Miller, owner of a Harlingen jewelry store, picked
up the pieces after a twister hit her shop.
   ``A policeman found a diamond ring out in the parking lot,'' she
said.
   Wind gusted to nearly 40 mph at midday at Brownsville, but
coastal residents were allowed to return to their boarded-up homes
to begin cleaning up. Damage from the hurricane itself appeared to
be minor.
   South Padre Island and Port Isabel, which had expected to
receive the brunt of the once-fierce storm when it roared ashore,
reopened to the public at noon. Other coastal cities began closing
emergency shelters.
   ``I was surprised because I was expecting a lot of water,''
Eduardo Campiran, South Padre Island city manager, said Saturday.
``We have no knowledge of significant damage. Most of the damage is
like roofs, windows, awnings, this kinds of stuff.''
   South Padre Island Mayor Bob Pinkerton Jr. estimated the storm
would cost local businesses $3 million to $5 million in lost
tourist revenue but said he expected business to be back to normal
by next weekend.
   Only a few low-lying coastal roads remained closed because of
flooding.
   The greatest damage appeared to be to trees, with many uprooted
or missing branches.
   ``It just trimmed the trees a little and that's about it,'' Ron
Reynolds, 31, said as he cleaned up around his home. ``My neighbor
back there had a tree go through a fence. We came through it real
lucky.''
   At 11 a.m., the National Hurricane Center put the storm center
220 miles west-southwest of Brownsville and 45 miles southwest of
Monterrey, Mexico, moving toward the west-northwest at 12 mph.
   Tornado and flash flood watches and warnings were posted for a
26-county area of southern Texas.
   Inland rainfall of 10-15 inches was likely with up to 20 inches
possible, forecasters said.
   Gilbert's remnants should bring very heavy rain to the Rio
Grande Valley before heading north up the Mississippi Valley as a
``huge rain-making machine,'' said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at
the National Hurricane Center.
   In the 24 hours up to 7 a.m., Brownsville received 4.53 inches
of rain. In Louisiana, Reserve reported 5.7 inches in 24 hours.
   By midweek, the storm should be in the lower Ohio River Valley
and end up in the Great Lakes as nothing more than foul weather,
forecasters said.
   ``The people in the Midwest better dust off their umbrellas,''
Zimmer said.
