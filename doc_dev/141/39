   Severe thunderstorms spawned about 10 tornadoes from Minnesota to
Texas, killing two people and injuring 19. Late spring snow fell in
the Rockies.
   One twister late Friday near the west Texas town of Iraan caused
nine car accidents, and two people were killed. Mike Cox of the
state Department of Public Safety said the tornado apparently struck
cars on a highway.
   Fourteen people were injured in the accidents, including two
state troopers cut by flying glass when high winds blew out the
windows of their patrol car. Five more people were injured when a
house collapsed, authorities said.
   The twister also blew down an old gymnasium and damaged the water
supply in nearby McCamey, where officials warned 2,400 residents to
conserve water.
   Also in Texas, a storm raked the Dallas-Fort Worth area with
winds of up to 60 mph and dumped 2 inches of rain in about 20
minutes, the National Weather Service said.
   The latest storms come after spring storms and some of the worst
flooding Texas has seen in 50 years killed 13 people and forced
about 10,000 from their homes. Forty-six counties have been declared
disaster areas.
   An unseasonable cold front pushing past the Rockies on Friday
caused the turbulent weather.
   Other tornadoes were reported late Friday in Wyoming, Nebraska,
South Dakota and Minnesota, the National Weather Service said.
   In northwestern Minnesota, stong winds thought to be a tornado
damaged at least three farms and felled trees near Felton.
   Forecaster Mark Ewens in Fargo, N.D., said the winds in Minnesota
were most likely a gust-front tornado, a rare twister that forms
ahead of storm fronts.
   ``They're small, weak tornadoes that nonetheless cause a lot of
damage,'' Ewens said.
   In South Dakota, twisters were spotted in central and eastern
parts of the state, but no damage was immediately reported. Severe
thunderstorms also crossed the state, bringing up to 3 inches of
rain in some areas.
   Severe thunderstorms spawned five tornadoes and golf-ball size
hail in central Nebraska, the weather service said. Five farm houses
were heavily damaged in Merna, and minor damage was reported
southwest of Sargent.
   A funnel cloud was spotted near Cheyenne, Wyo., but dissipated
quickly and no damage was reported. But thunderstorms dumped as much
as 4 inches of rain.
   Snow fell in the Big Horn Mountains and was expected in northern
Colorado mountains.
   ``It is unusual for this time of year. It's not inconceivable,
but it is unusual,'' forecaster Jim Hatten said.
