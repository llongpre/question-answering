   Rescuers on Wednesday searched a
tornado-devastated swath of northern Illinois for the missing and
the dead, while folks began salvaging belongings from homes the
twisters shredded ``like an eggbeater.''
   At least 24 people died and more than 300 were injured Tuesday
by the tornadoes, which steamrolled across a region known as
``Tornado Alley,'' about 35 miles southwest of Chicago.
   Scores of people were left homeless. Others spent the day
cleaning their yards, hammering on temporary roofs, sifting through
rubble, piling up belongings in pickup trucks lining the streets in
neighboring Plainfield. Offers of aid have poured in, including one
from the Soviet embassy in Washington.
   Theresa Rabaduex, a 23-year-old school bus driver who lived in a
complex ripped apart by the storm in Crest Hill, said tenants in
her building were being moved to free lodging ``but that doesn't do
you any good if you don't have any of your things. I don't even
have a bed.''
   She walked through the debris, trying to find her three black
cats. ``That's all that really matters to me,'' she said.
   ``It was like an eggbeater went through the inside of the
house,'' Bruce Marshall said as he tried to fashion a makeshift
cover for his roofless home in neighboring Plainfield.
   The storms struck virtually without warning Tuesday afternoon
along an eight-mile path. Hit hardest were the small towns of Crest
Hill and Plainfield. Portions of Joliet also were damaged,
including a new subdivision of houses torn down to their
foundations just a few months after they were built.
   Gov. James R. Thompson said he's seen a lot of disasters during
14 years in office, but ``nothing in my personal experience ...
compares with this.''
   ``Anything that is still standing is pure luck,'' he said after
touring the stricken area Wednesday.
   ``All I can say is thank God the death toll is not in the
hundreds. We are very, very lucky.''
   President Bush declared the region a disaster area. The Soviet
officials called the governor's office seeking information on how
to help, Thompson said.
   Illinois will provide at least $25 million in state deposits for
low-interest loans to tornado victims, said state Treasurer Jerry
Cosentino.
   There were 24 fatalities confirmed Wednesday, and toll could
reach 30 dead, said John Plunk, acting director of the Illinois
Emergency Services and Disaster Agency. Officials said another
Plainfield man died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator
he used when power was lost in his home.
   More than 300 people were treated at hospitals, and authorities
said more than 70 remained hospitalized Wednesday. At least 11 of
them were listed in critical condition.
   Wednesday's weather, sunny and cool, gave the area some relief,
and the forecast called for fair skies the rest of the week.
   National Guardsmen in Crest Hill used dogs, foot patrols and
infrared photography to search for more victims in a muddy corn
field, but found none. Six people were believed missing from a
seven-building apartment complex next to the field.
   The infrared scan from a helicopter was intended to detect
differences in temperature that might lead them to victims.
   At least nine of the storm's deaths occurred near the
apartments, where some victims were blown 400 feet out of the
building, said Chief Dave Martis of the Lockport Fire District,
which includes Crest Hill.
   Downed power lines were scattered across several streets and
nearly 7,000 customers remained without power Wednesday in Joliet,
Plainfield and the Aurora area.
   The smell of fresh wood permeated the air as residents used
chain saws to remove trees tossed like matchsticks across their
yards.
   ``I've got lots of family members helping, and some four or five
guys from surrounding towns,'' said Don Kinley, 53, of Plainfield,
who lost most of the second floor of his home.
   ``I don't know them _ they just want to help,'' said Kinley,
tears running down his cheeks.
   Mike Thomas, owner of a Naperville wiring company, said he
decided to take the day off to help Kinley and other people because
``They'd probably do it for me.''
   Night clothes hung from trees that had leaves ripped from
branches. Cars remained in front yards, where they were dumped by
the storms. A garbage bin was impaled high in a tree.
   Mike Dehler, a 26-year-old restaurant manager sifted through the
debris outside what used to be his third-floor apartment.
   ``There's my water bed,'' Dehler said, pointing to a deflated
silver mattress. ``Hopefully I'm going to find some clothes in
these dressers. All I have is what I have on.''
