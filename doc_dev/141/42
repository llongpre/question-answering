   Tornadoes spawned by Hurricane Gilbert
caused more than $35 million damage in this inland southern Texas
city apparently harder hit than coastal cities that faced the main
storm, officials said Monday.
   ``It's amazing to me that no one was killed. This is far worse
than anything in Brownsville,'' Gov. Bill Clements said here after
touring ravaged areas of both cities. ``There is no place anywhere
that suffered this kind of damage.''
   Two people were killed in the 41 tornadoes that leap-frogged
across the state. Heavy rain swelled rivers in some areas, but no
injuries were reported.
   Clements said he would wait for county officials to send him
damage estimates before taking steps for a disaster declaration and
sending requests for aid to the federal government.
   A federal disaster designation would let businesses receive
low-interest loans to rebuild and some residents would be placed in
temporary housing for a certain period, said Ed Hargett, regional
director for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   Earlier, Clements viewing damage in Brownsville on the southern
tip of Texas, which felt part of the hurricane's wind and waves.
   ``I think that all of us feel a sense of relief that we are
blessed that there is no more damage in Texas and more particularly
here in Cameron County than you have experienced,'' Clements said
after flying over waterfront areas at Brownsville.
   What little was left of the hurricane was moving across the
Midwest toward Illinois, leaving heavy rain in its wake.
   ``I don't think we are expecting much more in the way of trouble
from Hurricane Gilbert,'' said Laureen Chernow, spokeswoman for the
state's Emergency Management Council in Austin.
   San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros toured tornado-ravaged areas
Sunday, and said he wanted to extend his state of emergency
declaration through Friday.
   The declaration will enable the city to try to seek assistance
from the Small Business Administration and other federal agencies.
   ``I don't want to deny anyone potential help,'' Cisneros said.
   Twisters that raged through a residential area in the border
town of Del Rio caused an estimated $1 million damage, but no
injuries late Saturday, officials said.
   In Corpus Christi, two sea beaches in county parks were closed
because they had about $100,000 damage, Nueces County Commissioner
J.P. Luby said.
   ``The foredunes were extensively damaged,'' he said. ``The tide
went in and melted them away like butter.'' Foredunes along the
beach protect larger interior dunes from erosion.
   Luby, who said he would seek federal assistance in the park
cleanup effort, said county jail inmates will help clean up timber
and other debris and repair damage to the foredunes and parking
lots.
   But San Antonio, which opened up shelters for Gulf Coast
residents fleeing the pending storm, seemed to have suffered the
worst damage.
   One man was killed Friday when a utility pole struck his house
and a woman was thrown from her mobile home by a tornado.
   The storm system then spawned a tornado that cut a path through
Kelly Air Force Base, causing $3 million damage to 12 buildings and
an additional $25 million to aircraft parts.
   Another tornado destroyed the air-conditioning system at the
Veterans Administration Hospital, causing $2 million damage and
prompting Cisneros to issue the emergency decree so equipment could
be flown in and to avoid moving some 700 patients.
   Another tornado struck The Lodge apartments, destroying about
120 units, damaging 264 others and leaving 300 homeless. Other
twisters hit residential and businesses areas, causing about $5
million damage, officials said.
   Heavy rain caused the Rio Grande to rise about 30 feet from Lake
Amistad outside Del Rio to alcon Lake in Zapata.
   ``It didn't pose any problems because boaters were warned to get
off the river,'' Ms. Chernow said.
