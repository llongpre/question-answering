National Guardsmen were called out in Illinois and Kentucky as cleanup began 
Sunday in three states struck by tornadoes that injured more than 50 people and 
damaged or destroyed scores of homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and said he planned to declare 
the town a state disaster area today. He also sent about 100 National Guardsmen 
to prevent looting and help clean up the town, where more than a third of the 
homes and commercial buildings were destroyed in the Saturday evening storm.

<P>
In southwestern Indiana, the same storm system spawned a twister that injured 
three people and damaged or destroyed 30 homes and about 25 to 30 farm 
buildings in the St. Thomas area.

Later, near Forest Hill in central Indiana, the storm damaged several houses 
and farm buildings in a sparsely populated area, causing an estimated $500,000 
damage, Sheriff's Deputy Jim Baylis said. No injuries were reported.

In south-central Kentucky, a tornado struck near midnight in outlying areas of 
Franklin, causing an estimated $10 million to $12 million in damage to 
businesses and homes, Simpson County Judge-Executive Ken Harper said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Wallace Wilkinson authorized sending Kentucky National Guard troops to 
help prevent looting and keep traffic flowing, said David Adkinson, operations 
manager for Kentucky Disaster and Emergency Services.

<P>
In Allendale, the tornado cut through a 10-block area that makes up about half 
the town of 600. 
</P>
<P>
"The east half of the town's gone," said Marvin Jones, an ambulance driver. 
"Most of the streets are blocked by wires and trees and debris . . . . 
Belongings are scattered everywhere."
