   Tornado-shocked victims tried to put their
shattered lives and homes back in order today from a series of
twisters that killed four people, including a couple found with
their arms wrapped around each other.
   At least 17 tornadoes were reported early Monday, covering 200
miles of eastern North Carolina, injuring 151 people and causing
more than $50 million in damage.
   One tornado sent one couple on a flying-mattress ride. Mark and
Vera Cimerro landed on their mattress against a tree across the
street.
   ``I held onto her as tight as I could, and the next thing I know,
we are flying,'' said Cimerro. ``It was like a ride at the fair.''
   Their home was destroyed but they were not seriously injured.
   A neighbor, 8-year-old Janet Barnes, died when a chimney
collapsed on her bed.
   Further north in Raleigh, 12-year-old Edwin ``Pete'' Fulghum died
of head and chest injuries.
   In rural Nash County, Lee Roy Alston died with his arms wrapped
around his fatally injured wife, Mary, apparently in an effort to
shield her from the tornado that destroyed their mobile home,
authorities said. They had been thrown from the mobile home. Their
two children, ages 14 and 8, survived.
   Authorities had put the death toll at six, but later corrected it
to four.
   The tornadoes struck in nine counties, from Wake in the center of
the state, to Dare on the Atlantic Coast, authorities said. Most of
the damage was in Raleigh, where tornadoes cut a 10-mile swath.
   City Manager Dempsey Benton said the storm caused about $50
million in damage in Raleigh, the state capital. With about 85
percent of estimates completed, about 152 businesses and residential
buildings were destroyed, 301 buildings received major damage and
644 buildings minor damage, he said.
   About 500 people were left homeless in Raleigh.
   Damage estimates from other counties were not compiled.
   The storms brought reminders of the 24 twisters that ripped a
250-mile path through the state in 1984, killing 44 people, injuring
more than 800 and leaving 2,300 homeless.
   Gov. Jim Martin asked the federal Small Business Administration
to declare Wake County a disaster area.
   The American Red Cross in Wake County got so many offers of
assistance that the agency ended up turning away some would-be
volunteers. Organizations rallied to supply everything from free
legal advice to tips about home repairs.
   The twisters destroyed mobile homes, damaged churches, toppled
several houses onto their sides and threw power lines onto houses
and streets.
   A K mart store was flattened by the twister, and six Raleigh
residents, including four juveniles, were charged Monday with
looting the store.
   More than 6,500 homes were left without power, but by Monday
night electricity had been restored to all but 1,100 customers of
Carolina Power &amp; Light, said spokesman Kyle Hampton said.
   By nightfall Monday, most of those whose homes were damaged had
found somewhere to spend the night, either checking into hotels and
motels or staying with friends and relatives, authorities said.
   Only 17 people from five families spent the night at a Raleigh
middle school, the only shelter in Wake County, said Gloria Brown of
the county Department of Social Services.
   More than 300 families opened their homes to those affected by
the storm, said Helen Sibley, nurse coordinator for the local Red
Cross chapter.
   ``That's why there are not more people in the shelter,'' she
said. ``People in the city don't think other people care much about
them, but when something like this happens, we come together.''
   Farmers also suffered losses in the storms, said Jim Graham,
state Commissioner of Agriculture. Several egg production houses, 12
tobacco barns, 2,000 acres of timber, and two hog operations were
destroyed, Graham said.
   There were also losses of livestock in Wake, Halifax and Nash
counties.
   ``If federal disaster status is appropriate, I'll press for it
with all I've got,'' Graham said.
   The National Weather Service did not begin issuing tornado
warnings until 38 minutes after the first tornado touched down in
western Wake County because the twister was too close to radar to
monitor, authorities say.
   ``If you are looking straight up at a storm you can't see much,''
said Rod Gonski, a meteorologist with the weather service at Raleigh
Durham International Airport.
   In neighboring Virginia, one tornado and high wind downed trees,
damaged property and knocked out power in Isle of Wight, Brunswick
and Southampton counties early Monday, but no injuries were reported.
   At another scene of tornado damage, officials in Ruleville,
Miss., have decided there will be no classes for children there for
at least a week and preparations will be made to move high school
students to an empty building in a nearby town.
   A tornado cut a 60-foot-wide swath through Ruleville on Saturday,
destroying six homes and damaging the Delta town's three public
schools and other structures.
