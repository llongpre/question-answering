   Crews using bulldozers, dump trucks and
front-end loaders today began clearing away the debris left by a
tornado that devastated this farming community's commercial strip
and a trailer park.
   Twelve people were injured, but warning sirens apparently averted
more serious casualties.
   Lincoln County sheriff's deputies and other public safety
employees conducted a house-to-house search today; afterward, they
said they believed every resident was accounted for.
   Officials estimated that the twister damaged 90 percent of the
downtown district and more than half the residences of this eastern
Colorado plains town.
   One grain silo was flattened like a beer can. Most of the town's
structures were twisted masses of metal and wood, and several
railroad cars were overturned.
   The sirens wailed for 10 minutes before the twister struck
Wednesday night, giving residents time to take shelter, officials
and survivors said.
   Gov. Roy Romer, who flew to the shattered town on a National
Guard helicopter early today, said he would seek a federal disaster
declaration.
   ``The business district is 50 to 75 percent destroyed,'' he said,
adding that damage was likely to run into the tens of millions.
   The town, 80 miles east of Denver, is known for helping
blizzard-stranded travelers forced off Interstate 70.
   It was without water, but limited electricity and telephone
service were reported restored by late morning, officials said.
   National Guardsmen brought bedding, food and other supplies.
   The town hall, a bank, a supermarket, a video store and a
nightclub were destroyed along Main Street.
   Most of the businesses were closed at the time; 10 people in the
nightclub were saved by taking refuge in the bar's cooler, a witness
said.
   Three guests at the Lariat Hotel piled into their bathtub and
pulled a mattress over themselves after the sirens went off.
   ``We were doing a lot of praying in that bathtub,'' said David
Thomas, 27.
   The tornado tore their room apart. ``It felt like somebody just
reached down and squeezed your whole body. My eardrums were coming
out,'' Thomas said.
   Most of the 20 to 25 homes at a trailer park on the edge of town
were damaged or destroyed, resident Bernard Goetz said.
   ``It's a lot of havoc, a lot of destruction, a lot of homes gone
out there,'' Goetz said.
   Two people were hospitalized; one was reported in serious but
stable condition with a fractured pelvis.
   The tornado spun out of thunderstorms that swept the plains east
of Denver with heavy rain and baseball-size hail. The National
Weather Service said nine other tornadoes touched down on the plains.
   In eastern El Paso County, two people were trapped in a mobile
home for about two hours after it was hit by a tornado late
Wednesday, Sgt. Dean Kelsey said. Both were hospitalized in Colorado
Springs.
