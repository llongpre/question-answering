   Hurricane Gilbert's remnants swept from Texas to Illinois today
with heavy rain and flooding that forced evacuations in one
Oklahoma town. The storm earlier spun off 41 tornadoes and killed
three people in Texas and Oklahoma.
   The low-pressure system that last week was the strongest
hurricane on record in the Western Hemisphere spread showers and
thunderstorms along a line toward the northeast, with gusts to
about 40 mph this morning.
   The storm system itself picked up speed to about 45 to 50 mph,
said Dan McCarthy, of the National Weather Service.
   ``It's scooting,'' said McCarthy, of the Severe Storms Center in
Kansas City, Mo.
   Meanwhile, workers in Monterrey, Mexico, searched for the bodies
of up to 200 people swept away when a river swollen by hurricane
rains poured over its banks and overturned four buses. Ninety
bodies were recovered and a total of 191 people were confirmed dead
in the aftermath of Gilbert outside the United States.
   Late Sunday, the storm moved over Wichita Falls, Texas, with
rain and high wind, and today it was over eastern Oklahoma.
   An area west of Wichita Falls was deluged with 4{ inches of
rain, and roads in Ozona, in western Texas, were under water. The
mass of moisture extended to Chicago.
   Parts of Oklahoma received up to 8 inches of rain in two days,
causing minor flooding.
   About a dozen residents of a low-lying area in Kingfisher,
Okla., evacuated late Sunday, and others were told to be ready to
leave. Kingfisher Creek was expected to rise as much as 4 feet
above flood stage today, said police dispatcher Lois Darling.
   ``It's already a foot past flood stage and rising,'' Ms. Darling
said early today.
   Elsewhere in Oklahoma, a 50-year-old pilot from Santa Fe, N.M.,
was killed late Saturday when his plane broke apart while flying
near Muskokee, northeast of Oklahoma City, in heavy rain produced
by Gilbert, authorities said.
   Although the brunt of the hurricane missed the U.S. Gulf Coast,
at least 41 tornadoes spun off by the storm damaged homes and
businesses in Texas.
   The Rio Grande River in southwest Texas was expected to rise to
12 feet above flood stage.
   In San Antonio, a man was killed Friday when a twister knocked a
utility pole onto his home, and woman died early Saturday after a
tornado ripped through her mobile home.
   ``We'll take one day at a time. We'll clean up and eventually
we'll get our own house put up if we get some money to buy lumber
and tin,'' said Deborah Dickens, whose mother-in-law, Emily
Dickens, was killed.
   Other tornadoes in San Antonio uprooted trees, snapped power
lines and tore off roofs. Damage there was estimated at more than
$35 million, including $25 million harm to aircraft parts at Kelly
Air Force Base.
   Sylvia Sulsh, 54, said she was taking a shower early Saturday
when a tornado struck her apartment at a San Antonio complex where
at least 120 units were destroyed, 264 others damaged and 300
tenants left homeless.
   ``I got out of the shower and braced myself against the door and
then I saw the roof fall down in the living room,'' Ms. Sulsh said.
   Mayor Henry Cisneros said the city was lucky the death toll was
low.
   Crews restored power and telephone service Sunday and removed
debris from streets, while those whose homes were damaged made
repairs.
   The storm killed at least 98 people while coursing the
Caribbean, including 29 in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, where it hit
with winds of up to 200 mph, 26 in Jamaica, 30 in Haiti, five in
the Dominican Republic and eight in Honduras.
   Offshoots of the hurricane produced heavy rain over the Florida
Panhandle last week and miles of roads and bridges remained flooded
today around the city of Milton, about 30 miles northeast of
Pensacola. So far this month, Pensacola has recorded 11.7 inches of
rain; normal rainfall for the period is 4.6 inches.
   The Blackwater River at Milton rose above its banks for a second
time in as many weeks Saturday, damaging about 40 houses and 20
mobile homes, said Tom Roche, civil defense director for Santa Rosa
County. The first round of flooding was caused by rain associated
with Hurricane Florence.
