   Tornadoes today ripped through a department
store, destroyed mobile homes and churches and damaged apartment
buildings, killing five people and injuring more than 143 others,
authorities said.
   Three of the deaths, including an 11-year-old boy, were in Wake
County, which includes Raleigh, and the others were in neighboring
Nash County, officials said.
   Gov. Jim Martin said three storm systems hit the state and at
least 15 tornado touchdowns were reported in seven counties. In
north Raleigh, tornadoes raked a path through a five-mile area. Four
three-story apartment buildings and a department store were
flattened.
   ``I can remember hearing a big gust of wind like a hurricane and
then I could hear the wood tearing and I thought, `Oh God, this is
it, I'm gone.' I just buried myself under the bed,'' said Betty Bell
of Raleigh, who was in bed when a tornado hit.
   Tony DeVita, 34, of the Calibre Oaks complex said he grabbed a
pillow and got behind his bedroom door until the tornado passed.
   ``The roof was totally gone, the patio doors were gone and every
window was smashed. The carpet was rolled up like someone was going
to replace it,'' he said, adding he had to dig his way out from the
corner of the room.
   Raleigh City Manager Dempsey Benton Jr. said 62 people were taken
to hospitals in Wake County, including three who required surgery.
At least nine houses were destroyed and 44 damaged, he said.
   Benton said city officials received no warning from the National
Weather Service about the possibility of tornadoes. ``We did not
have a tornado watch nor warning before the storm struck,'' he said.
   He and Raleigh Mayor Avery Upchurch flew over the affected area
today and Upchurch said, ``It looked like a big bouncing ball had
gone through there.''
   Roger Friedenson of the Insurance News Service said it appeared
that damages could be as serious as tornadoes that struck
southeastern North Carolina in 1984 and caused about $65 million in
damage. City officials said 500 people were homeless.
   Martin, at a 6 a.m. briefing, said six people had died, but
later, officials said one of those deaths was not storm-related.
Officials at the state Division of Emergency Management said 143
people were taken to hospitals. Uncounted others were treated for
minor injuries.
   The tornadoes first struck Raleigh around 1:15 a.m., Benton said.
City buses transported more than 300 people to two shelters, he said.
   Later in the morning, the storms moved into eastern Virginia,
pushing over trees and bringing heavy wind and rain, the weather
service said. A tornado warning there expired at 6 a.m.
   The National Weather Service said a tornado touched down near
Windsor, Va., cutting power to much of the area. There were reports
of damage to mobile homes, but no injuries were reported.
   Power outages were widespread in North Carolina, authorities said.
   ``We've had churches that have been demolished, some trailers and
some homes,'' said Franklin County Sheriff Arthur E. Johnson, who
added that Red Cross personnel were on their way.
   In northern Raleigh, a K mart store was flattened, and three
people were trapped inside, said police Sgt. J.D. Everett. All three
were rescued, but one man suffered a broken leg, said Assistant Fire
Chief Robert Whittington.
   Bricks, cinder blocks and twisted steel girders lay in a heap
with racks of clothing and other merchandise.
   Police dispatched officers to nearby neighborhoods to look for
people in need of help and to prevent looting.
   ``It appears that we've got extensive damage all over the area,''
Everett said. ``We do have some extensive injuries, but I can't tell
you how many, or who, or where.''
   In addition to the flattened apartment buildings, numerous others
suffered structural damages, said Deirdre Bolling, manager of the
Cooper's Pond complex. No one in those buildings was seriously hurt,
and residents were given lodging at hotels, she said.
   The first rescue workers on the scene there pulled people from
third-floor windows. Several residents wandered around dazed, with
visible cuts. One man wore only a bath towel.
