   Creeks roared out of their banks in eastern Iowa today after
thunderstorms that extended east into northern Illinois and
southwest Wisconsin, where flooded roads, mudslides and a tornado
were reported.
   Five people were injured today when high wind swept through an
industrial park in Streamwood, Ill., a western Chicago suburb.
Humana Hospital in Hoffman Estates reporteda 21-year-old man was in
critical condition and four others were in good or fair condition.
   Steve Kahn, a weather service forecaster in the Chicago area,
said a small tornado or a ``downburst'' of wind damaged buildings
in the industrial park.
   Elsewhere in Illinois, heavy early-morning thunderstorms knocked
out power to thousands of homes and caused delays of up to a
half-hour at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.
   Police in Janesville, Wis., said a tornado touched down there
early today, causing damage to homes, schools and other business,
but no injuries.
   Up to 4 inches of rain today flooded the Wapsipinicon River,
Duck Creek and Silver Creek in eastern Iowa. Many of the people
evacuated also were flooded out of their homes on June 17.
   ``People were just beginning to clean up and get back into their
homes and they've had water rising very rapidly out there again,''
said Dave Whan, assistant Scott County administrator.
   In north-central Iowa, gusty wind and tornadoes ripped down
trees, power lines and buildings Thursday.
   One tornado was spotted southwest of Ackley, about 60 miles
north of Des Moines, and a second one seen northwest of Ackley
moved southeast over the town Thursday afternoon, causing
considerable damage.
   ``Hundreds of buildings and hundreds of acres of crops were lost
due to Thursday's storms,'' state Rep. Robert D. Fuller said.
   In addition to leveling barns and other farm buildings in
Franklin and Hardin counties, the wind took the roof off an
apartment building in Ackley and broke windows at a car dealership
and many downtown buildings. It also tore down power lines and
hundreds of trees.
   ``All at once I seen things a flying,'' said Ackley resident
Dorothy Belle Sugar, who said she was indoors when she heard sirens
go off and looked out her kitchen window as the tornado passed
through the town.
