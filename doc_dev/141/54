   Tornadoes and torrential rain swept through the Deep South,
damaging buildings and causing floods and at least two deaths,
including a 3-year-old who was thrown 200 yards by a twister that
blasted his family's mobile home.
   Tornadoes touched down Wednesday evening in Georgia, Alabama and
Mississippi, and rains continued in already flooded parts of
Louisiana,
   ``If there was a Richter scale for floods, this would have
topped it,'' said Mike Yenni, president of Jefferson Parish, La. A
2-year-old boy there died when he fell into a drainage canal
earlier this week.
   The 3-year-old and his parents were in a mobile home smashed by
a tornado in Pineview, Ga., a town of 560 people.
   ``The child was found under a car 200 yards from the foundation
of the trailer,'' said Deputy Sheriff Dianne Roberts. ``Someone
just happened to look under it and saw the baby.'' The child's name
was unavailable.
   His father, Billy West, was found lying in the road with a
broken neck and was in critical condition early today, said Mandy
Shackleford, a spokeswoman at the Medical Center of Central Georgia
in Macon. The mother also was hurt.
   The tornado damaged at least four other homes and caused three
additional injuries, authorities said.
   A tornado touched down near Stonewall, Miss., on Wednesday
night, the National Weather Service said, but no details were
available.
   Two tornadoes hit two counties in southeast Alabama on Wednesday
morning.
   In Geneva County, a woman was hurt when her mobile home was
tossed into a fish pond. Her husband paddled to the trailer in his
boat to retrieve his wife and their daughter.
   ``It just all happened so fast,'' Mrs. E.C. Barnes, 54, said in
a telephone interview from her hospital bed. ``The trailer is still
intact. It got picked up and was dropped in the pond. I'm fine,
though.''
   A tornado damaged more than 40 homes and businesses in the town
of Dothan.
   ``This is the worst tornado I've seen in Houston County in 10
years,'' said Pat Bradley of the Dothan-Houston County Emergency
Management Agency. ``We've found some roofs that were taken seven
blocks away and dropped.''
   The Red Cross opened a shelter for those left homeless or
without power because of the storms.
   About 2,000 students at Wallace College were kept in hallways
for an hour during the worst of the storms and then were sent home.
Several found their cars floating in a flooded parking lot.
   The weather service on Wednesday reported 5.6 inches of rain in
Mobile, 9.6 inches in Dothan, and nearly 10 inches in Florala.
   More than 2,200 homes and businesses flooded after a record 17
inches of rain drenched New Orleans and three surrounding parishes
during a 24-hour period that ended Tuesday night, according to
preliminary estimates. The rains continued in some areas Wednesday.
   Of the 1,400 homes in the Ormond Estates subdivision, 20 miles
up the Mississippi River from New Orleans, 1,000 were flooded.
Water was up to 2 feet deep in homes that cost from $100,000 to
$500,000. Another 1,000 homes flooded in Gretna, Kenner and parts
of Jefferson Parish.
   Yenni said he would call for passage of a $100 million plan for
major canal improvements and two more pumping stations in the New
Orleans area, which is below sea level and relies on a network of
drainage canals and pumps to protect neighborhoods from flooding.
   ``I cannot believe this. I think I'm going to be sick. Brand new
carpet ruined, everything ruined,'' said Liz Arceneaux, who
returned to her Ormond Estates house by boat to find 5 inches of
water standing in the home.
