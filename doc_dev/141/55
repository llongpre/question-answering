   Thunderstorms spawned at least four tornadoes in Michigan,
causing no injuries but damaging dozens of homes and disrupting
electrical service, while Louisiana residents cleaned up from a
weekend twister and flooding.
   Much of the damage in Michigan was confined to Washtenaw County
southwest of Detroit, where a funnel cloud touched down four times
Sunday afternoon along a 13-mile path, said Dan Harsh, the county
emergency management director.
   The National Weather Service confirmed three other tornadoes in
southeast Michigan, meteorologist Tom Fendon said.
   More than two dozen homes and several barns were damaged by the
four twisters, along with trees and utility poles, officials said.
   A funnel cloud and golfball-size hail were reported late Sunday
afternoon in the Washtenaw County community of Manchester, but the
twister apparently did not touch down, Fendon said.
   The storm system also produced severe thunderstorms elsewhere in
the state's Lower Peninsula. Traverse City, Houghton Lake and Grand
Rapids each received about 1 inch of rain, while wind gusts reached
63 mph near Ann Arbor, the weather service said.
   About 9,000 customers lost electrical service during the storm,
utility officials said.
   Detroit Edison Co. spokesman Dan Vecchioni said only about 400
customers remained without power today, and service to them was
expected to be restored by evening.
   In Louisiana, partly cloudy skies and 80-degree weather
permitted a continued cleanup Sunday by victims of a tornado and
floods that accompanied a torrential weekend rain.
   Southeast Louisiana was waterlogged by more than a foot of
precipitation. Rain-swollen rivers and streams continued to crest
above flood stage, but officials said the flooding would be
confined mostly to rural areas.
   Hardest hit by flooding were the suburban subdivisions in
Marrero, across from New Orleans on the west bank of the
Mississippi River.
   But Tony Rodi, coordinator for emergency management in Jefferson
Parish, said streets hip-deep in water on Saturday were dry by
Sunday, and power was restored to nearly all the houses.
   Rodi said no official count was available on the number of homes
that were flooded Saturday. The Red Cross said about 200 people
were evacuated Saturday; about 70 were in an emergency shelter
Sunday.
   On the other side of Lake Pontchartrain, residents in Slidell
continued to clean up from a tornado Saturday that the state Office
of Emergency Preparedness said destroyed three homes, caused major
damage to 17 others and minor damage to 32 more.
