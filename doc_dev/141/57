   Tornadoes swept across a section of
central Tennessee early today, killing at least one person, injuring
15 others and destroying several homes, authorities said.
   A tornado watch was posted for middle Tennessee.
   ``There's been at least eight touchdowns, numerous homes have
been destroyed and I've just been told that an apartment complex was
possibly involved,'' said David King of the Tennessee Emergency
Management Agency.
   Williamson County Sheriff's dispatcher Sharon Lambert said the
line of storms ``killed one so far we know.'' The identity of the
victim and other details of the death were not being released, she
said.
   The injured were taken to Williamson County Medical Center, south
of Nashville, some suffering minor cuts and bruises and others
serious injuries, said Tracy Fuston, nursing supervisor.
   ``Things are a little still a little crazy out here,'' she said.
``We're trying to determine the extent of the injuries.''
   The tornadoes, which struck just after 6 a.m., also ``did a lot
of property damage,'' Lambert said.
   About 16 homes were damaged in Franklin, Brentwood and the area
of Moores Lane, King said.
   Elizabeth Maranise of Franklin got a look at the debris from the
tornado as she drove from her home on Interstate 65 to work in
Nashville about half an hour after the tornado touched down.
   ``There was a car in the median,'' she said. ``Then there was
debris on both sides of the expressway just past the Moores Lane
exit _ pieces of metal and I don't know what all there was.''
   A tornado watch, which tells residents to keep an eye out for
twisters, was in effect until noon for much of western and central
Tennessee and adjacent sections of northern Mississippi.
