   The National Guard patrolled in Tuscaloosa, Ala., while the South
cleaned up today from a barrage of nearly two dozen late-season
tornadoes and storms that killed at least two people and damaged
more than 150 homes.
   The same storm system carried high wind and heavy rain to parts
of Ohio and Pennsylvania on Sunday, ripping off the roof of an empty
school in southwestern Pennsylvania and toppling a 75-foot Christmas
tree in Pittsburgh.
   It later became the first big snowstorm of the season to hit
Maine, dumping sleet and nearly a foot of snow that was blamed for
more than 100 traffic accidents, with two fatalities. Caribou
recorded 10 inches of snow.
   In the Caribbean, Tropical Storm Keith churned off Mexico's
Yucatan Peninsula after becoming the 11th tropical storm of the
season. Forecasters expect it to reach hurricane strength as it
heads into the Gulf of Mexico.
   It could hit Florida late in the week.
   Twisters skipped across Arkansas, Missisippi and Alabama,
uprooting trees, damaging homes and downing power lines this weekend.
   The tornadoes struck unusally late in the year, said Harry Gordon
of the National Weather Service's Severe Storms Center in Kansas
City, Mo.
   One tornado slammed through a three-mile area near the small
northeast Mississippi town of Nettleton, snapping the tops off trees
before dipping into a mobile home park and running along a string of
hills and valleys.
   Two people in mobile homes _ a 37-year-old man and the
9-month-old boy _ were found dead Sunday after the tornado hit. Nine
others were injured, including one hospitalized in critical and one
in serious condition.
   Ten houses and two businesses were destroyed and 24 homes were
damaged, officials said.
   ``It's terrible,'' said Gov. Ray Mabus, who toured the area
Sunday. ``There's nothing that was left standing much in the path of
the storm.''
   Tornadoes also were reported in the Mississippi counties of
Simpson, Bolivar, Sunflower and Leake, with at least 25 houses
damaged in Simpson.
   Three traffic deaths in Mississippi were blamed on wet weather.
The weather is believed to have contributed to six traffic deaths in
Arkansas since Friday. Six people were killed Friday night when a
small plane slammed into a mountain in Batesville, Ark., while
trying to land in dense fog and thunderstorms. The cause of the
crash has not been determined.
   The twin-engine plane slammed into a mountain during its second
attempt to land in dense fog and thunderstorms Friday night.
   A tornado in Tuscaloosa, Ala., early Sunday cut a mile-long path
of destruction, damaging homes and knocking out electrical service
to 3,600 homes. Nearly 100 homes were damaged or destroyed and six
people were injured.
   Mike McCarty said he was on his way into the kitchen when the
tornado slammed into his two-story home.
   ``That's when the kitchen came apart,'' McCarty said Sunday
afternoon. ``The ceiling just vanished. So did much of our house.''
   Dick Pierce, director of the Tuscaloosa County Emergency
Management Agency, surveyed the damage by helicopter.
   ``We're looking at 15 houses totally destroyed, 20 to 25 with
major-to-moderate damage and another 50 to 60 with shingles off or
gutters off or this type of thing,'' he said.
   Buck Medley of the American Red Cross said most people forced
from their homes stayed with friends or relatives. ``We were going
to open shelters, but it wasn't necessary,'' he said.
   Tuscaloosa Mayor Al DuPont said National Guardsmen helped with
the cleanup Sunday and guarded against looting Sunday night. The Red
Cross also set up a disaster center to help those whose homes were
damaged.
   In Pennsylvania, classes were canceled for today at the German
Central Elementary School in McClellandtown after a fierce
thunderstorm tore off the roof of the building Sunday.
   Forty miles to the north in Pittsburgh, a 75-feet-tall Christmas
tree was knocked over by high winds. The artificial tree, boasting
5,812 lights, was erected by Duquesne Light Co. at Point State Park.
   ``The wind is blowing so hard you can't tell how hard it's
raining, but the rain is going sideways,'' said Lynne Lucot, who
works at a supermarket in Aliquippa, north of Pittsburgh.
   Heavy rains in New Jersey on Sunday left four rivers swollen to
near flood stage _ the Millstone, Raritan, Saddle and Ramapo rivers
in the northwestern and northern parts of the state.
   Rain, wind and lightning also forced a halt in departures for a
time Sunday evening at the three major New York area airports, John
F. Kennedy International, Newark International and LaGuardia,
according to Bill Cahill, spokesman for the government agency that
runs them.
   Weekend deluges in Arkansas also spawned flood warnings for
several rivers, including the Ouachita River in Camden and
Arkadelphia in southern Arkansas.
