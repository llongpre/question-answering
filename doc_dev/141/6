<P>
The most powerful series of tornadoes in this area in more than two decades 
tore a path of death and destruction across suburbs southwest of Chicago 
Tuesday afternoon, killing at least 23 people and flattening 100 homes, an 
apartment complex, a church and a high school in a matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Four separate tornadoes spawned by a hot, muggy storm cell touched down amid 
the subdivisions and cornfields in the vicinity of Joliet, about 30 miles 
outside Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Area hospitals reported more than 280 people injured, many of them critically. 
Officials said they expected the number of deaths and injuries to rise through 
the night. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gov. James R. Thompson activated two Illinois National Guard units 
to help police maintain order and restore public services. As of late Tuesday, 
two people had been arrested for looting in the area. 
</P>
<P>
One of the twisters slammed into the Cedar Woods Apartment Complex in Crest 
Hill about 3:40 p.m., knocking some three-story brick buildings to the ground 
and stripping the top two floors off others. 
</P>
<P>
Police officers said they pulled several bodies from the rubble and were 
frantically searching for more victims as daylight faded. Some victims were 
thrown from buildings by the force of the storm and landed more than 200 yards 
away in a cornfield. 
</P>
<P>
"It was total devastation; it looked like a bomb had hit," said one fireman who 
helped pull bodies from the field. He said most of the dead were clad only in 
shorts. 
</P>
<P>
St. Mary Immaculate Church in Plainfield was almost completely destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
The storm mangled power and telephone lines and cut vital services to tens of 
thousands of residents in the area. It caused numerous traffic accidents on 
Interstate 55 as high winds tossed dozens of cars and trucks off the road. At 
least six people were injured in their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
Downed power lines sparked several small fires, officials said. Residents in 
some affected areas were warned not to drink tap water. 
</P>
<P>
At least two deaths were reported at Plainfield High School, which was hit 
point-blank by one of the tornadoes only a day before the beginning of the 
regular school year. At the time, several teachers and administrators were 
inside the building preparing for the start of classes, and members of the 
football and women's volleyball teams were practicing. 
</P>
<P>
The students raced inside the structure just moments before the twister smacked 
into it, blowing the roof off and toppling many walls. Miraculously, none of 
the youngsters were among those reported killed. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some very short warnings," said Steve Schernerhorn, a school 
administrator. "We immediately took cover . . . . There is no school left . . . 
. All the houses in front of the school are pretty much gone." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, 16-year-old Guy Allton watched from his home as the school crumbled. 
"We went outside and there were picnic tables blowing past our faces and 
stuff," Allton told Associated Press. "Everything was messed up. Everything on 
James Street is totaled. Lots and lots of people hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Candi Vance, another Plainfield student, was not at school when the storm hit 
but barely escaped with her life anyway. The 16-year-old Vance was visiting her 
grandmother in the Lilly Cash subdivision in Plainfield when a tornado swooped 
out of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The two women had just begun to scramble down the stairs to the basement when 
the roof and much of the rest of the house collapsed. "It came down; the steps 
fell on top of us," Vance recalled. "All I could see was the sky. There's 
nothing left . . . . No one can believe we made it out alive." 
</P>
<P>
Vance was treated at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Joliet for a twisted ankle 
and bruised bones in her knee. Her grandmother suffered cuts on one leg from 
the knee to the ankle and was bleeding badly when she was brought into the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
As night fell, huge traffic jams filled the roads throughout the southwestern 
suburbs as commuters returning from work tried to navigate through darkened 
streets obstructed by floodwaters and debris. Police roadblocks and the lack of 
stoplights added to the congestion. 
</P>
<P>
Several hundred people with injuries ranging from minor cuts to serious head 
wounds were shuttled by ambulances to hospitals in Joliet. One of the 
facilities was so overwhelmed that it set up an emergency treatment center in 
its parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities set up several shelters in area churches and schools for those who 
had lost their homes or were having trouble coping with the lack of 
electricity. Clair Swan, superintendent of schools in suburban Shorewood, said 
all three of his district's schools would be used as shelters. 
</P>
<P>
"At least 1,000 people, maybe more, will sleep here tonight," he predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Many area residents also opened their doors to those in need. A local radio 
station in Joliet was broadcasting the names and addresses of residents who had 
called in with offers to put up the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
Area businesses also offered relief, including a bed-and-mattress shop that 
said it would let displaced people come in and sleep on the floor samples.
