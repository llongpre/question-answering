   Storms battered portions of the Great Plains and the Rockies on
Tuesday while other parts of the nation basked in record warmth.
Tornadoes ripped up buildings and downed power lines in Missouri.
   It looked like winter in Colorado, where more than a foot of
snow fell in some places and Denver commuter traffic was slowed to
a slushy crawl. It felt like summer in Charleston, W.V., where
Christmas shoppers could roll up their sleeves in 84-degree warmth.
   ``I love it,'' said Becky Vandergriff of Dunbar, W.V., as she
looked at Christmas decorations in downtown Charleston. ``The
decorations look just as pretty when it's warm.''
   Missy Frerichs, a transplanted midwesterner, said the balmy
weather ``takes some of the fun out of shopping. ... I just want
some snow.''
   Colorado was the place for Ms. Frerichs, although parts of North
Dakota and Wyoming might have sufficed. A strong weather front
brought freezing rain, snow and icy blasts of wind across an area
extending from the Great Lakes to the Rockies.
   The Beaver Creek ski resort in Colorado reported receiving 14
inches of snow overnight. The Colorado State Patrol said roads
across the state were snowpacked and icy. The storm followed a
weekend of record-breaking temperatures that rose into the 70s in
some spots.
   A tornado tore through a shopping center and at least two
apartment buildings in Columbia, Mo., 30 miles north of the
capital, Jefferson City.
   ``We understand that the roof of the shopping center is pretty
heavily damaged, plus the roofs and windows of several apartment
complexes,'' said Michael Sanford, Columbia's director of emergency
management.
   About 70 miles southwest of Columbia, a similar storm downed
trees and power lines and ripped up a boat storage area near the
Ozark town of Warsaw.
   A storm that may have been a tornado struck O'Fallon, Mo., about
30 miles west of St. Louis, downing power lines and trees and
damaging some homes and a boat.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries in any of the
Missouri storms.
   The National Weather Service warned of the possibility of
tornadoes from Texas to Indiana, Illinois and Michigan.
   In Illinois, thunderstorms and possible tornadoes wrecked homes
and businesses, toppled trees and knocked out electrical service to
thousands of people. The damage Monday night and Tuesday was
scattered throughout the state.
   No injuries were reported.
   The roof on an apartment complex in Aurora was lifted and a car
was overturned in the parking lot of a shopping center in the
Chicago suburb of Naperville.
   In much of Michigan and Indiana, however, the weather talk was
about warmth - the record of 66 degrees in Detroit, or the records
of 65 degrees in Fort Wayne, Ind., or 65 degrees in Grand Rapids,
Mich.
