   Tornadoes ground across Texas on Wednesday in a renewed assault
of thunderstorms while crews were still clearing the wreckage of
more than 100 homes left by twisters that ripped six states.
   The thunderstorms also dumped heavy rain that created flood
threats, multiplied in Wisconsin by a dam that burst on a pond
after being battered by ice.
   And while untimely warm weather plagued the Plains and heated
the East, heavy snow made travel hazardous in parts of Wyoming,
North Dakota and Montana.
   Two twisters in central Texas flipped mobile homes, tore off
roofs and toppled utility poles Wednesday, and wind in excess of 50
mph blew over trailers and highway signs and downed power lines
across northern parts of the state. No injuries were reported.
   On Tuesday, tornadoes damaged homes and other property in
Kansas, Illinois, Nebraska, Iowa, Oklahoma and Texas. At least two
people were killed and 29 injured.
   At least 31 cities from the Mississippi Valley eastward reported
record or record-tying high temperatures Wednesday, the third day
of unseasonable warmth. The records included 85 at Baltimore, 75 at
Detroit, 76 at Indianapolis, 80 at Rochester, N.Y., and 86 at
Washington's National Airport. The high at Indianapolis erased a
record on the books since 1875, the National Weather Service said.
   Because of the unseasonable warmth, the cherry blossoms in
Washington will peak Thursday and Friday, and will be gone by the
April opening of the annual Cherry Blossom Festival, said National
Park Service spokeswoman Marja Morris.
   ``Over the weekend they will be good, but they'll only last four
or five days,'' she said. But tulips are about three weeks ahead of
schedule and will flower in time for the cherry blossom festival,
she said.
   In the Dallas area, the weather service posted flash flood
warnings after more than 4 inches of rain fell at Lake Mexia, with
1.50 inches in just one hour, and 2 to 3 inches fell in Henderson
County.
   Missouri also got heavy rain Wednesday as several lines of
thunderstorms swept across the state during the morning.
Springfield had almost 2 inches by 6 a.m., flooding some
intersections and damaging underground telephone cable.
   Flooding also was a major concern in Oklahoma. ``The ground is
completely saturated over much of the state, and flood-prone areas
are going to have a problem,'' meteorologist Ken Huckabee said.
Schools were closed Wednesday in Ochelata and Ramona in
northeastern Oklahoma because of high water.
   Heavy rain flooded rural roads in southwestern Wisconsin and a
dam on a creek that was pounded by floating ice gave way Wednesday,
causing a flood threat downstream on the Trempealeau River at the
city of Arcadia, officials said.
   Police Chief Patrick Grzadzielewski said weather officials
estimated the dam break could produce a rise of 1 to 2 feet in the
river at his city. The river already had been rising about an inch
every hour and was about 12 to 14 inches from the top of its banks
as of 11:30 a.m., he said.
   In colder areas, ground blizzards of fresh snow stirred up by
wind gusting to 50 mph forced the Wyoming Highway Patrol to close a
45-mile stretch of Interstate 80 between Cheyenne and Laramie.
Several jackknifed trucks also contributed to Wedenesday's closure.
   In Montana, the ski area in the Little Belt Mountains southeast
of Great Falls reported 20 inches of new snow Wednesday morning,
but U.S. 89 in the area was snowpacked and icy.
   Schools remained open in snowbound Chouteau County, but the
county spelling bee was canceled because 12 contestants from the
tiny town of Geraldine couldn't make it to Fort Benton.
   Seventy-eight tornadoes were reported Tuesday, 25 in Kansas
alone, said Ed Ferguson, deputy director of the National Severe
Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City. He said he expected the
count to go down because of duplication.
   ``It's very unusual to have that many tornadoes reported any one
day, any time in the season,'' he said.
   Nebraska reported 16 twisters, Iowa had 15, Oklahoma reported
14, Illinois sighted six and two were reported in Texas, he said.
   ``The unusual aspect is that the severe activity extended so far
to the north,'' Ferguson said. ``Normally we expect the severe
weather in northern states to come later in the season.''
   The worst of the tornadoes damaged 75 to 100 homes in Hesston,
Kan., 35 miles north of Wichita, Ferguson said.
   The two deaths occurred near Kansas towns of Burrton and
Goessel, near Hesston.
   ``It looks like it traveled a hundred miles at least and maybe a
little over that. It was on the ground for 2{ hours. The average
tornado is on the ground only for a couple of miles,'' Ferguson
said.
   Extensive damage in Hesston prompted authorities to cordon off
the town of 4,000 on Wednesday, barricading all roads and guarding
heavily damaged residential areas and businesses. A Highway Patrol
officer stood guard outside the Hesston State Bank, which lost its
roof and part of a wall.
   Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden declared eight counties disaster areas.
   Sixteen people were injured in Hesston, but only four required
hospitalization, said City Administrator Jay Weiland, who was in
his home when the tornado approached.
   ``I looked out our back door and I saw this thing coming,'' he
said. ``I thought `Oh, my God, there goes my town.'''
