   Nearly two dozen tornadoes slashed across parts of the South
during the weekend, destroying homes and ripping down trees, and at
least two people were killed.
   Torrential rain also fell across the South and from Arkansas into
Kentucky, washing out one small dam and sending streams over their
banks.
   Three Mississippi traffic deaths were blamed on the wet weather
and tornadoes injured six people in Alabama and 11 in Mississippi.
   In colder air west of the rain, 5 inches of snow fell at Joplin,
Mo., 3 to 8 inches of snow was reported in Montgomery County, Kan.,
and 4 to 6 inches of snow fell over parts of the Ozarks, the
National Weather Service said.
   Twenty-three tornadoes were reported along with numerous reports
of damaging wind and large hail Saturday and early Sunday, the
weather service said.
   One tornado cut a mile-long path of destruction through
Tuscaloosa, Ala., early Sunday, damaging more than 100 houses and
injuring six people.
   ``In most of the neighborhood, everything is pretty much
devastated,'' said John Gray, who had a tree blown on his house.
   Dick Pierce, director of the Tuscaloosa County Emergency
Management Agency, said about 15 houses were destroyed or heavily
damaged and another 20 to 25 suffered moderate-to-light damage. The
houses were all in a strip about a quarter-mile wide and a mile
long, he said.
   Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt called out the National Guard to help with
the cleanup, and the Red Cross set up a diaster center to serve
those whose homes were damaged.
   The tornado knocked out electrical service to 3,600 homes.
Alabama Power Co. brought in crews from neighboring towns and had
electrical service restored by 3:30 p.m. Sunday to every house
capable of receiving it, company spokeswoman Bunny Cox said.
   Two people were killed, one a 9-month-old child, and 11 others
were injured late Saturday when a tornado slashed through a rural
area north of Nettleton, Miss.
   ``We're told it hit right around midnight, and from what
observers say it touched down along an area about a quarter-mile
wide and three miles long,'' said Jim Maher, director of the
Mississippi Emergency Management Agency.
   Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus cut short a trip outside the state to
tour the area.
   Tornadoes also were reported in Simpson, Bolivar, Sunflower and
Leake, with at least 25 houses damaged in Simpson County.
   Maher said 12 buildings _ six mobile homes, four homes and two
businesses _ were destroyed by the Nettleton twister. Twenty-two
other homes and two mobile homes were damaged, he said. A tornado in
Sunflower County destroyed a staff worker's home at the Mississippi
State Penitentiary at Parchman.
   Some minor lowland and street flooding also was reported around
Mississippi, with hail ranging up to the size of golf balls in some
areas, the weather service said. In the 24-hour period ending at 7
a.m. Sunday, 6.61 inches of rain was reported at White Oak, with
6.32 at D'Lo and 5.25 at Forest.
   Little Rock, Ark., got 4.08 inches of rain Saturday for a two-day
total of 11.09 inches, exceeding the city's previous record rainfall
for the entire month of November.
   Arkansas' heavy rain Friday and Saturday caused rivers to rise,
and the Ouachita River is expected to crest 10 feet above flood
stage Tuesday at Camden.
   In Lonoke, Ark., a town of 4,100 where a tornado Tuesday night
caused millions of dollars in damage, wind up to 50 mph and
torrential rain left about 3,600 residents without electricity
Saturday, said John Heuston, a spokesman for Arkansas Power &amp; Light
Co.
   More than 50 people were evacuated in southeast Jonesboro, Ark.,
``because the water was coming into their houses,'' said John
Varner, a Craighead County deputy sheriff. Most evacuees were
sheltered at the homes of friends and relatives, he said.
   Three to 6 inches of rain doused south-central and western
Kentucky during the night and a temporary dam at a reservoir in
Campbellsville, Ky., broke early Sunday. No flooding or damage was
reported, said Mayor Robert Miller.
   The dam, which was holding back 7 feet of water that covered
about 80 acres, broke in small sections ``and it didn't come out as
one big gush of water,'' Miller said. One family evacuated Saturday
night returned home Sunday, he said.
   High wind accompanied by heavy rain ripped the roof off an empty
elementary school in McClellandtown, Pa., Sunday and caused
widespread damage throughout southwestern Pennsylvania.
   The brief storm also knocked down trees and blew out the windows
of homes.
   No injuries were reported.
