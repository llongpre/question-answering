   Tornadoes ripped through two small towns in Louisiana and Florida
on Thursday, destroying more than 30 homes and killing five people.
Tornadoes, rain and high wind from thunderstorms also caused damage
in parts of Mississippi and Alabama.
   One twister smashed into the Florida Panhandle town of East Point
early Thursday night, destroying several homes. A mother, her
daughter and grandson were killed in one home, officials said.
   The violent weather began developing along the Gulf Coast on
Wednesday, when a man who sought shelter in a metal-roofed shed near
Stapleto, Ala., was killed by lightning.
   Tornadoes skipped across several Louisiana parishes early
Thursday.
   One twister struck the small town of Grosse Tete, La., about 6
a.m. Thursday, destroying at least 25 residences and injuring about
two dozen people, in addition to the man and woman killed,
authorities said.
   ``We can't imagine how more aren't dead,'' Willie Hurdle, a
member of the Iberville Parish Police Jury, said of the town of 790
people. ``This is devastating. There's about 20 houses that aren't
even here anymore.''
   No serious injuries were reported 15 miles away in Baton Rouge,
where Fire Chief Ron Spillman said at least four twisters touched
down 19 times, destroying or damaging almost 70 mobile homes and 25
to 30 houses.
   Spillman estimated that between 400 and 600 people lived in the
destroyed or damaged residences. A shelter was set up at a high
school for those left homeless.
   Pieces of mobile homes were strewn in tree tops in Grosse Tete.
About 100 people were evacuated and were put up in emergency
shelters, Hurdle said. The storm left the town without electricity,
natural gas, water and most telephone service.
   One elderly woman was rescued from the rubble of her home after
rescuers used a power saw to cut through a pile of wood. Dogs were
taken to the area to search for more bodies and trapped survivors.
   Gov. Buddy Roemer toured the area by helicopter and Rep. Clyde
Holloway, R-La., said he would seek a federal disaster declaration.
   Over a two-hour period, tornadoes also were reported in the
parishes of West Baton Rouge, St. Helena, Livingston and Tangipahoa.
The early morning tornadoes in southeastern Louisiana followed a
night of violent weather in the western and central part of the
state in which several homes were destroyed or damaged late
Wednesday, but no serious injuries were reported.
   A line of thunderstorms that pounded the Florida Panhandle
produced several tornadoes. One ripped through East Point, about 85
miles southeast of Tallahassee, at about 7 p.m. EDT.
   Three houses and three mobile homes were destroyed and two
businesses heavily damaged, Franklin County Sheriff's deputies said.
The three people killed were a 16-year-old boy, his mother, 33, and
his grandmother, 51.
   Other tornadoes destroyed a house, damaged a supermarket and
knocked down two temporary buildings. At least 6 inches of rain fell
at Milton, the National Weather Service reported.
   A U.S. park ranger suffered a broken arm and cuts Thursday when a
tornado destroyed the entrance station at the Fort Pickens section
of the Gulf Islands National Seashore on the western Florida
Panhandle. She was thrown 10 to 15 yards and only the concrete
foundation of the station was left, officials said.
   Another tornado hit Ellisville, Miss., damaging buildings and
uprooting trees. Trees and power lines were down across from the
campus of Jones County Community College, where summer classes were
underway, but officials said there was no campus damage as earlier
reported.
   Mississippi Power Co. official Dana Hill said most power in
Ellisville was restored by early afternoon.
   Heavy rain was reported in several areas of Mississippi during
the night, with up to 4 inches on coastal sections.
   A half-mile section of U.S. 49 near Brooklyn, Miss., was closed
after water gushed around an overloaded culvert and cut a tunnel
underneath the two-lane roadbed, Highway Department resident
engineer Ed Schaub said. The roadbed did not wash out, but a section
of pavement about 12 feet long cracked and dropped about 18 inches.
   Tornadoes touched down in several communities on the Alabama
coast, causing minor injuries and destroying two homes in Orange
Beach, damaging 23 others, and overturning a mobile home in
Robertsdale, said Lee Helms of the state Emergency Management
Agency. More than a dozen mobile homes were damaged in Bay Minette,
and a house was damaged in Lillian, near the Florida border,
officials said.
   At Gulf Shores, Ala., Police Chief Arthur Bourne said the coastal
resort experienced ``a little beach erosion, high winds and heavy
rain. But mostly we've just hit-and-missed with tornadoes and water
spouts.''
   Alabama Power Co. reported that 22,000 customers in the Mobile
area were without power. Lightning apparently struck a substation
that caught fire, power company spokesman Bernie Fogarty said. The
city got 2 inches of rain between midnight and noon.
