   A tornado tore apart an upstate New York school cafeteria wall,
killing seven children, a meteorologist concluded today after
studying the violent storms that caused damage, flooding and at
least 11 deaths in the Northeast.
   Thursday's storms came from the system that spun off tornadoes
in eight states in the South and Midwest on Wednesday. The two-day
toll: at least 29 dead and hundreds injured, including 17 dead and
1,000 homeless in Huntsville, Ala., and a death in Canada.
   President Bush today issued a disaster declaration for tornado
victims in Huntsville, making the city eligible for federal relief
programs, said Gov. Guy Hunt's press secretary, Terry Abbott.
   Hunt said he believed damage exceeded $100 million, although
teams assessing the destruction were not expected to come up with a
figure until later.
   Authorities and witnesses in Newburgh, N.Y., about 60 miles
north of New York City, said it appeared a tornado was responsible
for the death and destruction at East Coldenham Elementary School.
   Roland Loffredo, meteorologist in charge of the National Weather
Service's Albany office, examined the damage this morning and said
it and the eyewitness acounts led him to believe a strong tornado
caused the disaster.
   The brick, cinder block and glass wall, about 30 feet high and
50 feet wide, caved in on as many as 125 first-, second- and
third-graders as they were eating lunch, said Town of Newburgh
Police Chief John Kulisek.
   The wall was last inspected in 1984 and rotting wood was
discovered around some windows, said Valley Central School
Superintendent James Coonan.
   ``As part of our ongoing renovation, the defective wood was
replaced five years ago,'' he said. Afterward, he said, ``it was as
strong as it could be.''
   Besides the seven killed, 18 children were injured, three
critically. All the victims were 6 to 9 years old.
   Town of Newburgh police Lt. John J. Mahoney said he arrived 10
minutes after the wall collapsed to find children calling out from
under the rubble.
   ``Some were screaming, some were lying there very quiet,''
Mahoney said. ``You could hear them under the debris calling for
help, calling `Take me home, take me home.'''
   District schools were closed today, and school officials were
assembling counselors to help pupils when classes resume Monday.
   Kulisek said an investigation would begin today into why the
wall collapsed.
   A tornado knocked over trees and ripped roofs off houses in West
Virginia's Eastern Panhandle, the National Weather Service
confirmed. Storms also caused flooding in Washington, D.C., blew
windows out of skyscrapers in Philadelphia, destroyed a house in
Piscataway, N.J., and overturned cars and blew the roof off a
shopping mall in Quebec.
   The weather service also confirmed a second tornado Thursday, in
Montgomery County in southeastern Pennsylvania. It ripped the roof
off a building housing federal offices in King of Prussia, causing
four minor injuries.
   A truck driver died when his tractor-trailer overturned in high
winds on a bridge connecting Elizabeth, N.J., and New York City. A
New York City woman died after being hit by a steel beam blown off
a water tower. A Camden, N.J., man died when winds picked him up
and smashed him to the ground, authorities said.
   Quebec provincial police suspected a tornado was responsible for
widespread damage in St. Hilaire, a small community southeast of
Montreal.
   Winds of more than 124 mph blew the roof off a shopping mall,
overturned cars, shattered windows, knocked down trees and hurled
mailboxes hundreds of yards in the center of St. Hilaire, a town
official said.
   In Richmond, just east of St. Hilaire, a man was killed when his
car was hit by a school bus during the high winds, Quebec
provincial police official Bertrand Fortin said.
   The storm system, churning around a collision of record warm air
and extremely cold air, also was blamed for one death Wednesday in
Alorton, Ill. Gov. James R. Thompson said Thursday he would seek
federal disaster aid for the southern Illinois town.
   In Huntsville, the tornado covered between eight and 10 miles
with wind speeds as high as 250 mph. ``It's like taking six to 10
city blocks and putting them in a blender and putting it on
liquefy,'' said rescue worker Bob Caraway.
   Winds of up to 100 mph blew out windows in Philadelphia
skyscrapers and tore a hole in the roof of the l at
Philadelphia International Airport.
   Winds brought down power lines and damaged generating stations,
leaving at least 180,000 customers temporarily without electricity
in PennsylvaOverseas Terminania, New York and eastern Connecticut, utility
officials said.
