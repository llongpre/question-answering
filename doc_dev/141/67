   Tornadoes killed a child, injured at
least 14 people and destroyed or damaged scores of buildings in
northern and eastern Oklahoma, authorities said.
   One twister, bearing winds of 100 mph, cut a milelong swath in
Stillwater, hitting residential areas and the Oklahoma State
University campus. At least three other tornadoes touched down in
Oklahoma Tuesday night.
   A 4-year-old was killed in Stillwater as his mother drove to a
relative's home to take shelter, authorities said. Authorities said
the mother, who was cut, was unable to explain exactly what
happened when the storm overtook them.
   The tornadoes destroyed 17 homes and two businesses in this city
of 40,000, said police Lt. Kirk Mittelstet. He said 164 homes, five
apartment complexes, three schools, 12 businesses and two mobile
homes were damaged.
   About 40 housing units on the university campus were reported
damaged, and the storm tore part of the roof off the physical
education center.
   At least seven other people in Stillwater were treated for
injuries. The worst injury was a 75-year-old man who broke a hip.
   A twister hit the ground around midnight in Foyil, about 30
miles northeast of Tulsa, injuring at least six people as it plowed
across four miles of farmland.
   A tornado ripped off a roof near Kellyville, southwest of Tulsa,
and another twister west of Oklahoma City terrorized patrons and
workers inside an El Reno truck stop when it touched down near
Interstate 40.
   With power lines down, residents of Stillwater and Foyil waited
for daylight today to reveal the extent of the damage.
   ``I'm going to go back tomorrow and see what happened,'' said
Stillwater resident Jean Annesley, who spent the night in a Red
Cross shelter after her home was hit. ``It's going to kill me. But
I'll survive it.''
   Mike Field stood in his yard and looked at the wreckage from a
school roof that littered the inside and outside of his heavily
damaged house. He and his family had made it to shelter.
   ``When we were driving back, I saw a lot of trees down and
thought that maybe the trees here in my front yard would be
damaged,'' Field said.
   ``We turned the corner, the first thing I saw was the roof gone.
My wife started crying. What are you going to do?''
