   When the ``Albion Tornado'' roared toward
East State Street three years ago, Earl Rice ran to warn his wife,
Ruth, on their front porch ``when I saw the wind pick her up and
throw her over the rail.''
   Across the street, the Rev. Robert J. Reilly prayed hard as the
gathering winds sucked him toward a second-floor window and his
strength ebbed.
   Next door, 5-year-old Katie Steff screamed ``Tornado coming!''
as her father, Samuel, huddled the family above their funeral home.
In a moment of eerie silence a few seconds later, Steff knew they
were in the eye of the huge twister.
   Forty-one tornadoes, including nine of the highest intensities,
swept through Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and Ontario during eight
hours of May 31, 1985, killing 88 people and injuring more than
1,000.
   The tornado outbreak, worst since April 1975, caused $450
million in property damage in the United States.
   Of the dead, 62 were killed in their houses or mobile homes and
a disproportionate number, 15, were between 66 and 70 years old,
according to the National Weather Service.
   The Albion tornado was among the worst, packing winds estimated
at up to 260 miles per hour as it fell upon farmland on the
Ohio-Pennsylvania border. The twister, estimated at 1,200 feet
across, quickly moved northeast through this pleasant crossroads
town near Lake Erie on a 14-mile tear that killed 12 people.
   ``I watch the sky now, just like everyone else,'' Mayor Bonda
Dahlin said recently. ``Tornadoes were Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska
kind of things. But I don't think it's something we'll ever
forget.''
   ``People here still cringe the minute there's a dark cloud in
the sky. There's such anticipation,'' said Borough Secretary Paul
McKnight.
   Rice, 72, a retired railroad worker, heard the first frantic
warnings on the police scanner and ran to the door to see his wife
get swept away. He woke up trapped in his own house.
   ``I started hollering,'' Rice recalled. ``There were timbers all
over me. The beams were across my legs and I couldn't move. They
tried to jack up the beams, but that just put more pressure on my
legs. Then they got a chain saw and cut the beams in half and
pulled me out.''
   Rice suffered only cuts and bruises. His wife suffered broken
arms and a dislocated shoulder.
   Reilly, 68, pastor of St. Lawrence Roman Catholic Church, was in
his rectory's living room ``when the roof went off and the windows
went out.''
   ``I kind of spread-eagled in front of the window as the thing
began to suck me out. I grabbed anything. I just hung on until it
ended,'' Reilly said. ``I asked God to make it that I was ready to
meet Him.''
   The church and rectory were destroyed, but two days later Reilly
said Mass under a tarpaulin in the ruins.
   Steff, 43, a mortician, gathered his wife, four daughters and a
friend in the family room of their second-floor apartment. Katie
screamed just as Albion's fire siren began to wail.
   ``Then something hit the house and we all got into the bathroom.
Things just bombarded the building,'' Steff recalled. ``Then we
heard a silence, just for a second, like in the eye of a hurricane.
Then everything hit us from the other side. Patty, my wife, opened
the door of the family room and it was gone.''
   The Steffs' business and home were destroyed, a $200,000 loss.
   Steff ran across the street to help free Cathy Gibson from her
three-story Victorian house, which was down.
   ``I called into the debris to tell her help was coming,'' Steff
said. ``Later, she told me she was never so glad to hear an
undertaker's voice.''
   A deputy Erie County coroner, Steff helped set up a morgue at
Northwestern High School. They brought in 11 bodies.
   Today, the tornado's southwest-to-northeast path can be clearly
seen in rebuilt split-level houses and new mobile homes, grassy
lots and sharply pruned oak trees that make the east side of Albion
look like a new subdivision.
   It was only a few months ago, McKnight said, that he ``closed
the books'' on Albion's claims with federal and state disaster
officials.
   Mayor Dahlin estimated that fewer than 200 of the town's 1,800
people moved away after the tornado ``because of memories, lack of
money or whatever.''
   ``People are getting on with their lives,'' she said.
``Businesses are being rebuilt, changing hands, and there are new
ones.''
   Reilly's modern new 400-seat church is linked by a glass
breezeway to a new three-bedroom rectory. Behind, a new recreation
building stands in red brick. The complex cost $1.1 million, he
said.
   ``One of the greatest experiences of my life, as tragic as it
was, was to see the spirit of the people of this town. They took a
tragic blow. They rebuilt the town,'' Reilly said.
   ``It's almost profane to say it was a good thing, but the bottom
line is that the community is stronger and closer knit and the town
is even physically better with all the new construction,'' he said.
   The Steffs, fully insured, rebuilt their small funeral home with
two viewing rooms, but took the opportunity to move their living
quarters to a house in another part of town.
   ``We shed our tears over it. We're trying to get our lives
together. You can dwell on the negatives, but the positives are the
concern and the love of the community,'' Steff said.
   ``When I walked out the door that day, I knew I was going to
stay.''
   The Rices built a modern two-bedroom split-level house. ``It's
starting to feel like home,'' Rice said with a shrug.
   ``You still think about it. Last September, I had an operation
for cancer and when I was in the recovery room, I thought I was
still under the house,'' he said.
   ``I don't want to see another one.''
