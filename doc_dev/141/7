   Robert Whitesel had lived on Nuclear
Drive for 29 years, and the street name seemed grimly appropriate
as he surveyed the tornado-whipped wreckage of his house and those
of his neighbors.
   ``You have to laugh _ you can't cry,'' Whitesel said Wednesday.
``I'll probably rebuild it. In the meantime, I'll live with my
daughter.''
   At least 24 people were killed and more than 300 injured Tuesday
by the tornadoes, which steamrolled virtually without warning
across a region known as ``Tornado Alley,'' about 35 miles
southwest of Chicago. Damage was estimated at more than $100
million.
   Hit hardest were the small towns of Crest Hill and Plainfield,
where hundreds were left homeless.
   National Guardsmen in Crest Hill used dogs, foot patrols and
infrared photography to search for more victims in a muddy
cornfield but found none.
   Six people were believed missing from a seven-building apartment
complex next to the field. At least nine deaths occurred near the
apartments.
   Plainfield residents packed a high school gym Wednesday night to
hear how various government agencies could help. President Bush
declared the region a disaster area and Illinois offered at least
$25 million for low-interest loans.
   The crowd observed a moment of silence for those who died. Then
they got down to the needs of the living _ getting shelter,
portable toilets for neighborhoods without running water, trash
bins for the untold tons of debris.
   More than 70 people remained hospitalized today, at least 11 in
critical condition, authorities said. In addition, a Plainfield man
died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator he used when
power was lost in his home.
   And four people were injured today, one critically, when a
mobile kitchen sent in for relief workers exploded and caught fire.
   The explosion occurred when a propane tank overflowed while
being filled from a supply truck and the fuel was ignited by a
flame from a stove in the kitchen set up in a truck trailer, Fire
Chief George Plese said.
   A fire official had to clamp a hose leading from the supply
truck to the kitchen tanks, cut it, then pull the truck away to
stop the fire. ``We had a very dangerous situation,'' Plese said.
   Utility crews worked through the night to restore telephone and
electric service. About 5,000 customers remained without
electricity, officials said.
   The Red Cross, Salvation Army and other charitable groups were
out in force, but self-sufficiency also was evident.
   ``It's the kind of community where neighbors or family say `Stay
with us,' '' said the Rev. Donald Niswonger as he dished out beef
stew, pizza and lasagna at the Plymouth Congregational Church in
Plainfield.
   In Joliet, Roman Catholic Archbishop Joseph Imesch said an
evening Mass for the victims and their families. The tornado ``will
be a reminder of how fragile life is,'' he said.
   At Plainfield High School, newly hired English teacher Jerry
O'Shea stood amid water and broken glass in front of a shattered
trophy case in the main hallway.
   ``This was going to be my first day teaching,'' O'Shea said.
``Welome to Plainfield. I don't know what I'll do now.''
   Most stores along Plainfield's main street were shuttered, but
two insurance agencies were doing brisk business. ``We've had
three-dozen calls since 8 o'clock this morning,'' said Mike Hull of
Plainfield Insurance Agency Inc.
