   Heavy rains battered Tennessee, Missouri and Arkansas today
after spawning tornadoes that ripped roofs from buildings and
homes. A toddler swept from his mother's arms was presumed drowned
in floodwaters and an Indiana woman apparently was electrocuted.
   Much of Arkansas was under a tornado watch early today; the
mayor in Fargo, N.D., declared a state of emergency after the Red
River overflowed its banks; and ski resorts in Colorado reveled
after an 18-inch snowfall.
   Severe thunderstorms blew through western Tennessee on Monday,
demolishing part of an aluminum processing processing plant in Mt.
Pleasant. Tornadoes followed the storm and destroyed homes and
uprooted buildings, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported, said Roy Chaffin, a Mount Pleasant
police dispatcher.
   The storms were accompanied by hail, rain and spectacular
lightening. Many areas reported downed trees, signs, roof damage
and electrical failures.
   At least two tornadoes touched down in southeastern Missouri,
ripping roofs off farm buildings and blowing over a mobile home,
authorities said.
   A tornado was sighted just south of Poplar Bluff, but no
injuries were reported, said Tina Barnett, a Butler County
sheriff's dispatcher.
   Tornadoes were spotted throughout Arkansas late Monday, but
there were no reports of injuries or serious damage.
   However, the National Weather Service placed most of the state _
65 of Arkansas' 75 counties _ under a tornado watch that ended
early today.
   In Indiana, officials resumed their search today for a
16-month-old boy swept from his mother's arms as she tried to get
him to safety.
   The 35-year-old mother told police she had just picked up her
children from a babysitter and was going home when her car stalled
on a gravel road in southern Indiana.
   By the time the floodwaters reached the window, she was able to
get her 4- and 5-year-old child out of the car, said Capt. Rick
Barr of the Gibson County Sheriff's Department.
   The woman thought she had the toddler in her arms, but he was
swept away, Barr said.
   An Evansville woman either drowned or was electrocuted in 5
inches of water on the city's northside, police said. An autopsy
was scheduled today on Gretchen Brown, 27, who was found by police
at 2:15 a.m.
   A utility pole was near her body and Southern Indiana Gas and
Electric Co. workers measured 180 volts in a fence nearby.
   A tornado Monday at Grayville in southern Illinois toppled trees
and utility poles, overturned cars and trucks and tore metal roofs
off of barns. Baseball-sized hail clunked down on the community of
2,000 people.
   In Fargo, Mayor Jon Lindgren said he was surprised by the speed
with which runoff from melting snow and rain sent the Red River
over its banks.
   ``It did really catch everyone by surprise ... a new twist of
events,'' he said. ``Of course, we know that's true during the
thaw. If the temperature goes outside a standard deviation range
and you get a little rain on top of it, it just changes instantly.''
   Lindgren declared a state of emergency, clearing the way for
construction of temporary dikes and the leasing of pumps to fend
off flood waters.
   Up river, hundreds of volunteers filled sandbags to shore up
dikes in Breckenridge, Minn., and neighboring Wahpeton, where
flooding caused by ice jams, runoff and rain threatened low-lying
areas.
   Ski resort operators in Colorado were happy following a six-day
storm that left up to 5 feet of snow in the mountains. The storm
did cause intermittent road problems and left the avalanche danger
high.
   The storm brought 18 inches to some areas on Monday, temporarily
closing Vail Pass.
   ``For this time of year, to have this kind of a sustained snow,
is very rare,'' said Knox Williams, forecaster with the Colorado
Avalanche Information Center. ``The storms usually hit and get out
within 24 or 48 hours.
