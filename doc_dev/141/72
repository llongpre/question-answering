   Tornadoes and waterspouts roared through
three eastern counties Thursday, ripping roofs off houses,
destroying some mobile homes and slightly injuring one person,
authorities said.
   Twisters were spotted in Currituck, Tyrrell and Washington
counties. A tornado warning was issued for Dare County, although no
damage was reported there.
   Randy Spear of Creswell said he heard wind, then saw branches and
small trees fly through the air just before he spotted the tornado.
   ``I grabbed my dog and ran toward the center bathroom in the
house, and as I left the den, the back window just caved in,'' Spear
said. He said he and his Labrador retriever, Fanci, were unhurt.
   Spear said the twister blew out the windows in the back of his
home and tossed four trees onto his roof.
   The twister blew the roofs of two other houses, destroyed four
mobile homes and damaged three others in the Creswell area, said
Linda Spruill, a sheriff's deputy. She said 75 to 80 trees were
blown onto U.S. 64, and many of them knocked down power lines.
   More than 1,000 customers were without electricity, an official
of North Carolina power said. North Carolina Power hoped to restore
power to the area by the end of the day, said C.B. Davis, operations
supervisor. '
   A woman was treated at Chowan Hospital in Edenton for minor
injuries after her mobile home was destroyed by a tornado, the
hospital said.
   Some small tornadoes and waterspouts were reported over the
northern beaches of the Outer Banks and the Currituck Sound, the
National Weather Service said.
   A waterspout raged ashore at Point Harbor in Currituck County,
throwing a construction trailer into a bulldozer and ripping the
roof off a warehouse.
   A tornado blew over a mobile home and tore the roofs off some
other buildings in Point Harbor, but no injuries were reported, the
weather service said.
   In Tyrrell County, three mobile homes and a house were destroyed
by tornado-like wind, said Buddy Swain, an emergency management
coordinator in Columbia. About 200 trees and a number of power lines
were knocked down in the storm, but no injuries were reported.
   The wind was spawned by thunderstorms moving through eastern
North Carolina, the weather service said.
