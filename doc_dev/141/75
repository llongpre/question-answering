A tornado pulverized a path across Stillwater, Okla., leaving a 4-year-old boy 
dead as it smashed cars, blew away roofs and drove wooden planks from shredded 
rafters 2 and 3 feet deep into yards. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the tornadoes, torrential rain, hail and floods struck the nation's 
midsection, while Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana kept fighting roiling 
floodwaters, the National Weather Service reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Eight people were injured in the Stillwater tornado late Tuesday and more than 
200 homes and businesses destroyed or damaged. More than 200 people were 
evacuated from homes and from where power lines on the ground posed a threat, 
said Stillwater Police Lt. Kirk Mittelstet. 
</P>
<P>
A tornado also struck near Foyil in northeastern Oklahoma, injuring eight 
people and damaging 10 homes. Gov. Henry Bellmon promised he would seek federal 
disaster aid. 
</P>
<P>
Mittelstet said some looting had been reported. Police and a National Guard 
unit cordoned off 1 square mile with the heaviest damage in Stillwater. Only 
residents, authorities and the media were allowed in. 
</P>
<P>
In Missouri, 275 residents were evacuated in Kansas City as the swollen Blue 
River spilled over its banks. Storms dropped up to 3 inches of rain at 
Lockwood, about 25 miles northwest of Springfield. Southwestern Missouri was 
under a flash-flood watch and more storms were expected, said Jim Lee, weather 
service specialist. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy rain flooded residential areas in Champaign, Ill., and University of 
Illinois student Mark Drendel reported up to 3 feet of water in places. "It 
looks like a river more than anything. Cars are under water." 
</P>
<P>
In the South, flooding from the Red River reached Louisiana, after inundating 
thousands of acres in Arkansas and Texas. Flooding from the Red River forced 
about 400 people in Shreveport, La., to evacuate low-lying homes and a number 
of roads were under water. 
</P>
<P>
Midway between Alexandria and Shreveport, the Red River was up to a mile wide. 
</P>
<P>
In other spots, horses and cattle huddled on small islands amid the flooding. 
</P>
<P>
In sections where flooding appeared imminent, levees were reinforced with extra 
dirt then covered with plastic sheeting and more sandbags. 
</P>
<P>
In flood-stricken South Texas, the Trinity River Authority released a record 
88,000 cubic feet of water per second through the floodgates at Lake Livingston 
Dam toward the Gulf of Mexico to relieve a Trinity River swollen in places to 
10 miles wide. 
</P>
<P>
The Federal Emergency Management Agency extended a presidential disaster area 
Wednesday to four more Texas counties, bringing the total to 33 counties 
eligible for government assistance because of severe weather and flooding since 
April 15. 
</P>
<P>
Liberty County officials warned holdout residents in low areas along the 
Trinity to join about 7,000 others who have evacuated in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Among the holdouts are Joe and Annie Loftin, who fished from the porch of their 
new stilt home as water crept to their steps and soaked the net of a basketball 
hoop on a nearby cottonwood tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody better pull the plug, my St. Augustine grass has done been watered," 
Joe Loftin said.

blasted across the city of Stillwater. The storm, which also injured eight 
people, left smashed cars and roofless homes in its path. Meanwhile, the

and Louisiana continued to fight roiling floodwaters. In Stillwater, left, a
