   A pre-dawn tornado exploded through this
rural North Florida community Tuesday, killing four people,
destroying homes, throwing people from their beds and leaving much
of a college campus in ruins.
   Only rubble was left in some neighborhoods after the tornado cut
a swath 12 miles long and at least a half-mile wide about 4:30 a.m.
Eighteen people suffered injuries requiring hospital treatment. The
mobile home of two of those who were killed vanished from its lot,
leaving only foundation blocks.
   Families were thrown out of bed while windows exploded and their
homes collapsed on top of them.
   ``I woke up with a roaring sound and as soon as I woke up, the
windows blew out on both sides of my bed, and the roof came down on
top of me,'' said Mitchell May, who was pinned in the debris for
three hours.
   His neighbor, Diane Dempsey, said she and her husband, Pat, had
only moments to rush their three children, ages 4 to 11, into the
bathroom before the tornado hit.
   ``They were screaming `are we dying, are we dying?''' she said.
``Then it was over as soon as it started.''
   It was Florida's worst tornado since 1966 when a twister crossed
the state from Clearwater to Cape Kennedy, killing 11 and injuring
400 people. In 1962 a tornado on the Florida Panhandle killed 17
people and injured 100.
   Gov. Bob Martinez flew to inspect the scene and said he intended
to sign an emergency order allowing state and federal aid.
   ``It's been tragic,'' said Martinez.
   Lawmen from the state and surrounding counties were already on
hand, and state prisoners were expected soon to help with the
cleanup, said Sheriff Joe Peavy.
   The twister's destructive path started in front of a shopping
center and headed straight into North Florida Community College,
where it ``totaled the new library and took the roof off the
auditorium,'' Peavy said.
   College President William H. McCoy estimated damage at between
$20 million and $25 million. Three of the campus' 14 buildings were
destroyed and nine heavily damaged, he said.
   It also demolished numerous homes, blew the roof off a nearby
church, overturned cars and knocked down trees, Peavy said.
   It ripped apart the only obstetrical clinic serving a
four-county area around Madison, leaving 350 to 400 mothers a year
without a place to have their babies, said Betsy Stone, executive
director of the Tri-County Community Medical Center. No one was
injured there, however.
   The worst damage was in the vicinity of Pinetta, a cross-roads
neighborhood near Madison.
   ``I almost fell to my knees it was so strong,'' said Otis
Williams, 69. His son's home across the street was destroyed.
   Also in Pinetta, the bodies of Robert and Lavelle McCullough
were thrown 100 yards and their mobile home disappeared, leaving
behind only a dozen cinder blocks on a bare patch of ground.
   Mrs. McCullough's sister, Dorothy Butler of nearby Jennings,
surveyed the damage a few hours after learning her sister had died.
   ``It didn't leave any of it. Not even a dish,'' she said
disbelievingly. ``You'd never know there was a trailer here.''
   Sheriff's spokesman Juan Botino identified the two other victims
as Walter Oliver Jr. and Dearmiste Pinesett. Of the 18 injuries,
two of the more seriously hurt were flown 50 miles to Tallahassee
Memorial Regional Medical Center. Brad Williams, 14, was in serious
condition Tuesday after surgery for a punctured kidney, and Mary
Kay Smith was in fair condition with a chest injury, a spokesman
said. Ms. Smith's age was unavailable.
   Two others remained in good condition in Madison County Memorial
Hospital, administrator Jeannie Baker said.
   About 100 miles to the west, two tornadoes touched down in
Jackson County, causing two minor injuries and destroying three
houses and a mobile home, as well as heavily damaging five other
homes, said John Mader, the county emergency management director.
   The same storm that spawned the tornadoes swept through south
Georgia late Monday and early Tuesday, ripping off roofs, tearing
down trees and injuring at least four people in mobile homes that
were tossed about by strong winds.
