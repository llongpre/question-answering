   Authorities cordoned off this town of 3,000
today, and called out the National Guard to help residents recover
from a tornado that killed two people and injured 19.
   The tornado Tuesday night carved a 100-mile path through the
flat countryside for 2{ hours, leaving about 100 ruined houses in
its wake.
   ``I looked out our back door and I saw this thing coming,'' City
Administrator Jay Weiland said. ``I thought `Oh, my God, there goes
my town.'''
   National Guard troops arrived about midnight to help with the
cleanup and prevent looting. Law enforcement officers were allowing
only emergency personnel, residents and reporters into the area
this morning.
   The National Weather Service warned today of more twisters in
Texas and Oklahoma. More than two dozen funnel clouds touched down
Tuesday across the Plains from Texas to Iowa, including more than a
dozen in south-central Kansas.
   The dead in the Hesston area, just north of Wichita, were a
6-year-old boy and a 68-year-old woman. A missing woman and her
teen-age son were found safe.
   The killer tornado touched down southwest of Hesston, cut a
1{-block-wide swath through the community, then moved along to the
northeast, chewing up farmhouses in Marion and Morris counties.
   ``I saw at least four to five houses that had roofs torn off,''
said Kenneth Kaluhiokalani in Morris County. ``Belongings were
scattered through the yards and glass was shattered in houses.''
   From 75 to 100 houses were damaged in Hesston; 19 farmhouses
were damaged in Marion County and at least five in Morris County.
   Six-year-old Lucas Fischer of Burrton, a few miles south of
Hesston, was pronounced dead Tuesday evening at Halstead Hospital,
said house supervisor Marian Krallman. His brother, 12-year-old
Garrett, was in satisfactory condition with head injuries.
   Harvey County Sheriff's investigator Byron Motter said the boys
were among seven people huddled in a basement to escape the storm
when a chimney and fireplace collapsed.
   ``We were in the basement no more than a minute or two, then it
crashed,'' said Paul Wedel, a neighbor who had sought refuge there.
   Ruth Voth, 68, died when the tornado swept into her home near
Goessel, about 10 miles northeast of Hesston, authorities said.
   Authorities said 19 people were treated at area hospitals for
storm-related injuries, and at least two were in critical condition.
   About 50 people made homeless spent the night at Hesston High
School, said principal Marvin Estes.
   There was no electricity or gas in the town, and workers were
making emergency repairs to the water system, said Jay Wieland,
Hesston City administrator.
   Winds from the tornado blew off the roof of a Pizza Hut
restaurant, and about 15 customers and employees huddled in a
walk-in freezer and bathrooms. No one was injured.
   Residents of Hesston had a warning. One twister dissipated
before reaching the town, and sirens sounded half an hour before
the second funnel entered town at 5:30 p.m.
   Clarence Froese was taking care of his invalid son-in-law in
Hesston when the tornado struck.
   ``We had just put him on a sheet and drug him into the basement
when the storm hit,'' said Froese. ``I didn't know what happened
until I got back out. It was devastation all over.''
