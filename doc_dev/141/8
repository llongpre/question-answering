   Biology teacher Stephen Hunt died when a
tornado grabbed a truck in front of Plainfield High School and
dropped it onto the second floor of the science department, where
he worked.
   Only rooms away, business teacher Linda Kinnikin survived
unscathed.
   Behind the school, which was demolished, the twister leveled
Shirley and Gene Fassiotto's home, plucking their car from a now
nonexistent garage and depositing it upside down where the living
room once stood.
   Across the street, Lois Moffitt's brick ranch-style house still
stands.
   The capriciousness of the tornadoes that spun across northern
Illinois on Tuesday is painfully obvious to the survivors of the
storms.
   ``They say tornadoes touch down and jump all over the place,''
Mrs. Kinnikin said, shaking her head Wednesday as she examined the
rubble that killed her colleague.
   ``In a matter of a minute's time, it all changed,'' she said.
   The death toll climbed to 27 Thursday when a 3-year-old girl and
16-year-old boy died of injuries they suffered in the storms. More
than 300 people were injured.
   Hunt had been talking with Mrs. Kinnikin only a few minutes
before the tornado hit.
   ``He was a dedicated teacher,'' Mrs. Kinnikin said softly, her
eyes brimming with tears.
   Asked how she survived, she shook her head.
   ``I heard so much debris hitting the windows of the building,''
she recalled. ``There was no visibility because the rain was coming
down so hard.
   ``And when the window blew, I took off running for the men's
bathroom. My department chair and I huddled together in the men's
bathroom. I said `Oh, my God' three times, and it was over.''
   When she climbed out of the rubble, she saw the walls in ruins,
the roof blown off, and smashed cars in the parking lot thrown into
a heap.
   At least two dozen people died in the tornadoes that hit Joliet,
Crest Hill and Plainfield, about 35 miles southwest of Chicago.
   The twisters left more than 1,000 homes uninhabitable and caused
over $100 million in damage. The region has been declared a state
and federal disaster area.
   And the random misfortunes didn't necessarily stop when the
storms left. On Thursday, a truck serving as a mobile kitchen for
relief workers exploded and caught fire in Joliet, injuring four
people, one critically.
   Authorities said a propane tank overflowed while being loaded
and the fuel was ignited by a flame from a stove.
   Three people died on the Plainfield school grounds during the
storm, including Hunt.
   Bruch Reed, 15, said Hunt had like been like a second father to
him.
   ``I've done so much thinking about the people who died,'' said
Reed, who was at a park a few blocks away when the storm hit and
who was unhurt.
   ``I suppose we should'' feel guilty, ``not just because I
survived, but because my house was untouched,'' Reed said.
   ``You always think it doesn't happen, and won't happen to you,''
he said. ``It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, it can
happen.''
   Shirley Fassiotto knows. Her home was reduced to boards, bricks
and plaster strewn about the lot.
   ``We had just gotten to the basement when the walls came down,''
she said.
   Glancing across the street at Mrs. Moffitt's home, she added:
``You wonder. ... She just missed the path (of the twister), who
knows how.''
   ``It doesn't matter what kind of house you have or where you're
situated, the path is so erratic,'' said Mrs. Moffitt, who was
visiting a daughter in Joliet when the storm hit. Windows in her
home were shattered, and the roof was slightly damaged.
   Across the street and down a few houses, Don Erikson, 60, was
less lucky. He was looking out his living room picture window when
the storm hit.
   The tornado drove chunks of glass into his body and threw him
onto the couch. It also tossed his furniture around like toys and
blew off the roof _ but left several paper cups sitting on a
counter.
   Erikson was in fair condition Thursday at a Joliet hospital.
``He lost a lot of blood,'' said his son, Jeff Erikson, 30.
