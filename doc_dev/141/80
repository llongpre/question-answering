   A tornado churned across a Texas highway Friday night, causing
accidents that killed at least two people and damaging nearby homes,
authorities said.
   At least 19 people were reported injured when the twister struck
along Farm Road 305 outside the West Texas town of Iraan, said state
Department of Public Safety spokesman Mike Cox.
   ``Apparently it struck cars on the highway and well as ranch
houses and possibly some oilfield-related structures in the area,''
Cox said.
   Two people were killed, in car accidents caused by the twister,
he said. There were five car accidents on 305 and four accidents on
another highway, he said.
   The injured included two state troopers cut by flying glass when
hail and high winds accompanying the tornado blew out the windows of
their patrol car on the road 230 miles northwest of San Antonio,
   Many of the injured were motorists, said Bonnie Burton, director
of nurses at McCamey County Hospital. ``But not all of them were in
cars,'' she said. ``We had one family whose whole house fell in on
them.''
   The twister also blew down an old gymnasium and damaged the
McCamey Water Supply, which warned the city's 2,400 residents to
conserve water for the next couple of days, said City Secretary
Stanley Bryson.
   Several other tornadoes were reported in the area.
   Elsewhere Friday, residents of the Texas Panhandle town of
Spearman cleared wreckage left in the wake of a swarm of funnel
clouds Thursday, and citizens in waterlogged Vicksburg, Miss., swept
out mud left by record flash flooding.
   Damage in Spearman was estimated at $5.5 million. Estimates were
still being collected in Vicksburg.
   About 200 Vicksburg residents were forced to higher ground
Thursday when thunderstorms dumped as much as 7 inches of rain,
overflowing creeks and drainage ditches.
   Water damage was reported to 187 homes and at least two
businesses. Some bridges and roadways in Warren County, on the
Mississippi River, also were damaged, said Civil Defense Chief
Luther Warnock Jr.
   ``We've even had fire trucks out using their hoses to help wash
the mud and debris out of houses before it dries,'' Warnock said.
``I've been been here for 30 years and ... this was the worst
flooding anyone can remember.''
   In Spearman, 10 mobile homes and 10 houses were reported
destroyed. A church also was reported demolished. Some of the mobile
homes were ``smoothed off to the ground,'' said Mayor Burl Buchanan.
   He estimated that 5 percent of the Panhandle town of 3,500 had
property damage. About 80 percent of the city was blacked out and
phone service was spotty until Friday morning.
   There was disagreement over just what caused the damage in
Spearman late Thursday. Residents and witnesses said three funnel
clouds caused the damage even though they didn't quite touch down.
The National Weather Service said one tornado did scour the surface.
   ``There was one that hit Spearman itself, and there were multiple
tornadoes in the vicinity of Spearman for several hours last
night,'' said Steven Cooper of the National Weather Service office
in Amarillo. ``There were about three different storm systems. Two
dropped tornadoes.''
   The funnel clouds were too numerous to count, he said.
   State Trooper Wayne Beighle of Amarillo said 10 twisters were
spotted in the area Thursday night.
   ``We were up there until 1:00 (a.m.), and there were still
tornadoes dancing around. They were all over the place,'' Beighle
said. ``None touched the ground _ they were hovering just above the
ground, but that was enough to do the damage.''
   In Vicksburg, officials declared a state of emergency Friday.
   ``Any time there is this kind of flood, where people are forced
to evacuate their homes, it is a bad situation,'' said Mayor Robert
Walker. ``And this time it was very bad.''
   ``I've been back to my home and everything is turned over and
destroyed,'' Hope Williams said after water drained from her home.
``That was my first year in the subdivision and I hope it was my
last year. I mean water was 6 feet deep in that house.''
   Williams and her six children, ranging from age 2 to 17, spent
the night with other flood victims at an emergency shelter.
   ``The water came up so rapidly that people didn't have time to
get out,'' Police Chief Jimmy Brooks said as he surveyed his own
soaked home. ``We had people in aluminum boats going up and down the
street trying to help others.''
