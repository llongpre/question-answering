   A tornado touched down twice, wrecking
businesses and homes and blowing tractor-trailers and cars off a
highway in this east-central Kansas city. At least 21 people were
injured, two seriously, authorities said today.
   Another tornado Thursday night destroyed two homes in central
Missouri. Severe thunderstorms with high winds demolished 10 small
planes, damaged roofs and buildings, uprooted trees and downed power
lines in central and northern Missouri. No injuries were reported in
the state.
   The Emporia tornado tore a half-mile swath of destruction through
businesses on the city's west side and another about a quarter-mile
long to the northwest, police said.
   ``The damage is pretty severe to businesses and to the
residential area on the northwest side of town,'' said Emporia
police officer Laramy Bargo.
   Charles Brooks, a deacon at the West Side Baptist Church, said
about 15 members of the church sought shelter in the church
basement. When some people went upstairs to pray at the altar,
Brooks said, he took a look outside.
   ``There was a large tornado with a large tail and we watched it
go by. It looked like you could reach out and touch it,'' he said by
telephone from the church basement. ``Then we came inside and gave a
good thanks to God for our safety.''
   A 4-month-old girl and her father were critically injured in
their home, said Emporia Police Capt. Bob Rodriguez. He said the man
was trying to bring his daughter to safety when they were hit by
flying debris.
   Nineteen other people were injured and treated at Emporia
hospitals, said Kristy Kelley, a Lyon County Sheriff's dispatcher.
She said about 25 homes and two businesses were damaged in the
county.
   A gas station was destroyed, but three employees who hid in a
bathroom were not injured. Only two walls of the bathroom were left
standing.
   A nearby rental business, a car dealership and a restaurant were
among buildings heavily damaged. Authorities said the roof of a
Coca-Cola bottling plant caved in, damaging trucks and trailers.
Three employees who took cover in an inner room escaped injury.
   Police said one semi-trailer traveling south on the Kansas
Turnpike was knocked over. The tractor was found 100 yards from its
trailer. Injuries to the driver were unknown.
   Two people in another semi were hurt when their vehicle was
knocked off an Interstate 35 bypass, authorities said.
   About 2,500 Emporia customers were without electricity, said Tom
Taylor, spokesman for KPL Gas Service.
   The National Guard was activated, and 25 troops guarded damaged
areas. Shelters were opened.
   In central Missouri, a tornado destroyed two homes in Moniteau
County, deputy sheriff Russell Borts said. Other homes and
outbuildings in the area also were damaged.
   The deputy said a second tornado touched down south of High
Point, but there was no damage.
   A storm earlier Thursday demolished 10 planes and damaged six
others at the Spirit of St. Louis Airport in Chesterfield. The wind
also tore the roof off a hangar, causing an estimated $250,000
damage, said the building's owner, Barry Stone.
   Single-engine aircraft outside were strewn about. Some were
tossed upside down and others were severely damaged.
   Dick Hrabko, director of aviation for St. Louis County, said the
storm moved in about 4 p.m. with winds clocked up to 100 mph.
   Storm winds also tore the roof off school offices in Wright City
in Warren County, uprooted trees and damaged roofs and buildings in
St. Charles and damaged some buildings in the Earth City area.
