   A tornado damaged about 30 businesses in
this western Oklahoma town, cut off electricity and choked streets
with debris.
   ``It went right down Main Street at least half a mile or more,''
said Chris Lee, a cameraman for KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City.
   The tornado destroyed a cafe and a saddle shop late Tuesday, but
it stayed out of residential areas, police dispatcher Don Jeffrey
said. Three or four residents suffered minor injuries, he said.
   Power came on for the first time since the storm while Jeffrey
was speaking to a reporter by telephone about 7:30 a.m. today.
   Firefighters had to clear debris from the front of the fire
department before they could respond to storm calls Tuesday night.
   ``It took me 25 minutes this morning to drive five blocks, so
that tells you how bad it is,'' Jeffrey said.
   Main Street was expected to remain blocked off today, he said.
   Ellis County sheriff's dispatcher Yulonda Taylor said that
before hitting Shattuck the tornado knocked over utility poles as
it crossed a highway about 14 miles southeast of Shattuck.
   The tornado reportedly stayed on the ground for about 30 miles.
   It developed from thunderstorms that erupted from the Texas
Panhandle into western Kansas, the National Weather Service said.
   Hail as big as softballs and tornadoes were reported in the
eastern Texas Panhandle.
   A tornado touched down near the Texas Panhandle town of
Shamrock, about 70 miles southwest of Shattuck, but there were no
immediate reports of injuries or serious damage.
