   Students romped in a gym one minute and
huddled in fear for their lives the next as a deadly tornado tore
their school away around them.
   Plainfield High School was razed in the path of a cluster of
tornadoes Tuesday that killed more than 20 people in a eight-mile
swath in northern Illinois.
   At least 175 students were at the school when the tornado
struck. Classes were to have begun today.
   ``All of a sudden we heard a big boom on the roof and then
everybody got down and the roof came off the small gym,'' said
Shawn Mazzoni, who was inside with dozens of students practicing
for fall sports.
   The crash was the only warning for the teachers and students
preparing for the school year. In minutes, winds ripped the
school's roof off and toppled the outside walls.
   Hail and whipping winds were precursors to the tornado, said
Principal Jim Waldorf, who was in the school. Students and teachers
suffered minor injuries, Waldorf said.
   ``I was inside, and things went flying by the window
horizontally,'' one teacher said. She did not give her name.
   Steve Schernerhorn, the soccer coach, said he and a group of
teachers and student athletes crouched in the halls as the roof was
blown off.
   ``We had some very short warnings. We immediately took cover,''
he said. He said about 25 houses near the school were destroyed.
   Cars were flipped over around the school. The roof was scattered
in pieces across the campus. A few interior walls teetered without
support. Broken glass littered the hallways.
   The spot where Mazzoni huddled for cover may have been the only
area left standing. ``The whole big gym fell down,'' he said.
``There was stuff flying all at us. The place where we were at was
the only thing standing still.''
