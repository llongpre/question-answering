<TEXT>     Andover Mayor Jack Finlason said 14 people, rather than the earlier
estimate of 20, died in the mobile-home park in this Wichita suburb.;    After
searchers picked through the rubble Sunday, Finlason said: "We are confident
we have uncovered all of the rubble. We are confident there are no other
victims out there.";    Up to 1,500 homeless;  Up to 1,500 Andover residents
were left homeless by the tornado, the first to strike the town since 1958.;  
 The tornadoes also killed three people in Oklahoma and six in Wichita and
three outlying Kansas counties. More than 200 people were injured, and
hundreds of homes were destroyed.;    Wichita hospitals treated 175 Andover
residents for storm-related injuries, and 14 were in critical or serious
condition Sunday, Butler County Coroner Ron Varner said.;    In Washington on
Sunday, President Bush urged Americans to pray for the victims and promised to
"do whatever we can to help.";    Trying to return to normal; Finlason said
the town of 4,300 would begin trying to return to normal today. He said
businesses would be open and people would be returning to work.;    But an
overnight curfew remained in effect, and Kansas National Guard troops were
expected to remain on duty until noon today. The School Board voted to suspend
classes today because school buildings were being used in the recovery
effort.;    "Certainly, we are going to recover. The question is how long is
it going to take," the mayor said.  </TEXT>
