   Japan's worst tornado in decades ripped through a
Japanese town just east of Tokyo, injuring 78 people and leaving
hundreds homeless, police said today.
   More than 5,000 households remained without electricity and 800
without working telephones today, police said. They said 250 people
whose homes were destroyed by Tuesday night's tornado were now
housed in a gymnasium.
   Electricity to 87,700 households was cut off after the tornado
passed through Mobara and nearby areas in Chiba prefecture, Tokyo's
eastern neighbor.
   The twister destroyed or damaged 938 homes or buildings and 162
cars as it passed through the community of about 77,000 people.
   No one was killed, but seven people were seriously injured,
police said. City officials estimated damage at $13 million.
   Weather bureau officials said small tornadoes occur several
times each year in Japan but that Tuesday's twister caused the
worst damage in decades.
   During the storm, lightning was reported in many areas. Near the
tornado area, at least one greenhouse covered with vinyl was torn
apart by hail.
   Television broadcasts showed residents going through their
wrecked homes today. Other people sat in severely damaged buildings
eating by candlelight.
   One resident told a television crew the tornado lifted his
parked car about three feet off the ground and hurled it several
yards.
