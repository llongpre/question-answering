   Mayor Jack Kinman was too busy leading
cleanup efforts Monday to mourn six neighbors and the loss of his
home in a tornado that tore through this southwest Indiana city last
weekend.
   ``We haven't had any time to worry about our loss. We just have
to think about everybody here,'' said Kinman, 70.
   Petersburg was hit hardest by weekend storms that left 14 people
dead throughout the Midwest and caused damage as far south as Texas.
All of Petersburg's 3,000 residents were without water Monday.
   President Bush on Monday authorized federal disaster assistance
to 19 Indiana counties ravaged by floods last month and tornadoes
during the weekend.
   Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio asked for similar assistance to two
counties in his state.
   After a tour of the stricken area on Sunday, Indiana Gov. Evan
Bayh said Petersburg looked like it had been bombed.
   Saturday's tornado turned Kinman's house on its foundation and
tore off the roof. Next door, the duplex where Giles Evans and Emma
Willis lived was leveled. They were among six people in the
Petersburg area who died in the storm.
   ``Those two were wonderful people,'' Kinman said. ``I've lived
here all my life, so of course I knew them all.''
   Eight people died in Indiana as a result of tornadoes that drove
across central and southern portions of the state Saturday night.
Two boys, ages 6 and 8, died Sunday in a second wave of storms that
spawned one tornado.
   The weekend storms also were blamed for two deaths in Wisconsin
and one each in Illinois and Missouri. Tornadoes also were reported
in Minnesota, Kentucky and Michigan.
   In Indiana, the American Red Cross estimated that 824 homes were
damaged, including 240 that were destroyed. In Petersburg alone, 114
homes were destroyed and 270 sustained more moderate damage.
   In Kentucky, 47 homes were damaged and a spokesman for the state
Department of Disaster and Emergency Services said storm destruction
could total as much as $5 million statewide.
   In Ohio, at least 1,600 homes and businesses in three
southwestern counties were damaged.
   Kinman said the scope of the tragedy was difficult to comprehend.
   ``I think most people are still stunned. They're in a state of
shock,'' he said.
   About 5,000 homes and business in Petersburg and Bedford, which
also was heavily damaged, were without electric service, said Pamela
K. Chapman, a spokeswoman for PSI Energy. She said power would be
restored to most areas by Tuesday.
   For the third consecutive week, Petersburg residents were urged
to boil all drinking water once service was restored. The city lost
its fresh water supply two weeks ago when floodwater broke the main
water line.
   In Petersburg and Bedford, people sorted through rubble and
carried away debris. A steady stream of dump trucks hauled away tree
limbs.
   The Red Cross and several churches offered meals and drinking
water.
   Mark Kraner, a Red Cross spokesman in Bedford, said the agency
was making an appeal for donations.
   ``We're not asking for clothing or food,'' Kraner said. ``We want
money so the money can come back into the local economy.''
   Two radio stations in Bloomington, 60 miles to the northeast,
launched a fund-raiser for victims. Vince Garmon, a spokesman for
WTTS-WGCL, said about $10,000 had been raised.
   ``Everybody's pulling together,'' said Valerie Zimmerman of
Petersburg. ``We have to or nobody will make it.''
