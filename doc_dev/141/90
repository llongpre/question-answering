Tornadoes touched down Thursday in Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia as a 
powerful storm surged through the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities said the twisters and accompanying thunderstorms damaged dozens of 
homes and left at least 15 people injured. 
</P>
<P>
The first two tornadoes touched down just after midnight in Pass Christian, 
Miss., on the Gulf Coast about 25 miles west of Biloxi. At least 30 homes were 
damaged, but no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Over the next several hours, heavy rain flooded two dozen homes and washed out 
a bridge in Hattiesburg, Miss., forcing the closing of about 40 streets. 
</P>
<P>
A tornado touched down just before dawn at Opp, Ala., injuring about 10 people 
and toppling trees and power lines throughout the town, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The storm knocked out power and covered streets with the mangled remains of 
trees. Witnesses said windows were blown out in downtown stores, and some 
neighborhoods had widespread damage. 
</P>
<P>
As the storm moved northeast, it left a path of destruction across several 
rural Alabama counties. At least 15 people were injured in Alabama. A tornado 
touched down at Columbus, Ga., but there were no reports of injuries or major 
damage.
