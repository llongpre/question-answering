   Waterlogged portions of Georgia and Alabama were declared
federal disaster areas today and residents of low-lying sections in
Mississippi stacked sandbags in preparation for more flooding this
weekend.
   President Bush declared nine northwestern Georgia counties to be
eligible for disaster assistance in the wake of last week's heavy
rains and tornadoes, and federal officials in Alabama added a dozen
counties to the six that already had been declared disaster areas
there.
   The declarations will make federal money available to people
whose homes or businesses were damaged in storms that have pounded
the Deep South since Feb. 10. Another round of thunderstorms and
tornadoes passed through the region on Thursday, causing some
serious damage in portions of Mississippi and Alabama and injuring
at least 30 people.
   Heavy thunderstorms or rain showers were reported Thursday from
Florida to Michigan. The wet weather was the result of low pressure
that was pulling moisture northward out of the Gulf.
   The new storm raised the threat of more flooding in Mississippi,
Alabama and Georgia, but the fears were largely unrealized. Some
residents of low-lying areas of southern Mississippi expect
flooding this weekend, however, as water rises in the Pascagoula
River from rainfall that occurred earlier upstream.
   ``Looks like Saturday and Sunday will be the two worst days down
here,'' said Hank Turk, director public safety in Mississippi's
Jackson County, where water was as much as 2 inches deep on 20 to
30 roads.
   Turk said there had been no mass evacuations and ``the people
involved have had experience with this sort of thing before. They
have already made preparations and they know when it is time to get
out.''
   While high water problems continued to plague the Gulf Coast, an
end to the heavy rain allowed other flood-damaged areas of southern
and eastern Mississippi to continue cleaning up.
   Disaster relief teams toured flood-damaged areas this week, and
Gov. Ray Mabus is expected to request federal disaster assistance.
   Tornadoes touched down Thursday along Mississippi's Gulf Coast
and in several places in rural Alabama. A powerful blast of wind
also swept through Columbus, Ga., but weather officials were
uncertain whether it was a tornado.
   The twisters struck first at the Gulf Coast town of Pass
Christian, Miss., damaging at least 30 homes. They then struck Opp,
Ala., and at least two sections of rural Alabama, the National
Weather Service said.
   Four people were seriously injured in Pike County, northwest of
Opp, when a twister ripped apart three mobile homes.
   The condition of an 86-year-old woman was upgradged from
critical to stable today, and a 64-year-old man also was listed in
stable condition, said Edge administrator Burton Whitaker.
   ``They're improving. I think they're going to be OK,'' he said.
   Two other storm victims originally listed in critical condition,
a 67-year-old man and a 44-year-old woman, were transferred from
Edge to Baptist Medical Center in Montgomery, where a spokeswoman
said they were listed in serious condition today.
   Thursday's storm was accompanied by record high temperatures,
but forecasters said a sharp cold snap would follow.
   In Augusta, Ga., the temperature reached a record 79 degrees
Thursday, but was expected to slide into the 20s by the weekend.
   Cherry Blossom Festival officials in Macon, Ga., worried the
cold would freeze buds on their trees, which were breaking into
bloom early because of the warm weather.
   ``We'll definitely lose some in the freeze,'' Bibb County
Extension Agent Frank Funderburk said.
