   The cold front that unleashed the fury of tornadoes on the
nation's midsection the previous day spread eastward on Wednesday,
bringing up to 10 inches of snow, winds topping 50 mph and
wind-chill readings well below zero.
   Twisters killed six people in Arkansas and one in Missouri late
Tuesday, and injured dozens more in those states and Illinois, Iowa
and Kansas.
   As the violent cold front churned eastward, midday temperatures
in parts of Kansas and Missouri were 30 to 40 degrees lower
Wednesday than they had been the day before, and many areas got the
first real snowfall of the season, the National Weather Service said.
   At least three people were were reported dead in accidents on
snowy roads, and an Illinois woman was electrocuted after lightning
downed a power line in the northern city of Rockford. Cold, wind and
snow led to school closings in several states.
   Ten inches of snow fell at International Falls, Minn., Wednesday
morning, and the National Weather Service said there were hazardous
conditions in much of Minnesota because of snow and blowing snow.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered along the front, which
by midday extended across the Ohio and Tennessee valleys into the
central Gulf Coast. An inch of rain fell in less than two hours at
Fort Wayne, Ind.
   Winds gusted to 50 mph or more in Traverse City and Lansing,
Mich., and in Cleveland. High wind warnings or advisories were
posted in parts of Illinois, Indiana and Ohio.
   In Chicago, city workers scrambled to repair downed traffic
lights, clear fallen trees and open sewers clogged by heavy rains.
   ``We're so busy here, hon, I can't even turn around twice,'' said
Mary Church of the city's Streets and Sanitation Department. ``We
have really been hit hard _ but we're handling it.''
   The blustery winds combined with plunging temperatures to produce
wind-chill readings of zero to 20 below zero in northwestern Iowa,
western Minnesota and eastern North Dakota.
   But the severest weather had taken place farther south on Tuesday.
   ``I can't even tell what street I'm on because the trees are
uprooted,'' said Police Chief Darnell Scott of the central Arkansas
town of Lonoke. ``Damage is so bad. I think we were very lucky it
wasn't more tragic than it was.''
   Two people were killed near Lonoke, roughly 20 miles east of
Little Rock, when a van overturned on Interstate 40. The other
tornado victims in Arkansas were a young couple and their year-old
son whose mobile home was demolished in the nearby town of Scott,
and a man who died when his home was destroyed in Van Buren County,
north of Little Rock.
   An elderly woman died in Butterfield, in southwestern Missouri,
when a tornado threw her trailer home into the air, authorities said.
   ``It may be a little unusual for this time of year to have a
tornado outbreak like this, because they normally occur in spring,''
said meteorologist Brian Smith from the National Weather Service's
Severe Storms Center in Kansas City. But experts have said that
tornadoes have been recorded in every month.
   In Topeka, Kan., a tornado descended without warning, crashing
into Topeka West High School, but the injuries were described as
minor.
   ``Everyone's ears started popping and the teacher told us to get
down,'' said student Jennifer Stanley. ``All the windows started
popping out.''
