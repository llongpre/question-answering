   Violent storms belted the Eastern Seaboard on Thursday, killing
a farmer in Virginia, injuring at least 50 people in the Baltimore
suburbs, whipping through Newark International Airport and raining
on the halls of Congress.
   Strong winds buffeted the Newark airport and the surrounding New
Jersey neighborhood, injuring several people, breaking windows and
damaging cars.
   A tornado in suburban Baltimore damaged homes and buildings,
leaving 50 to 70 people hurt and cutting power to at least 48,000
utility customers, officials said.
   Russell L. Martin, 73, a farmer in King William County, Va.,
which is about 20 miles northeast of Richmond, was feeding his
cattle when he apparently saw a tornado and ran to his barn for
cover, Sheriff W. Wayne Healy said.
   The tornado struck as Martin tried to squeeze into the barn's
crawl space, shattering the old wooden structure and crushing him,
Healy said.
   Reisterstown, Md., residents said a tornado that touched down
there ripped roofs from houses and a supermarket, overturned cars
and downed power and telephone lines.
   Alverta Payne, 80, of Reisterstown said she escaped her home by
crawling through the wreckage of her third floor.
   ``I didn't hear nothing until the roof was on top of me. All of
a sudden, the whole roof caved in,'' she said.
   Baltimore County officials said 14 ambulances were sent to the
area, which was hit hardest by heavy wind and severe thunderstorms
that raced through around sundown.
   Most of the injuries appeared minor. Seven people were taken to
a Baltimore hospital with undetermined injuries.
   Janet Randall with the Baltimore County Fire Department said an
apartment building roof had collapsed and houses lost their roofs
when they blew off.
   In Newark, witnesses reported seeing a funnel cloud near the
airport. The National Weather Service in Newark said it had no
confirmed reports of a tornado in the area.
   Air traffic was not disrupted. The only reported injuries were
five people hurt when winds overturned a storage trailer near a
taxi area, police said.
   At the Vista Hotel across from the airport, a desk clerk said
workers and guests reported seeing a funnel cloud.
   ``There was a tornado,'' said the clerk, who would not give her
name. ``Windows were blown out, a flagpole fell on some cars in the
parking lot, there was concrete all over.''
   Many guests abandoned their rooms and huddled in the hotel lobby
for safety.
   Tornadoes caught the 420 residents of Remington, Va., by
surprise.
   ``All hell broke loose,'' said Annabelle Edwards, owner of A.W.
Edwards Community Store. ``Everything was flying. It almost took me
out the door.''
   No injuries were reported in Remington.
   Witnesses reported seeing a twister at a shopping mall parking
lot in Monroe, N.C. It left cars in a pile and injured four people
inside the vehicles, officials said.
   ``The only thing I can tell you is that a severe thunderstorm or
small tornado hit and did massive damage in a parking lot,'' said
Kathy Phifer, a county fire department dispatcher.
   ``There was no damage to the buildings but many vehicles are
damaged. They're piled on top of each other,'' she said.
   Officials said three people were treated for ``lumps and bumps
from being knocked around inside their cars'' and released. A
fourth person who suffered bruises was admitted for observation.
   In Washington, driving wind and rain leaked into the Capitol
dome and shredded flags on top of the congressional office
buildings. Water poured onto the rotunda floor from balconies
above. Statues were draped with plastic sheets to protect them from
the deluge.
   Strong winds circumvented flashings and drains on the newly
restored dome and into the building, workers said.
   In the Washington suburb of Silver Spring, Md., an emergency
shelter was opened at a Red Cross building. It wasn't immediately
known how many people, if any, used it.
   ``So far we've found only six houses damaged by fallen trees,''
said police Sgt. Harry Geehreng. ``There have been no injuries.
We've been very lucky, but we still have traffic lights out.''
