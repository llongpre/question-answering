   Jeff Jarrett, whose church's pews are
stacked with clothes for tornado victims, was relieved to hear that
federal disaster money was coming to Petersburg.
   ``That's great news,'' Jarrett said after President Bush declared
a federal disaster area Monday in 19 southern Indiana counties hit
by flooding, tornadoes or both.
   The Petersburg Church of Christ was a clearinghouse for clothing,
blankets and batteries Monday night. At least half of the homes were
still without power, and temperatures dipped into the 40s.
   ``I would say right now as far as their financial needs, they're
just beginning to find out,'' Jarrett said. ``Most of them feel
lucky just to be digging out their possessions.''
   The American Red Cross said 384 Petersburg homes were damaged or
destroyed by tornadoes Saturday night. Six people in the area were
killed.
   The disaster designation makes residents eligible for
low-interest loans and other federal assistance.
   In addition, the Red Cross planned to begin distributing vouchers
today for food, clothing, shelter and medical expenses.
   ``Sometimes the problem is convincing people to take the money,''
Red Cross spokesman Steve Small said. ``They're not going on the
dole; it's a gift from the American people to the American people
when they need it.''
   The tornadoes, which killed eight people, hit Petersburg and
Bedford in southern Indiana the hardest. Two more people in Indiana
died Sunday in a second wave of storms that spawned one tornado.
   The weekend storms also were blamed for two deaths in Wisconsin
and one each in Illinois and Missouri. Tornadoes also were reported
in Minnesota, Kentucky and Michigan.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh said at a news conference Monday that the
``magnitude of this disaster is almost impossible to comprehend,''
adding that there was hundreds of millions of dollars of damage.
   ``My message today to the citizens of our state is we have
suffered some severe damage, we mourn our losses, but we're not
ready to give up,'' Bayh said.
   Residents and business owners may be eligible for temporary
housing, up to $10,500 in grants, low-cost loans to cover uninsured
property losses and other programs. State and local governments may
be eligible for money to repair or replace damaged public facilities.
   The American Red Cross estimated that more than 800 homes were
damaged in Indiana, including 240 that were destroyed. In Petersburg
alone, 114 homes were destroyed and 270 sustained damage.
   In Kentucky, 47 homes were damaged and a spokesman for the state
Department of Disaster and Emergency Services said storm destruction
could total as much as $5 million statewide.
   In Ohio, at least 1,600 homes and businesses in three
southwestern counties were damaged.
   All of Petersburg's 3,000 residents were without water Monday.
   About 5,000 homes and business in Petersburg and Bedford, which
also was heavily damaged, were still without electric service
Monday, said Pamela K. Chapman, a spokeswoman for PSI Energy. She
said power would be restored to most areas by today.
   For the third consecutive week, Petersburg residents were urged
to boil all drinking water once service was restored. The city lost
its fresh water supply two weeks ago when floodwater broke the main
water line.
   Meanwhile, Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson got a firsthand view
of some of the storm devastation in his state.
   On Monday, he flew over over two of the 10 counties he had
declared disaster areas and said: ``Since it was declared a state
disaster area, that will make it easier to become a federal disaster
area, and that will make federal money more available.''
