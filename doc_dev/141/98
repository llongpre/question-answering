<HEADLINE>  TORNADO KILLS 2 IN W. VIRGINIA; RARE TWISTER
HITS SEATTLE AREA  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Heavy rains, twisters and high winds were reported in North Carolina, Ohio,
Michigan and Pennsylvania. A rare tornado struck in Washington state.;   
Charles Fahrenz, 41, of Huntington, W.Va., was killed when the barn he was
working in collapsed, and 4-month-old Joseph Roberts of Charleston was killed
when winds knocked his grandparents' trailer down a 20-foot embankment.;   
"There was a big whoosh and everything was blowing," said neighbor Frank
Hopson. "We didn't see the trailer roll over, but we knocked a hole in the
trailer and got to the baby.";    More than 50 people were hospitalized in
Charleston with weather-related injuries, and at least 10 others were hurt at
a track meet in Ripley, W.Va.;    The Seattle area seldom sees a tornado, but
it did Tuesday, preceded by hail as big as baseballs. The twister near
Bremerton felled trees and damaged homes.;    Hank Treich of the National
Weather Service in Seattle said the tornado was the first he knew of in
western Washington since 1970.;    Thunderstorms waylaid 36 injured gulf war
veterans flying in a military transport from Andrews Air Force Base, Md., to
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. They spent the night in a
suburban Pittsburgh Veterans Administration hospital.;    Golfball-sized hail
cracked windshields on a Pittsburgh highway.;    Tornadoes, rain and wind
raked Kentucky at 70 mph. In Simpson County, National Guardsmen were called
out to prevent looting. A tornado in Lawrence County destroyed five homes.;   
John D. Thacker was sitting on his trailer porch in Lower Pompey, Ky., when
the storm hit. "I walked through my front door and that's when the front porch
just lifted up and laid right back on the top of my house," he said.;    Winds
blew the roof off City Hall and the post office in Liberty, Ky. Two toll
booths on the Cumberland Parkway were blown over.;    Michigan's Upper
Peninsula got 10 inches of snow.;    "It's strange because it was 80 degrees
on Saturday," said Bill Mattson, an employee at Arctic Cat Snowmobiles in
Marquette. "Everybody was tanning and cutting their lawns over the weekend. .
. . We'd been selling motorcycles and today a few people stopped in to rent
snowmobiles."  </TEXT>
