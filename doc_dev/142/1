   An American inventor and wildlife
researchers at Kruger National Park say they have achieved a major
breakthrough in conservation _ an immunization system that can stop
epidemics in free-ranging animals.
   The breakthrough is the bio-bullet, a vaccine in a biodegradable
projectile that can be fired by an air rifle from a helicopter. It
has been used for three years to immunize animals ranging from
warthogs to elephants against diseases that have nearly wiped out
species in the park, a 7,800-square-mile reserve.
   Anthrax is endemic in the northern part of the park, an area
where 200 rare roan antelope roam. Before 1970, when the park began
an inoculation program by firing disposable darts at the animals
from the air, severe outbreaks had affected most of the herd animals.
   ``If we have another major outbreak, we have a method now of
controlling the epidemic,'' said Valerius de Vos, head of research
at Kruger. ``I consider this a major breakthrough. ... It will be
used widely in the future.''
   How widely depends to some extent on politics. While South
Africa's wildlife management program is regarded as the best on the
continent, its experts seldom visit other African countries where
similar problems exist. Black African governments restrict contact
with South Africa because of apartheid, its system of racial
separation.
   ``It's a pity,'' de Vos said. ``The rest of Africa needs us and
we need them. We've got expertise and we need interaction.''
   For instance, the numbers of endangered black rhinos are
increasing in South Africa but declining elsewhere. Due to South
African conservation efforts, the white rhino was removed from the
endangered category worldwide.
   Representatives of private wildlife groups sometimes come to
South Africa, and exchanges take place by mail, but many Western
universities won't send copies of research papers to Kruger's
scientists.
   Gus Mills, the chief predator researcher, made a tape recording
of hyena territorial cries and plays it from a jeep at night.
   ``All the hyena in the area come around to listen and we can
count them,'' he said. ``I've sent my tape to Kenya and now Kenyan
hyenas are listening to South African hyenas.''
   De Vos said the air-rifle that fires the bio-bullet can be
locally produced, but not the bullet itself. He worries what
sanctions could disrupt the immunization program.
   There has been talk of banning shipments of four-wheel drive
vehicles to South Africa from Japan, because they have military
potential.
   ``That's going to affect us,'' de Vos said. ``I don't know what
we're going to do, but I guess we can keep going with two-wheel
drive vehicles.''
   In 1973 de Vos and his team began inoculating large mammals by
firing dart-syringes from the air. Disadvantages included large
numbers of plastic darts left on the ground, and the time and cost
of manufacturing the syringes.
   De Vos found Fred Paul, an inventor from White Bear Lake, Minn.,
who had developed the bio-bullet and used it to vaccinate domestic
livestock and wild bighorn sheep. Paul came to Kruger Park to assist
the research, which includingfiring different-sized bullets at
varying velocities until the right size and shape were determined.
   The bullet can be fired rapidly, allowing marksmen to inoculate
about 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy. The material, a
cellulose polymer, dissolves inside the animal, releasing the
vaccine.
   Vaccinating 1,500 animals a day with 80 percent accuracy is
``impressive, to say the least. ... That's a lot of animals,'' said
Maurice LeFranc, director of the Institute for Wildlife Research, a
branch of National Wildlife Federation in the United States.
   The South African park lends itself to such an effort because it
has wide open spaces and concentrations of animals, LeFranc said in
Vienna, Va.
   The project illustrates the place that South African wildlife
researchers have in the forefront of species preservation and the
National Park Board's philosophy about when to let nature take its
course and when man should intervene.
   ``South Africa has taken a real strong leadership in the
preservation and conservation of their wildlife,'' said Dr. Werner
Heuschele, an endangered species specialist at the San Diego Zoo in
California. ``Some of their game parks are among the best managed in
the world.''
   One researcher at Kruger is capturing impala to find a cure for a
human-caused stress disease that occurs when antelope are chased for
long distances and caught in a net. In the wild, predators chase
impalas only for short distances.
   The main form of research at Kruger is surveillance _ taking
aerial photos of vegetation, counting animals, taking blood levels
of elephants to see if car exhaust affects them. The data is fed
into computers to help determine what projects are needed in the
park, a fenced area the size of Massachusetts.
   Roads affect the natural spread of fire, so controlled fires are
set deliberately. Fenced animals cannot migrate during drought, so
dams are built.
   In the early 1970s, wildebeest rapidly diminished. A new fence
around the park had cut off one herd's traditional migration route,
and heavy rainfall encouraged long grass, rather than the short
grass the wildebeest like.
   Managers could have set fires to eliminate the tall grass.
Instead, they decided to kill off lions and hyenas who preyed on the
wildebeest.
   To prevent the need for such action in the future, Mills and his
team spend two weeks at a time following lions, cheetah and
leopards, to monitor their eating habits.
   ``Are they depressing the prey in large numbers or living in
harmony with their environment?'' Mills says researchers want to
know.
   Although anthrax and foot-and-mouth disease are natural African
diseases, they are controlled because it would take 20 to 30 years
for the herds to recover after an endemic.
   ``Drastic fluctuations in animal populations are part of nature,
but we can't afford that,'' said de Vos.
   ``We cull (shoot) buffalo and elephant, and sometimes hippo.
These are species that can outgrow the system. The rest of the
animals are controlled by the system. Drought, predation, disease
all act as controls. For the buffalo and elephant the main predator
in the past was man. We have taken man out of it, so now we're
bringing man back in, in a controlled way.''
