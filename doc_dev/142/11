There is an old movie adage that when all else fails - or when all else has
succeeded but you need a fresh gimmick - you should send your characters
into the desert.
There you will find eye-catching scenery, limitless horizons and a licence
to conjure mirages. Many people at Cannes this year thought The Adventures
Of Priscilla, Queen Of The Desert was a mirage. A comedy of cross-dressing
from macho Australia? And a funny one?
It fast became the hit of the festival. It revives Terence Stamp's career at
a stroke - he plays one of three drag queens whose hired bus breaks down in
the Outback, causing many an unexpected encounter and adventure - and
provides the wittiest, most off-the-wall gay movie since La Cage Aux Folles.
Priscilla opens this Friday. Disney's The Lion King opened last Friday and
is already swallowing large audiences whole. This desert is African and the
most spectacular cartoon landscape of modern times. Thrill to the stampeding
wildebeest. Gasp at the burning plains patrolled by lions and hyenas. And
relish Jeremy Irons' suave turn as the wicked lion uncle, obviously reared
on old George Sanders films when he was a cub.
Zhang Yimou's To Live, from the director of Red Sorghum and Ju Dou, is
another of China's revisionist epics about Chinese history: 30 years in the
war-ravaged, Mao-harrassed
life of a puppeteer and his
wife. But Zhang's vision is fiercer and harsher than Chen Kaige's
in the recent Farewell My Concubine, and the battle confrontations in the
desert are unforgettable.
Finally, wrap up your desert research with Walter Hill's Geronimo, filmed in
scenic Utah, a few leagues north of the Indian chief's real stomping grounds
in Arizona/New Mexico. In other respects the movie, opening this week,
claims exhaustive historical authenticity and has Gene Hackman and Robert
Duvall in the supporting cast.
