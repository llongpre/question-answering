   War and famine have turned Sudan, Africa's
largest nation, into a vast morgue. Besides the dead there are the
uprooted, seeking food where there is none. Here is a report on the
situation.

   Hyenas crept into the town at night,
dragged away emaciated corpses and devoured them in the bush. The
starving residents who remained alive were too weak to bury the
dead.
   About 3,000 people have died of starvation since July at the
town called Abyei in southwestern Sudan, an area of despair
afflicted by civil war and famine.
   Abyei's dead are among at least 250,000 people who foreign
relief officials say have died this year of starvation or
inadequate medical care. Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi claims the
estimate is 20 times the actual figure.
   Abyei was unknown to the world until the United States announced
a $1 million program this month to fly 90 tons of grain over a
10-day period to the town 500 miles southwest of Khartoum.
   Drought and five years of civil war have made famine endemic to
three Sudanese provinces south of Abyei.
   U.S. officials decided on the relief program because of reports
of mass starvation in the town, which had been overrun by thousands
driven from their homes by the war.
   The U.N. Children's Fund joined in with special high-protein
food for children. UNICEF officials say the relief programs saved
5,000 children from certain death.
   Videotape brought from the town last week showed children with
heads too large for their shrunken bodies. Many had the sunken eyes
and dull orange hair of extreme malnutrition.
   Cole Dodge, a UNICEF representative, told reporters after
returning from Abyei: ``Even an intensive care unit in New York
would find it hard to save these kids, some are so far gone.''
   Western and Sudanese relief officials said 2 million southerners
have been turned into refugees by fighting between government
soldiers and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. They say
about 1.3 million of those were forced from their homes this year.
   Some set out on foot for northern Sudan, others for Ethiopia to
the east. Many died on the way. Those who made it to other parts of
Sudan found little food.
   Relief workers who flew to Abyei with the airlift gave this
description:
   Grass and shrubs cover the narrow airstrip because of the
heaviest summer rains since 1946, which turned Abyei into a virtual
island and trapped 30,000-40,000 people with only enough food for
15,000.
   Most were old men, women and children because strong men were
fighting in the civil war.
   Refugees arrived in Abyei with accounts of trudging through
swampland for weeks, eating leaves and being attacked by rebel
bands who took what little food and clothing the victims had.
   Some Western relief workers say the rebels are trying to make
people move north, creating problems for the government in
Khartoum. The rebels seek greater autonomy from the
Moslem-dominated north for southern Sudan, most of whose people are
Christian or animist.
   The first U.S.-chartered planes arrived Oct. 13 in Abyei, which
consists of 12-15 permanent structures and thousands of huts built
of sticks and grass.
   Feeble-looking men came to the twin-engine Cessna in ragged
shorts and tattered remnants of flowing robes.
   Relief officials say the 90 tons of supplies and the UNICEF food
for children should last until the rainy season ends in about two
weeks and trucks can reach Abyei again. But they fear about 50,000
more refugees also may arrive then.
   Families get weekly allotments of grain. The Red Crescent, the
Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross, handles distribution.
   Videotapes from Abyei show children aged 4-10 crowding the
UNICEF feeding quarters with bowls to receive a porridge-like food
called Unimix from huge containers.
   The children are fed three times a day. They sit in the dusty,
walled-in yard under shades of grass and bamboo, some smiling and
chatting, others slowly eating from wooden or plastic bowls,
scraping up every remaining bit with their fingers.
   UNICEF officials believe many children died on the way to Abyei
or before the food came. They said the number of adults at Abyei
should have many more children than the 5,000 in the town.
   ``People are just completely emaciated. It was a situation of
absolute destitution,'' Dodge said.
   UNICEF officials say the summer estimate of 80 deaths a day in
Abyei was reduced to 10 daily this month. They say the rate appears
even lower in the latter part of October.
   No clear picture is available of the situation in the war-torn
regions of Bahr el-Ghazal, Equatoria and Upper Nile.
   Relief officials and reporters cannot get into many parts of the
war zone, where the rebels control about 90 percent of the
countryside.
