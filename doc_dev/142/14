   Foster father Viv Wilson is fond of
his orphans even if they do growl and grunt, snarl and snap, hiss
and hoot.
   One even bit off a finger.
   The 58-year-old former game ranger's charges are lions, hyenas,
baboons, crocodiles, snakes and hundreds of birds common to the
African bush.
   ``It's not a zoo, and it's not for financial gain,'' said
Wilson, a native South African who set up the home in 1973.
   ``It's simply a private sanctuary for orphaned, abandoned,
confiscated or injured wild animals that, reared in captivity,
can't safely be returned to the wilds.''
   Chipangali Wildlife Orphanage realizes a dream Wilson had
nurtured since working as a game ranger for the British colonial
government in Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia.
   The body of a newborn kudu calf, clubbed to death by a native
hunter who also shot its mother, begot Wilson's ambition.
   He and the hunter met in the brush-studded Chipangali region of
eastern Zambia, heavily infested by trypanosomiasis - a disease
borne by tsetse files that can be fatal to man and beast.
   Wilson recalled asking the hunter why he killed the calf. The
hunter replied he was only doing his job, killing animals of some
species as part of the government's anti-tsetse fly operation.
   ``I knew he was right,'' said Wilson. ``But I also thought
something was awfully wrong.''
   When Zambia achieved independence in 1964, Wilson moved to
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, where he was offered a good job in its game
department.
   Nine years later, Wilson founded Chipangali, 15 mies south of
Zimbabwe's second city of Bulawayo, with savings and sponsorships.
   For Wilson, his wife Paddy and their two sons, home was a small
thatched roof house and work was tending a few animals in a cluster
of pens.
   This was the beginning of the seven-year war waged by guerrillas
against white supremacy. It ended in 1980 with independence under
President Robert Mugabe.
   ``We weren't touched by the war, and if guerrillas were roaming
around here, I never saw them,'' said Wilson. ``But we did get
quite a few soldiers popping in to drop off pets, mainly monkeys,
they'd tired of.''
   People continue to deliver animals to Wilson's care. Today,
Chipangali is a honeycomb of more than 70 large enclosures and
aviaries for ``The Orphans of the Wild,'' the title of a book by
Wilson published in 1977.
   A labyrinth of pebbled paths bordered by gardens of native
trees, plants and cactuses lead visitors to Wilson's waifs.
   ``We've strived to make the setting as naturally African as we
can, both for the animals and for people who come to see them,''
Wilson said.
   His family still lives beneath the thatch-roofed house flanked
by enclosures for lions, leopards and monkeys.
   About 20,000 people stroll around Chipangali's 10 acres each
year, a third of them schoolchildren who are allowed to visit free
of charge. Adults pay the equivalent of $2.
   ``We encourage the kids,'' said Wilson, who serves as manager
for a trust fund set up to bankroll the orphanage. ``Africans
brought up in the rural areas fully understand wildlife because
it's all around them. ... But millions of Africans born in cities
and towns have never seen a lion, a leopard or a snake.''
   Urban children, he said, ``have lost contact with nature. Here,
we take them back to the wild.''
   The $10,000 needed monthly for Chipangali's upkeep comes from
gate receipts, sales of a wildlife calendar, the orphanage's
restaurant and fund-raising events such as horseracing.
   Scores of sponsors, many of them foreigners, adopt animals and
send checks as foster parents.
   ``We still battle,'' said Wilson, who launched Chipangali on
$400 a month. ``We can never close, so we must cut our cloth to
suit our income.''
   Wilson, who as a game ranger survived charges by rhinoceros and
bites from poisonous snakes, has had few problems from his
creatures.
   A lion chomped off one of his fingers, a visiting schoolboy was
slightly injured by a leopard and some of his 40 employees have
been bitten by monkeys.
   Besides running the orphanage, Wilson has authored three
wildlife books, helped produce a 25-episode program for television
and written some 60 research papers on African snakes, animals and
birds.
   He was commissioned by the Geneva-based International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources to study ways to
prevent the extinction of the jentink's duiker antelope of Liberia,
and won the 1987 Rolex Spirit of Enterprise award for his work
there.
   In June, he was among 500 people worldwide honored by the United
Nations for environmental achievements.
   Wilson left Liberia in March just before the outbreak of civil
war. He fears the few surviving duiker were destroyed in the
conflict.
   ``That's my next concern,' ' he said. ``As soon as things are
settled down I'll go back to see for myself.''
