<LEADPARA>  EVERY evening, just before dusk, the elephants come down to drink in the Ngamo
Flats. Groups of a dozen or more lumber across the sand toward the "pans" that
turn to mud in the southern African dry season. They siphon water with their
great trunks, trumpeting angrily whenever the occasional train roars past on
Hwange's border.;    Chris Van Wyk, a strapping Afrikaner, likes to think of
the ritual as his own private elephant show. "I've been running safaris here
for three years," he said, rolling his R's in classic Boer style. "And I don't
think I've missed a single performance."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Tonight, as we emerged from the acacia forest in Van Wyk's Toyota Land
Rover, he gestured sharply to his right: A herd of 50 elephants rumbled away
in fright, kicking up clouds of white Kalahari desert sand. But one old bull
lingered in a water hole 50 yards from us, oblivious to our intrusion. Van Wyk
descended from the vehicle, scattered sand, then, satisfied that we were
downwind of the keen-smelling, nearsighted beast, silently motioned me forward
until we were just a few long strides away.;    Suddenly, he froze -- we'd
moved a little too close. The bull had emerged from the pan and was plodding
straight at us, raising his mud-covered tusks. Van Wyk began running backward,
slapping a cartridge into his Winchester and locking the bolt. Distracted or
confused, the elephant turned away.;    Hwange National Park sits on the high
semidesert plains in the northwest corner of Zimbabwe, formerly called
Rhodesia after British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. This arid "safari belt" was
once the country's war zone. My visit during the African winter last August
came 10 years after black Patriotic Front guerrillas, led by Joshua Nkomo and
Robert Mugabe, triumphed in their struggle to topple the white-minority regime
and created the new nation of Zimbabwe.;    The Rhodesian war, which lasted
from 1972 to 1980, killed more than 15,000 people in sporadic bush clashes and
raids on army bases and white homesteads. Within a few months of independence,
150,000 of Rhodesia's white population of 250,000 had fled, many resettling in
South Africa. There they could continue the life of privilege that had
disappeared from the rest of the continent.;    Today a traveler in Zimbabwe
has the sense of a nation finally at peace. Some of the 100,000 white
"Rhodies" who remain are prospering like Van Wyk, by running safaris in the
very bush where they spent the civil war. Blacks, who comprise 99 percent of
the 9.5 million people and who were held back under the white-minority regime,
now dominate the civil service in Zimbabwe's cities and, in the bush, are
making slow inroads in the tourist business.;    The apartheid that blights
South Africa has become an odious memory here -- although many Rhodies' sense
of racial superiority has hardly dimmed with black independence.;    Zimbabwe
does resemble South Africa in one respect -- its efforts to protect its
resources. The 14,000-square-mile Hwange has 18,000 elephants, among the
greatest herds in Africa, and the Zambezi Valley is the last sanctuary of the
endangered black rhino. Because of the Civil War, tourism has been slow to
develop in Zimbabwe, and concessions that dole out huge chunks of wilderness
to a single safari operator, like Van Wyk, aren't unusual. That has kept
Zimbabwe from becoming marred by the crowds and the commercialization of
Kenya, which most Americans think of when they consider an African safari.;   
Indeed, Zimbabwe, along with neighboring Botswana, has a reputation among
wildlife connoisseurs for the most unspoiled game viewing on the continent.
Zimbabwe also has one of Africa's better developed infrastructures, from the
capital Harare to the tiny settlement of Kariba, gateway to the Zambezi
Valley. One of Africa's more prosperous countries (although plagued by
drought, unemployment and AIDS), for many Americans it remains a hazy place, a
Third World "hot spot" that still evokes images of land mines and AK-47-toting
guerrillas. During my two-week journey, I saw groups of British and South
African tourists -- but not a single American.;    My travels through Zimbabwe
took me to several other places that echo Hwange's magnificent isolation and
bountiful wildlife. Along the Zambezi River, I paddled through gorges and
Everglades-like shallows, slept on sand banks and, except for my canoeing
group, didn't encounter another human for days. At Matusadona National Park on
the shores of Lake Kariba, I stayed in a houseboat moored in a shallow bay
amid thousands of drowned trees -- and tracked lions in a hardscrabble land of
mopani trees, red-clay termite mounds and towering ilala-nut palms.;    Alone
at the falls;    Even Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe's prime tourist attraction,
feels virtually undiscovered. In the early morning, I reached the
300-foot-high falls via a dirt path through the rain forest. I paid one
Zimbabwean dollar (40 cents) to a sleepy clerk, and then walked along a muddy
precipice in solitude before the misting, mile-wide cascade.;    But nowhere
is Zimbabwe's wildness, openness and isolation better experienced than at a
camp such as Van Wyk's, a handful of tents down a gravel track in the
southeast corner of Hwange Park.;    A half-dozen luxury tents -- each
equipped with a cot, kerosene stove, night table and folding chair -- were
pitched beneath leadwood and ebony trees, lush green canopies that offered
protection from Hwange's easterly winds. Van Wyk and his Ndebele workers were
moving the camp from one clearing to another 500 yards away, digging latrines,
laying pipe from a well and erecting thatched canopies to shelter the tents. I
was his only guest during the transition period.;    Van Wyk spent three days
driving me in his Land Rover through the acacia forests, sand flats, palm
groves and open savannah of Hwange. Frequently we descended from the vehicle
and tracked the reserve's bountiful game -- giraffe, wildebeest, mongoose,
sable, zebra, ostrich, elephant, white rhino, bush buck -- on foot. We saw no
other tourists, no other vehicles.;    Each evening we returned to camp,
where, under a huge tarp, servants and cooks from the local Ndebele tribe
prepared four-course dinners by kerosene lamp in wood-burning stoves. Herds of
wildebeest -- prehistoric-looking bison with dust-mop bodies, spindly legs and
small brains -- gathered just a few yards from the tent camp. As we ate, the
night echoed with the unearthly shouts of hyenas, jackals and baboons. "Where
the tall grass ends and the short grass begins," said Van Wyk, pointing to the
spectral figures, "that's the end of human territory.";    Talk often shifted
from the animals to human concerns. Chain-smoking Berkeley cigarettes and
sipping a rum and Coke as we sat around a campfire, Van Wyk liked to discuss
his life as a "Rhodie" bushman in the Zimbabwe of President Mugabe. Actually,
he said, he'd considered emigrating to his native South Africa when the new
government came to power. "I didn't have faith in the blacks running the
country," he admitted.;    For now Van Wyk can pretend that his little corner
of Africa hasn't changed. He still sees himself as the benevolent baas,
looking after his black employees.;    But sometimes his attitude betrayed its
South African roots. He talked about his staff's "limitations," and once, as
we watched an elephant raise a leg and scratch beneath it with its trunk, he
commented: "That's just the way the blacks do it." Van Wyk laughed heartily,
while I, not wanting to antagonize my host, managed only a grimace at his
bigotry.;    If Van Wyk represents the old Rhodesian way of life and thought,
Jeremiah Gaza symbolizes the new Zimbabwe. I met the 28-year-old Shona
tribesman on the Zambezi River, the border between Zimbabwe and Zambia, and
the fourth-longest river on the continent.;    Gaza loved the river. He had
grown up in Kariba and landed a job as a driver for a safari company nine
years ago, towing canoes from Kariba over the Zambezi Escarpment to Mana Pools
75 miles away. In 1989 he became one of the first blacks to be admitted into
an apprentice program for river guides -- a sign of changing attitudes among
the white-owned companies that dominate Zimbabwe's tourist trade.;    Illegal
rhino hunting;    Gaza became impassioned about the illegal rhino hunting that
flourishes here. Zambian poachers carrying AK-47s sneak across by night in
pursuit of the endangered black rhino, several thousand of which live in Mana
Pools park. The horn sells for $50,000 a kilogram on the black market. To
combat the poaching, well-trained squadrons of Zimbabwean rangers patrol the
bush and the river. Since 1984, 125 poachers have been shot to death and 55
captured, while three rangers and 675 rhino have been killed. "I can say the
Zambians are very poor," Gaza said. "They have ruined their country -- and now
they want to ruin Zimbabwe.";    A handsome man wearing an olive-green safari
hat, T-shirt, shorts and sandals, Gaza led us through the bayou-like shallows,
so different from the chasms of white water that characterize the Zambezi
further upstream, near Victoria Falls. The fierce African sun rose over the
empty green hills of Zambia as animals came down to the river to drink.;   
Elephants waded deliberately across the river -- gentlemanly beasts who paid
no attention as we watched them while sticking our paddles in the muck to stop
our drift downstream. The banks teemed with baboons, crocodiles, waterbuck,
Cape buffalo, black samango monkeys, buffalo and exotic birds ranging from
fish eagles to Goliath herons to lilac-breasted rollers.;    But the dominant
animal on the Zambezi is the hippo. "I can say . . . there may be 1,500 hippo
between Mana Pools and Kanyemba," said Gaza. He was constantly offering
tidbits about the river, prefacing every fact with the expression, "I can
say.";    By the third day on the Zambezi, the current quickened as it passed
through the Mupata Gorge, a dramatic landscape of velvety hills rising right
above the river. Thick clumps of weeds twisted around our paddles as the
current carried us swiftly downstream. Gaza gestured to the Zambian riverbank.
"Look, look!" he cried. It was a cheetah, moving silently through the low
grass. "He must be hunting for baboon," he said.;    One afternoon, he noticed
what appeared to be a bulky gray boulder lying on the bank and led us toward
it. As the boats scraped the river bottom and stopped against the beach, the
"boulder" suddenly quivered and rose haltingly to its feet. A 2,000-pound
hippo bull snorted menacingly. Then, instead of charging, it stood shivering.
The beast turned away from the canoe and plodded into the river, disappearing
beneath the brown-green surface.;    "He is sick," Gaza said. "He shakes and
his eyes are red, just like the last time I had malaria. I can say that he
will die very soon. Much death along the river.";    Some last words;  I
thought about his words days later, as I returned to Kariba from three days of
isolation on a houseboat moored on the lake shore. A Rhodie from Gaza's
company, Buffalo Safaris, met me with shocking news: Gaza had died in a Land
Rover accident a mile from the airstrip at Kanyemba where I'd last seen him.
He had been driving too fast on a rough dirt road, swerved to avoid a National
Parks truck and flipped the vehicle, killing himself instantly and injuring a
co-worker.;    It was hard to accept. He was a man who'd seemed to have found
his place in Zimbabwe, thriving in a land that, only 10 years ago, had been a
killing zone.;    Yet Jeremiah Gaza's sudden death seemed symbolic of both
Zimbabwe and other parts of Africa: racing toward the future, charged with
ambition, borne back by its own poverty, recklessness and fragility. In
Zimbabwe, the land's splendors are never far removed from their dangers.  </TEXT>
