   Clad in traditional Arabian robes
and headdress, Dr. Lawrence Curtis sits in his study, surrounded by
the things he loves _ an extensive zoological library, three snakes
and a scorpion that paces in a small box.
   Every so often, a curious ostrich peers through the window.
   Home for Curtis is Riyadh's zoo.
   The 58-year-old Texan was hired specially to establish a zoo in
this oil-rich nation and sometime in the future, he said, ``Saudi
Arabia may be breeding more endangered species than many advanced
countries.''
   Curtis spent 15 years as a zoo director in Fort Worth, Texas,
and another 15 in Oklahoma City.
   ``I was bored with conventional zoos,'' he said, and 18 months
ago heard that Riyadh was planning to open a zoo and needed a
director. He packed enough clothes for two weeks and headed for the
Saudi capital.
   He was hired on the spot and given just four months to prepare
for the zoo's opening in March 1987.
   Today, the Riyadh zoo is home to 1,200 animals, many of them
endangered species. It is also an oasis, carpeted in lush grass and
filled with flower beds, bubbling man-made streams, small trees,
and flowering vines thriving in the highly irrigated desert soil.
   Nearly 7,000 visitors a day pass through its gates _ men on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and veiled women on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Sundays, in accordance with Saudi Arabia's Islamic
tradition of separating the sexes.
   To Riyadh's residents, the zoo is a welcome change of scenery.
To Curtis, the zoo is much more.
   ``I really wanted our zoo to have an international reputation
for conservation,'' he said.
   One of his first tasks was to help persuade the municipality to
issue a policy statement supporting the Convention of International
Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), a treaty designed to protect
wild animals in their native countries.
   Saudi Arabia supports the treaty although it has yet to sign it
_ a point Curtis thinks will change soon _ but the expression of
support made it easy for him to get colleagues all over the world
to help stock the zoo.
   In keeping with CITES guidelines, no endangered species were
collected from the wild.
   An Arabian leopard and an ibex were shipped from Cincinnati's
zoo. Pigmy hippos came from the Bronx Zoo in New York City. Boston
sent antelopes. Miami, Cleveland and Duke University sent lemurs.
San Diego contributed a scimiter horned oryx, and a golden lion
marmoset came from Washington, D.C.
   The zoo in Cairo, Egypt, sent giant tortoises, the Singapore zoo
a crocodile, the Sydney zoo in Australia a kangaroo and two tapirs
arrived from the zoo in Lima, Peru.
   Bedouins, the nomads who live in Saudi Arabia's desert, brought
in lizards, a caracal and a hyena in the back of pick-up trucks.
And so it went, until the zoo's eclectic collection rivaled those
of its more established counterparts.
   ``We've got an Indian mynah who speaks Arabic, and a parrot who
speaks Swahili,'' said Curtis. ``He's next to a macaw from Brazil
and you know what they speak there (Portuguese). We really have a
multilingual zoo; it's like the United Nations.''
   Getting the animals to Riyadh was only half the chore.
   ``The big challenge was acclimatization,'' Curtis said. ``We had
to make a lot of modifications.'' Upon his arrival, he was given a
list of animals approved for acquisition but he rejected some as
inappropriate.
   A wild horse was scratched for want of adequate running space,
and several poisonous snakes were eliminated due to lack of staff
expertise in handling them. Many animals need special care in order
to thrive in Riyadh's desert climate.
   ``The key to acclimatization is spraying and misting systems, so
we installed a lot of that,'' Curtis said. The zoo also invested in
shade cloth, which cuts out 80 percent of sunlight in the summer
months, when temperatures often reach 122 degrees.
   Reptiles accustomed to high humidity are sprayed with water.
   Like his charges, Curtis seems to have adapted to his new
environment. He wears the local robes and headdress, known as a
thobe and ghutra.
   He takes frequent desert trips to study and photograph Saudi
Arabia's native fauna.
   ``This country has made remarkable progress. It has a big
commitment to conservation,'' Curtis said. ``They've already
created national parks, there's an endangered species list, and
we've got endangered species legislation coming up.''
