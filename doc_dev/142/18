   A British tourist whose charred bones were
found in a game park was murdered, a court ruled Friday,
vindicating her father's yearlong battle against state
investigators who claimed wild animals had killed her.
   The death of Julie Ward remains unsolved, however, with no one
arrested and the judge saying he saw no need for further
investigation. Ms. Ward's father has charged there was an official
cover-up to protect Kenya's lucrative tourism industry.
   Ms. Ward's partly charred lower left leg and lower jaw were
found on Sept. 13, 1988, in the sprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve,
a week after she reportedly left the world-renowned park while on a
wildlife photography expedition.
   The state claimed the 28-year-old woman was eaten by carnivores
after abandoning her vehicle mired in mud. The Masai Mara is home
to lions, vultures, hyenas and leopards among other meat eaters.
   Her father, John Ward, a hotelier from Suffolk, England,
contended she was murdered, hacked up and burned with gasoline. He
pleaded with the state to order an inquest and spent tens of
thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours in a private
investigation of her death.
   ``There is ample and substantial evidence that Julie Ward died
of foul play by a person or persons unknown,'' Chief Magistrate
Joseph Mango said at the conclusion of his inquiry, which began in
mid-August and heard 38 witnesses before ending Oct. 6.
   In rejecting the state's contention that Ms. Ward had been
killed by animals, Mango said: ``I think the animals are innocent.
If they are guilty at all, it is in eating what they found.''
   However, he said he ``saw no reason'' to investigate her death
further and rejected claims by her family that the state had
engaged in a cover-up to protect her killer or Kenya's $360 million
annual tourist trade.
   ``There has been a strong attack on the quality of the
investigations ... and allegations of a cover-up,'' Mango said.
``Of course the state does not admit this.''
   He further denied that Simon Makallah, the Masai Mara's chief
game warden, is or was a principal suspect in Ms. Ward's murder.
   During the inquest, Ward's attorney, Byron Georgiadis, had tried
to build a case that Ms. Ward was killed by someone who knew the
game park well, had freedom of movement there and could have
ordered or inspired a cover-up of the circumstances surrounding her
disappeareance.
   He pointed to Makallah as a chief suspect, contending the game
warden was able to find the young woman's remains hours after her
vehicle was located six miles away, only because he already knew
where they were.
   Mango, however, said there had been no evidence to suggest
Makallah and Ms. Ward ever met before her death and the fact that
he found her remains ``does not cast suspicion on Makallah.''
   Instead, he said investigators should have considered as prime
suspects two men Ms. Ward spent time with in the game park, neither
of whom appeared as witnesses at the inquest.
   After the ruling, Ward said he was surprised at the outcome and
that he had had ``very serious doubts'' Mango would rule in his
favor. He called the ruling a ``credit'' to Kenya.
   ``At the end of the day, he came up with the verdict that was
required,'' Ward said.
   But asked if he was pleased with the ruling, he said: ``How can
you be pleased to have it confirmed that your daughter has been
murdered? But, yes, I suppose I am pleased.''
   Ward repeated his belief there had been a cover-up and referred
to a British pathologist's report accepted by Mango as accurate
that proved his daughter had been hacked to pieces by a sharp
instrument and not torn apart by animals.
   A state pathologist's report said her remains had been cleanly
cut, but was later altered by a superior to say they had been
cracked and torn _ injuries more indicative of an animal's mauling.
   The British report was presented to Kenya's police commissioner
``months ago and he chose to ignore it,'' Ward said.
   Police have admitted several blunders in the case, including
failing to interview people in the area. In addition, a park gate
keeper admitted forging Ms. Ward's signature on a visitor's book to
show she had left the preserve.
   ``I'm not retracting anything about a cover-up,'' Ward said. He
added that he hoped police would work to solve the murder, despite
Mango's belief that the case did not require further investigation.
   ``This is a solvable crime,'' he said. ``Hopefully, the police
will do this now.''
