   Conservation officials on Saturday announced
a renewed drive to save from extinction one of the world's rarest
mammals, the Arabian Tahr mountain goat.
   The campaign will combine a new captive breeding program and
continued efforts to protect the animals in the wild, said Ralph
Daly, conservation adviser to Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos.
   The remaining Arabian Tahr are found in the sultanate's northern
Hajar mountain range and in mountains in the neighboring United
Arab Emirates. There are believed to be between 1,000 and 2,000 of
the goats left.
   The government established the Wadi Sarin Nature Reserve to
protect the goats after hunting them was banned in 1975. Mountain
tribesmen known as mushrafyn, or guardians, monitor the movements
of the goats in their remote reserve on 6,500-foot Jebel Aswad, or
Black Mountain.
   Daly said a breeding program for scientific study of around 14
Tahr is already under way at a captive breeding center. It will be
supplemented by a second breeding program ``to ensure we have
animals of different lines,'' he said.
   ``We believe it is vital to broaden the genetic base of the only
Tahr population left in the world,'' said Daly.
   The goats are related to the chamois and musk ox, and their
preferred habitat is steep, north-facing mountains. The Hajar range
runs in a crescent from the Strait of Hormuz in the north to the
edge of the Wahiba Sands in the southeast.
   The majority of the research work carried out for the government
has been led by Muscat-based British wildlife biologist Dr. Paul
Munton. He described the Arabian Tahr as ``not a well-adapted
desert dweller but a relic of a more temperature fauna.''
   The species, he said, is ``hanging on to life in the coolest and
most sheltered parts of the most difficult mountains of Arabia.''
   The goats eat fruit, seeds and grasses. They are hunted in the
wild by leopards, hyenas and wolves, and their young are prey to
eagles, ravens and red foxes.
