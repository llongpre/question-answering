   Rustlers armed with machetes and rifles
raided nomad camps at dawn and killed 192 people and injured 50 in
a remote part of northwestern Kenya, the government said Sunday.
   The rustlers stole about 3,500 cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys,
officials said. Forty of the 50 rustlers were captured and killed
and about 3,000 animals were recovered.
   The sky over the massacre scene was black with vultures. Hyenas
and other wild animals ravaged the bodies of the victims, said the
Sunday Nation, an independent newspaper.
   Laban Kitele, a minister of state in the office of the
president, said police tracked and killed about 40 of the 50
rustlers in a search aided by recent heavy rains in the district.
The rest escaped across the border to Sudan.
   Kitele said in a statement that the attackers were a well-armed
``terror gang'' of Sudanese from the Toposas tribe and Ndongiros
from Ethiopia.
   The attackers hit 30 nomadic camps about 30 miles west of the
border town of Lokichoggio on Wednesday. The semi-arid district,
whose mountains and rugged valleys make it inaccessible by car, is
near the borders of Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda.
   Police recovered 3,000 of about 3,500 animals stolen by the
rustlers, Kitele said.
   On March 30, rustlers hacked 15 nomads to death in northern
Kenya and stole 2,000 goats.
   ``Rustlers have lost all respect for human life to the extent
that they will massacre human beings in cold blood,'' Kitele said.
``I wish to warn anybody within Kenya or outside still harboring
ideas of rustling to desist. ... Government response to rustling
will always be prompt and aggressive hot pursuit.''
   In the latest incident, rustlers struck at 6 a.m. and killed
men, women and children with crude machetes and automatic and
semi-automatic rifles, Mohamed Yusuf Haji, the Rift Valley
provincial commissioner, told the Sunday Nation. The newspaper had
chartered a plane to the area.
   Haji said he found only bones and skulls left by scavenging
animals when he visited the scene.
   Rustling is a tradition among East Africa's nomadic tribes, who
regularly cross borders in search of pasture for their animals.
