   Scientists at Kruger
National Park are recruiting tourists to help them track, count and
conserve the African wild dog, the most endangered large carnivore
on the continent.
   The big-eared dogs have intricately patterned coats, each one
distinct enough so individual animals can be identified from
photographs. Once scientists know how many wild dogs there are and
how they move, they will begin drawing up conservation plans.
   South Africa's National Parks Board and the private Endangered
Wildlife Trust have started a contest to get tourists to take
pictures of the animals and send the prints in with information on
location, pack size and number of young.
   About 1,000 photographs have been entered in the contest, which
began in January and runs through July.
   The first prize is a free trip to a South African national park
and the runner-up prizes are photo equipment.
   ``We could drive through the park for a month and never see one
wild dog, but probably every day someone somewhere in the park sees
them. They stay close to the road and they are not scared of
vehicles,'' said Gus Mills, head of predator research at the park.
   He said he believes there are about 300 in the park, the biggest
group in Africa. Others are in Botswana, Zimbabwe, Zambia and parts
of East Africa.
   ``They move long distances and seem sometimes to go out of the
park. When that happens, they get into trouble,'' said Mills.
   Since wild dog packs hunt by day and don't fear humans, they are
easy targets for farmers protecting their livestock. Mills said a
farmer whose land borders the park recently shot 20 dogs.
   ``People have an exaggerated hatred for wild dogs; it's somewhat
like the way the wolf is regarded in America,'' Mills said.
   Wild dogs travel in packs of up to 25 and need to kill three or
four impala to feed their members.
   Only one female and male in each pack breed, with the female
producing 10 to 15 pups and all members helping to raise the litter.
