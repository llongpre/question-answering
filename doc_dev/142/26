   Time after time, the big jackrabbit avoids
attacks by the five Harris hawks that dive and feint with the
precision of a military unit. But finally, the rabbit is exhausted
and a powerful talon slashes quickly. The hunt ends and winged
predators feed together.
   In a report to be published Friday in Science magazine,
biologist James C. Bednarz said he repeatedly witnessed such
coordinated hunting by Harris hawks. It is, he said, the first
documented proof that hawks are able to organize and cooperate with
almost human skill in such a complex series of manuevers.
   ``People have suggested it in the past, but this is the first
documentation of it,'' said Bednarz, who is director of higher
education research at the Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Kempton, Pa.,
and an associate professor at the University of New Mexico.
   ``We expected to see two hawks hunting together. I was amazed to
see units of four, five and six hawks. ... We got to see it
repeatedly,'' Bednarz said in a telephone interview.
   Cooperative hunting, in which predators work together to kill
prey larger than they could bring down individually, is well known
among lions, wolves, hyenas, wild dogs, killer whales _ and humans.
But Bednarz said his study shows that hawks also are able to hunt
together for their mutual benefit.
   In more than 400 hours of observations at the Los Medanos Raptor
Area near Carlsbad, N.M., Bednarz said he watched groups of five to
six hawks use two basic coordinated attacks to bring down rabbits.
   Bednarz said the most common tactic, which he called the
surprise pounce, required the hawks to attack a rabbit from several
different directions at once, forcing it to stay away from cover.
   ``They will work the rabbit in such a way that it becomes
mentally and physically exhausted,'' Bednarz said. ``They keep it
moving and keep it making decisions until it makes the wrong
decision.''
   Bednarz said if the rabbit leaves its back unprotected, a hawk
swoops in and delivers a lethal blow to the back of the neck.
That's the only way, said Bednarz, that a Harris hawk, which weighs
about 2 pounds, can kill a jackrabbit, which can weigh as much as 7
pounds.
   Another tactic Bednarz observed is what he calls the ``flush and
ambush.''
   A team of hawks, e said, will chase a rabbit until it finally
takes cover. Two or three hawks will perch nearby and a pair of the
birds will land near the rabbit and try to flush it from the cover.
When the bunny finally flees, the perched hawks drop swiftly for
the kill.
   Even dinner time is coordinated for the Harris hawks, Bednarz
said.
   When the hawks are feeding, two of the group will remain at a
nearby high place, on the lookout for eagles or ospreys or other
species who might try to steal the kill. When an intruder is
spotted, the sentinel will sound an alarm and the Harris hawks rise
and attack together, usually chasing away the invader.
   Bednarz said most of the hawk groups that hunt together are
extended families that may include a mated pair, yearlings and
older offspring. The group usually is no larger than six.
   The female is the larger of the Harris hawks and usually
dominates the group, Bednarz said. But on the hunt, the female is
less likely to attack the prey and more likely to play ``a
distractor role.''
   ``She distracts the prey and keeps it in play for the other
hawks, forcing it back into the area of vulnerability,'' the
researcher said.
   He said birds seem to communicate with body movement. As the
hunt begins, he birds will perch hundreds of yards apart. When one
of the hawks sights a possible meal, its movement quickly attracts
the other birds and the hunt is on, Bednarz said.
   Harris hawks live in the deserts of Texas, Arizona and New
Mexico. They feed on rodents and lizards during part of the year,
but apparently hunt together to bring down jackrabbits and desert
cottontail rabbits in the winter months.
