<HEAD>Anthrax Killing Animals in South African Game Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An outbreak of anthrax in
Kruger National Park has killed more than 200 animals, including
buffalo, impala, jackals, lions and elephants, the park's head of
research said.
   Vossie de Vos told the South African Broadcasting Co. on Tuesday
that an innoculation campaign had started against the disease. The
last major anthrax outbreak in the huge game park in northeastern
South Africa was in 1970.
   Anthrax is caused by tiny flesh-eating flies that lodge in the
wounds of animals and lay eggs. The disease can be transmitted to
humans, but can be halted by washing the wounds.
