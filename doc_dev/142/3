   A hyena that accidentally locked
itself in the bathroom at a game park got the last laugh _ it tore
the room apart and opened the shower tap, flooding the house.
   The Star newspaper said Friday the hyena spent 24 hours in the
bathroom last weekend at the house in Skukuza, a village in Kruger
National Park in eastern South Africa. It apparently wandered into
the house while the occupants were away.
   The hyena pulled down curtains, ripped the medicine chest from
the wall, smashed the toilet seat, damaged a towel rail and bit
into aerosal shaving cream and deodorant cans, the Star said.
   It also turned on the shower, causing overflowing water to seep
under the door into the rest of the house, the newspaper said.
   Neighbors saw water coming out from under the front door and
alerted game rangers, who shot the hyena with a tranquilizer dart
through the bathroom window. Tests on the animal indicated no
serious injuries, and the hyena was released.
