   A plane ferrying American
cigarettes to Moscow crash-landed in flames northeast of Prague.
The six-member crew survived, but looters made off with some of the
cargo.
   The Tupolev 154 was carrying 15 tons of American-made cigarettes
to the Soviet capital from Switzerland on Saturday when fire broke
out on board, the Rude Pravo newpaper said.
   The three-engine Soviet plane landed in a field near Dvur
Kralove, about 75 miles northeast of Prague.
   The jet was on fire when it landed, and it took several hours
for firefighters to extinguish the blaze, another newspaper,
Obcansky Denik, reported. Some of the cargo was saturated with jet
fuel and burned, the paper said.
   ``It is incredible that all six memebers of the crew survived,
nobody was seriously hurt,'' the daily quoted Dr. Jarosalv Houf as
saying.
   On Sunday, Czechoslovak television accused residents of acting
like hyenas. It broadcast footage showing dozens of people
retrieving packages of cigarettes from the wrecked fuselage.
   ``When trying to put things right, the police heard verbal abuse
impossible to use in print,'' Rude Pravo said.
   A pack of American cigarettes is worth 50 Czechoslovak crowns,
or $2. The average monthly salary in Czechoslovakia would buy only
about 60 packs of such cigarettes.
