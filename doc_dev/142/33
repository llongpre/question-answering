<HEAD>`Miss Daisy' Says Oscar Movie Started With Endowed Play</HEAD>

   Actress Jessica Tandy, one of several artists
supporting government financial support for the arts, says the
movie for which she won an academy award this year owes a debt to
the National Endowment for the Arts.
   The 80-year-old performer, winner of the best actress award for
her lead role in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' told a congressional panel
Tuesday that the movie was based on a 1987 play that had received
money from the endowment.
   The endowment has come under close scrutiny since last year when
conservative lawmakers pointed out that a few exhibits receiving
NEA funds contained art that many would consider objectionable,
sacrilegious or obscene.
   The most outspoken criticism of efforts to put conditions on NEA
funding came from theater producer Joseph Papp, who this year
refused a $50,000 grant because of restrictions placed on funding.
   Papp referred to the congressional critics of NEA as ``jackals
and hyenas'' ready to pounce upon an endowment that was weakened by
constant underfunding during the Reagan administration.
   This year's appropriation for the NEA requires that art grants
be reviewed for possibly objectionable content.
   The subcommittee that heard from Papp, Miss Tandy and several
other artists is conducting hearings on a request for $175 million
in fiscal 1991 for the NEA.
