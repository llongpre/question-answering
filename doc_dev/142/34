   Small planes are flying tons of food to
thousands of starving civil war refugees, but relief officials say
fighting and flooding will keep help from reaching hundreds of
thousands in remote areas.
   Twin-engine Cessnas on Sunday flew some of the 90 tons of food
to about 40,000 people jammed into Abyei, 500 miles southwest of
the capital, Khartoum. The $1 million U.S.-financed airlift began
Thursday and is to last 10 days.
   Brian Wannop, a representative of the U.N. Development Program
in Khartoum, said officials visiting Abyei in the past few days
said the emaciated southerners were too weak to prevent scavenging
hyenas from dragging away the bodies of relatives at night.
   The refugees left behind their crops and cattle to escape a
civil war between the government and the Sudan People's Liberation
Army, fighting for economic and political reform since 1983 and
claiming to control 90 percent of the southern countryside.
   The group, demanding autonomy for the Christian and animist
African south from the Moslem-dominated government in the north,
has shot down relief planes because they say the flights may be
military-related. Abyei is just beyond the reach of the fighting.
   Western relief officials say the airlift to Abyei is tiny
compared to the extent of devastation facing hundreds of thousands
of others in less accessible areas.
   Wannop said that in the past five years of the civil war, about
2 million southerners fled their homes to camps and shantytowns in
southeastern Ethiopia, central and western Sudan and around the
capital of Khartoum. He said 150,000 people fled to the western
region of Darfur and south Kordofan, where Abyei is located.
   A Western relief official said it would take two to three weeks
before the impact of the supply mission could be felt. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eight to 10
people, weakened by malnutrition, lack of medical treatment and a
long trek to refugee camps, were dying every day.
   An estimated 80 people a day died in the area's refugee camps in
July and August, the worst months in a summer that some relief
officials say took up to 10,000 lives. They said most were the
elderly or young children.
   Wannop said a possible explanation for the lower death rate was
that all the younger children had already died during the difficult
summer months.
   The Sudanese Red Crescent says Abyei's population of 10,000 has
swelled to 40,000 by displaced people.
   Sudanese officials say the Western agencies are exaggerating the
number of refugees throughout the south and that the government has
drawn up a plan to supply relief to about 224,000 people.
   ``The people affected by the famine and starvation are moving
northward,'' said Haj Tayeb, Sudan's acting commissioner for relief
and rehabilitation. ``We reached some of them and gave them aid.''
   The government earlier expelled several Western relief agencies
for allegedly working with the rebels to get supplies to stranded
southerners.
   Heavy rains and floods in August have exacerbated conditions for
the southerners and hampered efforts by Sudanese and foreign relief
agencies to help them.
   Relief food and medicines last reached Abyei in June, before
Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government halted relief operations
during the rainy season, when the guerrilla war intensified.
   Rebel gunners shot down two relief planes in 1986 and 1987,
killing more than 70 people.
