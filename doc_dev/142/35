<LEADPARA>  TED Turner's two cable entertainment networks -- TBS and TNT -- are gradually
emerging as the places to find the best in TV nature programs, even when
compared with the formidable PBS programming and cable's Discovery Channel.;  
 If you want proof, check out tonight's premiere of "The Trials of Life," a
new 12-hour nature series from TV's leading naturalist, Sir David
Attenborough, maker of the acclaimed "Life on Earth" and "The Living Planet"
series.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     This is an absolutely spellbinding series that examines all the steps in
the life cycles of a diverse assortment of Earth's creatures, from birth to
death. Produced as a series of one-hour programs, "Trials" will be shown two
at a time by TNT in six two-hour installments, tonight through Friday night.; 
  Attenborough used 40 camera operators to capture the marvelous sights you'll
see, spending two years filming on every continent. As usual, he's there on
the scene, letting crabs crawl over him, pulling a baby opossum out of his
shirt or feeding a caterpillar to a wasp off his bare hand.;     Ordeal of
birth;  In the first hour, appropriately called "Arriving," the abiding theme
is the awesome ordeal of birth. I guarantee you'll be blown away by what you
see, including:;    (check)  Tens of thousands of mother crabs crossing the
sands of Christmas Island in the Indian Ocean at midnight to deposit millions
of eggs in the water at high tide.;    (check)  Aerial views of billions of
herring eggs, forming milky slicks along the coastline. When the tide
subsides, there are so many eggs that they resemble snow drifts at the water's
edge.;    (check)  Hundreds of squirming mantis eggs hatching from a single
egg mass.;    (check)  A devoted female wasp digging a hole for her eggs in
hard-baked earth in the American southwest, then hunting caterpillars to stuff
into the hole to serve as ready food for the hatching young.;    (check)  A
hyena giving birth in the privacy of her underground den, then cuddling her
newborn pups in a profound demonstration of mother love.;    (check)  Mother
bats weaving "safety nets" to catch their emerging babies, so they won't fall
to their death on the cavern floor.;    Tonight's second hour follows the new
arrivals into the hazards of their first few days of life. And they're often
severe ones.;    Baby elephant seals must avoid the rushes of huge adult seals
and fend for themselves when their starving mothers swim off to feed for the
first time in weeks. Tiger sharks raid the "flying school" for baby seabirds,
dining on the ones who get airborne too slowly. And so forth.;    It's amazing
to see what Attenborough's cameras have caught. It must have taken infinite
patience to spot a mother lace bug defending her young against a jumping
spider or baby scorpions clambering onto their mother's shell-like back to
nestle under her venomous stinger.;    But this isn't just a collection of
"amazing" snapshots. Attenborough makes certain viewers learn from what they
see. When an Australian crocodile is filmed kicking dead leaves over her eggs,
we learn the decaying leaves create the heat necessary to determine the sex of
the baby crocs. If it reaches 32 degrees centigrade, all the babies will be
male. At 30 degrees, they'll all be female. Temperatures in between provide
some of each.;     Eyeing bats;  Researchers for "The Trials of Life" even
discovered how mother bats identify their own babies when they return from
nightly feeding to a cavern roof packed with millions of baby bats: They can
pick the cries of their own babies out of all that screeching!;    They even
show us why an Arctic fox doesn't quickly gobble a large egg he steals after
being chased and pecked by a covey of mother snow geese: He knows the
egg-laying won't last long, so he buries his catch and runs back to try for
more before it's too late.;    If you love nature films, you mustn't miss a
moment of this spectacular series. (box)  </TEXT>
