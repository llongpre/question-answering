<HEAD>Book Says Onassis Plotted Nude Photos of Jackie</HEAD>

   Aristotle Onassis plotted with photographers to
publish candid, nude photographs of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis so
she would stop complaining about tamer shots taken by papparazzi,
according to a new book.
   ``He figured if she appeared in the nude, nothing else they did
could ever offend her again,'' the late lawyer Roy Cohn is quoted
as saying in ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' an upcoming unauthorized
biography of the former first lady written by C. David Heymann. It
is being serialized in the weekly Star, a supermarket tabloid.
   The photographs of Mrs. Onassis sunbathing on Skorpios, the
Greek island where she married Onassis in 1968, were taken by 10
photographers using telephoto lenses and underwater cameras and
appeared in magazines around the world.
   Nancy Tuckerman, spokeswoman for Mrs. Onassis, said when the
first part of the series appeared last week that the former first
lady would have no comment.
   The book also detailed Mrs. Onassis' lavish spending sprees and
said that the question of money came up at the funeral of Onassis,
who died on March 15, 1975, the Star reports in its Monday edition.
   Mrs. Onassis' brother-in-law, Sen. Edward Kennedy, who earlier
had negotiated her prenuptial contract with Onassis, rode in the
funeral limousine with her and Christina Onassis, Aristotle's
daughter.
   Christina Onassis, who has since died, told Heymann in a brief
interview that Kennedy turned to her in the limousine and said,
``Now, it's time to take care of Jackie.''
   ``It seemed almost inconceivable that Ted Kennedy would choose
that moment to discuss financial matters,'' said Christina Onassis.
``But it was Jackie's hyena-like smile that drove me from the car.
She was like a hungry vulture waiting to feast on my father's
flesh.''
   Book sales begin May 2. The New York Daily News, Cosmopolitan,
New Woman and McCall's have second serialization rights.
