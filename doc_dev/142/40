<LEADPARA>  'NEW and Unusual Mozart," a sort of Fringe to the Mozart &amp; His Time festival,
should be named "Mozart's Coattails.";    There's been no quality control on
the events; basically, anyone who wanted to throw Mozart's name into the hat
could get listed in the festival brochure. The stuff runs the gamut from
well-meaning to sopho-moronic.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Kathryn Roszak's "Puer Aeternus" ("Eternal Child") was presented by the
Goethe-Institut of German culture, presumably because it's based on a story by
Thomas Mann and features a song, "Das Veilchen" ("The Violet"), to a poem of
Goethe.;    The unoriginal premise of this 20-minute mishmash is that Mozart's
timeless music can make performers forget their egos and impresarios the box
office take. No argument here.;    The very mixed talent pool includes four
lovely girls from San Francisco Ballet's school and two really bad actors.
Mozart is a marionette handled by two inept puppeteers. Also present is San
Francisco Opera soprano Maria Fortuna, whose gorgeous voice shines in the song
and an aria from "Zaide.";    Over at 1800 Sq. Feet, an erstwhile garage used
by the High Risk Group, there's "Warehouse Mozart," a program of odd,
bumptious, sometimes amusing but mostly insulting stuff.;    A pair of mimes
called Circus Absurdus bumbles through "Sonata for Violin and Music Stand."
Craig Landry swishes around in "Moe," hopping over four plaster busts of
Mozart. An alleged trapeze artist and even more alleged singer, Julie Queen,
perches on a swing in her undies and warbles the songs of the Queen of the
Night (get it?) from "The Magic Flute.";    Rick Darnell of High Risk, whose
group dances almost exclusively about the overriding concern of the gay
community, ran essentially the same material on the AIDS epidemic through a
Mozartian sieve (bits of the Requiem, no less) and called it "Ho-Mozart.";   
In this politically correct work, Christine Carraher pinned toys standing for
Mozart's life and times (a doll, an inflatable globe) to a clothesline and
found commonalities therein: "Mozart and I were both born into white
supremacist empires.";    Carraher can dance, but hardly so in this
constricted space. Of the 1,800 square feet, only about 50 are usable for
dancing when more than 80 people are crammed into a space that seats 60.;   
Performance artist Hank Hyena was the night's saving grace. "The way to
understand a culture is by examining its underwear," he said. (No argument
here, either.) In his "Austrian Undergarments of the 18th Century," an array
of corsets, bustiers, panniers, falsies and chastity belts was modeled by such
well-endowed hunks as Lewdwig and Captain Codpiece.;  Puer Aeternus; By
