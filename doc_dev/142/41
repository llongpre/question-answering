The knock on Bruce Baum has always been his reliance on props, that he can't 
float a show without those buoys of low humor. 
</P>
<P>
As is his way, Baum propped himself up throughout his 45-minute performance at 
the Hyatt Regency Alicante's Top Secret Comedy Club Friday night, pulling out 
one visual exclamation point after another. 
</P>
<P>
He donned his wacky rock band glasses (Kiss had to be the inspiration), he 
displayed his drawing of bearded sperm, he twisted his rubber record, he 
twirled his inflatable globe, he turned on his cymbal-playing monkey, he . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's Baum's style, and you expect it. What was off-putting Friday was how old 
all these sight gags are. Baum's been using the same props for a while now, 
many reflecting a dated point of view. He needs to visit the toy store again. 
</P>
<P>
Baum should also update much of his verbal material. Several times he used 
jokes linked to impressions that have long evaporated in the public mind. Like 
when he did a prop-heavy, staccato interpretation of a few music videos, most 
from the mid-'80s. 
</P>
<P>
All were pretty forgettable back then, and it wasn't surprising that some 
didn't register as Baum frantically tried to find a satiric tempo. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, he brought up that stale Coors commercial featuring Mark Harmon 
standing in a stream. Baum reminded the audience that the actor makes this big 
point about how Coors uses only the finest water. But Baum is thinking, "Hey, 
get your feet out of my beer!" 
</P>
<P>
Never a great joke, but it probably was reasonable when the ad's imagery was 
fresh a few years ago. What about all the current commercials worth bruising? 
</P>
<P>
In defense of Baum, the small crowd at this small club did seem charmed by his 
performance. Most apparently were familiar with his career (a few murmured the 
punch lines a beat before Baum delivered them) and may have seen this as a live 
reel of the comic's greatest hits. A passel of gags did go back to the late 
'70s, when Baum started performing stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
And there was something pleasantly nostalgic about his bit on '60s "alternative 
theater," where he assumed a very cool, very serious persona, lit his face with 
a flashlight, and dealt in a little nihilistic poetry babble. 
</P>
<P>
That was weird, and it worked. Baum's best moments surfaced after he slipped 
into a bizarre mode, with a timeless orientation minus the props. Like his 
reflections on going to the dentist: it's not the pain of the drill that 
bothers him, but "when the drill gets stuck and the dentist spins around and 
around." 
</P>
<P>
A visit to the zoo is unnerving: Why do they always put the paranoid animals 
next to the cages with the hyenas and mockingbirds? 
</P>
<P>
All this talk about rap music also got him thinking. Blacks didn't invent it, 
whites did, but they call it "square dancing." 
</P>
<P>
Still, these were brief flourishes in an otherwise creaky dance. Baum, a comic 
who has shown he knows the steps, should look for some new partners.
