<LEADPARA>  MOZART lived during the Enlightenment, when it was expected of gentlefolk that
they be conversant with all the arts, from philosophy to politics, and to be
accomplished performers of salon entertainment, from dramatic tableaux to
keyboard duets.;    So it's appropriate that "Mozart &amp; His Time" include a
healthy assortment of other events, both traditional and outrageous,
celebrating the achievements of this most prolific and elegant of composers.
Here are highlights from the dance, theater, film and hard-to-classify

updated version of Beaumarchais' social comedy, "The Marriage of Figaro,"
source of Mozart's opera. Through June 9.;    (check) Magic Theater presents
James Keller's contemporary reinterpretation of a classic novella by the

(check) "Puer Aeternus" ("Eternal Boy") is Kathryn Roszak's dance-theater
meditation, using singers from San Francisco Opera Center, on Mozart's short
but brilliant life. June 6, 8-9 and 20.;    (check) Roszak is using Mozart's

arias from "The Magic Flute" from a trapeze. High Risk, which dances about gay
men's issues, is somewhat more sober, performing dances and songs based on the
"Requiem." We're not sure who's responsible for the fashion show, "Austrian
Undergarments of the Late 18th Century," but it's certain that Mozart, who
loved toilet humor and risque jokes, would approve. June 7-8.;    (check)
