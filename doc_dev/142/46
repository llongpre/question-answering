Hombres y mujeres, gather round the campfire. This week's story is 'El
Mariachi' and it is a cracker. Once in Mexico there was a handsome
travelling guitarist, or mariachi-player, who carried his instrument inside
a big black case. But one day a gangster's contract was put out on a
fugitive killer carrying an arsenal of guns concealed in - yes] - a
near-identical big black case.
You see the opportunities for comical-dramatical confusion? Simple but
inspired. And imagine them enacted in a movie. Woofling-whistling music
after Ennio Morricone; lunging visuals a la Sergio Leone; screen wide as a
water-melon slice; a girl; a town; a lot of chases; a crowning gunfight.
Robert Rodriguez's El Mariachi touched its lighted cigar to festival fuses
this year and blew several happy audiences, including mine at Berlin, right
out of their seats. As often in cinema - see Metropolis, Casablanca,
L'Avventura, Airplane] - the most ridiculous plots are the most inspired.
Here we have mistaken identity to the power of infinity, as a simple mix-up
between black-suited itinerants becomes something like a Feydeau farce
played out in a Spaghetti Western set.
The timing does it. Who expects madness to be paced and choreographed like a
ballet? But from the first moody swagger into the first wide-angle bar; from
the first hair-raising zoom into the knuckle-cracking finger-flexing of a
harmonica player; from the first stomach-lurching camera movement that
challenges gravity and a heavy breakfast; from the first proof that the
sultry heroine means sado-sexual business ('Sing]' she hisses to the hero,
holding a knife to a sensitive body part as he sits in his bath); from the
first striking of the villain's match on his henchman's chin stubble; from
all this to the drop-dead grace and perfection of the showdown El Mariachi
is as major a delight as a minor film can be.
Made in Mexico by a first-time American director on a joke budget (Dollars
7000), it shows what human enterprise can do when tinged with judicious
insanity. (Rodriguez raised the money by hiring himself out as a guinea pig
for a drugs trial. Young film-makers, do not practise this at home.) The
movie has no content but more than enough style to make up the deficiency.
*****
The Edinburgh Film Festival, just begun, boasts El Mariachi plus Derek
Jarman's Blue (reviewed by me last week, announced for a London opening next
week) plus a serviceable blend of the past year's festival successes and
world or UK premieres.
These include Anthony Minghella's Mr Wonderful, John Sayles's Passion Fish,
Ken Loach's Raining Stones, Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden and the
customary egg-and-spoon race between young unknowns for the prize of Best
Young Film-Maker. The seniors mentioned have all produced modest work or
work already noted at other cine-sprees, so let us forget about them until
they reach public cinemas.
The youngsters, pitching apprentice shorts and non-features into the
Edinburgh pot, are a more intriguing mix of the craftsmanlike-conventional
with the wild and interesting.
Nicole Mitchell's Spring Belle (fly-on-wall fresco of a Sydney 'Come
Dancing' junket), Jon Camoy's Dinner With Malibu (teenage boy spies on Dad's
girlfriends) and Don McKellar's Blue (no relation to Jarman's film, but
starring rival movie-maker David Cronenberg as a porn-obsessed office boss)
are wry short stories on film: teasers well-lensed if a little tame in their
teasing.
Alexis Bisticas' The Clearing is stranger and more haunting: a camera's-view
saunter through a woodland where nice and naughty actions are glimpsed and
where a lonely saxophone sound leads on like Jack O' Lantern. Finally the
camera does a cut and about-turn and we see and recognise the walker's
famous face: that radiant, runic old phiz shining with secret knowledge and
transcendent questions. (To identify, think of the person we've referred to
most in these paragraphs).
But the best of the young movies is Dan Geva's Jerusalem: Rhythms Of A
Distant City. This handheld portrait of a waking town - Geva's hungry,
headlong camera devours everything from the morning's fresh loaves to the
first wailers at Jerusalem's Wall - is a mini-tribute to Ruttman's classic
documentary Berlin, Symphony Of A City and a knockout in its own right.
Kinetic technique matches kinetic vision: a pantherish pantheism leaping on
every detail small or large to celebrate the marvel of living and the even
greater marvel (in a city) of living together.
*****
Fifty years ago this week filming began on Les Enfants Du Paradis. Half a
century later, we are still marvelling. Back in a new print is the film the
French Academy once voted the country's best of all time: three hours of
romance, epigram and superfine melodrama set among theatre folk in 19th
century Paris. Lines crackle; faces glow or glower above the wing collars.
Pierre Brasseur's leonine actor, Marcel Herrand's preening
playwright/murderer, Jean-Louis Barrault's ice-featured mime (resembling
Kenneth Williams re-sculpted by Bernini) and Arletty's beauty of the
boulevard du crime, the melting-eyed Garance . . . Four-to-umpteen
characters caught up in a time of French history as troubled as that in
which the movie was made.
This may be the least filmic of all great films. Jacques Prevert's script,
Marcel Carnes direction, Alexandre Trauner's sets, conjured from the moral
and political rubble of Occupied France, are elegant, paperweight constructs
that sheer will and passion seem to have made monumental. The truth-based
main characters - only Garance had no historical forebear - step in and out
of their professional fictions no less surreally, but far more magically,
than A. Schwarzenegger did in Last Action Hero. And as in Olivier's
almost-contemporary Henry V, theatre is both matrix and metaphor for the
dramatic switchbackings that flow from it. A wonder; and at 50 younger than
ever.
*****
The rest of the week consists of a bad spoof and a worse skin-flick. Hot
Shots] Part Deux is a worthy sequel to Hot Shots] Part Un: 90 minutes of
legalised gag starvation with Charlie Sheen as our gung-ho hero, here
changed from trainee top-gunner to Rambo clone. He sports Stallone-style
hair and Stallone-style muscles. (Do these Hollywood stars go to a gym or
plug themselves into a giant bicycle pump?). And he has an urge to topple
Saddam Hussein (Jerry Haleva).
Saddam, of course, steals the show. Lighting his cigar with a desktop oil
derrick, hand-hoovering crumbs from his silk pajama trousers, raiding his
fridge for Camel Milk or Yankee Dog Burgers, he is a pantomime villain
turned politically-incorrect pratfaller. He is also the only funny thing for
miles around. Elsewhere, the jokes drop like stones; and the long, middle,
Saddamless section could be laughed at only by paid hyenas trained by 20th
Century Fox. I thought I heard some of these at the Press show.
Lake Consequence is funnier, though not by intention. From the stable of
executive producer Zalman King (9 1/2 Weeks, Full Moon Junction) comes
another high-faluting essay in soft porn, this one telling the story of the
Housewife (Joan Severance) and the Tree-pruner (Billy Zane). She fancies
him; he fancies her; off she goes, accidentally abducted when his trailer
moves off with her still in it.
They end up in Lake Consequence, wherever that is. Lots of Jacuzzis. Lots of
percussion and snare-drums on the soundtrack. (It sounds like a blue movie
filmed at the Peking Opera). And lots of Mount Rushmore-style sex, where
giant close-ups mean you cannot tell a nose from a thighbone, a pair of
breasts from a full moon junction. To enhance vision (if you could possibly
be interested), take a pair of binoculars and stare through the wrong end.
