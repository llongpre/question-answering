<F P=106> ["AL-AHALI Opinion" column: "We Are Not A Gate To Tighten </F>
The Siege of Iraq"] 
  [Text] We have condemned the U.S. aggression against the 
Port of al-'Aqabah and considered it a manifestation of the 
comprehensive hostile policy against the whole region. This 
falls within the framework of the attempts aimed at imposing a 
new regional order under U.S. tutelage and hegemony. We also 
cannot find an excuse for entrenching -- with our approval -- 
this aggression against our national sovereignty under the 
pretext of conducting land inspection. 
  We want an answer to this simple question: Is there a 
decision to monitor, besiege, or inspect Jordan? We know there 
is no decision in this regard; and the UN Sanctions Committee 
says there is no such decision. The Americans are the ones who 
are imposing the siege, and the evidence is clear. The talks to 
lift the siege are being held with U.S. envoys -- the last of 
whom was Secretary of State Christopher -- not with Butrus-Ghali 
or with the president of the Security Council as the Iraqi 
brothers are doing. 
  We wanted the government to champion the opinion of the 
people, not only the interests of some importers and merchants 
who are harmed by U.S. piracy. We were ready to fight together 
in one trench to confront the U.S. aggression against Jordan. 
The government's view, however, was different. It opted for 
the policy of ostrich in front of the U.S. hyena, thereby 
ignoring the view of the people and their political forces as 
well as the good reputation of our country on the international 
level. 
  Warren Christopher's statements in London aroused anger and 
resentment because he linked these measures with tightening the 
siege of Iraq. Do they want Jordan to become a barrier in the 
face of Iraq or a gate to ease the burdens of the unjust siege 
imposed on the people who have always been generous with Jordan, 
Syria, and Palestine and who watered the soil of these countries 
with the blood of their martyrs? 
  The policy of weakness and hiding heads in the sand will 
only 
lead to more humiliation and disgrace. We are not like that and 
we will not be like that. We will continue to resist the policy 
of capitulation and normalization. We will never agree to 
seeing Jordan become a passageway for U.S.-Israeli peace 
regardless of the sacrifices.
