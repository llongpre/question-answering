<LEADPARA>  Sforzando! -- As with every other arts organization in the city, San Francisco
Ballet is readying itself for June's Mozart &amp; His Time festival.;    Resident
choreographer Val Caniparoli will create a pas de deux for Evelyn Cisneros and
Anthony Randazzo, set to the slow movement of Mozart's final piano concerto.
And artistic director Helgi Tomasson plans a new ballet to the "Haffner"
Symphony. The program, June 25 and 27 in the War Memorial Opera House, also
will include Tomasson's "Menuetto," set to a series of Mozart contredanses.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But all this still isn't enough to fill an evening, and the company is
looking about for another work to perform. There's an excellent one already in
its repertory, "Mozart C Minor Mass," one of the strongest pieces ever made by
former artistic director Michael Smuin. However, relations between Smuin and
the ballet being what they are (chilly), it probably won't be considered.;   
In other SFB news: Newly promoted principal dancer Shannon Lilly is making
ready for her debut as Princess Aurora in "Sleeping Beauty," partnered by Yuri
Zhukov. If last year's procedure is any indication, she will dance it at the
May 4 matinee.;    MOZARTIANA -- This, the title of one of George Balanchine's
loveliest ballets, is a short-lived but functional heading for news of the
upcoming Mozart festival in San Francisco.;    Besides SFB, other dance
