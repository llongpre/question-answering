<LEADPARA>  THE question of who first isolated the AIDS virus, a subject of heated debate
between researchers in France and America for more than six years, may have
been at least partly resolved Monday.;    A major puzzle emerged when the two
original strains isolated by Dr. Robert Gallo of the National Institutes of
Health and Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in France turned out to
be virtually identical.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     According to a paper to be published this week in Science magazine, a new
finding by Montagnier points strongly to lab contaminations. Both sides now
seem to agree that a particularly fast-multiplying strain of the virus
apparently contaminated samples in Montagnier's lab. Unaware the contamination
had occurred, the French lab sent the samples to Gallo's lab. The aggressive
strain then apparently contaminated samples in the American lab as well.;   
Both labs ended up reporting virtually identical strains, and accusations of
misappropriation flew.; Bugs defended; A plan to turn insects into astronauts
is bugging animal rights activists.;    Amateur rocketeers plan to launch
model rockets filled with bees and grasshoppers next year in recognition of
the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World.;   
High school and college students would build the rockets for experiments in
which they would measure temperature, air pressure and radiation surrounding
the rockets and observe the insects through video cameras.;    The creatures
and the equipment would parachute back to earth. But the Humane Society and
other groups say blasting bugs is cruel and a waste of time.; New telescope;
An $40 million array of radio telescope antennas will be built atop Mauna Kea,
an extinct volcano in Hawaii, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
announced Monday.;    The antennas will work together as a single unit, to be
called the Submillimeter Telescope Array. They will operate in a narrow band
of short wavelengths between infrared and radio in the electromagnetic
spectrum. With this band scientists can look into the center of exploding
galaxies and pierce the halos of comets and the atmospheres of planets.; Hyena
siblicide; Carrying sibling rivalry to an extreme, hour-old spotted hyenas
routinely attack their younger siblings just moments after birth, report
scientists at the University of California, Berkeley.;    The practice has
been observed in some birds but never before in mammals. Berkeley zoologist
Dr. Laurence G. Frank speculated that the attacks might be due to high levels
of two male hormones present at birth in both males and females.;    Spotted
hyenas normally give birth to litters of two cubs. Both are born with open
eyes and a full set of incisors and are immediately capable of strong,
coordinated action.;    In the wild, the attacks can result in death from
infection or the inability to nurse. At Berkeley, the scientists filming the
births in pens rescued the second cub. Their findings are reported in the
current issue of Science.  </TEXT>
