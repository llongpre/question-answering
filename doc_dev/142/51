<F P=106> [Report by N. Patterton] </F>
  [Text] Skukuza April 8 SAPA -- The summit of South Africa's 
four top political leaders was still underway in the Kruger 
National Park late on Friday [8 April] afternoon. The four -- 
State President F W de Klerk, Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP] leader 
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini and African 
National Congress President Nelson Mandela -- began their talks 
at 3.30PM and there was no indication when the meeting would end. 
  A large contingent of journalists were restricted to the 
Skukuza area as they were not allowed into the Jakkalsbessie 
Camp, the venue for the talks, government spokesman Marius 
Kleynhans said. 
  King Zwelithini was at Skukuza on Thursday night, while Mr 
Mandela, Mr Buthelezi and Mr de Klerk arrived on Friday morning. 
  The ANC leader and the Zulu king met from 9.30AM to 2PM, Mr 
Kleynhans said. 
  King Goodwill's delegation included about 20 indunas 
[chiefs], and the ANC was represented by Secretary-General Cyril 
Ramaphosa, Executive Committee member Mac Maharaj and Communist 
Party Chairman Joe Slovo. 
  The four leaders met to discuss the future of kwaZulu/Natal, 
violence, and whether elections would be possible in the 
province. 
  Journalists battled to file stories as only one pay card 
telephone line was available at Skukuza for the media. 
  While the government and other delegations earlier refused 
to 
disclose the venue of the talks, the SABC [South African 
Broadcasting Corporation] had advance notice and arrived at 
Skukuza with an outside broadcast truck to provide coverage of 
the event.
