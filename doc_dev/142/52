   The brother of Romania's late dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu went on trial Monday accused of killing seven
people during last December's bloody revolution that ended more
than 40 years of Communist rule.
   Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu, 66, a former deputy interior minister
and police general, is charged with ``aggravated murder,''
instigation to commit genocide, and attempted murder, for his part
in efforts to suppress the popular revolt that ended his brother's
24-year hold on power.
   Under Romanian law ``aggravated murder'' is the slaying of more
than one person.
   According to the indictment, the defendant ordered some 1,000
police cadets under his command to fire on thousands of
demonstrators in the streets of Bucharest on Dec. 21-22. When they
refused, he allegedly shot seven protesters.
   Ceausescu has denied the accusations but has admitted the lesser
charge of illegal possession of firearms, the indictment said.
   The trial, which was expected to last through the week, took
place in a converted theater hall ringed with policemen and
soldiers in full combat gear. Two armored personnel carriers
blocked the entrance.
   The defendant sat flanked by two helmeted policemen and gazed
impassively at a three-man panel of military judges headed by Col.
Igon Dima. Ceausescu bears an eerie physical resemblance to his
late brother.
   He occasionally turned to glance at the courtroom, where access
was restricted to journalists and members of the victims' families.
   The 15-page indictment accused Ceausescu of ``issuing orders to
his men to open fire on demonstrators.'' It said he personally
``distributed ammunition to the cadets.''
   The document quoted witnesses among the security forces who
testified that ``he was shouting like a beast and shot his gun'' at
the crowds.
   ``He acted to suppress the revolution and fired his gun, killing
seven persons,'' the indictment said.
   At one point during the trial, the parents of one of the alleged
victims, tears streaming from their eyes, accused defense attorney
Vasile Soroceanu of ``protecting this hyena.''
   But Ceausescu told the court he did nt initiate orders to fire
on the deomnstrators. ``I did not give any orders on my own
initiative to repress the demonstrators, but I passed on through my
aides the orders I received from the minister of interior.''
   Soroceanu told the court the prosecution ``arbitrarily chose
seven victims from the hundreds who died without any proof that
(Andruta) Ceausescu had killed them.''
   Hundreds of people were killed in the popular uprising that
started in mid-December.
   Nicolae Ceausescu was toppled Dec. 22 and executed three days
later with his wife, Elena, after a summary trial before a military
tribunal.
   Following their execution, the death sentence was abolished by
the provisional leadership that took power in the chaos of the
revolution.
   If found guilty, the maximum penalty Ceausescu can face is life
imprisonment.
   Four of the former president's closest aides were sentenced to
life imprisonment by a military tribunal last month. His two sons
and daughter are also in custody awaiting trial, likely to open in
late April or early May, Romanian reporters said.
