   The first professional acting work by soap
opera star Ian Buchanan, for ``The Equalizer'' on CBS, left him
bruised, in tears and wondering if he'd made the right move in
giving up modeling for acting.
   Buchanan's career as a model had taken him on assignment to
France, Italy, Japan and other exotic places. He had one of the most
photographed faces in Europe.
   Currently starring as Duke Lavery in ABC's ``General Hospital,''
he was lured to New York from his native Scotland first as a model.
But despite the success, he wasn't satisfied.
   ``I first started working in the hotel industry,'' he said.
``Then I discovered there were warmer places than Scotland. I headed
for the sun and started modeling in Spain. Modeling sounds better in
Spanish.
   ``When you're a model you travel all over Europe. You can call
them a traveling circus or a pack of hyenas. You get there first,
and you never tell your best friend they're hiring. Models are
everything people say they are.''
   He made his career change by enrolling at the New York Actors
Studio, founded by Lee Strasberg. ``Strasberg died the next day,''
he said. ``I hung in for about a year. I also studied with Marcia
Haufrecht.''
   His first acting job on the episode of ``The Equalizer'' was a
very bumpy ride.
   ``They dragged me down the stairs and killed me,'' he said. ``We
had no rehearsal. The director was in a hurry. They threw me into
the back of a car, banged my head and drove off. I was not supposed
to have any dialogue.
   ``They looked at the film and said, `Your lips keep moving.' I
kept yelling, `I'm not a stunt man!' I was black and blue. I was
wearing my own shoes. When they dragged me they ripped the toes off.
I was in tears. But I was in show business. No one said it was easy.
I did get to see Edward Woodward. I saw him out of the corner of my
eye when they threw me in the trunk.''
   His luck changed when he met Gloria Monte, then executive
producer of ``General Hospital.'' At that time ``General Hospital''
was going through the roof as television's supersoap opera.
   He auditioned and was quickly hired. His role as the adventurous
and romantic Duke Lavery was the first time he had dialogue. He won
the Soap Opera Digest ``Soapy Award'' as 1987's best male newcomer
of the year.
   Buchanan has been nominated for this year's awards as outstanding
hero. The Soapies will be presented Jan. 14 and will be televised on
NBC on Jan. 16.
   Buchanan was interviewed in his Hollywood apartment, where he was
recuperating from minor surgery. In the meantime, ``General
Hospital'' suspended production for two weeks to move from the
Sunset-Gower Studios to a new sound stage at the ABC Studios.
   Buchanan joined the show after the Luke and Laura episodes. Luke
Spencer (Anthony Geary) and Laura Baldwin (Genie Francis) were
dubbed the Rhett Butler and Scarlett O'Hara of the soaps. Both left
the show not long after their much-ballyhooed wedding raised the
show's audience to record levels. The ratings have slipped since
then, but ``General Hospital'' generally trades first or second
place with CBS' ``The Young and the Restless.'' In the most recent
ratings period it was first.
   Buchanan was cast because ``General Hospital'' needed a new hero
with a shady past and a hint of menace.
   ``I had my own wedding to Finola Hughes (playing Anna Devane),''
he said. ``I was wearing kilts from the McLean clan, since my
grandmother was a McLean. Pictures of the wedding were sent around
the world and one ran in color in a newspaper in Scotland. One of my
brothers called and said, `I see you married John Travolta's
girlfriend.' She had been with him in `Staying Alive.' I had to
explain to him that I was just doing a TV show.''
   Duke Lavery began as a shady nightclub owner. ``I think every
picture in the 1940s with Joan Crawford had a shady nightclub
owner,'' he said. ``Then he fell in love and tried to clean up his
act. But he wasn't clever enough to completely cover his tracks.
   ``He still runs the club but sometimes I forget that. On a soap
you can go for months on end without ever having to go to work.''
   Buchanan has also been appearing as himself on ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show.''
