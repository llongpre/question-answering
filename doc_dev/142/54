   Polish authorities on Friday warned
organizers of an unsanctioned ceremony to mark the 45th anniversary
of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto Uprising that the gathering would be
considered illegal, an organizer said.
   The warning came on the second day of a weeklong official
anniversary to honor the victims of the Nazi Holocaust during World
War II. It is the largest such event ever organized in Poland.
   On Friday, meanwhile, a Polish scholar told a scientific
conference that she is ashamed of anti-Semitic behavior in Poland
in 1968 and asked why more Polish officials, including some
conference organizers, have not come forward to accept
responsibility.
   About 4,500 people from around the world, including 2,000 from
Israel including Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Itzhak Navon, have
come to Poland for the Ghetto Uprising Anniversary, honoring the
fighters who resisted the final Nazi onslaught against the ghetto
for three weeks in April and May of 1943.
   In addition to the official observances, a group of 46
intellectuals and opposition activists has called for an unofficial
ceremony Sunday in front of the Warsaw Ghetto Fighters' Monument
and in the old Jewish Cemetery.
   The group is led by Marek Edelman, a longtime opposition
activist who is the last surviving commander of the uprising
remaining in Poland. Edelman says he is boycotting the official
observances because he considers them a cynical attempt by the
government to win favor in the West.
   Jacek Kuron, an organizer of the unsanctioned ceremony and an
adviser to the outlawed trade union Solidarity, said he was taken
to a Warsaw prosecutor's office for the warning talk by
plainclothed police.
   ``I was told that the event which I am co-organizing on Sunday .
.. is illegal ... so the authorities cannot assure protection and
the (organizing) committee will be morally and legally responsible
for any possible provocations which might take place,'' Kuron said.
   Kuron said the committee intends to proceed with the observances
anyway, including a wreath-laying ceremony at the Ghetto Fighters'
Monument and the dedication of a memorial in the Jewish Cemetery to
two Polish-Jewish socialists executed by the Soviet Union during
World War II.
   The alternative observances have come under heavy attack in the
official media, which has charged the organizers with being
anti-Soviet ``hyenas'' trying to take advantage of the anniversary
to call attention to themselves.
   Meanwhile, on the second day of a two-day historical and
scientific conference on the struggle of Jews and Poles under the
Nazi occupation, Irena Maciejewska drew applause at the conference
when she referred to the politically inspired anti-Semitic purge
that took place in Poland in 1968.
   Mrs. Maciejewska, who was delivering a paper on the Warsaw
Ghetto Uprising in literature, said that when she cooperates with
one official institution co-sponsoring the conference, the Jewish
Historical Institute, she finds herself ``in the company of people
who injured the good name of Poland in 1968.''
   To applause from the audience of several hundred people, she
added: ``As a university person I painfully remember that time and
as a Pole I should be ashamed of it.''
   The Polish United Workers (Communist) Party, in a newspaper
article last month, said anti-Semitism played a role in 1968 in
political purges that caused thousands of Jews to lose jobs in
government, journalism, the army and academia.
   Opposition activists criticized the statement as being too mild
and for not identifying individuals involved, some of whom they
charged still hold prominent positions in Poland.
