   Rustlers armed with machetes and rifles
raided nomad camps at dawn and killed 192 people and injured 50 in
a remote part of northwestern Kenya, the government said Sunday.
   The rustlers stole about 3,500 cattle, sheep, goats and donkeys,
officials said. Forty of the 50 rustlers were captured and killed
and about 3,000 animals were recovered.
   The sky over the massacre scene was black with vultures. Hyenas
and other wild animals ravaged the bodies of the victims, said the
Sunday Nation, an independent newspaper.

   Recent protests by blacks at predominantly white universities
differed in their immediate causes, but academic observers say the
incidents reflect increasing tensions.
   ``There is such a rawness to race relations on campus now,''
Troy Duster, a professor of sociology at the University of
California at Berkeley, said last week.
   ``A lot of black students are feeling besieged and beleaguered.
They feel that their fellow students and professors wonder why they
are there in the first place,'' he said.

   The Democratic presidential candidates are
spending as much as $1,000 per second to reach New York television
viewers _ and hoping their messages aren't buried by local coverage
of gaffes and controversies.
   The richest trove of voters is in New York City. But that's also
where the TV prices are the highest, the media outlets are the most
plentiful and rambunctious, and the background noise often explodes
into the foreground.
   Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the front-runner, is trying
to communicate competence and experience with his television
advertisements. Jesse Jackson makes a populist appeal to
minorities, union members and farmers, while Tennessee Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. takes tough lines on trade and drugs.

   The ``Little America'' colony was shaken by
the bloody terrorist attack on the USO club here, but the U.S. Navy
says its 10,000-strong community in Naples won't be driven away.
   The car bombing that killed four Italians and one American
servicewoman was the first known terrorist act against the U.S.
Navy in this southern port city that serves as center for 6th Fleet
operations in the Mediterranean.
   The Thursday night blast also injured 17 people, including four
American sailors. Two Islamic groups claimed responsibility.

   John Demjanjuk, who has spent the past 11 years
fighting charges he was the notorious Nazi death camp guard ``Ivan
the Terrible,'' faces a verdict Monday in his 14-month-long court
battle in Israel.
   The three-judge panel's 450-page judgment is based on more than
15,000 pages of emotionally charged testimony from Holocaust
survivors, documents experts and the suspect himself.
   Holocaust mastermind Adolf Eichmann, the only other Nazi war
criminal to be tried in Israel, was convicted and hanged in 1962.
Unlike Eichmann, Demjanjuk has insisted he is an innocent victim of
mistaken identity.

   The timing of the Iran-Contra criminal trial
of Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter could play a major role
in determining public reaction to a pardon by President Reagan,
experts say.
   However, the experts disagree whether a pretrial or post-trial
pardon _ if Reagan should decide to take that course _ would be
more acceptable to Americans.
   Some of the university professors and senators interviewed by
The Associated Press said pardons before trial would be more
acceptable. This way, the prosecution would not get a chance to
bring out potentially damaging evidence.

   The Senate is talking seriously about putting
a padlock on the revolving door through which government officials
step into high-paying lobbying jobs, one of Washington's best-known
fringe benefits.
   Two top White House aides, Michael K. Deaver and Lyn Nofziger,
walked through that door, only to run afoul of current strictures
against influence peddling. Deaver was convicted of lying about his
activities; Nofziger was convicted of lobbying former colleagues
too soon after he quit.
   Countless generals and colonels have retired from the military
and taken their inside knowledge and Pentagon phone books to new
jobs with defense contractors. Political appointees and career
bureaucrats, similarly, can be regulators one day and employees of
the regulated the next. Several key members of Congress have quit
in recent years to join prestigious Washington law firms or head
trade associations _ thence returning to the Capitol Hill as
lobbyists to trade on their friendships.

   A murder trial that had spectators lining
up an hour early to get seats ended with a recommended death
sentence for a man charged with killing seven relatives, but
residents still don't understand why the crimes were committed.
   ``I'm happy it's all over, so we can start forgetting,'' said
Frank Dugan, an elderly neighbor of some of the victims.
   ``I think we can go on with our lives now,'' said Darlene
Beisiegel after watching jurors find James E. Schnick guilty of
first-degree murder in connection with a shooting spree that killed
Mrs. Beisiegel's oldest daughter, her four grandsons and two others.

   Patriot's Day, which commemorates the start of the
Revolutionary War in these parts, has become an occasion of much
spectacle, including the Boston Marathon and a re-enactment of a
much earlier race: Paul Revere's ride.
   The living Paul Revere, great-great-great-grandson of the
silversmith, has a different plan for Monday's state holiday:
``Goof off.''
   The man wearing tricorn, cloak and riding boots and riding the
horse will be 72-year-old Harold Snow of Wellesley, a brigadier
general in the Massachusetts National Lancers. The ceremonial
militia founded in 1836 has been re-enacting the ride Paul Revere
took from Boston the night of April 18, 1775, for decades, more or
less factually.

   Domestic crude oil production in the 1990s
should be higher than previously expected and demand for natural
gas will be markedly higher, according to the Energy Department's
annual forecast.
   The department's Energy Information Administration said oil
prices will be slower to rise in the decade than it projected in
last year's forecast, and natural gas prices will be much lower.
   The import share of U.S. petroleum consumption won't be much
different at the end of the century from what was predicted last
year, EIA said.

   The Woonasquatucket, Moshassuck and
Providence rivers, long buried beneath railroad yards, a post
office and the world's widest bridge, are being exhumed in a $40
million waterfront renewal that planners hope will give the entire
city a lift.
   The reshaping that began last week will propel Providence into
the 21st century by reviving many features of the 19th, city
officials say.
   ``We're building on our dreams of the past,'' said Mayor Joseph
R. Paolino Jr.

   Vladimir Tufeld's thoughts revolve around a very
sick woman in an American hospital thousands of miles away. But his
crippled body is stuck in a two-room apartment with a 12th-floor
view of a city he no longer wants to see.
   In late December, Tufeld's wife of 35 years, Izolda, was given
permission to leave the Soviet Union to undergo brain tumor surgery
at Johns Hopkins University hospital in Baltimore, Md.
   But according to Soviet government officials, the knowledge
Tufeld gained working in an electronics factory 15 years ago still
could threaten Soviet security. Despite appeals from members of the
U.S. Congress and governments from Britain to Australia, the
distinguished-looking 60-year-old electronics engineer had to stay
behind.
