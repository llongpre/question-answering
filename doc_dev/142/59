THE HOMICIDE glossies one can take. True Detective and its like have been
around for years, offering consistent instruction to all those commuters who
might one day take up serial killing as a hobby. But a new journal has
appeared this month. I found it tucked next to a quarterly called Murder
Most Foul, but I doubt whether it is really in that innocuous category. The
new publication is called Crime Buster, and its appearance is deeply
disturbing.
'Helping you protect yourself and your family' is what it sets out to do. A
fair enterprise, on the face of it. As we are reminded passim by the
magazine, our homes are violated by thieves at the rate of one every 26
seconds. Cars fare little better, and you can even have the mobile phone
whipped from your hand as you speak. So Crime Buster appears to be on to a
good thing. And in this first issue, it has tackled its rubric with spirit.
For a start, there are prizes. Do a crime busting crossword puzzle and you
could win a full surveillance system. Runners-up get a 'really robust
personal alarm' which even if crushed in a villain's fist will scream at 130
decibels on their behalf.
Then there are seasonal tips. Watch out if you go sunbathing in the garden:
this is a nice time for opportunist intruders. But if you go abroad for the
sun, the robbers like it even better. Your house will probably be stripped
at leisure, and gratuitously defiled to boot. Never mind: July's issue will
at least supply a guide on where you stand most chance of being mugged when
you do take that foreign holiday.
I have learned to beware of all sorts of new criminals. For example, the
quill clipper. This is the dodger who, feigning a stupefied state, lurches
at you in a crowded place with his newspaper. What you don't know is that
with a deft flick of his paper he has swiped the pen from your breast
pocket. Positively Dickensian, that move.
But it has to be said that Crime Buster does not romanticise the criminal
class. Its contributors hardly ever refer to thieves as thieves. 'Clowns' is
a favourite: I also noticed 'morons', 'scumbags' and jerks'. Car thieves
have their own nomenclature: 'twockers' generically (Taking Without Owner's
Consent), 'cats' if they specialise in car audio theft. The opening (and
only) metaphor of the magazine likens the law-abiding public to a flock of
sheep, doing nothing while wolves raid at will. Then on the back page there
is a rabid-looking hyena: one of the 'cats', perhaps, about to slaver over
your Blaupunkt.
There are photo-narratives showing how villains get away with things, or how
the law apprehends them. It is hard to say who is the more dominant presence
in the magazine: the old-hand bobby, the master locksmith, or a figure in
blurred silhouette simply referred to as 'The Insider'.
The Insider seems to have done time and knows all the wrinkles: he is prone
to making jolly ex cathedra interjections. 'If you've got it and you flaunt
it, someone will nick it]'; 'Burglars hate bolts]', and so on. He sometimes
alludes to thieves as 'the lads': though he is billed as a reformed
character, you might still want to count your spoons after having him to
lunch.
The advertisements reveal a relentless battle out there between rival
security systems. A large chunk of Crime Buster is effectively a consumer
guide, guiding you towards the ultimate infra-red detection light, trying a
jemmy on all sorts of locks.
Never has the line about the Englishman's home being his castle sounded so
true. This is a real fortress mentality. In fact, it cannot be long before
Crime Buster recommends its readers to wear a suit of chain mail when out on
the streets: already it is touting bullet- and dagger-proof vests.
This sort of flesh-creeping view of the future is dismaying enough. Equally
dismaying is the way in which these precautions become a sort of culture of
their own (one manufacturer of bars and grilles describes itself as
producing 'Poetry in Steel').
But what is most dismaying is what Crime Buster never mentions. Across 85
pages, there is not an iota of a scintilla of a suggestion that we could
bust most crime by being a more equitable society. Not a whisper. And that
is a very sad silence.
