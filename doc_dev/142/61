<LEADPARA>  YOU know how it is in the summer. The major sources of national amusement --
network television, universities and Congress -- wind down for the season. The
vox populi gets bored.;    Before you can say boo, folks are digging up
presidents.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  A FEW BONES TO PICK WITH EXHUMERS OF PRESIDENTS  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     I want to say straight out that I am not categorically opposed to digging
up presidents. In fact, I'm part of a group of guys who get together once a
year, usually right after Labor Day, and dig up Chester A. Arthur. We take him
for a golfing weekend somewhere nice and put him right back.;    Why do we do
this? Because, darn it, the man knocked himself out for this country, putting
the provisions of the Pendleton Act into effect. The least a few of us can do
is show him a good time once in a while.;    The people who dug up Zachary
Taylor are another matter. I hope they're big enough to take a little
constructive criticism, because I happen to think they're a pack of ghoulish,
profiteering, publicity mongering weasels. They should die of rabid lamprey
bites.;    Look at it from Taylor's point of view. First he gets passed over
for leadership of the invasion of Mexico, then the Nicaraguan canal thing
doesn't work out and now this happens! Like he needed another hassle.;    The
woman responsible for digging up Taylor is Clara Rising, a 67-year-old
biographer from Holder, Fla., who claims Taylor was poisoned with arsenic by
his political enemies, contrary to the standard historical account that he
died in a knife fight with Harriet Beecher Stowe.;    Another theory holds
that Taylor died from eating cherries and drinking milk, a cause of death so
common in early America that George Washington, as a boy, saved his family's
life by toppling a cherry tree onto a milkman.;    Rising believes that, had
Taylor lived and implemented his vision, U.S. history might have been very
different.;    In all probability, the Civil War would have been about facial
hair; Coney Island would have been granted statehood; Edith Wharton would have
been a general in the Russo-Japanese War; the national pastime would be a
complicated sport involving tube socks and barrel staves; Arizona would be a
democracy; and Billy Joel would have been born a woman.;    Today, there
probably would be a big Zachary Taylor Memorial in Washington where the one
for Lincoln now stands, and we would get his birthday off. It's Nov. 24, very
close to Thanksgiving, raising the possibility of a four-day weekend.;   
Still, none of that actually happened, so the only thing that will come out of
this pitiful sham is that the World Book encyclopedia will have to add another
entry to its chart of "Important Dates in Taylor's Life.";    (check) 1847
Defeated Santa Ana in Battle of Buena Vista.;    (check) 1848 Elected
President of the United States.;    (check) 1850 Died in the White House.;   
(check) 1991 Dug up by Florida senior citizen.;    The doctors who inspected
his remains announced that they were "not in very good condition." He has to
put up with that? Bob Dylan's not in very good condition either, and he
doesn't have the excuse of having been dead for 140 years.;    Of course, with
all the attention in the press, with all the hare-brained jerks writing
pointless newspaper columns about this travesty, various other hyenas are now
pressing to dig up sundry presidents.;    (check) A group in Ohio has
petitioned for the right to dig up William Howard Taft because he is believed
to have someone else's car keys.;    (check) A scholar at the University of
Wisconsin is seeking to exhume Grover Cleveland to investigate the
long-standing rumor that he was actually Elizabeth Barrett Browning.;   
(check) A research committee in Keene, N.H., was pursuing a plan to dig up the
skeleton of Franklin Pierce until they learned it was currently owned by
Michael Jackson.;    (check) And, in what most pundits feel is a bit of
"testing the waters" for another run in 1992, U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt,
D-Available, has courageously agreed to be buried and subsequently dug up on
the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  </TEXT>
