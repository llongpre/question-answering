   Johnny Carson is the No. 1 star of
television's first 50 years and the undisputed ``top gun'' of talk
shows, according to People magazine.
   Trailing Carson in the opinion of the magazine's editorial staff
were Lucille Ball, Jackie Gleason, Walter Cronkite and Sid Caesar.
   The magazine will publish the list in next week's edition
celebrating a half century of television.
   The magazine echoed what ratings have shown over the decades,
calling Carson the ``champion of chatter,'' an incomparable
monologue artist and the ``night watchman of the global village.''
   In his 26 years as host of ``The Tonight Show,'' the magazine
said Carson has interviewed more than 20,000 guests and told more
than 700,000 jokes before a weekly audience of about 75 million
people.

   Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was ``like a hungry
vulture'' when the subject of money came up at the funeral of her
second husband, Aristotle Onassis, according to a new book that
quoted the late Christina Onassis.
   ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' an unauthorized biography written by
C. David Heymann, details the former first lady's spending sprees
and said money was discussed at Onassis' funeral in 1975. The book
is being serialized in the weekly Star, a supermarket tabloid.
   Mrs. Onassis' brother-in-law, Sen. Edward Kennedy, rode in the
funeral limousine with her and Christina Onassis, Aristotle's
daughter.
   Christina, who has since died, told Heymann that Kennedy turned
to her and said, ``Now, it's time to take care of Jackie,'' the
Star reported in its Monday edition.
   ``It seemed almost inconceivable that Ted Kennedy would choose
that moment to discuss financial matters,'' said Christina. ``But
it was Jackie's hyena-like smile that drove me from the car. She
was like a hungry vulture waiting to feast on my father's flesh.''
   The book also says Onassis plotted with photographers to publish
candid, nude photographs of his wife so she would stop complaining
about tamer shots taken by papparazzi.
   Nancy Tuckerman, spokeswoman for Mrs. Onassis, said when the
first part of the series appeared last week that the former first
lady would have no comment.

   Lucille Ball continued to recover quickly
from heart surgery earlier this week, cheered on by a flood of
flowers, phone calls and faxes.
   ``She's going to be uncomfortable for a few days, but she's
making significant progress,'' said Ron Wise, a spokesman at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. The 77-year-old, zany redhead remained
in serious condition Friday, three days after receiving a
transplanted piece of critical heart artery.
   The hospital received a ``tidal wave'' of greeting cards, and
its facsimile machine was churning out messages virtually nonstop
for the Emmy Award-winning actress, according to Wise, who
delivered hundreds to Miss Ball's husband, Gary Morton.

   Actor Tony Randall says a $100,000 gift from
Eagle Snacks Inc. isn't peanuts: he plans to use the money to turn
a rundown movie house into a home for a classical repertory group.
   ``It will take a lot of work and a lot of money, but I think
that this donation from Eagle Snacks will help stimulate the
participation we need to bring great theater back to 42nd Street,''
Randall said Friday.
   Randall said he plans to buy the theater as part of a city plan
to restore a seamy stretch of 42nd Street to a performing arts
complex. He is a spokesman for Eagle Snacks, a subsidiary of
Anheuser-Busch Co.

   Princess Beatrice of York displayed her royal
talents for crowd pleasing as she waited excitedly at an Edinburgh
dockside for her father's destroyer.
   With a little prompting from her mother, the Duchess of York,
the 8-month-old princess waved both arms and then flung her bare
legs into action Friday, wiggling in her mother's arms.
   The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, stood with her daughter
and about 20 other relatives of men serving on the HMS Edinburgh.
They walked up the gangplank after the destroyer docked to visit
the Duke of York, Prince Andrew. Later, Andrew carried a
still-waving Beatrice back down the gangplank.

   From ``Star Wars'' to ad wars: George Lucas'
special effects company has begun making commercials for the small
screen.
   Lucasfilm Ltd. announced Friday it had formed an advertising
division that will tap the expertise that went into such movies as
the ``Star Wars'' series and the fantasy ``Willow.''
   The first project currently under way in England is a series of
four spots touting Bell Atlantic, the regional telephone company,
said Peter Friedman, who is heading Lucasfilm Commercial
Productions. The advertisements will combine computer graphics,
animation and live action _ ``a technique that's never been used
before,'' Friedman said.
   The operation will use the resources of Industrial Light &amp;
Magic, the computer graphics division of Lucasfilm.

   Baseball slugger Jose Canseco, who in
February was ticketed for driving his car 120 mph in Florida, has
been charged with felony possession of a loaded semiautomatic
handgun.
   Canseco was ``totally cooperative'' when arrested Friday at the
University of California's Laurel Heights campus while returning to
his car after a medical exam, said campus police Lt. Mark Kurtz. A
passerby had noticed the weapon on the floor of Canseco's parked
Jaguar, he said.
   Canseco was released after several hours when his wife, Esther,
posted $5,000 bail. He will be arraigned in three weeks.
   Kurtz said police could find no permit on file allowing Canseco
to carry a weapon but they are continuing to investigate.
   The 24-year-old right fielder went to the Oakland Coliseum later
Friday and suited up for a game against the California Angels. He
has been sidelined with an injured left wrist.
