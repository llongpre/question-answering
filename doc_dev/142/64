Swaziland, where an older way of life exists

IT WAS mid-morning and time for decisions. Submerged up to my belly button,
I sat on an underwater stool at the bar pool, leaned back, and sucked
thoughtfully at a pink lemonade. In the middle of an African heat-wave, one
must consider one's options carefully.
Out on a raised tee not far from the pool, sunburned men in spiked shoes
were belting great drives down the first fairway of the Royal Swazi Sun
Hotel's hillside golf course. These were not the feeble and erratic efforts
of weekend duffers like me; when they swung a club over their shoulders the
competitors in the Swazi Sun Pro-Am Classic actually knew what they were
about to do.
I, on the other hand, knew what I was about not to do - trot around after
them looking for clues to improve my form. On airless greens baking in
42```C (115`F) heat, enthusiastic spectators were going down like ninepins.
There was another way, though, in which I could trot around in something
like comfort. On the far side of the golf course I had spotted the hotel
riding stable. My riding seat may be no better than my golf stance, but I
could see few more pleasant means of getting to know this corner of Africa.
Trudge about on foot in this noon-day sun and you undoubtedly deserve the
company of mad dogs. Drive around in a car and you miss much of the best the
tiny country of Swaziland has to offer - spectacular hill country and a
traditional rural way of life that has yet to catch up with the modern age.
Half-an-hour later I had swung up on to the back of a tall chestnut mare
named Vitesse and with guide Peter Emmett was setting out through the
emerald fields of the fertile Ezulwini valley.
It may be the special quality of light one finds on the high plateau all
over southern Africa, or it may be that factory smokestacks are few and far
between in Swaziland. Either way, everything seemed bright and highly
coloured on this cross-country hack through village, field and bush. The sky
above was a fierce hard blue, the hills that rose all around a lush green,
the dirt road along which Vitesse walked an unabashed red. In this world the
vivid yellow butterflies that flitted along seemed only normal.
The Ezulwini valley lies only a 20-minute drive from the Swazi capital,
Mbabane, in the most developed part of the country. Nonetheless it lives in
a simpler, less complex age than our own. Leave the confines of the luxury
hotels scattered along its length and suddenly, surprisingly, life itself,
like the colours here, is reduced to its basic elements.
As very few African countries are these days, Swaziland remains
overwhelmingly agricultural and its people rural.
Fording the muddy brown water of a stream, we passed women washing piles of
laundry. Upstream, small naked boys splashed through the water like shiny
brown seals. We overtook barefooted girls padding home with old kerosene
tins full of water balanced on their heads. Beside tin-roofed houses that
had neither running water nor electricity we saw mothers weeding their maize
fields, newborn babies tied to their backs with shawls. Old men wrapped in
the traditional garb of red cloth sat under shady trees by the road drinking
beer. And in the wide rolling pastureland where we let the horses canter,
cowherds with slingshots stood guard while snowy white tick birds rode the
backs of their grazing charges.
Not surprisingly, Peter Emmett has fallen in love with this country. Nor is
he alone - more than 10,000 white residents enjoy the pace of life here.
Like him, many are South African escapees from a life of stress and racial
tension. Some years ago, inducted into a crack military counter-insurgency
unit, Peter found himself using dogs and horses to chase guerrilla fighters
through the bush of pre-independence Namibia. Today he is much happier in
his capacity as stable owner, competition rider and captain of the Swaziland
polocross team.
While half Swaziland's expatriates are British, its economy is wholly
dominated by the modern, high-tech neighbour that borders it on three sides;
from where we were riding we could see the sugar cane fields and timber
stands in which South African expertise and investment plays such a role.
All the more surprising, then, is Swaziland's striking retention of tribal
customs and a traditional, African way of life. Even witchcraft continues to
play an important role. Following, for example, a media Aids campaign in
which they were admonished to 'wear condoms at all times,' many Swazis took
to hanging unrolled condoms from their belts in the belief they had magic
power to ward off infection.
But the greatest power in the land is vested in one man. Riding up the sides
of the valley to a rocky crest, we climbed high enough to overlook the Royal
Kraal, or enclosure, of King Mswati III. In the kingdom of Swaziland this,
rather than any boardroom or government ministry, is the real seat of rule.
Mswati is very young and inexperienced, but here, advised by tribal elders,
he rules by royal decree. His great wealth is judged not by his bank account
but rather by the fact he is the largest cattle owner in the country - in
Swaziland cattle are so valued as marks of status that few owners are
willing to part with them and the country cannot fill its lucrative EC
export quota.
Mswati may be British-educated, but does not keep British habits. Already he
has seven wives, a niggling number compared to the five dozen his father
had. How traditional does the king remain on a continent that is rapidly
changing? When he recently convened national leaders and foreign diplomats
to announce gradual changes towards more democratic rule, he had them sit
before him on the grass in the Royal Cattle Byre.
On our ride I had seen plenty of cattle, goats, dogs and other domestic
animals, but later that day I made a dramatic switch to their wild cousins.
In the Mlilwane Wildlife Sanctuary, a reserve just minutes up the valley, I
exchanged Vitesse for a dun-coloured gelding named Skukuza, and put myself
in the capable hands of Innocent and High Noon, Innocent being a park guide
and High Noon his horse.
Few experiences can match riding along at close quarters beside a thundering
herd of wildebeest or high-bounding impala. In the softer, kinder sun of
late afternoon, Innocent and I trotted off across rolling plains knee-high
in feathery grass, along deep creeks thick with tropical vegetation, and
through fragrant pine forests where leopards find refuge.
There were animals everywhere, giraffe feeding on the trees, wart hog
rooting through the underbrush, hippo wallowing in muddy ponds, impala
dozing in the shade. For some reason, wild animals pay little attention to
cars; with horses, though, there is a direct and gratifying interaction. The
herds sniff the air, twitch their ears, stamp the ground nervously, and then
begin to run.
By sunset I felt I had all of Africa to myself. Hills and mountains glowed
mauve. The plain before me was dotted with grazing zebra, the air filled
with the smell of horse sweat and the cooler scents of coming night. Not far
away at a poolside bar, exhausted men in peaked caps were settling down to
an evening of tall tales. Soon I would be joining them. But talk of mighty
blows and escape from deadly sand traps would no longer bring out the
embarrased duffer in me. Let them set out through the African heat in
deranged pursuit of that little white ball. I had my own, more pleasant
pursuits, on four legs rather than two.
