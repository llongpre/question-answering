<LEADPARA>  SOMETIMES they do come back. But in this case, they shouldn't.;    Tim
Matheson and Brooke Adams star tonight in yet another ghost story about dead
creeps returning to life in "Stephen King's 'Sometimes They Come Back.' "
(Sometimes, if they sell enough books, like Judith Krantz or Danielle Steel,
authors get their names in the movie title, too.)  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  (box) STEPHEN KING'S 'SOMETIMES THEY COME BACK'
9 tonight, Chs. 5, 10, 46  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     In this adaptation by Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal (no relation to
yours truly) of a King short story, Matheson plays the grown-up version of a
boy whose older brother was beaten up and knifed to death while he watched. It
all happened in a train tunnel, and the hoodlums who killed the boy were then
killed, when a train came through and smashed into their car.;    The younger
boy escaped, but more than 25 years later, the incident still haunts him.;   
So what does he do? He gets a job at the local high school and moves his wife
and son back to the small town where the tragedy occurred.;    "If I had known
the horror I was facing," Matheson's character says in the voice-over
narration, "I would have taken Sally and Scott (his wife and son) in my arms,
like my parents took me, and run from this town forever.";    But, of course,
if he did that, there'd be no movie.;    As if we might miss the message, one
of his history students asks later, "Does it have to be the same story
repeated over again? Can't we change things?";    Matheson has come back to
change things, only he doesn't know it yet. That starts to happen when kids
who look and act just like the creeps who killed his brother show up in his
class.;    If he doesn't get rid of them, we'd like to. These louses in
leather jackets have the most annoying hyena laughs.;    Before they come
after Matheson and his family, they start bumping off his students, forcing
them off the road with their fire-spitting hot rod, stringing them up in an
abandoned barn.;    Nobody, of course, believes Matheson when he begins to
figure out what's going on, which is why it is left to him to deal with the
hoods in his own way at the movie's close.;    None of it's very scary because
nothing here seems real; nothing seems grounded in anything more than the
reality of dreams.;    King fans, of which there are zillions, may like this
yarn about ghosts and loyalty to the past, but I was bored waiting for the
inevitable conclusion. This seems like a piece of every other Stephen King
story rolled into one.;    I'm not sure why horror flicks seem to be making a
comeback on television (witness "The Haunted" and this on consecutive nights),
but maybe it's because the tube has chewed up every other genre.;    If
"Sometimes They Come Back," with its ghoulish faces and hideous laughter, is
the best they can do, I think this genre is about done, too.;    LOCAL EMMY
NOMINATIONS -- Nominations for this year's local Emmys have been announced,
and as usual KPIX (Ch. 5) and KRON (Ch. 4), which send in the most entries,
dominate.;    KPIX, led by Wendy Tokuda's five nominations, received 40, while
KRON, whose Mark Jones received three nominations, got 25. Together, the two
stations raked in nearly half the 134 nominations in 38 categories made by the
Northern California chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts &amp;
Sciences.;    KQED (Ch. 9) got 16 nominations and KGO (Ch. 7) 15, while 13
other stations divided up the rest. The awards will be handed out at the
Paramount Theater in Oakland on June 22.;    Two nominations were made
posthumously to KGO talents who died last year: Paul Wynne for his "Paul
Wynne's Journal" series and Russ Coughlan for "The Mystery of Port Chicago"
documentary.;    HERE TODAY, GONE TOMORROW -- Looks as if Jesse Jackson won't
be making a second season of his eponymous syndicated series, carried locally
by KRON.;    Talks are apparently under way with Warner Bros. Domestic
Television Distribution, which syndicates the show for Time Warner, to produce
some Jackson specials after the current production schedule of 52 shows ends
in September. . . .;    Meanwhile, at ABC, "My Life and Times" has been
dropped from the lineup on Wednesdays at 9:30, and "Anything but Love" is back
in that slot, at least for a while.;    "My Life" was yanked after only two
episodes and mediocre ratings, while on-again, off-again "Anything" returns
for its final two new shows this week and next. If the numbers are good, it
might be back in the fall, but we probably won't know until the schedule is
announced later this month.;    The network says that the five unseen episodes
of "My Life" will show up some time later, but it's a sure bet that Ron
Koslow's latest effort to tug at our heartstrings won't be back in the fall.; 
  The same folks still have not announced air dates for the last seven
episodes of the wonderful "China Beach," which disappeared early this year.
Officially on hiatus, it certainly won't be back next season, but it would be
nice if ABC lets fans see the final episodes that have already been made.  </TEXT>
