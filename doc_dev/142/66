THE GREAT SAFARI: THE LIVES OF GEORGE AND JOY ADAMSON by Adrian House
Harvill Pounds 20, 465 pages
HIGH IN the bestseller lists of the 1960s and '70s was a trio of
artlessly-told, beautifully-illustrated books about a lion cub who was
adopted by a Kenyan couple, reared, and then returned to the bush. Born
Free, Living Free and Forever Free sold in their millions; the image of the
happy pair was probably most effectively conveyed by the film of Born Free,
in which Joy and George Adamson were played - wonderfully - by a thespian
couple, Virginia McKenna and Bill Travers. Virginia McKenna in those days
was the archetypal girl-next-door, and Bill was an appropriately beefy and
amiable partner. The casting was brilliantly successful - and grotesquely
misleading.
The fact is that Joy Adamson was a monster, George was a wretched,
long-suffering spouse, usually living apart from her, and the marriage had
been made in hell. In their different ways, their lives were rescued by the
animals of East Africa.
Adrian House was their London editor, and has at last written the history of
the Adamsons. It is one of those biographies which, regrettably, feels
obliged to cram in everything the author knows, from the Scramble for Africa
to the history of Mau Mau; it is not well written; but the story comes
through, and has a horrifying compulsion. For anyone who remembers the books
or the films, this is a fascinating read.
The Adamsons represented two opposite faces of White Kenya. George was a
classic example of the dedicated game warden, always happiest in the
ferocious terrain of the Northern Frontier District, where the Somalis
persist in their southern migration (they would eventually murder him). Joy,
originally 'Fifi', was a neurotic Austrian cosmopolitan with two husbands
behind her, a Nazi step-father, broken English, pretensions to culture, a
passion for the safari, a record of dissatisfied promiscuity, and a chronic
inability to be civil to her servants (who would eventually murder her).
Mr House is on George's side, but his portrait of the appalling Joy has the
stink of truth. Heaven knows why George put up with her for 35 years; Mr
House concludes, in effect, that he was a gent. She married him in a grand
and mutual passion, went off him sexually within a fortnight, developed a
renewed craving for her (equally long-suffering) Swiss ex-husband, and - as
all Kenya knew - made George's life miserable for much of the time. She even
refused him a share of the fortune she made from the books, although his
role in the dramas of Elsa and her cubs was fundamental. He was only saved
from penury by the films Bill Travers made with him later, and the spin-off
books under his own name in the 1980s.
Nothing in this domestic tragedy would be a particularly unusual story in
Kenya if it were not for the lions. Why did Joy's first book have such an
extraordinary impact? The answer, at its simplest, is not hard to
understand. In Peter Scott's words, 'as an example of near perfect
relationships between man and animal, it is unique'. Plenty of game wardens
had raised lion cubs, but Elsa reached maturity, was successfully released
into the wild, and then retained her affection for the human 'parents' even
after she had mated and borne cubs.
So, for many people, this apparently ordinary story was unexpectedly moving
because it seemed to offer them a bridge between man and the natural world
at a time when - we can now see - we were beginning obscurely to worry about
this gap. (Other books were having a similar effect at the time: see, for
instance, the otters and Gavin Maxwell, whose biography also appears this
month). At a deeper level of interpretation - and Mr House only flirts with
this point but he is at least aware of it - it would be necessary to go into
the legendary role of the lion in the life of man throughout the ages.
There was a debate about the value of the Adamsons' work. They were not
scientists, so what was the significance of their anthropomorphic
observations? After all, lions were never an endangered species, so why all
the fuss? And wasn't it dangerous to return these lions to the bush, and in
particular to a national park? Were the Adamsons producing man-eaters? (In
later years George was to be directly and painfully confronted by this
point.)
The conclusion today seems to be that the Adamsons' observations added
something to the sum of human knowledge and offered the conservationists
various lines for future inquiry. More important, I suspect, is the very
simple point that the Adamsons transformed public opinion in that they did
more than anyone to make lions accessible, wonderful, majestic, loveable, to
all of us.
After Elsa, Joy reared a cheetah and also raised leopard cubs. She had a big
affair with Billy Collins, her publisher, described here in discrete detail.
She saw less and less of George. She wounded her hand and lost her separate
career as an extremely distinguished artist of Kenya's flora and
anthropology. She was killed in 1980.
George had retreated to a remote camp on his beloved Tana River and lived to
a hearty old age, rearing lion cubs and entertaining British soldiers and
uninhibited young ladies. Then, in 1989, the Somalis came and killed him. He
was, in Adrian House's affectionate portrait, rather a hero.
