   Clint Eastwood opened the competition at
the Cannes Film Festival with a screening of his film based on the
making of John Huston's Bogart-Hepburn classic, ``The African
Queen.''
   Eastwood's film, ``White Hunter, Black Heart,'' is one of 19
competing for the coveted Golden Palm award at the 43rd annual
festival.
   The American actor, known for his tough-guy acting roles, won
the festival's Special Grand Prize for Sound in 1988 with his film
``Bird,'' about jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker.
   He both directed and starred in this latest film, based on
Huston's 1952 classic matching of Humphrey Bogart and Katharine
Hepburn. The film was screened Friday to open formal competition.
   In the film, Jeff Fahey plays ``African Queen'' writer Peter
Viertel and Marisa Berenson plays the Hepburn character.
   The Cannes festival opened Thursday night with a gala ceremony
and a salute to Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, the Golden Palm
winner of 1980 for ``Kagemusha.'' His new film, ``Dreams,'' is not
competing for the prize but was shown as part of the Thursday
tribute.
   The crowd Thursday included director Bernardo Bertolucci,
president of this year's jury, past Cannes prize-winners and other
jury members, including actress Anjelica Huston _ John Huston's
daughter.
   Eastwood's offering this year, based on Viertel's novel of the
same name, shows the late director Huston to be selfish and
arrogant, but a charming man.
   The Huston character, named John Wilson, is obsessed with
killing animals. He neglects his cast, crew and production while he
searches the bush for an elephant to kill.
   ``This is not a picture about the making of a movie,'' Eastwood
told a news conference. ``It's about an obsession for killing an
elephant and a conflict between one man who doesn't like killing a
wild animal and the other man obsessed with killing.
   Eastwood never met the charismatic Huston but said he studied
many of the director's films and interviews.
   ``I tried to capture his energy, strength and enthusiasm about
life,'' said Eastwood.
   Viertel said he wrote the novel ``White Hunter, Black Heart'' as
a kind of therapy after facing Huston's egomania and demands in
Africa. In the movie Viertel (called ``Verrill'') is the writer who
hates killing wild animals.
   ``I loved John, but in this instance, he'd let his heart get
away from him,'' said Viertel. ``He felt he had to prove
something.''
   The film shows Huston not only as an egomaniac, but also as a
champion of minorities. He fights with his glamorous girlfriend who
makes slurs against Jews and with a hotel owner in Africa who
insults his black employees.
