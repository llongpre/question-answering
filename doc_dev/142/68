<LEADPARA>  FOR THE lawyers and investment bankers who made The Greed Decade possible, the
'90s must feel like a bitter diet of humiliations. Unemployment cruelly stalks
the corner offices. BMWs have been repossessed. Once-proud firms now scrap
like rabid hyenas for any shred of stray business tossed their way.;    So
America's brightest young lawyers, traders and financiers are being forced to
abandon their cherished Master of the Universe dreams. No deals for them. Why,
there aren't even enough decent bankruptcies to go around. What a tragic waste
of superbly trained human capital!  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     If people really cared about America's global competitiveness in legal and
financial services, they wouldn't let this happen. No sirree, they'd welcome
an opportunity to put those agile minds to work creating a marketplace where
America would have unquestioned pre-eminence. They'd quickly grasp the
potential of a market that fused law and finance. Just as we now have vibrant
global markets in pork bellies, soybeans and corporate equities, we should
establish a marketplace in lawsuits.;    America's lawyers would attract new
clients and have a rich vein of new capital to mine. The investment bankers
could make fortunes underwriting lawsuits as well as selling options and
futures on them. These sagging service sectors would be revitalized without a
penny of government subsidy. That's more than Detroit, Silicon Valley or the
Farm Belt can claim.;    It's all very simple. Let's say someone has a
malpractice claim against a doctor. Typically, a law firm takes that case on a
contingency basis -- that is, the firm risks representing the client in
exchange for a third of any award or settlement. If the case is lost, the
lawyers get nothing.;    In the market scenario, however, the law firm and its
client could treat the lawsuit like a stock offering and invite investors to
help defray costs in exchange for a piece of the action. Let's call these
stocks SUITS -- for Securitized Units of Investment in Trial Situations. The
firm would register its SUITS with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
issue a prospectus with details of the case. For example, for successfully
argued malpractice cases, the law firm typically receives jury awards of $3.5
million. Based on such information, the case would be "taken public" and
people could buy and trade their SUITS as the case progressed. The ruling
against the plaintiff's expert witness dropped the SUIT 50 cents to $2.75.;   
Of course, $3.5 million is small potatoes. There's bound to be a more
lucrative market in corporate lawsuits where the General Electrics, Fujitsus
and Exxons are battling over hundreds of millions of dollars. The potential
awards are so large that you might even have institutional investors like the
pension funds buying in. With triple damages in some instances, we could make
a killing. This litigation could spawn legal analysts to advise investors when
it is best to buy, sell or hold SUITS.;    You could have public offering or
private placement SUITS. The Chicago exchanges might set up a market in SUITS
options and futures. Sell options on IBM stock; now sell options on IBM
litigation. Cleverer investment banks might collaborate with attorneys to
create the Salomon Brothers/Sullivan &amp; Cromwell or the Morgan Stanley/Cravath,
Swaine Litigation Index Funds -- like the Dow Jones industrial averages for
stocks. There could be baskets of litigation for investors to focus on
antitrust cases, intellectual property lawsuits or employee discrimination
suits.;    There are ethical concerns and rules against "barratry" -- the
fomenting of frivolous suits -- but lawyers and investment bankers have been
known to overcome ethical qualms. Here's a vehicle that lets litigants raise
capital and manage legal costs more efficiently. There is no inherent
technical reason SUITS couldn't be offered and traded like any other properly
registered financial instrument.;    "There has been private investment in a
few cases," says Joseph W. Bartlett, a partner at Mayer, Brown &amp; Platt. "It's
very uncommon because cases tend to be hard to value.";    On the other hand,
he notes, "Some of the investors putting money into biotech companies these
days are investing in lawsuits because pending litigation is the biggest asset
some of these firms have.";    Indeed, Bartlett says, "Patent lawsuits are
where the real dollars are now.";    Who knows? Maybe the real growth market
will be selling shares in shareholder suits. Or selling shares in litigation
of failed shareholder suits. It doesn't matter; the possibilities and
permutations are endless. That's why creating a marketplace in lawsuits is
bound to invigorate the legal and investment banking professions.;    As
business and litigation go global, the NYSE -- the New York SUITS Exchange --
would be the world capital of this exciting new merger of legal and financial
expertise. Asia and Europe would rediscover the fearsome prowess of America's
high-value-added service sector.;    Sure, some will scoff and claim these new
financial instruments will undermine U.S. competitiveness. They'll say SUITS
get in the way of creating real value in the marketplace. They'll complain
it's all just "paper entrepreneurialism" -- but isn't that what they said
about the junk bond?  </TEXT>
