Only two sorts of sports reporting really impress me. The first comes from
the committed expert, steeped in the subject and communicating passion and
depth of knowledge to his audience. The prose may be lumpy and the metaphor
ugly, but almost every word contributes to the story behind the story.
Read, say, Captain Mark Phillips' regular columns on eventing and you will
quickly appreciate two things: that the six-time Badminton winner is more
comfortable in a saddle than at a keyboard, and that what he doesn't know
about horse trials isn't worth knowing.
The second type of reporting is rarer. It flows from naturally gifted
writers who have an intuitive affinity for the tides and eddies of specific
sports. Glance at Norman Mailer's pieces on American boxing in the 1960s, or
the work of the black Marxist historian C L R James on West Indian cricket,
and the quality is obvious.
Last week I inadvertently opened a Christmas present a day or two early and
made a stunning discovery. It was a collection of sports pieces by Alistair
Cooke, scarcely known in this field of endeavour. But its quality puts him
up there with Mailer or James.
For those who have been living on Mars, Cooke's weekly Letter from America
has been broadcast by BBC radio since 1945. Its elegant phrases, honeyed
delivery and folksy insights reach Britain and 51 other countries. I have no
audience figures but suspect that, like the King James Bible, Letter from
America is nowadays revered but seldom listened to.
Perhaps Cooke should have stayed on the back pages. For 25 years he was also
a newspaperman covering US sport, among other things, for The Times and then
The Guardian. Here is Cooke describing the savagery of the 1951 fight at
Madison Square Garden when Sugar Ray Robinson regained the world
middleweight championship from Randolph Turpin. Reading it, one should
remember that just 10 days earlier the young boxer George Flores had been
killed fighting in the same ring.
'Last night Sugar Ray Robinson, tiring to the point of panic before the
concrete insensibility of Turpin's massive flesh,' wrote Cooke, 'wrung
everything he had from a brave heart, fought from his fingertips, and at
last had Turpin helpless against the ropes, his arms by his thighs, his
stubborn body reeling back and forth like a badly beaten bull when the flags
go in.
'I have never seen a human being receive so much punishment with such dumb
bravery. For almost a whole minute Robinson crashed and shot and pounded on
him until his head sagged from one side to the other with the flopping
rhythm of a broken pendulum.'
It might be argued that violent melodrama is easy to describe. But Cooke
also had the subtlest of touches, mocking the shamefully rigged fight in
1953 that gave Rocky Marciano a two-minute knockout over his lacklustre
opponent. 'Jersey Joe Walcott sat down on the mat in Chicago last night,
cocked his head to hear the referee call a count of 10, and then got up and
went home, complaining he had been robbed. It was never quite clear in the
confusion exactly who had been robbed ..
'There is no boo like the boo of a man who has paid Dollars 50 for two
minutes of aimless shuffling. When the referee hoisted Marciano's arm and
the bell rang, all the tired trans-continental aeroplane passengers, the
preening celebrities, and the boys who had traded a week's baseball tickets
for a seat against the skyline, bared their teeth and let loose like wounded
hyenas.' In his introduction to the book, Cooke gives one to understand
that, for him, sports reporting was a light-hearted diversion from the
realities of the Cold War in the America of Eisenhower and Truman.
Cooke's world was the White House and the minutiae of international
politics. But his personal absorption in - first - fishing and then golf and
tennis, provided a perceptive view of the big events. 'I have come to feel a
deep, unspoken pity for people who have no attachment to a single sport,
almost as sorry for them as I am for teetotallers,' he writes in his
introduction.
His own passion for golf has been known to creep into more than the odd
radio epistle, but Cooke's reports from the frontline of the major
tournaments were hitherto unknown to me. In 1965 he was at Bellerive Country
Club, Missouri, covering Gary Player's play-off win over Kelvin Nagle to
take the US Open. Cooke's report centred on the intensity with which Player
scrutinised every lie 'like a laboratory technician with a blood sample'.
As a hot afternoon under the mid-western sun ground on, Cooke described the
breathless concentration shown by an extraordinarily focused Player: 'And so
into the twilight he pondered his iron shots for minutes on end, climbed
hills and knolls and stood on his head to gauge the break of the green,
lined up a 2ft putt from the pin and the apron - and back again - and picked
up every dewdrop or hint of fuzz in between. Never did hypochondria reap
such a rich reward.'
Just reading that made me hold my breath, as if I had been alongside Cooke
on the parched fairways of Bellerive. His wry humour at the expense of his
beloved golf is even more enjoyable. This is from Cooke's brief cod-history
of the game, in a passage explaining why the king tried, in 1457, to ban it:
'James did not recognise what every other Scot knew in his bones: that golf
was just what the Scottish character had been searching for, for centuries.
Namely, a method of self-torture disguised as a game ..'
The emblem on the necktie of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews -
the Vatican of golf - shows St Andrew himself bearing the saltire cross, on
which he was to be stretched before he was crucified. 'Only the Scots,'
wrote Cooke, 'would have thought of celebrating a national game with the
figure of a tortured saint.'
