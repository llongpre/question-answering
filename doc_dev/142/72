   A man who worked as a game
warden in South Africa's largest national park for 22 years has
been arrested on suspicion of killing more than two dozen
rhinoceroses and elephants, police said Wednesday.
   The National Parks Board said it was the first time in 50 years
that one of its officials had been arrested for poaching.
   Police did not identify the suspect, but said he had resigned
from his job at Kruger National Park last year. He was arrested
after the carcasses of 27 white rhinos were found near the Skukuza
campground in Kruger.
   Police said the man was believed to have been engaged in illegal
hunting from 1983 to 1988. He also was suspected in cases of
housebreaking and theft, police said.
