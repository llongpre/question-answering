<F P=106> [Interview with General Alexandr Lebed by Viktor Perushkin; </F>
place and date not given: "`Russia Would Not Survive Another 
War'"] 
  [Text] The eighth round of negotiations between 
Russia and Moldova on the withdrawal of the Russian 14th Army 
contributed no appreciable changes. The presence of the Russian 
military in the Dniester region is, as before, exasperating the 
leadership of Moldova, whereas General Lebed, commander of the 
14th Army, continues to exasperate the leadership of the 
Dniester region. There has long been talk in the republic about 
the speedy posting of the army commander to a new assignment. 
All this was discussed in an interview given to our special 
correspondent Viktor Perushkin by General Aleksandr Lebed. 
  [Perushkin] Has it not become tedious for you being a 
general 
in an out-of-the-way place? You once studied with P. Grachev, 
after all, and together with him fought in Afghanistan and 
defended democracy in August 1991. Have you not been offered a 
general's position in the "Arbat Military District?" 
  [Lebed] There never have been and never will be such offers. 
I have never stooped and have never served either general 
secretaries or the president but have served, am now serving, 
and will continue to serve the Fatherland. My current 
appointment is entirely suitable for me personally. And in 
Moscow I might not blend in with the capital's generals. None of 
this is up to me, nor am I fit for the role of entourage man. I 
am used to being myself and walking alone. 
  [Perushkin] Aleksandr Ivanovich, a truce has held in the 
Dniester region for two years now. Is such a method of conflict 
settlement possible in Abkhazia, say? 
  [Lebed] In the Dniester region, as distinct from Abkhazia, 
the conflict was not of a national coloration. Moldovans, 
Russians, Ukrainians, and Bulgarians took part in the war on 
both sides. The similarity, however, is that in both places 
people fought and continue to fight for their rights, which, on 
a wave of pure nationalism, are being flouted in the most 
loutish fashion. It is sufficient to say that the cause of the 
conflict here was the Language Act. More than 30 percent of the 
Russian-speaking population living on the territory of the 
former Moldavia had to speak Romanian. 
  [Perushkin] But today, Chisinau maintains, Moldova's policy 
has changed for the better. How far does this correspond to 
reality? 
  [Lebed] At first sight, truly, common sense would appear to 
be starting to conquer. But all is not that simple. The result 
of the war in the Dniester region (and this was a real war) was 
a deep rift between Chisinau and Tiraspol. Only time can smooth 
over it, and trust will be restored very slowly. That 
commonsensical people have entered the parliament of Moldova is 
a first step toward this. 
  [Perushkin] So Moldova has taken it. The Dniester region? 
  [Lebed] The leadership of the Dniester region has expressed 
its readiness for negotiations, but in practice nothing has 
changed. Nonetheless, the visit of V. Vasev, authorized 
representative of the Russian president, whose purpose is the 
rapprochement of the positions of Moldova and the Dniester 
region, should, I believe, produce positive results in the very 
near future. Adopting a combat posture forever is impossible. 
Unless radical measures are adopted, no good will come of this. 
  [Perushkin] The truce that set in two years ago is linked 
with your arrival. Your appearance in Abkhazia, let us suppose, 
would produce a similar result. 
  [Lebed] Let us start with the fact that the 14th Army has 
been here since 1956. I was sent here at a time when the war was 
in full swing. I lay claim to no laurels in this situation. The 
sole thing I have understood in going through Afghanistan, 
Azerbaijan, and Armenia is that in all such situations tough 
measures need to be adopted instantly. This is a guarantee that 
blood will not be shed for any length of time. You can fight for 
two years and lose five to 10 persons a day. Not many, it might 
seem, but in a year the number of those who have perished 
amounts to 3,650. And this matter can be settled once and for 
all, with a loss of 100 men, with one brutal strike. I am a 
supporter of this policy here, in the Dniester region, also, and 
I have been able to prove its soundness. But it cannot be said 
that the same tactics are suitable in just any instance, 
including in Abkhazia. It is always necessary to proceed from 
the situation, but spinelessness in policy always has severe 
repercussions. 
  [Perushkin] Judging by your approach to conflict solution, 
you are a hard man. Is this actually the case or is it a 
defensive reaction? 
  [Lebed] I derive absolutely no pleasure from being forced to 
adopt harsh measures since I am one of those officers who has 
had in their life their fill of fighting--this is as far as it 
goes. It is simply essential to settle all political 
disagreements at the negotiating table, but there are moments 
when words are left hanging in the air. It is then that the 
moment for decisive actions comes. But this does not mean that I 
am a supporter of war. The point is that our state would not 
survive a third war in one century. We have lost a substantial 
part of our gene pool as it is, and if this continues, the 
nation will perish. 
  [Perushkin] It is a poor soldier that does not dream of 
becoming a general. You have become one. What next? 
  [Lebed] This saying continues. It is a poor soldier that, 
having become a general, stops being a soldier. I will say one 
thing: Several years ago the Afghan mujahidin would not have 
dared think even of attacking the USSR, today they are preying 
on its borders. Our state has become an ailing emaciated 
elephant that all kinds of rats and hyenas have begun to bite. 
The state has always been associated with a potent army. It is 
by no means necessary to wage war, but the presence of such an 
army is a guarantee of the security of the Fatherland. And as 
long as the world has existed and continues to exist, there has 
always been and will always be respect for the strong. I 
subsequently see it as my mission, therefore, to strengthen the 
Armed Forces in the interests of our state. I will look like a 
dumb cook praising his own broth, perhaps, but the best minds 
and the best workers will be bought or destroyed unless a 
professional army is created. 
  [Perushkin] Is this the explanation for your reluctance to 
play politics? 
  [Lebed] Absolutely right. I have never set myself the goal 
of 
ascending to some political heights. But today's situation in 
the Dniester region forces me to look into all matters. I cannot 
switch the points anywhere. There is a Russian Embassy, but it 
is in Chisinau. Of course, the ambassador and the consul are 
regularly in Tiraspol, but questions arise daily, and they have 
to be tackled. 
  [Perushkin] You have not developed a relationship with the 
leadership of the Dniester region. Who does not suit whom in 
this situation? 
  [Lebed] There is total reciprocity here. Perhaps internal 
matters should not concern me, but my army, which has to live, 
is in the republic. A great deal of matters arise in this 
connection, and this is, naturally, disliked. 
  [Perushkin] When will the question of the withdrawal of the 
14th Army be decided? 
  [Lebed] The point is that when an army of one state is on 
the 
territory of another, this is always bad. Should this army be 
withdrawn? Undoubtedly! But when this army is withdrawn will 
depend on the political and economic conditions for its 
withdrawal that have been created. At this stage these 
conditions have not been created. I do not, therefore, have an 
official decision on the withdrawal of the 14th Army. 
Consequently, the army will be here a while yet.
