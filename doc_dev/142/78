   Saladino de Souza Gonzalez says he
has the perfect solution for Brazilians wanting to protect their
homes from burglars: guard lions.
   ``With a lion for a guard, the thief may enter but he won't
leave,'' said Gonzalez, a 45-year-old book wholesaler from Belo
Horizonte, Brazil's third-largest city.
   Gonzalez has raised lions for the past 10 years on his farm in
the interior. He said Brazil's soaring crime rate has helped create
a steady demand.
   ``I recommend a large backyard, the construction of a gate, and
plenty of space. Then let them roam free at night,'' Gonzalez said
in a telephone interview. Three lions guard Gonzalez's home.
   Gonzalez started with three lions smuggled from Africa and
raises a litter every three months. When the cubs are 30 days old,
he puts them up for sale for $300, using classified ads. So far, he
has sold 30 lions.
   ``They adapt remarkably well to life at home. I never have a
problem selling them,'' he said.
   Gonzalez said a baby lion needs to be fed two to three big
chickens a day, supplemented with a few cans of dog food. Adults
require four chickens and about nine pounds of meat daily, which
can run to about $250 a month.
   Keeping lions at home is legal in Brazil, said Capt. Allan
Salazar of the Forestry Police in Minas Gerais, of which Belo
Horizonte is the capital. He said non-native animals are
unprotected by law.
   ``Exotic animals can be kept at home if conditions are good. The
owner is responsible for security and the animal's actions,'' he
said.
   Gonzalez says he visits the homes of all his clients after they
buy their lions to make sure there are no problems.
   ``Lions are as loyal as dogs. In fact, I recommend getting a dog
to keep your lion company because they learn to play together,'' he
said.
   He said lions are no problem with children either, as long as
the animal is purchased ``when small, so they can get used to each
other.''
   And he says a lion-guarded home is a safe home.
   ``Thieves are smart. They always scope out their targets _ if
there's a lion on the premises they won't try robbing the house,''
he said.
   One happy customer is Ana Maria Conceicao de Oliveira, who lives
with her husband, 13-year-old daughter, and ``Mikey,'' the
20-month-old family lion, who occupies a large pen in the backyard.
   ``We bought Mikey to scare away burglars and I'm sure no thief
would enter our house. People around the neighborhood know we have
a lion so the word is out,'' she said.
   Her daughter, Raquel Christina, plays with the lion in the
backyard and feeds him a daily ration of 20 pounds of chicken
necks, lungs, hearts and kidneys.
   ``Burglars are afraid of dogs. Imagine how they would feel about
Mikey,'' she said.
   Gonzalez denies having any problems with customers, but the Rio
newspaper Jornal do Brasil reported at least one woman was unhappy
with her lion and resold it because he had ripped up her bathroom
when she gave him a bath.
   ``In practice, I learned that a lion is a lion and a dog is a
dog,'' said the woman, identified only as Maria Celia. ``A lion is
temperamental and difficult, very different from a puppy.''
