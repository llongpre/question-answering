<DESCRIPT>  TELEVISION; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  HARD-CORE news purists always have given CBS's "60 Minutes" gang a bad time
over the show's frequent "soft" interviews with show-business celebrities, but
now those show-biz interviews are beginning to look like solid gold.;   Case
in point: Tonight's two-hour CBS special, "60 Minutes: The Entertainers,"
culling some of the very best moments from all the show-biz interviews the
show has done over the past couple of decades. This is a terrifically
entertaining show, probably because the good parts of those interviews are so
good, and the bad parts were left behind in the archives.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Among the memorable moments:;   (check) Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy
faking out a startled Mike Wallace by pretending they'd decided to separate
because, as Cronyn put it, "Jess has her eye on another fellow, and I'd like
to play the field while I'm still vertical.";   (check) Lena Horne, at 64,
telling Ed Bradley she still sings earthy songs because "you can't help your
sexual nature.";   (check) Opera immortal Beverly Sills comparing herself to
"a fairly decent plumber.";   (check) Paul Simon grieving over the breakup of
his marriage to Carrie Fisher and celebrating a long overdue rapport with his
father.;   (check) Jackie Gleason explaining Ralph Kramden's true character to
Morley Safer.;   As you might expect, veteran correspondent Wallace comes off
as the bete noir of the show, asking the rudest questions. We see him bullying
Vladimir Horowitz into playing "Stars and Stripes Forever" for the first time
in 20 years, accusing Johnny Carson of being an alcoholic, ridiculing Shirley
MacLaine for her New Age ideas ("You don't have to be that unpleasant," she
tells him. "It doesn't become you") and even asking Itzhak Perlman why so many
"world class fiddle players" are Jewish. ("Our fingers are circumcised,"
Perlman retorts.);   The result is a crackling two hours that will zip by
before you know it, leaving you with a hankering for more.; 'Beyond Reality';
The USA cable network is rapidly moving into more hours of original
programming. Unfortunately, not much of it is any better than "Beyond
Reality," an oddball hybrid that premieres tonight at 9. It falls somewhere
between a weekly mystery series and a "reality" show based on screwball cover
stories from the tabloids.;   Shari Belafonte and Carl Marotte play
parapsychologists who each week investigate a different case, which the
producers claim is based on "reported incidents." In the preview episode, they
check out one of Marotte's college students, an introverted dweeb who walks
through her looking glass like Alice and into a parallel dimension where she
isn't a dweeb. This incident may have been reported somewhere, but I don't
think it was in the New York Times.;   Let me be kind and just say I found
"Beyond Reality" profoundly stupid.; 'Servants of Twilight'; Author Dean R.
Koontz is the cut-rate Stephen King, another horror novelist with some
impressive sales figures, especially in the paperback line. His great weakness
is his familiar plots. That's pretty much the main thing wrong with tonight's
Koontz adaptation, "Servants of Twilight," on the Showtime pay-TV network.;  
Based on Koontz's "Twilight," the movie owes too much to "The Omen," with its
plot about religious fanatics trying to bump off a little boy they think is
the Anti-Christ. However, once you're past the first bumpy, flashback-choked
minutes, "Servants of Twilight" delivers plenty of thrills, even with the
stale plot.;   Bruce Greenwood plays the private detective trying to protect
unwed mother Belinda Bauer and her 6-year-old son (Jarrett Lennon) from the
evil followers of Mother Grace (Grace Zabriskie) and her Church of the
Twilight. Once he's on the case, we're in for a wild and violent chase that
leaves you quite breathless by the climactic struggle between good, evil, a
leftover giant from "Twin Peaks" and an attic full of bats.;   By no means is
"Servants of Twilight" a masterwork of the genre, but thrill-seekers could do
a lot worse than this fast-paced entertainment.; 'Zebras'; "Zebras: Patterns
in the Grass," Sunday night's edition of "National Geographic Explorer" on the
TBS cable network, is a fascinating saga of the annual 300-mile migration of
zebra herds in Botswana. Here's one overwhelmingly good reason to watch: There
were 45,000 zebras making the journey in 1981, but only 7,000 were left to try
this year.;   Narrator Brian Dennehy calls the trek a "gauntlet of death."
He's not kidding. We watch as lions, hyenas, wild dog packs and even hunters
ravage the herds as they head south to feed on fertile grasslands each year.; 
 Among the unusual sights captured by famed naturalists and film makers Dereck
and Beverly Joubert: mother zebras shielding their foals from other zebras so
the newborn progeny will learn to "home in" on only their mother's distinctive
pattern of stripes; stallions and "bachelor" zebras lining up to protect foals
from wild dogs; a female zebra's sire testing a male suitor's worthiness as a
mate by fighting with him; lions and hyenas dragging down an amazing 150 foals
in just 10 terror-filled days.;   This is another powerful film in this fine
series, reminding us of the majesty of the many species now in sharp decline
all over the world.; 'Played in the USA'; This Sunday cable's The Learning
Channel (TLC) starts a new 13-week series called "Played in the USA," which
chronicles the diversity of music performed in America through the works of
independent film and video producers. The kickoff event is extra special: a
documentary on the recording of Broadway's "Company" soundtrack album, which
has been kept from public view for 20 years by a legal hassle.;   Filmed by
the acclaimed D.A. Pennebaker and Richard Leacock ("Monterey Pop," "Don't Look
Back"), the cinema verite documentary of a marathon 18-hour recording session
was tied up over music copyrights until recently settled.;   Not only does the
film show us how they record a Broadway score, but it also gives us intriguing
behind-the-scenes glimpses of composer Stephen Sondheim, legendary
producer-director Harold Prince and others at work with the show's stars,
Elaine Stritch, Dean Jones and Barbara Barrie.;   A special bonus: Look for a
rare, early sequence featuring Charles Kimbrough, now best known as anchorman
Jim Dial in "Murphy Brown."  </TEXT>
