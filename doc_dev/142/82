   Voters in half a dozen states face an eclectic mix of tax
measures Nov. 8, from a steep hike in cigarette taxes to tax cuts
reminiscent of California's decade-old Proposition 13.
   But there are signs the anti-tax fever that gripped the nation
after Californians enacted Proposition 13 in June 1978 has cooled
as inflation has eased, the economy has improved and taxpayers no
longer feel so squeezed.
   Only in South Dakota, Utah and Colorado will voters decide
issues this November that would force deep cuts in taxes.
   ``Voters are protecting what exists, but not going further. And
in some cases, it looks like the electorate is willing to approve,
more so than in the '70s or early '80s, very specific taxes for
specific purposes,'' said Patrick McGuigan, editor of the Free
Congress Initiative and Referendum Report, a monthly newsletter
published in Washington.

   The United States has agreed to pay the
Philippines $481 million annually and back a bond program to help
ease the country's foreign debt as part of a lease agreement for
U.S. military bases, Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said Sunday.
   Secretary of State George Shultz and Manglapus planned to sign
the pact on Monday. In Manila, Philippine President Corazon Aquino
announced the expected signing, but provided no details.
   A U.S.-Philippines working group picked away at the details of
the agreement on Saturday and again on Sunday. While some technical
points remained to be resolved, the signing ceremony tentatively
was set for Monday afternoon.
   ``We still continue to be hopeful to conclude the
negotiations,'' said Alex Almasov, a State Department press officer.

   Sabotage or another criminal act
caused a plane crash that killed President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the
U.S. ambassador and 28 others, said a report released Sunday by a
U.S.-Pakistan investigation team.
   The 365-page report ruled out mechanical failure in the Aug. 17
crash of the Hercules C-130 transport plane, said Pakistan air
force Cmdr. Abbas Mirza, who gave a 27-page summary to reporters at
a hastily called news conference.
   ``The board believes that the accident was most probably caused
through the perpetration of a criminal act or sabotage,'' said the
summary by the 10-member U.S.-Pakistan team.
   The summary did not blame any person or group for the crash but
called for a separate criminal investigation.

   Planes brought food supplies to starving
refugees Sunday, but a relief official said it would take at least
two weeks to reduce deaths and help emaciated people so weak they
can't protect the corpses of loved ones from scavenging hyenas.
   Another relief official said the $1 million, 10-day airlift to
the war-ravaged south, which began Thursday, came too late to save
thousands of younger children.
   Twin-engine Cessnas are carrying 90 tons of food to about 40,000
southerners facing starvation in Abyei, 500 miles southwest of
Khartoum. They are hoping to provide stopgap relief for those who
left behind their crops and cattle to escape a civil war in the
region.
   A Western relief official said it would take two to three weeks
before the impact of the U.S.-financed supply mission could be
felt. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said eight
to 10 people, weakened by malnutrition, lack of medical treatment
and a long trek to refugee camps, were dying every day.

   A year after Wall Street's crash, Americans
widely view the stock market as a risky investment, and fully a
third see a good chance it will plummet again soon, a Media
General-Associated Press poll has found.
   Although respondents doubted the market's stability, 75 percent
said the crash of Oct. 19, 1987, had little or no effect on their
lives, and only about one in 10 said their finances had worsened in
the past year.
   But the crash did have one apparent impact: Of the 1,125 adults
in the national telephone survey, more than six in 10 said they
were being more cautious with their money now than they were a year
ago.
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points in panic
selling on Black Monday, after dropping 108 points the previous
Friday. Stock losses amounted to $500 billion, but the crash did
not set off an economic recession, as had been feared.

   The 100th Congress, running behind schedule,
is trying to finish work this week on election-year bills dealing
with drugs and taxes so members can return home to campaign.
   Some legislators were so itchy to leave town that on Friday they
sported buttons reading, ``Free the 100th.''
   ``I certainly would hope we wouldn't have to stay beyond
Wednesday. But nobody can predict that,'' said Senate Majority
Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Congress originally aimed to quit Sept. 30, but bogged down in a
fight over the anti-drug package. The Senate finally passed its
$2.6 billion version on Friday.

   Congress, disturbed by evidence the Energy
Department has mismanaged nuclear weapons reactors, has passed a
law to put them under standards nearly as stringent as those
applied to reactors used to produce electricity.
   Some lawmakers, however, believe even tougher legislation is
needed in the wake of the Energy Department's acknowledgement that
its aging reactors at the Savannah River Plant near Aiken, S.C.,
have experienced problems and that other plants have spewed
radioactivity into the environment.
   ``The main difficulty is that the Department of Energy has been
its own policeman,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., one of the
authors of a bill passed in September creating the Defense Nuclear
Facilities Board to monitor the operation of weapons reactors.
   The board, yet to be appointed by the president, has the
authority to inspect the facilities at which the Energy Department
manufactures nuclear weapons for the Pentagon.

   State Department officials engaged in quiet
discussions last week about a man who, although unseen by the
outside world for nine years, is at the heart of a diplomatic
debate over one of the world's most unfortunate countries.
   He is Pol Pot, whose three-and-a-half-year rule in Cambodia
during the late 1970's led to the slaughter of perhaps 2 million of
his countrymen before he and his Khmer Rouge allies were driven out
by Vietnamese invaders.
   David Hawk, an authority on the Khmer Rouge, says Pol Pot is
believed to be operating out of a small town in Thailand near the
Cambodian border, plotting a return to power once the Vietnamese
carry out their stated intention to withdraw from Cambodia in 1990.
   Hawk has written on Cambodia for Freedom House, a New York-based
human rights group, and formerly worked for Amnesty International.

   A racial slur uttered in frustration nearly
ended Lois Bostic's 27-year career in education. Then her black
students stepped in, taught their elders a lesson in tolerance, and
saved Mrs. Bostic's job.
   ``We were ready to forgive and go on,'' said senior Angela
Matthews, 17, one of six students who initiated, typed and
distributed petitions in support of the white librarian. ``Anybody
ought to get a second chance.''
   After the slur was reported last month, parents in this farming
town 80 miles southeast of Little Rock circulated petitions calling
for Mrs. Bostic's ouster, and she told school officials she would
quit. The board promptly endorsed her decision.
   But then, high school students mounted their own petition drive,
the school board rescinded its resolution, and Mrs. Bostic is here
to stay.

   Here he's called ``Mikki Maus,'' and the
60-year-old American has surprisingly good rapport with Soviet
youngsters for an international film star making his first live
appearance in the Soviet Union.
   Sunday evening at Moscow's 2,500-seat Rossiya Theater, with a
police cordon worthy of a minor head of state outside, the first
Soviet festival of Walt Disney animated classics opened with a
showing of ``Fantasia'' and a visit by Mickey Mouse himself.
   Standing about 5 foot, 6 inches in his clunky black patent
leather shoes, Mickey, played by Gabriella Spieth from Walt
Disney's West German office, strolled waving down the theater aisle
to the strains of ``Heigh Ho, Heigh Ho, It's Off to Work We Go.''
   In a juvenile version of the Moscow superpower summit, Mickey
was given a big hug and a keg of honey by Misha the Bear, mascot of
the 1980 Moscow Olympics.
