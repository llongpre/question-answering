<HEAD>Southern African Officials Oppose International Ivory Ban</HEAD>

   South Africa opposes an
international effort to ban the ivory trade, a government spokesman
said today.
   South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, which must cull their
elephants to keep the population under control, say such a ban could
drive up the price of illegal ivory and doesn't take into account
legal ivory exports that generate income for conservation programs.
   ``Our basic position is that we do not support a total ban on the
ivory trade worldwide,'' said Bosman Olivier, a spokesman for the
Department of Environmental Affairs.
   Olivier said South Africa wanted to make its position known but
does not plan to campaign in support of ivory trade.
   ``In South Africa we have a very healthy elephant population that
must be culled or it will simply destroy its own environment,'' he
said. ``The selling of the ivory in a legal manner makes good
sense.''
   South Africa earns $2 million annually from the sale of elephant
tusks at the culling program in Kruger National Park, Olivier said.
The money is spent on animal research and maintaining the park, he
added.
   Dick Pitman, chairman of the Zimbabwean conservation group the
Zambezi Society, said there is a question whether bans ``really work
or whether they merely raise prices and drive trade underground.''
   Soaring ivory prices in the last decade have fueled a killing
spree that has cut Africa's elephant population from an estimated
1.5 million in the 1970s to less than 700,000 today, experts say. An
average tusk weighs 11 pounds and can fetch $109 a pound on the
international market.
   This month, the United States, Canada, the 12-nation European
Economic Community, Switzerland and Canada have imposed bans on
ivory imports that make elephant poaching profitable. The EEC, Japan
and the United States consume up to 75 percent of the ivory in world
markets.
   The 102-member Convention In Trade Of Endangered Species will
consider such a ban in an October meeting in Geneva.
   Kenya, one country that supports a total ban on the trade, today
announced plans to destroy 12 tons of ivory the government has
seized from poachers, and it urged other nations to do the same.
President Daniel arap Moi gave no specific date for the incineration.
