   EDITOR'S NOTE _ Want to buy a lion? A zebra. A rhea bird? A trio
of bear cubs. No problem. Demand for wilder wildlife is sizeable
and the suppliers ever ready. That pleases animal dealers and
customers who, for benign and not so benign reasons, go for exotic
animals, even on a dinner plate. The trend bothers the increasingly
active animal rights groups and others who are disposed to raise
moral as well as ecological issues.

   A classified ad in a Pittsburgh newspaper:
``Celebese Ape, 14-week-old baby, diaper-trained, sucks finger;
also cougar &amp; bobcat babies &amp; other exotic animals.''
   The man placing the ad says he had plenty of animals to sell,
and what he didn't have at the time, he could get.
   ``There's nothing God put breath into I can't get,'' said Jim
Ledbetter, who until recently ran an exotic animal business in
Uniontown, Pa. ``If you want a zebra, elephant or whatever, no
problem.''
   Ledbetter went on to say he could get a black panther, an
endangered animal, for $2,000, but added they don't make good pets.
``In Florida, there's a guy who sells them for $6,000 a pop,'' he
says.
   Young elephants go for $20,000 each, old ones about $15,000, he
says. White tigers are about $50,000 each, $90,000 for a pair.
Cougars are $975, bobcats, $875.
   ``Everything I sell is cheap,'' he says.
   In the United States, the world's largest consumer of wildlife,
trading in exotic animals is entirely legal, as is ownership in
most places, subject to some state and local restrictions. That has
spurred animal rights groups into intensifying efforts to regulate
the industry.
   David Herbet, captive wildlife specialist for the Humane Society
of the United States in Washington, believes private ownership is a
``total misuse of wild animals.''
   About 90 percent of all wild animals die within the first two
years of captivity, regardless of whether they were captively bred,
he says.
   ``Wild animals should be ... left in the wild,'' echoes Doug
Inkley of the National Wildlife Federation in Washington.
   Faced with increasingly vocal criticism and the hostility of
animal rights groups, dealers generally have become wary of
publicity. At a recent auction in western Ohio, a sign prohibited
use of cameras and recording equipment and a non-uniformed guard
carrying a holstered gun searched one visitor's handbag. People
with cameras were escorted off the grounds.
   The exotic animal business is booming, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.
   An estimated 30,000 to 50,000 people in this country own, breed,
exhibit or sell wild and exotic animals, says Pat Hoctor of Prairie
Creek, Ind., publisher of the Animal Finders' Guide, one of the
largest publications in the country devoted to the trade.
   ``The vast majority are people who have them as a hobby,'' he
says. Of that number, about 300 could be considered professional
animal dealers, many of whom sell their wares through guides like
Hoctor's or at several auctions held regularly throughout the
country, particularly the Midwest.
   Among their customers:
   _A Minnesota couple that keep a chimpanzee, lion and tiger in
their basement, a boa constrictor in the bathroom and a baby skunk
in their living room.
   _A private game ranch in Wallisville, Texas, where would-be
big-game hunters who don't have the time or money to travel to
Africa can stalk captive-bred lions for $3,500 a crack _ ``a better
trophy at half the price,'' says owner Larry Wilburn.
   _A processing plant in Warren, Mich., and meat wholesaler in San
Bruno, Calif., which sell big-game meat, including lions,
hippopotamus, reindeer and eland, to restaurants eager to satisfy
the latest national fad for low-cholesterol, not to mention exotic,
meats.
   _A Florida farm that raises ostrich, emu and rhea for hides _
the latest trend in cowboy-boot leather.
   _A roadside menagerie in Pennsylvania where children can pet
everything from mice to elephants.
   _A tavern in Ohio where the owner's pet chimpanzee smokes
cigarettes and swigs six-packs of beer to the delight of patrons.
   In many places, a private owner is free to lead a lion on a
leash or keep a baboon in his back yard. He also is free to treat,
feed and house the animal as he pleases.
   Certain groups feel such practices should be outlawed because
many species pose a danger to public safety and the environment.
   They also cite the case of a lioness called Abby, crippled at 6
months because her Ohio owners fed her improperly, to make a point
that too few people know enough to properly care for an exotic
animal.
   Animals that have to be taken from an owner because of abuse or
neglect or that grow too big or unmanageable face an uncertain
future.
   ``The problem with those animals is that when they do become
mean and can't be handled, the first thing people do is call the
zoo to donate it,'' says Charles Wickenhauser, director of the
Pittsburgh Zoo. ``We certainly don't want an animal like that. They
have psychological problems and need special treatment to get them
back into a particular group of animals.''
   Hoctor gets upset on hearing about people abusing their animals,
either willfully or from ignorance. But he says the follies of some
shouldn't tarnish the entire group of owners and breeders who truly
enjoy their animals and know more about them and care for them
better than many zoos.
   ``Just because zoos are the commonly accepted places for animals
doesn't mean they're the authorities. Zoos are living museums.
Breeders know what animals need,'' he says.
   ``People see us holding things in cages. They misconceive that
we are raping the wild. We are actually the experts on the wild,''
says Hoctor, who raises lions, tigers, waterfowl and assorted other
animals and birds. ``While do-gooders are making a big stink about
how they love the wild, we're actually saving the wild'' through
breeding efforts.
   Animal dealer Bob Troumbly of Grand Rapids, Minn., concedes
there are considerable abuses and few safeguards.
   ``A lot of people buy this stuff for macho stuff,'' says
Troumbly, 31, who operates Northland Wildlife. ``This is America.
There are a lot of injustices in this world and that's just one of
them. There's always somebody out there willing to sell to somebody
they may not feel is qualified.
