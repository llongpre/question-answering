   An elephant with a habit of breaking
his cages and wearing out his welcome at a series of zoos has moved
into a home for the unwanted.
   Sonny is settling in at the Popcorn Park Zoo, 35 miles north of
Atlantic City, zoo director John Bergmann said Sunday. The three-ton
African elephant arrived Friday after a four-day cross-country trip
by truck.
   ``He investigated everything the first night he was here, testing
everything and seeing if he could push it down,'' Bergmann said.
``After he realized what he was in, we haven't had any problem.''
   The $300,000 stall is a 160-foot-square paddock with a pool and a
concrete column with a chain to attach toys like tree trunks or
empty beer kegs.
   The 11-year-old elephant's former owner, the Hillcrest Park Zoo
in Clovis, N.M., gave him up because he was too big and unruly. He
kept pulling his cage apart and once knocked down an electrified
wire designed to prevent his escape.
   Sonny has been passed from zoo to zoo, Bergmann said. The
elephant also has an unattractive scar on his trunk from his days in
the wild.
   ``He's not mean and nasty by any means,'' Bergmann said. ``He
just hasn't been trained to be handled and be taken care of.''
   The zoo, run by the Associated Humane Societies, takes in wild
and domestic animals that can't survive on their own or whose owners
no longer want them. Its residents include a tiger, two lions, four
black bears, a cougar and a hyena.
