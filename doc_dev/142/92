   American zoos increasingly are becoming a place
where cooped-up humans view free-roaming beasts, and many
institutions are uniting to save endangered species and return them
to the wilderness.
   ``Animals aren't in cages any more. They're in spacious
enclosures, in a much more aesthetically pleasing environment,''
said Charles H. Hoessle, director of the St. Louis Zoo. ``Modern
exhibits are being designed to cater to their behavioral needs.''
   The trend is evident at the new Central Park Zoo, where
wilderness has been duplicated in the heart of the city. The
revamped facility opens to the public on Monday.
   Robert Wagner, executive director of the American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums, which grants accreditation, said
the new Central Park Zoo ``clearly depicts the latest state of the
art.''
   Experts at the zoo let the animals tell them what changes to
make. For example, sea lions from the New York Aquarium were
invited to work the kinks out of the new pool. And other zoos are
finding ways to keep their animals entertained.
   ``It's quite common in ape exhibits to put sunflower seeds on
the floor so animals have something to do to keep them occupied, or
artificial termite mounds with honey or mustard,'' said Marvin
Jones, registrar of the San Diego Zoo. ``It's a way of easing their
boredom.''
   Busch Gardens in Tampa, Fla., was a trend-setter in 1965,
enclosing visitors on a monorail while the gazelles and zebras
frolicked unfettered on 60 acres. In the early 1970s, drive-through
parks proliferated.
   Since then, realistic settings have multiplied. In 1987, the zoo
association's 132 members spent nearly $500 million building or
renovating exhibits, Wagner said. ``American zoos are in their
heyday,'' he said.
   ``The public has changed, due to television primarily. People
are able to see how animals live in the wild'' and expect no less
from zoos, Jones said.
   The Bronx Zoo's Jungle World, a 37,000-square-foot, indoor
microcosm opened in 1985, boasts five waterfalls, a cloud machine,
100 species of tropical plants and 780 animals, including
endangered Bali mynah birds.
   In St. Louis, school children and scholars can study ecology and
endangered species next spring while viewing one-celled animals and
a ``living model'' of a Missouri Ozarks stream at the zoo's new $16
million, 55,000-square-foot educational complex.
   Visitors in Atlanta perch on a wooden observation platform, a la
safari, to experience the world's only naturalistic, multifamily
gorilla complex. The zoo was renovated after it lost accreditation
amid grisly stories of animal abuse.
   ``Where we can put animals on grass with natural foliage, fresh,
bubbling water and open sky, it makes us feel a whole lot better _
and as far as I know, the animals like it better,'' said Gerald S.
Lentz, zoological manager of Busch Gardens, which boasts 21 Asian
elephants and other endangered species among its 3,300 mammals,
birds and reptiles.
   Such amenities are necessary: zoos must breed more endangered
species _ while at the same time captivating public sentiment for
that cause.
   While animals aren't fooled by fake jungles or fields, the
wildlife settings ``help provide the visitor with a sense of
appreciation for the conservation of wild places,'' Wagner said.
   ``Zoos are becoming a last resort for vanishing species.
Municipal peoples, who are furthest from wildlife but who support
zoos, are ultimately beginning to play an ever larger role in
helping to sustain wildlife,'' said Dr. William Conway, director of
the New York Zoological Society.
   ``The new role of zoos is coming about because there are too
damn many people,'' Conway said. ``Within the next 20 or 30 years,
we will lose, at the very least, 20 percent of the remaining plant
and animal species on earth.''
   Zoos are not only focusing their efforts on breeding endangered
species, such as San Diego's California condor program, but are
also educating the public about them.
   ``We don't give a darn if people know that Asian elephants have
the bigger ears and African elephants the smaller ears,'' Conway
said. ``But if they like elephants, they may reflect upon the
meaning of elephants the next time they tickle the ivory keys on
their piano that resulted in some elephant's death.''
   Zoo association members share endangered animals and
technologies. There are special breeding facilities operated in
Front Royal, Va., by the National Zoological Park; on St.
Catherines Island, Ga., by the New York Zoological Park, and the
Zoological Park of San Diego. The New York society's Wildlife
Conservation International sponsors scientists in 35 countries.
   There also is a zoo movement in reverse. In November, zoo
association members shipped endangered mynah birds back to Bali,
where agricultural development had gobbled their native rain
forests. Early reports are that the program is a success, Wagner
said.
   Similar successes have occurred with the return of black buck
antelopes to Pakistan; tamarin monkeys to Brazil, and Arabian
oryxes, another type of antelope, to Jordan, he said.
   ``There is no substitute for nature,'' Conway said. ``We seek,
instead, to be a salesman for nature.''
