   For dinner tonight, how about gingered
alligator ribs, rattlesnake cacciatore, or, for the truly
adventurous, escallops of lion on a bed of fiddlehead ferns?
   Those are some of the dishes offered on a fairly regular basis
at the Mad Batter Restaurant in the seaside resort town of Cape
May, N.J.
   The Mad Batter is one of dozens of gourmet restaurants
throughout the country that have shucked chicken cordon bleu and
filet mignon for the likes of marinated grilled camel, roasted
hippopotamus and kangaroo chili, the cheapest on the menu at $15.75.
   The most expensive dish at the Mad Batter is Eye of Buffalo,
filet mignon with wild mushroom sauce, $19.50. Escallops of lion
cost $19, with rattlesnake cacciatore going for $18.
   Even some supermarkets are getting into the exotic act,
supplying meat to curious customers eager to test their culinary
skills.
   The trend bothers animal welfare agencies.
   ``The desire of some people to eat exotic wild animals is a sign
of decadence in our society. These people seem to have ethical
blinders on when it comes to their palate,'' says Craig Van Note,
vice president of Monitor Consortium, which represents 35
conservation and animal welfare groups.
   ``It puts an increased demand upon these wild animals, and
therefore it increases the removal of them from the wild,'' he
says. ``There's enough pressure on these animals as it is. They
don't need to become valuable as a human food source.''
   Those in the exotic meat business say there's no difference
between shooting a cow and shooting a lion, particularly a lion
that's raised in captivity on ranches and farms.
   Many people want meat that is leaner and lower in cholesterol
than pork chops or steak, and they say wild and exotic game often
fits the bill nicely.
   ``It's a skyrocketing business,'' says Gerald Prolman of Night
Bird Game and Poultry in San Bruno, Calif., which wholesales
everything from mouflon and beaver to reindeer and springbok.
``This business was started in 1979, and it has grown as fast as
people have found out the products were available.''
   Don Francis of Butcher Boy Products in Warren, Mich., has
processed and wholesaled conventional wild gae for 27 years. Now
he's hurrying to get into the exotic business.
   ``I saw there was a market for it and I wanted to get in while
the getting's good,'' says Francis, who sells full carcasses of
bear and exotic deer to restaurants. ``I just wish I'd been in it
earlier.''
   At the Mad Batter, Chef Danny Mellman says many patrons often
sample exotic meat dishes out of curiosity.
   ``A lot of it is shock factor,'' he says. ``They see wildebeest
and say, `I've got to eat wildebeest just to see what it's like and
to tell my friends I had it.'''
   But he says there are plenty of customers hankering for big game
meals on a regular basis.
   ``There are people who call every week and say, `What are you
running this week,''' he says.
   Mellman has also fielded calls from people who are offended by
his exotic fare or worry that the curried bear on their plate is
``the same bear they saw in the Philadelphia zoo.''
   Exotic meats are not zoos' castoffs. Mellman gets much of his
meat from abroad _ lion from East Africa and red deer from
Scotland, for instance. But many of those animals also are raised
on farms and ranches in this country.
   ``It started about 10 years ago, and it's growing,'' says George
Mazur of World Safari Inc. of Washington, a wild game wholesaler.
``A lot of these farms are springing up all over the place.''
   Some people, though, have trouble swallowing the new fad _ no
matter how tasty or healthy it is.
   Bob Troumbly of Northland Wildlife in Grand Rapids, Minn., sells
animals to public zoos and similar facilities. But he says he
couldn't bring himself to sell them to someone who wants to roast,
pickle, fry or boil them.
   ``My feelings get involved,'' he says. ``My bleeding heart gets
involved.''
