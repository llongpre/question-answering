   Many people find it easy to support the idea of
wildlife conservation and the environment, until it gets
uncomfortable, until choices and distinctions become difficult to
make.
   That's the tacit message of ``Arctic Wars,'' a one-hour PBS
special tonight on Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which
already is staked out as ``the environmental battleground of the
1990s.''
   It's also the message of ``Africa: Playing God with Nature?,'' a
National Geographic Explorer special on TBS Sunday that shows three
African nations' different approaches to wildlife conservation.
   Take the tundra: At the northeast boundary of Alaska, beside the
Yukon Territory, is the 19 million-acre Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, a wilderness area created by Congress in 1980.
   Under the congressional act's Section 1002, the refuge's 1.5
million-acre coastal plain is exempted from the wilderness
designation. Why? The oil industry figures the so-called
``ten-oh-two'' lands sit on more than 2{ billion barrels of oil.
   The 1002 lands are core calving grounds for the porcupine
caribou, and prime habitat for the wolf and grizzly bear.
Unfortunately, porcupine caribou aren't cute, grizzlies are scary,
and wolves have suffered from bad press.
   It's also the homeland of native Indians and Eskimos who rely on
the caribou for their subsistence. And yet, there are Alaskans who
also need jobs in an economy that derives 85 percent of its
revenues from the oil industry.
   What will become of the lands? The oil companies insist the
adjoining oil fields at Prudhoe Bay are in decline, that they'll
need the oil and that they can get it out and return the wilderness
to ``useful tundra.''
   Useful tundra?
   ``The official position of the Bush administration concerning
ANWR and other areas is that we'll go forward with exploration and
drilling if we can do it in an environmentally sound manner,'' says
Assisant Interior Secretary David O'Neil.
   ``Arctic Wars'' makes it all too clear that the 1002 lands
probably would be open to oil exploration and development today if
it weren't for the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989.
   As one oil executive argues, ``If you perceive that the
aesthetics of a drilling rig destroy wilderness, then we've reduced
the argument to one of aesthetics, which is a very difficult
argument.''
   What ``Arctic Wars'' doesn't make clear is that oil development,
or even extensive recreational use, threatens species plants,
animals, insects and microscopic life we know nothing about. Once
gone, it is gone for good.
   The other side of conservation is in Africa, where Kenya,
Zimbabwe and South Africa have taken three fundamentally different
tacks in managing wildlife.
   The problem is most critical in Kenya, where the world's highest
birth rate and endemic poverty have decimated wildlife and habitat.
Where humans compete with animals for food and space, animals
always lose.
   Disastrous policies by Kenya's government in the '70s literally
destroyed one game preserve by overpopulating it with elephants,
and created enormous ill will among its people by denying them
access to game during famine.
   Kenya's war on poachers and a worldwide ban on ivory have helped
save the dwindling elephant herd. Tourism is Kenya's largest source
of hard currency, and that also may help the elephant.
   This is small consolation to a Kenyan farmer trying to eke out a
living on lands adjoining unfenced game preserves. To him, the
elephant that eats and tramples his crops is a 2{-ton cockroach.
   Zimbabwe takes a sensible, if unsentimental, approach, in
demanding that wildlife ``pay its own way,'' with licensed trophy
and meat harvesting. Local people are ``given'' their wildlife as
manageable assets.
   Then there's South Africa's intensively managed Kruger Nation
Park - a fenced area the size of Massachusetts, where as many as
400 elephants - usually old males - are killed each year to keep
the population in balance.
   ``Arctic Wars'' and ``Playing God with Nature?'' don't answer
questions, they pose them. It's our planet. What shall we do with
it?

   Elsewhere in television ...
   PUBLIC TV AUDIENCE STILL GROWING: Public television increased
its audience by 9 percent in November, its second straight month of
audience growth in the fall season, the Public Broadcasting Service
says.
   November's prime-time rating was an average 2.4, up from 2.2
during November 1989. October's 2.3 rating was up 10 percent over
the same period last year, according to A.C. Nielsen Co. figures,
PBS said.
   A rating point equals 931,000 TV households, so PBS averaged
nearly 2.5 million households tuned in. That's minuscule compared
with commercial TV ratings, but sheer bliss to PBS executives and
their audience.
   PBS also reports its member-support pledges are running 6
percent over last December's pledge period.
