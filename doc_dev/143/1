<DESCRIPT>  MOVIE; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  AMERICAN filmmakers do many things well, but the sophisticated romance isn't
one of them. For this, Hollywood must defer to the French, and on very rare
occasion to the British, who brought us such four-hankie classics as "Brief
Encounter" and "The Go-Between.";    Touchstone's brand new "Green Card" isn't
up to those standards, mind you, but it is something quite special -- a
smartly written and performed relationship picture that assumes a certain
level of intelligence on the part of the viewer. We'll go one further: "Green
Card" makes "Pretty Woman" and "Ghost" look positively arthritic in their
plotting. Why, it even has a continental feel. Translation: the principals
lead interesting lives, have a sense of humor about themselves and can banter
without resorting to profanity.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Before rushing to clap Hollywood on the back, we should also add that
"Green Card" stars the great French actor Gerard Depardieu and was directed by
Australia's Peter Weir, best known for "Dead Poets Society" and "Witness"
(remember Harrison Ford and Kelly McGillis cheek-to-cheeking to Sam Cooke's
"Wonderful World"). Depardieu's love interest is played with just the right
air of mock indifference by Andie MacDowell, the more conventional sister of
"sex, lies &amp; videotape.";    Together, Depardieu, Weir and MacDowell have
fashioned a slick, spunky little fable about a marriage of convenience that
becomes something more, though not by the same predictable route taken by two
decades of Neil Simon lovebirds.;    Depardieu plays George, a con
man/composer from France. MacDowell is Bronte, an uptown kind of woman who's
big on horticulture and chic environmental causes. He wants to stay in New
York; she wants to stay in her apartment building, which has strict rules
about not renting to singles. They decide to get married -- to get George his
work permit (a green card) and to keep Bronte in her dream home, which comes
complete with a Victorian greenhouse and miniature rain forest.;    It's a
business arrangement, see? Nothing personal. No lingering attachments after
the proper documents are signed. Both shrug nervously and go their separate
ways -- until immigration officers start sniffing around and George and Bronte
must play out a more elaborate charade for the government, her parents and
neighbors.;    Inevitably, just by virtue of their proximity, the two become
better acquainted. In one of the funnier sequences, they go to great lengths
to fabricate a wedding album, complete with Polaroids of winter and tropical
vacations. It's all great fun, but hardly the stuff of lasting romance. After
all, she's kind of uptight and comes with a perfectly predictable beau (Gregg
Edelman), and George is a live-for-the-moment kind of guy with "a past."
Bronte's friends find the hulking, refreshingly blunt foreigner charming;
Bronte, in keeping with her Victorian namesake, finds him loud and uncouth.;  
 Granted, there isn't a great deal going on here. The script at best is a
reversal of the old boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl formula.;   
What makes "Green Card" special is Weir's jumpy pacing and Depardieu's lusty
portrayal. Weir constantly throws his hero into impossible situations, and
Depardieu, that bear with the little-boy grin, improvises with great gusto.
His impromptu  piano recital before a roomful of uptown swells is hilarious.
It, like this movie, is a reminder that we'll buy just about anything,
provided it's delivered with charm and energy.; Green Card;
