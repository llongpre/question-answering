   Miss America 1990 Debbye Turner says
giving up her crown this week will be bittersweet, but she conceded
she's looking forward to lounging around with no make up on.
   But after a week of relaxing, it will be back to the books to
finish her degree in veterinary medicine.
   Miss Turner, a 24-year-old who competed as Miss Missouri after
losing in years past in her home state of Arkansas, said she has
enjoyed the last 12 months.
   She says Saturday, her last night as Miss America, will be a sad
one.
   ``It is a bittersweet experience. This has been a good year and
you always hate to see it end,'' Miss Turner said. ``I'm sure I'll
be a little weepy about it.''
   Among the highlights were meeting President Bush, Bill Cosby,
Oprah Winfrey and jazz great Lionel Hampton.
   ``I am looking forward to a week to go somewhere and do nothing
but lay out with no makeup,'' she said. ``I get tired. I'm on the
road seven days a week. Living out of a suitcase has its
challenges.''
   She said that after taking a week off she will resume her
studies at the University of Missouri-Columbia Veterinary School,
where she is six months short of her doctor of veterinary medicine
degree.
   Miss Turner said she remains surprised by how much attention she
received as Miss America. Among the stranger incidents drawing
attention were the loss of her luggage in Moscow, Idaho, and a call
she placed to another Turner staying at a New York hotel who was
receiving her messages.

   American cyclist Greg LeMond kept race
officials in suspense Saturday by not checking in for Sunday's
finale of the World Cycling Championships.
   LeMond, the first American to win the Tour de France, was
nowhere to be seen Saturday. His absence sparked rumors that he was
planning to fly in by helicopter at the last moment in order to
lessen the effects of jet lag and media attention.
   Whatever the reason, organizers said, LeMond would be at the
starting line to defend his title in the individual men's
professional road race.
   If LeMond succeeds, he will be the first rider to win both the
Tour de France and the world championship two years running.
   LeMond, who rides for the French professional team ``Z,'' has
won the Tour de France three times _ 1986, 1989 and 1990. He also
won world championships in 1983 and 1989.
   In last month's Zurich Classic, however, he was edged out by
Frenchman Charles Mottet.
   Unlike the Tour de France, a grueling, 2,112-mile race spread
out in stages over three weeks, Sunday's 162-mile championship will
be held on a nine-mile circuit.

   A harmonica player who has been
jailed in the past for impersonating Grateful Dead guitarist Bob
Weir allegedly has been at it again, police say.
   Oakland police are looking for Randall Delpiano to arrest him on
a warrant accusing him of stealing and violating his parole after
serving 15 months on fraud and theft charges, Sgt. Stan Bricker
said Friday.
   Bricker questioned Delpiano two years ago after he was charged
with bilking a woman out of $4,000. He was accused of gaining her
confidence by impersonating Weir. He was paroled in April.
   Bricker said Delpiano told him ``he gets some satisfaction'' out
of pretending to be Weir. Delpiano resembles Weir, who doesn't play
harmonica.
   ``People like him when they think he's Bob Weir,'' Bricker said.
   Grateful Dead publicist Dennis McNally called Delpiano ``a
professional con man who has got an emotional problem.''
   ``Bobby obviously objects to him doing so,'' McNally said. ``I
really hope he runs into sharper Deadheads who recognize him,''
referring to the nomadic group of fans who sometimes follow the
band around the country.
   Bricker identified Delpiano as the man who allegedly has been
impersonating Weir in the community of Discovery Bay in Contra
Costa County.

   Robert Indiana, an artist known for his
block-letter representations of the word ``LOVE,'' was arrested on
a charge of hiring a male prostitute, police said Saturday.
   Deputies also seized nine drawings of naked young men from
Indiana's home on Vinalhaven, an island 16 miles off Maine's coast
that is known as an artists' retreat, officials said.
   ``We did not seize anything claiming it was pornographic,''
District Attorney William Anderson said. ``The only reason we
seized it was for evidence.''
   The prosecutor declined to comment when asked whether two young
Vinalhaven men who told investigators that Indiana paid them for
sex would face charges.
   The two men, one 21 and the other 19, told police they were
posing for Indiana when the sex acts allegedly occurred. The men
claimed they were paid to have sex with Indiana.
   Indiana was released on $300 bail after being arrested on the
misdemeanor charge.
   There is no phone listing for Indiana and attempts to reach him
for comment were unsuccessful.
   Indiana, 61, was born Robert E. Clark but adopted the name of
his home state. His colorful representation of the word ``LOVE'' in
a square with the ``L-O'' on top of the ``V-E,'' the ``O'' tilted
on its side made him famous in the 1960s.
   Indiana is to be arraigned Oct. 3 in Maine District Court.
Anderson said the maximum penalty for the misdemenaor charge is
$1,000 fine and 364 days in jail.
