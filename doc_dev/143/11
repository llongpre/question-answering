   Woody Allen, Rob Reiner, Phil
Alden Robinson, Oliver Stone and Peter Weir are the Directors Guild
of America's nominees for 1989 directorial achievement.
   Allen was nominated for ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' Reiner for
``When Harry Met Sally ... ,'' Robinson for ``Field of Dreams,''
Stone for ``Born of the Fourth of July'' and Weir for ``Dead Poets
Society.''
   ``I'm just stunned,'' said Robinson, a first-time nominee. ``I
didn't think I stood a chance.''
   ``I think we have some interesting choices this year,''
commented Barry Levinson, last year's winner for ``Rain Man,'' as
he announced the nominees Tuesday.
   Reiner, Robinson and Weir were somewhat surprising choices,
since several critics have overlooked their achievements in favor
of such films as Paul Mazursky's ``Enemies, A Love Story,'' Edward
Zwick's ``Glory,'' Bruce Beresford's ``Driving Miss Daisy'' and
Spike Lee's ``Do the Right Thing.''
   Said Robinson: ``Bruce Beresford deserved a nomination. I'm
surprised Ed Zwick didn't get a nomination. And a lot of people
were pulling for Paul Mazursky.''
   ``Crimes and Misdemeanors'' is an alternately funny and haunting
story of infidelity, starring Allen, Alan Alda and Anjelica Huston.
``When Harry Met Sally ...'' is perhaps the lightest movie in
competition, a romantic comedy with Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan as
best friends who become lovers.
   ``Field of Dreams,'' set in an Iowa corn field, features Kevin
Costner as a baseball fan who recaptures the past by building a
ballpark on his farm. ``Born on the Fourth of July'' is Stone's
account of the life of Ron Kovic (played by Tom Cruise), a
patriotic soldier whose life is shattered in Vietnam.
   ``Dead Poets Society'' casts Robin Williams as an unconventional
teacher working within the confines of a conventional boys boarding
school.
   The guild says its awards have deviated from the Academy Awards
only three times since 1949.
   Three years ago, Steven Spielberg won the DGA award for ``The
Color Purple,'' but Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
members didn't nominate him for an Oscar. The directing Oscar that
year went to Sydney Pollack for ``Out of Africa.''
   Some observers believe the guild's 9,000 members, all of whom
have a vote, represent a more divergent electorate than the Academy.
   Four of the 1989 nominees have been up for the DGA award before.
Allen was nominated for ``Annie Hall'' (1977), ``Manhattan'' (1979)
and ``Hannah and Her Sisters'' (1986); Reiner for ``Stand By Me''
(1986); Stone for ``Platoon'' (He won in 1986); and Weir for
``Witness'' (1985).
   The awards will be presented at the DGA's 42nd annual dinner, to
be held simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles on March 10.
