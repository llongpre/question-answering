<LEADPARA>  ANDIE MacDowell, face framed by a cascade of chestnut curls flowing past her
shoulders, tucks one slim leg under her on the sofa as she gets comfortable.; 
  Nominated (but not picked) for a Golden Globe Award for best actress for her
starring role in "Green Card," playing nationwide, MacDowell is enjoying a
longed-for hiatus from moviemaking. (The movie won the Golden Globe for best
comedy and co-star Gerard Depardieu was named best actor in that category.)  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The 32-year-old actress also stars in two upcoming films, "Object of
Beauty" (with John Malkovich) -- which is set for nationwide release Feb. 22
-- and the action thriller "Hudson Hawk," co-starring Bruce Willis, set for
release this summer.;    In between films, MacDowell has continued to fulfill
her modeling contract with the cosmetics company L'Oreal.;    Down-home
glamour; Sitting in her publicist's office, dressed in pleated gray trousers
and a fitted black riding coat with an embroidered collar, MacDowell looks
very relaxed.;    Even without any makeup she has the beauty that has made her
an internationally known and admired model.;    In addition to two careers,
MacDowell has a husband (ex-model Paul Qualley) and two young children, Justin
and Rainey.;    "For some reason I feel energized by having two kids and a
career," she says, with the slightest hint of a Southern drawl. (MacDowell is
a native of Gaffney, S.C.);    "I feel like the more I have to do, the more
energy I have. I know it sounds like it would be overwhelming and it is, but
I'm not alone, because I have a very strong, sweet husband.;    "Paul's been
'Mr. Mom' practically all year. He's traveled with me and the kids," she
says.;    The couple met when both were on a modeling shoot for the Gap.;   
"It was so romantic," MacDowell says. "(The ad) was (shot) on an old set where
they've shot some Western movies.";    Unlike a lot of models, MacDowell was
reluctant to become an actress, although she had always been interested in
acting.;    "It seemed like there was no hope. I felt like models were already
defeated before they started. Not only in society, but in business, too. I
just thought if I could get a modeling contract -- this was before L'Oreal --
that would be the ideal for me.";    'Me, Jane?' 'No, me Jane'; As fate had
it, director Hugh Hudson saw pictures of MacDowell in British Vogue and called
the editor to say he was interested in her for the role of Jane in "Greystoke:
The Legend of Tarzan" (1984).;    MacDowell was delighted to be in a Tarzan
movie.;    "(As a child) I remember every Sunday going to eat over at my
grandmother's house and after lunch my dad would want to take a nap. He would
want to watch football, but he was very sweet and he would always let me watch
'Tarzan.' So I had fond memories of Tarzan," she says.;    Unfortunately,
MacDowell says a combination of bad reviews of the film and the fact that her
own Southern voice was dubbed over by Glenn Close caused "huge problems" for
her.;    "I already had being a model held against me. It's funny how success
in modeling can both help and hurt you," she says.;    After the "Greystoke"
debacle, MacDowell's only other acting job was in the hit film "St. Elmo's
Fire" (1985) in which she played the object of Emilio Estevez's adoration.;   
Strait-laced stereotypes;  "After that there was nothing I was interested in
doing," she says. Until the innovative "sex, lies and videotape" (1989) came
along. MacDowell played a sexually repressed young wife in that film.;    Now,
in "Green Card," she plays an emotionally repressed horticulturist who agrees
to marry a French immigrant (Depardieu) so he can get the much-desired green
card entitling him to legal residency in the United States -- and she can get
the marriage license crucial to obtaining a wonderful apartment available only
to a married couple.;    "She's so internal, she's built a wall around
herself," MacDowell says of her character, Bronte Parrish.;    "Instead of
being able to love anybody else, she is so closed off, a recluse almost, she
just puts all her love into her plants.";    As a result of playing these two
repressed characters, MacDowell says, "I feel I should run out and show the
world I'm not like that. I'm not deeply moody or whatever. And after 'sex,
lies and videotape,' I felt I had to keep telling people I have no problem
having orgasms.;    "But I do understand that kind of woman. I grew up in the
South and there is so much repression in Southern women.";    MacDowell's two
upcoming films have her playing more upbeat women. In "Object of Beauty," she
and Malkovich play two very rich Americans.;    When they lose their money,
only her small Henry Moore sculpture stands between them and poverty -- until
it's stolen. The chase to find it ensues.;    "(My character in this movie) is
not really likable in a way," MacDowell says. "But in the end she is sort of
likable, a bit wild.";    Crooks and capers; In "Hudson Hawk" she plays "a hip
nun -- there's a difference between a nun and a hip nun," she says. "This one
wears sunglasses. And she works for the Vatican, protecting priceless art
treasures, including Leonardo Da Vinci's gold-making machine.;    "Bruce
(Willis) is a famous cat burglar who has just been released from prison. He
wants to go straight, but he's forced to try to steal the machine.";   
MacDowell never finished college. She says she dropped out to become a model
because "I had too much energy for school. I couldn't sit still. I feel I've
really gotten my education by traveling and by experiencing things.;    "I had
only been to five states before I went to Paris to model and I lived there for
18 months and then I went all over the world. So it was a great education.;   
"And when you make a lot of money you have to do something with it, so you
learn about business," she says.;    Motherhood has made MacDowell seriously
appraise her own behavior.;    "You have to be something your children can be
proud of, which can make you grow up a lot," she says. "I've gone through a
lot of searching ever since I had children.";    And success, she says, has
given her a real sense of security.;    "It's a nice feeling," she says. "I
used to be very shy, so now I feel a lot better about myself.;    "Growing up,
I always thought I had to live up to what other people thought of me. Being
myself is so much easier," she says.;    "Right now I just love life!"  </TEXT>
