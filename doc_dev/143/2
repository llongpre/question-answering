   From Tarzan's mate to Gerard Depardieu's
leading lady - that's the amazing range of Andie MacDowell's
fast-rising movie career.
   The South Carolinian made her film debut in 1984 opposite
Christopher Lambert in ``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of
the Jungle.'' The movie didn't do much for either performer, and
MacDowell's career languished until last year's ``sex, lies and
videotape.'' The film brought prestigious offers, including one
from Peter Weir (``Witness,'' ``Dead Poets Society'') to co-star
opposite Depardieu in ``Green Card.''
   Touchstone Pictures released ``Green Card'' in limited
engagements before year's end in time for Academy Award
consideration, and the movie will open nationally Jan. 11.
   Weir wrote, directed and produced the story of a Frenchman
(Depardieu) who lacks a green card to take a job in the United
States. The solution: get married to an American. MacDowell needs
to be married in order to rent the ``perfect apartment'' in New
York. Voila!
   MacDowell, a rare beauty whose screen presence belies a basic
shyness, admits she was scared to death at her first meeting with
Weir. ``I wanted to do this film so badly, and I wanted to make the
proper impression. Any time you want to make the proper impression,
you usually don't,'' she said with a laugh.
   ``I left that meeting going over every word that I had uttered,
every movement that I had made. I guess it worked. I got the job.''
   Her first meeting with Depardieu was easier: ``Gerard said in an
interview that I was nervous, and I was. I was more nervous meeting
with Peter than with Gerard. He's very charming, you know, and you
can see immediately how easy and comfortable he is with himself.''
   About the language problem: ``I can get by in French. I would
say that Gerard speaks better English than I speak French. We did
all right. A lot of times he would speak French to me, because I
can understand it. Peter speaks perfect French.''
   Andie MacDowell was born in the small mill town of Gaffney,
S.C., and grew up on both sides of the border between the
Carolinas. The urge to act came early.
   ``Even as a child I loved to entertain. I loved to make people
laugh. I used to put on shows in my garage. I danced in front of
the TV - `Look at me! Look at me!' A little bit of a ham, I guess.
I did theater when I was in college,'' she said.
   ``My mother, who is no longer alive, was very happy that I
wanted to act, and she gave me great confidence. She sustained me.
My father, I think at the beginning was a bit frightened, only
because of the possibility of danger that I was going to the big
city. He had plans for his daughter: he wanted me to be a nurse,
get my education, marry a doctor and have children. Now he seems
very proud that I'm happy.''
   MacDowell did go to the big city, where she studied in a
repertory theater. Playing Jane to Lambert's Tarzan seemed like a
star-making turn, but it wasn't. Her only memorable role afterward
was an unobtainable love in the yuppie melodrama ``St. Elmo's
Fire.'' Then came ``sex, lies and videotape,'' in which she played
the frustrated wife of a philandering husband.
   ``I would say it was the beginning of my career,'' she
commented. ``I didn't know how it would turn out. It was such a
low-budget film with a new director (Stephen Soderbergh). When I
met him, I had complete trust in him.
   ``But you just don't know. It might get made and never
distributed. That was my fear. I thought I would have something on
tape to show casting directors what I was capable of. I knew that I
finally had a role that I could do very well.
   ``I had confidence in myself as far as the role. I didn't think
that anybody knew her as well as I knew her. It touched me in a
very deep place.''
   She feared that people might be narrow-minded about the film's
explicit talk. Not until ``sex, lies'' won first prize at the Park
City film festival did she think that it might be distributed after
all. Then it won big at Cannes, and she thought, ``Well, it really
will get distributed!''
   MacDowell lives with her husband, Paul Qualley, and their two
children in a farmhouse outside New York City. ``I wanted to move
further into the country and live on a farm,'' she said, ``but this
career has sort of taken over my life. This year I lived in
Budapest and Rome and London and New York. I did three films.
   ``I don't think I plan to do three films next year. After so
many years of wanting to do good work, to all of a sudden have the
opportunity to work on three such interesting and different
projects, it was too tempting to pass up. I hope I don't do that
again.''
