<LEADPARA>  The big news on the rep-house scene is the arrival of Derek Jarman's "The
Garden," a provocative re-telling of the Passion Play with the Christ figure
now represented by two young male lovers who are detailed, badgered and
tortured. The latest from the prolific Jarmen, who has AIDS, is playing San
Francisco's Roxie (16th Street) tonight and Saturday. It's part of a "Cutting
Edge III" series that also includes electrifying political dramas from
Ecuador, Bulgaria and Cuba.;    This weekend's Castro schedule is dedicated to
more popular fare. Tonight at San Francisco's Castro Street theater are two of
the best of '90: Martin Scorsese's "GoodFellas" with Stephen Frears' "The
Grifters." Saturday, the emphasis is on giddier satire -- Peter Weir's "Green
Card" with Gerard Depardieu and Andie McDowell, and Paul Mazursky's
ill-conceived "Scenes From a Mall" with Woody Allen and Bette Midler. "Green
Card" is breezy and sophisticated; "Scenes" is anemic and strident and not at
all worthy of the talents involved.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Closer to home, San Jose's Towne Theatre has Tom Stoppard's brilliant
adaptation of his own play, "Rosencrantz &amp; Guildenstern Are Dead," paired with
Monty Python's 1972 anthology "And Now for Something Completely Different"
(tonight and Saturday). It's a shame the theater didn't put "R&amp;G" with
Zeffirelli's new "Hamlet" (Sunday and Monday with 1990s "Cyrano de Bergerac").
"R&amp;G" is an absurdist comedy that ponders the concepts of fate and chance as
it details what might have been happening behind the scenes at Elsinore Castle.  </TEXT>
