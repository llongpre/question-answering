Paramount's "The Godfather, Part III," Columbia's "Awakenings," Universal's 
"Kindergarten Cop" and Disney's "Three Men and a Little Lady" are the four 
films likeliest to rack up the highest box-office grosses this Christmas 
season, according to people in the industry who bank on their ability to 
predict these things. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the schedule is more jammed than usual, with the major studios set 
to release 21 feature films, three more than last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"The saying goes that the pie is only so big, that carving it into so many 
pieces will mean a smaller slice for each," said John Krier, president of 
Exhibitor Relations. "But everyone is hoping that the pie will get a little 
larger. There are so many pictures out there people want to see." 
</P>
<P>
So, which of these horses are going to break out of the pack? After talking 
with studio executives, producers, agents, marketing people and others in the 
business whose guessing games are more informed than others, here's a handicap 
of the field: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Morning-Line Favorites: 
</P>
<P>
"The Godfather, Part III" (Paramount, Dec. 25): An "event" film with tremendous 
"wanna-see," even more "wanna-love." Few believe it will be the work of art its 
Oscar-winning predecessors were, but who's going to skip it? 
</P>
<P>
"Awakenings" (Columbia, Dec. 20): A drama starring Robert DeNiro and Robin 
Williams, reportedly at the top of their form, this Penny Marshall film is said 
to pack a lot of emotional punch. DeNiro and the film have been mentioned as 
Oscar contenders. 
</P>
<P>
"Kindergarten Cop" (Universal, Dec. 21): Insiders say this action-comedy, which 
re-teams director Ivan Reitman with his "Twins" star Arnold Schwarzenegger, has 
received incredibly high marks at research screenings. 
</P>
<P>
"Three Men and a Little Lady" (Buena Vista, Nov. 21): The sequel to the 
studio's 1987 Christmas hit, "Three Men and a Baby," has also tested well and, 
as a sequel, has a built-in audience coming in. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Contenders: 
</P>
<P>
"Edward Scissorhands" (20th Century Fox, Dec. 7, limited opening): Fox is high 
on this modern-day, off-kilter fable directed by fantasy-king Tim Burton 
("Batman," "Beetlejuice"). Though Johnny Depp is supposed to be terrific and 
research screenings have gone well, not everyone is convinced: "Show me a film 
that Depp has opened, let alone sustained," said one producer. "And good 
reviews only bring you grosses like 'Avalon.' " 
</P>
<P>
"Misery" (Columbia-Castle Rock, Nov. 30): This ultra-scary psychological 
thriller, adapted by William Goldman from a Stephen King novel, has reportedly 
played even better with research audiences than director Rob Reiner's last film 
-- "When Harry Met Sally." Sources say it will revive James Caan's career and 
make a star of film newcomer Kathy Bates. 
</P>
<P>
"Russia House" (MGM-Pathe, Dec. 19 limited): Word is the movie, adapted from a 
John le Carre novel, moves slowwwwwly. But the novel was one of the author's 
most successful and accessible, and no one is betting against the pairing of 
Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
"Green Card" (Buena Vista, Dec. 25 limited): A comedy produced, directed, and 
written by Peter Weir starring the ubiquitous Gerard Depardieu and Andie 
McDowell ("sex, lies, and videotape"). Disney believes it's another "Pretty 
Woman." Industry insiders give it a chance of filling one of the five best 
picture Oscar spots on February's final ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"Mermaids" (Orion, Dec. 14): A coming-of-age story featuring Cher, Winona Ryder 
and Bob Hoskins, said by some to be Ryder's movie. There were well-publicized 
problems on the set (Richard Benjamin is the third director) and early 
eyewitness reports are decided mixed. "People are still fascinated by Cher," 
says one producer. "But Benjamin, who hasn't performed in a major way since 'My 
Favorite Year' has to be considered a question mark." 
</P>
<P>
"Havana" (Universal, Dec. 12, limited): A Sydney Pollack love story set against 
the Cuban revolution with Robert Redford and Lena Olin ("Enemies, A Love 
Story"). Redford is said to deliver his best performance in years, but the buzz 
is that there is little chemistry between the glamorous stars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Dark Horses: 
</P>
<P>
Other films may have tougher going, if the conventional wisdom is borne out. 
Tri-Star's "Look Who's Talking Too" (Dec. 14) -- high interest and awareness 
notwithstanding -- could find its inventive gimmick wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
Fox's "Come See the Paradise" (Dec. 12), a World War II drama about an 
interracial relationship, is said by one eyewitness to be "the first truly 
boring film Alan Parker has made." 
</P>
<P>
"Alice," (Orion, Dec. 25, limited) is characterized as one of Woody Allen's 
more minor films, while Fox faces an uphill battle trying to sell "Predator 2" 
(Nov. 16) without Arnold Schwarzenegger in the title role. Warner's "The 
Rookie" (Dec. 7) is perceived as a benchmark film for Clint Eastwood, an actor 
whose popularity as an action star has been on the decline. "If it takes off, 
his franchise will regain some luster," said one producer. "If it fails it'll 
be 'next chapter.' " 
</P>
<P>
In Warner's "The Sheltering Sky" (Dec. 7, limited), Bernardo Bertolucci ("The 
Last Emperor") reportedly elicits exquisite performances from his cast (Debra 
Winger and John Malkovich) but seems more comfortable on the epic scale than on 
an intimate one. "The fact that Warner Bros. didn't screen it early says to me 
that there's something slightly rotten," said an executive at a rival studio. 
</P>
<P>
Warners has another tough sell with "Hamlet" (Dec. 19, limited). Not only is it 
Shakespeare, but the casting of Mel Gibson in the lead has reportedly drawn 
laughs in theaters where the trailer has been shown. Still, the word on 
Gibson's performance is good and director Franco Zeffirelli has been a master 
at popularizing works of the Bard. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Longshots: 
</P>
<P>
As always, there's talk of some clinkers. Paramount's "Almost An Angel" (Dec. 
19.) is said to be an unfortunate departure for "Crocodile Dundee" duo Paul 
Hogan and wife Linda Kozlowski. MGM-Pathe's "Rocky V, The Final Bell"(Nov. 16) 
has been called "the major groan of the Christmas season," an expensive 
embarrassment to a studio with a paucity of riches. 
</P>
<P>
Research screenings of Brian De Palma's "The Bonfire of the Vanities" (Warner 
Bros., Dec. 21) have reportedly not gone well. One eyewitness called it a 
"cartoon" of a film and questioned whether the material was suited to De 
Palma's blood-and-guts style. "Everyone is asking if Brian can find a way to 
mutilate a woman in it . . . Melanie Griffiths watch out," said a producer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Fast Out of the Gate: 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Costner's "Dances With Wolves" soared on opening weekend, turning in a 
per-screen average of more than $40,000. Industry analysts believe it will hold 
steady when it's released wide in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
On the Outside: 
</P>
<P>
Independent films will also be jockeying for position. Among them, Miramax has 
three entries: Merchant/Ivory's "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" (Nov. 23, limited), a 
slow but tasteful art house film co-starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward; 
"The Long Walk Home" (Dec. 25, limited), a well-intentioned civil rights drama 
starring Sissy Spacek and Whoopi Goldberg; and "The Grifters" (Dec. 5, L.A. 
one-week Oscar-qualifying run), a dark comedy with great performances by 
Anjelica Huston and Annette Bening considered a bit downbeat for holiday fare. 
</P>
<P>
Orion Classics is set to release "Cyrano" (mid-December in L.A.), a lush French 
production that won its star, Gerard Depardieu, the best actor award at Cannes. 
</P>
<P>
No word at all on Bruce Beresford's "Mr. Johnson" (Avenue, Dec. 12), but 
referring to its setting of road building in West Africa in the 1920s, one 
producer quipped: "They ought to put speed bumps in the aisle . . . to prevent 
people from leaving in droves."
