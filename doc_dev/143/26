<LEADPARA>  I KNOW one person, aside from Kitty Kelley's editor Alice Mayhew, who has read
the Nancy Reagan-life-according-to-Kelley book. Doonesbury creator Garry
Trudeau has been allowed a peek. And Monday he will begin a series of strips
associated with what he has seen there -- to appear in his 700 newspapers
worldwide.;    "Nancy Reagan: an Unauthorized Biography" is the fourth in
Kelley's ongoing dissection of the high and mighty (Jacqueline Onassis,
Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra) and is still the best-guarded secret in
publishing. It has been kept most thoroughly under wraps by Simon &amp; Schuster.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Trudeau sent his strips out last week and has been holding his breath ever
since, hoping people in his syndicate will honor "the embargo" stamped on
same, and not tip his hand. Naturally, these comic strips will be
controversial and probably give some editors a few headaches. It won't be the
first time. Trudeau has had his work dropped from time to time because editors
considered his satiric attacks "too much." He himself has never backed off
from examining the Frank Sinatras and Donald Trumps of the world.;   
BEAUTIFUL DEFENSE: Actress Andie MacDowell comes to the defense of her "Green
Card" co-star Gerard Depardieu -- the center of criticism and controversy
because of statements he's allegedly made about having committed rape "too
many times to count" during his youth.;    "How do you pass judgment on a
child?" she says. As far as Depardieu's quotes in the 1978 "Film Comment"
magazine that "the girls wanted to be raped . . . there's really no such thing
as rape . . ." MacDowell believes it was "probably a total misunderstanding.
Gerard loves women so much and he was always so kind and so sweet to me, I
would be very surprised if he really said those things.";    MacDowell, who's
been in demand since 1989's "Sex, Lies and Videotape," had hoped "Green Card"
would be the vehicle to put her over the top. But the backlash against
Depardieu on these shores isn't helping the movie's fortunes.;    Still, she
needn't worry. She's starring opposite John Malkovich in the comedy "Object of
Beauty" due out this month. And she's Bruce Willis' leading lady in the
upcoming big-screen "Hudson Hawk." The former supermodel also just started
shooting the "A Domestic Dilemma" segment of HBO's "Women &amp; Men" trilogy with
Ray Liotta and already has her next feature film assignment lined up. She
starts shooting "Ruby Cairo" for director Graeme Clifford this fall.; From
Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;    BIG-SCREEN SCENE: The
real-life saga of Palm Beach socialite Mollie Wilmont and the Venezuelan
freighter that crashed into her oceanfront property appears to be on its way
to the big screen -- as a break-into-dance style Disney musical, with "Evita"
and "Jesus Christ Superstar" co-creator Tim Rice likely aboard.  </TEXT>
