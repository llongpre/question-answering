   The mob movies ``The Godfather,
Part III'' and ``GoodFellas'' have begun to move in on Academy
Award turf, capturing 12 Golden Globe nominations between them.
   Oscar nominations won't be disclosed until Feb. 13, but
Thursday's Golden Globe selections established the two Mafia dramas
and Kevin Costner's ``Dances With Wolves'' as strong early
favorites.
   ``The Godfather, Part III'' was nominated seven times and
``GoodFellas'' collected five nominations from the membership of
the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.
   In awards already presented, ``GoodFellas'' has been named best
film in year-end voting by film critics associations in New York
and Los Angeles.
   The National Board of Review selected ``Dances With Wolves,''
directed by and starring Costner, the best movie of the year. The
western collected the second most nominations - six - in Golden
Globe voting, including best dramatic motion picture.
   Other films receiving multiple nominations, four apiece, were
``Dick Tracy,'' ``Ghost,'' ``Pretty Woman'' and ``Reversal of
Fortune.''
   The Golden Globes do not carry the prestige of the Oscars, but
in past years have presaged Academy Award nominations fairly
accurately. Trophies will be presented Jan. 19 - the same day Oscar
ballots are mailed.
   The Golden Globes will be broadcast from Beverly Hills by cable
television's TBS.
   The ``Godfather'' sequel was selected for best dramatic motion
picture and received nominations for best actor (Al Pacino),
supporting actor (Andy Garcia), director (Francis Ford Coppola) and
best screenplay (Coppola and Mario Puzo.
   The movie also received nods for original score and original
song, ``Promise Me You'll Remember.''
   Costner was nominated for best actor and best director in his
first directing effort. ``Wolves'' co-star Mary McDonnell drew a
supporting actress nomination.
   ``GoodFellas''' five nominations included best dramatic motion
picture and best director for Martin Scorsese, also honored for
co-writing the movie.
   Unlike the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes divide films in two
categories - drama and musical or comedy.
   In one wacky selection, ``Ghost,'' the enormously popular
tearjerker, was judged in the musical-comedy category. Other
nominees for best musical or comic motion picture were ``Dick
Tracy,'' ``Green Card,'' ``Home Alone'' and ``Pretty Woman.''
   In another peculiar matchup, the 86 foreign press members said
Macaulay Culkin, the 10-year-old star of ``Home Alone,'' and Gerard
Depardieu, the great French actor who stars in ``Green Card,'' will
compete for best actor in a musical or comedy.
   Nominated for dramatic actress were Kathy Bates for ``Misery,''
Anjelica Huston for ``The Grifters,'' Michelle Pfeiffer for ``The
Russia House,'' Susan Sarandon for ``White Palace'' and Joanne
Woodward for ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge.''
   Best dramatic actor nominees, in addition to Costner and Pacino,
included Richard Harris for ``The Field,'' Jeremy Irons for
``Reversal of Fortune'' and Robin Williams for ``Awakenings.''
   Best musical or comic actress selections were Mia Farrow for
``Alice,'' Andie MacDowell for ``Green Card,'' Demi Moore for
``Ghost,'' Julia Roberts for ``Pretty Woman'' and Meryl Streep for
``Postcards From the Edge.''
   Best musical or comic actor competitors include Culkin,
Depardieu, Johnny Depp of ``Edward Scissorhands,'' Richard Gere of
``Pretty Woman'' and Patrick Swayze of ``Ghost.''
   Foreign language film nominees were ``Cyrano de Bergerac,''
``Akira Kurosawa's Dreams,'' ``The Nasty Girl,'' ``Requiem for
Dominic'' and ``Taxi Blues.''
   Screenplay nominees were ``Dances with Wolves,'' ``Reversal of
Fortune,'' ``Avalon,'' ``GoodFellas'' and ``The Godfather Part
III.''
   Golden Globes are also presented in television. Among TV shows,
``L.A. Law'' led with five nominations and director David Lynch's
cult saga, ``Twin Peaks,'' had four.
   ``China Beach,'' the Vietnam War drama, was nominated for best
dramatic series while Dana Delany was nominated for best actress.
The series currently is off the air, but may come back in the
spring.
