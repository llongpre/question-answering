<TEXT>     Today's nominations were shared by such critically acclaimed releases as
"The Grifters," which collected four nominations, and "Cyrano de Bergerac,"
which got five, and such lighter weight box office champs as "Ghost," which
drew five selections, and "The Hunt for Red October," with three.;   
Competing against "Dances With Wolves" and "The Godfather Part III" for best
picture in the March 25 presentations were "Awakenings," "GoodFellas" and, in
one of the biggest surprises of the year, "Ghost.";    The year's biggest hit,
"Home Alone," fared poorly with just two nominations for original score and
original song. The film, which opened in November, has collected $222.2
million to date.;    The eagerly awaited and heavily panned "Bonfire of the
Vanities" was blanked, and Robert Redford's fiasco "Havana" emerged with just
one nomination, for original score.;    Joining Costner for best actor
nominations were Robert De Niro for "Awakenings," Gerard Depardieu in "Cyrano
de Bergerac," Richard Harris in "The Field" and Jeremy Irons in "Reversal of
Fortune.";    Julia Roberts was named in the best actress category for her
depiction of a prostitute in the box office success, "Pretty Woman." Also
nominated in this category were Kathy Bates for "Misery," Angelica Huston for
"The Grifters," Meryl Streep in "Postcards From the Edge" and Joanne Woodward
for "Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bridge.";    Costner, who made his directorial debut in

Ford Coppola for "The Godfather Part III," Martin Scorsese for "GoodFellas,"
Stephen Frears for "The Grifters" and Barbet Schroeder for "Reversal of
Fortune.";    Penny Marshall, whose "Awakenings" collected three nominations,
failed to become the first woman nominated for best director.;    In addition
to Garcia and Pacino, the nominations for best supporting actor were Bruce
Davison in "Longtime Companion," Graham Greene in "Dances With Wolves" and Joe
Pesci in "GoodFellas.";    Comedian Whoopi Goldberg, who played a low-rent
psychic in "Ghost," earned a nomination for best supporting actress. Joining
her were Annette Bening from "The Grifters," Lorraine Bracco in "GoodFellas,"
Diane Ladd in "Wild at Heart" and Mary McDonnell in "Dances With Wolves.";   
Depardieu's "Cyrano de Bergerac" from France was among the best
foreign-language films of the year. Also nominated were Switzerland's "Journey
of Hope," China's "Ju Dou," Germany's "The Nasty Girl" and Italy's "Open
Doors.";    Original screenplay: Woody Allen for "Alice," Barry Levinson's

"Dances With Wolves;" Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese, "GoodFellas;" Donald E.
Westlake, "The Grifters;" and Nicholas Kazan, "Reversal of Fortune.";    No
other film in 25 years has received more than 12 nominations. The dozen for
"Dances With Wolves" in the 63rd annual Oscars matched the nominations for
"Reds" in 1981. "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" in 1965 received 13
nominations.;    So far, "GoodFellas" has won major awards from the National
Society of Film Critics and film critic organizations in New York, Los Angeles
and Boston. All four groups named the film the best movie of the year.;   
Based on the book by Nicholas Pileggi, "GoodFellas" also dominated many
critics' Top 10 year-end lists.;    The National Board of Review selected
"Dances With Wolves" as 1990's best and picked "Cyrano de Bergerac" top
foreign-language film.;    At the Golden Globes, awarded in January, the top
winning films were "Dances With Wolves" and "Green Card.";    Each of the
Academy's branches votes for its peers. Actors nominate actors, directors
nominate directors, and so on. All members vote for best picture. Two hundred
and twenty three feature-length films were eligible this year.;    On Tuesday,
the Academy announced that it was presenting a special achievement award for
visual effects to the futuristic thriller "Total Recall.";    Comedian Billy
Crystal will be host of the awards ceremony at the Shrine Auditorium. Actress
Myrna Loy will receive an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement and comedian
Bob Hope will be among the evening's presenters. It will be Hope's 27th
appearance, an Oscar record.;    Security at this year's Oscar show could be
the toughest in history because of fears of terrorism stemming from the
Persian Gulf War.;    Guests will have to go through metal detectors to enter
an auditorium patrolled by bomb-sniffing dogs. Limousine drivers will face
strict credential rules.  </TEXT>
