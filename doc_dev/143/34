   The candidates all have appeared, and now the
movie world looks forward to a shootout between a Western pioneer
and two bands of modern-day gangsters for the Academy Awards.
   Will Kevin Costner's ``Dances With Wolves'' be the winner?
Consensus thinking favors the epic of a cavalry officer who is
adopted by an Indian tribe. Hollywood admires Costner's courage to
fight for his film against heavy odds: Westerns are out of fashion,
one-third of the dialogue is subtitled, the film runs three hours.
   However, strong competition comes from ``GoodFellas,'' which
traces the rise and fall of a Brooklyn wiseguy. The Martin Scorsese
drama has been scoring with critics' circles awards in New York and
Los Angeles, less so with the ticket-buying public. After 98 days
in release, ``GoodFellas'' has collected a respectable but
unsensational $40 million.
   Paramount Picture's Christmas gift to Corleone fans, ``The
Godfather Part III,'' may also prove a strong contender. A victory
as best picture would provide an unbreakable record; the first two
``Godfathers'' won Hollywood's top prize.
   But more recent history seems to favor ``Dances With Wolves'' to
win as best picture of 1990. Academy voters have opted for
broadscale movies of courage and adventure: ``Ghandi,'' ``Chariots
of Fire,'' ``Out of Africa,'' ``Platoon,'' ``The Last Emperor.''
   Money alone doesn't sway the voters. There is little chance for
important awards for the $100 million-plus moneymakers of the year:
``The Hunt for Red October,'' ``Dick Tracy,'' ``Ghost,'' ``Pretty
Woman,'' ``Die Hard 2,'' ``Total Recall,'' ``Home Alone,'' not to
mention ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.''
   Here's how the nominees for the 1990 Oscar race appear to this
observer:
   - Best Picture: ``Dances With Wolves,'' ``GoodFellas'' and ``The
Godfather Part III'' could be joined by a classic, ``Hamlet'' or
``Cyrano de Bergerac.''
   Penny Marshall's ``Awakenings'' has a strong chance. On a more
frivolous note, ``Postcards From the Edge'' is a possibility.
Longshots include ``Avalon,'' ``The Grifters,'' ``The Sheltering
Sky,'' ``Reversal of Fortune.''
   - Best Actor: Kevin Costner's valiant Westerner seems a certain
nominee, along with Al Pacino's aging Michael Corleone of ``The
Godfather Part III.'' Robin Williams as the warm-hearted doctor in
``Awakenings'' and Jeremy Irons' cold-blooded Claus von Bulow of
``Reversal of Fortune'' also are likely. Robert De Niro could be
nominated for either ``GoodFellas'' or ``Awakenings.'' Longshots:
Danny Glover, ``To Sleep With Anger''; Gerard Depardieu, ``Cyrano
de Bergerac'' or ``Green Card''; Armin Mueller-Stahl, ``Avalon'';
Richard Harris, ``The Field''; Sean Connery, ``The Hunt for Red
October'' or ``The Russia House.''
   Best Actress: Two past winners figure strongly, Joanne Woodward
for ``Mr. and Mrs. Bridge'' and Anjelica Huston for ``The
Grifters'' or ``Witches.'' Susan Sarandon also seems likely for
``White Palace.'' Kathy Bates of ``Misery'' could be nominated in
this category or as supporting actress. Others: Meryl Streep and
Shirley MacLaine, ``Postcards From the Edge''; Mia Farrow,
``Alice''; Julia Roberts, ``Pretty Woman''; Michelle Pfeiffer,
``The Russia House.''
   Best Supporting Actor: Joe Pesci, ``GoodFellas''; Bruce Davison,
``Longtime Companion''; Andy Garcia, ``The Godfather Part III'';
Marlon Brando, ``The Freshman''; Graham Greene, ``Dances With
Wolves''; Hector Elizondo, ``Pretty Woman''; Al Pacino, ``Dick
Tracy''; Alan Arkin, ``Edward Scissorhands.''
   Best Supporting Actress: Dianne Wiest, ``Edward Scissorhands'';
Whoopi Goldberg, ``Ghost'' or ``The Long Walk Home''; Mary
McDonnell, ``Dances With Wolves''; Diane Ladd, ``Wild at Heart'';
Lorraine Bracco, ``GoodFellas''; Joan Plowright, ``Avalon.''
   Best Director: Kevin Costner, ``Dances With Wolves''; Martin
Scorsese, ``GoodFellas''; Francis Ford Coppola, ``The Godfather
Part III''; Penny Marshall, ``Awakenings''; Mike Nichols,
``Postcards From the Edge''; Barbet Schroeder, ``Reversal of
Fortune''; Franco Zeffirelli, ``Hamlet''; Peter Weir, ``Green
Card.''
   The above hopefuls will be culled when the Academy Award
nominations are announced in pre-dawn ceremonies on Feb. 13 in
Beverly Hills. The awards will be presented on March 25 at the
Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.
