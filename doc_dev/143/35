   John Keating is the kind of teacher of which every student
dreamed but rarely encountered. He tickles the ribs, he fires the
mind, he preaches nonconformity. He even instructs his pupils to
rip out the innocuous introduction from a book of poetry.
Obviously, John Keating isn't going to last at a rock-ribbed New
England prep school in the 1960s.
   Robin Williams portrays John Keating in ``Dead Poets Society''
with only a trace of Adrian Cronauer of ``Good Morning, Vietnam.''
While trying to rouse his bored students, he demonstrates how
Shakespeare could be done by Marlon Brando and John Wayne.
Otherwise, he plays it straight-arrow, and he is wonderful.
   ``Dead Poets Society'' itself is wonderful, like a cool oasis
amid the arid summer of sequels. It is that rare comedy-drama that
stimulates the mind as well as the emotions.
   The title may be a turnoff for some folks, but it shouldn't be.
When Keating was a student at the school, he and other freethinkers
formed the society to read poetry and plot against the faculty.
Unbeknownst to him, his own students revive the custom in an
obvious collision course with the authorities.
   The film focuses more on the boys than on their teacher, and
they are portrayed with true insight. The central figure is Neil
Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), who yearns to be an actor despite his
father's stern opposition. Neil's roommate is Todd Anderson (Ethan
Hawke) who is so withdrawn he can't speak up in class.
   With their teacher's inspiration, Neil decides to defy his
father, and Todd comes out of his shell. There is a terrific scene
in which Williams forces Todd to recite a poem he had written. The
other boys in the cast are equally well drawn; they talk and behave
as you would expect rich boys of the period to.
   Australian Peter Weir, who captured the American scene in
``Witness,'' does it again in ``Dead Poets Society.'' His direction
of the young actors is brilliant, and he keeps Williams on a tight
rein. Tom Schulman's script is literate and clever, veering to the
ultimate tragedy. The ending may jar some viewers unless they note
the portents along the way.
   Robin Williams should be applauded not only for his performance
but for taking a role that is not a star turn in a film that may
have to hunt for an audience. A major factor in the film is John
Seale's gorgeous photography of the New England scene (actually
Delaware)
   A Touchstone Picture produced by Steven Haft, Paul Junger Witt
and Tony Thomas, ``Dead Poet's Society'' is the biggest movie treat
of the year so far. Rated PG for language and intensity. Running
time: 126 minutes.
