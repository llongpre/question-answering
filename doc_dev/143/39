Judith Weir's The Vanishing Bride groom had its American premiere in St
Louis this month. Scott Bergeson conducted. There was a pretty good young
cast. Francesca Zambello produced, and Alison Chitty designed; they stressed
the narrative plainness of the tales rather than the strangeness of the
actions related (a bridegroom lured into fairyland, a maiden wooed by the
devil). 'The magic,' Weir wrote of the Scottish folktale collection that was
her main source, 'lies in the tension between extraordinary stories and the
ordinary people who tell them.' There was little magic in the staging, but
much in the music.
This is an uncommonly skilful score - lucid, economical, cleverly designed,
imaginative in sound. Stravinsky inspires it; Messiaen and Britten lend
touches. What I missed at a first hearing was much emotional engagement;
perhaps that will emerge when the sheer dexterity of planning and writing no
longer dazzles.
The next day, Colin Graham's new pro duction of Britten's Midsummer Night's
Dream was electric. This opera's structure, too, is very carefully planned,
almost schematic in its motivic assignments of sonorities, harmonies, and
types of melodic motion. Yet it is not only the most beautiful of Britten's
scores but also - in such production as this - one of the most powerfully
affecting. Derek McClane's decor showed a world reversed: an upside-down
city skyline in the distance, trees descending from the flies. Glow-worms
glittered the stage. The lovely, enchanted wood could have been near Athens,
near London, or in New York, where Central Park has lately been the scene of
passionate murder and brutal rape.
Cruder modern stagings of the play, building crassly on Peter Brook's
vigorous and famous production, abjure prettiness, stress the
donkey-mounts-lady sexuality and the cruelty. Some productions of the opera,
on the other hand, have been merely decorative. Graham's holds the romantic
and the dark aspects in balance; after pangs as keen as those in Figaro, a
reconciliation equally moving is reached.
Robert Spano conducted a fine-grained instrumental performance. Derek Lee
Ragin was an exact and exquisite Oberon. There was an able young cast;
Thomas Barrett, as Bottom, was the outstanding singer. The Dream is less
often heard in this country than Albert Herring, The Turn of the Screw and
Death in Venice (while Peter Grimes and Billy Budd are the big-company
modern staples). This production should bring it forward in favour.
Graham, the artistic director of the company, has - in reaction against the
over-decoration of our day - commissioned a new, permanent back-wall for the
St Louis theatre. Before it, the actors are required to carry the burden of
the drama. 'Shakespeare had no scenery,' he writes, and 'many productions
that seem wonderfully exciting in the rehearsal room are compromised, even
wrecked, by the addition of scenery onstage.' Shakespeare, one might retort,
was not writing opera - that multi-media form of dramatic communication in
which decor has often been a essential element, one on which composers
counted.
The wall, designed by McClane, is a handsome, architecturally interesting
structure, built apparently of solid brick (though in fact of glass fibre).
It closed McClane's own Dream settings effectively. Miss Chitty veiled it
from view in the Bridegroom. It served Butterfly and Il Turco in Italia less
well, and I can imagine future designers finding it as intractable as the
Teatro Olimpico's handsome fixed set (built in 1585 for Oedipus) is for most
19th and 20th-century pieces.
*****
Butterfly was this year's standard opera, played nine times (against five
Bridegrooms and five Dreams). The Brescia score was used. Graham's
production was careful, but the principals, Guiping Deng and Rick Moon, did
not have pleasing voices, and Stephen Lord's conducting was summary. For
once, there was no Mozart; Rossini's 'Mozartian' Turco was given: the Turco
libretto, set by Seydelmann, played in Vienna in 1789 and evidently
influenced that of Cos fan tutte; Cos, in turn, played at La Scala in 1814
while Rossini was composing his version (with the Fiordiligi and Guglielmo
as his Fiorilla and Selim).
Little was Mozartian - or Rossinian - about the St Louis performance,
however. Since it was done in my English translation, I'll not review it.
Enough, perhaps, to report that the opera was presented as 'Prosdocimo's
Dream,' and that the rival ladies donned boxing gloves in the first-act
finale while the chorus erected a ring around them.
