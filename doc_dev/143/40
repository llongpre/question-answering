THIS WEEK'S MOVIES 
</P>
<P>
Two very good but very different movies from last year make their video debut 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"Dead Poets Society" (Touchstone, $89.95, PG) stars Robin Williams as an 
unconventional teacher at a private boys' school in 1959. Directed by Peter 
Weir, the funny and moving film shows -- as did "Stand and Deliver" -- how much 
difference a teacher can make when he or she is as daring as caring. 
</P>
<P>
"The Abyss" (CBS/Fox, $89.98, PG-13). You may be disappointed with the ending 
of this special-effects thriller, but chances are you'll enjoy the underwater 
trip that precedes it. Directed with dazzle by James Cameron ("The 
Terminator"). 
</P>
<P>
Other films fresh on tape: 
</P>
<P>
"The Pajama Game" (1957) and "Damn Yankees" (1958) both star Doris Day, both 
were co-directed by George Abbott and Stanley Donen, both feature exciting 
choreography by Bob Fosse, and both are colorful and lively versions of hit 
Broadway musicals. They're $59.95 each from Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"The Incredible Mr. Limpet" (1964) gave Don Knotts his strangest role (yes, 
even stranger than Barney) as a bookkeeper who turns into a, gulp, fish -- who, 
gulp again, becomes a war hero. The whimsical mix of live action and animation 
is no "Mary Poppins," but pretty charming all the same. Also $59.95 from 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
"Chocolat" (1988, PG-13), "The Music Teacher" (1988, PG) and "Murmur of the 
Heart" (1971, R) are three notable foreign films from Orion ($79.98 each). All 
three feature easy-to-read yellow captions. 
</P>
<P>
"Night Ambush" (VidAmerica, $39.98), originally released in Britain in 1956 as 
"Ill Met By Moonlight," a taut World War II thriller, was the last film on 
which the famous "Archers" team of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger worked 
together. 
</P>
<P>
"The Keys to the Kingdom" (1944), "A Man Called Peter" (1955) and "The Story of 
Ruth" all featured big Hollywood budgets and plenty of emotional 
self-sacrificing in the name of religion (Christian, of course), but not much 
else to recommend them. They're $29.98 each from CBS/Fox. 
</P>
<P>
"Fear Strikes Out" (1957) is a strong film depicting the battle baseball star 
Jimmy Piersall (Anthony Perkins) fought with mental illness. "Hell Is for 
Heroes" (1962) is a fairly decent WWII drama with Steve McQueen and Bobby 
Darin. Both are only $14.95 from Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
"Cookie" (Warner, $89.95, R) is one of the two crumby "comedies" director Susan 
Seidelman blessed us with last year (the other was "She-Devil"). This one has 
Emily Lloyd, Peter Falk, Dianne Wiest and Brenda Vaccaro in the tale of a teen 
and her racketeer father. 
</P>
<P>
OTHER NEW VIDEOS 
</P>
<P>
CBS/Fox has just released four volumes containing two "Twilight Zone" episodes 
each. These are the original, b&amp;w shows from the '50s and '60s, introduced 
by Rod Serling. Each volume sells for $14.98. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all, folks. MGM/UA has some more hourlong collections of those 
fantastic Warner Bros. cartoons from the '30s and '40s: "Daffy Duck and 
Company," "Porky Pig and Company" and "Bugs Vs. Elmer." They're $14.95 each.
