   The bittersweet ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' carried off a leading nine Academy Award nominations
Wednesday as Oscar voters passed over box-office blockbusters and
maverick movies with equal abandon.
   ``Daisy,'' which traces the relationship over the decades
between a testy Jewish widow and her tolerant black chauffeur in
the South, drew nominations for best picture and actors Morgan
Freeman, Jessica Tandy and Dan Aykroyd.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' director Oliver Stone's account
of Ron Kovic's painful passage from blind patriotism to unselfish
protest by way of a Vietnam injury that left him a paraplegic, got
eight nominations, including best picture.
   Also nominated in the top picture category by the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were ``Dead Poets Society,''
``Field of Dreams'' and ``My Left Foot.''
   ``This is truly one of the happiest and most triumphant moments
of my life,'' said Kovic.
   Among other multiple nominees, ``Glory,'' a look at an all-black
regiment in the Civil War, and ``My Left Foot,'' the story of an
indomitable Irish artist with cerebral palsy, each earned five
nominations.
   ``The Abyss,'' ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,'' ``Dead
Poets Society'' and ``The Fabulous Baker Boys'' grabbed four
nominations each.
   Oscar voters largely ignored many of the year's highest-grossing
titles, as ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,''
``Lethal Weapon 2,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Look Who's
Talking'' captured only five nominations combined.
   A number of modestly budgeted, independently minded efforts also
were given short shrift, including the critically embraced
``Drugstore Cowboy,'' which was shut out.
   ``Do the Right Thing,'' while landing on numerous critics' Top
10 lists, snared just two nominations, and ``sex, lies and
videotape,'' one of the best-received independent films of the
decade, generated just one.
   For the second time in two years, Academy voters did not
nominate the year's most acclaimed documentary. ``Roger &amp; Me,''
filmmaker Michael Moore's satirical perspective on General Motors
and the people of Flint, Mich., was overlooked.
   In 1989, the Academy did not nominate Errol Morris' ``The Thin
Blue Line,'' the movie which set convicted murderer Randall Dale
Adams free.
   The awards will be presented on March 26. The show will be seen
on ABC.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' was nominated for Tom Cruise's
lead performance as Kovic, for adapted screenplay, for Stone's
direction, cinematography, editing, original score and sound.
   Joining Freeman and Cruise in the race for best actor were
Kenneth Branagh, the star, director and adaptor of Shakespeare's
``Henry V,'' Daniel Day-Lewis, who played artist Christy Brown in
``My Left Foot,'' and comedian Robin Williams, as an unconventional
teacher in a very conventional school in ``Dead Poets Society.''
   Isabelle Adjani, featured in France's ``Camille Claudel'' as an
impassioned sculptress, was perhaps the most surprising nominee for
best actress.
   Miss Adjani will compete against Miss Tandy, who played the
widow Miss Daisy; Pauline Collins, who starred as a frustrated
British housewife who finds happiness on a Greek isle in ``Shirley
Valentine''; Jessica Lange, who defends an alleged Nazi war
criminal who also is her father in ``Music Box,'' and Michelle
Pfeiffer, the chanteuse of ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   British stage star Branagh joins a select list of Oscar nominees
by being recognized for both starring in and directing ``Henry V.''
Woody Allen (``Annie Hall''), Warren Beatty (``Heaven Can Wait,''
``Reds'') and Orson Welles (``Citizen Kane'') are among the few who
have shared the dual acting-directing recognition for the same film.
   In addition to Branagh, the nominees for best director were
Stone for ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Allen for ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' Peter Weir for ``Dead Poets Society'' and Jim
Sheridan for ``My Left Foot.''
   Belying a tradition that films released late in the year are
favored in the Oscars, ``Field of Dreams'' was released April 21
and ``Dead Poets Society'' June 2.
   ``Field of Dreams,'' writer and director Phil Alden Robinson's
magical tale of a man who rediscovers the past on a Iowa baseball
field, also was nominated for best adapted screenplay.
   ``We got letters from people saying the film had changed their
lives, that it had brought families back together. We couldn't have
asked for more than that,'' Robinson said.
