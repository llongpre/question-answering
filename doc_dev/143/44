   LOS ANGELES -- William Morris Agency, which has had a mass
exodus of clients and top agents in recent weeks, announced a
series of top-level executive changes designed to bolster its
ranks from within the agency.
   Jerry Katzman, formerly executive vice president,
world-wide head of television, was named president. He
succeeds Norman Brokaw, who continues as chief executive
officer and assumes the additional post of chairman from Lou
Weiss. Mr. Weiss will serve as chairman emeritus and continue
to be in charge of New York operations.

   Some in the industry had expected the Hollywood talent
agency to bring in an outside powerhouse to take the helm.
"They need to do something that will make a statement," one
studio head said. "They need a very big change."
   Recently five top agents left William Morris, four to join
rival International Creative Management. William Morris also
has lost roughly 20 clients to ICM, including major stars
such as actresses Julia Roberts, Angelica Houston and Andie
MacDowell.
   Industry executives have whispered that ICM, in its effort
to compete with Creative Artists Agency, has been raiding the
ranks of William Morris by offering agents significantly
higher salaries. In winning the agents, the agency frequently
wins their prestigious clients as well.
   But William Morris also lost an agent, John Ptak, to
Creative Artists yesterday. It isn't yet clear whether his
clients, including actor Gerald Depardieu and director Peter
Weir, will follow.
   "They are losing a lot of their motion picture
department," one agent said.
   William Morris yesterday attempted to downplay the exodus
from its ranks. "This kind of thing has gone on for years.
This is nothing new. ICM has lost quite a few people over the
past few years, and people have left CAA, despite the rumors
that no one leaves," said Larry Auerbach, executive vice
president of William Morris.
   Mr. Auerbach also said he doesn't believe the rumor that
ICM is winning William Morris agents by doubling their
salaries. However, he says, "in some cases the salaries have
reached quite a high level."
