<P>
Andie MacDowell, the repressed young wife in "sex, lies, and videotape," 
flinches at the possibility of becoming a superstar. 
</P>
<P>
"I like doing normal things, like going to Disney World with my family. 
</P>
<P>
And it would be terrible not to be able to because of fame," MacDowell said in 
the November issue of Glamour magazine. 
</P>
<P>
MacDowell, who was a top model before landing her first role in "Greystoke," 
lives in a Victorian house in Upstate New York with her husband, model Paul 
Qualley; son Justin, 4, and daughter Rainey, 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
If she weren't an actress, she said, she would be "a mother and a gardener." 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a huge vegetable garden, everything from arugula to broccoli, to corn 
to sunflowers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She has two new movies coming out soon: "The Object of Beauty" with John 
Malkovich and "Green Card" with Gerard Depardieu.
