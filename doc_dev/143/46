<TEXT>     Since the Oscar race is, for all intents and purposes, a closed affair
(open only to dues-paying Academy members who vote in their respective
categories and for best picture), each studio's mission is clear: Bug or
impress as many voting members as possible in the hopes that they'll select
your picture, your star, your director to be among those nominees announced
Wednesday at a sunrise affair in Beverly Hills.;    The campaigning, as usual,
runs the gamut from extravagant to absurd. Such pictures as "Hamlet,"
"Postcards from the Edge," "Reversal of Fortune" and "Avalon" may have it for
sheer number of ads. Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment company takes it
for chutzpah. Would you believe it's pushing "Arachnophobia" for best picture,
best actor (Jeff Daniels) and best supporting actor (John Goodman)?;    Not to
be outdone in the pie-in-the-sky department, Disney is pushing Tom Selleck as
best actor ("Three Men and a Little Lady"), 20th Century Fox has flagged
little Macaulay Culkin ("Home Alone") and Bruce Willis ("Die Hard 2"), and
Tri-Star wants no one to forget Arnie Schwarzenegger's sensitive work (in
"Total Recall").;    Why, there's even a full-page testimonial to Robert
Redford in the year's biggest stiff, a little something called "Havana.";   
To be fair, studios are often contractually obliged to take out ads singing
their clients' praises. That came out when Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman
asked Columbia Pictures not to mount a promised campaign for "Ishtar.";    The
year's most prophetic ad? A silhouette of a tired, spiritually depleted Al
Pacino as Michael Corleone in "The Godfather, Part III." The ad is meant to
remind Academy members to vote as they did in '72 and '74 and make "III" a
best-picture contender. It could backfire. It could remind members how
sluggishly the Francis Coppola saga performed at the box office.;    Not all
the studio hype is worthless. It augurs well for Wednesday's finalists that
Sidney Lumet's "Q&amp;A" is getting a big push (particularly Nick Nolte's
rogue-cop lead). Other pleasant surprises: Miramax's ad for Paul Newman's
anything-but-lovable father in "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge"; Samuel Goldwyn's
campaign for Bruce Davison in "Longtime Companion" (spurred on, no doubt, by
Davison's Golden Globe and critics' circles wins); and Cinecom's belief in
Peter Falk as a supporting actor possible for "Tune in Tomorrow." (While we'd
love to pat Columbia on the back for standing by Annie Potts in Peter
Bogdanovich's hastily dismissed "Texasville," the studio's logo is nowhere to
be found on the ad, leading us to presume Potts or Bogdanovich financed the
reminder.);    All told, there are 223 features eligible to be nominated
Wednesday. To qualify, you needed to project your film on a Los Angeles County
screen for seven consecutive days. And it had to be shown in 35mm or 70mm and
have opened prior to midnight, Dec. 31.;    So how will the Academy vote in
the preliminary round (Oscars will be awarded March 25)?;    As usual, you can
expect it to favor the year's prestige productions. Translation: "Reversal of
Fortune," "Dances with Wolves," "Avalon," "Hamlet," and "The Hunt for Red
October" will emerge multiple nominees. And just to prove they don't ignore
the critics, Academy voters will also remember -- in the best-picture category
-- the icily beautiful "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" and the hilariously dark
"GoodFellas.";    So who would we back, were we given the vote?;    Glad you
asked. Here are our picks in the major categories. Remember, these are the
films and talents we think should be nominated, not those that will in fact
get the nod.; (box) Best Picture;    (check) "Dances with Wolves";    (check)
"After Dark, My Sweet";    (check) "Vincent &amp; Theo";    (check) "Mr. and Mrs.
Bridge";    (check) "GoodFellas";    Don't expect to find Robert Altman's
portrait of the tormented Vincent van Gogh or James Foley's modern-day film
noir, "After Dark," in this category; the Academy will go with "Hamlet,"
"Cyrano de Bergerac," "Reversal of Fortune" or "Avalon." The year's cash cows
"Ghost" and "Pretty Woman" will be slighted. Ditto Coppola's new Corleone
saga.; (box) Best Actor;    (check) Nick Nolte ("Q&amp;A");    (check) Danny
Glover ("To Sleep with Anger");    (check) Jeremy Irons ("Reversal of
Fortune");    (check) Jason Patric ("After Dark, My Sweet");    (check) Gerard
Depardieu ("Cyrano");    Oscar sometimes surprises us and smiles on subtitled
performances. France's much-revered Depardieu has an excellent shot in this
category. So, too, do Irons and Nolte. Glover, who gave the year's best
performance by an American actor, will be overlooked because no one saw "To
Sleep with Anger." Patric's exceptional work as a punchy patsy was too
downbeat to score votes. Al Pacino ("Godfather III"), Sean Connery ("The
Russia House"), Robin Williams and Robert De Niro (both in "Awakenings") have
been longtime Academy favorites and could be this year as well.; (box) Best
Actress;    (check) Jessica Lange ("Men Don't Leave");    (check) Laura Dern
("Wild at Heart");    (check) Mia Farrow ("Alice");    (check) Joanne Woodward
("Mr. and Mrs. Bridge");    (check) Helen Mirren ("The Cook, the Thief, His
Wife &amp; Her Lover");    What's shaping up as the year's most interesting race
will be decided by the Glenn Close-Meryl Streep Factor. Will Close again luck
out with a supporting turn and be nominated for "Hamlet" or "Reversal of
Fortune"? Will Streep make the cut with her breezy performance in "Postcards
From the Edge?" Dern and Mirren aren't even in the running; Kathy Bates
("Misery"), Anjelica Huston ("The Grifters") and Michelle Pfeiffer ("The
Russia House") are. Only Woodward, who won in 1957 for "The Three Faces of
Eve," is a sure thing -- to be nominated, and indeed to cart off the trophy.;
(box) Best Supporting Actor;    (check) Bruce Dern ("After Dark, My Sweet");  
 (check) Fred Ward ("Miami Blues");    (check) Alan Arkin ("Edward
Scissorhands");    (check) Graham Greene ("Dances with Wolves");    (check)
Jon Polito ("Miller's Crossing");    Once again, an embarrassment of riches in
this category. Only Greene, we predict, will make Oscar's cut. He'll be joined
by Ron Silver ("Reversal of Fortune"), Andy Garcia ("Godfather III's" best
hope for a win), Peter Falk ("Tune in Tomorrow"), Joe Mantegna ("Alice"), Al
Pacino ("Dick Tracy") or -- the two favorites -- Bruce Davison ("Longtime
Companion") and Joe Pesci ("GoodFellas").; (box) Best Supporting Actress;   
(check) Lorraine Bracco ("GoodFellas");    (check) Glenn Close ("Reversal of
Fortune");    (check) Billie Whitelaw ("The Krays");    (check) Winona Ryder
("Mermaids");    (check) Dianne Wiest ("Edward Scissorhands");    This is
where Close belongs, but if she lands here, she'll muddy Bracco's inside
track. Madonna ("Dick Tracy") should be a strong contender, but won't be;
Shirley MacLaine ("Postcards From the Edge") shouldn't be a finalist, but will
be. Academy members will take care of the "Ghost" conundrum (it made money but
isn't very good) by nominating Whoopi Goldberg's flustered spiritualist.;
(box) Best Director;    (check) Kevin Costner ("Dances with Wolves");   
(check) Martin Scorsese ("GoodFellas");    (check) James Foley ("After Dark,
My Sweet");    (check) James Ivory ("Mr. and Mrs. Bridge");    (check) Robert
Altman ("Vincent &amp; Theo");    This category always brings controversy when a
best-film nominee's director is overlooked. The Academy will go with Costner,
Scorsese and Ivory, and replace Foley and industry maverick Altman with Barbet
Schroeder ("Reversal of Fortune"), Coppola ("Godfather III"), previous winner
Barry Levinson ("Avalon") or Franco Zeffirelli ("Hamlet"). The statue, we all
know, belongs at long last to Scorsese, but few will complain if Costner pulls
an upset.; (box) Best Original Screenplay;    (check) Bruce Joel Rubin
("Jacob's Ladder");    (check) Philip Ridley ("The Krays");    (check) Peter
Weir ("Green Card");    (check) Andrew Bergman ("The Freshman");    (check)
Peter Greenaway ("The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover");    Academy
members have their work cut out for them here. Most of last year's best films
were pulled from books or plays. They'll probably nominate Joel Rubin's lesser
"Ghost," Woody Allen's inconsequential "Alice," Levinson's self-promotional
"Avalon" and J.F. Lawton's severely gutted "Pretty Woman."; (box) Best
Screenplay Adaptation;    (check) Nicholas Pileggi, Martin Scorsese
("GoodFellas");    (check) Charles Burnett ("To Sleep with Anger");    (check)
Michael Blake ("Dances with Wolves");    (check) Ruth Prawer Jhabvala ("Mr.
and Mrs. Bridge");    (check) Nicholas Kazan ("Reversal of Fortune");    The
big contenders here will probably be William Goldman's adaptation of Stephen
King's "Misery," Frank Pierson's and Alan Pakula's uninspired "Presumed
Innocent" and Carrie Fisher's trivialization of her own best-selling
"Postcards From the Edge." Tom Stoppard's ingenious reworking of John le
Carre's "The Russia House" also will be nominated.; (box) Best Cinematography;
   (check) Vittorio Storaro ("The Sheltering Sky");    (check) Dean Semler
("Dances with Wolves");    (check) Jean Lepine ("Vincent &amp; Theo");    (check)
Michael Ballhaus ("GoodFellas");    (check) Gordon Willis ("The Godfather,
Part III");    Whether Storaro is nominated for his work on "The Sheltering
Sky" or "Dick Tracy" will say a lot about the mood of the Academy. Will they
favor comic-strip escapism or artfully rendered landscapes? No one will
quibble about Semler's inclusion for the majestic "Dances," but Lepine will be
overlooked in favor of either Pierre Lhomme ("Cyrano") or Oliver Stapleton
("The Grifters"). If Willis is snubbed, Coppola and company can stay home
Oscar night.; (box) Best Score;    (check) Gabriel Yared ("Vincent &amp; Theo");  
 (check) Ryuichyi Sakamoto ("The Sheltering Sky");    (check) Elmer Bernstein
("The Grifters");    (check) Jerry Goldsmith ("The Russia House");    (check)
Richard Robbins ("Mr. and Mrs. Bridge");    Danny Elfman also is in the
running for "Edward Scissorhands" and "Dick Tracy." He'll be nominated for
"Edward S." because the flatfooted fantasy didn't perform as expected at the
box office. Jean-Claude Petit could also be a nominee, provided the Academy
decides to treat "Cyrano" as it did Ingmar Bergman's "Fanny &amp; Alexander" and
allow it to break out of the confining foreign-language category.; (box) Best
Foreign Language Film;    (check) "Ay, Carmela!" (Spain);    (check) "Song of
Exile" (Taiwan);    (check) "Cyrano de Bergerac" (France);    (check) "The
Nasty Girl" (Germany);    (check) "Taxi Blues" (USSR);    Why these titles
among the record 37 submitted from around the globe? Simple. They received the
most press and festival display.  </TEXT>
