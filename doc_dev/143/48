WEIR PUMPS has been awarded four orders worth Pounds 15m from the oil
industry in the Middle East, India and Canada.
The biggest order has been placed by ADCO (Abu Dhabi Co) for three on-shore
oilfields in the United Arab Emirates.
Weir will supply 28 multi-stage horizontal split-casing water injection
pumps and 29 Mather and Platt motors. The pumps will be made from special
austenitic stainless steel, cast in-house at the Manchester foundry.
The company will also provide 21 pumpsets to the Bab field, three to Bu-Hasa
and four to Sahil.
Elsewhere in the Gulf, Kuwait Oil has ordered four firewater pumps for the
Mina-Al-Ahmadi refinery.
In India, Weir is to supply all the major pumping equipment to ONGC Neelan's
offshore development under a deal signed with Korean contractor Hyundai
Heavy Industries.
The job involves 14 units spread over four ranges, including five seawater
injection pumps.
In Canada, Weir will provide three seawater injection skids to the Hibernia
project offshore Newfoundland.
