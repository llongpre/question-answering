   Arizona Commerce Bank said that Thomas C. Weir resigned as chairman, president and chief executive officer effective Sept. 30. 

   Mr. Weir said in a statement that he is resigning to take another job, but he declined to identify his new employer. 

   The bank said its directors "will meet soon" to decide upon a successor for Mr. Weir. 

   The posts of president and chief executive of Arizona Commerce have had some unusual turnover this year. 

   In March, Donald B. Anderson Jr., who had held the posts since August 1986, resigned for personal reasons. 
In April, the bank named Joseph A. Mano III as Mr. Anderson's successor. 
But Mr. Mano's appointment was withdrawn before he could take office because, acording to Mr. Weir, Mr. Mano hadn't disclosed the circumstances under which he left his previous job with a Northern California bank. 

   Mr. Weir, who had held only the post of chairman, was named to the additional jobs of president and chief executive in May.
