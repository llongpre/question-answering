<LEADPARA>  The San Jose Police Department is turning high-tech up another notch with the
introduction of a hand-held computer that may change the way officers write
their reports.;    Instead of using pencils and paper, police soon will be
able to flip open a battery-run gadget that resembles the Etch-A-Sketch
children's toy to enter reports on a computer screen, according to Officer
Tony Weir, of the department's Systems Development Unit.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It's Etch-A-Sketch with a brain," Weir said.;    San Jose -- which 15
years ago was among the first departments to put computer terminals in police
cars -- will be the first law enforcement agency in the country to experiment
with the device, called a Grid Pad.;    Later this month, the department will
start a nine-month pilot project to test the Grid Pad -- an IBM PC-compatible
rig that allows officers to write reports directly on a screen with a pen or
stylus. The reports are stored on a small memory card in the Grid Pad, which
then converts an officer's handwriting into typed form. The information can
later be printed out.;    The hand-held pad is the first step in a proposed
new records-keeping system that eventually may include a main-frame computer
to store and process police information.;    Under the fully equipped "record
management process," explained Weir, officers would remove the memory cards
from their Grid Pad at the end of the day and place them in the main computer,
which would index and distribute reports.;    Given the time and manpower it
now takes to compile and process reports by hand, Weir said, the pad's $3,200
price tag may prove well worth the expense.;    "This," said Weir, "could
reduce all of that to a matter of minutes.";    During the first weeks of the
demonstration project, some desk officers will use the Grid Pads to record
minor incidents and missing persons reports from residents who come to the
police administration building. Later on, a few officers in the field will use
the pads to record offenses and accidents and to issue citations.;    Since
the department does not yet have a main-frame computer, Weir said, the Grid
Pad will be plugged into a laser printer, which will kick out paper copies of
reports.;    Designed and manufactured by the Grid Systems Corp. of Fremont,
the Grid Pad has been in production for about a year. It is now being tried by
some airline companies and a supermarket chain, said Weir, in addition to San
Jose police.  </TEXT>
