In the current funding climate, the Cheltenham International Festival of
Music deserves a party just for surviving to have a 50th birthday. Ticket
sales this year are looking good enough to suggest confidence in the future
 -a tribute to John Manduell, who retires as programme director this year
after no less than 25 years in the job.
A festival which has spent half its life under the leadership of one man is
likely to have a distinct profile, as Cheltenham indeed does. Together with
Aldeburgh, it is one of the two UK summer music festivals with an emphasis
on living composers. Perhaps the spa town gentility of Cheltenham has always
tended to favour the kind of new music that is unlikely to offend, but that
matters less these days than it used to.
In the 1960s music had to be difficult to be accorded serious study. Now the
user-friendly composer has become fashionable. Alongside minimalists like
Glass and Adams, Cheltenham's favoured composers have started to sound quite
gritty. Michael Berkeley and Judith Weir (both have had operas premiered at
the festival in recent years) are most in evidence, Berkeley because he is
due to take over as Manduell's successor next year.
In the case of Judith Weir,
the festival offers the opportunity to catch up on a couple of orchestral
scores commissioned and first performed by foreign orchestras. Music,
Untangled forms part of the closing concert on July 17; Heroic Strokes of
the Bow, which started life in 1992 with the chamber-sized Westdeutsche
Sinfonia, was included in the BBC Symphony Orchestra's programme last
weekend.
Like everything by Judith Weir, the piece says what it wants to say and no
more. It lasts about 15 minutes, starting with massed violin bow strokes to
reflect the title and proceeding to further distinct groups of ideas, which
do not so much develop as occasionally collide with each other.
The work was inspired by a blue painting by Klee, but Weir says she feels
that it has turned out more a shade of grainy dark green. I cannot claim to
have heard either of these colours in the music. What is present is a desire
to make
every scrap of material tell in
the way that Stravinsky use to, for example in the Symphony in Three
Movements.
Weir's score loses its sense of direction in the middle, but revives towards
the end with statements that build up a feeling of cumulative power, of
having set a goal and achieved it.
For this performance she had the right performers, but the wrong venue.
Andrew Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra had prepared the music
diligently to give it the exactness that it needs, but the resonant acoustic
of Cheltenham Town Hall did its best to undo
their good work.
Similarly, there seemed to be a lot of detail carefully rehearsed in Holst's
The Planets after the interval, if only we could have heard more of it.
The festival continues with opera and ballet, more concerts, and a complete
cycle of the Beethoven String Quartets.
