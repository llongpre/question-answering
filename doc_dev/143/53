<P>
Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather Part III," Kevin Costner's "Dances With 
Wolves" and such mass-appeal hits as "Dick Tracy," "Ghost" and "Pretty Woman" 
led the nominations for the annual Golden Globe Awards for motion pictures 
announced Thursday morning in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Although the nominations were widely spread among 32 movies, it was "Godfather 
Part III," with nods in seven categories, that topped the list. 
</P>
<P>
On the television side, NBC's "L.A. Law" led with five nominations, while ABC's 
"Twin Peaks" -- which was mostly snubbed by the TV industry's Emmy Awards -- 
took four. The widely acclaimed "The Civil War" received no nominations because 
there is no documentary category, a Golden Globes spokesman said. And Fox 
Television's highly popular "The Simpsons" was shut out completely. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globes are regarded by some in the entertainment industry as a 
weather vane for the Oscars, even though there are only 86 voting members in 
the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., the Globes' governing body. The Golden 
Globes will be awarded on Jan. 19, during a telecast by Turner Broadcasting 
System. (The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences' Academy Award 
nominations are due Feb. 13 and will be presented March 25.) 
</P>
<P>
The 86 members representing 46 countries, also nominated "Dances With Wolves" 
in six categories, "GoodFellas" in five and "Dick Tracy," "Ghost," "Pretty 
Woman" and "Reversal of Fortune" in four each. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros., which released "Reversal of Fortune" and "GoodFellas," led motion 
picture distribution companies with 12 nominations. Walt Disney Pictures, which 
released "Dick Tracy" and "Pretty Woman," and Paramount Pictures, which 
released "Godfather III" and "Ghost," shared 11 nominations each for a 
second-place tie. 
</P>
<P>
The strong showing by Martin Scorsese's "GoodFellas," follows its double 
victory earlier this month among the Los Angeles and New York film critics 
groups as best picture. That factor, plus the even stronger showings in the 
Globe contest for best movie drama by "Godfather III" and "Dances With Wolves," 
is sure to draw attention to that Globe category as an Oscar indicator. Also 
nominated in that category are "Reversal of Fortune" and "Avalon." 
</P>
<P>
The tightness of the dramatic film competition is further seen in the 
best-director category. With the exception of Barry Levinson's work for his 
personal story of an immigrant family in "Avalon," the four other nominees for 
best motion picture -- drama all received nominations for their directors: 
Coppola, Costner, Scorsese and Barbet Schroeder for "Reversal of Fortune." The 
fifth nominee for best director is Bernardo Bertolucci for "The Sheltering 
Sky." 
</P>
<P>
Coppola's widely awaited "Godfather" sequel to the first two Oscar-winning 
films, garnered nominations for himself as director and as co-writer of the 
screenplay with Mario Puzo. Al Pacino, who portrays godfather Michael Corleone, 
was nominated for best actor, and Andy Garcia, who has won rave reviews for his 
performance as Corleone's nephew and godfather successor, was nominated for 
best supporting actor. 
</P>
<P>
The large showing by "Godfather III" comes following a special screening that 
Paramount Pictures set up for members of the foreign press on Dec. 12 in 
Westwood, hours before the rest of the media was allowed to see the film. 
Coppola himself attended the foreign press showing. 
</P>
<P>
"Dances With Wolves," Costner's frontier epic about native Americans, earned 
him nominations for best actor and best director, plus a supporting actress 
nomination for Mary McDonnell as the Sioux-raised woman who serves as a bridge 
between Costner and the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Pacino is in the unusual situation of being nominated not only for best actor 
as the Mafia chieftain, but also in the supporting actor category for his 
underworld comic role in "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Pacino and Costner, the other nominees for best actor in a drama are 
Richard Harris for "The Field," Jeremy Irons for "Reversal of Fortune" and 
Robin Williams for "Awakenings." Williams' "Awakenings" co-star, Robert De 
Niro, was overlooked. De Niro, also was ignored for his starring role in 
"GoodFellas," as was another highly praised performance in that film by Ray 
Liotta. 
</P>
<P>
Best actress nominees for a dramatic film are Kathy Bates in "Misery," Anjelica 
Huston in "The Grifters," Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Russia House," Susan 
Sarandon in "White Palace" and Joanne Woodward for "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
In the musical or comedy category for best picture, the nominees include some 
of the biggest grossing films of the year, "Ghost," "Pretty Woman," "Home 
Alone" and "Dick Tracy," as well as the just-released "Green Card." None of the 
year's action/tough-guy pictures, such as "Rocky V," "Total Recall" or "Die 
Hard 2," showed up among the Globe nominations. 
</P>
<P>
In the competition for best actor in a musical or comedy, 10-year-old Macaulay 
Culkin, the besieged kid in "Home Alone," is pitted against such major names as 
Gerard Depardieu in "Green Card," Johnny Depp in "Edward Scissorhands," Richard 
Gere in "Pretty Woman" and Patrick Swayze in "Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
In the television competition, Roseanne Barr, whose top-rated TV series 
"Roseanne" was ignored in the Emmys, was nominated for best actress in a 
musical or comedy series and her co-star John Goodman also received a nod. 
</P>
<P>
In network competition, NBC led with 22 nominations, ABC 19, CBS 14 and Fox 2.
