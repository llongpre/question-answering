   All five movies nominated as best picture of
1989 were films that Hollywood's heavy-hitters thought would be
financial flops. But their creators persisted and got the movies
made and Monday night one will walk off with the film industry's
top prize.

   The movies ``Born on the Fourth of July'' and
``Driving Miss Daisy,'' both shunned by the major Hollywood
studios, are the favorites to win Oscars when the film industry
honors its own Monday night.
   The 62nd Academy Awards extravaganza at the Los Angeles Music
Center will begin on ABC at 9 p.m. EST with Billy Crystal as master
of ceremonies. The show, hoping to improve on sagging TV ratings in
recent years, will feature satellite tie-ins from Moscow, Buenos
Aires, Argentina, London, Sydney, Australia, and Tokyo.
   The contenders for acting prize include 80-year-old Jessica
Tandy and Marlon Brando, 65, who both achieved fame 40 years ago
when they co-starred on Broadway in ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
   Miss Tandy, the cranky dowager of ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' is
deemed the favorite in a difficult-to-predict race for best
actress. Michelle Pfeiffer, the sexy singer of ``The Fabulous Baker
Boys,'' is also highly touted.
   Leading the race for best actor are Tom Cruise, the disabled
veteran of ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' and Daniel Day-Lewis,
the cerebral palsy victim of ``My Left Foot.''
   Brando was nominated for best supporting actor for his role as
the liberal South African lawyer in ``A Dry White Season.'' The
unpredictable Brando accepted his first Oscar for ``On the
Waterfront'' in 1954 but spurned his second for ``The Godfather''
in 1972.
   Among the stars who will present the awards are Warren Beatty,
Jessica Lange, Jack Lemmon (from Moscow), Jack Nicholson, Steve
Martin, Rachel Ward and Bryan Brown (from Sydney), and last year's
acting winners, Jodie Foster, Geena Davis and Kevin Kline.
   All five nominees for best picture of 1989 were movies that all
of the major Hollywood studios spurned as being too special to
attract a wide audience. For instance, ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   ``It was turned down by all the major companies,'' reports
Richard Zanuck, who produced the film with his wife, Lili. ``Then
we went to some of the minor players among the companies. No one
thought it was commercial. The consensus was that it would be a
nice movie with good reviews, but it couldn't attract a wide
audience.
   ``They also felt that it needed a stronger cast. By that time we
had locked in Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman on a pay-or-play
basis (meaning they would have to be paid whether they appeared or
not). They wanted a younger actress, like Meryl Streep, Shirley
MacLaine or Jane Fonda, who could be aged. But for a character that
started the film in her 70s and ended in her 90s, that seemed
impractical.''
   The Zanucks solved the problem by trimming the budget from $12.5
million to $7.5 million and cutting 20 days from the schedule.
Everyone on the production worked for lower salaries, including
latecomer Dan Aykroyd, who took the Zanuck offer of $150,000 vs.
his usual salary of $1-million plus.
   Warner Bros. agreed to pay $5 million for the U.S. releasing
rights and a London company provided $2.5 million for foreign
rights.
   ``It took two years before I could find anybody to consider
`Dead Poets Society,''' says Tom Schulman, who wrote the original
screenplay. ``Every agent turned it down, every studio turned it
down.
   ``They said it was a nice screenplay, but no picture about a
prep school had been successful. Besides, there were no girls in
the story, and it dealt with poetry.''
   Schulman stuck to his story about an English teacher who
inspires his students to creative thinking with bursts of poetry.
He finally interested producer Steven Haft who took the project to
Disney's Touchstone Pictures, where the script had previously been
rejected.
   First, Dustin Hoffman was scheduled to direct and star. But he
dropped out for ``Rain Man.'' Then director Peter Weir
(``Witness'') came aboard, followed by Robin Williams, who added a
whole new dimension to the role of teacher John Keating. ``Dead
Poets Society'' ended up with a $94 million gross in the United
States and Canada.
   Director-writer Phil Alden Robinson devoted six years to
bringing ``Field of Dreams'' to the screen. He first read W.P.
Kinsella's baseball fantasy ``Shoeless Joe'' in 1982 and tried to
interest the studios.
   ``I was turned down at every studio,'' remarks Robinson. ``I was
told, `We can see what you like in the novel, but it won't make a
movie.'''
   Finally, in 1985 Robinson found a taker. Lawrence Gordon, then
head of production at 20th Century Fox. The script was developed at
Fox, but then Gordon left for independent producing and ``Field of
Dreams'' went into ``turnaround,'' meaning it could be peddled to
other studios. Gordon and his producer-brother, Charles, took it to
Tom Pollock at Universal, who said yes even before a star had been
signed.
   ``Kevin Costner was not even on our list of possibilities
because he had just finished another baseball movie, `Bull Durham,'
'' Robinson recalls. But Costner learned about the script and
accepted immediately after reading it. The ``Field of Dreams''
domestic take _ $63 million.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' holds the record among this
year's best-picture nominees for length of time in reaching the
screen.
   Oliver Stone and Ron Kovic wrote the script, based on Kovic's
Vietnam experiences, in 1977-78. In 1979, Stone was on the brink of
directing the film with Al Pacino as star.
   ``But the money was not there; it wasn't considered
commercial,'' says Stone, who spent 10 years finding backers for
his ``Platoon'' (best picture, 1986). ``Ten years later, Tom Cruise
took an interest in it, `Platoon' was a success and Universal
Pictures, which had originally killed the picture, came back and
financed it.''
   Producer Noel Pearson didn't even canvass the major studios for
backing of ``My Left Foot,'' realizing a film about a cerebral
palsy victim would attract a chilly reaction. Production began in
Dublin, Ireland, with no assurance of financing, using his own
money, plus donations from a friend and Irish television. Slowly he
accumulated enough for the budget _ ``under $3 million.''
   The same pattern of rejection of Academy Award nominees by the
big studios has occurred increasingly in recent years. Why?
   ``I think it's the cost factor,'' theorizes Richard Zanuck.
``Even with smaller pictures, the cost of advertising and prints
can amount to a major investment. The studios naturally avoid
projects that they consider `dangerous' or not in the mainstream.
   ``But `Driving Miss Daisy' and the other nominees have proven
that audiences are hungry for material that is not devoted to
rapes, car crashes, murder and blood.''
