<LEADPARA>  LIKE a fickle tango dancer who can't decide on a refined partner or a
down-and-dirty one, Oscar has again divided its affections almost equally
between prestigious art films andgaudy crowd-pleasers.;    All you need do is
peruse this years' best picture candidates, announced Wednesday morning, and
you'll be reminded of Oscar's schizoid profile. Here, competing in the same
category, are Martin Scorsese's dark and anarchic "GoodFellas," Francis
Coppola's moody and operatic "The Godfather III," Kevin Costner's sweeping
"Dances with Wolves," Penny Marshall's clinically precise "Awakenings" and
Jerry Zucker's shamelessly manipulative "Ghost."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Did someone say "Ghost"? Yes, you heard correctly. In what has to be seen
as the dopiest move since "Airport" and "Love Story" were placed among the
1970 best-picture picks, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences members
have fallen for a schmaltzy box-office giant that's hopelessly outclassed by
its competitors.;    But then, the Coppola and Scorsese entries also have
their work cut out for them. Even the most out-of-touch academy member must
concede that "The Godfather III" pales beside its predecessors, which were
voted best picture in their respective years. "GoodFellas" is just too bleakly
funny for the generally older and humorless academy.;    As for "Awakenings,"
it follows in a long string of Oscar favorites about handicapped heroes,
ranging from "Charly" to "My Left Foot." Penny Marshall, however, was snubbed
in the director's category. Never a good sign.;    Of the best-picture
nominees, only Costner's epic-length "Dances" feels completely at home in the
category. The western with a social conscience follows in the hoof-prints of
such previously nominated horse operas as "How the West Was Won," "Friendly
Persuasion" and "High Noon." It has everything Oscar adores -- action, scope,
craftsmanship, star appeal and an abiding respect for what's left of the
frontier. Unless director-star Costner insults Mother Teresa in public prior
to the March 25 awards show, this Civil War-era drama would seem to have a
lock on the best-picture trophy.;    This said, we're still wondering how
Costner clinched a nomination for best actor, knocking out such highly touted
possibles as Robin Williams ("Awakenings") and Nick Nolte ("Q &amp; A"). In its
rush to reward Costner's perseverance (he turned down many lucrative offers to
devote 18 months to his revisionist look at the taming of the West), Oscar
has, in typical fashion, overdone it.;    The sight of Costner's name beside
the more seasoned nominees -- Gerard Depardieu ("Cyrano de Bergerac"), Robert
De Niro ("Awakenings"), Richard Harris ("The Field") and Jeremy Irons
("Reversal of Fortune") -- can't help but elicit a chuckle and a shake of the
head. Costner's performance is too off-hand and naturalistic. Oscar likes to
see its favorites sweat, which is why Paul Newman's uptight Mr. Bridge (in
"Mr. and Mrs. Bridge") wasn't nominated, and Depardieu has a good chance of
being the first actor in a foreign-language film to bring home the brass.
(Sophia Loren is the only actress to win in a subtitled nominee, 1961's "Two
Women" from Italy.);    The hulking Depardieu's only competition could be
Harris, who has bounded back from alcoholism and playing Bo Derek's father in
"Tarzan, The Ape Man" to score a nomination with "The Field," an adaptation of
an Irish play about a disputed bit of pasture. Oscar is a sap for
against-all-odds comebacks. So Harris could very much be in the running.;   
This year's best-actress field is an even better reflection of Oscar's
populist bent. For a change, all the nominees are Americans appearing in
either comedies or thrillers. The stars of last year's respectable dramas --
Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Russia House," Jessica Lange in "Men Don't Leave"
and, most notably, Glenn Close in "Reversal of Fortune" -- were overlooked in
favor of breezier turns by Julia Roberts ("Pretty Woman"), Anjelica Huston
("The Grifters") and Meryl Streep (in the anything-but-edgy "Postcards From
the Edge"). Kathy Bates, who won a Golden Globe for her captor-tormentor in
"Misery," is also among the nominees. Unfortunately, women-as-psychos often go
home empty-handed, as Bette Davis (up for "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?")
and Close ("Fatal Attraction") learned when they played flamboyant nut-cases.;
   But again, this could change, especially since Bates' toughest competitors
-- Joanne Woodward in "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge" and Anjelica Huston in "The
Grifters" -- are previous winners.;    Moving on to the supporting actor
category we find the brash young Andy Garcia (here nominated for "Godfather
III") locked in competition with the gently nurturing Bruce Davison (of
"Longtime Companion"), the rabid Joe Pesci ("GoodFellas") up against the
sublime Graham Greene ("Dances with Wolves"). It's Al Pacino, however, who
will really confound odds-makers. He was overlooked for his spiritually
exhausted Mafia don in "Godfather III" and acknowledged for a mobster
caricature, the hunchbacked Big Boy Caprice of "Dick Tracy." In other words,
he managed to play King Lear and the Fool in the same year.;    What can we
infer from all this? First, that the academy doesn't take Coppola's final
panel in the Corleone triptych as seriously as its seven nominations would
indicate; and second, although "Dick Tracy" didn't make the best-picture
category, the Warren Beatty comic-strip is more highly regarded by the
industry than was first reported.;    There's more schizophrenia in the
supporting-actress field. The anxious-to-please Whoopi Goldberg ("Ghost") is
in competition with the seriously demented Diane Ladd (in David Lynch's
otherwise overlooked "Wild at Heart"). Annette Bening's coquettish confidence
woman (in "The Grifters") locks horns with Mary McDonnell's white woman
adopted by the Sioux ("Dances with Wolves") and Lorraine Bracco's reluctant
Mafia wife ("GoodFellas").;    This year's directors' race is at once an
opportunity for the Academy to get serious and to strut its outrageous sexism.
At first glance, it would appear a respectable enough lineup -- Costner,
Coppola, Scorsese, Stephen Frears ("The Grifters") and Barbet Schroeder
("Reversal of Fortune"). All are formidable talents. All have enviable track
records, especially Scorsese, who has been nominated in this category twice
before and has guided a number of Oscar-winning performances (Ellen Burstyn in
"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore," De Niro in "Raging Bull," Newman in "The
Color of Money").;    But then your eyes dart back to the best-picture list,
and you quip that the much-admired "Awakenings" must have directed itself.
Either that, or director Marshall's name was accidentally dropped from the
ballot. Whatever the explanation, Marshall didn't make the all-male cut.;   
It used to be that this didn't augur well for a best-picture candidate. No
film wins that isn't also nominated in the director category, the reasoning
went. Then along came "Driving Miss Daisy." It failed to garner a nomination
for director Bruce Beresford, but still went on to score in the best actress,
adapted screenplay and picture categories.;    Usually, we chalk up such
oversights to academy myopia. This year, however, something else may be at
play. The academy's membership (4,800-plus) is overwhelmingly male, and, to
date, Lina Wertmuller remains the only woman nominated as best director
(unsuccessfully in 1976, for "Seven Beauties").;    Does this mean we can
expect the kind of backlash that greeted Spike Lee's snubbing for "Do the
Right Thing"? Could be. Since the beginning of these things, someone or some
group has yelled "Foul!" It's a healthy sign we're not falling for Oscar's
often inexcusable lack of taste. This year's debate, if there is one, will be
led by the Glenn Close Fan Club and women's groups not swayed by Oscar's
preference for what were once called women's pictures.;     BEST PICTURE;
