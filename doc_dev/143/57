   Jennifer Weir has her wedding ring back
_ three months after it vanished down a toilet.
   Weir, 25, called the Union Sanitary District after she lost the
diamond ring during the Easter holiday and a crew came out and
probed the sewer.
   ``It wasn't in any of the stuff that came out,'' Weir said.
   Crew chief Manuel Terra told her it might take a few months for
the ring to be washed from the house plumbing into the 8-inch line
in the street.
   On Wednesday, three months later, she called Terra, who came out
again.
   The crew sent a water-powered cleaning ball through the line from
one manhole to the next.
   ``I was losing hope,'' Weir said.
   All of a sudden, Weir said, ``the guy in the manhole was yelling
`You struck gold!'''
   ``It was just luck,'' said Terra.
