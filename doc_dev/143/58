   Jim Backus, the muttering voice of the
nearsighted cartoon character ``Mr. Magoo'' and the self-indulgent
millionaire of ``Gilligan's Island,'' died Monday of pneumonia. He
was 76.
   The character actor, who played the fabulously wealthy Thurston
Howell III on television's ``Gilligan's Island'' and was featured in
dozens of movies, had suffered from Parkinson's disease for many
years.
   He had been treated for double pneumonia for more than two weeks
at Saint John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica and died
there Monday at 8:45 a.m., said hospital spokeswoman Paulette Weir.
   ``I'm a working man's hypochondriac,'' Backus said in an
interview five years ago. ``I used to do benefits and I'd come home
with whatever symptoms went with the disease I was benefiting.
   ``When they told me I had Parkinson's, I read a magazine article
on it, and overnight I had every symptom known to man. I became an
authority on it.''
   Backus' throaty baritone was known to millions as that of the
bumbling, myopic Mr. Quincy Magoo on the ``Famous Adventures of Mr.
Magoo.'' On the animated series, Magoo played various historical
figures, including Long John Silver, Friar Tuck, William Tell and
Rip Van Winkle.
   He subsequently was introduced to generations of television fans
on ``Gilligan's Island,'' the improbable comedy about a ragtag group
of people shipwrecked on an island with nothing to do but dream up
ridiculous rescue schemes.
   On the series, still popular in syndication, Backus' character
was adapted from his Hubert Updyke, the world's richest man on the
Alan Young radio show of the 1940s. Bob Denver, as Gilligan, and
Alan Hale Jr., as the skipper, joined Backus in the cast of
``Gilligan's Island,'' broadcast by CBS from 1964 to 1967.
   ``I love him,'' Tina Louise, who played the sexy movie star
Ginger Grant on the series, said Monday. ``I was so saddened to lose
him, except I don't feel I've lost him because he's always in my
heart.''
   Miss Louise recalled that at the 70th birthday party for
``Gilligan's Island'' creator-producer Sherwood Schwartz two years
ago, Backus was so ill he had to be carried up the steps.
   ``I asked him to dance and he bet me a million dollars he
wouldn't be able to dance, but he did,'' she said.
   ``He was a unique talent,'' said Schwartz. He said he created the
Thurston Howell character with Backus in mind ``because I don't know
anybody else who could play that character the way Jim did.''
   Backus also played Judge Bradley Stevens on ``I Married Joan,''
an early television situation comedy that ran from 1952 to 1955. He
was seen on ``Playhouse 90'' and ``Studio One'' and made many guest
appearances on television variety and panel shows.
   He was host in 1962 of CBS' ``Talent Scouts,'' which introduced
George Carlin, Charles Nelson Reilly and Louise Lasser to television
audiences.
   A native of Cleveland, Ohio, James Gilmore Backus studied at the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1933. His acting
career began in stock theater and vaudeville, and he went on to
become a radio announcer in Cleveland, Detroit and New York.
   He appeared on Broadway in ``Paint Your Wagon'' and ``Too Many
Heroes.''
   His motion-picture debut came in 1949 with ``Easy Living,''
starring Victor Mature and Lucille Ball. His movie roles included
James Dean's father in the 1955 classic ``Rebel Without a Cause.''
   Other Backus credits included ``Deadline, U.S.A.,'' ``Half
Angel,'' ``Pat and Mike,'' ``His Kind of Woman,'' ``Bright
Victory,'' ``Above and Beyond,'' ``Androcles and the Lion,'' ``Man
of a Thousand Faces,'' ``Hurry Sundown,'' ``The Wonderful World of
the Brothers Grimm,'' ``It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,'' ``Hello Down
There,'' ``Myra Breckinridge,'' ``Crazy Mama,'' ``Pete's Dragon''
and ``Good Guys Wear Black.''
   Backus was one of the best golfers in the entertainment industry,
and he even made the cut once in the Bing Crosby Pro-Am, playing in
the final round with Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player.
   Backus and Henriette, his wife of many years, produced two humor
books based on his illness, ``Backus Strikes Back'' and ``Forgive Us
Our Digressions.'' He also wrote the books ``Rocks on the Roof'' and
``What Are You Doing After the Orgy?''
   He composed the records ``Delicious'' and ``Cave Man.''
   Backus is survived by his wife. The couple were childless.
   Weir said a memorial service would be announced at a later date.
Funeral arrangements were pending.
