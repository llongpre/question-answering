<LEADPARA>  THE best British comedies always seem to have a vinegary aftertaste, and "The
Object of Beauty" (opening today) is no exception.;    Co-starring John
Malkovich and Andie MacDowell as a couple of ne'er-do-well Americans down on
their luck in London, "Object" takes a decidedly cynical look at love and
greed, and how one can feed upon and then replace the other.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When things are at their worst and it appears our scrappy-but-well-matched
lovers are about to be bounced from their four-star hotel, Tina (MacDowell)
wonders what, after two years together, they have in common. "Would you call
it greed?" she asks.;    "Would I call what greed?" the seriously overextended
Jake (Malkovich) says.;    "What's in common between us.";    "No -- I'd call
it fear.";    And that, in a nutshell, is what "Object" is all about: the
private traps we lay for one another out of fear of being exposed as emotional
frauds. Jake and Tina con and bluff their way between meals, but their game
isn't what you would call sophisticated. Indeed, they come off as couple of
nervy children on holiday.;    Moore or less;    That they always seem more
misguided than obnoxious says a lot about the stars' likability, and
director-writer Michael Lindsay-Hogg refusal to take the easy, Yank-bashing
route.;    "Object" says loads about Ugly Americans abroad, but indirectly.
There's not a cheap shot in the entire fusillade. Noel Coward would have
rejoiced at this comedy.;    The object of the title is a miniature bronze
statue by Henry Moore. It's not very pretty, but it is worth $30,000 -- or
roughly the amount it will take Tina and Jake to get out of hock.
Unfortunately, Tina refuses to part with the piece. It was given to her by her
estranged hubby and has a certain, ah, sentimental value.;    Then how about
pretending the statue has been stolen and collecting the insurance money? A
decent enough scheme, but one that's never implemented because the Moore is
filched by a third party.;    Tina and Jake, of course, suspect one another.
The friendly insurance adjuster and the hotel management suspect the loud and
loutish Americans.;    "Object" is too wry and, in spots, outright malicious
to appeal to the average filmgoer. It is, however, of a work of considerable
humor and beauty, thanks in large measure to David Watkin's stunning
cinematography and a first-rate supporting cast.;    Joss Ackland, usually
found playing villains, is perfect as the hotel manager who dreams of retiring
with an unblemished record. Lolita Davidovich of "Blaze" appears as the
couple's sounding board; Bill Paterson and Peter Riegert, co-stars in "Local
Hero," play the hotel's easily intimidated snoop and Tina's spiteful husband,
respectively.;    Rudi Davies, last seen here in "The Lonely Passion of Judith
Hearne," is poignant and captivating as the deaf-mute hotel maid who also
figures in the theft and allows Lindsay-Hogg entry to a harsher working-class
milieu.;    A rakish roue;    But it's Malkovich and MacDowell who make this
so much fun. Malkovich has cornered the market on stylish cads after
"Dangerous Liaisons" and "The Sheltering Sky." There's no one around who can
glory as fully in his own decadence. MacDowell, of "Green Card," continues to
charm with her homespun ways and classic beauty. Arm-in-arm, they bounce from
antagonism to exasperation to mutual respect.;    "The Object of Beauty" is
that rare find -- a serious comedy that's as artful as it is romantic.; The
Object of Beauty; (star)(star)(star); Rated: R (for profanity, slight nudity);
