<LEADPARA>  Director Peter Weir is known for giving credit to crew members and actors for
their contributions to his films. But he's bemused by the attention he gets
for just being sensible.;    "I don't know why everybody makes such a big deal
out of my generosity," the Australian director told reporters in L.A. "If
you're the conductor of the orchestra and somebody can twiddle the flute
better than you, you pay them.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "It doesn't bother me who gets the credit as long as it helps the finished
movie.";    In "Dead Poet's Society," a hit for Weir, he used a few lines of
poetry written on the spot by Robin Williams for a crucial scene.;    On
Weir's newest film, "Green Card," starring Gerard Depardieu and Andie
MacDowell, assistant cameraman Eric Swanek came up with the idea of shooting
through a door's peephole to show one character's distorted view of another.; 
  The director said he also relied heavily on the French film star Depardieu
to flesh out his character, a French national who needs a green card to remain
in the United States.;    "We sat down and he told me actual stories of his
life, as well as hypothesizing on what might have been if he hadn't gone into
acting."  </TEXT>
