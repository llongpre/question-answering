Jennifer Weir has her wedding ring back -- three months after it vanished down 
a toilet at her home in Union City. Weir, 25, called the Union Sanitary 
District after she lost the diamond ring during the Easter holiday and a crew 
came out and probed the sewer line. "It wasn't in any of the stuff that came 
out," Weir said. Crew chief Manuel Terra told her it might take a few months 
for the ring to be washed from the house plumbing into the 8-inch line in the 
street. Earlier this week, she called Terra, who came out again. The crew sent 
a water-powered cleaning ball through the line from one manhole to the next. "I 
was losing hope," Weir said. All of a sudden, Weir said, "the guy in the 
manhole was yelling, 'You struck gold!"' "It was just luck," Terra said.
