Vocem is a keen music-theatre ensemble, much concerned with electronics,
educational work and 'community' projects. On Saturday they appeared on the
South Bank with electronics for Vic Hoyland's new In Pursuit of a Dream, and
with the Endymion Ensemble and a few props for Judith Weir's version of
Scipio's Dream - billed as a little known 'opera' by 'the 14-year-old
Mozart'. In fact Il sogno di Scipione was a 'serenata drammatica'
commissioned for the inauguration of the new Archbishop of Salzburg in 1772,
when Mozart was already 16, but never mind; it made an engaging start for
the evening.
It would have made a still better ending, as originally announced, for it is
half the length of the Hoyland piece and palpably richer in music. He and
his bright cast proved that this pretty jeu d'esprit can work with no visual
tricks more modern than a dance hall mirror-ball.
Miss Weir's alterations to Scipione are limited and precise. The original
scenario was the lofty sort of 'morality' that was standard for celebrating
accessions to high places, royal or ecclesiastical: noble Scipio is divinely
wooed both by Fortuna and by Constanza, and with guidance from a noble
ancestor chooses the right one (the latter, of course). In Weir's wry, pawky
English text he becomes an impressionable City chap of the 1990s, but
mutatis mutandis the dream-vision remains the same. The Weir orchestra is
updated to match, not only by electric guitar and keyboards to back her
string trio and four winds, but with a huge, dominating part for
mock-celestial harp.
In that role Hugh Webb was indomitable - it must be more taxing than
Mozart's own Concerto for harp and flute - and his sure-fingered rhythm
invaluable. Gwion Thomas sang 'Mr Scipio' in ringing style, and with cool
comic flair: he is a performer of noteworthy potential. The pleading soprano
goddesses were Frances Lynch and Josephine McNally, both of them alert and
characterful, and Andrew Gallacher's bass 'Grandfather' wielded more
gravitas than his casual pitch really earned.
He was more exactly sonorous as Oberon in Hoyland's piece, which is a
thin-blooded extract from A Midsummer Night's Dream (no Athenian court, no
mechanicals) with cosy intermittent warbling by the surviving characters.
Even if the music hadn't expressly cited 'I know a bank . . .' from
Britten's Dream, it would recall Britten's sound-world for most
music-lovers: white-note harmony with a few modal twists, soft whole-tone
clashes between voices.
Unlike Britten, Hoyland offers little more than that - and his score is
further diluted by long spoken stretches: half unintelligible if you don't
know the play well, irritatingly truncated and denuded of context if you do.
Besides most of the singers already mentioned, Philip Creasy, Phillip
Casperd and Teresa Shaw sang and declaimed to excellent purpose. The net
effect of In Pursuit of a Dream was nonetheless dramatically slim, and
musically too bland and inoffensive to stamp a character of its own upon the
shrunken Shakespeare text.
