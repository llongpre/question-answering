<LEADPARA>  Proving again there's no substitute for pluck and commitment, Kevin Costner's
"Dances with Wolves," a paeon to the vanishing West and vanquished Indian, has
bested the glossy competition to earn 12 Oscar nominations, including one for
best picture, it was announced today in Beverly Hills by the Academy of Motion
Picture Arts and Sciences.;    Costner also received nominations in the
director and best-actor categories. He's in good company. Only Orson Welles in
"Citizen Kane," Laurence Olivier in "Hamlet" and Warren Beatty in "Reds"
managed the same triple play with nominations for best film, director and
actor. Beatty's "Reds" also received 12 nominations in 1981.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     What is the competition in the best-picture category? Two noisy gangster
sagas and a couple of feel-good weepies. Nominated for best picture are
"GoodFellas," "Awakenings," "The Godfather Part III," and -- the morning's
biggest surprise -- the fluffy but high-grossing "Ghost," which co-starred
Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore.;    The other pictures to garner multiple
nominations are "Dick Tracy" and "The Godfather Part III" with seven apiece,
"GoodFellas" with six, "Cyrano de Bergerac" and "Ghost" with five each. "The
Grifters," a critics' favorite but thought to be a long shot, took home four
nominations, including those for best actress and supporting actress. Last
year's cash cow, a comedy called "Home Alone," has to console itself with two
nominations, for best score and song.;    Joining Costner in the best-actor
slot: Robert De Niro for "Awakenings", Gerard Depardieu in the subtitled
"Cyrano de Bergerac", Jeremy Irons for his role as Claus von Bulow in
"Reversal of Fortune" and -- in what must be seen as the year's big comeback
-- Richard Harris as the obsessed Irish farmer in "The Field.";    A
prostitute, a psycho and a peroxide blond are among the best-actress nominees.
Named in this category are: Julia Roberts for "Pretty Woman," Kathy Bates for
"Misery," Anjelica Huston for "The Grifters," Meryl Streep for "Postcards From
the Edge" and Joanne Woodward for "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge." Streep, Huston and
Woodward are previous winners.;    Three gangsters made the supporting-actor
cut. They were played by Andy Garcia in "The Godfather Part III," Al Pacino in
"Dick Tracy" and Joe Pesci in "GoodFellas." The category also includes Bruce
Davison for "Longtime Companion" and Graham Greene for "Dances with Wolves."; 
  There are two previous nominees but no previous winners among the
supporting-actress choices. Whoopi Goldberg surprised no one by being singled
out for her spirited spiritualist in "Ghost." Newcomer Annette Bening is
nominated for "The Grifters." Lorraine Bracco is competing with her
performance as a long-suffering Mafioso bride in "GoodFellas." Diane Ladd and
Mary McDonnell round out the category with nominations for "Wild at Heart" and
"Dances with Wolves," respectively.;    Costner, a first-time film maker, is
up against some formidable competition in the director category. Also
nominated are: Francis Ford Coppola for "The Godfather Part III," Martin
Scorsese for "GoodFellas," Stephen Frears for "The Grifters" and Barbet
Schroeder for "Reversal of Fortune." Only Coppola has won before, for the
first and second installments of the ongoing "Godfather" saga.;    Woody
Allen, a longtime Oscar favorite, is nominated for his original screenplay for
"Alice." He will compete at the March 25 Oscar ceremony with Barry Levinson
for "Avalon," Bruce Joel Ruben for "Ghost," Peter Weir for "Green Card" and
the little-known Whit Stillman, nominated for the art-house release
"Metropolitan." Andrew Bergman, author of "The Freshman," was thought to be a
front-runner in this category.;    Nominated for screenplay based on material
from another medium was Steven Zaillian for "Awakenings," Michael Blake for
"Dances with Wolves," Nicholas Pileggi and Scorsese for "GoodFellas," Donald
E. Westlake for "The Grifters," and Nicholas Kazan for "Reversal of Fortune.; 
  After this morning's announcement of nominees, veteran Oscar-watchers were
left to sort out the many surprises and oversights. Why were the highly
regarded "Hamlet" and Glenn Close shafted? "Hamlet" received only two minor
nods, in the art direction and costume categories; Close, whose work in
"Hamlet" and "Reversal of Fortune," looked to be shoo-ins for supporting
nominations, was overlooked completely.;    And why the inclusion of the
popular but inconsequential "Ghost" in this best picture category? Did the
Academy suffer a momentary blackout and forget about such highly regarded 1990
releases as "Q&amp;A," "The Russia House," "Vincent &amp; Theo" and "Mermaids"? Each
was ignored. Zero nominations.;    Also, why wasn't Pacino nominated as best
actor for his bravura work in "Godfather III"? Instead, he was remembered for
his hunchbacked gangster caricature in "Dick Tracy," which fared better
overall than many predicted.;    As usual, the directors' slate will bring the
lion's share of controversy. Though her film, "Awakenings," is part of the
best-picture field, Penny Marshall herself was not nominated as director.
Besides being inconsistent, Oscar could be in for charges of sexism. In its
63-year history, the Academy has nominated one woman in this category --
Italy's Lina Wertmuller for "Seven Beauties" (1976). She didn't win.;    Of
the foreign-language nominees, only two have to date gone into wide release --
Germany's "The Nasty Girl" and France's "Cyrano de Bergerac." The field also
includes Switzerland's "Journey of Hope," Italy's "Open Doors," and China's
"Ju Dou.";    Mark Kitchell's Bay Area-produced "Berkeley in the Sixties" will
compete in the best documentary field.  </TEXT>
