   HealthVest said its board removed David L. Whelan as chairman and Elliott H. Weir Jr. as president of this real estate investment trust. 

   The trust said that the men will remain trustees. 
Stephen R. Jepson, one of three independent trustees, said the board removed Messrs. 
Whelan and Weir because of their previous positions with Healthcare International Inc., a troubled operator of health-care concerns that missed a $4 million lease payment to HealthVest due in early August. 

   Mr. Whelan resigned as president and Mr. Weir resigned as executive vice president of Healthcare International in late July, after Healthcare International said that it would report a fourth-quarter loss and that it was facing cash-flow problems. 
Messrs. 
Whelan and Weir couldn't be reached for comment. 

   HealthVest was begun with four properties leased to Healthcare International properties. 
It now owns more than two dozen health-care related properties leased by Healthcare International and others, but Healthcare International still is HealthVest's largest tenant. 

   HealthVest said it hired Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. as its financial adviser to evaluate the current status of Healthcare International.
