<LEADPARA>  Los Gatos officials and the developer of one of the town's few remaining
parcels of large, flat open space struck a compromise of sorts last week on
developing a subdivision on a picturesque 18-acre property off Kennedy Road.; 
  With numerous neighbors voicing opposition to the developer's plans to carve
out one-acre lots and with his proposal to develop the land in phases, the
town council came up with something each side could live with.  </LEADPARA>

<MEMO>  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 5/1/91, pg. 2);  Because of a Los Gatos
resident's statement at a town council hearing, an article in the April 24
Extra incorrectly said the tenant of the lone home on 18 acres proposed for
development off Kennedy Road has been the source of a number of police
problems. Police said there have been no problems there in recent years.  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     For the neighbors, it was the stipulation that developer Robert Weir design
the entire 18 acres now, not in phases, as he wanted to do. For Weir, it was
giving support to his desire to develop homes on lots of at least one acre
each.;    But Weir's architect, John Lien, who presented the project to the
council, said he felt that support was tenuous because it was given in the
form of consensus agreement and was not a formal approval.;    "We're
disappointed it was not an actual motion for the (one-acre lot) zoning because
there's no real guarantee," Lien said after the meeting. "It's a lot more
risky doing it this way.";    Lien said Weir also was disappointed with having
to produce a plan for the entire parcel now. He said Weir wanted to avoid
having to seek financing for land, water and road engineering studies and the
installation of roads and utilities for the entire parcel. He proposed
developing only three homes on one portion of the site now and developing the
rest later.;    Without the formal approval for one-acre lot sites, Lien said
he could spend time designing a subdivision using that zoning standard and the
council could still turn it down. Under the one-acre zoning, Weir could
probably build 15 homes on the 18-acre site, which Los Gatos Creek runs
through.;    Residents of Teresita Court, Forrester Road and Longmeadow Drive,
which surround Weir's land, told the council they favored lots of 2.5 acres.
Under that zoning, Weir could probably build seven homes.;    Weir is not a
developer by profession but a tax attorney from Los Altos. He has owned the
Kennedy Road parcel since 1964. He made one attempt to build a lavish home for
himself in the late 1960s but apparently had been rebuffed by the town because
of neighbors' opposition.;    Residents said they wanted fewer homes because
it would mean less traffic up Kennedy Road, a main artery into the hills, and
they emphasized concern over keeping the woodsy area as natural as possible
and as safe for the joggers, bicyclists and dog walkers that use two-lane
Kennedy every day.;    The residents also emphasized the importance of Weir
designing and obtaining approval of the entire 18 acres now.;    "In two years
some of you won't be on the council and all we'll have is our memories and
notes from these meetings, and that won't be enough for another council
looking at this," Teresita resident Tom Liolios told the packed chambers.
"We'd rather it be developed now when everyone is willing to meet and resolve
this thing.";    Liolios said residents would like to have some control over
what they fear might be "monster homes" built on the land, similar to the two-
and three-story mansions in the adjacent Kennedy Estates development on
Forrester Road.;    Lien said Weir's project is far from the stage of home
design, but he speculated that the homes would be in the range of 3,700 to
4,400 square feet.;    Among the dozen or so residents opposed to the smaller
lot size, several spoke in favor of Weir's one-acre lot plan, saying smaller
lots would produce smaller homes, not the rambling estates that dot some of
the town's ridges.;    "With 2.5-acre zoning, I feel we will be creating a
field of mansions, and as lovely as that is to show off to people who come to
visit, I don't feel it would fit in with the rural nature of the
neighborhood," said Phyllis Webber of Kennedy Road.;    Another neighbor said
he welcomed development of the parcel because one tenant living in the
property's only structure -- a rundown home -- has been the source of a number
of police problems.;    Weir's project has been the subject of countless
neighborhood meetings with Lien and Weir and among town planning officials and
the two men.;    And Lien said he's up for more. The architect said he won't
design anything more until he meets again with neighbors and they come to a
decision on how many homes should be built on the land. He said he could have
new drawings ready in six weeks.  </TEXT>
