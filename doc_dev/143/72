FT  10 AUG 93 / Arts: Weir and Saxton - New music at the Proms

Judith Weir is unquestionably one of the most individual voices in British
music today, composer of two widely acclaimed operas (the first, A Night at
the Chinese Opera, almost a paradigm of what opera in the late 20th century
can be), and an array of sharply focused, always fresh and original concert
works. Yet her output so far contains relatively little orchestral music -
only the chamber-sized Isti Mirant Stella (1981) has real substance and
engagement.
In Thursday's Prom Martyn Brabbins conducted the BBC Scottish Symphony
Orchestra in the London premiere of Weir's Music, Untangled from 1991. It
was part of a curiously assorted programme that began with the Pas de Six
from Britten's Prince of the Pagodas and Dvorak's Cello Concerto (Sophie
Rolland the less than assertive soloist) and ended with Prokofiev's Seventh
Symphony. Weir takes a Scottish folk melody and projects it through a series
of transformations which are always oblique and teasing. The whole bustling
process only lasts about eight minutes, though this, evidently, was a new
enlarged version, and the music brings echoes of Janacek (in the jump-cut
transitions) and Tippett (of Midsummer Marriage and Sellinger's Round mode).
As so often with Weir the music itself exudes no positive personality. The
charm, skill and distinction in her work stems much more from the artful
arrangements of the musical objects than from the flavour of the invention;
the constantly diverting contexts, the unexpected continuities make up the
expressive palette. Her method is at its most captivating in a theatrical
context - hence the success of the operas and the tours de force of pieces
like King Harald's Saga, where narrative conceits can be mixed in; it is
much harder to bring off in the more or less abstract world of an orchestral
piece. Music, Untangled is an effective concert filler, but Weir's eventual
breakthrough as an orchestral composer will require a much broader, more
ambitious canvas.
*****
Robert Saxton's strongly imagined, coherent and continuously vivid Viola
Concerto came to the Proms the following evening - this was the work's first
London performance, seven years after its 1986 Cheltenham premiere. A 'face
in the crowd' image is the nub of its argument: Saxton constantly places the
viola, which he describes as 'the most human instruments', at odds with a
small orchestra expertly used to convey menace - hard-edged, coolly bated,
or darkly immanent as may be, but always sharply contrasted in tone with the
eloquently 'human' utterances of the soloist.
Though Saxton does not specify the point, one might go further and divine in
the work's alienated drum-patterings, chilling piano arabesques and
occasional harshly squealing high clarinets an 'urban' subtext. The
influence of Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin, that most extreme of 20th-century
musical cityscapes, is everywhere: the dramatic contrasts of mood afford the
music a graphic quality of which Bartok would not have been at all ashamed.
He might also admired the formal orderliness of Saxton's four (linked)
movements, in which the traditional demands of concerto form and a
thoroughly modern sense of timbre and texture are smoothly reconciled.
In a way, there is something even a bit 'pat' about the composer's smoothing
over of joins, sanding away of all rough edges - Saxton's later orchestral
works are bolder, freer with form. But the concerto is so assured, so
gripping for the listener, and plainly so rewarding for a violist of Paul
Silverthorne's calibre to play (he was the work's inspirer and first
soloist), that this hardly counts as serious criticism. No less plainly, the
City of London Sinfonia under Richard Hickox were roused by it - as they had
been, earlier in the concert, by Nicholas Daniel's gloriously witty, urbane,
technically breathtaking account of the Strauss Oboe Concerto, but as they
had not been by Rossini (Turk in Italy Overture, leaden) or Wolf (Italian
Serenade, stodgy).
