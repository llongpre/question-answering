FT  24 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Weir at Pounds 38m after exceptional -
Redundancy costs halt 10-year run of increasing profits

An unbroken 10-year run of rising pre-tax profits came to an end last year
at Weir Group, but the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering products company
is still lifting its dividend by 10 per cent from 5.9p to 6.5p.
On turnover up from Pounds 425m to Pounds 449m Weir announced pre-tax
profits for the year to December 31 down from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 37.5m.
The latest figures reflect a Pounds 2.4m exceptional item for redundancy
costs and a fall in interest and other income from Pounds 4.1m to Pounds
2.55m.
Earnings per share slipped from 17.7p to 17.3p, a little better than
expected and partly because of the benefit of US tax rule changes. The final
dividend is raised from 4.15p to 4.575p.
Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive, said he was 'a wee bit disappointed' by the
level of profit last year, but the company had managed a creditable
performance in continuing difficult trading conditions.
He pointed, in particular, to intense pricing competition in large projects
from state-owned Italian companies and Japanese competitors. Weir lost out
on a big Abu Dhabi project when an Italian competitor dropped its price by
30 per cent to 'create employment in Italy,' said Mr Garrick.
Excluding the exceptional item, Weir's profit margin slipped from 9.2 to 8.9
per cent, with a rise from 7.7 to 8.6 per cent in engineering services
offset by a decline from 7.5 to 7.1 per cent in the much larger engineering
products business.
New orders rose strongly, from Pounds 373m to Pounds 470m, helped by an
Pounds 80m Qatar desalination plant order in December. Orders from the
Indo-Pacific region nearly trebled to about Pounds 60m, and accounted for
13.5 per cent (6 per cent) of the total.
The UK share of orders, in contrast, fell from 45.4 to 34.8 per cent mainly
because of a dearth of business in the water industry.
On the outlook for this year, Viscount Weir, the chairman, said there was
'no reason why we should not continue to give a good account of ourselves,
and again produce satisfactory results.'
Mr Garrick said Weir was continuing to look for acquisitions following last
year's Pounds 16m purchase of most of Darchem, which makes insulation
systems and fabricated components.
COMMENT
It had to happen sometime, but the drop in profits should merely interrupt
the trend line rather than imply that Weir has gone ex-growth. No further
exceptional items are expected this year, and if the company found no
overall, strong and consistent revival in the market for capital goods last
year, business did pick up in the second half and so far this year. Margins
have slipped, but the company's competitive position remains strong,
especially against European rivals. The strong showing in the Pacific Rim is
encouraging and sustainable, and Weir's refusal to make continental European
acquisitions just for the sake of it now seems fortuitous - in the short
term at least, the US looks a better bet for takeovers. A modest rise in
pre-tax profits, to Pounds 42m-Pounds 43m this year, would put the company
on a prospective p/e of about 17.
