Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering group, is paying Dollars
210m (Pounds 136m) to acquire EnviroTech Pumpsystems, a leading US
manufacturer of specialist pumps.
The acquisition will be partly funded through a proposed one-for-four rights
issue of about 39.3m shares at 252p each to raise Pounds 96m after expenses.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Morgan Grenfell. The balance
of the purchase price will be in cash and the enlarged group will have
little or no gearing.
The group announced a 10.6 per cent increase in first-half pre-tax profits
yesterday to Pounds 18.5m (Pounds 16.8m) but admitted that orders in the
second quarter had fallen off from the strong first quarter. Weir Group
shares closed 2p higher at 304p.
EnviroTech, a pump manufacturing group headquartered in Salt Lake City,
Utah, is part of the Baker Hughes group.
In the year to September 30, EnviroTech reported pre-tax profits of Dollars
21.7m on sales of Dollars 220.5m with net assets of Dollars 98.3m.
Weir has been looking for an acquisition which would improve the
international balance of its pump business which had sales last year of
Pounds 180m.
Lord Weir, chairman, said the purchase would enable the group to expand into
a truly international business with a combined turnover of about Pounds
330m.
He added that it would offer the group an improved marketing and
manufacturing capability worldwide and give the group's pump operations
important critical mass.
The combined pump business will represent about 55 per cent of the enlarged
group's sales and will increase Weir's presence in the important North
American market and expand its operations in most other regions. Lord Weir
said the deal should enhance earnings in 1995.
The US group, which employs about 2,000 people, also has plants in
California and Missouri and operations in the UK, continental Europe, South
America, Africa, Australia and Canada.
Its main worldwide markets are the mining and mineral processing, chemicals
and refining, water and waste water, power and utilities and pulp and paper.
Last year the US gave rise to 44.2 per cent of its operating revenues,
Europe 25.9 per cent, Africa 14.3 per cent, South America 11.1 per cent and
Asia/Pacific 4.5 per cent.
