   Rock guitarist Carlos Santana has accused
the Miller Brewing Co. of mimicking without authorization his
rendition of ``Black Magic Woman'' in a TV commercial.
   The lawsuit filed Monday alleges Miller and its New York ad
agency, Backer Spielvogel Bates Inc., violated trademark law in the
commercial for Miller Lite Beer. Santana's lawyer, David Phillips,
said damages may surpass $1 million.
   The lawsuit claims the brewer knowingly used an ``imitation of
Santana's distinctive guitar playing.''
   Last year, singer Bette Midler was awarded $400,000 after suing
an advertising agency for using a soundalike in a 1986 car
commercial.
   Although Santana did not write ``Black Magic Woman,'' the
lawsuit said, the public considers it his ``theme song.'' Peter
Green of Fleetwood Mac wrote the 1970 hit.
   Miller spokesman Steve Forsythe said the brewer had no comment.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Andie MacDowell, the repressed young wife in
``sex, lies and videotape,'' flinches at the possibility of
becoming a superstar.
   ``I like doing normal things, like going to Disney World with my
family. And it would be terrible not to be able to because of
fame,'' MacDowell said in the November issue of Glamour magazine.
   MacDowell, who was a top model before landing her first role in
``Greystoke,'' lives in a Victorian house in upstate New York with
her husband, model Paul Qualley, son Justin, 4, and daughter
Rainey, 18 months.
   She said if she weren't an acress she would be ``a mother and a
gardener.''
   ``I've got a huge vegetable garden, everything from arugula to
broccoli, to corn to sunflowers,'' she said.
   She has two new movies coming out soon: ``The Object of
Beauty,'' with John Malkovich and ``Green Card'' with Gerard
Depardieu.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Fans snapped up tickets for Bruce
Springsteen's first formal concert in two years in just 45 minutes.
   About 4,500 tickets were sold for the Nov. 16 show, said
spokesman Brian Fenske of the 6,300-seat Shrine Auditorium. The
$100, $50 and $25 tickets went on sale Sunday.
   The remaining tickets went to the non-profit Christic Institute
and weren't for sale.
   The concert with Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne will raise
money for the institute, which is waging a lawsuit accusing the
United States of involvement in the drug trade.
   ``We are not surprised,'' said the Rev. William Davis, the
group's West Coast director. ``Bruce and the other artists are very
popular and it will give great visibility to the issues that are
involved.''
   Springsteen's last formal concert appearance was during the 1988
Amnesty International world tour.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Ed Begley Jr. says he's been into recycling
since 1970 and recently refused a ride in an NBC limousine during a
promotional tour for his new TV series, ``Parenthood.''
   Instead, Begley said in the November issue of Redbook, he rode
his bike from his San Fernando Valley home to the Century City
studio.
   ``It's late. But it's not too late,'' said the former ``St.
Elsewhere'' star, who is on the boards of seven environmental
organizations and recycles everything from newspapers to metal
products.
   ``People have to realize that they can turn this around quicker
than they think. How? By exercising their voting power and their
purchasing power.''
