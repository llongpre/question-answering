<TEXT>
Weir Group is buying Valflow Engineering, a Derbyshire-based manufacturer of
ball valves for the oil, gas and petrochemical industries, for an
undisclosed sum.
The deal is part of Weir's expansion into the oil and gas valve business.
Valflow will be run as a satellite division of the group's Hopkinsons valve
operation, and its management team will continue to run the business.
Valflow has annual sales of about Pounds 2m and was placed in receivership
in November after hitting problems on a contract with British Gas.
Weir bought the company from the receivers, KPMG Peat Marwick.
