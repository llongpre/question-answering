"Picnic at Hanging Rock" (1975), directed by Peter Weir. 115 minutes. Rated R. 
An early gem from the director of "Dead Poets Society" and "Witness," this one 
is set in 1900 Australia, where three girls and their teacher vanish while on a 
school outing.

A psychedelic-supernatural story supposedly based on an actual account.

"Miracle Mile" (1989), directed by Steve DeJarnatt. 87 minutes. Rated R. Among 
the best of the nuclear apocalyptic films, the mood of this one resembles that 
of the quirky "After Midnight." A man races against time after mistakenly 
receiving a message that missiles have been launched and World War III is an 
hour away. Intense, humorous and powerful.

 "The Haunting" (1963), directed by Robert Wise. 112 minutes. No rating. This 
ghost story will give you sweaty palms, high blood pressure, just about 
everything a scary movie should, without benefit of fake decapitations and 
gallons of fake blood -- just a plot, some chilling sound effects and superb 
black-and-white photography. Not to mention a cast headed by Julie Harris and 
Claire Bloom. ERIK HAMILTON
