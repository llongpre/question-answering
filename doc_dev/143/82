Gillian Weir opened the 55th annual Los Angeles Bach Festival at First 
Congregational Church on Friday evening with a well-chosen, superbly played 
survey of Bach's organ works.

The British organist made it sound almost easy. Her technique is so sovereign 
it does not call attention to itself, or to the complexity and rigor of the 
music. She keeps attention entirely on the musical product rather than the 
performance process, an impression her conservative registration of the large 
Schlicker instrument in the rear gallery increased. 
</P>
<P>
Major pillars of the repertory framed Weir's generous program: the Concerto in 
D minor, BWV 596, and the Prelude and Fugue in D, BWV 532, before intermission; 
the Fantasia and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542, and the Passacaglia in C minor, BWV 
582, afterwards. She took quick but entirely apt tempos, with only a flustered 
pedal passage at the end of the D-major Fugue to indicate the technical risk 
involved. Otherwise, all was clear and clean, from the densest counterpoint to 
the most dazzling figuration.

In between those big pieces came more intimate fare. The repressed, unbalanced 
registration beginning the Pastorale, BWV 590, was Weir's only sonic 
miscalculation, although she failed to make much of a case for the quirky, 
seldom-played and doubtfully attributed "Kleines harmonisches Labyrinth." The 
chorale prelude "Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland," BWV 659, the Trio Sonata in E 
minor, BWV 528, and the Fantasia in G, BWV 572, were all sharply characterized 
in sound and touch.

<P>
The large crowd rose almost as one at the end, a reception Weir acknowledged in 
a regal procession down the center aisle. JOHN HENKEN
