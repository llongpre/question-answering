FT  09 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Weir's selective strategy pays off -
Tackling Asia's tigers

As Britain's engineering companies emerge from recession, the short-term
domestic outlook looks reasonably bright. But for many, prospects for
sustained long-term growth lie beyond the mature markets of the UK,
continental Europe and North America. Returns will be higher in the
fast-growing developing and industrialising economies of Asia - China, the
Asian 'tigers' and countries still only on the edge of the commercial map
such as Vietnam and Burma. In the first of a summer series, Andrew Baxter
looks at how UK engineering companies are gearing up for this growth and
talks to some of their top executives working in the region.
Along with all UK engineering company executives in Asia, Mr Gerry Malley
believes there are tremendous opportunities across the region. 'Asia is
bubbling over,' he says. But, as one would expect from the general manager
(Asia) of Weir Group, the Glasgow-based pumps and engineering products
company, Mr Malley is not letting euphoria go to his head.
'We made a decision early on to do the hard things,' he says. 'We are very
selective in what we bid for and will not be all things to all men; there
are some areas where we can't compete.'
Rather than try and sell what Mr Malley calls 'bread-and-butter stuff', Weir
is going for the high-tech-nology markets, where the products are not made
in Asia.
Mr Malley, who has been based in Asia for 11 years, says he is 'still amazed
at the ignorance of people' trying to exploit opportunities in the region.
'There are huge differences between countries and within countries. With
China, for example, you have to look at every province differently. But some
companies don't focus on an initial target - they just spill around Asia
without identifying opportunities.'
The selective strategy is already paying dividends for Weir. A strong export
performance in the Pacific Rim was one of the bright spots for the group
last year, when pre-tax profits slipped from Pounds 39.2m to Pounds 37.5m
overall; Weir Pumps won orders for pumps and related equipment from power
stations at Zouxian in China, Budge Budge in Calcutta, and the Ulchin
nuclear power plants in South Korea, while Hopkinsons, Weir Group's valve
company, benefited from Weir Pumps' success and also won contracts in its
own right for power stations including Shajiao in China and Taean in South
Korea.
This year there have been further contracts worth at least Pounds 10m from
the power generation industry in the region for Hopkinsons, Weir Pumps and
recently-acquired Darchem Engineering, which is supplying insulation systems
to a Hong Kong power station. Weir says India and east Asia should continue
to offer the most promising long-term opportunities in the power market
because of the shortage of generating capacity and the rapid growth in
economies.
Outside power, Weir's biggest coup this year was through Strachan &amp; Henshaw,
which won a Pounds 5m contract in China to supply two rail car dumper
systems for the Qinhuangdao coal export terminal.
Weir is well used to competition, and Mr Malley says it is giving a good
account of itself in Asia even if margins are hard-pressed.
'European competitors tend to be patchy, as we all are here,' he says. 'The
US are strong in Taiwan and the Philippines but are not making an impact
relative to their size, and the Japanese are being strangled by the yen.
We've seen a lot less of them in the region over the last four to five
years.'
There is room for Weir to expand, he says. The Asia/Pacific region,
excluding India, accounted for 15 per cent of Weir's sales last year, and Mr
Malley sees no reason why it should not be 25 per cent in three to five
years.
To achieve this, a number of changes have been made. Mr Malley, formerly
with Weir Pumps, has been given group responsibility for the region
stretching from Sri Lanka to New Zealand. He hopes to use Weir Pumps'
experience to help other parts of the group generate more sales, but without
reducing their independence. Weir Pumps comprise 70 per cent of sales in the
region, but a better balance between pumps and other products is achievable,
he says.
Mr Malley's role should also help the group win more contract 'packages'
involving more than one business - for example, pumps and valves.
Allied to this is a stronger presence on the ground. The valves business
will soon have its own local sales manager based, like Mr Malley, in Hong
Kong and focusing on China and Korea. Strachan &amp; Henshaw appointed its own
sales manager in May, also based in Hong Kong. A Singapore office was
reopened last year after a gap of a decade. The regional base will remain in
Hong Kong, but Mr Malley says he is 'looking back' at the opportunities in
south-east Asia. 'People like to have you on the doorstep,' he says.
Weir is bidding to supply pumps, valves and bulk-handling equipment for the
planned Tuas power station in Singapore, and Mr Malley sees further
opportunities in the water and sewage sector as the island state upgrades
its housing.
Indonesia represents a very large market opportunity, he says, and he
remains hopeful about Malaysia - although supplying equipment for any public
power station contracts will have to wait for the end of the Malaysian trade
ban.
