Ask any cross-section of analysts to nominate the toughest big company chief
executive job in Australia, writes Bruce Jacques, and chances are that
Goodman Fielder, the country's largest food group, will outpoll all comers.
So, when long-serving Goodman executive Barry Weir was promoted to the
managing director's post last week, it's scarcely surprising that investors
were underwhelmed.
They've seen it too many times before. Goodman has chewed up three chief
executives in the past half decade, culminating in last week's passing of
the high-profile former Elders executive, Michael Nugent.
Weir now has the task of improving the sluggish performance of the unwieldy
Goodman conglomerate whose structure remains a legacy of 1980s boom time
extravagance.
But he should be well equipped for the task. For a start, he's a survivor.
In his 17 years with Goodman, 58-year-old Weir has seen all manner of
management crises and worked in most parts of the business.
He won the chief executive's post by successfully expanding Goodman's
European operations, based around its Wessanen business, which have grown
under his stewardship to account for 25 per cent of the total business.
As a tested, long-term executive, Weir has a reputation as a team player who
is likely to improve shattered morale by redeveloping old-fashioned
camaraderie among his top executive team.
But Weir will get no honeymoon from the markets. Goodman's record of high
management turnover plus his age already have analysts calling him an
interim chief, 'just keeping the seat warm while the head-hunters find a
more high-powered candidate'.
Against that, the Goodman board is likely to be keen on stability at the top
after its recent experience.
