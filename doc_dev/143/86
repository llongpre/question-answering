   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' is an oddsmaker's
slight favorite for an Academy Awards sweep: best picture, Morgan
Freeman as best actor and Jessica Tandy as best actress.
   Bally's oddsmaker Lenny Del Genio, who has put out Oscar odds
for eight years, made ``Driving Miss Daisy'' an even-money favorite
to win the best picture award, followed closely by ``Born on the
Fourth of July'' at 6-5.
   Freeman is an even-money pick to win for best actor, while Tom
Cruise is also listed at even money to win for ``Born on the Fourth
of July.''
   Tandy is even money to win the Oscar for her role in ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' while Michelle Pfeiffer is listed at 6-5 to win for
``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   Del Genio's odds are for entertainment purposes only, as Nevada
gaming regulators forbid betting on anything other than sports
events or horse races in the state's sports books.
   Del Genio said the odds for best picture were the closest ever,
reflecting a race that is very much up in the air going into the
Academy Awards show March 26 in Los Angeles.
   ``This year can go any way,'' he said. ``All of the nominations
for best picture are strong in their support.''
   Del Genio's odds in the top categories:
   Best Picture _ ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' even money; ``Born on the
Fourth of July,'' 6-5; ``My Left Foot,'' 3-1; ``Dead Poets
Society,'' 4-1; ``Field of Dreams,'' 5-1.

Day-Lewis ``My Left Foot,'' 6-5; Robin Williams ``Dead Poets

``Music Box,'' 3-1; Pauline Collins ``Shirley Valentine,'' 4-1;
