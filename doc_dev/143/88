at Weir

<TEXT>
Disappointing order levels in the second quarter held back Weir Group, the
pumps and engineering products company which yesterday announced a Dollars
210.5m (Pounds 136m) US acquisition partly funded by a Pounds 96m rights
issue at 252p and a 10.6 per cent increase in interim profits.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 18.5m in the 26 weeks to July 1, against
Pounds 16.8m, despite a Pounds 1.3m fall in interest income to Pounds
334,000. However, the company cautioned that the comparative figure was
affected by a Pounds 2.43m exceptional charge for redundancy costs.
Earnings per share increased to 8.3p (7.4p) and the interim dividend is
raised 7 per cent from 1.925p to 2.06p.
The shares closed 2p higher at 304p although analysts expressed
disappointment about the company's flat order book. Lord Weir, chairman,
said order intake for the first quarter was strong but fell in the second
quarter.
For the first half of the year he said the order intake closely matched
turnover at Pounds 213m (Pounds 223.6m) and for 1994 as a whole he said
turnover was likely to be similar to last year's Pounds 449m.
Lord Weir said business conditions had shown little change. 'While there
remain many opportunities in the market, particularly overseas, competition
is still strong and we are not minded to take business at inadequate margins
simply for the sake of volume.
'As has been the case now for some two years, demand for spares has still to
recover to historic levels.'
Although he acknowledged that the level of order intake in the second half
was 'obviously not a helpful factor in the remainder of the year', he
expressed confidence that the group would nevertheless produce satisfactory
results and, 'a creditable performance in the circumstances'.
COMMENT
Weir had been looking for a suitable acquisition to boost its international
sales. The US acquisition was welcomed yesterday as a sensible deal at a
reasonable price. EnviroTech's products are seen as complementing Weir's
specialist engineering products and will provide the group with much
improved international sales and marketing coverage. Analysts, however, were
disappointed by the news on the order book and the group's slow growth.
Pre-tax profits should still top Pounds 39m this year, but the shares, which
are trading on a forward multiple of about 17, look fully valued compared
with others in the sector.
