   Tucson Electric Power Co., which slashed its common dividend more than 50% last week, told analysts that no additional cuts in the quarterly pay-out should be expected. 

   Speaking to the financial community in New York, Tucson Electric's president and chief executive officer, Thomas C. Weir, said the lowering of the dividend to 40 cents a share from 97.5 cents a share followed a study of projected cash flows and earnings. 

   Mr. Weir added that Tucson Electric "intends to develop improved relations with the Arizona Corporation Commission as a necessary step in returning the company to financial health." 

   At the same time, Mr. Weir informed the analysts that Tucson Electric "will lose money on its utility operations until adequate rate relief and additional sales of capacity can be achieved." 
The company, in a statement based on Mr. Weir's presentation, said its next rate increase application will be filed shortly after a decision in the pending rate case, expected in the next few weeks. 

   The pending rate action asks for a 22% increase in base rates and an additional surcharge to recover fuel and purchased power costs. 

   The analysts also were told that subsidiary results may reflect additional provisions for losses, which may further reduce earnings in 1989.
