FRANCE'S WORKING-CLASS HERO

<P>
It seems like only yesterday that Gerard Depardieu was the enfant terrible of 
French film, startling filmgoers with his portrayal of an amoral delinquent in 
"Going Places," Bertrand Blier's outrageous 1974 sex comedy. 
</P>
<P>
Nibbling on pasta at a cozy Hollywood eatery, Depardieu is grumpily bemoaning 
the new generation of lazy, empty-headed French actors. "The young French 
actors are total egomaniacs," he growls in halting English. "These acting 
schools they go to -- all they do is turn them inward, not outward." 
</P>
<P>
Searching for an appropriately scathing image, Depardieu abruptly switches to 
his native tongue. "They've become so self-absorbed," he says in torrid French 
through an interpreter. "In my time, we read the classics. Moliere. 
Shakespeare. Anything we could get our hands on. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, if you ask a French actor to recite from Racine, they wouldn't know what 
to do. All they know is Stanislavsky. When I started out 20 years ago, the 
great actors all had a strong theater background. But the young actors today 
only think about film." 
</P>
<P>
He frowns, running a meaty hand through his long mane of hair. "Now our actors 
do one or two movies and -- voila -- they're stars. They want everything 
without doing anything. 
</P>
<P>
"I get letters all the time from parents saying, 'My son loves the acting 
profession.' " 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu flashes a triumphant smile. "So I reply, 'That's wonderful, but does 
the acting craft love him?' " 
</P>
<P>
It's no secret that the camera loves Depardieu. At 41, he is the working-class 
hero of French cinema, as honored and beloved as Jean Gabin, Michel Simon, Yves 
Montand or any other titans of past eras. It's perhaps a sign of his screen 
magnetism that when Peter Weir needed a burst of inspiration to finish his 
script for "Green Card," he simply put a photo of Depardieu on display at his 
desk as he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Though Depardieu made his mark with Blier's raffish satires, the bulky actor 
has played everything from a 16th-Century wanderer in "The Return of Martin 
Guerre" to a baffled modern-day husband in "Get Out Your Handkerchiefs." 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to imagine many actors who have ranged so far and wide in the cinema. 
Depardieu was Danton in Andrzej Wajda's compelling account of the French 
Revolution and Rodin in Bruno Nuytten's "Camille Claudel." He also picked up 
best-actor prizes in such films as "The Last Metro" (his only movie with 
Francois Truffaut) and Maurice Pialat's "Police." 
</P>
<P>
American audiences will soon be seeing Depardieu in two of his most formidable 
challenges. He opens Tuesday as the eloquent swordsman hero of "Cyrano de 
Bergerac," which won him the best-actor prize at the Cannes Film Festival. On 
Sunday, he opens in "Green Card," Weir's romantic comedy, which features 
Depardieu in his first major English-language film as a Frenchman who engineers 
a marriage of convenience so he can move to America. 
</P>
<P>
As it turns out, language was just as much a barrier making "Cyrano" as it was 
in "Green Card." The film, adapted from Edmond Rostand's classic play, was shot 
on location in both Hungary and France, using 2,000 actors and extras. Most of 
the extras were Hungarian. 
</P>
<P>
"That made it very difficult to coordinate everyone's movements during the big 
crowd scenes," he explains. "Since the extras didn't speak French, they didn't 
always know where I was going next. They all look very impressed by my 
speeches, but most of them didn't understand a word I was saying!" 
</P>
<P>
Since the film's dialogue is delivered in Alexandrine verse, which contains 12 
syllables in each line (English verse is commonly 10-syllable iambic 
pentameter), Depardieu found himself choreographing sweeping physical movements 
and sword play to fit the extended lines of verse. 
</P>
<P>
"We rehearsed the film like we would a play," says Depardieu, who spent an hour 
each day having his already ample nose enlarged for the part. "We all sat 
around a table for two weeks and practiced, so we could visualize how it would 
work." 
</P>
<P>
With 60 films to his credit in less than 20 years, Depardieu is an actor who 
seems obsessed with keeping busy. A chunky man with a torso that looks like it 
could support a freeway overpass, he says he enjoys carousing at night -- but 
insists he's always ready for work every morning. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu jokes that the only time he has free time is when he's making a 
movie. "I know it sounds strange, but I like a strict schedule. That's when I 
really feel free." 
</P>
<P>
He's certainly not enthusiastic about doing in-depth interviews to promote his 
films. Out with a reporter on a brief visit here, Depardieu only allows an 
occasional glimpse of the playfulness he displays on movie sets. (He does joke 
about Warren Beatty's legendary sexual exploits, but quickly adds that the jest 
was "in parentheses," apparently a rough translation for off-the-record.) 
</P>
<P>
He apologizes about missing a previous interview, saying he had been worn out 
from a long day of media encounters. "I was exhausted," he says. "And probably 
drunk too." 
</P>
<P>
This time around, accompanied by a pretty young girlfriend who was flying with 
him to Australia, he sticks to mineral water. "It's great for jet lag," he 
advises. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently peeved about a recent Interview feature that he says misquoted him 
as bad-mouthing Robert De Niro ("that's so untrue -- he is a hero to me!"), 
Depardieu is all business. An hour into his interview, he becomes bored and 
restless, signaling an end to the chat by abruptly heading off to his 
limousine. 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu may find his publicity labors trying, but it was a series of 
interviews he did in Australia several years ago that got him his part in 
"Green Card." 
</P>
<P>
"I'd been writing a romantic comedy about an Englishman who comes to America 
and has to get a green card," explains Peter Weir in a separate interview. "And 
when it wasn't going very well, my wife suggested that I use Gerard as the 
model for the character. So, almost completely on a whim, I wrote the entire 
movie for him. 
</P>
<P>
"After I got started, Gerard came to Sydney for a film festival. I thought of 
calling him up, but I was afraid he might say no. So instead, I took a picture 
of him that ran with an interview he gave in the local paper and kept it on my 
desk as I wrote." 
</P>
<P>
Too nervous to simply send Depardieu's agent the completed script, Weir got on 
a plane, flew to Paris and spent a weekend with the actor at his country house. 
Weir says that the two men took long walks in the fields surrounding 
Depardieu's home, getting to know each other. The fact that Weir speaks French 
with as little confidence as Depardieu handles English was hardly an impediment 
once the creative juices began flowing. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a real rapport from the start," Weir says. "When we had trouble finding 
the right words to explain something, we simply pooled our two languages and 
made them one. We were never embarrassed to use whichever language expressed 
what we were trying to say." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu prefers to work with strong-minded directors who can provide him with 
rich, provocative material. His favorite remains longtime collaborator Blier, 
with whom he has made four films, including "Going Places," "Menage" and "Too 
Beautiful for You." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu was born in a small town in central France that had a nearby U.S. Air 
Force base. Fascinated by American culture, Depardieu went to see rock 'n' roll 
movies, stole blue jeans from laundry lines and hung out at the local train 
station, perfecting his James Dean impression. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was young I loved James Dean and Marlon Brando," he recalls. "But I 
liked so many American stars -- Gary Cooper, Robert Mitchum, Alan Ladd." He 
grins mischievously. "Even Victor Mature!" 
</P>
<P>
He insists he was extremely shy as a teen-ager. In fact, he believes his 
youthful timidity served him well as a performer. 
</P>
<P>
"There have been many great actors who stuttered in real life, but once they 
were on stage, they were completely relaxed," he says. "Certain kinds of 
obstacles can be assets, not just defects. There is something in the art of 
acting that transforms these difficulties into strengths and beauties." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu taps his fork on the table. "If you are only macho, like some actors 
you see today, you can't ever be shy. But if you are shy, you can still act 
macho. I am not afraid to show my feminine side -- it's part of what makes me a 
man." 
</P>
<P>
He waves the fork in the air. "Our society wants us to be men with (guts). But 
the greatest thing you can have as a man is to have the (guts) -- and the 
vulnerability too." 
</P>
<P>
Talk of success and celebrity bores him. "Who knows what success is anyway," he 
says. "I'm not a sportsman, trying to better my record. I try to make good 
movies, regardless of whether they make money or not. A good flop is better 
than two ordinary hits anyway." 
</P>
<P>
But are actors held in high regard in France, at least when compared to other 
artists? "The most respected artists are writers," Depardieu concludes after a 
thoughtful silence. "Then come the composers and musicians. After that, the 
film directors. The only actors who really matter are the ones who come along 
and release creative energy." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu throws his hands into the air, mimicking a bomb blast. "They are the 
detonators. They inspire writers to release a blast of creative energy, which 
can make great movies." 
</P>
<P>
Depardieu is, of course, too modest to describe himself as such a detonator. 
But hearing him detail his relationship with Blier, it seems that he relishes 
just such a role. 
</P>
<P>
"We make movies together, the way Scorsese does with De Niro," he says. "I 
don't like to just take a script and say, 'OK, I'll do it.' Blier and I are so 
close that he doesn't even have to explain anymore. We know what each other is 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
Could Depardieu ever reach such instinctive harmony with Weir (who hopes to do 
another film with him) or an American filmmaker? "I hope so," he says. "But 
when it comes to American movies, I have a long way to go, not just because I 
don't understand the language, but because I need to understand the spirit of 
the language. 
</P>
<P>
"But what makes film so beautiful is that it helps you discover so much about 
different cultures. If you see a Bunuel film, you learn about the Spanish and 
their problems with God. If you see a French film, you understand we have our 
problems with sex." 
</P>
<P>
And what has Depardieu discerned about Hollywood films and their vision of 
Americans? "Ah," he says with mock gravity. "You Americans. Your trouble is 
with guilt." 
</P>
<P>
Guilt but not sex? "Oh yes, sex too," he says with a laugh. "But only because 
it makes you feel so guilty!"
