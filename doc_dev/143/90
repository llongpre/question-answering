THE NEWLY-opened organ in St John's, Smith Square is the first concert organ
to be built in London for four decades - the last was the Royal Festival
Hall monster - and on Thursday evening several notable organists swelled the
audience to hear Gillian Weir put it through its paces.
Her recital provided the first real test of the instrument's versatility. In
last week's gala inauguration concert the organ had featured only as part of
the celebration; and Simon Preston's recital the day after was an all-Bach
affair. By contrast, Weir's pot-pourri programme covered the spectrum from
Bach and his slightly senior contemporaries to Messiaen and some younger
20th-century composers.
There is no doubting the instrument's capabilities: in all areas of the
repertory it sounded eloquent, and the Bonn organ building firm of Klais has
matched it perfectly to the scale of the building. It is bright but not
strident in Baroque music; the action is alive to the demands of modern
works, and the stops are colourful. The fiery reeds are not too rough for
the Romantic repertory, but here the tracker action produces an intrusive
'chiff' in quieter passages and at times the pedal department seemed
underpowered.
The evening got off to a worrying start, with a dull Bruhns E minor Prelude
and Fugue. None of the threads of its rather disjointed structure was tied
together, and Miss Weir never allowed the music to take flight. Her account
of the Bach Passacaglia was unworthy - the playing messy, even frantic, the
registration unrelenting. For once there was no poetry or majesty in this
towering masterpiece.
But she more than redeemed herself with a dazzling account of the Belgian
Joseph Jongen's rhapsodic Sonata Eroica, making light of its virtuoso
demands. Most of the second half was devoted to post-1945 pieces, and all
were dispatched with ease and sensitivity. The organ responded equally well
to her incisively played set of Calvin Hampton dances and to the ethereal
bird-calls of Messiaen's 'Les Oiseaux et les sources' (from the Messe de la
pentecote). A highlight was the exhilarating Salamanca by Guy Bovet,
exotically coloured.
Saint-Saens's 'Echo' Fantaisie, a rousing finale, gave the audience another
chance to admire Miss Weir's dexterity at the console - St John's have even
installed an innovative projection screen which allowed us to witness it in
close-up. Indeed, the whole project blends state-of-the-art modern
technology with the best of the old.
Further recitals in the 'Notes Tremendous' series: Daniel Chorzempa (October
28,29), Jon Laukvik (November 4,5), Alexander Fiseisky (November 23, 24)
