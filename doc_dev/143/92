<LEADPARA>  PEOPLE are talking about the Norman Mailer-Gore Vidal talkfest appearing in
Esquire for May. Reformed party girl-turned-writer Carole Mallory conducted
the get-together, acted as referee and fired the questions. The result is
simply marvelous theater on the page.;    Esquire notes of its article, titled
"The Big Schmooze," that for nearly 20 years, Mailer and Vidal have jabbed and
slugged and said mean things to each other. During their long period of
enmity, Mailer called Vidal "a liar and hypocrite." Vidal said, "Henry Miller
. . . Norman Mailer . . . Charles Manson . . . a logical progression."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But now these two giants of American writing have come to grips with each
other and have fallen into what appears to be a grudging kind of "like.";   
In their long chat, they speak of many things, including Teddy Kennedy, Truman
Capote, Tennessee Williams, the two-party system, the New York Times and booze
(Mailer: "I made a lot of terrible mistakes drinking, and got into a lot of
ugly situations, but I don't regret it, because I think I would have been dead
of cancer 20 years ago if I hadn't been drinking.");    TINSEL TALK: Hottest
rumor in Tinsel Town has the venerable William Morris Agency trying to merge
with the elite small agency Triad, which boasts exactly four very big stars --
Bruce Willis, Patrick Swayze, William Hurt and Melanie Griffith -- plus a
roster of lesser lights.;    William Morris has had one of the longest
Excedrin headaches in 10-percenter history. That big name, Tom Hanks, just
walked out of the agency to go to Creative Artists. (He is still smarting over
the reviews and box-office on "Joe and the Volcano" and "Bonfire of the
Vanities.");    Hanks joins a long list of departing heavy-hitting actors,
directors and producers -- Julia Roberts, Christopher Walken, Anjelica Huston,
Costa-Gavras, Norman Jewison, Alan Pakula, Tim Robbins, Andie MacDowell, Renny
Harlin, Peter Weir. (Of course, William Morris still has Clint Eastwood.);
From Marilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;    VIDEOLAND VIEW:
Carrie Fisher, who planned to exec-produce Disney's big-screen adaptation of
her "Christmas in Vegas" short story, has put that project on hold.;   
Fisher's concentrating on "Esme's Little Nap," the CBS sitcom she's written
and is producing for her mother, Debbie Reynolds. They're shooting the
prototype edition now, and though they will take "a nice long breather of a
couple months" before they shoot the five additional segments to which the
network's committed, Fisher doesn't feel there will be enough time to turn her
attention to other projects.;    TWO FOR THE ROAD: Look for Rod Stewart to
commence his U.S. tour for the "Vagabond Heart" album in August. Rocker Rod
plans to blend new material with such classics as "Stay With Me," "Mandolin
Wind," and "Every Picture Tells a Story.";    Bob Hope heads to Bali later
this year to shoot his third special of the fall season. That Indonesian Eden
was the setting of "The Road to Bali," which he made with Bing Crosby and
Dorothy Lamour 40 years ago -- but for that film, Hope and team never left the
Paramount lot.;    BEST-LAID PLANS: Looks like the long-planned "Odd Couple"
reunion of Jack Klugman and Tony Randall won't be happening after all.
Klugman, who lost a vocal cord during cancer surgery in 1989, is reportedly up
to making the TV movie, but now we're told that NBC has cooled on its cost.  </TEXT>
