<LEADPARA>  After weeks of escalating criticism from his own party's right wing,
Republican U.S. Sen. John Seymour announced Saturday he opposes AB 101, a bill
on Gov. Pete Wilson's desk that would outlaw job discrimination against
homosexuals in California.;   His announcement comes just weeks after Seymour
took considerable heat from conservatives at the California Republican Party
convention in Anaheim.  </LEADPARA>

SEYMOUR'S STAND FOLLOWS GOP HEAT  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     In a statement released Saturday, Seymour said the gay-rights bill would
"promote yet another flood of litigation" and that it "raises more questions
than it answers.";   He added: "I believe that adequate safeguards against
discrimination are available, and they should be vigorously enforced.";  
Gay-rights activists weren't pleased.;   "It's scary. Seymour's statement does
not bode well for the governor signing this bill," said David Smith of the Los
Angeles Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center in Hollywood. "We're
convinced Seymour is a good, reliable thermometer on Wilson's view because
they share the same philosophy.";   No issue had stirred more controversy
within the GOP than gay rights, a cause that cuts sharply between Republicans
on religious and moral grounds.;   Conservative delegates to the convention
fumed at Wilson, who appointed Seymour, and at Seymour for being proponents of
the "homosexual movement.";   Seymour is running for election to his Senate
seat in 1992. Wilson has not yet indicated whether he will sign or veto the
gay-rights bill.;   Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Fullerton, one of Seymour's
opponents in the June primary, had relentlessly attacked the former Anaheim
mayor and state senator for not taking a stand on AB 101.;   "What's happening
here is that John Seymour is beginning to feel the heat of his own colleagues"
in the GOP, Dannemeyer said at the Republican convention this month.;   Jeff
Weir, Seymour's California press secretary, said the senator announced his
position Saturday so people would know where he stands, not to deflect
political heat from his party's right.;   "It is a big-enough state issue that
it might help clarify some things if (Seymour) gives the public his view on
the bill," Weir said. "The truth is, (gay rights) is Bill Dannemeyer's
obsession, not John Seymour's.";   But a spokesman for Dannemeyer questioned
what Seymour stands for.;   "There was a great line in the California Journal
in which they said John Seymour seems to be cast in Jell-O," Dannemeyer
campaign spokesman Roger Scott said.;   Wilson picked Seymour as his Senate
replacement after being elected governor last year.;   "It's hard to tell in
the crystal ball who will get the most mileage out of this politically," Weir
said of Seymour's announcement.  </TEXT>
