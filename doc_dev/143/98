FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Weir maintains growth with Pounds 39m

WEIR GROUP, the Glasgow-based engineering concern, delivered a 10th year of
profits growth in 1992, pushing the pre-tax figure up by 14 per cent from
Pounds 34.2m to Pounds 39.2m.
Lord Weir, chairman, said the concentration on specialist engineering and
services had paid off, as had getting out of such 'commodity' activities as
steel foundries.
About 60 per cent of sales were overseas and its UK business was in the more
resilient sectors of oil and power.
Turnover in the 53 weeks (52 weeks) remained flat at Pounds 424.8m after the
inclusion of Pounds 23.1m from a US acquisition.
Mr Ron Garrick, chief executive, said short-term orders, such as for spare
parts, were down in the first nine months. 'About Pounds 30m of business
that we expected did not appear.' The inflow had improved over the past six
months.
The slackness had mainly affected the engineering services division, where
operating profit fell from Pounds 8m to Pounds 6.18m on sales of Pounds
80.4m (Pounds 87.3m).
Engineering products advanced to Pounds 26m (Pounds 20.3m), including a
near-Pounds 2m acquisition contribution. The margin improvement was partly
due to profits being taken towards the end of contracts.
Lord Weir said that although the order book had fallen from Pounds 470m to
Pounds 373m, the position was not bad. The previous year's figure was
abnormally large because of long-term contracts for desalination plant and
gas-handling equipment.
The balance sheet strengthened further to show Pounds 52.3m (Pounds 46.3m)
cash, of which Pounds 29m (Pounds 21m) was advance payments.
Mr Garrick said the group's acquisition policy was firmly in the field of
'mechanical engineering products that are difficult to make or design.'
Following the US purchase, a pump business in continental Europe would be an
ideal next step.
Earnings per share rose to 35.5p (32.1p). The final dividend is raised to
8.3p to make an 11.8p (10.5p) total. The company proposes to split its
shares, doubling the number in issue to about 156m.
COMMENT
Plaudits for Weir's management through recession have been amply expressed
in a share price rise from 227p in January 1991 to 668p last month. Now the
argument is that recovery stocks will lure away some of the money that
retreated to quality. Weir points out that it will continue to grow and that
the pound's devaluation helps its export prospects. Its irritation is
understandable at the idea that companies which have done badly are more
attractive. But its price looks high. On a pre-tax forecast of Pounds 42m,
its prospective p/e is more than 17 on last night's close of 649p. That
rating is more suitable to companies whose earnings are returning from a
depressed level. Assuming 10 per cent dividend growth, the prospective yield
is roughly 2.5 per cent, significantly below the market. While the case for
holding on to quality is strong, especially while tangible evidence of
recovery is weak, some profit might be taken.
