   Thomas C. Weir, 54 years old, most recently chairman and chief executive officer of Great American First Savings Bank of Arizona, was named chairman and a director of Arizona Commerce Bank. 

   He succeeds Ernest C. Garcia II, 30, who continues as a director and member of the executive committee. 

   Mr. Weir's election increases board membership to seven. 

   A spokesman said Mr. Garcia, a founder of the bank, is stepping aside because the bank has grown rapidly through acquisitions and needs a "career banker" at the helm. 
Mr. Garcia is a large shareholder in two additional savings and loans in Colorodo.
