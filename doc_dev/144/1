   Museum curators, history buffs and urban
cowboys bought up the biggest collection of William F. ``Buffalo
Bill'' Cody memorabilia ever auctioned Friday, including a
silver-trimmed rifle that brought $22,500.
   The collection, sold at Butterfield &amp; Butterfield, consisted of
more than 300 items originally preserved by Cody's sister, Julia
Cody Goodman.
   A pair of chaps worn by the Pony Express rider, Indian fighter,
buffalo hunter, Army scout and showman sold for $1,400, and a rope
lariat went for $500.
   A silver-handled Plains rifle fetched $22,500. Other items
included Cody's buffalo-hide coat and his silver-handled toothbrush.
   ``Who better symbolizes the American West than Buffalo Bill?''
asked R.L. Wilson, historical consultant to Colt Firearms Co. of
Hartford, Conn. He came to bid on a single-action Colt revolver,
one of eight guns in the collection.
   The collection was sold by Greg Martin, a San Francisco gun
collector and history buff who bought the artifacts for $300,000
last year in Billings, Mont. He had wanted to buy only a shotgun
inscribed to Cody, but had to buy the whole lot to get the shotgun
from the elderly owner.
   Rival bidders eyeing each other across the auction floor
included curator Paul Fees of the Buffalo Bill Museum in Cody,
Wyo., and Thomas B. Morrison of the Buffalo Bill Ranch Historic
Park in North Platte, Neb.
   They vied for a collection of letters to Cody's sister
discussing his marriage, the death of his son and other intimate
events.
   ``We are interested in the correspondence because it is so
revealing and personal,'' said Fees. ``We have a strong
biographical interest.''
   The collection was unique for its large number of personal
items, including a tomahawk from his friend D.F. ``White Beaver''
Powell and dozens of photographs, show bills and theater tickets
chronicling Cody's life as the roughrider who along with shooting
champion W. ``Doc'' Carver founded the first Wild West Show.
   Carl Otis, owner of Pawnee Bill's Wild West Exposition
Re-enacted, a Northern California traveling show, dressed in white
Stetson hat and buckskin jacket for the occasion. He bid $3,000 on
a Smith &amp; Wesson ivory-handled revolver used in Cody's Wild West
Show but the gun went for $9,000.
   Private collector George Kramer, a New Jersey real estate
developer, hoped to buy Cody's silver riding bit for his
80-year-old father, who still rides. But he bid first on Cody's
Winchester rifle, inscribed and hand-carved with buffalo.
   ``That's the one item I wanted most,'' said Kramer, who
successfully bid $11,000 for it.
