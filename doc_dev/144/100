<HEAD>``Coach'' Producer Apologizes for Insulting Buffalo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The executive producer of the television
show ``Coach'' apologized for insulting Buffalo during a promo that
ran on national television at halftime of Monday night's football
game.
   In the promo, actor Jerry Van Dyke, who plays an assistant coach
in the ABC-TV series, said the Buffalo Bills would lose no matter
what the final score of their game against the New York Jets was.
   ``Even if you (Buffalo) win, you lose,'' Van Dyke said. ``You
still have to go home to Buffalo.''
   The line prompted dozens of outraged telephone calls to WKBW-TV,
ABC's Buffalo affliate, and the station's newscasters denounced
the remark on the air the next day.
   Barry Kemp, the series' chief writer and executive producer,
said the line was ``a thoughtless slip.''
   ``I apologize to the people of Buffalo. It was uncalled for,''
Kemp told The Buffalo News. ``I will figure out some way of making
it up to Buffalo. We'll put something positive on the show to make
it up.''
