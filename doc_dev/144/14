<TEXT>  LINE: Buffalo is favored by 4 1/2 points.; TELEVISION/RADIO: CH7CH11/KCBS
(740).; RECORDS: Buffalo is 9-1 and in first place in the AFC East. Miami is
5-5, third in the AFC East.; SERIES: The Dolphins lead the series 35-15-1. In
the season opener, Buffalo scored 28 points in the second quarter and defeated
Miami 35-31. Don Shula has coached more victories against the Bills (32) than
any other team.; BILLS UPDATE: Buffalo has won 11 consecutive games against
AFC East teams, including three in a row against Miami. The Bills are known
for their passing game, but they have passed 311 times and rushed 304 times.
Thurman Thomas (968 yards) is the NFL's rushing leader. Green Bay scored 24
points last week against the Bills. Unfortunately for the Packers, Buffalo
scored 34.; DOLPHINS UPDATE: QB Dan Marino is finally getting some protection.
The Dolphins' offensive line has allowed only three sacks in the past five
games after yielding 13 in the first five. Dolphins defenders will hope their
offense can control the ball. Buffalo ranks 26th in the NFL in run defense,
and RB Sammie Smith is looking for a big game. Miami's defense has forced an
AFC-low five fumbles.; KEY INJURIES: Bills -- T Will Wolford (back) is
questionable; QB Jim Kelly (back) is probable. Dolphins -- DT Bert Weidner
(shoulder) is questionable; DE Jeff Cross (groin) is probable.  </TEXT>
