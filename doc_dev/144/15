<MEMO>  The NFL/Week 6  </MEMO>
<TEXT>  TV/RADIO: ch. 7, 11/KCBS (740).; RECORDS: Buffalo is 5-0, first in the AFC
East. Kansas City is 3-2, second in the AFC West.; BILLS UPDATE: All-Pro DE
Bruce Smith is making his second start since recovering from knee surgery.
With Smith and NT Jeff Wright out because of injuries, the defense has given
up an average of 137 yards a game rushing -- a big factor in opponents
averaging 23 points per game. Smith did not have a tackle in his first game
back last week, but in beating the previously unbeaten Chicago Bears 35-20,
Buffalo held Neal Anderson to 54 yards rushing and the Bears to 84 rushing
yards. The Bills' powerful offense, led by QB Jim Kelly and RB Thurman Thomas,
has averaged an AFC-high 32.4 points per game. No Chiefs opponent has scored
more than 17 points this season, and the Bills have not scored fewer than 17
in any game.; CHIEFS UPDATE: The Chiefs still believe they might have beaten
the Bills in the playoffs last season had their road to Buffalo not stopped in
Miami. The Chiefs can run -- the Bills are last in the league in ball control
and are 24th against the rush. Behind Christian Okoye and Barry Word, Kansas
City's rushing game has averaged a respectable 110 yards. With QB Steve DeBerg
off to a slow start, the Chiefs' passing game is averaging less than 148 yards.  </TEXT>
