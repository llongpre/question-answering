<LEADPARA>  Mercury News Staff Writer;   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. -- When it comes to a Buffalo
Bills-Miami Dolphins matchup, perhaps it would be best to tally up the points
and individual plaudits with a pinball machine, just to keep up with the
darned thing.  </LEADPARA>

BUFFALO MAINTAINS MASTERY OF DOLPHINS  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     The numbers rattled off with a familiar vengeance Sunday. Running back
Thurman Thomas became the first Buffalo player with more than 100 yards
rushing and receiving in the same game. Wide receiver Andre Reed caught 11
passes for 154 yards and a touchdown. Quarterback Jim Kelly, overcoming an
ankle injury, threw for 381 yards -- the most in his career -- leading the
Bills to a wild, season-opening 35-31 victory over the Dolphins before 80,252
at Rich Stadium.;   Considering Miami's 44-34 loss in the snowy Jan. 12
playoff game on Rich Stadium's tundra and a 24-14 stumble last December
against the Bills that erased all hope of home-field advantage in the
playoffs, you could say the Dolphins were primed to wash away the memories of
last season's bad luck against Buffalo. But the Bills, depleted as they were
on defense without pass-rushing defensive end Bruce Smith, who still is
nursing a surgically repaired right knee, have retained the deed when it comes
to owning Miami's number.;   "It's depressing knowing that they knocked us out
of home-field advantage up here and they knocked us out of the playoffs up
here in January and then to start the year, they do it to us again," said
Miami Coach Don Shula, whose team is minus 11 starters, four of whom are
contract holdouts.;   The Bills, despite early use of their defense-rattling,
no-huddle attack, had to come back to do it.;   Kicker Scott Norwood, the goat
of Super Bowl XXV for missing a 47-yard field goal with four seconds
remaining, preserving the New York Giants' 20-19 victory, choked Sunday on a
25-yard gimme capping Buffalo's opening drive. Miami then took a 7-0 lead as
Dan Marino (17 of 28, 267 yards, three touchdowns) tossed 43-yard flea-flicker
to Mark Clayton for a touchdown -- keeping Clayton's streak of consecutive
games with at least one reception alive at 64 -- with 8 minutes, 56 seconds
remaining in the first quarter.;   An interception by safety Louis Oliver set
up a 3-yard run by running back Mark Higgs, a return man who rushed for 146
yards in 30 carries filling in for starter Sammie Smith, who's out with a knee
injury. Higgs' touchdown put Miami ahead 14-0.;   By then, though, the
Kelly-Thomas machine was primed to go. On third-and-five from the Buffalo
46-yard line, Kelly launched a 54-yard scoring pass to Reed, pulling the Bills
closer, 14-7, with 8:45 remaining before halftime.;   Charlie Baumann's
21-yard field goal at the start of the third period increased Miami's lead to
17-7. And the Bills' problems seemed to worsen when Kelly came up limping
after Dolphins nose tackle T.J. Turner rolled onto Kelly's left ankle on a
sack attempt.;   Kelly left the field, ostensibly for the rest of the game
with a sprain. But three plays later, backup Frank Reich hit tight end Butch
Rolle on a 3-yard play-action fake, pulling Buffalo closer, 17-14.;   Would
that be it for Kelly? Hey, this guy's tough. No way.;   "It's going to take a
lot more than a bum ankle to keep me out of a game," said Kelly, who came back
to complete 29 of 39 attempts, with two touchdown passes.;   So back he came
on the next series, driving Buffalo 30 yards to midfield. On second-and-eight,
Kelly threw 30 yards on a post to Thomas, who blew past safety Jarvis Williams
and sprinted 20 yards down the right sideline for a 50-yard touchdown
reception, giving the Bills their first lead, 21-17, with 2:10 left in the
third quarter.;   Wide receiver Don Beebe's fumble set up a 5-yard scoring
pass from Marino to Clayton (6 catches, 138 yards two touchdowns), and Miami
regained the lead 24-21 with 11:18 remaining.;   But the Bills answered with a
1-yard touchdown run by fullback Carwell Gardner to pull ahead again, 28-24.; 
 Thomas scored from seven yards out to increase the lead to 35-24, and Miami
capped the scoring with Marino's 3-yard touchdown toss to Duper with 2:32
remaining.; BILLS 35, DOLPHINS 31; (box) THE HERO: Buffalo's Thurman Thomas
rushed for 165 yards and added 108 yards receiving to become the first Bill to
surpass 100 yards in both categories in one game.;   (box) THE GOAT: Bills
kicker Scott Norwood, who missed the potential winning field goal in the Super
Bowl in January, shanked a 25-yard effort with his first kick Sunday.;   (box)
KEY PLAY: Bills QB Jim Kelly hobbled back onto the field after suffering an
ankle injury to toss a 50-yard scoring strike to Thomas to give Buffalo its
first lead, 21-17.  </TEXT>
