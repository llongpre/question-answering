   ``In my book a pioneer is a man who turned all the grass upside
down, strung bob-wire over the dust that was left, poisoned the
water and cut down the trees, killed the Indian who owned the land,
and called it progress. If I had my way, the land here would be like
God made it, and none of you SOBs would be here at all.''
   _ Montana artist Charles M. Russell to a group of Great Falls
citizens who threw a celebration in honor of themselves in the 1920s.

   The white men called it ``next year'' country.
   Next year the rains will come, the prairie fires (or locust or
'hoppers or blizzards) won't. Next year the price of wheat will be
up, taxes down. Next year the bank'll be paid off, the truck'll be
paid up, the cows'll pay for themselves.
   That's the American West: Next Year Country.
   Except this year.
   This year North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and Washington are
celebrating their 100th birthdays, and they're having a rip-roarin'
party stetching most of the way from the Missouri River to the
Pacific Ocean.
   Wyoming and Idaho have caught the spirit, too, because next year
marks their centennials. If you missed the huge barbecues, cattle
drives, rodeos, fairs, powwows, fishing tournaments, parades,
dances, and the 101 other festivities this year, Idaho and Wyoming
promise encores in '90.
   President Bush, who earlier took part in North Dakota's
centennial observance, heads to Sioux Falls, S.D., and Helena,
Mont., on Monday to join in festivities, then on to Spokane, Wash.,
on Tuesday.
   Centennial celebrations are milestones measured long ago in much
of the rest of the nation. Virginians, Floridians, even Missourians,
may wonder: Why all the fuss?
   Well, the West has always been America's young upstart, the
shirttail relative of the establishment East, the antebellum South,
the Spanish Southwest, the conservative, agrarian Midwest.
   But in the 1980s, the West has come of age and come into its own.
It has a cachet sought by CEOs as well as collegians. Everywhere you
look, from Hollywood's movies to Detroit's cars (Mustang, Cherokee,
Dakota, Bronco) to Ralph Lauren's and Calvin Klein's designer denim
fashion, the West is IN.
   Ask Bill Cody, the 76-year-old grandson of Buffalo Bill. ``When I
was born, Granddad was one of the most famous men in the world,''
said Cody, a lookalike for the old showman. ``Even today, I go to
Singapore, Greece, Europe _ hell, even Sri Lanka _ and the locals
know about the West because of Buffalo Bill.''
   Although Thomas Jefferson never saw the West, the third president
heard the siren singing in the lonely wind there and he had a
vision. He traveled only as far as Harper's Ferry, W.Va., but
imagined the fledgling United States stretching from the Potomac to
the Columbia River, south to the mouth of the Mississippi, and north
to the headwaters of the Missouri.
   ``All eyes, all hopes, are now fixed on you,'' Jefferson wrote in
January 1803 to James Monroe, urging him to be his special envoy to
France and negotiate the Louisiana Purchase. ``On the event of this
mission depends the future destinies of this republic.''
   Monroe pulled it off. For $15 million, the United States acquired
the entire 830,000-square-mile territory claimed by France in the
New World.
   Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Bernard De Voto described it as
one of the most important events in history.
   ``Not only did it double the area of the United States, not only
did it add to our wealth resources of incalculable value, not only
did it provide a potential that was certain to make us a great
power, not only did it make equally certain that we would expand
beyond the Rockies to the Pacific ... it also provided the
centripetal, unifying force that would hold the nation firm against
disruptive forces from within,'' wrote De Voto.
   Even before his diplomats had sealed the deal, Jefferson had
secretly asked Congress for $2,500 to cover the cost of dispatching
an expedition up the Missouri River and on to the Pacific ``for the
purpose of extending the external commerce of the United States.''
The reason was a red herring, innocuous so as not to alarm the
British or Spanish who still held enormous tracts in North America.
   But it was excuse enough for Army Capts. Meriwether Lewis and
William Clark, co-commanders, to leap at the opportunity to chart a
map marked ``Unknown.''
   Lewis, who grew up on a farm called Locust Hill only 10 miles by
straight gallop northwest of Jefferson's Virginia estate Monticello,
called the chance to explore the West ``a darling project of my
heart.''
   Young Albert Gallatin, an immigrant from Switzerland who had a
good head for numbers, was Jefferson's treasury secretary and
therefore responsible for paying the venture's bills. Lewis and
Clark remembered by christening a river after him.
   Today the Gallatin name is attached to many western landmarks,
including a Montana county and the Bozeman airport. Gallatin's
oldest living descendant, Beatrice Gallatin Beuf, 82, lives just
over the Montana border in Big Horn, Wyo.
   ``When my father bought this ranch in 1911 we traveled by train
from New York to Sheridan, and there were hitching posts on Main
Street and nothing was paved,'' she recalled. ``We were met at the
station by a wagon pulled by four horses, their tails tied up in mud
knots. It took us four hours to travel 13 miles.''
   Mrs. Beuf's ranch reaches into the Big Horn Mountains, where she
still rides her Arabian mare every fair day. It was she who was
asked to sit next to Queen Elizabeth II, when the monarch dined in
Big Horn on a 1984 private visit, and regale her with stories.
   ``This is a place where the glamorous days of the cowboy are just
over your shoulder,'' said Mrs. Beuf. ``You're not choked in with
people troubles. Here your troubles are big ones: drought, too much
snow, a wind that can carry you away. Here we live with the great
realities of life.''
   After Lewis and Clark came the mountain men. The traders
followed, paddling up the Missouri and the Yellowstone rivers. As
the buffalo massacres decimated the herds, cattlemen from as far
away as the Rio Grande and even the Clyde in Scotland saw the
potential and shrewdly staked out giant ranches.
   When gold was discovered, miners stampeded for Dakota Territory
by the thousands, enterprising merchants hot on their heels.
Finally, with the 1862 Homestead Act promising 160 acres to anyone
with a strong back and the means to claim the land, sodbusters
followed.
