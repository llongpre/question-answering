<TEXT>     "We've all been around long enough to know that isn't the Buffalo Bills
football team," Schottenheimer said after the Chiefs romped to a 33-6 victory
over the previously unbeaten AFC champions. "It was one of those nights where
everything fell our way.";   The Bills, averaging more than 32 points and 450
yards in winning their first five games, suffered six sacks, five lost fumbles
and their most lopsided loss in four years. They managed only 211 net yards,
and the Chiefs (4-2), who had only 182 yards the week before in a one-point
victory over San Diego, rolled to 397.;   "This was not only the best
defensive game I've ever been associated with," said defensive end Bill Maas,
who had two sacks. "It was the greatest game I've ever been associated with.";
  The victory snapped a five-game Monday night losing streak for the Chiefs,
who had not played a Monday night game in Kansas City since 1983.;   "There
was a lot of energy, a lot of adrenaline flowing," Maas said. "Our defense
shut down the No. 1 offense. Our offense held the ball and ran and ran and
ran. It was a night to remember.";   Christian Okoye, who rushed for 130 yards
and set a team record with his 13th 100-yard game, turned two Buffalo
turnovers into two touchdowns less than two minutes apart in the third quarter
for a 30-6 lead.;   Okoye reached the 100-yard rushing plateau for the 13th
time in his five-year career and passed Abner Haynes as the Chief with the
most 100-yard rushing games.;   Rookie Harvey Williams rushed for 103 yards.; 
 "By the time the fourth quarter rolled around, it was glorious," Maas said.; 
 "We gave them so many gifts, they should be happy until next Christmas," said
Kelly, who hit 17 of 23 passes for 189 yards.;   The Bills, who hadn't been
held without a TD since Dec. 4, 1988, suffered their worst defeat since a 47-6
loss to Indianapolis by replacement players during the 1987 strike. Derrick
Thomas had four of the Chiefs' sacks, with two of them causing fumbles.;   "We
believed in each other," Thomas said. "We thought we could get the job done.";
  The Bills still were in the game when Thurman Thomas took a pass from Jim
Kelly deep in Buffalo territory and was immediately hit by Lonnie Marts, who
knocked the ball loose for Kevin Ross to scoop up and run 13 yards to the
Buffalo 17.;   One play later, Okoye went over for a 23-6 lead with 2 minutes,
52 seconds left in the third quarter. A moment later, Thomas sacked Kelly,
knocking the ball loose, and Dan Saleaumua recovered on the 11. On
fourth-and-goal from the 2, Okoye knocked a defender backward into the end
zone.;   A fumble by Don Beebe on the ensuing kickoff led to Nick Lowery's
22-yard field goal. Lowery also kicked a 41-yarder in the first quarter, a
40-yarder in the second and a 24-yarder in the third.;   Thomas, the Bills'
leading rusher, left the game late in the quarter with an apparent ankle
injury.;   Even the officiating went against the Bills. Officials placed the
ball 5 yards away from where they should have after replay officials
overturned a Buffalo pass completion in the third period.;   The Bills were
without All-Pro defensive end Bruce Smith, who is out with a knee injury. But
it was a miserable homecoming for Bills' Coach Marv Levy, who coached the
Chiefs from 1978-82.;   "If a team can succeed in running the ball as well as
they did, you're in for a long night," Levy said. "They just overpowered us. I
hope we're not as bad as we looked. I think most routs -- and this was a rout
-- are not indicative of the difference between the two teams.";   The Chiefs
won with a formula all teams attempt against Buffalo: Once you get the
football, hold on to it for long drives and eat the clock. Kansas City led in
plays (38-28) and in possession time (19 minutes 15 seconds to 10:45) as it
built a 13-6 halftime lead.;   The Chiefs scored on the game's first
possession on Lowery's 41-yard field goal.;   Then with 7:40 left in the
quarter, Kansas City tight end Jonathon Hayes, after a huge hit by linebacker
Darryl Talley, fumbled at the Chiefs' 31 and cornerback Nate Odomes recovered
for Buffalo.;   But Kansas City got the ball back with 5:46 left when Maas
knocked Kelly down and the ball loose at the Kansas City 23. Marts recovered
and Kansas City then drove 77 yards in 12 plays, featuring daring play-calling
with play-action passes near the Bills' goal line. Tight end Pete Holohan's
1-yard catch from Steve DeBerg gave the Chiefs a 10-0 lead with 14:16 left in
the half.;   Buffalo's only points came on a 44-yard field goal from Scott
Norwood in the second quarter, and then a 25-yarder after wasting a first down
on the Chiefs 11 after Okoye fumbled.  </TEXT>
