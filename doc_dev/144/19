   Thirty dusty days on the Jim Bridger Trail
ended in rain Monday as the Wyoming Centennial Wagon Train rolled
into Cody with modern-day pioneers who relived the past to
celebrate the state's 100th birthday.
   Approximately 200 wagons and 1,600 riders on horseback were
greeted with a great whooping and hollering from several thousand
well-wishers who jammed streets and roof tops to watch the
four-mile-long procession.
   ``I wouldn't have bet there were this many horses in this whole
United States,'' lifelong Cody resident Frank McJunkin, 70, said as
he watched the parade of covered wagons, horses and exhausted but
delighted riders ramble by.
   The cavalry led the wagon train to the end of its 260-mile trek
along the Jim Bridger Trail, one of the main pioneer routes
northwest through Wyoming. Riders recreating the Pony Express
followed with state centennial flags.
   U.S. Sen. Alan Simpson, in a red Western shirt and beaded vest,
rode the last few miles with the wagon train and predicted that
years from now everyone will claim they rode along.
   ``There'll be as many people saying they rode the Wyoming
Centennial Wagon Train as said they saw Babe Ruth's last game at
Yankee Stadium _ about 7 million,'' said Simpson, who grew up in
this frontier town founded by showman Buffalo Bill Cody.
   Kayne Pyatt, the trail boss who oversaw the journey organized by
a group of enthusiasts, said, ``It's sort of like I've lived a
great childhood adventure, a fantasy. ... If I died tomorrow, I'd
be satisfied.''
   The riders started the day about 16 miles east of Cody and
followed alongside U.S. 14A, encountering a torrential downpour
about a mile out.
   Simpson and his wife, Ann, were joined on the final leg by
Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan and his wife, Jane, and Wyoming Rep.
Craig Thomas and his wife, Susan, all on horseback. Montana Gov.
Stan Stephens rode in a red surry.
   The sun broke through as they reached the edge of town, but
distant thunder and lightning added a dramatic backdrop. Horses
reared and bucked, riders waved and hollered and a few wagon
passengers played their fiddles to the Cody crowd.
   ``Cody loves you,'' some spectators yelled. ``Happy birthday
Wyoming!''
   Some of the trail riders welcomed the return to modern
conveniences, while others regretted reaching the end of the line.
   ``In a way, it's sad and in a way I'm glad to roll into Cody,''
said Ken Hagen, 71, of Roseau, Minn. ``The dust was the worst. Some
days, there was so much dust you couldn't see the team ahead of
you. And for six days, we never saw a tree.''
   The final miles brought together past and present, as modern-day
vehicles on the highway buzzed by the rumbling replica wagons.
   ``This is a chance for a person like me to be a part of history,
maybe not a significant part, but a part,'' said Mike Wozniak, of
Casper, who spent two days on the trail. ``This wagon train is not
going to happen again _ maybe not for another 100 years.''
   The train left Fort Caspar June 2. Besides the dust, it was
accompanied by fears the organizers wouldn't be able to pay their
bills.
   Arriving here, the organizers estimated they were about $100,000
shy of the approximately $500,000 they figured they'd need to pay
for things like hay, water and portable toilets.
   Participating costs ranged from $40 a day to just ride along in
your own rig, to $198 a day to ride on one provided.
   The organizers also raised money through contests and auctions
along the trail, and plan to raffle off an elk permit donated by
Gov. Mike Sullivan.
