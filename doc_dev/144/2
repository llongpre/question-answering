   A New Jersey developer and a Wild West show
owner are among the Western history buffs who bought up the largest
collection of ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody memorabilia ever auctioned _
with some pieces fetching more than twice their appraised value.
   ``Who better symbolizes the American West than Buffalo Bill?''
said buyer R.L. Wilson, a historical consultant to the Colt
Firearms Co. of Hartford, Conn., who bid Friday on one of eight
guns in the collection.
   The prices paid ranged from $175 for a telegram sent by the
legendary roughrider and showman to $22,500 for a silver-handled
Plains rifle.
   In all, more than $500,000 was spent on the collection of over
300 items, which were perserved by Cody's sister, Julia Cody
Goodman, auction officials said.
   The collection was sold by San Francisco gun collector Greg
Martin, who bought the artifacts for $300,000 last year, removing
them from storage in Billings, Mont., for the first time in 20
years.
   The collection was unique for its large number of personal
items, including Cody's buffalo-hide coat that sold for $18,000 and
a letter that sold for $3,575 in which Cody discusses the death of
his son. The prices included a 10 percent fee for the auction
house, Butterfield &amp; Butterfield.
   Also up for auction were other letters to Cody's sister
discussing his marriage and other intimate events.
   ``We are interested in the correspondence because it is so
revealing and personal,'' Paul Fees, curator of the Buffalo Bill
Museum in Cody, Wyo., said before the bidding began. ``We have a
strong biographical interest.''
   Other bidders for the letters included Thomas B. Morrison, of
the Buffalo Bill Ranch Historic Park in North Platte, Neb. Cody
descendant Walter Goodman of Dallas, Julia Cody's grandson, was
expected to bid for the letters by phone, Fees said. The names of
the successful bidders were not known.
   A pair of chaps worn by Cody sold for $1,400 and a rope lariat
went for $500. Other items included Cody's silver-handled
toothbrush, a family Bible and dozens of photographs, show bills
and theater tickets chronicling William F. Cody's life as the
Indian fighter, buffalo hunter and scout who, along with shooting
champion W. ``Doc'' Carver, founded the first Wild West Show. Cody
died in 1917.
