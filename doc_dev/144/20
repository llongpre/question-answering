<LEADPARA>  As if Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas and Andre Reed weren't enough, the Buffalo
Bills added a new scoring weapon Monday night -- their defense.;   Three
turnovers produced 17 points, including a fumble return for a touchdown by
linebacker Cornelius Bennett, and the Bills beat the Miami Dolphins 41-27.  </LEADPARA>

DEFENSE KEYS WIN OVER MIAMI  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     Miami (5-6) lost to Buffalo (10-1) for the 10th time in 11 games.;   The
Bills mounted scoring drives of 83, 65, 72 and 89 yards. Thomas rushed for 135
yards and a touchdown in 23 carries. Kelly threw three touchdown passes -- two
to Reed and one to Thomas.;   Plenty of points;   The 41 points were the most
by Buffalo against Miami in a regular-season game since 1966. The Bills won
that one 58-24. Buffalo beat the Dolphins 44-34 in the playoffs last January.;
  Buffalo is accustomed to such production from its offense, ranked No. 1 in
the NFL. Big plays by the Bills' defense, ranked 26th, have been much less
frequent.;   The first and biggest turnover came when a blitzing Bennett
knocked the ball from Dan Marino's cocked right hand, fell on the fumble at
the 6-yard line, stood up and dashed into the end zone. That gave Buffalo the
lead for good at 17-10 in the second quarter.;   "It was a huge play," Bills
Coach Marv Levy said. "It really turned the momentum.";   Marino suffered
another costly turnover on the next play when his underthrown pass was
intercepted by Kirby Jackson and returned 12 yards to the Miami 24. Seven
plays later, Scott Norwood kicked a 21-yard field goal.;   Fumble sets up
score;   Miami rookie Aaron Craver fumbled the second-half kickoff, and
Buffalo's Hal Garner recovered at the 27. Kelly then hit Reed with a 5-yard TD
pass.;   The Dolphins finished with five turnovers, Buffalo none. With such
figures, Miami Coach Don Shula said, "there's just no way you're going to win
a game against a team with that kind of talent.";   Kelly and Reed connected
from 23 yards for the Bills' final TD.;   Miami's Sammie Smith scored his
first touchdown of the season. Former Stanford tight end Greg Baty caught a
1-yard pass from Marino for his first TD since 1987.  </TEXT>
