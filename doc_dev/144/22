Three fumbles in the game's first seven minutes Sunday gave Indianapolis Colt 
Coach Ron Meyer a mountainous problem. 
</P>
<P>
"As I said coming in, it looks like a very steep hill," Meyer said in reference 
to Indianapolis' playoff chances after a 30-7 loss to the Buffalo Bills. "It 
looks like Mount Everest right now." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts (4-6) are three games behind the first-place Bills (7-3) in the race 
for the AFC East title and two games behind second-place Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"It is best when you control your own destiny," Colts' offensive tackle Chris 
Hinton said. "But now we have to win the rest of our games and we also need 
some help from other teams if we are going to catch Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
The game's turning point may have come on the opening kickoff, when Mark Pike 
ripped the ball out of Indianapolis returner James Pruitt's hands. Mickey 
Sutton recovered for Buffalo on the Colt 22-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"That fumble was a big emotional lift for us," Sutton said. "Both teams came 
out all psyched up and that play set the tone for the whole game." 
</P>
<P>
Jim Kelly took advantage of the mistake, connecting with Thurman Thomas for the 
first of Kelly's three touchdown passes on the day with only 2:12 gone in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
That fumble was forced by a hard hit. The Colts, especially running back Eric 
Dickerson, had no such excuse on the fumbles that ended their next two 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard Smith recovered Dickerson's first fumble, giving Buffalo the ball at 
midfield, and Scott Norwood kicked a 42-yard field goal to make it 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Dickerson, who didn't talk to 
reporters after the game, fumbled again when the ball bounced off his knee. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills turned that into a 40-yard field goal by Norwood for a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Touchdown passes of 32 and three yards from Kelly to Andre Reed in the second 
quarter made it 27-0 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills rushed for 232 yards in 51 carries. Thomas had 127 yards in 29 
attempts.
