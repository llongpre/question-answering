<LEADPARA>  The talk of the Super Bowl has been not what the Buffalo Bills do, but what
they don't do: go into a huddle.;    Their no-huddle offense, which thoroughly
befuddled the Los Angeles Raiders at the start of the AFC championship game,
figures to be a significant weapon Sunday in Super Bowl XXV.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The Bills won't use it all the time or even most of the time. Their routine
is to strike quickly, keeping the defense off balance, grabbing control of the
game's tempo. That's what they did in a 51-3 rout of the Raiders on Sunday.;  
 That's exactly what they would like to do against the NFC champ New York
Giants. After all, scoring early is becoming a habit. The Bills have scored on
their first possession in nine of their past 12 games. Given that jump start,
they have scored a total of 95 points in two playoff games.;    "Once the
opponent sees us score so quickly on the first drive, which we've been doing a
lot lately, I think it gives our defense a psychological advantage," said
Buffalo running back Thurman Thomas. "Now the other team is thinking that we
came out in a no-huddle and came right down and scored. It's a big morale
boost. People we play start thinking we can go up and down the field all
day.";    It was used against Bills;  The ironic part of the no-huddle offense
is that it was used effectively by the Cincinnati Bengals against the Bills
during the 1988 AFC championship game. Buffalo Coach Marv Levy protested
loudly before the game about the propriety of the no-huddle, where plays are
called at the line of scrimmage and defenses are not afforded time to make
adjustments.;    Cincinnati won the game 21-10 and went to the Super Bowl. Now
Levy has used it to reach the Super Bowl.;    "They've been successful with
it," noted Giants defensive lineman Leonard Marshall. "They make you play a
lot of plays in a hurry. After so long playing that no-huddle, fatigue sets
in.;    "The key is to recognize the formation, remember your keys and make a
play. Once a play is over, you have to forget about it and get ready for the
next one. You don't have time to change up for different situations.";   
Buffalo used the no-huddle offense some during a 17-13 regular-season victory
over the Giants on Dec. 15. New York was able to learn from that game. The
Giants believe they can recognize what the Bills want to do from certain
formations, for instance, when they might run a crossing pattern with wide
receiver Andre Reed.;    Raiders tried a timeout;  There are a few ways to
break the momentum of the no-huddle. One is fake an injury. Another is call a
timeout, as L.A. did less than two minutes into Sunday's game.;    "They
looked like they needed one," said Marshall. "We know if we don't prepare
correctly, Buffalo could put up a basketball score against us, too.";   
Preparation, say the Giants, is only half the battle. Reacting to what they
see on the field is the rest.;    "First you have to make sure you have
everybody lined up," said linebacker Carl Banks. "Second, you have to have
your signals called. Third, you have to have your defensive linemen down. If
they're standing up looking for a call, it's all over.";    The no-huddle
offense has one drawback. It takes practically no time off the clock. The
Bills' first touchdown came in 3 1/2 minutes.;    But that is a small price to
pay for momentum.;    New York Coach Bill Parcells is less worried about the
philosophy than the personnel.;    "It's not what they're doing, it's who's
doing it," Parcells said. "The no-huddle is a nice, vogue thing to write
about. But their offense is Andre Reed and Thurman Thomas and Jim Kelly. Those
are the guys you have to stop. You don't stop the no-huddle.;    "You stop
their wide receivers, and they can't throw. You stop their runners and they
can't run."  </TEXT>
