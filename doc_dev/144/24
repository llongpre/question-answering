<TEXT>     Kelly threw for 303 yards and three touchdowns and the Bills came back from
a sluggish first half to score 35 points in the final 32 minutes to beat the
Chicago Bears 35-20 in a battle of undefeated NFL teams.;   "When the clock is
running down on us, it seems to get us going," center Kent Hull said. "It's an
offense that seems to thrive under pressure and not do so well when there
isn't much.";   There wasn't much pressure at the start for the Bills, who had
scored 87 points in two home wins, then just 41 in two victories on the road.;
  In the first 28 minutes they had the ball for just six minutes, had 38 yards
on offense and were lucky to be trailing 6-0 -- the Bears had two touchdowns
called back by penalties and had to settle for Kevin Butler field goals of 28
and 42 yards.;   In the last 32 minutes, the Bills had the ball for 19 minutes
and rolled up 381 yards.;   It started with 1 minute, 59 seconds left in the
first half and Buffalo on its own 15.;   The Bills were in the end zone 1:47
later, the result of a 33-yard strike from Kelly to Al Edwards. That gave the
Bills a largely undeserved 7-6 lead, setting them off on an offensive
explosion that improved them to 5-0 and dropped Chicago to 4-1;   "We got our
butts beat, that is all you can say about it," Chicago coach Mike Ditka said.
"We had a number of chances in the game and we seemed to self-destruct every
chance we had. I give them all the credit in the world.";   The defending AFC
champion Bills (5-0) have won 12 games in a row, including the playoffs, at
home. Their last loss at Rich Stadium was in November, 1989.;   "They are a
fine football team; they taught us a little lesson," Ditka said. "Hopefully,
when you are in football, you learn from the lessons that are taught to you,
and you carry on from there.";   The Bills drove 91 yards for a touchdown to
open the second half -- Carwell Gardner's fourth-down recovery of his own
fumble from a yard out in the end zone. The drive started with runs of 12, 9
and 19 by Thurman Thomas, who got 90 of his 117 rushing yards after
intermission.;   "We didn't expect them to run like that," Chicago linebacker
Ron Rivera said. "They ended the first half throwing the ball and we thought
that would be their mode of operation coming out.";   Kelly agreed, saying the
key was a misdirection play which set Thomas free for those first three runs.;
  "Thurman opened it up," Kelly said. "We had a couple of running plays we
didn't use in the first half. The misdirection was one of them."; BILLS 35,
BEARS 20;   (box) THE HERO: Buffalo quarterback Jim Kelly threw for 303 yards
and three touchdowns, and the Bills scored 35 points in the final 32 minutes.;
  (box) THE GOAT: Bears quarterback Jim Harbaugh, who completed only 6 of 16
passes in the second half.;   (box) KEY PLAY: Trailing 6-0 after being
completely outplayed for the first 29-plus minutes, the Bills took the lead
for good on a 33-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Al Edwards with 12 seconds
remaining in the first half.  </TEXT>
