<LEADPARA>  The New York Giants have an old-style offense, a new-wave defense and, as of
Sunday evening, another Super Bowl championship.;    Using a combination of
turf-churning runs by Ottis Anderson, the game's most valuable player, and an
innovative defensive scheme featuring five or six defensive backs and two down
linemen, the Giants squeezed past the Buffalo Bills 20-19 to claim their
second Super Bowl title in five seasons.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But before the victory in Super Bowl XXV was locked up, they had to survive
a 47-yard field-goal attempt by the Bills' Scott Norwood, whose chance to be a
hero went wide right with eight seconds to play.;    On their way to victory,
the Giants broke records both very old and very new.;    The old:;    (check)
The one-point victory broke the record for narrowest margin of victory, three
points, set in Super Bowl V.;    The new:;    (check) Their ground-hugging
offense held the ball for 40 minutes, 33 seconds of the 60-minute contest,
breaking the 49ers' possession record (39:31) set in Super Bowl XXIV. And
their third-quarter touchdown drive that lasted 9:29 and ended with a 1-yard
dive by Anderson set the record for longest TD drive. The previous mark, 7:07,
had been set by the Niners, too.;    "Those drives were real important,
because it kept their offense off the field and, just as importantly, it kept
their defense on it," said cornerback Mark Collins. "They're not used to being
on the field for that long. You could see it on those long drives that they
were getting tired.";    "We're not pretty, but we're effective," said
Anderson, who carried 21 times for 102 yards and one TD.;    Any talk before
the game about a fatigue factor involved the Giants' defense. Expectations
were that the Bills' no-huddle offense would run the Giants' 3-4 defense
ragged.;    Maybe it would have. Defensive coordinator Bill Belichick didn't
want to find out, so he switched to a nickel defense and had defensive back
Everson Walls calling defensive audibles to match any from Bills quarterback
Jim Kelly.;    "We wanted to have more speed and better athletes on the
field," Belichick explained. "We thought their big-play guys would be James
Lofton, Andre Reed and Thurman Thomas. . . . Everson did a hell of a job. He
called it better than I could have.";    Despite all that, the Bills, heavily
favored after scoring 95 points in their two playoff games, still could have
pulled it out. An 11-yard run by Thomas had put the ball on the Giants' 29,
where Kelly spiked the ball to stop the clock with eight seconds left and give
the Bills a chance to bring on Norwood.;    "Everything was fine with
placement," Norwood said. "It was a matter of trying to put a little too much
on the kick.";    Giants place-kicker Matt Bahr, who had put his team in the
Super Bowl by making a last-second field goal from 42 yards in the NFC
championship game against the 49ers, sympathized.;    "That's a difficult kick
in any conditions," Bahr said. "It was more nerve wracking to be on the
sidelines. Everything was a blur. I didn't really watch it. When I saw
(cornerback) Roger Brown jumping up and down, I knew it had missed.";   
Giants defensive end Leonard Marshall didn't see it either, because he was
lost in thinking back over the last three months.;    "I thought about
everything," he said. "I thought about beating Detroit 20-0 and only beating
New England 13-10 and having everyone say we weren't going to make it. I
thought about beating Chicago, training camp, all the different snaps.";    He
didn't mention the Giants' 17-13 loss to the Bills in the regular season. But
sloppy tackling, the same problem that plagued the Giants when they lost to
the Bills during the regular season, cost them a 17-12 lead at the start of
the fourth quarter.;    Thomas, on the first play of the quarter, shed
linebacker Gary Reasons and safety Myron Guyton on his way to a 31-yard
touchdown run. Norwood's extra point made it 19-17, Bills.;    But the Giants
came back with another time-consuming drive, using up 7:32 as they went from
their 23 to the Buffalo 3. Bahr kicked a 21-yard field goal that gave them a
20-19 lead with 7:20 left.;    The Bills had several chances to break the game
open in the first half and led 12-3 at one point, but the Giants drove 87
yards near the end of the half for a score on Hostetler's 14-yard pass to
Stephen Baker with 25 seconds left.;    The Giants' win was the seventh
straight for the NFC in the Super Bowl.;  GIANTS' TIME-EATING DRIVES; The New
York Giants' ability to keep the ball out of the hands of the potent Buffalo
Bills' offense and to score on time-consuming drives played a major role in
the outcome of Super Bowl XXV. The scoring drives:;  Plays   Yards Time
Result; 11     58    6:15 Field goal by Bahr; 10     87    3:24 Touchdown pass
to Baker; 14     75    9:29 Anderson touchdown run; 14     74    7:23 Field
goal by Bahr;  Ran in the South County Edition only; ...;  THE VALUE OF TIME; 
One major reason the New York Giants controlled the ball for 21 minutes, 6
seconds more than the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV is that they not only
ran 16 more plays than the Bills, but also averaged slightly more than 13
seconds more per play than Buffalo. That means, on the average, Giants plays
lasted 1.6 times longer than Bills plays. Here's a look at the numbers:; ...; 
BUFFALO BILLS; Time of      No. of   Seconds;       possession   plays    per
play;         19:27       55      21.22; ...;  NEW YORK GIANTS; Time of   No.
