Warren Moon and Jim Kelly played to a virtual standoff, but the Houston Oilers 
surprisingly had the edge when it came to Lorenzo White and Thurman Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
White had his career-best game for rushing and receiving yardage Monday night, 
leading the Oilers past the Buffalo Bills, 27-24, and completing a week in 
which all six NFL division leaders lost. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line was ferocious and unrelenting," White said. "It takes a 
while for the line in this system to get used to the run. Once I get the hole I 
can create things. It was just like it's drawn up on the board." 
</P>
<P>
Houston (6-5) created a three-way tie with Cincinnati and Pittsburgh for the 
AFC Central lead, while the Bills (9-2), whose eight-game losing streak was 
ended, dropped into a tie for the AFC East lead with Miami. 
</P>
<P>
White rushed 18 times for 125 yards and caught five passes for 89 yards. His 
previous best rushing total was 113 and his best receiving was 82, both last 
season. Thomas was held to 54 yards in 15 carries and caught four passes for 32 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"They were in pass defense most of the night," Pardee said. "They had six guys 
back and five up front. You have to be able to count. We got White going." 
</P>
<P>
White, who has taken heat for his fumbles and lack of production this season, 
"was wired tight," Pardee said. 
</P>
<P>
Moon's 28-yard pass to White positioned the Oilers for a three-yard scoring 
pass to Leonard Harris, giving Houston a 27-17 lead with 7:21 left. 
</P>
<P>
"White was fantastic," Moon said. "He knew he was going to be called upon the 
way they were dropping people back." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas scored on a two-yard run with 3:29 left to trim Houston's lead, but the 
Oilers ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Moon completed 16 of 22 passes for 300 yards and two touchdowns; Kelly was 23 
of 34 for 224 yards and two scores. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would be a matter of who had the ball last," Kelly said. "We had 
confidence we could score again. But give them credit." 
</P>
<P>
Moon's 43-yard pass to Drew Hill set up White's one-yard run with 3:14 left in 
the third quarter to give the Oilers a 20-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills weren't overly complimentary of White. 
</P>
<P>
"When we're split out like we were, a baby could run through the holes," 
cornerback Nate Odomes said. "I don't mean to take anything away from Lorenzo. 
My hat is off to him." 
</P>
<P>
Kelly gave the Bills a 14-13 lead by hitting Keith McKeller with an 11-yard 
scoring pass 40 seconds before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Norwood's 43-yard field goal made it 17-13 on Buffalo's first possession 
of the third quarter.
