   Buffalo Bill's buffalo-hide coat, eight
guns and a tomahawk go on the auction block today in the largest
sale yet of Wild West memorabilia collected by the legendary
William F. Cody.
   The 300 items offered for sale belong to San Franciscan Greg
Martin, who acquired the collection after he had been unable to buy
the single item he wanted.
   It was a double-barrel shotgun that brought Martin to a
warehouse in Billings, Mont., last year.
   ``I saw it up in storage ... and my pulse skipped a beat,'' said
Martin, who offered to buy the Westley-Richards English shotgun
inscribed to Cody.
   When the elderly owner refused to sell just one item, Martin
wrote a check for $300,000 for the entire collection and took it
out of storage for the first time in 20 years.
   ``He is the living symbol of the West and one of the most famous
Americans who ever lived,'' said Martin, 49, a gun collector and
aficionado of American history. ``The way we look at the West is
because of how Buffalo Bill showed it to us.''
   The collection, to be auctioned by Butterfield &amp; Butterfield,
includes the buffalo-hide coat worn by Cody and the gun he carried
as a 14-year-old Pony Express rider. Cody's single-action Colt
revolver, the type he used as a U.S. Army scout, is one of eight
guns in the collection.
   Items such as a tomahawk from Cody's friend D.F. ``White
Beaver'' Powell, along with dozens of photographs, show bills and
theater tickets chronicle Cody's life as an Indian fighter, buffalo
hunter and scout who along with shooting champion W. ``Doc'' Carver
founded the first Wild West Show.
   For 11 years, after dime-novel writer Ned Buntline persuaded
Cody to appear in the first ``Scouts of the Prairie'' show, Cody
traveled between Eastern theaters and the plains.
   The collection consists of items preserved by Cody's adoring
sister, Julia Cody Goodman, and includes the Cody family Bible and
letters to Julia in which Cody discussed a troubled marriage, the
death of his son and other intimate events.
   The engraved shotgun, the only item not up for auction, will
remain in Martin's home, a three-story Victorian crammed with
Western artifacts including a likeness of Chief Sitting Bull and
the pearl-handled Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers owned by Annie Oakley.
   Martin, a former real estate broker, once paid $1 million for
Bill Harrah's Pony Express Museum in Reno, and maintains his
collection with the help of his wife, Petra, a former federal judge
in Germany.
   He flew to Billings in search of the collection when he learned
Julia Cody Goodman's daughter, Josie, sold it for $1 to a woman
named Stella Foote to keep it from going to the Cody Museum in
Cody, Wyo., Martin said.
   The collection traveled the world under the sponsorship of the
Department of Commerce before it was placed in storage by Foote.
