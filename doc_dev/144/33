<P>
Thurman Thomas rushed for 148 yards in 27 carries and Larry Kinnebrew had 121 
in 21 tries and each scored a touchdown as the Buffalo Bills emphasized the run 
and the pass rush in a 31-17 victory over the Miami Dolphins Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills have won three in a row and five of their last six and lead the 
American Conference East with a 6-2 record. 
</P>
<P>
The game was played before 80,208 fans -- the largest crowd ever at Rich 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
Buffalo twice sacked Dan Marino, who had gone 19 games without being sacked, 
and gained 280 against the Dolphins. Thomas and Kinnebrew accounted for all but 
11 of those yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills ran on 51 of their 60 plays. 
</P>
<P>
With Frank Reich at quarterback, Buffalo has won all three games since Jim 
Kelly separated a shoulder in a 37-14 loss to the Indianapolis Colts on Oct. 8. 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Wright snapped Marino's streak of 759 pass attempts without a sack in the 
second quarter, and Cornelius Bennett had another sack in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Marino also threw three interceptions, with Kirby Jackson returning his second 
of the game 40 yards for a touchdown with three minutes to play. Scott Secules 
then replaced Marino, who had 20 completions in 36 attempts for 255 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins (4-4) managed only 65 yards rushing in losing for the first time 
in four games. 
</P>
<P>
A 21-point second quarter by the Bills blew the game open and gave them a 21-3 
lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Kinnebrew opened the explosion two seconds into the quarter with a one-yard 
touchdown run. All 15 plays on the 76-yard drive were rushes. 
</P>
<P>
A Bennett interception at the Miami 42-yard line set up the score that put 
Buffalo ahead, 14-3. Bruce Smith, who stopped Dolphins running back Sammie 
Smith several times for losses in the first half, hurried Marino into throwing 
the interception. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas finished the four-play drive with a 30-yard scoring run. The play began 
as a sweep to the right and Thomas dodged four would-be tacklers before cutting 
to the left and into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
The final touchdown of the quarter came on a 63-yard pass from Reich to rookie 
Don Beebe. 
</P>
<P>
Miami's two touchdowns came on two 44-yard passes, one from Marino to Mark 
Clayton and the other from Secules to Andre Brown.
