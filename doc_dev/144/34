<TEXT>  Line: Buffalo is favored by 7 1/2 points.; Television: ch. 4, 8; Records:
Buffalo is 8-1 and leads the AFC East by three games. The Packers are 2-7,
fourth in the NFC Central.; Series: The Bills have won three of four
meetings.; Bills update: Jim Kelly, the NFL's top-rated quarterback, directs
the league's top-ranked offense. Thurman Thomas leads the NFL with 862 rushing
yards. WR Andre Reed is second in the NFL with 47 catches for an AFC-leading
719 yards. But the Bills' defense is ranked No. 26 overall.; Packers update:
Green Bay's only victories in its past 15 games have come against the Tampa
Bay Buccaneers, whom it beat three times. The Packers are expected to play
without injured QB Don Majkowski.; Key injuries: Bills -- none reported.
Packers -- C James Campen (calf), G-T Billy Ard (shoulder) are out; Majkowski
(hamstring) is questionable; T Ken Ruettgers (hamstring), WR Charles Wilson
(back), RB-KR Vai Sikahema (shoulder) are probable.; L.A. RAIDERS VS. DENVER
BRONCOS; Kickoff: 1 p.m., Mile High Stadium; Line: Denver is favored by 3
points.; Television: ch. 4, 8; Records: The Broncos lead the AFC West with a
7-2 record. The Raiders are 5-4, tied for third in the AFC West.; Series: The
Raiders have dominated 42-19-2 and have won the last four.; Raiders update: In
Week 2, the Raiders controlled the ball more than 35 minutes and outrushed the
Broncos 133-33 in a 16-13 victory. But L.A. will be without RB Nick Bell, who
sustained broken ribs last week and was placed on injured reserve. The
Raiders, who have not featured a 100-yard rusher in any game this season, hope
that Marcus Allen's return from injury is the answer.; Broncos update: Denver,
which has won six of its past seven games, has relied strongly on its running
game. Rookie Greg Lewis, replacing injured Gaston Green, rushed for 111 yards
last week. Green is expected back today. QB John Elway has relinquished some
of his play-calling duties to Coach Dan Reeves. Denver has allowed only one TD
in its past two games.; Key injuries: Raiders -- G Max Montoya (groin) is
probable. Broncos -- Green (thigh), DE Ron Holmes (shoulder-knee), S Randy
Robbins (hamstring), LB Keith Traylor (shoulder) are probable.; NEW ENGLAND

is favored by 6 1/2 points.; Television: ESPN; Records: The Patriots are 3-6,
fourth in the AFC East. The Dolphins are 4-5, third in the AFC East.; Series:
The Dolphins lead the series 29-20, including a 20-10 win this season.;
Patriots update: The Pats have tightened their rush defense under defensive
coordinator Joe Collier, allowing only two touchdowns compared with 20 last
season.; Dolphins update: Dan Marino's passing statistics are down this
season, but that might change against the Patriots, who rank next to last in
the league in passing defense. Marino will make his 118th consecutive start as
Miami tries to defeat the Patriots for the sixth consecutive game.; Key
injuries: Patriots -- K Jason Staurovsky (quadriceps), WR Rob Carpenter
(hamstring) are out; LB Chris Singleton (ankle) is doubtful; S Fred Marion
(stomach), RB Ivy Joe Hunter (knee), RB Marvin Allen (hand), LB Richard
Tardits (back), RB Leonard Russell (back-ankle) are questionable; RB Marvin

is questionable; S Bobby Harden (knee), S Louis Oliver (ankle) are probable.  </TEXT>
