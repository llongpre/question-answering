   Chief Frank Fools Crow, a widely respected
Sioux Indian spiritual leader who traveled with the Buffalo Bill
Cody Wild West Show as a young man, died Monday at the home of his
grandchildren.
   Fools Crow was born just south of the Porcupine district of the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. His exact age was not known, but he
was believed to be 99.
   In an interview earlier this year, Fools Crow said he quit
school in the third grade to work to help his family earn a living.
As he grew to manhood, he said, he traveled throughout the nation
with the Cody wild west show.
   The chief said he followed ``vision quests'' that directed him
into a life of healing and tribal leadership. He saw alcoholism and
jealousy as the greatest curses for Indian people.
   In an interview with The Rapid City Journal in February, Fools
Crow said he realized the world was changing, but modern problems
must be dealt with through cooperation and without losing sight of
the old ways.
   ``We need peace and understanding and unity of all young men,
young women and elders _ both Indian and non-Indian alike,'' Fools
Crow said. ``We must all stand together and work together for the
reason of peace and tranquility of life for all.''
   Fools Crow, a medicine man and spiritual grandfather, had lived
with grandchildren in a trailer home near Kyle after the death of
his second wife, Kate, in October 1988. His first wife, Fannie
Afraid of Hawk, died in 1954. Services are pending with the
Osheim-Catron Funeral Home in Rapid City.
   Fools Crow said respect, generosity, courage, knowledge and
wisdom were keys to the survival of the Lakota culture.
   ``These values start from the home. They are taught there and
expressed there and carried into the world,'' he said. ``You must
first better understand yourself before you can express yourself to
others. The Lakota values help you do this.''
   Thomas E. Mails, an artist and ethnologist who has produced four
major studies on North American Indians, wrote the holy man's
biography, titled ``Fools Crow.''
