<LEADPARA>  The Buffalo Bills won the only meeting with the New York Giants this season,
17-13 in East Rutherford, N.J., but a lot has changed since then.;    Buffalo
wasn't sure whether Jim Kelly would play again this season, and the Giants,
too, were uncertain at quarterback. Moreover, they were amid their worst slump
of the season.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Well, Kelly, who suffered a knee injury in that Dec. 15 game, returned for
the playoffs and has led the Bills to 95 points in two games.;    And the
Giants now seem to believe in Jeff Hostetler, who replaced Phil Simms after
the starting quarterback suffered a season-ending arch injury against Buffalo.
What's more, the Giants are back on a roll, having stuffed the Bears and
Niners offenses on the way to a Super Bowl berth.;    But on Dec. 15, the
Giants were the ones who were stuffed. Specifically running back Ottis
Anderson.;    He was stopped for a loss on third-and-one at the Bills' 3 in
the third quarter, and the Giants settled for a field goal to close to within
14-13. They never scored again.;    They certainly had a shot to put more
points on the board, though.;    Linebacker Lawrence Taylor dropped two
potential interceptions. On one of them, he could have scored a touchdown.;   
"I had the opportunities to make the difference," Taylor said after the game,
"I just couldn't make the plays. There's no way we should have lost this game,
especially after Kelly went down.";    Buffalo took control of the game early
and really never let go, although obviously there were some scary moments for
the Bills.;    Buffalo scored on its first two possessions. Andre Reed caught
a 6-yard TD pass to tie the game at 7 with 6 minutes, 30 seconds left in the
first quarter, and Thurman Thomas ran in from 2 yards with 14:09 left in the
first half to give the Bills a 14-7 lead.;    After two field goals by New
York's Matt Bahr, the Bills then pulled out to the 17-13 lead on Scott
Norwood's 29-yard field goal with 14:56 to go in the game.;  Buffalo
