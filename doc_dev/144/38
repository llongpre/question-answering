<TEXT>     It's easy to overlook Thomas despite numbers that make him the most
prolific running back/receiver in the NFL over the past two seasons.;   
Thomas, a third-year player from Oklahoma State, rushed for a game-high 135
yards in 15 carries, including a 31-yard score. He added five catches for 55
yards, epitomizing his versatility.;    His season with the Buffalo Bills had
been punctuated with a touch of spiteful rage at the many people within the
media and the NFL he perceives have never afforded him the proper accolades.; 
  That chance was within his grasp Sunday at Tampa Stadium, when Thomas moved
the Bills into scoring position for Scott Norwood's 47-yard field-goal
attempt.;    His run of 21 yards to the Bills' 40-yard line, followed shortly
by a 10-yard gain before the field-goal attempt, probably would have
positioned Thomas on a podium before a collection of microphones and cameras
capturing the emotions of the Super Bowl's most valuable player.;    But when
Norwood's kick sailed wide right in the final seconds, so did Thomas' chances
of national prominence. Thomas received only one MVP vote.;    "We didn't win
the ballgame, so you have to say that somebody on their team deserves to be
the most valuable player," Thomas said, congratulating Giants running back
Ottis Anderson. "If we would have won, maybe it would have been different.";  
 The Giants did everything possible to take Thomas out of the Bills' no-huddle
offense, assigning a "spy" to shadow Thomas constantly. Those responsibilities
belonged to Lawrence Taylor and Leonard Marshall. "I figured that by late in
the game they would forget about me," Thomas said.;    Hardly.;    Despite
Thomas' complaints, the Giants knew that one of their defensive priorities was
to stop Thomas.;    The Bills wavered on Thomas only slightly before selecting
him during the 1988 draft. Their concerns centered on a two-year-old knee
injury and subsequent surgery.;    The Bills picked Thomas, who rushed for 881
yards his rookie season, with the 39th selection in the draft. In subsequent
seasons, Thomas has rushed for 1,244 yards and 1,297 yards, including 11
rushing touchdowns this season.;    "I wanted to go out and show a lot of
media guys I was underrated and I didn't get the credit that I thought I
deserved," Thomas said. "Nobody around the league, or in other cities, thinks
I'm a good football player.;    "Hopefully, in a few months, I will be rated
higher.";    And, Thomas hopes, the opportunity of Super Bowl fame will come
once again.; THOMAS VS. ANDERSON; New York's Ottis Anderson won the
most-valuable-player award,; but Buffalo's Thurman Thomas won the battle of
running backs.; Here's how they compared Sunday:; Player        No.  Yds  Avg
