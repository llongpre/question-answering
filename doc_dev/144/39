<LEADPARA>  As quickly as you could say "no-huddle offense," it was no contest.;    The
Buffalo Bills showed no weakness and left no doubt in their 51-3 victory
Sunday over the Los Angeles Raiders that the AFC is a genuine possibility to
win its first Super Bowl since 1984, when the Raiders beat the Washington
Redskins.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     By winning a trip to Tampa, the Bills cut the number of teams yet to go to
the championship game to nine. Buffalo lost the 1989 AFC championship game to
the Cincinnati Bengals 21-10. The Bills' only previous Super Bowl chance was
in 1967 when, as the two-time defending American Football League champions,
they lost 31-7 to the Kansas City Chiefs for a berth in the first Super Bowl.;
   The Raiders, who had the stingiest scoring defense in the league this
season, weren't up to stopping the Bills' relentless no-huddle offense that
scored an AFC championship game-record seven TDs, six in the first half.;   
It was Thurman Thomas up the middle, quarterback Jim Kelly to Thomas, Kelly to
wide receiver Andre Reed, Thomas up the middle and Kelly to Thomas again
before the flustered Raiders called a timeout and the Bills huddled for the
first time in the game.;    "I don't know how they did it," said Raiders
linebacker Jerry Robinson. "It was like clockwork -- everything they did --
just like clockwork.";    By then, in little more time than it takes to read
about it, the Bills were just 20 yards and five plays from a 7-0 lead and, in
effect, victory.;    Though the Raiders drove to a 41-yard field goal by Jeff
Jaeger on their first possession, the Bills scored again, in just four plays,
on their second possession to make it 14-3. After Darryl Talley intercepted a
pass by Jay Schroeder and returned it for a third touchdown, it was 21-3 with
3 minutes, 9 seconds to go in the first quarter.;    "The only thing that's a
problem with the no-huddle," Thomas said, "is that we score so quick there's a
lot of minutes left on the clock. We've decided that if we're going to score
quick, we might as well score touchdowns rather than field goals.";    The
no-huddle offense, considered a novelty when Bengals Coach Sam Wyche
introduced it in 1988, may be the NFL's fad of the future. The Bills, the
NFL's top scoring team, have scored 95 points in their two playoff games this
season, mostly without huddling.;    "I won't say it's not stoppable," said
Bills center Kent Hull, "but if we don't stop ourselves, this is as good an
offense as there is in the league.";    Yet even Hull says it's Kelly, not the
lack of huddling, that makes the offense go.;    "He sees those substitutes
come in and immediately goes to where the advantage is to our side," Hull
said.;    On the Bills' first possession, Los Angeles found itself in a
standard four-back defense and couldn't substitute a fifth back until the
timeout. By the Bills' third offensive series, the Raiders were up to six
defensive backs and Kelly was going more to Thomas, who rushed for 109
first-half yards and finished the day with 138 in 25 carries, leaving for good
in the third quarter.;    "Hey, if you're going to bring in all those DBs,
we're going to run the football," Kelly said.;    The Bills also unveiled a
new wrinkle they had been tempted to try last week against the Miami Dolphins,
whom they beat 44-34.;    Thomas, whose combined 1,829 yards rushing and
receiving during the regular season were the most of any NFL running back,
occasionally was moved outside as a fifth wide receiver, leaving Kelly alone
in shotgun formation. It helped Thomas make five receptions for 61 yards.;   
But there was little the Bills weren't successful with on offense until the
second half, when they went back to the old-fashioned huddle and conservative
play calling, and still scored 10 points.; LA Raiders  3 00 0--3; Buffalo
