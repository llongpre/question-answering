<TEXT>     There's the Buffalo Bill Village, a re-created Western town with authentic
buildings.;    Outside town is the big Buffalo Bill Reservoir. Then there is
the Bill Cody Ranch Resort, a hunting/fishing/riding lodge owned by Buffalo
Bill's 78-year-old grandson, also named Bill Cody.;    A few miles up the
road, not far from the entrance to Yellowstone National Park, is the Pahaska
Tepee Resort, which was built by Buffalo Bill.;    And of course there is the
Buffalo Bill Historical Center. A visit to this museum, whether you are a
Western buff or not, is worth the trip to Cody.;    The big, modern museum is
broken into four sections -- Buffalo Bill memorabilia, Western art, Plains
Indians and firearms. The museum is closed for the winter, but the group I was
with was lucky enough to get a two-hour tour of all but the firearms
collection, which was being moved to a newly-built wing.;    It was not nearly
enough time. I could have spent a day in the art section alone. It features
Frederic Remington and Charles M. Russell but has a massive collection of
other Western art.;    Officially called the Whitney Gallery of Western Art,
it was created through a grant by Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. The gallery
was renovated and rededicated in 1987.;    The Plains Indian Museum offers one
of the nation's finest collections of Indian artifacts, and the Buffalo Bill
Museum is made up of memorabilia from Cody's career as a Pony Express rider,
frontiersman, scout, buffalo hunter and creator of the Wild West show the
toured the world.;    The Cody Firearms Museum, which will re-open this summer
in a new wing of the museum, displays the world's largest collection of
American-made guns.;    An interesting point made by our guide during the tour
of the Plains Indian section of the museum is that inside the museum are a
number of "medicine bundles," which are collections of items sacred to a
tribe.;    These bundles are kept in a special room with access denied to all
but specific Indians who, as representatives of their tribe, have a right to
see them. Even the curators of the museum cannot enter the room unless taken
in by a tribal representative.;    Another place worth visiting is the Irma, a
hotel Buffalo Bill built for his youngest daughter, Irma, in 1902. Many of the
rooms in the hotel are being lovingly restored by the current owners.;    The
best rooms need to be booked well in advance, but an alternative is to dine in
the big room that used to be the hotel's bar room. The centerpiece is a bar
presented to Buffalo Bill by England's Queen Victoria in appreciation for a
command performance.;  IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For more information on Cody, or
reservations at any of the area hotels or resorts, call the Cody Chamber of
Commerce, (307) 587-2297.  </TEXT>
