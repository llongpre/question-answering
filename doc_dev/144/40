   Actor Bruce Boxleitner, who co-starred
in the television series ``Scarecrow and Mrs. King,'' will receive
the Buffalo Bill Award at the 1988 Nebraskaland Days, officials
said.
   Plans for the June 18-26 celebration were outlined Saturday
night at the annual Buffalo Bill Birthday Dance, one of
Nebraskaland Days' biggest fund-raisers.
   Nebraskaland Days President Kim Baxter said Boxleitner has
western connections through television movies and his interest in
quarter horses.
   ``To be honest, they're not making as many westerns as they used
to,'' Baxter said. ``It lessens the field when you limit it to
people in westerns. We've gone to choosing a person who represents
good family entertainment. But it's good when you can get someone
who has been in westerns.''
   Boxleitner appeared as James Arness' nephew in ``The Macahans,''
which inspired the ``How the West Was Won'' series. He was Kenny
Rogers' co-star in three ``Gambler'' television movies.
   Boxleitner lives in the San Fernando Valley, north of Los
Angeles.
   The annual celebration features rodeo performances, a parade and
many other events with a western theme. Gov. Kay Orr has designated
Nebraskaland Days as one of the key events in her ``Celebrate
Nebraska '88'' tourism promotion.
