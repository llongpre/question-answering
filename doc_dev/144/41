   Pop singer George Michael will undergo
surgery next week to remove a cyst from his vocal cords, forcing
him to cancel the rest of his scheduled performances in Europe, a
spokesman says.
   The operation will be performed Wednesday at an undisclosed
London hospital, publicist Phil Lobel said Friday.
   ``It will be four weeks before Michael can sing again,'' Lobel
said.
   Exploratory surgery this week found the cyst, he said.
   ``While I am very sad that I will have to disappoint my fans,''
Michael, 25, said in a statement, ``I am at least relieved that at
long last the real reason for my problems has been discovered.''
   Throat problems forced Michael to drop 20 shows in Australia at
the beginning of his tour in March, and he had feared he would lose
his voice.
   The remainder of Michael's European tour was cancelled, but the
North American leg of his world ``Faith Tour'' will proceed as
planned beginning Aug. 6 at the Capitol Center in Washington, D.C.

   President Reagan reminisced about his acting
days in a telegram to this central Missouri town, saying a scene in
the movie ``Kings Row'' was the finest he ever did.
   The 1941 movie was based on a book of the same name about
growing up in Fulton, which is holding its Kingdom Days celebration
this weekend.
   In the scene, Reagan, waking up after a leg has been amputated,
screams, ``Where's the rest of me?''
   ``We did this scene without rehearsal and you know or will soon
see the results,'' he said in the telegram Friday. ``I don't
believe I ever did quite as well again in a single shot.''
   The movie is to be screened during Kingdom Days, held to
celebrate the Civil War heritage of Callaway County. Robert
Cummings, who starred with Reagan in the movie, is scheduled to
appear and clothes worn in the movie will be displayed.

   When entertainer Roy Clark takes his
down-home brand of music to the Soviet Union this fall, he'll be
broadening his guitar-picking repertoire to include Russian
folksongs.
   ``It will be a country version of a balalaika orchestra,'' Clark
told a news conference Thursday.
   Clark plans 12 November performances as part of ``The Friendship
Tour,'' a venture partly underwritten by the U.S. Information
Agency and the Soviet concert agency Gosconcert.
   To raise additional funds, $2 postcards are being sold through a
nationwide radio network.
   Clark said he plans to present the giant collection of postcards
to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev as a goodwill gesture.
   ``There was no other way to say `I represent the American
people' unless they were involved,'' the musician said.

   ``Dirty Dancing'' star Patrick Swayze says his
next dance film will be his last, and will co-star his wife, Lisa
Niemi.
   ``I've had so much knee surgery; I think I have only one major
dance film left in me. Lisa and I will do it together,'' Swayze
said in an interview published in Vogue magazine's July issue.
   Swayze says he and his wife are more than just a marriage.
``When I move with Lisa, something electric happens,'' he said.
   They have been married 11 years, and met at his mother's dancing
school in Houston.
   ``Lisa and I are in this together. She's as much the reason for
my success as `Dirty Dancing.' This is a partnership. I just got
noticed first,'' he said.

   Bruce Boxleitner, who says he'd pay to
act in westerns, was named the annual Buffalo Bill Award winner for
his commitment to family entertainment.
   Friday's award was part of the Nebraskaland Days celebration
here. It is named for Buffalo Bill Cody, the world's first rodeo
producer who took his Wild West Show from North Platte on tours
around the world.
   Previous recipients include western novelist Louis L'Amour and
actors Gene Autrey and Henry Fonda.
   Working in westerns is challenging, said Boxleitner, 38, who
starred in the TV series ``Scarecrow and Mrs. King'' and in two
``Gambler'' movies with Kenny Rogers.
   ``It's not Shakespeare, but you have to learn the tools of the
trade,'' he said. ``I don't think a pay check enters into it. I'd
pay them.''

   Actor Walter Matthau's wife, Carol, says she is
writing a book about Hollywood called ``The Wrong Color Green.''
   ``All the cliches about this never-never land are true, yet
nobody has written successfully about it,'' she said in the
July-August issue of Lear's magazine. ``There is no `they' who
destroy you here. ... You are your own villain.''
   Mrs. Matthau, an actress who was twice married to playwright
William Saroyan before her 28-year union with the actor, says she
never told her husband when she finally decided to make her dream
of being a writer come true.
   ``I never said a word about it to him. (I) just started
writing,'' she said.
