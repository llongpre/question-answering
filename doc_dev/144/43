<LEADPARA>  BUFFALO, N.Y. It's a dateline. It's a football game. No, it's SuperBowl, and
that means I have to make a prediction.;    I hate making predictions. But I
like the Giants.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     I like the Giants to win Super Bowl XXV over the Buffalo Bills. Take the
points -- the Giants are getting seven -- but you won't need them, and neither
will the Giants. They'll win outright.;    The perspective on this matchup has
been severely skewed by Buffalo's 51-3 rout of the Los Angeles Raiders last
Sunday. Oh, it was impressive. So was the Bills' 44-34 beating of Miami a week
earlier. In two playoff games, the Bills have 95 points and nearly 1,000 yards
in offense.;    But today, the Bills aren't playing in Buffalo. They aren't
playing a warm-weather team in a cold, windy stadium. They are playing against
a defense the likes of which they have not seen, except for once. On Dec. 15,
the Bills played the Giants and beat them 17-13.;    "THAT was our worst
game," Giants safety Dave Duerson said last week. It was a statement, not an
excuse.;    "We stunk," said Coach Bill Parcells.;    Parcells said the Giants
stunk in two areas, specifically: short-yardage offense, and tackling. Indeed,
videotape shows 11 missed tackles by the Giants, resulting in 153 additional
yards for the Bills.;    It would be dangerous to put too much emphasis on
that Dec. 15 game. A lot has changed in six weeks. Buffalo quarterback Jim
Kelly, injured in that game, has returned. New York quarterback Phil Simms,
also injured that day, has not. But Jeff Hostetler has shown heart and
ability, and whatever the Giants lose by not having Simms -- if they lose
anything at all -- is offset by two more differences from the Dec. 15
meeting:;    First, this game will be played on grass, where the Bills are 2-5
the last two seasons.;    Second, this is the Super Bowl, where no Bills
player has ever been. Granted, the hype has been extraordinarily small. Cut in
half by the schedule and reduced further by events in the Persian Gulf, this
might be the least-hyped Super Bowl in the last 20 years.;    But when the
players step on the field today, they'll know where they are and they'll feel
the height of the stakes. The Giants have been here before -- 25 of them,
including Parcells.;    To many of the "experts" at the Super Bowl, Parcells
is the Giants' only chance. I don't know. Ever since that night at Candlestick
Park, when Parcells went for broke on fourth-and-goal from the 9, I've
wondered about the genius tag he wears.;    But Marv Levy is in a panic, they
say. He's tight. As evidence, they cite his decision to change hotels in
Tampa. Heck, that wasn't panic; that was a great move. You don't come to the
Super Bowl to stay at a Holiday Inn.;    Levy has done a tremendous job. The
Bickering Bills are now the Super Bowl Bills. They've got the no-huddle
offense. They've got the league's most-balanced offense. They've got Thurman
Thomas, a great running back. They've got Kelly, a fine quarterback.;    But,
in football, good hitting beats good pitching.;    The Giants' defense is No.
1 in fewest points allowed, No. 2 in yards allowed, No. 4 against the run and
No. 6 against the pass. Only one back has rushed for more than 100 yards
against the Giants, and it wasn't Thurman Thomas. (Phoenix rookie Johnny
Johnson ran for 108; Thomas had 60 yards -- in 21 carries -- in the Dec. 15
game.);    The Giants are tough, and they're smart. They've got a plan to
counteract the no-huddle offense. They've also got Lawrence Taylor. He can
still dominate a game, and you might see that today. He sees this as possibly
his last Super Bowl. He is a man possessed.;    And, of course, the Bills
can't score if they don't have the ball. Against the 49ers last Sunday, the
New York offense controlled the ball for almost 40 minutes. It was a 40-20
split the week before against Chicago, too.;    There's no reason to think the
Giants can't do that against the Bills. They already have, in fact; the Giants
controlled the ball for 37 minutes, 59 seconds of that Dec. 15 game. The Bills
rank 15th against the run.;    If this game comes down to a field goal, who do
you like: Matt Bahr or Scott Norwood? If it's a punting contest, you've got to
like the Giants' Sean Landeta.;    See, you can find a dozen reasons to like
the Giants. But you need only one, really, and it's the one I woke up with
Monday morning: These guys stopped Joe Montana twice. That's enough for me.  </TEXT>
