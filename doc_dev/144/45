<HEAD>Museum Visitor Points Out Error In Remington Work</HEAD>

   The bronze cowboy sculpture ``The Rattlesnake''
by famed Western artist Frederic Remington stopped museum visitor
Cy Baumgartner in his tracks _ the cowboy's tiny spurs were on
upside down.
   ``There's no way a cowboy would wear his spurs pointing up like
that,'' said Baumgartner, a former rodeo cowboy who now drives a
beer truck and raises quarter horses. ``It would be totally out of
character.''
   Baumgartner, who was touring the Remington exhibit Sunday at the
St. Louis Art Museum, apparently was the first to notice the error.
   ``I saw it immediately,'' he said. ``I just think it's funny
that nobody noticed it before now.''
   After Baumgartner pointed out the problem, museum workers
checked other bronzes on display.
   They found that all the spurs on the four horsemen in a casting
of ``Coming Through The Rye'' were also upside down.
   Peter H. Hassrick, one of the curators of the exhibit, said he
has occasionally noticed similar problems with Remington works in
private collections. He said he hadn't noticed the problem in the
St. Louis exhibit.
   But that doesn't necessarily mean that Remington, the famed
sculptor and painter of Western themes who lived from 1861 to 1909,
made the error.
   The spurs on the bronzes and other small pieces were cast
separately from the main work and, as a result, it was sometimes
left to a foundry worker with little knowledge of a cowboy's gear
to attach the spurs to the boots.
   On other occasions, Hassrick said, the spurs may have been
damaged and replacement spurs attached turned the wrong way.
   ``It's just a silly little thing, but I'm sure Remington wold
have liked to have seen them the right way,'' Hassrick said.
   ``If they were on one of our bronzes, we'd turn them around,''
said Hassrick, director of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in
Cody, Wyo., and an authority on Remington.
   Neither of the works in question, however, is owned by the
museum. ``The Rattlesnake'' casting is from a private collection,
and the casting of ``Coming Through the Rye'' is on loan from
Princeton University.
   The exhibit is open in St. Louis through May 22.
