</DATELINE>

<P>
His journey has been a long and circuitous one through seven cities and three 
football leagues. 
</P>
<P>
But 29-year-old John Fourcade -- formerly of the Memphis Showboats, Toronto 
Argonauts and Denver Dynamite -- finally made it to the big time Sunday and 
responded with a big-time performance. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around in every league known to man except the European leagues," 
said Fourcade, who led New Orleans to a 22-19 victory over the Buffalo Bills. 
"I was just happy to be out there playing today." 
</P>
<P>
Fourcade, whose only other starts came as the Saints' replacement quarterback 
during the 1987 strike, threw two touchdown passes, and Dalton Hilliard rushed 
for 97 yards and caught a 54-yard touchdown pass. Fourcade started in place of 
Bobby Hebert, whom Fourcade replaced last week. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the victory, Philadelphia's 20-10 win over Dallas ended the Saints' 
slim playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a good football team," New Orleans linebacker Pat Swilling said. "We 
just won't be going to the playoffs to show it." 
</P>
<P>
The loss was Buffalo's second in a row and third in four games. The Bills (8-6) 
are repeating their swoon of last season, when they lost three of their final 
four regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a horror show," said Bills nose tackle Fred Smerlas. "We've got to 
go out and redeem ourselves if we're going to make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints (7-7), who gained 436 total yards, took advantage of Buffalo 
turnovers on each of their first two possessions to build a 13-0 lead in the 
first quarter, and take a 16-12 lead after a snowy first half. 
</P>
<P>
The snow disappeared in the second half, but the Saints' defense continued to 
handle the Bills, getting a timely interception midway in the fourth quarter 
that New Orleans eventually turned into the winning field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Toi Cook, beat in the second quarter for a 42-yard touchdown pass caught by 
James Lofton, picked off a tipped ball near the Saints' end zone as Buffalo was 
driving for a go-ahead score. 
</P>
<P>
"The way (Bills' kicker Scott) Norwood was kicking, that would've been a chip 
shot for him," Cook said. "Somebody (Thurman Thomas) tipped the ball and it 
just ended up in my hands." 
</P>
<P>
With Fourcade and Hilliard leading the way, the Saints drove 81 yards to the 
Buffalo four, setting up a 22-yard field goal by Morten Andersen. Brett Maxie 
clinched the victory with New Orleans' third interception of Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very proud of them after what has happened the last couple of weeks," said 
New Orleans Coach Jim Mora, whose team lost their previous two games by a total 
of 10 points. "You have to play pretty good to beat these guys."
