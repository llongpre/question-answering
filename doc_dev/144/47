<LEADPARA>  The Buffalo Bills reached the silver anniversary Super Bowl with a 15-3
record, with the NFL's top-rated passer, with its total-yardage leader and
without a huddle.;    In this case, what the Bills don't have is almost as
important as what they do, because it was the adoption of the wide-open
no-huddle offense that brought them to within one victory of a championship
for which they've never played.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Buffalo had quarterback Jim Kelly for four previous seasons, ever since the
folding of the USFL in which he played, but the offense he directed was so
lifeless that not only Kelly but Bills owner Ralph Wilson publicly
complained.;    Offensive coordinator Ted Marchibroda switched to the
no-huddle, which put the play-calling responsibility on Kelly as well as
prevented substitutions and adjustments by the defense. He was persuaded to
change for a reason that long has intrigued many football fans: With the
ability of no-huddle offenses to rapidly move the ball in the final minutes of
each half, why not use such an offense the entire game?;    "Last year there
were three times when we had to score the last two times we had the ball to
win -- the Rams, Miami and Houston," Marchibroda told the Buffalo News this
week. "So I said to myself, 'If it's so successful at the end of the half and
the end of ballgames, why would it not be successful during the regular course
of the game?' So we opened up with it against Indianapolis, and it has been
going ever since.";    Using the new offense against the Colts in the season
opener, Kelly began the game with a team-record 14 consecutive completions in
a 26-10 victory.;    A week later, on an 88-degree day in Miami, the Bills
were clobbered 30-7. Two fumbles, an interception and three sacks proved the
no-huddle wasn't invincible. The Bills later called the game their "wake-up
call.";    But it was two weeks later, after a 30-7 Monday night victory over
the New York Jets in which all-purpose back Thurman Thomas rushed for 214
yards, that the rest of the NFL woke up to what the Bills were up to.;    More
than the no-huddle offense was working for the Bills.;    Within 1 minute, 17
seconds of a Sept. 30 game against the Denver Broncos, the Bills threw up 20
fourth-quarter points, erased a 21-9 Broncos lead and won 29-28. The next
week, in Game 5, with the Los Angeles Raiders leading 24-14 in the final
period, Buffalo scored 24 points in 6:03 to win 38-24.;    The victory over
the Raiders began with a 42-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to wide receiver
James Lofton. Then a blocked punt by Steve Tasker was picked up by James
Williams and returned for a touchdown. Linebacker Cornelius Bennett sacked the
Raiders' Jay Schroeder on the next possession, causing a fumble that Bennett
recovered. The Bills got a field goal from that turnover. Three plays later,
cornerback Nate Odomes stripped the ball from receiver Willie Gault and ran 49
yards for another TD.;    It took a scoring pass from Kelly to fullback Jamie
Mueller with 19 seconds to go to beat the Jets 30-27 the next week before the
scary games were over for a while.;    The Bills knocked off the New England
Patriots 27-10 in Game 7, swamped the Cleveland Browns 42-0 in Game 8, pounded
the Phoenix Cardinals 45-10 in rain, hail and snow to start the second half of
the season, and then shut out the Patriots 14-0.;    In Houston, the string
snapped. The Oilers, behind the passing of Warren Moon, won 27-24.;    The
next week against the playoff-bound Philadelphia Eagles, however, Kelly fired
three touchdown passes in a 24-0 first quarter and the Bills held on for a
30-23 victory.;    An easy 31-7 victory over the Colts brought the Bills to a
Super Bowl preview, a 17-13 defeat of the New York Giants in which Kelly and
Giants quarterback Phil Simms sustained injuries.;    Playing without Kelly,
who had suffered torn cartilage and damaged ligaments in his knee, the Bills
avenged their early season defeat by downing the Dolphins 24-14 to clinch the
AFC East title. Fill-in quarterback Frank Reich was 15 of 21 for 234 yards and
TDs to Lofton and Andre Reed.;    With the home-field advantage assured
throughout the AFC playoffs, the Bills were downed 29-14 by the Washington
Redskins in the regular-season finale.;    After a week off while the
wild-card teams and the weakest division winner fought it out, Kelly returned
to the lineup to lead the Bills to a 44-34 victory over the Dolphins in a
snowstorm. That set up Sunday's 51-3 blowout of the Raiders and a berth in the
Super Bowl.;    "There used to be a joke around here when we were not
winning," linebacker Darryl Talley said after the AFC championship game. "It
went: 'Knock, knock.' 'Who's there?' 'Owen.' 'Owen who?' 'Oh and 10.' ";   
It's not a joke the Bills have heard this season.;  Bills' log (15-3); Sept. 9
