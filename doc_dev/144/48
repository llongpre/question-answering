<DESCRIPT>  RESTAURANT; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  One of the best birthday presents I've received lately is a book on bad taste.
I refused to take the gift personally, but I felt it was a reflection of my
fascination with American pop culture. Pop culture is really serious business,
something akin to a fun house mirror, as it usually tells us more about
ourselves and how we live than we commonly think about and perhaps more than
we would like to know.;    If I were to mention almost any of the items or
categories in the Encyclopedia of Bad Taste, I'd be inundated with letters
castigating my morals, intelligence and parentage.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BUFFALO BILL STILL SERVES GOOD PUB FOOD
HAYWARD EATERY FEATURES WELL-MADE BEER  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>     Needless to say, I was a little surprised to find beer included, though the
authors provide a fair rationale for their choice. On the other hand, however,
a growing little industry is the brew pub and its accompanying cuisine.;   
Buffalo Bill's brew pub in Hayward, owned and operated by an award-winning
former photo-journalist Bill Owens, was at the vanguard of the brew pub
movement and while some places have come and gone, Buffalo's, which opened in
1982, has been around for a while.;    This is not high cuisine. Instead, what
you get is an Americanized version of pub food: fairly simple food, usually a
little spicy, chosen and served to accompany and complement the custom-brewed
beer.;    What is nice, even good, about brew pubs, and there is a fair-sized
number of such places ringing the bay, is that each is different in the beer
they brew and serve, in their food and in their atmosphere. This is true
individuality in a culture marked by mass marketing and mass consumption.;   
The food served at Buffalo Bill's is, after all, pretty good. It is usually
quickly prepared and served and is priced at the lower end of the restaurant
dollar spectrum.;    At the high end of the menu are Buffalo Bill's personal
pizzas for $5.;    Given what I have paid for a personal pizza, this is a good
buy.;    The offerings actually vary, so it's worth asking what's on the
menu.;    Not long ago I had an American southwestern style pizza, flavored
with a smoky, salsa-like sauce in lieu of the traditional tomato paste. There
were chilies, red peppers, onions, dried tomatoes and a chorizo-style sausage.
Not only was it very good, but given what a Berkeley or San Francisco
gourmet-ghetto personal pizza goes for, it was a steal.;    More recently,
Buffalo's has been offering a more traditional personal pizza, but the quality
of ingredients, peppers, salami, onions, is more than adequate and the sauce
at least on the good side of average.;    The thin pizza crust is handmade and
as good as you'd find.;    One warning however: because this is a small
restaurant, they do sell out. On a recent Monday lunch, the pizzas weren't
available because they had used all the available dough on the weekend and the
new batch hadn't finished rising.;    In the mid-range of prices, at $3, is a
small selection of sandwiches, turkey, ham, pastrami and the like, as well as
two good sausages, a hot link and a polish sausage.;    Both the hot link and
polish are done very well. Served on a crisp french roll, the sausages are
meaty, lean, flavorful and tender.;    To make a good thing even better, the
links are served with melted jack or Swiss cheese and dressed with a dark,
spicy tomato sauce which complements the taste of the meat.;    Accompanying
the roll will be a generous handful of tortilla chips, pickle chips and a hot
pepper or two. For $3, not bad.;    A couple other pub classics, buffalo wings
and a ploughman's lunch are also available for $3. Both are a good, cheap
lunch.;    Bill's soups ($3.50 a bowl, $2 a cup), are also better than
expected. Again, the offering will change daily, but I've sampled three:
chili, corn chowder and black bean soup, and all were done very competently.
The soups, and all the food, are made in a tiny kitchen so it is sometimes
amazing how good the items are. The black bean soup was superb and it is worth
a call to find out when it's being offered.;    I can do without the swirl of
sour cream that cooks seem to think is necessary, but the soup was rich and
filled with a complex range of spices and taste. It is good.;    Bill's chili
is also done very well and when I heard the person behind the bar boast about
her "killer chili," I had to try it.;    While a bowl of chili and a glass of
beer may be really plebeian, when you taste both (or either) at Buffalo's,
then you may want to consider your preconceptions.;    The chili, like the
black bean soup, was hearty and rich, filled with tender beans, a deep broth
and tender pieces of meat. Even on a sunny winter's day, you can't go wrong.; 
  My last lunch at Buffalo's coincided with an offering of Bill's Double Cream
Ale ($1.75 for a small glass, $3.25 for a pint), one of the smoothest,
creamiest ales I've tasted.;    There is a hint of cream soda in the glass,
but this is true, pure beer, born of a skilled brewer's hand. If you associate
beer with the canned or bottled stuff brewed in huge tanks and consumed in
mass quantities in front of a televised football game, then prepare to have
your reality altered.;    In fact, almost all of Bill Owen's beers are very
good and brewed for sipping and tasting, not for some macho entertainment. In
the fall, a trip to Hayward to taste his Pumpkin Ale is worth making.;    The
decor/atmosphere is on the downside. The place is dark with concrete walls
lightened by a collection of flags, a history of brewing and beer display, a
battered football game, cases of beer, a dart board and, of course, a
wall-mounted buffalo head. There is a long wooden bar and a collection
miscellaneous library tables and assorted chairs. It is, for good or bad, the
type of place where you don't need to take off your baseball hat when you
dine.;    Buffalo Bill's; (star)(star) 1/2; Where: 1082 B Street, Hayward;
