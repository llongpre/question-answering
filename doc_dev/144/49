<LEADPARA>  CHANCES seem solid that Tommy Lee Jones, Anjelica Huston and other principal
members of the 1989 "Lonesome Dove" cast will take part in its planned
sequel.;    According to exec producer Suzanne de Passe, all "surviving cast
members" are ready to saddle up for another chapter in the western saga,
"subject to reading the script, of course."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     That script is now being drafted by John Wilder, with "Lonesome Dove"
novelist Larry McMurtry serving as consultant. If all goes as planned,
"Lonesome Dove II" should be galloping onto the video range in the fall of
'92.;    MEANWHILE: De Passe hopes to follow the "Lonesome" sequel with a
four-hour miniseries adaptation of McMurtry's "Buffalo Girls" for CBS. "We've
made the deal . . . Hopefully we could make it for spring of '93." De Passe
has no casting in mind for the featured role of Calamity Jane, but says the
part is an actress' dream. She explains that McMurtry's "Buffalo Girls" paints
a very different portrait of the renowned gun-totin' cowgirl who buddied with
such famed real-life characters of the Old West as Wild Bill Hickock and
Buffalo Bill Cody. Says the producer, "She's really a rugged character in this
piece -- with her male side extremely in the forefront . . . she lived hard,
rode hard and abused herself. She had a heart of gold, but was very
self-destructive and could never quite pull it all together. It's a very
poignant story."; From Liz Smith in New York;    MORE VOTES: Last week, it was
said that a Massachusetts voters' poll indicates Sen. Edward Kennedy should
step aside in the light of recent events in Palm Beach.;    Interestingly
enough, columnist Jimmy Breslin was the first to point the way for the
senator, suggesting it was time for him to try Alcoholics Anonymous. Now comes
the controversial and powerful Bob Scheer in the August issue of Playboy, and
he urges Kennedy to do the same thing.;    Scheer makes his plea in an
evocation of Kennedy's longtime effectiveness as a U.S. senator and says Ted's
efforts as a public servant have far outstripped both his brothers', John and
Robert. Scheer notes that Kennedy is the best advocate for America's
underprivileged, and he too urges the senator to embrace "the 12 steps.";   
NOVEL RESPONSE: Julia Phillips called this week. Although banned from all of
L.A.'s smart movie-denizen cafes since she published her memoir, "You'll Never
Eat Lunch in This Town Again," she sounded well-fed and carefree.;   
Recently, this column reported that Phillips is working on her second book,
and it was implied that such a work might be based on portions cut by her
publisher's attorneys from Phillips' infamous real-life tale of her
drugged-out life and times. She says she may have "facetiously" said so, but
it is incorrect.;    "I have been struggling to write a complete book of
fiction for the past 10 years. Now I am actually going to do it, but not from
'discards' out of 'Lunch.' This novel will have as a character a dog who talks
and has a drug problem."  </TEXT>
