   Seventy-two years after Congress stripped
Buffalo Bill Cody of his Medal of Honor, the Indian scout's name has
been restored to the honor roll.
   ``He's entitled to the honor, he was given the honor and he
should have the honor,'' said Buffalo Bill's grandson, 76-year-old
Bill G. Cody. ``We've always contended that once he was awarded the
medal, they shouldn't revoke it _ especially after he was dead.''
   William F. ``Buffalo Bill'' Cody, who became a famous western
showman after the Indian wars, received the medal in 1872 for his
gallantry as an Army scout during the wars.
   But it was revoked, along with medals of 910 other recipients, in
1917 after Congress retroactively tightened up the rules for the
honor. Among other changes, Congress held that only enlisted men and
officers could receive the award. A scout was considered a civilian;
in all, five scouts lost medals in 1917.
   U.S. Sens. Alan Simpson and Malcolm Wallop, who jointly announced
the Army's decision Friday, said Buffalo Bill deserved the honor.
   ``Today's action by the Army sets the record straight,'' Wallop
said. ``After extensive research and review of the facts, the Army
has decided that Buffalo Bill clearly deserves our nation's highest
honor.''
   Buffalo Bill gained fame for his western show that toured the
country and Europe glamorizing the western frontier with real
cowboys and Indians re-enacting battles.
   Paul Fees, senior curator of the Buffalo Bill Historical Center
in Cody, Wyo. _ a town named for Buffalo Bill _ said the western
show may have cost Buffalo Bill some credibility as a real hero.
   Friday's action restores that credibility, said Fees.
   ``The fact that this medal was restored for cause, people can
believe that he was a true hero and earned his reputation rather
than had it invented for him through press agents,'' said Fees.
   Buffalo Bill, known by his contemporaries as a Pony Express
rider, Indian scout and buffalo hunter, received the honor for valor
after leading a cavalry charge against a raiding band of Sioux
Indians. He killed two, recovered several horses, and pursued the
retreating band.
   Although Buffalo Bill's name was stricken from the Medal of Honor
roll in February 1917, one month after he died, the medal itself was
never recalled and remains in the historical center.
   Fees said only one of the other 910 persons to lose medals in the
1917 purge of the rolls has since regained it, a woman Army surgeon
during the Civil War whose medal was restored in 1978.
   He said he hoped that the families of the other four scouts
affected by the 72-year-old ruling would take the same steps the
Cody family did to get their relatives' medals awarded again.
