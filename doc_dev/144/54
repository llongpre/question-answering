   You'd think an 81-year-old Texan would be
satisfied with a string of careers that reads: star of radio,
records, movies and TV, broadcast czar, real estate tycoon, baseball
mogul.
   But singing cowboy Gene Autry is back in the saddle with a new
pursuit: preserver of the American West, real and legendary, at a
museum underwritten with more than $50 million from his foundations.
   The Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, which opens Tuesday,
traces the West from prehistory to conquistadores to Lewis and Clark
to cowboys to Hollywood images.
   It's meant as a gift to the world, not a monument to himself,
said Autry, who first sang on radio in 1928, made 95 films, had a TV
show from 1950 to 1955, and cut 635 records, including ``Rudolph the
Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' ``Silver-Haired Daddy of Mine,'' and the
signature ``Back in the Saddle Again.''
   Autry hung up his performing spurs in 1956, and by the mid-'60s
owned part or all of nine radio and TV stations, four hotels, the
California Angels, 16,000 acres in Colorado, oil, music publishing,
a movie studio. Along the way he started collecting Western
memorabilia and art.
   ``I felt that I owed something. The West has been very kind to me
over the years,'' said Autry, whose net worth is about $230 million,
according to Forbes magazine.
   ``I figured that the least I could do is leave something for the
youth so they can see what it was all about.''
   Autry's tile-dotted, Spanish-style museum has seven main
galleries with 51,000 square feet of space, each featuring a
``spirit'' or aspect of the West. The building cost $34 million and
houses $20 million worth of exhibits.
   It has two exhibition halls, a theater, library and restaurant on
13 acres in Griffith Park.
   ``He had been thinking about this for 30 years, 40 years,
collecting artifacts of the West as he went from town to town,''
said the museum's executive director, Joanne D. Hale.
   The exhibits were designed by Disney's Imagineering team to
delight as well as instruct. Bridles and six-shooters gleam like
jewels suspended on clear plexiglass holders; items behind glass in
the galleries come to life in a 3-D movie with ``magic'' Disney
pioneered at its theme parks.
   The aim is to capture not only the West romanticized by artists,
authors and Hollywood, but the reality of frontier life, said
curator James Nottage.
   ``You expect that someone is going to save pistols owned by
Custer, so it's not surprising that we have those,'' Nottage said.
``The hard items to find are the common ones.
   ``So we're proud of things like a simple day dress from the
1840s. What are the odds of an item like that surviving?''
   Nottage shows off a collections of items used by Mexican cowboys,
the original range riders, such as a mid-1700s Saltillo serape worn
to ward off the weather. He hopes to expand the museum's displays of
items about women, minorities and business people in the West.
   But it's the romance of the dime novel and matinee that's the
long suit for now.
   Visitors can toss a leg over a saddle and fire a six-shooter as
they become part of a ``movie'' using the television technique that
superimposes weather reporters over their weather maps.
   Or they can just peruse:
   _Guns owned by Annie Oakley, Wyatt Earp, Jesse James; saddles
from Buffalo Bill Cody and bronc-busting legend Yakima Canutt;
Autry's own guitars, their necks inlaid with his name in
mother-of-pearl.
   _Cecil B. DeMille's camera from the 1914 version of ``The Squaw
Man,'' the Western often described as the first full-length picture
shot in Hollywood.
   _Costume after costume: Tonto and the Lone Ranger's get-ups,
Clint Eastwood's ``Pale Rider'' long coat, the eye-assaulting
glitter of country-western outfits from Nudie's Rodeo Tailors of
North Hollywood.
   _Ed Bohlin show saddles dripping with what looks like a ton of
silver.
   Among Autry's favorite items are an 1870s-era steam fire engine
from Nevada, a collection of Theodore Roosevelt memorabilia, and a
collection of more than 100 guns from Colt, including several made
for presidents, which Autry purchased from the famous firearms
company.
   ``They were actually offered more money than I paid for it,'' he
said. ``But whoever was bidding on it was going to sell some of the
most important items, maybe trying to get their money back. So I
told the people at Colt the collection would not be broken up.''
