The popular perception of William Cody stems almost entirely from his famous
Wild West Show which, for 30 years around the turn of the century, brought
cowboys and indians to the cities of Europe. Timewatch (8.10, BBC2) digs out
rare film footage and talks to some who knew Cody to re-evaluate the story
of the man who was better known as Buffalo Bill. Joan Shenton who, via her
Channel 4 programmes, has done more than anyone to undermine the dogma of
the Aids fanatics, continues her work today in Dispatches (9.00). Goggle
Eyes, described as a 4-part comedy drama, is adapted from Anne Fine's award
winning novel about a one-parent family. Mother Rosie falls for an older
'rather conventional' man with glasses and the resultant mayhem is seen
through the eyes of 12-year-old Kitty, played by the wonderfully named
Honeysuckle Weeks (9.25 BBC2). With the incidence of skin cancer rising
rapidly, QED investigates the causes: sunbathing and the thinning of the
ozone layer (9.30 BBC1). BBC2 begins a new comedy written by the creator of
Rab Nesbitt: I, Lovett. The central character is an eccentric inventor
(10.05).
