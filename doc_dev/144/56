<LEADPARA>  It's unlikely that Bo Jackson will play for the Los Angeles Raiders in
Sunday's AFC championship game against the Buffalo Bills.;    The Raiders on
Wednesday listed Jackson as "doubtful" because of his injured left hip. That
designation on the NFL's required injury report means Jackson has only a 25
percent chance of playing.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Bo Jackson's sore. He has a limp in his giddy-up," Raiders Coach Art Shell
said. "He's getting constant treatment. He's doubtful, but you never know.";  
 Jackson was injured when tackled by Kevin Walker at the end of a 34-yard run
on the second play of the third quarter of the Raiders' 20-10 victory over the
Cincinnati Bengals in a second-round playoff game.;    Jackson said afterward
that he intended to play against the Bills, but he underwent a magnetic
resonance imaging test Monday and hasn't commented since then.;    "He won't
play this week," said team doctor Robert Rosenfeld, who wouldn't be specific
about the injury. Asked if he could play a week later, if the Raiders are in
the Super Bowl, the doctor said, "I wish we had the usual two weeks between
games.";    Shell said he didn't think Jackson would be able to test his
injury in practice for a couple of days.;    "He has some swelling in the
(hip) area," Shell said. "They didn't find anything else.";    To protect
against the loss of Jackson, the Raiders will activate former Bills running
back Greg Bell to back up Marcus Allen.;    Three other Raiders were listed as
"probable," meaning they have a 75 percent chance of playing. They are safety
Eddie Anderson (calf), defensive end Howie Long (thumb) and cornerback Lionel
Washington (hamstring). The Bills' only injury is a broken leg suffered by
reserve linebacker Marcus Patton, who has been placed on injured reserve.;   
Bell was the leading rusher with the Los Angeles Rams last season and has
spent three months on injured reserve because of a sprained ankle.;    Allen,
long a team leader, rushed for 140 yard in the victory over Cincinnati.;   
"This doesn't change anything," said Allen. "They'll activate Greg (Bell) and
we'll split the load again, the way we've done it all year. Things have gone
well (with the platoon), so we'll continue it.;    In eight career playoff
games, Allen has gained 894 yards, averaging 6 yards a carry. He's gone over
the 100-yard mark five times. One more and he'll tie the NFL record for career
100-yard playoff games held by John Riggins.;    Nevertheless, in Buffalo,
shouts of hip-hip-hurray were heard from atop the snowbanks. The Bills beat
the Raiders 38-24 in Buffalo on Oct. 7 before Jackson had joined the Raiders
upon completion of his duties as an outfielder for the Kansas City Royals.;   
"If we don't have Bo," Raiders quarterback Jay Schroeder said, "someone else
will have to step in. We still have a very good team without Bo. We didn't
have him the last time.";    The Raiders led 24-14 in the fourth quarter of
the first meeting and seemed to have the game well in hand before the Bills
scored 24 unanswered points in a span of 6 minutes, 3 seconds to win 38-24.; 
KELLY FINE: A week after the uncertainty of Jim Kelly's return as quarterback
of the Buffalo Bills became an important factor in the playoffs, there no
longer is any question of his status.;    "My knee is fine," Kelly said
Wednesday. "I worked it extensively yesterday. It's a little sore today, but
it's fine."  </TEXT>
