<LEADPARA>  Buffalo Bills Coach Marv Levy, one of the most articulate of NFL coaches,
found a historical reference last week to fend off persistent questions about
his team's outlook going into today's Super Bowl.;    Levy said he remembered
as a boy listening to the buildup before a heavyweight championship bout
between Joe Louis and a contender. The contender, he said, filled up about 10
minutes explaining his strategy and outlining what he intended to do to the
champ.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Then they asked Joe Louis," Levy said. "Louis said, 'I'll be there, and
I'll be on time.' ";    Levy made the same promise for his team, which is
scheduled to meet the New York Giants today at Tampa Stadium in the 25th Super
Bowl. In the shadow of war, the NFL planned to stage its biggest show despite
the threat of the broadcast's being pre-empted by events in the Persian Gulf,
and fears of a terrorist strike.;    Every spectator who enters the
74,296-seat stadium will be searched with a metal scanning device, and every
piece of electronic equipment carried by the thousands of reporters who cover
the event will be X-rayed and examined. The area around the stadium has been
sealed for several days, air traffic (including the trademark blimps) has been
grounded, and more than 2,000 federal, state, local and private guards have
combined to provide security for the game.;    Such is the peculiar atmosphere
for what ought to be one of the most evenly matched Super Bowls in recent
history. Despite fears that the NFL's expanded playoff format would allow a
lesser team to make the big game, both the Bills and the Giants sport 15-3
records, and each represents the cream of its conference.;    By now there has
been so much analysis of these two teams that the outcome might as easily be
determined by computer. But both the Bills and the Giants have proved this
season that they are capable of rising to almost any occasion and can win with
surprise as well as consistency.;    According to conventional wisdom, the
pace set in the first quarter of today's game ought to determine the outcome.
If the Bills can establish their fast-paced, no-huddle passing game and score
early, the Giants are doomed. But if the Giants stop the quick attack early
and force a slower, steadier pace, they have the advantage.;    Bills
quarterback Jim Kelly, receivers Andre Reed and James Lofton and running back
Thurman Thomas have been the core of one of the most exciting offenses in
football this season. Last week Kelly and the Bills put on their biggest show
yet, demolishing the Los Angeles Raiders 51-3 in the AFC championship game.;  
 "Quite obviously, when you're playing a scoring team like Buffalo, we have to
play better defense in this game than their other two playoff opponents,"
Giants Coach Bill Parcells said. "I don't think we can win a shootout game
with Buffalo. I really don't.";    The Giants' strength is their defense,
which has allowed an average of only 13 points per game this season.;    With
the ferocious pass rush and rushing defense featuring defensive lineman
Leonard Marshall, linebackers Lawrence Taylor and Pepper Johnson, and a steady
secondary that rarely gives up the kind of big plays that have been winning
games all season for Buffalo, the Giants have a good chance of derailing the
Bills' express-train offense and forcing their upstate rival into playing the
methodical, low-scoring, pounding football that has been the Giants'
strength.;    "What you saw the Bills do against the Raiders and so many other
teams this season, the Giants won't let them do," Philadelphia Eagles Coach
Rich Kotite said. He said the Giants' defensive coordinator, Bill Belichick,
"will find a way to shut that down" and "eliminate the big play.";    Levy
said he has tried to warn his players not to feel too cocky after last week's
blowout.;    "You're not going to have that type of thing occur very often,"
he said. "I hope we keep getting better. I hope we keep playing sound
football.";    By the numbers, the Giants ought to win if they can just play
their kind of game. In a low-scoring contest, the Giants can exploit one of
the Bills' defensive weaknesses by grinding away yards on the ground --
Buffalo ranked 15th in the league against the run and gave up 113 yards per
game rushing.;    But the exciting thing about any sport is precisely how
unpredictable it can be. When the Bills and the Giants last met, Dec. 15 at
Giants Stadium, the game went precisely as Parcells might have planned it. The
Giants slowed down the Bills' passing threat (knocking Kelly out of the game
late in the first half) and ground out 157 yards rushing -- and lost 17-13.  </TEXT>
