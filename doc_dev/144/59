<LEADPARA>  LET'S give Sam Wyche credit for consistency. He's complained this season about
an overemphasis on winning, and seven games later -- including one disgraceful
Monday night -- Wyche has proved he's not the least bit concerned about it.;  
The competitor in you feels for an 0-7 coach who went to the Super Bowl just
three seasons ago, who shared the AFC Central title one year ago. The
pragmatist in you realizes that the Bengals are an emotional mess and Wyche is
the reason why.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Not content just to leave folks in Cincinnati convinced their local NFL
coach has completely lost it this season, Wyche had to convince the rest of
America that he's totally out of control, too.;   While the Bengals did all
they could to lose to the Buffalo Bills 35-16 Monday night, we witnessed Wyche
run on the field and scream at officials, shout at assistant coach Jim
Anderson and generally lose all composure.;   The players joined in the melee.
Cornerback Mitchell Price kicked Bills wide receiver James Lofton while Lofton
was on the ground. Frustrated safety David Fulcher was shown screaming at the
Buffalo sideline.;   Then there were the penalties, 12 for 105 yards. A
holding call killed a touchdown and an offside call nullified a successful
onside kick. Flags flew, of course, when Wyche ran on the field and Price
played soccer with Lofton.;   Meanwhile, the Bengals turned three
interceptions into just three points. Chalk that up to some Wyche play-calling
that made Chargers Coach Dan Henning look like Vince Lombardi.;   Wyche was
featured in a halftime interview. He looked tired -- of the whole thing. He
spoke about wanting to coach high school football again. Maybe it's not too
late.; MORE DOWN AND OUT: As sorry as the Bengals are, the Colts are even
worse off at 0-8. They're dead last in the league in total offense, and it's
no wonder.;   In eight games, Indy has scored only 55 points. Despite the
high-priced tandem of quarterback Jeff George and running back Eric Dickerson,
the Colts have failed to score a touchdown in six of those eight games.;   In
sharp contrast, there are the 7-1 Buffalo Bills, who have scored a league-high
245 points, or the 7-0 Washington Redskins (231.) The NFL average so far this
season is 135.1. The 49ers have 164.;   Which brings us to some Colts
dissension, and a thoughtful suggestion for the . . . Colts' secession? Center
Brian Baldinger is so embarrassed by his team's act this season, he's thinking
about it.;   "At this level we don't belong in the NFL," he grumbled. "We're
not capable of beating an NFL team." Whoa.; KILLER GAME OF THE WEEK: By all
means, check this one out: The New York Giants (4-3) playing host to the
undefeated Redskins. First glance says this ought to go the Redskins' way,
given the Giants haven't exactly made the Lombardi Trophy proud so far this
year.;   Except . . . the Giants have won the last six games and nine of the
last 11 against Washington, and they'll take that bit of history on the field
with them tonight at the Meadowlands.;   "They've got us on their minds,"
linebacker Lawrence Taylor said. "They haven't beaten us in a long time. The
pressure is on them.";   Should the Redskins win, it'll be the first 8-0 start
in their history. But not so fast . . .;   "I think 0-6 is like a thorn in
their claw," Giants cornerback Mark Collins said. "It's eating at them. It's
got to be. Them being 7-0 is pretty impressive, but we're not impressed. We
can't be."; NO WAY ON REPLAY: So says Kansas City Chiefs Coach Marty
Schottenheimer, who saw the outcome of two key plays for his team undermined
by instant replay last Sunday:;   (check) A 4-yard touchdown pass from Steve
DeBerg to J.J. Birden was called back by a replay official who ruled that
DeBerg's knee had hit the ground as he spun away from Denver's Mike Croel.;  
(check) A replay took away a first down on a fourth-down play from the Chiefs,
placing the ball a yard farther back after the officials had marked it.;   In
the first case, Kansas City had to settle for a field goal; in the second, the
loss of the first down led to a Denver field goal. The net result was a 19-16
victory by the Broncos that moved them ahead of the Chiefs in the AFC West.;  
"You can argue. But you're swimming upstream," said Schottenheimer, who is in
perfect position to do so, considering he's on the NFL's rule-making
committee.; EXTRA POINTS: Jerry Rice needs only two touchdowns to overtake Don
Maynard (88) for third place on the all-time touchdown reception list. . . .
The Raiders, who play the Chiefs on Monday night, have a three-game Monday
night winning streak and an NFL-best 29-6-1 Monday night mark. . . . The Bills
are 11-0 when running back Thurman Thomas and wide receiver Andre Reed score
touchdowns.  </TEXT>
