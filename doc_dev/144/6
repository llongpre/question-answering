   A forest fire that swept out of Yellowstone
National Park threatened a fir tree inscribed by western showman
Buffalo Bill Cody, and his grandson feared the worst for his
namesake's landmark.
   But it survived even though trees 6 feet away were burned.
   ``You talk about a miracle. I'll say it was,'' Bill Cody said.
   The fir tree's 4-foot-thick trunk was inscribed ``Camp Monaco
1913'' when Buffalo Bill was host to Prince Albert of Monaco on a
hunting trip in the Shoshone National Forest. Cody's famous Wild
West show was a hit in Europe.
   ``It was about this time of year when Granddad took the prince
up there,'' Cody said.
   He had been worried about the tree ever since the Clover-Mist
fire surged into the North Fork drainage about two weeks ago, but a
helicopter flight over the area with U.S. Forest Service rangers
confirmed the tree was safe.
   Camp Monaco is a half day's horseback ride from Pahaska Tepee,
Buffalo Bill's hunting lodge near Yellowstone's east entrance.
   Cody said he had been considering attempting to salvage the
inscription if the tree burned, but he started to fear the worst
when he saw from the air how much damage the fire had caused.
   ``It was a disaster all the way up the North Fork. On both sides
of the river there was nothing but burn, burn, burn,'' he said.
   But when the helicopter approached a meadow near Camp Monaco,
Cody spotted a clump of green amid hundred of acres of black.
   ``It looked just like a pinpoint in the middle of a pie,'' he
said.``When I saw the tree was saved I let out a yell. There were
burned trees within 6 feet of it, and a bottle lying about 6 feet
away was scorched.''
