   Thousands of well-wishers whooped and hollered
as a wagon train that covered 260 dusty miles over 30 days rolled
into town to celebrate the state's centennial.
   Spectators jammed streets and rooftops in this frontier town
founded by showman Buffalo Bill Cody to watch the 4-mile-long
procession of some 200 wagons and 1,600 riders on horseback Monday.
   Kayne Pyatt, the trail boss who oversaw the odyssey, compared
the journey to an ``Alice in Wonderland'' experience.
   ``It's sort of like I've lived a great childhood adventure, a
fantasy,'' she said, having braved wind, dust and thunderstorms,
righted wrecked wagons and even broken a few ribs. ``If I died
tomorrow, I'd be satisfied.''
   Organized as a tribute to Wyoming's birthday on July 10, the
wagon train left Fort Caspar June 2. It attracted Western
aficionados from throughout the country who joined at various parts
of the Bridger Trail, which was one of the splinters of the Oregon
Trail leading west from Missouri.
   Sen. Alan Simpson rode the last few miles.
   ``There'll be as many people saying they rode the Wyoming
Centennial Wagon Train as said they saw Babe Ruth's last game at
Yankee Stadium _ about 7 million,'' said the Republican, who grew
up in Cody.
   The riders started the day Monday about 16 miles east of Cody.
They traveled alongside a highway, passing sugar beet and barley
fields, crossing the raging Shoshone River and encountering a
torrential downpour about a mile out.
   The sun broke through just as they reached the edge of town,
distant thunder and lightning adding to the drama. Horses reared
and bucked, riders waved and hollered and a few wagon passengers
played their fiddles to the crowd.
   ``Cody loves you!'' some spectators yelled. ``Happy birthday,
Wyoming!''
   On Monday's final leg, Simpson and his wife, Ann, were joined on
horseback by Gov. Mike Sullivan and his wife, Jane. Montana Gov.
Stan Stephens rode in a red surrey.
   ``I wouldn't have bet there were this many horses in this whole
United States,'' said lifelong Cody resident Frank McJunkin, 70, as
he watched the covered wagons and riders ramble by.
