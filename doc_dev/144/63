   Macho muscle shirts clash with drippy,
high-water pants at ``Jocks and Nerds,'' a fashion exhibit that
celebrates and spoofs 20th-century men.
   The two stereotypes are among 12 categories being explored
through May 16 in an exhibit at the Fashion Institute of Technology
that shows ``how men create images for themselves,'' said curator
Richard Martin.
   Mannequins are transformed into jocks, nerds, rebels, workers,
cowboys, military men, hunters, sportsmen, Joe College,
businessmen, men about town and dandies.
   A man's clothing reflects his personality, although ``perhaps
not in a purely conscious way,'' Martin said.
   ``Someone can be a businessman five days a week, but on Saturday
he puts on his safari jacket and becomes the Ernest Hemingway of
Great Neck,'' said Martin. ``At night, he goes to a downtown club
and becomes a rebel.''
   Or perhaps a jock _ depicted here in photographs of Sylvester
Stallone as ``Rocky,'' a reclining Jim Palmer pitching Jockey
underwear, and a comic book outlining Charles Atlas' rise from
97-pound-weakling to he-man.
   ``Jocks go in and out of favor. In the late 1960s and early
'70s, the anti-establishment time, jocks were portrayed as dumb,''
said Martin. But they are always perceived as sexy.
   ``Indeed, the classification of men's underwear into jockey and
boxer shorts, both alluding to sports, seems to imply that the
sanction of athletics is required for manly attire,'' notes the
``Jocks and Nerds'' catalog.
   Nerds have other qualities.
   The exhibit, noted Martin, features ``our '80s nerd, complete
with white socks, high-water pants and black glasses: beautifully
made clothing that really respects the history of the nerd: the
pattern mix, the ungainliness, the T-shirt under the open collar of
a 1950s nylon shirt in a really icky material.''
   A nerd, he said, might wear a short-sleeve shirt under a sweater
vest, making ``his arms too cold and his chest too hot. It causes a
real sense of discomfort and the nerd projects that.''
   Nerds surfaced in the 1950s _ and a funny thing happened to them
in recent years. ``The downtown club people suddenly started
buttoning their top button and wearing high-water trousers,'' said
Martin.
   Also featured in the exhibit is a crowd of mannequins offering
blasts from the past: a paisley Nehru suit; cowboy chaps made of
sheepskin and skunk, on loan from the Buffalo Bill museum in Cody,
Wyo.; loud pants patterned with golf tees and balls, once favored
in Palm Beach; and a black velvet suit with bellbottom pants _
donated by Martin, who ``can't believe I wore that.''
   And Martin pointed out a collection of ``great, bizarre ties''
with pictures of hula dancers, Marilyn Monroe, cocker spaniels,
horses. ``There are always some men who are quite conventional but
who will buy the most extraordinary ties,'' he said.
   The clothing was borrowed, gleaned from staffers' attics and
scrounged at flea markets.
   ``We were real crazed flea-market shoppers. We'd get there the
minute the doors opened,'' said Martin, who usually hates to shop
but discovered he would ``go wild and become the worst sort of
grabby shopper'' while building the collection.
   He said it's believed to be the first exhibit of 20th century
men's clothing.
   ``Most museums have collected great women's clothing but have
very little concern for men's clothing,'' said Martin. ``It's very
difficult to find historic men's clothing _ men tend to wear it
until it wears out.''
