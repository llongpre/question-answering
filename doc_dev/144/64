than a week to prepare for the Super Bowl, but that doesn't mean the circus
atmosphere has completely disappeared. Giants linebacker Steve DeOssie makes a

<LEADPARA>  The New York Giants are preparing for Super Bowl XXV because, in part, they
pounded the 49ers' offense into submission in the NFC championship game Sunday
at Candlestick Park.;    Two days later and from 3,000 miles away, the Niners
took a few more knocks from the Giants on Tuesday at Tampa Stadium.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "They're not the best offense in the league," linebacker Pepper Johnson
said in an interview session at Tampa Stadium. "Against San Francisco, we were
in fourth gear. Now we have to put it in fifth gear for the Super Bowl. We
can't come in here and get embarrassed.";    The AFC champion Buffalo Bills
have done that to the last two defenses they faced, defeating Miami 44-34 in
one AFC playoff game and thumping the Los Angeles Raiders 51-3 for the
conference title.;    They've done it with a combination of Thurman Thomas'
running and Jim Kelly's passing and All-Pro center Kent Hull's blocking, which
may be why the Bills deserve to be held in higher esteem than the 49ers. The
Bills averaged 130 yards rushing and 199.8 yards passing during the regular
season to score 428 points. The Niners scored 75 fewer points with an offense
that averaged 107.4 yards on the ground and 261.1 yards passing.;    Giants
Coach Bill Parcells didn't mention the 49ers directly, but he agreed with
Johnson that the balanced offense of the Bills, ranked sixth in the NFL,
presented a much tougher challenge than the Niners' second-ranked attack.;   
"Offensively, they're probably as good as anybody we've played all year -- in
fact, better," Parcells said of the Bills, putting statistical rankings
aside.;    Whether it's the prospect of facing the Bills or the chance to slap
the Niners -- even Bills linebacker Bruce Smith took a shot, saying he'd
rather have played the 49ers because "everybody's a 49ers' fan and it makes me
sick" -- the Giants' defense downplayed its part in Sunday's 15-13 NFC
championship win.;    For instance, defensive back Everson Walls said his
confidence in the Giants' ability to handle the 49ers was such that he didn't
expect his mistake on the game's only touchdown, a 61-yard scoring pass play
to John Taylor, to cost his team the conference title.;    And judging by
their remarks, the Giants weren't concerned that the Niners' would unleash
more offense Sunday than in the teams' previous meeting Dec. 3, which the
49ers won 7-3.;    Defensive coordinator Bill Belichick, Johnson said, had
told the defensive unit point-blank that he expected it to be even stingier
with the Niners in the rematch.;    "In five years, I never heard Coach
Belichick say we could beat anybody," Johnson said. "He always gives the other
team credit. But against San Francisco, he said we had a much better defense"
than San Francisco had offense.;    It's not as if Johnson regards the Niners'
offense as the runner-up to the Bills', either. Asked about his team's
confidence after having handled "the NFL's best offense," Johnson didn't
realize the reference was to the 49ers. Instead, he flashed back to the
regular season, saying:;    "You mean Washington's?"  </TEXT>
