<LEADPARA>  Just how obsessed is Buffalo Bills running back Thurman Thomas when it comes
to Barry Sanders?;   Thomas goes nuts anytime Sanders' name comes up in
connection with the NFL rushing title. Perhaps it was the Heisman Trophy that
Sanders won after replacing Thomas at Oklahoma State (where they were
roommates).  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     When the Bills meet the Lions today, Thomas will be pushing to play, rather
than rest his sprained ankle for the playoffs. Word is he wants to back up
statements he made earlier this season that he was superior to Sanders because
he was a more versatile back.;   "Who's the best isn't something we argue
about. I have better stats," said Thomas, who really doesn't: Sanders has an
NFL-leading 1,440 yards in 316 carries; Thomas 1,407 yards, 288 carries.; WHO
NEEDS YOU?; Tim McKyer, so vocal, so obnoxious at so many times, has found a
home with the Atlanta Falcons, an equally vocal team that makes him feel
welcome.;   He concedes, though, that his volatile relationships with the
49ers and Miami Dolphins may have influenced his being left off the Pro Bowl
team again this year.;   "I don't go because I'm despised by other players,"
said McKyer, who has 26 career interceptions. "It used to be a goal of mine. I
thought if you did your job you'd be voted in. But I found out differently.
I'm not in the Pro Bowl fraternity. But that's OK.;   "I can't help it if Bill
Walsh didn't like me or Don Shula and I didn't mix," McKyer added. "As far as
going out and playing cornerback, no coach can denigrate that. I'm not here to
be liked by a head coach."; Mr. Sensitivity; The odds-on favorite for AFC
coach of the year has to be the Patriots' Dick MacPherson, whose personality
has gone a long way in helping New England up from the bottom of the heap.;  
In the preseason, after MacPherson received extensive advice from embattled
Bengals Coach Sam Wyche on time organization, his loyalty to his equally
emotional peer was firmly entrenched.;   MacPherson was watching the night of
Oct. 21 when the ABC announcing team ripped Wyche's antics during a 35-16 loss
in Buffalo.;   "One of the problems with television is what they think they
see going on down on the field might not really be what's going on,"
MacPherson said afterward. "I don't know what Sam's done to ever embarrass the
Cincinnati Bengals."  </TEXT>
