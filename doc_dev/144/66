   Dabney Coleman has made a career of playing
high-powered cads. Nevertheless, he's unhappy with the way
businessmen are portrayed on TV.
   In his latest movie, NBC's ``Maybe Baby,'' set for Monday, he's a
nice guy for a change. He plays a successful middle-aged
businessman. Still, he fears his comfortable way of life will be
interrupted because his new wife (Jane Curtin) feels her biological
clock ticking and wants to have a baby.
   ``I'd like to find something on Broadway or a picture that
involves a family business situation,'' he says. ``I want to play a
successful, moral businessman. You're either a cad who's successful
or you're a nice guy who isn't successful. Jimmy Stewart was a nice
guy in `You Can't Take It With You,' but he was a failure as a
businessman. The two just don't seem to go hand in hand.''
   Coleman is best-known for his outrageous roles in such movies as
``9 to 5'' and ``Tootsie,'' and on television in ``Fernwood
2Night,'' ``Fresno,'' ``Buffalo Bill'' and ``The Slap Maxwell
Story.'' But he's also played it straight, as in ``On Golden Pond''
and the Home Box Office movie ``Murrow,'' in which he played CBS
founder William Paley.
   Coleman says his view of businessmen is influenced by his former
father-in-law, Stanton Hale, one-time chairman of Pacific Mutual
Life Insurance Co. Coleman had been married to Jane Hale.
   ``That kind of integrity you don't often see on the screen,''
says Coleman.
   Coleman hasn't yet found his role. He recently completed
production in Appleton, Wis., of ``Meet the Applegates,'' a comedy
for New World Pictures. He plays the leader of a group of highly
developed giant insects from Brazil who assume human form to save
the world from what they see as the danger of nuclear energy. His
character is called Aunt Bea.
   He is at his Brentwood home between the two roles when he talks
about ``Maybe Baby.'' An avid baseball fan, Coleman wears a cap that
says ``SA'' to shield his face from the sun on the patio. It stands
for the San Antonio Missions, one of his favorite teams.
   He grew up in Texas and on visits to his home state he
occasionally stopped in San Antonio when Ramon Martinez, now with
the Los Angeles Dodgers, was pitching for the Missions.
   Coleman says Brandon Tartikoff, president of NBC Entertainment,
once told him, ``I'll bet you bat to right center.''
   ``I'd played some ball in Texas,'' he says, ``and I asked him how
he knew. Brandon said, `I know that because that's the way you play
a character.' Brandon could spot it. He once aspired to be a
professional baseball player.''
   In ``Maybe Baby,'' a romantic comedy, Coleman sees his good life
jeopardized when his wife decides to put her career on hold long
enough to have a child. His character has already raised a family
and isn't interested in starting over again at his age. The movie
also stars Julia Duffy as his daughter, Florence Stanley as his
secretary and David Doyle as his poker buddy.
   ``He's successful but I don't know what business it is,'' says
Coleman. ``He's successful enough to knock off at noon for golf. It
must be nice to work about five hours a day. The story's about
whether it's too late for them to have a child. He says, `Can you
picture a 70-year-old man rooting for his kid at a Little League
game?' But to Jane it's a case of now or never.''
   Coleman says he enjoyed working once again with Jane Curtin. They
were in the 1980 movie ``How To Beat the High Co$t of Living.'' He
played her policeman boyfriend. That movie also starred Susan Saint
James, who teamed up with Curtin for the comedy series ``Kate &amp;
Allie.''
   Immediately prior to ``Maybe Baby,'' Coleman played a lawyer in
the ABC miniseries ``Baby M.''
   He had also starred in the ABC comedy series ``The Slap Maxwell
Story,'' which was canceled due to low ratings and a disagreement
between Coleman and producer-creator Jay Tarses over how the show
should go. Slap Maxwell, a somewhat disagreeable sports writer, was
a nicer version of ``Buffalo Bill,'' an earlier series for NBC.
   ``I think where we went awry with `Slap Maxwell' was that I
thought he'd be different,'' says Coleman. ``I thought he'd be
honest, creative, a legitimate, grown-up professional, as opposed to
`Buffalo Bill.' But in the quest for comedy we had a tendency to be
like `Buffalo Bill.' Bill was a child, a self-serving, disloyal cad.
It was fun to play that. It was funnier, there's no question.
   ``I would have enjoyed `Slap' more if it had been funnier. But
I'm proud of it. It was not a lot of fun, but that's not always the
case with things you're proud of.''
