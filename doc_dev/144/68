The Buffalo Bills today announced they have signed ex-Ram free-agent cornerback 
Mickey Sutton. 
</P>
<P>
To make room for Sutton on their 47-man roster, the Bills Monday waived kick 
returner Errol Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton, 29, spent three years with the Rams before joining the Green Bay 
Packers as a Plan B free agent last winter. He was released last week by the 
Packers. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton will likely replace Tucker as the Bills kickoff and punt returner. 
</P>
<P>
Sutton served mostly as a backup cornerback and kick returner with the Rams 
after two seasons in the USFL. With the Rams, he started three games at right 
cornerback in 1987 and has four career interceptions. He has averaged 9.2 yards 
as a punt returner and 18.7 yards returning kickoffs.
