   Charles Robinson had one of your better
supporting roles on TV as Newdell, Dabney Coleman's intimidating
makeup man on ``Buffalo Bill.''
   When the critically acclaimed comedy failed to reach a wide
audience and was canceled by NBC, Robinson landed on his feet in
yet another great supporting role, on NBC's ``Night Court.''
   ```Buffalo Bill' was a wonderful show,'' Robinson said. ``But
unfortunately it didn't make it. I thought maybe my career was
over. Then I heard I might go to `Night Court.' Three days later I
got the call.''
   Robinson joined the ``Night Court'' cast in September 1984 when
the show began its first full season. He has been with the hit
comedy ever since as laid-back court clerk Mac Robinson.
   The series features a parade of defendants through the
unconventional night-time New York court session. It's sometimes
difficult to separate the itinerant loonies from the officers of
the court.
   Harry Anderson stars as the hip judge, John Larroquette has won
four Emmys as the licentious prosecutor, Markie Post is the perky
defense attorney and Richard Moll and Marsha Warfield are the
bailiffs.
   ``Mac's a more difficult character to play than Newdell was on
`Buffalo Bill,''' Robinson said. ``He's a wonderful guy, but it's
hard to play a guy like that. Newdell had all those colors, he was
unpredictable. Newdell could show up in a dashiki. What do you
dress Mac in? Khakis and a sweater.
   ``Mac's the normal person on the show. He stands back and
observes the others. But he also participates in the craziness. He
can say something that shocks me. He has better control than the
others. I love playing Mac. It takes a lot of discipline. He's
always on the verge. He senses what's going on and can be touched
by it. Newdell would step away, but Mac sees them as part of his
family.''
   ``Night Court'' is a variation on the concept of ``Barney
Miller'' and was created by Reinhold Weege, a former producer of
``Barney Miller.'' The show had a tough shakedown and was not an
immediate hit.
   It has also undergone a lot of cast changes. Anderson,
Larroquette and Moll are the only members of the original cast.
Selma Diamond began as the caustic, wisecracking bailiff, and after
her death from lung cancer in 1985 she was replaced by Florence
Halop. Halop also suffered from lung cancer. She died in 1986 and
was replaced by Warfield.
   Karen Austin was the first court clerk and Paula Kelly was the
first defense attorney.
   ``They're taking Mac in a new direction,'' said Robinson. ``Mac
has always wanted to be an attorney, and they're sending him back
to school.''
   Mac also got married on the show, to an Asian woman named Quon
Lee, played by Denice Kumagai. ``I think a lot of it's based on my
own life,'' he said. ``My wife is from the Philippines.''
   Robinson grew up in Houston, Texas, where he organized a singing
group called the Drells and worked in local theater.
   ``I always wanted to entertain,'' he said. ``When I was 5, I
wanted to be a minister. Then I started singing with various
groups. But after a while I got discouraged. I wasn't thinking
about acting, but I was watching television and saw Bill Cosby and
said, `I bet I can do that.'''
   He studied at a Houston workshop, but felt he wasn't getting
anywhere and quit. ``Chris Wilson, the (workshop) director, called
me and asked me to come back and I never quit again,'' he said.
``She gave me a scholarship. After about five years I moved to Los
Angeles.''
   He also trained with Cecil Pickett, a well-known Houston drama
teacher and father of actress Cindy Pickett. ``He challenged me,''
Robison said. ``When I was young my attitude was that I knew it
all. He would see if I wasn't giving my all. I'd drive home in
tears. Finally, I decided to listen. He was so important to my
career.''
   Robinson worked on such shows as ``Hill Street Blues,'' ``St.
Elsewhere,'' ``Columbo'' and ``Lou Grant.'' He was in ``Roots: The
Next Generation,'' ``Rehearsal for Murder,'' ``Haywire,'' ``The
Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald,'' and such theatrical films as ``Gray
Lady Down,'' ``Apocalypse Now,'' and ``The River.''
   He was in a pilot based on the movie ``The Last Detail'' and
another called ``Temporary Insanity.'' He also starred with Philip
Michael Thomas and John Beck in a pilot called ``The Buffalo
Soldiers,'' about black cavalry in the last century.
