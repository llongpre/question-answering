first quarter.; CHART: (Game Statistics)  </CAPTION>

<TEXT>     The rest is up to the 49ers.;   The Lions did all they could do Sunday,
completing perhaps the most remarkable turnaround in club history with a 17-14
overtime victory against the Buffalo Bills before 78,059 at Rich Stadium.;  
Kicker Eddie Murray, who missed two field-goal attempts in the final seconds
of regulation, booted the game-winning 21-yarder after 4 minutes, 23 seconds
of overtime.;   But the Lions won't know until tonight -- when the 49ers and
Chicago Bears play -- who or when they will play in the playoffs.;   If the
49ers beat the Bears, the Lions will be NFC Central Division champions and
won't play their first playoff game until Jan. 4 or 5.;   If the Bears beat
the 49ers, the Lions will play Dallas next weekend at the Silverdome in a
wild-card game.;   "You know we're going to be glued to somebody's
television," tackle Lomas Brown said gleefully.;   Already, the Lions have
gone farther and accomplished more than anyone expected after their
season-opening 45-0 loss to Washington on Sept. 1.;   Sunday's victory was
their sixth in a row, a club-record 12th of the season -- and it broke the
17-game home winning streak of the defending AFC champion Bills.;   "I'm proud
of this team," Coach Wayne Fontes said. "I'm proud of the effort, I'm proud of
the way they go about winning. And I'm proud of the guy (guard Mike Utley) in
Denver pulling for us.";   Utley, paralyzed since suffering an injury to his
spine against the Los Angeles Rams, gave his teammates the thumbs-up sign Nov.
17 as he was being taken from the field.;   Judging by the tenacity they
showed Sunday, there's no telling how many more thumbs-up celebrations the
Lions might enjoy before calling it a season.;   "In terms of fulfillment of
goals, we're not finished yet; this team is determined to go all the way,"
said linebacker Dennis Gibson, who left the locker room on crutches with a
sprained left knee, suffered in the first quarter.;   The Lions missed a
chance to score early when quarterback Erik Kramer failed to cross the goal
line in three attempts from the 1. His final attempt was called a touchdown by
an official on the field, but reversed by Al Sabato, the instant-replay
official.;   Detroit fell behind on Frank Reich's 7-yard touchdown pass to
Andre Reed in the second quarter.;   Nothing changed until the start of the
fourth quarter, when everybody -- Kramer, running back Barry Sanders and the
Lions receivers -- came alive.;   Sanders -- who gained 108 yards on 26
attempts but lost the NFL rushing title to Emmitt Smith of Dallas -- tied the
game with a 1-yard touchdown run less than 2 1/2 minutes into the final
quarter.;   The Lions made it 14-7 when cornerback Sheldon White intercepted a
pass by Reich and returned it 18 yards for a touchdown.;   Enter the
unexpected. Sanders fumbled with the Lions trying to run out the clock in the
final three minutes.;   Buffalo linebacker Darryl Talley recovered at the
Lions' 20, and Reich tied the game with a touchdown pass to wide receiver
Steve Tasker with 2:33 to play.;   Again the unexpected. After the Lions moved
to the Bills' 22, Murray missed a 39-yard field-goal attempt.;   Given a
second chance because the Bills had 12 men on the field, Murray missed again,
this time from 30 yards.; LIONS 17 BILLS 14; (box) THE HERO: Eddie Murray, who
booted a game-winning 21-yard field goal after 4 minutes, 23 seconds of
overtime.;   (box) THE GOAT: Murray, who missed two field-goal attempts in the
waning moments of regulation time that would have prevented the Lions from
having to play overtime.;   (box) KEY PLAY: Buffalo Coach Marv Levy's decision
not to play Jim Kelly, Thurman Thomas or James Lofton, all of whom were
reported to be nursing injuries.  </TEXT>
