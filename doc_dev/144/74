<LEADPARA>  You take Bo. I'll take Howie.;    The Los Angeles Raiders are consensus
underdogs in today's AFC championship game against the Buffalo Bills, and

House.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "Gordon Forbes (USA Today's football guy) thinks we (stink)," Long said.
"Bill Walsh thinks we're good. It depends on what mastermind you're looking
at. Defense wins games, and if we go to the Super Bowl and we win, I'll think
we have a good defense.";    Long has a broken right thumb, but a defensive
lineman doesn't need a thumb, so he'll play wearing a cast. Meanwhile, Bo
Jackson has a mysterious hip injury and Coach Art Shell says hewon't play
today.;    Jackson hasn't talked all week and Shell said Saturday, "The only
thing I know is that the guy has a limp when he walks and some swelling in the
area of the hip.";    The guy? Would George Seifert dare refer to Joe Montana
as the guy?;    No one is saying much about this, but there's some perception
that Jackson's a little fragile and disinterested in the team game. After he
was hurt while running against Cincinnati last week, he spent the rest of the
game playing catch with his sons on the sideline while his teammates beat the
Bengals. It is not the football way. It is not the Raider way. And while it is
impossible and unfair to measure another man's pain, you can be sure that some
football folks think Jackson is saving himself for baseball while his football
team is on the threshold of a championship.;    Long would not stop watching a
Raiders game if an injury forced him to the sideline. Long bleeds Raiders
black and Saturday, he explained some of the things that are unique about the
Al Davis athletic club.;    "I've been with this organization since I was 20
years old and I'm 31 now," Long said. "This is the greatest organization to
play for, no doubt. Everybody wants to play here. Guys can lie and say what
they want in the papers, but I've been to the Pro Bowl and I've talked to guys
and they want to play here.";    Things weren't as nice during the brief reign
of former Coach Mike Shanahan.;    "I was raised in an organization that did
things a certain way and I wasn't ready for the communist regime that came
in," Long said. "Robot society wasn't in the Raider cards. I was ready to drop
20 pounds and go to work making movies or something. I hated going to work for
about a year and a half. But the minute Art Shell was appointed, I knew the
clock would be turned back.";    Long wore sneakers, jeans, a green shirt and
a U.S. Navy cap. Topics were tossed and Longfired back answers.;    (check)
Buffalo's no-huddle offense: "The no-huddle is the ultimate challenge for the
signal-caller on defense (linebacker Riki Ellison does the job for Los
Angeles). But we've dealt with it before.";    (check) Los Angeles defensive
coordinator Dave Adolph: "It took me a while to get used to Dave. The first
day he came here, he said, 'Men, do you love football?' It kind of throws you
for a loop. He said, 'Do you love to come to work?' Well, IBM is not knocking
on my door. I'd better love it. He's one of those guys who go to work at 4
a.m. He reminds me of my Uncle Billy. If you wanted to assassinate him, it
would be easy. Just be on the highway at 4 a.m. and wait for him to go by.";  
 (check) His Navy cap: "It's not a personal statement. A friend of mine's wife
was over there entertaining the troops. We're here talking about the weather
and this and that. Guys over there are dug in trenches getting shot at with
some bomb I haven't heard of. I have to kind of not watch TV at this point
because it's very distracting to me as an individual. But I'm not a
politician. I'm just a football player.";    (check) Footwear for Rich
Stadium: "Whatever type of shoes Miami was wearing wasn't working. They were
slipping and sliding, and it looked like (Buffalo's) Thurman Thomas had snow
tires on.";    (check) Charges that the Raiders have been spying on the Bills:
"Contrary to what the Bills say, we haven't been in garbage cans trying to
find out. We're much more sophisticated than that. All I'm allowed to tell you
is that we have been kept abreast of the situation.";    (check) Football's
final four: "I believe that these are the best four teams. Our goal is to win
this game and represent the AFC in the manner in which it should be
represented, which hasn't been done recently.";    Take Bo. Take him to spring
training. I'll take Howie and the rest of the Raiders in Buffalo.  </TEXT>
