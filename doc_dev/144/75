<LEADPARA>  It was not 51-3, but it was just as embarrassing for the Los Angeles Raiders,
and equally lousy.;   A 27-14 Raiders lead against the Buffalo Bills late in
the fourth quarter evaporated to a 27-27 tie by the end of regulation Sunday.
And when Scott Norwood booted a 42-yard field goal 2 minutes, 34 seconds into
overtime to give the Bills to a 30-27 victory, all the Raiders could do was
leave the field with their heads down and their hearts pierced, wondering just
what it takes to win against these quick-scoring, no-huddle attacking Bills,
the team that had annihilated them 51-3 in the playoffs last season.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     They know this: It will take a lot more from quarterback Jay Schroeder, who
was a miserable 0 for 4 passing with two killing interceptions after the
half.;   If there was any consolation, it was that the Raiders backed into a
playoff berth despite falling out of first place in the AFC West.;   The
Raiders (9-5) escaped the first interception, which Bills cornerback Nate
Odomes returned 48 yards to set up Norwood's 35-yard field-goal attempt with
15 seconds left in regulation. Norwood missed wide left.;   The second
interception off Schroeder, which Mark Kelso made at the Bills' 38 in the
overtime, set up a drive on which Norwood made good, giving Buffalo (12-2) the
victory and the Raiders a severe headache.;   "This was the toughest day in my
career," said Norwood, in his seventh season with the Bills. The sixth ended
with his failure to kick the winning field goal in the Super Bowl. "In spite
of it all, the game had a happy ending," Norwood said. "The bottom line is, we
won.";   The Bills, who have already clinched the AFC East title, remained in
front in the AFC chase for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.;   A
91-yard kickoff return for a touchdown by Buffalo's Al Edwards prevented the
Raiders from dominating the first half, though they still managed a 20-14
halftime lead.;   Los Angeles scored the game's first 10 points on Jeff
Jaeger's 19-yard field goal and Tim Brown's 78-yard scoring catch.;   Edwards
responded on the ensuing kickoff and made the score 10-7 late in the first
quarter.;   But the Raiders remained in control. They took their 27-14 lead on
a 1-yard run by Marcus Allen in the third quarter, capping a 75-yard drive
highlighted by a 59-yard pass to Mervyn Fernandez.;   Bills quarterback Jim
Kelly, who threw for career highs in attempts (52) and completions (33) and
finished with 347 passing yards, engineered drives of 67 yards in 12 plays and
64 yards in eight plays in the fourth quarter to tie the score.;   "We had the
game won," Schroeder said. "We let them back in it. If you let a good football
team back in it, they're going to win. As the offense, we have to make plays
the whole game. It hurts to lose."; BILLS 30, RAIDERS 27; (box) THE HERO: The
Bills' Scott Norwood kicked the winning field goal in overtime.;   (box) THE
GOAT: Norwood missed three field-goal attempts and a point-after touchdown in
regulation.;   (box) KEY PLAY: Jim Kelly's 31-yard pass to Andre Reed set up
the Bills' winning field goal.  </TEXT>
