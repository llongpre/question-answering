<LEADPARA>  The Denver Broncos would love to gloat about their brilliance, but they
can't.;   Sure, their new running back, Gaston Green, is only 2 yards behind
Buffalo's Thurman Thomas for the AFC rushing lead, but truth is, he was a
throw-in in the off-season trade in which troubled offensive tackle Gerald
Perry went to the Rams.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "I wish I could tell you I knew Gaston Green was a great back, but I
didn't," Denver Coach Dan Reeves said. "When we felt like we needed to move
Gerald . . . we knew what we wanted as far as a draft choice for him, but they
kept throwing Gaston Green at us."; ON THE MOVE; Tampa Bay defensive
end-turned linebacker Keith McCants made another move this week: the team
relocated his dressing cubicle across the locker room and away from big-mouth
teammate Broderick Thomas.;   "I don't think they moved me over here just so I
wouldn't have to listen to Broderick," McCants said, smiling. "I don't think
there's anyplace in this building you could dress without hearing Broderick
bragging. The thing is, he's earned the bragging rights.";   Thomas leads the
Bucs in tackles, sacks, quarterback hurries, tackles for losses, fumbles
forced and fumble recoveries.; WHO'S THE BEST?; Buffalo Bills running back
Thurman Thomas is tired of comparisons between him and Detroit running back
Barry Sanders.;   "People talk about Barry as being the best running back,"
Thomas said. "Then they say that I'm the best all-around. The difference with
me is I catch the ball downfield and block, and I do a lot of other things
that Barry doesn't do," Thomas said.;   Sanders leads the league in rushing
with 640 yards.;   Thomas, injured during Monday's loss to Kansas City, leads
the league with 889 all-purpose yards -- 556 rushing and 333 receiving.  </TEXT>
