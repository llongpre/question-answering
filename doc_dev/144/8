   Frederic Remington, the painter and sculptor
best known for his depiction of the Wild West, deserves recognition
as an American master, say the curators of a traveling exhibit of
his work that opens here today.
   ``Remington has been seen superficially,'' says Michael Edward
Shapiro, chief curator at the St. Louis Art Museum. ``He's been
stereotyped as a cowboy artist when he was a very sophisticated New
Yorker who drew from a lot of sources and created his own style,
which has astonishingly imprinted itself on the conscience of our
country.''
   Shapiro and Peter H. Hassrick, director of the Buffalo Bill
Historical Center in Cody, Wyo., organized ``Frederic Remington:
The Masterworks,'' the first major traveling exhibit of Remington's
work.
   The exhibition consists of 46 paintings and drawings and 20
bronze sculptures Remington created from 1889, when he was 28,
until he died in 1909 at age 48 of complications from appendicitis.
   Among the works are ``A Dash for the Timber,'' an 1889 painting
acknowledged as Remington's first masterpiece, and ``The Bronco
Buster,'' possibly the best-known American bronze sculpture of the
19th century.
   Remington began his art career as an illustrator, with his Wild
West scenes turning up in several popular magazines, including
Harper's Weekly. His work illustrated what Shapiro describes as the
forces of nature and man and the risk of death and danger in the
West in the action and energy of Remington's horses and horsemen.
   He was especially successful at capturing the image of the horse
_ bucking, rearing, lunging, running at breakneck speed. ``There
was never a more vivid depiction of the American horse,'' Shapiro
adds.
   Indeed, Remington once told a drinking companion that if he
could have one thing written on his tombstone, it would be: ``He
knew the horse.''
   His subject was always the horse and its rider _ the
Indian-fighting soldier or the cowboy. But the West of the
homesteader, the farmer and the frontier-ending railroads held no
interest for him.
   ``While the rest of the country spoke of the advance of the
frontier, the `taming of the West,' as a positive force in the
building of American civilization, to Remington the frontier was
receding and, in the end, a tragic loss,'' historian David
McCullough writes in the show's catalog.
   Remington was born Oct. 4, 1861, in Canton, N.Y., the son of a
newspaper proprietor. He grew up in Canton and Ogdensburg, N.Y.,
then enrolled in the School of Fine Arts and joined the football
team at Yale University.
   He dropped out of Yale after a year and a half when his father
died and, at the age of 21, he headed west to make his fortune,
plunking down part of his inheritance on a sheep ranch near
Peabody, Kan.
   The sheep ranch failed, and Remington bought into a Kansas City
saloon, which also failed. His new wife had left him to go back to
New York. Remington headed west again to sketch his way through New
Mexico and Arizona.
   But by 1885, Remington was back in New York, reunited with his
wife and establishing himself as a magazine illustrator. In 1887,
Harper's Weekly carried 39 of his sketches and drawings, and the
next year more than 70.
   Remington's drawings also began to appear in St. Nicholas and
Outing magazines. He was commissioned by Century Illustrated
Magazine to illustrate a series of articles by a young Theodore
Roosevelt. The series later was made into a book titled ``Ranch
Life and the Hunting Trail.''
   Despite his popular success, Remington was never a critical
success, says Shapiro.
   His work was ``just seen as cowboys and Indians,'' he says,
``and there was a belief that cowboys and Indians wasn't serious
subject matter.''
   The exhibit goes next to the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in
Cody, Wyo., the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and closes at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
