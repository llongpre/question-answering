<TEXT>     Four of Kelly's TD passes went to Don Beebe, the third-year receiver who
previously had caught only three touchdown passes. Two of the catches came on
pass routes called at the line.;   "I just call a play and then give
individual patterns if I feel like it," Kelly said. "I'd come up with certain
plays, and I know, from certain things we'd worked on in practice, that I
could call a little sandlot football, telling Beebe different things to run.";
  Buffalo's ad-libbing came against a Pittsburgh defense that was ranked first
in the league last season, when it allowed a league-low nine touchdown passes.
The Bills followed up a franchise-best 582 yards in the opener against Miami
with 537 yards against the Steelers.;   "We're a good defense, and they
destroyed us," said Steelers cornerback David Johnson, who was burned for two
touchdowns.;   Kelly did throw two third-quarter interceptions that Pittsburgh
turned into 10 points, bringing the Steelers within 31-27. And the Buffalo
defense, for the second week in a row, allowed a 100-yard rushing game. Barry
Foster ran for 121 yards and a touchdown.;   But Buffalo's attack was so
relentless -- the Bills scored on seven of their 15 drives -- that the
Steelers never had a chance to catch their breath.;   Beebe, who had career
bests in catches (10) and yards (112), said: "I would hate to play defense
against us.";   After Scott Norwood missed a 50-yard field-goal try on the
Bills' first possession, it was full-speed ahead. The Bills scored on their
next four drives: a 53-yard touchdown pass to James Lofton, a 50-yard field
goal by Norwood and 34- and 14-yard TD catches by Beebe.;   Buffalo led 24-3
in the second quarter. Foster brought it close with his TD run, but a 15-yard
scoring pass to Andre Reed in the third quarter made it 31-10.; BILLS 52,
STEELERS 34; (box) THE HERO: Bills QB Jim Kelly threw a career-high six
touchdown passes.;   (box) THE GOAT: Pick a Steelers defender, any defender.
CB David Johnson will do. He was burned for two TDs.;   (box) KEY PLAY: After
Pittsburgh closed to within 31-27 in the third quarter, Kelly teamed with Don
Beebe on 11- and 4-yard TD passes.  </TEXT>
