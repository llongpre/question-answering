<LEADPARA>  On Dec. 15, when the Buffalo Bills beat the New York Giants 17-13 during the
regular season, they scored their touchdowns with a no-huddle offense.;    Now
that hurry-up attack is a major concern for the Giants as they prepare to play
the Bills Sunday in Super Bowl XXV.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the first game, the confusion caused by the no-huddle attack resulted in
two big plays. Each led to a touchdown.;    On the first play, Jim Kelly and
Thurman Thomas teamed for a 48-yard gain on a pass when Perry Williams of the
Giants let Thomas get by him. On the second play, Kelly hit Andre Reed for a
36-yard completion when Greg Jackson of the Giants missed a tackle.;    That
damage was typical of the havoc the Bills create when they run plays without a
huddle. The idea is to give the defense no time to substitute and to create
uncertainty over which defender has which assignment.;    Giants Coach Bill
Parcells has had his defense work against the no-huddle offense every day this
week. But he said the no-huddle should not be overrated.;    "The no-huddle is
not the problem," Parcells said. "The problem is Jim Kelly and Andre Reed and
Thurman Thomas and James Lofton, the guys who run that offense. We're familiar
with it. But I'm not saying it's not going to be a problem.;    "I think it's
just a two-minute offense. It can be a little unsettling. But the no-huddle
isn't going to win the game. The athletes running it are what wins games.";   
In the past, the Cincinnati Bengals had success with the no-huddle offense.
Then the Bills adapted it and have had success in a different way.;    "It can
be intimidating," said Giants cornerback Everson Walls. "The Bills' no-huddle
is really different from Cincinnati's, because the Bills call the plays at the
line of scrimmage.;    "They are a lot quicker with it, and that puts a lot of
pressure on the defense. You have to recognize the players and their
formations at the same time and adapt your defense from that in a split
second.";    Bill Belichick, the Giants' defensive coordinator, said the
no-huddle offense puts stress on defensive communications.;    "You don't have
time to recognize some things," he said. "It also puts a creative limit on the
things the offense can try to do, but their offense is not complex anyway.";  
 The Giants' defense hopes to play its game and not let the Bills dictate how
it will play.;    "They've taken away the aggressiveness from some defenses,"
inside linebacker Gary Reasons said. "You can't let that happen to you. If we
understand the tempo of the game, we can match up pretty well.";    Outside
linebacker Carl Banks said, "You have to have the defensive signals called
quickly. You have to get the defensive linemen down. Once they stand up
looking for a call, it's all over.";    Nose tackle Erik Howard said,
"Adjustment is a big thing. You hope you know their tendencies. You have to be
able to adjust to the players they have in the game.";    Recognition and
adjustment aside, the major weapon for the defense is communication. Inside
linebacker Pepper Johnson told how the four linebackers (from left to right:
Banks, Reasons, Johnson and Lawrence Taylor) had to know what each one was
doing.;    "The guys on the left side have to communicate what they see to the
guys on the right side," Johnson said.;    "If you see something, you tell
Lawrence or Carl. Lawrence can't raise up and tell Carl. So he tells me, I
tell Gary, and he tells Carl.";    The urgency of communication extends to all
parts of the defense.;    "It's who's on the field, where they line up and who
covers whom," said backup safety Dave Duerson. "Communications is the key, and
because Everson Walls and I are new to the Giants this year, it has forced the
secondary to communicate a lot. So we can handle this.";    Johnie Cooks, a
backup linebacker, said oral messages and hand signals were fine, but not the
ultimate defense.;    "The no-huddle is more of a problem if you let it be
one," he said. "It's only a problem if you fret over it instead of getting
into position.";    Still, everyone seems to agree that it all comes down to
the players involved. Parcells said that, and when his words were relayed to
Ted Marchibroda, the Bills' offensive coordinator agreed.;    "Yes,"
Marchibroda said, "and the Giants have the defensive players to stop it.";
