<LEADPARA>  Eight seasons ago, Marv Levy stood on the Arrowhead Stadium sideline on a
frigid day in a nearly empty stadium, coaching his last game for the Kansas
City Chiefs. A losing record -- accompanied by dwindling attendance during a
strike season -- and a conservative offense was about to do him in.;   
Sunday, Levy stood on the Rich Stadium sideline in front of 80,324 spectators
and watched his Buffalo Bills wrap up a Super Bowl trip with a 51-3 victory
over the Los Angeles Raiders.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     While Levy was distracted by his quarterback -- Jim Kelly -- defensive
stars Bruce Smith and Cornelius Bennett doused him with liquid from a
sports-drink container, ignoring an order never to do so.;    From assistant
coaching jobs in the NFL to head-coaching jobs in Canada, the NFL and USFL,
Levy has just about seen it all. Now, Levy, 62, is one step from the
mountaintop of his profession.;    "I've been in a lot of games in 40 years of
coaching and it's a great thrill, but I keep saying, 'We've got one more river
to cross,' " Levy said.;    "I really don't want to be reflecting on this.
Twenty years after I retire, I'll sit back and reflect."; BILLS' INJURIES:
Smith, a defensive end, and wide receiver Al Edwards were among four Buffalo
players injured Sunday.;    Smith limped off the field during the first half
because of an ankle sprain, but later played, before the Bills began
substituting liberally. Edwards sustained a mild concussion during the first
quarter.;    Two special-teams players went down with ankle injuries: tight
end Butch Rolle and defensive lineman Mark Pike.;    Levy said all expected to
be able to play in the Super Bowl on Sunday.; BILLS FAVORED: Buffalo was
installed by oddsmakers Glantz-Culver as a five-point favorite over New York
for the Super Bowl.; RECORDS: Kelly's passing efficiency of 73.9 was the
highest in AFC championship game history, surpassing Jim Plunkett's 70.9 from
the Raiders' 1983 game with the Seattle Seahawks.;    (check) Raiders
quarterback Jay Schroeder threw five interceptions, tying an AFC/AFL
title-game record held by three others: George Blanda (twice), Dan Pastorini
and Richard Todd.; TIGHTENED SECURITY: Roger Goodell, NFL director of club
administration, said extra security used at Rich Stadium because of the war in
the Persian Gulf went "very well," and that only six arrests were made.;
LEVY'S LONG ROAD TO TOP; Marv Levy, 62, has traveled a rough career path on
the way to the Super Bowl:;    (box) As Cal's coach from 1960-63, Levy
compiled an 8-29-3 mark.;    (box) After five seasons as William &amp; Mary's
coach and five more as coach of the Canadian Football League's Montreal
Alouettes, Levy posted one winning season during his five years as the Kansas
City Chiefs' coach.;    (box) After a 5-13 mark with Chicago of the U.S.
Football League in 1984, Levy posted 2-5 and 7-8 marks in his first two
seasons with Buffalo in '86 and '87.  </TEXT>
