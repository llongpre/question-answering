<LEADPARA>  Although the Buffalo Bills have never been to a Super Bowl, wide receiver
James Lofton has.;    He was at Super Bowl I, a 9-year-old boy who went with
his father to see the Green Bay Packers beat the Kansas City Chiefs.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The thing I remember most," said Lofton, "was that we went to a lot of Los
Angeles Rams games, and we always sat up high, because they had big crowds.
Our tickets at the Super Bowl were high, too, because that's all we could
afford. But there was a lot of room down lower between the 30s, and we moved
down there. I was always thankful that my father took me to the Super Bowl."; 
  His father died last year, but Lofton -- who grew up in L.A., played at
Stanford and then in the NFL for the Packers and Los Angeles Raiders -- is
going back to the Super Bowl with the Bills.;    Ironically, the Bills almost
faced the Packers in that first Super Bowl. But after winning two straight
American Football League championships behind quarterback (now secretary of
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development) Jack Kemp, the Bills
lost that season's AFL championship game at home to the Chiefs.;    Lofton,
34, was cut by the Raiders just before the 1989 season because they had
wideouts Willie Gault, Mervyn Fernandez and Tim Brown.;    "I really can't
knock the decision they made," Lofton said. "I am just thankful that I was
able to come to a football team that had the capability of getting to the
championship game.";    But he has been a key to the Bills' success since he
signed as a free agent for the '89 season.;    This season, his 13th in the
NFL, Lofton led the Bills in average yards per catch with 20.3 and scored four
touchdowns. He is 174 yards from taking second place from now-retired Charlie
Joiner in NFL career receiving yardage.;    But his career as a starting wide
receiver began poorly.;    His senior season at Stanford, 1977, was ex-49ers
Coach Bill Walsh's first at Stanford. It was Walsh who decided Lofton should
start, not only because of his speed but because of his strength.;    "My
first game was against Colorado, and I finished with no catches," Lofton
recalled. "Bill told me, 'Now don't get down. There's going to be a game this
season when you'll catch 10 or 11 passes.' And there was.";    Even though he
has lost some speed, Lofton always has been a deep threat, because he is
willing to run punishing routes over the middle that make him the target of
safeties.;    "We went into the season thinking he was the type of guy we
could use that way," Bills Coach Marv Levy said earlier this season.;   
Against the Raiders in the AFC championship game Sunday, Lofton scored on a
13-yard pattern over the middle and an 8-yarder. It was his second straight
100-yard game in the playoffs, with 113 yards on five catches against L.A. and
seven for 149 yards and a TD against the Miami Dolphins.;    Still, Lofton
ranked third on the Bills this season in number of catches, with 35, behind
wideout Andre Reed's 71 and running back Thurman Thomas' 49. And being as old
as he is, he doesn't expect to be drawing double coverage in the Super Bowl.; 
  Asked if teams seeing tapes of him might reconsider how he's defended, he
said, "No, they won't. They'll just wonder what was wrong with those defensive
backs."  </TEXT>
