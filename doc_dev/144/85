<LEADPARA>  So what if Scott Norwood missed a potential game-winning field goal in the
final seconds of the Super Bowl? The Buffalo Bills professed afterward that
they would stand behind their man, anyway.;    And they were true to their
word.  </LEADPARA>

<HEADLINE>  BILLS: MISS A KICK, GET THE BOOT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>     After all, from what other position could they have booted him out the door
Friday?;    Norwood, 30, was not among the 37 players protected from Plan B
free agency by the Buffalo Bills.;    Kick the kicker when he's down.;    And
Norwood was pretty low Sunday after missing a 47-yard attempt wide right in
the final seconds of a 20-19 loss to the New York Giants in the Super Bowl.;  
 But, hey, he probably shouldn't feel to low. Running back Ottis Anderson, 33,
voted the most valuable player in that game, was left unprotected by the
Giants.;    Anderson wasn't upset, though.;    "You have to understand this is
a business," he said.  </TEXT>
