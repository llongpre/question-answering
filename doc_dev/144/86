<LEADPARA>  With a community's intense anticipation muted by events in the Middle East,
the Buffalo Bills and the Los Angeles Raiders are expected to conduct the kind
of business today that somehow never took place in their American Football
League days.;    The Bills and the Raiders have reached the AFC championship
game and an opportunity to advance to Super Bowl XXV next Sunday in Tampa,
Fla. As the division champions with the two best records in the conference,
the presence of Buffalo and Los Angeles had not been unexpected.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The surprise is that the two franchises, original members of the AFL 30
years ago, have never played a game for these kind of stakes.;    But that
significance, the chance for Buffalo's winter to be warmed by its first Super
Bowl appearance and the chance for the Raiders to appear in a fifth one, was
placed in perspective in a week in which athletes on both teams were asked
about playing their games at a time of crisis.;    "We're worried about the
weather, worried about this, worried about that," Howie Long, the Raiders
defensive end, said Saturday morning. "And there are guys over there dug in
trenches worrying about some kind of bomb I've never heard of.";    One
weekend after Buffalo's playoff victory over Miami took place in snow that
created problems for slipping, uncertain defenders, the weather forecast
presents a scenario that would force players and coaches to adjust to changing
conditions.;    Colder air, which is expected to arrive some time near the
scheduled kickoff, would reduce temperatures from the mid-30s to the upper 20s
and change rain to a mixture of rain and snow and eventually to snow.;    "If
we believe that's an advantage to us, we're doing ourselves a disservice,"
Bills Coach Marv Levy said. "If we think we have a running start, we don't."; 
  Levy took the same approach toward the availability of Bo Jackson, the
Raiders' leading rusher this season, who is not expected to play because of a
hip injury.;    Despite gloomy reports all week, the Raiders seemed to be
clinging to the hope that there could be some help from Jackson, who gained
698 yards, 16 more than Marcus Allen despite carrying the ball 54 fewer
times.;    After Jackson left the game in the victory over Cincinnati last
Sunday, with 77 yards in six carries for an average of 12.8 yards per rush,
Allen finished with a total of 140 yards.;    Although a distrust of the
Raiders has become a perceived requirement for opponents, Jackson's uncertain
status seemed to be more a result of hope than of misinformation.;    "I asked
him yesterday, 'Can we get a quarter out of you?' " Raiders Coach Art Shell
remembered asking Jackson, "He said, 'I'm trying.' ";    The franchises have
combined for 43 playoff games, including appearances in 15 of the 30 AFL or
AFC championship games -- but never against each other.;    Los Angeles, which
missed the playoffs in the four previous seasons, was able to re-establish the
collective individualism in Shell's first full season that the organization
developed in its Oakland days.;    Buffalo, which was troubled by internal
problems last season, benefited from a maturing process that was lacking two
years ago when a personal foul by Derrick Burroughs, a former defensive back,
helped Cincinnati increase a four-point lead to 11 in the conference
championship game.;    But the Bills' organization is not completely removed
from the AFL days, when Al Davis, now the owner of the Raiders, inspired the
suspicions of everyone. Workers reportedly cleaned out garbage cans frequently
this week, to make sure that discarded information would not become
available.;    'It's just amazing," Long responded. "We're so much more
sophisticated than that. To think that we're in garbage cans. But that van
that's parked three miles from their facility with that radar thing on it has
some significance to it."  </TEXT>
