   J.D. Hill, a former wide receiver for
the Buffalo Bills and a vocal critic of drug abuse, was arraigned
on felony cocaine possession charges after being caught in a police
sting operation.
   Hill, 39, was arrested last week in Sacramento in a police sting
that netted 25 others, the district attorney's office said. He
remained in custody Thursday in lieu of $8,000 bail.
   The arrests followed a day-long undercover operation in which
plain-clothes officers observed buying and selling of rock cocaine.
   Sgt. Bob Burns, a police department spokesman, said Hill was
arrested after allegedly purchasing a quantity of the drug. Hill
did not enter a plea at his arraignment Thursday and is scheduled
to return to court July 29.
   Hill, who has been involved in several local anti-drug programs
and youth camps, delivered a 1986 eulogy for Cleveland Browns
defensive back Don Rogers, who died of a drug overdose.
   Hill was a wide receiver for the Buffalo Bills from 1971 to
1975, then went to the Detroit Lions, where he played until his
retirement from the National Football League in 1978. Recently, he
was a reporter for a Christian radio station.
