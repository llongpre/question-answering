<TEXT>  1. Kansas City Chiefs; 2. L.A. Raiders; 3. San Diego Chargers; 4. Denver
Broncos; 5. Seattle Seahawks; Central; 1. Houston Oilers; 2. Pittsburgh
Steelers; 3. Cincinnati Bengals; 4. Cleveland Browns; East; 1. Buffalo Bills;
2. Miami Dolphins; 3. New York Jets; 4. Indianapolis Colts; 5. New England
Patriots; West; Kansas City Chiefs; (box) LAST SEASON: Finished 11-5, second,
losing to Miami 17-16 in playoffs.;   (box) OUTLOOK: A strong defense is led
by LB Derrick Thomas, emerging as perhaps the NFL's best at his position. LB
partner Percy Snow suffered a broken ankle and will be replaced by WLAF player
Tracy Simien. Age has started to erode what has been an outstanding secondary.
While the running game is bullish with Christian Okoye and Barry Word, QB
Steve DeBerg's age (37) makes it questionable whether he can repeat his career
year of 1990. The team had an inability to score when it penetrated the 20 and
relied heavily on K Nick Lowery.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: If anyone in the AFC can
play with Buffalo, it may be the Chiefs, whose pound-it-out offense plays to
the Bills' principal weakness. May win the division; should make the playoffs
and could go all the way.; Los Angeles Raiders; (box) LAST SEASON: 12-4,
first, beat Cincinnati 20-10 and lost to Buffalo 51-3 in playoffs.;   (box)
OUTLOOK: All eyes will be watching the quarterback situation, where neither
Jay Schroeder nor Steve Beuerlein has distinguished himself, hence the
drafting of Southern Cal youngster Todd Marinovich. The running game features
aging workhorses Marcus Allen and ex-49er Roger Craig. WRs Mervyn Fernandez
and Willie Gault provide the team with deep threats. The defense will count on
linemen Howie Long, Greg Townsend and training-camp holdout Scott Davis. A
so-so secondary needs veteran leadership from another ex-49er, Ronnie Lott.;  
(box)  PROGNOSIS: There's enough ability with Craig and Lott adding to the
leadership of Long and others to sneak into the Super Bowl if Buffalo falters.
But questions linger about Schroeder.; San Diego Chargers; (box) LAST SEASON:
6-10, fourth.;   (box) OUTLOOK: General Manager Bobby Beathard is rebuilding a
team that has been over .500 just once since 1982. Holdout RB Marion Butts, WR
Anthony Miller and DLs Leslie O'Neal and Burt Grossman are the cornerstones of
that program. However, QBs Billy Joe Tolliver and John Friesz have yet to
emerge as leaders. Rookie RB Eric Bienemy has looked like a draft steal in
camp. S Stanley Richard, the No. 1 pick, is expected to complement veteran
Gill Byrd in the secondary.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: With Beathard around, this
team should be getting better. But they're in one of the NFL's two best
divisions, which means they could get better without improving their record.;
Denver Broncos; (box) LAST SEASON: 5-11, fifth.;   (box) OUTLOOK: It was a
long fall from three Super Bowl appearances in four years to last in their
division. QB John Elway remains one of the league's most dangerous players. RB
Bobby Humphrey's and S Steve Atwater's holdouts haven't helped, nor has a
riddled offensive line, which is still in need of a replacement for T Gerald
Perry. The wide receiver position has lost some of the luster from the Three
Amigos days.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: Getting back to the top of a tough division
won't be as easy as the slide was to last place. The improvement in the
Chiefs, Raiders and Chargers presents a greater obstacle than the ability of
the Broncos.; Seattle Seahawks; (box) LAST SEASON: 9-7, third.;   (box)
OUTLOOK: RBs Derrick Fenner and John L. Williams fit in well with Coach Chuck
Knox's conservative offense. QB Dave Krieg has been plagued by inconsistency,
so 6-foot-8 Dan McGwire was the team's No. 1 pick. DLs Eric Hayes and Cortez
Kennedy, now in their second years, and S Robert Blackmon lead a young
defense. K Norm Johnson, whose two key misses may have cost the Seahawks a
playoff spot, needs to regain his form.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: Knox is one of
those coaches who almost always has a winning team and often has one in the
playoffs. That will be a difficult task.; CENTRAL; Houston Oilers; (box) LAST
SEASON: 9-7, tied for first, was a wild-card entrant into the playoffs, lost
to Cincinnati 41-14.;   (box) OUTLOOK: Run-and-shoot offense led by QB Warren
Moon and WRs Drew Hill, Ernest Givins and Haywood Jeffires and standout
offensive line are team strengths along with DE Ray Childress and S Bubba
McDowell. The overall defense hasn't complemented Moon's explosiveness. The
team, which has made the playoffs the last four seasons, is only 2-4 in the
postseason during that period.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: This is still a playoff
team, but in its four-year run, it's never gotten into the AFC title game, the
defense is questionable and some of the parts, particularly on the offensive
line, are starting to wear down.; Pittsburgh Steelers; (box) LAST SEASON: 9-7,
three-way tie for first, but missed playoffs by tie-breakers.;   (box)
OUTLOOK: The holdouts of standout CBs Rod Woodson and Delton Hall have impeded
the defense's development. TE Eric Green, a 275-pounder who as a rookie looked
like the prototype for the next decade, unsung RB Merril Hoge, and WR Louis
Lipps are leaders of an inconsistent offense. Incumbent QB Bubby Brister could
be threatened by second-year man Neil O'Donnell, who has looked good in
exhibition games.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: This is probably the best balanced team
in the division, but it lacks the flash of Cincinnati and Houston. It also
falls short of the best teams in the AFC -- the Bills, Chiefs, Raiders and
perhaps the Dolphins.; Cincinnati Bengals; (box) LAST SEASON: 9-7, three-way
tie for first, beat Houston 41-14, lost to Los Angeles Raiders 20-10 in
playoffs.;   (box) OUTLOOK: The hallmark of the team is an explosive offense
led by QB Boomer Esiason, WRs Eddie Brown and Tim McGee, TE Rodney Holman, T
Anthony Munoz and double-threat RB James Brooks. LB James Francis and SS David
Fulcher will try to rejuvenate a porous defense that was particularly weak
against the run.; (box)  PROGNOSIS: Probably will be right back in the
division race with Pittsburgh and Houston, but the defense remains too shaky
to get them beyond a round or two in the playoffs -- if they make it.;
Cleveland Browns; (box) LAST SEASON: 3-13, fourth.;   (box) OUTLOOK: After
three trips in four seasons to the AFC title games, the Browns face an
uncustomary task -- rebounding from a disastrous season. New Coach Bill
Belichick must rebuild just about everywhere. He has brought in stop-gap
veterans such as RB Joe Morris, but will need immediate help from draft picks
such as S Eric Turner and G Ed King. He still has solid veterans in QB Bernie
Kosar and DT Michael Dean Perry.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: Belichick seems to have
instilled discipline and enthusiasm -- the Browns acted as if they had won the
Super Bowl after an exhibition victory over the Giants. But this isn't a
playoff team, even in a mediocre division, as the ascension of Morris
demonstrates.; EAST; Buffalo Bills; (box) LAST SEASON: 13-3, first, beat Miami
44-34 and Los Angeles Raiders 51-3 in playoffs, lost to New York Giants 20-19
in the Super Bowl.;   (box) OUTLOOK: The Bills can be explosive on both sides
of the ball as they demonstrated in the AFC playoffs. QB Jim Kelly has such
tempting targets as WR Andre Reed and RB Thurman Thomas. Impact players on
defense include DL Bruce Smith, LBs Cornelius Bennett and Shane Conlan and CB
Nate Odomes. There is a defensive weakness against the run, but DE Reggie
Rogers, former No. 1 pick of the Lions back after two years in prison, was
brought in, and the team drafted DE Phil Hansen No. 2.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS:
Other than Miami, nobody can approach the Bills in their division, and the
playoffs are almost a sure thing. But it's not inevitable that they'll get
back to the Super Bowl, despite expectations in Buffalo, where an 18-0 season
followed by a Super Bowl loss would be a disappointment.; Miami Dolphins;
(box) LAST SEASON: 12-4, second, beat Kansas City 17-16, lost to Buffalo 44-34
in playoffs.;   (box) OUTLOOK: Bounced back from four non-playoff seasons, but
has shown a weakness against physical teams. Running game improved with the
emergence of RB Sammie Smith and T Richmond Webb, but both have been beset by
injuries. That may open the door for Fresno State rookie RB Aaron Craver. QB
Dan Marino has many targets, including veteran WRs Mark Duper and Mark
Clayton, TE Ferrell Edmunds and rookie WR Randal Hill. DBs Louis Oliver and
Jarvis Williams may not be enough to make up for a weak pass rush.;   (box) 
PROGNOSIS: The Webb and Smith injuries mean the start may be slow, although
Buffalo has injuries, too, on the defensive line.; New York Jets; (box) LAST
SEASON: 6-10, fourth.;   (box) OUTLOOK: The Jets' skillful WRs Al Toon and Rob
Moore and RB Blair Thomas are balanced out by mediocre QB Ken O'Brien. The
defensive line, led by Dennis Byrd, shows some promise but is young and has
not proved itself as a pass-rushing force.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: General
Manager Dick Steinberg has a good track record as a personnel man, but the
weak drafts of the late '80s haven't left much to build upon. Second-year
Coach Bruce Coslet will have to wait a while to get his 10-win season.;
Indianapolis Colts; (box) LAST SEASON: 7-9, third.;   (box) OUTLOOK: QB Jeff
George, who like the team as a whole was up and down last season, should be
one of the league's future quarterback stars. RB Eric Dickerson finally
appears happy and is in camp and in shape from the start. But for those two to
be successful, holes in a porous offensive line must be filled. In front and
behind standout LBs Jeff Herrod and Duane Bickett are problems -- a weak
secondary and a meek pass rush.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: George is a great
building block, and there is some talent around on defense. But Dickerson may
be slowing down, and the Colts remain weak at the crucial owner position.; New
England Patriots; (box) LAST SEASON: 1-15, fifth.;   (box) OUTLOOK: The
Patriots hope to put their well-documented off-the-field troubles behind them.
The problem is, there isn't much on the field to arouse expectations. There
are potentially good young players in DE Ray Agnew and LB Chris Singleton, but
all that new Coach Dick MacPherson has at QB is Tommy Hodson or Hugh Millen.
The cupboard is so bare that first-round picks Pat Harlow (OT) and Leonard
Russell (RB) could start immediately.;   (box)  PROGNOSIS: New General Manager
Sam Jankovich and MacPherson seem to have brought some common sense and
stability to a franchise that has lacked it at the top. After last season's
disaster, anything is an improvement, but that will do little for the Patriots
in the standings.  </TEXT>
