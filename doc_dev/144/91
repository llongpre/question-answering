<LEADPARA>  Five years ago, Buffalo Bills fans called him god. Two years ago, they started
calling him overpaid. Last season, some of his teammates called him
disruptive.;    Now that Jim Kelly has helped put the Bills in Super Bowl XXV
without a headline-grabbing, off-the-field incident, the search for a new
label has begun.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But Kelly, 30, isn't cooperating. From the day the Bills signed him in 1986
through the Bills' 51-3 win over the Los Angeles Raiders in the AFC
championship game Sunday, Kelly has maintained that he hasn't changed.;    He
still enjoys a night on the town and a few beers, he still considers himself a
quarterback with a linebacker's attitude, and he's still not repentant for
anything he's done, such as yelling at a teammate.;    "I haven't changed one
bit," he said this week as the Bills prepared for Sunday's Super Bowl showdown
with the New York Giants at Tampa Stadium. "I've stayed the same. I don't know
what you're talking about. I'm just enjoying playing the game of football.";  
 That might be the change. After struggling with a conservative offense the
past three seasons, the Bills have employed a wide-open, no-huddle attack in
which Kelly calls many of the plays. The calls are subsequently simpler and
more like the ones he used in his more prolific days with the USFL's Houston
Gamblers.;    "The No. 1 difference," said Fred Smerlas, the former Bills nose
tackle who is now with the 49ers, "is that the offensive game plan is
something he can feel comfortable in. It used to be run, run, pass; run, run,
pass. Kelly is really just a rock-head linebacker playing quarterback. It was
too structured for him.;    "In the no-huddle, he can do more of the things
he's so good at. Kelly gets up to the line of scrimmage and sees them in pass
defense and calls for a run. If he sees the secondary playing over to one
side, he can go the other way. If he sees the cornerback walk up, he can call
a bomb. He's allowed to make his adjustments on the field.";    Kelly has done
so with dazzling effectiveness. In his first four seasons with the Bills, he
had thrown nearly as many interceptions as touchdown passes: He averaged 15.8
interceptions and 20.3 touchdowns. In his best season in that category, 1987,
he threw eight more TDs than interceptions. The margin this season? Fifteen,
even though he missed the final two games because of an injury to his left
knee.;    He also compiled a career-high completion percentage of 63.3, so
Smerlas' contention has merit.;    What might not be accurate is any
assumption that Kelly's personality has changed.;    There haven't been any
reported incidents of Kelly's blasting a teammate, but that doesn't mean the
Bills' locker room has turned into a mutual admiration society.;    Smerlas
was with the Bills last season when Kelly sustained a shoulder injury Dec. 9,
1989, against Indianapolis on a sack by Colts defensive end Jon Hand, tackle
Howard Ballard's assignment that day. Kelly's criticism of Ballard in front of
reporters prompted subsequent criticism of Kelly from running back Thurman
Thomas.;    "Bickering Bills" soon became a standard catch-phrase for the
team.;    "It was one remark made by one player when he was hot from one
game," Bills Coach Marv Levy said Friday. "From that came distractions
galore.";    In kill-the-messenger fashion, Levy closed the locker room to
reporters except for after Wednesday practices and games this season. That
doesn't mean the Bills haven't squabbled since then, Smerlas said.;    "That
particular incident was blown out of proportion, but I don't think it's
changed that much in the locker room," said Smerlas, who keeps in touch with
several of his former teammates. "It's the same. It's probably even worse. The
difference is there's no one there to see it.";    And none of the Bills want
to talk about it during Super Bowl week.;    Another difference this season is
that the Bills have been surprisingly successful. Last season's turmoil
lowered expectations, but the Bills finished 13-3. The pressure on the team
was much greater in '89, when the Bills were picked to vie for a Super Bowl
berth and instead went 9-7 before losing in the first round of the playoffs.; 
  "There are a lot of individuals, a lot of egos, on any team," Smerlas said.
"When you're winning, those skirmishes become family squabbles. When you're
losing, they're like nuclear wars.";    And Kelly, not known for being prudent
or demure, was an easy 6-foot-3, 215-pound scapegoat.;    "Heathcliff," Bills
linebacker Darryl Talley said. "That's what I call him. You know Heathcliff,
the cat that does whatever it wants, no matter what anyone says? And if you
tell it what it can't do, it goes out and does it anyway? That's him.";   
That should end the search for now.  </TEXT>
