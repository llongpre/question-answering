   Max Wright is an actor who'd much rather talk
about the thrills and perils of gardening than his starring role in
NBC's ``ALF.''
   ``I'm passionate about gardening,'' said Wright, a favorite
target of the ill-tempered alien in the hit comedy. ``I didn't know
how therapeutic it was until I started. It's ever-changing because
of the seasons.''
   He talked about attacking snails, of keeping insects at bay, of
the dangers of the hot California sun. ``I have to defend my
delphiniums,'' he said. ``You have to pack lilac roots with ice to
give it the cold it needs.''
   After a while, after talking about his garden tour of England,
Wright can be persuaded to talk about other things.
   ``ALF'' tells the story of the cantankerous intergalactic alien
who lands in the Tanners' garage and stays for dinner. Despite his
behavior and freeloading he endears himself to the Tanners. The
show also stars Anne Schedeen as Kate Tanner and Andrea Elson and
Benji Gregory as the children.
   Wright had worked mostly in the theater and films before he got
into television. He was in such movies as ``All That Jazz,''
``Reds,'' ``The Sting II,'' and in the TV movie ``Playing for
Time'' he played the infamous Joseph Mengele, who performed
experiments on humans at Auschwitz. His last show on Broadway was
``Lunch Hour'' with Gilda Radner.
   ``I came out from New York to do a pilot that wasn't picked
up,'' he said. ``I stayed and made some guest appearances on shows,
then was cast in my first series, `Buffalo Bill.' I was the station
manager who was intimidated by Bill. I'd played that kind of role
before. The guy between a rock and a hard place, who's frazzled and
modest and vulnerable.''
   His character in ``ALF'' has some of those qualities. ``He has
to defend the undefendable. He has to smooth over ALF's gaffes. He
gets hauled up in a cage and ALF hits him with a stick. That makes
me laugh. I come prepared with my stock character, ready to forgive
his appalling behavior.''
   The premise of the show calls for Willie to be at once horrified
by ALF's manners and values and attracted to him as a friend.
   ``He's my pal,'' Wright said. ``I care about him. No matter how
outrageous he is I can keep the bond. It's much easier with ALF
than with Buffalo Bill. You can forgive ALF. It was hard to forgive
Buffalo Bill.''
   Wright grew up in Detroit, where he became a music student at
age 4. By the time he was 5 he was playing the piano on television
and at church meetings.
   ``I also began reciting at an early age,'' he said. ``I have a
good memory. I could recite pages and pages of poetry. I did a play
in the third grade. I got the part because I was the only one in
class who would kiss the girl in the play on the lips.''
   His grandfather was Orval Wright, but he's no kin to Orville or
Wilbur Wright, the inventors of the airplane. His father was George
Herman Wright, named after Babe Ruth.
   ``I went to medical school on a musical scholarship,'' he said.
``I was planning to become a doctor. My first semester I came under
the influence of a drama teacher and began doing play after play. I
liked it. I really liked it. I then switched to Wayne State
University to study drama. Next, I went to the National Theatre
School in Montreal.
   ``After that, I launched my career. I did a season in Michigan,
then went to the Arena Stage in Washington. I never worked as a
waiter, I never drove a taxi. I always worked as an actor. I worked
in repertory theater. Television doesn't compare to that. The
theater was tremendously satisfying. It was magic for me. I worked
with people like Meryl Streep. She was brilliant on the stage, but
she couldn't wait to get into movies.
   ``I did seven Broadway shows in five years. I worked hard and
fast. It took me a long time to get out of the habit of rehearsing
days and working nights.''
