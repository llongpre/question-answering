Buffalo didn't need any miracles against the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills, who won their previous three games with improbable fourth-quarter 
comebacks, were cruising by that time Sunday to a 27-10 victory over the 
Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to come from behind even though we played well (in the last three 
games)," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy said. "We knew we had to get off to a good 
start (against New England.)" 
</P>
<P>
Don Smith scored on a one-yard run to give the Bills a 7-0 lead on their first 
possession. Thurman Thomas, who rushed for 136 yards, scored on a three-yard 
run midway through the second quarter and Buffalo (6-1) had a 14-3 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills put the game away by scoring on three consecutive possessions in the 
third quarter to make it 27-3. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots (1-6) have lost their last five games and are off to their worst 
start since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
"It serves no purpose (to discuss the poor start)," New England rookie Coach 
Rod Rust said. "(The Bills) did what they wanted to better than we did what we 
wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in six games, the Bills never trailed. They outgained the 
Patriots, 353 yards to 262. 
</P>
<P>
The memory of last year's 33-24 loss in which a poor Patriots' team scored 20 
points in the last nine minutes at Foxboro spurred the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
"This team was very aware that last year's game slipped away," Levy said. 
"We're not taking anything for granted." 
</P>
<P>
Jason Staurovsky's 32-yard field goal 12 seconds before intermission cut the 
lead to 14-3, but the Patriots didn't score again until they trailed by 24 
points. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking too much of the defense," New England tackle Bruce Armstrong 
said. "We're asking them to stop the other team time and time again and that's 
not fair." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who missed most of a 30-27 victory over the New York Jets last week 
with a right knee injury, returned to the lineup and picked right up where he 
left off. 
</P>
<P>
"Thomas had a very good game," said quarterback Jim Kelly, who completed 14 of 
20 passes for 208 yards and a touchdown. "The offensive line gave me time to 
throw." 
</P>
<P>
Leading, 14-3, the Bills punted on their first possession of the third quarter, 
then scored on two 35-yard field goals by Scott Norwood and a 20-yard pass from 
Kelly to Keith McKeller. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots made it six consecutive games with just one offensive touchdown 
when quarterback Steve Grogan, who missed the previous four games with a neck 
injury, threw a 19-yard scoring pass to Sammy Martin with 3:19 gone in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
For the fourth time in five games, a New England opponent scored on its first 
possession when Kelly led the Bills on a 12-play, 68-yard drive lasting 7:08. 
Kelly completed all five of his passes for 60 yards, with Smith's touchdown 
capping the drive.
