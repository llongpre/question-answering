   Kind-hearted thieves returned first-grader
Margaret Allen's prized Buffalo Bills flag and gave her some goodies
to boot.
   The 6-year-old girl had proudly displayed the deep blue Bills
flag inscribed with the words ``Happy New Year'' under the American
flag outside her family's home just north of Buffalo until last
weekend, when it disappeared.
   Whoever took it left a note in the family's mailbox promising to
return the flag after the Bills-Bengals American Football Conference
Championship game in Cincinnati.
   Margaret watched Sunday's game, which the Bills lost, on
television and thought she spotted the flag in the crowd.
   She waited and waited, but the flag didn't show up.
   After news reports about her loss, the family received a
mysterious phone call Wednesday evening.
   The caller instructed the family to look for the flag near a
telephone junction box outside their home, said Margaret's father,
Peter.
   The family found the flag, a case of beer, a thank-you note, a
bag and a second note that read, ``We waited till now to return the
flag for our own protection (we thought you'd be watching), but we
had all intentions of returning your flag. And this is for
Margaret.''
   Inside the bag, to Margaret's surprise and delight, was a game
program from Cincinnati, a shirt, a hat and several other souvenirs
from the playoff.
   ``I still don't know who took it,'' Allen said, ``but they
certainly have made my little girl happy. She really is kind of
speechless after all that's happened.''
