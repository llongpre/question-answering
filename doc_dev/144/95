</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Once again, the Buffalo Bills have gone ice-cold in December. 
</P>
<P>
Handed two big opportunities Sunday -- Miami's loss to Indianapolis and San 
Francisco's decision to rest quarterback Joe Montana's injured ribs -- the 
Bills bobbled away five second-half turnovers and lost to the 49ers, 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
Roger Craig rushed for 105 yards and the go-ahead touchdown for the 
opportunistic 49ers, who were outgained 301 yards to 283 but turned their 
opponent's misplays into a victory for the second straight week. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Young was unspectacular in place of Montana but still passed for one 
touchdown to Jerry Rice and rushed for another as San Francisco relied on its 
ground game for a change. 
</P>
<P>
"We really wanted to establish the running game," said Rice, who caught just 
three passes as the 49ers ran the ball 43 times. "If we really can balance 
everything out with the running and the passing, we're going to be hard to 
stop." 
</P>
<P>
The game meant little to the 49ers, 13-2 and assured of the home-field 
advantage throughout the NFC playoffs, and everything to the 8-7 Bills, who are 
now in a three-way tie for first place in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
But the difference wasn't apparent as the Bills lost for the fourth time in 
five games and fourth straight on the road. 
</P>
<P>
"All the last few games have been in our grasp," Bills nose tackle Fred Smerlas 
said. "How many teams beat us this year? None -- we beat ourselves. . . . When 
you keep cutting your throat, eventually you run out of blood." 
</P>
<P>
The Bills could have clinched their second straight divisional title with a win 
following Indianapolis' 42-13 rout of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they left here tied with the Colts and Dolphins and pondering another 
late-season slump -- they've hurt their postseason prospects by losing three of 
their last four in each of the last three years -- heading into Saturday's road 
game against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
They still will win the division with a victory, but could miss the playoffs 
with a loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Bills set up a 21-point San Francisco burst in 5:10 of the second half by 
losing the ball in their own territory on three straight possessions. 
</P>
<P>
Beleaguered Bill quarterback Jim Kelly was 26 of 42 for 265 yards, but threw 
three interceptions, two in the second half. He scored Buffalo's only touchdown 
on a one-yard run with 7:49 remaining before Andre Reed's fumble and another 
interception killed any comeback hopes.
