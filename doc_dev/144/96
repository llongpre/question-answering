<LEADPARA>  Bruce Smith doesn't just cause nightmares. He dreams them, too.;    Hours
after he led the Buffalo Bills past Denver 29-28 in September, Smith, a
defensive end, dreamed he still was chasing Broncos quarterback John Elway.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In this, his best season of a turbulent six-year career that has taken him
from No. 1 pick in the 1985 draft to a four-game suspension for violating the
NFL's substance-abuse policy to defensive player of the year, Smith probably
caught Elway, forced a fumble, recovered it and ran for a game-winning
touchdown.;    "Anything Bruce does doesn't surprise us," teammate and close
friend Darryl Talley said. "Everytime you think you've seen his best, he does
something else even better.";    Just ask Smith.;    "I'm not trying to knock
anybody," he said. "There is some phenomenal talent in the NFL. I'm just
saying I've watched a lot of film this season, and nobody does what I do.";   
What he does, simply, is scare the daylights out of opponents. Smith had 19
sacks this season and might have broken the NFL record of 22 if the Bills
really needed him to. He had 101 tackles. He was double-teamed, sometimes
triple-teamed, but he often found a way to make the play.;    "He's an
opposing coach's nightmare," New York Jets offensive-line coach Larry Beightol
said. "I don't really think there's a way to stop him. He's at another
level.";    Which is exactly what Smith has been saying this season. He took
his campaign for NFL most-valuable-player honors to the people, through the
media.;    Before the Bills played New York at Giants Stadium in East
Rutherford, N.J., in December, Smith proclaimed himself the best defensive
player in football, even better than Lawrence Taylor, the Giants linebacker.
He did so to the New York media, a sure way to grab headlines.;    "I think
that, over the last 10 years, he has been the most dominant player in the
league," Smith said of Taylor. "I just think now, I've taken it a notch above
that.;    "I can't take anything away from Lawrence. I've admired him for so
many years. . . . Lawrence grew up about 60 minutes from where I live back in
Norfolk. He's a friend of mine, and I respect him.;    "But right now, it's
time to give credit to the person that really deserves it.";    Smith has
gotten plenty of credit this time. In addition to defensive-player honors, he
was the only defender to get votes for MVP, which was won by 49ers quarterback
Joe Montana. He was voted to his fourth Pro Bowl and easily made All-Pro.;   
Smith said that one reason he hadn't gotten his due was that Buffalo is the
AFC's smallest market.;    "In Buffalo, we only have one newspaper, and
they're against us," he said during the season. "I don't think I've gotten the
recognition I deserve. I don't think it's fair, but it keeps you hungry, I
guess.";    Smith might hunger for a little privacy when the Super Bowl circus
is over. Then again, nah.;    "I can't picture Bruce ever being, uh, shy,"
quarterback Jim Kelly said.;    Smith's self-confidence could have been at an
all-time low entering the season. The 1989 season was a downer for Buffalo,
even though the Bills won the AFC East title. The "Bickering Bills" went 9-7,
their internal strife turned into public spats, and they were classic
underachievers one year after falling to Cincinnati in the AFC final.;    Then
Smith underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last February, and line coach Ted
Cottrell, with whom Smith was close, left for a similar job with the Phoenix
Cardinals.;    The knee, which had bothered him for nearly two seasons,
responded well. And Smith found that Chuck Dickerson, the new line coach after
three years as tight-ends coach, was as easy to work with as Cottrell.;   
Also, several players reportedly at the source of the bickering were no longer
Bills, including Joe Devlin and Ronnie Harmon.;    But Smith rekindled the
ghastly image of discontent in Week 2, when the Bills were routed 30-7 in
Miami. With eight minutes remaining and Buffalo behind by 23 points, Coach
Marv Levy benched most of his offensive starters. Smith was incensed and let
Levy know about it on the sideline.;    After the game, Smith accused the
coaches of giving up. Levy fined him $500 and brushed off the incident.;   
"Bruce is a great competitor, and he felt he had something to say," Levy said.
"He merely said it at the wrong time. It was an isolated thing. There are no
bickering Bills. That's just something made up by the press.";    Smith
agreed, saying it would be forgotten by the next game, against the Jets on a
Monday night. And Smith was correct. The Bills won 30-7 and never looked
back.;    Smith is willing to look back -- he readily talks about the past,
but only as inspiration for the future.;    Most annoying to him, apparently,
is not his four-game league suspension in 1988, but the way the team fell
short in the last two playoffs. The loss to Cincinnati was the most galling,
because "we were one step away, and you don't ever know if you'll get that
chance to take that step again.";    Now he has that chance.  </TEXT>
