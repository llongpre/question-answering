<LEADPARA>  Poor Sally Little can't enjoy the scenery in Hawaii. She has all she can do
here to maintain her balance while trying a chip shot near the 18th green. She
was in the midst of blowing a three-hole lead in a match with Betsy King at an
LPGA event in Princeville -- the Kauai one. Which was probably a lot more
pleasant than working at a cannery in San Jose.; PROCEEDS WILL PAY SOMEBODY'S

<TEXT>  You say $94,500 sounds a little steep for Buffalo Bills playoff and season
tickets?;   Well, then Robert and Diane Ryan will throw in their two-bedroom
townhouse in Fairport, N.Y.;   After several months of trying to sell their
suburban Rochester condominium in a sluggish housing market, the Ryans decided
to sweeten the pot. In an ad that will run in a suburban weekly paper Monday,
the couple offers their 1991 Bills playoff tickets, 1992 season tickets, and a
lifetime option to purchase season tickets -- all for $94,500.;   The offer
includes the couple's condominium as a "free bonus.";   "We found there was
more interest in the Buffalo Bills than in our condominium," Diane Ryan said
Saturday. "There seemed to be quite a few condos on the market. Club level
seats at Bills games, however, are next to impossible to buy."; EITHER WAY,
THEY LOSE THEIR SHIRTS; Whatever shall Merle Harmon's Fanfair, a chain of
stores in New Orleans, do with 478 "Western Division Champions" Saints
T-shirts?;   The Saints, traditional masters of el foldo, are doing it again.
They've fallen from 7-0 to 9-5 and they're in serious jeopardy of missing out
on the playoffs altogether.;   T-shirt sales are sagging, needless to say.
"This week doesn't compare to the days when the Saints were 7-0," said Omar
Mejia, manager of the Fanfair shop stuck with the majority of the T-shirts.;  
"We have them on hold until the Saints win the division."; 'Rod, you are not a
bad guy. But, you are a spoiled brat. The problem is when you get to be 23
years old, you're no longer a spoiled brat. You're a jerk.  ';   -- San
Antonio Spurs owner Red McCombs, to holdout guard Rod Strickland  </TEXT>
