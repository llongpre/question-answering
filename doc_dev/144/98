<LEADPARA>  Even though he was released by them two years ago, Buffalo Bills wide receiver
James Lofton said he has no animosity toward the Los Angeles Raiders, the team
he'll face Sunday in the AFC championship game.;    "There isn't," Lofton
said. "I have some good friends on that team. I look at the receivers who they
kept at the time, (and) if I were making the decision, I'd make the same
decision."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Lofton said the Raiders had decided on Tim Brown and Willie Gault as their
starting receivers at the beginning of the 1989 season and knew Lofton
wouldn't be satisfied in a reserve role.;  ETC.: A church service and prayers
for peace replaced a pep rally for the Bills, as more than 100 people attended
the interfaith service at Buffalo's Episcopal cathedral at the urging of the
Bills and Erie County officials, who canceled the pep rally hours after
fighting began in the Persian Gulf.  </TEXT>
