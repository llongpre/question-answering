<TEXT>     As a director, Lean brought a jeweler's precision to sweeping film epics.
Robert Mitchum, who starred in "Ryan's Daughter," said working for him was
"like trying to build the Taj Mahal with matchsticks.";    Lean's directorial
career began in collaboration with Noel Coward and progressed to acclaimed
adaptations of Charles Dickens' "Great Expectations" and "Oliver Twist.";   
He was best known for the wide-screen spectaculars, which began with "Bridge
on the River Kwai" and included "Doctor Zhivago" and "A Passage to India.";   
In March, he was to have begun filming "Nostromo," a project based on Joseph
Conrad's novel that had been several years in the works. On Jan. 8, his French
producer Serge Silberman said Lean had been taken ill and that he was
undergoing medical tests. Work on the film was suspended.;    "I just love
telling stories," he said in a 1990 interview with the Times of London, the
city where he made his home.;    Born March 25, 1908, in Croydon, south of
London, Lean went to work in 1928 for Gaumont Studios as a number-board boy.
He soon displayed an aptitude for editing and was put in charge of Gaumont
Sound News, for which he also wrote scripts and provided narration.;    Lean
edited Gabriel Pascal's production of George Bernard Shaw's "Pygmalion" in
1938 and Shaw's "Major Barbara" three years later.;    In 1942, his reputation
as a technician led to his being named co-director with Noel Coward of "In
Which We Serve," an award-winning drama of the Royal Navy in World War II.;   
Coward was pleased with the results and gave Lean permission to film any of
his plays. Lean and two others formed a production company that brought
Coward's "This Happy Breed" to the screen in 1944, followed a year later by
"Blithe Spirit" and "Brief Encounter.";    "Great Expectations," released in
1946, won three Academy Awards, plus Lean's first nomination as best
director.;    "The Bridge on the River Kwai" in 1957 was Lean's first great
success. The film won seven Academy Awards, including best director.;   
"Lawrence of Arabia," which made a film star of Peter O'Toole, followed in
1962. It also won seven Oscars, including one for Lean as director.;   
Ironically, this film was cut by others, losing about 20 minutes in the
process, and reappeared in its original form in 1989.;    Though Lean regarded
"Lawrence" as his best film, he had his greatest commercial success in 1965
with "Doctor Zhivago," based on Boris Pasternak's novel. The film won three
Oscars and a best-director nomination for Lean.;    "Ryan's Daughter" in 1970
was a critical disaster and something of a personal disaster as well. Lean did
not make another film for 14 years, though he tried in the mid-1970s to make a
film of the mutiny on the HMS Bounty but couldn't reach agreement on backing.;
   He returned to the screen in 1984 with "A Passage to India," based on E.M.
Forster's novel. Lean and the picture were both nominated for Academy Awards.;
   "Nostromo" was years in preparation, and Lean's style of craftsmanship took
its toll. Screenwriter Christopher Hampton left after a year of work.;    "I
drove poor Christopher Hampton mad," Lean said in an interview with the Sunday
Times of London in 1990.;    "We'd finish a large chunk and I'd say, 'Let's go
back to scene one.' He hated that. But that's me. I understand people not
wanting to go back to scene one, but you've got to if you want to do something
special.";    Lean was knighted in 1984.;    In 1990, he was honored with a
life achievement award from the American Film Institute.;    Married five
times, Lean had a son from his first marriage.;     David Lean's films; The
