Sir David Lean, the 82-year-old director whose films have won 27 Academy 
Awards, is planning to marry for the sixth time, his lawyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Lean will wed 51-year-old interior designer Sandra Cooke before Christmas, said 
attorney Michael Gee. 
</P>
<P>
The couple met five years ago in the frozen-food section of Harrods department 
store, where Cooke went up to Lean and asked when his next film was due, said 
Daily Mail columnist Nigel Dempster. 
</P>
<P>
Lean and Cooke are vacationing in France, Gee said. The director's next film 
project will be an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel "Nostromo." 
</P>
<P>
Lean is the director of such classics as "The Bridge on the River Kwai," 
"Lawrence of Arabia" and "Great Expectations."
