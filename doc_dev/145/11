   Eric Idle, like a knight-errant in comic
armor, has cut a swath from Monty Python's Flying Circus in his
native England to his new series for NBC, ``Nearly Departed.''
   He's also found time recently for a role as Berthold, the
fastest man alive, in ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen'' and as
Passeportout, Phileas Fogg's woman-chasing, wine-bibbing French
valet, in the NBC miniseries ``Around the World in 80 Days.''
   In ``Nearly Departed,'' which makes its debut Monday, April 10,
he and Caroline McWilliams play spirits, only recently departed,
who try to dislodge the new occupants from their home.
   ``It's not polite comedy,'' he says. ``I seriously want those
people out of the house.''
   Idle was concerned with the lack of time available as he filmed
six episodes of ``Nearly Departed.''
   ``It takes twice as much time to do comedy,'' he says. ``They
don't give you enough lead time. The writer was reworking the
current script while he was writing the next week's script. I
didn't do any writing, but I'm allowed to rewrite and punch up. So
I put my bits in.''
   Idle plays an English lecturer at the University of Chicago who
is killed with his wife by falling rock while on vacation. Instead
of heaven or hell, they go back to Chicago to haunt their old home.
   ``Nearly Departed'' is an original series but the concept has
occasionally popped up in such past projects as ``Blythe Spirit''
and ``Topper.''
   ``You get a chance to comment on people right in front of them
and they can't hear you,'' Idle says. ``We haunt Stuart Pankin and
Wendy Schaal and their child, Jay Lambert. Only the grandfather,
Henderson Forsythe, can hear us.
   ``It's necessary to have someone you can communicate with or it
doesn't relate. You can't make the comedy work without that.''
   Idle was in the forefront of British television's ``golden age
of comedy,'' both as a writer and an actor. He did three series
with Monty Python's ensemble of nonsense comedians and edited the
spinoff books and co-wrote and appeared in three Monty Python
movies.
   Idle's role in ``Around the World in 80 Days'' took him to
London, Hong Kong, Bangkok, Yugoslavia and the River Kwai in
Thailand.
   Some railroad scenes were filmed on the River Kwai Railroad, the
infamous line built by Allied prisoners of war in the movie ``The
Bridge Over the River Kwai.''
   ``Every foot of the railroad represents someone who died,'' Idle
says. ``It's beautiful and chilling at the same time.''
   Idle notes that since ``Around the World in 80 Days'' was
written by Jules Verne, a Frenchman, Passeportout receives a more
sympathetic treatment than does the Englishman Fogg.
   ``Verne pictured Fogg as the punctual Englishman who must have
his bath water at a certain temperature,'' Idle says, ``while
Passeportout chases women and drinks wine.''
   ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,'' the new epic fantasy
from Columbia Pictures, was directed by Terry Gilliam, another
alumni of Monty Python. John Neville plays the title role. Robin
Williams plays the king of the moon.
   ``Munchausen was an 18th-century character who used to boast
about his exploits,'' Idle says. ``The tales eventually became
short stories that were favorites with children.
   ``I play an actor who plays Berthold in the play within a play.
I had my head shaved for six months in order to play Berthold. He
has spent 20 years in prison on the moon.''
   Idle describes the movie as an epic fantasy in the mold of ``The
Wizard of Oz'' or a Cecil B. DeMille film.
   He says it's unlikely that the Monty Python team will get back
together, except perhaps for a special on the 20th anniversary.
Members of the ensemble were Gilliam, Idle, John Cleese, Terry
Jones, Michael Palin and Graham Chapman.
