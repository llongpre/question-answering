   With the purchase of Columbia Pictures, Sony
Corp. is acquiring some of the most treasured American films ever
made, from the classic drama ``Lawrence of Arabia'' to the classic
slapstick of ``The Three Stooges.''
   The giant Japanese electronics manufacturer announced the $3.4
billion deal Wednesday, giving it another foothold in the U.S.
entertainment industry.
   Sony bought CBS Records for $2 billion last year while looking
for properties to provide records and movies it hoped consumers
would use with its stereos and videocassette recorders.
   The Columbia deal will give it control of a major production
studio, a film library of 2,700 movies and 23,000 episodes of
television programming in 260 series.
   Columbia was attractive because of its successful stable of
television productions and its two film studios, Columbia Pictures
and Tri-Star.
   Among Sony's new holdings will be 11 films that have won Academy
Awards as Best Picture, including two with themes that were
anti-Japanese. ``From Here to Eternity'' in 1953 climaxed with the
Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor that drew the United States into
World War II. ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, portrayed
inhumane conditions in a Japanese-run prison camp.
   Columbia's other Best Picture winners were: ``It Happened One
Night,'' 1934; ``You Can't Take it With You,'' 1938; ``All the
King's Men,'' 1949; ``On the Waterfront,'' 1954; ``Lawrence of
Arabia,'' 1962; ``A Man For All Seasons,'' 1966; ``Oliver,'' 1968;
``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' 1979; and ``Gandhi,'' 1982.
   Columbia began in 1920 as the C.B.C. Film Sales Co., using the
initials of its founders, brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and Harry
Brandt. The founders changed the name to Columbia Pictures in 1924.
   Harry Cohn led Columbia's rise in a tiny studio on Hollywood's
Poverty Row, and the company's growth accelerated with the 1928
arrival of Frank Capra, who promptly directed seven films.
   Capra's movies of the 1930s _ including ``It Happened One
Night,'' ``Lost Horizon'' and ``You Can't Take it with You'' _
helped establish Columbia as a major studio.
   Cohn and Columbia produced some of the most popular and
sophisticated films of the 1930s and 40s _ ``One Night of Love,''
``The Awful Truth,'' ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan,'' ``The Jolson
Story,'' ``Cover Girl,'' ``All the King's Men.'' Among Columbia's
stars were Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, William Holden, Kim Novak,
Broderick Crawford and Judy Holliday.
   In 1952, Cohn formed a subsidiary, Screen Gems, to produce TV
series. The film division continued to thrive with such hits as
``Born Yesterday,'' ``The Caine Mutiny'' and ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai.''
   Columbia's television arm remains hugely profitable, making $155
million on revenue of $620 million in the company's last fiscal
year, ended Feb. 28.
   The television division has been boosted by newer shows such as
``Who's the Boss?,'' ``227'' and ``Designing Women,'' while
continuing to receive revenue from such older productions as its
more than 200 ``Three Stooges'' shorts. The films, made between
1934 and 1958, are frequently shown on television.
   With Harry Cohn's death in 1958, Columbia became host to
independent producers such as Sam Spiegel (``Lawrence''); Ray Stark
(``Funny Girl,'' ``The Way We Were''); Carl Foreman (``The Guns of
Navarone''); Otto Preminger (``Anatomy of a Murder''); and Stanley
Kramer (``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'').
   Columbia sold its Sunset and Gower studios in the heart of
Hollywood in the late 1960s and moved production to The Burbank
Studios, which it shares with Warner Bros. Inc.
   The Coca-Cola Co. purchased Columbia in 1982.
   Despite the soft-drink empire's attempts to inject its
production and marketing techniques into the movie business, its
film divisions declined. Tri-Star could not produce a solid hit and
Columbia sponsored the disastrous ``Ishtar.''
   In 1987, Coca-Cola combined Columbia and Tri-Star into a new
company, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and retained a 49 percent
interest while distributing part interest to Coca-Cola shareholders.
   During Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia's Loews Theatre
Management Corp. took off. Loews, acquired in 1986, is among the
nation's five biggest theater chains, with more than 800 screens in
220 locations.
   Still, Columbia's motion-picture arm has drifted in recent
years, with projects like ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate Kid
III'' and ``Casualties of War,'' failing to become runaway hits.
