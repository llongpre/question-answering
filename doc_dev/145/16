   Actor Charlton Heston predicts that epic films
like ``Ben Hur'' or ``Lawrence of Arabia'' will soon be as obsolete
as silent movies.
   The movie, ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids' cost more than `Ben Hur,'
so that means they don't makemovies like that,'' Heston said in an
interview this week on the syndicated television show
``Personalities.''
   ``They will never make a `Lawrence of Arabia' again. They will
never make `Bridge on the River Kwai' again, which is too bad,''
Heston said. ``But we got to make those movies and I'm glad we did.
   ``People make fewer films now,'' Heston said.
   Heston, 67, also decried the high price of a movie ticket.
   ``You know, I just found out - because I get into a lot of
movies for free - that they're charging $7 to go to a movie in Los
Angeles now. Now, that's terrible.''
   Heston won an Academy Award for his role as Judah Ben Hur. The
film, about Roman rivalries in Jesus' day, is known for an
11-minute chariot race that Heston has said is the greatest action
sequence ever filmed.

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) - Country entertainers Waylon Jennings and
Willie Nelson are joining forces to develop a club where they can
perform from time to time.
   The club, to be called ``Waylon and Willie's Cafe,'' will be on
the city's Mud Island tourist park which is undergoing renovation
as a companion project to the Great American Pyramid.
   The pyramid, a 32-story, stainless steel structure, is scheduled
to open next summer. Mud Island, a struggling nearby tourist park,
is being refurbished to become ``Festival Island.''
   The island and pyramid, though both owned by local government,
will be run by private companies controlled by businessman Sidney
Shlenker.
   Jennings, in Memphis for a performance Monday night, said the
club he plans with Nelson will have about 200 seats. Jennings said
he and Nelson will perform there several times a year, but he
didn't say exactly how many that meant.
   Mud Island is a three-mile-long sandbar in the Mississippi
River. Most of the island is being developed as residential
property.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Singer Julio Iglesias says he knows his
limitations and that means his world is on a sound stage, not a
movie set.
   Iglesias said he decided not to pursue an acting career because
``I am the worst actor on earth,'' the singer confessed in an
interview to be shown on ``The Joan Rivers Show.''
   ``I did a film 20 years ago and when I saw the film again, I
felt guilty and embarrassed,'' he said.
   ``I need to sing,'' Iglesias told Rivers, but ``I don't need to
spend two hours singing in a movie.''
   Iglesias admits he would ``love to do that - it's such a nice
situation to be an actor,'' but he says, ``I can't make it.''

   CHICAGO (AP) - Patrick Lilley, the actor who played Eddie
Munster in the 1960s television series, ``The Munsters,'' has
pleaded innocent to charges that he robbed his limousine driver
outside a suburban gas station.
   Lilley, 37, of Gardenia, Calif., entered the plea Monday before
DuPage County Circuit Judge Edward Kowal.
   The actor and John P. Sullivan, 32, of Chicago, were in a rented
limousine Nov. 2 when they allegedly robbed the driver of $140,
authorities said.
   Lilley, who used the stage name Butch Patrick in the hit
television series, was in the Chicago area making appearances at
Halloween parties and signing autographs for fans, police said. He
had been to two bars and was on his way to a Naperville hotel when
the robbery occurred.
   Police said no weapons were involved in the robbery.
   Sullivan also has pleaded innocent.
