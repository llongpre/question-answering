   ``The Last Emperor,'' which swept last year's
Academy Awards, won this year's top British film award Sunday night,
while two stars from ``A Fish Called Wanda,'' won top acting awards.
   The Danish movie ``Babette's Feast'' won as best foreign language
film and Louis Malle took top directing honors for ``Au Revoir Les
Enfants.'' Both movies had also been nominated for best film of 1988.
   Sir Alec Guinness, the 74-year-old veteran actor, received the
British Academy of Film and Television Arts' most prestigious award,
becoming a fellow of the academy. It was presented by Oscar-winning
director Sir David Lean instead of fellow director Sir Richard
Attenborough, who was hospitalized Sunday morning for suspected
kidney stones.
   Guinness, who won an Oscar for ``The Bridge on the River Kwai''
in 1957, has been nominated for another Oscar this year for his
supporting role in ``Little Dorrit.'' The Academy Awards will be
presented in Hollywood on March 29.
   Comedian John Cleese was chosen best actor as the reserved
English lawyer who lost his inhibitions to an American woman thief,
played by Jamie Lee Curtis, in ``A Fish Called Wanda.''
   Cleese, accepting the award from actor Dudley Moore in Los
Angeles, said in a closed-circuit TV relay he thought it should have
gone to co-star Kevin Kline, who was also nominated for his role as
a manic jewel thief. Kline is nominated for an Oscar but Cleese is
not.
   Michael Palin, the movie's stuttering animal lover who was forced
to watch his goldfish swallowed and to accidentally cause the deaths
of several dogs, got the best supporting actor award.
   ``It was a marvelous film to work on _ except if you're a fish or
a dog,'' he joked in accepting the award. ``I want to thank John
Cleese who upgraded me from a pet salesman to a pet murderer and all
the doggies who gave their lives.''
   The Michael Balcon award for outstanding British contribution to
cinema went to Charles Crichton, director of ``A Fish Called Wanda''
and more than a score of other films.
   Two of Britain's leading ladies walked off with the best actress
awards, Maggie Smith for her starring role as a spinster piano
teacher in Dublin in ``The Lonely Passion of Judith Hearne'' and
Dame Judi Dench for her supporting role as the pushy mother in ``A
Handful of Dust.'' Both are previous British award winners.
   Ms. Smith skipped the ceremony because of a broken shoulder.
   Bernardo Bertolucci, accepting the best picture award for his
epic film ``The Last Emperor'' about Chinese Emperor Pu Yi, praised
the important British contribution to the movie's technical and
acting success, including actor Peter O'Toole, who lost out in the
best supporting actor competition.
   ``A World Apart'' won for best original screenplay, ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' for best adapted screenplay,
``Empire of the Sun'' for best score, and ``Defense Counsel Sedov,''
a Soviet movie about the righting of injustice, as best short film.
   The main Oscar nominees _ ``Rain Man,'' ``Dangerous Liaisons,''
``Mississippi Burning,'' ``The Accidental Tourist'' and ``Working
Girl'' _ were ineligible for the British awards because they were
not released in Britain during 1988.
   More than 2,300 people packed the grand ballroom at the Grosvenor
House Hotel for the ceremony. Actors Ben Kingsley and Edward Fox and
actresses Shirley Maclaine and Hayley Mills were among the
celebrities who presented awards.
