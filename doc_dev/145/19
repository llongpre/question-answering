   When the next Hollywood blockbuster hits American
movie screens, you may be able to say, ``It's a Sony.''
   Sony Corp. says its $3.4 billion purchase of Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc., which follows its 1987 buyout of CBS Records,
is aimed at getting involved in making ``software'' to use in the
audio-visual equipment it sells.
   But don't worry about Rambo decked out as a samurai next time
around, or Michael Jackson singing in Japanese.
   What Sony wants out of these American companies, say analysts,
is for them to keep doing what they're best at _ turning out the
American-style entertainment that dominates cinema and music
markets worldwide.
   Sony's recent wheeling and dealing involved some of America's
pop icons: Rambo, Bruce Springsteen, and Coca-Cola Co., to name a
few.
   Sony announced Wednesday it is buying the Columbia studios, home
of Rambo. Two years ago it plunked down $2 billion for CBS Records,
which has contracts with stars such as Springsteen and Michael
Jackson.
   Meanwhile, Coca-Cola stands to collect $1.45 billion from
selling its 49 percent share in Columbia to Sony.
   But while a few American pundits have raised concerns that Sony
may use its new media clout for ``propaganda'' purposes, industry
analysts in Tokyo scoff.
   ``I don't think they would be so stupid,'' says Martin
Beresford, a senior analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities.
Propaganda films probably wouldn't be great hits at the box office,
he notes, and censorship would be too dangerous.
   ``Sony is far too sophisticated to consider something as
blatantly inappropriate (as propaganda or censorship) ... they know
that even the merest whiff of that would constitute an enormous
public relations risk.''
   Analysts say Sony has taken a hands-off policy at CBS Records,
leaving the music-making to Americans while providing Japanese
financial backing. So far this formula has made the CBS venture far
more profitable than analysts had expected.
   Sony's last annual report noted with satisfaction that ``a large
number of hit albums'' from CBS contributed to a 37.9 percent
annual increase in overall sales, which hit $16.2 billion in the
year ended March 31. The company's net income, at $549 million, was
up 94.6 percent from the previous year.
   ``As is the case with CBS Records, we would intend to operate
Columbia as a U.S. company with U.S. management,'' Sony President
Norio Ohga said.
   In effect, Sony wants to sell American ``software'' _ what used
to be known as movies and television shows _ in new forms, such as
laser disks and 8mm video tapes.
   Analysts say it's a rational division of labor.
   While Japanese electronics companies are crack manufacturers and
exporters of gee-whiz technology, the Japanese film and music
industries are about as competitive in world markets as American
soy sauce makers.
   U.S. movies, by contrast, are one of America's biggest export
success stories from London to Bangkok to Katmandu. Hollwood is
dream-seller to the world, with entertainment ranking as America's
second largest export, netting $5 billion annually.
   Rambo can be seen (surreptitiously) in even isolationist Burma;
``The Last Emperor,'' also a Columbia film, was shown in China. In
South Korea, American films are so popular that alleged agents of
local filmmakers, fearing competition, released snakes and tear gas
into theaters to discourage people from seeing directly distributed
U.S. films.
   The reception in Tokyo is friendlier. Japanese love American
films as much as Americans love Japanese electronics. America
exports more movies to Japan than to any other single market;
entertainment is one area in which the United States enjoys a
surplus with its economic archrival.
   ``For many Japanese, `movies' means American movies. They don't
think of American films as foreign films,'' says Hidekazu Tanaka,
an official at Columbia Pictures' Tokyo branch.
   Among films shown in Japan last year, 289 were American,
according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Only 102
were Japanese.
   The top four grossing films in Japanese history were ``E.T.,''
``Star Wars,'' ``Jaws,'' and ``Ghostbusters,'' according to
industry statistics.
   ``Ghostbusters,'' a Columbia release, brought in profits of
$17.8 million in 1984. ``Fatal Attraction'' recovered all of its
production costs in Japanese theaters alone.
   Sony is reportedly eager to expand the number of Columbia's
library of more than 2,700 movies available on laser disk and 8mm
video. Classic Columbia films popular in Japan include ``Bridge
over the River Kwai,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' and ``On the
Waterfront.''
