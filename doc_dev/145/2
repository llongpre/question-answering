Omar Sharif, his face caked and glistening with ice crystals, plodding through 
the snow to get to Julie Christie. A black dot wavering in the heated desert 
air, coming closer and growing larger until we see it is actually a man riding 
a camel. A proud Alec Guinness leading his troop of POWs through a Japanese 
compound as they whistle the "Col. Bogey March."

The American Film Institute is going to have some great clips to show at its 
March 8 dinner next year. Sir David Lean, the director of such wide-screen 
epics as "Doctor Zhivago," "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Bridge on the River 
Kwai," has been named by the institute as the 18th recipient of its prestigious 
Life Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
The 81-year-old Englishman, who is still looking ahead to his planned 
adaptation of the Joseph Conrad novel "Nostromo," is the eighth director and 
the first foreigner to be honored by the AFI since it began presenting its 
"living legend" award in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Director John Ford was the AFI's first Life Achievement Award recipient and 
Gregory Peck its most recent. In between, the honor -- presented at a glamorous 
A-list Hollywood dinner that is taped for later network broadcast -- has gone 
to such actors as James Cagney, Lillian Gish, Bette Davis, Fred Astaire, Gene 
Kelly and Barbara Stanwyck, and to directors Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, 
Billy Wilder, William Wyler, John Huston and Frank Capra. 
</P>
<P>
"Lean joins a distinguished group of individuals who have made enormous 
contributions to America's film heritage," said AFI chairman Gene Jankowski in 
announcing the name of the institute's 1990 winner. 
</P>
<P>
Lean, a Quaker who was not allowed to see movies as a child, stepped through 
the looking glass at the age of 19 when he got a job serving tea at an English 
studio and actually had to rise to the job of gofer. He later finagled work as 
an assistant film editor, working on newsreel footage captured during the early 
'30s, and was the credited film editor on the 1938 "Pygmalion." 
</P>
<P>
His began his directing career doing the action sequences for the 1942 war film 
"In Which We Serve," but his first step toward an AFI award came with his 1945 
adaptation of Noel Coward's "Brief Encounter." The film earned the then 
37-year-old Lean the first of six Oscar nominations. 
</P>
<P>
He received his second nomination the following year for "Great Expectations," 
and 10 years later began a streak that included nominations for "The Bridge on 
the River Kwai" (1957), "Lawrence of Arabia" (1962), "Dr. Zhivago" (1965), and 
"A Passage to India" (1984). He won the Oscar for "Kwai" and "Lawrence." 
</P>
<P>
The only film he has done since 1957 that did not earn him an Academy Award 
nomination was the 1970 Irish landscape spectacle "Ryan's Daughter." 
</P>
<P>
Critics are divided on Lean's overall position on the honor roll of film 
directors. Certainly, his epics show the deliberateness of a visual stylist and 
a meticulous storyteller; Lean has managed only 16 movies in 47 years of 
directing. 
</P>
<P>
For Hollywood, he was definitely the right director at the right time. With 
television spawning America's first generation of couch potatoes, the big 
screen had to get a lot bigger, and with "The Bridge on the River Kwai," Lean 
gave audiences plenty to look at while managing to keep the story as big as the 
image. 
</P>
<P>
Lean has not worked as much as he might have liked in the last two decades, 
because of the prohibitive costs of his kind of spectacle. For years, he and 
his writing collaborator, Robert Bolt, were planning an authentic historical 
version of "Mutiny on the Bounty." At one time, it was going to be done as two 
movies, each one costing about $30 million, then as an eight-hour miniseries. 
</P>
<P>
Lean abandoned the project when it was clear no one would put up the money he 
needed to realize his vision. The film was eventually made in 1984 by director 
Roger Donaldson for Orion Pictures under the title "The Bounty."
