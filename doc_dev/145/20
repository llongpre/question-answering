   Sir David Lean, the 82-year-old director whose
films have won 27 Academy Awards, is planning to marry for the
sixth time, his lawyer said Monday.
   Lean will wed 51-year-old interior designer Sandra Cooke before
Christmas, said attorney Michael Gee.
   The couple met five years ago in the frozen-food department of
Harrods department store where Ms. Cooke went up to Lean and asked
when his next film was due, said The Daily Mail's columnist Nigel
Dempster.
   Lean and Ms. Cooke were vacationing in France, Gee said. The
director's next film project will be an adaptation of Joseph
Conrad's novel ``Nostromo.''
   Lean is the director of such classics as ``The Bridge on the
River Kwai,'' ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``Great Expectations.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - NBC newswoman Jane Pauley, who has interviewed
hundreds of celebrities, says she's still waiting to land an
elusive scoop: her husband, Garry Trudeau.
   ``I have thought about asking him,'' said Pauley, ``but a) he
would never do it, and b) I would not ultimately do it. But I know
it's a neat story.''
   Trudeau, the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist, celebrates
Doonesbury's 20th anniversary this month.
   In an interview in the Oct. 8 issue of People magazine, Pauley
said Trudeau believes that ``the more high profile you become, the
more you have to maintain it. And you have to adjust your life for
updates, just to keep everyone aware, which is time consuming.''
   But Pauley said someone should persuade Trudeau to do an
interview.
   ``It's not going to be me, but I'm just going to be really
irritated if it turns up on somebody else's network.''

   Former major leaguer Jim Bouton struck out
Monday with his pitch to the Supreme Court to revive a big-stakes
contract battle over a baseball bubble gum product.
   Bouton lost an appeal to revive a $1 million damage award. The
justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that threw out the
award against a subsidiary of the Wrigley chewing gum company.
   Bouton, a best-selling author and former pitching star, was with
a minor league team in Portland, Ore., in 1977, when he and coach
Rob Nelson came up with the idea that led to Big League Chew,
shredded bubble gum in a pouch.
   The idea was to devise a good-tasting substitute for chewing
tobacco, a macho symbol for many big leaguers.
   The novelty was a bonanza that launched Bouton's business
career. Sales were $18 million in 1981 after Bouton and Nelson
teamed up with Amurol Products Co. of Naperville, Ill., a Wrigley
subsidiary, to market the bubble gum.
   Bouton, who lives in Teaneck, N.J., got into a dispute with
Amurol in 1984 over an advertising campaign for the gum. That led
to a Mailgram the company sent to Bouton agreeing to new contract
terms.
   A federal judge in New York City ruled that Amurol violated the
agreement, and ordered it to pay Bouton and his partner nearly $1
million plus interest.
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May overturned
the award.
   Bouton retired from baseball in 1970 and wrote ``Ball Four,'' a
humorous account of his life in the sport that was on the
best-seller list for months.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - A car dealer has offered Mayor Bill
Boner $75,000 to resign. But Boner was busy in Hawaii, where he
reportedly was marrying an aspiring country singer on Monday.
   ``It is obvious to all of Nashville that Bill Boner is
distracted from his job,'' businessman Lee Beaman said Friday.
``Our city is suffering from the void in leadership.
   ``In order to make it easier for Mayor Boner to resign, I have
offered to pay the $75,000 in salary he would be giving up if he
resigns now.''
   Boner, 45, turned heads in Nashville when he announced his
engagement to Traci Peel, 34, while he was still married to his
third wife.
   Boner's exploits were well chronicled after the Nashville Banner
published an interview with Peel in which she said the mayor's
passion could last seven hours. Bumper stickers quickly appeared
that said: ``Seven hours for Traci, three years for Nashville.''
   Boner spokesman Rick Runyeon said he knew nothing of the offer.

   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - The Rev. Jeb Stuart Magruder, who spent
seven months in prison for his role in the Watergate scandal, is
off for a new pastorship in Kentucky.
   Magruder, 55, has been executive minister at First Community
Church in Marble Cliff since 1984. On Nov. 1, he will take over as
senior pastor of the 600-member First Presbyterian Church in
Lexington, Ky.
   ``Life began for me again when I came here six years ago,''
Magruder told 1,000 worshipers Sunday. ``You gave me back my
identity and you gave me the inspiration to continue in my
ministry.''
   Magruder pleaded guilty in 1973 to conspiracy and perjury
charges stemming from the 1972 break-in at offices of the
Democratic Party at the Watergate Hotel in Washington, D.C.
   He was deputy director of former President Nixon's re-election
committee.

   PEORIA, Ill. (AP) - Scott Heimdal, who was held kidnapped
earlier this year while working in a South American jungle, has
married his Ecuadorian girlfriend and is settling back into a life
``as normal as can be.''
   Heimdal, 27, married Sandra Durango on Saturday. Other than the
groom forgetting his dress shoes on the way to church, the wedding
went off without a hitch. The bride's family traveled to Peoria
from their home in Quito, Ecuador.
   Heimdal was working for a mining company when he was taken
captive April 28 in the jungle along the Colombian-Ecuadoran
border. He was released two months later after his parents bought
his freedom for $60,000, raised in a frantic four-day fund drive.
   ``Life is as normal as it can be, getting married and all,'' he
said. But he was having trouble finding a job.
   ``I'll stay in Peoria if I can,'' said Heimdal, who specializes
in computers. ``With getting married, it's very frustrating not
being able to find work in Peoria.''
