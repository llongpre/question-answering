   When Indiana Jones sought the Temple
of Doom in India, he was really doing it in Sri Lanka. Likewise,
when Tarzan romped through the jungle he was not in Africa but near
the Sri Lankan hill town of Kandy.
   The late filmmaker Sir Carol Reed once referred to Sri Lanka as
``the most natural and complete outdoor set,'' and this island
nation, despite its long war by Tamil militants for a separate
homeland, continues to lure American and British moviemakers.
   The fight by Tamil guerrillas for an independent nation for
their minority people broke out in 1983. The Tamils, who are 18
percent of the island's 16 million people, claim they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese.
   Since 1980, at least seven major films have been produced around
the lush mountains, dense jungles, rivers and waterfalls near
Kandy, barely a three-hour drive into the hills from the capital of
Colombo.
   Villages near Kandy, once the capital of a Buddhist kingdom,
have been villages everywhere from Vietnam to Africa in various
movies.
   ``Sri Lanka has managed to cheat as countries like India,
Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines,'' said Asoka Perera,
managing director of Sri Lanka Film Locations Limited.
   Perera's company helps scout locations for movies, and he said
Sri Lanka's success in drawing filmmakers is due to a lack of red
tape involved in shooting here.
   One of the first major movies made in Sri Lanka was in 1956 when
director David Lean filmed his hit movie ``Bridge on the River
Kwai'' on the island, then known as Ceylon. The film about British
POWs in Burma who are forced to build a bridge for the Japanese
during World War II, won six Academy Awards.
   The movie was set partly here, so when William Holden escaped a
Japanese prison on Burma and made his way through fierce jungle and
across sun-baked seas to a British base on Ceylon, he was really
just around the corner from where he started.
   Paramount's ``The Purple Plain'' with Gregory Peck, also about
the Burma campaign during World War II, and ``Elephant Walk''
starring Elizabeth Taylor in a movie about a Ceylon tea plantation,
were both made in 1954.
   But Sri Lanka lost out as a location for foreign movies from
1970-77 when the pro-socialist government led by the Sri Lankan
Freedom Party viewed anything coming from the West as decadent.
   It was not until 1980 that the trend was reversed when John
Derek's ``Tarzan the Apeman'' was filmed starring his wife, Bo
Derek, and Richard Harris.
   Since then, movies shot in Sri Lanka have included the George
Lucas-Steven Spielberg ``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom'';
``Mountbatten _ the Last Viceroy''; ``Light Over the Water,'' which
was set partly in Australia; ``Further Adventures of Tennessee
Buck,'' in which Sri Lanka masquerades as Africa; and ``Jungle
Heat,'' in which the country plays itself.
   ``Iron Triangle,'' about an American troop operation in Vietnam,
completed production here in February and is to be released later
this year. It stars Beau Bridges and Haing S. Ngor, who won an
Academy Award for supporting actor in Roland Joffe's critically
acclaimed ``The Killing Fields.''
   Jayantha Jayatillaka, of Sri Lanka Film Locations Limited, said
films made here earn the country needed foreign exchange and give a
boost to the tourist industry. Expenditures on filming in Sri Lanka
were reported to be $8 million for ``Indiana Jones,'' $5 million
for ``Tarzan the Apeman'' and $3 million for ``Iron Triangle.
   Sri Lanka's mix of cultures also helps producers find ``extras''
for their projects, thus reducing their costs, Jayatillaka said.
   ``For the making of `Iron Triangle,' Sri Lankans of Chinese
descent and those who were descendants of traders from Malaysia
were recruited to play Vietnamese,'' he said.
   But Sri Lanka's ethnic conflict, born from that same cultural
mix, has blocked filming on some parts of the island, Perera said.
   ``Some of the scenes of `Tarzan the Apeman' were filmed at the
beaches in eastern Trincomalee district in 1980 before the violence
broke out,'' he said. ``Since 1983, we have to stay clear of the
north and east despite the fact there are some beautiful locations
there.''
   But Perera said spectacular scenery and miles of palm-lined
beaches exist elsewhere on the island.
   The island is being considered for a movie about a journalist in
the Philippines during the overthrow of President Ferdinand Marcos.
   The movie's star, Rebecca Gilling of the Australian TV series
``Return to Eden,'' was recently in Colombo with producer Bob
Markowitz. Keeping with the international spirit of moviemaking
here, the production is being handled by an Australian company.
