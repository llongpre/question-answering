   ``Hello dear. You're very handsome. Yes you are,''
Sir Alec Guinness coos through the cage at a rhinoceros.
   ``You've got a sweet face, very pretty ears,'' the elder
statesman of British acting says, as he strolls through Berlin's
central Zoologischen Garten.
   His chat with the animals is almost as engaging as the wonderful
characters he has portrayed on stage and screen during five decades
as one of the world's finest, most chameleon-like talents.
   On this particular day, the Berlin Film Festival was awarding
the 73-year-old Guinness its special ``Ehren Bear'' (honorary bear)
for lifetime achievement in the cinema. The actor, however, elected
to avoid the morning crush of screenings and news conferences for a
romp in the zoo.
   ``I'm not actually that keen on them; I hate to see certain
animals caged up,'' he said.
   ``But I remember this zoo being small and very imaginatively
laid out on the open plan, and I thought it might be amusing to
have a second look.'' He last visited the Zoologischen Garten 14
years ago.
   Images of some of the zoo's reported stock of 10,000 animals
have lingered: ``They used to have white rhinoceroses there that
were charming. And a great sea lion covered in shrapnel wounds _ an
old thing that was like a symbol of Berlin; a splendid, great
creature.''
   This time around, Guinness' observations are as keen as ever,
whether applied to the varieties of zoo-bound species or the
special tributes that have marked his career.
   In 1980, he received a special Academy Award to honor a range of
work encompassing such portrayals as the sinister Fagin in ``Oliver
Twist'' (1948), a comic octet of murder victims in ``Kind Hearts
and Coronets'' (1950), the hard-driving Colonel Nicholson in ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' (1957), the aging mystic Ben Obi-Wan
Kenobi in ``Star Wars'' (1977) and its sequels.
   Last year, he was twice feted in lavish galas _ in April at New
York's Lincoln Center and in May at the Cannes Film Festival.
   The occasion in Berlin may be less tony, but its significance is
no less clear: in the Festival's 38 years, Guinness is only the
second actor to be so honored, following James Stewart in 1982.
   ``I'm afraid when you get rather elderly, these things seem to
come on you rather more than you might wish,'' he says, his brisk
gait belying his years, his nose becoming slightly red in the
seasonal chill.
   A signpost draws his attention: ``I think that way may be the
pheasantry. Do you mind if we go in there?''
   Somewhere between pheasants and finches, the conversation turns
to work. His latest project is ``Little Dorrit,'' the six-hour film
adaptation of Charles Dickens' novel in which he plays William
Dorrit, a long-term inmate of a debtor's prison who finds that
sudden wealth brings sudden freedom.
   Guinness had not performed Dickens since the 1940s, when he both
adapted ``Great Expectations'' for the stage and made his movie
debut as Herbert Pocket in David Lean's 1946 film version. He then
appeared in ``Oliver Twist'' in 1948. He considers ``Little
Dorrit'' to be one of Dickens' two or three greatest novels.
   ``Dickens offers great temptations for actors because you can go
over the top,'' he said.
   Later this year, he'll be seen as Mr. Todd in a movie of Evelyn
Waugh's 1934 novel, ``A Handful of Dust.'' Then there's Lee
Blessing's current Broadway play, ``A Walk in the Woods,'' which
Guinness may do on the London stage. He last trod the West End
boards in Alan Bennett's ``The Old Country'' in 1977-8.
   ``It's a very distinguished piece of writing,'' he says of the
play. But Guinness acknowledges its pitfalls, as well: ``The amount
of learning for a two-hander is horrendous. An actor's great fear
is that he won't have the memory.''
   On that topic, he is emboldened by the recent return to the
stage, after a decade away, of his friend and mentor, Sir John
Gielgud, in the new play ``The Best of Friends.''
   ``Gielgud is 83,'' Guinness says matter-of-factly, ``and he got
through it (the play) very successfully.''
   By now, the sky has clouded over, and rain looks likely.
Guinness has a lunch date for which he mustn't be late, so he
returns to his hotel to find that autograph hunters have arrived.
   ``There they are,'' he says, sounding resigned as the anonymity
of the walk in the zoo gives way to the fans' ever-ready pens and
cameras.
   But before leaving the zoo, he has one last remark about rhinos:
``We're told they have very nice personalities.''
   He takes an inimitable pause. ``But I don't think I'd like to
encounter them intimately.''
