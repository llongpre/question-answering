   Gerald Wallace, younger brother of
former Alabama Gov. George C. Wallace, was fined $100,000 Friday
and given a suspended two-year prison sentence for income tax
evasion.
   He also was placed on five years' probation.
   Wallace, 68, a once influential lawyer who is suffering from
cancer, pleaded guilty in October to two counts of failing to
report $165,195 in federal taxes for 1984 and 1985.
   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina ordered Wallace to pay the first
$20,000 of the fine by the end of March and the rest within five
years, though he doubted Wallace would be able to repay the full
amount.
   ``I have heard you are the most powerful man in Alabama,'' the
judge said. ``I don't know if that is true, but it is a tragedy to
see you before me.''

   Will Steger and five fellow adventurers
who completed a seven-month, 3,800-mile trek across Antarctica on
skis and dogsleds said they had a hair-raising time getting off the
frozen continent.
   Lifeboats carrying the team to a waiting Soviet ship at Mirnyy
on the Indian Ocean coast of Antarctica had to dodge ice floes when
an iceberg split apart Thursday.
   ``The most dangerous part of the expedition was getting here and
getting out,'' Steger said from Mirnyy. ``Thank God we didn't lose
anyone.''
   The six men, 29 sled dogs, two dog handlers and 13 journalists
were loaded by ropes down a steep, icy embankment into the
lifeboats. For the mushers, it was their first time off the ice
since arriving by Soviet airplane at King George Island on the
continent's western tip last July.
   Steger, who is from the Minnesota town of Ely, was a co-leader
of the St. Paul-based expedition.

   Sir David Lean, the 81-year-old
director whose films have won 27 Academy Awards, says his ``Life
Achievement Award'' from the American Film Institute took him by
surprise.
   Lean, director of such classics as ``The Bridge on the River
Kwai'' and ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' said he never thought of himself
``as anything so special.''
   But actors and directors including Anjelica Huston, Martin
Scorsese, Gene Kelly and Gregory Peck were fulsome in their praise
at Thursday night's tribute.
   Lean chuckled through it all. If anybody had told him when he
started in the business that he was going to be a director, he
said, ``I would think they were mad.''
   Previous winners include Peck, Kelly, Jimmy Stewart, John Huston
and Alfred Hitchcock.

   Attorneys for comedian Bill Cosby and his
wife, Camille, pressed a judge for an early start to the bankruptcy
trial of the couple's fired business manager.
   They said they wanted to prevent her from depleting assets
estimated at $10 million.
   Cosby, once called ``the richest man in show business'' by
Forbes Magazine, claims Mary Waller cheated him out of more than
$8.5 million, court records show.
   After heated arguments Thursday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur
Greenwald ordered attorneys to return Tuesday, when he would decide
the trial date.
   The lawyers are arguing whether fraud and embezzlement
allegations brought by the Cosbys merit an early trial.
   The trial will decide whether Ms. Waller can manage her own
assets while she reorganizes under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, or whether her estate should be placed under a
court-appointed trustee.
   Ms. Waller, 46, recently filed for bankruptcy protection after
eight years serving as chief financial officer to the Cosbys.
   She was earning $1 million annually when fired in July,
according to the Cosbys. Cosby says Ms. Waller misspent millions of
the couple's money, buying among other things, a $44,551 Range
Rover automobile and $28,610 in jewelry.
   She denies the allegations.

   A ranch owned by actress Greer Garson would
become a national park under a bill introduced in Congress by three
New Mexico lawmakers.
   Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici and Rep. Bill Richardson
said the bill introduced Thursday would allow the National Park
Service to preserve and interpret the history of the entire Pecos
area near Las Vegas, N.M.
   The planned Pecos National Historical Park would stand on what
is now the 5,865-acre Forked Lightning Ranch owned by Ms. Garson.
It would include the 25-year-old Pecos National Monument, which
includes a village dating from the Pecos Pueblo Indians of 1450,
the lawmakers said.
   ``The many prehistoric and historic resources located on the
Forked Lightning Ranch would add significantly to the Pecos
National Park,'' Richardson said.
   Negotiations were under way for the land, which may be purchased
by a third party and then donated to the federal government, he
said. Under the legislation, land may be bought, exchanged or
donated.
   Ms. Garson recently halted negotiations to sell the land to a
developer after learning of its plans to create a resort.
