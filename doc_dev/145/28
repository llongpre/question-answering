   Twenty-six years after the premiere of ``Lawrence
of Arabia,'' the Oscar-winning epic will be re-released with scenes
that had been cut from the original and a new look and sound created
by a $600,000 restoration.
   The re-edited ``Lawrence'' will be just as its director, David
Lean, intended.
   ```Lawrence of Arabia' was the first film I saw that made me want
to be a moviemaker,'' said director Steven Spielberg, a co-chairman
of the American Film Institute's National Center for Film and Video
Preservation.
   The film institute and Columbia Pictures announced the re-release
on Wednesday.
   The center will receive proceeds from a series of benefits at
which the restored film will premiere: Feb. 4 in New York, Feb. 5 in
Washington and Feb. 12 in Los Angeles.
   The 2{ years of work done on ``Lawrence of Arabia'' were ``the
most expensive, extensive and difficult film restoration ever
attempted,'' said Robert A. Harris, an archivist who conducted the
restoration for the institute.
   ``Lawrence of Arabia'' won Academy Awards for best picture,
director, color cinematography, color art direction, sound, editing
and music, but Lean's original editing plan was not followed in the
rush to get the movie ready in 1962.
   Lean, 80, rerecorded lost parts of the original sound track with
Peter O'Toole, who starred as T.E. Lawrence, and Alec Guinness, who
played King Faisal. New lines were added. Missing ones were redubbed.
   ``All of their voices have mellowed,'' Harris said, ``and so we
had to change the harmonics by using computers.''
   Existing prints of the film were in terrible shape, said Dawn
Steel, president of Columbia Pictures. She and filmmaker Martin
Scorsese are chairmen of the institute's film-preservation fund.
   ``Parts of the film had been cut and lost, and the color was
appalling,'' Steel said. ``But now the film looks brand new. The
color is perfect, and it's the cut that David Lean wanted.''
