<LEADPARA>  ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO, David Lean was bivouacked in a hotel on a remote stretch
of Spanish coast, contemplating his 19th feature film, based on Joseph
Conrad's "Nostromo." Yes, Lean assured me long-distance, it would be a big
film (costing more than $30 million). Yes, it would deal with such favorite
themes as honor and responsibility. And, yes, he was expecting it to be a
"bugger of a nightmare" logistically, just as his Oscar-winning "Lawrence of
Arabia" and "The Bridge on the River Kwai" were.;    For a Steven Spielberg or
a James Ivory or a Bernardo Bertolucci, three of the many directors inspired
by Lean, the challenges would have been daunting but not insurmountable. But
Lean was two weeks shy of 81. How could he possibly handle the strain of
another monster production?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Longevity runs in family;  Lean waved off the question. "Both my mother and
father died after they were 95," replied the warm, clipped voice on the other
end. "That's a help. Also, I've had a wonderful life in movies. I've gone to
an awful lot of places. It keeps you in trim.";    Lean didn't make it quite
as far as his parents.;    The self-described storyteller died Tuesday at his
home in London at age 83. The cause of death was not disclosed, but Stephen
Silverman, a biographer of Lean, said he died of pneumonia.;    Lean had been
hospitalized in Paris in January after being stricken on the set of
"Nostromo." Work on the film had since been suspended.;    But before his
illness, you can bet Lean was happy and busy. A consummate craftsman and a
stickler for detail, he didn't know how to quit dreaming in 24 frames a
second.;    Lean doesn't leave behind a large body of work, but it is
considerable from an artistic standpoint.;    He was born March 25, 1908, in
Croydon, south of London, and got into the movie business in 1928 as a
number-board boy at Gaumont studios. He displayed an aptitude for editing, and
was put in charge of Gaumont Sound News, for which he also wrote scripts and
provided narration.;    After apprenticing as editor (on such classics as
"Pygmalion" and "One of Our Aircraft is Missing"), he made his solo directing
debut in 1944 on the very English, very stiff-upper-lip "This Happy Breed," by
playwright Noel Coward, who would continue to provide source material.;   
Dickens adaptation;  In 1946, Lean oversaw "Great Expectations," arguably the
best of the Dickens adaptations. The opening scenes on the moor, wherein young
Pip falls into league with a scurrilous escaped convict, have been discussed
and written about endlessly as the perfect fusing of studio ambiance,
performance and editing.;    Indeed, many critics argued that Lean was at his
best when working on a smaller scale, on more intimate social satires, such as
"Hobson's Choice" (1954, with Charles Laughton) and "Summertime" (1955, with
Katharine Hepburn).;    Lean disagreed. In his mind he was born to play a
composite of D.W. Griffith, Napoleon and Rommel of the Desert. Lean, in his
mid-40s, found his kindred spirit in British Col. Nicholson, the never-say-die
POW in "River Kwai," which won seven Academy Awards, including those for best
picture, actor (Alec Guinness) and director. Nicholson as played by Guinness
is anything but your typical wartime hero. In the killing heat of the Burmese
jungle, he becomes the victim of his own obsession. The enemy bridge -- a
miracle of Allied engineering -- becomes bigger than the war, or any
discussion of morality.;    Metaphor for Lean's life;  That bridge, you could
argue, became an apt metaphor for Lean's own life -- a life filled with
exhilarating feats and fueled by an obsessive drive for perfection.;    That
mix of bravura and fanaticism found a new face in T.E. Lawrence, played by
Peter O'Toole in Lean's 1962 award-winner "Lawrence of Arabia." Considered
Lean's masterpiece by many, "Lawrence" has become the standard for all
wide-screen epics, a three-hour-plus mix of intimate character detail and
panoramic desert vistas. Lean described it simply as "the story of a man who
failed. . . . They (the critics) said it was lacking in humanity. I think it
may have been ahead of its time.";    The distinctive Lean touch seemed to
atrophy in the '60s as the film maker went on to such visually ambitious but
dramatically overwrought works as "Doctor Zhivago" and "Ryan's Daughter." The
latter, featuring a miscast Robert Mitchum as a cuckolded Irish schoolteacher,
brought the worst reviews of Lean's career.;    Defends 'Zhivago';  "I tried
to make it over-the-top romantically," Lean acknowledged, "but didn't tell the
audience what I was doing. But I don't think they were correct on 'Zhivago.'
If you're going to make a film of a long book, you've got to make changes. . .
. I'm not ashamed of that one at all.";    Sadly, Lean's labor of love was
never made, at least as Lean envisioned it. After years of pre-production work
on a revisionist, two-part "Mutiny on the Bounty," scripted by regular
collaborator Robert Bolt, producer Dino De Laurentiis moved forward without
Lean. A shorter version with Mel Gibson and Anthony Hopkins was released as
"The Bounty" in 1984.;    Lean never got over the humiliation and attacked De
Laurentiis publicly whenever offered a forum.;    "He (De Laurentiis) pulled
the carpet from under me. I think that was the best script Robert and I ever
did. It was heartbreaking to watch it go under.";    Comeback;  In 1984, at
age 76, he made a comeback with a sumptuous adaptation of E.M. Forster's "A
Passage to India." A dramatization of a scandal that rocked colonial India,
the film combined the scope and exacting craftsmanship of the old Lean and
went on to earn 11 Oscar nominations.;    After the Forster adaptation, Lean
plotted his next adventure in film-making, collected a steamer trunk full of
lifetime achievement awards -- including the American Film Institute's -- as
well as a knighthood, and held forth on how the industry was going to hell in
a hand basket.;    "Look at O'Toole in 'Lawrence.' Looks, talent and screen
presence. It's all there. Today, all we have are talking heads. I don't think
that's the way ahead for the cinema. Telling a story with pictures -- that's
movie-making. . . .;    "Whatever you think of 'Lawrence' as a movie, it's a
visual meal.";    And Lean was one of the cinema's great chefs.; FILMOGRAPHY;
