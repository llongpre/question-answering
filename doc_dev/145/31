   Laurence Olivier led a troupe of knights and dames
who had illustrious stage and screen careers, and his special status
was enhanced when he gained the title of baron.
   Olivier, who died Tuesday, was knighted in 1947 and elevated in
1970 to a peerage as Baron Olivier of Brighton. The title gave him a
seat in the House of Lords, which along with the House of Commons
constitutes Britain's Parliament. The only other theatrical peer is
actor and theater founder Bernard Miles.
   The first actor to be knighted was Henry Irving, so honored by
Queen Victoria in 1895. Ellen Terry, his leading lady in a
partnership that dominated the London stage for 25 years, was made a
dame in 1925.
   The honors gave the profession respectability and helped
eliminate the remains of a puritan prejudice against actors.
   Actors have continued to appear on the annual Honors Lists
announced by Buckingham Palace.
   Donald Wolfit, one of this century's great actor-managers, was
knighted in 1957.
   Noel Coward, the actor and playwright of ``Hay Fever'' and
``Blithe Spirit,'' was knighted in 1970 and actor Rex Harrison was
so honored this year.
   Among the other actor-knights no longer living are Ralph
Richardson, the ebullient, eccentric actor who regularly appeared
alongside Olivier and John Gielgud, who was knighted after World War
II.
   Michael Redgrave became patriarch of an acting dynasty whose
scions include Vanessa Redgrave and her daughters, Natasha and Joely
Richardson.
   Sybil Thorndike was made a dame in 1931 in the midst of a long
and illustrious career in Shakespearean roles. Many of her later
roles were played opposite her husband, actor-director Lewis Casson,
who was knighted in 1945.
   Other great dames have included Edith Evans, the peppery comic
actress best known as Lady Bracknell in ``The Importance of Being
Earnest,'' and Gladys Cooper, the fragile star who last appeared on
the New York and London stages in Enid Bagnold's ``The Chalk
Garden'' more than 30 years ago.
   Many actor-knights work regularly despite advancing years.
   The 85-year-old Gielgud won a 1981 Oscar for ``Arthur,'' and was
seen on the West End stage in early 1988 in Hugh Whitemore's ``The
Best of Friends.''
   Peggy Ashcroft, 81, graduated with Olivier in 1925 from London's
Central School of Speech and Drama. She was a mainstay of the London
stage throughout her career, but found international fame after
almost 60 years with her performances in ``A Passage To India'' on
film and ``The Jewel In the Crown'' on television.
   Wendy Hiller at 76 undertook a six-month London run in ``Driving
Miss Daisy,'' Alfred Uhry's Pulitzer Prize-winning play.
   Alec Guinness, known internationally for such classic films as
``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' and ``Tunes of Glory,'' was
knighted in 1959.
   More recently he became known to new audiences as Obi-Wan Kenobi
in 1977's ``Star Wars,'' and as John Le Carre's self-effacing spy
George Smiley on television. Guinness' 1988 starring role in the
American play ``A Walk In the Woods'' was his first London stage
work in 10 years.
   Judi Dench, the latest dame, was honored in 1988 after a string
of critically acclaimed performances. She made her debut as a
director this year, winning praise for her production of
Shakespeare's ``Much Ado About Nothing.''
