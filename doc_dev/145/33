   If the Academy Award race for supporting actor
goes according to form, the winner would be Alec Guinness for
``Little Dorrit.'' Or so the experts say.
   After all, the reasoning goes, for the past three years the award
has gone to veterans who have amassed an impressive body of work:
Don Ameche, ``Cocoon,'' 1985; Michael Caine, ``Hannah and Her
Sisters,'' 1986; Sean Connery, ``The Untouchables,'' 1987.
   The trouble is that Academy Award voters don't always follow
tradition, and some of them may have had trouble sitting through the
six hours of ``Little Dorrit.''
   The British-made film is based on Charles Dickens' last, often
overlooked novel. Guinness, Oscar winner as best actor for ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' in 1957, was cast as William Dorrit,
longtime resident of debtors' prison.
   ``The character itself I found fascinating,'' said the
74-year-old actor in a magazine interview, ``because in many ways
it's unsympathetic, feckless and foolish. You know, you'd like to
kick him. ... And yet, at the same time, there is a sympathy for him
because of the social situation at that time, being chucked into
prison for 20-odd years for debt.''
   But Oscar voters other veterans for whom to vote. First, there's
Martin Landau, nominated for ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream.'' For
30 years he has been contributing solid performances in films such
as ``North by Northwest, ``Cleopatra'' and ``Nevada Smith,'' though
he is best known as the master of disguises in the original TV
series ``Mission: Impossible.''
   Francis Coppola gave Landau the role of his life as Abe Karatz,
financial adviser to car builder Preston Tucker. Of Coppola, Landau,
54, remarks: ``Like all the good ones, he lets you go. He hires you,
that's a vote of confidence. Francis really creates a background for
you. The more you bring the happier he is.''
   Landau is a director of the Actors Studio in Hollywood, and he
prepared for the role with customary thoroughness. Once an
illustrator for the New York Daily News, he drew portraits of Abe
and analyzed him as ``a lonely New York businessman who really has
no family, no friends and no life outside work.''
   Then there's Dean Stockwell, nominated as the outrageous Mafia
don in ``Married to the Mob.'' He's been in films for 46 of his 52
years. The son of singer Harry Stockwell, Dean was a child actor in
such films as ``Anchors Aweigh,'' ``Gentleman's Agreement'' and
``The Boy With the Green Hair.''
   His career since then has been a roller coaster: obscurity after
his child-star days; success as a young man in ``Compulsion,''
``Sons and Lovers'' and other films; descent into hippiedom during
the 1960s. He tried to return to acting after cleaning up his act,
but found jobs scarce. Thinking his career over, he and wife, Joy,
moved to Santa Fe, N.M. Suddenly, producers were sending for him.
   Stockwell credits director Jonathan Demme for taking a chance on
him in ``Married to the Mob.'' He remarked: ``No one had ever
thought of me for this type of role. It's a romantic comedy, and I
play a charismatic guy who chases after women and people are afraid
of, and it's charming and funny. Prior to that, everyone always
thought of me as this serious actor who plays psychotics and
neurotics and sensitive people.''
   Kevin Kline won his nomination as the madcap but vicious
underworld type in ``A Fish Called Wanda.'' Known for his flamboyant
roles in the theater, Kline, 41, has created a series of indelible
performances on the screen: as Meryl Streep's erratic lover in
``Sophie's Choice''; the college reunion host in ``The Big Chill'';
the swashbuckling buccaneer in ``The Pirates of Penzance.''
   The actor believes that his screen potential hasn't been reached:
``I've done tons of roles on the stage that I haven't even
approached on the screen. I see my film career as wide open. I'd
like to do serious dramas, love stories, action-adventures,
comedies. No one has pigeonholed me yet, and I hope to keep it that
way.''
   The youngest nominee is 18-year-old River Phoenix, named for his
``Running on Empty'' role as the son of political activists on the
run from the FBI. Phoenix has established himself as one of the
screen's best young actors in such films as ``Stand by Me,'' ``The
Mosquito Coast'' and ``Little Nikita.''
   As part of a free-thinking family that was repeatedly on the
move, Phoenix had a similar childhood to the one he portrays in
``Running on Empty.'' He believes that his peripatetic upbringing
was good training for acting.
   ``I think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new
situations, new atmospheres, new people, just as you do when you go
from film to film,'' he said. ``It also gives you an insight on
different forms of life and different perspectives.''
