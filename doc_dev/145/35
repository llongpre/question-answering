A capacity crowd braved freezing temperatures here Saturday night to bask in 
the sun-scorched glories of the kind of film making that Hollywood doesn't do 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
The black-tie premiere for the newly restored "Lawrence of Arabia" culminated 
an epic struggle to locate, repair and re-edit footage that began disappearing 
within weeks of the film's initial release, back in December, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of three premieres marking the film's re-release. Sunday's 
Washington premiere was held at the Cineplex Odeon Circle Avalon Theater. And 
the Los Angeles premiere will be held Sunday at the Cineplex Odeon Century 
Plaza, where the film officially opens Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Hacked-away over the years, first so that exhibitors could squeeze in more 
screenings, then so that television could squeeze the movie into a time slot 
(and squeeze its sprawling 70-millimeter images into a TV format), "Lawrence" 
-- winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture -- acquired a kind of 
legend through the years, becoming a cause celebre among film 
historians/lovers. 
</P>
<P>
The thunder of applause that greeted the film's latest adventure would seem to 
signify that the saga of T. E. Lawrence, the unlikely hero who helped to unite 
Arab tribesmen in their battles against the Turks, is once again off and 
riding. 
</P>
<P>
Restored to director Sir David Lean's original cut, the 3-hour, 40-minute 
"Lawrence" mesmerized the crowd that filled the more than 1,200 seats of the 
Art Deco-studded Ziegfeld Theater on West 54th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Adding to the night's excitement: the presence of Lean himself, and his two 
once-unknown stars, Peter O'Toole and Omar Sharif. 
</P>
<P>
Also on hand were Oscar-winning editor Anne V. Coates (who wore a purple, 
rhinestone-studded Middle Eastern caftan "especially for the occasion") and 
Oscar-winning cinematographer Freddie Young. 
</P>
<P>
The night's other VIPs included Robert A. Harris and Jim Painten, producers of 
the restoration; film makers/restoration-preservation advocates Martin Scorsese 
and Steven Spielberg; and Columbia Pictures President Dawn Steel. (It was 
Scorsese and Spielberg who convinced Steel that the studio should back the 
restoration.) 
</P>
<P>
For O'Toole, the night marked the opportunity to "see my old chums again." 
(With understated aplomb, O'Toole said, "This is all awfully nice.") 
</P>
<P>
With a nod to yesterday's epic motion pictures, O'Toole added, "We'd make them 
tomorrow if we could." He smiled at Sharif as he quipped, "Just think -- if we 
did 'Lawrence' again, I could play the Alec Guinness part and he could play 
Tony Quinn's role." 
</P>
<P>
For Sharif, it was his first "Lawrence" screening since 1962. "I can still 
remember that very first premiere in 1962. Then I was so nervous. I had no way 
of knowing how the audience would react. Would they like the picture? Would 
they like me?" 
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I'm seeing an old friend I haven't seen for a long, long time," 
said a jubilant Lean. The seriousness of the night was echoed by Scorsese and 
Spielberg. Said Scorsese: "This is not a film that was made in 1925. It's not a 
movie no one has ever heard of. This film is a legend. It won Oscars. It has 
stars who have become household names. And there are moments from this film 
that people associate with those stars." He sighed: "That a movie like 
'Lawrence' could have deteriorated so quickly. That is truly alarming." 
</P>
<P>
American Film Institute director Jean Firstenberg introduced the "Lawrence" 
participants as they lined up in front of the theater's massive gold curtains. 
"We are in the midst of film history tonight," she exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Underwritten by Columbia, the film's three premieres will benefit the AFI's 
film preservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
"Lawrence" will play only New York, Washington and Los Angeles to begin with. 
The reason: prints are costly (just under $40,000 each) and few modern theaters 
are capable of showing a film of "Lawrence's" wide-screen scope. 
</P>
<P>
Little wonder then that Lean created a stir among the Ziegfeld audience when he 
kicked off the screening by looking at the theater's massive screen, and 
proclaimed: "This is what the movies should be shown on." 
</P>
<P>
That said, the overture began. (The film's stirring score earned Maurice Jarre 
an Academy Award.) So did the applause. It grew thunderous when Lean's name 
appeared. There was applause, too, for the stars' credits -- as well as an 
audible gasp when the words "And introducing Peter O'Toole" appeared. 
</P>
<P>
The "Lawrence" celebration continued later that night, as a crowd of 600 (who 
had paid $250 to $1,000 a ticket) gathered for a dinner in the Grand Ballroom 
of the Pierre Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
There were lots of starry names among the crowd, including Sylvester Stallone, 
Christopher Reeve, Jane Alexander and Donald Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
New York Mets' first baseman Keith Hernandez was there, too -- signing 
autographs and searching for some himself. 
</P>
<P>
Carrying his 1962 souvenir "Lawrence" movie program, Hernandez worked the room 
getting the movie's cast and crew to sign it. "I got it when I first saw the 
film. I was about 9. I never, ever forgot it," said Hernandez. "I couldn't wait 
to see this movie again." 
</P>
<P>
"Lawrencemania" also struck Manhattan Beach attorney Rick Lesser, who came with 
his 5-year-old son, Ricky (who wore a little tux). "I spent $250 a ticket -- 
and Ricky isn't subbing for anyone," Lesser said. "I really wanted him to be a 
part of this night. I still remember the first time I saw 'Lawrence.' It was 
magic." 
</P>
<P>
As for what the movie magic means to the modern studio executive, Dawn Steel 
was upfront: "I'm not about to compare 'Lawrence' with any of our other 
(upcoming) titles. That wouldn't be fair." 
</P>
<P>
Added Steel: "With this movie, you're talking about perfection -- or as close 
to it as you can get. You just don't get better than David Lean."
