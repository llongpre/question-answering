   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. announced
Wednesday it is paying for the right to show 1,000 feature films
owned by Columbia Pictures Television Inc. on its two cable
stations.
   Terms were not disclosed.
   The film library, which includes a variety of movies dating from
1935 to 1983, would be shown on Turner Network Television and
SuperStation WTBS.
   ``This package contains just the right mix of action-oriented
films and popular comedies to support TBS' continued growth in the
1990s,'' said Bob Levi, a TBS executive vice president.
   The library is licensed for a two-year period that begins in
January and is subject to renewal.
   TNT and TBS will share rights to the titles, but company
officials said the majority of the films will air on TNT, Turner's
mostly-movie channel.
   Among the titles in the package are ``Kramer vs. Kramer,''
``Tootsie,'' ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' ``Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington'' and ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.''
   Turner's film library already includes the pre-1986 MGM films,
pre-1950 Warner Brothers films and a number of RKO titles.
