   Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc.'s
$3.4 billion purchase by Japan's Sony Corp. adds another chapter to
the up-and-down history of a scrappy little studio that rose from
Poverty Row to become a major force in Hollywood.
   For Sony, the deal announced Wednesday means another big
foothold in the U.S. entertainment industry for the giant
electronics manufacturer.
   Sony, which bought CBS Records for $2 billion last year, has
been seeking properties that will provide the records and movies it
hopes consumers will use with its stereos and videocassette
recorders.
   Columbia's attractiveness stems from its successful stable of
television productions, as well as the storied studio responsible
for such movies as ``It Happened One Night,'' ``On The Waterfront''
and ``Ghostbusters.''
   Columbia's rise was led by bombastic founder Harry Cohn, dubbed
``White Fang'' by writer Ben Hecht. Commenting on Cohn's
well-attended funeral in 1958, Red Skelton cracked on his
television show: ``It only proves that if you give the people what
they want, they'll turn out for it.''
   Columbia began in 1920 as the C.B.C. Film Sales Co., using the
initials of its founders, brothers Harry and Jack Cohn and Harry
Brandt. The quality of their initial films prompted the movie trade
to call the company Corned Beef and Cabbage; the founders changed
the name to Columbia Pictures in 1924.
   Harry Cohn operated a tiny studio on Hollywood's Poverty Row
alongside other shoestring producers. Columbia's growth accelerated
with the advent of Frank Capra in 1928, during which he directed
seven films. Capra's movies of the 1930s _ including ``It Happened
One Night,'' ``Lost Horizon,'' ``Mr. Deeds Goes to Town'' and ``You
Can't Take it with You,'' _ helped establish Columbia as a major
studio.
   Cohn and Columbia produced some of the most popular and
sophisticated films of the Thirties and Forties _ ``One Night of
Love,'' ``The Awful Truth,'' ``Here Comes Mr. Jordan,'' ``Gilda,''
``The Jolson Story,'' ``Cover Girl,'' ``All the King's Men.'' Among
the Columbia stars were Rita Hayworth, Glenn Ford, William Holden,
Kim Novak, Broderick Crawford and Judy Holliday.
   In 1952, Cohn broke Hollywood's opposition to television and
formed a subsidiary, Screen Gems, to produce TV series. The film
division continued to thrive with such hits as ``Born Yesterday,''
``From Here to Eternity,'' ``On the Waterfront,'' ``The Caine
Mutiny'' and ``The Bridge on the River Kwai.''
   Columbia's television arm remains hugely profitable, making $155
million on revenue of $620 million in the company's last fiscal
year, ended Feb. 28.
   The death of Harry Cohn in 1958 coincided with the end of the
big-studio era. Columbia became host to a number of independent
producers such as Sam Spiegel (``Lawrence of Arabia''), Ray Stark
(``Funny Girl,'' ``The Way We Were''), Carl Foreman (``The Guns of
Navarone''), Otto Preminger (``Anatomy of a Murder''), Stanley
Kramer (``Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'') and Mike Frankovich
(``Cactus Flower'').
   Once located in the heart of Hollywood, Columbia sold its famous
Sunset and Gower studios in the late 1960s and moved production
facilities to The Burbank Studios, which it shares with Warner Bros.
   Columbia's unsteady course continued during the 1970s and in
1982 it was acquired by Coca-Cola Co. The marriage between the
soft-drink empire and the entertainment company worked for a time.
   Thanks largely to ``Ghostbusters'' and ``The Karate Kid,''
Columbia's share of the 1984 box-office receipts was 21 percent.
Another Coca-Cola subsidiary, Tri-Star Pictures, claimed 5.3
percent of domestic theater admissions. Warner Bros. had 23 percent
and Paramount 22.6 percent that year.
   But despite Coca-Cola's attempts to inject its production and
marketing techniques into the movie business, its film divisions
declined. Tri-Star could not produce a solid hit and Columbia
sponsored the disastrous ``Ishtar.''
   Columbia's stability also was undermined by unsteady management.
The studio had a parade of bosses, including David Begelman, who
was deposed in an embezzlement scandal;, Francis (Fay) Vincent, who
now is commissioner of major league baseball; Frank Price and David
Puttnam, producer of ``Chariots of Fire'' and ``The Killing
Fields.''
   After taking over Columbia in late 1986, Puttnam said he
wouldn't follow the Hollywood establishment trend toward bigger
budgets and higher salaries for stars. The stand quickly alienated
powerful producers, directors, actors and talent agents, including
actor Bill Murray, director Norman Jewison, producers Ray Stark and
Martin Ransohoff and the Creative Artists Agency.
   After less than a year, Puttnam he was replaced by movie
producer Dawn Steel.
   In 1987, Coca-Cola combined Columbia and Tri-Star into a new
company, Columbia Pictures Entertainment, and retained a 49 percent
interest while distributing part of its interest to Coca-Cola
shareholders.
   During Coca-Cola's ownership, Columbia's Loews Theatre
Management Corp. took off. Loews, acquired in 1986, is among the
nation's five biggest chains, with more than 800 screens in 220
locations.
   While Columbia's television division, boosted by such shows as
``Who's the Boss?,'' ``227'' and ``Designing Women,'' flourished,
its motion-picture arm drifted. Steel has relied on a variety of
projects like ``Ghostbusters II,'' ``The Karate Kid III'' and
``Casualties of War,'' none of which have been runaway hits.
``Casualties of War'' has been a box-office bomb.
