   Until this week, ``Who's the Boss?'' simply
identified one of the more popular television shows from Columbia
Pictures Entertainment Inc.
   But in the wake of Columbia's agreement to a $3.4 billion cash
buyout by Sony Corp., it is a valid question for one of Hollywood's
biggest film and television production companies.
   Columbia said Wednesday that its president and chief executive,
Victor A. Kaufman, and its chief operating officer, Lew Korman,
intend to resign on completion of the buyout, which the company
expects will be in November.
   Sony executives privately confirmed they were courting movie
producer Peter Guber for a major role at the company.
   Early today, Guber's production company, Guber-Peters
Entertainment Co., announced it agreed to be acquired by Sony USA
for $17.50 a share, or about $200 million.
   Published reports said Guber was being recruited to replace
Kaufman. Guber, who co-produced ``Batman,'' ``Rain Man,'' and
``Flashdance,'' is considered one of Hollywood's top producers.
   But spokesmen for Sony and Columbia each declined comment on
whether Sony's agreement to buy the company meant Guber would take
Kaufman's place.
   Sony issued a statement saying, ``We will not comment on the
terms of the merger agreement which will be made a matter of public
record in due course.''
   Once the management issues are resolved, Sony said, it intends
to place day-to-day operation of Columbia Pictures in the hands of
U.S. management just as it has done with its previous big U.S.
entertainment acquisition, CBS Records.
   The deal for Columbia comes nearly two years after the huge
Japanese video and audio equipment maker bought CBS Records for $2
billion.
   It marks the biggest step of Sony's push into the ``software''
side of the entertainment business that will provide products such
as movies and records to complement its stereos, televisions and
videocassette recorders.
   Christopher Dixon, entertainment industry analyst for the
investment firm Kidder Peabody &amp; Co., called it ``an opportunistic
purchase'' for Sony that will likely look even better a few years
from now.
   He said Sony learned from its experience with CBS Records that
owning a company that produces software can help insure the
popularity of new technological gadgets, such as compact disk
players.
   Owning a film and television production company could come in
handy as Sony introduces new types of playback devices, Dixon said.
It also could give Sony its own sounding board in the professional
community that could help in its development of equipment needed to
produce shows for high-definition TV sets.
   Dixon said the company's experience with CBS Records also may
have taught Sony about the potential of the video market outside
the United States.
   And finally, he said, Sony recognizes that the number of
companies with film and TV libraries the size Columbia's are
shrinking.
   Companies with Hollywood studios, including Warner
Communications Inc., MGM-UA Entertainment Co. and 20th Century Fox,
have been acquired recently.
   Columbia owns more than 2,700 movies, including classics such as
``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``The Bridge on the River Kwai,'' as
well as the more recent ``Ghostbusters'' and ``The Karate Kid.''
   Its 23,000 TV episodes include the prime-time shows ``Designing
Women'' and ``Married ... With Children,'' the syndicated ``Barney
Miller'' and the classic ``Father Knows Best.''
   Sony plans to launch a tender offer of $27 a share for all of
Columbia's stock Tuesday, but already has option agreements for
more than half of Columbia's shares at that price, including the 49
percent held by Coca-Cola Co. and about 3 percent held by the
investment firm Allen &amp; Co. Inc.
   Coca-Cola stands to collect $1.45 billion in gross proceeds from
selling its nearly 54 million Columbia shares to Sony, subject to
approval by Coca-Cola's board. The board meets Monday.
   The Atlanta-based company declined to comment on what it intends
to do with the cash, but analysts speculated that it would invest
in its soft-drink operations overseas and possibly repurchase some
of its stock.
   In trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, Columbia
rose 25 cents a share to closet at $26.50, while Coca-Cola rose 50
cents a share to $64.62{.
   Stephen A. Schwarzman, president and chief executive of The
Blackstone Group, which advised Sony, said Sony had been looking at
various Hollywood companies for more than a year.
   Michael Schulhof, vice chairman of Sony Corp. of America, said
talks with Columbia became serious only in the past week. He said
Sony decided to make a proposal over last weekend and presented it
to Columbia's board Monday.
   Columbia began as a tiny studio in 1920 and grew into a major
Hollywood force, placing fourth with 14 percent of 1989 domestic
box-office revenues through Sept. 4, according to the trade journal
Variety.
   Its owns two film studios, Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star
Pictures, the television production companies Columbia Pictures
Television and Merv Griffin Enterprises, and operates 820 motion
picture screens in 220 locations.
