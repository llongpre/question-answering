<HEAD>Bridge Over River Thames Closed After Tugboat Rams It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tugboat towing two barges rammed the center of a
bridge over the River Thames, forcing authorities to close it to
traffic, police reported.
   The Battersea Road bridge that was struck late Thursday is a main
thoroughfare and its closure threatens traffic disruption in the
already badly congested capital during the morning rush hour.
   A Scotland Yard spokeswoman said the bridge would be inspected
today during low tide to assess the damage and decide whether it
could reopen.
   ``The tug Touchstone was negotiating the river with two barges
when it struck the northeast corner of the center arch,'' said the
spokeswoman, who in accordance with British practice declined to be
named.
   ``Traffic diversions will be in place but it is going to cause
some congestion,'' she added.
   She said it was not immediately clear how much damage was caused
but said no one was hurt.
