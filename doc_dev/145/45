   Actor Omar Sharif felt a bit old when he
joined fellow ``Lawrence of Arabia'' star Anthony Quinn and director
Sir David Lean for the local premiere of the restored 1962 Oscar
winner.
   Sharif watched himself ride across desert sands in his role as
Sherif Ali in the restored three-hour, 40-minute director's cut of
the movie, which won seven Academy Awards.
   ``It's like a veterans' reunion _ everyone's limping along and
has pot bellies,'' Sharif said after the screening Sunday night.
   ``I feel very nostalgic because I haven't seen it for 27 years,''
he said. ``It's like re-seeing your youth.''
   The ``Lawrence'' premiere followed similar galas a week ago in
New York and Washington. The screenings and banquets benefited The
American Film Institute and its campaign to restore and preserve
classic films.
   Lean, 80, urged Hollywood to take risks to make quality films.
   ``Spend some money on risky subjects,'' Lean said. ``It's no good
being safe in this business. We've all got to be gamblers.''
   Lean called the late Sam Spiegel, who produced ``Lawrence,''
``one of the last of the great gamblers that have disappeared,'' but
also criticized him for chopping the film.
   Lean's original version was cut by nearly 30 minutes shortly
after the film's release. Lean contends Spiegel made the first cuts
behind his back, but others have questioned Lean's version. An
additional 15 minutes was removed when ``Lawrence'' was reissued in
1971.
   Peter O'Toole, who portrayed T.E. Lawrence, didn't attend the Los
Angeles premiere. But the screening drew composer Maurice Jarre,
film editor Anne Coates and cinematographer Fred A. Young. All
three, along with Lean, won Oscars for the film, which won as best
picture of 1962.
