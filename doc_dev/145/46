David Lean, the recipient of this year's American Film Institute Lifetime 
Achievement Award, is the world's leading exemplar of the epic film maker. At 
82, he's preparing to direct an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's great, mad novel 
"Nostromo," and already the project is being talked about not only as Lean's 
Last Stand but, also, as the last great outpost of the epic adventure film. The 
lionization of Lean is both a tribute to the grandeur of his best work, like 
"Lawrence of Arabia," and a recognition that such grandeur has mostly vanished 
from the screen. 
</P>
<P>
As it happens, a Lean-like movie recently opened, Bob Rafelson's "Mountains of 
the Moon," about Sir Richard Burton and the quest for the source of the Nile. 
It's an epic, all right, but a dull one. Still, those of us who love 
grand-scale spectacle may be willing to indulge the film for old time's sake. 
The form inspires, even if the movie doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
Epic adventure movies have never been in large supply but, until the last 
several decades, they were a dependably tried-and-true staple. Films like "King 
Solomon's Mines," both the 1937 and 1950 versions, or the 1939 "Stanley and 
Livingstone" -- to name a few of my faves -- delivered uncomplicated 
storylines, stalwart heroes and lots of fervid junglescapes. As 
racial-historical tracts, they never rose much above the Call-Me-Bwana level, 
but that didn't seem to matter much. Except as fantasies, nobody took these 
films seriously anyway. They were the product of eras which could easily 
accommodate their Victorianized boys'-book reactionaryism. Heroism was defined 
as action, and action was most often expressed as the use of force. 
</P>
<P>
But all that was a while ago. In cultural terms, the comparatively "politically 
aware" eras that followed exposed the Great White Hunter trappings of these 
films and made their continuation in the same form untenable. The ways in which 
the white hunters were championed and the natives devalued was perceived as a 
noxious simplification -- an evasion of the true nature of colonialism. 
</P>
<P>
There are other reasons for the demise of the epic adventure film. For one, 
costs have become prohibitive, at least in theory. ("Mountains of the Moon" was 
financed for a relatively measly $18 million; Bertolucci's "The Last Emperor" 
cost around $23 million.) Studios are still quite capable of coughing up kingly 
fortunes to finance their movies, but they tend to put their bucks into star 
salaries and hardware. Making a movie involving oodles of extras and far-off 
locations, with period sets and costumes, is not the sort of expedition that 
Hollywood's Great White Studio Heads are particularly willing to endure. 
</P>
<P>
Movies of exploration are also regarded as antiquated in the modern era. What 
is there left to discover? Territorial exploration has moved beyond earthly 
borders. Outer space is the new uncharted jungle -- just substitute hostile 
aliens (usually "dark") for hostile natives. In such a play-act universe, 
heroes and villains can act out the same old reactionary scenarios without 
rankling any real-world political sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
The never-never-land settings also make it possible to portray, often 
tongue-in-cheek, the kind of straight-arrow, unambiguous heroes who can no 
longer be comfortably depicted in American movies in the post-Vietnam phase. 
Vietnam altered the portrayal of heroism in American movies by calling into 
question the country's motivations for foreign expeditions. 
</P>
<P>
The image of the American as the square-jawed avenger of injustice was turned 
on its head; in counterculture terms, what once was regarded as heroism was 
converted into a species of villainy. The use of force carried tragic 
consequences. The new hero who emerged from this smoking debris turned out to 
be the man who valued his ability to run away from danger. He wasn't John 
Wayne. He was Woody Allen and Richard Pryor. This has changed somewhat. 
Currently, the new product line of American movie hero is the one who voyages 
inward. Victories are not territorial but emotional, and small-scale -- they're 
about learning how to read, how to love again. 
</P>
<P>
Within the past few decades, the adventure epic, when it hasn't transferred to 
outer space, has been almost exclusively spoofy. From the "Indiana Jones" cycle 
on down to "Romancing the Stone" and "Sheena, Queen of the Jungle," these epics 
buy off their antique ooga-booga ideologies by turning the whole expeditionary 
enterprise into a joke. They bring to the fore the absurdities that were always 
lurking just below the stalwart surface of the genre. It's understandable that 
a director like Steven Spielberg, who by his own admission was in strong 
measure formed as a film maker watching such movies as "Lawrence of Arabia," 
would feel drawn to the epic form; or that, given his essentially 
kicky-adolescent world view, he would instinctively lampoon the form as a way 
of making it his own. But even the best of these adventure spoofs are somewhat 
disappointing -- weightless. There isn't much that's awesome in the movies 
anymore, and so it's disconcerting to see awe-inspiring feats in majestic 
landscapes reduced to rinky-dink high jinks. 
</P>
<P>
When epic adventures aren't being spoofy, they are often being revisionist. In 
movies like "Greystoke" and "The Mission," the form is used as an ideological 
chalkboard. The pure pleasures of epic panorama are subverted to the "message," 
which is often bulky and overweening: the Nature of Man, the Nature of 
Imperialism, and so on. There's nothing illicit about using a king-size canvas 
to push a personal agenda -- D.W. Griffith did it -- but too many of the 
agendas are as bloated as their movie's budgets. Movies are an inadequate 
medium for conveying complex sociopolitical arguments; they're much better at 
sensation and immediacy, and the epic form only tends to emphasize the 
inadequacy. 
</P>
<P>
The demise of the epic-adventure film is, of course, all-of-a-piece with the 
demise of the epic film in general. The epic survives in its purest form not on 
the big screen but on the small, as miniseries. Films with subjects of epic 
historical scope like, say, "Roots" or "The Thorn Birds" or "Lonesome Dove," 
are now almost strictly the province of television. 
</P>
<P>
It's ironic that the movie business, which reacted to the threat of television 
in the '50s by scaling things big and high and wide, should now have turned 
tail and relinquished the epic to the airwaves. An entire generation of young 
viewers has grown up with a distorted idea of the epic film, because the epics 
they watch are all housed in a small box, where most of the qualities that made 
them worth watching are eliminated. Many of the movie theaters in the 
multiplexes are small boxes too. Is it any wonder film makers are so reluctant 
to embark on epic projects? 
</P>
<P>
It may only be a matter of time before television also disposes of the epic 
form. The disappointing ratings for a humongous series like "War and 
Remembrance" was taken as an object lesson by the networks; it's doubtful that, 
in the current climate, even a "Lonesome Dove" could be made again. The 
sound-bite ethos of television has taken its toll on the national attention 
span and cramped the medium's ability to convey the significance of monumental 
events. Television is being employed without a sense of historical moment; you 
would never know from watching most news shows that we are in the middle of one 
of greatest global political shifts in the 20th Century. The epic movie is 
predicated on a sense of narrative history, and that sense is increasingly 
absent from mass culture. 
</P>
<P>
This doesn't mean that good epics, exploration-adventure or otherwise, still 
can't, or shouldn't be made. It's a mistake to assume that these movies have to 
cost zillions, or that they should only respond to the four-square conservatism 
of the times by mythologizing four-square conservative heroes. Epics can 
embrace diverse mythologies -- it all depends who's doing the mythologizing. 
</P>
<P>
It's also a mistake to discount old-fashioned "King Solomon's Mines"-type 
squareness. Square doesn't necessarily have to be reactionary; it can be 
beautiful too. The impulse to create comprehensible heroes who live on in some 
protected precinct of our childhoods is not to be belittled. Probably the best 
epic adventure movie of the past 15 years, John Huston's "The Man Who Would Be 
King," was frankly and unapologetically an outsider's vision, with no attempt 
to "modernize" its view of the natives. On the other side, "Lawrence of Arabia" 
demonstrated that the epic adventure could accommodate a hero who was, at 
bottom, incomprehensible. Lean's stately craftsmanship set off T.E. Lawrence's 
depth-charged psychological ambiguities, and that's what made the film seem so 
traditional and yet so modern. 
</P>
<P>
The epic form is alive as long as there are writers and directors with epic 
imaginations, and actors who can embody their visions. And there are, there 
are. We're surrounded by directors (Roger Spottiswoode, Geoff Murphy, and Fred 
Schepisi, for starters) and actors (Nick Nolte, Judy Davis, Denzel Washington, 
Aidan Quinn immediately come to mind) who carry around even in their 
small-scale work an epic purchase on history. They're poised for heroic themes. 
</P>
<P>
Epic movies aren't some lumbering offshoot of the medium. Their sheer bigness 
is basic to the medium, as basic as the quality of stardom. If you were born 
before the '60s, chances are that the movies that first opened your eyes were 
the swashbuckling spectacles. They may not always have been very good, but they 
suggested reaches of adventure and heroism and history that made moviegoing the 
most exciting of romances. It's high time to renew the romance. 
</P>
<P>
I can't wait for "Nostromo."
