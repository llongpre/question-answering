   Will you rush to turn on TV when it's time for "Golden Girders"? 
Or will you decide engineers are incurably unromantic -- dull, even? 

   On the side of the engineers is the head of a congressional task force who believes that all it takes to turn them into the hottest TV attraction since lawyers is a star-studded, prime-time television show. 

   "I don't see why we can't get somebody to do an 'L.A. 
Engineers,'" says Sue Kemnitzer, director of a task force charged with attracting more women and minorities to engineering and science. 
"These people do important, dramatic things, and still have time left for romance." 

   Alarmed by the declining number of U.S. students majoring in engineering, Ms. Kemnitzer believes an engineering melodrama could do wonders for undergraduate interest in the field, much as "L.A. 
Law" revived interest in law school. 
"What we're trying to do is get 'Roseanne' to go to engineering school," she says. 

   In July, Ms. Kemnitzer argued her case in Los Angeles before several people active in film and TV production. 
But Hollywood hasn't exactly erupted with proposals. 

   "I think it's a whimsical idea . . . not very realistic," says Robert Hoffman, an independent producer who met with Ms. Kemnitzer. 
And scriptwriters say the best she can hope for are jazzier supporting roles for high-tech types. 
"It would be a big improvement if TV didn't always portray engineers and scientists as people in white coats doing strange things in secret," says Jeff Stetson, a Los Angeles writer. 

   Others, however, are more optimistic about prospects for a full-blown series on engineers. 
"It's really a question of packaging," says Alan Bloom, who heads the film and TV production program at California State University at Los Angeles. 
"If you put the show together right, it could really sell." 

   Mr. Bloom believes a multinational engineering company could provide the dramatic backdrop for an ensemble cast, much in the way a Los Angeles law firm provides the stage for lawyers specializing in criminal, divorce and corporate law. 
"You could have one character troubleshooting the cause of a bridge collapse, another one exterminating a computer virus, a third working on a space project," he explains.
