<LEADPARA>  THE passing last week of David Lean at age 83 removes yet another esteemed
figure from the art of motion pictures. Few directors can claim a track record
as successful as Lean's (a record that includes two best-director Academy
Awards for films that won a total of 28 Oscars). Fewer still can claim a body
of work so unflaggingly intelligent and meticulously crafted.;    But the fact
that most of Lean's films are available on video is a mixed blessing at best.
While every one of the pictures below ranks high on the "must see" list of
true film lovers, Lean's works since 1957 are so expansive, so sweeping, so
grandly scaled that they achingly emphasize the main drawback of home video:
We watch these films on a tiny TV set, rather than on the huge theatrical
screen for which they were intended. Can one be overwhelmed by the scope and
grandeur of Lawrence's Arabia, or by the vast landscapes of Zhivago's Russia,
when seen on a 27-inch TV screen? Simply, no.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     With this caveat, we present our fat primer of Lean films. To view the
final five, might I suggest finding a friend with a large-screen,
surround-sound TV, or perhaps writing the Camera One and Camera 3 people to
suggest a Lean retrospective or festival at their beautifully renovated Towne
Theater? ("Lawrence of Arabia" is scheduled there in June.) To see these epics
in any other way is to emaciate them and destroy their potent emotional
impact.;     (box) "In Which We Serve" (1942; Embassy). Intensely patriotic
and compassionate statement about war, co-directed by its
writer-producer-star, Noel Coward.;     (box) "Blithe Spirit" (1945; IDK).
Noel Coward's romantic comedy became a vehicle for  Rex Harrison, as a man
haunted by the ghost of his first wife, who is intent on breaking up his
second marriage.;     (box) "Brief Encounter" (1945; Paramount). Classic
five-hanky romance about two ordinary people in war-torn England who enter
into a poignant and ultimately doomed affair.;     (box) "Great Expectations"
(1946; Paramount) and "Oliver Twist" (1948; Discount). Two superb Dickens
adaptations, both starring Alec Guinness.;     (box) "Hobson's Choice" (1954;
HBO). Charles Laughton is brilliant in this period comedy about a domineering
father running roughshod over his daughters' love lives.;     (box)
"Summertime" (1955; Embassy). Another romantic idyll; Katharine Hepburn plays
a spinster who falls in love in Venice.;     (box) "The Bridge on the River
Kwai" (1957; RCA/Columbia). British POWs are forced into slave labor in Burma
to build a railroad trestle vital to Japanese supply lines in this
unforgettable epic of courage and obsession, which won many Oscars, including
best picture, director and actor (Alec Guinness).;     (box) "Lawrence of
Arabia" (1962; RCA/Columbia). Lean turned the fascinating saga of enigmatic
English soldier T.E. Lawrence into an archetypal epic: intelligent, grandiose,
breathtaking and spellbinding. Oscars for best picture, direction, photography
and music. A must for the big-screen treatment; do not attempt to watch this
on video.;     (box) "Dr. Zhivago" (1965; MGM/UA). Pasternak's novel comes
lucidly alive in this panoramic tale of romance and revolution in Russia.;    
(box) "Ryan's Daughter" (1970; MGM/UA; rated R). Sprawling but overlong
romantic melodrama, full of spectacular pastoral scenery of Ireland.;    
(box) "A Passage to India" (1984; RCA/Columbia; PG). Fourteen years after the
critical failure "Ryan's Daughter," Lean emerged to display his mastery of the
medium in this multi-leveled, lushly photographed tale of cultural clashes
between the British and "the mysterious East."  </TEXT>
