   A newly restored version of the epic film
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' scheduled to open here later this week,
previewed Saturday before a star-studded audience that included the
movie's leading actors, Omar Sharif and Peter O'Toole, and its
director, David Lean.
   The movie, which originally opened in 1962, tells the story of
Lawrence's strategy in guiding the 1917-1918 Arab revolt against the
Ottoman Empire. O'Toole plays Lawrence and Sharif plays his friend
Ali.
   The restored version lengthens the film by about 20 minutes to
about four hours, adding transitional passages, scenes in which the
British military plots its strategy, and scenes that add to the
viewer's understanding of Lawrence's personality.
   Saturday's screening, a benefit for the American Film Institute,
also was attended by stars such as Sylvester Stallone and Donald
Sutherland and director Steven Spielberg.
