'LAWRENCE' RESTORED: NOTHING CAN TOUCH IT

From the suppressed excitement in its overture to the last moments as that 
prophetic motorcyclist overtakes Lawrence's open car in the desert, David 
Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia" (Cineplex Odeon, Century City), restored to its 
full clarity and magnificence, is one of the Seven Wonders of the cinematic 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing to come along since "Lawrence's" release in 1962 has diminished the 
power of cameraman F.A. (Freddie) Young's desert vistas. Stretched out in 
70-millimeter Super Panavision vastness, the movie's most pungent memory has 
lost nothing to time as a shimmering pin point in the center of the screen 
becomes clearer and clearer and can finally be read as a man, all in black, on 
camelback, riding straight toward the camera. It's still the greatest actor's 
entrance in movies, the one that launched Omar Sharif into American moviegoing 
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
But Lean never makes haunting pictures for their own sake; he uses scale to 
sculpt character, and as our themes shrink along with our screens, the joy of 
storytelling on this epic scale is thrilling. It couldn't have been an easy 
story to shape. Thomas Edward Lawrence was a scholar, a soldier, a hero with 
notable flaws and a man whom Lowell Thomas said had "a genius for backing into 
the limelight." 
</P>
<P>
In his literate, subtle screenplay from Lawrence's autobiography, "The Seven 
Pillars of Wisdom," Robert Bolt has kept all of Lawrence's complexities: his 
reticences and his flair for bravura; his compassion and the blood lust that 
came on him after his capture by a Turkish Bey at Deraa. And in fleshing out 
the man, Peter O'Toole has fatally colored our vision of Lawrence; the 5-foot-4 
"El Aurens" will forever live as a 6-foot 2 gold-blond demigod. 
</P>
<P>
What has changed? We're finally able to take O'Toole's unwavering charisma for 
granted and look beyond him to the film's uncommonly compassionate and shaded 
portrayal of these Arab leaders. They emerge as proud, brave, ancient, 
honorable: Alec Guinness' elegantly ironic Prince Feisel or Sharif's firebrand 
Sherif Ali, fascinating alternatives to the all-purpose villainy that has been 
the Arabs' lot on screen for so long. The intensity of Lawrence's exchanges 
with these sinuous, seductive men make us forget completely that it is a film 
without women. 
</P>
<P>
Bolt has been only moderately successful in explaining what was taking place 
historically: a revolt by the Arabs against the occupying Turks during World 
War I. Bolt is better at laying out Lawrence's passion to create an Arab 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
Bolt and Lean are best at change-ups, at shifting down from scenic vastness to 
intimate, highly charged moments between two or three characters. Wonderful 
vignettes emerge: Claude Raines at his Cheshire-cat best as the foreign office 
politician Dryden; Jack Hawkins' shrewdly manipulative Gen. Allenby, and Jose 
Ferrer's indelible Turkish Bey, whose beating of Lawrence reveals to the 
Englishman two sides to himself that he finds unendurable: a human side and a 
streak of masochism. 
</P>
<P>
That last trait, of pleasure in punishing his body, has been hinted at in a 
reinstated early, crucial scene between Lawrence and his fellow 
soldier-cartographers in Cairo. Sliding his fingers up a match to put it out, 
Lawrence says: "Of course it hurts. The trick is not minding that it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
There's a slyness to the film makers' presentation of Lawrence; twice, they set 
off his superhuman accomplishments with scenes in which a detached observer 
catches him when he believes himself utterly alone. As he runs to float his 
silken sheik's robes, given by Sharif as a measure of homage, and to catch his 
reflection in his dagger, we move sideways to see his preening, mortifyingly, 
from the point of view of Anthony Quinn, as Auda Abu Tayi, sardonic leader of 
an opposing tribe. 
</P>
<P>
The film, now 3 hours and 36 minutes long (rated PG, because its language is 
pure although its scenes are sometimes bloody), is in two unequal halves. The 
action before the intermission is the upward arc of Lawrence's life, the second 
half is his tragic unraveling, documented by Arthur Kennedy's Jackson Bentley, 
a correspondent and resident ugly American. 
</P>
<P>
The first half ends after Lawrence has pulled off a seeming military 
impossibility, crossing the oven-like Nefud desert and capturing the Turkish 
stronghold of Aqaba. Lawrence's return is a moment of unabashed theater -- Gen. 
Allenby conferring with his filthy, burnoose-clad lieutenant, equal to equal. 
It's a little embarrassing to discover how deeply satisfying the scene is. 
</P>
<P>
The shorter second half, as Lawrence's illusions are stripped from him, is 
almost unendurably painful and oddly unsatisfying. Here, the great visual 
moments are invariably connected with suffering, like the scene in Allenby's 
quarters when Lawrence's wounds at the hands of the Turks bleed through his 
jacket. This stigmata is an eerie, almost Shakespearean device, a bloody 
witness to his "weakness." 
</P>
<P>
In the year after its debut, "Lawrence's" overwhelming authority collared seven 
Academy Awards -- best picture, director, (color) cinematography, (color) art 
direction, sound, editing and music. Although it seems shocking that O'Toole 
and Sharif were omitted, now we can also be grateful for its artful and 
resourceful restorers, Robert Harris and Jim Painten, to Columbia Pictures and 
the quartet of Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Jon Davison and Dawn Steel, 
who supported the complex restoration.
