   Peter O'Toole was 15 minutes late for a lunch
appointment, and he needed a cigarette.
   ``I'm dying for a smoke,'' said the tall, gaunt actor, as he
swept into a crowded French restaurant in central London, removing
his hat with a flourish. ``I've been so virtuous.'' He asked the
maitre d' for a pack of his favorite brand, pungent French Gauloises.
   He sounded like the matinee idol he has played and parodied
on-screen, and was in the proper mock-ebullient spirits to promote
his new movie, ``High Spirits,'' which opened last week in the
United States.
   ``I love playing people who have got relish to life, a firm
identity in not being part of the herd,'' said the actor, whose
character, Peter Plunkett, furthers a line-up of O'Toole eccentrics
ranging from Lawrence of Arabia to the schizoid Earl of Gurney in
``The Ruling Class.''
   ``High Spirits'' casts O'Toole as an heir who inherits a
decaying, haunted Irish castle. Daryl Hannah (``Splash') plays the
castle's comeliest ghost, and Steve Guttenberg (``Cocoon'') and Liam
Neeson (``The Good Father'') head the supporting cast. The movie is
directed by the Irish filmmaker Neil Jordan, who made the low-budget
hits ``Mona Lisa'' and ``The Company of Wolves.''
   Equipped with his cigarettes and an alcohol-free Bloody Mary, the
actor settled down to a salmon trout. The vegetables went untouched.
At 56, he remains as gaunt and chisel-faced as when he shot to
international stardom in 1962 as T.E. Lawrence, the mysterious
English desert warrior, in David Lean's brilliant Academy
Award-winning epic, ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   O'Toole said ``High Spirits'' marked a welcome change from the
demands of his most recent screen role as tutor to the Emperor Pu-Yi
in Bernardo Bertolucci's Oscar-winning ``The Last Emperor.'' It was
a cameo role that nevertheless stole the moment, as O'Toole always
manages to do.
   ``One's always looking for something different from what one did
the last time, and if a funny role comes up, it's very nice to do,''
he said. ``Having just played classic O'Toole in China, which was
not exactly a bundle of laughs, along came this rather potty film.
There was a gentleness I rather liked _ a sweetness, an amiability.''
   He described Plunkett as ``a down-at-heel aristo(crat), someone
who absurdly is hanging on to this enormous pile of stone at all
sorts of costs.''
   Plunkett is the latest in a versatile career that has seen seven
Oscar nominations for performances ranging from Henry II opposite
Katharine Hepburn's Eleanor of Aquitaine in ``The Lion In Winter''
(1968) to the enigmatic film director Eli Cross in ``The Stunt Man''
(1978) and the hilariously self-absorbed actor Alan Swann in ``My
Favorite Year'' (1982).
   However, the actor reserves special affection for ``Lawrence of
Arabia.'' The movie will be re-released shortly with 20 minutes of
lost footage restored, an act of reclamation that pleases its star.
   ``It's a magnificent film, part of film history,'' said O'Toole,
who worked with the celebrated Lean and the screenwriter Robert Bolt
to facilitate the restoration. ``When Sam (Spiegel, the original
producer) died, David went truffling (hunting) and found 20 minutes
that had disappeared without any rhyme, reason or symmetry.''
   It will now be more than four hours long, and O'Toole is
delighted: ``To go back to the epic vision is splendid. That was
what was great fun about `Last Emperor.'''
   Irish-born and English-bred, O'Toole followed the same theatrical
apprenticeship as others of his generation who made it in Hollywood,
such as Albert Finney, the late Richard Burton and Alan Bates.
   His long stage career includes playing Hamlet at the opening of
the National Theater in 1963, and doing a Macbeth in 1980 that was
so reviled by critics that it played to packed curiosity-seeking
audiences at the Old Vic.
   He left his Broadway debut until last year, when he played
Professor Higgins in George Bernard Shaw's ``Pygmalion.'' He and Val
May's production received mixed marks, but he likes New York's
attitude to GBS, his hero.
   ``It was such a relief to go to a country where he was
respected,'' O'Toole said. ``They (audiences) saw the humor and the
situations coming around the corner, so it was like a breath of
great fresh air.''
   O'Toole rarely gives interviews, and he laments the British
press' fascination with his private life: his lengthy, victorious
battle against booze, and his bitter custody dispute over his
5-year-old son Lorcan, which is Irish for Lawrence.
   ``It's lazy copy,'' he said wearily. ``The press got a few good
stories in the '50s and '60s, and they keep it going. It seems I
don't change but the copy does.''
   Having finished lunch, O'Toole looked at his watch and hurriedly
picked up a folder of papers from the floor.
   ``I've got to float,'' he said.
   And with that, the lanky star was gone.
