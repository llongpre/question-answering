   Jim and Tammy Bakker's daughter gave birth
to a son during the weekend _ a 6-pound, 10-ounce boy named partly
after his famous, television evangelist grandfather.
   The Bakkers' first grandchild, James Martin Chapman, was born at
1:32 a.m. Saturday, to Tammy Sue Chapman, 18, and her husband, Doug
Chapman, 26. Mother and baby were in good condition Sunday at
Piedmont Medical Center, hospital officials said.
   ``I had been praying for a boy, and the Lord gave me what I
wanted,'' a tired but happy Mrs. Chapman said.
   The couple named their son for Bakker; Chapman, whose middle name
is Martin; Chapman's father, who also is named Martin; and Chapman's
stepfather, James.

   Former Gov. Orval Faubus sold memorabilia
from his long political career, but he couldn't part with a few
mementos _ like documents validating his election to six consecutive
terms as governor.
   ``I still have six certificates of election,'' Faubus said
Sunday, a day after he took in $5,000 from the auction at his
mansion atop Governor's Hill.
   ``I think we had about 1,000 items listed _ a few large and most
of it small stuff. Political memorabilia must have been nearly half
of it,'' said the 79-year-old Faubus, who served as governor from
1955 to 1967. He has lost three comeback bids for governor, most
recently in 1986.
   One item that fetched $40 was a boat paddle embossed with a
likeness of Faubus and the slogan, ``Faubus for Arkansas,'' from his
1964 race. The most popular political items were license tags,
numbered ``1,'' reserved for the chief executive. ``I was amazed at
the prices. One went for $115, and the cheapest one was $95,'' he
said.
   About 200 people attended Saturday's auction at Faubus'
9,000-square-foot house, which is being sold to a Delaware antique
dealer whom Faubus declined to identify Sunday.

   Nobel Peace Prize-winning Mother Teresa
helped to reopen a convent that had been closed for 17 years, saying
she saw the nuns there doing ``something beautiful for God.''
   Closed because of declining membership, St. Mary's Convent is now
home to 13 nuns who belong to Mother Teresa's Missionaries of
Charity, Contemplative Order, said the Rev. Joseph J. Mirandi,
pastor of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church.
   About 1,500 people packed inside the church shoulder-to-shoulder
to listen to the 78-year-old Mother Teresa, who has become known as
the ``Saint of Calcutta'' for her work with the poor in that Indian
city.
   ``I hope they're going to do something beautiful for God,'' she
told the congregants at Sunday morning Mass. ``It is very important
to help each other and share with each other. I will pray that God's
blessing be with you all.''
   Mother Teresa founded the Missionaries of Charity, an order of
3,000 nuns in 87 countries, in 1950. She became known as the ``Saint
of Calcutta'' for her work with the poor in that Indian city.
   The three-story convent in this northern New Jersey city was
built in 1910 and previously had been used by the Sisters of Charity.

   Sir David Lean, director of the Oscar-winning
epic ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' has urged Hollywood to take risks on
quality films.
   ``Spend some money on risky subjects,'' said Lean, who won the
director's Academy Award for the 1962 movie. ``It's no good being
safe in this business. We've all got to be gamblers.''
   Lean made his comments Sunday at the Los Angeles premiere for the
recently restored three-hour, 40-minute director's cut of ``Lawrence
of Arabia.'' The premiere benefited the American Film Institute and
its campaign to restore and preserve classic films. The new version
already has been released in New York and Washington.
   Joining Lean here were composer Maurice Jarre, director of
photographer Fred A. Young and film editor Anne Coates. All three
won Oscars for their work on the movie, which won seven Academy
Awards, including best picture.
   Actors Anthony Quinn and Omar Shariff, who both starred in the
film, also attended the screening, along with director Steven
Spielberg, actors Michael Douglas, Gregory Peck, Rob Lowe and Alan
Alda.

   With 14 seconds left in his 18th and final
National Basketball Association All-Star Game, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
finally hit a sky hook.
   After missing five sky hooks, he made his sixth to score the
West's final field goal in its 143-134 victory over the East on
Sunday.
   ``I would have been disappointed if it hadn't dropped,'' said the
41-year-old Los Angeles Laker center, who is retiring at the end of
the season, his 20th season. ``I wanted to get a field goal.''
   Abdul-Jabbar was able to play in the game because of an injury to
teammate Magic Johnson.
