"Journey of Love" (at the Beverly Center Cineplex) is a warm and gentle Italian 
film in which a sturdy elderly couple (Omar Sharif and Lea Massari), after 40 
years of procrastinating, abruptly decide to take off -- on foot yet -- for the 
Adriatic Sea, which they have never seen. 
</P>
<P>
As they follow the course of the river from their dying mountain village, they 
find the past washing over them, yielding mainly happy memories but also, not 
surprisingly, uncovering a few regrets and guilts. 
</P>
<P>
Since this is a sunny film with virtually no action and few incidents, director 
Ottavio Fabbri, his distinguished veteran writer Tonino Guerra and the stars 
have no small challenge in sustaining interest. For the most part they succeed, 
although the film could lose about 10 minutes and probably be only the better 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
What the filmmakers beautifully evoke through the couple's journey is an aura 
of reconciliation -- with life, nature and mortality. 
</P>

Sharif has been doing some of his best work in recent years, much of it in 
Europe, some of it in his native Egypt, where he was a top romantic star before 
being cast by David Lean in "Lawrence of Arabia" and "Dr. Zhivago." However, 
virtually none of Sharif's recent films have surfaced in general release in the 
United States. Now silver-haired, he remains as handsome and dashing as ever, 
even in the humble villager's clothing of this film. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Massari, who first came to international attention as the young 
woman who disappeared in Antonioni's "L'Avventura" (1961), has been seen little 
in America since she played the seductive mother in Louis Malle's "Murmur of 
the Heart" (1971). Under the gray wig, padded clothing and creepy eyelid makeup 
of the simple old woman she plays here, Massari remains as vibrant and sensual 
as ever. She and Sharif clearly have lots of fun playing this adorable couple a 
generation older than they actually are. 
</P>
<P>
Much of "Journey of Love" (Times-rated Mature for one brief nude scene) 
consists of a trek through some glorious countryside, photographed in muted 
earth tones by Mauro Marchetti. Along the way, they encounter a philosophical 
old priest (Ciccio Ingrassia), and, in effective counterpoint to their journey, 
we watch unfold a near-silent vignette in which a beautiful young woman 
(Florence Guerin) comes to terms with the loss of her handsome truck-driver 
fiance (Stephane Bonnet) to another woman. 
</P>
<P>
Completing the sentimental pleasures of this endearing little movie is Andrea 
Guerra's romantic score with its waltz theme.
