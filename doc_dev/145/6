<LEADPARA>  THE TRAIN to Nam Tok rumbles over the Bridge on the River Kwai, still in use
though Alec Guinness blew it up at the end of the classic 1957 movie.;   It
didn't really happen that way, of course. It was actually the Americans who
bombed the bridge near the end of World War II.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The real story is an epic in its own right, and the real bridge, a black
steel expanse repaired after the war, remains an enduring monument to the
Allied prisoners of war and Asian laborers who died building it for the
Japanese.;   Unfortunately for their memory, the Bridge on the River Kwai has
also become a tourist trap, much to the dismay of many who come to visit the
site of their relatives' graves.;   From the bridge's graceful,
crescent-shaped spans, visitors can look out across the Kwai's waters and see
souvenir stands selling Bridge on the River Kwai T-shirts, Coke and Pepsi
signs in Thai, a foreign exchange van and a dozen speedboats moored in front
of a floating restaurant waiting to whisk tourists down the river.;   Why not
a River Kwai bumper sticker? Or maybe River Kwai tumblers, ashtray or baseball
cap? How about a documentary video for only $12? "Excellent souvenir," a sign
says.;   "The bridge itself is absolutely soured by the tourism and the
mercenary way the people are exploiting it," said Brian Kettell, a London
academic, on vacation here. "But this is Thailand, I suppose.";   Kettell was
drawn to the bridge, in part, by what he called its "tremendous
popularization" in England by David Lean's 1957 movie.;   Kettell conceded
that the film was not historically accurate.;   "But it's not totally
inaccurate, either," he said. "It does give a flavor of the story. There was a
bridge built, there was horrible suffering and the bridge was blown in the
end, albeit by the Americans, not by the British.";   A sense of that
"horrible suffering" -- and how it lives on -- is still to be felt in this
provincial city, 90 miles west of Bangkok, despite the blatant tourist
exploitation that includes a 10-day Bridge on the River Kwai festival every
fall, complete with sound effects of bombing and anti-aircraft fire.;   A mass
grave containing the skeletons of hundreds of Asian laborers was discovered
last year, right before the annual bridge bash, a major tourist event.;  
While cynics noted how convenient the timing was, finding the grave site did
help underscore the fact that more than 100,000 Asians -- Indians, Burmese,
Malays, Indonesians, Chinese and Thais -- perished while building the
so-called Death Railway, a 260-mile line connecting Thailand and Burma.;  
After invading and occupying Southeast Asia, the Japanese ordered construction
of the route in 1942 in preparation for an invasion of India. They completed
the line, which most said would take five years to hack through dense jungle
and mountain rock, in 13 months -- at tremendous human cost.;   Much better
known, of course, are the 16,000 Allied prisoners of war who died as well,
mostly British, Australian and Dutch, with several hundred Americans among the
victims.;   Trevor Dakin decided to retire in Thailand after visiting the
bridge as a tourist five years ago. Dakin, a former prisoner of war,
immigrated to Canada from Britain after the war and worked as a salesman for
an air-conditioning manufacturer. He figured his small pension would go a lot
further in Thailand than in Canada.;   Dakin also had a feeling that something
was beckoning him to return.;   "I have an affinity for this country," Dakin,
71, said. " . . . There were many times, my friend, when we would lie there in
the jungle and say, 'This is a beautiful country. I would like to see it in
better circumstances.' These 48 years later are the better circumstances."  </TEXT>
