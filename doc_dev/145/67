   Film buffs and movie stars paid homage to
Charlie Chaplin on Thursday as the International Film Festival got
under way for the 42nd year at this sparkling French Riviera resort.
   On Wednesday night, at a special pre-opening, T.E. Lawrence rode
across the desert to the delight of the movie audience in the
European premiere of the restored version of ``Lawrence of Arabia.''
   French Culture Minister Jack Lang opened the 13-day festival,
paying homage to Chaplain. Present for the opening were Chaplin's
granddaughter, Geraldine, as well as Rosanna Arquette, Barbara
Hendricks, Yves Montand, Sophia Loren, Grace Jones and Princess
Caroline of Monaco.
   On Wednesday night, Omar Sharif and Anthony Quinn swept grandly
into the Palais des Festivals for the black-tie showing of the
uncut, original 216-minute version of Sir David Lean's ``Lawrence
of Arabia.'' They ascended a staircase lined with young men in
Bedouin dress.
   At a news conference Thursday, Quinn spoke of his love for the
film.
   ``Last night sitting next to Omar Sharif, we both said to each
other if we made no other picture and had to rest on this picture,
I would be extremely happy,'' he said.
   On Thursday, there was a showing of ``New York Stories,'' the
film with segments directed by Woody Allen, Martin Scorsese and
Francis Ford Coppola.
   ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and ``New York Stories'' are outside the
official competition, but 22 other films from 14 countries are
competing for the prestigious festival award, the Golden Palm, to
be presented at the close of the festival May 23.
   The winner will be decided by a 10-member jury, headed by West
German director Wim Wenders.
   ``I don't think there is a recipe for a good film,'' Wenders
said. ``For me, a good film is a film that has found a moment of
truth.''
   ``We are simply looking for films that achieve a vision ... and
certainly an idea and a feeling,'' said actress Sally Field,
another member of the jury.
   This year's official selection emphasizes film as entertainment,
departing from last year's festival which featured a great many
long, somber ``cinema d'auteur'' films.
   Some say this year's festival has its eye on the stars.
   Film stars are everywhere on Cannes' main street, La Croisette.
Among those showing up Thursday was Nick Nolte, who plays a famous
artist about to be deserted by his lover-assistant in the Scorsese
portion of ``New York Stories.''
   Much awaited is Meryl Streep, whose face stares from magazine
covers and newspaper kiosks all over France. She stars in Fred
Schepisi's ``A Cry in the Dark,'' about an Australian woman accused
of infanticide after her baby is snatched by a dingo in the outback.
   Four American films are competing for the Golden Palm: Spike
Lee's ``Do the Right Thing,'' High Hundson's ``Lost Angels,'' Jim
Jarmusch's ``Mystery Train'' and Steven Soderbergh's ``Sex, Lies
and Video Tapes,'' the director's first full-length film.
   Three French movies are in the competition, including the much
awaited ``Trop Belle Pour Toi'' (``Too Beautiful for You''),
directed by Bertrand Blier and starring France's favorite leading
man, Gerard Depardieu. He plays a garage mechanic who falls out of
love with his beautiful wife in favor of a less- attractive woman.
   Among other films receiving special attention is ``Splendor'' by
Italy's Ettore Scola, a veteran of Cannes.
   While the tone of the festival has been set in the opening days
with films by established directors, four directors competing for
the coveted prize are showing their first full-length films here.
   Beside the official competitors, more than 1,500 movies will be
screened.
   Wenders said he hoped the festival and the jury vote would
``advance the art of cinema.''
   ``Everybody knows how much harm has been done by the fact that
everthing is on television, so much, so fast,'' he said. ``Young
people, especially ... have lost the feeling of going to the
movies.''
