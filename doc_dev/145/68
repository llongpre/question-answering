   Whistling may be on the wane, but it has had its moments in
American musical history.
   Whistling figured prominently in several movies, notably ``The
Bridge on the River Kwai'' and ``The High and the Mighty.'' And, of
course, Walt Disney's seven dwarfs in ``Snow White'' whistled while
they worked.
   Whistling also helped define Disney's oldest and most popular
character, Mickey Mouse. Early cartoons depict Mickey strolling
along, hands clasped behind his back, face tilted to the sky, lips
puckered.
   More recently, Jason Serinus of Los Angeles has provided the
whistling voice of Woodstock, Snoopy's feathered friend on the
``Charlie Brown'' specials.
   The cheerfully whistled theme song of the 1960s situation comedy
``Mayberry RFD'' still lives on in reruns.
   A few songs celebrate the art: ``Whistling in the Dark,'' for
instance or ``Whistle a Happy Tune'' from ``The King and I.'' Other
songs include whistled passages. The 1970s rock 'n' roll song,
``Hocus Pocus,'' consisted only of instrumental music interspersed
with yodeling and manic whistling.
   Movie and cartoon characters have long used whistling as an
obvious disguise for guilt. Ineffective talk is ``whistling in the
wind;'' nonsensical talk is ``just whistling Dixie.'' A gesture of
false courage is ``whistling past the graveyard.''
   Whistling also has its superstitions.
   Some hold that whistling inside a house is as risky as opening
an umbrella indoors. Well into the 20th century, whistling aboard
ship was said to summon up a gale. Whistling in a theater was
believed to doom the current production, and veteran journalists
swear it's bad luck to whistle in a newsroom.
   Some cultures have prohibited whistling altogether. Arab
countries consider it evil, and Victorian etiquette books
pronounced it vulgar, at least for women.
   Some people are annoyed by whistling or find it tiresome. No
more tiresome, though, than their stock remark: ``Did you have
birdseed for lunch?''
