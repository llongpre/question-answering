  [Text] Yerevan ("Lragir", "Azg", "Yerkir" dailies), 
03/03/94 -- The railway bridge over the river Khram in the 
Marneuliskiy district of Georgia was exploded at 4am in the 
morning of March 2 as a result of a terrorist action. 
  RA [Republic of Armenia] Governmental press service informed 
us, the main railway bridge was damaged after the first 
explosion in December, 1993. A new temporary bridge was built 
nearby, allowing transfer of trains over the bridge. One of the 
supporting blocks of the new bridge has been damaged as a result 
of the new explosion. 
  The RA Prime Minister Grant Bagratyan promised to deliver 
the 
grain and fuel to Armenia by air. Meanwhile the Minister of 
Food and Resources David Zadoyan reported, trucks were sent to 
Georgia for delivering the cargoes (particularly grain). The 
reconstruction of the bridge will take 20-25 days at least, Mr. 
Zadoyan reported. 
  The Armenian specialists left to the place of the explosion. 
According to the official report, the reconstruction time will 
be only known after investigating the situation on the spot. 
  This is fifth explosion at the railway, connecting Armenia 
with the external world, during this winter. And therefore the 
declarations of the Georgian parliamentarian Aleksandr Kavasadze 
about "brotherly relations" between Armenia and Georgia, made on 
March 1, sound rather strange. 
  Meanwhile the Yerevan-Tbilisi highway is being used starting 
from March 2. The non-stable situation in Georgia didn't allow 
to use this road before. The main difficulty is to ensure the 
security in the Marneuli-Tbilisi section, which is now 
guaranteed.
