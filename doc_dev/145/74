Sir Teddy Taylor calls on Heseltine to investigate company

THE HEAD of an Italian civil engineering company which last year
controversially won the contract to supply steelwork for a Pounds 300m
bridge over the river Severn in Britain has been placed under house arrest
in Italy following allegations of corruption.
Sir Teddy Taylor, Conservative MP for Southend East, who strongly criticised
the award of the contract to Cimolai, yesterday wrote to Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade secretary, requesting an official investigation into
the Italian company.
He said: 'This raises serious issues which must be investigated, given the
previous concern over the award of an important contract to a non-British
company.'
The allegations against Mr Luigi Cimolai, managing director of Cimolai,
involve two projects in north-east Italy - the proposed construction of the
Plandipan-Sequals highway and the completed Delizia bridge across the River
Tagliamento, close to the company's headquarters in Pordenone.
Some of the biggest corruption scandals in Italy have involved construction
and engineering companies, which were awarded lucrative domestic contracts
for public works projects in exchange for making illicit payments to
political parties.
The arrest is embarrassing for John Laing of the UK and GTM Entrepose of
France which are jointly building the privately financed Severn crossing and
which awarded the Pounds 7m steelwork contract to Cimolai in November.
Mr Martin Laing, chairman of the British construction group, said: 'Our
contract is with a company, not with an individual. We were required under
EC rules to advertise the job internationally.
'We would have preferred to give the work to a British company but Cimolai
offered by far the best terms and has an excellent record for this kind of
work. The company's offer and record were checked thoroughly.'
Sir Teddy Taylor, however, remains critical of the deal. He said: 'I am
concerned that companies from the continent can use EC competition rules to
win work in Britain with the benefit of subsidised prices, while British
companies find it impossible to make headway in countries like Italy.'
The British Constructional Steelwork Association says Italian steelwork
companies seeking to gain a foothold in the market have been undercutting
prices submitted by local suppliers by up to 20 per cent.
Cimolai was recently reported to have won a steelwork contract for the Pont
de Normandie viaduct on the A29 motorway near Le Havre in northern France.
