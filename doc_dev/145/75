<LEADPARA>  IN THE beginning, artists Ruth Tunstall Grant and Claude Ferguson founded
Genesis as a sanctuary for the arts.;   Two years later, Genesis represents
that and more -- a collaborative spirit of visual artists, musicians and
literary artists sharing space to work and perform.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The art at Genesis deals with the environment, the war, the soul, and other
issues. But all of it deals with solutions.;   "The spirit that comes out of
the art is upward, positive," said Grant, also director/curator of the
Montalvo Gallery at Villa Montalvo, and an artist in residence at the
Children's Shelter. "Artists are always looking for solutions.";   The visual
artists who work at Genesis include: glass artist Robert Murray; montage
artist Ras Lowe; Kwai, who works in mixed media; spray can artist Aladdin; Pam
Zsori, who works with textiles; Columba Johnson, who specializes in fashion
design, illustration and film; computer artist and painter Robert Fitzsimmons;
Robert Stookey and Judith Juncker, both painters.;   Genesis is also home base
to a number of musicians.;   There's Telefunken, a group that plays
experimental rap, hip hop, and world beat sounds. Kwai also serves as disc
jockey for Telefunken, mixing recorded music and while composing and arranging
his own sound. There's actress Brenda Bell Brown; an original reggae band,
Inka Inka, and saxophonist and composer Regi Oliver, who leads the jazz group
Remote Control.;   Literary artists work alongside the others, including Brown
who is also a playwright and poet; Charles Williams, fiction writer and poet;
and Chris Strunck, fiction and screenplay writer.;   These artists share nine
work spaces in a downtown San Jose warehouse that used to house a body shop.
"We have a waiting list," said Grant. "There's a real need for space. Space is
. . . one of the things to help you grow.";   According to Ferguson, who is
also an artist in residence at the Children's Discovery Museum and the Santa
Clara County Children's Shelter, the artists are not just renting space,
they're building something much greater. All have unique interactions with the
community.;   "We tend to work with constituents that no one wants to touch,"
said Grant. "But everyone deserves the right to be creative.";   For example,
painter Robert Stookey came to Genesis looking for work. Stookey then lived --
and still lives -- in subsidized independent housing in downtown San Jose. He
was given cleaning and maintenance tasks. Soon he told the others that he had
always wanted to be an artist.;   "We said, 'There's a space,' " said Grant.
"All of the artists at Genesis donated materials. Everybody talked to him.;  
"Now his work hangs at Genesis.";   Painter Judith Juncker works closely with
AIDS patients. Some of their work was displayed last December 1 at Genesis on
The Day of No Art, when museums across the country draped artwork in black to
focus attention on the artists and creativity lost to AIDS. Ten of Juncker's
students hung their art.;   "Only five are alive now," said Grant. "We gave --
and give -- people a gift you can't measure.";   Genesis also reaches out to
the community with activities like "Art to Be Stolen." "It's about artists
donating art," said Ferguson. "They tend to have a lot of art they've had for
awhile.";   That art is then given away.;   "People were shocked they could
just come in and take stuff," Ferguson said. Last year, the art was scooped up
in just the first 45 minutes of what was to be an afternoon event.;   "Even
the policeman that came to watch us, said, 'You mean I can take this?' Now
he's one of our primary collectors," said Grant.;   During the past year,
students have visited Genesis for a full day of learning. "We talk about each
studio," Grant said. They then may do something like learn how to make a
beaded necklace. This fall Genesis would like to expand the program to include
youth groups, private schools and organizations with high risk children.;  
"We've received a lot of quiet support from the community, moral and financial
support, even a typewriter, since we started," Grant said. "We get to give
something back to the community, to say thank you."; Upcoming at Genesis;
