   Rain and melting snow pushed rivers over
their banks, sweeping away one house and two mobile homes,
collapsing part of a bridge and forcing as many as 80 people to
evacuate, officials said Friday.
   Flood warnings remained in effect Friday along the Nooksack and
three other rivers in northwestern Washington, with the National
Weather Service predicting warm weather and occasionally heavy rain
in the Cascade Mountains.
   The worst problems were in Whatcom County, where the loss of a
bridge over the Nooksack cut off access to about 10,000 to 11,000
people, although some could be reached overland through Canada,
said Gary Myers of the county's Department of Emergency Services.
   Two days of warm rain melted snow on 10,775-foot Mount Baker,
filling the river's three forks.
   As many as 60 people were evacuated in Whatcom County and fewer
than two dozen left their homes in Skagit County, officials said.
   In the Glacier area, 90 miles north of Seattle, a vacation house
``collapsed into (Canyon) creek'' and two recreational mobile homes
``were pinned against some trees'' along Glacier Creek, said
volunteer fire Capt. Tim Coralline. No one was injured, Myers said.
   Flood warnings also were posted along the Skagit, Snoqualmie and
Snohomish, rivers.
   Washington 9 and 544 were closed at Everson, where most of the
evacuations occurred. Washington 542 _ called the Mount Baker
Highway and the county's main east-west road _ was closed at
Nugent's Corner, when an 80-foot section of bridge collapsed
Thursday, Myers said.
   Myers said some high-bottom vehicles were able to pass through
Everson for about 2{ hours early Friday before the water rose again.
   ``Wherever the river is, we're having problems right now,''
Myers said. ``A lot of the secondary roads that would normally take
up the slack are having problems, too.''
   Leslie Salisbury of the state Transportation Department said the
bridge at Nugent's Corner had been closed several hours before the
collapse and would take at least several weeks to repair.
   Whatcom County Executive Shirley Van Zanten declared the county
a disaster area, and state transportation officials authorized
emergency funding so people and equipment could be hired as needed.
   Earlier, 25 to 30 people were evacuated from a trailer home park
in Everson as waters reached about three feet in the town Thursday.
An additional 20 people were evacuated from the Glacier area.
   At Everson, volunteers coordinated by the fire department placed
sandbags around city hall and other buildings, said Mary Branham,
assistant city clerk.
