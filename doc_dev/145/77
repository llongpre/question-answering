Rain and melting snow pushed rivers over their banks, sweeping away at least 
three homes, collapsing part of a bridge and forcing as many as 80 people to 
evacuate, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Flood warnings remained in effect Friday along the Nooksack and three other 
rivers in northwestern Washington, with the National Weather Service predicting 
warm weather and occasionally heavy rain in the Cascade Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
The worst problems were in Whatcom County, where the loss of a bridge over the 
Nooksack cut off access to about 10,000 to 11,000 people, although some could 
be reached overland through Canada, said Gary Myers of the county's Department 
of Emergency Services. Two days of warm rain melted snow on 10,775-foot Mt. 
Baker, filling the river's three forks. 
</P>
<P>
Myers said three houses and several mobile homes had been swept away near 
Glacier, 90 miles north of Seattle. No one was injured, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Flood warnings also were posted along the Skagit, Snoqualmie and Snohomish 
rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 9 and 544 were closed at Everson, where most of the evacuations 
occurred.
