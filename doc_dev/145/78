<DESCRIPT>  TELEVISION; REVIEW  </DESCRIPT>
<LEADPARA>  COUNTRY singer Reba McEntire dragged me into her corral for good last March
when she fought back the tears and ripped into that show-stopping number at
the Academy Awards -- just a week after the tragic plane crash that killed
nearly every member of her band.;    It was a courageous and incandescent
performance by the new queen of country music, and it brought the cynical
Hollywood crowd to its feet to cheer her moxie as well as her enormous talent.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Now McEntire is riding into Hollywood territory again but this time as an
aspiring actress. That will take a lot of courage, too, but I'm predicting
she'll be just as big a hit.;    McEntire will star in NBC's "Luck of the
Draw: The Gambler Returns," the fourth in the phenomenally successful series
of TV movies chronicling the frontier adventures of Brady Hawkes, the card
sharp immortalized by country star Kenny Rogers in song and on film. The
two-part movie is expected to turn up in November.;    McEntire's character,
Burgundy Jones, is a fearless ex-madam who teams up with Hawkes (Rogers) for a
cross-country trek that winds up in San Francisco for the biggest card game in
frontier history.;    Based on the clips I've seen, McEntire couldn't do a
better job of stealing the picture from Rogers if she stuck a six-gun in his
ribs. Fortunately, Rogers is one of the most generous guys in show business.
I'm sure he won't mind having McEntire attract a little extra attention to his
latest "Gambler" opus.;    In her tight black leather pants outfit, McEntire
looks lean and mean. But she also gets to wear what she calls the "fainting
feminine" dress to prove she can look wholesome, too.;    ("I must tell you, I
dreaded seeing her in the leather," Rogers has remarked. "She used to slap me
around every day.");    She also tucks a smirk into nearly every scene, which
puts a wonderful comic spin on her broadly drawn character.;    Nor did it
hurt to have McEntire look authentic on horseback. She grew up working on her
dad's 8,000-acre ranch in southeastern Oklahoma and may be one of the best
horsewomen in show business. She was well-prepared for Burgundy's derring-do.;
   In one scene, she gets to save Rogers from the hangman's noose by cutting
loose with a Gatling gun. In another, her life is saved by, of all people,
Kwai Chang Caine, David Carradine's beatific Eurasian hero from the old "Kung
Fu" series. One of the bad guys has just tossed a knife at her head, and Caine
lopes out of the shadows to snatch it from the air just in the nick of time.; 
  (Carradine's Caine is just one of 14 old TV western heroes Rogers and
McEntire meet up with along the trail to San Francisco. Among them, McEntire's
childhood favorites: Clint Walker as Cheyenne Bodie and Johnny Crawford as
Mark McCain from "The Rifleman.");    Obviously, Burgundy Jones is the kind of
character folks are going to be talking about the next day. It was just the
sort of thing McEntire was looking for to help turn her into a movie star.;   
"I've always wanted to get into movies," McEntire said this summer at a
screening of clips with co-star Rogers and TV critics. "It's probably the
hardest work I've ever done, because it's a lot of early hours and a lot of
late hours. But it's a big thrill for me to get to do it. And I would like to
do more in the future, if possible.";    Casting McEntire in this colorful,
sexy-comic role was the brainchild of director Dick Lowry, who has done all
Rogers' "Gambler" movies. He had seen her in her feature film debut -- a comic
supporting role in the 1990 science fiction film "Tremors" -- and thought
she'd be perfect for Burgundy Jones.;    In "Tremors," McEntire played half of
a paramilitary husband-wife team -- Michael Gross of "Family Ties" was her
gun-toting hubby -- who turned all their firepower on giant desert
worm-monsters that cornered them in their fortress-like home. It was a
well-liked film, but not many saw it.;    Millions will see her in "Luck of
the Draw," a fact that wasn't lost on either McEntire or her manager/husband,
Narvel Blackstock.;    "I didn't even read the script," she said. "I was for
it immediately.";    Her eagerness wasn't all due to the career benefits
either. McEntire admits playing Burgundy Jones fulfilled a lot of childhood
fantasies she had from watching Barbara Stanwyck in "The Big Valley" on TV.;  
 "I've always been a big fan of westerns," she explained. "And I've been a big
fan of hers forever. So, to play in a western movie, shoot a Gatling gun, ride
a horse, then dress up in real nice clothes -- it's a fantasy come true."  </TEXT>
