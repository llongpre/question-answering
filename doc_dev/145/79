<LEADPARA>  Many years ago when my daughters were small, the younger one asked the older,
"In a civil war, the two sides are the same country. So which is the good
one?" The older one thought a minute before the solution dawned on her, "The
one that wins." She was too small to understand the full wisdom of her answer,
but children have an uncanny knack for cutting to the core of truth.;   The
50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor has been an occasion for assessing blame. Do
the Japanese owe us an apology for the 2,400 Americans killed at Pearl Harbor?
If so, do we owe them an apology for the 115,000 men, women and children
killed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki? The general sentiment in this country seems
to be that they owe us an apology, but we don't owe them one. That is normal,
but a big mistake.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     In the new era of global interdependence, every war is a civil war of
brother fighting against brother to their mutual detriment. Now, as then, the
winner in a civil war gets to write the history books and become the good guy.
But also now, as then, the loser chafes under the unfair stigma and
humiliation and waits his chance for revenge. It is no coincidence that Hitler
had France's 1940 surrender take place in the same railway car that witnessed
the signing of Germany's humiliating defeat in 1918.;   In our quest for
designation as righteous warrior against Japan (and Germany), for 50 years we
have been setting up a similar rematch. The recent rise in virulent Japanese
nationalism and militarism is an ominous sign that history may be about to
repeat itself.;   One of my colleagues, either crazy or prescient, thinks it
will be a shooting war. But even "merely" an economic war will take a heavy
toll on both sides. There are already signs that we Americans are paying a
heavy price for enjoying what has traditionally been one of the fruits of
victory -- writing history to our benefit, thereby humiliating our opponent.; 
 Admittedly, we have been kinder this time around than in earlier wars, but we
are still far from honest and fair. On the surface, Germany and Japan are to
blame for World War II. They were militaristic and warlike, and they attacked
first. But, if we look deeper, we find sources of blame which we have
minimized:;   (check) France, Britain and the United States forced a
humiliating defeat and impossible economic reparations on Germany in 1918,
even though it was no more responsible for starting World War I than many
others.;   (check) Both the Chinese Nationalists and Communists refused to
recognize that some goals of the other side were reasonable. Instead, they
fought a debilitating civil war that left a power vacuum in Manchuria that was
filled by warlords and bandits. This gave the Japanese a basis for "sending
the Marines to restore order" and protect Japanese business interests.;  
(check) The colonial powers subjugated much of Asia, allowing Japan the
illusion that its "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere" was Asians
liberating Asians from Caucasian domination and racism. America of the 1930s
was an openly racist nation, prone to an earlier form of Japan bashing.;  
This list could be extended and supplemented with equally long lists for
Japan, Germany, Hungary, Russia and every other nation involved in the war.;  
So who should apologize to whom? Certainly, no nation should be humiliated
into an apology. Forced apologies are hollow and short-lived, and no nation
speaks with a single voice. Assessing blame for the last war only leads to the
next.;   Rather, let those among us who are secure enough to recognize that
all humans are fallible come forward and apologize for their own mistakes. If
enough of us find that nobility of spirit, just maybe there will be no next
war for which to apologize.;   -- Martin E. Hellman;   Stanford;
JAPANESE-AMERICANS: KEEP ON SPEAKING UP;   I want to thank the Mercury News
for its coverage of the 50th anniversary of Pearl Harbor. I am especially
pleased that the articles have clearly differentiated between
Japanese-Americans and World War II-era Imperial Japan. They all include at
least some mention of Japanese-Americans and the unconstitutional uprooting of
almost 120,000 into concentration camps as well as the Japanese-American
contributions toward the war effort.;   However, I must take issue with one of
the points raised by Sharon Noguchi in her Dec. 1 column.;   Noguchi writes
that, in the face of a nationwide media blitz on the Pearl Harbor anniversary,
Japanese-Americans are keeping a low profile. Actually, this is not an
accurate portrayal of the Japanese-American people as a whole, nor does it
describe Japanese-Americans in the San Jose area.;   On the contrary, the
generally sympathetic national coverage is a direct result of purposeful
organizing, speaking out, lobbying, letter writing and public education. For
the past 12 years, Japanese-Americans in various locales around the country
have educated news editors and reporters, public officials from city councils
to the U.S. Congress and the White House, schoolteachers and children, and
John Q. Public on what happened to us after Dec. 7, 1941.;   In all cases, the
impact made on people has been due to former internees, not those of "higher
profile" as Noguchi suggests. These are people who have been willing to speak
out -- again and again. San Jose Japanese-Americans have been a part of this
from the beginning -- retired gardeners, auto mechanics, teachers, homemakers,
business and professional people -- regular people as well as community
leaders.;   I think that it's time that the stereotype of Japanese-Americans
as "quiet Americans" is finally laid to rest. No low profiles here. So,
remember Pearl Harbor, if you like, but also remember this: Japanese-Americans
did not bomb Pearl Harbor and we're quite willing and able to stand up for
what's right.;   -- Susan Hayase;   San Jose; BITTER MEMORIES OF ATROCITIES
LINGER;   It is easy to say: "The war is long over, let's forget everything.";
  Those of us who are directly and continually affected by what the Japanese
did cannot forget.;   They came as tourists at first. They took photographs of
the landscape and studied diverse areas, including a reservoir and
hydroelectric plant where my father worked. Later they were to land their
planes there.;   They invaded Java and imprisoned the Dutch people in horrible
concentration camps. They starved my grandfather. They killed my uncle who
worked on the bridge over the River Kwai. They confiscated the homes that
belonged to my parents. They captured and tortured my mother who this summer
finally died an agonizing death as a direct result of a tumorous growth that
Japanese soldiers caused by beating her repeatedly on her head.;   Had they
caught my father, they would without a doubt have tortured and murdered him.
All my Dutch relatives who lived in Indonesia at the time could tell you
horror stories you wouldn't dare print in your paper.;   I grew up with these
stories. As a young girl I saw the mutilated bodies and the diseased people
dying on the streets. I grew up with this deep hatred for the Japanese that
I've been desperately trying to overcome. I will never be able to trust any of
them. Although I try to be fair, I cannot help but remember that at first the
Japanese came as friends and then turned into bloodthirsty animals.;   How can
I say "Let's forget and treat them as friends" when I see how they are slowly
invading the world through the acquisition of real estate everywhere,
including in the United States. They own Hawaii! Thank god they didn't get
Yosemite. Don't be shocked if sometime in the future history repeats itself.; 
 My parents never received compensation for losing their homes or the anguish
they had to endure; neither did any of the other victims of the Japanese
invasion. My mother became furious at the mention of compensation for the
interned families here in the States. They didn't have the living hell their
countrymen created in Indonesia.;   -- J. Prather;   Boulder Creek; IT'S TIME
WE STOPPED OUR JAPAN-BASHING;   Here we go again -- round 50 in our seemingly
never-ending exercise in racism, bigotry and self-righteousness. When will it
ever end?;   Of course I'm referring to today -- Dec. 7, 1991 -- a date many
in this country will use to justify that favorite pastime, Japan-bashing.
Frankly, it's become very boring and pathetic. And the sheer hypocrisy is
appalling.;   Whether the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 was "sneaky"
or surprising is largely irrelevant. What is relevant is the fact that Pearl
Harbor, as home of the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet, was a legitimate military
target. While war had not been officially declared between the two nations, a
virtual state of war had existed between Japan and the United States for some
time prior to Dec. 7, 1941. Japan merely launched what they considered a
pre-emptive military strike against an enemy target.;   It was unfortunate
that 2,000-plus Americans lost their lives in the attack. But that number is
insignificant when compared with the 450,000 Americans who died in World War
II or the estimated 30 million who died worldwide.;   Yes, we should never
forget the horror and tragedy of war. But Pearl Harbor Day has become
something of a celebration in this country, and I find that repulsive. We must
never glorify war and its consequences. The sooner we put Dec. 7, 1941, behind
us, the greater our chances of achieving lasting peace in the world.;   --
