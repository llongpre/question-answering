   Syndicated advice columnist Abigail Van Buren,
Dear Abby to millions of newspaper readers, said people often ask
if she makes up the letters she prints.
   ``I couldn't begin to make up anything half as good as I get in
my morning mail,'' she said Thursday.
   Miss Van Buren, who began writing her column 33 years ago, said
she has fun with her responses, but takes her advice
responsibilities seriously.
   ``I never sacrifice sound judgment just for the sake of humor,''
she said.
   While the answers are her own, Miss Van Buren consults with
lawyers, doctors and other professionals.
   ``I don't write for laughs. My primary motive is not to
entertain. It's to inform,'' she told a group of newspaper
publishers.
   Miss Van Buren receives 10,000 to 15,000 letters each week.
   ``The best ones I can't print,'' she said.

   Sir David Lean, the English filmmaker who
created ``Doctor Zhivago,'' ``The Bridge on the River Kwai'' and
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' will receive a life achievement award from
his American counterparts.
   ``Lean joins a distinguished group of individuals who have made
enormous contributions to America's film heritage,'' Gene
Jankowski, chairman of the American Film Institute, said Thursday.
   ``You must be joking! This is remarkable,'' the 81-year-old Lean
responded when learning of the honor Wednesday, said filmmaker
Steven Spielberg, who broke the news as a trustee of the institute.
   Lean, the Life Achievement Award winner for 1990, joins 17
previous winners who include Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock, James
Cagney and Bette Davis. Lean will be honored at a dinner March 8 in
Beverly Hills that will be broadcast by ABC-TV.
   Lean's hits include the 1957 Academy Award-winner ``The Bridge
on the River Kwai,'' and the 1962 Academy Award winner ``Lawrence
of Arabia. Lean made ``Dr. Zhivago'' in 1965, ``Ryan's Daughter''
in 1970 and ``A Passage to India'' in 1984.

   Singer Joan Jett abruptly ended a concert
after the first set when she was hit in the face with a bracelet
thrown from the crowd.
   Miss Jett spun away from the microphone holding her face
Thursday night, then kicked the mike stand over, strode to the edge
of the stage and shouted: ``Who ... did that?''
   Miss Jett left the stage, and a member of her road company
informed the crowd, ``The show is over, ladies and gentlemen. I'm
sorry, there had to be one jerk in the audience.''
   Miss Jett had a minor cut under her right eye, said Kasim
Sulton, bassist in her band the Blackhearts, after the show at a
fair.
   The bracelet thrower was never identified.
   Sulton said similar incidents happen ``fairly often'' on Miss
Jett's tours.

   Oddly enough, playing a broken-down alcoholic
helped Faye Dunaway's image.
   The 48-year-old actress says her acclaimed role in ``Barfly''
was ``a wonderful chance'' _ to work opposite Mickey Rourke and to
undo some of the negative publicity lingering from 1981's ``Mommie
Dearest.''
   ``Mickey Rourke comes to me in a Chinese restaurant downtown and
says, `I'm doin' this thing, you wanna do it?''' Dunaway said in
the Oct. 16 issue of US magazine.
   ``I thought: Great, deglamorize, get some soul out there. Turn
the perception around.''
   Dunaway, nominated for Academy Awards for her performances in
``Bonnie and Clyde'' and ``Chinatown'' and a winner for
``Network,'' was ridiculed for her overwrought portrayal of Joan
Crawford in ``Mommie Dearest.''
   ``It was a movie that didn't achieve what it set out to do,''
she said. ``It just went too far and became camp.''
