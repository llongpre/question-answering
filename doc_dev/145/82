PROBLEMS with Husky Oil, a Canadian oil and gas producer, forced Hutchison
Whampoa, the large Hong Kong trading company controlled by Mr Li Ka-shing,
to announce a 5 per cent fall in after-tax profits yesterday to HKDollars
3.3bn (USDollars 426.4m) in 1991 from HKDollars 3.5bn in 1990.
Hutchison took an above-the-line write off of HKDollars 763m - its share of
a provision Husky, of which it owns 49 per cent, has made for the fall in
the value of its oil and gas reserves. Last week, Cavendish International, a
Hutchison subsidiary, made a provision of HKDollars 462m for its share of
Husky's write-off.
Mr Simon Murray, managing director of Hutchison, said it was too early to
say when Husky would improve, but he did not expect any in the short-term.
If oil and gas prices did not rise 'then we will have to take another look
at it.'
Mr Murray scotched rumours of an imminent rights issue, saying there were no
plans to have one this year. He said the company was financially strong and
had no need of an issue to fund existing operations.
The Husky write-off took the shine away from what analysts described as a
very impressive underlying growth in profits from Hutchison's businesses,
especially those in Hong Kong. Operating profit was up 15.5 per cent and, if
the write-off was added back to pre-tax earnings, they would have shown an
18.8 per cent improvement, they said.
Looking ahead, Mr Li Ka-shing, chairman, said the continued strength of the
Hong Kong property market, increased container traffic, and general growth
with in the colony's economy due to its proximity to China, should all
benefit the company's operations.
The directors declared a final dividend of 48 cents, which makes a total for
the year of 68 cents - up 4.5 per cent on 1990.
Mr Li said that the company's property interests continued to make good
contributions to profit in 1991. The property division benefited from the
continued strong demand in Hong Kong for medium-sized residential units.
Record growth was achieved in its container terminal operations through its
60 per cent subsidiary, Hongkong International Terminals (HIT). HIT handled
2.5m 20ft equivalent units (TEUs) through Kwai Chung container port. 'Future
growth will be enhanced by the formation of a partnership with the China
Ocean Shipping Company (Cosco) to develop half of the new Terminal 8 and
Kwai Chung,' he said.
The acquisition of Felixstowe Port, the biggest container port in the UK,
was ahead of planned targets, Mr Murray said.
Hutchison Telecommunications will shortly be launching its telepoint (CT2)
business in the UK. This venture, of which it owns 65 per cent, has and will
require large investment and that spending reduced profits from the
telecommunications group last year.
In terms of capital spending, Mr Murray said about Pounds 800m would be
spent on CT2 and PCN (personal communications network) over the nest four to
five years. Hutchison's share of that will be about Pounds 500m. He
anticipated profit to flow from CT2 in two to three years and from PCN in
about five years.
Mr Li said while the initial operating losses in the start up phase of the
telecommunications businesses overseas will erode profits from the cellular
and paging businesses in Hong Kong, the potential of the company would be
realised in the long term.
