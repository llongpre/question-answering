   Sir David Lean, the 81-year-old English
director, says he thinks he's persuaded Marlon Brando to play a
brutish South American general in his next film.
   The movie is based on Joseph Conrad's novel ``Nostromo,'' the
story of how the lust for silver corrupts and destroys a host of
characters living in a fictional South American nation.
   ``I'm terribly excited because it looks very much as if we'll
have Marlon Brando in one of the parts,'' Lean told The New York
Times by telephone from London in an interview published Tuesday.
``I think he's probably the greatest film actor ever. I wanted him
for `Lawrence (of Arabia)' and for `Ryan's Daughter.'''
   Lean said the part for which he wants the reclusive Brando is
``a villain called Montero, which he can do off the back of his
hand and make it very interesting and rather funny, too.''
