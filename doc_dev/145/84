   Maj. Gen. Robert Urquhart, the British commander at
the heroic but ill-fated Battle of Arnhem who tried to capture a
bridge over the Rhine River, has died, his family reported today. He
was 87.
   Urquhart died Tuesday at his home at Port of Menteith, near
Stirling in his native Scotland. No cause of death was stated.
   As commander of the First Airborne Division, Urquhart was at the
forefront of the battle in September 1944 to capture a bridge over
the Rhine at Arnhem, the Netherlands.
   He survived many narrow escapes, and was portrayed by Sean
Connery in the 1977 movie ``A Bridge Too Far,'' which was based on
the battle.
   The battle was the climax of a U.S.-British operation to exploit
German disorganization following their retreat from Normandy,
France, after the Allied invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe in the
D-Day landings three months earlier.
   The plan aimed at ending the war in Europe before the end of
1944, thereby avoiding the Allies' long, conventional offensive with
which the war eventually ended in 1945.
   The plan was to capture five river and canal bridges in the
Netherlands to open a way for an armored advance into the north
German plain before the onset of winter.
   It required the American 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions to
capture bridges at Eindhoven and Nijmegen and the British First
Airborne Division to capture the one at Arnhem.
   Simultaneously with the parachute and glider landings, a ground
advance of 64 miles was planned by the British 30th Corps from the
Meuse-Escaut Canal along the same axis.
   The American operations succeeded. But the British, whose air
drops had to be staggered because of lack of sufficient aircraft,
encountered German forces and were able only to capture the north
end of the Arnhem bridge.
   The Germans, who had found plans of the entire operation on the
body of an American soldier shot down in a glider, heavily
out-gunned Urquhart's 10,000 troops.
   Bad weather and German assaults on the 30th Corps' advancing
armored column, meanwhile, denied relief for Urquhart's troops and
their airhead was steadily reduced.
   Urquhart and his men fought with heroic courage for nine days.
But with their ammunition and food virtually at an end, their
casualties rising rapidly and no hope of relief reaching them in
time, Urquhart ordered a break-out.
   There was no British surrender. A total of 2,163 of the 10,000
troops who landed at Arnhem fought their way to safety in the
American area, which the 30th Corps had consolidated. Another 1,350
were killed in the battle. The rest were taken prisoner.
   The failure to capture the Arnhem bridge was reported as ``a
bridge too short'' to bring victory.
   Urquhart narrowly escaped death when a German shell destroyed a
jeep he was about to use. On another occasion while he was in a
house, a German soldier appeared at a window. Before the German
could fire, Urquhart shot him dead.
   Later, while making a personal reconnaissance, Urquhart was cut
off from his own headquarters. He made his way back through enemy
fire so dense that at one stage he was given up for dead.
   A total of five Victoria Crosses, Britain's highest decoration
for bravery, were awarded after the battle among Urquhart's men.
   After the war, Urquhart became director general of the
Territorial Army, the British Army's part-time reserve, during its
reconstruction. He was later appointed commander of British forces
in British-ruled Malaya, which later became part of Malaysia, and
from 1952 until his retirement in 1955 was the commander of British
troops in Austria.
   He is survived by a wife, three daughters and a son. Their names
were not immediately available.
