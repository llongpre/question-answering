<LEADPARA>  TWENTY-FIVE movies, from David Lean's 1962 spectacular, "Lawrence of Arabia,"
to an obscure 1915 silent film titled "The Italian," were added Wednesday to
the Library of Congress' registry of film classics deemed worthy of
preservation.;   "We are not in the Oscar nomination business," said Librarian
of Congress James H. Billington. "The films we choose are not necessarily the
'best' American films of any kind ever made. But they are films that had and
will continue to have cultural, historical or aesthetic importance."  </LEADPARA>
