   Sir Anthony Quayle, a veteran actor-director of
the classical theater credited with helping launch the careers of
many British theater greats, has died of cancer. He was 76.
   Quayle died at his London home Friday, said his agent, Laurence
Evans.
   The self-effacing Quayle found Broadway fame as the detective
writer in ``Sleuth'' and was nominated for an Oscar for ``Anne of
the Thousand Days,'' in which he played Cardinal Wolsey.
   But his greatest legacy was his devotion to classical theater.
   In Stratford-on-Avon, Shakespeare's birthplace, Quayle headed
the Shakespeare Memorial Theater from 1948-1956. There, he raised
the standards of classical acting and helped along the careers of
Richard Burton, Robert Shaw, and Rachel Roberts, among others.
   He employed the major actor-knights of his generation _ the late
Laurence Olivier, the late Ralph Richardson, and John Gielgud _ and
turned Stratford into the touchstone by which Shakespearean
performance in Britain was measured.
   In 1985, Quayle himself was knighted.
   Director Peter Hall, who founded the Royal Shakespeare Company
in 1960, called Quayle ``a great man of the theater _ actor,
director, creator of companies.''
   Hall spoke through a spokeswoman at the Houston Grand Opera,
where he is rehearsing the opera ``New Year.''
   He said Quayle ``was largely responsible for the extraordinary
renaissance of the Stratford-on-Avon festival. ... He was a superb
leader with a passion for Shakespeare and with a great talent for
bringing the best out of people.''
   Quayle was a company man throughout his career, from the Old Vic
Theater in 1932 to Compass, the touring company he founded in 1984.
   ``I thought of myself as a rather funny-looking, rather large
fellow who would never be a matinee hero. So I went into classical
companies,'' he once remarked.
   In an interview with London's Independent newspaper last summer
he wondered whether he had not ``poured creativity into others at
the expense of my own.''
   Gielgud remembered him as ``very fair, very unbitchy, very
uninterested in gossip and always in a good humor, amusing and
understanding.''
   Over the years, his stage work spanned Shakespeare and Sheridan,
Bertolt Brecht and Francois Billetdoux.
   He was London's first Eddie Carbone in Arthur Miller's ``A View
From the Bridge'' and planned to participate in an American play,
``Never the Sinner,'' until illness required him to drop out before
rehearsals.
   He made his Broadway debut in 1956 in William Wycherley's ``The
Country Wife,'' but had his greatest success with ``Sleuth,''
Anthony Shaffer's two-character comedy thriller.
   The play, co-starring Keith Baxter, ran on Broadway for 1,222
performances, and producer Morton Gottleib remembered Quayle as ``a
wonderful actor.''
   ``There are some actors who have a certain personality and no
matter what the role is, that personality takes over the stage,''
Gottleib said. ``But Tony Quayle would fit into whatever the role
and characterization.''
   Quayle last appeared on Broadway opposite Mary Martin in the
short-lived 1978 play ``Do You Turn Somersaults?''
   His movie career was erratic. Quayle, a former paratrooper,
often found himself cast in war films, from ``Battle of the River
Plate'' and ``Operation Crossbow'' to ``The Guns of Navarone'' and
``HMS Defiant.''
   He appeared in David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia'' and Alfred
Hitchcock's ``The Wrong Man.'' his television credits included ``QB
VII,'' ``Masada,'' and ``Oedipus At Colonus.''
   He wrote two bestselling novels, ``Eight Hours From England''
(1945) and ``On Such A Night'' (1947), both based on his
experiences in World War II.
   He is survived by his second wife, Dorothy, an American actress,
two daughters and a son. His first marriage ended in divorce.
