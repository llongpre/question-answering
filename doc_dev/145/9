   A mass grave has been discovered
near the site where more than 100,000 Asian slave workers and
Allied prisoners died building a railroad for the Japanese during
World War II.
   The remains of several hundred people have been dug up since
Tuesday, when the excavation began. It is being carried out by the
Pothipawana Songkroh Foundation, which for religious reasons wants
to provide proper burials.
   Several dozen workers were digging Sunday in a sugar cane field
in Kanchanaburi province, about 70 miles west of Bangkok. One skull
was left out overnight - but workers first covered it with paper so
it would not be cold.
   About half the small plot has been excavated.
   The mass grave is about three miles from a bridge made famous in
the 1957 Hollywood movie, ``Bridge Over the River Kwai,'' which
celebrated the heroism of the war captives.
   A foundation official, Santi Assawaseeyotin, said it appeared
the bones had been ``dumped into the ground, because they were
found in some disorder.''
   Santi said the bones were dating back to the World War II era.
   ``We believe they were bones of Asian people as the skulls found
were not big,'' he said. ``There also were children's bones.''
   He said the remains were being brought to the foundation's
office in Bangkok, where they will be cleaned and cremated.
   There was no direct evidence the bones belonged to the World War
II prisoners. No such remains have been found in Kanchanaburi in
recent years.
   Also recovered were metal plates and bowls; on the back of
several were written Made in Japan or Made in Hong Kong. The
Bangkok Post newspaper said some had the year 1939 imprinted on
them.
   More than 100,000 Chinese, Indian, Malay, Burmese and other
Asian slave laborers lost their lives building the railway in
1942-43, along with more than 16,000 British, Dutch, Australian,
American, and New Zealand prisoners of war.
   They died of disease, malnutrition, exhaustion, beatings and
executions.
   The Japanese had the 268-mile line connecting Thailand and Burma
built for their planned invasion of India.
   Ladda Matcha, 38, who lives near the grave, said the owner of a
motorcyle repair shop also near there recently dreamed that the
dead told him they could not breathe and asked him for help.
   The man contacted the foundation, whose representatives secured
permission from the landowner to dig, Mrs. Ladda said. The owner
knew of the remains on her plot, but used it to grow sugar cane.
   Mrs. Ladda's mother, Pab Borngern, 77, said the Japanese
constructed a military camp and tunnel in the area during the war.
   ``When the Indians (workers) died, they just carried them into
the hole they dug up,'' she said. ``At the place where they found
the bones, that was thousands of people buried there. Those peple
died because of fever.''
   The Bangkok Post quoted the landowner's sister, Lek Pailom, 64,
as saying field hospitals for Asian slave workers were in the area.
   ``Every morning, the Indians dug a hole in this area to bury
dead bodies in the evening,'' she said. ``Some days, two or three
bodies were buried, some days more than five.''
   ``This happened throughout the period of the railway
construction,'' she said.
   The discovery of the remains came just before the annual 11-day
River Kwai Bridge Festival. This major tourist attraction of
special shows and exhibitions is scheduled to begin Friday.
   In March, Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan responded to
objections by Australian veterans groups and Prime Minister Bob
Hawke by barring shows that a tourism company planned along the
railway. They were to have featured Japanese soldiers supervising
work gangs.
