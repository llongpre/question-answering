FT  01 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 37m motorway improvement
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Secretary of State for Transport has awarded BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL
ENGINEERING the contract for the widening of the M6 motorway improvements
between junctions 30-32, in Lancashire, valued at Pounds 37.5m.
The works comprise the widening of the dual three-lane M6 motorway, between
junction 30, which is the interchange between the M6 and the M61 at Blacow
and junction 32 at the interchange between the M6 and the M55 at Broughton,
to dual four-lane motorway standard.
The work will be achieved by a combination of asymmetrical and parallel
widening with a short section of off-lane replacement.
Extensive environmental features include earth mounding and noise
attenuation measures.
Junctions 30 and 31 will be remodelled. Junction 31 is the junction of the
M6 with the A59 and will include the realignment of the trunk road and
roundabouts together with two new slip road bridges over the River Ribble.
A new underbridge, together with provision for new south facing slip road
stubs associated with a possible future junction 31A, are to be constructed.
In addition, 15 bridges will be either demolished, demolished and
reconstructed, widened and redecked or refurbished and extended. Hard
shoulders, which have discontinuities at all bridges, will be made
continuous throughout.
Scheduled for completion in December 1994, the project also involves new
lighting and motorway signalling erected on gantries.
The consulting engineer for the development is Rendel, Palmer and Tritton.
