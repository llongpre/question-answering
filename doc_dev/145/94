<LEADPARA>  Shops closed, residents streamed from the city, troops constructed last-minute
defenses and Baghdad watched the clock Tuesday, the eve of Iraq's
transformation from a country under diplomatic pressure to one that at any
moment could come under massive military attack.;    Except for a couple of
government-sponsored rallies, the city of 4.5 million was uncommonly quiet.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Stores on Rashid Street, a main thoroughfare, were shut, metal grills drawn
across their glass doors. Sidewalks in Jedariah, Masbah and Mansour, all
neighborhoods usually thronged with shoppers, were deserted.;    In occupied
Kuwait, Iraq made no move to order its troops from the sheikdom Tuesday,
defying the powerful American-led army that is poised in Saudi Arabia and the
Persian Gulf to drive them out.;    In the last day remaining before
expiration of the United Nations deadline for withdrawal, the rallies in
Baghdad and other cities were pointedly organized in support for President
Saddam Hussein, who has pledged to hold the annexed state at all costs.;   
"Leave Kuwait?" said Information Minister Latif Nassif Jassem, laughing.
"Kuwait is a province of Iraq and beyond discussion.";    Even in the Baghdad
shops that stayed open, there was an air of anticipation. "Now we will see,"
said Tarik Tahir, the owner of an antique shop near the book bazaar in
downtown Baghdad. "What does God will?";    Only along the placid Tigris
River, where open-air restaurants continued to serve the sweet river fish
mazgouf, a traditional favorite, were there signs of bustle.;    "I eat
mazgouf every Tuesday," said Omar abu Said, a businessman. "War or no war, I
have come for my fish.";    In contrast to the becalmed downtown, traffic
jammed roads leading out of the city, north to the towns of Mosul and
Sulamaniyah and southwest to Kerbala and Najef as the pace of individual
evacuations quickened. Orange and white taxis, private trucks and sedans,
battered buses -- all were jammed with passengers and packed with supplies of
flour, rice and cooking oil.;    "I'm just taking care of the house," said
Ibrahim Leithe, a restaurant worker who sat alone in the living room of his
family's home in Saddam City, a sprawling working-class satellite of Baghdad
named after the president. "Everyone went to Najef, but I have to stay to
stand guard.";    Saddam City boasts a well-known market that residents call
the Ali Baba Bazaar, after the mythical thief of "The Thousand and One
Nights.";    "The Ali Babas will be very happy because people are leaving and
the houses will be free for them," predicted Leithe, who sat beneath a wall
clock decorated with a smiling portrait of Saddam.;    New public works
projects indicated fears that Baghdad, as the center of government, will be
bombed by American jets. Mounds of dirt topped by anti-aircraft batteries have
been popping up around the city. New asphalt roads have been built down to the
banks of the Tigris eventually to be connected by makeshift bridges and
ferries in case the permanent bridges over the river are blasted away.;    At
one Baghdad rally, the crowds reacted with mixed enthusiasm.;    In the
well-to-do district of Mansour, with international television cameras looking
on, tens of thousands of bureaucrats and youngsters chanted "Kuwait is ours!"
and burned an effigy of President Bush.;    Cheerleaders whipped the crowd
into enthusiastic dances of defiance. In answer to a reporter's question, a
woman claimed to have five sons at the front in Kuwait and said she was
prepared to sacrifice them all to fight the U.S.-dominated forces poised to
strike from Saudi Arabia.;    In general, the mood among Baghdadis staying
behind was one of resignation, as if they were forced spectators at a contest
whose rules they don't understand.;    Said antique store owner Tahir, in a
typical comment: "This is a game between Bush and Saddam. It is far above our
heads."  </TEXT>
