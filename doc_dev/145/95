  [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio has condemned 
yesterday's terrorist act that destroyed the bridge over the San 
Juan River. De Leon Carpio said he did not want to think that 
the URNG [Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity] staged the 
attack because if they did, no one can rely on their political 
willingness to achieve peace in Guatemala. 
  The president confirmed that the damage has been estimated 
at 
1 million quetzals, including the demolition of the structure, 
installation of a Bailey bridge today, and construction of a new 
bridge.
