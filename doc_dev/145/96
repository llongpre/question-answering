The first people to practise eugenics (compulsory sterilisation to improve
the population) were the Nazis, right? Wrong. According to Channel 4's
Secret History it was the Americans who first ran a programme in Virginia
which was copied by Hitler.
The over-flying of Soviet territory during the cold war and the
photographing of Russian missile sites from very high spy planes was a habit
limited to the Americans. True? False. According to Timewatch on BBC2 the
American president told his military chiefs to stop it, so they got the RAF
to do it for them. All of a sudden you begin to understand just how special
the Special Relationship may have been.
Vladimir Pozner, the oh-so-charming apologist for hardline communism who
used to be wheeled into television studios by the politburo to use his
fluent New York English to pooh-pooh any suggestion of totalitarian
tendencies in the Soviet state (dissenters locked in asylums? Phooey]) was
presumably a favourite son of the Kremlin? On the contrary, Arena on BBC2
revealed that the Russian authorities distrusted him so much they would not
even allow him on Soviet television.
Formal apartheid, with the state setting up separate bodies to do the same
job, each staffed exclusively by people of one skin colour, is a policy
peculiar to South Africa? No: Network First on ITV recently told the
fascinating story of the USAF's 332nd Fighter Group, an all-black outfit
which, during the second world war, fought from segregated bases.
So the revision of history goes on. No doubt it always has, first by word of
mouth, then via the printed word. Pretty clearly most academic historians
still believe that the right and proper way to publicise new research or
circulate newly released material is via the article in the learned journal
or book. Yet the extent to which television is becoming a force in history
is unmistakable. A serious force? Hard to say, but certainly a popular
force.
When I was a boy it was not books but the cinema which taught us that the
bridge on the River Kwai, and by extension the Burma Railway, were built by
Allied prisoners of war; and that one of the greatest triumphs of that war
was the raid by the RAF's 617 Squadron on the Ruhr dams. Recent television
programmes have revealed that many of the men who built the Burma Railway
were enslaved Asians from Japanese occupied territories; and that while the
Dambusters did indeed smash a hole in the Moehne dam they failed completely
with the Sorpe. Since the very essence of this attack was that the Moehne
and Sorpe should be breached simultaneously, it is not merely parenthetic
that the Sorpe raid failed  - and failed because Barnes Wallis, inventor of
the bouncing bomb and boffin hero of the famous movie, miscalculated what it
would take to crack the massive earth embankments of the Sorpe. They proved
far stronger than the concrete curtain of the Moehne.
It is not hard to find people who deeply resent uppity young television
producers practising this sort of revisionism. Question the strategic value
of the dams raid and its cost in Allied lives, and you are poking holes in a
previously seamless web of patriotic pride. Yet it is surely better in the
end to know the truth . . . or at least to have it made available by a
programme such as Chris Haws' Secret History.
This was not one of those programmes that simply turn received wisdom upside
down or pour scorn on the fond beliefs of old men. It was more subtle than
that, acknowledging the propaganda value of the raid, and giving an account
of it that was considerably more complicated than that provided by the 1954
film. By interviewing the aircrew of the Lancaster bomber F for Freddie,
Haws and his director Alex Beetham brought out more vividly than any cinema
production the courage and compassion of the men who flew on such missions.
I shall not quickly forget the account by one of Freddie's crew of how it
felt to watch your friends in the Lancaster alongside you being shot down,
nor the thoughts upon looking down after the Moehne was breached and seeing
car headlights disappear under the flooding water. It is this sort of
personal witness - absent from movies and far less effective in print -
which brings such power to television's version of history. That is
doubtless what makes many academics so deeply uneasy. Just as Mary
Whitehouse believes herself immune to all that sex and violence that she so
selflessly monitors although it corrupts the rest of us, so historians
believe that only they are equipped to construe the evidence soberly from
history's witnesses. Not so. They may be more expert, but if television can
offer it to all of us direct, we should have the chance to see for
ourselves.
Of course there can be drawbacks to this steady increase in the volume of
televised history. The producers may be so determined to leave no
heartstring untugged, as with last week's Secret History on that American
eugenics scheme, 'The Lynchburg Story', that they end up with a programme
that feels more like fiction than fact. Here we had the commentary delivered
in stage whisper by an actress who sounded as though she might break into
sobs at any moment. As cameras panned around the empty rooms of the home
where candidates for sterilisation were held we were treated to mood music
worthy of Brief Encounter. In a story of this sort nothing is more moving
than the appalling truth.
More serious, more common, and far more difficult to overcome is the problem
faced by the makers of The Underworld, BBC1's new series about organised
crime in Britain (mainly London) since 1945. This comes to us with anxious
disclaimers about glamorising criminals which is, of course, precisely what
it does. Matters are not helped by interviewing grizzly safe crackers or
gangsters complete with year-round suntans and smart lightweight clothing on
Mediterranean locations: that sort of glamorisation could easily have been
avoided. What is almost impossible to overcome is the absence of documentary
material at the heart of these men's activities.
It is all very well to see someone sawing a chunk off a teeny little modern
starting handle and to hear the villain explaining how they used a
rubber-covered length (of a whacking great 1950s starting handle) to cosh
innocent people, but that is no substitute for actually seeing the mayhem.
What we get from these programmes is a succession of old men, keen not to
leave too bad an impression for posterity. What television needs, but of
course lacks, is some vivid footage of virile young thugs beating bank
messengers to the ground or terrorising innocent members of the public. We
need to see burgled citizens explaining at the time how it felt to have
their homes and furniture smashed to bits and then to be robbed.
What matters most in the end is the intention, integrity and intelligence of
the programme maker. We know from such magnificent series as All Our Working
Lives, End Of Empire and A Secret World Of Sex that detailed social history
is possible on television, even if political history tends to be easier.
Furthermore, programme makers are going to find richer and richer seams
because the archives are growing all the time: television itself will
eventually be the richest repository of our history.
