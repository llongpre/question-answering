   Pianist Van Cliburn, who has performed
before highbrow audiences in some of the world's great concert
halls, can add Cornhusker football fans and Nebraska's Memorial
Stadium to the list.
   Cliburn performed the national anthem before the
Nebraska-Minnesota game Saturday at the request of his old friend
D.B. ``Woody'' Varner, the former University of Nebraska president.
   ``I'm just extremely flattered to be here,'' Cliburn said.
   The musician said he met Varner more than 25 years ago when
Varner, then chancellor of Oakland University in Rochester, Mich.,
helped build a performing arts center there.
   Although Cliburn said he had not played the piano before a
football game before, he is no stranger to the sport.
   ``I was a clarinet player in the Kilgore (Texas) High School
marching band,'' he said. ``I have loved football all my life and
have marched in many games.''

   CAPRI, Italy (AP) - President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia
received Italy's Malaparte Prize on Sunday for his work as a
playwright during his country's hard-line Communist years.
   The prize is named for Curzio Malaparte, an Italian journalist
and short-story writer who died in 1957. Previous winners include
Arthur Miller and Samuel Beckett.
   ``His theatrical works are of great value,'' said the award's
jurors. ``They originate from his life experience in a totalitarian
system but they always deal with the universal problems of man.''
   Havel accepted the award during a ceremony at the Santa Teresa
church on this island in the Gulf of Naples.

   DALLAS (AP) - Director Peter Bogdanovich said making the sequel
to the 1971 hit movie ``The Last Picture Show'' was more work than
fun.
   ``I wouldn't have been able to make this picture 20 years ago,''
said Bogdanovich, who attended the movie's premiere here Saturday.
``I wouldn't have known how to direct it. You need a little
experience to make a picture with this big a canvas.''
   It was a more depressing experience for Cybill Shepherd, who
reprised her role as Jacy Farrow. Her character comes home to
grieve the loss of her 6-year-old son.
   ``Being the mother of three, it was very, very painful and very
difficult,'' she said of the role. The 1971 film made Miss Shepherd
a star.
   The sequel, based on the novel by Larry McMurtry, also reunited
Jeff Bridges, Randy Quaid and Cloris Leachman.

   FORTE DEI MARMI, Italy (AP) - American cartoonist Garry Trudeau

literature.

Forte dei Marmi Prize for satire. Vidal, best known for his
historical novels ``Burr'' and ``Lincoln,'' received the literary
award for his book ``Hollywood.''
   The two received their awards Saturday in this town near Lucca
in Tuscany.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Actor Beau Bridges will portray James Brady
in a TV movie about the former White House press secretary severely
wounded in the 1981 assassination attempt on President Reagan.
   ``The James Brady Story'' will chronicle Brady's rise to press
secretary and the March 30, 1981 assassination attempt in
Washington, D.C., by John Hinckley, said Robert Cooper, senior vice
president for HBO Pictures.
   The David Puttnam-Enigma production will begin filming in
November in Houston and Washington, and debut on HBO in spring
1991.
   The movie was written by Robert Bolt, winner of best screenplay
Academy Awards for ``Dr. Zhivago'' and ``A Man for All Seasons.''
Michael Uno, who directed HBO's ``Vietnam War Story,'' will direct
the Brady movie.
   Bridges won a National Society of Film Critics award for his
recent role in ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.'' He also was featured in
the movies ``The Other Side of the Mountain,'' ``Greased
Lightning,'' ``Norma Rae,'' and ``The Hotel New Hampshire.''
