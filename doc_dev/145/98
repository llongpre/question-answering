  [Excerpts] Zagreb, Feb 23 (AFP) -- A French unit of the UN 
Protection Force [UNPROFOR] is to be deployed Wednesday around a 
bridge on the border between Croatia and Bosnia blocked by about 
100 secessionist Serbs for almost a week, UNPROFOR said here. 
Two contingents of UN troops, comprising Jordanians and 
Argentines, were placed on alert Tuesday because of mounting 
tension at the site. 
  About 100 Serb police and soldiers have held the bridge over 
the River Sava since they overpowered a UN control post manned 
by Nepalese troops on Friday. The bridge links the Croatian 
town of Stara Gradiska and the Bosnian town of Bosanska Gradiska. 
  The UN secretary general's special envoy in ex-Yugoslavia 
Yasushi Akashi viewed the Serbs' seizure of the bridge as 
"unacceptable" and was exploring "various ways" to end the 
stand-off, UNPROFOR said in a statement. [passage omitted] 
  UNPROFOR meanwhile reported "repeated attempts" Tuesday to 
shell the strategic Maslenica Bridge in southern Croatia, 
without saying which side was responsible. It said this 
constituted "one of the most serious violations" of the 
ceasefire concluded in mid-December by the Croatian Army and 
secessionist Serbs. 
  Croatian media Wednesday accused secessionists from Krajina 
of having bombed the Meslenica area Tuesday, wounding two people. 
  The Maslenica bridge, which the Croatian Army recaptured 
from 
Serb secessionists during an offensive in January 1993, is vital 
to Croatia because it links the ex-Yugoslav republic's northern 
and southern parts.
