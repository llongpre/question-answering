   British rock star Sting announced the
start of a worldwide campaign to raise funds for creation of South
America's largest native Indian reservation.
   Sting, along with Indian chiefs Raoni and Megaron of the
Txukahamae tribe, has created the Virgin Forest foundation that will
financially support a government Indian agency's efforts to expand a
reserve.
   The reserve, which covers 6.18 million acres inhabited by 2,700
Indians in 17 tribes, would be enlarged by nearly 29 million acres.
   The rock singer said Wednesday the foundation would be apolitical.
   ``We don't want to interfere in the country's internal affairs,''
Sting said.
   He said he would travel with Raoni and Megaron to France,
Belgium, West Germany, Italy, Spain, England, the United States,
Canada and Japan and make television appearances to raise funds for
the organization.
   ``We need to capture the imagination of the whole world,'' Sting
said.

   Theodor Geisel, who delights children of
all ages under the pen name Dr. Seuss, would have preferred that his
85th birthday today passed unnoticed. But the mail brings hundreds
of reminders daily.
   ``It's a beating. They come in by the hundreds, by the thousands
from every school in the country, or so it seems,'' he said of the
birthday greetings. ``I try to answer most of them. They're all
special efforts. They usually make a school project out of it.''
   Geisel, who lives in La Jolla, said he planned a quiet
celebration.
   The creator of such classics as ``The Cat in the Hat'' and
``Green Eggs and Ham'' said he is working on another book as well as
on an animated film version of his ``Butter Battle Book,'' a parable
for the nuclear age published three years ago.

   Actress Lynn Redgrave says film and
television producers continue denying her employment because she
sued MCA Inc. almost eight years ago.
   ``People don't very much like somebody like me who will actually
stand up and say, `There's been a wrong done and you've got to stop
it,' '' the 45-year-old actress said Wednesday at a news conference.
``It's absolutely amazing how lies and falsehoods can stick.''
   Miss Redgrave's $10 million lawsuit, which was dismissed, stemmed
from her ouster in 1981 from the CBS comedy ``House Calls.'' She
said she was fired for breast-feeding her newborn daughter on the
set. The studio said she left in a salary dispute.
   She said that while she has been unable to obtain steady work in
the United States, she did star in three British movies last year
and has made several commercials.

   Donald Trump says the fashion-model wife of a
tycoon whose publications have bashed his development projects asked
him out for a date.
   But Allison Stern, wife of Leonard Stern, dismissed Trump's claim
as the false ``product of ajuvenile mind.''
   The Trump-Mrs. Stern date-or-no-date exchange was triggered by a
profile of Trump in Sunday's New York Daily News, which quoted an
unidentified source about the alleged invitation. On Monday, Stern
accused Trump of planting the rumor.
   Trump, who is married, responded: ``Leonard Stern understands
exactly what's going on. He knows. He knows. ... Maybe he should
speak to his wife.'' He added later, ``Allison called for a date.
... and I wasn't interested.''
   Mrs. Stern fired back: ``This absurd charge ... is totally false
and designed by him to inhibit and intimidate my husband's
publications _ The Village Voice and 7 Days _ from covering Mr.
Trump's public activities. As in the past, his unethical tactics
will fail.''

   Author Chet Flippo, longtime friend of slain
Beatle John Lennon, said he's surprised by ``parasitic, would-be
tell-all books'' about Lennon.
   ``Because John was always pretty much an open book, there didn't
seem to be much call for any amplification of his life,'' Flippo
wrote in this week's TV Guide.
   Flippo, author of ``Yesterday,'' the unauthorized biography of
ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, was particularly critical of Albert
Goldman's ``The Lives of John Lennon.''
   He called Goldman's assessment of Lennon's life with Yoko Ono and
son Sean ``pure junk, as far as I know. ... John was certainly no
angel. Most of the time he was much worse. Which is to say, he was
perfectly human.''

   Country-western singer and producer Cliffie
Stone celebrated his 72nd birthday with a star _ one with his name
on it.
   Stone's star _ the 1,887th on the Hollywood Walk of Fame _ was
placed at Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street, an appropriate spot, he
said Wednesday, because he once worked for music businesses near the
intersection.
   Stone, who has been host of 8,000 radio shows and produced or
been host of more than 6,000 television shows, began his recording
career playing bass fiddle in Stuart Hamblen's band.

   The Duchess of York attended the charity premiere
of the movie ``Return From The River Kwai'' and met actor Edward Fox
and two old soldiers whose World War II exploits form part of the
movie.
   The movie tells, in part, the story of Wilfred Barnett, 67, and
William Stones, 68, who endured years building the notorious
Burma-Siam railway as prisoners of the Japanese. Later, while being
shipped to Japan, their convoy was bombed by the Allies and they
were cast adrift on a raft for five days.
   The former Sarah Ferguson, who is married to Prince Andrew, told
Barnett and Stones at Wednesday night's premiere that she had read
about their exploits.
   Proceeds from the premiere went to the Royal Academy of Arts.
