   We read with interest Raymond Sokolov's article on the
demise of Jennifer Bartlett's design for South Gardens at
Battery Park City at Manhattan's southern tip (Leisure &amp;
Arts, Oct. 16). As landscape architects for the Battery Park
City Master Plan and Phases I and II of the esplanade, we
agree with your writer Patti Hagan's assessment that the
gardens were inappropriate and unworkable.
   We should like to point out, however, that Mr. Sokolov's
article may have given the mistaken impression that Lynden B.
Miller had done the redesign of Bryant Park, behind the New
York Public Library. The new restoration work is based upon
designs by Hanna/Olin Ltd., the landscape architectural firm
retained by the Bryant Park Restoration Corp. in 1985. Since
that time, Hanna/Olin has been the prime landscape
architectural consultant for all aspects of the redesign and
restoration of the park. Ms. Miller is designing and
implementing one aspect of that restoration, the perennial
gardens. She is an excellent plants person and garden
designer, and has done an exemplary job in the restoration of
the Central Park Conservatory Gardens and new plantings
within the Central Park Zoo.

   The goal of opening up the system of walls and hedges
mentioned in the article is but one of several proposed by
our office in 1986 that are based in part on research
previously performed by William H. Whyte and the Project for
Public Spaces. These include: increased visibility into the
park, increased circulation within the park, enhancement of
the formal French landscape design, increased public seating
and increased security.
