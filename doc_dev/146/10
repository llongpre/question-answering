<P>
The problem of designing a large theater has challenges similar to those in 
creating a convention center: A large, boxy space must somehow be concealed 
within a graceful shell. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Arthur Erickson, using repetitive, bold forms in concrete, has made 
the gigantic new San Diego Convention Center a fine piece of design. His 
excellent exterior detailing makes this building attractive to those arriving 
by car or foot. 
</P>
<P>
It's a landmark downtown project for downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Architects Moore Ruble Yudell haven't been nearly as successful in their design 
of the second phase of Escondido's Civic Center, a $55.4-million complex that 
includes 1,500- and 400-seat theaters for stage productions. 
</P>
<P>
The final design for the project, to be built in Grape Day Park downtown, which 
includes the new City Hall completed in 1988, was unanimously approved by the 
Escondido City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
The city hopes to break ground next fall, with completion expected in 1993. In 
addition to the theaters, the project will have an arts complex and a community 
meeting center. 
</P>
<P>
Although the architects have created wonderful outdoor spaces, the bulky 
100-foot-tall "fly tower," which houses the mechanical equipment above the 
stage, sticks out like a sore thumb, unbroken by architectural detailing or 
other visual devices that could make it attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Other potential problems include jarring combinations of roof treatments and a 
confusing variety of window and wall treatments used in an attempt to break 
down the main theater's mass. There is also 
</P>
<P>
a possibility that the Civic Center complex will have insufficient daytime 
attractions -- food stands, recreation and other forms of enjoyment -- to make 
the park a success as a people place. 
</P>
<P>
Months of refining should have resulted in a well-composed treatment of the big 
box that will house the necessary stage equipment over the main theater; at 100 
feet, this "fly tower" will be the Civic Center's tallest, most massive 
feature. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the theater, at least as depicted in model form, will sit hard by 
Escondido Boulevard, bulk unbroken by details that could tie it to the rest of 
the Civic Center complex -- it's flat roof setting it oddly apart from the 
pavilion or gable roofs used on the rest of the new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Project architect Renzo Zecchetto admitted that softening the impact of this 
looming box was the architects' single toughest challenge. Instead of calling 
attention to this mass with architectural fussiness, the designers elected to 
place most of the design interest at the middle level of this and the other 
buildings in the second phase of the Civic Center project. Groups of small 
windows, varied wall angles and assorted architectural detailing will break 
these facades into forms a human can get close to without feeling overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, instead of causing the larger theater's bulk to fade into the background, 
the lack of detailing up high only makes it stick out like the proverbial sore 
thumb, at least on the model. 
</P>
<P>
But the architects aren't finished yet, Zecchetto said. City officials and 
community leaders have expressed a desire for some softening of the theater's 
harsh mass. Options include a screening wall in front of the building's 
prominent northern face, detailing on the building wall itself or a system of 
vine-covered trellises and palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
Zecchetto said the architects favor the last approach, partly because it is 
most economical. 
</P>
<P>
At this stage of the design game, though, when at least a year has already gone 
into the project, one expects a more polished design solution. 
</P>
<P>
Other aspects of the architecture are also disappointing. The choice of roof 
forms is puzzling. Some roofs will have the traditional pitched form, while 
others, as on a few small towers, will be flat. Sometimes, the flat towers 
don't merge well with the slanted roofs nearby. 
</P>
<P>
It is difficult, though, to make a final pronouncement on these roofs. The 
material hasn't been chosen, and could make the actual buildings look much 
different than a cardboard model. Flat tiles or a seamed metal are among the 
options being considered. 
</P>
<P>
There is other evidence the architects didn't arrive at a totally coherent 
design vision, the type of consistency which makes the new City Hall by Pacific 
Associates Planners and Architects of San Diego such a success. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians won't notice from the ground level, but there's something jarring 
about the way the big theater's northern wall drops from a flat roof on top to 
a slanted roof above the first floor, with twin buttresses flying above it. 
</P>
<P>
Along Escondido Boulevard, the architects have softened the theater's mass with 
many combinations of windows and wall forms, but the array of shapes and angles 
seems jarring, at least on the model. 
</P>
<P>
At the level of the pedestrian, the architects appear to have done their 
strongest design work. 
</P>
<P>
All along, the design of the entire Civic Center complex, including City Hall, 
has been driven by its location in the 17-acre Grape Day Park, Escondido's 
miniature Balboa Park, a huge chunk of open space in the heart of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The intention was always to keep this setting park-like, even with the addition 
of several new buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Moore Ruble Yudell responded by pushing their buildings to the edges of the 
property, near the streets, preserving the interior as open space. A walk 
through the complex should prove to be an interesting stroll between the 
various plazas and courtyards. 
</P>
<P>
The main entrance to the new theater complex will be off Escondido Boulevard on 
the western edge of the project. Here, a wide plaza of slightly ascending 
levels will lead pedestrians in between the large theater to the north and the 
nearby community theater, set behind a pergola at Escondido Boulevard and 
Valley Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
Pergolas here and elsewhere are the same sort of vine-covered 
column-and-trellis outdoor walkways that became legendary San Diego architect 
Irving Gill's trademark early this century. Some even use arches like the ones 
Gill favored. The pergolas, with many rows of trees, will soften the experience 
of entering the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Every building has at least one courtyard related to it; most have several. 
Some are intended to be used for various gatherings. A courtyard off the back 
of the smaller theater could become an outdoor performance space, Zecchetto 
said. Eventually, he hopes the city will have the money to add doors to the 
back of this theater's stage so that it can open to the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from the architecture, a larger concern has to do with the programming of 
the Civic Center complex, the kinds of uses selected for this public park. City 
Hall and theaters will dominate the site, with the community meeting building 
and arts complex as secondary uses. What will the new complex offer the person 
who comes to the park in search of a recreational or cultural experience during 
daylight hours? 
</P>
<P>
A library might have been a good choice, but the city had already built a new 
one three blocks away at 2nd Avenue and Kalmia Street in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
There are no now concrete plans for the kinds of things that make Balboa Park a 
success: food pushcarts, small cafes, a variety of spontaneous performers and 
many choices of exhibitions, performances, films and museums. 
</P>
<P>
Both Zecchetto and Rolf Gunnarson, assistant executive director of Escondido's 
Community Development Commission, say they have considered such ideas. A small 
food outlet and bar in the lobby of the larger theater might be open during 
daylight hours, and a kitchen in the community meeting building could be used 
to produce food for park visitors, not just for meetings within the building. 
Food vendors are also a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
These kinds of people-oriented uses will be essential to animating the 
well-planned outdoor spaces, which will undoubtedly by the new complex's 
triumph.
