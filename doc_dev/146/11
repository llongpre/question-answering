<TEXT>     The city staff is recommending that one of Vallette's favorite trees -- a
copper beech -- be planted in his memory at one of his favorite places in the
city -- Shinn Park.;    "We feel it will be a nice addition," said Catherine
McKenzie, a city analyst. "Presently, there are none growing at any city
park.";    Vallette, a member of the Fremont Planning Commission and the
historical architectural review board, helped prepare the Shinn Park master
plan, which includes an arboretum.;    The historic Shinn ranch was one of the
first nurseries in California, and many of Fremont's 80,000 trees can trace
their ancestry to the Shinn operation. Some of the trees at the park are more
than 100 years old.;    Vallette owned and operated his own landscape
architecture business in Fremont for more than 25 years and taught landscaping
at West Valley College in Saratoga.;    Dedicating trees to people is rare in
Fremont, said city spokeswoman Karen George. The only record she could find
was the dedication of a 32-tree Central Park grove in 1969 by the family of
Jay Gomez.; WATER, MONEY FLOW: Speaking of trees, the landscaping price tag
for the Alameda County Water District project on Mission Boulevard near
Interstate 680 will top $200,000. But it includes a sidewalk, planting of
mature trees and a demonstration garden to show developers and property owners
how to landscape in a desertlike environment, district General Manager Jim
Beard said. The fee for the landscape architect, Andrea Lucas and Associates,
is $11,650 of that.;    Once the landscaping is in -- sometime this spring --
the big job begins. In back of the landscaping and wall already built in
Mission San Jose will go a $30 million, 21-million-gallon-a-day water
treatment plant that will cover the area's needs to the year 2010. Southern
Alameda County's water comes 50 percent from wells, with the rest coming from
the San Francisco Water Department and the California Aqueduct.; MORE ON
TREES: A new Fremont outlet on Albrae Street for the San Jose-based Tire
Service Co. (its first outside Santa Clara County) is involved in a plan to
plant 150 oak trees next month at Shoreline Park in Mountain View. James
D'Amico, the company president, said that part of the proceeds from a recent
tire sale will pay for the project overseen by the 6-month-old Treedom Inc.
The tree-planting group was founded by two San Francisco businessmen, Gary
Cohn and Adam Snitzer. Snitzer said they hope to plant 10,000 trees in
California this year. He said that Treedom is looking for local groups to help
plant trees. For more information on Treedom, call 1-800-TREEDOM.; NAMES,
NAMES, NAMES: Jim Fallon, the Fremont attorney running for school board,
celebrated the new year by falling in his tub and breaking a shoulder bone. He
said he may be lame for a month but he plans to run a regular campaign. The
other candidates, Joseph Neff, an engineer; Marianne Schumaker, a
small-business owner and incumbent Vernon Smith at last report were well.
Smith, by the way, was appointed to fill out term of Jim Klent, who appears on
the ballot even though he resigned in November. If voters "retain" Klent,
Smith will keep the job . . . Here are the nominees in the humanitarian
endeavors category for the outstanding service awards given by the Fremont
Human Relation Commission: Gerry Beemiller, Ed Campbell, Kathy DiVita, Larry
Epstein, Margaret Hsu, Harry McLane and Sharon Sarris. Group or business
nominees are the Candlelighters, Mervyn's, Permanently Yours, Shoeber's
Athletic Club, Tri-City Volunteers and Winchester Copy Center.  </TEXT>
