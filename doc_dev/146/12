ARCHITECTURE: THE LANDSCAPE AS A PARABLE

Amid the din of traffic and buzz of busy sidewalks, landscape architects Pamela 
Burton and Katherine Spitz take refuge in the tranquillity of a tiny downtown 
park they designed on Spring Street. 
</P>
<P>
"In this very urban space we've called upon metaphor, narrative and journey to 
evoke a special sense of place," Burton says. 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, this new vest-pocket park, named the Broadway Spring Center, 
celebrates Biddy Mason, a nurse, midwife and former slave who, a century ago, 
opened a refuge for black families at this location. A mural at the park's 
entrance memorializes Mason's long and charitable life. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, because the graceful 1893 Bradbury Building backs onto the park, 
this urban space evokes the memory of Spring Street and Broadway in their 
social and commercial glory in the first decades of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Predating the architecture and the street itself is the recollection of the 
country lane in the midst of a cow pasture that later became Spring Street, 
once Los Angeles' main financial thoroughfare. Burton explains that the grove 
of camphor trees in the center of the park "narrates" the site's country lane 
origins. 
</P>
<P>
A fountain -- composed of a series of pipes constructed of copper, stainless 
steel and concrete -- mimics the profile of an oil refinery, a metaphor for the 
industries that funded the city's early prosperity. The present is represented 
by the small retail outlets lining the park, businesses that represent 
Broadway's resurgence as a commercial hub, this time serving Los Angeles' 
Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
Their imaginative emphasis on metaphor, narrative and journey has placed Burton 
and Spitz among the leaders of a new wave of younger designers who are 
rethinking the role of landscape architecture in relation to the city. From 
their small office in a brick building in the industrial section of Santa 
Monica, the two women have collaborated with some of Southern California's most 
avant-garde architects. 
</P>
<P>
Morphosis' Thom Mayne says he "likes the way Burton and Spitz deal with 
landscape as a set of emotional and intellectual ideas. They're are no longer 
mere pretty horticulturists supplying plants, but actual conceptualizers of the 
urban scene, and their concepts are deeply poetic, like the best architecture. 
Since both Pamela and Kathy were trained as architects as well as landscape 
designers, they understand how we think and so can integrate their ideas 
seamlessly with ours." 
</P>
<P>
The architects at Morphosis collaborated with Burton and Spitz on the winning 
entry for the Performing Arts Pavilion in the proposed Arts Park in the 
Sepulveda Basin. The plans call for most of the complex to be underground, "to 
preserve the integrity of the surface plane and honor the urban grid that 
dominates the Valley," Mayne said. 
</P>
<P>
Working with Barton Myers Associates in the design of the Cerritos Community 
Arts Center, Burton and Spitz helped knit the architecture with its 
surroundings by creating "outdoor rooms" such as an Actors' Garden, which 
expresses its dramatic metaphor in a symbolic "tragic" weeping willow and a 
"comic" monkey puzzle tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Burton and Spitz create landscapes as parables," said BMA principal Jonathan 
Hankin. "Their depth of thought is wonderful and adds great resonance to the 
architecture." 
</P>
<P>
For their entry in the Napa Valley Domaine Clos Pegase Winery competition, with 
architect Robert Mangurian and sculptor James Turrell, Burton and Spitz devised 
a Garden of Seven Mysteries that included a "Devil's Chase" and several "Spirit 
Mounds." The purpose of these landscape elements was "to symbolize the 
transition between day-to-day consciousness and the states of dreams, 
disturbances and ecstasies that wine provokes," according to the text that 
accompanied their submission. 
</P>
<P>
Trained as a painter before she became an architect and then a landscape 
architect, Spitz is accustomed to the use of visual metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask, 'What are our myths?' That is always the first question," she 
said. "In Los Angeles we have the myth of the wilderness fused with an overlay 
of settlement expressed in landscape patterns imported from Spain, Italy, 
England and Japan. We have to experiment with the tensions this juxtaposition 
generates, and feel our way through at last to a truly local urban tradition. 
Developing our own landscape is vital to creating our own sense of identity in 
this strange and unique environment." 
</P>
<P>
Appropriately enough, Spitz first met Burton in Pistoia, Italy's nursery-garden 
capital. A native New Yorker, Spitz had worked in a Los Angeles plant nursery 
while still a student. Burton, who was born in Santa Monica but grew up in the 
Bay Area, was employed by Frank Gehry as a model builder before she qualified 
as an architect (and later a landscape architect), and these varied backgrounds 
seemed to both partners to mesh perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
"We love working together, though we often disagree vehemently to the point of 
verbally duking it out," Spitz said. "Pamela provokes the confrontation, while 
my way is to sulk. It's a great way to get on." 
</P>
<P>
Burton and Spitz are in total agreement about the need to develop a truly local 
landscape philosophy for Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
They say that three main principles should form the basis of this regional 
philosophy: appropriateness; a vision of landscape as a true form of 
architecture, and an appreciation of the symbolic value of plants. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriateness demands that local landscape, now dominated by a "salad" of 
imported varieties from all over the world, should shift to patterns based on 
the region's native chaparral such as the manzanita and native live oak. As a 
form of architecture, landscape should be used to define spaces and knit 
buildings to the terrain to provide "direction, function and aesthetic 
pleasure." And as an appreciation of the symbolic value of plants, horticulture 
should be linked to its history, including its ancient or contemporary 
mythologies. 
</P>
<P>
"By consciously calling upon these symbolic values," Burton said, "landscapes 
can work at conceptual and metaphoric levels as well as the purely 
horticultural." 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles' fragmented urban sprawl Burton and Spitz perceive an urgent 
need to "reinforce connections." They suggest that major boulevards, such as 
Olympic, should be developed as linear gardens scaled to the movement of cars. 
"The automobile is a permanent part of our urban landscape, and has played a 
major role in giving shape to the city," Spitz said. "Yet few landscape 
architects have given thought to the ways in which we can make the experience 
of motoring through the city more pleasurable while taming the car and tuning 
it into the visual rhythms of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Such linear gardens need to be varied, the designers explain. Our endless 
boulevards pass through many different districts, and each stretch should be 
keyed to the character of its surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
As an example, Burton points to the section of San Vicente Boulevard that runs 
through Brentwood, marked by a central median planted with South African coral 
trees. She suggests that, by these distinctions, motorists as well as 
pedestrians are made aware of the contrasts between one part of town and 
another. 
</P>
<P>
Underlying such specific concepts, Burton and Spitz sense an urgent need to use 
landscape as a means to create a sense of comfort and meaning amid the stress 
and confusion of a modern metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
They quote UC Berkeley urban sociologist Clare Cooper Marcus to express the 
core of their philosophy: "Under the inexorable march of technology and urban 
growth, and the increasing sense of insecurity these advances bring in their 
wake, people yearn for a place to call home in a world in which almost everyone 
is in a sense homeless."
