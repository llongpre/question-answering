<P>
Developer Neil Senturia, a former television sitcom writer, is about to spring 
some high drama on the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia wants the city to approve a 325-foot-high building in the historic 
Gaslamp Quarter downtown, an area zoned for a maximum of 125 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
Several key people within the city's urban planning system are opposed to the 
project's height, including City Architect Mike Stepner; Max Schmidt, Centre 
City Development Corp.'s urban planning expert, and Pam Hamilton, CCDC's 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
During the coming months, Senturia will try to persuade the City Council to go 
against the advice of its top planners, arguing that the design fits in with 
nearby high-rises. Going against aides' advice would not be unprecedented. Last 
year, the council approved a 38-story luxury condominium project on lower 
Broadway, despite Stepner's reservations about its height and bulk. 
</P>
<P>
Some council members said they won't make a decision until they get a good look 
at Senturia's project, probably this summer, after an environmental impact 
report is completed. 
</P>
<P>
The site Senturia has optioned (he doesn't own it yet) for the project, Park 
Plaza, is bounded by 5th Avenue, K Street, 3rd Avenue and Harbor Drive, at the 
southern entrance to the Gaslamp Quarter across from the San Diego Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
The $75-million complex would include 25,000 square feet of retail space and 
150 
</P>
<P>
condominiums. The building would have a six-story base and a 27-story tower, 
set close to K Street and 100 feet back from 5th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia, a short, wiry, articulate, gregarious man and a preference for crisp 
dress shirts and well-polished shoes, has been working as a developer in San 
Diego since 1985. Some of his projects include the Union Bank building at 5th 
and University avenues in Hillcrest, One Harbor Drive (a pair of 41-story 
downtown luxury condo towers scheduled to break ground June 15), a single-room 
occupancy hotel at 4th Avenue and Fir Street and a large parking structure 
being built on 6th Avenue, between A and Ash streets downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia laid out his argument for Park Plaza last Friday in his offices in a 
downtown high-rise, where he enjoys sweeping views of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The project has already gone through many design revisions. Senturia initially 
worked with Arquitectonica, the hip, slick, Miami firm, but its design 
apparently didn't please either Senturia or city officials. 
</P>
<P>
"It was some of the poorest site planning and design I'd seen," said City 
Councilman Ron Roberts, the lone council member trained as an architect. "There 
were four buildings, with two on Harbor Drive, and none of the architecture or 
site planning related to anything around it." 
</P>
<P>
Senturia now agrees that the scheme wasn't right for the location. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia's argument in favor of his 325-foot tower is that, because several 
larger high-rises are about to be built 
</P>
<P>
nearby along Harbor Drive (including his own One Harbor Drive), and because the 
Park Plaza site actually stretches beyond 4th Avenue (outside the western 
boundary of the historic district), his tower is really as much a part of 
intense adjacent redevelopment as it is a part of the low-scale historic 
district. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't placate people like Howard Greenberg, a Gaslamp Quarter Planning 
Board member who is converting the low-rise Pioneer Warehouse to apartments, 
across K Street from Senturia's site. 
</P>
<P>
"I fought long and hard for the increase to 125 feet, and I thought that was 
pushing the envelope," Greenberg said, referring to the area's initial height 
limit of 75 feet. "For someone to come in over 300, I think, is pushing the 
envelope too far." 
</P>
<P>
Architect Ralph Roesling, who sits on the Gaslamp board, prepared a computer 
model of the Gaslamp Quarter, including Senturia's project, to study building 
heights and bulk. Roesling also helped write the plan that convinced the city 
to increase the height limit to 125 feet from 75 feet in select cases. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's too high," Roesling said of Park Plaza. "That project is 
definitely within the Gaslamp Quarter district, and they're asking for 325 
feet. That would be so out of scale with everything else, I think it would be 
wrong." According to Roesling, the tower would cast large shadows across 5th 
Avenue in the afternoon, besides towering over surrounding buildings. 
</P>
<P>
High-rise units generally bring premium prices, and Senturia said a lower 
building would be "less economically feasible." 
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, several Gaslamp Quarter businesses have struggled or died 
during delays in the building of the Horton Plaza shopping center and the San 
Diego Convention Center. However, even after those projects opened, many 
businesses continued to stagger, and members of the Gaslamp Quarter Council 
(now Gaslamp Quarter Planning Board) began thinking that a few large new 
projects, probably hotels, would help turn business in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
When the city of San Diego wrote a plan to limit new buildings to 60 feet (75 
in some cases), the Gaslamp Quarter Council commissioned its own height study. 
The conclusion: buildings up to 125 feet should be considered for four large 
parcels, including Senturia's. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego City Council passed a Gaslamp planning ordinance solidifying this 
policy late last year, with Senturia's project excluded. 
</P>
<P>
Judged without consideration for height, the present design is a sound piece of 
architecture, though not the masterpiece that Senturia claims could spawn a 
whole new phase of downtown architecture. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the six-story portion of the project, along 5th and K, looks very 
good, with Senturia promising to use high-grade stone such as granite, brick 
and ceramic tile on the base, and reinforced concrete panels for the tower. 
</P>
<P>
Low-rise facades along K and 5th are well articulated, and these buildings 
would be punctuated by bay windows echoing the bay windows found on many other 
Gaslamp buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia rightly described the site as the gateway to the Gaslamp Quarter, an 
important "transition" block. The corner of the project closest to Harbor Drive 
would be anchored with a low, open pavilion. Broad stairs would lead from 5th 
Avenue to second-level terraces. 
</P>
<P>
The design of the project's back portion is crucial because it would face the 
pedestrian-oriented "linear park" designed for the city under the direction of 
San Francisco landscape architects Peter Walker and Martha Schwartz, with the 
local Austin Hansen Group and several artists. 
</P>
<P>
Park Plaza's two tiers of restaurants would step down to meet the park, and 
Senturia is offering to donate part of the land for park use at one corner of 
his site. 
</P>
<P>
The tower steps back and would be crowned with Mission tile. It would feature a 
circular sundial emblem created by local artists. The proportions are good, but 
the tile seems too cute a way to incorporate local Spanish influences. 
</P>
<P>
There is also some question as to whether the existing buildings on Senturia's 
site should be destroyed. None is great architecture, but one was designed by 
early 20th-Century architect William Hebbard, who gave architect Irving Gill 
his start here. 
</P>
<P>
Historic Site Board chairwoman Kathryn Willetts said there's a valid argument 
that the buildings should remain, if only to retain the scale and character of 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
Senturia's project isn't yet scheduled for hearings at the CCDC, Historic Site 
Board or City Council. Tuesday, he made the latest of several presentations to 
the Gaslamp board. 
</P>
<P>
The most logical response to his 325-foot fantasy seems to be the one offered 
by Stepner and echoed by many others: 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's a very handsome building that deserves to be built somewhere, but 
my question is, is it in the right location?"
