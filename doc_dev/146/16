DIRK SUTRO ARCHITECTURE: OUT-OF-TOWNER HAS A FEEL FOR SAN DIEGO 
</P>

<P>
In recent years, a wave of buildings by famous out-of-town architects has hit 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Graves, Mitchell/Giurgola, Antoine Predock, Helmut Jahn and Skidmore 
Owings Merrill are among the big names coming to town. 
</P>
<P>
In many cases, though, these architects are merely importing signature styles, 
with little regard for how architecture can be adapted to unique aspects of our 
culture and climate. 
</P>
<P>
That's not true of Charles Moore, who has five of his designs under 
construction in San Diego -- intelligent, inspiring projects suited to the 
region and quite different from what he's done in other cities. In addition to 
this sensitivity, Moore has shown an uncanny ability to make architecture a 
collaborative process, one in which he and his co-designers effectively listen 
to clients and citizens, then produce buildings that meet their needs while 
retaining the architects' strong imprint. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Known for Sea Ranch 
</P>
<P>
Moore is best known for his 1960s designs at Sea Ranch, an enclave of vacation 
homes along the coast of Northern California where the architect adapted a 
woodsy-shed vocabulary to scenic coastal bluffs, with a special concern for 
bringing natural light into the spaces. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, his slate of projects has ranged from the Piazza d' Italia in New 
Orleans, a Cubist collage of classical forms and moving water, to many large 
public and university buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Moore has taught at several architecture schools, including Yale, UCLA and, at 
the moment, the University of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
His current San Diego agenda includes the Oceanside Civic Center (in 
conjunction with Urban Innovations Group) now under construction; a theater 
complex for the city of Escondido (designed by Moore in conjunction with John 
Ruble and Buzz Yudell, based in Santa Monica); a molecular biology research lab 
on the UC San Diego campus (also by Moore, Ruble, Yudell); a church in 
Fairbanks Ranch (in conjunction with San Diego's Austin Hansen Fehlman Group), 
and a building for Phoenix House -- a program for troubled high school students 
-- several miles east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Moore commented on San Diego recently by phone from his home and studio in 
Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
He called Escondido's new City Hall, designed by Pacific Associates Planners 
and Architects of San Diego, a "very skillful piece of work. I think that the 
openness to the outdoors, the way it opens outward toward the park and toward 
the entrance circle, all are very much in the spirit of Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
In mid-February, Yudell presented initial ideas for the theater complex to 
Escondido city officials. Although it's too early to give specifics, Moore and 
his partners have some ideas as to how they will design the complex, with its 
1,700-seat theater, smaller theater and outdoor amphitheater in Grape Day Park. 
</P>
<P>
Moore acknowledged the lack of a strong architectural heritage from which to 
draw on in Escondido. 
</P>
<P>
"Our building's happening mostly from the inside out, in the time-honored way 
architects of my generation were taught. Considerations of what kind of light 
will be in the theater will have more to do 
</P>
<P>
with what the building looks like than any image we've got." 
</P>
<P>
In a different way, the Oceanside Civic Center, scheduled to open later this 
year, also fits its setting. The design acknowledges nearby buildings by early 
San Diego architectural master Irving Gill, but not in a literal way. Where 
Gill was known for rounded arches, Moore's large openings are squared. As with 
some of Gill's buildings, Moore's outdoor spaces are extremely important. A 
plaza at one corner of the project will feature a grove of palm trees and a 
water feature that Moore refers to as an "alluvial fan." 
</P>
<P>
The opportunity for citizens and city officials to offer opinions on the design 
resulted in minor changes, he said. Most significantly, the city bureaucrats 
rejected Moore's first design for the doors to the City Council chamber. 
Instead of colorful baked-on porcelain, they will be made from plain gray metal 
by Texas sculptor Robert Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
Moore's Church of the Nativity in Fairbanks Ranch, designed in collaboration 
with the local Austin Hansen Fehlman Group, shares with the Oceanside complex 
sensitive indoor-outdoor relationships and such California details as color 
ceramic tile around windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Harder-Edged Look 
</P>
<P>
The Molecular Biology Building at UCSD, scheduled for completion this spring, 
finds Moore working in concrete and glass, a harder-edged look than the stucco 
that will cover the buildings in Oceanside. But he softens the effect with fine 
detailing, breaking the facades with abstracted pilasters and romantic little 
balconies. A central atrium continues the architect's search for uniquely "San 
Diego" solutions. 
</P>
<P>
Is he developing a San Diego palette? 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly there are things we do elsewhere that I wouldn't think of doing in 
San Diego County," Moore said. "In Oceanside, every design decision reflected 
what Gill would have done, whether he'd approve. I'm torn, because I like Gill 
a lot, but I also like (Bertram) Goodhue," he said, referring to the designer 
of the ornate California Tower in Balboa Park, a 180-degree contrast to the 
stark work of Gill. 
</P>
<P>
What does Moore think of Fairbanks Ranch? 
</P>
<P>
"It would be better if I didn't comment," he said, pausing. "I just don't 
understand it. I think it's meant to be Spanish, but it hardly ever gets the 
feel right." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown San Diego? 
</P>
<P>
He's never visited Horton Plaza, but complimented the historic preservation 
efforts in the Gaslamp Quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The UCSD campus? 
</P>
<P>
"I've written negative things about it," said the one-time student of Louis 
Kahn, designer of the masterful Salk Institute just across Torrey Pines Road 
from the campus. "I have never figured out the scheme of the campus. I can't 
locate myself when I'm on it, or understand the relationship between the 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps Moore's designs and observations will inspire a more thoughtful 
generation of local buildings in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: C. W. Kim, Lorimer-Case and Naegle Associates, all San Diego 
architects, have designed the three proposals recently received by the Centre 
City Development Corp. for a high-rise development at Broadway and State 
Street. Both Lorimer-Case and Naegle hope to cross over from tract home work 
into the high-rise big leagues. . . . The Del Mar Plaza project in downtown Del 
Mar, an eclectic blend of shops and restaurants in a complex designed by Horton 
Plaza architect Jon Jerde, is months behind schedule and as much as $5 million 
over budget, sources say. Developers attribute the difficulties to complex 
improvements for such tenants as the Il Fornaio restaurant.
