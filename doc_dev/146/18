<TEXT>
<P>
Even if you are familiar with San Diego architecture, you probably haven't 
heard much about the largest local architecture company. 
</P>
<P>
Yet SGPA Architecture &amp; Planning probably effects your daily life more than 
any other San Diego firm. Specializing in retailing centers, the company has 
designed more than 400 such projects since opening in 1969, including at least 
40 in San Diego. Among these are town centers in Rancho Bernardo, Rancho 
Penasquitos, Del Mar Highlands, Carmel Mountain Ranch and Rancho San Diego On 
the strength of its reputation for designing economical, financially successful 
retailing centers, the company has grown to 135 employees and $10 million in 
annual revenues, with satellite offices in San Francisco and Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
But SGPA has not received a single design award during the last eight years 
from the local American Institute of Architects chapter. 
</P>
<P>
This seems to confirm the suspicion one gets, driving around San Diego, that 
most retail projects are driven by economics, not innovative architecture and 
planning. What works is replicated over and over again. 
</P>
<P>
Most of SGPA's newer shopping complexes have elements in common. Budgets 
dictate affordable stucco walls, often with simple, easy-to-build geometries, 
usually in a vaguely Mediterranean style. Tile roofs predominate: The accepted 
method of adding "authentic" regional flavor; even worse, stark 
industrial-grade metal seems to be the roofing choice for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
At the new town centers, the automobile takes precedence over the pedestrian. 
The ritual of entering the center, parking the car and finding your store of 
choice has superseded a walk down Main Street. And the fast food restaurant has 
replaced city halls and churches as the most prominent community building, with 
McDonald's leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
Critics may not always find much cause for optimism at these malls, but Mike 
LaBarre, one of 11 principals at the SGPA, stands by the company's designs. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely satisfied with the quality of our work," he said. "But we 
would like more recognition from the AIA. Every year we get awards from the 
retailing industry. 
</P>
<P>
"In my opinion, the AIA awards tend to go to unusual architecture more than 
mainstream, even if the mainstream project is very well designed, has a 
positive impact on a community and has met client objectives." 
</P>
<P>
As for the difficulty of creating dignified town centers with fast food 
restaurants as their most visible elements, LaBarre hopes this will gradually 
change. 
</P>
<P>
'The McDonald's thing is a function of land development economics. McDonald's 
is the tenant willing to pay the highest price for a premier location. Until 
the shopping center conventions of today change, you're always going to see 
that." 
</P>
<P>
LaBarre and other SGPA architects blame economics for limiting forms and 
materials, putting a damper on creativity, even though other architects have 
proven, with projects such as the newest downtown single-room-occupancy hotels, 
that it is possible to make interesting, functional buildings using low-cost 
stucco construction. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, we have a big challenge: how to create a positive aesthetic that 
projects quality for less dollars," LaBarre said. 
</P>
<P>
This may be an long battle with few victories. Just compare a '70s SGPA project 
like the wood-shingled Pacific Plaza on Garnet Avenue in Pacific Beach with 
such '80s stucco cousins as The Promenade on Mission Boulevard in Pacific Beach 
or North County Plaza near Highway 78 in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
Architects at SGPA, seeing the wood shingle style as a bygone sign of the '70s, 
have taken to calling such designs "woodsy goodsy." But there's no denying a 
certain warmth and charm often lacking in the larger all-stucco projects of 
today. 
</P>
<P>
Besides the shingles, which give scale and detailing to the buildings, Pacific 
Plaza has unusually inviting landscaping: small, beachy hillocks resembling 
coastal dunes soften the impact of buildings, concrete and tile. Low wooden 
benches and tables, shaded by umbrellas and trees, provide plenty of inviting 
places to take a break. 
</P>
<P>
These days, landscaping seems a lower priority. New retail centers usually have 
several trees, but few large-scale patches of greenery. Or maybe it only seems 
that way because a good portion of the budget goes toward breaking up huge 
parking lots with landscaped islands, instead of greening the insides of the 
projects, where people spend most of their time. Today's centers also have 
benches and outdoor tables, but they generally seem to be fewer and more poorly 
shaded. 
</P>
<P>
On a hot afternoon recently at the SGPA-designed Costa Verde retailing complex 
off La Jolla Village Drive in La Jolla, expanses of unshaded tiles underfoot 
served as unintended passive solar devices, absorbing sunlight and re-emitting 
the heat, so that the temperature for shoppers was several degrees above the 
air temperature. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe all of this is unfairly morose, but it is disturbing to see the county 
gobbled alive by dozens of these new centers. In all fairness to SGPA and other 
architects, much of the blame for the blandness rests with developers who favor 
proven formulas and tenant design demands over fresh architecture and planning, 
and consumers who worship easy auto access and fast food. 
</P>
<P>
Also in fairness to SGPA, the company has designed some excellent retailing 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
The Mercado in Rancho Bernardo, completed in 1987, replaced an earlier complex 
which had foundered financially. It's a fresh interpretation of Mediterranean 
and Spanish elements, impressive in a community already gorged on stucco and 
tile roofs. Project designer Jerry Silva is said to be a stickler for 
detailing, and this is evident in the way the carefully varied facades blend 
from one to another. Signage has been kept to a minimum, and there is a 
symbolic domed tower, so that even if commerce is the order of the day, there's 
some sense of civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
Uptown District, a new project on University Avenue in Hillcrest, may be SGPA's 
most significant breakthrough, with SGPA's mixed retail-office buildings 
merging into condominiums designed by Lorimer-Case. Parking is hidden so that 
human-scaled storefronts, designed to blend with adjacent '30s and '40s 
architecture, become the dominant image from the street. 
</P>
<P>
The people from Ralph's took a risk by situating their supermarket internally, 
so that the smaller storefronts could be nearest the street. According to 
LaBarre, the store is a financial winner. 
</P>
<P>
This well-designed mixed-use project, including retailing, residential and 
office space, could well make SGPA a role model for architects in the '90s. 
Already, this broader approach to retail development has spurred some of SGPA's 
best work.
