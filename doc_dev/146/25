<P>
As the city's downtown grows up, new combinations of uses are giving architects 
fresh design challenges. The results are some of the most interesting buildings 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
Take transportation systems, for example. Developers now realize that by 
integrating their projects with bus and trolley lines, they can make city 
planners happy while delivering office workers and retail consumers to their 
doorsteps. 
</P>
<P>
As the San Diego Trolley expands downtown, architects are getting a chance to 
do lively projects along its tracks. Chicago architect Helmut Jahn's new 
headquarters for Great American Bank, now being built on Broadway, will 
straddle the trolley line. The movement of trolley cars and people through 
these spaces should give the project the same kind of energy Jahn captured in 
his widely publicized Chicago terminal for United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Across downtown, at 12th and Imperial avenues, the James R. Mills Building -- a 
mixed-use project incorporating a trolley station, government offices and 
ground-level shops -- shows how exciting the confluence of people, cars and 
trolleys can be. 
</P>
<P>
The building, which opened early last year, has received several awards for its 
design. Last June, the local American Institute of Architects chapter selected 
it to receive an Honor Award, its highest recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of being just another government office complex, the building is a 
people machine. Walking toward it from any direction, you find yourself drawn 
by its graceful 220-foot-high clock tower ground-level activity. 
</P>
<P>
Trolleys roll through, stopping to pick up passengers. People come and go. Some 
leave their cars in the parking structure and take the trolley into downtown. 
Others observe and are observed as they sit outdoors at a large circular plaza 
in front, at tables outside a deli and at a smaller outdoor area behind the 
main building. This last area will serve the trolley's bayside line, scheduled 
to open this summer. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the station's convenience mart-snack shop, people relax with a 
newspaper, a deli sandwich or a soft drink from stools behind large panes of 
glass. 
</P>
<P>
Such vibrant urban transportation hubs are common in the east, but are all too 
rare in California. 
</P>
<P>
Deceptively simple in appearance, the complex marks a sophisticated departure 
from what's been done downtown. The building's strong, clean exterior 
geometries grew from its structural system, instead of being lifted from this 
year's trendy design book or designed as an imitation of history. 
</P>
<P>
Starboard Development was hired by the Metropolitan Transit Development Board 
to build the project on time and on budget. As part of its team, Starboard 
brought in the San Diego architectural firm of Delawie Bretton Wilkes 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
What a difference a client can make. The architects had also collaborated with 
Starboard on the city of San Diego's downtown police station, completed in 
1985, but with a much less impressive result. Michael Wilkes, a partner in the 
firm, defended the police station as a decent building on a limited budget. 
After additional prodding, though, he indirectly acknowledged the transit 
building's more sophisticated design. 
</P>
<P>
"Why the chemistry was better, I can't tell you," he said. One reason, perhaps, 
is that transit officials seemed to have an intuitive sense of what makes good 
architecture. MTDB General Manager Tom Larwin insisted that his company's new 
office building incorporate the trolley station, instead of making it separate. 
</P>
<P>
The architects' initial design shows where the project might have gone without 
input from Larwin and others, such as City Architect Mike Stepner, Centre City 
Development Corp. urban design expert Max Schmidt and San Diego city planners 
Paul Curcio and Marianne Munsell. 
</P>
<P>
A downtown train station designed early this century by San Diego architect 
Irving Gill served as a stylistic point of departure (it was torn down a few 
years later when the tracks were moved). 
</P>
<P>
The early version of the MTDB complex was a weird combination of free-standing 
walls resembling mission ruins, in front of a low glass box. The trolley tracks 
passed behind the building. 
</P>
<P>
Pressed by Larwin &amp; Co. to provide a new building incorporating additional 
office space that could be leased to other users, the architects designed a 
clean-lined building with trolley trains running through its base and a clock 
tower as a focal point. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, MTDB decided to maximize development of its site. Starboard signed 
up the county of San Diego to take 75% of the space, and MTDB asked for a 
10-story building with a six-story parking structure. 
</P>
<P>
In response, the architects pulled the clock tower away as a separate feature. 
It serves as the project's visual anchor, while giving downtown San Diego a 
significant landmark in an area mostly occupied by run-down industrial 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of completely covering the building's steel frame, the architects made 
it a key feature. Painted red to pick up the color of the trolleys, the steel 
members form striking giant X's at the building's base. A single size of 
window, repeated many times, cut costs and generated eye-catching visual 
rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
Between windows, the building is covered with a light, Styrofoam-like material 
called Sto. It had never been used in San Diego, according to the architects, 
and it gives the building a rich, solid appearance. 
</P>
<P>
City planner Munsell gets credit for suggesting landscaping the top of the 
parking structure. Planters atop tall pillars contain creeping vines that will 
eventually spread along the structure's perimeter, following a network of 
wires. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its many successes, the Mills building has shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the clock tower should be more than a giant piece of art. At 
30-by-30-feet square, couldn't it have housed some uses? MTDB General Counsel 
Jack Limber, who departed from his usual legal and management duties to oversee 
this project, said the construction budget didn't allow anything inside the 
tower. 
</P>
<P>
But a 30-by-30 space could have become a 900-square-foot artist's loft on each 
of several floors. It would have been interesting to see proposals for 
developing the tower's interior. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a useful purpose within, the tower needs something to animate its 
base. A ground-floor snack shop, sandwich counter, news stand or some other use 
would give people a reason to use the adjacent plaza more often. It's not too 
late to consider this. 
</P>
<P>
A final drawback is the shady central plaza, where the sun's rays are blocked 
by the office building most of the day. That's not a problem during the warmer 
months, but, on a breezy March morning, the plaza was deserted. People 
clustered in one splotch of sunlight at its outer edge. 
</P>
<P>
DESIGN NOTES: Michael Graves, designer of the Aventine, the new La Jolla 
office-hotel complex that is not well-liked by many San Diego architects, gets 
heavy coverage in the March issue of Progressive Architecture. If San Diegans 
think the Aventine is wild, they should see Graves' cartoonish Florida hotels 
for Disney, topped with giant swans.
