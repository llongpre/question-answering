BRITISH new towns conjure up the whole range of architectural visions of the
second half of the twentieth century.
In fact, their architectural origins go right back to the early days of new
town propaganda when Ebenezer Howard published his manifesto about garden
cities in 1898, Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform.
This book was full of utopian ideas about town planning based upon Howard's
own version of what he called, 'Common sense socialism'. Ebeneezer Howard
was to go on to found in the early 1900s his First Garden City Company and
to assemble the land and devise a plan for the building of Letchworth Garden
City in Hertfordshire.
To plan the very first British new town Howard employed the services of
Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin, two very young architects who were
responsible for the physical form of Howard's socially reforming ideas.
Gardens and landscape were almost as important as the architecture - indeed
the main architectural virtues of Letchworth are to be seen in the modest
and sensibly planned traditional houses.
Architects involved in the early days of the garden city movement were
responsible for building the visions of practical idealists. At Letchworth
and later at Welwyn Garden City the architecture definitely takes second
place to the planning of interrelated housing and industrial areas.
Domestic architecture is agreeable and modest in these towns and the public
buildings are mainly traditional and unadventurous. The mission of the early
new towns was not to create architectural monuments but to provide good
simple homes with gardens and easy access to the workplace.
In Britain, the first new towns were far from the forefront of 20th Century
architecture. There is little sign of the influence of the International
Modern Movement or of pioneers such as Le Corbusier in the British new towns
until well after the second world war.
Harlow new town in Essex was one of the first towns to acquire a distinctive
architectural character. The architect for the town was Sir Frederic
Gibberd, probably better known as the architect of Heathrow Airport and the
wig-wam shaped Roman Catholic cathedral of Christ the King in Liverpool.
He had very strong architectural ideas and introduced the first tower block
of flats into a new town. Harlow was designated in 1947 and its town centre
has some of the modern sentimentality of the early 1950s. The sentiment
comes in modern interpretations of traditional market square and clock
tower.
The atmosphere of the new towns of the 1950s was that of the Festival of
Britain - a sort of spiky contemporary architecture and a child-like use of
primary colours. Harlow, however, did pioneer the commissioning of works of
art and is now famous for its outdoor sculpture collection.
Stevenage, Crawley, Bracknell, Basildon, Hatfield, Hemel Hempstead and
Welwyn, Newton Aycliffe and Peterlee all belong to the English first
generation of new towns being designated in the 1940s. They are all
architecturally unmemorable.
Of this first wave only Peterlee had a distinctive architectural agenda. The
emigre Russian modernist architect Berthold Lubetkin, famous for the penguin
pool at London Zoo, was brought in to design the town. His proposals were
imaginative and very promising essays in abstract modern architecture. But
Lubetkin fell foul of the elaborate committee system that tends to dog any
major public enterprise in Britain and felt obliged to resign. He was not
prepared to compromise on his distinctive architectural designs and so
Peterlee lost the chance to be an uncompromisingly modern new town.
Of the second wave of new towns (late 1950s and early 1960s) it was
Cumbernauld in Scotland - commissioned in 1955 - that took the opportunity
to have a remarkable town centre design that separated the motor car from
the pedestrian and effectively made the whole town centre one large
megastructure.
The architects were a firm called Wilson and Womersley. Their design was
based on the wish to make the town easy for the pedestrian. The vast town
centre on a hilltop has never won many architectural plaudits. The use of
concrete as the main material was an unwise choice for the Scottish climate
and the centre has weathered badly.
It has been left to Milton Keynes, Britain's largest new town founded in
North Buckinghamshire in the 1960s, to be the one town that had produced
architecture and landscaping that could be considered remarkable.
The appointment of Fred Lloyd Roche and Derek Walker to head up the
development team of architects created an unusual architectural climate in
the new city. The Development Corporation built up a very strong team of
architects so that a great deal of the new architecture was designed
'in-house'.
The main manifestation of this policy is the great shopping centre that is
one giant mall. It is designed in a simple and elegant way - unremarkable
outside but beautifully planted and finished internally. Two things
particularly distinguish Milton Keynes - its grid plan of roads - designed
by the master planners Llewelyn-Davies, Weekes, Forestier Walker and Bor,
and the quality of its industrial buildings that were all supervised by the
Development Corporation architects.
On the housing front the town is also interesting being built at a time when
private housing played its part in the growth of the city. A wide range of
architects and developers built housing in the city including Sir Norman
Foster and Ralph Erskine. There are no monuments in any of the new towns -
Milton Keynes is remarkable for a Buddhist Temple and a domed ecumenical
church in the very centre of the town.
Architects played their part in the development of the new towns but it has
to be said that the British wish to live in green places that may well
appear suburban is what has won the day in the new towns. Their mixture of
uses makes them urban but in appearance and spaciousness they are not so
much towns as new suburbs.
The British like the idea of the country in the town and MIlton Keynes has
achieved this to an unusual degree. Although Milton Keynes has very good
architecture - it has millions of very good trees. These make the town
almost invisible from the roads - and perhaps it is true of almost all the
towns that the landscaping puts the architecture in its place.
