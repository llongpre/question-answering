<LEADPARA>  The focal point of the $1.8 million renovation of the Saratoga Civic Center
will be a courtyard with trees, wooden park benches and shaded walkways.;   
The courtyard, patterned after the California missions, will be bordered on
three sides by a new administrative wing and existing city hall buildings,
which will be remodeled.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "The courtyard is the driving force of the project. Using the pathways and
landscaping, we want to draw people into the courtyard and direct them to
where they need to go," said project manager Duncan Todd of H.E.D. Architects
of Redwood City. "It will make a pleasant space.";    Project specifics were
presented to the council last week by Todd and landscape architect Thomas
Klope of MPA Design in San Francisco. The council, in reviewing various
materials for the buildings' interior and exterior, opted for redwood siding
and gray slate roofing. Carpet and paint colors were also selected.;    City
Manager Harry Peacock said the Civic Center's architectural design represents
a "happy medium" between an institutional-looking building and a residential
appearing structure. "We wanted something that said this is a civic building,
but not a monument," he said.;    The council's choices will be incorporated
into the final construction drawings, which must be approved by the city
before they can go to bid. Approval is expected in July.;    Todd said
construction should take seven to nine months.;    The Civic Center
Improvement Project was authorized by the council last year to ease staff
overcrowding and better accommodate the public. Bond financing for the project
has already been approved.;    Other elements include landscaping and redesign
of the parking lots for the entire Civic Center, interior remodeling of the
Community Center on Allendale Avenue, renovation and addition to the city's
corporation yard building, renovation work on the nearby Warner Hutton House,
and the construction of a skateboard center between the corporation yard and
the Community Center.;    The council inspected the drawings for a nearly
4,000-square-foot skateboard complex with three bowls. The design is similar
to a skateboard park that recently opened at Greer Park in Palo Alto.;   
Three bowls will be surrounded with concrete decking and grass, and there will
be a shed containing helmets, pads and other skateboard equipment. A six-foot
chain link fence will also be put around it.  </TEXT>
