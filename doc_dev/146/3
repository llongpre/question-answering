DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: NATIONAL CITY'S CIVIC CENTER PLAN FALLS SHORT OF

What is it that stands out about National City? The Mile of Cars? A few great 
period Victorians? Beyond these images, many of us who don't live there have 
only hazy -- and not always positive -- impressions. 
</P>
<P>
City officials hope to change this with a new civic center in the heart of 
town, scheduled to break ground later this year. Designed by San Diego 
architects Wheeler Wimer Blackman &amp; Associates, the government complex is 
expected to spur a new era of economic vitality and set a high architectural 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
The positive economic impact seems probable, but, as design goes, the project 
falls several notches below what it could have been, looking too much like a 
speculative office building and not enough like a prestigious, people-oriented 
new soul of a city. 
</P>
<P>
City officials invited about a dozen local firms to bid on the job -- not with 
designs, but prices -- and Wheeler Wimer Blackman was selected simply because 
its proposed fee of 4.85% of the construction cost was less than half the next 
lowest bid, according to Arnold Peterson, the city's community development 
director. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Lacks Aggressive Pursuit 
</P>
<P>
Such a process seems exactly opposite of the best way to get a good design, 
which is to choose the architect with the best ideas, then make a financial 
agreement. National City's approach lacks the aggressive pursuit of fresh 
designs displayed recently by the cities of Escondido and Oceanside. Both held 
well-publicized civic center design competitions entered by local and national 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the criticism from some local architects that such contests are useful 
mostly for generating publicity, both resulted in top-notch designs. And, 
despite local griping that locals get overlooked when the field is open to 
national stars, that didn't prove true. A local firm (PAPA) did Escondido's new 
City Hall, and the nationally known Charles Moore &amp; Urban Innovations Group 
got the civic center job in Oceanside. And, in Escondido, the public was 
invited to comment on designs before the architect was selected. In National 
City, comments have been heard only since selection. 
</P>
<P>
The project could have taken a number of directions, since there was no strong 
historic or neighborhood context. Nearby are used-car lots, auto body shops and 
other uses in older buildings of little architectural impact. The site is a 
sloping pie slice of land immediately south of the existing '60s civic center 
with its entrance on National City Boulevard, at the edge of Kimball Park, a 
wonderful green open space with tremendous potential. 
</P>
<P>
The architects responded with a building of white precast concrete and green 
glass. A circular plaza joining the new structure to the old civic center is 
the best thing about the design. Aligned with Civic Center Drive, this outdoor 
space will offer a warm invitation to pedestrians and motorists. Made of 
concrete and stone, with plenty of benches and a piece of public art at its 
center, this promises to be a great people place. Also commendable is the way 
the architects tucked two levels of parking out of sight, below street level. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
An Inspired Move 
</P>
<P>
Locating the council chamber at the back of this plaza, as a sort of link 
between the old and new buildings, is also an inspired move. Symbolically, it 
puts the seat of important decisions in full public view. Architecturally, the 
council chamber is a low, minimalist building with a free-standing 
aqueduct-like arch out front that gives a sense of importance to the complex. 
Adjacent conference rooms cantilevered over the park will have dramatic views. 
</P>
<P>
But, although the plaza sets up a main entry axis that leads into the council 
chamber, the main entrance to the big, new building, the place of prime 
importance to the public, is off to the side. This is a missed opportunity to 
guide users into the complex. 
</P>
<P>
Not only does it lack a strong entry treatment, but also this main building 
will tower over everything else nearby, including the park, with its expanses 
of lawns, palm trees and children's play areas. At seven stories, it will rise 
to about 120 feet in a neighborhood of one- and two-story buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the city feels the size is needed as a flexing of economic muscle, 
as a catalyst for a new wave of intense development. As such, the civic center 
is too harsh a gesture toward the people who will have to look up at its green 
glass walls from the park side. 
</P>
<P>
There could have been some great interaction here. A public plaza at the edge 
of the building would have eased the transition between park and civic center. 
Instead, the design turns a cold green shoulder on the park -- there's only one 
narrow entrance from this side, and nothing that engages pedestrians. The 
building, at least in model form, looks more like a Holiday Inn from the park. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Seeing Workers Inside 
</P>
<P>
The architects say the green glass will allow people outside to see workers 
inside, giving some sense of human interaction to the project. But those of us 
who have wandered through the Golden Triangle or downtown San Diego know that 
when strong daylight bounces off colored glass, it becomes nearly opaque. 
</P>
<P>
From the street side, the feeling will be friendlier, but, aside from the 
circular plaza, with its weak link to the main building, not inviting. In terms 
of massing, the architects had the right idea, stepping three elongated 
cylinders back from the street. From some angles, though, the composition is 
awkward, and a cynic might compare the whole thing to a stack of Dough Boy 
pools topped by a giant carrying handle. 
</P>
<P>
Vertical white fins on the outsides of these rounded volumes do a nice job of 
breaking up the expanses of glass; they also pick up the vertical details on 
the old civic center next door. The city requested a building that would look 
different from all angles, and Wheeler Wimer Blackman's design meets this 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Call it a pet peeve, but it's hard to imagine people working in San Diego 
County and not being able to get fresh air. Yet the new civic center will have 
operable windows only on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
No Natural Light 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the architects have organized the new building's offices around an 
interior atrium space. But it won't rise to the top of the building, so it 
won't let in natural light. Surely, there would have been a way to locate this 
dramatic five-story volume such that it could tap some bona fide daylight. 
</P>
<P>
Against the exciting new civic centers developing in Escondido and Oceanside, 
both fresh designs made with people in mind, National City's looks weak. That's 
not for lack of size (60,000 square feet) or budget ($10.6 million), but simply 
because the building doesn't maximize the opportunity for a people-oriented 
government center that opens itself to the beautiful park next door. Perhaps a 
formal competition process, one oriented toward good designs and not the bottom 
line, would have led to more adequate solutions, or spurred these architects on 
to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
Other than the architects, the city apparently didn't ask for outside design 
advice. The result makes a strong case for not putting city officials without 
design experience completely in charge of such a significant project.
