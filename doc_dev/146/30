SAM HALL KAPLAN: DESIGN AWARDS HAVE SOME VALUE

Few weeks go by in the design community without some sort of an award program 
or other. Last week, it was the chairman of the National Endowment of the Arts 
traveling to Pasadena to hand out the Presidential Awards for Design Excellence 
to regional winners, having already announced the awards a few months ago at 
ceremonies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
This week Progressive Architecture (PA) magazine is scheduled to disclose the 
winners of its coveted annual awards program in the categories of architectural 
design, urban design and planning, and applied research, with California 
practitioners as usual expected to garner more than their share. 
</P>
<P>
Bestowing honors in December was the Society of American Registered Architects, 
the Southern California chapter of the American Society of Landscape 
Architects, and Architectural Record magazine, the latter in a new, highly 
touted awards program entitled "In the Public Interest." 
</P>
<P>
And scheduled over the next few months are the awards ceremonies of the San 
Fernando Valley and California chapters, among others, of the American 
Institute of Architects, culminating with the institute's national awards in 
May. Also on tap is the bi-annual Rudy Brunner Award for Urban Excellence and 
the tri-annual Aga Khan Award for Architecture. The list goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
I have generally viewed many of the awards programs with a certain reticence. 
Too often, juries have appeared predisposed and doctrinaire, influenced by peer 
pressure, passing fads, flashy photography, and heavily promoted personalities 
easily identified by signature styles. (Except sometimes to the embarrassment 
of the juries, it is hard to tell the masters from the mimics.) Such self 
congratulatory exercises can become a bore. 
</P>
<P>
Still, I have found most awards programs to be of value, presenting as they do 
glimpses of the shifting styles and prejudices of the design profession in 
select geographic areas and project categories. When sitting at the design 
table it is instructive to know what deck the players are dealing from, and if 
jokers are wild. 
</P>
<P>
And occasionally gems are uncovered. This usually happens when juries in fits 
of independent intelligence judge submissions based on a critical matrix of 
substantive architectural issues, such as social, contextual and structure, 
instead of trying to pigeonhole them according to the shifting superficial 
styles sanctified by a Charles Jencks, a Robert A.M. Stern, or a similar 
pedant. 
</P>
<P>
Award programs also have the potential when properly focused, conducted and 
publicized to heighten public and professional awareness of the potential of 
good design. In addition, by honoring such efforts others involved in a 
particular design process might be encouraged to emulate them. 
</P>
<P>
Given this potential, and the general low level of publicly funded design, I 
feel the Presidential Awards program deserves special mention. Presented every 
four years, the program honors designs in a variety of federally sponsored 
projects, including architecture, landscape design, planning and historic 
preservation. 
</P>
<P>
Topping the Design Excellence list was the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the 
Washington Mall, including both the expressive, intersecting black granite 
walls designed by Maya Ying Lin, and the accompanying realistic sculpture of 
three soldiers by Frederick Hart. 
</P>
<P>
Other winners included the urban design of Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, 
the planning of a transit project in Boston, and the engineering of a bridge in 
Florida. (Of the 10 top awards, only one -- in Arkansas -- was west of the 
Mississippi, indicating once again what I feel is a distinct East Coast 
prejudice of Washington-based programs. But that is another topic for another 
time.) 
</P>
<P>
Locally, one of the 68 national Achievement Awards went to the adaptive reuse 
of the former hotel overlooking the Arroyo Seco south of Colorado Boulevard as 
a federal court and office building. Architects for the imaginative effort that 
preserved the landmark was the Pasadena firm of Neptune &amp; Thomas 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Also winning an Achievement Award was the renovation of a dated, deteriorated 
bungalow at 2303 Fifth St. in the Ocean Park area of Santa Monica into a 
desirable apartment complex. It was accomplished by the determined non-profit 
Community Corp. of Santa Monica and the resourceful architecture of the local 
firm of Fondi-Bonardi &amp; Associates. 
</P>
<P>
In bestowing a bevy of awards, the jury for the Southern California chapter of 
the American Society of Landscape Architects made the provocative point that 
the profession's focus was in flux. It declared that "while the variety of 
projects receiving awards reflected the landscape architect's broad ability to 
successfully design for any location, the real challenge is to create more 
'livable' urban spaces designed with people in mind." 
</P>
<P>
To illustrate its point, the jury gave an Award of Excellence to the Santa 
Monica firm of Campbell &amp; Campbell for its design of the pier area of 
Imperial Beach. It was noted that the design featuring the conversion of a 
derelict parking lot into a landscaped plaza was developed with the intense 
participation of local residents, in design jargon, the potential user. 
</P>
<P>
Other landscape architecture winners included Dike/Runa of Newport Beach for 
the Hidden Oaks Ranch in Valley Center, and the SWA Group of Laguna Beach for 
the Baywood Apartment complex in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
This recognition of the "user" is heartening. And while few actual "users," the 
person or persons a project is specifically designed for, are ever invited onto 
the juries of the various associations conducting awards program, they are, of 
course, the ultimate jurors, passing judgment daily on the projects experienced 
in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
In this respect, we are all jurors, and design critics.
