   A California architect on Friday unveiled a scale
model of Paris' new American Center, saying he hoped it would be
``a party in the park.''
   ``I wanted a building which would reflect the energy of the
American Center program,'' said Frank O. Gehry of Santa Monica,
Calif. ``It's joyous, and I wanted the building to have that
feeling.''
   Gehry, born in Toronto, is one of the United States'
most-admired architects, a recent winner of the prestigious
Pritzker Prize for architecture and almost always associated with
fish designs.
   The American Center looks nothing like a fish. It is a strong
rectangular design with a pan coupe, or as Gehry put it, `` a box
with one side missing.''
   The design, imposed by the shape of the park, was a first for
Gehry. ``It was torture, and it took me three months to figure out
what to do with it,'' he said.
   Although building materials have not yet been chosen, Gehry said
he envisioned a pinkish-beige limestone for the facades. His dream,
he said, is to have sliding glass entrance doors that could be left
open during the summer.
   ``That will be my California contribution,'' he said. ``I'd like
people to be able to wander in from the park and peek around
without being intimidated.''
   The main entrance is topped by a ballet-skirt shape zinc roof
that fills the diagonal space between the other three sides of the
building, all of which are ringed with balconies.
   Groundbreaking for the $25 million center is expected to begin
in June, with completion scheduled for June 1992.
   The American Center is a non-profit educational and cultural
institution founded in 1931 to promote exchange between France and
the United States.
   In 1987, it sold its prestigious Left Bank quarters, which had
become too small to accommodate an ever-growing demand for its many
cultural offerings including language and civilization lessons,
dance, art, photography, computer and music workshops. The new
center will feature performing studios, a permanent art museum and
a 350-seat auditorium.
   The center will be built in Bercy Park in the southeastern
corner of Paris that, until recently, was a desolate stretch of
train tracks and empty warehouses.
   The ultramodern, high-tech Finance Ministry and the newly
inaugurated Opera-Bastille _ just minutes from the new American
Center and the new Bibliotheque de France across from it _ changed
all that.
   The new center is expected to handle 350,000 visitors yearly.
