The college of the Blessed Virgin Mary, St. John the Evangelist and the
Glorious Virgin St. Radegund is better known as Jesus College, Cambridge.
When the college was founded in 1496 by John Alcock, Bishop of Ely, he took
over the convent buildings, including the priory church which was begun in
1150. Jesus College is fortunate in having a site that is extremely spacious
 -the five courts are surrounded by generous gardens and playing fields.
Large trees add to the park-like atmosphere and there is a homogeneity about
the mainly brick buildings, although the college's architectural history is
long and complex.
The first glimpse of the college from Jesus Lane is an intriguing one -
trees seen over old brick walls, the square tower of the chapel looking
almost like a parish church, and then the slender opening that leads to the
narrow entrance path, known as 'the chimney'. This is the main pedestrian
approach, usually lined with abandoned bicycles, ending at the Tudor
gatehouse.
It is one of the simplest and best gatehouses in Cambridge, dating from
around 1500 and looking at its most romantic when the college flag is flying
from the battlemented top.
Once a visitor has passed through the gatehouse into first court, one of the
architectural conventions of the college is immediately apparent  - the
three-sided court: first court, second court, chapel court, and north court
are all open on one side. This makes the college seem fluidly connected to
its parkland and gardens and adds an intensity to the experience of the
fully enclosed, four-sided cloister court. The north side of the original
cloister was the refectory of the convent and is now the college hall. There
are some fine Early English gothic arches that remain in the cloister from
the original Chapter House.
The simple brick three-storey ranges typify the Jesus style and different
architects at different periods have added buildings in a careful and
coherent way. Alfred Waterhouse (of Manchester Town Hall, the Natural
History Museum and the Prudential in London's Holborn) added the north range
of the second court in 1870 and managed to be disciplined by the convention
of low-key brick walls, adding only a slight touch of flamboyance with an
asymmetrical tower and spire. In the 1920's and 1930s the architect Morley
Horder added connected ranges around the southern end of the chapel court.
Horder (1870-1944) is an almost forgotten contemporary of Sir Edwin Lutyens,
who is best known for his traditional country houses, particularly in the
Cotswolds and Dorset. He was renowned for his Bohemian appearance and for
designing a modest house for Lloyd George, but he should be re-examined as
he was a master of materials and built, like Lutyens, at a time when English
craftsmanship was still practised and taught. He also built Westcott House
in Cambridge and the National Institute of Agricultural Botany - an exercise
in the Wren manner. His substantial group of stone Italian Renaissance
buildings for the University of Nottingham are his best known works.
In the 1960s the college added a large new court by the Cambridge architect
David Roberts, with student rooms arranged on an echeleon plan to maximise
sunlight. It is in a different tradition from the rest of the college and
only its distance from the older buildings renders it acceptable.
Recently the college announced that it planned to build a new court to
commemorate the quincentenary in 1996 of its foundation. The site was
selected to the south of the Morley Horder neo-Tudor buildings on what is
now a car park and part of the Master's garden.
The college, advised by the architect Fellow, Nicholas Ray, prepared a
master plan and embarked on the delicate procedure of choosing an architect.
A committee of twelve, chaired by the Master, Lord Renfrew, considered 30 or
so firms and reached a shortlist of eight. Great care was taken, and the
eight firms were interviewed in their offices. Then selected buildings by
four of the original eight firms were visited and finally two were chosen to
prepare sketch proposals for the development.
Selecting an architect is a difficult business and the college procedure
seems to have been exemplary. The two firms finally chosen to compete were
Edward Cullinan and Partners and Evans and Shalev. Interestingly, the two
were briefed together and then paid a reasonable sum to prepare schemes that
had to be presented to the college and the whole fellowship. There was a
clear majority of Fellows in favour of the Evans and Shalev scheme.
Evans and Shalev are now best known for their law courts at Truro (winner of
the Financial Times Architecture Award) - a fine contemporary building that
is very sensitive to the townscape and context of Truro. They also won the
competition to design the Tate Gallery in Cornwall that is under
construction on a sensitive and important site in St. Ives. Their scheme for
Jesus College is first class and promises to add a very distinguished new
court to the college.
It deals with the difficulties of the historic context in a sensitive way.
The designers have sensed the architectural atmosphere of the college and
followed the language of well-proportioned windows in substantial brick
walls which are trimmed in real stone. There are pitched roofs behind
parapets that align in height with the rest of the college. These architects
understand appropriateness - designing what is fitting for the context but
with a strong character of its own.
There are three phases of the proposed development: firstly a new college
library and computing centre, secondly some 60 residential rooms, and
thirdly an auditorium to seat 200 with associated music teaching rooms.
Limited funds at present have meant that the architects have had to produce
designs that allow for a phased development and also for the unlikely
possibility that some phases may never be built.
The library will be built first. It has a formality and dignity that suits
its purpose as well as subtle and potentially beautiful lighting effects
from the unusual windows and vaulted ceiling. The circular top-lit stair is
reminiscent of the similar space at Truro, where it is a great success.
As the college has gone to such trouble to find good architects who have
prepared a sensitive and effective design for a difficult site, it is much
to be hoped that benefactions will soon be found to build the entire new
court to as high a standard as possible. What better way of marking five
hundred years of careful college growth on this beautiful Cambridge site?
