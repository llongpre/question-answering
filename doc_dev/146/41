In 1950 the Ordnance Survey published a map of monastic Britain which gave
the names and locations of the 900 monasteries and nunneries of the
pre-Reformation country. It is hard for us to imagine the holocaust of
destruction that followed King Henry VIII's suppression of the monasteries
and today it is difficult to conceive of a Britain that in some ways must
have been like Tibet - a land full of monks and nuns, even in its remotest
corners.
It was, I think, Sacheverell Sitwell who said that the great monastic ruins
of England were the equivalent of Cambodia's Angkor Wat or Egypt's Abu
Simbel. They seem as dead and defunct as those places because the ruins are
not even corpses but skeletons, with no traces left of the souls and minds
that once inhabited them. Even the most remarkable of all the monastic
remains in England, Fountains Abbey, demands a feat of imagination to evoke
the nature of the monastic lives that were followed there.
The problem, even in as remote and beautiful a place as Fountains Abbey by
the River Skell in Yorkshire, is that the remains of England's abbeys have
been secularised at least once in their long lives. Fountains' first
secularisation came at the dissolution; its second in the 18th century when
John Aislabie and his son laid turf in the fields around the abbey and
incorporated the ruin as a picturesque fragment in their new landscape
gardens. In this century, the remote and silent abbey ruins and the adjacent
landscape park of Studley Royal have been drawn closer still to the secular
world by waves of visitors and their cars.
In 1983 the National Trust bought the Fountains Abbey and Studley Royal
estate, acquiring not just the 18th-century landscaped water gardens, but
also the most complete Cistercian abbey in Europe. The Trust also acquired a
problem of the most sensitive kind. It was not just a matter of how to
restore and care for the estate, it was also a matter of preserving the
extraordinary atmosphere while coping with more than 300,000 annual
visitors.
It is the combination of landscape and architecture that makes Fountains
Abbey special. There are two aspects to this. When the monks of St Mary's
Abbey in York begged their superiors to remove them from the laxity of town
life in 1132, their archbishop selected Skelldale because it was 'a place
remote from all the world, uninhabited, set with thorns . . . fit more for
the dens of wild beasts than the uses of mankind'. To this aspect of
remoteness must be added the approach of the 18th-century landscapists, who
reduced the abbey ruins to picturesque features while elevating the entire
estate into a vision of the sublime imagination.
The National Trust has continued the development of the estate by planning
for the reception of visitors in ways that remove the worst aspects of the
visibility of car parking and allow more rewarding circular walking routes.
But the most important element is the new visitors' centre that has now been
opened after years of delicate treading of the planning tightrope. The saga
is in many ways a story of our times. The amount of local, regional and
national negotiation needed to build a centre that is, itself, dedicated to
the enhancement of the whole estate in retrospect seems almost unbelievable.
But the concerns were the correct ones; many people felt that the greatest
Cistercian abbey in Europe, in its wild valley, should be sacrosanct.
The selection of the architect was a vital part of the process and the
Trust's choice of Edward Cullinan and Partners was brave and inspired. The
choice of site to allow the invisibility of the centre from the abbey was
also important, but this did not mean that the centre should be designed as
a shy and retiring creature lurking secretly in a remote meadow. The
National Trust has taken the appointment of architects very seriously and at
Fountains Abbey the opportunity to add something of quality from the late
20th century was rightly considered to be important.
The result of this act of patronage is a remarkable new building located as
an incident in the entire landscape plan of the estate. The visitor
approaching from the new road now sees new axial views of the pinnacled
spire of William Burgess's High Victorian St. Mary's Church (built by the
pious Marchioness of Ripon in the 1870s). Aislabie's grand avenue, focused
on the distant view of Ripon cathedral, is another new, fine view. After a
sharp turn away from the obelisk of 1815 the road brings the visitor to the
new centre.
The initial view of the centre, which will be very different when the new
trees have grown, is something of a surprise. Cullinan's design is both
vernacular and flamboyant. Dry stone walls root the building to its site,
steeply pitched sandstone roofs and dramatically curved flying, lead roofs
seem to want to carry it to heaven. The architectural language is original,
owing more perhaps to Tolkien than to ecclesiastical towers. As the centre
is built around a courtyard, which opens at an angle on to a dramatically
foreshortened view of the top of the great abbey tower, the echoes of the
cloister are present without being over emphasised.
Inside the centre Cullinan displays his conviction that structure and the
construction process should be expressed. The steel frame can be seen
beneath the timber roofing joists, bolts and dowels are also visible
throughout. The sense of an architect playing with a parts kit is emphasised
by the architect's decision to utilise a colourful, even childlike palette
on elements of the timber ceiling (in the restaurant, the sensation of being
in the hall of a rather progressive new primary school is only just
avoided). But the architectural jollity is refreshing and the centre should
indeed have a sense of both pleasure and education.
I enjoyed the frisson of an architectural experiment, admired the marriage
of materials, and appreciated the air of anticipation provided by the siting
and landscaping of the centre. I know from the time I have spent on the
National Trust's architectural panel how hard it is to achieve the balance
between the undisturbed silence of historic places and the need to provide
for large numbers of visitors. Honeypots mean bees. At Fountains Abbey the
new hive is a highly skilled creation.
