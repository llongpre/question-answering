<LEADPARA>  Sunnyvale residents will get a chance to help plan their new downtown at two
community forums, and a 15-member Downtown Task Force will work closely with
the city to prepare a specific plan for revitalization of the central business
district.;    The city council created the committee last week and set up a
series of community meetings and public hearings. Adoption of the specific
plan, which translates decisions already made about the direction of downtown
development into design guidelines and other details, is expected in the fall.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The council last December approved new zoning to encourage construction of
apartments, offices, hotels, restaurants and entertainment facilities in the
city's historic center, culminating a four-year effort.;    Belated input;   
During the process the city was criticized for bringing the public into the
planning belatedly.;    Though no specific dates for forums and hearings have
been set, an initial community meeting early this month will define the scope
of the process for developing a specific plan that addresses design,
development standards, downtown identity and design treatment of public spaces
and open spaces.;    Council member Pat Castillo last week took the lead with
the task force, increasing the number of citizen representatives from five to
eight and eliminating representatives of three city commissions on grounds
that they'll get sufficient chance to review the plan before adoption.;    The
council accepted her suggestion that two residents be chosen from the northern
part of the city, three from the central section and two from the south. The
other citizen representative must be a Realtor or finance professional, the
council said.;    Representatives;    Other members will represent Town and
Country Village shopping center; the Chamber of Commerce; Hahn Corporation,
owner of the Town Center Mall; a small-business person; someone involved in
community theater; an architect or landscape architect, and a member of the
city Parking District Advisory Board.;    Castillo's revisions eliminated
representatives from the planning commission, heritage preservation commission
and arts commission.;    Chuck Wallin and Gary Lee, leaders of a group which
fought a successful battle last year to scale down the level of proposed
office and apartment development, urged a heavier representation from downtown
residents. Wallin said, "The staff's suggested makeup is obviously weighted
against the downtown residents who are directly affected by what's going on.";
   He said some representatives of business should be eliminated and one or
two downtown residents placed on the committee.;    Although Castillo proposed
her revisions after the two spoke, she said she already had worked them out
before she came to the meeting.;    "I felt it was important that they (task
force members) represent all the people, not just north, south, business or
whatever," she said.;    She said she left the parking board member on the
panel while removing the other city commissioners because "I felt parking is a
very crucial part of the site specific plan" and constant contact with the
task force needed to be maintained.;    The task force will be an advisory
group which will work with consultant David Miller, the city staff, the
planning commission and the council. It will be a source of ideas and a
sounding board against which the various aspects of the plan will be tested.; 
  The staff proposed that the task force meet four to six times during the
planning process.;    The specific plan activities will revolve partly around
a "village" concept for the downtown, with small scale development accessible
not only to motorists, but to pedestrians. Some elements of the plan could
include are architectural standards, lighting fixtures and street furniture, a
phasing schedule for public improvements, a circulation and parking plan and
concepts for economic development incentives.;    Both the Town and Country
Village Shopping Center, which the owners would like to tear down, and Town
Center Mall are in the area. Many view the mall as needing work to bring it
out from behind its parking garage and integrate it with the rest of the
area.;    The city also proposes to build a large performing arts center on a
parking lot near the Town and Country Village.; IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For
