<P>
When architects try to justify poor designs by pointing to low budgets, they 
should be exiled for a night to either of two single-room occupancy hotels 
(SROs) designed by architect Rob Quigley. 
</P>
<P>
These downtown buildings, the just-opened J Street Inn and the 4-year-old 
Baltic Inn, were done on a shoestring budget, $6.8 million, and provide 
sub-apartment-size rooms to low- and moderate-income folks, most of whom live 
and work downtown. And the projects succeed with a special flair usually 
reserved for pricier projects. 
</P>
<P>
At the Baltic, which opened in 1986, Quigley used standard low-budget 
construction methods to shape a building to manipulate light and space in 
interesting ways. 
</P>
<P>
Two light wells cut through the 209-unit structure, giving interior rooms 
plenty of natural light. Extra money and design time were dedicated to the 
entry, with its tall arch, neon lettering and colorful tile patterns. Only two 
front units have small balconies, but these add scale and texture to what 
otherwise would have been a flat stucco facade. 
</P>
<P>
The front of the Baltic is best known for its attractive, bargain-basement 
graphic: a large wedge of natural-color stucco that points to the entry. 
</P>
<P>
Rooms at the Baltic -- which was the first SRO to be built in the United States 
in 50 years and the first in California since 1914 -- are 10 by 12 feet, and 
include basic kitchens with small refrigerators and microwaves, and bathrooms 
with toilets only. Showers are down the hall. 
</P>
<P>
The J Street Inn is Quigley's second downtown SRO for a partnership including 
developers Chris Mortenson and Bud Fischer. The 221-room building, which took 
in its first tenants last week, is a step up from the Baltic, with larger (230 
to 308 square feet), better-equipped rooms. 
</P>
<P>
Known as "living units," the rooms are "somewhere between an SRO and a small 
studio apartment," Quigley said. They include full bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Rents at the Baltic start at $275 a month, while at the J Street Inn, the least 
expensive rooms are the 22 at $340 a month set aside for people earning less 
than $15,918 a year. Twenty-two additional rooms at $397 a month are reserved 
for those making less than $18,571, 88 for those making less than $26,500 and 
the rest for those making less than $31,836. Room rents are determined by 
income levels. 
</P>
<P>
In exchange for a $900,000 loan at 1 point over prime from the city's 
Redevelopment Agency, the developers agreed to rent to these low- and 
moderate-income groups for the 30-year life of the loan. If they comply, the 
loan and interest will be forgiven at the end of the term. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also asked for on-site parking. The J Street Inn has 92 underground 
spaces, which added nearly $1 million to the project's cost. Mortenson figures 
the new SRO's tenants are more likely to own cars than those at the lower-rent 
Baltic, which has 30 spaces on a nearby lot, but none on site. 
</P>
<P>
New SROs seem to have a strong market. So far, 88 of the J Street Inn's rooms 
have been rented. At the Baltic, occupancy averages about 85%, according to Joe 
Miller, a manager there. 
</P>
<P>
Where Quigley had little more than wood and stucco to work with at the Baltic, 
the J Street Inn's budget afforded more perks. Landscape architects Martin 
Poirier, Laura Burnett and Andy Spurlock of The Spurlock Office made the 
interior light wells into art events. 
</P>
<P>
The Baltic's light wells double as leisure space for the tenants, but, as it 
turns out, socializing tenants create a din that bothers other tenants who want 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
Mortenson told his designers that the interior light well at the J Street Inn 
shouldn't be usable or conventionally landscaped -- water causes problems when 
it seeps through to underground parking. 
</P>
<P>
To add a calming effect while giving tenants something to look at, The Spurlock 
Office designed two large but inexpensive art pieces for the light well. 
</P>
<P>
One is a fountain consisting of water coursing down a 50-foot length of 
galvanized storm drain pipe. The other is a diagonal concrete beam that 
disappears into the ground, tethered by stainless steel cables. 
</P>
<P>
Interior landscaping consists of crushed granite and seven stands of bamboo. 
Overall, the effect is of a low-budget Japanese Zen garden, and the attempt at 
serenity succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
Like the Baltic's, much of the J Street Inn's budget went toward the entry, 
with a tower extending on a diagonal to beckon you in from the corner of 2nd 
Avenue and J Street. The lobby is much larger than the Baltic's. First-floor 
ceilings are extra high, adding a sense of richness considering the budget. 
Colorful tiles help liven things up near the entry. 
</P>
<P>
Also like the Baltic, the J Street project uses a limited number of balconies 
to break up the building's exterior walls. Window awnings help, too. 
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the J Street Inn in the heart of the city's 
redevelopment area -- next to luxury housing such as One Harbor Drive, an 
expensive condominium project about to break ground across the street -- the 
city's redevelopment program shows encouraging signs of meeting diverse housing 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
The new Convention Center and several new downtown hotels require scores of 
blue-collar workers. The Quigley-designed SROs and several others recently 
completed or nearing completion offer clean, affordable living. 
</P>
<P>
But even with abundant new housing ranging from SRO rooms to luxury condos, 
downtown redevelopment isn't covering all the bases. 
</P>
<P>
As a variety of new redevelopment projects, including housing, have spread 
through the Marina Redevelopment Area south of Broadway and west of the Gaslamp 
Quarter, several older, very inexpensive SROs have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
This could well be the reason for the escalating presence of the homeless 
downtown, especially in Centre City East, a few blocks from the core of the 
Marina area. 
</P>
<P>
Two new SROs scheduled to open on 13th Street in August with monthly rents in 
the low $200s could help the situation. 
</P>
<P>
While SROs seem to be the predominant new building type in Centre City East at 
the moment, City Architect Mike Stepner doesn't feel they are being overdone. 
</P>
<P>
"To my mind, they are an improvement over vacant lots and abandoned buildings. 
I feel strongly that they can coexist with other forms of development. 
</P>
<P>
"There are lots of problem areas, but we're getting new development beyond SROs 
in Centre City East -- apartments, new commercial, the new Fine Art Store. 
Little things are happening that are slowly changing the area." 
</P>
<P>
Some people wonder whether more SROs should have parking, but Stepner doesn't 
believe the lowest-cost ones need it. Most of their tenants don't own cars. 
Only three of the 30 spaces in the Baltic's lot are rented by tenants, 
Mortenson said. 
</P>
<P>
"If there's a need for parking downtown in the future, it will be met by 
private-sector providers," Stepner said. 
</P>
<P>
Although many of the new SROs, including the Baltic and the J Street Inn, are 
large, they have only one entrance and offer no uses other than residential. So 
they contribute only marginally to the kinds of street activity that can 
revitalize neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
New SROs designed by Quigley for sites on Island Avenue and on India Street 
will break that trend with ground-floor retail and restaurant uses. 
</P>
<P>
Such mixed-use SROs would generate pedestrian traffic, which would help 
naturally buffer the impact of street people in places such as Centre City 
East. Veteran planners know that an intelligent blend of well-designed projects 
does a lot more than a beefed-up police force to make an urban core secure.
