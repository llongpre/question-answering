<LEADPARA>  THE WORST place to design a livable city is in a city council or planning
commission meeting. Fighting developers over the number of parking slots
doesn't leave time to contemplate the big question: What makes a city
livable?;    But Silicon Valley cities need that far-ranging inquiry to
prosper.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Fortunately, other institutions permit the experimentation that produces
fresh city shapes. The latest example is the newly completed College Eight at
the University of California, Santa Cruz.;    It wasn't meant as a lesson in
town planning, but the college, by San Francisco architects Simon Martin-Vegue
Winkelstein Moris, offers a 3-D model that could be adapted to the challenges
facing South Bay cities.;    A population of about 1,000 students live, work,
eat and socialize within College Eight boundaries. The dorms are the
residential neighborhood. The classrooms are the workplaces. The dining room
and cafe are restaurants and entertainment centers.;    That's the skeleton of
a city. But to flesh it out with character, appeal, mystery and memory is
another matter. College Eight is valuable because of the way it's designed.
It's focused. Each part is articulated. Everything is within easy walking
distance and is accessible by foot; towers and gateways are clear landmarks to
guide you. A rich variety of activities and shapes make an exciting
environment.;    You can tell the housing from the classrooms from the dining
rooms. Yet overall the college has a specific character. It's organized enough
to be immediately understandable but complex enough to give the variety that's
a city's lifeblood. Terraces allow people to congregate.;    The formal entry
is at the top of a hill, near the edge of the forest that conceals most of the
other colleges at the university.;    From afar it looks like a town. The
grouping of gabled structures have a civic heft to them. A vestigial
bell-tower dominates the skyline, a mini-campanile borrowed from Berkeley's
campus.;    The similarity to its sister campus doesn't end there. College
Eight's buildings sort themselves out on either side of a long axis like a
small-scale version of John Galen Howard's plan for Berkeley. The Beaux Art
symmetry is modified by some suitably Californian shifts and quirks along the
way.;    Though not classical in style, these stucco buildings echo the sober
demeanor of Howard's; they lack the witty play of Fernau and Hartmann's new
Student Center.;    The axis stair-steps slowly down the hill, pausing to
widen into plazas and terraces for outdoor music or sunning. Off the large
central plaza -- which someday ought to be graced by a fountain -- is the
college's great interior meeting space, the Dining Hall.;    The white stucco
of the public buildings gives way to panels of wood and trellis that give the
residential quarters a more casual feel despite their size; they're overgrown
camp cabins. The three-story dorms each wrap around a small courtyard open to
the ocean view.;    College Eight's lessons for cities such as Sunnyvale and
Milpitas: Tie nature into your town center; use images resonant of the place,
the history, the people; cluster buildings close together but counter that
with open plazas and vistas; use the natural variety of a town to give variety
to the architecture.;    They work for a small college. Can these lessons be
adapted to real cities?;    Mountain View is halfway there with its superb new
city hall and theater. But unlike College Eight's pedestrian axis, Mountain
View is stuck with Castro Street as its defining axis. For the time being it
will remain a linear town. Future housing, offices and stores can be woven
together with a master plan to focus housing, shopping, workplaces and
culture.;    Sunnyvale has more space to work with if the Town and Country
Village shopping center site is planned as a sizable pedestrian- oriented
district. An even better plan: Blow up that urban travesty, the so-called
"Town Center" mall, and devote even more space to a compact city center mixing
housing, shops, offices and parks on the College Eight model. Focus it on some
public building -- an arts center possibly -- and keep architectural standards
high.;    There's nothing radical about the urban concepts College Eight
champions. It's time to move them out of the small-scale experimental stage
and bring them into the civic arena. (box)  </TEXT>
