<LEADPARA>  IT'S THE ultimate case of turning a sow's ear into a silk purse: A garbage
dump on the Palo Alto bayshore has been transformed into a park of poetry and
pleasure.;   The first phase of Byxbee Park, located east of Highway 101 on
Embarcadero Road, opens today. Tied into shoreline bike paths, the park
returns part of the bayshore to a public hemmed in by asphalt. That alone is
good news. But Byxbee goes much farther. setting a new standard for public
landscape design.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Byxbee's designers, San Francisco landscape architects George Hargreaves
and Associates, are responsible for Market Plaza, the magnetic site in
downtown San Jose with a misting, bubbling, jetting fountain. Hargreaves also
designed the Guadalupe River Park.;   Each project shows the firm's rare
sensitivity to the character of a site. A park is more than a plot of grass
for picnics. Byxbee's imaginative design offers a place to commune with the
natural beauty of the South Bay while it acknowledges the presence of human
accomplishments.;   The eloquent Hargreaves' design draws inspiration from a
mix of elements in the site's vicinity. He weaves them together into a
provocative essay. That's the standard Byxbee now sets for every new
subdivision, every public park, every revitalized downtown in the South Bay.; 
 San Francisco Bay is both a working and a natural landscape. No longer the
pristine wilderness De Anza found, it is a playground, a home site, an
industrial center. Man-made additions -- the giant power poles wading just
offshore Byxbee, airplanes landing at Palo Alto Municipal Airport nearby, even
the garbage lying beneath a thick clay seal -- are part of a landscape that
cannot and should not be ignored.;   Utilitarian power lines and airports may
seem unconventional elements for a public park, but this park has something to
say about how we co-exist with nature. The result is a design far bolder and
more appealing than any other recent public landscape, whether park, plaza,
business park or boulevard. Those may provide some pleasant greenery but have
absolutely nothing to say. Adding nothing to our understanding or appreciation
of our environment, they are literally dumb.;   Instead of hiding the park's
literal roots in garbage, its artificial hills and dales reflect the sculpted
clay cap over the 60-foot mounds of refuse. In place of trees whose roots
could crack the clay cap, low native grasses cover most of the park. Even the
required methane gas burn off is highlighted in a small fenced area with a
key-shaped concrete pad for service trucks. The invisible flame's heat waves
distort the air and view like a lens, literally altering our perceptions.
That's what the entire design does.;   The Palo Alto Municipal Airport just
north of Byxbee is another unexpected element integrated into a park.
Single-engine aircraft buzz over the park throughout the day, casting shadows
on the grass. To mark that fact, Hargreaves places a series of low concrete
chevrons stepping down the slope under the flight path. For a pilot they point
to the runway's edge. From the ground these low concrete walls create a series
of stairs that will retard rainwater runoff. Over the years, these weirs will
develop their own crop of lusher grasses and wildflowers to mark the flight
path. The park design builds in a process of organic change.;   A pathway of
crushed oyster shells -- they add a springy crunch under your feet -- winds
through the park's features. Near the parking lot is the land gate, a dam of
earth breached by an opening reminiscent of the sharp, faceted planes of a
highway cut. From its crest stretches one of the park's panoramic vistas
focused on the giant hangar and air tunnel at Moffett Field as well as
Shoreline Amphitheater's tent. Like gigantic toys, these are the only local
features big enough to add counterpoint to the hills.;   Topping the mounds
nearby are small hillocks facing into the wind like seagulls. Their teardrop
forms mirror the natural forms of land eroded by wind. Covered with grass,
they lose all scale and blend with the silhouettes of the distant East Bay
hills -- visually tying the foreground with the distant view. Hargreaves thus
manages to borrow the magnificent slopes of the East Bay and make them part of
his design -- a clever and inexpensive way to visually expand the size of his
client's property.;   The park's northeast tip is planted with a field of 72
evenly spaced poles. They rise out of the earth like the pilings of an
abandoned pier in the bay, or like 72 sundials tracing the sun across the sky.
Their tops describe a tilted plane whose strict geometry adds another
counterpoint to the undulations of the ground. Part Stonehenge, part seagull
perch, some poles tower overhead, some are short enough to sit on.;   Byxbee
Park is rooted in tradition: Like 19th-century Golden Gate Park, its rambling
paths are carefully plotted to lead through a mix of sheltered refuges and
dramatic prospects. But it charts a new course by making no attempt to create
the illusion of a natural setting. Like Brazilian Roberto Burle Marx, the
world's greatest living landscape architect, Hargreaves is as interested in
reflecting man's culture and its inventions as he is in nature and its
wonders.;   Byxbee Park is superb design. Every planning department, developer
and architect ought to study it. The Palo Alto Arts Commission that shepherded
the idea from its inception has made a tremendous contribution to the South
Bay. If we're lucky, it's started a trend. (box)  </TEXT>
