DIRK SUTRO / ARCHITECTURE: TRIBUTE TO S.D. WOMEN

<P>
Commonly held wisdom has it that Irving Gill is San Diego's sole legacy to the 
world of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Pick up almost any architectural book, and, if it mentions San Diego at all, 
the reference is usually to Gill. 
</P>
<P>
In one sense, he has been this city's most significant innovator of the 20th 
Century, designing clean-lined, modern buildings beginning in 1907 or so, years 
before Le Corbusier, Mies Van Der Rohe, Loos and others became modern 
architecture's heroes. 
</P>
<P>
But there are important San Diego architects and designers largely ignored by 
history. Among them are the three women featured in the exhibit "In Harmony 
With the Land," opening Saturday at the Museum of San Diego History in Balboa 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
Women in Architecture and the San Diego Historical Society are teaming up to 
present the show, which will run through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Opening at the same time and running through Sept. 10 is "That Exceptional 
One," a tribute to 100 years of female architects, dating back to 1888 when 
Louise Blanchard Bethune became the first woman member of the American 
Institute of Architects. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three San Diego architects featured in the local show, Lilian Rice is 
the best known. Also included are Hazel Waterman and landscape designer 
Harriett Wimmer. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Believed in Total Site Planning 
</P>
<P>
The show's title is meant to reflect the way all three women believed in total 
site planning, with close relationships between buildings and their surrounding 
landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
Rice is best known for the Spanish-influenced buildings she designed in Rancho 
Santa Fe between 1922 and her death in 1938 at the age of 49 from an 
undiagnosed case of appendicitis. 
</P>
<P>
Rice was working for Richard Requa, the well-known designer of many of San 
Diego's finest Mediterranean-style homes, and his partner Herbert Jackson, when 
they were commissioned to come up with a master plan for Rancho Santa Fe and 
design several buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Because the commute from San Diego would have occupied too much of the 
partners' time, they turned day-to-day details over to Rice, and she eventually 
designed many of the buildings on Paseo Delicias in the business district of 
Rancho Santa Fe, as well as about 60 houses. 
</P>
<P>
Today, these buildings house Quimby's and Mille Fleurs restaurants, Ashley's 
market and other local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
At the time, some of the only buildings in the area were adobe ranch houses 
dating back to the mid-1800s. With these -- and probably the San Diego County 
missions -- in mind, the Santa Fe Land Improvement Co., the developers of 
Rancho Santa Fe, decided that Spanish-flavored architecture would be 
appropriate for the new community. 
</P>
<P>
Many of Rice's buildings in Rancho Santa Fe have tile roofs, deep-set window 
and door openings, interior courtyards and carefully laid-out gardens linked to 
the homes by French doors and generous windows. Most have white stucco walls 
that imitate the thick, plastered-over adobe found on buildings in the 
Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
"She wasn't a pioneer or innovator; she was carrying out the plan the 
developers wanted," said Lucinda Eddy, who completed her master's thesis on 
Rice at the University of San Diego in 1985 and helped organize the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
But there is more to Rice's work. Outside Rancho Santa Fe, her residential 
designs have an entirely different appearance. Many use horizontal wood siding 
and shingle roofs, with interior walls paneled in redwood. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of this style is the rustic ZLAC Rowing Club at 1111 Pacific Beach 
Drive. A high ceiling supported by heavy redwood beams rises to a peak above a 
hardwood floor. French doors open out on a veranda at the edge of the beach on 
the shore of Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
Rice learned to love natural materials while studying architecture at 
University of California, Berkeley, when the department was headed by John 
Galen Howard, who designed many campus buildings. Buildings such as the rowing 
clubhouse echo the organic, Craftsman style that Rice saw in the work of 
Howard, Bernard Maybeck and other San Francisco-rea architects. 
</P>
<P>
Although Rice's buildings are simple in form and materials, they do a masterful 
job of manipulating light and space. 
</P>
<P>
"She wanted her structures to be an extension of the outdoors," Eddy said. "Her 
houses were intended to be details in the landscape." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Subtle Innovations 
</P>
<P>
Although it is easy to pass off Rice as a talented but unoriginal designer 
heavily influenced by her mentors, her best work is innovative in subtle ways. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine replacing the tile roofs on many of her Rancho Santa Fe homes with the 
flat roofs preferred by Gill, and her buildings show a strong relationship to 
modernism. Examine the way she masses and composes a home such as the Carpenter 
residence of 1928, and you see the eye of an artist at work. 
</P>
<P>
Like Rice's, the work of Waterman, who apprenticed with Gill and his partner, 
William Hebbard, is also under-appreciated. (Waterman later hired Rice as her 
own apprentice.) 
</P>
<P>
As Eddy pointed out, Waterman's success is remarkable considering she had only 
a year of college work in design and learned architecture from correspondence 
courses. Gill hired her after he designed a house for her and her husband and 
sensed she had talent. 
</P>
<P>
Many of her finest designs, including buildings in Balboa Park for the San 
Diego Children's Home, completed in 1925, are no longer standing. But 
photographs of them, and buildings such as her Wednesday Club (1911) at Ivy 
Lane and 6th Avenue, show that she assimilated Gill's flat surfaces, arched 
openings and carefully placed square and rectangular windows. 
</P>
<P>
While Rice and Waterman are well-represented by drawings and historic photos, 
Wimmer's work is tougher to document, according to Eddy. Wimmer laid out 
landscapes mostly in her head, so no drawings ever existed. Instead, her work 
will be represented by several photographs, and the lineup is impressive. 
</P>
<P>
Working with landscape architect Joe Yamada, who became her partner in 1960, 
Wimmer handled plant selection and placement for Scripps Institution of 
Oceanography, areas of the UC San Diego campus, Sea World and many homes. 
</P>
<P>
Next Thursday, in Room 102 at the Casa del Prado in Balboa Park, Sally Bullard 
Thornton, the author of a biography on Waterman, and Barbara Thornburgh Carlton 
will discuss Waterman's work.
