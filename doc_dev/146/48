   After 30 years of committees, proposals and no
small amount of bickering, a downtown center opens this week giving
Seattle a combination town square, office tower, shopping arcade,
bus station and monorail terminal.
   ``That's a minor miracle,'' says Stephen Koehler, president of
Koehler McFayden &amp; Co. of Seattle, one of the project's
co-developers.
   ``There's so many people and so many ideas of what was going to
go into the small space called Westlake, that it's really
impossible to make all the people happy about this. But I think the
overwhelming majority will like what's here.''
   What's here is a 24-story office building, a five-story shopping
and restaurant pavilion and a one-acre city plaza on a roughly
triangular wedge in the middle of the city's retail district. It's
a compromise of three decades of discussions, lawsuits, civic
commissions and studies over what to do with one of the few open
spaces left in Seattle's core.
   ``It's been such a controversial project for so long, I'm just
kind of glad it's done,'' says Mayor Charles Royer.
   Westlake Center was formally opening today amid speeches, bands,
doves and 50,000 balloons.
   Koehler McFayden and The Rouse Co., the Columbia, Md., developer
of such projects as New York's South Street Seaport and Baltimore's
Harborplace, built the $110 million office and shopping complex. It
adjoins the $18.9 million Westlake Park, paved in multi-colored
granite to resemble a Salish Indian basketweave pattern.
   The center's lower level opens to a station of a bus tunnel to
be completed next year. The third floor is the terminus for the
one-mile monorail ride to Seattle Center, site of the 1962 world's
fair.
   Westlake, at the junction of Westlake Avenue, Pine Street and
Fifth Avenue, has long been a place to find flower vendors, hear
street musicians and political speeches, and to duck out of the
rain beneath the old monorail terminal.
   It's also a place to shop. Bordering are large department
stores. A few blocks away is the Pike Place Market, a collection of
fresh fish and vegetable stalls, bakeries, espresso cafes and
open-air entrepreneurs.
   Since the 1950s, when the city closed a two-block stretch of
Westlake Avenue, the site has been the focus for big plans.
Proposals have included a pedestrian mall, a hotel-shopping
complex, a home for the Seattle Art Museum and a central city park.
   Downtown merchants wanted to attract shoppers. Open-space
advocates, including the late Victor Steinbrueck, an architect who
battled to save the Pike Market, wanted a central plaza, a ``living
room'' for the city.
   Steinbrueck, head of the Committee for Alternatives at Westlake,
led a successful legal fight to block a plan by Royer to locate the
art museum at Westlake. That led to the city agreeing to the joint
venture by Rouse and Koehler McFayden in 1983.
   Construction began in January 1987. The result pleases the
developers, satisfies the city and is accepted with mixed feelings
by Steinbrueck's son, Peter.
   ``Seattle lost a great opportunity for a grand square,'' says
Steinbrueck, himself an architect. But, ``I think the park and
shopping pavilion will be a major enhancement to the retail core.''
   Steinbrueck thinks the park is good architecturally. He's less
kind about the center, which he says blocks Westlake Avenue from
the plaza and doesn't fit with nearby buildings. And the ``awful,
tacky blue glass'' of the tower's windows creates an eyesore, he
said.
   Royer says the city has ``a clear winner'' in the retail center,
but thinks it might be a while before the park becomes popular.
   ``It's sort of like a new shoe, it will take a little time for
it to become comfortable as a gathering place,'' said Royer.
