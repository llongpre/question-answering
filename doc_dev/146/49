FT  24 JUL 92 / Letter: Central Park bandstand project aims to recapture
historic design

Sir, Let me clarify some of the issues raised in 'New York's oasis of the
park' (July 13), an account of New York City Parks &amp; Recreation's proposed
removal of the Naumburg Bandshell from Central Park.
When Central Park was built, Frederick Law Olmsted included an octagonal
cast-iron bandstand designed by Jacob Wrey Mould on a grassy area to the
west of the mall. This bandstand remained until 1923 when it was demolished
owing to its dilapidated condition, and replaced by the current bandshell on
the east side of the mall. Now my agency feels that this facility, too, has
seen its day, and should be removed.
Unlike the original bandstand, which was open on all sides, the massive
stone bandshell broke up the sweeping vista along the mall that Olmsted had
intended. From the Wisteria Pergola atop the hill behind the bandshell, it
was no longer possible to enjoy (as Olmsted had intended) a panoramic view
of the mall and lake.
For the next 50 years, popular classical concerts were held at the bandshell
 -until 1980, when the Naumburg family concert series abandoned the
bandshell for Damrosch Park at Lincoln Center because the site had become
too loud and active for their concerts. As no one wanted to use it, the
bandshell fell into decay.
The mall is now in the final stages of an 18-month, Dollars 4m restoration.
The project's purpose is to recapture the historic design of Central Park's
most architecturally formal space, and to offer New Yorkers an unparalleled
green setting featuring lawns and permanent seating under a cathedral canopy
of elm trees. The bandshell has become an anachronism that attracts illegal
activity and vandalism.
The removal of the bandshell will restore the area to Olmsted's original
plan, and make the area safer. My agency cannot afford to commit its limited
resources to restoring and maintaining structures that no longer serve a
useful public function.
