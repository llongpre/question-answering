SAN DIEGO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This city has been arched, peach-stuccoed and tiled to death in the quest for 
the elusive "regional style." Awkward combinations of these elements are 
marching across the county like so many Stepford wives. 
</P>
<P>
The planned expansion of Seaport Village could rise above it. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by San Diego's Hope Architects &amp; Engineers, this new cousin of the 
existing Disneyland-style tourist mall will take its cues from the old police 
station on Market Street, a large part of which will form the heart of the new 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Completed in the late 1930s, the station was one of the last projects from the 
offices of Quayle Brothers &amp; Treganza. Some of its ornate Spanish Colonial 
details -- especially on two entry arches and a tower -- make it one of the 
finer remaining San Diego buildings from the latter end of a romantic period in 
local architecture that began in 1915 with the richly detailed buildings in 
Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
The big question is this: Can we trust the Seaport Village developers, led by 
M. B. Taubman and Lee Stein, to come through with the commitment the project 
deserves? 
</P>
<P>
Such a commitment will mean dollars, probably tens of thousands, to give the 
project the detailing it needs. Otherwise, it will join the ranks of the local 
Stepford family, just another drone. 
</P>
<P>
Hope, one of the biggest local firms, isn't an obvious choice for the project. 
Its work, spanning 60 years in San Diego, has generally tended in recent years 
toward large, often disappointing corporate build 
</P>
<P>
ings. First National Bank, formerly Columbia Centre, at Columbia and B Streets, 
is one example. Its greatest single shortcoming is its failure to involve 
pedestrians at the street level, a problem that would be even more intolerable 
at people-oriented Seaport Village. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the Seaport addition, the firm made a conscious decision to steer 
clear of a slick, easy solution. 
</P>
<P>
At Hope's downtown offices recently, project architect Bruce Green brought out 
the firm's initial design, an attempt to contrast, rather than work with, the 
police station. 
</P>
<P>
"Originally, I thought we needed a glass pavilion or something out front, like 
I. M. Pei added to the Louvre," Green said, pointing out just such a bauble. 
But, during four years of design work, the approach shifted to one of 
harmonizing with the police buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The project looks inviting. Arched police station entries to be preserved on 
Market and Pacific Highway will send a romantic call to pedestrians. A new 
entry on Kettner Boulevard near Market (soon to become the realigned Harbor 
Drive) appears to mirror the existing architecture in scale and form, but Green 
said the detailing has not yet been selected. 
</P>
<P>
You get the feeling that Green, who has historic-preservation background, would 
love to see authentic plaster-cast details applied. But such quality is rare in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
As for the inside of the project, it will emphasize shops and restaurants 
grouped around a large L-shaped courtyard the developers call their "Night 
Court." For one cover charge, patrons can do justice to a variety of 
restaurants and night spots, including a "jazz and blues club." 
</P>
<P>
Like the exterior decoration, the design details of the interior shop facades 
are still up for grabs. A soon-to-be-hired consultant will work with Hope on 
guidelines here. Inappropriate materials such as large commercial aluminum 
windows should be written out of the project. 
</P>
<P>
Compliments go to the developers for including people-oriented elements in 
their project, such as a 300-seat open-air amphitheater, a new water's-edge 
Ferris wheel and the wonderful 1890 Looff carrousel, to be moved to a central 
location next to a new, man-made pond. 
</P>
<P>
What's happening along the waterfront has as much to do with the spaces between 
buildings as with the buildings themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The realignment of Harbor Drive is just part of waterfront plans that also 
include the potentially stunning "linear park," now being created by landscape 
designers Peter Walker and Martha Schwartz, with local architects Austin Hansen 
Fehlman Group. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, this long, narrow strip of landscaping and art, which will tie 
pedestrian, auto and trolley circulation neatly together, will extend down the 
new Harbor Drive nearly to the edge of the Seaport addition. 
</P>
<P>
Green said thick landscaping placed to camouflage the new parking garage and an 
extra-wide pedestrian strip at this corner will help relate Seaport Village to 
the linear park. 
</P>
<P>
Water figures prominently in the expansion. Taubman, founder and chairman of 
Seaport Village, has called the theme "water, water everywhere," including 
fountains and the new central pond by the carrousel. 
</P>
<P>
As for tying the project to the existing Seaport Village, the older complex 
doesn't have a thing to do with this '80s Spanish Colonial revisited, and it's 
a bit too theme-park-oriented anyhow. So scale, not style, will link the new 
Seaport to the old. The back of the addition will include smaller-massed 
buildings that open onto the pedestrian space behind it. 
</P>
<P>
Several fine old palms ring the police station, both singles and impressive 
clusters. Landscape architects ONA Inc. have recommended keeping them, which 
makes both historic and economic sense. According to Green, replacement 
groupings of six or so mature trees could cost $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
There are several good signs here. With this project, Hope has a chance to set 
an example for the other giant San Diego architectural firms. If the architects 
are sticklers for detail, and the developers don't balk at spending for 
quality, the project's completion sometime in 1992 could prove that it is 
possible for corporate-size architecture machines to turn out sensitive, 
human-scale projects.
