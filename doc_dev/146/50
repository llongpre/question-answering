Some architects would rather face a school of hungry sharks than the layers of 
design review most projects go through these days. In particular, designing 
buildings along the coast, where local sentiments run especially deep, can be a 
touchy process. 
</P>
<P>
Yet two elegant new oceanfront hotels -- the Sheraton Grande at Torrey Pines in 
La Jolla and L'Auberge Del Mar -- prove that extensive design review can 
produce better buildings. Feedback from local government and community factions 
helped, in both cases, to produce thoughtfully designed hotels with minimal 
impact on San Diego's precious coastline. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, L'Auberge Del Mar is the more successful design. Inside and out, it 
conveys a low-key, homey warmth through intimate scale and materials such as 
brick and wood shingles and beams. The Sheraton, by contrast, is a sound, 
modern building that suffers from a few lapses in detailing. Rooftop vents and 
air-conditioning equipment, for example, are eyesores to motorists on North 
Torrey Pines Road. An exterior of white stucco and reflective glass makes the 
place about as inviting as a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
A significant portion of L'Auberge's sensitive design is directly attributable 
to concerned Del Mar citizens and politicians. Architects Jim Galvin and Joe 
Cristilli of Galvin Cristilli Architects spent four years refining the project 
to meet the community's desires. The $30-million, 123-room hotel, which opened 
in July of last year, was subject to voter approval. It didn't pass until its 
second time on the ballot in February, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The city had good reason to proceed with caution. The hotel site is a key 
downtown corner at 15th Street and Camino Del Mar, where other corners are 
occupied by a bank, the new Del Mar Plaza retail complex and Stratford Square, 
a 1927 Tudor-style building. Strong traditions came with the location. Many 
locals fondly remember the 1909 Tudor-style Inn at Del Mar that was torn down 
in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
But Galvin and Cristilli's new hotel suits downtown Del Mar well, even though 
its Tudor-based design has a contemporary flair. 
</P>
<P>
L'Auberge takes many of its cues from Stratford Square, which houses the 
popular Carlos &amp; Annie's Cafe. Steep, gabled roofs and tan stucco walls 
make the two buildings cousins. But the architects did not imitate Stratford 
Square's Tudor half-timbering with its vertical, horizontal and diagonal boards 
applied to exterior walls that give an appearance dating back to 16th-Century 
England. 
</P>
<P>
City officials and citizens were as concerned about the new hotel's siting and 
size as they were about its style. Set back generously from the street, with 
parking well concealed underground, the hotel is a gentle presence. Wood 
trellises shade public areas and soften the hotel's visual impact. Lots of 
brick adds to the Old World atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
A retail annex and the hotel's main restaurant are both near the street. These 
public attractions also make the hotel an especially good neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
The key corner of the project -- at 15th and Camino Del Mar -- is essentially 
an offering to the citizens of the city, and comes complete with a small 
concrete amphitheater. A park-like pedestrian entrance is enhanced by a 
man-made stream and waterfall, which mask the din of nearby traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Cars reach the project via driveways slightly removed from the corner, thereby 
keeping the pedestrian entrance clear. And hotel rooms are arranged in three 
wings, which are aligned with neighboring blocks of condominiums to the west in 
order to save view corridors. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the hotel's main entry off Camino Del Mar a gabled, glassed roof floods 
the lobby with natural light. Overstuffed chairs, a Citizen Kane-sized brick 
fireplace and big ceiling beams painted with a delicate floral pattern give the 
place a country-style charm. 
</P>
<P>
The $60-million, 400-room Sheraton, which opened in November at the edge of 
Torrey Pines Golf Course near UC San Diego, could use more of L'Auberge Del 
Mar's careful detailing, especially on the exterior. 
</P>
<P>
Architects Welton Becket Associates of Santa Monica gave the building a stark 
front of white stucco and copper-colored reflective-glass windows with green 
mullions. With its wide concrete driveways, the Sheraton looks more like an 
office building than a place you'd want to spend a relaxing weekend. By 
contrast, the pocket decks, patios and outdoor public dining areas visible 
around the edges of L'Auberge Del Mar make it immediately inviting. 
</P>
<P>
In its favor, however, the Sheraton makes only a minimal impact on its coastal 
bluff site. 
</P>
<P>
Fearful of the crash danger posed by ocean-borne fighter jets leaving Miramar 
Naval Air Station a few miles inland, the Navy played a key role in dictating 
the hotel's low profile. Designed for maximum safety, the structure is partly 
embedded in the bluff, with several key meeting rooms and a main restaurant on 
lower floors. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the University City Planning Group served as a watchdog during the 
design process, making sure the hotel would suit its site and surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
Architecturally, the Sheraton borrows from its neighbor, Scripps Clinic, which 
was designed by Edward Durell Stone in the 1970s, as well as the Salk 
Institute, architect Louis Kahn's 1960s concrete masterpiece. The hotel's 
pattern of square windows vaguely echoes the squares of Scripps Clinic's 
exterior. Rooms in the hotel's wings are angled to capture fantastic views of 
the golf course and ocean, in the same way that the Salk Institute's labs and 
offices gain their views. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is laid out with four wings strung behind the long front building, 
which houses the lobby and main hallways. Between the wings, three large 
terraces provide great ocean views. A pool in the middle courtyard is 
surrounded by classical stone railings with large concrete posts topped with 
flower-filled urns. 
</P>
<P>
Inside, the Sheraton is a mixed bag. A high-beamed ceiling over the grand lobby 
makes the space as comfortable as a Rocky Mountain ski lodge. At the back of 
this impressive space, wide stairs descend to the Torreyana Grille restaurant. 
Nearby, a curving wall of glass provides light and great views of a pool and 
formal terrace outside. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheraton is decorated in a vaguely Southwestern style with expensive 
materials and furnishings, including slate floors, marble-topped counters and 
odd metal lighting fixtures in the form of gnarled shrubs. A provocative art 
collection ranges from abstract and figurative pieces to wiry metal coyotes 
poised in niches. Sometimes the materials get too glitzy, as with the the 
gigantic, copper-trimmed fireplace and the mirrors behind overhead planters. 
</P>
<P>
Both hotels compare favorably with the best of San Diego's new hotels downtown, 
as well as in the Golden Triangle near University Towne Centre. 
</P>
<P>
Both hotels compare favorably with the best of the new hotels downtown and in 
the Golden Triangle area, near University Towne Center. And both prove that 
when architects lend an ear to outside opinions, they can create buildings that 
please both their users and their neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Canceled: Because of limited audience response, a symposium on Frank Lloyd 
Wright scheduled for Sept. 15 has been canceled. The program, organized by the 
San Diego Architectural Foundation and sponsored by the foundation and the San 
Diego Museum of Art, will not be rescheduled. Tickets can be refunded through 
Ticketmaster.
