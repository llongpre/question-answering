For most business travellers to New York, fighting the locals for pavement
space is the only exercise they ever get.
In such a crowded, noisy place, who could imagine jogging, or even taking a
leisurely walk? However, New York offers jogging and walking routes with
ample breathing space.
When they want the solitude of woods and water, New York runners head for
Central Park, the leafy, 843-acre urban sanctuary opened in 1876. The park's
department says it has the city's lowest crime rate. But it recommends
runners avoid the park at night and run with a partner if possible.
One of the most popular routes in the park is a 1.6-mile gravel track around
the Reservoir, the largest body of water in Manhattan. The access point is
at 90th St. and Fifth Ave. The reservoir offers mallard on the water and
occasional appearances by such celebrity exercisers as Jacqueline Kennedy
Onassis and Madonna.
For a longer course, there is Central Park's auto loop - six miles of
hard-surface road closed to traffic on weekends. The auto loop bypasses
great expanses of woods and lawns, including one near West 72nd St called
Strawberry Fields, which is dedicated to the memory of John Lennon.
A run in Central Park takes you past many Victorian-era architectural gems.
One is Belvedere Castle, built in 1872 of the same stone that is found
thrusting dramatically out of much of the parks' landscape. With Norman,
Gothic and Moorish features, it overlooks the Great Lawn's softball fields.
Other popular access points to Central Park are at its south-east entry
(Fifth Ave and 60th St) and south-west corner (Columbus circle).
In the thick of Broadway traffic, it might be hard to remember that New York
is an island. But a refreshing jog along some of the city's waterfront
promenades will quickly set you straight. Skirting the Hudson River, the
one-and-a- half-mile-long Battery Park City Esplanade begins at the downtown
intersections of Chambers and West Streets.
It continues south almost to Battery Park and the tip of lower Manhattan.
The route takes you past the World Financial Center and the North Cove Yacht
Harbor. The Hudson kicks up stiff breezes. These are cooling in summer but
blood-chilling in winter.
On the east side of Manhattan, the East River Esplanade offers a three-mile
course, from 63rd St, north to 125th St. On the left, cars whiz by on the
FDR Drive. But there are more tranquil sights, such as Gracie Mansion in
Carl Schurz Park. Built as a country manor house in 1779 by wealthy merchant
Archibald Gracie, it is now the official home of the city's mayor.
Many New York hotels offer advice on the best running routes. The
Ritz-Carlton, on Central Park South, distributes maps to its guests that
detail three routes of varying length. The maps also list emergency
telephone aid numbers.
