Although architecture is arguably the most permanent of the arts, the focus of 
the profession can be very ephemeral. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, the focus has been on how buildings look and what sort of 
statement they make. 
</P>
<P>
But lately, there seems to be a healthy shift in the focus to a concern with 
how buildings function within particular settings, how people use buildings and 
how buildings affect the life around them. 
</P>
<P>
It's also appropriate that this issue of design priorities -- being at least as 
concerned with the experience of buildings as with their potential individual 
expressiveness -- be raised in this damp Northwest city. 
</P>
<P>
It was here seven years ago, that the bulky, grossly colored and flamboyantly 
decorated municipal building designed by Michael Graves was unveiled, and 
subsequently hailed, and then condemned as a landmark of the Post Modernist 
movement. The Princeton-based architect was touted by profession icon Philip 
Johnson, acting as a competition adviser to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
The building generated star status and a bevy of commissions for Graves. And it 
put Portland on the architectural map as the site of the "most important 
significant American building of the decade," according to a prominent East 
Coast design critic. 
</P>
<P>
Now, seven years later, the Portland Building, as it is called, seems oddly 
faded and does not command a second look, except for a monumental, figurative 
sculpture of a graceful maiden above its entrance. It remains, as it did when 
dedicated, an isolated architectural object, not particularly friendly to 
passing pedestrians or users. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the design focus in downtown Portland these days has shifted and 
broadened. It is distinguished not only by the preservation of landmarks, but 
also how buildings are sited and scaled, and how they are knit together by 
streets and sidewalks to create an engaging urban scene. 
</P>
<P>
We are not talking here about the image of a building or an ensemble of 
buildings as an isolated object, leaden with symbolism, to be viewed as a piece 
of sculpture, preferably from a distance. But rather, about how buildings 
function at ground level, what spaces they create, the experience of bordering 
sidewalks and streets, broadly defined in the design profession as the public 
realm. It is the stuff of urban design. 
</P>
<P>
Helping is Portland's traditional sensitivity to open space, light and air -- a 
sensitivity heightened by the cloudy conditions here part of the year. When the 
sun shines, everyone wants to enjoy the rays and not be in the shadows of a 
bulky building. Accommodating this are wide sidewalks, a network of open 
spaces, edged with benches and spotted with fountains, several inviting plazas 
and parks, and an attractive light-rail system serving downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The result is an accessible, humanistic city offering a wealth of lessons in 
urban design. These include how buildings are scaled so as not to overwhelm 
streets, how their ground floors line the streets with engaging shops and 
stores, how detailing such as brickwork lends color and safety to pavements, 
how parks are made inviting to all and how people are encouraged to park their 
cars and get out and walk, even in the rain. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the lessons are not new. 
</P>
<P>
What is happening in Portland is going on in varying degrees in many other 
cities. San Francisco a few years ago approved an imaginative, if 
controversial, plan to protect its downtown streetscapes that many felt were 
being overwhelmed by indifferent commercial monoliths. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a renewed appreciation in our design reviews of how critical 
pedestrian life is to the building, the street and the city," comments Edward 
Helfeld of the city's redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
And San Diego is looking much closer and carefully at how new developments 
might generate more active street life, instead of discouraging it or 
channeling it into the privatized world of a mall. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings should not be viewed as pieces of sculpture but as part of a puzzle, 
suggests Michael Stepner, who recently was appointed to the newly created 
position of city architect. He notes his major concern is urban design. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles there also seems to be an increasing awareness of the importance 
of urban design, particularly in the planning of large-scale developments. 
</P>
<P>
Note the recent debates concerning the shaping of the open space for Phase 2 of 
California Plaza, the interest in the streetscape designs in the Library Square 
area and the concern for how the Grand Avenue Plaza proposal will affect the 
historic scale and tone of 7th Street. 
</P>
<P>
Most environmental reviews now include an urban design element evaluating how 
particular developments will relate to neighboring buildings, and bordering 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"As the city becomes more dense, the nature of the spaces between the buildings 
becomes more critical," observes senior city planner Deborah Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
This increasing awareness should be especially encouraging to those concerned 
with the livability of the city. 
</P>
<P>
After all, contrary to some opinions, Los Angeles is more than some sort of 
facade seen from a freeway erected overnight like a backdrop for a movie set, 
but a place where some people might actually want to get out of their cars and 
stay awhile.
