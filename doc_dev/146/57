<LEADPARA>  TWO VISIONS of suburbia's future, as different as night and day, are working
their way through the San Jose planning process right now.;   One is a
suburban Versailles, complete with bubbling fountains and an old world flavor.
The other is a space-age Telegraph Hill with a microwave tower in place of
Coit Tower.  </LEADPARA>

Perspective.; Architecture  </MEMO>
<TEXT>     Yet they have some things in common. Both use scarce land more wisely with
increased housing densities. Both attempt to give an identity to what they
perceive to be the faceless sprawl of the modern suburb.;   The Evergreen
Specific Plan -- the suburban Versailles -- is further along; the City Council
approved it last July and a final draft is being prepared. Communications Hill
Specific Plan is completed and an EIR is being prepared. The council may see
it as early as December.;   Both plans came out of community task forces and
the planning commission's encouragement.;   The plans' differences highlight
the issues that architects and planners face in the new suburbia. Will we
continue to design for the car or for light rail? Will we encourage diversity
or homogeneity? Will we keep paving farmland like there's no tomorrow? Can a
suburb also be a community? This week's column looks at Evergreen's solutions;
in my next column Communications Hill will be the focus.;   Evergreen Specific
Plan's 865 acres are on the eastern edge of the city by the Mirassou Winery,
bordered by Quimby Road on the north and stretching south of Fowler Road. The
site, currently agricultural, slopes up to include the lower foothills.
Creekbeds crisscross the site and will be included in the new plan. Over this
canvas the planners, the Dahlin Group of San Ramon, spread a web of grand
boulevards radiating out from traffic circles. A wide mix of housing,
including townhouses, in-law units and single-family homes, fills in between
these main streets.;   Taking advantage of the rolling landscape, the planners
place prominent civic features -- community centers, shopping centers,
schools, lakes and parks -- on these traffic circles. As with Washington's
street pattern, these landmarks serve as focal points to identify
neighborhoods. Children and adults will be able to walk from nearby homes to
these areas designed for the pedestrian.;   The Village Center on one of these
hubs spotlights the primary difference between this plan and today's suburb,
where shopping centers punctuate the intersections of wide commercial strips.
In those familiar places, a line of stores is set far back from the road, with
acres of asphalt between. At the new Village Center shops, theater,
restaurants and services will ring a small public plaza in the middle of the
hub. Parking will be behind the shops, with separate store entries off the
parking lot in good California style.;   I dispute the idea that current strip
shopping centers lack identity or urban focus. And the Evergreen plan still
accepts the car as the governor of urban form. The Village Center may create a
walkable oasis, but the carscape behind the stores will still be the face most
of the public will encounter. Evergreen offers an evolutionary step in melding
the car landscape and the pedestrian.;   As important to the plan as the
radial streets are the architectural standards. The new district is to be
Mediterranean, and the plan goes into unusual detail in specifying roof
slopes, materials, paving patterns and other details to keep the architecture
unified.;   The tile and stucco stylistic theme, encouraged by the
landowner/developers sitting on the task force, reflects historical themes
seen in current housing all over Santa Clara Valley. What's daring is
stretching that theme over such a large area, including houses, businesses and
civic buildings. This is a theme town.;   Evergreen Specific Plan's biggest
potential pitfall is that it cannot ensure architectural quality. Theme parks
-- just as self-consciously styled and about the same acreage as the Evergreen
project -- are fine for a day or two, but can wear thin as a lifetime abode.
Evergreen's architecture could easily degenerate into the cutesy aesthetic
platitudes of a Hallmark Christmas card, or a Laura Ashley catalog.;   What
Evergreen's architecture will need is guts. This is no time for mere
prettiness. The report gives lip service to California's fine Mediterranean
traditions. It takes great pains to associate itself with San Jose's Williams
Street Park area, and the graceful older neighborhoods bordering The Alameda.
But developers should be put on notice that they will have to live up to those
standards. Now, before any construction starts, is the time for the planning
department to look long and hard at that tradition and see why towns like
Santa Barbara have stood the test of time.;   The new Evergreen district could
change the face of suburbia, but that's exactly why it should avoid trying to
design everything right away. It is in danger of becoming a little too
polished, too polite, too inoffensive for real life. Evergreen shouldn't
become a town so tasteful it squeaks.  </TEXT>
