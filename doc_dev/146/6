DESIGNS FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSING -- WITH CHILD CARE IN MIND

The future of child-care facilities in the San Fernando Valley may be in the 
hands of 11 young architects from the Southern California Institute of 
Architecture in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
The students recently gathered at the Warner Center Marriott to showcase their 
innovative designs for low-income family housing, which may be pooled and 
eventually built on a 7.8-acre site in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
Integral to their designs are housing and commercial spaces that are tied 
together, providing a mini-community where residents would live and work -- and 
where child care would be available for their children. 
</P>
<P>
Instructors within ARCH (Architectural Response to Community Housing), a design 
studio at the school that promotes low-income housing, have guided the students 
for 15 weeks as they have drawn and built prototypes of their communities. Also 
advising the students are L.A. Family Housing Corp., which has developed 
affordable family housing for low-income working families for six years and the 
2-year-old Center for Childhood Creativity, run by Cal State Northridge in 
Warner Center, which creates and implements innovative child-care solutions. 
</P>

"I told the students of the importance for homelike environments," said Dianne 
Philibosian, project director of the childhood center. "We've begun to focus on 
providing spaces, but not what happens in those spaces. I tried to communicate 
that," she said, adding that one particular architect really understood her 
concepts. Philibosian walked to a scale model of The Village, designed by Robin 
Morris, a fourth-year student at the architectural institute.

Center of Model 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the model is a child-care center fronted by a park. Fanning 
out from the facility are commercial zones, including professional offices, 
restaurants and crafts stores for children. Residential units, as in all the 
students' designs, are above retail spaces. Families living in the housing 
units, which curve in a semi-circle around the child-care center, could easily 
look out on the park and center should they want to see their children at play. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking of the playful aspects of children when I designed the space," 
said Morris, 32, who lives in Redondo Beach. A pyramid-shaped, stepped fountain 
with mini waterfalls is near the child-care center, and water also flows around 
a circular entrance leading up from the underground parking facility and 
through the tree-lined park. A bridge spans Canoga Avenue, depositing visitors 
in the project's first retail zone, which contains clothing, video and 
convenience stores. 
</P>
<P>
"Children are people, and one needs to be in touch with them, rather than 
applying our adult concepts of what a children's area should look like," 
Philibosian said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole idea behind this development is that you can work, live and play in 
one tight community," Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
"The designs are very unlike L.A.," said Arnold Stalk, executive director of 
L.A. Family Housing Corp. "But that doesn't mean it won't work. It's an attempt 
to solve a multitude of problems with one development -- affordable housing 
needs, economic development and child care. 
</P>
<P>
"Land is so scarce and expensive now that you're going to see more residential 
and commercial development." 
</P>
<P>
Stalk said residents could lease commercial space or entire families could be 
sponsored by a business while their children are cared for nearby. Families 
would stay in the community for a maximum of five years until they were 
established financially to move on to their own enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Stalk, ARCH and others are negotiating to purchase the land from the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power. Should the project be realized, the 
students will pool their ideas under the supervision of established architects 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the reason I designed the project was to realize and discover the 
child within me," Morris said. "As we grow older, we grow full of logic. The 
playful aspect gets denied."
