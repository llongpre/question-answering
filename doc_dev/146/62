WATERFRONT HOTEL MOVES CLOSER TO CONSTRUCTION

A proposed 41-story luxury hotel between Seaport Village and the San Diego 
Marriott's twin towers moved closer to construction Tuesday. The San Diego 
Unified Port District unanimously backed the project but asked for several 
minor architectural changes. 
</P>
<P>
The board, which last July approved the conceptual plan for the sprawling 
waterfront project, met Tuesday to review design changes prompted by the 
expansion of the site to 5.91 from 4.75 acres when the city realigned Harbor 
Drive. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from a pair of complaints from environmental groups, and minor aesthetic 
recommendations from the Port District, the process went smoothly for Doug 
Manchester, president of Torrey Enterprises and chief developer of the project. 
Manchester owns the adjacent San Diego Marriott Hotel and Marina. 
</P>
<P>
Manchester argued that, in order to attract the major gatherings of trade 
associations it wants and needs for the new Convention Center to thrive, San 
Diego "demands" the hotel space that would be provided by the Hyatt Regency San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
One of his architects -- several flew in for the meeting, one from Dallas, the 
others from San Francisco -- said the new Hyatt hotel would be an 
"architectural showplace" for San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
"I know of several large groups and associations that wanted desperately to 
come here for their conventions but deferred to other cities," Manchester said. 
"The reason is, at the present time, we just don't have the space." 
</P>
<P>
Christopher B. Neils, Manchester's attorney, said Convention Center management 
has indicated it needs at least 2,000 hotel rooms adjacent to the waterfront 
site. Neils said the Marriott now provides 1,400, and the additional rooms 
provided by the Hyatt Regency (about 900), would push San Diego over the 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
"I think this project is worth about $60 million to $70 million a year for the 
economy of San Diego, not to mention what it will bring in occupancy taxes and 
new jobs," Manchester said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Manchester's presentation, also involving landscapers and attorneys, 
failed to win the commissioners' complete and immediate backing. Commissioner 
Lynn Schenk abstained from voting on the matter, saying only she hoped the 
project was "public friendly" and served the interests of San Diegans as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-0 vote merely endorsed a motion, asking Torrey and its band of architects 
to redesign the 7,000 square feet of retail space, confining it to one building 
instead of the three separate structures now in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
Several commissioners expressed concerns that "undesirables" -- meaning 
transients or homeless persons -- might congregate in the corridors between the 
buildings. They also asked that the retail area be moved back, farther from the 
waterfront. And, finally, they expressed interest in having a trellis cover the 
top of a six-story parking garage to make that structure more aesthetically 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
Neils, the attorney, said he hoped construction could begin "within two 
months." Although the hotel is now an 8-year-old undertaking, with Hyatt's 
involvement having reached the six-year mark, Neils said he hoped construction 
would be completed in 28 months. 
</P>
<P>
One person objecting to the project was Judy Collins, a spokeswoman for 
Citizens' Coordinate for Century III. Collins argued that the environmental 
impact report for the project, approved in 1984, is no longer relevant because 
it fails to consider other new construction in the area. 
</P>
<P>
"The EIR considered only this project," Collins said. "We want it to consider 
the Convention Center, the Marriott and the expansion of Seaport Village." 
</P>
<P>
Jay Powell, a spokesman for the Environmental Health Coalition, raised 
questions about the project, saying it fails to address the modern downtown 
concern of "de-watering" -- the ability of new buildings to withstand 
hydrostatic pressure (to resist the intrusion of contaminated underground 
water). 
</P>
<P>
Powell left the meeting dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"I would much rather have heard an explicit statement from the developers 
saying, 'We're convinced we can handle hydrostatic pressure,' rather than 
several guys looking around and asking, 'Uh, I think it's OK, don't you?' "
