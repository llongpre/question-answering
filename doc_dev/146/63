<P>
Only a few months into a new decade, San Diego architecture is showing signs of 
significant breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
Not only are local architects addressing social problems by designing 
interesting, economical buildings, but they are exploring architectural 
languages more suited to this area than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
Four out-of-town architects came to these conclusions after spending two days 
here last week to select the winners of this year's design awards from the 
local American Institute of Architects chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps there was no better sign of the times than the sole winner of an honor 
award the top level of achievement): architect Rob Quigley's J Street Inn 
downtown, a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO) done with plenty of imagination 
on a limited budget, but without some of the whimsical frills Quigley added to 
earlier projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely well handled," said juror Leigh Breslau of Skidmore Owings 
&amp; Merrill, Chicago. "The layout was good, the entry was well defined, the 
ground floor public spaces, such as the reading room, are well identified. 
Colorful tile mosaics outside help make it very unstigmatizing for its (low 
income) users." 
</P>
<P>
Overall, 16 winners were selected from 132 submissions. Awards were given in 
three categories: honor, merit (second level) and citation of recognition 
(third level). 
</P>
<P>
Besides Quigley's honor award, he earned citations of recognition for the 
not-yet-built Sherman Heights Community Center, the new Escondido Transit 
Center, the interior light fixtures at the Linda Vista Library and the Beaumont 
Building downtown, which contains the architect's offices and penthouse 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
The library award came under a new category called "Divine Detail." Glass 
display panels at the Dale Fitzmorris dress shop in La Jolla, designed by M.W. 
Steele Group, became a second "Divine Detail," in this case a merit award. Also 
new this year was the "Interior Design" category, with a citation of 
recognition also going to M.W. Steel's dress shop. Jurors admired a low-key 
interior that lets the bold designer dresses sell themselves. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley's award for the Beaumont gave the architect some vindication; the 
building has been the subject of much debate, loathed by many, loved by a few 
and misunderstood by most. It received an undeserved Onion in last year's 
Orchids &amp; Onions program, the public's idea of the best and worst local 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so different from anything else, it certainly has an eccentric quality," 
said juror Joe Esherick of the San Francisco firm Esherick Homsey Dodge &amp; 
Davis. "For people who don't want to view the unexpected, it must be a shock. 
But the closer I got, the more impressed I was. If people would imagine going 
into the building, enjoying the experience, they'd understand it much better. 
The idea that you make a snap judgment whether to like something or not is like 
judging people, not letting them speak to us and reveal their inner thoughts 
and aspirations." 
</P>
<P>
The winning projects were recognized last Saturday night during a program at 
the Aventine in La Jolla, a project designed by Princeton, N.J., architect 
Michael Graves. The Aventine borrows pseudo-classical forms and rich materials, 
and the setting offered quite a contrast to this year's winners, mostly small 
projects done with a restraint the jurors found refreshing. 
</P>
<P>
Clients -- developers, public officials, and others -- deserve some of the 
praise for this year's winners, especially for their attentions to low-cost, 
socially oriented buildings that in the past have been written off as necessary 
evils. There seems to be a growing awareness that, even on projects with modest 
budgets, good architecture can be had. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Quigley's SRO, honors given to buildings with a social conscience 
included a merit award to Visions Architects for the Lemon Grove Community 
Center (for seniors), plus citations of recognition to Casa de las Madres, a 
not-yet-built home for unwed mothers in Escondido designed by Rene Davids and 
Christine Killory, Quigley's community center, and the not-yet-built Marina 
Court downtown apartments by the Austin Hansen Group. 
</P>
<P>
Breslau praised the Davids and Killory project for its floor and site plans, 
and called the forms "solid, recognizable, well massed." 
</P>
<P>
Juror Norman Pfeiffer of Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer in Los Angeles liked the Marina 
Court as a good "background" building, and credited the architects for 
proposing various knock-out wall panels to allow apartments within the building 
to be configured in a variety of sizes. 
</P>
<P>
The evening's socially responsible aura continued through three public 
buildings honored. Though such buildings don't address social problems, they 
are built with public money. As such, they do genuine social duty, inspiring a 
civic pride in public architecture that hasn't been felt often in San Diego 
County in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
Besides Quigley's library and transit center, the other winning public building 
was a fire station in Sorrento Valley designed by Visions Architects (merit 
award), combining simple box-like forms in an interesting way. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's new downtown convention center, designed by Canadian architect 
Arthur Erickson -- with help from design consultants Loschkey Marquardt &amp; 
Nesholm and San Diego architects Deems Lewis McKinley -- received a merit 
award. Apparently jurors were able to overlook the poor city planning that 
allowed this massive but well-designed edifice to close off the waterfront from 
public views and easy access. 
</P>
<P>
"There are just a lot of masterful things there," said Esherick. "The sail 
structure on top is especially nice." 
</P>
<P>
The Tsao residence in Singapore, by Pacific Associates Planners Architects, won 
an award of merit. Jurors were impressed with the way the architects, led by 
Randy Dalrymple, subtly captured the architectural character of its city. 
</P>
<P>
Other citations of recognition went to a not-yet-built visual arts facility by 
Neptune Thomas Davis in association with Rebecca Binder, and architect Richard 
Yen's own studio. 
</P>
<P>
Last, but not least, jurors gave a special "distinguished building award" to 
Bertram Goodhue's California Tower in Balboa Park, the centerpiece of one of 
San Diego's most romantic architectural groupings. Completed for the Panama 
Pacific Exposition in 1915, the tower was no architectural breakthrough, but in 
the context of Balboa Park, it gives a large set of buildings the kind of 
visual focal point most new developments so sorely lack. 
</P>
<P>
One of the few negatives the jurors voiced was a certain sense of impermanence 
to some of the buildings, partly due to their materials (often stucco) and 
less-than-perfect detailing. 
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, the AIA architects who run the awards program, 
including awards chairman Russ Stout, have invited jurors with credits on both 
large and small projects, hoping more large projects will be honored. This 
year, though, they found no worthy large projects, tending to confirm one's 
suspicion that, in San Diego, big developers are still more knowledgeable about 
making money than making good buildings.
