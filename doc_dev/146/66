STOCKHOLM FAIR, 1930; New York World Fair, 1939; Festival of Britain, 1951;
Brussels World Fair, 1958; Montreal, 1967; Osaka, 1970 - the list of great
exhibitions this century has offered a great series of opportunities for
architects and builders to raise structures symbolic of their times. How
often have the opportunities been seized to make architectural and
engineering advances that might compare to the daring originality of the
Crystal Palace designed for the Great Exhibition in London of 1851?
It was in 1929 that Seville last hosted a great international exhibition,
the Exposicion Ibero-Americana which was a companion to the Barcelona
Exposicion Internacional in the same year.
This year, the original plan was for Chicago to share the commemoration of
the 1492 journey of discovery to America by hosting a parallel event in the
Windy City. It would also have marked the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition
 -one of the most architecturally magnificent fairs on the shores of Lake
Michigan but its palaces were made of plaster and decidedly temporary.
Architecturally, what is to be made of Seville's expo? Siting the Expo on
the 500 acres of the island of La Cartuja provided a more or less virgin
site around the old monastery. The situation also necessitated new bridges
and an upgrading of the river banks which will be a positive and lasting
benefit to the city. The island site has natural limits and so any visitor
may well be surprised at the very high density of the exhibition layout.
There are 103 participating nations and, although the planning allows for
shaded walks and fountains, the pavilions are crammed together.
The architectural dilemma facing any designer for a pavilion for a world
fair is how can contemporary architecture, which is more or less a universal
language, be used to exemplify national characteristics ? National
architectural styles do appear at Seville, but the overall appearance is of
futuristic modernism in keeping with the theme of 'Discovery' which runs
through the fair.
The organisers of the fair did lay down some ground rules for designers.
They insisted on what they called 'urban architecture' - more substantial
designs than is usual for temporary exhibitions as some 35 per cent of the
structures will remain as will most of the infrastructure as the basis of a
science and research park. Maximum height limits have been imposed (up to 25
metres) and, in the turgid language of the brief, 'homogenous density of
building following a city/garden typology', has meant an agreeable scale and
a sense of an extremely well landscaped site.
There has also been insistence upon 'green' environmental conditions and the
use of water and planting to ensure some relief from the intense heat of a
Seville summer. There is also a unity of design in the street furniture,
signage, paving, pergolas, and fountains. The overall sense of a site
devised to reflect the best features of outdoor Mediterranean life looks
very successful.
The whole site is organised into a series of five international avenues, and
an avenue of discovery that is the backbone of the expo. There is also a
series of special public and performance areas around water. There are,
besides the national pavilions, theme pavilions on subjects such as
'discovery', 'the future' and 'navigation', and the Expo Building itself,
which has a definite future as a World Trade Centre.
It is the Avenue of Europe (designers Hennin and Lippsmeier) which is the
visible centre of the site. Here is also made plain the difficulty that
modern designers have in expressing political ideas in any convincing built
form. The 12 countries of the European Community are represented by 12
30-metre high towers.
In shape these towers resemble the chimneys of the old Carthusian monastery
and they are also designed to cool the air in the manner of the simple
towers that cooled Moorish houses in Spain and North Africa. At the centre
of the European boulevard is a giant plastic funnel composed of a swirl of
translucent flags of the 12 nations. The lack of any shared symbolism is
depressing - the glorious union of a free Europe that has vanquished
communism and atheism is not represented ]
For the visitor it is worth singling out some of the most interesting
architecture of the national pavilions. With more than 100 to choose from
the selection has to be subjective. The most cohesive and effective example
of national architecture is the Japanese pavilion designed by Tadao Ando. It
is a 25-metre high timber structure that is reminiscent of a brooding
ancient temple. An escalator and staircase climb steeply to the bridge that
is at its centre. It is both monumental and simple - and cleverly
representative of both the past and the present in Japan.
The Greek pavilion (architect Mariano Villalonga) looks like a truncated
petrol station with a few attached columns; and the Italian pavilion
(architects Gae Aulenti and Pier Luigi Spadolini) sadly is more like an
office block than the fortified Italian palazzo it is supposed to represent.
The Hungarian pavilion (architect Imre Makowecz) is a remarkable and
beautifully built example of a national tradition. Representing a
seven-towered wooden rural church, the interior is filled by a complete
tree, its roots visible through a glass floor. The symbolism is clear - a
country wanting to show that its roots belong in the west and it is now free
to celebrate both its history and its future.
The British pavilion is designed by Nicholas Grimshaw and it takes up the
water theme of the expo in a spectacular way with a wall of moving water as
the main elevation of the pavilion. Is there some significance that the
British pavilion faces down the Avenue of Europe but has to be entered by a
bridge over the troubled waters of its own moat?
As an example of high-tech architecture the British pavilion is one of the
most rational designs and visually undoubtedly a great success. It is
worthwhile to compare it with the German pavilion - another exercise in
structural virtuosity designed by architect Lippsmeier.
Although the architectural opportunities at Seville have been significant I
suspect that it will be the planning of the site and the landscaping efforts
that have been made to cope with the extremes of climate that will be of
more lasting interest and value. Visitors will probably sense how hard it is
for contemporary international architecture to reflect national values. The
memory they take away will be of trees and fountains and perhaps the
brooding presence of Japan.
