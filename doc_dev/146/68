<LEADPARA>  Hoping to boost tourism, cut traffic and improve pedestrian access between the
Santa Cruz Municipal Wharf and the boardwalk, the Santa Cruz City Council on
Tuesday night approved a beach promenade plan designed to give the city's most
popular tourist destination a face lift.;    The council adopted a study from
the landscape architects of Callandar Associates of Monterey that has been in
the works for more than two years.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The numerous streetscape, architectural and design improvements planned for
the beach area will take years and an estimated $4.1 million of public and
private money to complete, city officials say.;    But if the 55-page document
is fully implemented, they expect the beach area to be dramatically improved.;
   The entrance to the wharf, currently a confusing mixture of one-way streets
and concrete islands, will be altered to include a turnaround for incoming
shuttle buses. Washington Street will be realigned to connect more cleanly
with the wharf, and gates will be placed at the entrance to the wharf to
regulate traffic.;    Construction on the intersection is scheduled to begin
this fall.;    Under the new plan, visitors still will be allowed to drive on
the wharf, but city officials have suggested limiting the time cars can stay.
Parking meters would be removed from the wharf, but motorists would be charged
per half-hour.;    The redesign of the wharf intersection is the most
controversial part of the four-phase plan because it involves the removal of
51 parking spaces from Beach Street and from the lot that now sits in front of
the wharf. At several public hearings during the last year, residents
complained about the parking loss.;    But planners said improving the
shuttle-bus access cuts down on traffic congestion, negating the need for the
spaces during peak summer weekends.;    "This is meant to improve tourism in a
matter compatible with pedestrian accessibility," city planner Kathy Barbaro
said Tuesday.;    Another part of the plan calls for widening sidewalks in
front of the Dream Inn and along Beach Street to the boardwalk. Palm trees
will be planted along the new promenade, public kiosks installed, murals
painted and several beach overlooks constructed.;    There will also be new
bicycle racks, park benches and gooseneck pedestrian lights installed between
the wharf and the San Lorenzo River.;    Although the bulk of the project lies
on public property, the plan encourages private businesses to spruce up their
images, suggesting, for example, that owners erect canvas awnings or paint
their buildings bright colors.;    A sample financing plan estimates about
$2.5 million of the $4.1 million total will come from city sources. Another
estimated $1.2 millionis expected to be borne by merchants, who will be asked,
but not forced, to make improvements on their property. The remainder would
come from the Coastal Conservancy and other funds.  </TEXT>
