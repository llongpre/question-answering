Last week an editorial in the FT spoke of the differing political visions
that are vying for supremacy in the construction of the new Europe.
Naturally enough it was concerned about international perspectives for the
new community and the prospects for political and economic progress.
Architecture was not mentioned, but it does have an important role, both as
visible evidence of material progress and as an outward sign of historical
and cultural values.
1992 is the year for architects to take advantage of the opening up of the
single market, and British architects would be well advised to look both at
the enormous opportunities and the strength of the architectural
competition. Two particular countries demonstrate these facets of the
situation very clearly. One is the newly united Germany; the other is the
recently democratised Spain.
At a conference recently held at the Bauhaus called Berlin scenarios of
development, one speaker summed up the opportunities for Berlin. 'Berlin is
like a gigantic zip being pulled together again as quickly as possible . . .
not only through streets and squares . . . transport links, telephone lines
. . . but first and foremost in the stomach, the heart and the head.' The
zip also has to reunite ancient centres with development that has happened
since the last war in the pulsating western sector around the
Kurfurstendamm. How long will it take to remove the scars of communism, to
resolve the curious paradoxes and contrasts that exist particularly in what
was East Berlin ?
Take a walk down the Unter den Linden and pass, as you now can, through the
Brandenberg Gate going east and you are faced with one of the most
paradoxical views in Europe. Just before reunification the East German
government refurbished Karl Friedrich Schinkel's bridge, the Neue
Schlossbrucke, reinstating the massive statues and the beautiful ironwork.
But the view from this masterly neo-classical monument is of the hideous
Palace of the Republic  - a monument to communism which was built on the
site of the gutted Royal palace. It is said that even Krushchev was
astounded by the ugliness of this 1950s monster and deplored the demolition
of the palace, which could have been restored.
The decision to move the government of Germany from Bonn to Berlin
guarantees big architectural opportunities. Will they be seized? How will
any new plans embrace the ideologies of the past that linger so strongly?
Last year the Deutsches Architektur Museum in Frankfurt invited 17
international practices to explore ideas for the architectural reunification
of Berlin. The competition's mood was summed up by the brief: to find 'an
architecture for a City of Tolerance.'
Hitler tried to plan a Berlin, with his architect Albert Speer, that would
rival the Rome of the emperors: axial routes were to focus on glorious state
buildings, all of them large enough to defy any rational sense of
proportion. Some of the internationally famous architects in last year's
competition produced schemes of a scale and fatuousness that perhaps only
Speer would have understood. Zaha Hadid simply developed the axial ideas
into a motorised monster of a city designed as a focal 'star of routes.'
Norman Foster, on the other hand, saw that what the city needed is a
peaceful centre. He planned to make the site of the Berlin Wall into a park
 - a green calm ribbon on the site of so much death and sacrifice. Robert
Venturi and Denise Scott Brown extended the Kursouthern boundary of the
Tiergarten  - rather like a long New York style Fifth Avenue alongside a
park. It was probably the German architect OM Ungers whose ideas were
closest to the spirit of the city. He proposed islands of monuments and
imposing buildings that could read as icons, or important markers, in a
largely suburban city.
Anyone who has visited Berlin when it was divided will have experienced that
curious sense of being on a series of urban islands. When you reached
Potsdam, or sat on a beach by the Wannsee, this sense of being remote but at
the heart of something large and important is very palpable. Berlin is as
much trees, water and gardens as it is monuments and good public housing.
British architects and developers are gradually rising to the prospects of
work in the city; let us hope that they first co-operate to create an
efficient but humane infrastructure that ties up the city's wounds before
imposing any rash of international hotels and uniformly mediocre commercial
blocks.
It is in Barcelona that the urge to give democratic Spain a modern
international face is most visible.
The Japanese architect Arata Isosaki's Olympic Stadium, now that it copes
with the rain, promises to be a successful and stylish venue for the games.
But it is architects in the Catalan region who have recently produced a
whole range of subtle new buildings that combine the best of the
Mediterranean and the modern.
The most well known architect working in Spain, Rafael Moneo, is also one of
the very best in Europe. His museum for Roman antiquities in Merida has that
rare quality, architectural good manners.
What are we to make of the gigantic conference centre at Salamanca designed
by Juan Navarro Baldeweg? In some ways its great dome rising from a cube is
reminiscent of the neo-classical design of the monument for Frederick the
Great that Gilly produced and which so inspired Schinkel. Has the
neo-classical wheel come full circle in Spain rather than in Berlin?
Architecture is the built language of the times, which today are complex and
contradictory. As the new Europe settles down to 1992, I shall be writing
about how things progress in Berlin and Spain.
