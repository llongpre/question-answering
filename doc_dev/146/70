A 60-year-old Wilshire Boulevard department store considered a prime example of 
the Zigzag Moderne architectural style of the 1920s will receive the 1990 
Landmark Award in the Los Angeles Business Council's beautification awards 
program. 
</P>
<P>
The Landmark award to the former Bullock's Wilshire building (recently renamed 
I. Magnin Wilshire), at the corner of Westmoreland Avenue and Wilshire 
Boulevard, honors buildings that have become a part of the historical 
conservancy of the city. 
</P>
<P>
The beautification program was begun 20 years ago by the business council. This 
year's presentation luncheon will be held on April 2 at the Hotel Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
Other awards pay tribute to developers, architects and contractors for 
outstanding achievements in new and remodeled residential and commercial 
development and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Project winners in four Perpetual Awards categories are First Interstate World 
Center, the Jeffrey Tamkin Award for outstanding new commercial high rise; 
Venice Renaissance, the Alan Casden Award for outstanding new multifamily 
residence; the Robert Bridges home, the Ray Watt Award for outstanding 
single-family residence, and Tillman Water Reclamation Plant, the Kaufman &amp; 
Broad Award for outstanding new public or civic project. 
</P>
<P>
A new award given this year for Outstanding Public Interior singles out the 
Home Savings of America Tower Sky Lobby in this category. 
</P>
<P>
"Our awards program had 70 submissions this year, which represents a 25% 
increase over last year," said Richard Magee of Richard Magee &amp; Associates, 
chairman of the council's urban beautification committee. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe this year's entries also reflected a higher percentage of quality 
projects, which may indicate that developers are becoming more aware of the 
need for quality design in a market that has become increasingly competitive." 
</P>
<P>
Judges were Dan Dworsky, president, Dworsky Associates Architects; Lawrence R. 
Moline, LRM Landscaping; Harshad Patel, president, Harshad Patel Design 
Consortium, and Michael Rachlin, Rachlin &amp; Rachlin Inc. Magee served as 
panel moderator.
