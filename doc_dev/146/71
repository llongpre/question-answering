The first phase of the long-awaited Japanese Friendship Garden in Balboa Park 
will open this summer, the garden's landscape architect said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The 11 1/2-acre project, which has been contemplated for more than 20 years, is 
being built in five phases and will cost $11.4 million. The group sponsoring 
the garden, the Japanese Friendship Garden Society Inc. of San Diego, has 
raised $1 million so far to help complete the initial phase. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an outdoor ceremony on a spring-like day in the park, landscape 
architect Ken Nakajima told the gathering the first phase will be completed by 
July or August. Work began in January at the site on the rim of Gold Gulch 
Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
Nakajima, who built a similar garden retreat in Moscow, was in town to consult 
with the joint construction team of Shimizu America Corp. and Nielsen 
Construction. Founded in 1804, Shimizu is the oldest and largest construction 
firm in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The entire garden should be completed in 10 years, said Larry L. Marshall, 
president of Japanese Friendship Garden Society Inc. of San Diego. Work will 
occur as funding becomes available. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall said that "when we negotiated the 50-year lease with the city in 1984, 
we knew that it was unlikely (we could) . . . raise all the money to build the 
garden at one time. That's why we designed the garden in phases." 
</P>
<P>
The city has pledged to donate $2 million, and plans to turn over $500,000 in 
June, Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
Included in the first phase are an exhibit room, a gift shop, snack bar, and an 
administration office. There will also be a sand and stone garden and a picnic 
area. 
</P>
<P>
"We have a master plan, and the garden will continue to get better," he said. 
"The zoo has been around for more than 50 years, and it is still adding 
attractions. We will be second only to the zoo in attraction." 
</P>
<P>
The master plan for the garden was approved by the City Council in 1979. The 
garden has been named Sankei-en, which means a garden with three types of 
scenery. When finished, it will feature a pond surrounded by paths, pastoral 
and mountain retreat settings, a tea house, culture center, arbor and exhibit 
building. 
</P>
<P>
For all the anticipation, this is not the first time a Japanese garden has been 
built in Balboa Park. A tea garden, complete with a pavilion and a small tea 
plantation, was built for the 1915 Panama-California Exposition. This is the 
75th anniversary of the exposition. The garden was dismantled in the 1950s to 
make way for the Children's Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
In the early 1960s, the San Diego-Yokohama Sister City Society began to make 
plans to replace the one torn down. 
</P>
<P>
Gold Gulch Canyon was selected as the new site in 1968, and the Charles C. Dail 
Memorial Japanese Gate was erected just north of the Organ Pavilion. And until 
January, that was the last construction on the project. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the garden committee of the Sister City Society transferred control of 
the project to the new Japanese Friendship Garden board, which eventually began 
raising funds for the garden. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's ceremony, the San Diego chapter of Ikebana International, a 
nonprofit floral organization, donated $10,000 and the Kearny Mesa Rotary Club 
gave a $5,000 donation collected from five Rotary clubs in Japan.
