IT'S TIME TO RESTORE THE VISION OF A DOWNTOWN BAYFRONT PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
John Nolen, a turn-of-the-century urban planner, envisioned bringing San 
Diego's two premier natural attractions, Balboa Park and the sea, into "direct 
and pleasant relation." He suggested parks, gardens, a museum and an aquarium 
at the bay and an inland civic center, all connected to Balboa Park by a 
"suitable" parkway or boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Time passed Nolen's creative idea by. But San Diego City Councilman Ron 
Roberts, an architect by trade, thinks it's time to fulfill Nolen's dream. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts recently called for a 16-acre park at the foot of Broadway, to form a 
ceremonial entrance to the city. The park would have an amphitheater facing the 
bay and would be surrounded by museums on the ground floors of adjacent 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The bayfront park, which Roberts calls Paseo Park, would be "linked" to Balboa 
Park by landscaping along Broadway to the planned civic center at 12th Avenue 
and then up Park Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
Roberts' plan is just conceptual, and the details will need full debate. But 
overall, it's very promising. Open space is virtually nonexistent downtown. And 
what better place for a downtown park than along the waterfront, which is in 
danger of being walled off with high-rises? 
</P>
<P>
Establishing museum space around the park also makes good sense. It would be an 
intelligent complement to Balboa Park, which cannot accommodate all of the 
museums and cultural institutions vying for space there. A bayfront museum 
complex would also reinforce the link between the park and the water. 
</P>
<P>
But a waterfront park will take a good deal of cooperation among the city, the 
San Diego Unified Port District and the Navy, because the park would occupy 
Navy and Port District land. 
</P>
<P>
Louis Wolfsheimer, chairman of the Board of Port Commissioners, has expressed 
enthusiastic support for the plan. But the Navy has been hesitant. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy has plans for a large office-and-hotel complex on its property just 
south of Broadway, and Paseo Park would displace one of the high-rises in its 
plan, costing the Navy millions of dollars it proposes to use to pay for its 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
In deference to Nolen's vision, the Navy plan also includes a park, although it 
would cover only 5 acres. And the Navy has already scaled back its plans once, 
to address city concerns. So its reluctance to endorse Roberts' proposal may be 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
But Roberts' proposal for a 16-acre park is an improvement on the Navy's plan, 
and we hope that, together, the Navy, the Port District and the city can come 
up with a compromise to help compensate the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
This will take flexibility by all the parties. But the result could be a 
waterfront that the Navy and the city will be proud to call home.
