<LEADPARA>  IT WAS the strangest encounter since Mao met Nixon: The Simpsons were guests
at last fall's grand opening of Blackhawk Plaza Shopping Center, ritziest
haunt of the East Bay rich.;    By every account, a good time was had by all.
The mind reels. What are the subterranean cultural threads that link the
overachievers of Blackhawk to that proletarian underachiever, Bart Simpson?  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     But it's symptomatic of what's happening in suburbia today. A new logic has
taken over. The old rules about what unites people into a community are no
help.;    I still haven't deciphered why Blackhawk should fawn over actors in
Simpson suits, but the Blackhawk shopping center testifies to the new logic
shaping suburbia today. Suburbia is growing a new type of town center, and if
the results are a little surreal, so be it.;    Cool surreality is what
Blackhawk Plaza is all about. Here we can see mated Oz and Andalusia,
corporate treasure houses and Spanish villages, Sierra streams and fountains
to make a Renaissance cardinal weep.;    The plaza is the main shopping area
for Blackhawk, the top-scale housing tract developed near Danville by Kenneth
Behring. It includes a market, multiplex theater, restaurants and upscale
stores.;    Mall wisdom dictates a large anchor store -- a Macy's, Emporium,
Nordstrom -- to make it succeed, but Blackhawk Plaza defies conventional
logic. Instead of a store, it has a museum at its heart. The lordly Behring
Automobile Museum housing Behring's collection of classic cars sits on a knoll
at one end of the shopping center. It is the manor house that focuses the
architecture and activities of the center.;    In front of it spreads the
sizable plaza that is the ceremonial heart of this quasi-village.;    But
while the museum is modern-day corporate Oz architecture, the shopping center
below is laid out like a humble -- if trendy -- Mediterranean village. The
shimmering museum features sharp, crystalline granite and glass towers, while
the village is soft, rambling and stucco. Tile roofs pile up on tiled roof.
The mixture of styles and images is jarring at first glance. But it
establishes a clear urban hierarchy. The one-style-fits-all mall is dead.;   
Adding variety;  Doug Dahlin, Blackhawk Plaza's architect, has begun to add
variety to suburbia. Water is the design's unifying element. It begins at the
formal terrace in front of the museum as a lavish 1940s aquacade of late
moderne pylons and jetting water interlaced with classical stairs, balconies
and fountains borrowed from an Italian Renaissance pleasure garden.;    Water
soars and burbles every which way before settling into a pool; from there it
becomes a bubbling brook, meandering through naturalistic boulders and small
waterfalls along an irregular bank planted with grass and flowers.
Cottage-like shops cozy up to the stream in fairy-tale fashion.;   
Technically it is quite an achievement. It isn't easy to make artificial water
look like anything but a bathtub lined in concrete.;    Despite this aquatic
tour de force, the plaza is still a bit disorganized. The orchestration of its
many themes is weak.;    The village itself is loosely divided between
cottage-like pavilions and lofty shaded gallerias, half Valhalla and half
mortuary. A grand axis connects the multiplex palazzo perched out on the edge
of the parking lot with the water feature at the center of the mall.;    Lack
of cohesion;  All these pieces add richness, but lack cohesion. Despite some
fancy materials, the center's exterior looks much like the average existing
suburban shopping -- a large warehouse set in the middle of a parking lot.
There is no hint of the water wonderland inside. Too bad. An unexpected
eruption of water (in non-drought years) would have been surprising and
delightful to see alongside the parched parking lots of summertime Contra
Costa County.;    Blackhawk Plaza needed an update of Willis Polk's Sunol
Water Temple.;    Despite some confusion, Blackhawk Plaza begins to explore
new ways to design suburbia. The combination of culture and shopping begins to
make Blackhawk Plaza a true multi-dimensional town center. The Behring
Automobile Museum will be joined June 2 by a new University of California
museum for art, science and ethnography. A third museum is being planned. They
bring activities to the suburbs that were previously known only in city
centers.;    Storytelling strength;  Another strength of the design is in
telling a story in architecture. Blackhawk Plaza borrows the rich contrast of
images and the cinematic vistas of that influential urban model, Disneyland.; 
  Blackhawk Plaza could also draw inspiration from the picturesque tradition
of the great 18th century English landscape gardens. Also rambling and loosely
organized, they were also clear statements about history, memory and
literature. They wove symbols and culture together to make pleasure gardens
for the aristocracy. Blackhawk must do the same.;    As a pet project of a
successful developer, Blackhawk can afford to experiment. Behring is no urban
theorist. He is a developer with a confident (if not infallible) sense of what
sells -- what people want. He has envisioned a new step in the evolution of
suburbia. He has the resources to build it. It may fail, but if it succeeds it
will add a new dimension to suburbia.;    Blackhawk Plaza has flaws. Far from
BART and light rail, it is utterly dependent on the car. It assumes that the
car will always be with us, at least for the rich. But the time may come when
even wealthy commuters to San Francisco, Concord and Livermore won't put up
with the inconvenience of traffic jams. While most city planners and urban
theorists wish suburbia would develop more rationally, Blackhawk Plaza is how
it really happens. (box)  </TEXT>
