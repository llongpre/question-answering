Channel Four's new building in London

Television is everywhere and it is sometimes difficult to imagine it coming
from any specific place. In these days of virtual reality, it comes as a
surprise to realise that TV channels need concrete headquarters and solid
bases for their activities.
Opened earlier this month, the new Channel Four building in Westminster
follows hot on the heels of the new ITN building in London, designed by Sir
Norman Foster. Britons see ITN in all its transparent glory every night on
'News at Ten' - the image of efficiency and focused energy gives a certain
boost of confidence to the broadcasting of the news itself.
When TV-am began its short life in a converted canal-side warehouse in
Camden Town, it chose as its architect the jocular Terry Farrell who could
not resist a sunrise-shaped entrance and a row of breakfast egg cups along
the parapet.
Those jokey days are over and Channel Four took the appointment of its
architect, Sir Richard Rogers, very seriously. Channel Four held a private
competition and appointed a design committee to oversee the process and
select the winner.
The composition of any jury is usually what determines the result and when
you have Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, Michael Manser, a
former president of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Michael Grade
and Sir Richard Attenborough on the jury you can expect a fellow member of
the modernist establishment, of a certain age, will be appointed. At the
time of the competition (1991) I recall the much more adventurous scheme, by
Bennetts Associates, which reached the shortlist but did not win.
The winning design by Sir Richard Rogers shows how middle age has tempered
the extremism of his early years when the Pompidou Centre, which he designed
with Renzo Piano, was the first building to expose all its pipes and ducts
on the outside of the facade.
This was seen as some kind of a breakthrough and announced the birth of the
style known as high-tech. As is often the case with the promotion of
architectural styles - a great deal depends on the personal charm of the
architect. Richard Rogers has always been a fervent evangelist and has used
his personal charm to sell his particular brand of mechanistic modernism. It
is interesting to see how he is modifying his line, and in all his public
utterances about community architecture he begins to sound close to some of
the views of HRH The Prince of Wales.
Channel Four's new headquarters occupies two and a half acres on Horseferry
Road in Westminster, just behind the concrete horror of the Department of
the Environment's headquarters in Marsham Street.
The site had been ear marked 20 years ago for a 20 storey post office
building and work had already started on the construction of a ten metre
deep basement. This below-ground work was utilised by the architects to
provide a home for 'no-daylight functions' such as the main studio and the
preview cinema. As part of the planning deal, negotiated by Westminster City
Council, half an acre of the site is a public park and children's
playground.
The plan of the building is a large 'L' shape, with the knuckle of the
building, at the joint of the 'L', being occupied by the curved entrance
area, boardroom, and restaurants. It is this curved element that is the most
spectacular part of the building and is really the only part of the design
that seems to bear Richard Rogers's signature. The curved curtain wall,
supported on a spider's web of steel, is something that all architects have
tried to do since Norman Foster's Willis Faber Dumas office building in
Ipswich curved so sinuously on its site.
It is the component manufacturer who must take much of the credit for the
success of something as striking as Channel Four's curved glass wall. It was
made by Eiffel in France (who made the famous glass pyramid in the Louvre).
Permasteelisa, an Italian cladding manufacturer under the direction of
Massimo Colomban, made the curtain walling on the office blocks which have a
rugged toughness about them. Massimo Colomban is one of those brilliant
Italian designer/businessmen who is currently founding a school to train
architects in the 'perfecting of component engineering'.
Channel Four has really gained a fragment of a Rogers building - the
excitingly curved entrance area and the lift tower and stack of meeting
zooms - the rest of two blocks is routine offices. Indeed, one of the blocks
will be let. Channel Four has spent Pounds 62m on the site and the building.
Construction costs are some Pounds 39m which, allowing for the special needs
of a TVbuilding, is not far from the average for a good quality office block
in central London.
Channel Four has provided London with a modest but striking example of late
modernism - a kind of calmed, high-tech building. The particularly good
thing is that it has stayed in the centre of the city, not gone wandering
off to Docklands and has provided some housing for sale and a park on the
site.
In image terms the new headquarters is much more workmanlike than Lord
Reith's grand Broadcasting House. By concentrating all the architectural
excitement at the entrance, Channel Four's new HQ is rather like TV itself -
it promises a lot of sparkle but, once you pass the entrance the building,
is pretty routine.
