FT  19 APR 91 / The Property Market: Stanhope has designs on business in the
west

Stanhope is widely considered to be one of the most talented property
development groups in Europe. Nevertheless, like most overstretched players
in the overbuilt London market, it is facing a period of consolidation.
Last week it sharply wrote down the value of some sites - the bedraggled
South Bank Centre, a section of London Wall in the City, a part of Brunswick
Wharf to the north-east of the Isle of Dogs and some office blocks in Euston
Square - after postponing their development for the next three years.
Likewise, the 134-acre King's Cross site, potentially the most promising in
London, is unlikely to be started for several years, although Stanhope and
its partners are continuing to negotiate planning permission.
But Stanhope's wings have not been clipped entirely. After winning planning
permission at the start of the year, it is now converting an old bus
maintenance depot at Chiswick into an architecturally distinguished office
park set in 33 acres of parkland.
This suburban (or as the developer prefers, 'mid-urban') park will feature
the work of six leading UK architects - Eric Parry Associates, Richard
Rogers Partnership, Peter Foggo Associates, ABK, Terry Farrell and Co, and
Foster Associates. Among the buildings architects in this group have to
their credit are those for Lloyd's of London and the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai
Bank and the exuberant TV-am headquarters.
Asking a clutch of high-flying architects to produce harmonising designs
within a tight budget for an office campus is unusual - and laudably
ambitious. But the architects, headed by the master-planner Terry Farrell
and Hanna/Olin, the US landscape architect, appear to have come up with the
goods.
'The master plan and the details of the landscaping . . . suggests a scheme
of unusual interest and quality that will set the standard for developments
of this sort,' said the Department of the Environment's report.
Stanhope, which is building the business campus with Trafalgar House, says
the scheme is innovative in other ways. It is a cross between a conventional
business park, in landscaping, car parking and amenities, and an urban
office complex in its location and accessibility.
The developers (perhaps optimistically) reckon it takes just 31 minutes to
get to Cannon Street and 20 minutes to reach Heathrow. The park is a few
minutes' walk from three Underground stations and two British Rail stations,
which will eventually be connected by an interchange.
According to Stanhope, 3m people are within a 15-minute journey of the
projected site. 'The whole idea is: Why drag people into the town centre?
Why not provide jobs where they want to live?' says Mr Fergus Low, the
development director.
In addition, the park will have a sports club, a brasserie and childcare
facilities. Stanhope says the scheme, which will be ready in 1992, has
sparked an encouraging amount of interest from the media and from
pharmaceutical companies.
If so, there seems to be a good chance that it will be a financial success.
Kleinwort Benson Securities estimates that the project's break-even costs
are Pounds 27 per sq ft, while it aims to charge rents of between Pounds 30
and Pounds 35 per sq ft. Stanhope, which already has a Pounds 100m facility,
says it is confident that it can raise another Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m for
the project.
Elsewhere Stanhope's finances may be under strain. There are doubts about
the profitability of its Ludgate scheme in Holborn (in spite of the
record-breaking size of the letting agreed by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte)
and there is concern about the value of Broadgate, the office development in
the City.
Broadgate held its value well in the initial phase of the property slump,
but is likely to see a drop in value this year. Because Rosehaugh Stanhope
Developments (the joint venture responsible for Ludgate and Broadgate) is
highly geared, this could wipe out a significant part of the company's asset
value. At the same time, there has been a realisation that the reduction of
RSD's large income deficit may be a long haul because of high (although
shrinking) interest costs and the worsening prospects for rental growth.
The conclusion - that RSD needs to sell part of Broadgate - is hardly new.
The decision to sell was taken last summer, although it was delayed by
disagreements between Rosehaugh and Stanhope. But the asking price was
ambitious (not least because of the extravagant sums that had been paid for
other prestigious buildings such as Lansdowne House) and the crisis in the
Gulf deterred potential buyers. A sale that was tentatively agreed with the
Prudential Insurance Company of America's Global Fund fell through when the
Gulf war broke out.
As investors start to return to the UK market, a sale should not be too far
away. The price is likely to be very different from that hoped for last
summer.
