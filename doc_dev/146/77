THINK OF a town near a capital city which has relics of Neolithic and Iron
Age cave settlements, an Archbishop's Palace with a great hall dating from
the 14th century, and as fine a set of Victorian churches as you will find
anywhere. This little town grew quietly, but its neighbouring capital city
spread and spread until the town was engulfed by the city and umbilically
linked by an iron road to that city's centre.
The iron road went in both directions so that people could flood into the
capital but they could also flood into what had been the little town. Soon
it was hard to tell the difference between the two places the little town
began to look more and more like the capital city with towers of commerce
and routes of concrete.
Poor Croydon, for that was the name of the little old town, lost almost all
traces of its past and settled for the strange role of office limbo,
occupied from nine to five by visiting worker bees. All this happened in the
1960s when East Croydon Station turned into a giant magnet and drew towards
it offices and towers and concrete roads and car parks like strings of giant
iron filings. By any standards the addition of over five million square feet
of offices to any town is a shock, but Croydon coped because, unlike the
doomed Canary Wharf, it had proper and efficient transport links with the
capital and was, whatever you may think of it, a place.
The trouble was that when this little old town decided to grow, it chose the
wrong fairy godmothers in the shape of architects. There is not one new
building of the 1960s of any serious architectural merit in Croydon. All the
old commercial favourites are there. R. Seifert and Partners built their
strange 23-storey octagon. Biscoe and Stanton tried to make concrete look
like folded paper in their building for General Accident - strangely well
named . . . Some 11 acres of Croydon were covered in five years from 1965 by
the dreadful Whitgift Centre designed by the architects Fitzroy Robinson and
Partners. Today it all looks desperately sad and should be demolished.
Instead of grasping the nettle of demolition, the city fathers of Croydon
have decided to go for some fashionable architectural cosmetics. The fact is
that Croydon is worried. It is landed, as are many commercial centres, with
out of date concrete office blocks which daily function less and less well
and embody a kind of an office culture that is increasingly out of date. But
it is highly questionable whether a place like Croydon needs the sort of
random fantasies that have been proposed by the Arts Council backed
Architecture Foundation in the exhibition tent that will stand outside
Croydon's Fairfield Halls for the next three months.
There are some 15 proposals from 15 architectural firms in the exhibition,
Croydon the Future. The centrepiece is a scale model of Croydon which can be
enjoyed with the help of interactive touch screen computer technology. But
the a real problem is that Croydon is not Paris, and this series of Grands
Projets can only ever be the icing on a very dull cake. Indeed some of the
architects, daunted by the terrible reality of the centre of Croydon, have
literally put some icing on the existing buildings.
The entertaining firm of Birds Portchmouth and Russum use the tops of
Croydon's multi-storey car parks as the bases for new inflatable structures
to house 'civic and cultural events.' Its a strangely 1960s idea, but one
that is practical enough to happen. Richard Rogers offers Croydon a skeletal
tower that provides the residents a permanent low energy light show. Future
Systems have designed an elegant bridge that leaps over some of the
dreariest parts of the town centre. The best scheme is one by Richard
Horden, which wraps up a four lane highway, and puts a sheltered pedestrian
zone in the centre large enough to house arts and eating activities.
How wise are the councillors of Croydon to hitch their wagon once again to
an architectural star. They got it commercially right but architecturally
wrong in the 1960s; will the emphasis on design rather than function this
time do the trick to make Croydon an agreeable place? I suspect that the
answer is no. Good makeup cannot hide bad bone structure.
What no one has proposed is that the centre of any city needs people to live
there. When will developers realise that what England badly needs is good
private housing, at least as good as the average Manhattan apartment. Tower
homes in city centres can be fine if they are well designed, well serviced
and supported by sports and leisure facilities. The architectural profession
should take the lead because more and more people are going to live and work
at home.
How exciting it could be if somewhere like Croydon had taken a serious look
at the way we are going to live in cities in the future instead of tacking
on to a decrepit and defunct vision of the 1960s the stylish and often
hopeless nostrums of the 1990s. Poor old Croydon, there is not much hope
here . . .
