One of downtown San Diego's largest property owners, the Santa Fe Pacific 
Realty Corp., unveiled plans Friday to build its first residential project in 
the center city, a striking, 387-unit apartment complex spread over 2 blocks 
across from the 13-story Embassy Suites hotel. 
</P>
<P>
If approved by Centre City Development Corp., the agency in charge of downtown 
redevelopment, the $25-million project, called Seabridge, would be about 1,000 
feet from the bay, the closest such residential development to the water 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
The Spanish Revival architecture of the building, similar to the former police 
station nearby, won praise from several CCDC board members, but the board 
refused to endorse the project outright because of concerns about the 
structure's 500-car parking garage and the lack of street-level activity around 
the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
But an upbeat Pam Hamilton, CCDC's executive director, said afterward that she 
expected the problems to be easy to resolve and that she will return the 
project to the board in two weeks, on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
Among Seabridge's most palatable aspects to redevelopment officials are that it 
would be the first rental residential project in the agency's domain to be 
built without public subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
As now designed, Seabridge would cover about 2 acres bounded by G and F 
streets, Pacific Coast Highway and the railroad tracks. It actually consists of 
two buildings separated in the middle by California Street. But the street 
would be closed to motor traffic and left as a minimum 40-foot-wide pedestrian 
walkway, allowing people to stroll through the project. 
</P>
<P>
The two buildings would be joined near the roof by a pedestrian bridge, a byway 
allowing tenants to reach facilities such as a rooftop swimming pool. Sizes of 
the mostly one-bedroom apartments would range from 515 square feet to 875 
square feet and rent in the neighborhood of $630 a month, a modest enough rate 
to attract young singles working downtown, according to the developer. 
</P>
<P>
Parking would be provided on two levels, with the bottom partly underground. 
Rising on top of the garage would be four floors of apartments reaching about 
60 feet in height. Seabridge's most striking design feature would be two 
84-foot-tall towers flanking the G Street entrance to California Street. 
</P>
<P>
Although both CCDC board members and the agency's staff like Seabridge's 
overall design, it will require exemptions from design guidelines in place for 
the Marina Redevelopment Area. And that is where the project stumbled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
There are two main concerns. One is that some board members think that more of 
the parking garage should be placed underground, thus reducing the height of 
the street wall and placing first-floor tenants closer to the street than the 
current 14 feet. Second, Seabridge has fewer entrances on its perimeter and no 
street-level retail space as required by the Marina design standards. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe and its development partner, JMB Realty Corp., maintain that it will 
cost at least $1 million to lower the garage in the ground, in part because of 
added construction costs but also because a deeper excavation will expose the 
underground water table. 
</P>
<P>
The problem then would be possible toxic pollution, according to Alan I. 
Jaffee, JMB's senior vice president. He said there are gasoline and possibly 
other contaminants underground. CCDC is familiar with underground pollution due 
to a perplexing hydrocarbon plume of several hundred thousand gallons lying 
under several blocks the agency is trying to develop. 
</P>
<P>
Jaffee said he is not only concerned about cleanup costs but also with the 
delay that would be involved. He said his company experienced a significant 
delay because of underground pollution at a Huntington Beach project and would 
avoid a repeat at almost all costs. 
</P>
<P>
It is for that reason, he said, that the garage occupies the entire first level 
of the project, though it will be screened from view. 
</P>
<P>
But some board members, such as Patrick Kruer, say they must be persuaded that 
lowering the garage is so expensive as to make the project economically 
unfeasible. Kruer said it would be hypocritical of CCDC to criticize others -- 
such as the Port District and Seaport Village -- for not building underground 
garages, and then not follow its own advice. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the issue is one of sending the wrong message," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to the lack of enough entrances into the project from its perimeter 
-- there are 10 instead of the required 14 -- and its absence of retail space. 
Jaffee and his architect said they have tried to design the complex so that it 
isn't a continuous blank wall. Providing more entrances would require removing 
several apartments and redesigning the parking garage. Having the garage at 
street level is what removes any retail space. 
</P>
<P>
CCDC's staff says Santa Fe can meet the retail space requirement by adding 
ground-floor shops at the Embassy Suites across the street. CCDC chairman John 
Davies, who called the proposed exemptions minor, said it is "ridiculous" to 
require retail space when there is no demand and in the face of much vacant 
retail space in new downtown buildings. Davis also said that Seabridge is 
smaller than what Santa Fe could legally build on the site.
