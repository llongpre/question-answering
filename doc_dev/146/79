The city Board of Directors has ordered the preparation of an ordinance to 
require builders to make a central garden the focus of all new apartment and 
condominium projects, with parking well-concealed from passers-by. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance is based on a planning document called "A City of Gardens" that 
was developed by a team of consultants under guidance from a community task 
force. 
</P>
<P>
City directors embraced the new approach this week even though some builders 
and architects complained that the standards are impractical, will increase 
housing costs and will not produce more attractive housing. Architect Jack 
Corey said he "loves the idea of gardens," but the proposed design standards 
are full of technical flaws and so unworkable that builders will frequently 
file appeals to deviate from the requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Director Rick Cole conceded that the standards are imperfect, but said they can 
be corrected through experience. The city needs a new approach, he said, 
because the current code has produced projects that are "absolutely 
unacceptable to any kind of quality of life for the people who live in them or 
have to live next to them." 
</P>
<P>
And, he said, if the city allows builders to continue constructing such 
projects, residents will demand a halt to all construction, and the result will 
be a "mindless no-growth policy." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Comment 
</P>
<P>
Directors instructed the city attorney's office to prepare an ordinance based 
on the new standards and to circulate it for public comment for four weeks 
before adoption. In the meantime, projects that have already been submitted to 
the city will be allowed to go forward under the old standards. 
</P>
<P>
The new approach is designed to break a pattern of long, narrow multifamily 
units built in rows, with asphalt dominating the open space. The city report 
outlining the City of Gardens standards says such buildings violate the 
integrity of neighborhoods and detract from the city's historic character. 
</P>
<P>
The report says that, "The most noticeable and important quality of Pasadena 
neighborhoods is their overall garden character," with courtyards, lawns and 
flowers. 
</P>
<P>
It also says that "Pasadena's residential streets are relatively free from 
dominance by the automobile. Pasadena has a slow and graceful character created 
by trees and buildings. . . . The traditional Pasadena quality depends very 
much on the fact that parking is invisible," placed behind buildings. It says 
that "driveways that are beautiful in Pasadena are like mysterious paths, 
leading through trees or shrubs, to some place in the back. Projects where a 
wide asphalt aisle with parked cars entirely dominates half of a 50-foot lot 
completely lose this character." 
</P>
<P>
The proposed standards would require that all multifamily projects have a 
garden or landscaped court as their focus. The main garden would take up 17% to 
20% of a lot. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tile Fountains 
</P>
<P>
Projects would be required to have roofed balconies, tile fountains or other 
attractive features. 
</P>
<P>
The city's planning consultants and Planning Commission had recommended that 
all parking be confined to the rear 40% of a lot. But directors enlarged the 
area where parking might be permitted to the rear 60% of a lot, after Director 
Kathryn Nack said she feared that placing parking far apart from some of the 
residences would be inconvenient and pose security problems. 
</P>
<P>
To offset the increased open space requirements, the new standards would allow 
buildings in some cases to be constructed at the side and rear property lines 
without a setback. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Gardens standards would apply in all the city's multifamily zones 
that allow 16 to 48 units per acre. It would not apply to downtown districts 
that allow more units per acre, nor to projects that involve mixed uses, such 
as retail stores on the ground floor and apartments above.
