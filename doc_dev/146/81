The august members of the Orange County chapter of the American Institute of 
Architects are out to boost their image. And if it takes crawling around in the 
sand to do it, well, all the better. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Sept. 30, local architects, landscape architects and affiliated 
professionals will scoop, shape and otherwise manipulate the sands of Corona 
del Mar State Beach in the second annual AIA/Orange County Invitational 
Sandcastle Competition. Spectators can watch the pros at work from 10 a.m. to 3 
p.m., then cast their ballots for their favorite entry. An awards ceremony will 
follow at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five teams are scheduled to compete, according to event spokeswoman 
Loralyn Reif, who called the contest "the last, and hopefully the best, of the 
three major sandcastle competitions" in the county. (The United Way and Newport 
Seafest sponsored large contests earlier this month.) 
</P>
<P>
"These are professionals in design creating absolutely spectacular sand 
sculptures and castles," Reif said. "The end results are amazing; it almost 
becomes a mini-Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
"One of the main goals of the chapter is to increase architectural awareness in 
Orange County, and we feel this event is a fun way to do just that," she 
continued, adding that more than 2,000 spectators attended last year's event. 
</P>
<P>
Competitors will be working in two major categories, sand sculptures and 
sandcastles, said Reif, who expects this year's entries to be evenly split 
between the two. 
</P>
<P>
"Sand sculptures tend to be more free form," she explained, "ranging anywhere 
from an alligator to a palm tree. For example, last year's grand prize winner, 
Joseph Woollett &amp; Associates, interpreted classical Greek ruins. Another 
team created this big foot about to step on a figure of a man, and called it 
'Under Pressure.' " A sandcastle takes a more traditional form and is generally 
outfitted with moats, turrets and drawbridges, she said. 
</P>
<P>
A panel of judges, including Tony DeLap, a sculptor and UCI instructor; Cathy 
Curtis, a Times staff writer who covers art for the Orange County edition, and 
David Smith of Newport's World Famous Architects, will award three prizes in 
each division, as well as an overall Grand Prize. Judges will focus on 
originality of design, best use of site, degree of difficulty and detail, and 
execution. Onlookers can cast their ballots for a special People's Choice 
award. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions won't be easy. When they're not shaping office towers and elegant 
homes, many of these professionals work as master sand sculptors, competing in 
sandcastle contests around the globe, including the prestigious U.S. Open 
Sandcastle Competition, held for the past 12 years at Imperial Beach in San 
Diego. Typical of these are the husband-and-wife team of Gregory and Leslie 
Lebon, who recently created a 35-foot-high "city of the future," complete with 
eight-foot bridges and a walk-through viewer's path, for the Sand Craft 
Festival in Kamaishi, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
"To the architects, it's a matter of pride" in their craft, said Reiff. "But 
sand sculpting is one of those things that can start out as a hobby, and before 
you know it, you're addicted to it."
