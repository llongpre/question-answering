<LEADPARA>  SINCE ITS invention in the 1920s, miniature golf annually has been dismissed
as a fad about to join the Hula-Hoop in trivia heaven. But reports of its
demise are greatly exaggerated.;    At Santa Cruz Boardwalk's newly opened
Neptune's Kingdom, miniature golf enters the vanguard of urban technology.
Peewee golf has been reincarnated as an indoor theme golf park that adds a new
dimension to urban design.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     The delightful new Neptune's Kingdom proves the spreading influence of
Disneyland on urban design today. Traditional forms of amusement, shopping and
habitation are getting the theme park gloss: high-tech wizardry, a unifying
story line and an organization closer to cinematography than conventional
architectural composition.;    The original 1907 Plunge's heated saltwater
pool had been converted to an indoor miniature golf course in 1963, but only
after the Loma Prieta earthquake shook part of the building's facade loose did
plans proceed to update the course. William S. Bagnall Architects designed the
remodeling with Anaheim's R&amp;R Creative Amusement Designs Inc. as theme
consultants.;    The usual windmills and castles have been replaced with an
entire fantasy landscape. Putting from hole to hole, players follow a story
unfolding in three dimensions. It mixes Jules Verne sci-fi and Robert Louis
Stevenson piratry with nautical touches suitable to the Boardwalk's seaside
site. A layer of theme-park robotics underscores the fact that a new type of
amusement environment has been created.;    The best parts of the original
natatorium's architecture -- the metal-truss arches spanning 65 feet -- have
been superbly integrated into the new scheme. Starting low and leaping high,
they create a 130-foot long vault that constitutes one of the grandest public
spaces within the 408 area code.;    Outside, the old natatorium's cheerfully
tacky original architecture has been well restored.;    Inside, the tees and
putting greens themselves are the standard chutes and tubes with balls
dropping into holes and appearing someplace else. No high-tech update here to
help duffers. But at different holes audio-animatronic pirates berate the
players. Cannons explode if the player makes a hole-in-one at the 18th hole.
Between, players wander along a wharfside, through a cave, board a pirate ship
and investigate its captain's cabin.;    The course's new seaside village
might be corny enough to be dismissed as a stage set if it weren't for the
careful placement and design of its pieces. It is meant to be moved through,
not just looked at. That creates spaces, and that makes it architecture.;    A
three-story lighthouse doubling as an elevator makes a strong landmark to
orient you within the intentionally disorienting fantasy of the golf course. A
mural (including fiber-optic volcano) on the vault's end wall and a waterfall
creates a convincing background and middle ground for the realistic fishing
village's foreground.;    This is a new way of connecting spaces. Each is
distinct, yet combined into an impressionistic whole that owes more to the
movies than the Euclidian geometry of traditional architecture.;    Theme
parks and urban entertainment centers like this invent histories that never
were to create vivid places for people to gather socially -- an element lost
in many cities in recent years. The vapidness of malls is being challenged by
this competition, and they're scrambling to keep up.;    It's the wonder of
these places that they can mix history, myth and fairy tale so easily. The old
natatorium's domes and desert colors are Moorish, but Ancient Rome's Neptune
presides over the entryway -- an entry that features a diving bell in the
Victorian style of Captain Nemo. Inside lies a cozy New England fishing
village.;    At Neptune's Kingdom these myths don't gel into a convincing
whole. Theming still needs to mature if it is to become a sophisticated urban
design tool. Neptune Kingdom's salty touches are more Nantucket than Santa
Cruz, and the pirates more Captain Hook than Sir Francis Drake.;    Theming
doesn't always require authenticity, as Disney's Florida Epcot Center proves.
Its truly fantastic aberrations of reality, time and history are enthralling:
There Disney designers decided that the pieces of the most perfectly designed
urban space on earth, Venice's Piazza San Marco, needed to be rearranged for
their tribute to Italy. That takes a visionary ability to ignore reality in
order to create an entirely new, unified world. It transcends parody.;   
Neptune's Kingdom lacks its granddaddy's audacity, but the unexpected vitality
of this latest version of miniature golf shows that it can't be mistaken for a
fad anymore. It is a continuing architectural tradition -- one unrecorded in
most history books but a tradition nonetheless. (box)  </TEXT>
