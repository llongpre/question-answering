The facts about the new Chelsea and Westminster Hospital are pretty
extraordinary. It is the only brand new urban teaching hospital in Britain.
It is described as the largest and most ambitious hospital development in
the UK. It has 70 different departments, 665 beds, eight operating theatres
and 260 bedrooms for nursing staff. It was planned and built in five years -
a record for the NHS. The building cost Pounds 117m to construct. It opens
in London as the government announces plans to close several London
hospitals because there are too many hospital beds in the capital . . .
The new hospital is situated on the site of the old St Stephen's Hospital in
the Fulham Road. The old hospital had grown from the infirmary of the former
St George's Union Workhouse and no tears were shed when it was decided to
demolish it. But tears were shed by some over the decision to close four
hospitals - Westminster Hospital, Westminster Children's Hospital, the West
London Hospital and St Mary Abbots Hospital and to bring all the services
they offered to the new site at the congested end of the Fulham Road,
surrounded mainly by streets of modest houses. This was very much an estate
management manoeuvre of the 1980s which depended for its success on the
willingness of property developers to buy the old hospital sites to fund the
new building.
Architects for the new development were chosen by the Riverside Health
Authority through a form of limited competition, which was won by the firm
Sheppard Robson (the partner in charge of the scheme was Sinclair Webster).
In many ways the new hospital represents the new style NHS. I was fascinated
to learn that the architects were chosen not so much because they had
designed lots of hospitals (they hadn't) - but because they had plenty of
commercial experience and were ready to design for a 'fast track approach'.
Sheppard Robson has a record of competence in the design of research
laboratories, universities, shopping centres, offices and housing. At Triton
Court, Finsbury Square, it designed the most agreeable and successful large
atrium in the City; its work at Royal Mint Court is perhaps less successful.
As a well established British firm that has successfully operated in both
the public and the private sectors, it was particularly well placed to plan
the first of a new generation of hospitals.
The brief called for a very large building on a site that is surrounded by
small-scale houses and shops and suffers from a planners' height
restriction. The unusual decision was made to incorporate shops (as yet
unlet) on the Fulham Road entrance front, and to design the whole hospital
around a huge glazed atrium which is like an indoor street. It is naturally
lit and ventilated, using the power of the sun and the heat loss from the
surrounding building. The atrium is the most remarkable element of the
design and is something of a tour de force as a unifying element in the
whole hospital.
You enter the hospital beneath a faintly absurd Teflon canopy on the Fulham
Road and proceed through the slowly revolving doors, as though you were
going into a supermarket. Wheelchairs and zimmer frames can be accommodated
by the moving doors. The main reception desk commands the entrance to the
atrium and is manned by friendly attendants. (It seemed to me that the
success of the whole hospital depends on the patience of the staff on the
main desk. Because of the size of the hospital they are going to be asked
for directions 24 hours a day.)
The huge white atrium, with lifts and escalators, defines the centre of the
building, but the actual circulation, and finding your way, still depends
largely on signs and graphics. These are definitely inadequate and, much as
the architects may deplore the spread of the handwritten notices, they will
soon be everywhere. I was amazed how difficult it was to read the signs and
felt initially as confused as I do in an airport. Because the architecture
is so uniform and the overall colours so bland, there are few markers to
guide the visitor or the patient. Also, people are so preoccupied in
hospitals that they get lost much more often than they do in other
buildings, and so need more help from the architecture rather than less.
But in the atrium you do not feel as though you are in a hospital at all. It
is an enjoyable place to be and the idea of inserting separate small
buildings into the space - such as the chapel and the dispensary  - adds a
little human scale. There is also a great deal of art around the place, some
good and some terrible. On the whole the paintings are better than the
sculpture, especially the waterfall series by Mel Chantry. Giant trees help
to furnish the atrium but at the same time contribute to the sense of
unreality; they have to be lit by special lights and will need a lot of
care.
When you reach the waiting areas for the out-patients they come as something
of an anticlimax after the brilliant height of the atrium. These low spaces,
filled with ghastly NHS furniture that must have been a job lot from the
1950s, often have no views of the atrium and not much light. The wards are
fairly standard, with groups of six or eight beds separated from the staff
areas by low walls. The ward floors work well with a sense of semi open-plan
allowing a fair degree of privacy. Again the furniture is disappointing -
Parker Knoll of the '50s reigns supreme.
I am sure that patients well enough to totter about will make for the atrium
all the time because it brings a light and elegant dimension to the whole
hospital. Its lighting is stylish and there is constant activity, and the
whole idea of making one big space for all the vertical and horizontal
circulation is a brave one. The size of the hospital was not the architects'
decision; it could be overwhelming, especially to the elderly finding their
way about unescorted.
From the outside the design of the main building is orderly and controlled
and fits a great deal on to a small site as unobtrusively as anyone could
expect. I would not want the great chimney at the bottom of my expensive
Chelsea garden, but I do feel that the architects have done their very best
to be good, if large, neighbours.
Is this the first of a series, or the last of a line of NHS hospitals? I
would have thought that patients prefer smaller hospitals, less enclosed
worlds for medicine, and less evidence of the scale of the vast NHS
bureaucracy.
There is one completely marvellous thing in the new hospital. Not so long
ago a wise chaplain of the Westminster Hospital acquired a magnificent
painting of the resurrection by Paolo Veronese (1528-1588), which has now
been moved with its glorious gilt frame to the chapel at the heart of the
new hospital. It is of such superb quality that, in every way, it outscales
its surroundings.
