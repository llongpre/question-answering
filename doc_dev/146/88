</HEADLINE>

<P>
Construction has started on the first phase of the $300-million J. Paul Getty 
Center northwest of the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and the San Diego 
(405) Freeway in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by the architectural firm of Richard Meier &amp; Partners, the art 
complex will occupy a 24-acre hilltop within a 110-acre site in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. Dinwiddie Construction Co., Los Angeles, has been appointed 
general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project, scheduled for completion in 1991, includes a 
six-level, 1,200-acre underground parking structure at the public entrance to 
the center at Sepulveda Boulevard and Getty Center Drive, according to Stephen 
D. Rountree, director of the Getty Trust Building Program. The entire project 
is targeted for a 1995 completion, he said. 
</P>

The Getty Center is being designed as a campus-like complex that will unite the 
J. Paul Getty Trust's Los Angeles-based programs and provide specialized 
facilities for their activities. 
</P>
<P>
Main structures will include a second facility for the J. Paul Getty Museum, 
with about 60,000 square feet of gallery space; the Getty Center for the 
History of Art and the Humanities; and facilities for the Getty Conservation 
Institute, the Getty Center for Education in the Arts, and the Getty Trust 
administrative offices. There will also be a 450-seat auditorium.

Others on the construction team include Robert Englekirk Consulting Structural 
Engineers Inc., Los Angeles; John L. Altieri Consulting Engineers, Norwalk, 
Conn.; B&amp;E Engineers of Los Angeles, and Woodward-Clyde Consultants of 
Santa Ana. Emmet L. Wemple &amp; Associates is the landscape architect.
