<LEADPARA>  After nine months of renovation and at a cost of more than $500,000, the
playground north of the swim lagoon at Fremont's Central Park is open and the
word is out.;    "This part of the park was never as crowded," said Robert
Pineda, who was with his 9-month-old daughter and a friend's child. "I think
they anticipated that kids didn't like what was here before. They brought it
up to date."  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     One more suggestion;  Still, Denise Boland, mother of a 5-year-old, had a
suggestion for how some of the money should have been spent.;    "It would
have been nice if they'd thought about water fountains," she said. "I guess we
should be glad they remembered the trees.";    Opened on June 28, the area
features swings, sand, modern jungle bars, tubular slides and tick-tack-toe
games. Dozens of parents and children were using the area Friday afternoon.;  
 The play equipment, sand and hard surface for handicapped access cost about
$160,000, said Lincoln Fong, senior landscape architect for the city. The
surrounding grass and curb work and nearby picnic tables cost about $385,000,
said Myles Herman, a city construction inspection coordinator.;    In time for
holiday;  There are three more months of maintenance to be completed on the
turf, but the playground was opened early so that families could use it by the
July 4 weekend, Herman said.;    Although Mark Oger thought the playground was
geared to younger children, such as his 2-year-old son who was able to
maneuver easily through interconnecting ramps, even older children appreciated
it.;    "It's better than the way it used to be," said Jason Williams, 14. He
liked the new equipment, which offered more climbing challenges.;    There's
even a pit with bars for exercising. "It's funner than doing things in the
gym," said Jennifer Brown, 9, who likes the outdoors.  </TEXT>
