We are almost there. Tomorrow's FT will publish the name of this year's
winner of the Financial Times Architecture Award. He or she will receive
Britain's most independent and highly regarded architectural prize at a
luncheon in London today. The long period of judging and visiting is over
and there will be an opportunity in tomorrow's paper for an assessment of
the significance of the award and of the state of architecture in Britain
today.
Previous articles have looked at five of the eight shortlisted schemes:
Stansted Airport and Cranfield Library by Sir Norman Foster and Partners;
and Bracken House, Schlumberger Research and Bedfont Lakes (IBM) Business
Park by Michael Hopkins and Partners. The remaining three schemes on the
shortlist represent three very different types of building. The Queen's
Stand at Epsom Racecourse by Richard Horden Associates; the new car park in
Chichester by Birds Portchmouth and Russum; and Winchester City offices
designed by the Hampshire County Architects department.
Epsom clearly needed an elegant new stand that could comfortably house the
crowds on Derby day as well as provide a centre for functions and
entertainments throughout the year. The choice of Richard Horden and
Associates as architects was a brave one. The practice is known for its
structural and engineering expertise and its experimental approach to
building technology. The client, United Racecourses, has, by choosing a
radical approach that is both refined and practical, acquired a new stand
that is the acme of contemporary design.
The problem of new buildings in England's cathedral cities has been tackled
in two very distinctive and different ways in Winchester and Chichester.
Both cities have mixed reputations when it comes to new architecture, but it
is fair to say that both places take great care about any additions to their
ancient fabric.
Winchester has a county architects department that is one of the most
distinguished in the country. Under the direction of Colin Stansfield-Smith,
Hampshire has acquired a high reputation, particularly for its new schools
and other educational buildings. The site of the new offices, which are
partly occupied by the architects' department, is a typical, tight
Winchester street, but one that had been spoiled in earlier days by the
erection of a large multi-storey car park. The new offices try to be both
modern and vernacular, adopting a traditional pitched roofline but lighting
the offices through a completely glazed wall. This gives it the appearance
of working in an atrium, except that it has a remarkable view over the city.
An agreeable courtyard garden designed around an existing tree is another
feature of the scheme, adding to its overall picturesque qualities. The
pavement passed close to one side of the new block and this facade has been
enlivened by the presence of specially commissioned stained glass windows.
Chichester had a problem. The city is keen on traffic management and car
parking is a crucial element of any traffic scheme. The decision to build a
large, new multi-storey car park on the edge of the city centre but outside
the old city walls was a controversial one. Chichester decided to commission
a relatively unknown young practice, Birds Portchmouth and Russum, and the
resulting building is extraordinary in many ways.
The architects decided not to diminish the scale of the whole operation but
to make the car park look like a new set of city defences. The length of the
building is broken up by the fat, circular staircase towers which are built
of perforated brick work. Once you have parked your car the journey from the
car park into the city centre takes you on a series of high level pedestrian
bridges from which you can view the ancient town.
Even in these recessionary years the quality of the best of British
architecture is very high. Choosing a winner for the FT award will not be
easy.
