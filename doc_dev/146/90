Seeing a replica of the sleek, sculpted facade of the Pan Pacific Auditorium 
here in Disney World was a shock, especially after having passed by the charred 
ruins of the original a few days before in Los Angeles' Fairfax District. 
</P>
<P>
I had heard that the Streamline Moderne-styled Pan had been meticulously 
reconstructed as the main entrance to the new Disney-MGM Studios Theme Park 
outside Orlando, and made a point to go see it while on a pilgrimage here 
recently with two of my four Mousketeers. 
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, there was the reconstituted Pan, graced by the four curved 
flagpole pylons in the shape of giant fins that had distinguished the original 
when it was built in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
Although slightly reduced in scale and modified with ticket booths and 
turnstiles, the replicated Pan exudes a sense of time and place -- a quality 
that had earned the original building its landmark status at local, state and 
national levels. 
</P>
<P>
Even the signage, with its compressed block "Queen Mary modern" typography, is 
right out of the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted something as the gateway to the park that was easily recognizable 
and that captured the spirit of Los Angeles and Hollywood in the Golden 1930s 
and '40s," explained architect Robert Weis, a senior vice president of World 
Disney Imagineering, which designed the new theme park. "The Pan with its 
pylons seemed absolutely correct." 
</P>
<P>
The replication in Disney World, completed nearly to the day the original was 
destroyed in an arsonist's fire eight months ago, is heavy with an irony that 
makes me heartsick. 
</P>
<P>
For 10 years before the fatal fire, preservationists in Los Angeles had pressed 
for the Pan's renovation. 
</P>
<P>
Various plans were put forward, with one finally emerging out of a county 
competition in 1988 calling for recycling and expanding the landmark with 
private funds as an entertainment and community services complex. 
</P>
<P>
However, bureaucratic inertia, parochial neighborhood protests and lack of 
political courage stalled the plan. Meanwhile, the Pan stood vacant and 
deteriorating, a target for vandalism and, inevitably, the fire. 
</P>
<P>
The result is that one of the city's more magnificent architectural and 
cultural symbols, and one of a few to be listed on the National Register of 
Historic Places, is a charred ruin. 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, there are various plans for its restoration, but most involve 
public funds and are as wispy as smoke. There is no evidence of a civic will to 
make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to its credit, Disney Imagineering has had the vision to use the 
design of the Pan to set the architectural scene of its latest theme park based 
upon Hollywood of "the fabulous '30s and '40s." 
</P>
<P>
Also in the park, just beyond the Pan, is a replica of the Crossroads of the 
World tower (the original perseveres at 6671 Sunset Blvd.). It appropriately 
serves as an information booth at the head of engaging "Hollywood Boulevard," 
lined with the facades of an evocative collection of other Los Angeles period 
architecture. 
</P>
<P>
These include the Dark Room (the original is at 5370 Wilshire Blvd.), with its 
display window in the form of an oversized 1930s camera, and a brilliant 
selection of Hollywood Boulevard Art Deco-styled store fronts, marked by a mix 
of Vitrolite glass panels and zigzagged gold terra-cotta panels embossed with 
designs reminiscent of Southwest Indian rugs. Among the facades hinted at are 
J. J. Newberry's and Frederick's (in the 6600 block of Hollywood Boulevard). 
</P>
<P>
There is also a replica of the Chinese Theatre (6925 Hollywood Blvd.); a host 
of thematic restaurants, such as the Brown Derby, and 1950s-styled cafeterias; 
an ice cream stand in the form of a dinosaur, and an "Echo Park" lake. All 
radiate a spirit of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
"What we have tried to create is an 'idealized' L.A. in Florida," Weis said. 
"Just as Main Street in the Magic Kingdom was created in the 1950s as a 
nostalgic vision of turn-of-the-century small-town America, our Hollywood 
Boulevard is a nostalgic vision of Los Angeles of 50 years ago. Helping is the 
city's rich architectural vocabulary of the time." 
</P>
<P>
So, while Los Angeles is letting its landmarks deteriorate or be bulldozed, 
Disney, after a fashion, is saving them, albeit in a very controlled 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps someday to get a sense of the rich cultural and architectural heritage 
of Hollywood in the '30s, we may just have to travel to Florida and pay an 
entrance fee. 
</P>
<P>
You would think that by now the value of historic preservation in economic and 
social terms (read tourism and pride) would be appreciated in Tinseltown, the 
dream factory of the world. It is certainly being appreciated here in the 
Florida outback. 
</P>
<P>
There were other urban design lessons to be learned in Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
Weis said that critical to the design and construction process in all Disney 
projects was not only respect for the spirit of the varying styles copied, but 
a particular sensitivity for the pedestrian experience. 
</P>
<P>
The architect, a graduate of Cal Poly Pomona, added that all the heights of 
buildings, the widths of streets and the sizes of plazas were reduced to what 
he described as "Disneyland scale" so none would overwhelm people. 
</P>
<P>
Also noted was the prepossessing Disney penchant for cleanliness and 
friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to create environments that make people feel safe and comfortable," 
Weis said. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad aim for any planning and design effort. Certainly, Los Angeles could 
use such "imagineering."
