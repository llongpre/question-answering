The Orange County chapter of the American Institute of Architects has honored 
projects conceived by local architects that are still "on the boards" -- 
designs that are not yet built. Of the eight awards (in "honor," "merit" and 
"honorable mention" categories) bestowed at AIA's meeting Friday, three were 
for educational buildings. 
</P>
<P>
The UC Irvine Science Library -- designed by James Stirling, Michael Willford 
&amp; Associates of London and the IBI Group of Newport Beach -- won an honor 
award. Lawrence W. Speck, professor of architecture at the University of Texas 
at Austin and spokesman for the four-member jury, called the circular edifice 
with massive vertical wings "a monumental building of great presence" and 
further praised its "beautifully functioning" interior with private study. He 
said jury members were "a little concerned," however, about the folded glass on 
the facade. 
</P>
<P>
Speck added that the jury was "surprised" to learn that the library was 
designed in association with Stirling, the eminent British architect: "We just 
liked it because we liked it." Working drawings are being completed for the 
project, and bidding on the construction is scheduled in October. 
</P>
<P>
New Elementary School, Wood Ranch Site in the Simi Valley, by the Blurock 
Partnership of Newport Beach, also won an honor award. "No one deserves good 
architecture better than little kids," Speck said, singling out the project's 
"strong, clear concept" and "well-developed plan" in which diverse elements are 
unified "under a simple, broad roof." Construction is expected to begin next 
spring, pending design approval by the school board. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman Hills Elementary School in Orange, designed by Dougherty &amp; 
Dougherty of Newport Beach, won a merit award. Speck said the organization of 
the plan -- small groups of classrooms under an expansive roof -- gives the 
building the feeling of a big, community-embracing "house." Construction has 
begun, and the project is scheduled to be completed in February. 
</P>
<P>
Designed by Mark H. Singer &amp; Associates of Laguna Beach, the Singer 
Residence -- the architect's own house in Laguna Beach -- won an honor award 
for "very experimental, personal expression" and the "sensual quality of space 
and materials." The concrete walls were inspired by the materials of the house 
in which Singer's wife, Myriam, lived in her native Peru. The house is under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
Another award of merit was given to Valley Telecommunications Headquarters in 
Van Nuys, designed by Leason Pomeroy Associates of Irvine, for "the ability to 
make a vernacular industrial remnant into a very sophisticated and humanized 
environment" in which even the tower serves as a visual symbol for 
telecommunications. Groundbreaking is scheduled for January. 
</P>
<P>
Honorable mentions went to Mark A. Keller &amp; Associates of Huntington Beach 
for a budget-minded solution to low-income housing on a multi-use site -- the 
Rugby Senior Apartments in Huntington Park -- and to Wimberly Allison Tong 
&amp; Goo of Newport Beach for a renovation scheme for the Ritz-Carlton 
Huntington in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The "People's Choice" award -- voted by passers-by who saw renderings of the 85 
entries in South Coast Plaza's Jewel Court last week -- went to St. Paul's 
Greek Orthodox Church, designed by Grillias Pirc Rosier Alves of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
During introductory remarks, Speck noted dryly that the jury had been 
"intrigued by the 'Mission-ization' of Orange County. We saw more red-tile 
roofs . . . " The audience of 500 architects and guests roared with laughter. 
</P>
<P>
The Newport Harbor Art Museum's recent decision to fire internationally 
renowned Italian architect Renzo Piano, and to replace him with Kohn Pedersen 
Fox &amp; Associates of New York, didn't pass without comment. 
</P>
<P>
"They've traded Ingmar Bergman for Steven Spielberg," lamented one local 
architect, even though he said he had serious reservations about the 
effectiveness of Piano's design because of its heavy dependence on 
state-of-the-art technology. 
</P>
<P>
Another architect expressed surprise at his colleague's quip: "Spielberg? Oh, I 
would have said someone with a lot less artistry than that." 
</P>
<P>
The jury also included James A. Murphy, profession and industry editor of 
Progressive Architecture magazine; William Turnbull Jr., director of William 
Turnbull &amp; Associates in San Francisco; and Peter Walker of Peter Walker 
Associates, a San Francisco landscape architecture firm.

FOR THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
Architecture winner -- Engineering Unit 2, designed for the UC Irvine campus by 
Zimmer Gunsul Frasca Partnership of Newport Beach, was inadvertently omitted 
from Tuesday's list of awards given by the Orange County chapter of the 
American Institute of Architects. The project, on which construction is 
expected to start in fall of 1991, received a Merit award. Juror Lawrence Speck 
cited the "responsiveness" of the design to the two adjacent buildings designed 
by Los Angeles architect Frank Gehry and to the "not-always-successful" master 
plan of the campus. Speck also noted the "monumentality" of the entryway and 
the architects' tip of the hat to Beaux Arts-style planning in the focus and 
axis of the building.
