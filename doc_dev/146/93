Here are a couple of location shots from a Los Angeles movie scripted to give a 
quick fix on the dramatic contrasts of the city's skyline: 
</P>
<P>
Long shot: Seen from the brow of the Brentwood hilltop, Los Angeles sprawls 
toward the Pacific like a loosely woven quilt thrown over the rough brown back 
of the semi-desert landscape. The Wilshire Boulevard corridor runs like a 
dinosaur spine from downtown to the ocean, poking up high-rise spikes in the 
dusty evening light. 
</P>
<P>
Close-up: At the corner of Wilshire and Westwood boulevards, glittering towers 
crowd the sky, grinding the person on the sidewalk into insignificance. Caught 
between the horizontal metallic crush of cars and the gleaming upright slabs, 
the individual feels like nothing more than a ghostly smudge in this hard-edged 
urbanity. 
</P>
<P>
The first shot could only be taken in Los Angeles. Unlike any other major city, 
its scale is humane, loosely textured and emotionally unoppressive, offering an 
unequalled sense of spaciousness. The low-rise skyline, in which landscape and 
architecture are intimately woven together, epitomizes the Angelization of the 
American metropolis. The second shot, which could be taken in any major U.S. 
city, captures the claustrophobic Manhattanization of Los Angeles that has 
provoked so many Westside and Valley residents into a revolution against 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
Angelization or Manhattanization -- this is the profound choice Los Angeles 
faces as the city's boundless commercial vigor and increasing cultural 
sophistication continues to attract waves of new residents from all over the 
the world. Shouldn't the city enhance its inherent style rather than trash its 
heritage in search of an alien image now largely discredited elsewhere? "Los 
Angeles is up against the wall," said Robert Harris, dean of architecture at 
USC. "It faces a challenge most U.S. cities have failed to meet successfully in 
recent decades -- how to grow more densely populated without sacrificing a 
humane scale based on each man's sense of belonging. At heart, it's a question 
of identity." 
</P>
<P>
Like Harris, a number of L.A.'s prominent architects and urban designers have 
been pondering the problem in discussion groups, in forums and on their drawing 
boards. From this dialogue, debate and hands-on experience, some constructive 
ideas are starting to surface. They offer alternatives to the urban pathology 
that has consumed New York. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Los Angeles, Century City, Westwood along Wilshire, stretches of 
Ventura Boulevard and Warner Center in Woodland Hills have already fallen 
victim to Manhattanization. Other areas fear the heavy tread of approaching 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
Defenders of the Manhattan model argue that the appetite for low-rise growth, 
which has covered the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys with so many suburbs 
since World War II, has gobbled up almost all the available land in Southern 
California. The suburbs are creeping into the Mojave desert at Palmdale and 
Lancaster, and chewing up miles of farmland in the Inland Empire. But that does 
not really answer the needs of people who want to live close to the best jobs. 
</P>
<P>
In his book "The City as a Work of Art," Vassar College history professor 
Donald J. Olsen demonstrates that some cities, such as London, Paris and 
Vienna, can be perceived as "works of art rather than instances of social 
pathology." Manhattan, in Olsen's view, is a typically "pathological" U.S. city 
shaped solely by the market, with only marginal intervention of the creative 
imagination committed to "set forth the grander and larger purposes of life." 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Los Angeles, the most Manhattanized section of the city, is a poor 
copy of the New York model that crowds commercial and residential towers in a 
cluster of clunky stalagmites. A pattern of skyscrapers set cheek-by-jowl, 
begun in the 1960s and '70s, today dictates the form of L.A.'s urban core. 
</P>
<P>
At the crown of Bunker Hill, a phalanx of commercial, civic and cultural 
buildings creates a dense precinct along Grand Avenue. The core of this 
mini-Manhattan is the planned Disney Hall music complex, designed by Frank 
Gehry, and Arata Isozaki's Museum of Contemporary Art. Linking them is the 
massive, partially completed California Plaza development, which, when 
completed in the mid-1990s, will include three office towers, a 440-room hotel 
and three high-rise condominium buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"We need a density of building on Bunker Hill to justify the economics of 
development based on the very high price of land," said Nyal Leslie, president 
of Metropolitan Structures West, the California Plaza developers. "Mid-rise 
buildings simply wouldn't cut it." 
</P>
<P>
The commercial investment is so intense on Bunker Hill that there is no 
stopping the march of the towers. As far as Angelization goes, downtown is a 
write-off -- a monster created by the profit motive and abetted by 
short-sighted municipal politics. But Los Angeles still has a chance to be true 
to its own home-grown destiny, said architect Jon Jerde. He believes "the eyes 
of the world are upon us in this endeavor. Every major city looks to Los 
Angeles for an urban style that offers an alternative to the Manhattan model, 
which has proven so unpleasant and essentially inhuman." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'Centers Concept' 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s first formal attempts to grapple with the nature of its unique urban 
character date to the late 1960s. Los Angeles adopted a "Centers Concept" that 
proposed restricting high-rise development, both residential and commercial, to 
about 45 areas ranging in intensity from downtown's skyscraper cluster to less 
densely built-up cores, such as Warner Center and Westwood Village. By 
concentrating vertical growth in these centers, planners hoped to preserve the 
city's low-rise, single-family neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Century City is the most prominent offspring of the Centers Concept. Popping up 
beside the pleasant, shady avenues of Beverly Hills, Century City's towers have 
the air of overgrown and unsuitable guests who have long outstayed their 
welcomes. When location scouts for one of the sequels to the movie "Planet of 
the Apes" were searching for a backdrop that epitomized the inhumanity of the 
modern metropolis, they chose Century City. 
</P>
<P>
"Century City is not the way for L.A. to go," said architect Barton Myers. 
"Apart from the fact that such a conglomeration of skyscrapers demands a public 
transit system that would cost the earth to build, they run counter to the 
basic urban traditions of the city." 
</P>
<P>
These urban traditions include the ample, low-rise, tree-lined character of 
most of our older districts or "urban villages." These urban villages are 
threaded together by the sinews of "linear downtowns," such as the 17-mile 
stretch of Wilshire Boulevard between Bunker Hill and Santa Monica. Los Angeles 
invented the car-oriented linear downtown in the early 1930s, beginning with 
the stretch of Wilshire Boulevard that runs past Bullocks. 
</P>
<P>
The widely admired urban design pattern that L.A. best embodies is dubbed the 
"multi-citied city." In this model, the metropolis is made up of a 
"constellation" of urban villages interconnected by common concerns. These 
self-centered districts are not focused on a Manhattan-style urban core that 
massively dominates the economic, social and cultural life of the entire city. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles grew in a unique way as a collection of small towns that knitted 
together to create the metropolitan region we inherit," Myers said. "This is 
our tradition, which we must embrace and enhance, rather than import alien 
models that have failed elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
Myers is fond of pointing out that cities don't have to be built high to be 
built densely. As the head of the design review committee for the proposed 
$1-billion Hollywood Redevelopment Project, Myers advocates a mid-rise solution 
for Hollywood Boulevard and its environs rather than a row of skyscrapers. 
</P>
<P>
Meyers has prepared a series of studies that demonstrate that, by covering an 
area with horizontal buildings instead of sticking a free-standing tower on an 
empty plaza in the middle of each lot, you can achieve the same density of 
population while keeping the skyline low and honoring the established street 
patterns. 
</P>
<P>
The population of many L.A. districts could be doubled, many designers say, by 
building low-profile "in-fill" housing, which would add units to the deep back 
yards of existing single-family houses. This would enable an area to 
accommodate more people without radically altering the essential character of 
settled neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Such a program could have a substantial positive impact on L.A.'s housing 
shortage without changing the city's "look." 
</P>
<P>
Another urban model favored by many architects is based on the traditional 
American college campus. In this model, seen locally at UCLA in Westwood, low- 
to mid-rise buildings are integrated with park-like public spaces, which gives 
a sense of spacious shelter. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
'An L.A. Layout' 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA is a densely populated mini-city of 50,000 daytime inhabitants who seldom 
feel oppressed by their built environment," said Richard Weinstein, dean of the 
UCLA Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning. "The layout is very 
L.A. in its unrigid free form that is simultaneously complex, easy to 
understand and pleasant to be in." The pressure of population density and the 
press of development bears down differently on each of L.A.'s diverse 
neighborhoods. While the Westside, downtown and sections of the Valley are 
coveted by developers, South Central and East Los Angeles are thirsty for 
dollars to revive run-down neighborhoods and provide affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
A border area between these separate realities is the district now known as 
Central City West, which is on the west side of the Harbor Freeway opposite 
downtown. Central City West's 150 acres, home to a number of legal and illegal 
immigrants, is poised on the verge of massive redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to find visual and human clues that are intrinsic to the nature of 
one of L.A.'s oldest neighborhoods," said Cliff Allen, the architect in charge 
of planning Central City West. He hopes to avoid creating the kind of overbuilt 
high-rise scenario that discourages a sense of community and depresses the soul 
of urban man. 
</P>
<P>
"As we go along, we will try to strike a balance between a democratic, 
participatory process and the need to shape the district as a humane 
environment. We hope it will be a model for reviving run-down sections of the 
city to accommodate more people." While these examples demonstrate how L.A.'s 
existing districts might be developed to greater density without 
Manhattanization, several major projects on virgin land are attempting to 
express a uniquely Angelized city form. 
</P>
<P>
The 900 acres of Playa Vista, between Westchester and Marina del Rey, will be 
carved into coherent mini-neighborhoods, each with its own village-style 
stores, parks and public squares based on a pedestrian's pace and an active 
street life. 
</P>
<P>
Playa Vista will be laid out in two- and three-story residential clusters; no 
commercial building will be taller than 10 stories. Instead, the emphasis of 
the plan will be on its public, rather than private, spaces, including streets, 
plazas and parks. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than develop raw real estate without concern for the quality of life," 
said developer Nelson Rising of Maguire Thomas Partners, "we see this as a 
chance to create a real community from the ground up, complete with all the 
vital civic and commercial services." 
</P>
<P>
Jon Jerde has designed a unique $2-billion "Entertainment City" planned around 
the studios of Universal City. Jerde's innovative idea is the creation of a 
vast, low, dome-like development on the crest of Universal's hill that mixes 
entertainment areas, including the popular Universal Studios Tour, with 
offices, shops and housing. Meandering avenues lined with sidewalk cafes link 
plazas and parks, and offer open views of the San Gabriel and Santa Monica 
mountain ranges. 
</P>
<P>
Skyscrapers are not entirely alien to Los Angeles. We have a home-grown 
tradition of tower buildings, such as City Hall, the Capitol Records building 
in Hollywood or Sunset Tower -- now the St.James Club -- on Sunset Boulevard. 
But the architectural character of truly Angeleno towers depends on their being 
spaced far enough apart from one another so that each one reads separately on 
the skyline. 
</P>
<P>
Scott Johnson, designer of the prominently isolated Fox Plaza high-rise in 
Century City, explains that towers spaced far apart is the model Frank Lloyd 
Wright proposed for his ideal American city plan, called Broadacre City. 
</P>
<P>
"Wright saw the skyscraper as an archetypal American construction that could 
enjoy the spaciousness of our cities, especially in the West," he said. 
"Clustering them close together in the usual Century City way is un-Angeleno." 
</P>
<P>
"When did Los Angeles abandon its aspirations to be one of the great cities of 
Western civilization and settle for just being large?" asked Kurt Meyer, a 
prominent architect who is a former chairman of the Community Redevelopment 
Agency. "We saw in the special way we handled the 1984 Olympics that we have a 
dynamic urban environment that has capitalized on its geography and its human 
talents to make L.A. a truly world-class city, in its own unique style."
