<LEADPARA>  Plans for a $2.8 million expansion and remodeling of the main library in Los
Altos have been approved by the Los Altos City Council.;    When completed
late in 1992, the now-cramped library will have twice as much space, quiet
reading areas with ceiling to floor windows overlooking an expansive apricot
orchard, additional parking spaces, and a more extensive computerized card
catalog system.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     "We are really happy with the design," said Carol Tefft, chief librarian.
"It carves out a nice entry, and incorporates the fountain as part of the
entry courtyard. And there's a marvelous opportunity to experience the apricot
orchards that are a part of our past.;    "The plans accomplish all the goals
we were looking for, that is to give us more space, to provide a program room
and to establish a group study area. . . . We were able to design a separate
lobby area for the circulation desk, which removes the noise from the main
reading room.";    The plans, submitted by Ehrlich-Rominger Architects of Los
Altos, show that the size of the library will grow from 13,900 to 27,700
square feet. And parking will increase from about 60 spaces to 95, said Mark
L. Davis, an associate with the firm.;    The library will house more
computerized card catalogs, videos, cassettes, magazines and books.;    The
expansion also will add about 82 seats to the current 126. It will allow the
library to increase its collection to almost 200,000 books and periodicals.;  
 Davis said the additional area will provide for expansion of the adult and
children's collections; a new 1,300-square-foot community room that could be
used for story hours, puppet programs, adult programs and other public events
and meetings; a new lobby-circulation desk; separate group study room; more
space for quiet study; an additional staff room; and more room for computers
and other new technologies that are replacing print indexes and card
catalogs.;    Architects plan to add a gable in a section of the roof along
the San Antonio Road side of the building to break its linear appearance.;   
Plans also call for a new trellis extending from the library entrance to the
fountain at San Antonio Road "to give the library a sense of entry.";    In
November 1990, voters in Los Altos and Los Altos Hills passed a parcel tax
increase measure that will permit the enlargement and remodeling of their
shared main library.;    By approving the measure, voters raised their annual
parcel tax from $27 a year to a flat charge of $36 a year in December 1991. In
succeeding years, the maximum rate will be $52 a year per parcel.;    The tax
override supplements the money the library receives from the Santa Clara
County Library budget.;    Davis said the final architectural plans are
expected by July 1. The project will go out to bid in mid-July. Construction
is scheduled tentatively to start at the end of September and be completed by
November 1992.  </TEXT>
