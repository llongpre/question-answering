   The developer chosen to lead the next phase of building on New York's Roosevelt Island will have its work cut out for it, literally. 

   The state of New York, which is leasing the 147-acre island from New York City, has some very definite ideas for the 2,000 apartments to be built. 
The state's plans, to be announced next month, require that 50% of the units be set aside for moderate- and low-income families, a substantial increase from the typical 20% in government-sponsored construction projects. 

   Further, a state-retained architect already has outlined the size and placement of buildings, the types of materials to be used and layouts for public areas. 
The state will also mandate waterfront access and central parking facilities for the traffic-free island. 

   State officials hope the advance planning will be a plus in attracting major developers in New York to a complicated, high-risk project on the East River island. 

   But developers will have to decide whether the trade-off is worth it. 
The developer will be giving up some of its freedom of choice, but it won't be responsible for certain up-front development costs, such as site planning and environmental studies, because those have been covered by the state. 
And the plan has been approved by representatives of the local community and is exempt from municipal government review. 

   "There are a lot of things the developer doesn't have to do," says Rosina K. Abramson, president of Roosevelt Island Operating Corp., a division of the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal that oversees development on Roosevelt Island. 
"We've amassed the land, there is no displacement (of current residents), there is minimal demolition required, the infrastructure is planned," Ms. Abramson says. 

   The greatest amount of planning has gone into guidelines for low-income housing, Ms. Abramson explains. 
"The state's goal is to make sure the affordable units get built, " she says. 
"We don't want anyone to cheat." 
While the developer will be limited in what it can charge for half the units, it can try to get top dollar for the other half. 
Planners hope the builder will be able to sell the market-rate, or luxury, units for more than $300 a square foot, although that price is still lower than typical new luxury-housing prices in nearby Manhattan. 
The state plans to share in the profit from the sale of those apartments. 

   The 19-acre development, to be called Southtown, will comprise seven towers, ranging from 18- to 28-stories tall, six smaller apartment buildings, day-care facilities, retail space, parks and esplanades, according to the state's plans. 
The westernmost units, with Manhattan views, will comprise most of the market-rate condominiums. 
When completed, the community could house about 5,000 people, almost doubling the island's current population of 6,000. 

   "The plan is quite specific, but it does have some flexibility for developers," says urban planner and architect Raquel Ramati, who created the master plan for the community. 
For example, developers will be able to direct the architecture, layout and interior of the market-rate, or luxury apartments, she says. 

   But it remains to be seen whether the government's land-use plan will make economic sense to builders. 
The chosen developer will lease the land from the state's operating corporation, but the lease payments will be made up front in the form of improvements to the area such as parks and streets. 
State officials estimate the developer's total cost to be between $350 million and $400 million and expect the construction to take three or four years. 

   "Our criteria for selecting a developer will be the quality of his design team, experience and financial capability, as well as the amount the developer is proposing to share with the state with respect to the market rate housing," says Stephen H. Shane, special assistant to the state commissioner of housing. 

   The state's specific plans for Roosevelt Island are a response to the disappearance of state and federal subsidies for affordable housing. 

   The state had created a master plan for the island in 1969 that envisioned a mixed-income community, just 300 yards east of midtown Manhattan. 
In the mid-1970s some 2,000 units of government-subsidized housing were built there. 
But 20 years after the original plan was drawn up, many federal and state subsidies vanished. 

   A long lull in development on Roosevelt Island ended this year with a private developer's completion of a project with just over 1,000 rental units -- 80% of them market-rate apartments and 20% for low-income residents. 

   Compelled to find new ways to finance the affordable units, the state is relying on a "cross-subsidy," with high-priced apartments supporting lower-priced ones and paying for infrastructural improvements; hence the rare 50/50 mix of housing in the plans for Southtown. 

   Planners also hope the development will get a boost from the long-awaited completion of a crosstown subway that will serve Roosevelt Island. 
Although the island is reachable by car, many residents travel there by tramway. 
The crosstown subway, under construction since 1968, has been compared to the Loch Ness monster: it's supposedly under the water but never appears. 
The subway is now scheduled to surface in October.
