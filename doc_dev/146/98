<LEADPARA>  ONE DISASTER in the Oakland hills is enough.;   Yet if some politicians have
their way, a second disaster looms there, one that would take away practically
all that remains in the wake of the fire -- the tradition of the people who
live in those hills.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Although the politicians' proposals to widen streets, create fire breaks
and restrict building materials would make the hills less vulnerable to fire,
they threaten to destroy the hills' character.;   The hillside home has been
part of the heart and soul of the Bay Area since people began migrating into
the hills almost 90 years ago. Architect Bernard Maybeck and his friend
Charles Keeler formed the Hillside Club in 1902 and proclaimed the simple and
uplifting life to be led in simple houses of native redwood with incomparable
views.;   The price of a simple hillside home has changed drastically, and
redwood is no longer the inexpensive material it once was. But the same spirit
still draws people to the East Bay hills.;   That spirit needs to be rebuilt.
Lost in the flames were architectural gems by Maybeck, Julia Morgan, Ernest
Coxhead and others from the golden age of Bay Area architecture. Also gone are
examples from later architects who developed and strengthened the tradition:
William Wurster, Warren Callister and Moore/Lyndon/Turnbull/Whittaker.;  
These superb residences set a pattern for scale, diversity, siting and
materials that others followed. New development must continue that tradition.;
  Most of the safety proposals are logical:;   (check) Insist on
fire-resistant roofs.;   (check) Widen roads to ease fire engine access.;  
(check) Cut broad fire breaks through the hills.;   (check) Keep flammable
vegetation away from houses.;   But if these proposals are carried out in a
panic, without sensitive design and intelligent planning, they could leave a
permanent scar on the East Bay hills long after the trees grow back.;  
Fire-resistant roofs are logical. But a glut of red tile roofs and stucco
walls will destroy the hills' characteristic diversity. They must not become
Santa Barbara -- or worse, Irvine-north.;   But that monotony can be easily
avoided with some inspired design. We only have to look at the locals'
response to an equally devastating fire in the Berkeley hills in 1923.;  
Maybeck, ever one to turn disaster on its head, experimented with
fire-resistant materials. He had lost his own redwood house, but rebuilt in a
special lightweight concrete. He dipped burlap in the mix and then hung it on
a wire (like clothes on a line) to make course after course for his walls. The
marvelously textured house still stands on Maybeck Twin Drive. A few years
later he designed his son's hillside house, a mini-baronial manse, in concrete
with corrugated iron roofing. Berkeley and Oakland must insist on the same
creativity today.;   Especially dangerous to the character of the hills are
proposals to widen roads. Grading and reduced setbacks from redesigned roads
can completely destroy the intimacy of a neighborhood. Civic will must insist
that roads be widened with great care.;   Greenbelts as fire breaks offer the
greatest opportunity to continue the natural lifestyle in a new form. More
houses could back up to parks or golf courses winding through the hillside. A
talented landscape architect could turn these meadows into something
wonderful. But more likely this proposal will be delayed by political
controversy: Lots bought by the city for green space could reduce the tax
base. Ideally, large tracts of burned acreage would treated as planned
developments with clustered lots sharing large collective greenswards.
Landscaping will be critical.;   Time is of the essence. Planning needs to
start immediately. Despite a ready-made plan, Daniel Burnham lost the
opportunity to reorganize San Francisco's streets after the 1906 fire.;  
Before he could get anything adopted, most blocks had already been rebuilt, as
poorly as before the fire. In Berkeley and Oakland, the planning process needs
to move rapidly but also wisely -- a tricky balance. It must encourage
rebuilding while keeping an eye on quality, variety and safety.;   The Oakland
hills are part of the region's cultural heritage. The best architects and
landscape architects in the Bay Area must be called on to help. The results
could be a model for hillside development throughout Northern California.;  
The 1923 fire also swept away a generation of homes. Yet Berkeley rebuilt
brilliantly. It's Oakland's and Berkeley's duty to do the same today.  </TEXT>
