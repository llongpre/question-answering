Henry Moore Institute in Leeds

On Thursday the Henry Moore Institute opens in Leeds. The opening event is
an important occasion for two reasons. Firstly, the new institute is the
headquarters of the Henry Moore Sculpture Trust, which has the exciting
remit to encourage the appreciation of sculpture of all periods; secondly,
the inauguration will unveil to the public an intriguing and original new
building by the architects Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones.
'New building' is not quite an accurate description of the centre, which is
a conversion of three 19th-century wool merchants' office buildings at the
end of Cookridge Street, next door to the Leeds City Art Gallery. Leeds has
some marvellous architectural set pieces from the last century, especially
the proud, bombastic Town Hall by Cuthbert Broderick (1858). Its great tower
rising out of the vast columned base is grander than Greenwich and redolent
of Halicarnassus, despite being in the Corinthian mode.
Broderick's oval Corn Exchange in Duncan Street is also a remarkable
structure and has been well adapted to its new retail uses. The City Square
demonstrates the pride the city fathers of Leeds had in their urban
improvements, and the statuary - particularly the equestrian statue of the
Black Prince and the rows of bronze maidens holding their lamps - are
effective sculptural elements in the townscape.
Sculpture is a growth industry in Yorkshire, largely because of the
activities of the Henry Moore Foundation. Henry Moore was born in 1898 in
Castleford near Leeds, the son of a Yorkshire coal miner. He went as a
student to the Leeds art college after his demobilisation in 1919, and later
to the Royal College of Art in London. At the Royal College he was to meet
Barbara Hepworth as a fellow student - she had been born in Wakefield and
was a scholar supported by the West Riding County Council. Coincidentally,
their joint creative careers are both marked this year by the opening of
this centre in Leeds and by the opening of the Tate Gallery in St. Ives,
Cornwall, where Hepworth worked.
All this Yorkshire creativity has come home to roost in Leeds, where the
Henry Moore Foundation has spent Pounds 5m on the new centre. It has one of
the very few new galleries in Europe designed specifically for the display
of sculpture. Jeremy Dixon and Edward Jones are clearly inspired by their
frequent visits to the US. They seem to have absorbed that particularly
American art gallery 'feel': in their conversion, the immaculate, minimally
detailed white rooms gently smooths away the past of the old houses. It is a
feeling I like for its neutrality and coolness, which demands great care
from the architects and the project builders, depending as it does on
precision.
The major shock is the facade that greets you as you arrive on The Headrow.
The long square from the Town Hall to the war memorial is a recent creation.
Many of the buildings that face onto it were not designed with any civic
presence. The new entrance facade of Moore Institute was originally the
naked cut-off gable end of a partly demolished row of houses. The
architects' bold decision to make this wall the entrance to the Institute
demanded some architectural imagination to create a suitably civic facade.
Not surprisingly they opted for a sculptural solution, but of the most
minimalist kind. The architects have designed flights of steps mounting up
towards the shiny blank black granite, where an asymmetrically placed slot
marks the narrow entrance. The large black wall is totally abstract and
could as easily represent a Yorkshire coalface or an ancient Egyptian tomb.
It is to my eye reminiscent of the great black granite wall that forms the
Vietnam war memorial in Washington DC. Or is it perhaps inspired by those
'vest pocket parks' that utilise the end-walls of partly demolished
buildings in New York City and turn them into walls of water? Perhaps it is
none of these things, but just a suggestion of a huge block of granite
awaiting the hand of the sculptor. It is a radical and unusual solution to
the planning problem. It certainly does not look inviting; my feeling is
that it looks more like a tomb for Henry Moore than anything else.
Inside, things are decidedly more cheerful. Light breaks out in a splendid
way in the new main sculpture gallery, which has one entire wall of bronze
framed obscured glass. The opening exhibition, Romanesque Stone Sculpture
from Medieval England looks very good in this space despite the rather
heavy-handed, but presumably necessary, metal mounts and stands. There is an
opportunity to look at recently restored work from York Minster and Lincoln
cathedrals. The good level of natural light and the total absence of any
architectural detail make it possible for sculpture of all periods to be
shown here with ease. The upper floors house the archive and study centre
and the top floor has handsome administrative offices and a board room. The
whole institute is linked to the main art gallery by an elegant new bridge.
There is a lot to admire in the timber, glass and painted plaster interior
of this new institute, and pleasure to be had in the atmosphere of calmness
and contemplation that the architects have successfully created. The black
facade shows how hard it is to move beyond the vacancies of abstraction to a
convincing language for the faces of new public buildings.
