   Canadian production of market pulp rose 11% in February from a year earlier, and output exceeded the industry's officially rated capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 587,000 metric tons of market pulp, compared with 530,000 metric tons in February 1986. 
Market pulp output in the first two months of 1987 rose 15%. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and containerboard. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed in the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The association said the industry produced at 105% of its rated capacity in February, compared with 99% in January and 98% in February 1986. 
Capacity figures are calculated on an annual basis, taking into account closures for holidays and maintenance, but there were few maintenance closures and no holidays last February, accounting for the high rate for the latest month, an association official said. 

   He also noted that when demand for market pulp is good, some producers reduce their output of paper and sell pulp used to make that paper on the open market. 

   Shipments in February totaled 544,000 metric tons, a 4% increase from 523,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
Exports to the U.S. rose 8.2% to 185,000 metric tons from 171,000 metric tons, while exports to western Europe declined 15% to 153,000 metric tons from 179,000 metric tons. 

   Canadian producer inventories totaled 410,000 metric tons at the end of February, representing a 22-day supply, up 12% from 367,000 metric tons, or a 20-day supply, at the end of January, but off 21% from 521,000 metric tons, or a 30-day supply, at the end of February 1986.
