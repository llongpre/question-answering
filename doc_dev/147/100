   OTTAWA -- The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said
imports of U.S. wastepaper could account for more than 50% of
Canada's rapidly growing wastepaper demand by 1993.
   The association, which represents most Canadian pulp and
paper producers, said that last year, imports from the U.S.
met about 30% of Canada's wastepaper needs.

   The trade group said Canadian demand for old newspapers
will grow rapidly because by the end of 1992 at least 12
Canadian newsprint mills will be supplying newsprint with
de-inked wastepaper.
   The association estimated that Canadian demand for old
newspapers and magazines will rise 47% to 1,340,000 metric
tons in 1993 from 235,000 tons in 1990. It estimated that
newsprint mills will have to import about 800,000 tons of
used newsprint from the U.S. in 1993 because waste collection
systems aren't as well established in Canada as in the U.S.
and because Canada is a much smaller consumer of newsprint.
