   Canadian production of market pulp rose 5% in July, as output again exceeded the industry's officially rated capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 676,000 metric tons of market pulp, compared with 644,000 tons in July 1986. 
In the first seven months of this year, market pulp production was up 10% from 1986 levels. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The association said the industry produced at 110% of its rated capacity in July, compared with 104% in June and 106% in July 1986. 
When demand for market pulp is good, some producers reduce their output of paper and sell pulp used to make that paper on the open market, according to association officials. 

   Shipments in July declined 4.1% to 579,000 metric tons from 604,000 tons from a year earlier, with exports to western Europe declining 23% and shipments to the U.S. rising 13%. 

   Canadian producer inventories totaled 396,000 metric tons at the end of July, representing a 20-day supply, up 32% from 299,000 tons of the end of June, or a 15-day supply, but off less than 1% from 399,000 tons at the end of July 1986, which represented a 21-day supply. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
