   Canadian production of market pulp rose 0.7% last month from a year earlier as the industry operated at 109% of its nominal capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 680,000 metric tons of market pulp in July, compared with 675,000 in July 1987. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to makers of paper and paper products. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   Last month's 109% operating rate compared with a rate of 101% in June and 108% a year earlier. 
When demand for market pulp is high, an industry association official said, some producers cut back their output of paper and sell the pulp in the open market, raising pulp output beyond their official capacity. 

   For the first seven months of the year, output was 4,265,000 metric tons, almost unchanged from 4,277,000 a year earlier. 
A metric ton is 2,204.6 pounds. 

   Shipments in July rose 8.3% to 628,000 metric tons from 580,000. 

   Canadian producer inventories at the end of July rose 18% to 340,000 metric tons, representing a 17-day supply, from 289,000 tons at the end of June, a 14-day supply. 
The July inventory figure was off 15% from 400,000 tons at the end of July 1987, which represented a 20-day supply.
