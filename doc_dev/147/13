   Canadian production of market pulp dropped 6.3% in June from a year earlier as the industry operated at 95% of capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 583,000 metric tons of market pulp in June, compared with 622,000 metric tons in June 1988. 
A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary and other products. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The June operating rate compared with 94% in May and 102% a year earlier. 

   In the first six months of this year, output was almost unchanged at 3,572,000 metric tons, compared with 3,578,000 metric tons a year earlier. 

   Total shipments in June were 627,000 metric tons, up from 624,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
Shipments to Europe rose while shipments to other markets fell. 

   Producer inventories at the end of June were 266,000 metric tons, a 13-day supply, down from 310,000 metric tons, a 16-day supply, at the end of May. 
Producer inventories at the end of June 1988 were 287,000 metric tons, a 14-day supply.
