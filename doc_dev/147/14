   Canadian production of market pulp rose 8.9% in June from a year earlier, and output exceeded the industry's officially rated capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 614,000 metric tons of market pulp in June, compared with 562,000 tons in June 1986. 
In the first six months of this year, market pulp production was up 11% from 1986 levels. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The association said that the industry produced at 103% of its rated capacity in June, compared with 92% in May and 96% a year earlier. 
When demand for market pulp is good, some producers reduce their output of paper and sell pulp used to make that paper on the open market, according to association officials. 

   Shipments in June increased 16% to 698,000 metric tons from 603,000 tons with exports to Western Europe rising 29% and shipments to the U.S. up 8%. 

   Canadian producer inventories were 299,000 metric tons at the end of June, representing a 15-day supply, off 22% from 383,000 tons at the end of May, or a 19-day supply, and off 17% from 359,000 tons at the end of June 1986, also a 19-day supply.
