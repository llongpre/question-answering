   Canadian production of market pulp jumped 14% in November from a year earlier as mills operated at 100% of capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 602,000 metric tons of market pulp last month, compared with 526,000 metric tons in November 1986, when the industry operated at 90% of capacity. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   Total shipments in November rose 21% to 601,000 metric tons from 498,000 metric tons a year earlier, reflecting sharply higher shipments to export customers, particularly in Western Europe. 

   Canadian producer inventories rose marginally to 354,000 metric tons at the end of November, representing an 18-day supply, from 353,000 tons at the end of October, also an 18-day supply. 
The November inventory figure was off 8.1% from 385,000 metric tons at the end of November 1986, which represented a 21-day supply.
