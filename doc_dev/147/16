   Canadian production of market pulp rose 3% in August from a year earlier, as the industry operated at 105% of capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 655,000 metric tons of market pulp in August, compared with 634,000 tons in August 1987. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary and other products. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The 105% operating rate for August compared with a rate of 109% in July and 102% in August 1987. 
The association said the industry's operating rate can exceed 100% in any month but not for a whole year. 

   In the first eight months of this year, output rose 0.2% to 4,921,000 metric tons from 4,911,000 tons a year earlier. 

   Total shipments in August of 616,000 metric tons were unchanged from a year earlier. 

   Canadian producer inventories at the end of August rose 11% to 381,000 metric tons, representing an 18-day supply, from 342,000 tons at the end of July, a 17-day supply. 
The August inventory figure was off 8.9% from 418,000 tons at the end of August 1987, which represented a 20-day supply.
