   Canadian production of market pulp in February declined 1.7% from a year earlier, as mills operated at 98% of capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 575,000 metric tons of market pulp last month, compared with 585,000 metric tons in February 1987. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   For the first two months of this year, output rose 1% to 1,205,000 metric tons from the year-earlier 1,193,000 metric tons. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. 

   Total shipments in February rose 3.9% to 562,000 metric tons from 541,000 metric tons a year earlier, reflecting higher exports to the U.S., Western Europe, Japan and other markets. 

   Canadian producer inventories totaled 347,000 metric tons at the end of February, representing a 17-day supply and a 3.9% increase from 334,000 metric tons at the end of January, or a 16-day supply. 
The February inventory total was off 16% from 411,000 metric tons at the end of February 1987, which represented a 21-day supply.
