   Canadian production of market pulp in March rose 3.6% from a year earlier as output exceeded the industry's officially rated capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 638,000 metric tons of market pulp in March, compared with 616,000 in March 1987. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and other items. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The association said the industry produced at 102% of its capacity in March, compared with 98% a month earlier and 99% a year earlier. 
When demand for market pulp is strong, some producers reduce their output of paper and sell pulp used to make that paper on the open market, thereby increasing market-pulp output beyond official capacity levels. 

   In the first three months of this year, output was up 1.9% to 1,844,000 metric tons from 1,809,000 a year earlier. 

   Shipments in March declined 6.5% to 673,000 metric tons from 720,000, reflecting reduced exports to Western Europe and other overseas markets except Japan. 
Exports to the U.S. were up 5%. 

   Canadian producer inventories fell 10% to 313,000 metric tons at the end of March, representing a 15-day supply, from 348,000 at the end of February, or a 17-day supply. 
The March inventory figure was up 2% from 307,000 metric tons at the end of March 1987, which also represented a 15-day supply.
