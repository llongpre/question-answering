   Canadian mills produced 476,000 metric tons of market pulp
in December, compared with 561,000 metric tons a year
earlier. The December 75% operating rate was down from a
revised 78% in November and down from 89% a year earlier.

producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The

metric tons from 625,000 metric tons a year earlier. Market
shipments for the year fell 13% to 6.1 million metric tons
from seven million metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to
all markets declined in December and in 1990 compared with
the year-earlier periods.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of December were
541,000 metric tons, a 31-day supply, compared with 582,000
metric tons, a 33-day supply, at the end of November.
Producer inventories at the end of December 1989 were 359,000
