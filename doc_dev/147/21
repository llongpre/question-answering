   Canadian producers of market pulp resumed their high production rate in October after a temporary drop in September, when many mills suspended output temporarily for routine maintenance. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 601,000 metric tons of market pulp last month, off 1% from 607,000 metric tons a year earlier but 16% ahead of the 517,000 metric tons produced in September. 

   And after running at full capacity for most of this year, the operating rate fell to 86% in September. 
An industry official blamed the decline in the operating rate to the decision by several producers to halt production temporarily at Labor Day for maintenance that had been delayed earlier in the year. 

   The operating rate in October was 97%, compared with 100% a year earlier. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   Total shipments in October fell 4.2% to 571,000 metric tons from 596,000 metric tons a year earlier, reflecting lower shipments to export customers, particularly in Western Europe. 

   Canadian producer inventories rose 9.3% to 353,000 metric tons at the end of October, representing an 18-day supply, from 323,000 metric tons at the end of September, or a 16-day supply. 
The October inventory figure was off 1.1% from 357,000 metric tons at the end of October 1986, which represented a 19-day supply. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.
