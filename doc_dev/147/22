   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 639,000 metric tons of market pulp in August, compared with 657,000 metric tons a year earlier.

   In the first eight months of this year output was 4,843,000 metric tons compared with 4,914,000 metric tons a year earlier. 

   Total market shipments in August were 617,000 metric tons, unchanged from a year earlier. 
Shipments to Canada and the U.S. were down, while shipments to other markets were up. 

   Canadian producer inventories at the end of August were 406,000 metric tons, a 21-day supply, compared with 384,000 metric tons, a 20-day supply, at the end of July. 
Producer inventories at the end of August 1988 were 378,000 metric tons, an 18-day supply.
