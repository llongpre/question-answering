   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp rose 6% in
April from a year earlier as the industry operated at 78% of
capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 509,000 metric tons of
market pulp in April, compared with 479,000 metric tons a
year earlier. The 78% operating rate for April was down from
91% in March, but unchanged from a year earlier.

   For the first four months of the year, production rose 3%
to 2,263,000 metric tons from 2,202,000 metric tons a year
earlier. Canadian mills operated at 87% of capacity in the

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper, sanitary and other products. The

shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing
mill. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   Total market shipments in April rose 6% to 514,000 metric
tons from 486,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to
the U.S. fell 15% to 159,000 metric tons, shipments to Europe
were flat at 151,000 metric tons, and shipments to Japan
jumped 48% to 74,000 metric tons.
   For the first four months of the year, total market
shipments rose 6% to 2,153,000 metric tons from 2,040,000
metric tons a year earlier.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of April were
650,000 metric tons, a 35-day supply, compared with 521,000
metric tons, a 29-day supply, a year earlier.
