   Canadian production of market pulp declined 6.8% last month from a year ago as the industry operated at 92% of capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 561,000 metric tons of market pulp in April, compared with 602,000 metric tons in April 1987. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary and other products. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   An association official said the drop in output is likely due to temporary production halts for maintenance that coincided with Easter and a strike at Domtar Inc.'s pulp mill at Lebel-sur-Quevillon, Quebec. 

   Last month's 92% operating rate compared with a rate at 102% of capacity in March and 100% a year ago. 

   For the first four months of this year, output was off slightly at 2,409,000 metric tons from 2,411,000 metric tons for the first four months of 1987. 

   Total April shipments were unchanged at 549,000 metric tons. 

   Canadian producer inventories at the end of April rose 3.8% to 325,000 metric tons, representing a 16-day supply, from 313,000 metric tons at the end of March, representing a 15-day supply. 
The April inventory figure was off 9.7% from 360,000 metric tons at the end of April 1987, which represented a 17-day supply.
