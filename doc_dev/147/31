July from a year earlier.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry

   For the first seven months of the year, production rose 4%
to 3,957,000 metric tons from 3,820,000 metric tons a year
earlier. Mills operated at 86% of capacity in the period,
compared with 88% a year earlier.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper and other products. The statistics exclude
pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another
mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. A metric ton
equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   Total market shipments in July rose 15% to 507,000 metric
tons from 441,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to
the U.S. were flat at 161,000 metric tons. Shipments to
Western Europe rose 7% to 146,000 metric tons, shipments to
Japan rose 19% to 56,000 metric tons, and shipments to other
markets rose more than 100% to 93,000 metric tons.
   For the first seven months, total market shipments rose 8%
to 3,750,000 metric tons from 3,479,000 metric tons.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of July were
746,000 metric tons, a 42-day supply, compared with 686,000
metric tons, a 39-day supply, a year earlier.
