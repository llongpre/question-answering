   The 74% operating rate in November was down from 81% in
October and from 94% a year earlier.
   For the first 11 months, Canadian mills produced 5,715,000
metric tons of market pulp, down 12% from 6,528,000 tons a
year earlier. The industry operated at 82% of capacity in the

tons, a 37-day supply, at the end of October, and 423,000
