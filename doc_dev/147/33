   For the first eight months, production rose 6% to
4,560,000 metric tons from 4,312,000 metric tons a year
earlier. Canadian mills operated at 87% of capacity in the
first eight months, unchanged from a year earlier.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper and other products. The statistics exclude
pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another
mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. A metric ton
equals about 2,204.62 pounds.
   Total market shipments in August rose 6% to 525,000 metric
tons from 494,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to
the U.S. rose 3% to 168,000 metric tons. Shipments to Western
Europe increased 6% to 162,000 metric tons while shipments to
Japan were flat at 64,000 metric tons.
   For the first eight months, total market shipments rose
nearly 8% to 4,275,000 metric tons from 3,974,000 metric tons
a year earlier.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of August were
824,000 metric tons, a 47-day supply, compared with 698,000
metric tons, a 44-day supply, a year earlier.
