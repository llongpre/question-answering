metric tons from 6,234,000 metric tons in 1990. Canadian
mills operated at 84% of capacity in 1991, unchanged from

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper and other products. The statistics exclude
pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another
mill that's affiliated with the producing mill. A metric ton
equals about 2,204.62 pounds.

metric tons from 517,000 metric tons a year earlier.
Shipments to the U.S. rose 29% to 195,000 metric tons.

   Canadian producer inventories at the end of December were
428,000 metric tons, a 20-day supply, compared with 581,000
metric tons, a 29-day supply, at the end of November.
