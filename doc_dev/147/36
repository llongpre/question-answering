   MONTREAL -- Canadian production of market pulp rose 16% in
June from a year earlier as the industry operated at 89% of
capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 580,000 metric tons of
market pulp in June, compared with 500,000 metric tons a year
earlier. The June 89% operating rate was up from 84% in May
and from 82% a year earlier.

   For the first six months, production rose 5% to 3,409,000
metric tons from 3,252,000 metric tons a year earlier.
Canadian mills operated at 87% of capacity in the first six
months compared with 88% a year earlier.
   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to
producers of paper and other products. The statistics exclude
pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another
mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. A metric ton
equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   Total market shipments in June rose 11% to 567,000 metric
tons from 510,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to
the U.S. fell 13% to 158,000 metric tons. Shipments to
Western Europe rose 5% to 176,000 metric tons, shipments to
Japan rose 8% to 69,000 metric tons, and shipments to other
markets rose 153% to 114,000 metric tons. An association
official said the sharp jump in shipments to "other markets"
was due largely to increased sales to China and South Korea.
   For the first six months, total market shipments rose 7%
to 3,250,000 metric tons from 3,039,000 metric tons a year
earlier.
   Canadian producer inventories at the end of June were
699,000 metric tons, a 39-day supply, compared with 650,000
metric tons, a 35-day supply, a year earlier.
