   Canadian production of market pulp last month dipped 1.8% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at 88% of capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 553,000 metric tons of market pulp in May, compared with 563,000 metric tons in May 1987. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary and other products. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   Last month's 88% operating rate compared with a rate of 93% in April and 90% in May 1987. 

   For the first five months of this year, output was off less than 1%, at 2,965,000 metric tons, compared with 2,974,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. 

   Total shipments in May rose 7.7% to 588,000 metric tons from 546,000 metric tons a year earlier. 

   Canadian producer inventories at the end of May fell 11% to 293,000 metric tons, representing a 14-day supply, from 328,000 metric tons at the end of April, or a 16-day supply. 
The May inventory figure was off 22% from 377,000 metric tons at the end of May 1987, which represented a 19-day supply.
