   Canadian output of market pulp soared 20% in January from year-ago levels as exports to the U.S. and Japan rose sharply. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian mills produced 613,000 metric tons of market pulp in January compared with 510,000 tons in January 1986. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed in the producing mill or shipped to another mill affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's leading producer of market pulp. 

   The Canadian industry produced at 99% of its capacity in January, compared with 85% in January 1986. 

   Total shipments in January were 549,000 tons, up 17% from 471,000 tons a year ago. 
Exports to the U.S. rose 14% to 193,000 tons from 170,000 while exports to Japan jumped 50% to 63,000 tons from 42,000. 

   Canadian producer inventories at the end of January were 367,000 tons, or a 20-day supply. 
This was up 21% from 303,000 tons at the end of December, which represented a 16-day supply, but off 29% from 515,000 tons, or 31 days' supply, at the end of January 1986.
