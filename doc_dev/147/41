   Canadian production of market pulp fell in September to the lowest monthly level in a year, as many mills suspended output for routine maintenance. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said production was 516,000 metric tons in September, 10% higher than the 468,000 produced in September 1986 but 19% below the 634,000 produced in August. 
A metric ton is 2,204.62 pounds. 

   The mills' operating rate fell to 86% in September after being near 100% for most of the first eight months of the year. 
An industry official cited a decision by several producers to suspend production around Labor Day for maintenance that had been postponed earlier in the year. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp that is sold on the open market to makers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp that is consumed at the producing mill or shipped to a mill affiliated with the producer. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   Shipments in September rose 17% to 611,000 tons from 521,000 a year earlier, reflecting increased shipments to major markets such as the U.S., Western Europe and Japan. 

   The higher shipments and lower production resulted in a 23% drop in producer inventories to 323,000 tons at the end of September, or a 16-day supply, from 418,000 tons at the end of August, or a 20-day supply. 
The September inventory figure was down 7.1% from a year earlier.
