   Canada's newsprint mills continued to operate at near-capacity levels in November as newsprint output rose 4.6% from a year earlier. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, reported that Canadian mills operated at 97% of capacity for the second consecutive month. 
That compares with 93% of capacity in November 1985. 

   Production in November was 782,000 metric tons, compared with 747,000 in November 1985, but total shipments declined 2.2% to 743,000 metric tons from 760,000. 

   Exports to the U.S., Canada's biggest newsprint customer, were off 7.8% to 529,000 metric tons in November from 574,000 in the like month in 1985. 
However, domestic shipments rose 12% and exports to other markets were up 19%. 

   Production in the first 11 months of 1986 was up 2.6% from the similar period in 1985, while shipments were 3.3% ahead, the association reported. 

   U.S. consumer newsprint inventories were 1,263,000 metric tons at the end of November, representing a 39-day supply, off 9.4% from a revised total of 1,394,000 metric tons at the end of October, which also represented a 39-day supply. 
The end-of-November inventories were also off 13% from 1,448,000 metric tons at the end of November 1985, when stocks represented a 46-day supply. 

   Newsprint supplies are affected by seasonal factors.
