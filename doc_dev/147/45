   Canada's pulp and paper industry expects output to reach record levels in 1987, and its mills to operate at the highest capacity in almost a decade. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said in its annual forecast that total shipments of pulp and paper are expected to rise 5% this year to 24.3 million metric tons from last year's 23.2 million, which was a 7% increase from 1985. 
The group expects the industry to operate at 98% capacity this year, compared with 94% last year and 90% in 1985. 

   Analysts said that strong demand and the near absence of new production capacity are likely to lead to price increases, particularly for newsprint and wood pulp. 
The price rises also could lead to a series of tough labor negotiations involving 30,000 paper workers in eastern Canada whose contracts expire April 30. 

   "This is the best situation the Canadian producers have had since 1978," said Brian Topp, an analyst at Capital Group Securities Ltd., Toronto. 

   Mr. Topp said he expects U.S. newsprint prices to rise about $30, or 5.3%, from the current level of $570 a metric ton, as early as May 1. 
Other analysts said they felt the price won't rise until later this year. 
U.S. newsprint prices went up 6.5% Oct. 1, the first such increase in 2 1/2 years. 

   "The psychology has changed," said Oscar Stangeland, president and chief operating officer of Montreal-based Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., a big newsprint supplier. 
"It is recognized that we are in a more shortage-prone period." 

   "It would seem as if a 1987 (price) increase is appropriate," said Mr. Stangeland, although he wouldn't elaborate on the timing and size of such a price boost. 

   But clouding the picture for the paper industry in eastern Canada are talks that are set to begin in March on a new labor agreement for 30,000 unionized employees at over 20 paper companies. 

   James Buchanan, president of the Canadian Paperworkers Union, said delegates to a convention here this week have set demands for a wage increase at 7.1% in the first year and 8% in the second year of the union's next two-year pact. 
The current average wage rate is $14.10 (Canadian) an hour, he said. 

   Mr. Buchanan said the workers' current contract has lost ground to increases in the cost of living, and "we're anticipating catching up." 
He said the union also wants improved pensions, a shorter work week and better job security. 

   But Consolidated-Bathurst's Mr. Stangeland termed the wage demands as "exaggerated" when compared with recent settlements at forest products producers in the U.S. and British Columbia. 
"One doesn't see how and why 7% and 8% would be appropriate." 

   According to the pulp and paper association, Canada's newsprint shipments are expected to grow 6.5% this year to 9.9 million metric tons, after rising an estimated 3% last year. 
Most of this year's growth is expected to come in the U.S. market, which depends on Canada for over half of its newsprint supplies. 

   Offshore exports of newsprint, which surged 15% in 1986, are expected to continue growing this year because of last year's decline in the value of the Canadian dollar in relation to European currencies. 

   If the forecasts are accurate, Canada's newsprint portion of the industry will operate at 99% capacity this year, compared with 94% in 1986. 

   Raymond Kilroy, an analyst with Nesbitt Thomson Deacon Inc., Toronto, said the forecast for a 99% operating rate may be overly optimistic, but "if you have an operating rate of 95% to 96%, it's a seller's market." 
He also expects pulp prices, which have gone up four times in the past year, to continue rising.
