   Canadian newsprint production dropped 3.3% in July from year-ago levels, as strikes during the latest month disrupted production at several paper mills in eastern Canada. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, Canadian mills produced 791,000 metric tons of newsprint in July, compared with 818,000 tons a year earlier. 
A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds. 

   As previously reported, strikes lasting between a few days and several weeks halted output in July at newsprint mills operated by Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., Donohue Inc., and the CIP Inc. unit of Canadian Pacific Ltd. 
All of the strikes have since been settled with the signing of new labor agreements. 

   The Canadian industry operated at 92% of its rated capacity in July, down from 97% in June and 96% in July 1986. 

   Shipments increased 2.8% to 779,000 metric tons in July from 758,000 tons a year earlier. 
Exports to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint customer, totaled 576,000 metric tons, 3.2% ahead of the 558,000 tons shipped a year earlier. 

   Total U.S. consumption of newsprint rose 5.7% to 984,000 metric tons in July from 931,000 tons a year ago. 
In the first seven months of this year, U.S. newsprint consumption is 2.5% ahead of 1986 levels. 

   U.S. consumer inventories of newsprint totaled 1,461,000 metric tons at the end of July, representing a 43-day supply, up 3.8% from 1,407,000 tons at the end of June, or a 44-day supply, and up 3.6% from 1,410,000 tons at the end of July 1986, or a 43-day supply.
