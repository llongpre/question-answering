   MONTREAL -- Canadian newsprint production fell 0.6% in
October from a year earlier as the industry operated at 79%
of capacity.
   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry
group, said Canadian mills produced 706,000 metric tons of
newsprint in October compared with 711,000 metric tons a year
earlier. The October 79% operating rate was down from 85% in
September and up from 78% a year ago.

   Though production fell slightly, the operating rate was
higher in October compared with a year earlier because
available newsprint capacity was slightly lower than a year
earlier. Some paper machines that ordinarily make newsprint
were used to make other grades of paper in October and
therefore weren't included in available capacity.
   October shipments rose 3.6% to 735,000 metric tons from
710,000 metric tons a year earlier. Shipments to the U.S.
fell 4.9% to 488,000 metric tons from 513,000 metric tons a
year earlier. A metric ton equals 2,204.62 pounds.
   For the first 10 months, Canadian newsprint production
fell 2.1% to 7,523,000 metric tons from 7,688,000 metric tons
a year earlier. Canadian mills operated at 87% of capacity in
the first 10 months compared with 90% a year earlier.
Shipments for the first 10 months fell 5.4% to 7,232,000
metric tons from 7,647,000 metric tons a year ago.
   The association said U.S. consumer stocks at the end of
October were 1,324,000 metric tons, a 40-day supply, compared
with 1,269,000 metric tons, a 37-day supply, a year earlier.
Canadian mills' stocks at the end of October were 606,000
metric tons compared with 363,000 metric tons a year earlier.
