   Canadian production of market pulp rose 8.4% in August from a year earlier as output again exceeded the industry's officially rated capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 634,000 metric tons of market pulp in August, compared with 585,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
In the first eight months of this year, market pulp production increased 10% from a year earlier. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The association said that the industry produced at 103% of its rated capacity in August, compared with 109% in July and 96% a year earlier. 
When demand for market pulp is good, some producers reduce their output of paper and sell pulp used to make that paper on the open market and thereby increase market pulp production beyond the industry's official capacity, according to association officials. 

   Total shipments in August rose 5.3% to 616,000 metric tons from 585,000 metric tons a year earlier. 

   Canadian producer inventories were 418,000 metric tons at the end of August, representing a 20-day supply, up 4.5% from 400,000 metric tons at the end of July, or a 20-day supply, and up 4.8% from 399,000 metric tons at the end of August 1986, which also represented a 20-day supply.
