   MONTREAL -- The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association said
it expects 1991 pulp and paper shipments to rise 1.9% to
24.62 million metric tons from 24.15 million metric tons a
year earlier.
   The industry group said that according to preliminary
figures, Canadian pulp and paper shipments last year declined
about 2.9%, or 715,000 metric tons, from 1989 levels. A
metric ton equals about 2,204.6 pounds.

   The association said its forecast is based on the
expectation that the North American economy will start to
grow and inflationary pressures will decrease during the
second half. It said pulp and paper markets should begin to
improve by this summer and Canadian pulp and paper production
should rise slightly over 1990.
   The association said the ratio of industry shipments to
rated production capacity was 87% in 1990 compared with 93%
in 1989. It said industry capacity is expected to rise 1.6
million metric tons, or 6%, to 28.7 million metric tons in
1991. As a result, the ratio of shipments to rated capacity
is expected to fall three points to 84% in 1991.
   The association made the following forecasts for Canadian
shipments of pulp and paper products, compared with
preliminary estimates for 1990. All figures are in metric
tons:

shipments include exports only because pulp shipped to
Canadian customers is used to make paper products.
