   Canadian newsprint production rose 2.4% in October from a year earlier, as mills continued to produce at close to full capacity. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, Canadian mills produced 827,000 metric tons of newsprint in October, compared with the year-earlier 808,000 metric tons. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. 

   The Canadian industry operated at 97% of its rated capacity in October, compared with 96% in September and 97% in October 1986. 

   Total shipments in October declined less than 1% to 811,000 metric tons from 816,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
Exports to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint customer, were 593,000 metric tons, off marginally from 594,000 metric tons shipped a year earlier. 

   Total U.S. consumption of newsprint in October rose 3.3% to 1,124,000 metric tons from 1,088,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
In the first 10 months of this year, U.S. newsprint consumption is 2.9% ahead of year-ago levels. 

   U.S. consumer inventories of newsprint at the end of October were 1,442,000 metric tons, representing a 39-day supply, down 4.4% from 1,508,000 metric tons at the end of September, representing a 41-day supply, but up 3.6% from 1,392,000 metric tons at the end of October 1986, when stocks represented a 40-day supply. 
Newsprint consumption fluctuates according to seasonal factors.
