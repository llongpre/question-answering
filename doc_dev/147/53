   MONTREAL - Canadian newsprint production rose 4.7% in June from year-earlier levels as the industry operated at close to its rated capacity. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, Canadian mills produced 806,000 metric tons of newsprint in June, compared with 770,000 tons a year earlier. 
In the first half of this year, output rose 5.8% from the 1986 period. 

   The Canadian industry operated at 97% of its capacity in June, compared with 97% in May and 94% in June 1986. 

   Shipments in June increased 6.3% to 857,000 metric tons from 806,000 tons a year earlier. 
Exports to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint customer, were 620,000 metric tons, 9% ahead of the 569,000 tons shipped a year earlier, as U.S. publishers attempted to beat a 7% price increase that came into effect July 1. 

   Total U.S. consumption of newsprint was flat at 1,001,000 metric tons in June, compared with 996,000 tons a year earlier. 
In the first six months, U.S. newsprint consumption was ahead of 1986 levels 2.1%. 

   U.S. consumer inventories of newsprint were up 5.3% to 1,392,000 metric tons at the end of June, representing a 44-day supply, from 1,322,000 tons at the end of May, or a 40-day supply, and up 1.9% from 1,366,000 tons at the end of June 1986, or a 45-day supply.
