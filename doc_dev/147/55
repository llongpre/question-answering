   Abitibi-Price Inc., the world's largest newsprint producer, informed its major customers of a 6.9% increase in newsprint prices, effective Jan. 1. 

   The increase, the first in 12 months, would bring the price of 30-pound newsprint to $695 a metric ton, up from $650 currently. 

   But some newspapers currently have large inventories of newsprint, and they said demand may not be strong enough for the price increase to have much effect early next year. 

   "We're carrying 60 days' inventory" of newsprint, said Homer Taylor, Knight-Ridder Inc. vice president, supply. 
He said that unless retail advertising is strong during the Christmas season, he didn't think such a "severe" price increase would hold as early as January. 
He said the size of the increase "is more objectionable than the timing." 

   A price increase is unwelcome in the newspaper industry, where financial results are sagging in part because of soaring newsprint prices. 
Newsprint consumes 25%-40% of newspaper operating budgets, second only to labor expense. 
Since October 1986, newsprint suppliers have increased prices three times by a total of 20%. 
Another price increase was expected at mid-year but didn't materialize. 

   Demand had begun to level off as newspapers began to print on lighter-weight paper, trim sizes of pages and reduce the space for news. 
At the same time, weak retail advertising trends meant newspapers have been printing thinner papers. 
In recent months, some newspaper executives had predicted a price increase wouldn't come until next year at the earliest. 
They said some suppliers were offering bigger discounts if the papers locked themselves into longer-term contracts. 

   Phillip Williams, vice-chairman of Times Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times and Newsday, among other newspapers, wouldn't predict whether the price increase would stick, because he said it would depend on market conditions more than three months from now. 
He said the company's inventories "aren't excessive." 

   According to the American Newspaper Publishers Association, newsprint inventories in the association's sample survey averaged a total of 49 days' supply in July, compared with 45 days a year earlier. 

   Toronto-based Abitibi-Price's move wasn't followed immediately by other major newsprint producers. 
Spokesmen for Canada's next largest producers, Canadian Pacific Ltd.'s 79.7%-owned CP Forest Products unit and Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Jaak Puusepp, forest products analyst with Pemberton Securities Inc., Vancouver, British Columbia, said Canadian newsprint mills, which operated at 96% of capacity in July, "should have been able to get a price increase sooner." 
But he said that because of new capacity coming onstream next year in North America, Canadian mills have been reluctant to push price increases on U.S. newsprint customers, who might turn to new producers for some supplies. 

   Mr. Puusepp said Canadian mills expect to boost production capacity by roughly 300,000 metric tons, or 2.9%, by the end of next year, and by two million tons, or 20%, by 1991. 
He said he had been forecasting a $35-a-ton price increase Jan. 1, "but I don't foresee any further price increases until 1992" because of the new production coming onstream. 

   Newsprint consumption is expected to increase during the fourth quarter because of thicker issues because of coverage of the presidential election and the Olympics, as well as usual Christmas season advertising. 

   For the first seven months of 1988, U.S. newsprint consumption edged up 1.7% from the year earlier, according to the newspaper publishers' association. 
In the same period, Canadian newsprint output rose 3.4% from a year earlier, while shipments increased only 0.9%, according to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association.
