   Canadian newsprint production increased 5.9% in August from a year earlier as the industry operated close to full capacity. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, the nation's mills produced 826,000 metric tons of newsprint in August, up from 780,000 tons a year earlier. 

   The Canadian industry operated at 98% of its rated capacity in August compared with 92% in July, when strikes disrupted production in some eastern Canadian newsprint mills. 
The industry ran at 93% of capacity in August 1986. 

   Total shipments edged down less than 1% to 785,000 metric tons in August from 790,000 metric tons in the year-earlier month. 
Exports to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint customer, were 568,000 metric tons, off less than 1% from the 572,000 tons shipped a year earlier. 

   Total U.S. consumption of newsprint rose 2.6% to 1,023,000 metric tons in August from 997,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
In the first eight months of this year, U.S. newsprint consumption is 2.3% ahead of year-earlier levels. 

   U.S. consumer inventories of newsprint were 1,475,000 metric tons at the end of August, representing a 42-day supply, flat with the 1,472,000 metric tons at the end of July, representing a 44-day supply. 
The August figure is up 2.6%, however, from 1,438,000 metric tons at the end of August 1986, representing a 43-day supply. 
Newsprint consumption fluctuates according to seasonal factors.
