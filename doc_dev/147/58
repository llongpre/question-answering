   Canadian newsprint output rose 5.6% in May from a year ago, despite a small increase in shipments to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint customer. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, 860,000 metric tons of newsprint were produced in May compared with 816,000 metric tons in May 1987. 

   Canadian newsprint mills operated at 100% of capacity in May, compared with 97% a year ago and 99% of capacity in April. 

   Total shipments rose 5% to 856,000 metric tons from 815,000 metric tons a year ago. 
Exports to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint customer, were 591,000 metric tons, up less than 1% from 586,000 metric tons a year ago, the association said. 

   As previously reported, the American Newspaper Publishers Association estimated that U.S. newsprint consumption declined 1.7% in May from a year ago, marking the second consecutive month of consumption decline. 

   But the small increase in exports to the U.S. was compensated by a 13% growth in shipments to Canadian consumers and a 18% surge in exports to other markets, primarily Asia and Western Europe. 

   For the first five months of this year, Canadian newsprint output totaled 4,197,000 metric tons, 4.1% higher than the 4,031,000 metric tons produced in the same period last year while shipments rose 1% to 4,023,000 metric tons from 3,985,000 metric tons. 

   Inventories held by Canadian producers were 363,000 metric tons at the end of May, up 1.1% from 359,000 metric tons at the end of April and up 12% from 323,000 metric tons at the end of May 1987.
