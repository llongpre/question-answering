   Canadian newsprint output rose 3.8% in November from a year earlier, as exports to the U.S. surged 13%. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, Canadian mills produced 812,000 metric tons of newsprint in November, up from 782,000 metric tons a year earlier. 

   The Canadian industry operated at 99% of capacity in November, compared with 97% in October and 97% a year earlier. 

   Total shipments rose 7.8% to 801,000 metric tons in November from 743,000 metric tons in the year-earlier month. 
Exports to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint customer, increased to 597,000 metric tons from 529,000 metric tons a year earlier. 

   Total U.S. consumption of newsprint rose 4.6% to 1,128,000 metric tons from 1,078,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
In the first 11 months of 1987, U.S. newsprint consumption was 3.1% ahead of year-before levels. 

   U.S. consumer inventories of newsprint totaled 1,354,000 metric tons at the end of November, representing a 40-day supply. 
That level was 6.1% below 1,442,000 metric tons at the end of October, but up 7.4% from 1,261,000 metric tons at the end of November 1986. 
Both the October level and the 1986 November level represented 39-day supplies, due to the fluctuation of newsprint consumption according to seasonal factors.
