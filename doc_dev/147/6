   Canadian production of market pulp rose 4% in January from a year earlier, as mills operated at 100% of their capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 630,000 metric tons of market pulp in January, compared with 608,000 metric tons in January 1987, when the industry operated at 98% of capacity. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   Total shipments in January fell less than 1% to 542,000 metric tons from 544,000 metric tons a year earlier. 

   Canadian producer inventories rose 36% to 334,000 metric tons at the end of January, representing a 16-day supply, from 246,000 metric tons at the end of December, or a 12-day supply. 
The January inventory figure was off 9% from 367,000 metric tons at the end of January 1987, which represented a 20-day supply.
