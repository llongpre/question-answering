   Canadian newsprint output declined 0.9% in September from a year ago, while shipments to the U.S. dropped even more. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, 790,000 metric tons of newsprint were produced in September compared with 797,000 metric tons in September 1987. 

   Canadian newsprint mills operated at 96% of capacity in September, the same as a year earlier. 

   Total shipments declined 2.6% to 830,000 metric tons from 852,000 metric tons a year ago. 
Exports to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint customer, were down 3.4% to 610,000 metric tons from 631,000 a year ago, the association said. 

   The association said total U.S. newsprint consumption was 2.7% lower in September than a year ago. 

   John Hayes, manager of production planning at the Washington Post, said a leveling off in consumption means the company has "a little more leverage" in negotiating prices. 
He said one of the newspaper's seven newsprint suppliers already has offered a discount on its stated price, but he wouldn't say which one. 

   Jaak Puusepp, an analyst with Pemberton Securities in Vancouver, British Columbia, said the downturn in shipments and demand is probably short-term, the result of high inventories and two weak months of consumption in the U.S. 
He expects demand and shipment figures to increase in the next few months. 

   Shipments to Canadian consumers remained steady, as did those to other markets. 

   For the first nine months of 1988, Canadian newsprint output totaled 7,458,000 metric tons, 2.6% higher than the 7,261,000 metric tons produced a year before, while shipments rose 1.2% to 7,348,000 metric tons from 7,257,000 metric tons.
