   Canada's newsprint industry operated at close to full capacity in October, as production increased 4.9% from a year earlier. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, reported that Canadian newsprint mills operated at 97% of capacity in October, compared with 91% in September and 92% in October 1985. 
The Canadian industry last operated at 97% of capacity in February 1985. 

   Newsprint production totaled 808,000 metric tons in October, compared with 770,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
Total shipments rose 3.6% to 816,000 metric tons from 788,000 metric tons in October 1985. 

   Shipments to the U.S., Canada's biggest newsprint customer, rose less than 1% in October to 594,000 metric tons from 591,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
But shipments overseas rose 19% and shipments to Canadian users advanced 6.2%, the association said. 

   U.S. newsprint consumption totaled 1,064,000 metric tons in October, up 1.2% from 1,051,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
In the first 10 months of 1986, U.S. newsprint consumption rose 3.1%, compared with the same period in 1985. 

   U.S. consumer inventories at the end of October were 1,410,000 metric tons, or a 39-day supply, down 2.8% from 1,451,000 metric tons or 42 days at the end of September and off 6.4% from stocks of 1,506,000 metric tons or 44 days at the end of October 1985.
