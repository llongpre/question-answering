   Canadian newsprint output in July rose 4.6% from a year earlier, despite a small decline in shipments to the U.S., which is Canada's largest newsprint customer. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, 827,000 metric tons of newsprint were produced in July, compared with 791,000 metric tons in July 1987. 

   Canadian newsprint mills operated at 96% of capacity in July, compared with 92% a year earlier and 97% in June. 

   Total shipments rose 1.9% to 794,000 metric tons from 779,000 metric tons a year earlier. 
Exports to the U.S. totaled 574,000 metric tons, off less than 1% from 576,000 tons a year earlier, the association said. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. 

   As previously reported, the American Newspaper Publishers Association estimated that U.S. newsprint consumption in July rose 2.9% from a year earlier, following level consumption in June and declines in the previous two months. 

   Though exports to the U.S. declined slightly, this was offset by July shipments to Canadian customers, which surged 13.3%, and by exports to other markets, which increased 5.2%. 

   For the first seven months of this year, Canadian newsprint output rose 3.4% to 5,822,000 metric tons from 5,628,000 tons a year earlier, while shipments rose 0.9% to 5,668,000 metric tons from 5,620,000 tons. 

   Inventories held by Canadian producers totaled 343,000 metric tons at the end of July, up 10% from 311,000 tons at the end of June and up 20% from 286,000 tons at the end of July 1987.
