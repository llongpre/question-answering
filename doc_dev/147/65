   Canadian newsprint output rose 2.5% in August from a year ago, with increased shipments to all markets. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, 846,000 metric tons of newsprint were produced in August compared with 826,000 tons in August 1987. 

   Canadian newsprint mills operated at 100% of capacity in August, compared with 98% a year ago and 96% in July. 

   Total shipments were 847,000 metric tons, up 7.9% from 785,000 tons a year ago. 
Exports to the U.S. were 603,000 metric tons, up 6.2% from 568,000 tons a year ago, the association said. 

   As reported earlier, the American Newspaper Publishers Association estimated that U.S. newsprint consumption fell 4.5% in August from a year ago, partly because there was one less Sunday in August this year. 

   Canadian newsprint shipments rose 3.4% to Canadian customers and surged 19.2% to other markets. 

   For the first eight months of the year, Canadian newsprint output totaled 6,668,000 metric tons, up 3.3% from the 6,454,000 tons produced in the same period last year, while shipments rose 1.7% to 6,516,000 metric tons from 6,405,000 tons. 

   Inventories held by Canadian producers were 342,000 metric tons at the end of August, down 0.2% from 343,000 tons at the end of July and up 4.9% from 326,000 tons at the end of August 1987.
