   Canadian newsprint output climbed 6.5% in February from a year earlier, reflecting higher exports to the U.S., Canada's largest newsprint market. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, 815,000 metric tons of newsprint were produced in February compared with 765,000 tons in February 1987. 
There was an additional day in February this year due to the leap year. 

   Canadian newsprint mills operated at 100% of capacity in February compared with 99% of capacity both in January and in February of last year. 

   Total shipments rose 3.4% to 782,000 tons from 756,000 tons a year earlier. 
Exports to the U.S. rose to 575,000 tons from 541,000 tons, the association said. 

   For the first two months of this year, output totaled 1,636,000 tons, 4.9% ahead of 1,559,000 tons a year earlier. 
Shipments for the two months, however, were off slightly at 1,498,000 tons, down from 1,505,000 tons in the first two months of 1987. 
The decline in shipments was blamed on a 21% drop in exports to offshore markets. 

   Inventories held by Canadian producers totaled 328,000 tons at the end of February, up 11% from 295,000 tons at the end of January. 
Inventories were off 1% from 331,000 tons at the end of February 1987.
