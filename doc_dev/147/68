FT  02 AUG 94 / International Company News: Paper-makers feel the heat of a
wild fire - Pulp and paper prices in North America are soaring

This summer is turning out to be most unusual for North American pulp and
paper producers and their customers. Instead of the traditionally quiet
period when markets doze and prices drift, the industry is being swept by an
edginess normally reserved at this time of year for raging forest fires.
One segment of the paper market after another has caught alight. The upward
pressure on prices, which began late last year with wood pulp and packaging
materials such as linerboard and corrugated boxes, has gradually spread to
newsprint and coated papers.
Pulp prices have soared from a low of Dollars 390 a ton a year ago to
Dollars 620. Newsprint mills have successfully pushed through one 7 per cent
price increase, and are about to try another. Producers of uncoated
freesheet (otherwise known as plain white paper) earlier this month
announced their third - and biggest - price increase of the year.
Signs of panic have appeared in some markets. Some pulp and containerboard
suppliers have been forced to ration customers. Containerboard inventories
are close to their lowest level in eight years.
The most recent - and most dramatic - price jump has been for old cardboard
boxes and newspapers, which are required for the rising recycled content of
many grades of paper. Used newspapers fetch about Dollars 120 a ton on the
US east coast, up from Dollars 70 per ton in May.
While collectors of low-grade 'mixed paper' until recently paid recyclers up
to Dollars 20 a ton to take the stuff away, they can now sell this material
for Dollars 50 a ton or more.
Newsprint producers which depend heavily on recycled material, such as
Missouri-based Jefferson Smurfit, have found that the added cost of their
raw materials has virtually wiped out the price increases announced so far
this year.
A recovery in paper prices comes as no surprise given the rebound in the
North American economy.
Improved business conditions have pushed up newspaper and magazine
advertising lineage, as well as use of packaging materials and some business
paper grades. US daily newspapers' consumption of newsprint was 6.1 per cent
higher in June than a year earlier.
'The industry goes that way - from feast to famine,' says Mr Doug Young, a
US paper consultant.
But a number of special factors are also at work in this upswing. Paper
prices sank to their lowest levels in decades during the 1991-93 recession,
forcing several dozen mills to shut.
'Prices haven't been high enough to justify capacity expansions in many
cases,' says Mr John Maine, analyst with Resource Information Systems, a
Virginia consultancy. Canada's chemical pulp mills were operating full tilt
at 107 per cent of capacity last month, up from 89 per cent in May.
Furthermore, many customers are nervous that labour-contract talks under way
at British Columbia's pulp and paper mills will break down later this
summer, leading to a strike. Mr Wayne Mangels, director of market research
at Bowater's US subsidiary, says the newsprint market, which is roughly in
balance, would be deprived of about 35,000 tonnes of newsprint a week in the
event of a strike there.
The weak US and Canadian dollars, coupled with strong overseas demand, has
further tightened domestic markets by encouraging exports.
According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian mills shipped
364,700 tonnes of newsprint to Asian countries in the first five months of
1994, 29 per cent more than last year. Pulp exports to Japan surged by 46
per cent in the first half of the year.
Japan is also one of the countries whose appetite for wastepaper has helped
create the shortage in North America.
In spite of the price increases and supply shortages, few companies are
thinking of installing new capacity. 'Nobody has made enough money,' says Mr
Bruce Kirk, analyst at SG Warburg in New York. Most companies are expected
to wait until the recovery is on a more solid footing.
Several deals in the pipeline could provide a glimpse of the investment
outlook. The industry will take a close interest in the price Scott Paper is
able to negotiate for SD Warren, the world's largest maker of coated
free-sheet paper, which Scott has put up for sale.
A number of prospective buyers are also hovering around a newsprint mill at
Bear Island, Virginia.
On the other hand, investment in recycling plants is booming as
environmental laws require paper-makers to raise the recycled content of
their products.
According to the American Forest and Paper Association, US paper producers
have 56 new recycling projects on the drawing boards. The industry's
consumption of recovered paper has jumped by about a third in the past four
years to 29.2m tons in 1993.
The commissioning of so much recycling capacity raises fears, however, that
the present shortage of old paper will seem insignificant compared with the
scramble in a few years' time.
Bowater's Mr Mangel estimates that about 65 per cent of used papers will
need to be recovered within the next five years to meet demand, compared
with around 50 per cent now. 'It could become a disaster,' he says.
As a result, access to old newspapers, cardboard boxes and other wastepaper
has become one of the North American industry's most pressing commercial and
political concerns.
