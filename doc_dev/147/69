   Canadian newsprint production rose 3% in January as the industry continued to operate at close to full capacity. 

   According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, Canada's paper mills produced 795,000 metric tons of newsprint in January, up from 772,000 tons in the like month last year. 
A metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds. 

   The Canadian industry operated at 97% of capacity -- for the fourth consecutive month -- up from 94% in January 1986. 

   Total shipments were 750,000 tons, up 5.2% from 713,000 tons a year earlier. 
Exports to the U.S., Canada's biggest newsprint customer, were 554,000 tons, a rise of 5.9%. 

   Production by domestic U.S. newsprint producers also rose, by 5.9%, to 445,000 tons from 420,000 tons. 
The statistics also show that U.S. imports of newsprint from countries other than Canada fell 44% in January, to 25,000 tons from 45,000 tons. 
The drop had been expected because of the weakness of the U.S. dollar. 

   U.S. newsprint consumption in January was 927,000 tons, up 1% from 918,000 tons in the like month last year. 

   Consumer stocks in the U.S. at the end of January were 1,319,000 tons, equivalent to a 41-day supply, up 3.8% from 1,271,000 tons at the end of December, which also represented a 41-day supply. 
But stocks at the end of January were off 6.7% from 1,413,000 tons at the end of January 1986, when inventories were equivalent to 45 days. 
Newsprint consumption fluctuates seasonally.
