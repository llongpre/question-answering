   Canadian production of market pulp in April soared 19% from a year earlier, and output exceeded the industry's officially rated capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 602,000 metric tons of market pulp in April, compared with 507,000 metric tons in April 1986. 
In the first four months of this year, market pulp production rose 15% from the year-earlier level. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary products and container board. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   The association said the industry produced at 101% of its rated capacity in April, compared with 100% in March and 86% in April 1986. 
When demand for market pulp is high, some producers reduce their output of paper and sell pulp used to make that paper on the open market, according to an association official. 

   Shipments in April declined 1.8% to 549,000 metric tons from 559,000 metric tons a year earlier as exports to major markets, especially Japan, fell. 
Industry analysts blamed the drop in part on heavy shipments in March, as customers increased orders prior to an April 1 price increase. 

   Canadian producer inventories totaled 360,000 metric tons at the end of April, representing a 17-day supply, up 17% from 307,000 metric tons of the end of March, or a 15-day supply, but off 5.8% from 382,000 metric tons at the end of April 1986, which represented a 19-day supply.
