After almost four years in the doldrums, wood pulp prices are staging an
unexpectedly strong rebound.
Northern softwood bleached kraft pulp, the industry's benchmark product, is
changing hands in Europe and North America at the list price of USDollars
460 a tonne, compared with a deeply-discounted Dollars 390-400 at the start
of the year. And producers have announced another increase, to Dollars 510,
to take effect in March and April.
Mr Rodney Young, president of Resource Information Systems, a
Massachusetts-based research firm, said yesterday that some business was
already being done at that level as paper-makers and users scramble to
rebuild depleted inventories. 'The demand side is running really hot right
now,' Mr Young said.
Observers doubt, however, whether the recent surge can be sustained. Mr Jaap
van der Geest, analyst at ABN-Amro in Amsterdam, described the jump in
prices as a 'hiccup'. He noted that growth in paper consumption was slow,
and that wood pulp was increasingly being replaced by recycled material.
The upturn in prices began in the hardwood pulp market last December when
birch log supplies to Scandinavian mills were disrupted by transport
bottlenecks in Russia. Since then, demand has been fuelled by factors
including the economic upswing, fears of a summer strike by British Columbia
pulp-mill workers and a delay in the construction of large pulp mills in
Indonesia.
The tightening trend was exacerbated by the low level of producer
inventories following shutdowns at many mills during 1993. According to the
Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian pulp mills, which make up
about a quarter of total world supplies, had 26 days' supply on hand last
December, compared with 31 days' a year earlier.
However, the recent rush for supplies has encouraged many producers to bring
moth-balled capacity back into operation.
