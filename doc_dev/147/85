   Canfor Corp. said it plans to build a newsprint mill and expand pulp output in British Columbia through a 635 million Canadian dollar ($484.2 million) expansion project with Oji Paper Co., Tokyo. 

   The Vancouver, British Columbia-based forest products concern said the project involves an expansion of pulp production to 1,000 metric tons daily from 650 metric tons daily at a facility at Port Mellon, near Vancouver, by 1990. 
The newsprint mill, with capacity of 535 metric tons a day, is scheduled to begin production in 1991. 

   The newsprint production is expected to be marketed in Japan by Oji, one of the world's largest paper companies. 
The pulp will be marketed world-wide by Canfor. 
The expansion project will be undertaken by a new company called Howe Sound Pulp and Paper Co., which will be 50% owned by Canfor and 50% owned by Oji. 

   Canfor said it will transfer an existing 650 ton-a-day pulp mill at Port Mellon and a sawmill and chipping plant in Vancouver to Howe Sound for the 50% stake. 
Oji will provide 307.5 million dollars to Howe Sound for the remaining 50% interest. 

   Additional capital for the project will come from borrowings by Howe Sound, interest generated from Oji's cash infusion, and profits from existing pulp operation. 
Canfor said the expansion is subject to negotiations with the British Columbia provincial government over necessary wood supplies and for temporary discounts on electricity from a government utility.
