   Canadian production of market pulp in June slipped 2.4% from a year earlier, as the industry operated at 101% of capacity. 

   The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, an industry group, said Canadian mills produced 613,000 metric tons of market pulp in June, compared with 628,000 tons in June 1987. 

   Market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper, sanitary and other products. 
The statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill. 
Canada is the world's largest producer of market pulp. 

   June's 101% operating rate compared with a rate of 88% in May and 104% in June 1987. 
Capacity figures are based on what is sustainable over six months, and thus can exceed 100%. 

   In the first six months of this year, market pulp output was off less than 1% at 3,574,000 metric tons, compared with 3,602,000 tons in the 1987 first half. 
A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds. 

   Total shipments in June fell 11% to 621,000 metric tons from 700,000 tons a year earlier. 

   Canadian producer inventories at the end of June fell 2.8% to 281,000 metric tons, representing a 14-day supply, from 289,000 tons at the end of May, also a 14-day supply. 
The June inventory figure was off 7.9% from 305,000 metric tons, or a 15-day supply, at the end of June 1987.
