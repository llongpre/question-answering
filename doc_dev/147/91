THE BEST that can be said for the North American pulp and paper industry is
that signs are emerging of a patchy recovery.
But the emphasis is patchy. Price discounting and spare capacity are still
prevalent in many sectors. International Paper, the biggest US producer,
reported a 7 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings with the comment that
prices for uncoated papers remain under pressure. Georgia-Pacific, which
suffered a third-quarter loss, noted that much of the industry is still
burdened by high inventories and excess capacity. In mid-November, Mr
Sherman Chao, analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, cut his 1993 earnings
estimates for seven US forestry groups on evidence that weakening
Scandinavian currencies and the strong US dollar are intensifying
competition from European pulp.
'The burden of world over-capacity will be borne more by the US industry,'
Mr Chao says, adding that soft pulp prices could ripple through to weak
prices for a wide range of papers. Nonetheless, there are signs that the
worst of the recession is over. Although Mr Chao has cut his 1993 earnings
estimates, the revised figures still represent an improvement on this year's
expected performance. Another analyst, Mr Chip Dillon, of Salomon Brothers,
predicted in a recent report that prices of lumber, linerboard, pulp,
newsprint, uncoated and coated papers, and tissue should all recover during
1993, although in some cases, the upturn will be shallow. Producers of
lightweight coated papers lifted prices by 4 per cent on October 1, and
east-coast newsprint producers succeeded in pushing through a 5 per cent
price increase (or, to be more precise, a 5 per cent cut in list-price
discounts) on August 1. An official at Abitibi-Price, the Toronto-based
newsprint-maker, says that 'demand has been a little more sustained than we
originally thought.' Abitibi has cancelled much of the downtime which it
planned for its newsprint machines in the second half of this year.
Canadian pulp and paper makers, whose high costs have made them the heaviest
casualties of the recession, are also benefiting from a 13 per cent tumble
in the Canadian dollar against the US currency over the past year. British
Columbia's Council of Forest Industries predicts that Canadian west-coast
producers could, on aggregate, break even or show a small profit in 1993
after combined losses of almost CDollars 900m in 1991 and an estimated
CDollars 400-500m this year.
The cautiously upbeat mood is based on hopes of a recovery in the US economy
from 1993, and on the painful restructuring which has taken place within the
North American pulp and paper industry over the past three years. The
optimists' argument runs that, as a sector which is traditionally sensitive
to the business cycle, the paper industry could be among the early winners
of any economic stimulus administered by the new Clinton administration in
Washington.
Industry operating rates already exceed levels normally seen at the start of
an economic upswing. Linerboard mills, which produce the inner and outer
layers of a corrugated cardboard box, are operating at almost full capacity,
and are expected to push through a price increase before the end of the
winter.
Furthermore, little new capacity is likely to come on-stream in the early
stages of the recovery. According to Mr Dillon, of Salomon Brothers, the
American Paper Institute's (API) forecast of new capacity, due to be
published later this month, will point to an annual increase of only 1.2-1.4
per cent. This compares with the API's earlier forecasts of 1.8 per cent
annual expansion between 1991 and 1994, and an average of 2.8 per cent in
the three decades to 1990.
A recovery will be especially welcome to the newsprint industry, which has
seen some of the most wrenching changes of the past few years. Customers
have become more demanding, with the range of products expanding to include
soft-calendered, high-gloss and coloured newsprint, as well as a growing
quantity of paper made from recycled pulp.
According to the API, some 52 per cent of all newsprint is now recovered for
recycling in the US, up from 35 per cent in 1988. More than half of all
corrugated material is also recovered.
Fierce competition has put especially heavy pressure on Canadian newsprint
producers, whose capacity shrank from a peak of 10.3m tonnes last year to
9.8m tonnes in September. With the rising demand for recycled newsprint,
Canadian mills have been handicapped by their distance from the main urban
centres. The Canadian industry has also paid the price of a high cost
structure. Several old, inefficient machines, mostly in eastern Canada, have
been closed down.
According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, shipments to the US
tumbled to 4.23m tonnes in the first nine months of 1992, from 4.88m tonnes
in the same period of 1990.
Meanwhile, US suppliers' share of their home market has climbed from 4.16m
tonnes to 4.27m tonnes, but the US newsprint market itself has become more
fragmented. California's ailing economy and sagging demand in Japan have
opened a gap of about Dollars 35 a tonne between east- and west-coast
newsprint prices.
At least one big California newspaper publisher is understood to have told
suppliers that it is unable to accept any discount reduction for the time
being. By contrast, east coast producers' thoughts are already turning to
another price increase next spring.
