Several North American wood-pulp producers have announced their fifth price
rise of the year to levels that are roughly double those at the bottom of
the cycle in mid-1993.
The producers plan to raise the price of northern bleached softwood kraft
pulp, the industry's benchmark product, by USDollars 50 to Dollars 750 a
tonne on January 1. The increase, if successful, will bring prices to within
striking distance of the record Dollars 840 reached in 1989.
The world pulp market has been buoyed by a strong rise in paper consumption,
especially in Europe and South-east Asia, and by fears of a strike at pulp
and paper mills in British Columbia. Demand is so strong that many North
American producers are unable to meet their customers' full requirements.
World-wide producer stocks have fallen by almost half from the peak reached
last year.
According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, Canadian pulp mills
operated at 96 per cent of capacity during the first nine months of this
year, up from 85 per cent in 1993. Shipments of market pulp to western
Europe climbed by 21 per cent, to Japan by 39 per cent and to the rest of
Asia and Africa by 49 per cent.
Analysts are divided on whether and for how long the price surge will
continue. Mr Chip Dillon of Salomon Brothers in New York recently forecast
that NBSK prices would peak at Dollars 860 a tonne in 1997. Like many other
market watchers, however, Mr Dillon predicts a correction in early 1995,
reflecting the start-up of two large new mills in Indonesia and a slowdown
in the stocks build-up.
The unexpectedly steep climb in pulp prices last week led Kimberly-Clark,
the Dallas-based papermaker, to cancel a plan to spin off its pulp mills in
Ontario and Alabama into a new public company.
