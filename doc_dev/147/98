   MONTREAL -- Several Canadian forest-products concerns told
customers they will raise the price of a bellwether grade of
market pulp by 7.4% effective April 1, industry executives
and analysts said.
   Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd. and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.
officials confirmed that they will raise the North American
price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp by US$40 a
metric ton to $580 a metric ton on April 1. Both companies
are based in Vancouver, British Columbia.

   Industry executives and analysts said Canadian Pacific
Forest Products Ltd. and Repap Enterprises Corp. also
announced the price increase to customers. Canadian Pacific
Forest Products officials didn't return calls and Repap
Enterprises officials couldn't be reached. Both companies are
based in Montreal.
   The planned April 1 price rise follows two smaller price
increases this year. Canadian producers raised the North
American price of northern softwood pulp by $20 a metric ton
to $520 a metric ton on Jan. 1 and by an additional $20 a
metric ton to $540 a metric ton on Feb. 1. A metric ton
equals 2,204.6 pounds.
   Industry executives and analysts said it isn't certain the
April 1 price increase will stick, since demand is weak for
many of the paper products made from pulp.
   The list price of northern softwood pulp peaked at $840 a
metric ton in 1990 before hitting a low of $500 in 1991,
below the production cost of the pulp for most Canadian
producers. Canada is the world's largest exporter of market
pulp. The premium northern softwood pulp accounts for about
75% of Canada's pulp exports. Market pulp is wood pulp sold
on the open market to producers of paper and other products.
