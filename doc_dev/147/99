scope of recovery - Robert Gibbens considers the prospects for the country's
newsprint mills

CANADA'S newsprint mills face a volatile recovery now that the 1990-92 North
American recession finally appears to be over.
The biggest talking point at the moment is whether a 5-7 per cent reduction
in discounts posted in North America in April will hold and whether
resurgent demand on the east coast will justify a further attempt to impose
higher prices later in 1993.
West of the Rockies, newsprint prices have been stuck around USDollars 400 a
tonne because of California's depressed economy. The price could rise to
USDollars 435 by summer, but a real upturn in demand is far off, warns Mr
Robert Findlay, president of MacMillan Bloedel, one of two big Canadian
companies in that market.
'We see a very slow pick-up and it'll take time to make the April increase
stick. I'm very cautious about the outlook.' He adds that eastern
advertising was weak in the first quarter, but is improving.
According to Mr Paul Gagne, president of Canadian Pacific Forest Products,
over-optimism is dangerous. 'Demand is there but it's a mighty tough market.
Delivered cost rules supreme. I don't see real benefits from a better
pricing environment till the second half and 1994.'
Some publishers have been buying for their inventories because of firming
prices and the risk of mill stoppages in eastern Canada. Labour contracts
expired on April 30 and the Canadian Paperworkers Union has named
Abitibi-Price as its 'target' company. Western contracts expire this summer.
The newsprint and groundwood specialty mills - preponderantly in the east -
expect to operate at an average 93 per cent of capacity this year and 94 per
cent in 1994, against 85 per cent at the recession's trough. Some are
working flat out now, and see operating rates reaching 96 per cent next
year.
Analysts predict average 1993 newsprint prices in the east at USDollars 485
a tonne and USDollars 540 in 1994, and most companies accept those numbers
based on average annual North American market growth of 2-3 per cent.
Little new tonnage is in sight. Since 1989, 34 old machines with 1.8m tonnes
of capacity have been shut in North America and 12 new ones, totalling 2m
tonnes, have come on stream.
Sustained transaction prices of USDollars 600 or more are needed to justify
financing further capacity, and that point may not be reached before
1995-97, or near the cyclical peak.
'Such levels are possible but we'd still be below the official list price,'
says Mr Terry Pendleton, Kruger's vice-president, newsprint sales. But he
adds: 'We've really turned the corner. My order book is the strongest in
five years, and tightness in supply may well develop.'
The Canadian Pulp and Paper Association in January estimated 1993 newsprint
shipments would rise 2.8 per cent to 9.4m tonnes. Strength in the US and
Pacific Rim would offset lower European demand.
The industry is well advanced in installing recycled pulp capacity to meet
US regulations and maintain US newsprint market share, but the west coast's
single 120,000-tonne de-inking plant is not enough.
Mr Frank Dottori, president of Tembec, a big pulp and cartonboard producer
which has moved into newsprint by taking 40 per cent of Spruce Falls, says:
'We can meet the global challenge if we can raise capital with the
equivalent of US tax-free industrial revenue bonds. We've cut operating
costs and won job flexibility, but the government still ties our hands.'
Canadian newsprint traditionally takes well over 50 per cent of the US
market and Europe is still very important, he points out. Many mills are
owned by foreign publishers.
But technology, the rise of the US south, and inflated domestic costs have
changed the equation. Canada's share of the US market, now about 12m tonnes
a year, is slipping below 50 per cent and some see further shrinkage.
The US doubled its newsprint capacity to nearly 7m tonnes from 1972 to 1992,
though the south and the west face rising fibre costs.
'We must develop the Pacific Rim markets where growth will be double-digit
in the next few years,' says Mr Keith Winrow, vice-president, finance of
Fletcher Challenge Canada.
'Canadian newsprint will see a shift in geographical base as companies plan
more investment in the US. Canada has the fibre, but our main market is in
another jurisdiction. We're highly capital-intensive and we face a volatile
economic cycle.'
Reports persist of efforts to merge two or more Canadian firms into a
globally- competitive 'super-news' group. 'The idea has logic but the spark
is missing,' says Mr Dottori. 'I see only regional shuffles of assets to
gain fibre resource and cost advantages.'
