   Typhoon Koryn headed
north of this U.S. island commonwealth in the Pacific Ocean on
Monday with winds gusting to 110 mph, and forecasters believed the
storm had hit its peak, officials said.
   On Guam, crews worked to clear damage and restore water and
power service cut when the storm hit Sunday night.
   By noon Monday (9 p.m. Sunday EST), Koryn's center was 40 miles
north of Saipan, and the storm was moving north-northeast at 8 mph,
said Navy Lt. Diane Crittenden of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center
on Guam.
   The typhoon, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph and gusts
reaching 110 mph, was believed to have reached its peak, she said.
   If the storm kept to its course, it would not hit any other
islands in the Northern Marianas, but might hit the Japanese island
of Minami-Tori, according to Ms. Crittendon.
   Residents on Saipan boarded up houses, put boats to sea and
moved to community shelters, said Civil Defense coordinator Felix
Sasamopo. The airport was closed.
   On Guam, water service was restored to about 40 percent of the
island's population of 130,000, and 40 percent remained without
electricity, said Ben Reyes, a staff officer with Guam Civil
Defense.
   Winds tore tin roofs off two houses in Guam and forced more than
500 people into emergency shelters Sunday, but only a few remained
in shelters after the storm passed, said Reyes. Two minor injuries
were reported.
   The Guam airport was reopened after the typhoon passed. Guam is
also home to Andersen Air Force Base.
   Both Guam and the Northern Marianas are located west of the
International Date Line.
