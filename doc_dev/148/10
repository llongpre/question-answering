   Tropical Storm Colleen moved toward this U.S.
territory and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands
packing winds up to 45 mph.
   Colleen was expected to intensify to typhoon status, with 75 mph
winds, when it sweeps within 70 miles south of Guam on Tuesday, the
Joint Typhoon Warning Center said.
   At 1 p.m. today (10 p.m. Sunday EDT), Colleen was at 11.5
degrees latitude and 148.6 degrees longitude, or 247 miles
east-southeast of Andersen Air Force Base on Guam, the center said.
   As of 3 p.m., maximum winds were 40 to 45 mph and the storm was
moving to the west-northwest at 12 to 14 mph.
   Guam's Civil Defense issued a tropical-storm alert and said
Colleen could hit the island within 72 hours.
   Military officials were meeting to determine when airplanes and
ships should be moved for protection.
   The storm formed Sunday 500 miles east of Guam.
   The term ``typhoon'' is used for hurricanes west of the
international date line.
