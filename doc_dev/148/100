<LEADPARA>  Human polar bears dived into frigid waters, hundreds exchanged wedding vows in
Las Vegas and a California woman gave birth on the Rose Parade route as
traditional and offbeat New Year's Day celebrations marked the advent of
1991.;    In Philadelphia, outlandish costumes were the norm as people dressed
up like flowers, pigs or the opposite sex to take part in the 91st Mummers
Parade.  </LEADPARA>

<TEXT>     Musicians, mimes and female impersonators danced to "Oh, Dem Golden
Slippers" and other tunes as they strolled through Philadelphia.;    The
parade has its roots in centuries-old European celebrations in which men
dressed as women, women as men and poor as rich.;     Girl born on parade
route;  Perhaps the day's most unusual event occurred in Pasadena, where
20-year-old Ada Reyes gave birth while watching the 102nd Rose Parade with
about 1 million other people.;    Guadalupe Velasquez Reyes arrived at the
parade weighing 6 pounds, 12 ounces. After the birth, mother and daughter were
taken to a hospital.;    The first baby born on U.S. soil in 1991 was Kimberly
Manna Untaman, who arrived at 1:49 a.m. at Guam Memorial Hospital in the U.S.
territory of Guam, a South Pacific island on the other side of the
international dateline.;    In Las Vegas, scores of couples lined up to be
married on New Year's Eve. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority
estimated a record 142,000 visitors would welcome the new year at the desert
gambling resort.;    Marriage mecca; Las Vegas is a marriage mecca because
Nevada requires no blood test and no waiting period for those wanting to tie
the knot.;    Some traditions offered less warmth.;    About 400 members of
the Mount Gretna Polar Bear Club welcomed the new year by splashing in two
44-degree Pennsylvania ponds, and 40 swimmers crossed the 1.4 miles from
Alcatraz Island to San Francisco in 45-degree water.  </TEXT>
