   Tropical storm Koryn became a full-fledged
typhoon Sunday, lashing this U.S. Pacific territory with strong
winds and heavy rains, toppling trees and flooding low-lying areas,
authorities said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to
structures.
   As of 5 p.m. (2 a.m. EST), Koryn had sustained winds of 75 mph,
with gusts to 90 mph, according to Navy Lt. Joe Atangan of the
Joint Typhoon Warning Center Rapid Response Team.
   The storm's center was located 45 miles east of the northern tip
of the island, where Andersen Air Force Base is located, Atangan
said.
   The typhoon was ``quasi stationary'' but was expected to move
off to the north-northwest, skirting the northern coast, he said.
   Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands remained under a typhoon
alert, although the projected path of the storm would take it south
of the Marianas and away from any other islands, Atangan said.
   There were reports on Guam of intermittent power outages because
of downed lines, and flooding was reported in many areas, the
Pacific Daily News said.
   ``There's lots of coconuts on the roads,'' Atangan said.
   All Navy aircraft were placed in hangers for protection against
the strong winds, and the USS Haleakala was sent out to sea to
weather the storm, said Lt. Dave Lee. Three other warships were
allowed to remain in port, he said.
   The 12 planes at Andersen, including 11 B-52s, were parked
behind fortifications as the storm approached, said base spokesman
Capt. Wayne Perry.
   A tropical storm has sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph.
A typhoon has a minimum sustained surface wind of 74 mph.
