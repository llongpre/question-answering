   Typhoon Owen bore
down Thursday on Yap after killing two men and leaving more than
1,000 people homeless elsewhere in this sprawling Western Pacific
republic.
   The storm passed 20 miles south of the island of Woleai, but
there was no immediate word on the fate of the 300 residents, a
civil defense spokesman said.
   Owen, with sustained winds of 130 mph and gusts to 160 mph,
moved west-northwest at 14 mph and was expected to pass near the
island of Yap late Friday, said Lt. j.g. Richard Jeffries of the
Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center on Guam. Yap island has about
12,000 residents.
   Micronesia is in the western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator
and south of Guam, a U.S. territory. The principal island groups
include the Caroline Islands, Nauru, the Gilbert Islands, the
Northern Mariana Islands and the Marshall Islands.
   Two men were electrocuted Saturday by downed power lines when
the typhoon toppled a tree in the Micronesian capital of Pohnpei,
said Tony Palomo, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Interior
on Guam.
   The typhoon lashed the state of Truk's sparcely-populated outer
islands with 125 mph winds Wednesday, destroying many homes, said
Ismael Dobich, a Truk state spokesman. No injuries were reported.
   Truk is about 1,488 miles southeast of Guam.
