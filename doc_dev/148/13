   Guam Gov. Joseph Ada said the Internal Revenue Service soon will declare taxable a $300 million Guam housing-bond issue underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright Inc. 

   Gov. Ada told a House Interior subcommittee he met with the IRS last week on the bonds' tax status, and said, "They are coming out and declaring the $300 million (issue) taxable soon." 

   An attorney for Matthews &amp; Wright, a small Wall Street bond house, said he had no information on any IRS decision to tax the Guam bonds. 
A senior IRS official declined all comment on the matter. 

   The Guam bonds were issued as tax-exempt securities in 1985. 

   Two authorities on municipal bonds said they couldn't remember the IRS's having declared an issue taxable retroactively. 

   "I don't think it has ever happened," said James Lebenthal, president of the New York bond firm Lebenthal &amp; Co. Richard Ciccarone, senior research analyst of Van Kampen Merritt Inc., a Chicago, Ill., securities concern, said he couldn't recall it happening in his more than 10 years in the business.
