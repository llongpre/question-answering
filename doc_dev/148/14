   Residents waited behind boarded windows or
fled to shelters early Friday while Typhoon Russ battered the
island with winds topping 100 mph.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, officials
said.
   Russ was the strongest typhoon to hit this western Pacific
island in more than a decade. It toppled trees, pushed surf to more
than 20 feet high and made movement around the 30-mile-long island
virtually impossible.
   ``Everybody's just sitting tight,'' Guam Civil Defense spokesman
Mike Franquez said. ``We'll wait for the winds to pass and then
assess the damage.''
   About 145,000 people live on Guam. The last storm to cause major
damage here was Typhoon Pamela in 1976.
   Winds were clocked at 90 mph with gusts to 115 mph when the
storm made its closest pass before dawn, said Navy Capt. Dieter
Rudolph, commander of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   The wind readings were taken at the typhoon center, near the
north end of north-south lying island. The storm's center brushed
Guam's south coast, and southern areas were pummelled by the
strongest winds.
   The storm's maximum sustained winds were 145 mph, with gusts to
175 mph, Rudolph said. It was moving west-northwest at 13 mph.
   About 2,300 people went to shelters at schools. The windows of
most buildings had been boarded up, Franquez said.
   To avert the potential problem of dangling live wires if power
lines break, electricity was shut off to most of the island. Water
also was cut off. Some coastal roads were closed because the high
surf left them strewn with debris.
   ``There's downed power lines, downed trees, flooded streets,''
said Dave Ecret of KGUM Radio. ``It's just an eerie kind of
feeling.''
