   A Wall Street executive who pleaded guilty to
three counts of mail fraud for for allegedly bribing a former
governor of Guam has been sentenced to 18 months in prison.
   U.S. District Judge Jesse W. Curtis on Monday also placed Arthur
Abba Goldberg on five years' probation, fined him $100,000 and
ordered him to repay the United States $300,000.
   Goldberg, executive vice president of the New York bond
underwriting firm of Matthews &amp; Wright, pleaded guilty July 14 to
three counts of mail fraud.
   He had been accused of funneling $70,000 to former Guam Gov.
Ricardo J. Bordallo's unsuccessful 1986 re-election campaign. In
exchange, Bordallo allegedly agreed to generate support for a $300
million housing bond issue underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright.
   Bordallo was acquitted in February 1986 of accepting bribes from
Goldberg but was convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.
He served as governor from 1975-79 and from 1983-87.
   Goldberg had faced a maximum 15 years' imprisonment and a
$750,000 fine in addition to restitution payments, according to
William O'Connor, the U.S. attorney from Guam.
   The three counts referred to money bilked from the Guam Program
Development Fund and a ``lulling letter'' assuring fund authorities
that the transactions were legal.
   A December 1987 indictment charged Goldberg with preparing phony
invoices that were sent to the bank entrusted with the fund money.
   The bank paid the money to Goldberg, who spent $25,000 to buy
campaign paraphernalia _ including parasols, shirts and hats _ for
Bordallo's unsuccessful re-election bid, O'Connor has said.
   Authorities said Goldberg made his contributions after Bordallo
was promised that he would receive campaign contributions if he
supported the bond issue to build homes. The bond was approved by
the Guam Legislature in 1985. Matthews &amp; Wright has denied any
wrongdoing.
   In exchange for Goldberg's guilty pleas, 46 other counts
alleging bribery, conspiracy, and wire and mail fraud were
dismissed. The case was moved from Guam, 3,800 miles west of
Hawaii, because of extensive pretrial publicity on the island.
   Twelve of the original counts against Goldberg were related
directly to Guam. The balance referred to fraud involving the use
of the Commercial Bank of Americas in transactions that did not
involve the U.S. territory.
   In August 1987, Gov. Joseph Ada sued Matthews &amp; Wright for the
return of $14 million in fees the firm had received, as well as
$250 million in punitive damages. O'Connor said in July the suit
had been settled, but he released no details.
