   Typhoon Owen, a fierce storm with 125 mph
winds, slammed into the Federated States of Micronesia today,
killing two people and leaving more than 1,000 people homeless,
officials said.
   The two men were killed in the Micronesian capital of Pohnpei
when they were electrocuted by downed power lines, said Tony
Palomo, a representative of the Guam Department of the Interior.
   Early reports estimated that well over 1,000 people were left
homeless after the powerful storm packing winds of 125 mph and
gusts of 155 mph battered the outer islands of Pulap, Ruo, Nomwin,
Fananu, Murilo and Tamatam in the state of Chuuk, said Ismael
Dobich, public affairs director of Chuuk.
   Each island has about 500 residents. Micronesia is in the
western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator. The principal island
groups include the Caroline Islands, Nauru, the Gilbert Islnads,
the Northern Mariana Islands and the Marshall Islands.
   Owen destroyed nearly every home on Pulap and Ruo, Dobich said.
The entire banana, coconut, taro and bread fruit crops were
destroyed on Ruo, Dobich.
   ``In Pulap, all of the homes were destroyed with the exception
of one concrete structure,'' Dobich said. Most of the homes were
made of wood and tin.
   Owen was expected to regain supertyphoon status by late Thursday
or early Friday, with forecasters predicting winds of 150 mph and
gusts to 180 mph.
   Guam, 1,488 miles from Chuuk, remains on a typhoon alert status.
Owen was about 405 miles south of Guam, an American territory,
Wednesday morning.
