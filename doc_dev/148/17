   A federal judge today struck down Guam's
virtual ban on abortion as unconstitutional. The measure was the
nation's most restrictive abortion law.
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the
1973 Supreme Court decision establishing the right to an abortion,
``applied with equal force and effect to Guam.''
   The law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on March 19, banned abortions
except when the mother's life is in danger. But Munson on March 23
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law
from abortion-rights forces.
   The law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $1,000
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to
have an abortion. Performing an illegal abortion was punishable by
up to five years in prison.
   Two days after the law went into effect, an American Civil
Liberties Union lawyer, Janet Benshoof of New York, was charged
with violating the measure by publicly encouraging women to seek
abortions in Hawaii. The charges later were dropped; prosecutors
said the lawsuit challenging the law was a higher priority.
   The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal
today's ruling.
   ``I'm still very pro-life, and I believe that a fetus is a human
being and should be given life,'' said Ada, a Roman Catholic like
the vast majority of Guam's residents.
   The challenge to the law was brought by an unidentified pregnant
woman who wanted an abortion, the Guam Society of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists, the Guam Nurses Association, an Episcopal priest and
three doctors.
   Anita Arriola, a lawyer for the abortion-rights side, had argued
that the law _ introduced by her mother, territorial Sen. Elizabeth
Arriola _ was contrary to Roe vs. Wade and was passed to promote a
particular religious belief.
   Katherine A. Maraman, representing the government of this U.S.
possession in the Western Pacific, had argued that 99 percent of
all abortions on Guam were not necessary but were for the
convenience of the mother.
   In his ruling, Munson said sections of the law are vague and
that the provision against soliciting an abortion violates the
right to free speech.
   Arriola said the decision ``sends a very clear signal to
Governor Ada and the Guam Legislature and other legislatures around
the country.''
   ``This decision means that Roe vs. Wade is still the law of the
land,'' said Lou Leon Guerrero, president of People for Choice.
   Dawn C. Leon Guerrero, chairwoman of the Guam Pro-Life
Coalition, said she expected the ruling, ``because the judge has to
follow legal precedent.''
   ``We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb,'' said Roland
Rivera, vice president of Guamanians United for Life. ``There is
just the next higher level to pursue.''
