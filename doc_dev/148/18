   A federal judge on Monday extended a
restraining order against enforcement of the most restrictive U.S.
abortion law.
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson had issued a temporary
restraining order Friday, a few hours after a group of Guam
residents and medical groups filed a class-action suit. On Monday,
he extended the order until May 8, when a trial on the suit is
scheduled to begin.
   ``We're very happy,'' said Anita Arriola, the plaintiffs'
attorney.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   The law in this Pacific territory is seen by abortion opponents
as a potential vehicle to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe
vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   The Guam law provides for a referendum in the Nov. 6 general
election for Guam voters to decide whether to retain or reject the
abortion ban.
   Janet Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project defied the law last Tuesday when she
publicly encouraged women seeking abortions to have them done in
Hawaii. She was charged in the territorial Supreme Court with
solicitation to commit abortion, a misdemeanor.
   Among those named in the suit is Gov. Joseph Ada, who signed the
measure into law March 19.
   The plaintiffs include ``Maria Doe,'' a Guam woman who is eight
weeks pregnant and wants an abortion; the Guam Society of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the Guam Nurses Association, an
Episcopal priest and three Guam doctors.
