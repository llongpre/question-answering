   The Coast Guard today called off a search for
10 crew members of a South Korean fishing boat missing for three
days since Typhoon Russ swept the area, officials said.
   A military transport ship located the partially submerged hull
of the 68-foot Marguarita I 35 miles off the southern tip of Guam
on Sunday, but there was no sign of the crew, the Coast Guard said.
   The Coast Guard cutter Assateague and a C130 aircraft searched a
19,000-square-mile area but didn't locate any crew members, said
Lt. Bob Ritchie of the Coast Guard Rescue Center on this U.S.
island territory in the Western Pacific. He said the search was
called off today.
   The Marguarita I sailed from Agana on Thursday, even though it
was well known the typhoon was bearing down on the island, said
Coast Guard Lt. Jeffrey Lee, duty officer for the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center in Honolulu.
   The fishing vessel radioed its agent here late Thursday that it
was disabled with a clutch problem, Lee said.
   Communication with the boat was lost Friday when electrical
power went out on Guam as Typhoon Russ battered the island with
wind up to 150 mph.
   Federal Emergency Management Agency officials said the storm
damged or destroyed more than 2,000 homes and injured 88 people. No
deaths were reported.
   Guam Power Authority officials said they expected to have
electrical power restored to 60 percent of the island today. Water
service remained disrupted in many areas because pumps were without
electrical power.
   Gov. Joseph Ada has asked President Bush to declare the island a
disaster area.
