   The Internal Revenue Service notified Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands that interest on $380 million of municipal bonds issued by the two Pacific jurisdictions isn't tax-exempt. 

   But the IRS made it clear it hasn't reached the point of moving to tax interest income earned by bondholders. 

   The Territory of Guam sold $300 million of bonds as tax-exempt securities in October 1985. 
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands sold $80 million of bonds as tax-exempts in December 1984. 
Both issues were underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright Inc. 

   A U.S. grand jury in Guam late last year cited the Guam and Northern Mariana Islands bond issues, among others, in a 52-count indictment charging Matthews &amp; Wright Executive Vice President Arthur Abba Goldberg and a one-time company consultant with promoting a nationwide fraud involving more than $2 billion in municipal bonds. 
Mr. Goldberg has pleaded innocent. 
His trial isn't expected to get under way until next year. 
The company has denied any wrongdoing. 

   "After thorough consideration, we have concluded that interest on the (Guam) bonds is not tax-exempt under section 103 of the Code," IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs told Guam Gov. Joseph Ada in a letter. 
The same message was delivered to Gov. Pedro Tenorio of the Northern Mariana Islands. 

   The action wasn't wholly unexpected. 
Gov. Ada told a congressional panel earlier this year that the IRS was going to declare the $300 million issue taxable. 

   IRS officials have refused to discuss the bonds in question, and a spokesman declined yesterday to comment on the issues. 
Officials of Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands couldn't be reached immediately for comment. 

   Attorney David Aufhauser of Williams &amp; Connolly, Matthews &amp; Wright's law firm, emphasized the view that the IRS's conclusions are "only preliminary." 
He said Matthews &amp; Wright is confident the IRS's conclusions will be "reconsidered and changed" in due course. 

   The IRS said in the letters, "If desired, we will also consider whether there are good and sufficient reasons for finally resolving this matter through the use of a closing agreement," explaining that under such agreements, "the service forgoes taxing the interest in the hands of the bondholder but collects all or an appropriate percentage of such lost revenues from the issuer." 

   Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands separately have filed lawsuits against parties involved in the issuance of the bonds, including Matthews &amp; Wright.
