   The fight to keep abortion legal on Guam is
being overshadowed in Saturday's primary elections by the
possibility that the U.S. territory may have its first woman and
non-native governor.
   Gov. Joseph Ada is unopposed on the Republican ballot as he
seeks a second term.
   Democrats face a choice between Sen. Madeleine Z. Bordallo, a
native of Minnesota and widow of Guam's former governor, or former
Lt. Gov. Rudy Sablan. The winner will face Ada on Nov. 6.
   Guam's 21-member unicameral legislature unanimously approved a
bill virtually banning abortions March 8 after Archbishop Anthony
Apuron threatened in a television interview to excommunicate any
Roman Catholic senator who voted against it.
   Ada signed the bill into law, saying: ``In my heart, I believe
that a fetus is a human being.''
   The law carried a penalty of up to a year in jail and a $1,000
fine for obtaining an illegal abortion or soliciting a woman to
have an abortion. Performing an illegal abortion was punishable by
up to five years in prison.
   Last week, U.S. District Judge Alex Munson struck down the law
as unconstitutional. Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the 1973
Supreme Court decision establishing the right to an abortion,
``applied with equal force and effect to Guam.''
   Ada has not indicated whether he will seek an appeal.
   Mrs. Bordallo has said she also opposes abortion.
   Ada said he's running on his record of the past four years. He
said he is confident he and his running mate, Lt. Gov. Frank Blas,
will win re-election.
   On Jan. 31, Mrs. Bordallo's husband, Ricardo, chained himself to
a statue, wrapped himself in Guam's flag and shot himself in the
head. That occurred less than four hours before he was to fly to
Los Angeles to begin serving a four-year prison term for witness
tampering and obstruction.
   Ada defeated Bordallo in the 1986 election after Bordallo had
been indicted on the federal charges.
   Mrs. Bordallo wants to be Guam's first woman governor and the
first governor who is non-Chamorro, the name for native Guamanians.
   ``Women are moving ahead today. They are leading countries.
Right next door, we have a housewife leading 60 million people,''
said Mrs. Bordallo, referring to Philippine President Corazon
Aquino.
   Some 130,000 people life on Guam, an island about 1,500 miles
east of the Philippines.
   Mrs. Bordallo, 57, came to Guam in 1948 when her father accepted
a position as principal of George Washington High School here.
   Sablan, 58, served as Gov. Bordallo's lieutenant governor from
1974 to 1978, unsuccessfully challenged Bordallo in the Democratic
primaries in 1978 and 1982.
   Sablan, who also opposes abortion, said one of his priorities as
governor would be to set up a territorial tax structure that is not
tied to the federal tax system.
   The archbishop issued a pastoral letter published in newspapers
this week calling for voters to vote down pro-choice candidates.
   ``Like a modern day Pontius Pilate, a legislator or official may
attempt to wash his or her hands of abortion,'' Apuron said.
``However, the legislator cannot wash away the blood of the
innocents he or she has consciously declined to protect. Nor can
the voter sit idly by in apathy.''
