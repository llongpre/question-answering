   The governments of the Pacific islands of Guam and Saipan filed separate damage suits against Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. alleging fraud and breach of contract in the New York bond firm's underwriting of huge bond issues there. 

   The suits, among a growing number of civil complaints against the Wall Street concern, seek $350 million in punitive damages and ask for a return of about $20 million in underwriting fees collected by Matthews &amp; Wright. 

   Filed in district courts of the U.S. territories, the suits also seek additional damages for "injuries suffered" to both islands' economies, said Donald C. Williams, an attorney representing the islands. 
The suits also name George Benoit, Matthews &amp; Wright's president and chairman; Arthur Abba Goldberg, its executive vice president; Frederick Mann, a Toronto businessman who served as an "authorized representative" in the bond issues; and a score of lawyers and consultants who helped package the bond issues. 

   Gerald A. Feffer, a Washington-based lawyer representing Matthews &amp; Wright, said, "We haven't seen the complaint" and therefore couldn't comment on the issue. 
In Toronto, Mr. Mann didn't return phone calls seeking comment on the suits. 

   As previously reported, both the Guam issue, for $300 million to finance low-income housing, and the Saipan issue, which was to fund $80 million in housing projects, are among more than 20 Matthews &amp; Wright bond issues under federal investigation. 
Many of the issues, all completed in 1985 and 1986 and representing about $3 billion in investments, are suspected of having been sham transactions designed largely to reap huge fees for the underwriter, federal officials close to the investigation have said. 

   In some cases, the underwriter is suspected of creating phony sales to beat a federal tax exemption deadline, and in others of coaxing municipalities into floating projects so huge and unrealistic that they were never viable. 
Investigators close to the case say that in some instances Matthews &amp; Wright is suspected of doing both. 
A number of grand juries investigating the bond issues, including one on Guam, also are investigating suspicions that Matthews &amp; Wright in some cases made payoffs to selected public officials to win their support for the bond issues. 
Attorneys hired by Matthews &amp; Wright to conduct an internal company investigation have said they found no evidence of bribery. 

   The federal probe, as reported, extends beyond Matthews &amp; Wright to perhaps a half-dozen other underwriters and involves another 80 municipal issues representing an additional $9 billion. 
All of the issues are so-called arbitrage or escrow bonds, a controversial type of financing that since has been greatly restricted by Congress. 
Until projects could get off the ground, proceeds from such low-interest bonds could be invested in higher-interest instruments that would provide income to issuers, fees to underwriters and returns to investors -- whether projects got built or not. 
In some cases, the proceeds in escrow were invested in a way that would protect the bond investors should the projects be scrapped. 

   Congress, in 1985, decided to severely curb arbitrage, arguing it gave issuers little incentive to complete projects and led to abuses. 
The congressional action set off a stampede of last-minute arbitrage bond filings in December 1985 and August 1986 in advance of two deadlines. 

   On both Guam and Saipan, no projects have yet been built under the bond issues, something common to many of the Matthews &amp; Wright issues. 
The bonds were structured so that the proceeds in escrow were kept from developers, thus preventing the financing for the projects to get under way. 
As a result, local contractors with limited skills and few resources were left to raise huge amounts of money in the interim, a task most have found impossible, according to investigators who have looked at many of the Matthews &amp; Wright issues. 

   In their lawsuits, Guam and Saipan allege that Matthews &amp; Wright, and its various consultants, breached promises and commitments to help obtain such financing, or misled local contractors about the availability or ease of obtaining financial backing for bond projects. 
The islands fear that the bond-issue problems might shut them out of the municipal credit markets in the future. 

   In a separate issue, the Guam suit also seeks to overturn an agreement between Matthews &amp; Wright and a Guam economic development agency that essentially limits the liability of the underwriter to $1.5 million in its preparation of the bond issue, shifting the liability to the government. 
The suit charges that the agreement represents an unauthorized "modification" to the original legislation authorizing the Guam bonds. 

   Guam is a U.S. trust territory of about 100,000 residents about 7,500 miles southwest of San Francisco; Saipan, a neighboring island, has about 20,000 residents and is the capital of a multi-island chain known as the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands.
