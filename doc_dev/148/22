   A senior Internal Revenue Service official refused to say if the agency is likely to issue more letters, such as those sent to Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, specifying that certain municipal bonds sold as tax-exempt securities are not tax-exempt. 
But he said the IRS is "not unaware" of a number of additional problem municipal issues. 

   "We just can't discuss anything we've got in-house," the official said, explaining that the IRS is barred by law from discussing taxpayer matters, including municipal bond deals suspected or deemed to have failed the tests for tax exemption. 

   At the same time, he said the IRS is "not unaware of a number of other bond issues" believed to have tax problems. 

   Former Treasury tax attorney Joseph Krolikowski, now in private law practice in Pittsburgh, said the IRS letters to Guam and the Northern Marianas "may open up a new era of the service quasi-publicly declaring bonds taxable." 
The IRS action is "a healthy development," he said. 
As previously reported, IRS Commissioner Lawrence Gibbs recently told the governors of the Territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands that interest on $300 million of Guam bonds sold in October 1985 and on $80 million of Northern Marianas bonds sold in December 1984 "is not tax exempt." 
The agency concluded the bonds were arbitrage bonds. 
Both bond issues were underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright Inc., which said it believed the bonds were validly issued and are tax-exempt. 

   Mr. Gibbs said in his letters that the bond issuing agencies are entitled to a conference where additional facts or legal arguments could be presented regarding the tax status of the bonds. 
He further stated: "If desired, we will also consider whether there are good and sufficient reasons for finally resolving this matter through use of a closing agreement. 
Generally, under such agreements the service foregoes taxing the interest in the hands of the bondholders but collects all or an appropriate percentage of such lost revenues from the issuer." 

   Some lawyers involved in the matter, noting the IRS letters set no deadlines for talks or for any closing agreement, speculated that the IRS could let things stand as they are indefinitely, without actually taxing bondholders. 
However, there are clear indications the IRS doesn't plan to let the matter remain pending indefinitely. 

   Some market participants following the slowly unfolding arbitrage bond saga said they expect a number of other "not-tax-exempt" letters to come from the IRS. 
They cited as leading candidates for such treatment the so-called South Tucson bonds, three bond issues totaling $368 million from three Arizona communities. 
Several market people said privately there are billions of dollars of questionable bonds sold earlier in the 1980s that could warrant "not tax-exempt" treatment by the IRS on the same grounds cited in the Guam and Northern Marianas Islands letters.
