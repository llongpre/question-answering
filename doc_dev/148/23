   Officials of U.S. territories told a
congressional panel Thursday that they have increasing drug
problems, and need the additional federal aid included in pending
legislation.
   The bill, introduced by Rep. Don de Lugo, D-Virgin Islands,
would provide training, equipment and money for American Samoa,
Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
Islands and Palau.
   De Lugo, who presided at the hearing as chairman of the House
Interior subcommittee on insular and international affairs, said he
expected the legislation to become part of a planned comprehensive
drug bill this year.
   The legislation would provide $11.5 million in assistance in the
first year, and $5.5 million annually in subsequent years.
   Gov. Alexander A. Farrelly of the Virgin Islands said his
territory has become a major transit point for drugs moving from
South America to the U.S. mainland.
   But the governor and Iver Stridiron, president of the Virgin
Islands legislature, said significant amounts of the drugs remain
in the territory and are causing a large increase in violent crimes.
   ``It really has our community under siege,'' Stridiron said. But
he added that with additional resources, the island territory could
become a model of combatting the drug problem in U.S. territories.
   Farrelly said his major problem is resources, commenting that
the assignment of a single Drug Enforcement Administration agent in
the islands indicates either ``non-recognition of a serious
problem'' or lack of interest in solving it.
   Gov. Joseph F. Ada of Guam said his territory is experiencing a
resurgence of heroin abuse after cleaning up the problem following
the Vietnam War.
   ``In 1985, there was not one single case of heroin possession in
the territory of Guam,'' he testified. ``In 1986, 12 heroin arrests
were made by our police department.
   ``In 1987, there were 108 cases of heroin possession, with 56
still pending laboratory analysis and confirmation. By any
definition, this is an alarming rise,'' Ada said.
   The governor said 91 percent pure heroin from Southeast Asia has
been entering Guam through Palau. But after law enforcement
officers discovered the route, the drugs began coming to Guam via
the Northern Marianas, he said.
   Asked by de Lugo if he could put a cost on Guam's drug problem,
Ada said the law enforcement price tag could be $2 million to $3
million, but added the real cost could only be measured in trauma
and shattered lives _ not dollars.
   Responding to a question by Rep. Fofo I.F. Sunia, D-American
Samoa, Ada said he would fire anyone in his administration abusing
drugs with ``no questions asked.''
   A written statement submitted by American Samoa Gov. A.P. Lutali
said the ``most pervasive and growing illegal substance abuse
problem'' in his territory is marijuana, followed by cocaine.
   Referring to the marijuana problem, Lutali's statement said,
``What 10 years ago was a situation involving a relatively small
number of individuals importing the drug through the U.S. mail has
now become a cultivation enterprises market by extended families
producing in excess of seven tons per year.''
