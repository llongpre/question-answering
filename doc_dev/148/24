   A New York executive accused of pumping money
into the campaign of a former governor of Guam in exchange for a
political favor pleaded guilty Friday to three counts of mail fraud.
   Arthur Abba Goldberg entered the plea before U.S. District Judge
Jesse Curtis, said Guam's U.S. Attorney, Bill O'Connor. In exchange
for his guilty plea, 46 counts alleging bribery, conspiracy, wire
and mail fraud, and violation of interstate racketeering statutes
were dismissed.
   ``In dismissing the counts, the Guam issues were dissolved,''
O'Connor said. ``Other issues are on the table if another
jurisdiction sees fit to follow through.''
   Twelve of the counts were related directly to Guam, a U.S.
territory since August, 1950, said O'Connor. The balance of the
counts related to fraud involving use of the Commercial Bank of
Americas in transactions that did not involve Guam, O'Connor said.
   Although Goldberg, executive vice president of the New York bond
underwriting firm of Matthews &amp; Wright, only pleaded to three of the
dozen counts, O'Connor was satisfied with the outcome.
   ``Mr. Goldberg's plea gave the same latitude of sentencing than
if he went to trial,'' O'Connor said. ``We, of course, will
recommend jail time and a heavy fine.''
   Goldberg faces a possible 15 years imprisonment, a $750,000 fine
and restitution payments, O'Connor said in a telephone interview
from his Santa Ana office. Sentencing was scheduled in Curtis' court
Sept. 11.
   One of Goldberg's attorneys, Howard L. Weitzman, said he had no
immediate comment. A receptionist who answered a call made after
business hours to another defense attorney, Bruce Hochman, said
Hochman had gone for the day.
   The three mail fraud counts concerned $57,500 bilked from the
Guam Program Development Fund and a letter assuring fund authorities
that transactions were above board, while fraud was taking place.
   Goldberg prepared phony invoices that were sent to the bank
entrusted with fund money. ``The bank paid the money Goldberg
exerted for his purposes and ... he attempted to cover up later with
false papers in the files,'' O'Connor said.
   O'Connor said $25,000 was ``used to buy campaign paraphernalia _
parasols, hats, shirts, junk like that'' for Guam Gov. Ricardo J.
Bordallo's unsuccessful 1986 re-election bid.
   The funds were funneled to Bordallo after he was promised the
money in exchange for his support on a bond issue, $300 million of
which was sold by Matthews &amp; Wright.
   The bond was approved by the Guam Legislature in 1985. Matthews &amp;
Wright deny any wrongdoing.
   Bordallo was acquitted in February, 1986, of accepting bribes
from Goldberg but convicted on 10 counts of government corruption.
   The case is among about 25 municipal bond deals nationwide
involving Matthews &amp; Wright under investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
