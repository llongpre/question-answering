   Arthur Abba Goldberg, executive vice president of Matthews &amp; Wright Inc., a New York bond underwriting firm, pleaded innocent to charges he orchestrated a bogus $300 million bond issue on Guam. 

   U.S. District Judge Cristobal Duenas allowed Mr. Goldberg to be freed on a $1 million unsecured bond. 
He is represented by Stanley S. Arkin. 

   Mr. Goldberg and Frederick L. Mann, a Canadian citizen and former consultant to Matthews &amp; Wright, were indicted Dec. 10 on 52 counts of bribery, conspiracy, wire fraud and mail fruad, and violation of interstate anti-racketeering statutes in a scheme to amass more than $2.5 billion in fraudulent bond issues in Guam, Palau, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas and cities across the U.S. 

   Mr. Mann, who also was scheduled for arraignment yesterday, did not appear. 
Prosecutors said they did not know his whereabouts. 

   Edward K. Strauss, legal counsel to Matthews &amp; Wright on the Guam bond, pleaded guilty last week to a charge of withholding knowledge of Messrs. 
Goldberg's and Mann's actions. 
He agreed to disclose knowledge of their alleged schemes in exchange for a recommendation of no prison term.
