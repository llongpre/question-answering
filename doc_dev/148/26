Guam's attorney general, seeking a constitutional test of the U.S. territory's 
day-old anti-abortion law, on Tuesday filed a complaint against a New York 
woman who had disseminated information here about terminating pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
Guam's law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on Monday, is the most restrictive 
abortion legislation in the United States and has riveted national attention on 
this tiny South Pacific island. 
</P>
<P>
The law makes it a felony to perform an abortion even in cases of rape, incest 
and fetal abnormality. An abortion is allowed only if two independent doctors 
determine a pregnancy would endanger the life of a mother or gravely impair her 
health. 
</P>
<P>
It also makes it a misdemeanor to have an abortion or "knowingly solicit" 
pregnant women to have one. 
</P>
<P>
In the complaint filed in Superior Court here, Atty. Gen. Elizabeth 
Barrett-Anderson said that Janet Benshoof, director of the Reproductive Rights 
Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, violated the law when she 
encouraged pregnant women seeking abortions to leave Guam for Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett-Anderson had previously advised both the governor and the Guam 
Legislature that the abortion law was unconstitutional and said Tuesday that 
her action was designed to force a constitutional test. 
</P>
<P>
"My decision to bring a criminal charge under the new law will provide the 
basis for the courts to decide the question as quickly as possible. I believe 
this will be in the best interests of the government and of all persons 
affected by the new law," Barrett-Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Guam have an opportunity to repeal the legislation in a referendum 
scheduled in November. The law was passed by the territorial Legislature after 
the archbishop of Guam had threatened to excommunicate those who opposed the 
measure, although most of the legislators said they were unaware of the threat. 
More than 90% of the population on the island is Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
In signing the legislation on Monday, Gov. Ada had insisted the law was a local 
issue. "I am not taking this action today to affect anyone's life in the 50 
states. I believe that this is a community issue and a community concern, first 
and foremost." 
</P>
<P>
But abortion foes and abortion rights supporters have seized upon the law as a 
possible test of the Supreme Court's willingness to temper or undo its historic 
Roe vs. Wade decision, which guaranteed women a right to an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
Idaho and Maryland are currently studying abortion legislation, but the Guam 
law caught activists by surprise. Benshoof arrived in Guam over the weekend 
proclaiming that the new statute cannot coexist with Roe vs. Wade and likened 
the bill to a "Pearl Harbor for women." 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday she acknowledged that she was breaking the law in providing the 
name, address and phone number of a Honolulu group that could help women get an 
abortion. The attorney general's complaint was filed Tuesday afternoon. 
Benshoof's arraignment was set for today.
