   Gov. Joseph Ada said a fetus is a human being
in signing a bill creating the most restrictive U.S. abortion
statute, but abortion rights advocates already are challenging the
measure.
   Janet Benshoof, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer,
immediately violated the law by telling women in a speech where to
go to have an abortion, and the territory's attorney general _ who
personally opposes the measure _ pressed charges.
   Territorial Attorney General Elizabeth Barrett-Anderson says
prosecuting the case will be ``a heavy burden,'' but a
responsibility of her job.
   Benshoof made a court appearance Tuesday, Guam time, but
Superior Court Judge Ramon V. Diaz said he could not hear the case
because he did not feel he could render a fair and impartial
decision.
   Benshoof is scheduled to be arraigned today.
   The law, which passed despite a ruling by Barrett-Anderson that
it is unconstitutional, makes it a third-degree felony for a person
to perform or help in an abortion. Seeking or having an abortion or
soliciting someone to have an abortion are misdemeanors.
   The law also sets a referendum during the Nov. 6 general
election for residents of this Pacific Ocean island about 1,500
miles east of the Philippines to decide whether to keep the law.
   ``In my heart, I believe that a fetus is a human being,'' Ada,
the Republican governor, said in signing the bill, which prohibits
abortion except when the mother's health or life are endangered.
   Benshoof said she immediately violated a provision of the law by
advising women in a speech at the Guam Press Club later in the day
to go to Hawaii to have legal abortions.
   ``I was very specific in my breaking of the law,'' Benshoof
said. ``The information that I gave, which is now a crime, came
from the Honolulu Yellow Pages.''
   Barrett-Anderson filed a misdemeanor complaint charging Benshoof
with violating the ban on soliciting someone to have an abortion.
Benshoof faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted.
   ``It's a matter of public record that I advised the Guam
Legislature ... that in my opinion the bill was unconstitutional by
operation of the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade,''
Barrett-Anderson said later in a statement.
   ``My advisory role has now shifted to one of enforcement. This
is a heavy burden, but ... I will enforce this statute to the
extent that the law allows.''
   Benshoof, who went to Guam to try to persuade Ada not to sign
the bill, was not arrested but appeared in court voluntarily.
   Guam's 21-member unicameral Legislature unanimously approved the
bill March 8 after Archbishop Anthony Apuron threatened in an
interview with a television reporter to excommunicate any Roman
Catholic senator who voted against it. All but one of the senators
is Catholic, as is Ada. However, most of the senators said they
were unaware of the threat.
   Among those hailing the new law was the National Right to Life
Committee.
   ``This is great news,'' group spokeswoman Nancy Myers said in a
telephone interview from her Washington office. ``The people of
Guam are largely pro-life as reflected by the unanimous vote in the
Legislature, and they have made a strong statement.''
