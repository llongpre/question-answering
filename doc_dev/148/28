<HEAD>Bush Picks Up Four Territorial Votes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four delegates were chosen today to represent
this U.S. territory at the Republican National Convention and all
say they support Vice President George Bush for president.
   Those selected at the territory's Republican convention included
territorial Gov. Joseph F. Ada, who said of Bush: ``He knows where
Guam is. His heart is in Guam. He told me that one of these days
the people of Guam are going to vote for president.''
   Although residents of Guam are American citizens, they are not
allowed to cast ballots in presidential elections.
   Bush said of the Guam results: ``This victory is a tribute to
the hard work and dedication of our organization there.''
   About 200 party members who attended the GOP gathering approved
a number of resolutions that will be given to all GOP presidential
candidates.
   One of the resolutions supports the drive to give territorial
residents the right to vote in presidential elections, while
another presses for Guam to become a commonwealth of the United
States.

<HEAD>Portsmouth Herald Endorses Dole, Dukakis In New Hampshire Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New Hampshire's Portsmouth Herald has
endorsed Republican Bob Dole and Democrat Michael Dukakis in
Tuesday's leadoff presidential primary.
   The newspaper on Friday called Dukakis, governor of neighboring
Massachusetts, ``one man who stands ahead of his colleagues vying
for the Democratic nomination ... a man who has perceptibly grown
in political stature and consciousness of national and foreign
affairs since he began his presidential bid.''
   The newspaper said Dole, the Senate minority leader, has
``credibility and leadership. Those are but two of his strong
suits.''
   The newspaper has a circulation of nearly 14,000.
