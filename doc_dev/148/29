   A key player in the Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. municipal bond scandal agreed to cooperate as a prosecution witness in a Guam federal grand jury investigation of a top Matthews &amp; Wright executive and a former company consultant. 

   The agreement was disclosed in documents filed in federal court on Guam by Edward K. Strauss, a Pittsburgh attorney, who provided tax opinions on numerous Matthews &amp; Wright bond issues, and William O'Connor, Guam's U.S. attorney. 
Mr. Strauss, according to the documents, pleaded guilty to concealing knowledge of "cognizable felonies" allegedly committed by Arthur Abba Goldberg, Matthews &amp; Wright's executive vice president, and Frederick Mann, a Canadian who served as a Matthews &amp; Wright consultant. 

   In exchange for Mr. Strauss's plea and cooperation, federal authorities pledged not to seek additional criminal charges against him unless he provides "deliberately false or misleading" testimony, Mr. O'Connor, the federal attorney, said. 
Mr. Strauss, a partner in the firm of Berkman Ruslander Pohl Lieber &amp; Engel, was said to be traveling and couldn't be reached for comment. 

   Mr. Strauss's surprising guilty plea would appear to strengthen the government's case against Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann, who were charged last month by a Guam federal grand jury in a 52-count indictment alleging fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. 
The indictments stem largely from their handling of a $300 million housing bond issue on Guam; an $80 million housing issue on the neighboring island of Saipan; and a $400 million bond issue for the island of Palau. 

   Those issues are among some 20 Matthews &amp; Wright bond offerings, representing about $3 billion, that are being investigated by several federal jurisdictions. 
Federal prosecutors suspect that many were bloated, sham transactions rushed to market by Matthews &amp; Wright to beat a federal tax deadline and generate huge underwriting fees. 

   In court documents filed as part of his plea agreement, Mr. Strauss stated that he "knew or had reason to suspect" that 13 separate bond issues allegedly bought by Matthews &amp; Wright were fraudulent transactions "conducted by Goldberg and Mann" using worthless checks processed through an unlicensed Saipan bank controlled by Mr. Mann. 

   Those issues -- representing about $2.1 billion -- include a $125.3 million East St. Louis, Ill., resource recovery bond; a $223.7 million East St. Louis port development bond; a $200 million Washington County, Pa., revenue bond; a $335 million City of Chester, Pa., resource recovery bond; a $500 million East Chicago Heights, Ill., resource recovery bond; and the $400 million Palau bond. 

   Mr. Strauss also stated that he knew or suspected that Mr. Goldberg had committed federal mail fraud in January 1986 by submitting $57,500 of "false or fraudulent" invoices to a Guam government agency for consulting services never performed. 

   The charge to which Mr. Strauss pleaded guilty is punishable by a fine of up to $500 and three years in jail. 

   Mr. Goldberg, who has taken a voluntary leave of absence from Matthews &amp; Wright, will voluntarily appear on Guam next week where he is expected to plead not guilty to the 52-count indictment. 
His attorney, Stanley S. Arkin, said Mr. Goldberg, despite Mr. Strauss's agreement with federal prosecutors, "steadfastly maintains his innocence." 

   Authorities have sworn out an arrest warrant for Mr. Mann, who has denied the charges against him. 

   An attorney with Williams &amp; Connolly, the law firm representing Matthews &amp; Wright, said Matthews &amp; Wright continues to insist it engaged in no wrongdoing. 
"It's still the company's position they relied on Strauss's counsel," he said.
