   Typhoon Koryn, packing sustained winds of 75
mph and gusts to 90 mph, swept past this U.S. Pacific territory
Sunday night before heading toward the Northern Mariana Islands,
authorities said.
   High winds and heavy rains knocked out electricity over 30
percent of Guam, cutting power to 56 of the island's 90 water
wells, officials said.
   Winds ranging from 35 to 55 mph ripped tin roofs off two houses
and forced 21 people into emergcy shelters, the officials said.
   There were two reports of minor injuries. A 50-year-old man
suffered a cut ear while trying to put up shutters and a
46-year-old woman was injured when she was blown into a pole. Both
were treated and released from Guam Memorial Hospital, a hospital
spokesman said.
   As of 7 p.m. (4 a.m. EST), Koryn was 44 miles northeast of Guam,
moving to the northwest at 8 mph, according to Navy Lt.j.g. Ken
Minogue of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center Rapid Response Team.
   The typhoon was forecast to pass to the north of Rota, the most
southern of the Northern Marianas, a U.S. commonwealth, some 40
miles north of Guam, Minogue said.
   Rota was getting heavy rains and winds up to 50 mph, the same
conditions the Mariana islands of Tinian and Saipan could expect
Monday, he said.
   On Guam, all Navy aircraft were placed in hangers for protection
against the strong winds, and the USS Haleakala was sent out to sea
to weather the storm, said Lt. Dave Lee. Three other warships were
allowed to remain in port, he said.
   Twelve planes, including 11 B-52s, at Andersen Air Force Base on
the north coast of Guam, were parked behind fortifications as the
storm approached, said base spokesman Capt. Wayne Perry.
   A tropical storm has sustained winds ranging from 39 to 73 mph.
A typhoon has a minimum sustained surface wind of 74 mph.
