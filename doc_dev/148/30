   A federal grand jury on Guam returned a 52-count indictment against Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc.'s executive vice president Arthur Abba Goldberg and company consultant Frederick L. Mann, alleging bribery, fraud and obstruction of justice. 

   Most of the charges stem from the roles of Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann in the company's handling of a $300 million Guam housing bond issue in 1985, William O'Connor, Guam's U.S. attorney, said. 
Some of the counts also relate to their handling of an $80 million housing issue for Guam's neighboring island, Saipan, and a $400 million issue for the Pacific island of Palau, Mr. O'Connor added. 

   The indictments are the first to come from a wide-ranging federal criminal investigation -- believed to include at least five other grand juries in the mainland U.S. -- of the tiny Wall Street bond house. 
The Guam bond issue is among more than 20 Matthews &amp; Wright municipal issues, representing about $3 billion, that federal authorities believe may have been sham transactions put together by Matthews &amp; Wright to beat a federal tax deadline. 

   Few, if any, projects have been built from the issues but they reaped enormous profits for the company and its principals while duping and defrauding some of the poorest municipalities in America, officials close to these investigations believe. 

   Mr. Goldberg will be ordered to post a $1 million recognizance bond and report to the island on Jan. 15 for a hearing in U.S. District Court, Mr. O'Connor said. 
The court also has issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Mann, president of J.D. Moore &amp; Co., a Toronto investment concern, and decreed that he be held in jail in lieu of $1 million bail. 
Mr. Mann is a felon convicted by Canadian courts in 1984 of swindling a dying widow out of $65,000, Toronto court records show. 

   Neither Mr. Goldberg nor Mr. Mann could be reached immediately for comment. 

   In the indictments, which don't name Matthews &amp; Wright itself, Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann are accused of channeling $70,000 in bribes -- part of $350,000 in bribery offers -- to former Guam Gov. Ricardo Bordallo for use in his 1986 election campaign in exchange for Mr. Bordallo's approval of the Guam issue. 

   The indictments also charge that a substantial portion of the funds paid to Mr. Bordallo were illicitly diverted from a Guam government fund that had been set up by the island's legislature to support local developers' efforts to construct housing to be financed by the $300 million housing issue. 

   The indictments also allege that Mr. Goldberg supervised the billing of $27,500 to the fund in the name of a non-existent company and in another case obtained a $30,000 fund payment "for work which was not done." 

   Mr. Bordallo earlier this year was acquitted of bribery charges related to the Matthews &amp; Wright payoffs but was convicted on unrelated bribery and extortion charges in connection with business on Guam. 
John Gilliam, a former aide to Mr. Bordallo, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court last summer to a wire-fraud charge in connection with the $70,000 bribery payment, records in Guam U.S. District Court show. 

   The indictment also alleges an "overarching scheme" by Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann to obtain "more than $11 million" in fees for the company and themselves by a "complex wire and mail fraud scheme involving a number of small, financially unsophisticated Pacific and stateside local jurisdictions." 
The indictment contends that the two men, by using an "unlicensed" bank on Saipan controlled by Mr. Mann, "bogus checks and bank accounts and world-wide wire transactions" promoted a "nationwide fraud." 

   In one example, the indictment charges that Messrs. 
Goldberg and Mann "willfully and knowingly" misrepresented the need for a $400 million bond issue for "undefined, speculative projects" on the tiny Pacific island of Palau, which has 10,000 residents. 

   The documents allege that through a "series of bogus paper transactions" Mr. Goldberg, with the help of certain other Matthews &amp; Wright officials, duped the island's government into believing that its bond issue had been sold, when in fact it hadn't. 

   The indictment charges that certain Matthews &amp; Wright officials went to the extent of contracting with Texas and Pennsylvania computer concerns to print "bogus statements" aimed at convincing Palau officials that the bond transactions were legitimate and had taken place. 

   Also named, but not charged, in the indictment as "relevant" to the Matthews &amp; Wright scheme were: Edward K. Strauss, a Pennsylvania attorney for the company; George W. Benoit, a Matthews &amp; Wright founder and its chief executive officer; Roger J. Burns, the company's chief financial officer; Joseph Craven, identified as a Matthews &amp; Wright "junior executive"; Joel Schwarz, manager of New American Federal Credit Union of Jersey City, New Jersey; John C. Zaccaro, identified only as a Matthews &amp; Wright employee; and Phillip J. Kieffer, a Matthews &amp; Wright consultant. 
None of those listed could be reached immediately for comment.
