<HEAD>Guam Governor Signs Most Restricted Abortion Law in U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AGANA, Guam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Joseph F. Ada today signed into law a
bill containing the most restrictive abortion legislation in the
United States, and opponents pledged to fight to measure all the
way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``The question for me really boils down to one simple point,''
Ada said. ``In my heart, I believe a fetus is a human being.''
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. The law makes it a third-degree felony to
perform an abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a
woman to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person
to solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Although the bill is now law, it contains a clause calling for a
referendum on abortion during the Nov. 6 general election, allowing
voters to decide whether they want to retain the law.
   Ada signed the bill before a room packed with dozens of abortion
rights supporters and opponents.
   ``My personal views on the subject of abortion have been stated
many times and should be, by now, fairly well known,'' Ada said.
``I do not agree with the practice of abortion, except in the case
of rape, incest and where the life of the mother may be
threatened.''
   ``It was outrageous that the bill was signed,'' said Janet
Benshoof, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Reproductive Freedom Project, based in New York.
   Benshoof arrived Sunday in this U.S. territory in the western
Pacific Ocean, hoping to meet with Ada to discuss the implications
of the bill. The meeting never took place.
   ``I was devastated he was making a personal opinion,'' Benshoof
said. ``We all have a conscience. I believe he should be making the
decision for the people of Guam.''
   Benshoof said she will remain on Guam for ``as long as it
takes'' and said she has no immediate plans to return to New York.
   The unicameral Guam Legislature unanimously approved the bill
March 8 despite an opinion from Attorney General Elizabeth
Barrett-Anderson that it is unconstitutional.
   It was amended before approval to provide the public referendum
on the abortion issue.
   The vote came after Archbishop Anthony Apuron threatened to
excommunicate any Roman Catholic senator who voted against the
measure. All but one of the 21 senators are Catholic, as is Ada.
However, not all senators were aware of Apuron's threat before the
vote.
   Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom
Project, had said the Guam law, if approved, would give the U.S.
Supreme Court the opportunity to decide the core issue of the right
to abortion.
   In a letter sent to Ada before the signing, Benshoof said the
case would be ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court.
