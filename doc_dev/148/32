<HEAD>Governor Ponders Restrictive Abortion Bill as Deadline Nears</HEAD>

   Abortion on demand would be illegal in this
U.S. territory if Gov. Joseph Ada fails to veto a bill passed
unanimously by the 21-member Legislature.
   Supporters of legalized abortion have started a campaign to
pressure Ada to cast a veto, while abortion opponents applauded the
legislation.
   ``Clearly the people of Guam don't want abortion on demand and
have made a clear statement on this,'' said Nancy Myers, the
National Right to Life Committee's director of communications in
Washington.
   Ada can veto the most restrictive abortion legislation in the
United States, or sign it into law. If he does neither by midnight
Tuesday, it will become law automatically.
   Under the bill, abortion would be allowed only if a pregnancy
endangers a woman's health. Two independent doctors would have to
give their approval and their decision would have to be reviewed by
a committee appointed by the Guam Medical Licensure Board.
   The bill was amended before approval to provide for a referendum
on the issue in November.
   Janet Benshoof, director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of
the American Civil Liberties Union, was to arrive here Sunday to
lobby against the bill.
   ``Our position is that the bill is patently unconstitutional,''
Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the project, said in New York.
``If the bill becomes law, we expect that it would be struck down
in the lower courts.''
   The ACLU is concerned that the measure could threaten the
landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision which legalized abortion.
   ``Guam seems far away and only a territory, but passage of this
law could take Roe versus Wade away from women all over the
nation.''
   The Legislature approved the bill March 8 after Archbishop
Anthony Apuron threatened to excommunicate any of its 20 Roman
Catholic lawmakers who might vote against it. However, not all of
the legislators were aware of the threat before the vote was taken.
   Myers said her group does not plan to send anyone to Guam to
lobby Ada to sign the bill.
   ``The people of Guam have spoken and we are not going to try to
foist anything on them like the ACLU is doing,'' she said.
   Ada, who is also Roman Catholic, has said the bill will have to
be thoroughly studied by legal experts before he makes a decision.
His deputy chief of staff, Mark Forbes, said the bill is ``a bit
more severe than the governor's personal view.''
