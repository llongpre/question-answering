<HEAD>Guam Abortion Law Rescinded; May Set Stage for Supreme Court</HEAD>

   A federal judge overturned the nation's most
restrictive abortion law on Thursday. Pro-choice activists said an
appeal of that ruling would threaten the Supreme Court's landmark
Roe vs. Wade decision.
   U.S. District Judge Alex Munson declared that Roe vs. Wade, the
1973 decision establishing the right to an abortion, ``applied with
equal force and effect to Guam.''
   Government attorneys and other defendants in the case argued the
law did not apply to Guam because of the island's status as an
unincorporated territory.
   The law, signed by Gov. Joseph Ada on March 19, banned abortions
except when the woman's life is in danger. But Munson on March 23
blocked its enforcement while he weighed a challenge to the law
from abortion-rights forces.
   ``The threat we live with is that the Supreme Court has
indicated a willingness to overturn Roe vs. Wade,'' Kate Michelman,
executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League,
said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   ``If the governor appeals (Munson's ruling) he will endanger the
rights of all women by providing the vehicle for the overturning of
Roe vs. Wade. Our goal is to keep these cases out of the courts,''
Michelman said.
   The governor said he did not know whether he would appeal.
   ``I'm still very pro-life, and I believe that a fetus is a human
being and should be given life,'' said Ada, a Roman Catholic like
the vast majority of Guam's residents.
   Abortion opponents say they were not surprised by the judge's
decision, adding the next step probably will be an appeal that
would send the case to the Supreme Court.
   ``We figured that it wouldn't be an easy climb,'' said Roland
Rivera, vice president of Guamanians United for Life. ``There is
just the next higher level to pursue.''
   ``Guam's strong law ... could not be upheld without overturning
Roe vs. Wade,'' said Rep. Woody Jenkins, D-La., lead author of an
anti-abortion bill approved by the Louisiana Legislature but vetoed
by Gov. Buddy Roemer.
   ``Although it's not surprising that a federal district judge
would follow the Roe decision and rule against the Guam law, it
must be remembered that this is just the first stage in the
process,'' Jenkins said.
   ``What is important is that this decision be appealed all the
way to the Supreme Court so that the highest court in the land is
given the chance to stop the killing of unborn babies,'' he said in
Baton Rouge.
   Munson's ruling said the law was unconstitutional because it
violated free speech and due process clauses of the Constitution.
   ``The ruling tells states they don't have the power to overturn
Roe vs. Wade,'' Simon Heller, an attorney with the Reproductive
Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``But I doubt it will stop
legislatures from adopting similar laws. It's not like the Supreme
Court issued this ruling.''
