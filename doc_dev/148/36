   A federal judge today issued a temporary
restraining order allowing women in this U.S. territory to seek
abortions despite a law banning the procedure.
   The order resulted from a lawsuit filed by Janet Benshoof,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union Reproductive Freedom
Project, Rachael Pine, staff attorney for the project, said from
New York. Pine provided The Associated Press a copy of U.S.
District Judge Alex R. Munson's order.
   Munson scheduled a hearing for Monday at which he will decide
whether to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement of
the law until the lawsuit is heard in court, according to Pine.
   The law prohibits abortions except when a pregnancy endangers
the life of the mother. It makes it a third-degree felony to
perform abortion or aid in the procedure, a misdemeanor for a woman
to solicit or have an abortion and a misdemeanor for a person to
solicit a woman to have an abortion.
   Gov. Joseph Ada signed the measure into law Monday. It was
unanimously passed March 8 by the territory's Legislature.
   Benshoof was charged Tuesday with a misdemeanor charge of
solicitation to commit abortion after she tested the law by
advising women seeking abortions to travel to Honolulu.
   She pleaded innocent in Guam Superior Court and is free on her
own recognizance. Pine said if the judge grants the preliminary
injuction, the ACLU would have grounds to ask that charges against
Benshoof be dropped.
   Guam is an island in the western Pacific Ocean about 1,500 miles
east of the Philippines.
