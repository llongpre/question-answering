   Typhoon Percy battered the Pacific
island of Palau and then roared Sunday toward the Philippines,
where 30 people were killed in a tropical storm last week.
   One child was killed on Palau, a newspaper said.
   The Manila weather bureau reported at 5 a.m. Monday that Percy,
packing 93 mph winds, was centered about 465 miles east of the
Philippine island of Samar.
   Percy was moving west-northwest at about 19 mph toward the
islands of Catanduanes and southeastern Luzon island, which were
expected to feel the effects of the storm late Monday, the weather
bureau said.
   Storm signals were raised over southeastern Luzon and the
central Visayas island chain, which includes Samar.
   In Palau, a young boy died Saturday night when he was swept by
rain into mangrove trees near his home in the cluster of islands
that comprise Palau, the Pacific Daily News of Guam reported.
   The storm passed 90 miles north of Palau, which is 800 miles
south of Guam, according to the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   Wind gusts of up to 103 mph blew off tin roofs of many buildings
and knocked radio and television stations off the air, the Pacific
Daily News said.
   Airline flights into the republic were canceled, the newspaper
said.
   Earlier Sunday, the typhoon's winds battered Yap Island in the
neighboring Federated States of Micronesia, collapsing about 30
houses and damaging banana and coconut plantations, police said.
There were no reports of injuries on Yap.
   On Friday, Typhoon Ofelia swept over the eastern coast of Luzon,
the main Philippine island, then struck Taiwan. Officials said at
least 30 people were killed in the Philippines and at least seven
in Taiwan.
   More than 84,000 people in the Philippines were forced to flee
their homes because of flooding and landslides touched off by
Ofelia, officials said. Officials were still assessing damage to
crops and infrastructure.
   About 20 typhoons and tropical storms strike the Philippines
each year.
