   Typhoon Russ raked Guam today with wind up to
135 mph and pummeled the U.S. territory's southern coast with huge
waves that caused severe flooding.
   No serious injuries or deaths were reported, but power and water
service were disrupted in many areas and police reported some
looting, Ken Booth of Guam Cable TV said.
   The storm was the strongest to hit this western Pacific island
in more than a decade. Its eye moved within 15 miles of Guam's
southern coast early today, and wind hit 135 mph in the south and
90 mph with gusts of 115 mph in central and northern areas, said
Lt. Diane Edson of the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.
   Fifteen minor injuries and no deaths were reported, Booth said.
   ``It was quite a blow, but not as bad as had been expected,'' he
said.
   Gov. Joseph Ada said about 500 families in the southern town of
Agat were displaced, Booth reported. About 2,500 people sought
shelter during the storm.
   Power and water service remained down in many areas, and
officials said it would be three days before full power was
restored, according to Booth.
   Booth said police reported looting in some areas. The duty-free
store in the central town of Tumon reported being robbed of
$250,000 in Rolex watches and an undetermined amount of other
jewelry. There were reports of looting in other areas as well. No
arrests were made.
   Waves cresting as high as 24 feet caused severe flooding in
southern Guam, uncovering corpses in the cemetery in the town of
Inarajan, Booth said.
   Several large concrete utility poles installed after the last
major typhoon, Pamela in 1976, snapped in half from the force of
the waves, Booth said.
   Russ damaged or destroyed only the few wooden homes remaining on
the island. Concrete structures built after Pamela escaped serious
damage.
   Ada said he planned to ask for federal disaster relief
assistance.
   Booth said the capital of Agana looked like a ``war zone,'' with
trees, traffic lights, poles and signs strewn about and flooding
everywhere.
   The storm center was out to sea and headed toward the
Philippines with sustained winds of 145 mph and gusts of 175 mph,
Edson said. It was moving at 15 mph, but was expected to weaken
before it reached the Philippines.
