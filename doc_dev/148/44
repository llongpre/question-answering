   Hours before he was to leave the island to
begin a prison term, a former two-term governor of Guam chained
himself to a public statue, wrapped himself in Guam's flag and
fatally shot himself in the head.
   Found at the base of the statue were four handwritten placards,
one of which said, ``I regret I only have one life to give for my
island,'' according to police Lt. Phil Dennis.
   Former Gov. Ricardo ``Ricky'' Bordallo, 62, shot himself
Wednesday less than four hours before he was to fly to Los Angeles,
where he was to visit his daughter before reporting to the federal
correctional facility at Boron, Calif., to begin a four-year prison
term for witness tampering and obstruction.
   ``I choose death before dishonor,'' Bordallo wrote on another
placard. ``My loving wife ... has my message which she will impart
to the people of Guam in due time.''
   An aide to his wife, territorial Sen. Madeleine Bordallo, said
the senator had not found such a message.
   Reporters who attended a farewell party for Bordallo earlier in
the day said he had appeared to be in good spirits.
   ``I didn't think this would happen,'' Congressional Del. Ben
Blaz said from Washington. ``Ricky Bordallo always seemed to bounce
back from his many adversities.''
   At a busy downtown intersection, Bordallo shot himself with a
.38-caliber pistol while chained to the statue of Chief Quipuha,
the first chief in Guam to adopt Christianity, Dennis said.
   He died a short time later of massive brain damage, according to
a spokesman at the Guam Naval Hospital. Mrs. Bordallo was
reportedly with him when he died.
   Territorial flags were lowered to half-staff, and Gov. Joseph
Ada declared a state of mourning until after Bordallo's funeral,
which is yet to be scheduled.
   Bordallo told the Pacific Daily News in an interview last Friday
that he was facing his prison term with ``complete serenity.''
   ``When a man is innocent, his conscience is clear, and he is at
peace with himself,'' Bordallo said.
   But he also said: ``My own instincts make me believe that I will
not be coming back from Boron alive. I'm not dwelling on how it
will happen. I will be in the hands of people who are masters of
intrigue.''
   Bordallo was found guilty in February 1987 of getting engineer
Johnny Carpio to lie to federal officials about a $60,000 political
contribution from a group of Japanese businessmen.
   During his trial, Bordallo admitted accepting money from the
businessmen, but contended the money was a campaign contribution.
   Carpio was convicted of extortion and bribery and was placed on
five years' probation.
   Bordallo, a Democrat, served as governor from 1974 to 1978, and
again from 1982 to 1986, when he was defeated by Republican Ada.
