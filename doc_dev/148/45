   Gov. Joseph Ada's chief counsel contends in
court papers that the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision guaranteeing
the right to an abortion does not apply to this U.S. territory.
   The memorandum argued that Roe vs. Wade and Webster v.
Reproductive Health Services, the July decision giving states more
authority to restrict abortion without overturning the earier
ruling, are not in force in Guam because it is a territory.
   Ada signed the nation's most restrictive anti-abortion measure
into law last month. Enforcement remains on hold pending a hearing
in federal court May 8 on a challenge brought by a woman who wants
an abortion.
   Katherine Maraman, the governor's legal counsel, and attorney
Monessa Lujan argued that many of the Constitution's due process
and equal-protection provisions do not fully apply to Guam in
recognition of its traditions.
   The new law, if upheld by the court, would make it a felony for
doctors to perform abortions and a misdemeanor for women to have
abortions, except in cases where the pregnancy would endanger the
mother's life.
   The measure also makes it a misdemeanor to solicit women to have
an abortion.
