   The Securities and Exchange Commission voted to authorize its staff to charge Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. and several officers of that bond house with fraud and other securities law violations, according to people familiar with the situation. 

   The action occurred Tuesday at a closed meeting and wasn't announced. 
It authorizes the SEC's enforcement staff to enter into settlement negotiations and, if those fail, to file suit alleging a host of violations in connection with Matthews &amp; Wright's role as underwriter of more than $1 billion of municipal bonds and as issuer of its own stock, the individuals said. 

   The vote, though unannounced, appears to kick off a kind of fall offensive by the SEC against abuses in the municipal-bond market. 
The agency is scheduled to release today the results of its investigation into Washington Public Power Supply System's gigantic 1983 $2.25 billion municipal-bond default. 
It also plans today to decide in an open meeting whether to release a broader report on the municipal-bond market in general, perhaps to demonstrate that the WPPSS case isn't an anomaly, as some on Wall Street contend. 
Finally, it will vote on whether to propose for comment a rule designed to enhance disclosure in the municipal market. 

   By taking action against Matthews &amp; Wright and proposing changes in the way the municipal-bond market works, the SEC may hope to assuage some in Congress who expressed outrage when it was reported this year that the commission had rejected its staff's recommendation to bring charges in the WPPSS matter. 

   Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement chief, couldn't be reached for comment. 
An agency spokeswoman declined to comment. 

   David Aufhauser, a Matthews &amp; Wright attorney, said, "I've had discussions with the commission staff, but I can't comment beyond that." 
Matthews &amp; Wright has consistently denied any wrongdoing, and insists that all its municipal-bond underwritings conformed with industry practices. 

   The SEC's charges pertain to about 25 municipal-bond deals underwritten by Matthews &amp; Wright in 1985 and 1986, and to an offering of 1.5 million shares of its stock in August 1986. 
The SEC case doesn't include Matthews &amp; Wright's best-known deals, the $380 million of controversial issues underwritten for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in 1984 and 1985. 

   The agency may have chosen not to include the Pacific issues in part because they are being scrutinized by other arms of the U.S. government. 

   Last year, a federal grand jury in Guam charged Arthur Abba Goldberg, Matthews &amp; Wright's executive vice president, with fraud, bribery and obstruction of justice. 
Mr. Goldberg, who is on a voluntary leave of absence from the firm, pleaded innocent, and is scheduled to go on trial in January. 

   Last month, the Internal Revenue Service said interest income on the Guam and Marianas bonds isn't exempt from taxes. 
The tax-exempt status is the major selling point of municipal bonds. 
New York-based Matthews &amp; Wright responded that it believes the issues were made validly and that the interest income is tax exempt. 

   In addition to Mr. Goldberg, the Matthews &amp; Wright officials who could be charged by the SEC are Chairman George Benoit and Roger Burns, treasurer and chief financial officer. 
Also listed is Bernard Althoff, who is identified as the firm's outside corporate counsel.
