   Gov. Joseph Ada posted an easy victory
Tuesday, making the Republican the first governor to win
back-to-back terms in the U.S. territory's history.
   With all 76 precincts reporting, Ada received 20,677 votes to
Democrat Madeleine Bordallo's 15,688 votes, the Guam Election
Commission reported.
   Final official tallies are expected Wednesday, the commission
said.
   The abortion issue was not a factor in the vote, as both
candidates oppose abortion and support a court challenge to a
decision striking down the territory's restrictive abortion law.
   Bordallo, the first woman and non-native Guamanian to run for
governor, is the widow of former Gov. Ricardo Bordallo. Her husband
committed suicide Jan. 30, one day before he was to begin an
18-month federal prison term in California. He was not in office at
the time of his death.
   In the territory's congressional election, Republican Ben Blaz
won a fourth term as a non-voting delegate, defeating Democrat Ben
Pagelinan by 21,390 to 16,437.
