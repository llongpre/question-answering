   Guam wants the United States to pay millions of
dollars in reparations for the brutal Japanese occupation of the
Pacific island during World War II, a debt the U.S. government
forgave in 1951 for diplomatic reasons.
   ``Although we feel that a moral obligation'' falls on Japan, ``we
cannot seek justice from the Japanese,'' said Joseph F. Ada,
governor of the U.S. territory located only 1,150 miles from Tokyo.
   From 1941-44, Guam suffered through some of the most brutal
treatment ever inflicted on an American community. Survivors recall
massacres, beatings, forced labor and other horrors.
   But the United States ``most unfortunately gave away our right to
reparation from the Japanese in its 1951 peace treaty with Japan ...
without anybody once asking our people,'' according to Ada.
   The Bush administration opposes reparations, saying the U.S.
government spent $8 million immediately after the war on 4,200
death, personal injury and property damage claims.
   ``There is no reason for the American taxpayers to pay further
compensation for World War II claims arising from enemy action,''
said Larry L. Morgan of the Interior Department, which in 1950 took
over responsibility for Guam from the Navy.
   A Guam Reparations Commission appointed this year asked for
compensation totaling $160 million to include payments for deaths,
injuries, forced labor, forced marches or internment.
   The waiver of Japanese reparations, granted early in the Korean
War, ``was a policy decision of the United States to conclude a
quick treaty with Japan ... to turn Japan into a valuable Asian ally
and a bulwark against communist expansion,'' Ada said.
   Ada appeared last month at a hearing on Guam war reparations
legislation introduced by Ben Blaz, Guam's non-voting delegate in
the House of Representatives. The measure faces more hearings and a
possible committee vote later this year.
   The island of 212 square miles _ about one-sixth the size of
Rhode Island _ was acquired from Spain in 1898 after the
Spanish-American War. It remains a key U.S. Pacific military base.
   Japanese still invade Guam, but this time as tourists boosting
the island's main civilian industry, accounting for most of the
500,000 annual visitors to Guam's beaches.
   Blaz and Ada say the new payments are justified in light of $67
million paid in Micronesian war claims and the $20,000 authorized by
Congress for each Japanese-American interned during World War II.
   Too little time was allowed for filing claims after the war and
there was confusion over the eligibility of Guam natives, who
received U.S. citizenship only in 1950, said Blaz.
   Guam senator Eddie Duenas said: ``Apparently, many who were
eligible failed to file mostly because they did not know about it or
were too preoccupied rebuilding their shattered lives.''
   A Guamanian woman, Mrs. Beatrice Perez Emsley, recalled during
the summer hearings that as a girl of 13 she regained consciousness
in a mass grave of decapitated and mutilated Chamorros, native
tribespeople.
   She said a Japanese soldier had tossed her there without
realizing that his attempt to behead her had failed because he used
a bayonet instead of sword.
   ``I could not breathe from the pain in my neck and head and the
dirt was beginning to choke me ... I had to bear the pain and keep
still or else those Japanese soldiers would stab me or shoot me,''
she said.
   Mrs. Emsley, now 58, said she finally crawled into the jungle and
wandered for a week until another Guamanian fugitive found her.
Years later, they met members of the U.S. 3rd Marine Division who
were liberating the island.
   Reparations ``will not remove from us the awful memories of the
horrors we witnessed or experienced,'' she said, but they ``will
show us just that somebody cares about what happened to us.''
   Duenas, the senator, said that the United States made death
payments ranging as low as $221 and high as $3,500 to 750 people on
Guam after the war.
   Island residents maintain that 8 percent to 10 percent of the
population, or up to 2,000 people, were killed and 90 percent
suffered severe hardship, injury or disease.
   The Blaz bill contained an initial authorization for $20 million,
specifying $20,000 for the estates of those killed, $15,000 for
personal injury, $10,00 for forced labor and $7,000 for forced march
or internment.
