A major earthquake rocked the Northern Mariana Islands this morning, and 
seismologists pinpointed its epicenter off Anatahan Island, about 230 miles 
north of Guam. The island was evacuated two days earlier amid mounting fears 
that its volcano was erupting. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Hattori of the U.S. Geological Survey office in Guam said the temblor had 
a magnitude of 7.4 and placed its epicenter in the Marianas Trench, one of the 
world's deepest ocean chasms, in the Western Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. Larry Guerrero of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands issued 
a tidal wave warning for Saipan and Tinian islands, part of the island cluster 
that comprise the U.S. territory. 
</P>
<P>
The 7:14 a.m. jolt startled residents from their sleep on Guam and several 
other islands in the Mariana chain, but there were no immediate reports of 
damage or injuries.
