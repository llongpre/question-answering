   Typhoon Koryn, packing
110 mph gusts, knocked down trees and cut electrical power in the
capital of this U.S. commonwealth before moving away today,
authorities said.
   No serious injuries were immediately reported.
   The typhoon with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph swept past
Saipan and was moving to the northeast at 8 mph, said Air Force
Maj. Joel Martin, a meteorologist with the Guam-based Joint Typhoon
Warning Center Rapid Response Team.
   As of 4 p.m. (1 a.m. EST), Koryn was 65 miles north of Saipan,
Martin said.
   There were reports of downed trees and power lines before
communications were cut with Saipan, Martin said, but added the
storm's path ``seemed to have spared them a lot of the heavier
winds.''
   Forecasters predicted the typhoon would not affect any other
islands before it lost power.
   The winds damaged power lines, cutting electricity on the island
Sunday night, said Jean-Louis M. Pierrefeu, assistant executive
director for the Commonwealth Utilities Corp.'s power branch.
   As the storm approached, residents boarded up houses, put boats
to sea and moved to shelters, said Civil Defense coordinator Felix
Sasamopo. The airport was closed.
   Conditions on Rota, the most southern of the Marianas, were not
known because of poor communications, Martin said.
   The first island to feel the typhoon was Guam, just to the south
of the Northern Marianas.
   Koryn skirted the U.S. territory to the west Sunday night with
heavy rains and 90 mph gusts, knocking out power and sending more
than 500 people to shelters. Without electricity, the island's
130,000 residents were without water.
   By tonight, electricity had been restored to at least 65 percent
of Guam and 50 percent of the island had running water, said Ben
Reyes, of the Guam Civil Defense.
   Island residents had been warned to keep a three-day supply of
water, Reyes said.
   All of the people who had sought shelter had returned to their
homes except for the 59 members of four families, who were provided
emergency housing, he said.
   Updated reports showed four people suffered minor injuries from
the storm, while the tin roofs of two houses were blown off, Reyes
said.
