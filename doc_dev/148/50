<HEAD>SEC Said to Authorizes Civil Charges Against New York Bond House</HEAD>

   The Securities and Exchange Commission has
authorized its staff to charge Matthews &amp; Wright Group Inc. and
several officers of the bond house with fraud and other abuses in
connection with the underwriting of more than $1 billion in
municipal bonds, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.
   Quoting what it called people familiar with the situation, the
newspaper said the SEC took the unannounced step at a closed-door
meeting Tuesday. The reported action followed a major inquiry into
the New York firm's activities.
   SEC spokeswoman Mary McCue declined comment on the Journal
report, in accordance with the agency's policy on enforcement
matters.
   But the SEC had stated in a previously published notice that its
agenda for the Tuesday session included ``institution of
administrative proceedings of an enforcement nature.''
   David Aufhauser, a Matthews &amp; Wright attorney, was not
immediately available to comment, a receptionist said. The Journal
quoted him as saying he'd had discussions with the SEC staff but
could not elaborate.
   Matthews &amp; Wright has consistently denied wrongdoing and has
asserted its underwriting practices conform with industry practices.
   The Journal quoted sources as saying the SEC action means the
agency's enforcement staff will enter into settlement negotiations
with Matthews &amp; Wright. If those fail, the sources were quoted as
saying, the SEC may charge the firm with a range of alleged abuses.
   Most of the charges stem from Matthews &amp; Wright's role as an
underwriter of 25 municipal bond deals in 1985 and 1986, the
sources were quoted as saying.
   The SEC case doesn't include the firm's best-known deals, $380
million in questionable issues underwritten for Guam and the
Northern Mariana islands in 1984 and 1985, the newspaper quoted
sources as saying.
   It was unclear why these were omitted, but the newspaper said it
may have been because other government enforcement agencies are
scrutinizing them.
   Last year a federal grand jury in Guam charged Arthur Abba
Goldberg, the firm's executive vice president, with fraud, bribery
and obstruction of justice. He's pleaded innocent and will go on
trial in January.
   In August, the Internal Revenue Service decreed that interest
income on the Guam and Mariana bonds aren't tax-exempt. This is
significant because the tax-exempt status of such issues is a major
selling point of municipal bonds.
